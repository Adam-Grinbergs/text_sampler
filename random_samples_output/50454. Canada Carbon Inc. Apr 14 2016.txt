Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment 

for the Miller Graphite and Marble Project, 

Grenville Township, Quebec, Canada 

  

 

1.0  SUMMARY  

1.1 INTRODUCTION 

Canada Carbon Inc. (Canada Carbon) retained Tetra Tech to prepare a National 

Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) preliminary economic assessment (PEA) for the Miller 

Graphite and Marble Project (the Project), located in the developed Outaouais region of 

southern Quebec, Canada. The Project contemplates the extraction of graphite and 

marble from three proposed open pits, and the planned production of approximately 

1,500 t of high-purity graphite and 150,000 t of marble blocks per annum. 

This study is intended to assist Canada Carbon in determining potential future plans for 

the Project, and the approach to high-purity graphite production and marble block 

extraction. 

The effective date of this report is March 4, 2016 and the effective date of the Mineral 

Resource estimate is February 16, 2016. 

1.2 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 

The Miller Property is composed of 31 contiguous claims located on the eastern side of 

the Rouge River and covers an area of 1,863.09 ha. The surface footprint for the 

proposed mining pits, processing plant, and infrastructure is estimated to utilize 100 ha 

of the Miller Property, with the exploration work conducted to-date limited to 22 ha of 

that area.  The 40 claims on the western side of the Rouge River that make up the Miller 

West Property are not included in the PEA. 

The Miller Property is located in the well-developed Outaouais region of southern Quebec, 

approximately 75 km west of Montreal, Quebec, and 90 km east of Ottawa, Ontario 

(Figure 1.1).  The approximate geographic centre of the Miller Property is located at 

530,385 m east and 5,056,900 m north.  The closest cities are Grenville, Quebec (5 km 

to the south), and Hawkesbury, Ontario (8 km to the south).  The Miller Property is 

located within the boundaries of the Argenteuil Regional County Municipality and is within 

the territory of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge municipality. 

All-year access roads are available to access the Project site.  The site is easily accessible 

from Highway 50, which runs on the southern part of the Property.  Highway 50 is a 

provincial road linking the greater Montreal area to the greater Ottawa area.  A railroad 

passes through the Ottawa Valley near the town of Grenville. 

A local paved road, Scotch Road, traverses the Miller Property from south to north.  The 

Miller Property is accessible from Scotch Road via a network of bush trails, which runs

more or less east to west.  Many existing forestry roads are present in, and around, the 

Miller Property, which allow alternate access routes.   

The graphite materials mined from the proposed pits will be processed at the Miller site.  

The flotation concentrate produced at the Miller site will be shipped to the Asbury site for 

further upgrading.  The Asbury site is located approximately 150 km northwest of the 

Miller site (Figure 1.1).  The Asbury site is easily accessible via Chemin du Ruisseau 

Serpent Road, which passes south of the Asbury site and connects with the nearby Notre-

Dame-Du-Laus village, which is a municipality in the Laurentides region of Quebec, 

Canada.

1.3 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

Sir William Logan described the graphite occurrence, on Lot 10 of Range V of the 

Grenville Township, in 1845-1846, and R.V. Harwood of Vaudreuil (Ells 1904; Cirkel 

1907) subsequently initiated mining operations.  The Project area lies in the Grenville 

Geological Province; which is recognized as a deeply exhumed Mesoproterozoic 

Himalayan-type collision orogenic belt that extends over thousands of kilometres and is 

interpreted as a collage of gneissic terranes that were subjected to high-grade 

metamorphism.  The Project area is included in the south portion of the Morin Terrane, 

composed of supracrustal rocks, commonly at granulite metamorphic facies, and 

intruded by several bodies of granitic to anorthositic composition.  The well-banded 

quartzo-feldspathic gneisses were divided into two groups and quartzites were 

documented as very massive, well-jointed, white or pinkish rocks.  Crystalline limestone 

appeared to correspond to two large beds. Graphite is observed as dissemination and 

pods/veins in the marble, skarn, and paragneiss units of the Miller Property. Since the 

acquisition of the Miller Property in 2013, SL Exploration Inc. has been conducting 

exploration on behalf of Canada Carbon. Several pods and veins have been identified 

and explored and multiple new graphite showings; including nine surface graphite 

showings of high-grade, and large, lower-grade dissemination of graphite in marble and 

skarn units have been discovered. 

1.4 DRILLING 

Canada Carbon performed a number of drilling campaigns between 2013 and 2015 to 

test geophysical targets (conductors) and to extend identified surface graphite 

mineralization to depth.  A total of 95 holes were drilled on the Miller Property for a total 

5,283.53 m. 

1.5 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

The Mineral Resource estimate was conducted following the Canadian Institute of 

Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definitions Standards for Mineral Resources in 

accordance with NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  Mineral 

Resources, which are not Mineral Reserves, do not have demonstrated economic 

viability.  Inferred Mineral Resources are exclusive of the Measured and Indicated 

Mineral Resources.  The Mineral Resource estimation work for the Project was conducted 

by Jean-Philippe Paiement, M.Sc., P.Geo, of SGS Canada Inc. (SGS).  The 3D modelling, 

geostatistics, and grade interpolation of the block model was conducted using Genesis© 

software developed by SGS.  The optimized pit shells and cut-off grade estimation were 

conducted by Tetra Tech.  These pit shells were used to report Mineral Resources.  Two 

independent types of Mineral Resources were estimated and are exclusive of each other 

(Table 1.1).  Given the results from the metallurgical testing of low-grade graphite 

samples, and the price of the commodity, disseminated and vein (pod) hosted graphite 

can be considered as Mineral Resources.

1.6 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Five flotation metallurgical test programs were conducted on samples originating from 

the Miller deposit, covering a range of head grades from 0.53% graphitic carbon to 

61.2% graphitic carbon.  The five programs consisted of four laboratory scale evaluations 

including a flowsheet development program and one pilot plant campaign processing 

approximately 127 t of a bulk sample.  

The laboratory and pilot scale flotation programs demonstrated that the Miller graphite 

mineralization is amenable to processing using typical mineral processing technologies 

such as grinding and flotation.  A simple reagent regime consisting of fuel oil No. 2 as the 

graphite collector and methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) as the frother proved suitable to 

achieve good graphite concentrate grades and overall carbon recoveries. 

The laboratory and pilot scale programs produced graphite concentrates that consistently 

exceeded combined concentrate grades of 95% total carbon.  The majority of the 

impurities reported to the small size fractions and the medium and large graphite flakes 

yielded concentrate grades of approximately 97% total carbon or higher.  This 

metallurgical performance was consistent for all samples tested despite the large range 

of head grades.  

The pilot plant campaign reached steady state operation in a short period of time, thus 

attesting to the overall robustness of the proposed flowsheet.  The pilot plant campaign 

helped to identify a number of areas for optimization to further enhance the metallurgical 

results.

Preliminary graphite concentrate upgrading tests, including hydrometallurgical and 

thermal purifications, were conducted on graphite flotation concentrates that were 

generated on a laboratory or pilot scale.  The flotation concentrate samples responded 

well to both purification processing methods, although the samples yielded higher 

purities with the thermal treatment.  The thermal purification tests employing a 

proprietary thermal treatment process indicate that a graphite concentrate produced 

from the pilot plant trials can be directly upgraded to a high-purity specialty graphite 

containing 99.9998% graphitic carbon. 

A block of marble weighing approximately 1 t was extracted and shipped to a local 

architectural stone processor for cutting, polishing, and assessment.  There are no 

detailed physical and chemical characteristic test work reports available for the review. 

1.7 MINING METHODS 

Tetra Tech prepared an open pit mining study for the Project based on a target annual 

production of 1,500 t of refined graphite and 150,000 t of marble blocks.  Canada 

Carbon provided Tetra Tech with a signed letter of intent with a potential mining 

contractor for mining graphite material, crushing to finer than 20 mm, and hauling to the 

mill and handling waste rock.  Canada Carbon also provided rental rates for the leased 

supporting and ancillary mining equipment to be utilized for both the graphite and marble 

pits. 

This PEA proposes a 19-year life-of-mine (LOM) for graphite recovery, including 1 year of 

preproduction, 11 years of active mining operations, and 7 years of stockpile re-handling.  

Graphite material will be mined from two open pits (the western pit and the eastern pit) 

and marble will be quarried from a separate pit.  Marble pit production will start one year 

ahead of graphite pit production. 

The graphite pit will be mined using conventional truck/loader open pit mining.  The 

production cycle will include drilling, blasting, loading, and hauling, and will be performed 

by a mining contractor. 

Marble will be cut into blocks using chain saws.  First a horizontal bottom section, with a 

length of 20 m and a depth of 2.25 m, will be cut.  Second, a back vertical section, with a 

length of 20 m will be cut at a depth of 2.25 m.  Wood blocks will be used to prevent the 

marble blocks from falling.  Vertical cross sections will be cut at approximately 2-m 

intervals to produce 2.25 m by 2.25 m by 2 m marble blocks.  The marble blocks will 

then be separated and pushed down over a prepared cushion layer of crushed rocks 

using hydraulic block pushers.  A fork loader will be used to load the marble blocks into a 

flatbed truck for off-site transportation. 

Key mining results are summarized in Table 1.2.

1.8 RECOVERY METHODS 

The proposed graphite concentration plant will process the Miller graphite mineralization 

using conventional froth flotation.  The processing method is based on the pilot plant test 

results conducted by SGS Canada Inc. (SGS) in Lakefield, Ontario.  The proposed flotation 

plant will be located at the Miller site.  The plant will include two stages of primary 

grinding by rod mills in conjunction with a flash flotation circuit.  The ground mill feed will 

be concentrated by bulk rougher and scavenger flotation followed by bulk cleaner 

flotation.  The bulk cleaner concentrate produced will be classified into three particle 

fractions and refloated separately for further upgrading.  Polishing regrinding is designed 

ahead of each of the cleaner flotation treatments to further liberate gangue minerals 

from the graphite.  The final concentrates with different particle sizes will be dewatered 

separately and bagged prior to being shipped to the Asbury site for further purification 

treatment.  The proposed grinding and flotation flowsheet is shown in Figure 1.2. 

The flotation tailings produced from the rougher/scavenger flotation circuit will be 

dewatered by thickening and filtration.  The filtration cakes will be trucked to the tailings 

stacking facility located adjacent to the graphite pits at the proposed mine site. 

The concentrate produced will be upgraded by a proprietary thermal treatment process to 

generate a high-value, high-purity specialty graphite product, which is anticipated to 

contain higher than 99.99% graphitic carbon.  The thermal treatment plant will be 

located at the Asbury site.  The designed annual production rate of the high-purity 

graphite product is approximately 1,500 t.

1.9 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

MILLER SITE 

The proposed mining and the flotation operation at the Miller site will consist of the 

following main facilities: 

 two graphite pits, one marble pit, and related service facilities 

 various storage pads for: 

 top soils  

 waste rocks 

 extracted marble blocks 

 crushed mill feeds 

 dewatered tailings 

 a mill feed handling system, including a dumping pocket and a conveyor to 

transport the crushed material from the dumping pocket to a 200-t mill feed 

surge bin 

 a main processing complex, including processing plant, assay/metallurgical 

laboratories and offices 

 power supply and distribution systems 

 a water treatment plant, including a contact water sediment pond 

 overall mine site water management systems 

 overall site service roads. 

Electrical power will be supplied from the grid power line which runs along the Scotch 

Road.  The estimated overall site power requirement is approximately 1 MW.  The grid 

power line will be able to supply sufficient electricity required by the mining and 

processing operations. 

The flotation tailings produced from the graphite concentration is approximately 97 to 

99% of the mill feed.  The tailings will be dewatered at the processing plant by thickening 

and filtration processes, to a moisture content of approximately 15% w/w.  The 

dewatered cakes will be trucked and placed onto the tailings dry stacking storage pad 

adjacent to the graphite pits.  When the western graphite pit and the marble pit are 

mined out, the dewatered tailings will be placed directly into the excavated pits.  At the 

end of the operations, the stacked tailings will be backfilled into the excavated graphite 

and marble pits.  A further tailings management plan, including tailings characterizations, 

should be conducted and reviewed in the next phase study.

ASBURY SITE 

The proposed graphite thermal treatment plant will be used to upgrade the graphite 

concentrates produced at the Miller flotation plant to an average grade of higher than 

99.99% graphitic carbon.  The Asbury thermal treatment plant site will include: 

 a thermal upgrading facility, including concentrate receiving and storage; a wet 

scrubbing for off-gas handling; an inert gas storage and handling system; and a 

cooling system 

 a water treatment plant 

 a final graphite product storage and distribution facility 

 a maintenance workshop 

 power supply and distribution systems 

 overall site service roads. 

The total power demand for the thermal upgrading plant is estimated to be approximately 

5 MW.  Electrical power will be supplied from the grid power line along Chemin du 

Ruisseau Serpent Road.  The grid power line will be able to supply the electrical power 

required by the thermal upgrading operation. 

1.10 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 

Various environmental baseline studies were conducted in 2015 and will  continue in 

2016 on both the Miller and Asbury sites.  Information sources include publicly available 

literature, site specific surveys, and government information.  The various permitting 

processes for each site are ongoing.  

The 2015 and early-2016 baseline studies focused on the evaluation of sugar bushes 

with maple production potential, soil characterization for agricultural suitability, wetland 

assessment, and plant and wildlife inventories.  The results of the soil surveys indicate 

that the Miller site is not suitable for agricultural use due to poor soil quality, stoniness, 

and areas with steep slopes and uneven ground. The evaluation of the potential of maple 

syrup production from the sugar bushes indicates that one area is covered by a stand 

with maple production potential if the bushes remain undisturbed.  Effort was made to 

limit the Project's impact over that particular area. 

Baseline studies planned for 2016 include geochemical rock characterization, air quality, 

soil suitability for reclamation, hydrogeology, hydrology, water quality, and spring and 

summer wildlife and vegetation surveys.  Other studies planned for 2016 also include 

noise impact, and evaluation of water management options and strategies. 

The portion of the Miller Property included in the Project includes at least six wetland 

areas comprised of treed swamps, shrub swamps, treed peatbogs, and marshes with 

ecological significance ranging from low to high and terrestrial environments including 

previously harvested uneven-aged hardwood and mixed forest stands (partial cuts). The

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment 

for the Miller Graphite and Marble Project,

majority of the property is covered by hardwood and mixed forest stands comprised of 

both first and second growth, currently under management as a woodlot.  There were 

259 different plant species identified during the vegetation inventory conducted at the 

Miller Property, including 14 with special status or species of interest.  One animal 

species with special status was observed at the Miller Property. 

Previous disturbance at the Miller Property is evident by the presence of several 

abandoned mine pits and mine waste materials related to historical mine operations. 

The Asbury site is on land which was disturbed by previous mining activities.  There  are 

13 separate wetland areas (including treed swamps, shrub swamps, treed peat bogs, 

fen-type (open) peatlands, and marshes and ponds) of low to high ecological value 

(artificial lakes are also present) found on the Asbury Property.  Most of the Asbury 

Property is wooded, covered by uneven-aged hardwood and mixed forest stands that 

have been harvested (partial cuts).  There were 200 different plant species identified 

during the plant inventory conducted around the Asbury site, including two plant species 

with special status or species of interest (both which are designated as vulnerable to 

harvesting).  The thermal treatment plant is not expected to have any adverse impacts on 

any sensitive environments. 

Avoidance, mitigation, and compensation measures will be evaluated, developed, and 

implemented to minimize impacts from project development and operations on the 

environmental and social conditions at the Miller and Asbury sites. 

Monitoring plans will be developed for each site including monitoring of project-related 

noise, air, and dust emissions; effluent and sediment generation; and impacts on 

groundwater, surface water, soil quality, vegetation, wetlands, and wildlife.  Results from 

the Project design, baseline studies, and monitoring programs will be used to evaluate 

project effects and to develop suitable environmental management and closure plans. 

Mine development and operations are expected to have a positive effect on local 

employment (Table 1.3) and economy.  Supplies and labour are expected to be sourced 

from southern Quebec with a priority to local citizens.  Potential issues of social concern 

may include annoyance from noise and vibration generation; air emissions; increased 

traffic, landscape, and visual impacts; and disturbance or destruction of heritage 

resources as applicable.

Mine closure and rehabilitation costs are estimated at $1 million.  Closure plan costs 

were estimated based on the rehabilitation of the tailings disposal area (pit backfilling 

work) and the sedimentation pond.  Demolition of the mill and other infrastructures is 

assumed to be covered by the salvage values of the process equipment, and the waste 

rock will be sold during the LOM.  There will be no waste rock left to manage on site at 

closure. 

1.11 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COST ESTIMATES 

The capital and operating costs for the Project are summarized in Table 1.4 and are

All costs are reflected in Q4 2015/Q1 2016 Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified.  

The expected accuracy range of the cost estimates is +45%/-25%.  For the equipment 

quoted in US dollars, the prices were converted from US dollars to Canadian dollars 

based on the exchange rates when the quotations were received. 

1.12 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

A PEA should not be considered to be a prefeasibility or feasibility study, as the 

economics and technical viability of the Project have not been demonstrated at this time.  

The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are 

considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to 

them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  Furthermore, there 

is no certainty that the conclusions or results as reported in the PEA will be realized.  

Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic 

viability.

Tetra Tech prepared an economic evaluation of the Project based on a pre-tax financial 

model.  The net present value (NPV) was estimated at the beginning of the one-year 

construction period. 

As indicated in Section 19.0 of this report, the graphite and marble prices used in the 

economic analysis are as follows: 

 graphite: USD13,000/t 

 marble: $184/t 

 exchange rate (USD:CAD): 0.75:1.00 

The following pre-tax financial results were calculated: 

 100.2% internal rate of return (IRR) 

 1.9-year payback on $44.4 million initial capital costs 

 $149.7 million NPV at an 8% discount rate. 

Canada Carbon and its external advisors prepared the tax calculations for use in the 

post-tax economic evaluation of the Project with the inclusion of Canada and Quebec 

income taxes, and the Quebec Mining Tax (see Section 22.5 for more details). 

The following post-tax financial results were calculated: 

 85.0% IRR 

 2.0-year payback on the $44.4 million initial capital costs 

 $110.0 million NPV at an 8% discount rate. 

Analyses were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of the Project merit measures (NPV, 

IRR and payback periods) to the following key variables:  

 graphite price 

 marble price 

 exchange rate 

 capital costs 

 operating costs 

Using the base case as a reference, each of the key variables was changed between -

30% and +30% at a 10% interval while holding the other variables constant.  The pre-tax 

NPV, calculated at an 8% discount rate, is most sensitive to exchange rate and, in 

decreasing order, graphite price, marble price, operating costs, and capital costs.  The 

Project's pre-tax IRR is most sensitive to the capital costs followed by marble price, 

graphite price, exchange rate, and operating costs.  The payback period is most sensitive

The Miller Property is located in the Outaouais Region of southern Quebec about 75 km 

west of Montreal, Quebec and 90 km east of Ottawa, Ontario (Figure 4.1).  The Miller 

Property is located in a highly-accessible area of the Quebec province; the closest cities 

are Grenville (5 km to the south) and Hawkesbury, Ontario (8 km to the south).  The Miller 

Property is easily accessible from Highway 50, which runs on the southern part of the 

Property, and Scotch Road, which traverses the Miller Property from south to north 

(Figure 4.2). Highway 50 is a provincial road linking the greater Montreal area to the 

greater Ottawa area. The immediate vicinity of the Miller Property is thinly populated and 

the settlements are mainly concentrated along Scotch Road with relatively limited local 

traffic. The deposit is accessible from Scotch Road via a network of bush trails, which run 

more or less east-west. Many existing forestry roads are also present in and around the 

Miller Property, which allow alternate access routes. The Miller Property is located within 

the boundaries of the Argenteuil Regional County Municipality and is within the territory 

of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge municipality. 

4.2 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 

The Miller Property is located within the National Topographic Series (NTS) Map 

references 31G10. The approximate geographic centre of the Miller Property is located at 

530,385 m east and 5,056,900 m north, Zone 18 North American Datum (NAD) 83. 

The Miller Property is composed of 31 contiguous claims located on the eastern side of 

the Rouge River and covers an area of 1,863.09 ha. The surface footprint for the 

proposed optimized pits, processing plant, and infrastructure utilizes 100 ha of the Miller 

Property with the exploration work conducted to-date limited to 22 ha of that area.  The 

40 claims on the western side of the Rouge River that make up the Miller West Property 

are not included in the PEA. 

4.3 OWNERSHIP 

The Miller Property is 100% held by Canada Carbon and exploration work has been 

conducted by SL Exploration Inc. since its acquisition. SGS verified the Miller Property 

title and mineral rights on the Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources Naturelles's 

(MERN) website. The 31 claims associated with the Miller Property, as registered with the 

MERN, are 100% owned by Canada Carbon and are in good standing with expiry dates 

ranging from May 10, 2016 to December 8, 2017.

In September 2013, Canada Carbon entered into a surface access agreement (the 

Agreement) with two landholders who are affiliated with each other. The Agreement 

provides Canada Carbon with surface access for an initial period of five years and allows 

Canada Carbon to carry out regular graphite prospecting and exploration programs 

including, but not limited to, conducting topographic, geological, geochemical and 

geophysical surveys, conducting underground or surface excavations, exploration and 

drilling, digging and trenching, and obtaining and testing geochemical or metallurgical 

samples.  The Agreement covers most of the area of interest on which Canada Carbon is 

working at this time. The Agreement grants Canada Carbon an exclusive and irrevocable 

option to acquire from the landholder all or part of the Miller Property deemed reasonably 

necessary for the extraction of mineral substances. If Canada Carbon exercises this 

option, by either acquiring or leasing all or part of the Miller Property prior to the expiry of 

the five-year term, the term will be extended through the period of commercial 

production.  

Pursuant to the Agreement, Canada Carbon has agreed to issue 40,000 common shares 

in the capital of Canada Carbon to the landholders for the first year of the term, and for 

each subsequent year of the term and until Canada Carbon begins operating in 

commercial operation (not including milling for the purposes of testing, e.g. pilot plant 

testing), either 40,000 additional common shares or $5,000 payable in cash, at the 

option of the landholder. Should Canada Carbon begin commercial production during the 

term, the payments outlined above will cease and the landholder will be entitled to a 

2.5% net smelter royalty (NSR) upon and subject to the terms of definitive royalty 

agreements. The NSR is applicable to all mineral commodities, including marble. 

The initial acquisition of Miller claims from 9228-6202 Quebec Inc. (nine claims) 

included a 2% net production return (NPR) that was later reduced to 1.5% with an 

exchange of 100,000 shares. The NPR is applicable to graphite production only and is 

not applicable to other extractions or productions (i.e. marble). This claimed land has 

been explored for potential graphite and marble values to date and hosts the major 

discoveries.  

Canada Carbon acquired five claims from Nouveau-Monde Mining Enterprises Inc. 

(Nouveau-Monde). Two Nouveau-Monde claims are currently pending due to exploration 

restrictions and will be transferred once the MERN allows it. Canada Carbon has also 

granted Nouveau-Monde a 2% NSR royalty which can be reduced at any time to 1% by 

paying $1,000,000 to Nouveau-Monde. 

Eight claims (4.8 km2) belonging to Caribou King were acquired. The later claims are 

subject to an existing 2% net of processed material returns royalty in favor of a third 

party, which can be reduced at any time to 1% by paying $1,000,000 to the royalty 

holder. The NSR is applicable to all mineral commodities, including marble.  Canada 

Carbon also entered into agreements with Marksman Geological Ltd. to purchase 14 

other claims.  The Project is not located on any of the claims acquired from Caribou King 

or Marksman Geological Ltd.  

Certain claims, designated in the claims list located in Appendix A, are limited by a fauna 

habitat conservation area and hydroelectric lines that pass through the Miller Property

(Figure 4.2). Other than those listed in the claims list (Appendix A), there are no other 

encumbrances on the Miller Property. 

4.4 RESTRICTIONS 

The Miller Property is located on private land and the surface right owners must be kept 

informed about upcoming exploration programs. Additionally, Canada Carbon must 

obtain their permission before initiating any exploration program. Canada Carbon has 

been meeting these requirements successfully to date and maintains an open and 

positive relationship with the land owners. 

Four land category status' can be found in the Grenville area (Figure 4.4). Certain 

restrictions may be imposed on exploration activities:  

 Large areas dedicated to resort and recreational activities ("territoire affecté à la 

villégiature") that are not available for map staking: land affected by those 

restrictions surrounds and limits the staking play.  

 Ecological reserves area where exploration is prohibited: two such reserves 

occupy small areas on the west side of the Rouge River.  

 Wildlife habitat areas in which activities are forbidden (with exceptions) to any 

activities that can modify a biological, physical or chemical component 

associated with the habitat (only applicable to public land): a large area of white-

tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) habitat overlaps the eastern part of the 

Miller Property. The restriction is however not applicable to the Project's 

exploration work because this particular area is on private land.

5.1 ACCESS 

5.1.1 MILLER PROPERTY 

The Property is well served by a public and private road network (Figure 5.1), owing to its 

proximity to Highway 50, Road 148, and the municipality of Grenville. The Property is 

accessible year-round by a network of maintained arterial and forest service roads, as 

well as unmaintained logging roads, skid trails, deactivated roads, and various other 

access roads. The Miller Property is accessible from Scotch Road connecting from 

Grenville town to McGillivray Lake, approximately 7 km away. From this public access, a 

private road leads westward for approximately half a kilometre and provides full access 

to the Miller deposit. During the winter season, vehicle access via the private road only 

requires a snow removal service, which is currently supplied by the land owner. 

5.1.2 ASBURY MINE SITE 

The site of the historic Asbury Mine was selected as the location of an eventual 

concentrate refining plant. The site is located approximately 150 km northwest of the 

Project via Highway 50 and Provincial Road 309 (Figure 5.1). 

Access to the site is easy, due to its location in developed areas of southern Quebec. 

From the nearby Notre-Dame-Du-Laus village, the Chemin du Serpent road passes south 

of the Property. From this point, the Chemin de la Mine, a four-wheel track trail allows 

access to the north part of the Property, up to the historical mine site infrastructure that 

Canada Carbon intends to use. During winter, site access via this dirt road may be 

conditional to the removal of snow by a private contractor. 

The author has not visited this site. 

5.2 CLIMATE 

Southern Quebec is characterized by a continental climate (Figure 5.2 and Table 5.1). 

The land is usually free of snow from May to November. The summer lasts from June to 

September with average temperatures from 15°C to 20°C. Precipitation in the summer 

months averages 106 mm per month with extreme events capable of dumping 80 mm of 

rain in a day. The soil is normally frost free for 140 consecutive days after May 12 on

average. As the autumn progresses, colder days are more frequent, and snow may start 

as early as late September. More commonly, snow only stays on the ground after mid-

November. Autumn is quite variable with abrupt shifts from almost summery conditions 

to frost and back in 48 hours. Winter is cold with very short daylight and temperatures 

reaching as cold as -40°C, but averaging -7°C from December to end of March. Snow 

may come in storms with up to 50 cm snowfalls. The spring months (April to June) see an 

increase in temperatures coinciding with the thaw, with average temperatures from 6°C 

to 13°C.

5.3 LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

5.3.1 MILLER PROPERTY 

A wide range of local resources are available in the town of Grenville and in the nearby 

cities of Hawkesbury (Ontario) or Lachute, located respectively 10 km south and 20 km 

east of the Property. Specific activities such as tree cutting, excavating, drilling, blasting, 

as well as other main services (emergency services, equipment maintenance shops, 

transport companies, mobile electricians, mobile mechanics, security firms, IT firms, 

engineering, environmental and geological consultants, restaurants and hotel rooms) are 

available near the Property. Transportation and housing are available nearby and the 

local skilled labor force would be able to support a mining operation. A power line crosses 

the southern part of the Property and a railroad passes through the Ottawa Valley near 

Grenville.

The Uniroc Quarry, which owns excavation equipment and operates in a syenite rock 

body, is also located on Scotch Road. Uniroc produces ballast, abrasives, high 

performance rock, crushed rock and manufactured sand. Four other quarries are located 

in the vicinity of the Miller Property. These quarries are operated using mobile equipment. 

Two limestone quarries are located on the Quebec and Ontario side of the Outaouais 

River. Canada Carbon has developed business partnerships with all of these quarries for 

equipment supply and expertise that were needed for the production of the bulk samples 

for its pilot plant program. Most of these quarries operate all year round and inclement 

weather does not stop their activities. 

5.3.2 ASBURY MINE SITE 

Local resources are available at the nearby cities of Notre-Dame-Du-Laus, Buckingham 

and Mont-Laurier, located respectively 11 km, 85 km, and 74 km from the site, along 

paved road.  Similar services to the Grenville town are available in Notre-Dame-Du-Laus.  

The graphite producer Imerys is located in Lac-Des-Iles in a neighbouring city and could 

provide additional technical help. 

5.4 PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.4.1 MILLER PROPERTY 

The Property is characterized by rolling to steep topographic relief consisting of smooth-

sided hills with altitudes ranging from 100 to 240 masl. It is primarily vegetated by leafy 

trees, which mainly consist of maple, birch and aspen, with a few firs that have been 

partly cleared or selectively logged and replanted. Small swamps and peat lands are 

scattered all over the flat areas, whereas steeper hillsides and ridge tops display large 

rock outcrops. Valley areas are largely covered by extensive glacial or fluvial deposits up 

to 4 m thick. The drainage is dominated by the south-flowing Rouge River that runs west 

of the Property, and by the Calumet River that passes immediately north of the former 

Miller Mine. Some small lakes are found within and in the neighbourhood of the Property 

(e.g., Ogilvy Lake). Hillsides and ridges displaying ice flow indicators are observed 

throughout the Property and provide good evidence for south-east ice flow in the last 

glacial event. 

5.4.2 ASBURY MINE SITE 

The Asbury plant area shows the result of previous historical production. Hills made of 

waste material are scattered in the area and a tailings pond is present; both partly 

control drainage of the rivers that flow towards the south. The elevation on the Property 

ranges between 259 and 320 masl.

6.0  H ISTORY  

6.1 MILLER PROPERTY 

The graphite occurrence on Lot 10 of Range V of the Grenville Township was described by 

Sir William Logan in 1845-1846, and mining operations were subsequently initiated by 

R.V. Harwood of Vaudreuil (Ells 1904; Cirkel 1907). This initial period of exploitation may 

be the first graphite operation in Canada (Ells 1904; Spence 1920). Following a 25-year 

period of inactivity, the site was operated again for a short period of time around 1870 as 

the Miller Mine (Cirkel 1907) and was taken over in 1889 by Messrs. Rae & Co. without 

extensive work (Spence 1920). The most important episode of mining apparently 

occurred from 1899 to 1900, as reported in Obalski 1900: 

Keystone Graphite Co.-This Company, composed of Americans, began last year to 

work on lot 10, range V of Grenville (county of Argenteuil) at a distance of 6 miles 

from Calumet station (C.P.R.). The deposit worked was formerly known under the 

name of the McVeity Mine. The graphite is found in a pretty pure state, in small 

veins or masses, in a crystalline rock. It is hand-picked on the spot and put in bags 

for shipment to the United States where it is treated and concentrated. The lots sent 

contain an average of 35 to 55 per cent of pure graphite and it is paid for according 

to the grade. Since the company has been working, about 25 carloads have been 

shipped; from 16 to 22 men have been employed throughout the year. The work 

consists of a cutting about thirty feet deep joining the main deposit where, it is 

stated, a thickness of 2½ feet of solid graphite has been found at times. The work is 

done by hand without the aid of machinery. The same company has done some 

other prospecting on a small scale. 

Later in his report, Obalski reported that a total of 388 short tons of raw graphite were 

produced in 1900 in Quebec, while other graphite companies were almost inactive 

(Obalski 1900, p. 15-16); suggesting that an important part of this total production was 

derived from the Miller operations. 

A database search for "McVeity" yielded several mentions of a prospector actively 

exploring for iron and mica in the late 1800s in the Ottawa region. One former phosphate 

mine near Gatineau (Quebec) also bears that same name and it is thus possible that an 

episode of activity at Miller took place under the name "McVeity". It is also reported that 

graphite was mined in 1900 on adjacent Lot 9 of the same range by the National 

Graphite Co. (Ells 1904) and further south, near the Pacific railroad station by the 

Calumet Graphite Co. (Obalski 1900; Ells 1904).

Figure 6.1 Mineralization Found in the Historic Miller Mine Wall 

 

The mine site area was claimed by Glen Blair (independent prospector) in late 1980s 

who performed limited ground geophysics and found a new occurrence of graphite on the 

southwest corner of Lot 10 as well as some graphite boulders, about 100 m to the east 

(Blair 1988, 1989). 

No previous work has ever been done on the Miller Property regarding quarrying marble 

for monument purposes or any other use. 

6.2 ASBURY MINE SITE 

Although this PEA only assesses the Asbury Property as the chosen location to build a 

treatment plant, historical exploration by various companies and subsequent resource 

evaluations lead to an historical production by Asbury Graphex from 1974 to 1988 on the 

Asbury Property. Open pit mining allowed the extraction of 875,000 t of graphite ore at a 

cut-off grade of 6%, on the current Asbury Property. After closing, the Asbury processing 

plant was leased to Stratmin Graphite Inc. The Municipality of Notre-Dame-Du-Laus now 

owns the land and processing plant.

7.0  G EOLOGICAL  SETTING A ND  
MINERALIZATION  

7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The Project area lies in the same locality where observations by Sir William Logan (1863) 

led to the recognition of the "Grenville Series", which was later extended and redefined 

as a geological province. 

The Grenville Province is recognized as a deeply exhumed Mesoproterozoic Himalayan-

type collision orogenic belt that extends over thousands of kilometres and is interpreted 

as a collage of gneissic terranes that were subjected to high-grade metamorphism 

(Martignole and Friedman 1998; Corriveau and van Breemen 2000; Corriveau et al. 

2007). High-grade metamorphic terrane stacking occurred along deep-level ductile shear 

zones and resulted in the main crustal build-up.  

The Project area is included in the south portion of the Morin Terrane (Figure 7.1), 

composed of supracrustal rocks, commonly at granulite metamorphic facies, and 

intruded by several bodies of granitic to anorthositic composition (1.14 Ga). The intrusive 

suite is grouped into the Morin Anorthosite-Mangerite-Charnockite-Granite (AMCG) Suite 

(Corriveau et al 1998), as depicted in Figure 7.1. To the west, the Morin Terrane is 

bounded by the Central Metasedimentary Belt along the Labelle deformation zone, which 

runs more or less north-south (Martignole et al. 2000). The Morin Terrane is bounded to 

the south along a major normal fault by the St Lawrence Lowlands, which constitutes a 

younger (early Paleozoic to the end of the Ordovician) geological province. 

7.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY 

The southern portion of the Grenville Township was mapped by Philpotts (1961) who 

detailed the folded sequence of quartzo-feldspathic gneiss, quartzite and crystalline 

limestone (marble); this sequence is characteristic of the Grenville Series from Logan 

(1863).  

The well-banded quartzo-feldspathic gneisses were divided into two groups on the basis 

of whether they contain biotite or pyroxene, which rarely occur together in the area. 

Philpotts determined that gneisses are not the dominant lithology, occurring as remnants 

between the various intrusives of the Morin Series, which includes gabbro, monzonite, 

mangerite, granite and syenite. Quartzites were documented as very massive, well 

jointed, white or pinkish rocks. Crystalline limestone appeared to correspond to two large 

beds (Figure 7.2).

Microscope examination of the marble unit revealed twinned calcite, sphene, zircon, 

diopside, serpentine (after olivine), graphite, quartz, microcline and grossularite. 

Wollastonite was only noted near igneous contacts. Various pegmatite units were 

observed and seem to be affected by scapolite alteration of feldspar where they intrude 

crystalline limestone. Finally, Philpotts also noted younger diabase and lamprophyre 

dykes cutting through all units. 

Graphite is observed as dissemination and pods/veins in the marble, skarn and 

paragneiss units of the property (Figure 7.2), several pods and veins have been identified 

and explored by Canada Carbon and are named with the VN prefix (Figure 7.2). Each of 

these showings are described in greater details in Section 9.2 of this report.

7.2.1 MARBLES 

The protolith of the marbles are interpreted to be sandy limestones, with variable 

amounts of organic matter (which might be the origins of graphite and sulfides observed 

on the Property). Canada Carbon's interpretation is that the limestone might have 

reacted with quartz grains within the unit during metamorphism to form marble and calc-

silicate dominated rocks. The presence of sand in the marble might have allowed the 

following reaction: CaCO3 + SiO2 = CaSiO2 + CO2. Presence of contaminants (clay) within 

the limestone unit could have provided lead, magnesium, sodium, aluminum, and other 

elements. 

The white marbles are medium to coarse grained (1 to 10 mm) and are white to silver-

grey (Figure 7.3). Surface alteration has affected the marble for a depth of a few 

centimeters to half meter, creating a yellowish color and friable layer, which turns easily 

into sand. Disseminated coarse graphite (about 0.5% in abundance and 1 to 5 mm in 

size) is present in most of the marble unit. Accessory minerals include apatite (blue or 

green), chodrodite and diopside (Figure 7.3). 

Enclaves are sometime present in the marble (referred to as "dead snakes"; Figure 7.3). 

They were interpreted by Canada Carbon as skarn layers (quartz-rich horizon or pods in 

the marble that reacted to create calc-silicates dominated rocks) or skarn shear-zones 

(units created by the reaction between the marble and fluids brought by shear zones) 

that were folded and twisted by subsequent convection. The dead snakes are often seen 

near skarn horizons and they have a similar mineralogical and geochemical composition. 

Enclaves often contain sulfide and graphite, reaching up to 5% graphitic carbon and/or 

sulfur. The dead snakes range in size from 5 to 25 cm, yet they can reach up to 10 m in 

length. However, the dead snakes could also represent deformed, partially melted 

interbeds of detritical rocks (sandstone and clay rich sedimentary rocks) in the initial 

carbonate sequence (Figure 7.3), typical of a marine to continental shelf environment. 

These interbeds are better preserved at the Property (Figure 7.3). 

Silicified marbles are also observed and are fine to medium grained (1 to 5 mm), with a 

white to yellowish color. Slight to intensive silicification of the rock is present. Silicified 

marbles present a very gradual alteration (rarely sharp contacts). This unit contains little 

to no graphite or sulfides and is much harder than regular marble units. 

7.2.2 SKARNS 

Skarns represent the main alteration product of the marble unit. Possible small-scale 

zoning has been identified, but no large-scale zoning was observed so far. Light chlorite-

epidote alteration areas are also observed within the skarn units. The skarn units present 

many variations in texture, varying in size, content and spatial relationships with other 

lithologies (Figure 7.3). 

Coarse skarns comprise 1 to 25 cm or larger grains. They are primarily composed of 

quartz and feldspar, with frequent wollastonite pods (5 to 15 cm), pyroxene (up to 25 

cm), titanite (up to 5 cm), zircon (1 to 100 mm) and chondrodite. The coarse skarns form

long, thin zones (meter-long, 10 cm in width) inside white fine skarn units. No sulfides are 

observed in this unit. Grey skarns are fine grained (less than 3 mm) and form salt-and-

pepper looking rocks. They contain quartz, feldspar and pyroxene with little to no 

accessory minerals (titanite, zircon). Sulfides are often present (less than 1%) in this unit. 

Green skarns are fine to medium grained (1 to 5 mm). More than 50% of the mineral 

content of this rock unit is composed of pyroxene (anhedral diopside), with small 

amounts of quartz, feldspar and sulfides. The interpreted protolith might have contained 

the exact amount of limestone and sand to create a complete reaction and modification 

of the unit to massive diospide. Pink skarns are fine grained (less than 1 mm) and mainly 

comprise pink feldspar and quartz. They are often present in banded graphite formations. 

7.2.3 PARAGNEISS 

The phlogopite paragneiss comprises significant amounts of phlogopite that can reach up 

to 15 cm or more in size. The phlogopite paragneiss has been historically exploited for 

micas. The paragneiss itself is fine grained (1 to 2 mm) with variable amounts of 

feldspar, quartz and other mafic minerals (pyroxene, amphiboles, biotite, etc.). The 

paragneiss ranges from dark brown to black in color (Figure 7.3). The protolith is 

interpreted to be composed of metamorphosed claystone and siltstone deposited in a 

shallow environment. White paragneiss is a quartz-feldspar rich gneiss, often partially 

melted, extruding large quartz-rich veins. The quasi absence of mafic minerals results in 

a white-to-grey colored gneiss. 

7.2.4 META-ARKOSE 

Meta-arkose units are composed of red-orange rocks that seem to be composed of fused 

grains of sand (Figure 7.3). Magnetite crystals are locally observed within the meta-

arkose. Pegmatite veins formed by partial fusion of this unit are observed. The protolith is 

interpreted to be sandstone comprising quartz and potassic feldspar (hence the meta-

arkose name). 

7.2.5 DYKES 

Large lamprophyre dykes (20 to 150 cm) are observed on the Property, oriented 

northwest-southeast and sometime with east-west offshoots. The dykes often cut through 

the mineralization and other lithologies. The dykes are sometimes kinked and/or foliated.   

Coarse diabase dykes appear to be composed of large feldspar crystals in an aphanitic 

mafic matrix (Figure 7.3). Sulphides are locally present in filled fractures. Fine diabase 

dykes are dark-green to green, composed of a mafic aphanitic matrix. Quartz-filled 

vacuoles are sometime observed near the center of the dykes. Sulfides are sometimes 

present as fracture filling material. Yellow diabase dykes form khaki to yellow-green 

aphanitic units. Evidences of numerous intrusive pulses are observed; including layers of 

different colors near the borders. Sulphides have never been observed in the yellow 

dykes.

7.2.6 BRECCIA 

Hematized breccias have been found near the Du Calumet River. The breccias are mostly 

composed of iron-manganese carbonates, with the presence of large pyrites and fluorine 

crystals (Figure 7.3). 

7.2.7 PEGMATITE 

Conventional pegmatites are rarely observed in the Project area. The only pegmatites 

might have been observed at VN7 and form 10 to 50 cm wide by 0.5 to 5 m long 

intrusive bodies (Figure 7.3). The origin of these bodies is interpreted to be local fusion of 

rocks, producing large pinkish feldspar, in a quartz-feldspar matrix. Zoned tourmaline has 

been identified and confirmed by geochemical analysis. The pegmatites are heavily 

folded and dismembered.

7.3 MINERALIZATION 

Graphite has been found as disseminations in marble, in sulphide-bearing paragneiss, in 

pods and veins on the Property. In known occurrences, graphite can be alone or in 

association with other minerals, including pyroxene, scapolite, titanite, zircon and 

wollastonite (Spence 1920). Through trenching, Canada Carbon has identified many 

examples of graphite mineralization associated with marble and detritical rock 

sequences. Numerous variations of the graphite mineralization are observed within the 

Project area. Graphite primarily occurs in well crystallized euhedral flakes.  

7.3.1 GRAPHITE MINERALIZATION 

WOLLASTONITE PODS 

Wollastonite-graphite mineralization is a frequent association on the Property. This 

mineralization form often appears in small pods of tens of centimeters in diameter and 

can reach up to 1.6 m in thickness at the VN1 showing. Both wollastonite and graphite 

form well crystallized minerals (Figure 7.4) and graphite assays around 15% in these 

pods. On the VN2 showing, wollastonite appears as a nucleus around which the graphite 

appears to accumulate. 

BANDED GRAPHITE FORMATION 

Banded graphite formations are thin (1 to 5 mm) bands of graphite sandwiched between 

thin (1 to 10 mm) layers of graphite-quartz-feldspar, stacked closely, and reaching 

thicknesses of many metres (Figure 7.4). The grain sizes of this mineralization type are 

small (less than or equal to 1 mm). The banded formations are continuous over long 

distances (10 m and longer) and affected by intense folding.  The average graphite 

content of this unit is between 5 and 10%. 

GRAPHITE PODS (MARBLE) 

Small pods (tens of centimetres long to a couple of centimetres wide) of pure graphite 

are often present in the white marble units (Figure 7.4). Pods of metric scales are also 

present on the VN2 and VN3 showings.  The graphite grains are coarse (5 to 50 mm) and 

form euhedral flakes. Many of the pods are observed along an east-west alignment 

direction. 

DISSEMINATED GRAPHITE (MARBLE) 

In all the marble units observed, graphite occurs frequently in well crystallized, euhedral, 

small (1 to 5 mm) disseminated crystals (Figure 7.4). The chemical reaction between 

carbonate and silica might have produced calc-silicates and graphite, which seems to 

precipitate at the boundary of the calc-silicate and marble grains. The average graphite 

content in the marble is approximately 0.5% graphite.

for the Miller Graphite and Marble Project, 

Grenville Township, Quebec, Canada 

  

 

DISSEMINATED GRAPHITE (SKARN) 

Similar to disseminated graphite in marble, disseminated graphite in skarn occurs almost 

everywhere, more frequently close to marble units (Figure 7.4). In skarn units farther 

from marble units, sulfides are more abundant. Graphite in skarn units is often found in 

clumps instead of flakes and is far less homogenously distributed than in the marble 

units. 

GRAPHITE VEINS 

Graphite veins seem to follow shear or fault zones, which might be evidence of structural 

control of metamorphic hydrothermal fluids (Figure 7.4). They are thin, centimeter-wide, 

sheets of aphanitic graphite that can cover many square metres. Directions of movement 

of faults are registered in the graphite veins as strikes and kinks. No general directions 

have been observed, as they are often following folded structures.

7.3.2 MARBLE 

The medium to coarse grained white marbles on the Property has demonstrated its visual 

quality for architectural stone (Figure 7.5). The suitable white color marbles are overlain 

by a 1 to 4 m-thick surface alteration that creates a yellowish color and friable layer, 

which is unsuitable for production. Disseminated graphite (less than 0.5% in abundance) 

and other accessory minerals include apatite (blue or green), chodrodite and diopside, 

which give an interesting color for the architectural stone market.

8.0  D EP OSIT  TYPE  

8.1 GRAPHITE 

Canada Carbon is actively exploring for metamorphic-hosted vein-type and disseminated 

graphite deposits, long known to occur in the Outaouais region of southern Quebec 

(Cirkel 1907; Simandl and Kenan 1997). Other typical examples, mostly in granulite 

terrains, are found in Sri-Lanka (Weis et al. 1981, Glassley 1982, Katz87), south India 

(Radhika et al. 1995, Baiju et al. 2005) and Spain (Rodas et al. 2000), among others.  

Generally, graphite occurrences can be grouped into two categories: 1) syngenetic; which 

are derived from carbonaceous matter in host rocks and 2) epigenetic; which originates 

from precipitation of solid carbon derived from carbonic content in fluids (mainly carbon 

dioxide and methane). The latter form of deposit is less common in nature, but 

represents the more interesting of the two from an economical perspective (Rodas et al. 

2000). 

The Project represents an example of a granulite-hosted, high temperature graphite 

deposit, which could be paralleled to the Sierra de Aracena metamorphic belt described 

by Rodas et al. (2000), where the same type of graphite occurrences are found: I) 

stratiform graphite associated with gneiss and quartzite interbedded with calc-silicate 

series; II) disseminated graphite; III) graphite associated with anatectic tonalities and 

their restitic enclaves and IV) graphite veins. Graphite in all types of occurrences shows 

high crystallinity as revealed by the x-ray diffraction (XRD) study and thermal properties 

(Rodas et al. 2000). 

Within the Outaouais region of Quebec (Tremblay and Cummings 1987), and particularly 

at the Miller deposit (Ells 1904, Spence 1920), the mineralogical association of graphite 

and calc-silicate rocks suggests a proximal source of carbon-rich fluids generated by 

silicification of nearby carbonate-rich rocks. Many studies have recognized that 

metasomatism, or more specifically skarnification, is efficient at producing carbon-rich 

fluids through the following reaction (Rodas et al. 2000; Pope 2004): 

carbonate + silica => calc-silicate + carbon dioxide 

The geological sequences at the Miller deposit and the geological setting also suggest 

the presence of a continental margin type environment, which has been affected by high-

grade metamorphism. Detritic sedimentary sequences; comprising meta-arkoses and 

gneiss rocks are interbedded with marble sequences, presenting restites; deformed and 

dismembered enclaves.

8.1.1 DISSEMINATED GRAPHITE 

Disseminated graphite in carbonate sequences (marble) could be explained by both 

syngenetic and possible epigenetic processes. The presence of small amounts of organic 

matter in the marble protolith could explain the formation of disseminated graphite in 

this sequence. However, local skarnification and metasomatic reactions could have 

produced carbon-rich fluids which percolated through the marble, hence depositing 

graphite in the grain interstices. 

8.1.2 BANDED GRAPHITE 

Graphite is also observed as banded flakes within gneiss sequences, which have resulted 

from the metamorphic transformation of organic matter within detritic sequences 

composed of lidites, sandstones and clay sediments rich in organic matter, within a 

carbonate sequence.  

8.1.3 GRAPHITE PODS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTITES 

Some graphite pods are observed in close association with paragneiss enclaves within a 

carbonate sequence. The anatectic paragneiss show typical igneous textures and include 

quartz, alkaline feldspar, plagioclase, biotite, sillimanite, cordierite and a variety of 

accessory minerals, such as muscovite, zircon, apatite and rutile. The graphite deposition 

is interpreted to be associated with the partial melting of organic matter rich clay 

sediments interbedded with limestone. High-grade metamorphism caused partial melting 

of the rock sequences and partial remobilization of the organic matter to graphite pods. 

8.1.4 VEIN-TYPE GRAPHITE 

Graphite vein deposits are interpreted to have originated from the remobilization of 

carbon as carbon dioxide and methane in metamorphic fluids at the base of the crust or 

deeper within the mantle (Glassley 1982, Katz 1987, Skippen and Marshall 1991, 

Simandl and Kenan 1997). The fluids are channelled upward along major fractures 

where deposition as graphite is triggered by chemical changes in the fluids in response to 

cooling and dewatering (Luque et al. 2013). Fluid transport and graphite deposition imply 

that structures played a major role in the location and shape of the resulting deposit. The 

precipitation of carbon in veins takes place at high temperatures, from 700 to 800°C, 

which favor the formation of large and well crystallized graphite flakes. Graphite veins are 

characterized by coarse flakes with a high degree of crystallinity, which is suitable for new 

technological applications (Luque et al. 2013). 

8.2 MARBLE ARCHITECTURAL STONE 

The transformation of limestone to marble by high-grade metamorphism results in a 

crystalline calcite dominated rock with variable amounts of accessory minerals, 

depending on the quantity of heterogeneities in the protolith.

Marbles offer different colors and texture with variable amounts of veining and fractures. 

In the case of the Miller Property, the marble sought by potential buyers is white in color 

with as few fractures as possible.

9.0  EX P LORATION  

Since the acquisition of the Miller Property in 2013, Canada Carbon has discovered 

multiple new graphite mineralization showings; including nine surface graphite showings 

of high-grade, and large, lower-grade dissemination of graphite in marble and skarn units.  

Induced polarization (IP) surveys indicate that multiple anomalies are located along the 

trends of the current area subject to exploration, most of which were drilled in 2014 and 

2015. The geophysical anomalies are open on strike at both extremities and regional 

airborne geophysics revealed additional targets elsewhere on the Miller Property. 

9.1 INITIAL PROSPECTING WORK 

After acquiring the Miller Property in February 2013, Canada Carbon hired SL Exploration 

Inc. to perform prospecting work. The objective was to locate the old mine site and 

proceed with an initial assessment of the Miller Property's accessibility and the historical 

mineralization. The field crew located the mine site approximately 150 m north of the 

position reported in the MERN database. Field observations in the old mine pit revealed 

that graphite veins occur in a marble unit near skarn and paragneiss rocks. The larger 

graphite veins appear to have been at least partially mined in the past and its orientation 

corresponds to the mine pit's north-south orientation. 

Canada Carbon carried out initial prospecting in 2013 to verify historical data and a later 

prospecting phase to verify ground (MaxMin, very-low frequency (VLF), IP, ground time-

domain electromagnetics (TDEM)) and airborne (TDEM) geophysical anomalies. The 

geophysical surveys were performed by different geophysics companies. Following the 

prospecting phase on the known anomalies, Canada Carbon proceeded to trench the 

ground anomalies and test some of them by performing drilling campaigns. Trenching 

and drilling on a coincident IP – IMAGEM anomaly (in 2013) detected two graphite veins 

(named VN1 and VN2) along a contact zone. The main focus of Canada Carbon's 

exploration work then became the investigation of these showings and the contact zone. 

The objective of the follow-up prospecting work in March and April 2013 was to obtain 

samples from the graphite veins for metallurgical testing (Section 13.0) and to better 

characterize the grade of the vein material. The melted snow cover allowed additional 

geological mapping in the mine pit and structural measurements were also taken. Veins 

exposed in the east part of the mine pit were sampled.

9.2 GEOPHYSICS 

9.2.1 GROUND ELECTROMAGNETIC (2013) 

Géosig Inc. of Quebec City was contracted to perform a ground electromagnetic (EM) 

survey to test the immediate area of the historical mine pit using various methods, 

including Max-Min, IMAGEM, IP and Beep Mat. The objective of this work phase was to 

test the ability of the different methods to detect graphite veins (Simoneau and Boivin 

2013). The methods were locally tested over a 500- by 400-m grid consisting of eleven 

east-west lines spaced 50 m apart, centered over the Miller pit. The various surveys were 

carried out during the last two weeks of May 2013 by various teams of two to three 

people including experienced geophysicists, one of which was the creator of the IMAGEM 

detector.  

This initial orientation study revealed several small anomalies, most of them overlapping 

two or more of the applied EM methods. The Max-Min only returned weak anomalies 

since this method typically targets deep-seated conductors. The IMAGEM method 

detected near-surface anomalies that where followed-up by Beep Mat surveys, allowing 

individual graphite veins to be pinpointed and exposed after removing the thin cover of 

glacial till. The most significant results from this initial EM survey is a series of anomalies 

located about 200 m west of the pit where subsequent mechanical trenching revealed 

new graphite occurrences (VN-1 and VN-2), as detailed in Section 9.4.1. 

9.2.2 AIRBORNE VERSATILE TIME-DOMAIN ELECTROMAGNETIC SURVEY (2013) 

In the spring of 2013, Canada Carbon commissioned Geotech Ltd. of Aurora, Ontario to 

complete a helicopter-borne versatile time-domain electromagnetic survey (VTEM Plus) 

and a Horizontal Magnetic Gradiometer (HGrad) geophysical survey over the two claim 

blocks of the Miller Property. The survey was flown on June 13, 2013 over an area of 25 

km², yielding a total of 336 line-km of geophysical data. Positioning was provided by a 

global positioning system (GPS) navigation and radar altimeter. The survey lines were 

oriented northeast-southwest and generally spaced 100 m apart, with a tighter spacing 

of 50 m in the central part of the East Block over the areas of historical mining and 

recent graphite discoveries. The survey lines were flown with an AStar 350 B3 helicopter 

at an elevation of 91 m above ground at an average speed of 80 km per hour, producing 

an average terrain clearance of 60 m for the EM bird and a magnetic sensor clearance of 

67 m.  

Following the interpretation work, Geotech identified six conductors (three on the East 

Block and three on the West Block) based mainly on the Tau decay parameter evaluated 

from time domain EM data and vertical magnetic gradient contours (Figure 9.1 and 

Canada Carbon press releases of September 12 and October 8, 2013). All anomalies 

were later subjected to detailed modelling to determine the orientation and depth of the 

associated conductors (see Canada Carbon press release of November 14, 2013).  

The East Block contains three major anomalies, E1 to E3. Anomaly E1 is located 800 m 

north of the mine pit, with an approximate diameter of 400 m; E2 is 280 m southeast of

the mine pit and 150 m south of Trench #3; E3 is located 545 m southeast of the Miller 

pit (Figure 9.1). Anomalies E1 and E3 and the north part of E2 are on land covered by 

Canada Carbon's access agreement for exploration work. Based on the modelling work, 

anomalies E1 and E2 occur at depths of 100 m and 80 to 100 m, respectively. 

Anomalies E1 and E2 occur in marble units that are known to contain graphite elsewhere 

on the Miller Property. Magnetic maps show that E1 is located at the contact of two 

magnetic anomalies which may correspond to the contact between two geological units, 

suggesting a potentially similar context to that of the Miller mineralization.  

Figure 9.1 Miller Property Airborne TDEM Anomaly Map 

 

9.2.3 IMAGEM SURVEY (2013) 

In September 2013, Géosig was contracted to perform a second IMAGEM survey in the 

vicinity of Trench #3. The detailed mobile TDEM geophysical survey was completed from 

September 18 to 22, 2013, to investigate in greater detail the previously identified EM 

anomalies associated with graphite occurrences. The survey operators could not follow

the grid lines due to the presence of the trench, and instead followed a meandering path 

that was precisely recorded by a GPS unit integrated with the IMAGEM detector. This 

provided complete coverage of the planned area (300 by 150 m) with an irregular 

spacing of 50 to 200 m. This method increased the density of readings near positive 

responses, resulting in a better definition of the anomalies. A total of 9.55 line-km were 

completed with an average spacing of 20 readings per metre. The survey was successful 

in delineating well-defined anomalies over the known graphite occurrence and revealed 

new anomalies that required further investigation (Figure 9.2). Although under 

development, the IMAGEM method appears very promising for the detection of near-

surface conductors and seems particularly efficient for graphite vein mineralization. 

Figure 9.2 IMAGEM Anomalies Map 

 

9.2.4 PHISPY SURVEY (2013) 

Following the second drilling campaign and the trenching of the VN3 showing, a PhiSpy 

survey was performed in December 2013 and March 2014 over the vicinity of the VN3 

showing, the E3 anomaly, the mine pit and the Trench #3 area. The PhiSpy system is a 

versatile exploration tool similar to the IMAGEM method used in the past by Géosig. 

During the survey, shallow anomalies can then be dug out, investigated, and sampled 

immediately. Unlike small EM devices such as the Beep Mat, which are usually limited to 

an investigation depth of about 1 m, PhiSpy can reach much deeper conductors and 

records full TDEM decay curves that can be post-processed and analyzed to retrieve 

information about the conductance and geometry of the conductors. Paper letter and 

map reports on the PhiSpy work have been produced by the contractor.  

The PhiSpy survey performed between December and March 2013 revealed 14 

anomalies of varying size. Beep Mat prospecting was carried out on each anomaly. Five

anomalies of significant size were detected. Two of the anomalies are related to the VN1 

and VN2 showings, while another corresponds to the target of the third drill program 

(Section 10.3) that revealed two graphitic horizons. The results of the survey on Trench 

#3 detected the southern and eastern extensions to the VN1 and VN2 showings. 

9.2.5 PHISPY SURVEY E1 (2014) 

In May 2014, a 320 by 320-m geophysics survey was completed over priority target E1, 

which had been identified by aerial geophysics (VTEM) conducted in 2013. The ground 

EM survey consisted of a PhiSpy grid with a line spacing of 20 m. This target is located 

900 m north of the Miller Mine pit.  The area surveyed is centered over a 180 m by 100 

m strongly conductive VTEM anomaly that lies at the heart of the 400 m (radius) E1 VTEM 

target previously reported. The EM PhiSpy resulted in the identification of seven 

anomalies, ranging in size from a few meters up to 25 m. The near-surface anomalies are 

primarily located on the southwest part of the grid, whereas the structural features and 

airborne anomalies are located toward the northeast part of the grid (Figure 9.3).  

A portable ground TDEM PhiSpy survey was performed on November 26th, 2014. Given 

the sparse forest in the area, it was possible to carry out this survey through the bush 

with no need for a network of lines to be cut. On the day of, a total of 5.6 km of PhiSpy 

data was acquired. This PhiSpy data was combined with previous PhiSpy data to provide 

a more robust geophysical interpretation (Figure 9.3).  

The survey results show interpreted models of conductivity and chargeability. A total of 

28 ground TDEM anomalies located in close proximity to the interpreted structural 

features were identified, 7 of which are of particular interest (EM-1; EM-3; EM-7; EM-8; 

EM-9; EM-25; EM-26). The others (EM-2; EM-12; EM-13; EM-14; EM-20 and EM-19) are 

respectively VN3, VN6, VN5, VN4, VN1 and VN2. Anomalies EM-5; EM-6; EM-21; EM-22 

and EM-23 are onto historic pit or stockpiles. Trenching over EM-10, EM-11, EM-15, EM-

16, EM-17, EM-18, and EM-24 revealed no visible graphite veins. Anomalies EM-4; EM-

27 and EM-28 are in swamp areas and could not be accessed. The eight interesting 

anomalies revealed either veins of graphite tens of centimeters thick (EM-3; EM-7; EM-8; 

EM-9; EM-25, EM-26) or metric pods of graphite (EM-1).

9.2.6 IP SURVEY (2014-2015) 

A resistivity and IP survey was performed in two different phases. A first phase was 

performed from September 4 to 7, 2014, over the southern part of the area, and a 

second phase aimed at covering the northern extensions of several open anomalies 

occurred from May 3 to 5, 2015. The E3 south grid consists of 14 lines varying from 225 

to 475 m in length, for a total of 4.725 km, and the E3 north grid consists of 5 lines of 

750 m, for a total of 3.75 km.  

The southern IP survey consisted of 14 lines, oriented in a southwest-northeast direction 

that covered an area of 650 m by 450 m. To fit to the Miller Property, the line lengths 

varied from 225 m to 475 m long, for a total of 4,725 m. The spacing between the grid 

lines was 50 m and the distance between pole and dipole was 12.5 m to obtain optimal 

resolution and depth of penetration. A total of 20 IP anomalies located in close proximity 

to the interpreted structural features were identified, 8 of which are of particular interest 

(E3-1; E3-2; E3-9; E3-10; E3-24; E3-25; E3-21 and E3-22; figure 9.4). They all intersect 

known showings (VN1 to VN9) and seem to follow large conductors. 

The northern IP survey consisted of four 480 m lines oriented in a southwest-northeast 

direction that covered an area of 500 m by 150 m. The spacing between the grid lines 

was 50 m and the distance between pole and dipole was 12.5 m to obtain optimal 

resolution and depth of penetration. The survey results show interpreted models of 

conductivity and chargeability. A total of eight IP anomalies located in close proximity to 

the interpreted structural features were identified, four of which are of particular interest 

(E1-4, E1-6, E1-7 and E1-8; Figure 9.5). Anomaly E1-4 is centered over the airborne 

VTEM anomaly, suggesting that its source could be common to both anomalies. Both the 

VTEM and the IP anomaly are located within a marble unit which is of interest since both 

the historic Miller Mine and the VN3 showing are hosted in marble. This anomaly 

connects at depth, with other anomalies present, and extends the width of the entire grid 

(150 m) in a northwest-southeast direction. Initial trenching has revealed graphite veins 

in the exposed bedrock surface. Anomaly E1-6 seems to come close to surface on line 

L150 (Figure 9.5). This anomaly lies on the contact between marble and paragneiss 

units. It follows the structural feature over the width of the whole grid (150 m). Both 

anomaly E1-7 and E1-8 are located in paragneiss outcrops, where graphite exposures 

were observed (Figure 9.5). Anomaly E1-7 is strong on lines L0 and L100, and seems to 

be sub-cropping on line 100, but appears to lie at a greater depth on line L0. Anomaly E1-

8 is also of interest, but is only poorly defined since it is at the edge of the surveyed grid 

and its size remains undefined (Figure 9.5).

9.3 PROSPECTING AND TRENCHING 

Based on the IP, IMAGEM, Max-Min and other results provided by the geophysics surveys, 

Canada Carbon trenched every exploration anomaly to expose the bedrock. Additional 

ground EM surveying and trenching led to the identification of eight high-interest 

showings (VN1 to VN9, skipping VN5); Figure 9.6, Figure 9.7, and Figure 9.8. 

Although few outcrops are found on the Miller Property, numerous graphite 

mineralization examples were uncovered during prospecting phases. Numerous closely-

spaced graphite veins ranging in width from several centimetres to tens of centimetres 

were discovered under the overburden. Some veins occur at the marble-paragneiss 

contact, in an identical geological context to that of the Miller Mine site and trench area. 

Several exploration pits were also located, with graphite-bearing blocks adjacent to them, 

apparently sourced from the pits. Figure 9.7 shows the location of trenches completed 

since 2014. Occasionally, the trench did not reach bedrock and therefore no 

observations could be made.  Some anomalies also remain unexplained and require 

additional investigation.

Figure 9.8 Example of a Striped Area with Banded Mineralization at VN6 

 

9.3.1 VN1-2 

Trenching on the combined IMAGEM, Beep-Mat and IP-1 anomalies in 2013 yielded 

some of the most interesting mineralization on the Miller Property. Graphite vein 

mineralization was exposed by mechanical stripping; revealing two high-grade showings 

(VN1 and VN2) located 200 m west of the Miller Mine pit. One of the two smaller initial 

trenches was extended to reveal the bedrock between the VN2 and the VN1 showings.  

Subsequent trenching exposed the contact between marble and a paragneiss unit in the 

northeast part of the trench and between marble and a banded marble-paragneiss unit in 

the central and southeast parts. Coarse-grained skarns mark the contact and are 

spatially associated with mineralization: wide graphite veins and metre-scale graphite-

wollastonite pods. The distinction between marble and skarn was based on diopside 

content. The marble displays variable degrees of silicification, increasing in intensity 

closer to the coarse skarn, to the point where marble at the contact forms a zone of 

"quartzite". In the banded marble-paragneiss unit, the marble is visibly altered whereas 

the paragneiss does not show signs of alteration at the macroscopic scale. The 

paragneiss unit at the northeast end of the trench also does not show visible signs of 

alteration.  

A diabase dyke cuts across the other rock units. The diabase dyke is locally cut by 

graphite-filled faults. Coarse skarn completely fills the contact zone in the northeast part.

The contact zone in the southeast part displays intense alteration and could not be 

described in detail because it corresponds to a depression filled with soil and calcite 

grains resulting from surface weathering.  

Other metre-scale pods of graphite were also found scattered in the marble unit away 

from any contact. 

The VN1 showing is characterized by an irregular vein of semi-massive coarse graphite. 

The graphite vein is exposed along a strike length of 12.8 m, oriented northeast-

southeast (148°) with a sub-vertical dip. From southeast to northwest, the vein ranges in 

width from 1 m to 1.7 m over a distance of 7.9 m, and of that length, the vein maintains 

a width of 1.6 m over 2.5 m. Toward the northwest, the vein is truncated where it 

encounters a 1.2 m zone of more competent host rocks. The width of the vein on the 

other side of the competent zone ranges from 10 cm to 1 m over a strike length of 3.7 m. 

Smaller graphite veins can be observed on both sides of the main vein, on available 

exposures. Finer grained graphite is locally present in the surrounding carbonate host 

rocks. The VN1 showing was covered by 1 to 3 m of glacial till. 

Semi-massive coarse-grained graphite occurs within a coarse skarn-mineral envelope, 

which includes large crystals of white feldspar, diopside and wollastonite. Local geology 

consists of a complex intermixing of banded paragneiss and medium-grained carbonate 

rock (historically referred to as a marble unit), where contorted fragments of gneiss 

appear to float within an equigranular carbonate matrix. 

The VN2 showing is characterized by a massive graphite vein up to 1.5 m thick that can 

be followed for more than 3 m at surface, several graphite pods, and multiple secondary 

graphite veins. The high-grade graphite veins and pods are aligned northweast-southwest 

and follow the contact between marble and paragneiss. 

From the southern border of the trench, the contact can be followed at surface for more 

than 50 m and becomes folded toward the east. At depth, the mineralized contact was 

encountered 39.3 m below the VN2 showing. 

9.3.2 VN3 

A make-shift trench was excavated at the VN3 showing in the southern area of the Miller 

Property, close to a targeted VTEM anomaly. The showing was discovered when a vein 

was exposed while moving the rig to the E3 drill site during the second drilling campaign. 

The bedrock was subsequently stripped to reveal a vein over 2 m wide that could be 

followed along strike for 5 m before pinching out.  

9.3.3 VN4 

The VN4 showing was exposed 120 m north of VN3 at PhiSpy anomalies EM-13 and EM-

14. Excavation led to the discovery of two mineralized zones a few metres away from a 

contact between the marble and skarn. A sub-vertical diabase dyke is visible at the 

southern part of the outcrop, striking west at 80°.

The mineralization consists of two pods of coarse grained graphite. The first pod is about 

1.5 m in size and is oriented northwest-southeast. It is a mix of amphibole, wollastonite, 

graphite and re-crystallized calcite, encased in the highly altered marble. Channel 

samples 61501 to 61504 are surface grabs that include material from both 

mineralization and host rock.  

The second pod is located 3 m south and 2 m lower (topographically) and is 0.50 m in 

size. It is composed of coarse graphite in fine grained grey skarn.  

9.3.4 VN6 

The VN6 showing was exposed 120 m north-northwest of VN3 and 60m west of VN4, at 

PhiSpy anomalies EM-12. Trenching on VN6 has uncovered marble and graphite-rich 

skarn bands with widths over 7 m, which can be followed in the newly exposed bedrock 

surfaces for over 40 m (Figure 9.9). Similar mineralization is found in the VN6 Extension 

trench located 45 m along strike, suggesting that the skarn unit is continuous for at least 

90 m (Figure 9.9).  

The VN6 showing is characterized by a 2-m-large, 30-m-long sheet mineralized horizon. 

Similarl to a banded-iron formation, the sheet is layered graphite in a pyroxene-

wollastonite-feldspar matrix (skarn). The surface expression of the mineralized layer is 

kinked and folds toward the northeast. Interpretations of drill core logs indicate a 

westward dip at a low angle. The mineralization is at a contact between the marble and 

skarn (Figure 9.9). Mineralization consists of coarse grained graphite, from 1 mm to 

10 mm in size.  

At the northeast end of the outcrop is a diabase dyke, 50 cm wide, oriented 80° west 

(Figure 9.9). The projection of the dyke strike and dip is concordant with the dyke near 

VN4. Small kinks at the wall seem to indicate post-intrusion constraints. 

At the southeast end is an important fault that cross-cuts the mineralization (Figure 9.9). 

The orientation is N090° similar to many other structures on the Miller Property. The 

displacement is not well known, the VN4 showing or an old pit tens of metres away could 

both be candidates of the extension.  

Channel samples are surface grabs that include material from both mineralization and 

host rock. Graphite content varies from 0.3 to 19.8%. Results are summarized in Table 

9.2.

9.3.5 VN7 

The VN7 showing was exposed at the southeast tip of the right arm of the Miller Mine. 

The showing is located at conductive and chargeable anomalies E3-21 and E3-22. 

Excavation led to the discovery of a 2 by 5-m-large mineralized horizon. The showing is a 

superposition of graphite and skarn layers, each of varying thicknesses (from 0.5 cm to 

tens of centimetres). The mineralization is at a contact between vertical layers of marble 

and skarns. The horizons are layered graphite in an amphibole-diopside-feldspar matrix 

(skarn). Mineralization consists of coarse grained graphite, from 1 to 10 mm in size. 

Several centimetre thick graphite veins are observed. The surface expression of the 

mineralized layer is oriented 45° and dips sharply.

9.3.6 VN8 

The VN8 showing is located northwest of VN1, near the access road to the river. 

Excavation led to the discovery of a 2 by 20 m long mineralized horizon under about 1 m 

of soil. Both extensions are lost under the overburden, so the exact length is not well 

known. The host rock is the recrystallized marble unit, with disseminated millimetric 

grains of graphite. The mineralization is a stacking of graphite and skarn layers, each a 

few centimetres thick. It is heavily folded and arcing greatly. A very large (2 m) diabase 

dyke is visible, cutting across the mineralization. At least two shearing episodes are 

visible, recouping both the graphite/skarn and the dyke. 

9.3.7 VN9 

West of VN3 is a small anomaly (EM-1). Drillhole DDH15-76 intersected only minor 

mineralization, so a larger trench was dug around the casing. Coarse feldspars with large 

crystals of graphite have been found at the northern tip of the trench while at the east is 

a 1 m pod of graphite. 

9.3.8 ANOMALIES EM-16 AND EM-17 

At location L350N 000E to L350N 065E on the geophysical grid are two small EM 

anomalies (EM-16 and EM-17). Two trenches were done to make observations. The 

western part (from 000E to 025E) is a marble horizon with underlying fine grained skarn. 

In the eastern part (from 050E to 065E), the bedrock is a fine grained green and white 

skarn. Centimetric veins of graphite are also visible in the skarn horizon.  

Using the orientation and position of the diabase dyke at VN4/VN6, as well as the one at 

L600N 015E and in using a geophysical pseudo section, the dyke extension was inferred 

to be around L350 25E. The portion between the two outcrops was trenched but it filled 

with water in a matter of minutes, preventing direct cartography. Visual observation of 

blocs removed showed the presence of the diabase dyke.  

9.3.9 ANOMALY EM-22 

An old pit, roughly 2 m in diameter is located at coordinate L400N 50W on the 

geophysics grid. Graphitic mineralization is observed in a skarn exposed by trenching on 

a small conductive anomaly (E3-22) located less than 10 m away. Folding has been 

observed on the outcrop.  

9.3.10 ANOMALIES EM-22 AND EM-23 

Two small EM anomalies (EM-22 and EM-23) are located at L550N 035W on the 

geophysical grid. Trenching was done to record observations prior to drilling. The 

overburden is composed of mineralized blocks from ancient stockpile and soil 

approximately one metre thick. The bedrock is a 2-m marble cap, with disseminated 

graphite and millimetric graphite veins. An underlying skarn horizon was exposed. A

coarse grained wollastonite and amphibole pod is visible in the fine grained silicate 

skarn. Disseminated graphite is also visible in the skarn horizon.  

9.3.11 ANOMALY E3-19 

Location L600 015E was trenched to place a drillhole to reach a subsurface conductive 

anomaly (E3-19). A large amount of mineralized (disseminated graphite) marble was 

found. A diabase dyke 1.20m thick oriented N130 and sub-vertical was observed. The 

orientation of S0 is interpreted to be N290°. Thin millimetric veinlets of graphite in the 

marble are oriented N315°. White skarn with large feldspars are located at the eastern 

end of the outcrop (at L600N 025E). No mineralization is visible in the skarn. 

9.4 CHANNEL SAMPLING 

All channel samples were taken perpendicular to the orientation of the stratigraphy, 

schistosity, mineralization and/or any other visible continuous structure. Channel 

samples were between 2 to 3 cm in width, approximately 10 cm in depth and one metre 

long. Sample weights were between 5 to 10 kg. Channels were placed to sample marble 

where no nearby drillholes existed. They spanned the longest length possible within the 

trenches, with the objective of sampling both the mineralization and host rock. Figure 

9.10 displays the location of the channel samples.

9.4.1 VN1-VN2 

Four channels were taken at the VN1-VN2 showings (Table 9.1). They were aimed directly 

at the pods in an attempt to intersect the thickest part of the mineralization, 

perpendicular to the length. 

9.4.2 VN4 

Two channels were completed directly on the VN4 showing (Table 9.1), measuring about 

1.5 m and 0.5 m in length. RN4-1 intersected coarse amphibole-wollastonite-graphite 

mineralization and RN4-1b, situated half a meter to the south, was placed on a richer 

part of the pod. 

9.4.3 VN6 

Two long channel samples (Table 9.1) were taken perpendicular to the mineralized 

layers. The locations were chosen as the thickest parts of the apparent section. Lengths 

in the rock were identified and pre-cut, 7 m long for the first one and 3.5 m long for the 

second. By the time the channels were completely cut, the water table had moved up and 

over the first metres, hampering their recovery. They both cross-cut the lithologies near a 

contact between the marble and skarn. The horizon consisted of layered graphite in a 

fine-grained pyroxene-wollastonite-feldspar matrix (skarn). Mineralization consisted of 

coarse grained graphite, from 1 to 10 mm in size. 

9.4.4 VN8 

Small, metre-long channel samples were taken randomly along the mineralized sheet 

(Table 9.1). They were placed perpendicular to the lithologies at the contact between the 

marble and skarn. The mineralized horizon is layered graphite in a fine-grained pyroxene-

wollastonite-feldspar matrix (skarn). Mineralization consisted of coarse grained graphite, 

from 1 to 10 mm in size.

9.4.5 MARBLE 

An important part of the 2015 summer campaign focused on the determination of 

graphite content of the marble unit. Trenches were dug and channel samples were taken 

systematically in trenches (Table 9.2). They were placed either directly above the 

horizontal projection of the end of a near diamond drill hole, between drillholes that 

intersected important lengths of marble and where the density of information was lower, 

or simply in any visible marble horizon at the surface, inside previously opened trenches. 

Logging of diamond drill core and channel samples revealed a significant amount of 

white marble, with little alteration or color variation. This marble poses significant 

architectural stone potential. The area northeast of VN3 has been identified as the best 

sector for potential quarrying. Two large test samples (greater than 100 kg each) were 

collected with a Tramac in the VN3 area. They were sent to a monument builder in the 

Stanstead area to be cut and polished. They were deemed of sufficient quality to be of

commercial value. Two larger blocks were collected, about two cubic meters each, and 

were sent for further testing and assaying.

9.5 BULK SAMPLING 

In March 2013, Canada Carbon received permission to collect and ship up to 480 t of 

graphite-bearing material from its Miller Property in Quebec. According to the 

authorization granted by the MRN, the material could be extracted for mineralogical 

testing as well as for distribution to potential purchasers. The sample was to be collected 

between March 15 and September 15, 2014, and the results of the treatment were to be 

reported to the MERN by September 15, 2015. The objective of the bulk sample was to 

test the historically mined trench area of the Miller Property, along with multiple veins of 

graphite mineralization found over the area during field exploration by Canada Carbon. 

Stockpiles of graphitic material from historical production were also found in various 

areas around the former mine and could be sent out for the purpose of bulk sampling. 

The removal of surface material in the trench would also assist Canada Carbon to 

understand the distribution of graphite pods and veins along the mineralized contact. 

Canada Carbon, in association with SGS (Lakefield) began pilot-scale processing of 

graphite material from the Miller Property. The primary objectives of the pilot plant 

operation were to generate larger quantities of graphite flotation concentrate for 

downstream evaluation, and to provide process data to facilitate future engineering 

studies. An initial 25-t composite was shipped to SGS Lakefield in mid-August 2014 for 

commissioning purposes. An additional 102 t of material from the Miller graphite 

mineralization was received by SGS on September 9, 2014 for pilot plant-scale flotation 

optimization. 

The initial 25-t sample was selected for purposes of commissioning the pilot plant 

equipment at SGS (Lakefield). This sample was composed of graphitic material from 

multiple sites, selected by visual examination. Approximately 5 t of the material (20% of 

the bulk sample) were comprised of metre-scale graphitic blocks excavated during the 

trenching over the VN1 and VN2 showings, which lie about 150 m west of the Miller pit. A 

further approximate 5 t (20%) of the material comprised of 0.3 to 1 m graphitic blocks 

excavated during the trenching over the VN3 showing, which lies about 500 m to the 

southeast of the Miller pit. The remaining approximate 15 t (60%) were obtained from the 

historic Miller stockpiles; hand-sorting and mechanical removal of gangue mineralization 

yielded blocks of 0.15 to 1 m dimensions.

The 102-t bulk sample comprised of graphitic blocks which were visually estimated to 

have graphite concentrations of 5% or more, intended to be representative of the lower 

grade material present on the Miller Property. Approximately 61 t of the material were 

obtained from the historic Miller stockpiles. A further 26 t (approximate) were provided by 

blocks excavated during trenching over the VN6 showing. The remaining 15 t 

(approximate) were provided by blocks excavated during trenching over the VN4 showing. 

Block sizes ranged from 10 cm to 2 m. The bulk sample processed includes material 

from all known significant surface exposures of graphite, and is therefore fully 

representative of the lower grade Miller hydrothermal graphite mineralization. Results 

were reported in Canada Carbon's press releases of September and October 2014. 

In late 2014, a second bulk sample of about 20 t was taken. Emile Foucault Excavation 

Inc., a local business specializing in excavation and demolition, was contracted to use 

machines to excavate mineralization on the VN6 showing for bulk sampling. Under the 

supervision of a geologist, the Tramac demolished the layered graphite horizon, 

measuring approximately 1 m deep by 20 m long and 5 m wide. Large blocks (above 30 

cm) were subsequently broken into smaller pieces until the largest blocks measured a 

maximum of 20 to 30 cm in diameter. Approximately 30 t of mobile material, mineralized 

or sterile, was created. Under the supervision of a geologist, the best material was hand-

sorted and put into industrial bags (36 inch by 36 inch x 48 inch, 1,500 kg capacity). 

Each bag was about 1 t and 22 bags were filled. To measure the exact total amount of 

material, bags were loaded onto a truck and weighed. The total mass was 21,500 kg of 

chosen material to be sent for metallurgic testing to a private purchaser. The shipment 

was sent in early 2015 due to weather conditions. The issuer and the receiver signed a 

confidentiality agreement restricting the disclosure of the metallurgical results. 

Jean-Philippe Paiement of SGS is of the opinion that hand sorting block of 20 to 30 cm 

could result in high grading the material compared to sampling an entire load closer to 

the smallest mining unit (SMU).  However, metallurgical tests were also performed on 

lower-grade mineralization.

10.0  D RILL ING  

Canada Carbon performed a number of drilling campaigns between 2013 and 2015 

(Figure 10.1) to test geophysical targets (conductors) and to extend surface graphite 

mineralization, targeting high-grade graphite mineralization to depth. A total of 95 holes 

were drilled on the Miller Property for a total 5,283.53 m.  Four additional drill holes 

(VN1-01; VN1-02; VN2-01; VN2-02) were done in 2013, using a winky drill that targeted 

near surface mineralization.  The results from the winky drill holes were not used in the 

Mineral Resource estimate. 

The witness drill cores boxes are stored onsite (Figure 10.2), in wooden racks. This site is 

accessible from the main road via a gated trail. A database of drill box location is kept on 

site. Drill cores are transferred from the drill to a temporary core shack by the drillers. The 

boxes are opened by a technician, measured and photographed. Each hole is logged, 

registering the different lithologies, marble quality and assay intervals.  

The drillholes are planned using geographic information system (GIS) software and the 

drillhole collars locations are placed on the field using a chaining method based on 

known location (differential global positioning system (DGPS) surveyed drillholes or base 

station). Front sights and back sights are placed using a magnetic compass. Drilling 

directions vary from one area to another (Figure 10.1) and no established grid has been 

used on the Miler Property. The drillholes were set on dips varying from -45 to -90°. 

The drilling campaigns were planned by Steven Lauzier, P.Geo. and the execution of the 

drilling, logging and sampling was conducted by SL Exploration Inc., with Downing Drilling 

and Foradrill performing the drill work. Final drill logs were reviewed by Steven Lauzier, 

P.Geo and the drilling data was compiled in a Microsoft® Excel database by Steven 

Lauzier, P.Geo and Pierre-Alexandre Pelletier, P.Geo. 

A total of 2,652 samples were initially taken from the different drillholes and sent for 

assaying. The assays represent 2,626.23 m; which corresponds to 50% of the total 

length of the drillholes. All samples were assayed for graphitic carbon and the assay 

results were registered in a Microsoft® Excel database; which was later transferred to an 

Access based logging software. The initial sampling programs focused on high grade 

visible graphite mineralization. Following a change of exploration scope to both high 

grade and low grade disseminated mineralization, Canada Carbon resampled the missing 

length of drill core according to SGS's recommendations.  

The drilling companies have left some of the casings in the drillholes (Figure 10.3). 

Markers with drillhole identification, direction and dip are left in each hole when drilling is 

completed (Figure 10.3). The final drilling locations were surveyed using a DGPS and the 

surveying work was conducted by J L Corriveau & Assoc Inc.

10.1 DRILLING CAMPAIGN, JULY 2013 

Canada Carbon's first drilling campaign of 12 holes totalling 594.9 m was carried out 

from late July to early August of 2013. The objective was to test the depth and lateral 

extent of the various veins. Downing Drilling was contracted to drill the VN1 and VN2 

showings in August 2013. The firm used NQ size drilling rods for DDH13-01 to DDH13-

08. One hole was attempted using a small portable drill (VN1-01) but was terminated in 

the first metre of drilling due to the hardness of the pegmatite. An on-track drill was then 

used to complete the other three planned short holes (VN1-02, VN2-01, and VN2-02). 

The results of the drilling campaign demonstrate that the graphitic vein system extends 

to a depth of at least 39 m beneath the VN2 surface occurrences. Drilling intersected a 

graphite-wollastonite pod at 39.3 m (vertically) beneath the VN2 showing in hole DDH13-

03, returning assays similar to the surface results, with 15.14% graphitic carbon over 0.9 

m. Drill hole DDH13-04 laterally extended the graphite-wollastonite mineralization 14 m 

toward the east, and intersected 14.5% graphitic carbon over 0.5 m at 33.8 m (vertically) 

underground. 

Some drillholes also tested the VN2 showing near surface. Drillhole VN02-01 

encountered 32.45% graphitic carbon over 2 m from 1 to 3 m downhole, including two 

veins assaying 53.6% graphitic carbon over 0.3 m and 51.7% graphitic carbon over 

0.9 m, respectively. 

Many lower grade intersections were also encountered. Some of the lower grade 

mineralization includes graphitic marble or paragneiss grading between 0.46% and

5.27% graphitic carbon. Many rock units were crosscut by thin veins (2 to 5 cm). 

Highlights of the drilling results are presented in Table 10.1. 

10.2 DRILLING CAMPAIGN, NOVEMBER 2013 

Canada Carbon contracted George Downing Estate Drilling Ltd. in mid-November 2013 

(Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, Quebec) to complete a 10-hole (551 m) NQ-sized diamond drilling 

program. The firm used a BoartLongyear LF70 rig with Interlock system. The objective 

was to extend the VN2 graphite mineralization at depth and along strike, and to drill-test 

three VTEM anomalies identified by the VTEM anomaly modelling. This hole was intended 

to sample below the graphite veins and pods observed in the trench area since previous 

drilling had already tested the continuity of the graphite veins. The winter campaign 

encountered bad weather, which slowed down drilling production. 

Diamond drillhole (DDH) 13-09 explained the E2 VTEM anomaly when it encountered a 

sulphide-rich intersection with minor disseminated graphite. DDH13-10 targeted the E3 

anomaly and encountered a wide intersection of minor and disseminated graphite in 

marble. 

While moving the rig to the E3 drill site, a graphite-rich vein (VN3) was exposed over a 

width of 2 m and a strike length of 5 m before pinching out. The VN3 discovery was 

drilled during the third campaign with six shallow drill holes that targeted the projected 

strike and depth extensions of the vein (see next section for details).  

The most significant results were from the new vein discovery VN3 with 48.60% graphitic 

carbon over 1.8 m in DDH13-15, including 63.20% graphitic carbon over 0.5 m. This 

intersection of graphite mineralization occurs 4.6 m (vertically) below the VN3 showing. In 

turn, DDH13-14 intersected a graphite vein grading 50.50% over 0.30 m within a 3.50 m 

interval grading 6.80% graphitic carbon between the surface and the DDH13-15 graphite 

mineralization. The VN3 showing remained open at depth at the end of the drill campaign 

and was closed in subsequent drilling. 

The other hole of interest is DDH13-11, which targeted the depth extension of a 

wollastonite-graphite pod located 22.5 m southeast of the VN2 showing in the trench 

area. The hole encountered another pod, thereby extending the mineralized contact 

hosting the pods to a vertical depth of 8.19 m below the surface showing. The hole 

yielded grades similar to other wollastonite-graphite pods, specifically 8.10% graphitic 

carbon over 2.3 m including 11.00% graphitic carbon over 0.90 m. The pod southeast of 

the VN2 showing is suspected to be within the same mineralized contact that extends to 

at least 39.3 m (vertically) beneath the VN2 showing. The mineralized contact also 

remains open at depth. 

Many lower-grade intersections were also sampled during drilling. The best results were 

graphitic marble grading 2.00% over 10.50 m including 4.50 m at 3.50% graphitic 

carbon, and 1.00% over 13.00 m including 4.30 m at 1.6% graphitic carbon. Isolated 

values range between trace amounts of graphite and 4.00% graphitic carbon. No 

significant gold or base metal assays were obtained. Canada Carbon will use the litho-

geochemistry data to establish alteration patterns and to better interpret the lithologies. 

Highlights of the drilling results are presented in Table 10.1. 

10.3 DRILLING CAMPAIGN, 2014 

Drilling of the new target revealed by the PhiSpy survey and the Geotech E3 target was 

done using a small portable drill (Gopher drill) from Downing Drilling due to the swampy 

nature of the drill pad. Two holes were drilled for a total of 64.5 m, targeting two 

anomalies provided by the PhiSpy survey. The anomalies are parallel, oriented north-

south. The holes were drilled with a dip of 48° to the east. Significant results are 

presented in Table 10.1. 

10.4 DRILLING CAMPAIGN, AUGUST 2014 

Canada Carbon's August 2014 drilling campaign consisted of eight holes totaling 

441.5 m. The objective was to test the depth and lateral extent of the various anomalies 

E1-4, E1-6, E1-7 and E1-9. Downing Drilling was contracted to drill the northern block 

about 800 m north of VN1. They completed drillholes DDH14-21 to DDH14-28 and 

produced BQ diameter core. Table 10.1 presents significant results. 

10.5 DRILLING CAMPAIGN, SEPTEMBER 2014 

Canada Carbon contracted Downing Drilling in September 2014 (Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, 

Quebec) to complete a nine-hole (408 m) BQ-sized diamond drilling program. The 

objective was to extend the VN3 graphite mineralization at depth and along strike, and to 

drill-test three TDEM anomalies identified by the PhiSpy survey. Highlights of the drilling 

results are presented in Table 10.1. 

10.6 DRILLING CAMPAIGN, OCTOBER 2014 

Canada Carbon contracted Foradrill in October 2014 (Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, Quebec) to 

complete a 13-hole (640 m) BTW-sized diamond drilling program. The objective was to 

extend the VN6 graphite mineralization at depth and along strike, and to drill-test three 

TDEM anomalies identified by the PhiSpy survey. 

Contrary to all the previous holes drilled parallel to the geophysical grid, a preferred 

orientation of 70° toward the north was chosen. Extensive trenching done during the 

summer combined with information from previous holes (DDH14-35, DDH14-36 and 

DDH14-37) revealed more details about the direction and schistosity of the rocks. 

Highlights of the drilling results are presented in Table 10.1.

10.7 DRILLING CAMPAIGN, NOVEMBER 2014 

Canada Carbon contracted Foradrill in November 2014 (Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, Quebec) 

to complete a 12-hole (518 m) BTW-sized diamond drilling program. The objective was to 

extend the VN6 graphite mineralization at depth and along strike, and to drill-test five 

TDEM and conductive anomalies identified by the previous survey. Highlights of the 

drilling results are presented in Table 10.1. 

10.8 DRILLING CAMPAIGN, FEBRUARY 2015 

Canada Carbon contracted Foradrill in February 2015 to complete a 42-hole (2,525 m) 

BTW-sized diamond drilling program. The objective was to extend the VN6 graphite 

mineralization at depth and along strike, and to drill-test TDEM and conductive anomalies 

identified by the previous survey. Highlights of the drilling results are presented in Table

10.9 CHANNEL SAMPLES 

During the different exploration campaigns, Canada Carbon conducted different phases 

of trenching and stripping in which channel samples were taken. The channel samples 

range in size from 0.5 to 1 m and are oriented according to the azimuth of the sampling 

direction and dip to follow the terrain features.  

Channels were treated as drillholes, with each samples plotted along the trace of the 

channel. Normally, the channel sampling is conducted over known mineralization with 

the beginning and end of the channel being in the host rock (Figure 10.4). However, 

some channel samples only cover the mineralization portion of the rock formation.

A total of 171 channel samples were taken on the Miller Property, for a total of 167.1 m. 

Samples were photographed, described and bagged to be sent for assaying. In some 

cases, witness half channel samples were left in place (Figure 10.4). 

The channel sampling program was planned by SL Exploration Inc. and executed under 

supervision of Steven Lauzier, P.Geo. The channel locations were surveyed using a 

regular GPS or the geophysic grid location. No identification markers are left in place at 

channel sampling sites.

11.0  SAMP LE  P REP ARATION,  ANALYSIS  AND 
SECURITY  

11.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION 

Prospecting work followed a protocol determined by Canada Carbon's technical team. To 

ensure samples and data were collected properly, a clear chain of custody of samples 

was established from the collection site to the laboratory. 

Between 2013 and 2014, Canada Carbon sampled select intervals of drill core to assay; 

with the intent of highlighting high grade mineralization. One metre samples were taken 

over visibly graphite mineralised core. Shorter samples were also taken in the richest 

zone to determine zonation within graphite pods. Longer samples were also taken when 

recovery was poor. 

In 2015, Canada Carbon conducted a systematic drill core sampling campaign of what 

was left to be sampled. The objective of the sampling was to generate a more complete 

graphite grade dataset for the Miller Deposit and ensure continuous sampling throughout 

the deposit. Sample preparation procedures for Canada Carbon are described in the 

following subsection. Quality assurance (QA)/quality control (QC) is described in Section 

11.2. 

Drill core was transported from the drill to the camp logging area with an all-terrain 

vehicle. Sample intervals were determined by the geologist during the geological logging 

process. Sample intervals were labelled with unique sequential sample identification 

numbers, on white plastified paper tags, which were: 1) put into the sample bags; 2) left 

in the sample booklet, and 3) stapled to the core box. 

Sample intervals were determined by the geological relationships observed in the core 

and limited to a 3 m maximum length with no minimum length. An attempt was made to 

terminate sample intervals at lithological and mineralization boundaries. Sampling was 

generally continuous from the top to the bottom of the drill hole following the 2015 core 

sampling program.  

Geological parameters were recorded based on defined sample intervals and/or drill run 

intervals (defined by the placement of a wooden block at the end of a core run). Drill logs 

were converted to a digital format and added to the database. 

The drill core was photographed and then brought into the core shack where it was 

divided into sample intervals, split in half by a hydraulic splitter, and bagged by the core 

cutters. If core was not competent, it was split by using a spoon to transfer half of the 

core into the sample bag.

Once the core was split, half was sent to Actlabs facility in Ancaster, Ontario, for analysis 

and the other half was initially stored at the camp. Shipment of core samples from the 

Miller camp occurred after completion of the splitting campaign. Rice bags, containing 10 

to 15 poly-bagged core samples each, were marked and labelled with the Canada Carbon 

name, bag number, and sample numbers enclosed. Rice bags were secured with a tie-

wrap for transport by courier or by truck directly to the Actlabs facility.  

In addition to the core, control samples were inserted into the shipments at the 

approximate rate of three standards (3%), one blank (1%) and four duplicates (4%) per 

100 core samples: 

 Standards: four different standards were used at the Miller Deposit. The core 

cutter inserted a sachet of the appropriate standard, as well as the sample tag, 

into the sample bag. 

 Blanks: were composed of a standard void of mineralisation. The core cutter 

inserted a sachet of the blank material, as well as the sample tag, into the 

sample bag. 

 Duplicates: the core cutter split the sample in half, split the half again, and 

placed two quarter-splits in two separate bags with unique tags and left the 

witness half in the core box. 

11.1.1 CORE DRILLING SAMPLING 

Core samples were split in half on site and sent to Actlabs. Richer intersections were 

subdivided into vein and non-vein material. Quarter-splits of the non-vein material were 

sent to SGS in Lakefield, Ontario, for additional assaying and quarter-splits of the rest 

(vein material) were sent to Actlabs, which reported their results according to protocol 

5D-C. 

At Actlabs, the samples underwent preparation RX1-Graphitic, which is drying, crushing 

with up to 90% passing through a #10 square-mesh screen, riffle splitting (250 gram) 

and pulverizing to 95% passing a 105 µm square-mesh screen. Graphitic carbon was 

determined by multistage furnace treatment and infrared absorption, with a 0.05% 

detection limit using analysis package 4F-C-Graphitic.  

SGS prepared the samples by crushing to 75% passing 2 mm, splitting (250 g) and 

pulverizing to 85% passing 75 µm square-mesh screen. Graphitic carbon was determined 

by calculating the difference from the carbon assay (after ashing) by tube 

furnace/coulometer minus the carbonate carbon (after ashing) by coulometry. The 

remainder of the core was tagged and stored on site. 

11.1.2 CHANNEL SAMPLING 

All channel samples were taken perpendicular to the orientation of the veins or pods. 

Channel samples were sent to Actlabs. Actlabs' results are reported using preparation 

RX1-Graphitic in which the samples underwent drying, crushing with up to 90% passing 

through a #10 square-mesh screen, riffle splitting (250 g) and pulverizing to 95% passing

a 105 µm square-mesh screen. Graphitic carbon was determined by multi-stage furnace 

treatment and infrared absorption, with a 0.05% detection limit using analysis package 

4F-C-Graphitic. . 

11.2 QA/QC 

Actlabs is an accredited laboratory meeting international standards International 

Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2000 with certification: 

 No. CERT-0032482 

 the Canadian Association for Laboratory Accreditation Inc. Standard 

ISO/IFC170252005 accreditation No. A3200.  

At the laboratory, samples are prepared using preparation RX1-Graphitic by drying, 

crushing (less than 7 kg) up to 90% passing 10 mesh, riffle splitting (250 g) and 

pulverizing (mild steel) to 95% passing 105 µm. Graphitic carbon assaying was 

completed by multistage furnace treatment and infrared absorption using analysis 

package 4F-C-Graphitic.. A suite of 49 elements were also analyzed in select samples by 

aqua regia digestion and Varian inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. The multi-

element package 1E3 (AR+ICP) comprised gold, cadmium, copper, manganese, 

molybdenum, nickel, lead, zinc, aluminum, arsenic, boron, barium, beryllium, bismuth, 

calcium, cobalt, chromium, iron, gallium, mercury, potassium, lanthanum, magnesium, 

sodium, phosphorus, sulphur, antimony, scandium, strontium, titanium, tellurium, 

thallium, uranium, vanadium, tungsten, yttrium, and zirconium. Duplicate analyses were 

performed at the laboratory for the purposes of quality assurance and quality control. No 

other QA or QC program was established. 

11.3 VERIFICATION OF THE QA/QC DATA 

The database transmitted by Canada Carbon contained graphite assay results for 49 

blanks samples, 190 field duplicates and 102 standards. The results were compiled and 

verified by the author to assess the laboratory performance and assay data reliability.  

11.3.1 BLANK MATERIAL RESULTS 

A total of 49 analytical blanks were analyzed during the 2013 to 2015 exploration 

programs. The blank chosen by Canada Carbon is composed of a standard material 

(GS912-5: pulverized granite) with 0.1% total carbon and void of graphitic carbon. 

From the 49 blanks analyzed, 100% of them returned values less than 0.3% total carbon 

(0% graphitic carbon), which is three times the methods detection limit. Figure 11.1 

shows a plot of the variation of the analytical blanks with time. No graphitic carbon was 

reported for all the blank samples despite the presence of other form of carbon found in 

the standard.

11.3.2 DUPLICATE MATERIAL RESULTS 

Sample duplicates were inserted in the sample stream as part of Canada Carbon's 

internal QA/QC protocol. The sample duplicates correspond to a quarter NQ or BTW core 

from the sample left behind for reference, or a representative channel sample from the 

secondary channel cut parallel to the main channel. Figure 11.2 shows correlation plots 

for the core duplicates. 

From 2013, a total of 190 duplicates results analyzed by Actlabs are available. From the 

190 core duplicates analyzed only three or 2.4% of the samples fall outside the ±20% 

range (Figure 11.2). The sign test for the duplicates does not show any bias (41% original 

< duplicate, 44% original > duplicate, and 15% original = duplicate). The mean of the 

percentages of difference is -3.24% (Figure 11.2).

11.3.3 STANDARD MATERIAL RESULTS 

Four different standards were used by Canada Carbon for the internal QA/QC program: 

two low-grade graphitic carbon (less than 0.4% graphitic carbon; GCC-08 and GCC-07) 

and two high-grade graphitic carbon (greater than 2.4% graphitic carbon; GGC-04 and 

GGC-09) standards. All four standards were taken from reference materials bought on 

the market (Geostats PTY Ltd.) and are certified for using a leach process (for graphitic 

carbon) and a carbon/sulphur analyzer. 

A total of 51 high-grade standards and 51 low-grade standards were analyzed during the 

2013, 2014, and 2015 exploration campaigns, representing 2.8% of the samples 

analyzed, which is under the industry's standard for QA/QC. In order to determine the QC 

warning (±2x standard deviation) and QC failure (±3x standard deviation) intervals for the 

standards, the standard deviation parameters are derived from the certificates of the 

reference material. 

From the 25 GGC-04 standards analyzed, none of the results fall outside the QC warning 

and QC failure intervals, as set by the certificate (Figure 11.3). The mean value of the 

reported grade is 13.53% graphitic carbon, which is equal to the expected value of this 

standard.  

The GGC-09 standard was inserted a total of 26 times in the sample stream. None of the 

results from this standard are outside the warning and fail QA/QC performance gates 

(Figure 11.3). However, a bias is observed in the results from GGC-09 standard. The 

mean value of the assay result is 2.74% graphitic carbon, with a standard deviation of 

0.03, which is 12% higher than the expected value. This difference in results and 

expected value could be due to the different assaying method used in standard 

certification (leaching) and Canada Carbon's assays (multi-stage furnace).

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment 

for the Miller Graphite and Marble Project,

Standard GCC-08 was assayed 10 times and again no QA/QC failures are observed 

(Figure 11.3). However, a bias is observed in the values; where the mean value of the 

assays is 0.44% graphitic carbon for an expected value 0f 0.39% graphitic carbon. One 

hundred percent of the assays are overestimated by an average of 10% (Figure 11.3).  

For example in the GGC-09 standard, this bias could be due the different assay methods. 

There are 41 results for standard GCC-07 and no QA/QC failures are observed (Figure 

11.3). No bias is observed and the average value of the standards is 0.13% graphitic 

carbon, for an expected value of 0.13% graphitic carbon. 

11.4 QA/QC OBSERVATION CONCLUSION 

Internal QA/QC results from Canada Carbon indicate good correlation (R2 = 0.90) for the 

same core duplicates for the principal mineral of economic interest (graphite) for the 

2013, 2014 and 2015 drill programs. All values derived from the insertion of blanks into 

the sample stream by Canada Carbon were within acceptable ranges. No assay values 

exceeded the QA/QC performance gate. However biases are observed in two of the 

standards used in the QA/QC process. In both cases, the values seem to be 

overestimated by an average of 10%. 

In SGS's opinion, the Project will benefit from more QA/QC samples included in the 

sample stream. The biases caused by possible assay method differences between 

standard certification and Canada Carbon assays should be investigated and fixed. 10% 

of overestimation could prove problematic especially in assays close to the economical 

assays grades.  

The data is considered acceptable for the estimation of Mineral Resources, but could 

affect the classification of the Mineral Resources as the QA/QC quantity is limited and 

the performance of the standards shows bias in two of the four standards.

12.0  D ATA V ERIF ICATION  

A site visit was conducted by Jean-Philippe Paiement, P.Geo., M.Sc. at the Project site 

from August 5 to 6, 2015. The observations and comments from that site visit were 

included in an internal memorandum transmitted to Canada Carbon's representatives on 

August 10, 2015. The visit enabled the author to get familiar with the exploration 

methods used by Canada Carbon, the field conditions, the position of the drillhole collars, 

the core storage and logging facilities and the different exploration targets. During the 

site visit, Jean-Philippe Paiement of SGS collected a total of 41 control samples from 

existing drill cores.  

The data validation was conducted from three fronts: 

 validation of the drilling database 

 validation of the QA.QC data (see Section 11.0) 

 control sampling program. 

12.1 DRILLING DATABASE VALIDATION 

The database for the Project was first transmitted to SGS by Canada Carbon on July 27, 

2015. The database contained values for: 1) collar locations; 2) down hole surveys; 3) 

lithologies and 4) assays with a graphitic carbon percentage. 

The database was transferred in Microsoft® Excel format and was transferred to a 

Microsoft® Access based logging software (Geobase©) by SGS. This enabled the author to 

run automatic checks scripts and highlight majors errors and discrepancies in the data. 

The errors were communicated to Canada Carbon and several iterations of the database 

were transmitted to SGS until December 10, 2015, at which point the database 

contained an extra entry table for the marble quality of the core and all of the mineralized 

marble assays intervals. 

Upon importation of the data into the modelling and mineral resources estimation 

software (Genesis©), SGS conducted a second phase of data validation. At this point all 

the major discrepancies were removed from the database. 

Lastly, SGS conducted random checks on approximately 5% of the assay certificates, to 

validate the assay values entered in the database.

12.2 CONTROL SAMPLING 

During the site visit, the author conducted a check sampling program, re-sampling a total 

of 41 core samples to verify the presence of graphite mineralization on the Miller 

Property. The samples were taken from previously sampled intervals and the half cores 

were split to quarter cores. The graphite was analyzed at ALS Chemex laboratories in Val 

d'Or for percentages of graphitic carbon. The sampling was conducted by Canada 

Carbon's technician under the supervision of the author. 

A total of six mineralized intervals (Table 12.1) were sampled to compare the average 

grade for the two different laboratories. The difference in average grade from the 0.15 m 

to 13.00 m intervals varies from 3 to 68%. The 68% difference can be explained by the 

short nature of the sampled interval by Canada Carbon (0.15 m), which was a grab 

sample of the vein material.  Grab samples are biased by nature and the sample was not 

used in the resource estimate since a longer intersection was also sampled in parallel.    

The duplicate with a 30% difference can be easily explained by the coarse mineralization 

that generated a high nugget effect in the sample.  The remaining percentage of 

differences between the average grades are acceptable, and all mineralized intervals 

were confirmed by SGS (Table 12.1). 

The sample to sample comparison yield a correlation of 0.6 (R2; Figure 12.1), with the 

presence of two major outliers. By removing those two samples, the correlation increases 

to 0.91 (R2) with an average grade of 1.46% graphitic carbon for both populations. No 

biases are observed in between the population, but it seems that the values are slightly 

lower in the initial samples (Canada Carbon; Figure 12.1). This could be explained by a 

sampling bias or the natural variance of the deposit. Further testing should be conducted 

in a further QA/QC program to establish the reason underlying this variance.

12.3 CONCLUSION 

Following the data verification process and QA/QC review, the author is of the opinion 

that the data produced by Canada Carbon during the exploration program is of sufficient 

quality to produce a Mineral Resource estimate. The QA/QC quantity could be increased 

to the industry's standard of 10 to 15% of the sampling. Furthermore, future sampling 

should continue to be conducted on all of the cores and samples should continue to be 

split in order to have the same quantity of mineralization in both half of the core.  

Recommendations will be made in Section 26.0 of the report in order to increase the 

sampling program performances and the integrity of the data collected by Canada 

Carbon.

13.1 INTRODUCTION 

This section summarizes the metallurgical test work conducted for the Project.  Two 

potential mineral values have been identified, namely graphite and marble. 

13.2 GRAPHITE 

A total of five flotation testing programs, including a pilot plant campaign and several 

graphite concentrate upgrade tests were conducted using various samples originating 

from the Miller deposit.  The flotation concentration test work was conducted by SGS in 

Lakefield, Ontario.  Several graphite samples were subjected to flotation tests, as well as 

concentrate purification tests, glow-discharge mass-spectrometry (GDMS) analysis, and 

crystallinity determination by Raman spectroscopy. 

13.2.1 HEAD SAMPLE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS 

The head assays for the samples that were evaluated in the five metallurgical programs 

are depicted in Table 13.1.  The head grades varied significantly between 0.53% 

graphitic carbon and 61.2% graphitic carbon.  This is reflective of the different domains 

that are encountered in the Project, ranging from low-grade disseminated mineralization 

to high-grade graphite veins.

 leach to remove any carbonates and LECO assay of the leach residue. 

13.2.2 GRINDABILITY TEST 

A Bond rod mill grindability test was carried out on the low-grade composite that yielded 

0.53% graphitic carbon.  The comminution test was carried out at the standard grind size 

of 14 mesh.  The Bond rod mill work index was determined to be 6.1 kWh/t, which is

softer than 98% of the more than 2,600 samples in the SGS Bond rod mill grindability 

database. 

13.2.3 FLOTATION CONCENTRATION TEST 

BATCH FLOTATION TEST 

The first set of two laboratory flotation tests under Project 14185-001/002 evaluated the 

metallurgical performance of a vein graphite sample grading 61.3% graphitic carbon.  

The primary objectives of the flotation tests were to observe the metallurgical response of 

the Miller graphite to conventional grinding and flotation technologies and to generate 

samples for purification tests.  The circuit consisted of a brief primary grind followed by 

flash flotation on the mill discharge. The purpose of the flash flotation stage was to 

recover any liberated coarse graphite flakes prior to the employment of more aggressive 

secondary grinding conditions.  The flash flotation tailings were subjected to a secondary 

grind using steel rods followed by scavenger flotation.  The combined rougher and 

scavenger concentrate was then subjected to polish grinding using ceramic media and 

cleaner flotation.  In Test F2, three stages of polish grinding and cleaner flotation were 

employed.  A typical reagent regime for graphite projects was chosen in the tests and 

consisted of fuel oil #2 as the collector and methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) as the frother. 

The second test produced a concentrate grade of 93.2% total carbon at an open circuit 

with a carbon recovery of 97.2%.  The results of the size fraction analysis of the 10th 

cleaner concentrate of Test F2 are presented in Table 13.2.  All size fractions greater 

than 200 mesh yielded concentrate grades of 97.2% total carbon or higher.  The majority 

of the impurities reported to the -200 mesh size fraction, which graded only 84.4% total 

carbon.  The combined concentrate without the -200 mesh product graded 98.1% total 

carbon, containing 64.7% of the carbon units of the overall concentrate.

While the results were preliminary in nature, they've provided two valuable insights.  

Firstly, the fact that the coarser flakes could be upgraded to over 97% total carbon using 

traditional mineral processing technologies may suggest that the impurities are attached 

to the outside of the flakes rather than being intercalated within the flake structure.  

Secondly, the mechanical manipulation that is required for the removal of the impurities

is a function of the flake size.  It is postulated that in order to achieve high concentrate 

grades in the smaller size fraction more mechanical manipulation and possibly a different 

grinding process may be required.  

The second metallurgical program for the Miller project was carried out on a 51 kg 

sample, which was comprised of sub-samples from several different areas of the graphite 

target.  The first sub-sample of 15 kg comprised stockpiled lump graphite remains from 

the original Miller Mine. The second sub-sample of 36 kg was obtained by cutting the vein 

with a rock saw from the VN3 mineralization exposed on the surface.  

The primary objective of the test program was to develop a conceptual flowsheet for the 

Miller graphite mineralization that produces a saleable concentrate grading at least 95% 

total carbon while minimizing flake degradation.  The program consisted of seven open 

circuit flotation tests, which culminated in the flowsheet that is depicted in Figure 13.1.  

The process flowsheet can be summarized as flash and rougher flotation followed by 

primary polishing and cleaning of the combined flash and rougher concentrate.  The 

cleaner concentrate of the primary cleaning circuit is then subjected to classification into 

three size fractions of +48 mesh, -48/+100 mesh, and -100 mesh followed by polishing 

and cleaning circuits for each size fraction.  The separate cleaning of three size fractions 

was chosen to address the different grinding energy requirements of the various graphite 

flake sizes.

Test F7 produced a combined graphite concentrate yielding 97.0% total carbon at a 

graphite recovery of 90.2%. The size fraction analysis for the combined concentrate is 

presented in Table 13.3.  The data reveals that all size fractions greater than 400 mesh 

produced grades of 96.1% total carbon or higher, averaging 98.2% total carbon.  The 

majority of the impurities reported to the finer than 400 mesh product grading 89.8% 

total carbon. It should be noted that 31.1% of the mass reported to the +65 mesh size 

fractions at an average grade of 99.6% total carbon.

Due to the need to generate significant quantities of graphite concentrate for 

downstream testing, a decision was made to proceed with pilot plant testing based on 

the results of the 14185-003 test program.  The results of the pilot plant campaign are 

discussed in the following section. 

The Miller graphite prospect is characterized by areas with disseminated low-grade 

graphite mineralization surrounding the vein structures.  This disseminated graphite 

yields significantly lower graphite head grades.  In order to assess the metallurgical 

response of the disseminated graphite, two open circuit cleaner flotation tests were 

carried out under SGS Project 14185-005 on a sample grading 0.53% graphitic carbon. 

The same flowsheet that was developed under 14185-003 was employed in the two 

tests.  The only difference was an adjustment of the classification sizes from 48 mesh 

and 100 mesh to 80 mesh and 200 mesh, which was the results of an optimization 

program carried out during the pilot plant campaign. 

Despite the lower head grade of only 0.53% graphitic carbon, a combined concentrate 

grade of 96.4% total carbon at 90.1% open circuit carbon recovery was achieved.  As in 

previous tests, the majority of the impurities reported to the finer size fractions.  All 

products larger than 200 mesh yielded grades of at least 97.0% total carbon.  The full 

size fraction analysis is depicted in Table 13.4.  The +200 mesh size fractions graded 

97.8% total carbon and represented 76.9% of the total concentrate mass.

In conclusion, the three lab programs covered a wide range of head grades ranging from 

0.53% graphitic carbon to 61.3% graphitic carbon.  The metallurgical response was 

robust in that all size fractions greater than 200 mesh produced grades of at least 97% 

total carbon.  The majority of the impurities reported to the -200 mesh product.  A more 

detailed concentrate analysis that was conducted for the low-grade feed sample revealed 

that the concentrate grades decreased with each size fraction finer than 200 mesh and 

reached the minimum of 87.0% total carbon for the -400 mesh fines. 

PILOT FLOTATION TEST 

During September and October 2014, a pilot plant campaign was conducted on 

approximately 127 t of a bulk sample from the Miller deposit.  The information for bulk 

sample generation is detailed in Section 9.5.  The flowsheet that was employed in the 

pilot plant was the conceptual flowsheet developed at the end of the 14185-003 

program.  The first run of the pilot plant campaign was based on the flowsheet and 

conditions of Test F7.   

The primary objectives of the pilot plant campaign were (a) to produce graphite 

concentrates for down-stream evaluation, (b) to demonstrate the robustness of the 

proposed flowsheet, and (c) to generate process data that can be used to develop the 

process design criteria for preliminary economic assessment and feasibility study 

purposes.  As shown in Table 13.5, the average head assay on the pilot plant composite 

indicates that the composite contained 6.78% total carbon, including 5.91% graphitic 

carbon, and 0.15% total organic carbon.  Total sulphur content was 0.09% and the ICP 

scan did not reveal elevated concentrations of deleterious elements.

The initial commissioning run, PP-01, was carried out on September 8, 2014 and the 

final run, PP-22, was completed on October 31, 2014 with a total of 200 operating hours.  

A total of 22 pilot plant runs, PP-01 to PP-22, were completed. The flowsheet used for the 

pilot plant campaign consisted of the following circuits: 

 primary grinding 

 flash flotation 

 secondary grinding 

 rougher flotation 

 primary polish grinding and cleaner flotation 

 primary cleaner concentrate classification 

 separate secondary polish grinding and flotation of classification products. 

The products from different internal and external streams were collected every hour and 

submitted for total carbon assays.  The assay data were used to evaluate the 

metallurgical performance of the pilot plant and to make adjustments to improve the 

metallurgical results.  

According to the test results and the observations of runs PP01 to PP07, some minor 

modifications were made to enhance the metallurgical performance of the circuit. This 

included a change to the classification arrangement of the first cleaner concentrate, and 

the addition of dewatering the finest size fraction ahead of the secondary cleaning circuit.  

The dewatering process helped to increase the pulp density in the secondary polishing 

mill treating the -250 mesh material, thus increasing polishing efficiency.  In addition to 

the flowsheet modifications other process variables such as reagent dosages, air 

flowrates, and froth removal rates were optimized throughout the entire pilot plant 

campaign. The modified flowsheet used in pilot plant runs PP-08 to PP-22 is shown in 

Figure 13.2.  In addition to the actual flowsheet, the graph also depicts the metering 

points of process instrumentation equipment such as power meter, airflow meter, wash 

water controller, pH meter, redox probe, and auto samplers. 

In order to obtain a full circuit mass balance, a total of 11 circuit surveys were carried out 

when the pilot plant circuit appeared in steady state.  The data collected from the 

surveys, including particle distribution analysis on various streams, was used to 

quantitatively evaluate the metallurgical performance of the pilot plant circuit.  With the 

data reconciliation software Bilmat™, the overall mass balances were generated using the 

total carbon grades from all the survey samples.

The same reagent regime that was employed in the laboratory scale program was also 

chosen for the pilot plant, consisting of fuel oil #2 and MIBC. Figure 13.3 depicts the 

reagent consumption for 19 of the 22 pilot plant runs. The first two runs PP-01 and PP-

02 were excluded as they were deemed mechanical commissioning runs.  Based on the 

results of the pilot plant runs PP-15 to PP-22, SGS estimated that the optimized reagent 

dosages for both fuel oil and MIBC would be between 140 and 170 g/t.     

Figure 13.3 Reagent Consumption – Pilot Plant Runs 

 

Mass balance results from the 11 circuit surveys indicate that the pilot plant produced an 

average final concentrate grade of 95.1% total carbon, ranging from 91.9 to 96.6% total 

carbon.  The average carbon recovery was 84.0%, ranging from 74.5 to 92.5%.  The 

average head grade for these pilot plant runs was 7.63% total carbon.   

The total carbon grade of the combined concentrates versus the total carbon recovery 

into the combined concentrate of 10 circuit surveys is depicted in Figure 13.4.  The 

survey results from the PP-20 run with a total carbon recovery of 58.3% were because 

the flash and rougher flotation conditions were too selective.  For most projects and 

commodities, the recovery decreases as the concentrate grade increases. However, in 

the case of the Miller bulk sample that was processed in the pilot plant, high concentrate 

grades were maintained, even as the circuit carbon recoveries exceeded 90%. The plant 

surveys that were conducted at more selective flotation conditions were aimed to 

determine the maximum concentrate grade that can be achieved with the flotation circuit 

while accepting lower carbon recoveries. However, since more selective flotation 

conditions failed to further improve the concentrate grades, SGS recommended more 

aggressive operating conditions to maximize carbon recoveries while maintaining a high 

concentrate grade.  It should be noted that the lowest concentrate grade of 91.9% was 

obtained from the PP-05 run at the beginning of the pilot plant campaign when operating 

conditions were still being optimized.

Figure 13.4 Carbon Recovery vs. Carbon Grade –Combined Graphite Concentrate 

 

The combined graphite concentrates collected during each survey, starting from PP-08, 

were screened for particle size analysis, followed by a total carbon analysis on the 

various size fractions.  The mass recovery into the various size fractions and the 

corresponding total carbon grades are depicted in Figure 13.5 and Figure 13.6, 

respectively. The particle size of the final concentrates from the surveys ranged between 

80% passing 203 μm and 242 μm with an average particle size of 80% passing 217 μm.  

The average grade of the coarser than 80 mesh size fraction was 98.2% total carbon at 

an average mass recovery of 31.3%, ranging between 26% and 42%.  An average of 

25.6% of the concentrate mass reported to the medium flake size fraction (smaller than 

80 and larger than 150 mesh) with an average grade of 97.6% total carbon.  The balance 

of 43.1% of the concentrate mass reported to the small flake fraction (finer than 150 

mesh) with a grade of 92.6% total carbon.

Figure 13.6 Final Concentrate Grades by Size Fraction 

 

The average final concentrate size fraction analyses on eight survey samples are 

presented in Table 13.7. The average grade of the +80 mesh size fraction was 98.2% 

total carbon at an average mass recovery of 31.4% of the concentrate. An average of 

25.6% of the concentrate mass reported to the medium flake size fraction (-80/+150 

mesh) at an average grade of 97.6% total carbon. The concentrate mass reported to the 

small flakes fraction (-150 mesh) was 43.1% at an average grade of 92.6% total carbon.    

Compared to the bench test results, it appears that the pilot plant produced a final 

concentrate with the finer particle size distribution.  SGS indicated that these results 

suggest that the polishing conditions in the pilot plant operation may have been too 

aggressive.  A decision to choose more aggressive polish grinding conditions was made in

The profiles of all grab and survey samples of the combined concentrate are depicted in 

Figure 13.8 (+48, +65, and +80 mesh size fractions) and Figure 13.9 (+100, +150, 

+200, and -200 mesh size fractions), respectively.  The results show that consistently 

high concentrate grades were achieved in PP-04 immediately after mechanical 

commissioning of the circuit. All size fractions of 200 mesh and coarser consistently 

produced concentrate grades of 96% total carbon or higher with the exception of a few 

samples. 

The combined concentrate from the PP-10B circuit survey that is highlighted with a red 

rectangle was screened and assayed by LECO before the size fractions were shipped 

directly to Evans Analytical in Syracuse, New York.   

The as-received concentrates were subjected to a glow discharge mass spectrometry 

(GDMS) analysis to quantify the impurities in the different size fractions. The GDMS 

analysis is more suited for graphite concentrates with high carbon contents compared to 

the LECO as the measurement error of the GDMS analytical method is significantly 

smaller. It is able to quantify impurities at trace concentrations in high-purity inorganic 

solids and to quantify concentrations of up to 73 chemical elements in a single analysis. 

However, the required time and costs of the GDMS analysis limits its application to a 

small number of samples.  

The results of both the LECO and GDMS are presented in Table 13.8.  All analyzed size 

fractions produced values of 99.38% total carbon or higher using GDMS analysis. As 

expected, the amount of impurities for the majority of graphite concentrates decreased 

as the size fractions increased. In contrast, the concentrate grades using LECO varied 

between 97.6% and 100% total carbon for the same size fractions. It should be noted 

that the GDMS results are conservative as any elements measured below their detection 

limit were assigned their detection limit as a value for impurity calculations.

SGS derived following conclusions from the pilot plant campaign: 

 The grab samples revealed that the circuit reached a good stability shortly after 

the commissioning runs. 

 Circuit mass balances for runs PP-05 to PP-20 indicated that the plant produced 

a final concentrate with a grade ranging from 91.9 to 96.6% total carbon and a 

carbon recovery between 74.5 and 92.5%.  The average head grade, final 

concentrate grade, recovery, and mass pull into concentrate were 7.63% total 

carbon, 95.1% total carbon, 84.0%, and 6.71%, respectively. 

 Screen analyses were conducted on eight survey samples of the combined 

concentrate during the PP-08 to PP-20 runs.  The results indicated that the 80% 

passing particle size of the final concentrates ranged between 203 and 242 μm 

with an average 80% passing particle size of 217 μm.  The average mass 

recovery as a proportion of total concentrate to the +80 mesh, -80 mesh to 

+150 mesh, and -150 mesh size fractions was 31.3%, 25.6%, and 43.1%, 

respectively.  The average final concentrate graded 95.6% total carbon. 

 The average final concentrate grade derived from grab sample assays was 

95.6% total carbon, which was consistent with the average grade from the 

survey samples at 95.1% total carbon.  The average final concentrate grade of 

the pilot plant was also consistent with the concentrate grade obtained from 

bench test F1 at 94.4% total carbon.  However, the recovery of the pilot plant 

was 6.5% higher than the bench test. 

A review of the size fraction analyses of the pilot plant surveys reveals consistent 

results between the laboratory and the pilot plant testing and indicates that that the 

majority of the impurities reported to the finer than 200 mesh size fraction.  The 

enrichment of impurities in the finer size fractions is characteristic for graphite 

deposits that impurities are entrained on the surface of the graphite flakes rather 

than intercalated within the graphite flake.

13.2.4 CONCENTRATE UPGRADING TESTS 

SGS conducted preliminary chemical upgrading tests on different graphite flotation 

concentrates to remove silicates and other impurities from the graphite flotation 

concentrate.  Two methods were evaluated in the upgrading test: 

 Hydrofluoric acid leaching 

 Alkaline roasting followed by hydrofluoric acid leaching. 

Preliminary thermal upgrading tests have also been conducted, including a preliminary 

test by a commercial processor of synthetic nuclear graphite using a proprietary thermal 

upgrading process on a randomly selected flotation concentrate sample produced from 

the pilot plant flotation trials at SGS. 

HYDROMETALLURGICAL UPGRADING 

The +48 mesh graphite flotation concentrate that was generated in the first SGS flotation 

test F1 under SGS program 14185-001 on samples was treated by two different 

hydrometallurgical leaching methods. The objective was to determine the maximum 

concentrate grade that could be achieved with a flotation concentrate grading 94.4% 

total carbon and 93.5% graphitic carbon. 

The hydrofluoric acid leaching test was conducted in two stages.  The first stage involved 

mixing the feed sample with concentrated sulphuric acid (96% sulphuric acid) and water 

before concentrated hydrofluoric acid (48% hydrofluoric acid) was added to the mixture.  

The resulting slurry was heated to 90°C.  After 300 minutes, water was added to the 

slurry.  The slurry was stirred for an additional 60 minutes at 90°C.  At the completion of 

the test, the slurry was filtered and the residue was thoroughly washed before the 

upgraded graphite was subjected to chemical analysis.  The test conditions and test 

results are shown in Table 13.9 and Table 13.10, respectively. The purified concentrate 

was subjected to total carbon, graphitic carbon and double LOI analysis.  Depending on 

the method, the results ranged between 99.2% graphitic carbon and 100% total carbon.

ALKALINE ROASTING + HYDROFLUORIC ACID LEACHING 

Another sample of the flotation concentrate which was subjected to the hydrofluoric acid 

leach described above, was also submitted to a 2-stage hydrometallurgical process 

consisting of an alkaline roast and hydrofluoric leach.  

The alkaline roasting process consisted of a caustic bake followed by a dilute acid 

leaching.  The caustic bake was conducted at a temperature of 400°C in a muffle 

furnace after the graphite concentrate was mixed with sodium hydroxide in solution.  The 

baked mixture was then subjected to a water leach with deionized water followed by an 

acid leach with 10% sulphuric acid.     

In the second processing stage, the remaining residue was further leached with a 

hydrofluoric acid/sulphuric acid mixture to remove any remaining impurities.  The test 

conditions and results are shown in Table 13.11 and Table 13.12 respectively.

The two-stage caustic roasted/acid leached sample was submitted for full chemical 

analysis using GDMS analysis technology.  Total measured elemental impurities were 

246 ppm by weight, thus corresponding to a concentrate grade of approximately 99.97% 

total carbon.   

In October 2014, SGS conducted another caustic bake test followed by dilute acid 

washing on a flotation concentrate sample collected from the pilot plant campaign PP-10. 

This is the same campaign that generated the flotation samples that were subjected to 

GDMS analysis. The purification work involved a three step process:  

 caustic baking at 400°C 

 washing of the baked product 

 dilute sulphuric acid leach and wash to neutralize any residual caustic soda and 

to remove impurities which are insoluble in caustic solution. 

The flotation concentrates prior to purification and the caustic bake upgraded 

concentrate were screened into five particle size fractions.  The five size fractions of the 

flotation concentrate and the purified graphite were subjected to purity assessment by 

GDMS. The analysis results are shown in Table 13.13. 

The carbon purities of the flotation concentrate ranged between 98.43% for the -325 

mesh product and 99.85% for the -48/+80 mesh size fraction.  The Equivalent Boron 

Content (EBC) ranged between 1.351 ppm and 6.881 ppm.  The carbon purities 

increased to 99.979% for the -325 mesh size fraction and were as high as 99.9942% for 

the -80/+150 mesh size fraction. The mass-weighted average carbon purity for the entire 

sample was 99.9925%.  Using the GDMS results, the EBC value was estimated in a range 

from 0.720 to 0.824 ppm for the individual size fractions.

Notes: 1Carbon purity was calculated by difference, 100% minus (sum of all impurity concentrations (%)). 

 Reported carbon purity values were rounded to two significant digits. Reported GDMS elemental 

 contaminant concentrations when added to  the reported carbon purities, may not add to 100%, 

 due to rounding error. Only the actual concentration of the various elements is considered and not 

 their oxide form. 

 2Equivalent Boron Content (EBC) of the graphite is calculated from the impurity concentrations 

 obtained by GDMS, as defined in ASTM Method C1233-09, "Standard Practice for Determining 

 Equivalent Boron Contents of Nuclear Materials", in conjunction with ASTM Standard D7219-08, 

 "Standard Specification for Isotropic and Near-isotropic Nuclear Graphites", which lists the 16 

 elements of concern with respect to the EBC criterion. EBC is a means of estimating the potential 

 for the impurities contained in the graphite to absorb neutrons when exposed to the controlled 

neutron flux within a nuclear reactor. Any impurities absorbing neutrons would adversely affect the 

rate and the control of the nuclear chain reaction. EBC is calculated as the sum of the EBC of each 

impurity, such that EBC (impurity) = (EBC factor for impurity) multiplied by (concentration of impurity 

(ppm)). Each EBC factor was obtained from Table 1 of ASTM Method C1233-09. Desired maximum 

EBC levels are typically between 1 and 3 ppm, depending on the specifications of end-users. 

THERMAL UPGRADING 

In 2013 EAG conducted a rapid thermal upgrading (RTU) test on a coarser than 65 mesh 

(210 µm) flotation concentrate produced by a bench-scale scoping level flotation 

program under SGS Project 14185-001.  RTU is a method for quickly eliminating heat-

labile impurities from a graphite sample by exposing the sample to high heat in the 

presence of an inert atmosphere.  The thermal upgrading results by the RTU procedure 

show that the total impurity concentration can be reduced from 609 to 236 ppm, after a 

three minute heat treatment at a temperature of 2,300°C in a helium atmosphere. 

The sample that was subjected to two-stage caustic roast/acid leaching described in 

section 13.2.4 was further treated by the rapid thermal upgrading conducted by EAG 

using the following conditions: 

 flowing helium atmosphere (100 mL/min) 

 temperature of 2,000 to 2,200°C 

 suration of 10 minutes. 

Total measured impurities after heat treatment were less than 23 ppm, compared to 

greater than 246 ppm impurities by weight before heat treatment.  More than 90% of the 

contaminants were removed from by rapid thermal upgrading, yielding carbon purity of 

99.9978%.

Specific elements which were found in the pre-treated sample, but no longer detectable 

after thermal treatment  included  chromium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, 

manganese, phosphorus, strontium, titanium, yttrium, zinc, and zirconium. In addition, 

aluminum, boron, calcium, chlorine, silicon, sodium, and sulphur were also reduced 

significantly (decreased by 50% or more). 

In 2015, a randomly selected sample of the flotation concentrate (96.6% total carbon)  

produced from pilot plant flotation trial PP-10 conducted at SGS was treated by a 

proprietary thermal upgrading process employed by a commercial processor of synthetic 

nuclear graphite.  After the concentrate sample was dried in an oven, the sample was 

thermally treated and upgraded to approximately 99.9998% total carbon purity without a 

hydrometallurgical process.  The thermal upgrading test was conducted at a temperature 

of approximately 2,200 to 2,300°C in an inert atmosphere. 

The GDMS assay showed that ultra-trace amounts of six elemental contaminants were 

detected: 

 boron 100 ppb 

 sodium 400 ppb 

 copper 100 ppb 

 zinc 80 ppb 

 iron 90 ppb 

 silicon 1,700 ppb. 

In 2015 a further thermal upgrading test was conducted using the proprietary thermal 

upgrading procedure by the commercial nuclear graphite processor.  The concentrate 

used for the testing was blended from the concentrates generated from two bench-scale 

flotation tests under SGS program 14185-005 on a sample with a calculated head grade 

of 0.53% graphitic carbon. The average grade of the blended concentrate was 

approximately 96% total carbon.  The upgrading tests yielded graphite of approximately 

99.9995% total carbon purity, with an EBC value of 0.917 ppm, as determined by GDMS. 

The GDMS analysis revealed the ultra-trace concentrations of nine elements:  

 boron 300 ppb 

 sodium 500 ppb  

 aluminum 100 ppb 

 silicon 3,000 ppb 

 phosphorus 200 ppb 

 potassium 200 ppb 

 calcium 600 ppb 

 iron 90 ppb

 tungsten 200 ppb. 

Canada Carbon assumes that the contaminants identified following thermal treatment 

may associate with the hydrothermal matrix, rather than with the crystalline graphite 

itself, due to the high correlation between silicon content and all other measured 

elemental contaminants. 

13.2.5 OTHER GRAPHITE CHARACTERIZATION TESTS 

EAG also performed a laboratory characterization test on a Miller graphite sample 

provided by Canada Carbon to acquire a Raman spectrum.  The crystallinity results were 

obtained using Raman spectroscopy, which is able to definitively determine the degree of 

crystallinity of certain materials, including graphite.  Raman spectroscopy is the collection 

of light inelastically scattered by a material or compound.  When a light of known 

wavelength strikes a material, the light is shifted according to the chemical functionalities 

of the material.  The intensity of this shifted light depends on both molecular structure 

and macrostructure.  As a result of these phenomena, the collection of the shifted light 

gives a Raman spectrum that can provide direct information regarding the molecular 

vibrations of the compound or material. 

The crystallinity characterization was measured using a "LabRam" J-Y Spectrometer using 

an argon+ ion laser (514.5 nm wavelength) an 1,800 gr/mm grating.  The Raman 

spectra were collected in the backscattering geometry (1,800) under an Olympus BX40 

microscope. 

The key spectral features collected were the G-band (1,579 cm-1) and D-band 

(1,350 cm-1), where the G-band is theoretically the only permitted band arising from a 

single crystal of graphite, and the D-band is a measure of the disorder within the crystal. 

The sharp, high-intensity, narrow-shouldered G-band peak strongly suggests that the 

sample is a single crystal of graphite.  The D band was barely detected at 1,350 cm-1 

which indicates extremely low disorder in that crystal.  The spectrum acquired from a 

flake of the sample is shown in Figure 13.10.  EAG indicated that the Raman spectrum 

clearly demonstrates that the graphite in the sample is very high quality single crystal 

graphite.

Marble blocks were extracted and sent for assessments as architectural marble

absorption, surface hardness, texture, colour, are available for the review. 

13.4 CONCLUSIONS 

The Miller graphite samples tested to-date responded well to traditional mineral 

processing technologies consisting of grinding and froth flotation.  A simple reagent 

regime consisting of fuel oil #2 as the collector and MIBC as the frother proved effective 

to achieve high concentrate grades with good overall carbon recoveries.  

Samples from the Miller graphite prospect submitted to metallurgical testing covered a 

wide range from 0.53% graphitic carbon to 61.2% graphitic carbon. Liberation and 

upgrading of the medium and large graphite flakes has been demonstrated consistently 

for all samples that have been evaluated in a series of laboratory scale and pilot scale 

metallurgical programs.  The fine fractions of less than 200 mesh contain the largest 

amount of impurities and range between approximately 85% and 95% total carbon.  

Processing of the fines fraction was carried out using a conventional polishing grind 

approach with ½" ceramic media in a mill without lifters.  While this type of polishing mill 

proved very effective for the medium and coarse flake sizes and resulted in concentrate 

grades of greater than 97% total carbon, the grinding conditions were not as effective for 

the fine fractions.  Alternative grinding technologies were developed at SGS in Lakefield 

in 2015 to improve the liberation properties for fine graphite flakes and intercalated 

graphite.  These grinding technologies are expected to be more suitable for the treatment 

of the Miller small graphite flakes as well. 

Since polishing grind times are directly proportional to the amount of material feeding 

into the mill, a mining block model should be generated to establish an upper, lower, and 

average head grade for the mill feed.  Any process optimization should be carried out 

using a Master composite that represents the average head grade to the mill and 

consideration of the nameplate capacity of the proposed plant to ensure proper 

equipment sizing. 

 While the relative measurement uncertainties of standard analytical methods for total 

carbon and graphitic carbon generally do not constitute a concern, the high concentrate 

grades obtained for medium and coarse graphite flakes in the Miller flotation concentrate 

as well as the purified product render these methods inaccurate.  An alternative 

analytical method in the form of GDMS analysis has proven effective in quantifying the 

type and level of impurities associated with the graphite concentrates.   

Preliminary chemical and thermal upgrading trials proved effective in removing the 

majority of impurities remaining after the flotation process to produce graphite 

concentrates meeting nuclear graphite purity standards.  While chemical upgrading was 

explored early in the project, thermal upgrading proved to be even more effective and led 

to a concentrate purity of 99.9998% in a 2015 upgrading trial.  The six main remaining

elemental impurities were detected at concentrations ranging between 80 and 1700 

ppb, totalling 2,470 ppb.  Similar results were obtained following thermal treatment of 

flotation concentrate obtained from bench scale processing of low grade disseminated 

graphite in marble. 

The characterization of the potential marble source is preliminary in nature.  Since 

marble is another industrial mineral that requires a close relationship between the 

producer and buyer, any further characterization work is expected to be carried out in 

close cooperation with the potential off-take partner(s).

14.0  MINERAL RESOURCE EST IMATES  

The Mineral Resource estimate was conducted using the CIM Definitions Standards for 

Mineral Resources in accordance with NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 

Projects. Mineral Resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated 

economic viability. Inferred Mineral Resources are exclusive of the Measured and 

Indicated Resources. The Mineral Resource estimation work for the Project was 

conducted by Jean-Philippe Paiement, M.Sc., P.Geo. The 3D modelling, geostatistics, and 

grade interpolation of the block model was conducted using Genesis© software 

developed by SGS. The optimized pit shells and cut-off grade estimation were conducted 

by Tetra Tech. These pit shells are used to report Mineral Resources. The Mineral 

Resource estimation process was reviewed internally by Yann Camus, Eng, from SGS. 

Two independent types of resources are estimated in this section and are exclusive of 

each other. Given the results from the metallurgical testing (see Section 13) of low-grade 

graphite samples and the price of the commodity (see Section 19.0), disseminated and 

vein (pod) hosted graphite can be considered as Mineral Resources. Following a letter of 

intent signed for the purchase of white marble, white marble can be considered for 

architectural marble block Mineral Resources.  

14.1 DATABASE 

The final database used for the Mineral Resource estimation was transmitted to SGS by 

Canada Carbon on December 10, 2015 in Microsoft® Excel format. The different 

validation and iteration steps are discussed in Section 12. The database comprised 95 

drillholes, 40 surface samples, and 49 channels (Figure 14.1) with entries for: 

 down hole survey (n = 560) 

 assays (n = 7,985) 

 lithologies (n = 966). 

The database was validated upon importation in Genesis©, which enabled the correction 

of minor discrepancies between the table entries, surveys, and lithologies.  

Vertical sections were generated, oriented N035° in order to respect and follow the 

drilling pattern and the general trend of the marble unit. In general, the sections have a 

20 m spacing between them (Figure 14.2). 

Two topographic surfaces were transferred to SGS by Canada Carbon; a local light 

detecting and ranging (LIDAR) and a regional digital evaluation model (DEM). Both 

surfaces were merged to create a single surface with priority given to the LIDAR surface. 

The surface was processed and normalized in order to correct the distortion in the edges

(Figure 14.3). A surface representing the contact between overburden and fresh rock was 

also generated using the lithological entries. Average overburden thickness is 

approximately 1.54 m with increasing thickness towards the southwest (Figure 14.4).

14.2 GEOLOGICAL MODEL 

Since most of the mineralization is found in marbles or at the contact of marble and 

other rock units, and since white marble poses potential for architectural stones, the 

marble rock unit needed to be modelled. Due to the low density of the drilling grid and 

limited coverage of 3D geological information (Figure 14.1), an effort was made to 

incorporate the geophysical survey results in the modelling process. A 3D inversion 

model of the airborne magnetic response survey was transmitted to SGS by Canada 

Carbon. The magnetic data was combined with the lithological observations made at the 

surface and in the drillholes to verify the possibility of using a magnetic threshold to map 

the marble rock unit (Figure 14.5). This enabled the author to assign a modelled 

magnetic susceptibility value to each rock type in surface and drillhole data. The 

magnetic susceptibility values were then compared from one rock type to another and a 

limit of 0.006 on the International System of Units (SI) was established as the limit 

between non-magnetic rocks (marble and skarn; Figure 14.6) and magnetic rocks 

(arkose and paragneiss; Figure 14.6). This limit was modelled in the 3D inversion data, 

providing a probable contact surface between marbles (and skarns) and host rocks 

(Figure 14.7).  

The marble unit had to be modeled for architectural rock resources. The magnetic 

contact surface was then combined with the drilling database to model the extent of the 

marble unit, as identified by the level of information in the data. Two dimensional 

interpretations were conducted on each vertical section using the lithologies and 

magnetic contact surface in which only the marble was highlighted and all other 

lithologies were considered as non-marble (waste: Figure 14.8).  

A 3D solid was then generated, corresponding to the marble rock unit interpretation, 

based on geophysical (magnetic) evidences and drillhole data (Figure 14.9). 

Extrapolation of the marble unit was limited to 100 m beyond the last information point 

and interpolation of the solid (between two points of information) was limited at 150 m. 

The solid corresponding to the marble rock type (Figure 14.9) will be further used to 

estimate the marble architectural rock resources.

14.3 MINERALIZED INTERVALS AND MINERALIZED SOLIDS 

14.3.1 GRAPHITE MINERALIZATION 

Mineralized intervals corresponding to an average grade of combined assays were 

generated following the limits of the geological envelopes and a minimal grade of 0.5% 

graphitic carbon. The modelling of the minimal grade was established in order to limit the 

amount of waste material included in the mineralized solids and from the graphite values

observed in the geological model (Figure 14.10). In the event that a single hole in the 

middle of a geological envelope was lower than the minimal modelling grade, the hole 

was still integrated in the solids and is considered as internal waste. The mineralized 

intervals have an average graphitic carbon value of 0.85% (minimum: 0% graphitic 

carbon and maximum: 49.7% graphitic carbon) with an average length of 17.63 m 

(minimum: 0.1 m and maximum: 71.72 m).  

Based on the mineralized intervals (Figure 14.11) and geological solids modelled for the 

marble, solids were digitized on each section. The solids are extrapolated to a maximum 

of 50 m from the last point of intersection and interpolated on a maximal distance of 

75 m between points of information. The solid apexes were snapped to the mineralized 

intervals. A single mineralized solid was generated (Figure 14.13) with an extent of 885 

m along strike, a maximum extent of 240 m across, and an approximate vertical 

thickness of 70 m. The solid has a volume of 4.3 Mm3.

14.4 COMPOSITING OF ASSAYS 

14.4.1 GRAPHITE MINERALIZATION 

The assays present inside the limits of the mineralized intervals were re-divided in equal 

length composites of 1.5 m, which represent the largest and second most common assay 

length in the database (Figure 14.14). They also represent a proper size compared to the 

selected block size (see below). These composites will be used to interpolate the block 

values. Assay gaps inside the solids were replaced with composites with values of 0% 

graphitic carbon. A total of 2,090 composites were generated for a total length of 

3,135 m (Figure 14.15).

Figure 14.15 Graphite Composite Set 

 

14.4.2 ARCHITECTURAL MARBLE 

A second set of composites were generated for the architectural marble. The lithological 

entries from the database were sub-divided into 1.5-m intervals and only the interval 

inside the marble unit solid (Figure 14.9) were kept as composites. The values of the 

composite were derived from the color logging provided by Canada Carbon. Since only 

the white colored marble is acceptable for architectural stone production, the composites 

within white colored intervals were coded with "1" and the other composites were coded 

with "0"; creating an indicator variable named "SLABprob". The indicator represents the 

probability of the rock being white marble (suitable for architectural blocks production); 

where "1" represents 100% probability of encountering white marble and "0" represents 

0% probability of encountering white marble. A total of 3,685 composites were generated 

for a total length of 5,527.5 m (Figure 14.16).

14.5 GEOSTATISTICS AND VARIOGRAPHY 

In order to interpolate the different potential mineral resources, the composites were 

independently analyzed using standard statistic tools and variography. These steps allow 

for validation of the compositing process and mineralized solids generation. The 

mathematical models derived from the variograms will be used to interpolate the blocks 

using Ordinary Kriging and Indicator Kriging. The exercise was performed for: 1) graphitic 

carbon (Cg%) and 2) white marble indicators. 

14.5.1 GRAPHITIC CARBON 

The composites corresponding to the graphite mineralization have an average value of 

0.81% graphitic carbon (Table 14.1). The distribution of the values outlines three 

different populations within the graphite mineralization (Figure 14.17): 1) a population 

corresponding to the local integration of waste material in the solids and missing assay  

intervals within the solids; 2) a population representing the majority of the assay value, 

which can be considered as a disseminated low grade graphite mineralization and 3) a 

high-grade population representing the discontinuous veins and pods of graphite 

observed throughout the Miller Property. 

The presence of the high-grade pods would be lost if conventional interpolation is used, 

since they only represent 7% of the population. A two-stage interpolation using indicators 

and high-grade probability model was used for resources estimation in order to present a 

more realistic model without exaggerated dilution and smoothing.  

In order to proceed with this type of interpolation, the composite population needed to be 

divided between low grade and high grade, with a proper limit between both. The high-

grade population was separated from the low-grade population using a process 

comparable to grade capping, in which the "break" in the frequency distribution is

considered the limit between the low grade and high grade (Figure 14.18). This process 

was validated using a histogram modelling technique which establishes the limit between 

the two populations at 2% graphitic carbon (Figure 14.18).  

Three new variables were then added to the composite set. The "GraphiteLG" variable 

corresponds the all the composites capped at a value of 2% graphitic carbon. The 

"GraphiteHG" only contains the composites with values greater than 2% graphitic carbon 

and finally the "Indicator" variable contains "0" if the original graphite value is below 2% 

graphitic carbon and "1" if the original graphite value is equal or greater than 2% 

graphitic carbon.

GRAPHITELG VARIABLE 

The GraphiteLG variable shows a skewed distribution towards the low values (Figure 

14.19) with a mean value of 0.6% graphitic carbon (Table 14.1). The composites were 

used to generate a variogram with directions aligned along the strike of the deposit and 

45° across the deposit in both northeast and southwest directions (Figure 14.19). The 

average variogram was also generated using mostly pairs along the same drillhole (Figure 

14.19). The nugget effect is limited to 20%, due to the relatively low variance generated 

by capping of the high-grade population at 2% graphitic carbon. The major direction of 

continuity dips at -45° towards the southwest along the strike, which has a sill at 0.4 for 

a range of 35 m and a maximum range of 35 m (Figure 14.19). The other directions show 

relatively low continuity with 60% of the sill with a range of 7 m (Figure 14.19). The model 

of the variogram is given by the following equation: 

Gamma = N (0.2) + S (0.4, 35/7/7, 225/-45/90) + S (0.4, 35/30/25, 225/-45/90) 

The variogram maximal ranger is smaller than the largest extrapolation and interpolation 

distance of the mineralized solid.

GRAPHITEHG VARIABLE 

The GraphiteHG variable shows a skewed distribution towards the low values (Figure 

14.20) with a mean value of 5.92% graphitic carbon (Table 14.1). The composites were 

used to generate a variogram with directions aligned along the strike of the deposit and 

45° across the deposit in both northeast and southwest directions (Figure 14.20). The 

average variogram was also generated using mostly pairs along the same drillhole (Figure 

14.20). The nugget effect is of 55%, which can be explained by the relatively low 

geological continuities of the high-grade veins and pods. The variographic model is 

isotropic with 85% of the sill at a range of 4 m and a maximum range of 8 m (Figure 

14.20). The model of the variogram is given by the following equation: 

Gamma = N (0.55) + S (0.3, 4/4/4, 0/0/0) + S (0.15, 8/8/8, 0/0/0)

The relatively low range of the variographic model might be due to low number of 

composites used (113), but also dictates low interpolation distances for the GraphiteHG 

variable, which is consistent with the geological observation of discontinuous pods and 

veins. 

INDICATOR VARIABLE 

The Indicator variable shows a skewed distribution towards the 0 values (Figure 14.21) 

with a mean value of 0.05 (Table 14.1); which is consistent with the majority of the 

graphite mineralization comprising low grade values. The composites were used to 

generate a variogram with directions aligned along the strike of the deposit and 45° 

across the deposit in both northeast and southwest directions (Figure 14.21). The 

average variogram was also generated using mostly pairs along the same drill hole 

(Figure 14.21). The nugget effect is limited to 25%, due to the relatively low variance 

generated by the high number of 0's in the values. The major direction of continuity is at -

45° towards the southwest, which has a sill at 0.5 for a range of 10 m and a maximum 

range of 30 m (Figure 14.21). The other directions show relatively low continuity with 

75% of the sill with a range of 4 m and 2 m (Figure 14.21). The model of the variogram is 

given by the following equation: 

Gamma = N (0.25) + S (0.5, 10/4/2, 225/-45/0) + S (0.25, 30/20/8, 225/-45/0) 

The variogram maximal range is smaller than the largest extrapolation and interpolation 

distance of the mineralized solid.

14.5.2 ARCHITECTURAL MARBLE (SLABPROB) 

The composites corresponding to the architectural marble have an average value of 0.09 

(Table 14.2).  Based on the entire drilling data, more than 90% of the drilled lithologies 

are not suitable marble for architectural slab production (Figure 14.22). The composites 

were used to generate an average variogram using mostly pairs along the same drill hole 

(Figure 14.22). The nugget effect is limited to 5% due to the relatively low variance 

generated by the high number of 0's in the values. The variogram shows relatively low 

continuity with 65% of the sill with a range of 8 m (Figure 14.22) and a maximum 

continuity of 40 m. The model of the variogram is given by the following equation: 

Gamma = N (0.05) + S (0.6, 8/8/8, 0/0/0) + S (0.35, 40/40/40, 0/0/0)

14.6 DENSITY 

In order to convert the volumes of the block models to tonnages in the Mineral Resource 

reporting, density measurements were conducted by Canada Carbon on witness core 

samples in the marble rock unit. A total of 48 measurements were made using the dry 

and immersed weights. 

The density values vary from 2.59 to 2.98 t/m3 with an average value of 2.81 t/m3 

(Figure 14.23). Given the low number of measurements and their distribution in space, it 

is not possible to interpolated the densities or correlate them to the graphite grades. 

Hence, a fixed density of 2.81 t/m3 was applied to all material in the block model. 

In the future, more density measurements should be conducted and should be 

appropriately spaced along the drilling grid and distributed between the different rock 

types. The density poses a significant risk factor in the tonnage estimates of the mineral 

resources and should be better constrained with the project's advancements. Additional 

density measurements will be conducted on the different lithologies and grade material 

in further exploration campaigns.

14.7 BLOCK MODEL 

A block model was generated within the limits stated in Table 14.3. A total of 179,356 

blocks were generated within the limits of the marble unit and graphite model combined 

(Figure 14.24). The blocks were limited at surface to the rock overburden interface. The 

volume of the block model is 136,452,000 m3.

14.7.1 SEARCH ELLIPSOIDS 

Given the continuity observed in the variographic studies, the sparse drilling grid, and the 

geological observations, three different search ellipsoids were used in the interpolation 

process (Figure 14.25). The Pass 1 search ellipsoid was designed to represent the low 

continuity in the data and interpolated blocks using a limited distance and composites 

inside that particular block, thus limiting the smoothing effect. The Pass 2 and Pass 3 

ellipses were designed to enable interpolation on a broader distance with Pass 3 limited 

to the maximum extrapolation and interpolation in the mineralized solids.

14.8.1 GRAPHITE MINERALIZATION INTERPOLATION 

The different variables created in the compositing process were interpolated within the 

limits of the graphite mineralization solid (Figure 14.13). All the blocks inside the solid 

were interpolated using the parameters in Table 14.4 for the GraphiteLG variable. The 

GraphiteHG and Indicator (high-grade probability) were restricted to smaller search 

ellipsoids (Table 14.4) due to the discontinuous nature of the high-grade mineralization. 

The three different variables were then used to re-calculate the graphite percentage 

(graphitic carbon) of each block. The GraphiteLG representing the bulk disseminated 

mineralization in the marble was then combined with the high-grade model (GraphiteHG) 

using the probability that the given block is actually high-grade material (Indicator). The 

final graphitic carbon grade of the block was calculated as follows: 

Standard Interpolation Selective Indicators Grade source

0% high grade probability One grade One grade Low grade Interpolation

10% high grade probability One grade One grade Low grade Interpolation

20% high grade probability One grade One grade Low grade Interpolation

30% high grade probability One grade One grade Low grade Interpolation

40% high grade probability One grade Two grade High + Low grade Interpolation

50% high grade probability One grade Two grade High + Low grade Interpolation

60% high grade probability One grade Two grade High + Low grade Interpolation

70% high grade probability One grade One grade High grade Interpolation

80% high grade probability One grade One grade High grade Interpolation

90% high grade probability One grade One grade High grade Interpolation

100% high grade probability One grade One grade High grade Interpolation

Blocks with

 

CgTOTAL = If Indicator <= 0.3, CgTOTAL = GraphiteLG 

CgTOTAL = If  0.7 <= Indicator > 0.3, CgTOTAL = GraphiteLG+(GraphiteHG * Indicator) 

CgTOTAL = If Indicator > 0.7, CgTOTAL = GraphiteHG 

A total of 45,119 blocks were interpolated with the GraphiteLG variable (Figure 14.26), 

whereas the Indicator variable was only interpolated in 21,375 blocks (Figure 14.26), 

with only 5,267 blocks containing GraphiteHG results (Figure 14.26). All the GraphiteHG 

interpolated blocks have Indicator values ranging from 0.1 to 1.  

All the 45,119 blocks were re-calculated for the CgTOTAL variable with grades ranging 

from 0.02 to 12.92% graphitic carbon, with an average grade of 0.72% graphitic carbon 

(Figure 14.28). Given the statistical distribution of the original assays and composite 

original grades, the block model does not seem to over (or under) estimate the graphite 

grades (Figure 14.28). Furthermore, a good correlation is observed between the block 

grades and the composites located inside those blocks (Figure 14.28). Lastly, the swath 

plot makes for an acceptable level of smoothing and grade value across the x, y and z 

axis of the deposit (Figure 14.29). 

Caution needs to be taken with the block grade located around the three channel 

samples at VN6-3, where the interpolation creates a significant volume of high-grade 

blocks with no drilling information constraining the values (Figure 14.27).  Classification

the next drilling campaign (completed in January 2016); which aims at better defining 

this area for the next Mineral Resource estimation.

14.8.2 ARCHITECTURAL MARBLE BLOCK INTERPOLATION 

The variables created to represent the probability of encountering white marble 

(SLABprob) were interpolated within the limits of the entire block model. A total of 

167,958 blocks inside the model were interpolated using the parameters in Table 14.4. 

The blocks that were not interpolated were given a probability of "0".   

All the 179,356 blocks in the model have a SLABprob variable with values ranging from 0 

to 1, with an average grade of 0.1. The distribution of the blocks seems adequate given 

the statistical distribution of the composite indicator values (90% of "0"). Furthermore, a 

good visual correlation is observed between the block with SLABprob >0.9 and the 

composites with indicators at 1 (Figure 14.28).  

The block values associated with composites not classified as white marble are 85% of 

the time interpolated with a value of 0 (Figure 14.31) and 99% of the time with values 

lower than 0.5 (Figure 14.31). This is considered acceptable since the smoothing created 

by interpolation does not seem to create too many "false" positives". The blocks with an 

estimated SLABprob value above 0.6 (1% or less of false positives in the interpolation) 

were then considered as white marble, suitable for architectural stone.

14.9 BLOCK MODEL CLASSIFICATION 

Given the drilling grid in relation to the observed continuity on the geological and 

statistical scale, the Mineral Resources comprising the current block model will all be 

classified as Inferred. 

This classification is also in line with the quality of the data stated in Sections 11.0 and 

12.0 and with the presence of surface samples in the database. Furthermore, the author

is cautious with the parameter to qualify the marble quality (white colored marble) due to 

the limitation of color logging with the human eye.   The cut-off of 0.6 probability used to 

classify the blocks is adequate for the Inferred category. 

Subsequent work phases could increase the confidence level of the Mineral Resources 

for both graphite and marble resources.  The marble Mineral Resource classification 

could benefit from logging using a technology able to differentiate rock colors using an 

empirical variable (i.e. Corescan©), as proposed in the recommendation section of this 

report.  An increase of drilling grid coverage and in QA/QC sample insertion, coupled with 

the removal of punctual surface samples from the database is required in order to 

increase the Mineral Resources classification to Indicated or Measured. 

14.10 OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURES AND PARAMETERS 

Two separate open pit optimizations were conducted on the Project to validate the 

Mineral Resources under the NI 43-101 requirements of "reasonable prospect of 

eventual economic extraction" (CIM 2012) for Mineral Resource reporting purposes. A 

first scenario was conducted using the graphite Mineral Resources, in which the CgTOTAL 

variable was used to generate optimized shells using the parameters in Table 14.5. This 

scenario produced two separate pits with a cut-off grade estimation at 0.8% graphitic 

carbon (Figure 14.33).  

Once the graphite pits were generated, all the blocks inside those shells were classified 

with a SLABprob of 0 and a second phase of optimization was conducted to establish the 

optimized pit shell for the architectural marble blocks. Only the blocks with SLABprob 

value greater than or equal to 0.6 were considered to be potential ore. The blocks with 

value equal or greater than 0.6 were assigned a value of 184$/t and since the extracted 

blocks are directly sold, no processing costs are estimated (Table 14.6). The blocks 

above the 0.6 SLABprob and within the pit shell will be considered as architectural 

marble resources (Figure 14.34).

14.11 MINERAL RESOURCES 

The pit shells from the optimization scenarios were used to limit the extent of the Mineral 

Resources at depth (Figure 14.33 and Figure 14.34). The mineral resources are stated at 

different cut off grades, depending on the pit in which they are contained. The main two 

graphite pits have a cut-off grade of 0.8% graphitic carbon, whereas the blocks not 

considered architectural marble in the marble pit have a graphite cut-off of 0.4%

graphitic carbon (Table 14.7), since they do not require expenditure to be mined (the 

mining cost is already included in the waste mining cost of the marble pit; Table 14.6.) 

However, architectural blocks within the graphite pit shells cannot be considered in the 

mineral resources due to the waste mining technique not being adapted to extract quality 

blocks in the production.  

The graphite pits contain 952,000 t of Inferred Resources at an average grade of 2.00% 

graphitic carbon (reported at a cut-off grade of 0.8% graphitic carbon) and the marble pit 

comprises 1.18 Mt of Inferred Resources at an average grade of 0.53% graphitic carbon 

(reported at a cut-off grade of 0.4% graphitic carbon; Table 14.7). The marble pit contains 

1.52 Mt of architectural marble with an average probability of white marble at 0.82 

(reported at a minimum probability of 0.6; Table 14.7).

16.0  MINING  METH OD S 

16.1 INTRODUCTION 

Tetra Tech prepared an open pit mining study for the Project, based on a target annual 

production of 1,500 t of refined graphite and 150,000 t of marble blocks.  Canada 

Carbon provided Tetra Tech with a signed letter of intent with a potential mining 

contractor, for mining out graphite material, crushing to finer than 20 mm, hauling to the 

mill, and handling waste rock.  Canada Carbon also provided Tetra Tech with rental rates 

for the leased supporting and ancillary mining equipment, to be utilized for both the 

graphite and marble pits.  This section outlines the input data, procedures and results of 

the mining study. 

16.2 MINING METHOD 

The graphite pit will be mined using a conventional truck/loader open pit mining method.  

The production cycle includes drilling, blasting, loading, and hauling, all of which will be 

performed by a mining contractor. 

Marble will be cut into blocks using a chain saw. First a horizontal bottom section with a 

length of 20 m and a depth of 2.25 m will be cut, then a back vertical section with a 

length of 20 m will be cut at a 2.25 m depth. Wood blocks will be used to prevent the 

marble blocks from falling. Vertical cross sections will be cut at approximately 2-m 

intervals to produce 2.25 m by 2.25 m by 2 m marble blocks. The marble blocks will be 

separated and pushed down over a prepared cushion layer of crushed rocks using 

hydraulic block pushers. A fork loader will be used to load the marble blocks onto a 

flatbed truck for off-site transportation. 

Based on the letter of intent between Canada Carbon and a local quarry company, the 

mining contractor will mine, move, and consume all waste material from the graphite and 

marble pits and pay Canada Carbon $1.00/t of waste. 

16.3 PIT OPTIMIZATION 

Tetra Tech performed open pit optimizations using GEOVIA Whittle™ (Whittle™) software, 

which is based on the Lerchs-Grossmann (LG) optimization algorithm.  Pit optimization 

parameters were prepared based on data provided by Canada Carbon, other consultants, 

technical studies, and experience from other projects.

16.3.1 BLOCK MODEL 

Mineral Resource estimation was performed by SGS (see Section 14.0). SGS provided 

Tetra Tech with a topographical drawing and a 5 m by 5 m by 3 m block model, which 

formed the basis of the open pit optimizations. 

16.3.2 PIT SLOPE ANGLE 

Due to the lack of pit geotechnical studies for the Project, an overall pit slope angle of 

45° was assumed for the graphite pit optimizations and 55° was assumed for the 

marble pit optimizations. 

16.3.3 PIT OPTIMIZATION PARAMETERS 

The economic, technical, and operational parameters, as well as the metallurgical 

recoveries used for pit and mine schedule optimizations are provided in Table 16.1.

16.3.4 PIT OPTIMIZATION RESULTS 

Using the pit optimization parameters in Table 16.1, 33 graphite pit shells were 

generated using Whittle™ software corresponding to price factors ranging between 0.175 

and 1. For the marble pit, 24 pit shells were generated corresponding to price factors 

ranging from 0.3 to 1. The discounted cash flow value of each pit was estimated using a 

discount rate of 10%.  All operating costs in Table 16.1 were considered when estimating 

the discounted values; no capital costs were considered in generating these values.  The 

optimization results for the graphite pit and the marble pit are summarized in Table 16.2 

and Table 16.3, respectively. For graphite, pit 15 was selected as the final pit for further 

design and scheduling, and for marble, pit 17 was selected as the final pit. The criteria 

for selecting these pits was to achieve a high discounted value, while minimizing the pit 

footprints and waste production.

16.4 MINE DESIGN 

16.4.1 BENCH HEIGHT AND PIT WALL SLOPE 

Limited geotechnical data is available for the Project.  Both the graphite and marble pit 

designs are assumed to incorporate a bench height of 15 m, with a minimum berm width 

of 8 m. The inter-ramp angle is assumed to be 45° for the graphite pit and 55° for the 

marble pit. 

16.4.2 HAUL ROAD 

Main haul roads for the Project were designed to accommodate 24-t articulated trucks 

with one-way traffic due to the shallow depth of both pits and small scale operations.  

Ramps are designed with a width of 8 m and a maximum grade of 10%. 

16.4.3 PIT HYDROLOGY/DEWATERING 

No pit hydrology study is included in this PEA; however, an allowance is included in the 

mining operating cost to account for pit dewatering. 

16.4.4 PIT DESIGN RESULTS 

The final graphite pit contains 890,805 t of graphite material grading 1.87% graphitic 

carbon and the final marble pit contains 1,182,037 t of marble.  A material summary 

from the final pits is shown in Table 16.4 and Table 16.5.  Figure 16.1 and Figure 16.2 

show general views of the final graphite and marble pits.

16.5 PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 

The graphite pit mining schedule was developed based on a maximum refined graphite 

capacity of 1,500 t/a.  Production will start at the west pit and continue over four years, 

until the resource within the west pit is exhausted. Mining will then start at the east pit 

and continue until Year 10. Low-grade graphite material from the west pit will be 

stockpiled and used beginning in Year 5 to meet mill capacity and refined graphite 

production limits.  As shown in Table 16.6, the graphite pit will produce 890,805 t of 

graphite material, 1,479,770 t of waste rock, and 158,279 t of overburden over the 10-

year LOM. The LOM stripping ratio is 1.8 and LOM average mill head grade is 1.87% 

graphitic carbon.  Figure 16.3 shows the production schedule indicating the total mined 

waste and total mined mineralized material to be fed to the process plant. 

The marble pit is scheduled to produce a maximum annual marble tonnage of 150,000 t. 

The graphite material contained in the marble pit will be stockpiled and reclaimed 

starting in Year 9. As shown in Table 16.7, the marble pit will produce 1,182,037 t of 

marble, 1,206,051 t of graphite material grading 0.53% graphitic carbon, 5,031,758 t of 

waste, and 210,468 t of overburden over the 8-year LOM. The LOM stripping ratio is 2.2. 

The marble mining schedule is shown in Figure 16.4.

16.6 MINE WASTE ROCK MANAGEMENT 

Over the LOM, the graphite pit and marble pit will produce 1,479,770 t and 5,031,758 t 

of waste rock, respectively. Canada Carbon provided Tetra Tech with a letter of intent 

with a potential mining contractor whereby the mining contractor will move and consume 

all waste material off-site, therefore, no waste rock will be stored on site. 

16.7 MINING EQUIPMENT 

A mining contractor will be used to mine the graphite pit on a unit rate basis. The marble 

blocks within the marble pit will be cut using chain saws to be purchased by Canada 

Carbon. Four chain saw units are required to achieve the target annual production of 

150,000 t of marble rock. Waste rock, graphite material, and overburden will be mined 

by the mining contractor on a unit rate basis. 

Support and ancillary equipment for both the graphite and marble will be leased. Table 

16.8 lists the primary, support, and ancillary equipment. Contractor equipment required 

for mining the graphite pit, waste rock, and overburden are not included as capital costs 

as costing will be on a unit rate ($/t) basis.

16.8 MINING LABOUR 

Chain saw labor requirements were estimated based on a 12-hour shift, 2 shifts per day, 

and a 2-week-on/2-week-off rotation schedule. 

Staff and hourly operating rates are based on the base rates and burdens.  A benefit 

package of 40% was applied to both salaried staff and the hourly labour base rates.  The 

labour burden consists of vacation, statutory holidays, medical and health insurance, 

employment insurance, long-term disability insurance, overtime, shift differential, and 

other factors. 

The mining staff and labour on payroll are shown in Table 16.9. The number in the table 

represents the requirements for chain saws and the general site. Mining of the graphite 

pit, waste rock, and overburden of both the graphite and marble pits will be performed by 

a mining contractor on a unit rate basis. Leased support and ancillary equipment are 

costed on a dollar per hour basis including labor and fuel. Labor requirements of the 

mining contractor, as well as the leased equipment, are not included in Table 16.9.

17.0  RECOV ERY METH OD S  

Graphite has been found as disseminations in marble, in sulphide-bearing paragneiss, in 

pods, and in veins in the Miller deposit.  In known occurrences, the graphite can be alone 

or in association with other minerals, including pyroxene, scapolite, titanite, zircon, and 

wollastonite.  The graphite mostly occurs in well-crystallized euhedral flakes.  Graphite 

and marble are the major economical values contained in the mineralization. 

17.1 GRAPHITE RECOVERY – FLOTATION CONCENTRATION 

17.1.1 INTRODUCTION 

The proposed graphite concentrator at the mine site will be conventional and will process 

graphite mineralization at a nominal rate of 200 t/d with an equipment availability of 

88% (365 d/a).  The concentrator is planned to expand to a nominal throughput of 

approximately 499 t/d in the late stages of the mine life.  The concentrator will use 

conventional flotation technology to produce three graphite concentrates, each with a 

different particle size.  The concentrates will be hauled to a thermal upgrading plant 

located at the Asbury site for further upgrading to the final graphite product containing 

higher than 99.99% graphitic carbon.  The designed annual production rate of the high-

purity graphite product is 1,500 t/a. 

The concentrator feed will be supplied from the Miller open pits, described in Section 

16.0. 

17.1.2 SUMMARY 

The process flowsheet developed for the Miller graphite mineralization consists of 

conventional multi-stages of grinding and flotation processes.  The processing plant will 

produce three different particle size graphite flotation concentrates containing 

approximately 95% graphitic carbon.  The processing plant is estimated to produce 

approximately 1,650 t/a of flotation concentrate from the mill feeds, grading from 0.5 to 

2.6% graphitic carbon.  The estimated graphite recoveries reporting to the flotation 

concentrates range from 85 to 88%.  The processing plant will consist of: 

 crushing plant by a mining contractor 

 crushed materials storage and re-handling system  

 a surge bin with a live capacity of 200 t on surface 

 a primary grinding circuit integrated with flash flotation  

 bulk rougher flotation and scavenger flotation concentrate regrinding

 bulk cleaner flotation followed by cleaner concentrate classification 

 cleaner concentrate polishing regrinding 

 refloating of the reground concentrates 

 concentrate dewatering 

 flotation tailings dewatering and dry stacking. 

The final flotation concentrate will be dewatered, bagged, and trucked to the thermal 

upgrading plant for further upgrading at the Asbury site, located at approximately 150 km 

northwest of the Miller site. 

The flotation tailings will be thickened, filtered, and stacked at the tailings management 

facility located at the proposed mine site.  The tailings are planned to be backfilled to the 

excavated pits when any of the pits cease operation.  The overflows from the concentrate 

and tailings thickeners will be recycled as process make-up water. 

The simplified flotation plant flowsheet at the Miller site is shown in Figure 17.1.

17.1.3 PLANT DESIGN CRITERIA 

The plant is designed to process 200 t/d in the initial years and then increase to 

approximately 499 t/d when the low-grade materials are fed to the plant late in the LOM.  

The mill feed will be concentrated by flotation and the flotation concentrates will be 

further upgraded by thermal treatment.  The major criteria used in the primary grinding 

and flotation circuits is outlined in Table 17.1.

17.1.4 PROCESSING PLANT DESCRIPTION 

PRIMARY CRUSHING (BY CONTRACTOR) 

A mining contractor will carry out the primary crushing.  The mining contractor will crush 

the material from the graphite pits to 80% passing approximately 12 mm.  The crushed 

material will be hauled to the mill feed stockpile at the graphite flotation plant site. 

MILL FEED RECLAIM AND SURGE BIN 

The rod mill feed surge bin is designed to have a live capacity of 200 t.  The crushed 

product from the mill feed stockpile will be reclaimed by a front-end loader to a dump 

pocket, and then conveyed to the 200-t mill feed surge bin.

The crushed material from the mill feed surge bin will then be reclaimed by a belt feeder 

into the rod mill feed chute at a nominal rate of 9.5 t/h (at a mill feed rate of 200 t/d).  A 

belt weight scale will be installed to control the mill feed rate. 

A dust suppression system will be installed at the dump pocket to control fugitive dust 

that may be generated while transporting the crushed material. 

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY GRINDING, CLASSIFICATION AND FLASHING FLOTATION 

A rod mill grinding circuit is proposed for primary grinding.  The circuit will include two rod 

mills in series and two flash flotation cells to recover coarse graphite flakes that are 

liberated or partially liberated from their host minerals. 

The crushed material from the surge bin will be reclaimed by a belt feeder into a tire-

driven rod mill with an installed power of 75 kW.  The rod mill will be in closed circuit with 

a vibrating screen with a slot opening of 1.65 mm.  The rod mill discharge will be pumped 

to the screen feed box and the oversize from the screen will return back to the rod feed 

chute by gravity.  The screen undersize will be sent to the flash flotation circuit where 

liberated or partially liberated graphite flakes will be floated.  Fuel oil will be added as 

collector and MIBC as frother.  The flash flotation concentrate will be sent to the 

downstream bulk flotation circuit while the flash flotation tailings will be further ground in 

the secondary grinding circuit. 

The secondary grinding circuit will also be operated in closed circuit with a vibrating 

screen with a slot opening of 0.35 mm.  A tire-driven rod mill with an installed power of 

150 kW is proposed for the circuit.  The product from the rod mill will be pumped into the 

feed box of the vibrating screen.  The screen undersize or the product of the secondary 

grinding circuit will be 80% passing 250 µm.  The screen undersize will report to the 

graphite bulk rougher flotation circuit.  The screen oversize will return back to the 

secondary grinding rod mill feed chute. 

Steel rods will be manually added into the mills on a batch basis as grinding media. 

Dilution water will be added to the primary and secondary grinding circuits as required.  A 

particle size analyzer will be installed to monitor and optimize the operating efficiency. 

ROUGHER/SCAVENGER FLOTATION 

The pulp from the secondary grinding circuit and the rejects from various cleaner 

flotation circuits will be subjected to conventional flotation to recover the graphite from 

the material being processed.  The fresh feed rate for the flotation circuit will be 

approximately 9.1 t/h.  Fuel oil will be used as collector and MIBC as frother.  The 

process includes a rougher flotation and a scavenger flotation in five, 1.5-m3 

conventional tank cells.  The concentrates produced from the circuit will be upgraded in a 

bulk cleaner flotation circuit.

The tailings from the flotation circuit will be discharged to the tailings thickener and then 

further dewatered by a pressure filter, prior to being trucked to the tailings stack storage 

pad at the mine site.  

POLISHING REGRINDING AND BULK CLEANER FLOTATION 

The concentrates produced from the rougher and scavenger flotation together with the 

concentrate from the flash flotation will be classified by a vibrating screen into two 

fractions.  The screen oversize with a particle size coarser than 0.1 mm will be reground 

in a tire-driven rod mill for polishing regrinding.  The polishing regrinding circuit will be in 

opened circuit.  The regrinding rod mill discharge together with the screen undersize will 

be sent to the bulk cleaner flotation circuit. 

The bulk cleaner circuit includes two stages of cleaner flotation.  The first bulk cleaner 

flotation will be carried out in three, 0.5-m3 conventional flotation cells.  The bulk cleaner 

tailings will be further floated by two stages of scavenger flotation.  The first bulk 

scavenger concentrate will be sent back to the head of the preceding bulk cleaner 

flotation cells, while the second bulk scavenger cleaner flotation concentrate will be 

pumped to the vibrating screen in the polishing regrinding circuit.  The tailings from the 

second scavenger cleaner flotation will be sent to the rougher flotation circuit. 

The first bulk cleaner concentrate will be further upgraded in a flotation column.  The 

concentrate produced from the column will be classified into three different size fractions 

and refloated separately in downstream upgrading circuits.  The tailings from the column 

flotation will be returned to the head of the first bulk cleaner flotation cells. 

As required, the reagents used in the rougher flotation will be used in the bulk cleaner 

circuits. 

BULK CLEANER CONCENTRATE CLASSIFICATION 

The second cleaner concentrate pulp from the bulk cleaner circuit will be screened by a 

double deck vibrating screen (bulk concentrate screen) into three different size fractions: 

+0.18 mm, -0.18+0.074 mm and –0.074 mm.  The fractions will be further polishing 

reground and refloated in separate refloat circuits.  

POLISHING REGRINDING AND REFLOATING (+0.18 MM FRACTION) 

The coarsest fraction (+0.18 mm) from the bulk cleaner concentrate screen will be sent 

to a tire-driven rod mill for polishing regrinding in opened circuit.  The mill discharge will 

be refloated by two stages of upgrading flotation. 

The first refloat flotation will be carried out in one conventional flotation cell.  Similar to 

the bulk cleaner flotation, the first refloat tailings will be further treated by two stages of 

scavenger flotation.  The first scavenger concentrate will be sent back to the head of the 

preceding first refloat flotation cell, while the second scavenger flotation concentrate will 

be pumped to the bulk concentrate screen feed box.  The tailings discharged from the 

second scavenger flotation will be sent to the rougher flotation circuit.

The first refloat cleaner concentrate will be further upgraded by the second refloat 

treatment in a flotation column.  The concentrate produced from the column will be the 

final product, which will be pumped to the +0.18 mm concentrate thickener.  The tailings 

from the column flotation will be returned to the head of the first refloat flotation cell.  

POLISHING REGRINDING AND REFLOATING (-0.18+0.074 MM FRACTION) 

The middle fraction (-0.18+0.074 mm) from the bulk cleaner concentrate screen will be 

polishing reground in a tire-driven rod mill in opened circuit.  Similar to the coarsest bulk 

cleaner concentrate fraction, the mill discharge will be refloated by two stages of 

upgrading flotation. 

The first refloat flotation will be carried out in one conventional flotation cell.  The first 

refloat tailings will be further treated by two stages of scavenger flotation.  The first 

scavenger concentrate will be sent back to the head of the preceding first refloat flotation 

cell, while the second scavenger flotation concentrate will be pumped to the bulk 

concentrate screen feed box.  The tailings discharged from the second scavenger 

flotation will be sent to the rougher flotation circuit. 

The first refloat cleaner concentrate will be further upgraded by the second refloat 

treatment in a flotation column.  The concentrate produced from the column will be the 

final product, which will be pumped to the -0.18+0.074 mm concentrate thickener.  The 

tailings from the column flotation will be returned to the head of the first refloat flotation 

cell. 

POLISHING REGRINDING AND REFLOATING (-0.074 MM MESH FRACTION) 

The fine fraction (-0.074 mm) from the bulk cleaner concentrate screen will be sent to a 

high-rate thickener.  The thickener underflow will be pumped to a tire-driven ball mill for 

polishing regrinding in opened circuit.  The thickener overflow will be pumped to the 

process water tank for reuse in the mill. 

Similar to the two coarser bulk cleaner concentrate fractions, the mill discharge will be 

refloated by two stages of upgrading flotation. 

The first refloat flotation will be carried out in one conventional flotation cell.  The first 

refloat tailings will be further treated by two stages of scavenger flotation.  The first 

scavenger concentrate will be sent back to the head of the preceding first refloat flotation 

cell, while the second scavenger flotation concentrate will be pumped to the bulk 

concentrate screen feed box.  The tailings discharged from the second scavenger 

flotation will be sent to the rougher flotation circuit. 

The first refloat cleaner concentrate will be further upgraded by the second refloat 

treatment in a flotation column.  The concentrate produced from the column will be the 

final product, which will be pumped to the -0.074 mm concentrate thickener.  The tailings 

from the column flotation will be returned to the head of the first refloat flotation cell.

As required, the reagents used in the preceding flotation circuits will be used in the 

refloat cleaner circuits. 

CONCENTRATE HANDLING 

The different particle size concentrates from the refloat flotation circuits will be 

separately thickened, filtered, and bagged prior to being transported to the Asbury site for 

further upgrading by thermal treatment.  The concentrate handling facility will have the 

following equipment: 

 three, 1 m diameter high-rate thickeners 

 three concentrate filter feed stock tanks 

 one, 5-m2 plate-frame pressure filter 

 one bagging system 

 related pumping and compressed air supply systems. 

The final graphite concentrates will be separately pumped to their own concentrate 

thickeners.  Flocculant will be added to the thickener feed wells to aid the settling 

process.  The thickened concentrates will be sent to their own concentrate stock tanks.  

The underflow density of the thickener will be approximately 50 to 60% solids.  Each of 

the concentrate stock tanks will be equipped with an agitator to keep the solids 

suspended.  A plate-frame press filter will be used for further concentrate dewatering.  

The filtration will be operated in day shift only.  The filtration operation will be scheduled 

to ensure all the three concentrates are filtered separately.  The filter press will reduce 

the moisture content of the thickener underflows to approximately 12% w/w.  The filter 

press solids will be discharged onto a conveyor that transports the filter cake to the 

bagging system.  The different particle size concentrates will separately be bagged prior 

to being trucked to the thermal treatment plant.  The plant will provide sufficient on-site 

storage capacity for up to 10 days of production, in the event of unexpected 

transportation disruption. 

The filtrate from the pressure filter will be circulated back to a concentrate thickener feed 

well as dilution water.  The overflow from the thickener will be pumped to the process 

water tank for re-use as process water. 

TAILINGS DISPOSAL 

The final tailings from the rougher/scavenger flotation will be thickened and then filtered 

prior to being stacked in the tailings management facility located at the mine site. 

The tailings handling equipment will include: 

 one, 5 m diameter high-rate thickener 

 one, 3.0 m diameter by 3.5 m high stock tank with an agitator 

 one, 60-m2 plate-frame pressure filter and

 related pumping and compressed air supply systems. 

The final flotation tailings from the rougher/scavenger flotation cells will be pumped to a 

high-rate thickener with approximately 5 m in diameter.  Flocculant will be added to the 

thickener feed well to aid the settling process.  The thickener underflow will be sent to 

the tailings stock tank.  The underflow density of the thickener is anticipated to be 

approximately 60% solids.  The thickened slurry will be further dewatered by a plate-

frame press filter to a moisture content of approximately 15%.  The filter press solids will 

be discharged onto a tailings stockpile and then be loaded by a front-end loader onto a 

truck, which will haul the dewatered tailings to the tailings management facility for 

storage. 

The filtrate from the pressure filter will be circulated back to the tailings thickener feed 

well as dilution water.  The overflow from the thickener will be pumped to the process 

water tank for re-use as process water. 

REAGENT HANDLING AND STORAGE 

Fuel oil and MIBC will be added to the flotation process slurry streams to modify the 

chemical and physical characteristics of mineral particle surfaces, and to enhance the 

floatability of the graphite particles into the concentrate products.  Flocculant will be used 

as a settling aid for the flotation concentrate and tailings thickening. 

Fuel oil and MIBC will be shipped to the plant as liquid in bulk drums.  The reagents will 

be directly pumped in undiluted form to the points of addition using metering pumps. 

Solid flocculant will be used for the Project.  The flocculant will be prepared in the 

standard manner in a wetting and mixing system to a dilute solution of less than 0.2% 

solution strength.  The solution will be stored in a holding tank prior to being pumped by 

metering pumps to the thickener feed wells. 

ASSAY AND METALLURGICAL LABORATORY 

The assay laboratory will be equipped with the necessary analytical instruments to 

provide all routine assays for the mine and processing plant.  One LECO furnace will be 

installed for graphite assay.  The other assays, including water sample analysis, will be 

conducted by commercial laboratories. 

The metallurgical laboratory will undertake all the necessary test work to monitor 

metallurgical performance and, more importantly, to improve process flowsheet unit 

operations and efficiencies.  The laboratory will be equipped with necessary laboratory 

equipment. 

WATER SUPPLY 

Two separate water supply systems will be provided to support the operations for the 

processing plant: one fresh water supply system and one process water supply system.

Fresh water will be supplied to a fresh water storage tank from the water treatment plant 

or from a borehole.  

The overflow solutions from the concentrate thickeners and tailings thickener will be re-

used in the process circuit.  The balance of the process water will be supplied from the 

water treatment plant, or from the fresh water tank, as required.  All process water will be 

distributed to the processing plant via a process water loop connecting with the process 

water tank. 

AIR SUPPLY 

Air service systems will supply air to the following service areas: 

 flotation circuit – low-pressure air for flotation cells will be provided by an air 

blower; high-pressure air will be provided for flotation columns 

 filtration circuits – high-pressure air will be provided by air compressors for 

filtration and drying. 

 plant air service – high-pressure air will be provided by air compressors for the 

various services. 

 instrumentation – the service air will come from the plant air compressors and 

will be dried and stored in a dedicated air receiver. 

17.2 GRAPHITE RECOVERY – THERMAL PURIFICATION 

17.2.1 INTRODUCTION 

The proposed graphite purification plant for this study is located 8.1 km northeast of 

Notre-Dame-Du-Laus in the Laurentides Region of Quebec, or approximately 150 km 

northwest of the Miller site.  The graphite concentrates with different particle sizes will be 

hauled to the purification plant for further upgrading to the final graphite products 

containing higher than 99.99% graphitic carbon.  The designed annual production rate of 

the high-purity graphite products is 1,500 t/a.  The proposed upgrade method is thermal 

treatment to remove the impurities that are contained in the concentrates.  

17.2.2 SUMMARY 

The thermal treatment processing plant will upgrade the flotation concentrates 

containing approximately 95% graphitic carbon to the final graphite products containing 

higher than 99.99% graphitic carbon. The processing plant will consist of:

17.2.3 PROCESSING PLANT DESCRIPTION 

The flotation concentrates produced at the Miller site will be trucked to the Asbury site. 

The different particle size concentrates will be separately loaded into the furnace feed 

bins.  The concentrates will be dried using the recovered heat from the furnaces.  A total 

of 11 furnaces will be installed and used for the graphite purification. The furnaces will 

work in a continuous mode.  The dried concentrates will be fed into the furnaces at a 

control feed rate.  The maximum feed rate is estimated to be approximately 

50 lb/h/furnace.  High-purity nitrogen gas will be purged into the furnaces to form a 

protective atmosphere. 

The furnaces will be electrically heated.  The temperature in the hottest zone of the 

furnaces is designed to be approximately 1,900 to 2,000°C.  After passing through the 

hottest zone, the heated graphite will be cooled down through the cooling zone where it 

will be controlled by a water cooling system consisting of chillers. 

The thermally treated graphite, or the final graphite products will be transferred and 

stored in separate hoppers in the product handling area according to their particle sizes. 

The final products will be packed or bagged prior to being shipped to the end users. 

Weigh scales would be provided for accounting purposes.  Samples will be taken at the 

furnace exit points and the final product storage hoppers (before the graphite is bagged) 

for quality control assay.  

The off-gas generated from the thermal purification process will be collected, cooled and 

passed through an off-gas scrubbing system prior to being discharged into the

environment.  A heat exchanger system will be installed to recover the heat energy from 

the off-gas.  

REAGENT HANDLING AND STORAGE 

High-purity nitrogen gas used for the upgrading treatment will be bottled and trucked to 

the site.  The nitrogen gas bottles will be stored in a dedicated area.  

ASSAY AND METALLURGICAL LABORATORY 

The assay laboratory will be equipped with the necessary analytical instruments to 

provide all routine assays for the processing plant.  One LECO furnace will be installed for 

graphite assay.  The final product samples will be sent to commercial laboratories for 

high purity assays or product quality control assays. 

The metallurgical laboratory is proposed to undertake essential test work to monitor 

metallurgical performance and, more importantly, to improve process flowsheet unit 

operations and efficiencies.  The laboratory will be equipped with necessary laboratory 

equipment.   

WATER SUPPLY 

Fresh water will be supplied from boreholes at the plant site.  The treated water from the 

water treatment plant will be reused for scrubbing the off-gases produced from the 

thermal process.  

AIR SUPPLY 

An air service system will supply high pressure air to the various service areas.  

Instrument service air will come from the plant air receiver and will be dried and stored in 

a dedicated air receiver.

18.0  P ROJ ECT  INFRASTRUCTU RE 

18.1 INTRODUCTION 

The proposed project infrastructure will be located at two separate locations: at the Miller 

site and at the Asbury site. All the mining activities, including processing graphite 

concentrate and the extraction of marble blocks, will be carried out at the Miller site. The 

flotation concentrate will be trucked to the Asbury site for further processing at the 

thermal upgrade plant. The Asbury site is located at approximately 150 km northwest of 

the Miller site.  

The locations for both the sites are illustrated in Figure 18.1.

18.2 MILLER SITE INFRASTRUCTURE 

The Miller Property is located in the Outaouais Region of southern Quebec, approximately 

75 km west of Montreal, Quebec and 90 km east of Ottawa, Ontario (Figure 18.2). The 

approximate geographic centre of the Miller Property is located at 530,385 m east and 

5,056,900 m north. The closest cities are Grenville, Quebec (5 km south of the Miller 

Property) and Hawkesbury, Ontario (8 km south of the Miller Property). The Project is 

located within the boundaries of the Argenteuil Regional County Municipality and is on 

the territory of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge municipality. 

The elevation of the Project area varies from approximately 200 to 230 masl. 

Figure 18.2 Location of the Miller Project Site 

 

Local skilled labor force should be able to support the proposed mining operation. A few 

quarries are adjacent to the Property. Some of the quarry operators own excavation 

equipment. Canada Carbon has developed business partnerships with these quarry 

operators for potential equipment supply and operating expertise.  The bulk sample 

generation for the 2014 pilot plant campaigns was carried out by one of the quarry 

operators.

18.2.1 ACCESSIBILITY 

All-year roads are available to access the Project site.  The site is easily accessible from 

Highway 50, which runs approximately 2 km to the south of the deposit limit.  Highway 50 

is a provincial road linking the greater Montreal area to the greater Ottawa area.  A 

railroad passes through the Ottawa Valley near the town of Grenville. 

A local paved road, Scotch Road, traverses the Miller Property from south to north.  Many 

existing forestry roads are present in and around, and allow access to, the Miller 

Property.  The deposit is also accessible from Scotch Road via a network of bush trails, 

which runs more or less east to west. 

The closest cities are Grenville (5 km to the south of the Project) and Hawkesbury, 

Ontario (8 km to the south of the Project).  The immediate vicinity of the Project is 

scarcely populated and the settlements are mainly concentrated along Scotch Road with 

relatively limited local traffic. 

18.2.2 MINE AND PLANT ACCESS ROADS 

The local existing forestry roads within the proposed mine site will be upgraded for the 

mining and processing activities.  New access roads will be constructed according to the 

proposed mine site layout, including a haulage road connecting the mine site and the 

plant site located northeast of the pits.  The internal roads and pad areas will likely be 

gravel surfaced.  Road surface structures will be designed giving consideration to the 

frequent use of the mine mobile equipment proposed for the project.  A control gate will 

be constructed at the main access road which will connect the proposed mine and 

Scotch Road. 

The traffic within the proposed mine site and at the main access road will be controlled 

by a radio communication system.  Traffic deflection barriers or berms should be installed 

on roads or access adjacent to steep drop-offs. 

18.2.3 MINE SITE FACILITIES 

Open pit mining is proposed for the project and the graphite and marble will be mined by 

contractors.  The graphite bearing materials mined from the pits will be concentrated 

using conventional flotation.  The marble blocks will be extracted from the marble pit and 

temporarily stored on the marble block pad prior to being trucked to architectural 

manufacturers.  The mobile equipment, including haulage trucks, will be maintained or 

repaired by local commercial maintenance shops. 

The proposed mine is designed to produce approximately 1,650 t of graphite concentrate 

per year, which will be further upgraded to high-purity graphite (1,500 t/a), and 

150,000 t/a of architectural marble blocks. 

The mining contractor will crush the graphite mineralized material to a particle size of 

approximately 80% passing 12 mm.  The mill feed rate of the graphite flotation plant is 

designed according to the mill feed grades.  For the initial years, the proposed mill feed

rate will be approximately 200 t/d when high-grade materials are planned to feed into 

the mill.  The mill process rates will be increased to approximately 300 t/d and 499 t/d 

with a decrease in mill feed grade. 

The waste rocks produced are anticipated to be hauled offsite by the mining contractor 

and used as gravel for construction materials or cement raw materials. 

According to the preliminary project schedule developed for the PEA, the marble block 

extraction is planned to start operation one year earlier than the graphite production. 

The proposed mining and flotation operation will consist of following main facilities: 

 various storage pads for: 

 top soil  

 waste rocks 

 extracted marble blocks  

 dewatered tailings 

 crushed mill feeds 

 a mill feed handling system, including a dumping pocket and a conveyor to 

transport the crushed material from the dumping pocket to a 200-t mill feed 

surge bin  

 a main processing complex, including processing plant, assay/metallurgical 

laboratories and offices 

 power supply and distribution systems 

 a water treatment plant, including a contact water sediment pond 

 overall mine site water management systems. 

The preliminary Miller site layout is shown in Figure 18.3.

18.2.4 PROCESSING PLANT 

The proposed graphite concentration plant will be located northeast of the pits.  The 

crushed mill feed will be temporally stored at the excavated pits at the mine site and 

hauled to the mill feed receiving pad located at the plant site.  The crushed mill feed will 

be reclaimed by a front-end loader onto a mill feed handling system and then to a mill 

feed surge bin prior to being ground and concentrated by flotation.  The facilities at the 

plant site will include: 

 a mill feed handling system, including a dumping pocket and a mill feed surge 

bin conveyor 

 a 200-t mill feed surge bin and a reclaim belt feeder 

 a primary and secondary grinding circuit, including a primary grinding rod mill, a 

secondary grinding rod mill, a flash flotation system, a particle size analyzer and 

related slurry pumps 

 a graphite bulk rougher/scavenger flotation, a bulk cleaner concentrate 

regrinding and a bulk cleaner flotation circuits 

 bulk cleaner concentrate classification and three refloating circuits to further 

upgrade the bulk concentrate 

 concentrate dewatering and bagging systems 

 tailings dewatering 

 electrical rooms 

 flocculant preparation 

 reagent distribution 

 plant air supply systems, including high pressure air for column flotation and 

plant air services and low pressure air for flotation cells 

 an assay/metallurgical laboratory 

 a maintenance workshop/warehouse 

 offices. 

The preliminary plant layout is shown in Figure 18.4.

18.2.5 POWER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION 

Electrical power will be supplied from the grid power line which runs along Scotch Road 

at the southeast part of the mine site.  The grid power line will be able to supply sufficient 

electricity required by the mining and processing operations. 

The electricity from the grid line will be transferred from 25 kV to 600 V by a pad mount 

transformer, and then further down to 120/208 V by a transformer.  There will be a 

600 V load centre panel and a 120/208 V load centre panel provided for mining and 

processing usages.  A small 20 kVA generator will act as an emergency backup.  

Lightning protection will be installed to protect the power supply system and buildings. 

18.2.6 COMMUNICATIONS 

As the Project site is located within an urbanized area, the main communications will rely 

on public communication systems provided by local suppliers.  The mining and 

processing operations will use landline telephones, Internet, and cell phone coverage for 

communications.  An additional system for handheld and vehicle radios will be installed 

to provide full local radio coverage for the overall Miller site. 

18.2.7 WATER SUPPLY/OVERALL SITE WATER MANAGEMENT 

WATER SUPPLY 

Process water will come from recirculation of the solutions recovered from the 

concentrate and tailings thickeners in the processing plant and the water from the water 

treatment plant or from the boreholes at the plant area.  The thickening processes will 

recover a large part of the water from the thickener overflow.  The balance of the process 

water will come from the water treatment plant.  If water from the water treatment plant 

is insufficient for the process operation, fresh water from the boreholes at the plant site 

will be used for the processing plant.  All water will be pumped to a process water tank 

located inside of the plant.  The process water will be delivered to various water addition 

points via a process water distribution loop. 

Fresh water used for supporting overall site operations will come from the local 

boreholes.  Potable water for drinking will come from bottled water supplied from local 

potable water suppliers. 

Overall mine site firefighting will rely on local firefighting services provided by adjacent 

local cities/towns. 

OVERALL SITE WATER MANAGEMENT 

Primary sources of operation/construction-influenced water include: 

 run-off from the temporary waste rock storage pad, the marble block storage 

pad and the tailings stacking pad

 pit dewatering water 

 runoff from areas that are heavily impacted by mining/processing activities 

(plant, parking areas, equipment lay-down yards, etc.). 

To divert non-contact water away from the operating areas, overall site drainage systems 

will be constructed, including various diversion channels.  The diverted surface water will 

be discharged directly into the environment.  The contact water, including the water 

collected from the pits will gravity flow to the sediment pond located south of the pits.  

The suspended solids will be settled out in a pond.  An oil-water separator will be 

provided to separate the entrained oils from the mining and processing activities prior to 

the water being further treated by the water treatment plant. The water treatment plant 

will include a clarifier and related flocculant preparation and addition systems.  The 

treated water will be used as process make-up water or discharged into the environment. 

No hydrology or hydraulic (drainage) design has been completed for this study.   

18.2.8 WASTE DISPOSAL 

The wastes produced from the mining and processing operations are anticipated to 

include: 

 waste rocks 

 flotation tailings 

 lubricants, batteries, various steel scraps, electronics, cardboards and others 

 sewage. 

WASTE ROCKS 

The waste rocks extracted from the graphite and marble pits are expected to be trucked 

off site by the mining contractor and used as construction materials.  

FLOTATION TAILINGS 

The flotation tailings produced from the graphite concentration is approximately 97 to 

99% of the mill feed.  The tailings will be dewatered at the processing plant by thickening 

and filtration processes to a moisture content of approximately 15% w/w.  The dewatered 

cakes from the pressure filter will be temporarily stockpiled inside of the processing 

plant.  Then the cakes will be trucked and placed onto the tailings dry stacking storage 

pad adjacent to the graphite pits.  As required, the tailings will be spread and compacted 

with mobile equipment (dozers) to provide sufficient compaction for trafficability of the 

equipment that needs to work on the pad.  

When the west graphite pit is mined out, the dewatered tailings will be directly placed 

into the excavated pit.  At the end of the operations, the stacked tailings will be backfilled 

into the excavated graphite and marble pits.  Further tailings management plan should 

be conducted and reviewed in the next phase study, including tailing characterizations.

Grenville Township, Quebec, Canada 

  

 

Canada Carbon is planning to work with a local cement manufacturer to evaluate 

whether the tailings material is suitable to be used as a raw material for cement 

production. 

OTHER INDUSTRIAL WASTE MANAGEMENT 

The general industrial wastes, such as lubricants, batteries, various steel scraps, 

electronics, cardboards, and others will be collected separately and temporarily stored at 

a dedicated location at the Project site.  The collected waste materials will be separately 

sent to the local waste recycling facilities. 

SEWAGE MANAGEMENT 

The sewage produced at the mine site will be trucked off site and treated by the local 

sewage treatment plants operated by the local cities/towns. 

18.3 INFRASTRUCTURE - ASBURY SITE 

The flotation concentrate is planned to be shipped to the Asbury site for further 

upgrading.  The site, selected by Canada Carbon, is located at approximately 8.1 km 

northeast of Notre-Dame-Du-Laus, which is a municipality in the Laurentides region of 

Quebec, Canada.  The Notre-Dame-Du-Laus village is approximately 240 km northwest of 

Montreal, or approximately 150 km northwest of the Miller site (Figure 18.5). 

18.3.1 ACCESSIBILITY 

All-year roads are available to access the plant site.  The site is easily accessible from 

Highway 309, which runs approximately 6 km to the west of the Asbury site.  Highway 

309 is a provincial road connecting with Highway 50. 

Access to the proposed graphite upgrade plant from the Notre-Dame-Du-Laus village is 

via the Chemin du Ruisseau Serpent Road, which passes south of the Asbury site, and 

then Chemin de la Mine Road.  The distance between the Asbury site and the Notre-

Dame-Du-Laus village is approximately 8.1 km. 

18.3.2 THERMAL UPGRADING PLANT 

The proposed graphite thermal treatment plant will upgrade the graphite concentrates 

produced at the Miller flotation plant to an average grade of higher than 99.99% graphitic 

carbon.  There is an existing building at the Asbury site, which will be upgraded into a 

warehouse for storing the concentrates and the final graphite products, a workshop, a 

laboratory, and offices.  A new building will be constructed to house the eleven thermal 

furnaces which will be used to upgrade the flotation concentrates.

graphite concentrates.  The total power demand is estimated to be approximately 5 MW.  

Electrical power will be supplied from the grid power line along Chemin du Ruisseau 

Serpent Road.  The grid power line will be able to supply electricity power required by the 

thermal upgrade operation. 

The electricity from the grid line will be transferred from 25 kV to 600 V by a transformer, 

and then further down to 120/208 V by a transformer, as required.  A small 20 kVA 

generator will act as an emergency backup.  Lightning protection will be installed to 

protect the power supply system and buildings. 

18.3.4 COMMUNICATIONS

the boreholes at the plant area.  The cooling water used for furnace cooling will come 

from a chiller cooling system and will be re-used.  The water used for the off-gas 

scrubbing will be treated through the water treatment system, which will also treat the 

runoff collected from the thermal plant pad. 

Potable water for drinking will come from bottled water supplied from local potable water 

suppliers. 

Overall mine site firefighting will rely on local firefighting services provided by adjacent 

local cities/towns. 

No hydrology or hydraulic (drainage) design has been completed for this study.

19.0  MARKET STUD IES  AND  C ONTRACTS  

Graphite pricing and marketing information contained in this section was sourced from 

Canada Carbon's discussions with U.S. and international nuclear graphite researchers 

and regulatory agencies, academic institutions, and high-technology graphite consumers 

and distributors worldwide, under the guidance of Dr. Pieter J. Barnard, Ph.D., MBA, B.Sc. 

(Hons). Marble pricing and marketing data contained herein was obtained from marble 

processors and distributors, aggregate distributors, and cement manufacturers in North 

America. Canada Carbon is planning to produce high-purity graphite concentrate, ultra-

high-purity refined graphite (to be thermally treated at Canada Carbon's Asbury facility), 

marble slabs and blocks, crushed stone (as aggregate), and marble powder from graphite 

flotation tailings potentially suitable for producing Portland cement and other products. 

All third-party market information and pricing provided herein has been independently 

verified by Dr. John Huang, the QP for this section. 

19.1 GRAPHITE 

Graphite is an industrial mineral with unique characteristics, including high thermal and 

chemical stability, high electrical and thermal conductance, as well as high strength and 

the ability to act as a lubricant. Natural graphite deposits are commonplace around the 

world.  However, the Miller graphite is of the rare hydrothermal/vein type. Vein graphite 

typically has higher purity than other natural graphite, as well as having a highly 

developed crystal structure, which enhances the electrical and thermal conductance of 

the graphite. The high purity and high crystallinity each generate higher value in the 

marketplace. Synthetic graphite can be produced with very high purity, but it typically 

possesses disordered or tiny crystal domains, making it unsuitable in some applications. 

Canada Carbon plans to produce a high grade graphite concentrate that can be further 

refined to ultra-high purity by thermal treatment, to meet the specifications of individual 

end-users in a number of high-technology applications, inter-alia nuclear graphite. 

19.1.1 HIGH PURITY GRAPHITE CONCENTRATE 

Canada Carbon plans to market 100% of its anticipated production as an ultra-high-purity 

concentrate. Standard froth flotation concentration has yielded graphite of more than 

99% purity at bench scale, with average pilot plant production of 95.6% graphitic carbon. 

After undergoing brief thermal treatment, performed by a commercial processor of 

synthetic nuclear graphite, a run of mill sample of the Miller pilot plant graphite 

concentrate was upgraded to 99.9998% graphitic carbon. Scanning electron microscopy 

and Raman spectroscopy have clearly demonstrated the highly crystalline nature of the 

Miller graphite. These and other characteristics make the Miller graphite suitable for

demanding high-technology applications for which there is a very limited graphite supply, 

yielding high market valuations. 

19.1.2 HIGH PURITY GRAPHITE APPLICATIONS 

Ultra-high-purity natural vein graphite is currently produced in limited amounts in Sri 

Lanka. Other types of natural graphite (flake and amorphous) dominate international 

commercial graphite markets, with supply variability resulting in high price volatility. 

Substantial new supply of flake graphite is expected to come to market within three 

years. Canada Carbon will not compete with flake or amorphous graphite producers, but 

will instead focus on specialized niche markets where the highly desirable properties of 

the Miller graphite are expected to be both prized, and valued appropriately. 

NUCLEAR REACTORS AND NUCLEAR RESEARCH PROGRAMS 

Nuclear reactor design and development programs are underway around the world, 

under the auspices of the Generation IV International Forum Charter. Generation IV 

reactor designs are expected to provide safer, higher-yielding (more efficient) generation 

of nuclear power, primarily for the production of electricity. Two leading designs, pebble 

bed and prismatic, are both high-temperature, inert gas cooled reactors which use 

graphite as the moderator. Graphite slows neutrons produced in the reactor core, making 

them far more likely to sustain the nuclear chain reaction, thereby increasing reactor 

efficiency dramatically. Natural graphite would be preferred over synthetic, based on both 

performance criteria and price, but the contaminant levels in natural graphite have made 

it unsuitable for nuclear applications, historically.  

Canada Carbon's 99.9998% graphitic carbon (thermally purified) Miller graphite has 

been shown to not only qualify for nuclear reactor fuel compacts, but it demonstrated 

contaminant levels of only 2.7% and 12.2% (respectively) of the best natural or synthetic 

graphite studied in a major U.S. government funded nuclear research program conducted 

by Oak Ridge and Idaho National Laboratories (see Table 19.1) The contaminants 

measured in the Miller graphite were not only at ultra-trace concentrations, but also 

essentially benign, yielding an Equivalent Boron Content of 0.749 ppm. 

Subcommittee D02.F0 on Manufactured Carbon and Graphite Products of ASTM 

International, which has a primary focus on developing internationally recognized test 

methods for comprehensive characterization of graphite and manufactured carbon 

materials used in nuclear and other high-technology applications, is working towards the 

publication of a new testing standard for nuclear graphite purity using ultra-high-purity 

thermally purified Miller graphite as a reference material.

Four international laboratories, one from the US and three from the EU with membership 

in Subcommittee D02.F0, have participated in the round-robin testing of the Miller 

graphite under the proposed testing standard testing protocol, contributing eight 

analytical datasets arising from three different Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry 

("GDMS") instrumental platforms. These experimental results are currently being 

interpreted in accordance with ASTM Standard E691-2011: "Standard Practice for 

Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method". In the 

final document, the GDMS analytical results will be compared with those arising from two 

different preparatory methods for Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry ("ICP-

MS") analysis, as well as those arising from Particle Induced X-Ray Emission ("PIXE"), 

each of which is capable of producing analytical results of similar analytical sensitivity to 

GDMS. 

Subcommittee D02.F0 is composed of international experts in specialty graphite and 

manufactured carbon materials research and development and includes leading 

scientists from the UK National Nuclear Laboratory, Idaho National Laboratory (US), Oak 

Ridge National Laboratory (US), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US), representatives of 

other international governments and academic institutions, graphite end-users, and 

producers of specialty carbon products. Representatives of Canada Carbon have 

accepted invitations to join Subcommittee D02.F0, directly offered by the Chairman of 

the Subcommittee. 

Canada Carbon has received inquiries and sample requests from government and 

university funded researchers around the world, and is in the process of negotiating 

supply agreements. Pricing for purified graphite for nuclear applications is not yet 

confirmed by contract, but it is expected to be sold for USD18,000 to USD35,000/t.

ELECTRONIC DEVICES 

Graphite's thermal and electrical conductivity make it ideal for improving the efficiency 

and reliability of semiconductor based electronic devices. It can be used as a heat-sink, 

as a conductor, or a combination of the two. It can be used as a surface coating, or as an 

additive in composite materials. High crystallinity of the graphite raw material is required 

to ensure that these properties are maximized. Very high purity is also required, in order 

to minimize or eliminate thermal outgassing of impurities during the operation of the 

electronic devices.  

The commercial processor responsible for the thermal upgrading of the Miller graphite to 

99.9998% purity is an affiliate of a well-known international graphite corporation. Shortly 

after completing the upgrading trials for Canada Carbon, this international entity 

submitted a pricing letter stating that the ultra-high-purity Miller graphite was suitable for 

supplying to their clients in the specialty electronics industry. Assuming 10% market 

penetration into the stated market of 250 to 350 t/mo, Canada Carbon could sell 300 to 

420 t/a, at a price of USD12,000 to USD14,000/t. 

ENERGY STORAGE DEVICES 

In the past two decades, technical advances in battery technology, particularly the Li-ion 

type, have driven a revolution in consumer devices due to enhanced portability and 

reliability. A growing consensus that the burning of fossil fuels is altering the world's 

climate is also driving the development of energy storage devices that would allow users 

reliant on renewable power sources such as solar collection or wind generation to have 

the power available during periods when power would otherwise not be available. For 

consumers connected to the electrical grid, cheaper power is often available at times of 

off-peak consumption. Less expensive stored power could be used at those times when 

grid power would be more costly. This behaviour would also provide a load-leveling effect 

for power utilities. Vanadium redox/flow batteries are also being developed which will 

have the capacity to store electricity for both domestic and industrial applications, and 

are already being installed as load-leveling devices by electrical utility operators. Both 

types of batteries require high purity graphite for essential components. 

Economic factors have limited the adoption of Li-ion battery technology in transportation 

applications traditionally held by fossil fuels, but it is expected that graphite demand (for 

e.g. all-electric and hybrid automobiles) will skyrocket if the overall cost can be made 

comparable to traditionally powered vehicles. Because an all-electric Li-ion battery pack 

contains a substantial amount of graphite (estimated to be around 100 kg per vehicle), 

widespread adoption of this technology will cause a rapid increase in demand for 

graphite with the suitable characteristics of crystallinity, particle size and purity. The 

graphite particles must also be sphericalized, and coated, to enhance their performance 

characteristics. 

Canada Carbon believes that its ultra-high-purity graphite is highly suited to Li-ion battery 

technology. There are already a number of flake graphite companies positioning 

themselves to meet the expected demand for automotive battery graphite, but high 

battery cost is the most critical variable impeding the widespread adoption of the 

technology. Anticipating that future graphite pricing for this market will be under

significant negative pressure as a cost-reduction strategy, Canada Carbon sees no value 

in competing in this high-volume commercial Li-battery marketplace.  

Canada Carbon has instead chosen to focus entirely on Li-ion battery applications in 

which performance and reliability are the primary criteria, such as are required by 

defense and aerospace applications. Samples of the ultra-high-purity Miller graphite are 

currently being assessed for high-performance Li-ion battery capability. Suitable graphite 

will command a premium, and once shaped and coated, values of USD15,000 to 

USD25,000/t are anticipated for this niche battery market. 

GRAPHENE 

Graphite crystals are composed of layers of graphene. Each layer of graphene is a sheet 

of carbon atoms bonded together in a hexagonal array, but which is itself only one atom 

thick. A sheet of graphene is so thin that approximately 3,000,000 sheets stacked in the 

natural crystalline structure would only be 1 mm thick. The physical properties of graphite 

(e.g. thermal and electrical conductivity) are really the properties of graphene, although 

any disruptions in the crystal structure or impurities in the graphite would diminish the 

observed property. 

Unlike graphene sheets within a graphite crystal, which are protected from exposure to a 

chemically reactive environment by the other graphene sheets above and below them, a 

single layer of graphene is the only form of carbon in which each atom is available for 

chemical reaction from both sides. Atoms at the edges of the graphene sheet have 

enhanced reactivity. This reactivity makes graphene the target of an incredible variety of 

scientific research programs, as the properties of the graphene can be modified by 

reactions with other chemicals.  

Graphene is the strongest material ever tested; it is over 200 times stronger than steel, 

on a weight basis. It is being investigated as a reinforcing agent in a number of composite 

materials.  

Graphene which is produced via the exfoliation (separation of layers) of natural graphite 

may have a cost advantage over synthetic graphene because the available exfoliation 

technologies are amenable to bulk processing. However, the highest quality graphene 

requires the best precursor graphite, both in terms of crystal morphology and overall 

purity.  

Canada Carbon's ultra-high-purity Miller graphite possesses both of those qualities. It has 

very large crystal structure, and can be purified to 99.9998% graphitic carbon. Samples 

of the purified Miller graphite are being examined by graphene researchers around the 

world. 

19.2 MARBLE PRODUCTS

hydrothermally altered marble at its contact with paragneiss, and can be found as void-

filling pods and veins, banded skarns, or broadly disseminated in the marble. During early 

exploration drilling, wide intervals of white marble were encountered. Consulting 

geologists determined that the marble had economic potential. Following extensive 

testing, an off-take agreement is in place for architectural marble slabs and blocks, with 

a base-case value of $184/t. Crushed marble produced during graphite mining or marble 

quarrying will be removed from site by the mining contractor, for a nominal credit of $1/t. 

Finely ground graphite tailings have potential value as Portland cement feedstock, and 

will be segregated in a dry-stack tailings facility on-site. An off-take agreement for this 

material is not yet finalized. 

19.2.1 MARBLE BLOCKS AND SLABS 

As reported by the Company on February 19, 2015, wide intersections of white marble 

were discovered to lie adjacent to the main vein/skarn graphite mineralized zones, also 

hosted in white marble. Consultations with dimensional stone industry representatives 

revealed that the white marble intersections were continuous enough to warrant further 

evaluation of the quality and size of the marble units. A significant component of the 

2015 drill campaign was dedicated to better defining the white marble zones. 

A block of marble weighing approximately 1 t was shipped to an architectural stone 

processor located in Quebec, for cutting, polishing and assessment. The processor 

reported that the Miller marble was whiter, less brittle, easier to cut, and polish to a luster 

not seen in the imported white marble that they currently process. Following a site visit, 

the processor requested a further 50 t of marble for processing and distribution to 

potential customers. Canada Carbon subsequently signed a comprehensive agreement to 

sell 75,000 t of architectural-quality marble material from its flagship Miller Project. The 

agreed base valuation for marble blocks or slabs is $14/ft3, which is approximately 

$184/t. There are provisions for price increases above this base case to be applied 

retroactively on specified tonnage thresholds, as well as royalties to be paid on the sale 

of all value-added marble products. The term of the contract is to run for one year from 

the date of the acquisition of the required environmental approvals and an extraction 

permit to quarry the material, and is renewable. 

19.2.2 MARBLE WASTE FROM MINING AND QUARRYING 

Canada Carbon has signed a contract with a local quarry operator to perform all mining 

activities, including blasting, hauling, and preliminary crushing of graphite mineralized 

material. The contractor will remove and store off-site all non-mineralized stone material 

produced during graphite mining, as well as any material unsuitable for sale as blocks or 

slabs or for graphite processing produced during marble quarrying, for ultimate use as 

construction or decorative aggregates. Under Quebec legislation, that quarry operator can 

only store the aggregate materials off-site if there is a purchase agreement in place. The 

contractor is expected to pay a nominal amount of $1/t to move aggregate materials 

arising from both graphite mining and marble quarrying operations off-site.

19.2.3 MARBLE CONTAINED IN GRAPHITE MILL FLOTATION TAILINGS 

Detailed chemical analysis of the flotation tailings, composed entirely of crushed marble, 

has demonstrated that the tailings have calcium, iron, silica, and aluminum levels 

suitable as feedstock for cement manufacturers. The Miller marble contains low levels of 

magnesium, which makes it well-suited for certain specific value-added products 

distributed by the two international cement companies now in discussions with the 

Company. 

In the absence of an off-take agreement, Canada Carbon cannot currently assign any 

value to the tailings material. However, storage costs will be reduced significantly if the 

tailings are moved off-site at any point in the life of mine cycle, even if no revenue is 

produced from their removal.

20.0  ENVIRONMENTAL STUD IE S ,  P ERMITTING,  
AND  SOCIAL  OR COMMUN ITY  IMPACT  

Canada Carbon must complete the overall permitting and approval process in order to 

construct, operate, and close the Project. This permitting and approval process includes 

the acquisition of all necessary permits and approvals from various federal, provincial, 

and local government agencies. This section is based on information available as of the 

effective date of this report. 

Canada Carbon has a number of environmental and social assessments underway, each 

required when Canada Carbon proceeds with an application to the MERN (the Ministry 

responsible for anything relating to mining—permits, titles, mining rights, etc.) for a 

mining and quarrying permit for the Project. The thermal plant at Asbury will require a 

certificate of authorisation.  The area planned to be mined and developed at the Miller 

Property will cover approximately 1,000,000 m2, including pit limits, stockpiles (tailings, 

waste rock, top soil, overburden, and mined materials), plant, access roads, parking lots, 

and offsets.  The area to be used at the Asbury Property covers approximately 

16,000 m2, including, but not limited to, a new thermal upgrading plant, an existing plant 

building (to be upgraded as warehouse, office), and parking lots. The Asbury Property is 

zoned for heavy industrial usage.  The author has not visited this site. 

Key facilities and associated activities likely to interact with environmental, social, and 

economic components of the Project setting include the following: 

 Miller Property: 

 graphite quarry pits 

 marble quarry pit 

 tailings dry stack 

 sediment pond

20.1 PERMITTING 

Canada Carbon is in the process of compiling required information for completing permit 

and authorization applications, prior to development of the Project. Environmental 

approval and permitting requirements described in this section is based on information 

provided by Canada Carbon at the time of writing this report.  Separate permits and 

authorizations are required for the Miller graphite quarry pits, the Miller marble quarry pit 

and the Asbury thermal plant. 

According to the Quebec Mining Act the Miller graphite quarry and the Miller marble 

quarry will each require a separate mining lease from the MERN prior to substance 

extraction. Under the Mining Act, graphite is considered a mineral substance requiring a 

mining lease and marble is considered a surface mineral substance requiring a lease to 

mine surface mineral substances prior to extraction. Prior to obtaining a mining lease, 

Canada Carbon must submit a rehabilitation and restoration plan to the MERN, and have 

it approved by the Ministry. The application for the lease must also be accompanied by a 

feasibility study, a land survey of the mining lease, a scoping and market study regarding 

the processing of mineralized material in Quebec (Quebec Government October 2015). 

Canada Carbon is in the process of determining the permitting requirements for the 

Miller marble pit and expects to have the necessary information available for 

consideration during the feasibility stage.  In Quebec, some substances on lands granted 

or alienated before January 1, 1966 were surrendered to the landowner. After January 1, 

1966, the substances remain the property of the province on granted lands.  Canada 

Carbon is currently investigating with the MERN the possibility that the Miller marble pit is 

the property of the land owner, which would remove the need to pay a royalty. 

Under Section 22 of the Environment Quality Act, prior to extraction of the graphite or 

marble, Canada Carbon will need to obtain the necessary certificate of authorizations 

from the Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and the Fight 

against Climate Change [Ministère du Développement durable, de l'Environnement et de 

la Lutte contre les changements climatiques (MDDELCC)] (which is the Ministry 

responsible for anything relating to the environment and environmental impacts). It is

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment 

for the Miller Graphite and Marble Project,

expected that separate authorizations will be needed for the following components of the 

Project: 

 marble quarry  

 Miller graphite quarry 

 Miller graphite production 

 Miller treatment plant 

 Asbury thermal plant 

The Environment Quality Act requires an environmental impact assessment in the case of 

a mining project for the development and operation of "any other mine that has a 

production capacity of 500 metric tons or more per day" (other than a metal, asbestos, 

uranium or rare earth mine). Quarries within the meaning of the Regulation respecting 

pits and quarries, CQLR c. Q-2, r 7, are not subject to the Quebec impact assessment 

procedure. However, this exception does not apply to graphite mines which are 

specifically excluded from the definition of "quarry" under the Regulation respecting pits 

and quarries.  

The Project would have a maximum graphite (a non-metal) mill feed rate of 499 t/d (from 

the Miller graphite quarry), maximum marble production rate of 150,000 t/a (or 

approximately 411 t/d—from the Miller marble quarry) and maximum refined graphite 

production of 1,500 t/a (from the Asbury thermal plant). Therefore, the Project is not 

subject to the Quebec environmental impact assessment procedure. 

The federal Regulations Designating Physical Activities, SOR/2012-147 (the 

"Regulation") identify the physical activities that constitute the "designated projects" that 

may require an environmental assessment by the Canadian Environmental Assessment 

Agency under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012, S.C. 2012, c. 19 (CEA 

Act 2012). Sections of the Regulations which are applicable to the Project include: 

Section 1(d), which includes the construction, operation, decommissioning, and 

abandonment in a wildlife area or migratory bird sanctuary of a new mine or mill; and 

Section 16(a), which includes the construction, operation, decommissioning, and 

abandonment of the following projects:  

 a metal mill with input capacity of 4,000 t/d or more 

 a stone quarry or sand or gravel pit, with production capacity of 3.5 Mt/a or 

more. 

The Project is not situated within a wildlife area (area of public lands set out in Schedule I 

of the Canadian, Wildlife Area Regulation) or a migratory bird sanctuary (per the 

Canadian, Migratory Bird Sanctuary Regulation) and does not fall under any of the project 

categories listed under Section 16(a) of the Regulations. As such, the Project does not 

require an environmental assessment by the Canadian Environmental Assessment 

Agency.

A preliminary summary of permitting and authorisations needed prior to construction and 

development of the Project is presented in Table 20.1. 

The Commission for the Protection of Agricultural Territories of Quebec (Commision de la 

Protection du Territoire Agricole du Quebec (CPTAQ)) is a Quebec governmental agency 

with a mandate to protect and preserve agricultural lands. Authorization from CPTAQ is 

required for the use of land in an agricultural zone for purposes other than agriculture. An 

agricultural suitability assessment of the Miller Property area was completed for Canada 

Carbon in 2015. The assessment results indicate that the soils covering the assessed 

area are not suitable for agricultural use based on their emplacement (unfavorable 

topographic slope), high stone content (making it difficult for tilling), unfavorable moisture 

content, and low natural fertility. Historic mining activities also mark the Miller Property, 

which show characteristics of broadly distributed disturbances. 

Work on the reports and applications required to obtain a Certificate of Authorization 

from MDDELCC to develop the Project are currently on the way. Key findings to date 

include the presence of wetlands and the presence of four plant species that have a 

special status in Quebec occurring within the area proposed to be disturbed by the 

Project mining facilities. 

In summary, environmental laws and regulations that may apply to development of the 

Project include, but are not limited to, the following: 

 Mining Act/Regulation respecting mineral substances other than petroleum, 

natural gas, and brine 

 Sustainable Forest Development Act/Regulation respecting standards of forest 

management for forests in the domain of the State 

 Environment Quality Act/Regulation respecting pits and quarries 

 An Act Respecting Occupational Health and Safety/Regulation respecting 

occupational health and safety in mines 

 Natural Heritage Conservation Act 

 Groundwater Catchment Regulation 

 An Act Respecting the Conservation and Development of Wildlife 

 An Act Respecting Threatened or Vulnerable Species. 

The Miller Property is located within the Municipality of Grenville-sur-la Rouge on private 

property within the Agroforestry (AF) land use zone, and the Asbury Property is located 

within the Municipality of Notre-Dame-du-Laus within the heavy industrial land use zone.  

According to respective land use plans, it is not expected that changes to land use zoning 

will be required.

The Miller Property is composed of 31 contiguous claims covering an area of 

1,863.09 ha.  It is primarily vegetated by leafy trees which mainly consist of maple, birch 

and aspen, with few firs that have been partly cleared or selectively logged and 

replanted. Small swamp and peat land are scattered all over the flat areas, whereas 

steeper hillsides and ridge tops display large rock outcrops. A power line crosses the 

southern part of the Miller Property.

20.2.1 PHYSIOGRAPHY 

Physiography of the Miller and Asbury properties are described above Section 5.4. 

20.2.2 SURFACE DRAINAGE 

The Miller Property appears to be located within the Calumet River watershed to the 

north, which flows into the Ottawa River and within the Ottawa River watershed to the 

south. At least nine watercourses meander through the Miller Property, three of which are 

permanent and six intermittent. The Calumet River is the most important in terms of size 

and flow rate. The Asbury Property appears to be within the Cotton/Snake Stream 

watershed that joins the Du Lièvre River, which eventually flows into the Ottawa River 

approximately 62 km upstream of the Calumet River outlet into the Ottawa River. 

Approximately 15 watercourses meander through the Asbury Property area, of which only 

one is permanent (CD8) and the remainder intermittent. Hydrology studies are planned to 

take place from February to May 2016 for the Miller Property and from July to September 

2016 for the Asbury Property. Results from the project design, geochemistry, water 

quality, hydrology, and hydrogeology studies will be used to develop the site water 

balance (quality, quantity and flow) for each property. 

20.2.3 HYDROGEOLOGY 

Hydrogeology studies are planned to take place from February to May 2016 for the Miller 

Property and from July to September 2016 for the Asbury Property. Results from the 

project design, geochemistry, water quality, hydrology, and hydrogeology studies will be 

used to develop the site water balance (quality, quantity and flow) for each property.  

20.2.4 MIGRATORY BIRDS 

Timing of migratory birds nesting periods should be considered prior to tree removal and 

site preparation for construction and mining. Provided best management practices and 

mitigation measures are used during tree removal, harm to migratory birds is not 

anticipated. 

20.2.5 MILLER WETLANDS, VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE 

The Miller Property is located within the "white-tailed deer yard" as defined in Quebec 

"Regulation respecting wildlife habitats" of the "An Act respecting the conservation and 

development of wildlife".  Environmental fieldwork was completed on 67 ha of the Miller 

Property, by the Bureau d'écologie appliquée on August 24, 25 and 28, 2015. The Miller 

Property is covered by wetlands and mixed forest. There are at least six wetland areas 

comprised of treed swamps, shrub swamps, treed peatbogs, marshes and ponds all of 

which cover approximately 12 ha, or 18% of the studied area.  The ecological values of 

the wetlands vary from low (treed swamp (MH1)), to medium (shrub swamps (MH2) and 

treed peatbogs (MH3 and MH4)) to high (shrub and treed swamps, marshes and ponds 

(MH5) and forested bogs, marshes and pond (MH6)). The rest of the study area is

composed of terrestrial environments including, previously harvested uneven-aged 

hardwood and mixed forest stands (partial cuts).   

There were 259 different plant species identified during the exhaustive inventory 

including 14 with special status or species of interest. Of these, four are likely to be 

designated as threatened or vulnerable in Québec (Carex baileyi, Cypripedium reginae, 

Juglans cinerea, Spiranthes casei) and one is designated as vulnerable in Québec (Allium 

tricoccum). The butternut tree (Juglans cinerea) is also designated as an endangered 

plant species in Canada.  

One animal species with special status was observed: the pickerel frog, Lithobates 

palustris (likely to be designated as threatened or vulnerable in Québec).  

Measures for avoidance of species designated as vulnerable to harvesting will be 

evaluated and assessed as part of the work needed for completing Certificate of 

Authorisation requirements.  Where avoidance is not possible, mitigation measures such 

as relocation will be evaluated. These measures are intended to provide information for 

developing a global compensation plan. There are no legal actions stipulated for these 

species under the Act Respecting Threatened or Vulnerable Species or its accompanying 

regulation. 

20.2.6 ASBURY WETLANDS, VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE  

Environmental fieldwork was completed on 50 ha of the Asbury Property, by the Bureau 

d'écologie appliquée, on August 26 and 27, 2015. The main environmental components 

of the study area were characterized. Approximately 15% of the study area is covered by 

13 separate wetland areas (including treed swamps, shrub swamps, treed peat bogs, 

fen-type (open) peatlands, and marshes and ponds) of low to high ecological value 

(artificial lakes are also present). The remaining 85% of the study area is covered by 

uneven-aged hardwood and mixed forest stands that have been harvested (partial cuts) 

and the disturbed footprint of past mining activities. There were 200 different plant 

species identified during plant inventory including two plant species with special status or 

species of interest (both are designated as vulnerable to harvesting).  The potential for 

the site to contain other plant species of special status is considered very low.  No animal 

species with special status was observed during the inventory process, however no 

specific wildlife inventory was conducted.  There is a moderate potential for the site to 

contain animal species of special status (particularly for the hoary bat, the silver-haired 

bat, the eastern red bat and the pickerel frog). 

Measures for avoidance of species designated as vulnerable to harvesting will be 

evaluated and assessed as part of the work needed for completing Certificate of 

Authorisation requirements.  Where avoidance is not possible, mitigation measures such 

as relocation will be evaluated. These measures are intended to provide information for 

developing a global compensation plan. There are no legal actions stipulated for these 

species under the Act Respecting Threatened or Vulnerable Species or its accompanying 

regulation.

20.2.7 SOILS 

Characteristics of soil cover underlying the Miller Property vary throughout the site. Soil 

texture ranges from sand to sandy loam, or clay soil in places, with thickness ranging 

from 15 to 35 cm. The top layer consists of organic litter that decomposes to humus 

within the top 10 cm. Bedrock outcrops can be observed at several locations. Based on 

the Canada Land Inventory map on Soil Capability for Agriculture and confirmed during 

their site visit on August 28, 2015, the soil cover at the Miller Property ranges from: 

 Class 4MF – soils with deficient moisture and low natural fertility, that have 

severe limitations that restrict the choice of crops, or require special 

conservation practices and very careful management, or both 

 To Class 6 MT – soils with deficient moisture and adverse relief because of 

steepness or pattern of slopes, that are unsuited for cultivation, but are capable 

of use for unimproved permanent pasture 

 To Class 7 TP – stony soils with adverse relief because of steepness or pattern 

of slopes, that have no capability for arable culture or permanent pasture. 

Previous disturbance at the Miller Property is evident by presence of several abandoned 

mine shafts and mine waste material related to a historical mine operations.  The Miller 

site is not suitable for agricultural use. 

20.2.8 SUITABILITY FOR SUGAR BUSH WITH MAPLE PRODUCTION POTENTIAL 

The Miller Property is located within an area potentially suitable for sugar bushes with 

maple production potential according to the CPTAQ. Although assessed, most of the area 

does not represent good potential for sugar bushes with maple production potential. 

However, one of the ecological stands was found to represent good suitability for sugar 

bushes with maple production potential if protected from anthropological disturbances.  

Measures for avoidance of areas suitable for sugar bushes with maple production 

potential will be evaluated and assessed as part of the work needed for completing 

Certificate of Authorization requirements.  Where avoidance is not possible, 

compensation measures will be evaluated. These measures are intended to provide 

information for developing a global compensation plan.  

20.2.9 OTHER 

Other potential detrimental effects associated with activities during the life of the Project 

include: increased dust, sulphur dioxide, volatile organic carbons, mono-nitrogen oxides 

and carbon monoxide concentrations in the air, and increased noise and vibrations. 

The following environmental management plans, specific for the Project, will be 

developed and implemented to minimize potential effects on the environment:

 metal leaching and acid rock drainage prevention and management plan 

 site-water management and surface erosion control 

 soil and overburden salvage and protection 

 waste (quarry, hazardous, municipal, and liquid wastes) 

 water (resource and potable). 

20.3 POTENTIAL SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACTS 

As mentioned in Section 4.1, the Miller Property is located in the Outaouais Region of 

southern Quebec, about 75 km west of Montreal, Quebec and 90 km east of Ottawa, 

Ontario. The closest cities are Grenville (5 km to the south) and Hawkesbury, Ontario 

(8 km to the south). The immediate vicinity of the Project is thinly populated and the 

existing settlements are mainly concentrated along Scotch Road with relatively limited 

local traffic. The Miller Property is composed of 31 contiguous claims covering an area of 

1,863.09 ha. The town of Grenville has a population of approximately 1,699 residents. 

As mentioned in Section 18.0, the graphite concentrate produced at the Miller Mine will 

be transported to Notre-Dame-du-Laus, where Canada Carbon intends to utilize the pre-

existing mining infrastructure at the historical Asbury Mine, a past graphite producer, to 

heat treat the graphite concentrate and to distribute the produced graphite. The Asbury 

Property is located in southern Quebec approximately 8.1 km northeast of the 

Municipality of Notre-Dame-du-Laus, approximately 6 km southwest of the town of Lac 

Serpent in the upper Laurentians region, and approximately 6.5 km west of the 

Papineau-Labelle Wildlife Reserve. The Municipality of Notre-Dame-du-Laus has an 

approximate population of 1,603 residents. 

Canada Carbon Inc. is committed to: 

 maintaining dialogue with the communities and other stakeholders within the 

area of influence in order to understand their concerns, minimize negative 

impacts, and to enhance environmental quality 

 training and educating employees to understand their environmental 

responsibility related to the Canada Carbon's operations and activities 

 operating in accordance with industry standards while complying with all 

applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations

stakeholders regarding this policy and on all matters pertaining to health, safety 

and the environment. 

 Sourcing the workforce from southern Quebec, with a priority for local citizens. 

Mine development and operations are expected to have a positive effect on local 

employment (Table 20.4) and economy. Supplies and labour will be sourced from 

southern Quebec with a priority to local citizens.  Potential issues of social concern are 

associated with annoyance from noise and vibration generation, air emissions, increased 

traffic, landscape and visual impacts, and disturbance or destruction of heritage 

resources.

Canada Carbon has designed a project that will minimize negative social effects while 

creating new jobs for residents in nearby communities and economic benefits from 

purchase of supplies and services. Dust, noise and vibration community concerns during 

each phase of the project will be minimized by implementing proactive adaptive 

management, which includes confirming management effort results through monitoring 

and documentation. Concerns associated with increased traffic will be minimized by 

adherence to applicable traffic bylaws.  The design includes measures to minimize 

landscape and visual impacts by leaving an appropriate vegetated buffer zone around 

the operations.  Site workers will be instructed on appropriate procedures for work in the 

event that an archaeological site or artifact is encountered during site preparation work 

to ensure adherence to applicable provincial and/or federal laws and regulations.  

Social engagement includes the following: 

 surface access agreement 

 meeting with the municipality 

 public consultation 

 meeting with Regional County Municipality (MRC)

20.4 MINE CLOSURE (REHABILITATION) REQUIREMENTS AND COSTS 

A Mine rehabilitation and restoration plan will be developed and submitted to the MERN 

in accordance with Division III, section 232 of the Mining Act and guidance from the 

1997, Government of Quebec "Guidelines for Preparing A Mining Site Rehabilitation Plan 

and General Mining Site Rehabilitation Requirements" ("Guide et Modalités de 

Préparation du Plan et Exigences Générales en Matière de Restauration des Sites 

Miniers au Québec").  

According to recently updated Québec Mining Law, the total amount of the financial 

guarantee depends on the rehabilitation plan and corresponds to 100% of the estimated 

cost with security payment schedule of three payments (50%, 25% and 25% of total 

costs) with security of half of the cost needed before the start of the operation. 

Canada Carbon will develop and submit the rehabilitation and restoration plan for 

approval to MERN prior to the start of project development.  The rehabilitation and 

restoration plan will meet the following Quebec Mining Law requirement: 

 description of the rehabilitation and restoration work relating to the Miller mine 

and Asbury thermal plant intended to restore the affected land to a satisfactory 

condition as agreed upon with regulators 

 description of dry stack tailings rehabilitation and stabilization work needed to 

prevent environmental damage that might be caused by the presence of tailings 

 description of possible progressive rehabilitation and restoration work, related 

conditions and phases of completion of the work 

 the conditions and phases of completion of the work in the event of final 

cessation of mining activities 

 a detailed estimate of the expected costs to be incurred for completing the work 

 in the case of an open pit mine, a backfill feasibility study. 

The guarantee covering the anticipated cost of completing the work required under the 

rehabilitation and restoration plan relevant to the Project must include: 

 rehabilitation and restoration of accumulation areas 

 geotechnical soil stabilization 

 water treatment 

 road-related work.

Preliminary closure plans for the Miller and Asbury properties include, but are not limited 

to, the following considerations: 

 preservation of topsoil and overburden for reclamation where possible 

 replacement of topsoil and overburden during reclamation as appropriate 

 soil analysis and quality amendment for productivity, reclamation success 

 contemporaneous reclamation 

 dismantling of buildings and surface infrastructure as agreed upon with the 

MERN 

 waste management according to applicable permits and regulations 

 elimination of unacceptable health hazards and ensuring public safety 

 confirmatory assessment, testing and remediation for potential site 

contamination 

 pit backfilling and flooding 

 development of a functional wetland habitat 

 site regarding and revegetation 

 site monitoring and management for habitat function to ensure self-sufficiency 

by sixth year after planting. 

The estimated cost for Project rehabilitation and closure is $1,000,000 and $10,000 per 

year for four years following mine closure, for water monitoring.  The estimated security 

payment schedule is as follows: 50% of rehabilitation guarantee amount to be paid 90 

days after Ministry approval of the rehabilitation and closure plan, 25% of rehabilitation 

guarantee amount one year later; and the remaining 25% of rehabilitation guarantee 

amount two years later. 

It is expected that the reclamation plans for the marble quarry permit and the graphite 

mine permit will be submitted separately.  The graphite mine permit is expected to be 

submitted approximately five months after the marble quarry permit for the 50%; 25% 

and 25% on the two successive years. 

For the PEA, a cost of $1,000,000 has been included in the initial years for mine 

rehabilitation and closure. Demolition of the mill and other infrastructures is assumed to 

be covered by salvage values of the process equipment. 

Closure plan costs have been estimated based on the rehabilitation of the tailings 

disposal area (pit backfilling work) and the sedimentation pond. The waste rock will be 

sold during the LOM. There will be no waste rock left to manage on site at closure.

21.2.4 WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE 

The estimate is organized according to the following hierarchical work breakdown 

structure (WBS): 

 Level 1 = Major Area 

 Level 2 = Area 

 Level 3 = Sub-area. 

21.2.5 ELEMENTS OF COST 

This capital cost estimate consists of four main parts: direct costs, indirect costs, Owner's 

costs, and contingency. 

DIRECT COSTS 

AACE International defines direct costs as: 

...costs of completing work that are directly attributable to its performance and are 

necessary for its completion. In construction, (it is considered to be) the cost of 

installed equipment, material, labor and supervision directly or immediately involved 

in the physical construction of the permanent facility. 

Examples of direct costs include mining equipment, process equipment, mobile 

equipment, and permanent buildings. 

The total direct cost for the Project is estimated to be $27.6 million. 

INDIRECT COSTS 

AACE International defines indirect costs as: 

...costs not directly attributable to the completion of an activity, which are typically 

allocated or spread across all activities on a predetermined basis. In construction, 

(field) indirects are costs which do not become a final part of the installation, but 

which are required for the orderly completion of the installation and may include, 

but are not limited to, field administration, direct supervision, capital tools, start-up 

costs, contractor's fees, insurance, taxes, etc. 

The total indirect cost for the Project is estimated to be $8.2 million. 

OWNER'S COSTS 

Owner's costs are costs assumed by the Owner to support and execute the Project. 

The Project execution strategy, in particular for construction management, involves the 

Owner working with an EPCM organization and supervising the general contractor(s).  The 

Owner's costs include home office staffing, home office travel, home office general

expenses, field staffing, field travel, general field expenses, community relations, and 

Owner's contingency. 

The total Owner's cost for the Project is estimated to be $1.4 million. 

CONTINGENCY 

When estimating costs for a project, there is always uncertainty as to the precise content 

of all items in the estimate, how work will be performed, what work conditions will be 

encountered during execution, etc.  These uncertainties are risks to a project, and these 

risks are often referred to as "known-unknowns", which means that the estimator is 

aware of the risks and, based on experience, can estimate the probable costs.  The 

estimated costs of the known-unknowns are referred to by cost estimators as "cost 

contingency".  Tetra Tech estimated a contingency for each activity or discipline based on 

the level of engineering effort as well as experience on past projects. 

The total contingency allowance for the Project is $7.1 million. 

21.2.6 CAPITAL COST EXCLUSIONS 

The following items have been excluded from this capital cost estimate: 

 working or deferred capital (included in the financial model) 

 financing costs 

 refundable taxes and duties 

 land acquisition 

 currency fluctuations 

 lost time due to severe weather conditions 

 lost time due to force majeure 

 additional costs for accelerated or decelerated deliveries of equipment, 

materials, or services resultant from a change in project schedule 

 warehouse inventories, other than those supplied in initial fills, capital spares, or 

commissioning spares 

 all project sunk costs (studies, exploration programs, etc.) 

 mine reclamation costs (included in the financial model) 

 mine closure costs (included in the financial model) 

 escalation costs.

21.3 OPERATING COST ESTIMATES 

21.3.1 MINING OPERATING COSTS 

Canada Carbon provided Tetra Tech with a copy of a signed letter of intent with a 

potential mining contractor.  The following are the key conditions of the agreement: 

 Canada Carbon will pay a total of $7.24/t of material that is both mined and 

crushed to 0 to 20 mm (which includes $1.24/t for the blasting). 

 The removal of overburden is to be done at a cost of $4.00/m3 or at hourly 

equipment rates (which include labour), depending on which option is less 

expensive. 

 The Operator (i.e., potential contractor) will remove, consume or dispose of the 

material that is not deemed by Canada Carbon to be graphite material or marble 

slabs, and will pay to Canada Carbon $1.00/t for the waste material. 

For the supporting and ancillary equipment, Canada Carbon will lease the following 

equipment and has provided the equipment rates.  Table 21.3 shows the equipment

21.3.2 PROCESS OPERATING COSTS 

For the high-purity graphite production, the LOM average unit process operating cost is 

estimated at $54.78/t milled or $5,994/t graphite at an average mill feed grade of 

1.10% graphitic carbon, including the thermal upgrading cost of $17.52/t milled, or 

$1,917/t graphite.

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment 

for the Miller and Marble Graphite Project, Grenville 

Township, Quebec, Canada 

  

 

The average unit process operating cost at a mill feed rate of 200 t/d is estimated to be 

$88.77/t milled or $4,251/t graphite at an average mill feed grade of 2.47% graphitic 

carbon.  The estimate is based on 12 h/shift, 24 h/d, and 365 d/a. 

The breakdown process operating costs for the initial four years are summarized in Table 

21.7 and the process operating cost distributions are illustrated in Figure 21.1.  All the 

costs are in Canadian fund, unless specified. The process operating costs do not include 

the costs associated with graphite shipments to customers or royalties. 

Figure 21.1 Process Operating Cost Distribution 

 

The process operating cost estimate includes: 

 personnel requirements, including supervision, operation and maintenance; 

salary/wage levels, including burdens, based on the Q1 2016 labour rates at 

Quebec, Canada; the maintenance at the Asbury site is assumed to be 

contracted out. 

 mill liner and grinding media consumption, estimated from the in-house data  

and experience 

 maintenance supplies, based on approximately 7% of major equipment capital 

costs 

 reagent consumptions based on test results and reagent prices estimated 

according to Tetra Tech's in-house database 

 other operation consumables including laboratory and service vehicles

CONSUMABLES AND MAINTENANCE/OPERATION SUPPLIES 

At a processing rate of 200 t/d, the operating costs for major consumables and 

maintenance/operation supplies were estimated at $22.57/t milled or $1,081/t 

graphite. 

The costs for major consumables, which include metal and reagent consumables, were 

estimated at $2.64/t milled or $126/t graphite.  

The cost for maintenance/operation supplies was estimated at $19.93/t milled or 

$955/t graphite.  Maintenance supplies were estimated based on approximately 7% of 

major equipment capital costs. 

POWER 

The total process power cost was estimated at $10.61/t milled or $508/t graphite.  The 

electricity will be supplied by grid lines.  The power unit costs are estimated based on the 

preliminary plant equipment loads and a power unit cost of $0.075/kWh at the Miller site 

or $0.077/kWh at the Asbury site. 

TAILINGS 

Tailings management costs were estimated to be $7.08/t milled or $339/t graphite.  The 

flotation tailings will be dewatered by thickening followed by filtration to a moisture 

content of approximately 15% w/w.  The filter cakes will then be hauled by trucks to the 

tailings stacking pad for storage. 

CONCENTRATE TRANSPORT COST 

The estimated flotation concentrate transport cost is approximately $0.46/t milled (or 

$22/t graphite). 

21.3.3 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE 

G&A costs are costs that do not relate directly to the mining or processing operating 

costs.  The total annual cost was estimated to be approximately $1.5 million.  The 

average LOM unit G&A cost was estimated at $12.03/t milled or $1,316/t graphite at an 

average mill feed grade of 1.10% graphitic carbon.  For the initial four-year operation at a 

mill feed rate of approximately 200 t/d, the average unit G&A cost was estimated to be 

$21.18/t milled or $1,014/t graphite at an average mill feed grade of 2.47%.  The G&A 

costs include: 

 personnel – general manager and staffing in accounting, purchasing, 

environmental, site maintenance and other G&A departments.  The estimated 

total employee number is six.  The salaries and wages are based on the Q1 

2016 labour rates at Quebec, Canada, including base salary or wage and 

related burdens.

22.0  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS  

A PEA should not be considered to be a prefeasibility or feasibility study, as the 

economics and technical viability of the Project have not been demonstrated at this time.  

The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are 

considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to 

them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  Furthermore, there 

is no certainty that the conclusions or results as reported in the PEA will be realized.  

Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic 

viability. 

Tetra Tech prepared an economic evaluation of the Project based on a pre-tax financial 

model.  The NPV was estimated at the beginning of the one-year construction period. 

As indicated in Section 19.0 of this report, the graphite and marble prices used in the 

economic analysis are as follows: 

 graphite: USD13,000/t 

 marble: $184/t 

 exchange rate (USD:CAD): 0.75:1.00 

The following pre-tax financial results were calculated: 

 100.2% IRR 

 1.9-year payback on $44.4 million initial capital costs 

 $149.7 million NPV at an 8% discount rate. 

Canada Carbon and its external tax advisors prepared the tax calculations for use in the 

post-tax economic evaluation of the Project with the inclusion of Canadian Federal and 

Quebec income taxes, and the Quebec Mining Tax (see Section 22.5 for further details). 

The following post-tax financial results were calculated: 

 85.0% IRR 

 2.0-year payback on $44.4 million initial capital costs 

 $110.0 million NPV at an 8% discount rate. 

Analyses were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of the Project merit measures (NPV, 

IRR, and payback periods) to the main inputs.

22.2.1 BASIS OF FINANCIAL EVALUATION 

The Project is anticipated to produce refined graphite and marble.  Marble will be sold 

directly in blocks without any further processing.  For graphite, the production schedule 

has been incorporated into the 100% equity pre-tax financial model to develop annual 

refined graphite production from the relationships of tonnage processed, head grades, 

and recoveries. 

Gross revenues were calculated using a base case graphite price, marble price, and 

exchange rate.  Net revenues were then estimated by subtracting applicable off-site 

transportation costs (applicable to marble only) and royalties.  Annual operating costs for 

mining, processing, G&A and others were deducted from the net revenues to derive the 

annual operating cash flows. 

Initial and sustaining capital costs, land acquisition costs, mine reclamation costs, as well 

as working capital, were incorporated on a year-by-year basis over the LOM.  These 

capital expenditures were then deducted from the operating cash flow to determine the 

net cash flow before taxes.

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment 

for the Miller Graphite and Marble Project, 

Grenville Township, Quebec, Canada 

  

 

Initial capital expenditures include costs accumulated prior to first production of marble 

and refined graphite.  Sustaining capital includes expenditures for mining and processing 

additions and replacement of equipment.  Initial and sustaining capital costs were 

estimated at $44.38 million and $3.61 million, respectively.  Land acquisition capital 

costs were estimated at $1.05 million.  Mine closure and reclamation costs were 

estimated at $1.04 million.  Total capital costs are $50.08 million. 

The pre-production construction period is assumed to be one year for marble and two 

years for graphite (i.e., graphite production starts one year after marble production 

starts).  The NPV of the Project was calculated at the beginning of the one-year 

construction period. 

Working capital is assumed to be one month of the annual on-site operating cost and 

fluctuates from year to year based on the annual operating cost.  The working capital is 

recovered at the end of the LOM. 

The undiscounted annual net cash flow and cumulative net cash flow are illustrated in

A PEA should not be considered to be a prefeasibility or feasibility study, as the 

economics and technical viability of the Project have not been demonstrated at this time.  

The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are 

considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to 

them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  Furthermore, there 

is no certainty that the conclusions or results as reported in the PEA will be realized.  

Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic 

viability. 

22.4 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 

Tetra Tech investigated the sensitivity of NPV, IRR and payback period to the key Project 

variables.  Using the base case as a reference, each of key variables was changed 

between -30% and +30% at a 10% interval while holding the other variables constant.  

The following key variables were investigated:

22.5 POST-TAX FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 

Tetra Tech relied on Canada Carbon and its external tax advisors to prepare tax 

calculations for use in the post-tax economic evaluation of the Project with the inclusion 

of Federal and Quebec income taxes, and the Quebec Mining Tax (QMD) as applicable to 

the Project at the time of report writing as of March 4, 2016. 

22.5.1 FEDERAL AND INCOME TAXES 

The combined federal and Quebec corporate tax rate is 26.9% in 2016 and will be 

reduced to 26.5% progressively by 2020. 

22.5.2 QUEBEC MINING DUTIES 

The QMD regime is based on the calculation of annual profits.  The progressive tax 

regime has three tax brackets of 16%, 22% and 28%.  The tax bracket applied to annual 

profit is based on the level of profit margin. 

Annual profit includes gross value and deducts the current expenses of the mining 

operation, depreciation allowances and a processing allowance based on the cost of the 

property used to process the mineralized material. 

The depreciation allowance, based on limits imposed by tax law, is on a 30% declining 

rate basis. 

The annual processing allowance is based on an amount of up to 20% of the cost of the 

processing assets. 

22.5.3 TAXES AND POST-TAX RESULTS 

At the base case graphite and marble prices, and exchange rate used for this study, the 

total estimated taxes payable on the Project profits are $70.50 million over the 18-year 

production life.  The components of the various taxes that will be payable for the base 

case are shown in Table 22.3.

25.0  INTERP RETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS  

25.1 DEPOSIT 

Understanding of the deposit geology is still preliminary; an increase in drilling may 

significantly change the geometry and interpretation of the mineral deposit. Increasing 

the quantity of drillholes will greatly benefit understanding of the marble geometry and 

the distribution of the high-grade mineralization. The presence of fault and displacing 

structures may also increase the reliability of the geological model. 

25.2 DRILLING AND RESOURCES ESTIMATION 

SGS verified the work conducted by SL Exploration Inc. and is comfortable with what has 

been completed as of the effective date of this report. Changes may be needed in drilling 

management and data acquisition in order to increase classification of the Mineral 

Resources. These changes are discussed further in Section 25.3. 

Geological and mineralized solids were modeled on vertical sections with the projection 

of 280 drillholes and surface samples using the assay values for graphitic carbon, at a 

modelling minimal value of 0.5%.  Numerous intercalated assays below this lower model 

value were still incorporated in the mineralized solids in order to respect the general 

geometry of the mineralization, but were always surrounded (top and bottom) by an assay 

higher than the modeling value.  Upon modeling the mineral zone, a block model was 

generated for the whole deposit (block size of 5 m by 5 m by 3 m).  The block model was 

also limited at surface by the overburden surface, which was modeled using lithological 

information from drillholes. 

Density measurements were conducted on drill core samples over the year and the 

values were used to generate a fixed density for each block.  This fixed density value is 

not ideal, but was the only possible outcome using the 48 density measurement made in 

the marble rock unit. 

Variographic studies were conducted for each of the four variables for GraphiteLG, 

GraphiteHG, Indicator and SLABprob.  The correlograms were used in the kriging process 

of the block interpolation but also to establish search ellipsoid parameters and 

classification criteria of the Mineral Resources.  The classification also accounted for the 

quality of the data, the geological comprehension and drilling grid.  Each variable was 

domained differently and interpolated using its own set of 1.5-m composite and 

parameters.  Upon interpolation of the variables, the GraphiteLG, the GraphiteHG and the 

Indicator variable were used to calculate the total graphitic carbon content of each block.

25.3 MINERAL RESOURCES 

The Mineral Resources for the Project are limited at depth by two scenarios of optimized 

pit shells, in order to account for the "reasonable prospect of eventual economic 

extraction" of reported Mineral Resources under the NI 43-101 regulation.  The pit shells 

outline three open pits that generate the maximum economic value.  However, this value 

does not take into account mine planning and time value of money (discounting rate).  It 

is for this reason that there are is guarantee that this shell shall be selected as the base 

case scenario to develop the mining scenario; and thus, to calculate the eventual in-pit 

reserves. 

The optimized pit shell scenarios were used to limit the extent of the Mineral Resources 

at depth.  The Mineral Resources are stated at different cut-off grades, depending on the 

pit they are part of.  The cut-off grades are: 

 graphite scenario pits: 0.8% graphitic carbon 

 graphite in Marble pit scenario: 0.4% graphitic carbon 

 marble pit scenario: 0.6 SLABprob. 

The Mineral Resources comprise 952,000 t of Inferred graphite resources at an average 

grade of 2.00% graphitic carbon with an additional 1.180 Mt of graphite resources at an 

average grade of 0.53% graphitic carbon, and 1.519 Mt of architectural marble 

resources. 

25.4 MINING METHODS 

The PEA proposes a 19-year LOM, including 1 year of pre-production, 11 years of active 

mining operations, and 7 years of stockpile re-handling.  Graphite material will be mined 

from two open pits and marble will be quarried from a separate pit.  Marble pit 

production will start one year ahead of the graphite pits. 

The graphite pits will be mined using conventional truck/loader open pit mining.  The 

production cycle will include drilling, blasting, loading and hauling and will be performed 

by a mining contractor.  Over the 10-year life of the graphite mine, the total production is 

estimated to be 890,805 t of graphite material, 1,479,770 t of waste rock, and 

158,279 t of overburden.  The LOM stripping ratio is 1.8, and the LOM average mill feed 

grade is 1.87% graphitic carbon, with an initial graphite mill feed grade of 2.45% 

graphitic carbon. 

The marble pit is scheduled to produce a maximum annual marble tonnage of 150,000 t.  

Marble will be cut into blocks using special marble cutting machinery.  Low-grade 

graphite mineralization mined from the marble pit will be stockpiled and reclaimed 

starting in Year 9.  Over the 8-year marble LOM, the pit is expected to produce 

1,182,037 t of marble, 1,206,051 t of graphite material grading 0.53% graphitic carbon, 

5,031,758 t of waste, and 210,468 t of overburden.  The overall LOM stripping ratio is 

2.2.

The mine production projection outlined is highly dependent on the base case graphite 

and marble price assumptions, cost assumptions, metallurgical recoveries, marble 

quality attribute provided in the block model, and assumptions related to pit geotechnical 

parameters, among others.  Any change in these assumptions may result in significant 

change in the mine production projection, and consequently the economics of the 

Project.  It should be noted that all factors pose potential risks and opportunities to the 

current mine plan. 

25.5 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The bench scale tests and pilot plant campaign on various samples from the Miller 

graphite deposit show the mineralization responds well to conventional flotation 

concentration, which is widely used in the graphite recovery industry.  On average, the 

flotation concentration can upgrade the head samples containing various graphitic 

carbon contents to approximately 95% or higher. Coarse size fractions of the 

concentrates produced a higher-graphitic grade.  It appears that on average, the head 

grade did not have a significant impact on the final concentrate grades. 

The preliminary concentrate purification tests, including using hydrometallurgical and 

thermal treatment procedures, showed that the concentrate samples were amendable to 

the purification treatments.  It appears that the thermal treatments produced better 

upgrading results.  A thermal treatment test using a proprietary thermal treatment 

method showed that a graphite concentrate produced from the pilot plant runs can be 

directly upgraded to a high-purity graphite containing 99.9998% graphitic carbon. 

According to the test results, a combined treatment of flotation concentration and 

thermal purification is proposed for recovering the graphite from the mineralization. 

25.6 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

A PEA should not be considered to be a prefeasibility or feasibility study, as the 

economics and technical viability of the Project have not been demonstrated at this time.  

The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are 

considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to 

them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  Furthermore, there 

is no certainty that the conclusions or results as reported in the PEA will be realized.  

Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic 

viability. 

Tetra Tech prepared an economic evaluation of the Project based on a pre-tax financial 

model.  The NPV was estimated at the beginning of the one-year construction period. 

As indicated in Section 19.0, the graphite and marble prices used in the economic 

analysis are as follows:

 graphite: USD13,000/t 

 marble: $184/t 

 exchange rate (USD:CAD): 0.75:1.00 

The following pre-tax financial results were calculated: 

 100.2% IRR 

 1.9-year payback on $44.4 million initial capital costs 

 $149.7 million NPV at an 8% discount rate. 

Canada Carbon and its external tax advisors prepared the tax calculations for use in the 

post-tax economic evaluation of the Project with the inclusion of Canadian Federal and 

Quebec income taxes, and the Quebec Mining Tax (see Section 22.5 for further details). 

The following post-tax financial results were calculated: 

 85.0% IRR 

 2.0-year payback on the $44.4 million initial capital costs 

 $110.0 million NPV at an 8% discount rate. 

Analyses were conducted to analyze the sensitivity of the Project merit measures (NPV, 

IRR and payback periods) to the following key variables:  

 graphite price 

 marble price 

 exchange rate 

 capital costs 

 operating costs. 

Using the base case as a reference, each of key variables was changed between -30% 

and +30% at a 10% interval while holding the other variables constant.  The pre-tax NPV, 

calculated at an 8% discount rate, was found to be most sensitive to exchange rate and, 

in decreasing order, graphite price, marble price, operating costs, and capital costs.  The 

Project's pre-tax IRR was found to be most sensitive to the capital costs followed by 

marble price, graphite price, exchange rate, and operating costs.  The payback period 

was found to be most sensitive to marble price followed by capital costs, graphite price, 

operating costs, and exchange rate.

26.0  RECOMMENDATIONS  

26.1 INTRODUCTION 

This section outlines the areas to investigate for improvements, and potential 

opportunities and risks, for the Project.  A high-level budgetary estimate for the 

completion of each recommended item is provided. 

Based on the results of the PEA, Tetra Tech recommends that Canada Carbon continue 

on to the next phase of work, a prefeasibility study, in order to further assess the 

technical and economic viability of the Project, and identify potential opportunities and 

risks. 

Canada Carbon has moved forward with some of the recommendations provided by Tetra 

Tech in order to facilitate and expedite the data collection and assessments required for 

a prefeasibility study, which is expected to be completed in September 2016. 

In 2015, Canada Carbon initiated environmental and hydrogeological assessments, 

which will be required for the permitting of the proposed open pits, the marble quarry, 

and graphite extraction. By conducting environmental and site assessments concurrent 

with the PEA program, it is expected that marble quarry production could begin in early 

2017, with graphite mining beginning approximately one year later. 

26.2 GEOLOGY 

In order to increase the level of confidence in the Mineral Resources and better quantify 

the natural variability of the different grades impacting the concentrate quantity, quality, 

and tonnage, SGS recommends the following: 

 geological/mineralization: 

 increase surface geological knowledge by conducting property scale 

mapping and structural study 

 refine geophysical interpretation to increase exploration success of 

disseminated and high grade mineralization 

 drilling: 

 establish a quantitative model for the marble quality parameter associated 

with the architectural marble resources, possibly using Corescan technology 

 conduct further drilling on a constant grid to increase geological knowledge 

and sample distribution in the deposit (Figure 26.1)

 included systematic downhole surveys and geotechnical measurements in 

the data acquisition of the drilling campaigns 

 conduct continuous channels to sample grade variability across surface 

exposures 

 remove all surface grab samples from resource estimation database in 

order to increase resources classification 

 use of a secure logging software for data acquisition 

 follow drilling progress using drawn sections and plan 

 sampling: 

 conduct continuous sampling at 1.5 m intervals in the mineralized marbles 

and other mineralized rock units 

 insert 5 to 10% QA/QC samples in the sampling stream. 

The drilling, as proposed in Figure 26.1, was completed in February 2016, which included 

systematic downhole surveys.  Secure logging software was used for data acquisition.  

The sampling was performed using 1.5-m intervals in all of the core lengths and 

approximately 8% of the QA/QC samples were inserted in the sampling stream.

Drilling, logging and assaying were completed in February 2016; however, SGS is not yet 

sure that this drilling will be sufficient to convert the Mineral Resources to Mineral 

Reserves.  Additional drilling may be needed upon review of the 2016 drilling results. 

26.3 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Preliminary test work has been completed for the Project to evaluate the metallurgical 

performances of various head grade samples, including a large-scale pilot plant 

campaign.  To better understand the metallurgical performances of the mineralization 

and to support next phase study and design work, additional test work should be 

conducted, especially thermal purification tests.  The recommended test work for the 

graphite recovery and purification proposed includes:  

 verification of metallurgical responses of the samples 

 further optimization of process conditions and improvement of graphite recovery 

and product grade 

 conducting variability flotation and thermal treatment tests to evaluate the 

metallurgical performances of the samples from different rock zones, lithological 

zones and spatial locations and the samples representative of the proposed 

mine plan 

 confirming and establishing process design related parameters, including 

comminution related data and concentrate and tailings dewatering 

characteristics 

 conducting environmental related tests to quantify the properties of the flotation 

tailings, waste rocks and the waste streams generated from thermal treatment, 

such as off-gases and solids collected from the gases 

 determining efficient and cost effective methods for handling the off-gases that 

are anticipated to be generated from the proposed thermal treatment. 

The estimated cost for this test work is approximately $250,000, including sample 

collection and shipment.

Marble physical and chemical characteristics should be determined.  The test work 

should include:  

 marble physical and chemical property tests, such as moisture absorption, 

surface hardness, texture and colour 

 marble slab quality assessment. 

The estimated cost for this test work is approximately $70,000, including sample 

collection and shipment. 

Further optimizations on plant designs, including primary comminution circuits, flotation 

and regrinding circuits, and thermal upgrading circuits and related layouts, are 

recommended.  The costs associated with the optimizations will be included in the costs 

for the next phase of study. 

26.4 MINING METHODS 

Tetra Tech makes the following recommendations for future mining work: 

 geotechnical studies should be conducted to define the appropriate pit slope 

angles 

 a hydrogeological study should be completed to define pit dewatering 

requirements 

 a trade-off study between Owner and contract mining is recommended. 

The estimated cost for the proposed mining work will be approximately $400,000. 

26.5 INFRASTRUCTURE 

The designs for the overall site infrastructure for this PEA study are very preliminary.  

Further investigations into geotechnical, power supply, hydrological and hydrogeological 

surveys should be conducted. Key investigations should include: 

 tailings management plan 

 detailed overall site water balance 

 power supply, especially at the Asbury site 

 geotechnical drilling at the pits, plant sites, water sediment pond and tailings 

storage area 

 overall site water management and balance, including: divert tunnel 

construction, hydrological and hydrogeological surveys 

 water treatment method and plant design.

The costs related to collect the infrastructure design parameters are estimated to be 

approximately $300,000. 

The overall site infrastructure layouts should be optimized.  The costs associated with the 

optimizations will be included in the costs for the next phase of study. 

26.6 ENVIRONMENT 

We understand that Canada Carbon began collecting environmental data for preparing 

permit applications in 2015.  The environmental management plan will need to be 

finalized and implemented prior to Project development.  The recommended 

environmental and permitting work includes:
