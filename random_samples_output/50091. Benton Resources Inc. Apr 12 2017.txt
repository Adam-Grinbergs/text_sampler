1. Summary 

This Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) was prepared for Benton Resources and Nordmin 
Engineering Ltd. for the Cape Ray Gold-Silver Property, located in southwestern Newfoundland, 
Canada. This report focuses on the deposits within the joint venture agreement known as Cape 
Ray 04, 41, 51 and Windowglass Hill.  

Benton acquired 100% interest in the Cape Ray Property on October 3, 2014 and entered in to a 
joint venture agreement with Nordmin on January 20, 2015. The property includes historical 
royalty agreements which are outlined in Section 4 "Property Description and Location".  

There are adjoining deposits known as Iles aux Morts and Big Pond which are held solely by 
Benton.  

This PEA was prepared by independent consultants, Marc Jutras, P.Eng. of Ginto Consulting Inc., 
John Folinsbee P.Eng. of Heads Ore Tails Metallurgy and Mike Petrina, P.Eng. of Moose Mountain 
Technical Services on behalf of the joint venture agreement between Benton Resources Inc. 
(Benton) and Nordmin Engineering Ltd. (Nordmin) and has an effective date of February 9, 2017. 

This PEA is based on an updated mineral resource estimate completed by Marc Jutras, P.Eng. 

The Cape Ray Property is located approximately 20 km north east of the town of Channel-Port 
aux Basques, Newfoundland and is shown below in Figure 1.1.

The 04, 41, 51 and Windowglass Hill (WGH) deposits shown in Figure 1.2 are located 
approximately at 58° 55' 47" W Longitude and 47° 45' 3" N Latitude. The Isles aux Morts River 
flows through the property and separates WGH deposit from the others and then flows south 
from the deposits into the ocean. 

 
Figure 1.2 Deposit Locations within Claim Boundary (Google Earth) 

The Cape Ray Fault Zone is a major structural boundary contained within the licence boundary of 
the Cape Ray property. It separates the Dunnage Zone to the northwest and the Gander Zone to 
the southeast. The Fault Zone is approximately 100 km long and up to 1 km wide, extending 
from Cape Ray in the southwest to Granite Lake to the northeast.  

Areas along and adjacent to the southwest portion of the Cape Ray Fault Zone have been 
subdivided into three major geological domains. From northwest to southeast they include: the 
Cape Ray Igneous Complex, the Windsor Point Group and the Port aux Basques gneiss. These 
units are intruded by several pre- to late-tectonic granitoid intrusions. The Cape Ray Igneous 
Complex comprises mainly large mafic to ultramafic intrusive bodies that are intruded by 
granitoid rocks. Unconformably overlying the Cape Ray Igneous Complex is the Windsor Point 
Group, which consists of bimodal volcanics and volcanoclastics with associated sedimentary 
rocks. The Port aux Basques gneiss is a series of high grade, kyanite-sillimanite-garnet, 
quartzofeldspathic pelitic and granitic rocks intercalated with hornblende schist or amphibolite. 

Hosted by the Cape Ray Fault Zone are the Cape Ray Gold Deposits consisting of three main 
mineralised zones: the 04, the 41 and the 51 Zones. These occur as quartz veins and vein arrays 
along a 1.8 km segment of the fault zone at or near the tectonic boundary between the Windsor 
Point Group and the Port aux Basques gneiss. The gold bearing quartz veins are typically located 
at or near the southeast limit of a sequence of highly deformed and brecciated graphitic schist. 
Other veins are present in the structural footwall and represent secondary lodes hosted by more 
competent lithologies.

1.1 Mineral Resource Estimate  

The mineral resource estimate of the Cape Ray project was developed using 1 m capped 
composited assays, and a geology model developed from first principles. The controls on gold 
and silver mineralization were associated with a marker horizon consisting of a graphitic schist 
along a northeast shear zone dipping to the southeast.  The grade estimation was performed 
using Ordinary Kriging (OK) on capped assays for Au and Ag. The search ellipsoids were 
dimensioned and oriented according to the variogram models for each modeled orebody of each 
mineralized zone. A total of 4 mineralized zones were estimated: the 51 Zone, the 04 Zone, the 
41 Zone, and the Windowglass Hill deposit. Estimated grades were interpolated into a rotated 
block model (X axis along 51° azimuth) with a block size of 3 m (X) x 3 m (Y) x 3 m (Z). A set of 
validation tests were carried out on the grade estimates to ensure that no local or global bias 
was present.  

The mineral resource was then classified based on the ranges from the variogram models. An 
average distance of composites utilized for grade estimation of equal or less than 40m would 
produce indicated resources, and inferred resources for longer average distances. Only inferred 
resources were defined for the Windowglass Hill deposit. The tonnage was calculated from an 
average specific gravity of 2.84. The Cape Ray mineral resource at various gold grade cut-offs, is 
presented in Table 1-1, with an effective date of February 1, 2017.

 Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no 1.

certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resources estimated will be converted into Mineral Reserves. The 
estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 
socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues 

 The CIM definitions were followed for the classification of Indicated, and Inferred mineral resources. 2.
 The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has 3.

been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource. It 
is reasonably expected that a portion of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded with continued exploration.

1.2 Preliminary Economic Assessment 

The potential minable resource (PMR) for this PEA was estimated at 2.94MT averaging a 
combined grade of 2.5 g/t gold and 8.1 g/t silver. Open pit minable resource consists of 2.79MT 
tonnes with anticipated dilution of 10% and mining loss of 5%. The remaining 151,000 minable 
resource tonnes from underground include a dilution of 20%.  

Mill recovery rates based on preliminary tests are estimated to be 98% for gold resulting in 
approximately 235,000 ounces recoverable gold and 63% for silver resulting in approximately 
483,000 ounces recoverable silver.

1.3 Capital and Operating Costs 

The Cape Ray Project has been envisioned as a combined open-pit and underground mining 
operation. Open-pit and underground mining are anticipated to be completed by contract 
mining companies. The equipment would be supplied by the contractor that is awarded the 
work. 

Grid electrical power would provide the majority of the electrical power to the project over the 
life of the mine. The work force is expected to come from the Isle aux Morts area for the 
operation of the Mill. The rest of the workforce will be the responsibility of the contractor.

1.4 Production and Processing 

Operations for the Cape Ray project is planned to have combined Open Pit and Underground 
Mining. Each deposit could be campaigned separately with use of contractors.  The initial mill 
feed will come from the 04 zone. Once the 04 pit is completed the 51 pit will commence to be 
mined followed by the 41 pit. The underground development for the 04 zone will start during 
the mining of the 51 pit. The start of the Window Glass pit will begin once the 41 pit is mined.  

The envisioned process plant includes conventional crushing, grinding, gravity, and cyanide 
leach. A gold and silver doré would be produced on site. Process reagents would be removed 
from the plant tailings prior to placement in a tailings management facility.

1.5 Conclusions  

The project provides significant positive and robust returns. Significant increase in project IRR 
can be achieved (indicated by sensitivity analysis) through reducing capital expenditures by 10 to 
20%. This savings could be realized in part by sourcing a used processing plant and/or used 
processing equipment. Used processing plant equipment is still available, although the market 
has contracted and careful due diligence on equipment is required. Savings of up to 20% in the 
processing plant capital costs may be realized. The potential for custom milling of potentially 
economic mineralization at processing plants in the region could also improve project returns as 
capital expenditures for a plant and tailings management area would be significantly reduced.

1.6 Recommendations 

Based on the positive results of this PEA the recommendations are:  

 Additional diamond drilling should be done so existing Inferred Resources may be 
upgraded to Indicated Resources status as defined by NI 43-101. 

 Incorporate oriented core (Geotechnical) with above drilling for rock mechanics 
engineering.  

 Hydrology drilling at a pre-feasibility level. 

 Advancing the Cape Ray project toward prefeasibility through additional exploration, 
environmental permitting and further studies.

It is proposed that a three phase approach be implemented such that results from Phase 1 can 
be the baseline for Phase 2, and Phase 2 can be the baseline for Phase 3.  

Phase 1 consists of upgrading the on-site camp facilities, site LIDAR survey, infill and exploration 
drilling to convert additional resources from inferred to indicated and to expand the resource.  
Concurrent with drilling, desk top environmental studies hydrology and surface water baseline 
studies and geotechnical studies would be conducted to move the data to a feasibility level. The 
location of diamond drill holes that meet the requirements of the geotechnical study would be 
incorporated into the overall diamond drilling program. 

Phase 2 would include updating the geological model utilizing the new drill results, further 
environmental studies to satisfy the EIS including Geochemical testing and analysis, tailings 
design and beginning the feasibility study. 

Phase 3 would see preparation of the EIS and submission to the Newfoundland EA Division and 
CEAA, a NFLD Hydro Study, upgrades to the access road and completion of the mineral resource 
estimate and feasibility study.

The closest municipality to the Cape Ray is Isles aux Morts, which is approximately 16 km away 
as shown in Figure 4-3.  

 
Figure 4-3 Nearest Municipalities 

Access to the Cape Ray site is by gravel road, which is off highway 470 just outside of the town of 
Isle aux Morts and is around 22 km long as shown in Figure 4-5 

4.1.2 Proximity to any Permanent, Seasonal or Temporary Residences 

The Project is currently within approximately two kilometers of the nearest Seasonal or 
Temporary Residence as illustrated in photo below. There are also approximately 20 seasonal 
dwellings such as this along the mine access road and they are primarily used only during the 
hunting season. The location of these seasonal dwellings will be mapped and the owners of the 
dwellings will be notified of all project activities as part of the Public Consultation Process.

4.1.3 Proximity to any Aboriginal Traditional Lands, Sites or Communities. 

The most proximate Aboriginal community to the Project site is the Miawpukek community in 
Bay d'Espoir, formerly known as the "Conne River". It is approximately 230 kilometres to the 
east of the Project site. It is not known at this time if the Project site is proximate to any 
traditional territories, archaeological sites, lands or resources currently being used for traditional 
purposes by Indigenous Peoples. This information will be acquired as part of the baseline studies 
proposed to support the EA. 

4.1.4 Proximity to Federal Lands 

The closest federal land holding to the Project site is the sea port of Port aux Basques which is 
approximately 25 kilometres to the southwest.

The main watershed of the site area is the Isles aux Morts River watershed, which has provincial 
monitoring stations recording watershed data. All of the zones, which are being considered for 
mining, fall in this watershed shown in Figure 4-6. 

The Isle aux Morts River is a Scheduled Salmon River and as such is subject to special 
management procedures and protection by the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of 
Natural Resources.

4.2 Alternatives to the Project  

Benton Resources is actively exploring and evaluating other mineral deposit targets in the 
immediate area surrounding the Cape Ray deposits. 

Should the PEA show that the project is not economically viable to mine, extract and process the 
minerals, particularly gold, the alternative is to do nothing until such time as market conditions 
change. 

Other alternatives include continued exploration activities to further solidify resource, reserve 
estimates and continue with the PEA and feasibility studies.

4.3 Land Tenure  

As of December 11, 2015, Benton is the holder of 1169 claims in Newfoundland and Labrador. In 
the Cape Ray area, Benton holds approximately 355 claims.  

Benton acquired 100% interest in the Cape Ray Property on October 3, 2014 and entered into a 
joint venture agreement covering a portion of the property with Nordmin Engineering on 
January 20, 2015. The claims in the Cape Ray area cover the deposits which are a part of the 
Nordmin joint venture (JV) as shown in Figure 4-7 below. 

 
Figure 4-7 Nordmin-Benton JV Zone within Cape Ray Claims 

 
A listing of the Cape Ray claims and their associated royalties are below in Table 4-1.  

The Crown holds all surface rights in the Project area. None of the property or adjacent areas are 
encumbered in any way. The area is not in an environmentally or archeologically sensitive zone 
and there are no aboriginal land claims or entitlements in this region of the province. 

There has been no commercial production at the property as of the time of this report.

4.4 Nordmin Benton Joint Venture Agreement 

On January 20, 2015, Benton Resources entered in to a joint venture agreement with Nordmin 
Engineering, pursuant to which Nordmin will earn a 50% interest in the Cape Ray Project through 
a series of expenditures and services to be provided. Summarized below are the highlights of the 
Agreement: 

Under the terms of the Agreement, Benton will form a 100% wholly owned subsidiary, ("SubCo 
B" for illustrative purposes) and transfer 100% of Benton's property rights in the Project to 
SubCo B. Nordmin may then earn up to 50% of the Project held by SubCo B by completing a 
series of work commitments and project milestones which is well underway advancing the 
Project towards production as follows:  

 Benton will lead the exploration effort for the project which will be funded by 
Nordmin up to the completion of the Feasibility Study. This includes any infill 
drilling to allow the Projects to be brought up to National Instrument 43-101 
status ("NI 43-101"). The necessity for further exploration will be determined 
and approved by the management committee; 

 Nordmin will, earn a 5% interest, make a $250,000 cash payment in two 
tranches to SubCo B which will go towards the current exploration program; 

 Nordmin will, earn a further 15% interest, fund and provide the services 
required to complete NI 43-101 resource estimates for the 04, 41, 51, and 
Windowglass Hill deposits, produce a resource model, a preliminary economic 
assessment (PEA), complete a detailed assessment of the Geology, Mining, 
Metallurgy, Environmental, Engineering, Construction, Economics and Schedule 
for the Project; 

 Nordmin will, earn a further 10% interest, complete the Environmental 
Assessment and Impact reviews, and secure the necessary permits for a mine, 
mill and related plant in order for the Project to move forward; 

 Nordmin will, earn a further 10%, complete a feasibility study for the Project 
(detailing and advancing all of the same issues within the PEA); 

 Nordmin will, earn a further 10% interest, complete detailed design of the mine, 
mill and related plant and work to arrange a minimum of 50% of the Project 
financing; 

 Nordmin will assume operatorship of the Project upon signing. 

The QP has not reviewed the Joint Venture Agreement, but has reviewed the Benton press 
release dated January 20th, 2015 summarizing the agreement and accepts that the information 
provided by Nordmin is accurate and complete. 

4.5 Environmental Liabilities and Other Risks to Development 

Mr. John Sferrazza, Environmental Scientist and Director of Environmental Services for Nordmin 
has visited the site and surrounding areas extensively through 2014, and throughout the 
exploration programs in 2015 and 2016. No obvious environmental liabilities were noted during

these visits other than the flooded underground workings from the previous owner. Benton is 
also not aware of any current liabilities.  

At the time of the 2014/2015 visit, water was pooled in front of the adit from the previous mine 
workings and was reporting to a series of collection ditches and holding ponds prior to 
discharging to the Isle aux Morts River. Water samples were taken from the portal mouth as well 
as from the collection ditches and ponds. The results of these analyses are presented in Section 
20 and show that the current water quality meets Newfoundland and Labrador Regulation 65/03 
wastewater quality criteria as well as most water quality criteria established in the Canadian 
Water Quality Guidelines for the protection of Aquatic Life. Further water quality surveys of the 
surrounding watersheds were conducted in 2015 as part of the environmental monitoring 
program conducted during the exploration efforts. These data are presented in Section 20. 
Should Nordmin and Benton proceed with developing the mineral resource on the property, 
environmental baseline studies will be undertaken for environmental assessment, permitting 
and closure plan requirements.  

Environmental risks include the sites proximity to the Isle aux Morts River which is a Scheduled 
Salmon River by the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Natural Resources.  

4.6 Permits Required 

Permits that will potentially be required for exploration work include a Surface Lease and 
Mineral Exploration Approval both issued by the Newfoundland Department of Natural 
Resources, Mineral Development Division. A Water Use Licence may also be required from the 
Newfoundland Department of the Environment and Conservation, Water Resources Division, as 
well as a Certificate of Approval for Septic System for water use and disposal for project site 
facilities. Licence to Operate a Temporary Work Camp on Crown Land will also be required for 
any exploration work. At the time of the writing of this updated PEA Nordmin/Benton have 
acquired the 2016 Exploration Approval, Licence to Occupy for the Temporary Work Camp and 
the Water Use Licence. 

Permits that will potentially be required for the construction and development of a mining and 
production facility are outlined in the Table below including any Federal Approvals that will be 
necessary.

5. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources and Infrastructure 

5.1 Accessibility 

The Cape Ray Project is located approximately 25 km northeast of the coastal town of Channel-
Port aux Basques, Newfoundland (population: 4,170 – 2011 census), and 20 km north of the 
coastal community of Isle aux Morts, Newfoundland (population: 600 – 2011 census) as shown in 
Figure 5-1. 

 
Figure 5-1 Project Location with Nearby Ferry Service. (Google Earth) 

Port aux Basques is one of the ports which the Marine Atlantic ferry service provides year-round 
service to and connects the island of Newfoundland with mainland Canada at North Sydney, 
Nova Scotia as illustrated in Figure 5-2.

Direct road access to the Cape Ray East Property is via a 22 km long, rough gravel road that 
extends north-northeast from Route 470 to provide access to the deposits. The gravel access 
road was originally constructed in 1989 with minor road upgrades in 2003. The road begins 2.5 
km west of the community of Isle aux Mort as shown in Figure 5-3.

Figure 5-3 Site Access Road. Google Earth. 

The access road is currently used for diamond drill and personnel access to the site during the 
summer months. A series of ATV trails provide access to the other deposits on the property. 
Route 470 (La Poile Highway) is a coastal, paved regional highway that begins at the Port aux 
Basques ferry terminal at the intersection with the Trans-Canada Highway (Route 1) and ends 
approximately 40 km to the East in the community of Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou (population 
547 – 2006 census) (see Figure 5-1).  

Access to the more remote Windowglass Hill deposit on the west side of the Isle aux Morts River 
(see Figure 5-4) currently requires either the use of a helicopter or acquisition of provincial and 
federal government permits for temporarily fording the Isle aux Morts River. These permits 
include an "Environmental Permit to alter a Body of Water"; issued by the provincial Department 
of Environment and Conservation, Water Resources Management Division, and a "Letter of 
Advice" issued by the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). Accessibility to certain 
areas of the Cape Ray Property can be difficult due to the varied terrain and in some instances 
helicopter is the most practical method of transportation of equipment and personnel to drill 
sites or for other surface exploration activities. Helicopter service is available from commercial 
bases in the Deer Lake-Pasadena area, approximately 180 km (100 nautical miles) to the 
northeast.

5.2 Climate 

The climate of southwestern coastal Newfoundland is strongly affected by its proximity to the 
Atlantic Ocean (Cabot Strait), which exerts a moderating effect with respect to temperature 
extremes. However, dramatic seasonal variations occur, with winter conditions of freezing 
temperatures and moderate to heavy snowfall expected from late October through late April. 
Spring and fall seasons are cool, with frequent periods of rain and heavy fog. Summer conditions 
typically prevail from July through late September, and generally the operating season is fairly 
short for field exploration and drilling (from late May following spring break-up to late 
September). 

Environment Canada's 1981 to 2010 records for the coastal community of Isle aux Morts, located 
approximately 20 km south of the Cape Ray Property, show daily mean temperatures in August 
of 15.8°C and an average maximum August daily temperature of 19.0°C (see Table 5-1). The 
average daily winter maximum temperature in February is -2.4°C and the corresponding average 
minimum is -9.2°C.

Table 5-1 Climate Data for Isle aux Morts, Newfoundland Environment Canada 1981-2010 Data. 

 
The extreme winter minimum is -24°C, recorded in February. Average yearly precipitation totals 
1,653.1 mm, which includes 325.8 cm of snowfall. Very high winds with gusts >100 km/h can 
occur, often from southerly and southeasterly directions. Temperature and precipitation 
averages for Isle aux Morts are shown below in Figure 5-6. 

Weather and site conditions during the spring break-up period (typically April to late May) can 
prevent some exploration activities from being carried out due to high water levels and remnant 
snow cover. Scheduling of field activities to avoid this period is generally advisable. Winter 
programs can be carried out with snowmobiles, with consideration given to snowfall and cold 
temperature conditions, as well as potentially high wind conditions with reduced visibility that 
generally accompany storm events. Coastal waters south of the Cape Ray Property are free of 
Arctic pack ice and are navigable all year around.

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Minimal infrastructure currently exists on the Cape Ray Property and evidence of previous 
exploration work including drilling, trenching, and bulk sampling are present. No electrical or 
telephone line infrastructure extends to the Cape Ray Property and the nearest electrical high 
voltage substation is located approximately 25 km to the southwest in the community of 
Channel-Port aux Basques. Portable camp facilities on the Cape Ray Property require the use of 
diesel or gas generators, and regular fuel and supply runs can be completed using the road 
access. 

All areas presented in this economic assessment presented in this report occur on crown lands 
owned by the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Under terms of an agreement with the 
provincial government in the 1970's and 1980's, previous workers established access to adjacent 
crown lands in order to conduct scoping level underground metallurgical sampling and test work 
on the 04, 41, and 51 Zone deposits. The development of any future mining operations in this 
area must follow permitting requirements, and it is reasonable to assume that enhanced 
restrictions with respect to watershed issues would be encountered. 

The deposit area is non-populated at present and surrounded by an abundance of barren land 
that would favorably contribute to mine development. There are a few seasonal cottages within 
the claim boundary (Figure 5-7). Access to government lands for the purpose of future mine 
development can be reasonably anticipated and would require negotiation of surface rights and 
other issues with the Newfoundland government. At the present time Benton Resources Inc. 
does not hold any mining leases within the project area. 

Access to the provincial electrical transmission grid is available along the Trans-Canada Highway 
near Port aux Basques (25 km southwest and west of the site). Lower voltage distribution power 
lines run along the north side of Route 470 to the town of Isle Aux Morts and the installation of a 
three-phase 66kV electrical transformer station at a transmission line tap location along with a 
medium voltage overhead power line to the site may be necessary for the milling operations.

Figure 5-7 Proximity of Cottages in the Claim Area 

The abundance of surface water resources from lakes on the Cape Ray Property is a positive 
factor for future development, as is the presence of deep water wharf facilities and commercial 
shipping infrastructure at nearby Port aux Basques (<50 km driving distance). 

The current access road will require upgrades to simplify logistics to ready the property for 
production and to supply year round access. The road would also need to be extended to 
connect outlier deposits that are deemed economically viable for production. 

5.4 Physiography  

The Cape Ray Property is situated on an upland glaciated plateau with gentle to moderate relief 
and elevations typically ranging from 300 to 350 metres above sea level. Occasional ridges and 
peaks reach 450 metres above sea level. Rivers have cut deeply into the plateau forming steep, 
wooded valleys with an average elevation of 200 metres above sea level in the valley bottoms. 
The Cape Ray Property is characterized by boulder-strewn barren lichens and peat bogs 
interspersed with scattered crops of stunted spruce and fir, locally called tuckamore. These 
stunted spruce and fir forests also occur along the upper regions of river valleys, but grade into 
more open evergreen forest in the lower portion of the valleys.

Cape Ray Technical Report February 08, 2017 
 

The south-flowing Isle aux Morts, Grandy's, and La Poile river systems represent three major 
drainage systems that have formed the deeply incised river valleys in the upland barrens. The 
major drainage systems are fed by streams that drain into sparsely distributed, generally shallow 
lakes. Due to the sparse vegetation in the higher barren regions and normally saturated 
condition of the ground, surface run-off can produce abrupt changes in water levels in local 
streams and rivers.  

The Cape Ray Fault Zone appears as a prominent V-shape valley (gulch) trending northeast 
across the area. South of the fault, valleys and ridges are often structurally controlled and 
generally trend northeast to southwest. The Cape Ray Property has been extensively glaciated 
and visible outcrops are minimal in areas of abundant glacial till and outwash. Depths to bedrock 
on the Cape Ray Property are typically only 6 to 10 metres with generally minimal overburden 
present (glacial deposits).

6. History 

The Cape Ray property has been explored studied and has been the subject of academic and 
geological papers since the early 1970s. This section provides a brief history of past exploration 
on the property and is largely summarized by Ténière and Hilchey (2012) who produced an NI 
43-101 technical report on the Cape Ray Au-Ag Property in the Isle aux Morts Area.  

Note that the historical data is directly quoted from previous reports and portions of the data 
are in the imperial system due to the time of publication. For future sections of this report, all 
numbers for this project will be reported in the metric system. 

6.1 Academic and Government Studies (Ténière & Hilchey, 2012) 

Beginning in the early 1970's, the Geological Survey of Canada flew an aeromagnetic survey over 
the Cape Ray Property area, and Gillis (1972) published results of regional geological mapping 
covering the Port aux Basques map sheet (NTS 11O). Gillis defined the Cape Ray Fault Zone 
(CRFZ) as a prominent lineament that separated Precambrian to Ordovician mixed plutonic, 
meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary rocks in the northwest from Silurian to Ordovician quartzo-
feldspathic gneiss and schist in the southeast. 

Brown (1972, 1974, 1976 and 1977) conducted 1:50,000 scale geological mapping over the Port 
aux Basques map sheet as part of M.Sc. and Ph.D. thesis projects, as well as for the 
Newfoundland and Labrador Geological Survey. He identified the metamorphic and structural 
complexities of the area adjacent to the Cape Ray Fault as well as the structural history of the 
Port aux Basques Gneiss Complex, the Cape Ray Plutonic Complex and the younger Windsor 
Point Group and their relationships with the Cape Ray Fault.  

Between 1979 and 1980, while working for Riocanex, D.H.C. Wilton mapped the CRFZ from the 
area of the Cape Ray Gold Deposit (CRGD) to the coast. This work formed the basis of a Ph.D. 
thesis (Wilton, 1983a). Wilton (1983b, 1984 and 1985) and Wilton and Strong (1986) published 
several technical papers based on these studies. 

Chorlton (1980, 1983 and 1984) and Chorlton and Dingwell (1981) also carried out geological 
mapping over part of the CRFZ. This work was conducted for the Newfoundland Department of 
Mines and Energy and also as part of a Ph.D. thesis. Chorlton and Dallmeyer (1986) carried out 
geochronological studies in the area. 

Lake-bottom sediments collected during the late 1970's by the Newfoundland Department of 
Mines and Energy were analyzed for gold and related elements, the results of which, including 
those for the Cape Ray Gold Project area were published in Butler and Davenport (1980) and 
Davenport and Nolan (1987). 

Metallogenic studies of the granitoids in the Cape Ray area were reported in Tuach (1986) and 
Tuach et al. (1988).

The Crown holds all surface rights in the Cape Ray Project area. None of the property or adjacent 
areas is encumbered in any way. The area is not in an environmentally or archeologically 
sensitive zone and there are no aboriginal land claims or entitlements in this region of the 
province. There has been no commercial production from the property as of the time of this 
report. 

Previous resource estimates for 04, 41 and 51 deposits were reported prior to the creation of NI 
43-101 and are therefore non-compliant; this information has been left out of this report due to 
the age of the data without validation. Recent resource estimates commissioned by Cornerstone 
Capital Resources (2012) and Benton Resources/Nordmin Engineering (2015) are listed below in 
Table 6-2 and Table 6-3, respectively. Both estimates are now considered outdated due to the 
additional drilling and geological modeling described in this technical report.

Cape Ray Technical Report February 08, 2017 
 

7. Geological Settings and Mineralisation 

 The Cape Ray property has been explored, studied and the subject of academic and geological 
papers since the early 1970s. This section provides a description of the geology and 
mineralisation of the southwestern Newfoundland area of interest. This was well summarized by 
Ténière and Hilchey (2012) who produced an NI 43-101 technical report on the Cape Ray Au-Ag 
Property in the Isle aux Morts Area and has been directly extracted from their report.  

7.1 Regional Geology and Tectonic Setting 

Southwestern Newfoundland is an area of complex Appalachian geology recording intense 
crustal shortening, variable metamorphism, and magmatism beginning in the Late Silurian, which 
is related to collision of the composite North American continent to the north and the Gander-
Avalon composite terrane of Gondwanan affinity to the south (Dunning et al. 1990). 

The Cape Ray Fault Zone (CRFZ) forms a structural boundary between two of four 
tectonostratigraphic zones, or terranes that define the geology of Newfoundland (Figure 7-1), 
these being the Dunnage Zone to the northwest and the Gander Zone to the southeast 
(Williams, 1979). The Dunnage Zone includes rocks originally deposited in the Late Precambrian 
– Early Paleozoic Iapetus Ocean, and in southwestern Newfoundland is represented by the Cape 
Ray Igneous Complex (CRIC) (Williams, 1979; Dubé & Lauzière, 1997). The Gander Zone is mainly 
comprised of deep water turbidite sedimentary rocks deposited at, or near the eastern side of 
the Iapetus Ocean. In southwestern Newfoundland these are represented by the Port aux 
Basques Gneiss (PABG) (Williams, 1979; Dubé & Lauzière, 1997). The CRFZ is therefore located 
at, or very close to the boundary between the Laurentian and Gondwanan terranes (Dubé et al. 
1996). The CRFZ hosts the Cape Ray Gold Deposits (CRGD), which comprise one of the most 
important groups of vein-type gold deposits in the Appalachians, as well as other significant vein-
type gold occurrences that include the Big Pond and, Isle aux Morts prospects, and the 
Windowglass Hill Deposit (WGHD). 

The CRFZ is a zone of highly strained rocks approximately 100 km in length and several hundred 
m in width that includes three major geological domains (Figure 7-2): (1) the CRIC, (2) the 
Windsor Point Group (WPG), and (3) the PABG. The CRFZ separates the CRIC to the northwest 
from the PABG to the southeast (Dubé & Lauzière, 1996a) and WPG rocks, located between 
these two units, which coincide approximately with the trace of the CRFZ. All three units are 
intruded by a number of pre- to late-tectonic granitoid intrusions. 

The CRIC is comprised mainly of large bodies of mafic to ultramafic intrusive rocks intruded by 
granitoid rocks (Cape Ray Granite, Cape Ray Tonalite, Red Rocks Granite), and is interpreted to 
have a U-Pb zircon age of 469 ± 2Ma (Mid-Ordovician) based on samples obtained from the Cape 
Ray Tonalite (Dubé et. al., 1996). The WPG unconformably overlies the CRIC and consists of 
bimodal volcanics and volcaniclastics with associated sedimentary rocks that are interpreted to 
be Ordovician to Devonian in age based on U-Pb radiometric dating (Dubé et. al., 1996).

The PABG consists of high grade, kyanite-sillimanite-garnet, quartzo-feldspathic pelitic and 
granitic rocks intercalated with hornblende schists or amphibolites. The PABG is subdivided into 
three distinct lithological units: (1) the Grand Bay Complex (GBC); (2) the Port aux Basques 
Complex (PABC); and (3) the Harbour Le Cou Group. These units are intruded by large volumes of 
basic sheets and coeval Middle Ordovician granitoids, as represented by the Margaree and Kelby 
Cove orthogneiss bodies. The Grand Bay and Port aux Basques complexes are juxtaposed by the 
Late Silurian Isle aux Morts Fault Zone against the Harbour Le Cou Group rocks to the east, which 
dominantly consist of sillimanite and garnet-bearing, pyritiferous metasediments with 
amphibolitic intrusions and meta-pillow basalts in lower stratigraphic units (Schofield et al., 
1998).  

The CRFZ is well exposed along the south western coast of Newfoundland near the town of 
Channel-Port aux Basques (Dubé & Lauzière, 1996a). In this location, the Grand Bay Complex 
contains strongly foliated biotite and hornblende-rich psammites. Further inland to the 
northeast, it also includes garnet-rich metapelites and mylonitic felsic orthogneisses. Northeast 
of the GBC there is a wide mylonitic zone that separates WPG volcanic conglomerates from the 
biotite-hornblende psammites. These mylonites are characterized by a strong planar fabric and 
by mm-scale compositional layering defined by alternating silica-rich layers and sericite to 
chlorite-rich layers. The protolith of the mylonites is difficult to determine. However, the gradual 
transition between the conglomerates and the mylonites, and the local preservation of granitoid 
clasts within the mylonite zone along its northwest margin indicate that the mylonite zone is at 
least partly derived from the tonalite pebble conglomerate of the WPG. Metamorphic minerals 
present in the mylonitic foliation are typical of greenschist facies conditions and vary from 
biotite along the southeast margin of the mylonite zone, near the biotite and hornblende-rich 
rocks of the GBC, to dominantly chlorite ± sericite along the northwest margin (Dubé & Lauzière, 
1996a). 

Northwest of the mylonite zone, a central sedimentary domain and a northern volcanic domain 
of the WPG are present. The former consists of folded and transposed conglomerate 
interbedded with tuff, pebbly sandstone, black shale, greywacke, and siltstone. The volcanic 
domain is approximately 700 m thick and dominated by mafic volcanic rocks, including flows and 
gabbroic sills (Dubé et al. 1992). Felsic volcanic rocks occur mainly near the contact with the CRIC 
and include ignimbrites, rhyolitic flows, and associated pyroclastic and volcaniclastic – epiclastic 
rocks. Units of pillowed basalt are locally intercalated with the felsic volcanic rocks. A narrow 
sedimentary unit consisting of polymictic conglomerate, greywacke, limestone, and graphitic 
shale occurs between the felsic and mafic volcanic domains. The WPG is crosscut by the 
pretectonic and subvolcanic Late Silurian Windowglass Hill Granite dated at 424 ± 2Ma (Dubé et 
al. 1993, 1996) (Figure 7-2). All lithologies are cut by the late-tectonic Mid-Devonian Strawberry 
Hill (384 ± 2Ma) and Isle aux Morts (386 ± 3Ma) granites, composed of red coarse grained to 
porphyritic granite (Dubé et al., 1993, 1996). 

The northwestern side of the coastal section is a quartz-bearing tonalite and/or a megacrystic 
granitic phase of the CRIC. The CRIC - WPG contact represents a deformed unconformity (Dubé 
et al. 1992, 1996).

7.2 Structural Geology of the CRFZ 

7.2.1 Introduction 

The CRFZ is a major reverse-oblique fault zone that was active between Silurian and late 
Devonian time. Activity is largely attributed to major oblique collision between the composite 
Gondwanan and Laurentian terranes (Dubé & Lauzière, 1996a). Dubé and Lauzière (1997) 
describe the following structures that define six major deformation events (D1 to D6). 

7.2.1.1 D1 - D2 Event  

The first two generations (D1 and D2), correspond to amphibolite facies metamorphism and 
deformation and are restricted to the gneissic rocks of the PABG. The main fabric recognized in 
rocks of the PABG is a composite S1 – S2 gneissic layering. Peak metamorphic conditions were 
reached during the D2 event. An amphibolite-grade mylonite zone in rocks of the GBC is exposed 
along the coast near the WPG/GBC contact. It is characterized by a strong northeast oriented 
fabric (S2) and contains moderate to steep S-plunging mineral lineation (L2). Kinematic structural 
indicators point to reverse sinistral movement that occurred prior to 406 ± 4 Ma and 403 ± 4 Ma 
(Dubé et al., 1996). 

7.2.1.2 D3 Event  

D3 structures within the CRFZ affect WPG and GBC rocks and, to a lesser extent, CRIC intrusive 
rocks. The D3 increment of deformation occurred under greenschist-facies metamorphic 
conditions that resulted in prograde metamorphism in WPG rocks plus retrogression and 
overprinting of the amphibolite-grade mylonites and gneisses of the GBC. Two sets of structures 
are grouped under D3 and are interpreted to be related to a single progressive deformational 
event because of their similarity in deformation style, metamorphic conditions and orientation 
of structures (Dubé et al., 1996).

Moderate-strain characterizes most of the WPG, although there is a northwest directional 
decrease in D3 deformation away from the WPG - GBC contact, where bedding and a transposed 
S3a foliation are folded by a secondary S3b foliation. In most of the area, S3b is a penetrative fabric, 
axial planar to asymmetric F3b folds. Commonly, S3a is transposed into the S3b fabric, producing a 
complex composite S3a-b foliation. S3 folding is also present in the PABG, where it produces 
complex interference patterns defined by the gneissosity. S3a and S3b commonly strike northeast 
to north-northeast and dip moderately southeast to steeply northwest. L3b lineations plunge 
moderately east to east-southeast, although south-plunging stretching lineations were locally 
observed. Generally, F3 hinges are sub-parallel to the stretching lineation and plunge steeply to 
moderately east-southeast. Increasing deformation during D3 generated narrow to wide zones of 
high strain. These zones are well developed at the CRIC contact, but more intense at the PABG 
contact, where the zone varies in orientation from northeast-southwest to east-northeast in the 
flexure area of the fault zone (Dubé et al., 1996).  

The D3 mylonite zone is made up of quartzo-feldspathic mylonites and schists produced either 
by extensive retrogression of the PABG, by shearing of the WPG rocks, or by shearing of the Rose 
Blanche Granite in the flexure area. Within the mylonites, the dominant fabric is a Stectonite 
characterized by a mylonitic fabric (S3b), which is probably a composite S3a-b foliation and/or a 
compositional layering sub-parallel to the shear zone. In the northeast-oriented segment of the 
fault, the mylonitic fabric contains a steeply to moderately east-plunging stretching lineation (L3) 
and reverse-dextral kinematic structural indicators. In the east-west oriented segment of the 
fault, the S3 fabric contains a moderate southwest-plunging to sub-horizontal stretching 
lineation, and dextral strike-slip to oblique-slip motion is indicated by a number of kinematic 
structural indicators. This segment of the fault is interpreted as a tear fault accommodating 
differential shortening rates on either side. The upper time limit of the reverse shearing event is 
constrained by the intrusion of the Early Devonian Isle aux Morts Granite (384 ± 2 Ma) that cuts 
across the reverse-oblique shear (Dubé et al., 1996). 

7.2.1.3 D4 Event  

Another greenschist facies mylonitic zone (D4) is developed at/or near the WPG/CRIC boundary 
in the Isle aux Morts River area. This zone can be traced for up to a few tens of metres northeast 
of the Isle aux Morts River where it is in part cut by the Strawberry Granite. This mylonite 
gradually thins west of Big Pond and persists as a high strain zone a few metres wide for up to 
3km west of Dog Pond. It is characterized by a steeply dipping east-northeast foliation (S4) and 
compositional layering, and shallowly-plunging to sub-horizontal stretching lineations (L4). 
Kinematic structural indicators suggest both dextral and sinistral apparent motions. 

7.2.1.4 D5 Event  

During the D5 event, two sets of late axial-planar cleavages (S5) and associated local folds and 
kinks (F5) developed at moderate to high angles to the main S3 fabric along the CRFZ. These 
developed in all the structural domains and are post-mylonitic.

7.2.1.5 D6 Event  

Late brittle faulting (D6) is indicated by the presence of tectonic and hydrothermal breccias along 
the mylonite zone in the Isle aux Morts River area that also cut the Mid-Devonian Strawberry Hill 
Granite. 

7.3 Geology of the Cape Ray Gold Deposits 

The Cape Ray Gold Deposits (CRGD) consist of three main mineralised zones: the 04, 41 and 51 
Zones. These have historically been referred to as the "Main Zone". They occur as quartz veins 
and vein arrays along a 1.8 km segment of the CRFZ at or near the tectonic boundary between 
the WPG and the PABG (Dubé & Lauzière, 1997). Gold bearing quartz veins at the three locations 
are collectively known as the "A vein", and are typically located at (41 and 51 Zones) or near (04 
Zone) the southeast limit of a sequence of highly deformed and brecciated graphitic schist of the 
WPG. The graphitic schists host the mineralisation and form the footwall of the CRFZ. Graphitic 
schist is in fault contact with highly strained chloritic schists and quartz-sericite mylonites farther 
up in the hanging wall structural succession. The protolith of these mylonites is difficult to 
ascertain, but they appear to be partly or totally retrograded PABG lithologies. Other veins (C 
vein) are present in the structural footwall and represent secondary lodes hosted by more 
competent lithologies (Dubé & Lauzière, 1997). The mylonite zone in the hanging wall of the A 
vein is mainly composed of strongly sheared quartz-feldspar porphyries, quartzo-feldspathic 
gneisses and banded sediments, all of which are partly to completely retrograded to greenschist 
facies. 

The contact between the mylonite zone and the graphitic schist is a zone of strong hydrothermal 
alteration attributed to emplacement of the mineralised quartz veins (Dubé & Lauzière, 1997). In 
the 41 and 51 Zones, this is commonly represented by a 10-25 m thick chlorite-biotite- 
magnetite schist unit. A 5-12 m thick chlorite-calcite schist frequently exists immediately 
adjacent to the mineralised A vein in the hanging wall. The chlorite-calcite schist is much wider 
(up to 47 m) in the 04 Zone and the chlorite-biotite-magnetite schist zone is not as well defined. 
Graphitic schist units intercalated with chloritic schists are present up to 30-40 m into the 
hanging wall above the A vein interval and indicate additional structural complexity. 

In the CRGD area, a continuous sequence of banded, highly contorted, folded and locally 
brecciated graphitic schist with intercalations of chloritic and sericite-carbonate schists and 
banded mylonites constitutes the footwall and host of the mineralised A vein. The banded 
mylonites are characterized by cm-wide siderite-muscovite-quartz-rich bands within graphitic 
chlorite-quartz-muscovite schist. The mylonites are commonly spatially associated with local Au-
mineralised quartz veins, vein breccias (C vein) and stringer zones. Chloritic and carbonatized 
sheared mafic rocks and carbonatized pale green metasedimentary rocks are also present. 
Locally, less altered sections within the chloritic schist of the 41 Zone suggest that the protoliths 
in at least part of these schists are sills and dykes of the Windowglass Hill Granite (Dubé & 
Lauzière, 1997). Graphitic gouge zones up to 6 m wide that host the A vein contain cm-wide 
fragments of wall rock, quartz veins and sulphides in a fine-grained matrix and locally show high-
grade values of Au, Ag, Pb and Zn.

The graphitic schist unit becomes strongly to moderately contorted and banded farther into the 
footwall of the fault zone, but cm- to m-wide graphitic and/or chloritic gouge is still common. 
The graphitic schist unit contains up to 60% quartz or quartz-carbonate veins. At least three 
mineralised quartz breccias veins or stockwork zones are present in the footwall of the 41 Zone 
and these are termed the C vein. The thickness of the graphitic-rich sequence ranges from 20-
70m but averages 50-60 m in the CRGD area (Dubé & Lauzière, 1997). 

7.4 Geology of the Windowglass Hill Deposit 

Mineralisation in the WGHD occurs predominantly in a set of flat-lying sulphide-rich quartz veins 
hosted in the relatively un-deformed Windowglass Hill Granite near the CRFZ. The Windowglass 
Hill Granite is well exposed on the southwest side of the Isle aux Morts River and intrudes WPG 
rocks (Figure 7-3, Figure 7-4 and Figure 7-5). The intrusion is elongate in shape, measuring 2.7 x 
0.6 km on the western side of the Isle aux Morts River and 100 m wide x 3.4 km long on the 
eastern side, where it is cut by a strike-slip mylonite zone. The Windowglass Hill Granite is 
composed of pink, aphanitic alkali feldspar granite, with minor plagioclase phenocrysts and <2% 
biotite (Dubé & Lauzière, 1997). 

Deformation in the Windowglass Hill Granite is generally weak, but can be heterogeneous. Strain 
is most intense in centimetre to metre wide zones of shearing that separate relatively un-
deformed domains characterized by jointing and locally by northeast- to north-northeast-
trending fracture cleavage. The high strain zones are best developed at the Windowglass Hill 
Granite-WPG contact in the schists.

7.5 Mineralisation 

7.5.1 Cape Ray Gold Deposit 

The CRGD consists of electrum-sulphide mineralisation that occurs in boudinaged quartz veins 
within an auxiliary shear zone (the "Main Shear") of the CRFZ. The boudinaged veins and 
associated mineralisation are hosted by chlorite-sericite and interlayered graphitic schists of the 
WPG (Table 7-1), with sulphides and associated electrum occurring as stringers, disseminations 
and locally discrete massive layers within the quartz bodies.

The 04, 41 and 51 Zones occur along a northeast-trending fault within the CRFZ system, which 
dips moderately (50-60°) to the southeast. These zones consist of complex tabular zones of 
quartz veins, fault gouge and wall rock fragments, range from several cm to a few m in width, 
and correlate laterally for up to 700 m along strike. In section, the 04 and 41 Zones show east- 
southeast to southeast plunges and locally show down-dip extension of up to 300 m (Dubé & 
Lauzière, 1997). The 51 Zone is not as consistently defined but both sub-horizontal and steeply 
plunging grade trends are present. 

Within the CRGD, the A vein typically consists of milky white breccia veins with various 
proportions of angular clasts of wall rock (chlorite and graphitic schist) set in a matrix of quartz, 
and containing up to 40% sulphides (averaging 5-10%). The vein is typically up to 2 m wide with

local wider pods. Fault gouge commonly borders mineralised veins and is superimposed on 
already highly strained rocks. The nature of the host rocks and superimposed deformation make 
this mineralised zone complex and variable in terms of vein continuity, width and grade.  

Underground investigations by Dolphin (Arnold, 1988) within the 41 Zone noted that the A vein 
pinches and swells, and commonly branches out into smaller discrete veins or lenses. Similar 
observations were made by Wilton and Strong (1986) in a trench that exposed the A vein within 
the 51 Zone for over 61 m. They observed numerous quartz veins (up to 2.4 m thick and 21 m 
long) sub-parallel to the main fabric that show well developed pinch and swell structures. Wilton 
and Strong (1986) suggested that the podiform nature of the veins resulted from boudinage of a 
formally more continuous quartz vein. Outside of the main mineralised zone (30-50 m laterally), 
the A vein structure consists of either uneconomic quartz veining or fault gouge with little to no 
veining with traces of disseminated pyrite. Brittle deformation is superimposed on the veins as 
cataclastic features.  

The C vein is typically located up to 30 m down-dip on the footwall of the A vein and is generally 
less deformed. Historical drill hole data indicate that the C vein is up to 15 m thick, and gold 
values are not as consistent or as high grade as those within the A vein (Dubé & Lauzière, 1997). 
Underground investigations of the 41 Zone showed the C vein to consist of a series of fault-fill 
mineralised quartz breccia intervals measuring up to 1.5 m in thickness. The transition between 
mineralised and barren quartz breccia veins is locally gradual, with the barren veins located in 
the central part of the mineralised quartz breccia. Fragments within the quartz breccia veins are 
typically angular and composed of graphitic schist and sericite-chlorite schist set in a matrix of 
hydrothermal quartz. 

In the 51 Zone, the mineralised quartz is at the top of the graphitic schist unit within a gouge 
zone. The A vein is broken up into large lenses and breccia fragments of varying size. The 
graphitic schist in this zone varies from less than 15 m thick in the west to nearly 61 m thick in 
the east. Locally mineralised quartz veins and/or quartz stockwork intervals are found within the 
footwall schists. High grade mineralisation of good continuity is commonly restricted to the top 
of the graphitic unit (Ford, 1985). 

Minerals of economic interest in the CRGD consist of varying amounts of galena, chalcopyrite, 
sphalerite and pyrite with associated electrum and free gold (Table 7-1). Pyrrhotite occurs as 
minor inclusions in other sulphide grains and the primary iron oxide is magnetite, mainly found 
in wall rock fragments rather than veins. In places, deformation has recrystallized galena and 
chalcopyrite, shattered the pyrite and removed sphalerite. All sulphides contain complex 
intergrowths of euhedral pyrite crystals, and sphalerite typically contains rounded chalcopyrite 
inclusions. Electrum occurs as minute grains generally less than 0.02 mm in size, but up to 0.8 
mm and dominantly inter-grown with pyrite, and to a lesser extent with chalcopyrite, galena and 
sphalerite or some combination of these sulphides. Electrum also occurs as solitary grains within 
the quartz veins in regions of high sulphide concentrations. Paragenetic features indicate that 
pyrite formed first followed by simultaneous deposition of the other sulphide minerals (Wilton, 
1983).

Electron microprobe analyses indicate an average FeS content of 5.14% in the sphalerite. 
Electrum contains 15-64 mole% Ag and Au:Ag ratios range from 0.55 to 5.83 in contrast to 0.61 
to 0.76 for the WGHD (Wilton, 1983). Electrum grains with the highest Au:Ag ratios are generally 
isolated and not in contact with the sulphides. According to Wilton (1983), wall rocks to the 
electrum-bearing quartz veins experienced potassic alteration with light rare earth element 
depletion and minor elevation in chalcophile element concentrations. On the basis of sulphide 
mineral intergrowth, Wilton (1983) also estimated approximately 300°C to be the temperature 
of vein formation and concluded that sulphur isotope ratios indicate that sulphides are of 
magmatic origin and that Pb isotope ratios in galena have an oceanic crust/mantle isotopic 
signature. Based on field observations and detailed geochemical analyses, he also concluded that 
the electrum sulphide-bearing quartz veins were deposited by hydrothermal fluids evolved as a 
vapour phase from the Windowglass Hill Granite.. 

7.5.2 Windowglass Hill Deposit 

Two sets of sulphide-bearing quartz veins at the WGHD cut the Windowglass Hill Granite, with 
the first set hosting the majority of the Au, Ag, Pb and Zn mineralisation. The mm- to cm-wide 
veins strike generally north-south, generally dip moderately (25°) to the west, parallel to a joint 
set in the granite, and are spaced from 1 cm to several tens of cm apart. The veins commonly 
show open space-filling textures, with idiomorphic quartz crystals developed sub parallel to a 
down-dip stretching lineation. Dubé and Lauzière (1997) concluded that vein development 
occurred during the D3 deformation event (see previous Table 7-1). 

Pinching and swelling of the veins are common and the best sulphide mineralisation occurs in 
zones of maximum swell. Subhedral cubes of pyrite and coarse-grained galena, and anhedral 
masses of galena, chalcopyrite and rare sphalerite make up the sulphide component of the 
quartz veins. Within these veins, sulphide associations with elevated gold concentrations are as 
follows: (1) galena rich with pyrite and minor chalcopyrite; and (2) chalcopyrite-pyrite rich with 
minor galena. Haloes of 2-3% disseminated pyrite are present in the host granite, with best gold 
and sulphide mineralisation occurring in veins with the largest pyrite haloes (Wilton, 1983). 

The second set of veins strike northeast and dip steeply southeast at approximately 80°, parallel 
to the main D1 fabric developed in schists surrounding the granites. These veins post-date those 
of the first set and are mineralised only where they intersect mineralised veins of the first set. 
Some mineralisation occurs in narrow linear zones that plunge at shallow angles to the southeast 
and correspond to lines of intersection between the two vein sets (Wilton, 1983).  

Alteration haloes are best developed around the more extensively mineralised veins and intense 
alteration only occurs in very close proximity to the veins. The proximal alteration zone is 
defined by disseminated pyrite and moderate to intense sericitization of feldspar that gives a 
green colour and bleached aspect to the granitic rock. Sericite alteration occurs in both perthite 
and plagioclase crystals. Sericite associated with the mineralisation is generally coarser grained 
than the fine sericite attributed to regional metamorphism. Chloritization of feldspars is localized 
and appears to be associated with magnetite-bearing veins. Although alteration is present in 
close proximity to mineralised veins, deformation is limited and igneous textures are commonly 
preserved (Dubé & Lauzière, 1997).

7.5.3 Timing of Mineralisation 

According to Dubé and Lauzière (1997), the main Au-Ag mineralisation is post 424 ± 2 Ma, the 
age of the Windowglass Hill Granite that is cut by mineralised veins, post-peak metamorphism in 
the PABG (415 Ma), and post 407 ± 4 Ma, the cooling age of the hornblende as both the gneisses 
and the hornblende are retrograded at greenschist facies within the CRFZ structure hosting the 
gold deposits (see previous Table 7-1). The mineralisation also pre-dates the 386 ± 2 Ma Isle aux 
Morts Granite that cuts the Main Zone shear of the CRFZ. This time period appears to 
correspond to the development of D3 ductile structures, an interpretation that is also 
compatible with the structural setting of the mineralisation at the WGHD. Highly strained wall 
rock fragments enclosed within a mineralised quartz breccia vein in the CRFZ indicates that the 
mineralizing event is syn- to late-D3 ductile deformation (Dubé & Lauzière, 1997).

8. Deposit Types 

Descriptions within this section are taken directly from Ténière and Hilchey (2012).  Extensive 
work by Dubé and Lauzière (1997) in the CRGD area includes a detailed discussion of the deposit 
style and possible analogies to Archean and younger gold deposits around the world. The 
following section summarizes the findings of Dubé and Lauzière (1997) and the reader is referred 
to this extensive work for greater detail.  

8.1 Style of Mineralisation 

The style of lode gold mineralisation in the CRGD has a number of characteristics in common 
with mesothermal gold deposits. The relationship of the different mineral zones with a major 
ductile fault zone, the nature of quartz veins, grade of metamorphism, and alteration style are all 
generally compatible with classic mesothermal lode gold deposits (Roberts, 1987). In addition, 
the temperature of the mineralised zone formation, or equilibration, estimated from 
arsenopyrite and other sulphide intergrowths appears to be around 300°C (Wilton & Strong, 
1986) and is consistent with such an interpretation. However, the mineralogical assemblage 
within the mineralised zone, in particular the abundance of base metals, differs from typical 
mesothermal mineral assemblages, and the abundance of galena may suggest a lower 
temperature of formation. 

The relatively high concentration of silver seen in the CRGD is characteristic of gold deposits 
formed at shallower depths. Most mineralised zones at Cape Ray have elevated silver contents 
compared to gold (see Au:Ag ratios in Table 7-1), as is typically seen in epithermal deposits 
(Dubé & Lauzière, 1997). Otherwise, the Cape Ray mineralised zones show few of the critical 
geological characteristics of epithermal deposits such as characteristic alteration mineral 
assemblages, crustiform vein textures, and formation in an extensional (volcanic) tectonic 
environment. Their structural and lithological characteristics are more analogous with 
greenstone belt deposits (mesothermal), although the limited amount of hydrothermal 
carbonate in the veins or the wall rocks contrasts with typical mesothermal gold deposits. Based 
on the above, it appears that the auriferous zones in the CRGD were formed at depths 
intermediate between these two hydrothermal environments (2-5 km depth, 200-300°C) (Dubé 
and Lauzière, 1997). A similar conclusion was proposed by Peters et al. (1990) for mélange-
sediment hosted (slate to turbidite-hosted) gold deposits in the Hodgkinson goldfield in North 
Queensland, Australia. In that case, high silver content may reflect the dominantly sedimentary 
nature of the rocks through which the fluids circulated and Dubé and Lauzière (1997) interpret a 
similar situation for the CRGD. 

According to Dubé and Lauzière (1997), mineralisation at the WGHD is comparative to intrusion-
related Korean-type gold-silver deposits (1:2 to 2:1 Au:Ag ratios), and to more silver-rich 
epithermal deposits (1:10 to 1:200 Au:Ag ratios). The intensity and type of alteration, the 
banded structure of the veins, and some of the Au:Ag ratios are also similar to this type of 
deposit. Notable differences with the Korean-type deposits are the presence of abundant base 
metal sulphides and the more elevated silver content of some of the veins. Korean-type deposits 
are genetically associated with Early to Late Cretaceous granites and are characterized by a

general deficiency of sulphide minerals (formed at 270°C and 1.25 km depth). Silver-rich 
epithermal deposits associated with Late Cretaceous to Tertiary granites are characterized by 
different alteration (advanced argillic and silicification) and an extensional tectonic setting 
(deposition at <240°C at depth <0.75 km). 

8.2 Analogy with Archean and younger gold deposits 

Dubé and Lauzière (1997) note that the association of gold mineralisation with graphitic schists 
has been reported from Archean gold deposits such as the Hollinger and McIntyre mines in the 
Abitibi greenstone belt, where gold has precipitated at quartz vein margins injected within 
graphitic zones. They consider the CRGD to be potentially analogous with the Owl Creek deposit 
near Timmins, Ontario, where auriferous quartz veins are hosted by sheared graphitic schists 
that are interpreted as critical in the formation of the deposit. At Owl Creek gold occurs in 
epigenetic quartz veins and their pyritic wall rocks in two zones within a package of east striking, 
steeply north dipping, volcanic and sedimentary rocks. At the West Zone, 1.7 Mt of ore with a 
grade of 4.83 g/t Au (268,587 recovered ounces) were produced from an open pit centred on a 
wedge-shaped unit of basalt that occurs between two overturned, south facing units of 
greywacke and argillite (Coad et al., 2004). Basalt/greywacke contacts are locally marked by 
graphitic-carbonaceous argillite, strike-parallel faults and massive quartz veins, all of which are 
apparent in the Cape Ray area. 

The CRGD also have some similarities to deposits of the Ashanti gold district in western Ghana, 
where mineralisation occurs in a major shear zone in Early Proterozoic rocks interpreted as a 
thrust fault juxtaposing tightly folded and metamorphosed metasedimentary rocks and less 
deformed and metamorphosed metavolcanic rocks (Dubé & Lauzière, 1997). The gold 
mineralisation occurs in shear zones characteristically associated with carbonaceous schists, and 
most of the mineralisation is hosted by quartz veins that contain significant amounts of base 
metal mineralisation such as galena, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite. As with the CRGD, mineralised 
bodies pinch and swell along both strike and dip. Notably, the Ashanti mineralised shear zone 
intervals are more extensive, with lengths up to 7.5 km and depth extents of 1.6 km or more. A 
comparison in deposit style and mineralisation can also be made with Paleozoic and younger 
rocks hosting significant gold deposits in structurally complex terranes. Dubé and Lauzière (1997) 
identified a gold-graphite association in the Ballarat goldfield in Australia, where auriferous 
quartz lodes are mainly restricted to an Ordovician stratigraphic horizon rich in graphitic slates, 
in the Otago schist of New Zealand that hosts numerous gold bearing quartz vein deposits, and 
in the Hodgkinson goldfield in Australia where Silurian-Devonian metasediments and mélange, 
including carbonaceous shale, host vein associated Au. Multiple injections of quartz and multiple 
shear zone movements are commonly encountered in these settings and, similar to Cape Ray, 
the quartz veins pinch and swell or occur in pods mixed with gouge within the host shear zones. 
Gold mineralisation also accompanied brittle deformation and is interpreted as 
contemporaneous with regional plutonism.

8.3 Tectonic-metallogenic model for CRFZ 

Wilton (1983a) and Wilton and Strong (1986) proposed a genetic model in which the 
Windowglass Hill Granite exsolved a base and precious metal-rich vapour phase. The exsolution 
of this phase raised the internal pressure within the cooling magma and country rocks and 
hydraulically fractured brittle horizons such as the graphitic schists, which offered a structural, 
and possibly a geochemical trap for gold precipitation from the auriferous fluids slightly before 
the deformation stage. For reasons detailed below, gold and silver mineralisation of the WGHD is 
unlikely to be genetically related to its granitic host. Textural features of the Windowglass Hill 
Granite indicate that emplacement took place relatively high in the crust, in a subvolcanic 
environment, prior to deformation related to the major thrusting event along the CRFZ. The 
veins are perpendicular to a stretching lineation (L3) interpreted as being produced during 
thrusting (D3), which suggests that emplacement of veining and Au-Ag mineralisation is 
associated with that deformation. The Windowglass Hill Granite, acting as a rigid body, would 
have been a preferential site for fracturing and extension, while the surrounding WPG rocks 
underwent ductile deformation, accommodating most of the strain. These fractures could have 
been conduits for hydrothermal fluid circulation resulting in Au-Ag mineralisation within the 
CRFZ during the main episodes of ductile deformation or during later phases of deformation. 
Dubé and Lauzière (1997) had separately noted that the Au-Ag mineralizing event in the Cape 
Ray area is contemporaneous with development of the ductile fabric produced by motion along 
the CRFZ.

9. Exploration 

Historic exploration and efforts have been outlined in Section 6 History. This section specifically 
details the exploration efforts that Benton Resources Inc. has applied to the property. Details 
regarding Benton's drilling programs can be found in Section 10 Drilling. 

9.1 2013 Exploration Program 

From January 2013 to December 2013 Benton Resources Inc., completed an exploration program 
consisting of line-cutting, IP geophysical survey, prospecting/mapping, and geochemical rock/soil 
sampling. The line-cutting program totaled 65.4 line kilometres and the IP geophysical survey 
consisted of 18.1 line kilometres. The results of the 2013 IP survey are shown below in Figure 9-1 
and Figure 9-2. A total of 96 rock samples and 588 soil samples were collected on the licence. A 
mini bulk sample was collected from an old trench site which exposed the 51 zone.  

9.1.1 Prospecting/Mapping and Sampling Program 

Benton personnel carried out the geochemical sampling over several periods between January 
and December of 2013. Samples were taken and locations recorded with hand-held GPS units.  

A total of 96 rock samples (Figure 9-3) and 588 soil samples were collected within the licence 
17072M (Figure 9-4). All rock/soil samples were assayed for gold by fire-assay at Eastern 
Analytical Laboratory Ltd. in Springdale, Newfoundland and a 30 element ICP was completed on 
all samples.  

The majority of rock samples taken from the property were from the altered Windowglass Hill 
granite, quartz veins or quartz associated with granite, chloritic/graphitic schist and few from 
sediments. The selective grab samples ranged from trace up to 15-20% sulphides, mainly pyrite 
and galena with minor chalcopyrite, disseminated throughout the rock, but minor blebs of 
sulphide were noted. Results from the program returned highs of 69.7 g/t and 39.7 g/t gold from 
samples 118951 and 118761. Sample 118952 provided the highest silver value of 196.8 g/t. 
Generally, with the higher-grade gold samples, analysis for silver and copper were also elevated. 

An old trench (Harris 1980) which exposed the 51 zone was reopened by Benton in 2013 to 
collect a mini bulk sample. A total of 11 plastic pails were filled, each containing approximately 
20 kg of rock chips. The pails were shipped to Met-Solve Laboratories in Langley, BC and tested 
for dense media separation (DMS) and gravity.  

The soil sampling program was conducted on a cut grid at 60 and 120 metre line spacing and at 
25 metre spacing along the individual lines. The program was very successful in outlining 
prospective target areas for both gold and silver. A total of 31 samples returned gold values 
greater than or equal to 100 ppb Au, with a high of 801 ppb Au for sample 69993.

9.2 2014 Exploration Program 

From January, 2014 to November, 2014, Benton Resources Inc. (Benton) of Rosslyn, Ontario, 
Canada, completed a diamond drill program, a bulk sampling program, a line-cutting program, a 
prospecting/mapping program, and a geochemical rock and soil sampling program based on 
previous exploration results on the Cape Ray Property. The drilling is thoroughly discussed in 
Section 10. 

9.2.1 Bulk Sampling and Trenching Program 

Two bulk sampling programs and one trenching program were completed by Benton, all 
supervised by Steve House. One bulk sampling program was in October 2013 and samples were 
sent to Met-Solve Laboratories for metallurgical testing. The second bulk sampling program, in 
October 2014 included drilling two diamond drill holes and sampling the complete core from the 
holes. Trenching and blasting was also completed in 2014 by Manuals Construction from Port 
aux Basques, NL. The trench samples were collected for use in the metallurgical testing program 
that was completed by ALS Laboratories in Kamloops, BC. 

9.2.2 Line-cutting Program 

A line-cutting program was completed by S.C.I. Exploration Ltd. from Miles Cove, NL, both 
supervised by Dennis Rowsell (Figure 9-4). The program started and was completed in 
September 2014, and 36.6 line kilometres were completed on three licenses. License 17072M 
had 7.33 line kilometres cut, 1.28 line kilometres for license 21559M and 28 line kilometres for 
license 9939M. 

9.3 2015 Exploration Program 

In August 2015 Manuals Construction from Port aux Basques, NL was contracted to trench along 
the 51 and 41 zones. The exposed zones were washed and geological mapping conducted.  

The 51 zone was exposed for a strike length of approximately 200 meters and a total of 104 saw-
cut samples, ranging in length from 0.4 to 1.2 meters, were cut at intervals ranging from 7.5 to 
15 meters in 23 separate section lines within the exposed trench. 

The trenching efforts over the 41 zone consisted of two separate trenches over a strike length of 
approximately 125m, although flooding restricted exposure to about 85m. A total of 100 saw-cut 
samples, ranging in length were cut at intervals ranging from 3.0 to 16 meters in 15 separate 
section lines within the exposed trench. All saw cut samples were sent to Eastern Analytical Ltd. 
Springdale, NL for assay. A complete table of results for the trenching program is listed below. 

Individual gold and silver assays were cut to 40g/t and 80g/t respectively, prior to calculating 
weighted composites.

10. Drilling 

Drilling completed to date on the Cape Ray property is illustrated in Figure 10-1, a plan view that 
also shows the access road and the property outline. The first drill hole completed on the 
property was in 1977 by Riocanex. Between 1977 and 2014 there were 435 holes drilled totalling 
72,122.6 metres. In 2016, Nordmin completed an additional 5003.8 metres in 29 diamond drill 
holes. The total amount of drilling on the Cape Ray property now totals 77,126.4 metres in 464 
diamond drill holes. Table 10-1 summarizes the drilling done to date by company, while Table 
10-2 summarizes the drilling by deposit. Vertical sections through all four deposit areas can be 
found in the appendices.  

 
Figure 10-1 Plan of Diamond Drilling Completed to Date on the Cape Ray property 

Companies that have been involved in exploring the property, including conducting the various 
diamond drilling campaigns, have included Rio Tinto Canada Exploration (Riocanex), Mascot Gold 
Mines Ltd., Dolphin Exploration Ltd., Tenacity Gold Mining Company, Terra Nova Gold 
Corporation, Cornerstone Capital Resources Inc., and Benton Resources Inc. The 2016 drilling 
program was conducted by Nordmin Engineering under a joint venture agreement with Benton. 

Core sizes were either BQ (36.5 mm) or NQ (47.6 mm). All historical sampling prior to Benton 
(2014) was done using mechanical splitting. Benton (2014) and Nordmin (2016) drill core was 
sampled with a core saw.

Drill hole deviation measurements were carried out by all of the operators on the Cape Ray 
property. Riocanex initially used the Tropari system and later holes used down hole single shot 
or multi-shot systems such as Sperry Sun or Reflex. Higher, but systematic deviation rates 
characterise deeper BQ size holes completed by Riocanex, while NQ holes generally remained on 
their intended inclination and azimuth. Cornerstone data do not typically show problematic 
deviation issues, but relatively soft hangingwall lithologies such as graphitic schist present 
potential for higher deviation rates in deep holes cutting through the stratigraphy (Ténière & 
Hilchey, 2012). 

Evaluating available resources for precious metal deposits, especially gold, is hampered by a 
number of risks. These include: 

I. "High grade" actually being represented by minute quantities of a particular precious 
metal. 

II. The use of smaller diameter drill core make representative sampling of such minute 
quantities difficult, especially when only a half of the core is actually submitted for 
analysis. 

III. The use of manual splitting rather than the use of a diamond saw commonly results in 
biased sampling as more or less material than intended is included in the actual sample. 

IV. The reliance of using only a 30 gram sample is based on the assumption that the 
material being analysed has been thoroughly homogenised. Ductile metals, such as gold, 
typically fail to be homogenised and thus the 30 gram sample commonly can be biased 
high or low.

As precious metals are difficult even under the best of conditions to be seen by the naked eye 
and as they may or may not be associated with other minerals that are easily recognised it is 
imperative that sampling not be selective. All drill core should be sampled to ensure 
mineralisation is not missed.  

The historical drilling done on the Cape Ray suffers from all of the above, in particular, the non-
continuous sampling based solely on visual characterisation of the core. As a result, gold-bearing 
rock may not have been sampled. By necessity all non-sampled intervals in-between sampled 
intervals must be assigned a zero grade which can introduce a negative bias. 

All the 2016 drilling data processes along with data validation and compilation were assessed 
during the stay at the Cape Ray between September 24

th
 to October 20

th
 2016. 

The author is of the opinion that the sample preparation techniques, security and analytical 
procedures used were adequate. 

10.1 Rio Tinto Canada Exploration Ltd. ("Riocanex") 

It was Riocanex that first discovered the 04 zone in 1977 followed by 41 and 51 zones after 
major surface exploration and drilling programs. Riocanex understood that the Au mineralization 
and boudinaged veining might continue at depth and form high-grade mineralized shoots within 
Cape Ray Fault Zone. Riocanex completed 172 diamond drill holes for 24,054 metres and 
outlined the mineralization boundaries for the 51, 04 and 41 zones. Significant intercepts include 
23.7 g/t Au over 3.4m from hole PB79-107 (51 Zone), 24.8 g/t Au over 2.4m from PB77-008 (04 
Zone), and 17.9 g/t Au over 4.9m from PB78-048 and 25.7 g/t Au over 2.7m from PB78-067 (41 
Zone). 

Riocanex also completed a reconnaissance drilling campaign on the Windowglass Hill "WGH" 
deposit with the best intercept coming from hole PB78-073 which returned 13.7 g/t Au over 
2.9m. 

10.2 International Corona Resources Ltd and Dolphin Explorations Ltd. ("Corona Dolphin") 

From 1986 to 1989, Corona Dolphin completed 118 diamond drill holes for 23,310 metres 
focussing on the WGH Deposit. Significant drilling during this period in the area highlights include 
11.1 g/t Au and 17.2 g/t Ag over 3.2m in hole PB86-182 from the WGH deposit. Significant 
results were also reported from the 51 zone with hole PB88-315 returning 29.2 g/t Au over 2.6m 
and the 41 zone with hole PB88-249 returning 11.4 g/t Au over 19.2m. 

10.3 Royal Oak Mines Ltd. 

Drilling by Royal Oak in 1996 focused entirely on the 51 deposit to determine the resource 
potential and to confirm grade continuity up dip and near surface. Drilling highlights from that

10.4 Terra Nova Gold Corporation 

In 2003 Globenet underwent a name change to Terra Nova Gold Corporation and carried out a 
drill campaign with 9 holes totalling 1760.9m on the 04 deposit along with 6 holes totalling 
466.80m on Isle Aux Mort deposit and 16 holes totalling 1379.24m on Big Pond deposit. The Isle 
Aux Mort and Big Pond deposits are not a part of the Benton-Nordmin joint venture but are still 
controlled by Benton. The best holes from the 04 deposit included 21.7 g/t Au over 3.7m in hole 
CR03-01 and 33.1 g/t Au over 3.5m in hole CR03-03. 

In 2004 Terra Nova Gold Corporation carried out an exploration program which included 11 
holes totalling 2915m. The drilling program was focused in the 04 and 41 deposits testing for 
gold bearing mineralization down dip/plunge along a fold nose of the A-Vein (04 zone), and 
testing the strike extent of mineralization between the 04 and 41 deposits. Drilling highlights 
from that program include 10.1g/t Au over 7.93m in hole CR04-12, 32.4 g/t Au over 3.1m in hole 
CR04-14. 

10.5 Cornerstone 

Between 2004 and 2006, Cornerstone carried out two drilling programs in the 51 deposit and 
WGH deposit areas. These two programs consisted of 28 diamond drill holes totalling 2,520.13m. 
The diamond drilling programs confirmed the presence of the high-grade Au mineralization at 
the WGH deposit and corroborated the results of the historical drilling. The drilling programs 
also identified a new high grade Au zone east of the previous historical drilling, and verified the 
down-dip extension of high grade narrow quartz veins identified at surface within the Main and 
Camp zones (Figure 10-2). The most significant hole from the Cornerstone drilling was WGH04-
11 which returned 5.7 g/t Au over 5.2m.

10.6 Benton (2014) 

In 2014 Benton Resources Inc completed a drilling campaign focusing on extension of WGH 
deposit and 2 holes were drilled for metallurgical testing on the 04 deposit. Benton completed 
3051.6m of diamond drilling in 17 exploratory holes. While most drill holes were designed to test 
for new gold mineralization outside the known resources, two holes PB14-393 and PB14-394 
tested the continuity of gold mineralization between the 04 and 41 deposits. PB14-393 
intersected three mineralized graphitic faults with quartz vein material that graded 2.18 g/t Au 
over 1.0m from 131.2 to 132.2m, 12.42 g/t Au over 0.6m from 172.5 to 173.1m, and 1.24 g/t Au 
over 1.0m from 256.2 to 257.2m. Drill hole PB14-394 also intersected multiple mineralized 
structures that graded 2.07 g/t Au over 1.8m from 172.2 to 174.0m and 2.21 g/t Au over 0.5 m 
from 182.0 to 182.5m (all thicknesses are core length).(Figure 10-3)

Benton personnel Steve House, Steve Stares, Clint Barr, Paul Degagne, Nathan Sims, Calvin Keats 
and Todd Murray along with contractors Cabo Drilling Ltd. and West Bottom Drilling Ltd. carried 
out a diamond drill program over the period from June to October of 2014. A list of diamond drill 
holes and their locations which were completed in the 2014 drill campaign are shown below in 
Table 10-3.  

Cabo Drilling Ltd. (Cabo) of Springdale, NL, carried out the first phase of diamond drilling using a 
Nodwell-mounted Boyles B15 diamond drill rig equipped to drill NQ sized core from June to 
August 2014. Drill moves were made via the Nodwell-mounted diamond drill rig. West Bottom 
Drilling Inc. completed the second phase of diamond drilling using a skid-mounted Duralite 500 
diamond drill. Drill moves were completed using an excavator. Drill sites were spotted by Steve 
House, Clint Barr and Paul Degagne. Core was placed in wooden trays supplied by Cabo. Drill 
casings were left in the ground, capped and marked with wooden posts labelled with aluminum 
embossed tape. The collar coordinates were located with a Garmin GPSMAP78 unit by Steve 
House. Hole deviation was monitored with a Reflex instrument at nominal 60 metre intervals 
down the hole. All drill core was supervised/logged onsite by geologists, Steve House, Clint Barr, 
Paul Degagne and Nathan Sims. Assay samples were split using a rock saw by Cal Keats and Todd 
Murray, with half of the sample inserted in a plastic bag and securely sealed, and the other half 
returned to the core box. All core boxes were labelled with aluminum tags.

Samples were then sent to Eastern Analytical Laboratories Ltd. lab in Springdale, NL for sample 
analysis. All pulps were processed using Fire Assay for gold and an ICP analysis for another 34 
elements. After the completion of the program, the drill core was stacked and left onsite at the 
Cape Ray property exploration camp. 

A total of 1043 samples were submitted for analysis; 941 samples were of drill core, 51 were 
blanks (inserted by Benton personnel) and 51 were standards with a known Au content (inserted 
by Benton personnel) to ensure quality control. Of every 20 samples shipped to the assay lab 
there was one blank and one standard inserted as control. 

Drill data was entered into a MS Excel spreadsheet. Drill logs and sections were created using 
GeoticLog 6 and Downhole Explorer software, respectively.

10.6.1 WGH Extension (PW Zone) 

The PW Zone was defined based on a soil geochemical survey and prospecting followed by an IP 
geophysical survey. This zone is an extension of the Windowglass Hill Zone on the southwest side 
of the Isle aux Morts River, which is hosted in extensional, sub-horizontal quartz within the 
Windowglass Hill Granite.

Holes PB14-381, PB14-385 and PB14-387 to 388 were drilled to further define the PW Zone 
mineralisation. The best intercept was from hole PB14-387 with 0.5 m of 27.5 g/t Au and 80 g/t 
Ag. A wider mineralised interval grading 43.35m of 0.83 g/t Au and 4.0 g/t Ag was also 
intersected further up hole in PB14-387. 

Hole PB14-385 returned a high gold value of 25.4 g/t Au and 82.9 g/t Ag over 0.25 m within a 
wider interval grading 0.42 g/t Au and 2.0 g/t Ag over 78.5 m. 

10.6.2 Extension of the 51 Zone 

At the 51 Zone, gold occurs mainly in galena and chalcopyrite-rich, fault-fill quartz breccia veins 
hosted by graphitic schist of the Windsor Point Group. 

Drill holes PB14-378 to 380, PB14-382 to 384, PB14-386 and PB14-389 to 392 were drilled to 
determine the extension of the 51 zone based on a soil geochemical survey, prospecting and an 
IP geophysical survey. The best intercept was in hole PB14-383 with 0.6 m of 1.49 g/t Au and 0.2 
g/t Ag. The sample was taken from a quartz vein which was 9.4 m thick, containing 
approximately 50% quartz vein material and chlorite schist. It contained 1-2% pyrite as 
disseminations, blebs, fracture fill and rare fine cubes. Three other quartz veined zones and 2 
fault zones were also present in the hole, but did not return anomalous gold values. 

10.6.3 04 and 41 Zones  

At the 04 and 41 zones, mineralisation is mainly contained in boudined quartz veins within the 
graphitic and chloritic schists. Sulphides are mainly pyrite, chalcopyrite and galena. 

Drill holes PB14-393 and 394 were drilled in between the 04 and 41 zones to determine 
continuity for the zones. The best intercept in PB14-393 was 1.10 m of 6.89 g/t Au and 60.5 g/t 
Ag. The best intercept in PB14-394 was 1.80 m of 2.70 g /t Au and 2.45 g/t Ag. Holes M14-01 and 
M14-02 were drilled for metallurgical purposes and all core was sent in for metallurgical analysis. 
Initial analysis was completed on the mineralised zones of the metallurgical holes with a best 
intercept of 13.0 m of 13.4 g/t Au, 22.0 g/t Ag, 0.82% Pb, 0.20% Cu and 0.98% Zn from hole M14-
01 and 18.0 m of 15.2 g/t Au, 13.3 g/t Ag, 1.0% Pb, 0.2% Cu and 0.77% Zn from hole M14-02

10.7 Benton / Nordmin Joint Venture (2016) 

From August, 2016 to November 2016 Nordmin Engineering of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada 
completed a diamond drilling program consisting of infill/definition drilling to further define the 
51, 41 and 04 zones on the Cape Ray Property. A total of 29 holes were drilled at Cape Ray in 
2016. While the previous wide spaced drilling has proved effective in delineating the gold 
deposits on the property, an infill drill program was designed to increase the confidence in the 
mineral resource which provided the basis for this updated PEA. Three separate zones were 
targeted; the 51 Zone, the 41 Zone and the 04 Zone including 2 holes in between the 04 and 41 
zones. Figure 10-4 and Table 10-5 show the 2016 drill hole collar locations. Highlights for the 
2016 drilling program can be found in Table 10-6.

The NQ-sized (47.6 mm diameter) core drilling program was carried out by Lantech Drilling 
Services Ltd. of Dieppe, New Brunswick. Two drill rigs of type DDM(EF50) were used to complete 
the campaign. Holes were inclined at -65º to -50º inclination, and ranged from 117 to 237 m in 
length. A Reflex down hole single-shot survey instrument was used for directional surveys of the 
drill holes. All core from the 2016 drilling program is currently stored in cross pile at the Cape 
Ray Property. 

Proposed hole locations were established by Nordmin staff using a hand-held GPS unit. 
Immediately after the drill hole was completed, the collar location was re-measured again using 
the hand-held GPS.

From December 1
st

 to 6
th

, 2016, Giovanni Sferrazza and Even Stavre (Nordmin) from Sudbury, 
Ont., performed a two-day surveying campaign to capture differential GPS coordinates for the 
2016 drill hole collars. The equipment used consisted of a Trimble Dual-Frequency R10 GNSS 
Receiver and R-TR01 Dual Frequency Base Kit. The GPS data was downloaded, processed and 
adjusted using Trimble Business Center (TBC) software. Due to weather constraints, the survey 
was only 20% completed, but that was enough to verify the accuracy of the handheld GPS. 

 
Figure 10-5 December 2016 Cape Ray Drill Hole Survey Campaign 

All drill core from the 2016 drilling program was logged by Even Stavre P.Geo, a Senior Project 
Geologist (Nordmin), Stephen House P.Geo (contractor), and Morgan Silver (contractor). A total 
of 744 drill core samples and 118 QC samples were submitted to Eastern Analytical Ltd. for Au 
analysis using the FA-AA method and multi-element analysis using ICP-34 method. Samples were 
automatically re-run with gravimetric finish if initial assaying returned >10 g/t Au. Silver, copper, 
lead and zinc were re-assayed by the 'ore grade assay' AA analysis method with three acid 
digestion if they exceeded the detection limits of the multi-element ICP package. Silver was re-
assayed if original results exceeded 6.0 g/t Ag.

10.7.1 51 Zone 

Holes CR-16-20 to 35 were designed to infill the 51 Zone and increase the confidence in the 
mineral resource. Significant galena and sphalerite were noted along with chalcopyrite to 
comprise rich sulfide zones where gold occurs primarily in quartz breccia veins in the 
hangingwall of a graphitic schist layer. 

Data interpretation indicated the presence of gently southwest plunging "grade-shoots" along 
the Cape Ray Fault Zone. Several drill holes were proposed to test the postulated down-plunge 
continuation of interpreted grade-shoots. A total of 16 holes were drilled totalling 2571.50m.  

Drill holes CR-16-34 and CR-16-35 were planned to test out the open area between historic holes 
PB88-286 and PB79-144. The postulated Au mineralized grade-shoot was intercepted within the 
graphite schists and hole CR-16-34 returned 5.02 g/t Au over 4.05 m (123.35m to 127.40m). Hole 
CR-16-35 intercepted the down plunge of mineralized zone 25m west of hole 34 and returned 
1.65g/t Au over 0.30m (130.35m to 130.65m) (Figure 10-6).

Hole CR-16-27 tested the down plunge Au mineralized zone defined by historic holes PB88-256 
and PB88-289. Chlorite/graphite alteration was intercepted with moderate amount of 
sphalerite/galena mineralization. The zone was in the immediate CRFZ hanging wall contact. This 
hole returned 1.12 g/t Au over 1.50m (175.50m to 177.00m). 

Hole CR-16-28 intercepted the down plunge of the sulphide zone in the graphitic schist defined 
by historic holes PB88-279 and PB96-377. The hole returned low Au values. 

Holes CR-16-22 and CR-16-23 were planned to increase the confidence of the mineral resource. 
Hole CR-16-22 intercepted the mineralized down plunge following the historic hole PB79-099. 
The hole intercepted a major chloritic shear zone with significant graphitic schist and mineralized 
quartz veining. Low Au values were returned with the best value 1.32 g/t Au over 1.00m (87.00m 
to 88.00m). The overall mineralized zone encountered was approximately 3.90m wide with 12% 
sphalerite and 3% galena noted in the core.  

Hole CR-16-23 intercepted a 12.9m wide chlorite/graphite-rich interval with lesser patchy 
sulphides. The chlorite and graphite zones were noted immediately on the CRFZ hangingwall 
contact. Low Au values were returned from sampling. 

Drill hole CR-16-24 and CR-16-25 were planned to test the down-plunge of high grade 
mineralization intersected in historic drill holes PB96-368 and PB88-282. Quartz and carbonate 
veining intercepts were moderate to abundant in the graphitic schist interval, with sulphide 
concentrations up to 15% pyrite, 5% sphalerite, and 1% galena. Hole CR-16-24 returned a 
weighted average grade of 3.32 g/t Au over 3.0 m (82.80m to 85.80m m). This hole confirmed 
the mineralization within the graphite schist contained in the proposed open pit shell. (Figure 
10-8)

Hole CR-16-25 intercepted the targeted mineralized zone in the CRFZ hangingwall contact. 
Significant sulphide mineralization was intercepted within a strong quartz breccia and quartz 
filled fault system situated at 55.7m to 58.3m with best Au concentrations of 7.54g/t Au over 
1.70m (56.60m to 58.30m) (Figure 10-9).

Hole CR-16-21 mainly encountered chloritic schist to target depth, except for graphitic schist 
intersected from 208.10m to 220.70m which contained sulphide bearing, broken quartz vein 
material. Significant concentrations of sphalerite (13%) and galena (8%) mineralization was 
noted between 208.90m to 211.70m which returned 16.68 g/t Au over 2.80m (Figure 10-10).

10.7.2 41 Zone 

In 2016, there were 7 drill holes completed in the 41 Zone totalling 879.0 metres. The 41 Zone is 
represented by graphitic schist units intercalated with chloritic schists which reach up to 30-40m 
into the hangingwall above the A Vein (Main 41 Zone). Drill holes were designed to; 1) follow the 
plunge of the historic drill intercepts, and 2) increase the confidence of the mineral resource.

Graphitic gouge zones up to 6m wide that host the A Vein contain cm-wide fragments of wall 
rock, quartz veins, and sulphides in a fine-grained matrix. Locally the gouge zones return high-
grade values of Au, Ag, Pb and Zn. The graphitic schist unit becomes strongly to moderately 
contorted and banded further into the footwall of the fault zone, but cm- to m-wide graphitic 
and/or chloritic gouge is still common. The graphitic schist unit contains up to 60% quartz or 
quartz-carbonate veins. At least three mineralized quartz breccias veins or stockwork zones are 
present in the footwall of the 41 Zone and these are termed the C Vein.  

Holes CR-16-40 to CR-16-42 were designed to test the potential for gold mineralization between 
the 51 and 41 zones. 

Hole CR-16-42 was designed to fill in between the historic holes PB78-03 and PB80-153. The 
mineralization was intercepted in stacked alternating chlorite graphite schists with significant 
sulphide amounts from 88.70m to 129.90m including up to 15% pyrite, 8% sphalerite and 6% 
galena. The hole returned 6.57 g/t Au and 28.6 g/t Ag over 3.6m (100.70m to 104.30m). A 
secondary low-grade interval returned 0.47 g/t Au over 9.40m (120.5m to 129.90m), including 
6.32g/t Au over 0.30m (123.30m to 123.60m) (Figure 10-11). 

Hole CR-16-36 was planned to confirm the mineralization from historic hole CR-04-20. Due to 
drilling conditions this hole was stopped before the target depth. 

Hole CR-16-40 was planned to test the down plunge of the historic hole PB78-056. Due to drilling 
conditions the hole was stopped before reaching the target depth. 

Hole CR-16-47 was designed to test the extent of the 41 zone towards the 04 zone to the east. 
Majority of the lithologies are chlorite and graphite schists with the best sections of 
mineralization intersected between 125m and 137.5m. Erratic quartz breccia veins were 
scattered through the fault zone displaying up to 4% pyrite, 2% sphalerite, and lesser galena. 
Assay results returned low Au concentrations.

Figure 10-11 Hole CR-16-42. Mineralized stacked zones in graphite schist hanging wall contact CRFZ. Depth is 65m-114.10m 

10.7.3 04 Zone 

Holes CR-16-36 to 38, CR-16-44 to 46 and holes CR16-50 and 51 were designed to test the 04 
zone. The 04 Zone occurs along a northeast-trending fault within the CRFZ system, which dips 
moderately (50-60º) to the southeast. This zone consists of tabular zones of quartz veins, fault 
gouge and wall rock fragments, range from several cm to a few metres in width, and correlate 
laterally for up to 360m along strike. In section, the 04 and 41 Zones show east-southeast to 
southeast plunges and locally show down-dip extension of up to 300m (Dubé and Lauzière, 
1997).  

In 2016 Nordmin completed eight holes for a total of 1553.3m. The program was laid out to 1) 
increase the confidence in the mineral resource, and 2) to test out the down dip extension of the 
known mineralization zones. At least four stacked tabular quartz breccia veins, and fault filled 
quartz veining were intercepted. Most of the mineralization sits in the hangingwall contact of 
the moderately sheared graphite schists within the gouge zone of the CRFZ. The zones range 
from cm in width up to 2 metres individually. The strike extents of two major veins (A Vein and B 
Vein) have been delineated along the length of the deposit by previous drilling. Both veins are 
moderately to strongly boudinaged with locally strong cataclastic textures. Quartz breccia and 
quartz healed faults appear to have a good correlation to Au concentration for both vein. The 
two veins are up to 17m apart and locally up to 10% sulphides. Pyrite is primarily euhedral with 
overprints of sphalerite and galena. Chalcopyrite inclusions are also noted. Alteration consists of 
of graphitic schists and sericite-chlorite-carbonate schists.  

Holes CR-16-37 and CR-16-38 were planned as infill and to test the down plunge continuity

defined by historic holes PB88-252 and PB88-255. Hole CR-16-37 intersected the entire 
mineralized zone and returned low Au grades. The best intercepts returned were 1.45 g/t Au 
over 0.40m (287.20m to 287.60m) and 2.33 g/t over 1.00m (356.50m to 357.50m). Both 
intercepts are in the hangingwall of the graphite schist (Figure 10-12). Drill hole CR-16-38 
returned anomalous gold values but did not reach the footwall of the target zone.

Holes CR-16-44, CR-16-45, CR-16-46 tested the down plunge extent of mineralization within the 
proposed pit shell. Hole CR-16-44 returned 3.11 g/t Au over 0.50m (110.00m to 110.50m), 6.93 
g/t Au over 0.70m (126.50m to 127.20m), 2.61 g/t Au over 1.00m (129.00m to 130.00m), 2.93 
g/t Au over 1.00m (147.00m to 148.00m). Hole CR-16-45 returned 12.46 g/t Au over 0.50m 
(165.00m to 165.50m). Hole CR-16-46 was abandoned prior to reaching target depth. 

Holes CR-16-51 and CR-16-52 were drilled to test the down plunge of mineralization below the 
proposed pit shell. Hole CR-16-51 returned 5.36 g/t Au over 2.00m (118.30m to 120.30m) and 
may not have reached the footwall of the target zone. Hole CR-16-52 returned 6.96 g/t Au over 
5.00m (135.40m to 140.40m), 6.65g/t Au over 1.00m (167.60m to 168.60m) (Figure 10-13).

11. Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

11.1  Historic Drilling Programs (pre-Benton 2014) 

Riocanex did selective sampling of drill core based on geological criteria such as visible 
mineralisation or the presence of quartz veining. Samples were generally no greater than 1.5 m 
in length. The core was split on site with one half being placed into bags for analysis and the 
remaining half being returned to the core trays. The bagged samples were labeled and shipped 
to X-Ray Assay Laboratories (XRAL – now SGS Canada) and analysed for Au and Ag. If sulphides 
were apparent, Cu, Pb and Zn were also determined. Au and Ag were analysed by fire assay with 
an atomic adsorption finish method (FA-AA) and detection limits of 0.34 g/t for Au and 6.9 g/t 
for Ag. Cu, Pb and Zn were analysed by the X-Ray fluorescence method (XRF) with a detection 
limit of 0.01%. Riocanex also performed check analyses of select samples using 1/8th of the 
reject sample from X-Ray Assay Laboratories, which were sent to Swastika Laboratories Ltd. of 
Swastika, Ontario for analysis. Some of the archived drill core was moved to the Pasadena core 
facility upon Riocanex's withdrawal from the Cape Ray project in the early 1980's, where it is 
presently available for viewing (Ténière & Hilchey, 2012).  

For the Dolphin drilling programs the samples were analysed using the fire assay (FA) method 
with a gravimetric finish to evaluate for Au and Ag; final results were reported in troy ounces per 
short ton (1 troy ounce/ton = 34.28 g/t). The screen metallic's method was used for selected drill 
core samples suspected of containing visible or coarse Au. All drill core samples were shipped 
directly to Vangeochem Lab Ltd. of North Vancouver, BC, TSL Laboratories of Mississauga, ON, or 
Eastern Analytical Ltd. for preparation and analysis. All laboratories were independent of 
Dolphin. In addition to precious metal assays, samples containing >1000 ppb Au were analysed 
for Cu, Pb and Zn (Ténière & Hilchey, 2012). 

The Royal Oak drill core was logged and split on site; core samples shipped to Eastern Analytical 
Ltd for FA-AA analysis. Samples were also analysed using a 9-element inductively coupled plasma 
and mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) package that included Cu, Pb and Zn. After completion of the 
drilling program, the core was moved and stored at the Hope Brook mine site. None of the core 
has survived over time and none is available for viewing. Royal Oak reporting does not include 
details of sampling methodology for their Cape Ray drilling program (Ténière & Hilchey, 2012). 

For the Terra Nova / Tenacity Gold drilling programs, the samples were sealed in plastic sample 
bags, placed in shipping bags, tagged and sealed with plastic tie straps. Samples were not 
secured in a locked facility prior to transport. Sample series numbers were recorded on shipping 
sheets. All sample analysis was performed by Eastern Analytical Laboratories of Springdale, 
Newfoundland where they were analyzed for Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn and As. According to Sparkes & 
Kendle (2004), all sampling was done in compliance with the Mineral Exploration Best Practices 
Guidelines. There is no detailed description of the quality control and quality assurance 
methods.

Cape Ray Technical Report February 08, 2017 
 

Based on review of available documentation as summarized above, Nordmin is of the opinion 
that details of quality control and quality assurance methods employed by Riocanex, Dolphin, 
Royal Oak and Terra Nova during the 1978 to 2004 periods on the Cape Ray property are not 
well documented and cannot be assessed in detail, but the data indicates that industry standard 
practices at that time were being followed.  

11.2 2014 to 2016 Benton and Nordmin Drilling Programs 

During the 2014 and 2016 drilling programs, selective sampling of drill core was based on 
geological criteria such as visible mineralisation or the presence of quartz veining. Samples were 
generally no greater than 1.5 metres in length and no shorter than 0.3 metres, with the average 
length being 1.1 metres. The core was sawn on site using with one half being placed into bags for 
analysis and the remaining half being returned to the core trays where it is cross-stacked and 
stored on the property.  

Samples were placed in large rice bags for shipping at an average of 10 samples per rice bag. The 
rice bags were labeled with sample number range, rice bag number identification, and date. The 
rice bags were sealed with tape and tagged prior to shipping with in-house security tags. 
Laboratory purchased sample security tags were not used. The rice bags were picked up and 
transported by Eastern Analytical Laboratories personnel from Springdale. 

A signed submittal form was included inside each rice bag recording the sample numbers, 
sample type, element(s) of the laboratory analysis and instructions for storage & disposal for 
pulps and rejects. 

At Eastern Analytical Laboratories, sample preparation consisted of crushing to 80% passing -10 
mesh, splitting 250 grams, and pulverizing to 95% passing -150 mesh. Samples were analyzed for 
gold by fire assay with an AA finish. Samples were automatically re-run with gravimetric finish if 
initial assaying returned >10 g/t Au. Samples were also submitted for the ICP-34 Multi-Acid 
method where a 200mg subsample was dissolved in four acids and analyzed by ICP-OES. Silver, 
copper, lead and zinc were re-assayed by the 'ore grade assay' AA analysis method with three 
acid digestion if they exceeded the detection limits of the multi-element ICP package. Silver was 
re-assayed if original results exceeded 6.0 g/t Ag. 

A description of Nordmin's quality control program and analysis of the results can be found in 
Section 12.3 of this report. 

The QP is of the opinion that the sample preparation techniques, security and analytical 
procedures used by the former operators followed industry practices at such time. Benton and 
Nordmin also generally followed best practices for the 2014 to 2016 programs.

12. Data Verification 

The Cape Ray project has utilised historical drilling dating back as far as 1977. Of the 512 historic 
drill holes completed between 1977 and 2006, a total of 93 holes are located in the core storage 
facility operated by the Newfoundland Department of Natural Resources (NLDNR) and located in 
the town of Pasadena. An additional 20 holes from the 2003/2004 Terra Nova drilling campaigns 
are located at NLDNR's Buchans core storage facility. Drill core from the Benton and Nordmin 
programs is cross piled and stored on the property. All core boxes are identified with aluminium 
tags recording hole number, drill core intervals, and box number. 

12.1 Historic Drilling Programs (pre-Benton 2014) 

Data verification has consisted of examining six historic holes representing a random selection of 
those available and locating a selection of holes in the field where the casing had not been 
removed. None of the available core is in good enough shape to allow a reasonable resampling 
through the collection of additional ¼ core samples (Figure 12-1). However, hole PB79-135 had 
been recently resampled by Benton Resources in early 2014 and the assay certificates were 
made available to Nordmin. A review of the certificates confirmed proper procedures had been 
followed including the use of blank samples and duplicates as well as standards. The core 
remaining in the core boxes shows that samples were collected by cutting the available core in 
half using a diamond saw. Figure 12-2 a) and b) show the comparison of the re-assays with the 
original assays on record.

Figure 12-2 Comparison of Re-assays of Samples from Hole PB79-135. a) Au and b) Ag 

In 2003 and 2004, Terra Nova Gold Corporation completed 20 drill holes on the Cape Ray 
property. An assessment report describing the work program was made available that included 
assay certificates and detailed drill logs. Although the report did not describe any quality control 
program, the report states that all sampling was done in compliance with the Mineral 
Exploration Best Practices Guidelines. The assay certificates and drill logs were spot checked to 
validate the drill hole database. No issues were identified. 

It is the opinion of Darren O'Brien, the QP responsible for this section of the report, that this 
work verifies the validity of the original sampling and analyses and that the results are suitable 
for use in resource estimation. 

12.2 2014 Diamond Drilling Program 

In 2014 Benton Resources Inc completed 3051.6m of diamond drilling in 17 exploratory holes 
primarily focused on testing the PW Zone, located between the WGH and 51 mineral resource 
areas. The PW Zone is an exploration target and the possible extension of the WGH deposit. It is 
defined by soil geochemistry, prospecting, and IP geophysics.  

For quality control, Benton personnel inserted one blank and one standard with known Au 
content for every 20 samples shipped to the assay lab. A total of 51 blanks and 51 standards 
were inserted during the program.  

As most of the drilling was located outside of the defined mineral resource areas, the quality 
control samples were not analyzed as part of this PEA.

12.3 2016 Diamond Drilling Program 

During the drilling campaign, Nordmin implemented external analytical quality control measures 
to monitor the reliability of the assay results delivered by the primary laboratory. A total of 118 
external control samples (blank samples, certified reference samples, and field duplicate 
samples) were inserted into the core sample stream and comprise 13.7 percent of the samples 
submitted to the primary laboratory for assay analysis. 

 Nordmin inserted blank sample material consisting of either 100 gram bags of silica sand 
prepared by a certified lab, or coarse limestone chip rock purchased commercially and used to 
create 2 kg blank samples. On average, one blank sample was inserted for every 20 samples. 
Additional blanks samples were inserted before and after any suspected high-grade samples to 
detect any sample contamination. A total of 56 blank samples were inserted into the sample 
stream. Only 18 of the samples returned detectable amounts of gold (>= 5ppb Au) and there 
were no sample failures returning greater than three times the detection limit (Figure 12-3). 

 
Figure 12-3 Gold Analysis of Quality Control Blank Samples 

Nordmin submitted a range of standard reference samples with certified gold values (Table 12-1) 
into the sample stream. A total of 28 standard reference samples were submitted during the 
drilling program.

Overall the standards performed well and no bias or instrument drift was apparent. There were 
no laboratory failures detected and no standard samples exceeded +/-2 standard deviations of 
the certified gold values (Figure 12-4). 

 

Figure 12-4 Z-Score of Quality Control Standard Reference Samples 

Field duplicate samples were inserted at a ratio of one to every 20 samples. Field duplicates 
were obtained by quartering the core with the opposite one-quarter considered the original 
sample. The field duplicate was assigned the higher sample number of the sample pair. There 
were no preparation duplicate samples utilized during the drilling campaign. 

A total of 34 field duplicate pairs were analyzed using statistical measures including linear 
regression plots and relative difference vs. gold grade plots. While 14 of the duplicate pairs 
plotted with a relative difference of greater than +/-20%, only four of those sample pairs had an 
average grade of >1 g/t Au which gives an indication of the grade variability in a drill core sized 
sample. The use of preparation duplicate samples would provide a better homogenized sample 
dataset for analyzing laboratory performance. 

It is the opinion of Darren O'Brien, the QP responsible for this section of the report, that the 
2016 drilling program and analysis are suitable for use in resource estimation.

Cape Ray Technical Report February 08, 2017 
 

13. Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

There are historical and recent bench test campaigns which were conducted on the ore bodies in 
the Cape Ray fault zone which have been summarized in the following:  

13.1 Metallurgical Testing 

1981, Rio Algom retained Lakefield Research of Canada Ltd. (Lakefield) to conduct metallurgical 
testing on a bulk sample from the Cape Ray 41-A vein (Wyslouzil & Yen, 1981). 

 1989, Dolphin Explorations Ltd., wholly owned by Corona Resources Ltd., retained Lakefield for 
bench testing on a composite made from Cape Ray 51 and Cape Ray 04 deposits drill core rejects 
(Salter & Williamson, 1989).  

2013, Benton Resources commissioned Met-Solve Laboratories Inc. in Langley, BC for test work 
on dense media separation (DMS) and gravity with a trench sample from Cape Ray 51 deposit 
(Grewal & Lum, 2014).  

2014, Nordmin Engineering Ltd. selected ALS Laboratories of Kamloops, BC, under partnership 
with Benton Resources, who conducted tests consisting of whole ore flotation, whole ore leach 
and gravity recoverable gold on Cape Ray 04 deposit, Cape Ray 51 deposit and a grab sample 
from a stockpile drawn from the Cape Ray 41 deposit (Sloan & Roulston, 2015).  

Previous studies looked at recovering all valuable minerals with a high grade lead concentrate or 
recovering the gold and silver only. Economics of the day swayed the test program one way or 
another. The 2014 test work for the Nordmin and Benton partnership looked at whole ore 
flotation, whole ore leach and gravity recoverable gold as the baseline test work.  

13.2 1981, Lakefield Research for Rio Algom 

Calculated head grade of a sample taken from Cape Ray 41 A vein was 4.53 g/t Au, 24.4 g/t Ag, 
0.32% Pb, 0.53% Zn and 0.28% Cu. The sample was subjected to 15 cyanide roll tests at a grind 
size of 86.8% passing 200 mesh (74 µm). Gold extraction was 97% and silver was 40% at a 
cyanide consumption rate of 0.7 kg/t and lime consumption of 1.4 kg/t. (Wyslouzil & Yen, 1981). 

Three whole ore bench flotation tests were completed to produce a lead concentrate as 
illustrated in Table 13-1.

An additional test of flotation of cyanide residue yielded 97% gold recovery and 84% silver 
recovery. Settling tests of cyanide leach residue displayed settling rates of 0.13-0.15 m/tonne of 
dry solids. (Wyslouzil & Yen, 1981) 

13.3 1989, Lakefield Research for Corona Resources Ltd.  

Samples for this campaign were made up of six drill core rejects from both the Cape Ray 04 and 
Cape Ray 51 deposit. A composite sample was created with the calculated head grade of 13.4 g/t 
Au, 30.8 g/t Ag, 1.41% Pb, 1.04% Zn, and 0.24% Cu (Salter & Williamson, 1989). The results of 
this testing campaign are as follows: 

 The sample was subject to 12 cyanide roll tests at a grind size of 86% passing 200 mesh 
(74 µm).  

 Gold extraction was 97% with a cyanide consumption rate of 0.6 kg/t and lime 
consumption rate of 1.0 kg/t lime.  

 Settling test results of cyanide residue were 0.35 m2/tonne/day. 

 Locked cycle tests were conducted to establish if recycling pre-aeration solution and 
barren solution would have an adverse effect on leach extraction. Once equilibrium was 
achieved 96.2% gold extraction was observed at a cyanide consumption rate of 0.4 kg/t.  

 Cyanide destruction test revealed that both total and free cyanide levels can be reduced 
to less than 1 mg/L.  

13.4 2013, Met-Solve Laboratories for Benton Resources 

In 2013, Benton Resources sent a bulk trench sample from Cape Ray 51 deposit to Met-Solve 
Laboratories in Langley, British Columbia to investigate the potential for pre-concentration using 
dense media separation and gravity recovery. The calculated head grade of the sample was 8.0 
g/t Au, 42.1 g/t Ag, 2.05% Pb, 0.68% Zn, and 0.23% Cu.  

The sample was subject to heavy liquid separation to determine the specific gravity (SG) cut 
point of the sample at two different crush sizes (-10 mm and -6.7 mm); dense media separation 
(DMS) at two different SG cut points (2.83 and 2.93) and gravity concentration on products. A 
Bond ball work index test was completed and is summarized in Table 13-9 (Grewal & Lum, 2014). 

13.4.1 Met-Solve Dense Media Separation Results 

The dense media separation (DMS) testing was conducted using Sepro's Condor Multi-Stage pilot 
unit. The sample was crushed to -19 mm and screened at 1.3 mm. The +1.3 mm size fraction was 
subjected to the DMS. At the 2.93 cut point, the unit recovered 55.4% of the lead and 26.7% of 
the gold in a 5.8% mass yield. Lowering the SG cut point to 2.83 increased the recovery to 62.9% 
and 29.9% for lead and gold respectively, but also increased the mass yield to 9.1% resulting in 
the lower grades as illustrated in Table 13-2 (Grewal & Lum, 2014).

13.4.2 Met-Solve Gravity Results 

A two stage process was used to determine gravity recoverable gold. The first gravity stage used 
a Falcon L40 to produce a high grade gold product similar to batch recovery. The second stage 
used a Falcon L40 operating at high mass yields to simulate a continuous product. The Met-Solve 
Analytical Table was used to upgrade the product. Total recovery is summarized in Table 13-3. 
There is no value for lead, as gold was analysed to extinction by fire assay (Grewal & Lum, 2014).

A combination of DMS with gravity was tested due to the low gold values reporting to the DMS 
sinks fraction. Gravity was conducted on the -1.3 mm fraction (screened prior to DMS) and the 
floats fraction. Met-Solve cautions that the mass yields for the gold is much lower than would be 
observed in the plant, due to the nature of the testing equipment. This combined test is 
summarized in Table 13-4.

13.5 ALS Laboratories for Benton/Nordmin Partnership 

Four samples, collected in September and October 2014, were sent to ALS Laboratory in 
Kamloops, BC. The Cape Ray 04 sample was composited of approximately 40 m from two drilled 
cores collected specifically for metallurgical testing. The composited philosophy for this sample 
was to maintain a higher grade for testing purposes. The Cape Ray 51 deposit sample was 
composited from a trench sample. Buckets were collected, assayed and a deposit grade sample 
was created. The Cape Ray 41 sample was composited from grab samples collected from a 3,000 
tonne stockpile that was mined from an underground ramp and has been sitting on surface since 
1989. Head grades are listed in Table 13-5 (Sloan & Roulston, 2015).

13.5.1 ALS Flotation Summary 

The Cape Ray 04 and the Cape Ray 51 composite samples were tested for flotation response. 
Grind size for the samples was 80% passing 95 µm for 04 and 80% passing 98 µm for the 51 
deposit. The goal for this campaign was to determine if a separate bulk copper/lead concentrate 
and zinc concentrate could be possible for a potential market.  

Bulk rougher recoveries for Cape Ray 04 were 96% for gold, 90% for silver, 96% for lead, 45% for 
zinc and 87% for copper. Zinc recovery in the zinc circuit was 52% because of the higher recovery 
in bulk rougher. Optimizing conditions could change the reporting stage for zinc and depress 
more in the bulk circuit (Sloan & Roulston, 1989). 

Overall rougher and cleaner recoveries for the 51 deposit 95% for gold, 89% for silver, 60% for

lead, 52% for zinc and 92% for copper.  

Reagent scheme included zinc sulphate and sodium cyanide for primary grind and depression of 
sphalerite with 3418A as the copper and lead sulphide collector. Copper sulphate was used to 
activate the sphalerite in the zinc circuit, with SIPX as the collector. Lime was used for pH 
adjustment with targets of 9 in the bulk circuit and 11 in the zinc circuit.  

A single batch cleaner test was completed on both the 04 and 51 samples, with the grind size 
and reagent suite mentioned above. Only a bulk flotation test was performed on the 51 sample 
and no flotation work was performed on the 41 sample due to the probability that the stockpile 
sample had been oxidized.  

Both Cape Ray 04 and 51 showed good recovery for gold in the bulk rougher stage. For 04, this 
value was a 91% recovery and for the 51 sample, 75% gold was recovered (Sloan & Roulston, 
2015). 

13.5.2 ALS Gravity Summary 

For each of Cape Ray 04, 51 and 41 a 30 kg sample was subjected to a gravity gold recovery test 
(GRG) using a lab scale Knelson concentrator with a 100 g cone. Three iterative sizes were used 
of 665 µm, 216 µm 59 µm and the concentrate was assayed to extinction. For the three samples, 
gravity recovery was between 73 and 86%. See Table 13-6 for the cumulative final stage recovery 
of gold and silver. Silver recovery was not as good with a range of 33-49% for the three samples 
(Sloan & Roulston, 2015).

13.6 ALS Cyanide Leach Summary 

Each sample as subjected to bench scale bottle roll cyanide leach test on whole ore. The samples 
were sparged with oxygen and lime was used for pH adjustment targets of 11-11.5. The samples 
were leached for a total of 48 hours with the liquor sampled at hour 2, 6, 24 and 48. Grind sizes 
(K80) were between 95-105 µm. (Sloan & Roulston, 2015). 

Initial sodium cyanide concentrations of 1,000 ppm were used for all samples. However, due to 
the higher consumption rates of the 51 deposit, three additional tests at 750 ppm, 500 ppm, and 
250 ppm were conducted to observe the effect on gold and silver extraction. Table 13-7 shows 
the results of each of the tests. At 24 hours, there is a greater than 96% extraction of gold for all 
samples except the 250 ppm concentration. Gold and Silver extraction rates are summarized in 
Table 13-8

The highest silver extraction was with the Cape Ray deposit 04 at 70-74%, and the lowest was 
the Cape Ray 41 stockpile sample at 50-52% extraction. The Cape Ray deposit 51 achieved 62-
64% extraction, even at the lower sodium cyanide concentrations. The last three tests in Table 
13-7 include the addition of 200 ppm PbNO3 to aid in increasing the silver recovery but did not 
show any significant effect. (Sloan & Roulston, 2015).  

Reagent consumption rates for all the tests are listed in Table 13-8 below. Optimization work 
would be required to determine the appropriate relationship between leaching kinetics and 
cyanide consumption depending on individual sample or a blending strategy. Recoverable gold 
extraction with this test work is consistent with the test campaign conducted on the 41 deposit 
in 1981 for Rio Algom and a blend of 04+51 deposit 1989 for Corona Resources.

13.8 Mineralogical Analysis 

The 04 sample and the 51 sample were both subjected to Particle Mineral Analysis (PMA) using 
QEMSCAN at the ALS laboratory. Chalcopyrite is the primary copper bearing mineral with minor 
amounts of bornite and chalcocite and trace amounts of covellite and tennantite/enargite (Sloan 
& Roulston, 2015). 

The sulphide content measured 2.7 wt% for the 04 and 2.2 wt% for the 51 deposit. Liberation of 
the copper minerals in the two-dimensional field was 41% for 90 µm K80 primary grind for the 
04 deposit. This was higher for the 51 deposit which showed 70% liberation for copper minerals 
at 111 µm K80. This indicates that there is availability for optimization of the target grind size 
should flotation be the primary recovery method, as a target of 50-55% liberation is 
recommended for performance.  

In the Cape Ray 04 composite, there was evidence of chalcopyrite disease, which is when very 
fine grains of chalcopyrite are dotted within a sphalerite particles making liberation of both 
minerals difficult at all grind sizes. Galena liberation was 55% for the sample.  

13.9 Discussion 

It is the author's opinion, based solely on geological and mineralogical principals, that the tests 
done to date have been reasonable and that they have resulted in favourable results that have 
successfully demonstrated that processing should not present any insurmountable challenges.

14. Mineral Resource Estimates 

The estimation of the mineral resources of the Cape Ray deposits follows a 29 hole drilling 
campaign carried out on the property by Nordmin Engineering Ltd ("Nordmin") in the summer of 
2016. The mineral resource estimate of the Cape Ray property includes the 51, 04, 41, and 
Windowglass Hill deposits, and has an effective date of February 1, 2017. 

All geologic interpretations and grade estimation parameters were reviewed and defined from 
first principals in this mineral resource update. The interpretation, digitization, and wireframing 
of the mineralized units was carried out by the Darren O'Brien of O'Brien Geological Consulting 
Inc. and Even Stavre of Nordmin. The drill hole data was provided by Nordmin, following its 
validation by Messrs. O'Brien and Stavre. The estimation of gold and silver grades into a mineral 
resource was carried out by Mr. Marc Jutras, Principal, Mineral Resources, at Ginto Consulting 
Inc. Mr. Jutras is an independent qualified person as defined under National Instrument 43-101.  

This mineral resource estimation exercise was primarily undertaken with the Vulcan® software 
and utilities internally developed in GSLIB-type format. The following sections outline the 
procedures undertaken to calculate the mineral resource.  

14.1  51 Zone 

14.1.1 Drill Hole Data  

The drill hole database is made of 143 holes intersecting the mineralized orebody of the 51 Zone. 
A total of 831 Au and Ag assays are located within the main vein orebody. All missing samples 
were replaced with a 0.0 g/t value for gold and silver. 

14.1.2 Location, Orientation, and Spacing of Drill Holes 

The location of the drill holes is presented in Figure 14-1 for the 51 Zone. As seen in this Figure, 
although most of the drill holes are located within the area of interest, drill holes in surrounding 
areas are also observed. The latter are however not part of the estimate of the 51 Zone. 
Statistics on drill hole spacing indicate an overall average distance of 20.1m and median of 
20.5m. Most of the drill holes are located in the upper half of the 51 Zone orebody.

14.1.3 Geologic Modeling 

The control on mineralization of the 51 Zone consists of a single shear zone associated with a 
graphitic schist unit. This vein-type orebody is oriented at an azimuth of approximately 50° and 
dipping at approximately 60° to the southeast. The modeling process comprises of the 
interpretation of geologic units in combination with the gold and silver grades. These 
interpretations were digitized and snapped to drill holes on northwest-southeast sections, and 
then linked together in 3-D as a wireframe in the Vulcan® software (Figure 14-3 and Figure 14-4).

14.1.4 Compositing 

The samples of the 51 Zone show that 29% of them are 0.9m long and 19% are 0.7m long. The 
original sample lengths of gold and silver assays were composited to regular 1.0m intervals for 
each hole. The 1.0m composite length preserves the intrinsic variability of the original samples 
and provides a good fit with the envisioned block size for the block model of grade estimates 
(3mx3mx3m), providing a 3:1 ratio of block height to composite length. The compositing process 
consists of 3 compositing stages in this case. Starting from the drill hole collar, down to the 
hanging wall of the orebody, then a new compositing begins at the hanging wall up to the 
footwall of the orebody, and a final compositing starts at the footwall of the orebody and stops 
at the end of the drill hole. A total of 680 composites were generated from 144 holes.  

14.1.5 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

A set of various statistical applications was utilized to provide a better understanding of the gold 
and silver grade populations within the mineralized zone.  

14.1.5.1 Bivariate Statistics 

A scatterplot was generated to examine the possible relationship of gold with silver within the 
51 Zone deposit. As seen in Figure 14-6, there is a moderate correlation between gold and silver, 
with a correlation coefficient of 0.574.

positively skewed lognormal populations. Basic statistics results are presented as boxplots in 
Figure 14-7 and Figure 14-8. As seen in this figure, the gold and silver grade populations are 
somewhat well behaved with coefficients of variation (CV) lesser than 3.0; CVAu = 2.75, CVAg = 
2.61.

offs, where the number of samples above various cut-offs, the highest grades, and the distance 
to the nearest hole were computed on a per drill hole basis. As seen in Figure 14-9

, 
holes with the highest gold intercepts of the 51 Zone are PB78-051 and PB96-365. From Figure 
14-10, the holes with the highest silver intercepts of the 51 Zone are PB88-279, PB88-284, PB88-
291, and PB79-142. The statistics calculated in these Figures can also be useful to detect the 
presence of isolated higher grades. In such case, difficulties during grade estimation could occur 
due to a greater generation of higher grade blocks in this area. After inspection of the average 
distances away from the closest hole and the maximum grades reported in Figure 14-9 and 
Figure 14-10, it was concluded that no isolated hole(s) with high-grade values are present, and 
for such no related difficulties in the grade estimation process is anticipated.

14.1.6 Capping of High-Grade Outliers 

It is common practice to statistically examine the higher grades within a population and to trim 
them to a lower grade value based on the results from specific statistical utilities. This procedure 
is performed on high-grade values that are considered outliers and that cannot be related to any 
geologic feature. In the case of the 51 Zone, the gold and silver higher grades were examined 
with two different tools: the probability plot, and the cutting statistics utility. The usage of 
various investigating methods allows for a selection of the capping threshold in a more objective 
and justified manner. For the probability plot method, the capping value is chosen at the 
location where higher grades depart from the main distribution. For the cutting statistics utility, 
the selection of the capping value is identified at the cut-off grade where there is no correlation 
between the grades above this cut-off. The resulting compilation of the capping thresholds is

listed in Table 14-1 for gold and silver. One of the objectives of the capping strategy is to have 
less than 10% of the metal affected by the capping process. This was achieved in this case.

Basic statistics were re-computed with the gold and silver grades capped to the thresholds listed 
in Table 14.1. Boxplots of Figure 14-11 and Figure 14-12 display the basic statistics resulting from 
the capping of the higher gold and silver grade outliers, respectively. It can be observed from this 
Figure that the coefficients of variation were further reduced for the gold and silver grade 
populations. The effect of the capping of higher gold and silver grade outliers has reduced the 
overall average gold grade by 9.6% and reduced the overall average silver grade by 3.4%.

Because of the generally low coefficients of variation for gold and silver grade populations, 
displaying fairly good grade homogeneity, it can be concluded that there is no need to treat the 
higher grade composites differently than the lower grade composites during the estimation 
process. Ordinary kriging is thus a well suited estimation technique in this case. 

14.1.7 Declustering 

In general, there is a tendency to drill more holes in higher grade areas than in lower grade areas 
when delimiting an orebody. As a result, the higher grade portion of a deposit will be overly 
represented and would translate into a bias towards the higher grades when calculating 
statistical parameters of the population. Thus, a declustering method is utilized to generate a 
more representative set of statistical results within the zone of interest. In this case, a polygonal 
declustering technique was applied to the composites of the 51 Zone. This approach consists of 
assigning the volume of a polygon, defined by the halfway distance between a sample and its 
surrounding neighbours, as a weight for each sample within the mineralized zone. Therefore, a 
sample that is isolated will have a larger weight than a sample located in a densely sampled area.

Comparison of average gold and silver capped and declustered grades with the capped and un-
declustered gold and silver averages shows a consistent reduction of the grade averages 
resulting from the declustering process. This outcome confirms the occurrence of a clustering in 
the higher grade areas, especially for the gold grades of the 51 Zone. A reduction of 21.4% of the 
mean gold grade and a reduction of 0.5% of the mean silver grade are noted.  

The average grade from the declustered statistics provides an excellent comparison with the 
average grade of the interpolated blocks, as a way to assess any overall bias of the estimates.  

14.1.8 Variography 

A variographic analysis was carried out on the gold and silver composites within the vein 
orebody of the 51 Zone. The objective of this analysis was to spatially establish the preferred 
directions of gold and silver grade continuity. In turn, the variograms modeled along those 
directions would be later utilized to select and weigh the composites during the block grade 
interpolation process. For this exercise, all experimental variograms were of the type relative lag 
pairwise, which is considered robust for the assessment of gold and silver grade continuity.  

Variogram maps were first calculated to examine general gold and silver grade continuities in the 
XY, XZ, and YZ planes. The next step undertaken was to compute omni-directional variograms 
and down-hole variograms. The omni-directional variograms are calculated without any 
directional restrictions and provide a good assessment of the sill of the variogram. As for the 
down-hole variogram, it is calculated with the composites of each hole along the trace of the 
hole. The objective of these calculations is to provide information about the short scale structure 
of the variogram, as the composites are more closely spaced down the hole. Thus, the modeling 
of the nugget effect is usually better derived from the down-hole variograms. 

Directional variograms were then computed to identify more specifically the three main 
directions of continuity. A first set of variograms were produced in the horizontal plane at 
increments of 10 degrees. In the same way a second set of variograms were computed at 10° 
increments in the vertical plane of the horizontal direction of continuity (plunge direction). A 
final set of variograms at 10° increments were calculated in the vertical plane perpendicular to 
the horizontal direction of continuity (dip direction). The final variograms were then modeled 
with a 2-structure spherical variogram, and resulting parameters presented in Table 14.2 for gold 
and silver.  

The directions of gold and silver grade continuity are in agreement with the orientation of the 
mineralized zone. At 51 Zone, the orientations of greater continuity are trending to the 
northeast along strike and to the southeast down-dip. The modeled variograms have relatively 
low nugget effects with values of 24% of the sill for gold, and 19% of the sill for silver.  

The experimental variograms are considered of good quality for the along strike and down-dip 
directions, however, for the across strike and dip direction few composites are available.

14.1.9 Gold and Silver Grade Estimation 

The estimation of gold and silver grades into a block model was carried out with the ordinary 
kriging technique. The estimation strategy and parameters were tailored to account for the 
various geometrical, geological, and geostatistical characteristics previously identified. The 
database of 1.0m capped gold and silver grade composites was utilized as input for the grade 
interpolation process.  

The grid definition of the block model is presented in Table 14-3. It should be noted that the 
origin of the block model corresponds to the lower left corner, the point of origin being the 
exterior edges of the first block. The block model is oriented according to a reference grid 
provided by Nordmin. A block size of 3m (easting) x 3m (northing) x 3m (elevation) was selected 
to better reflect the orebody's geometrical configuration and anticipated open pit / underground 
production rate. The block model is rotated with its X axis oriented along an azimuth of 51°.

The size and orientation of the search ellipsoid for the estimation process was based on the 
variogram parameters modeled for gold and silver. For the across strike and dip direction, the 
parameters from the down-the-hole variogram were utilized, due to the restricted number of 
composites available along this direction. No other restrictions, such as a minimum number of 
informed octants, a minimum number of holes, a maximum number of samples per hole, etc., 
were applied to the estimation process. Note that drill hole PB78-058 was added as part of the 
intercepts within the 51 Zone due to its proximity to the interpreted vein. Further details of the 
estimation parameters are presented in Table 14-4.

The grade estimation process consisted of a 3-pass approach with the parameters of the first 
pass as presented in Table 14-4. The estimation parameters of the second and third passes are 
the same, with the exception of an enlarged search ellipsoid by 1.5 times and 3.0 times, 
respectively, of the dimensions from the first pass. 

14.1.10 Validation of Grade Estimates 

Validation tests were carried out on the estimates to examine the possible presence of a bias 
and to quantify the level of smoothing/variability. 

14.1.10.1  Visual Inspection 

A visual inspection of the block estimates with the drill hole grades on plans, and northwest-
southeast cross-sections was performed as a first check of the estimates. Observations from 
stepping through the estimates along the different sections indicated that there was overall a 
good agreement between the drill hole grades and the estimates. The orientations of the 
estimated grades were also according to the projection angles defined by the search ellipsoid. An 
example of a northwest-southeast cross-sections of gold grade estimates is presented in Figure 
14-13. Additional cross-sections of the estimates for the 51 Zone can be found in Appendix A.

14.1.10.2  Global Bias Test 

The comparison of the average gold and silver grades from the declustered composites and the 
estimated block grades examines the possibility of a global bias of the estimates. As a guideline, 
a difference between the average gold and silver grades of more than ± 10% would indicate a 
significant over- or under-estimation of the block grades and the possible presence of a bias. It 
would be a sign of difficulties encountered in the estimation process and would require further 
investigation. Results of this average gold and silver grade comparison are presented in Table 
14-5.

and the block estimates are well within the limits of acceptability for the estimates categorized

as indicated+inferred.  

14.1.10.3  Local Bias Test 

A comparison of the grade from composites within a block with the estimated grade of that 
block provides an assessment of the estimation process close to measured data. Pairing of these 
grades on a scatterplot gives a statistical valuation of the estimates. It is anticipated that the 
estimated block grades should be similar to the composited grades within the block, however 
without being of exactly the same value. Thus, a high correlation coefficient will indicate 
satisfactory results in the interpolation process, while a medium to low correlation coefficient 
will be indicative of larger differences in the estimates and would suggest a further review of the 
interpolation process. Results from the pairing of composited and estimated grades within 
blocks pierced by a drill hole are presented in Table 14-6 for gold and silver of the 51 Zone.

14.1.10.4  Grade Profile Reproducibility 

The comparison of the grade profiles of the declustered composites with that of the estimates 
allows for a visual verification of an over- or under-estimation of the block estimates at the 
global and local scales. A qualitative assessment of the smoothing/variability of the estimates 
can also be observed from the plots. The output consists of three graphs displaying the average 
grade according to each of the coordinate axes (east, north, elevation). The ideal result is a grade 
profile from the estimates that follows that of the declustered composites along the three 
coordinate axes, in a way that the estimates have lower high-grade peaks than the composites, 
and higher low-grade peaks than the composites. A smoother grade profile for the estimates, 
from low to high grade areas, is also anticipated in order to reflect that these grades represent 
larger volumes than the composites. Grade profiles are presented in Figure 14-14 and Figure 
14-15 for gold and silver, respectively.

From the plots of Figure 14-14 and Figure 14-15, it can be seen that the grade profiles of the 
declustered composites are well reproduced by those of the block estimates and consequently 
that no global or local bias is observed. As anticipated, some smoothing of the block estimates 
can be seen in the profiles, where estimated grades are higher in lower grade areas and lower in 
higher grade areas.  

14.1.11 Resource Classification 

The mineral resource was classified as indicated, and inferred based on the variogram ranges of 
the second structure. The average distance of composites from the block center was utilized as 
the classification criterion. The classification distances for each category are provided in Table 
14-7.  

Table 14-7 Classification Distances of the 51 Zone

≤ 40m >40m 

The absence of measured resources stems from the uncertainty associated with some of the drill 
hole locations. 

14.1.12 Mineral Resource Calculation 

The mineral resource was calculated for 3m (X) x 3m (Y) x 3m (Z) blocks with a constant specific 
gravity (SG) value of 2.84. The tonnage calculation accounted for the block fraction within the 
mineralized zone's wireframe, as well as the block fraction below the topography surface. The

Zone. A total of 2,177 Au and Ag assays are located within the 4 veins that make up the 04 Zone. 
The A Vein is intersected by 99 holes with 1,177 Au and Ag assays, the B Vein by 74 holes with 
602 assays, the Hanging Wall Vein by 86 holes with 306 assays, and the Footwall Vein by 17 holes 
with 92 assays. All missing samples were replaced with a 0.0 g/t value for gold and silver. 

14.2.2 Location, Orientation, and Spacing of Drill Holes 

The location of the drill holes is presented in Figure 14-16 for the 04 Zone. As seen in this Figure, 
although most of the drill holes are located within the area of interest, drill holes in surrounding 
areas are also observed. The latter are however not part of the estimate of the 04 Zone. 
Statistics on drill hole spacing indicate an overall average distance of 21.0m and median of 
17.5m for the 4 mineralized veins of the 04 Zone. For the individual veins, the average drill 
spacing and median spacing of the A Vein is 19.8m and 16.6m, for the B Vein the average and 
median spacings are 22.5m and 17.2m, for the Hanging Wall Vein they are 23.7m and 17.1m, 
and for the Footwall Vein the average and median spacings are 24.7m and 23.7m.  

With regard to the orientation of the drill holes, a single orientation along a 315°-330° azimuth 
with dips varying between -30° to -65° are observed for the 04 Zone. Figure 14-17, which 
represents the bottom half of a sphere, displays the azimuth and dip angles of the drill holes for 
the 04 Zone.

14.2.3 Geologic Modeling 

The control on mineralization of the 04 Zone consists of four parallel shear zones associated with 
a graphitic schist unit. These vein-type orebodies are oriented at an azimuth of approximately 
50° and dipping at approximately 60° to the southeast. The modeling process comprises of the 
interpretation of geologic units in combination with the gold and silver grades. These 
interpretations were digitized and snapped to drill holes on northwest-southeast sections, and 
then linked together in 3-D as wireframes in the Vulcan® software (Figure 14-18 and Figure 
14-19).

14.2.4 Compositing 

The samples of the 04 Zone show that 43% of them are 0.9m long and 15% are 0.7m long. The 
original sample lengths of gold and silver assays were composited to regular 1.0m intervals for 
each hole. The 1.0m composite length preserves the intrinsic variability of the original samples 
and provides a good fit with the envisioned block size for the block model of grade estimates 
(3mx3mx3m), providing a 3:1 ratio of block height to composite length. The compositing process 
starts at the drill hole collar down to the hanging wall of the first vein, then a new compositing 
begins at the hanging wall down to the footwall of the first vein, and another compositing starts 
from the footwall of the first vein down to the hanging wall of the second vein. This process is 
repeated for the second, third, and fourth vein, with a final compositing starting at the footwall

of the fourth vein down to the end of the drill hole. A total of 2,212 composites were generated 
from 101 holes.  

14.2.5 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

A set of various statistical applications was utilized to provide a better understanding of the gold 
and silver grade populations within the mineralized zone.  

14.2.5.1 Bivariate Statistics 

A scatterplot was generated to examine the possible relationship of gold with silver within the 
04 Zone deposit. As seen in Figure 14-21, there is a moderate correlation between gold and 
silver, with a correlation coefficient of 0.674.

14.2.5.2 Univariate Statistics 

Basic statistics were performed on the gold and silver grades of the 1.0m composites. 
Histograms and probability plots indicated that the gold and silver grade distributions resemble 
positively skewed lognormal populations. Basic statistics results are presented as boxplots in 
Figure 14-22 for gold and in Figure 14-23 for silver. As seen in these Figures, the gold and silver 
grade populations for 3 of the veins are fairly well behaved with coefficients of variation (CV) 
lesser than 3.0. The population of the Hanging Wall Vein is more heterogeneous with a CVs 
above 3.0. It can also be observed that the A Vein has the highest average gold grade followed 
by the B Vein, Hanging Wall Vein, and Footwall Vein. The A Vein has also the highest average 
silver grade, followed by the B Vein, Footwall Vein, and Hanging Wall Vein.

Gold and silver assays were also examined on a drill hole basis for various elevated grade cut-
offs, where the number of samples above various cut-offs, the highest grades, and the distance 
to the nearest hole were computed on a per drill hole basis. As seen in Figure 14-24, holes with 
the highest gold intercepts in the 04 Zone are PB88-249, PB77-038W, CR04-12, and CR03-03. 
From Figure 14-25, the holes with the highest silver intercepts in the 04 Zone are PB87-198, 
PB88-249, PB88-242, PB77-038W, and PB87-207. The statistics calculated in these Figures can 
also be useful to detect the presence of isolated higher grades. In such case, difficulties during 
grade estimation could occur due to a greater generation of higher grade blocks in this area. 
After inspection of the average distances away from the closest hole and the maximum grades 
reported in Figure 14-24 and Figure 14-25, it was concluded that no isolated hole(s) with high-
grade values are present, and for such no related difficulties in the grade estimation process is 
anticipated.

14.2.6 Capping of High-Grade Outliers 

It is common practice to statistically examine the higher grades within a population and to trim 
them to a lower grade value based on the results from specific statistical utilities. This procedure 
is performed on high-grade values that are considered outliers and that cannot be related to any 
geologic feature. In the case of the 04 Zone, the gold and silver higher grades were examined 
with two different tools: the probability plot, and the cutting statistics utility. The usage of 
various investigating methods allows for a selection of the capping threshold in a more objective 
and justified manner. For the probability plot method, the capping value is chosen at the 
location where higher grades depart from the main distribution. For the cutting statistics utility, 
the selection of the capping value is identified at the cut-off grade where there is no correlation 
between the grades above this cut-off. The resulting compilation of the capping thresholds for

gold and silver of each of the 4 veins is listed in Table 14-10 for gold and silver. One of the 
objectives of the capping strategy is to have less than 10% of the metal affected by the capping 
process. A larger percentage of affected metal was observed for the Footwall Vein where few 
high-grade outliers carry a large percentage of the metal content for this unit.

Basic statistics were re-computed with the gold and silver grades capped to the thresholds listed

Figure 14-27 Boxplots of Capped Silver Composites – 04 Zone 

It can be observed from those Figures that the coefficients of variation were further reduced for 
the gold and silver grade populations. The effect of the capping of higher gold and silver grade 
outliers has reduced the overall average gold grade by 4.3% and reduced the overall average 
silver grade by 5.8%.  

Because of the generally low coefficients of variation for gold and silver grade populations, 
displaying fairly good grade homogeneity, it can be concluded that there is no need to treat the 
higher grade composites differently than the lower grade composites during the estimation 
process. Ordinary kriging is thus a well suited estimation technique in this case. 

14.2.7 Declustering 

In general, there is a tendency to drill more holes in higher grade areas than in lower grade areas 
when delimiting an orebody. As a result, the higher grade portion of a deposit will be overly 
represented and would translate into a bias towards the higher grades when calculating 
statistical parameters of the population. Thus, a declustering method is utilized to generate a 
more representative set of statistical results within the zone of interest. In this case, a polygonal 
declustering technique was applied to the composites of the 04 Zone. This approach consists of 
assigning the volume of a polygon, defined by the halfway distance between a sample and its 
surrounding neighbours, as a weight for each sample within the mineralized zone. Therefore, a 
sample that is isolated will have a larger weight than a sample located in a densely sampled area.

declustered gold and silver averages shows a consistent reduction of the grade averages 
resulting from the declustering process. This outcome confirms the occurrence of a clustering in 
the higher grade areas for the three zones. A reduction of 25.1% of the mean gold grade and a 
reduction of 19.6% of the mean silver grade are noted.  

The average grade from the declustered statistics provides an excellent comparison with the 
average grade of the interpolated blocks, as a way to assess any overall bias of the estimates.  

14.2.8 Variography 

A variographic analysis was carried out on the gold and silver composites within the different 
veins of the 04 Zone. The objective of this analysis was to spatially establish the preferred 
directions of gold and silver grade continuity. In turn, the variograms modeled along those 
directions would be later utilized to select and weigh the composites during the block grade 
interpolation process. For this exercise, all experimental variograms were of the type relative lag 
pairwise, which is considered robust for the assessment of gold and silver grade continuity.  

Variogram maps were first calculated to examine general gold and silver grade continuities in the 
XY, XZ, and YZ planes. The next step undertaken was to compute omni-directional variograms 
and down-hole variograms. The omni-directional variograms are calculated without any 
directional restrictions and provide a good assessment of the sill of the variogram. As for the 
down-hole variogram, it is calculated with the composites of each hole along the trace of the 
hole. The objective of these calculations is to provide information about the short scale structure 
of the variogram, as the composites are more closely spaced down the hole. Thus, the modeling 
of the nugget effect is usually better derived from the down-hole variograms. 

Directional variograms were then computed to identify more specifically the three main 
directions of continuity. A first set of variograms were produced in the horizontal plane at 
increments of 10 degrees. In the same way a second set of variograms were computed at 10° 
increments in the vertical plane of the horizontal direction of continuity (plunge direction). A 
final set of variograms at 10° increments were calculated in the vertical plane perpendicular to 
the horizontal direction of continuity (dip direction). The final variograms were then modeled 
with a 2-structure spherical variogram, and resulting parameters presented in Table 14-11 for 
gold and silver.  

The directions of gold and silver grade continuity are in agreement with the orientation of the 
mineralized zone. At the 04 Zone, the orientations of greater continuity are trending to the 
northeast along strike and to the southeast down-dip. The modeled variograms have relatively 
low nugget effects with values ranging from 11.0% to 13.5% of the sill for gold, and nugget effect 
values ranging from 8.0% to 23.3% of the sill for silver. The experimental variograms are 
considered of good quality for the along strike and down-dip directions, however, for the across 
strike and dip direction, few composites are available. Inconclusive variograms were observed 
for the Footwall Vein due to the few available composites and for such, the variogram model 
from the Hanging Wall Vein was assigned to this unit.

14.2.9 Gold and Silver Grade Estimation 

The estimation of gold and silver grades into a block model was carried out with the ordinary 
kriging technique. The estimation strategy and parameters were tailored to account for the 
various geometrical, geological, and geostatistical characteristics previously identified. The 
database of 1.0m capped gold and silver grade composites was utilized as input for the grade 
interpolation process.  

The grid definition of the block model is presented in Table 14-12. It should be noted that the 
origin of the block model corresponds to the lower left corner, the point of origin being the 
exterior edges of the first block. The block model is oriented according to a reference grid 
provided by Nordmin. A block size of 3m (easting) x 3m (northing) x 3m (elevation) was selected 
to better reflect the orebodies' geometrical configuration and anticipated open pit / 
underground production rate. The block model is rotated with its X axis oriented along an 
azimuth of 51°.

The size and orientation of the search ellipsoid for the estimation process was based on the 
variogram parameters modeled for gold and silver. For the across strike and dip direction, the 
parameters from the down-the-hole variogram were utilized, due to the restricted number of 
composites available along this direction. No other restrictions, such as a minimum number of 
informed octants, a minimum number of holes, a maximum number of samples per hole, etc., 
were applied to the estimation process. Further details of the estimation parameters are 
presented in Table 14-13.

The grade estimation process consisted of a 3-pass approach with the parameters of the first 
pass as presented in Table 14-13. The estimation parameters of the second and third passes are 
the same, with the exception of an enlarged search ellipsoid by 1.5 times and 3.0 times, 
respectively, of the dimensions from the first pass. 

14.2.10 Validation of Grade Estimates 

Validation tests were carried out on the estimates to examine the possible presence of a bias 
and to quantify the level of smoothing/variability. 

14.2.10.1  Visual Inspection 

A visual inspection of the block estimates with the drill hole grades on plans, and northwest-
southeast cross-sections was performed as a first check of the estimates. Observations from 
stepping through the estimates along the different sections indicated that there was overall a 
good agreement between the drill hole grades and the estimates. The orientations of the 
estimated grades were also according to the projection angles defined by the search ellipsoid. An 
example of a northwest-southeast cross-sections of gold grade estimates is presented in Figure 
14-28. Additional cross-sections of the estimates for the 04 Zone can be found in Appendix A.

14.2.10.2  Global Bias Test 

The comparison of the average gold and silver grades from the declustered composites and the 
estimated block grades examines the possibility of a global bias of the estimates. As a guideline, 
a difference between the average gold and silver grades of more than ± 10% would indicate a 
significant over- or under-estimation of the block grades and the possible presence of a bias. It 
would be a sign of difficulties encountered in the estimation process and would require further 
investigation. Results of this average gold and silver grade comparison are presented in Table 
14-14.

As seen in Table 14-14, the average gold and silver grades between the declustered composites 
and the block estimates are within or slightly lower than the limits of the tolerance levels of 
acceptability for the estimates classified as indicated and indicated + inferred.  

14.2.10.3  Local Bias Test 

A comparison of the grade from composites within a block with the estimated grade of that 
block provides an assessment of the estimation process close to measured data. Pairing of these 
grades on a scatterplot gives a statistical valuation of the estimates. It is anticipated that the 
estimated block grades should be similar to the composited grades within the block, however 
without being of exactly the same value. Thus, a high correlation coefficient will indicate 
satisfactory results in the interpolation process, while a medium to low correlation coefficient 
will be indicative of larger differences in the estimates and would suggest a further review of the 
interpolation process. Results from the pairing of composited and estimated grades within 
blocks pierced by a drill hole are presented in Table 14-15 for gold and silver of the 04 Zone.

As seen in Table 14-15 for both gold and silver, the block grade estimates are very similar to the 
composite grades within blocks pierced by a drill hole, with high correlation coefficients, 
indicating satisfactory results from the estimation process.  

14.2.10.4  Grade Profile Reproducibility 

The comparison of the grade profiles of the declustered composites with that of the estimates 
allows for a visual verification of an over- or under-estimation of the block estimates at the 
global and local scales. A qualitative assessment of the smoothing/variability of the estimates 
can also be observed from the plots. The output consists of three graphs displaying the average 
grade according to each of the coordinate axes (east, north, elevation). The ideal result is a grade 
profile from the estimates that follows that of the declustered composites along the three 
coordinate axes, in a way that the estimates have lower high-grade peaks than the composites, 
and higher low-grade peaks than the composites. A smoother grade profile for the estimates, 
from low to high grade areas, is also anticipated in order to reflect that these grades represent 
larger volumes than the composites. Grade profiles are presented in Figure 14-29 and Figure 
14-30 for gold and silver, respectively.

From the plots of Figure 14-29 and Figure 14-30 it can be seen that the grade profiles of the 
declustered composites are well reproduced by those of the block estimates and consequently 
that no global or local bias is observed. As anticipated, some smoothing of the block estimates 
can be seen in the profiles, where estimated grades are higher in lower grade areas and lower in 
higher grade areas.  

14.2.11 Resource Classification 

The mineral resource was classified as indicated, and inferred based on the variogram ranges of 
the second structure. The average distance of composites from the block center was utilized as 
the classification criterion. The classification distances for each category are provided in Table 
14-16.

The absence of measured resources stems from the uncertainty associated with some of the drill 
hole locations. As well the absence of indicated resources for the Footwall Vein is due to the few 
drill hole intercepts within this unit, reflecting a greater uncertainty. 

14.2.12 Mineral Resource Calculation 

The mineral resource was calculated for 3m (X) x 3m (Y) x 3m (Z) blocks with a constant specific 
gravity (SG) value of 2.84. The tonnage calculation accounted for the block fraction within the 
mineralized zones' wireframes, as well as the block fraction below the topography surface. The 
indicated, and inferred mineral resources at various gold grade cut-offs are presented in Table

14.3 41 Zone 

14.3.1 Drill Hole Data  

The drill hole database is made of 63 holes intersecting the mineralized orebodies of the 41 
Zone. A total of 2,168 Au and Ag assays are located within the 3 types of mineralized zones that 
make up the 41 Zone. The Veins orebodies have 61 holes with 1,016 Au and Ag assays, the 
Chloritic Schist zone has 55 holes with 446 assays, and the Graphitic Schist zone has 58 holes 
with 706 assays. All missing samples were replaced with a 0.0 g/t value for gold and silver. 

14.3.2 Location, Orientation, and Spacing of Drill Holes 

The location of the drill holes is presented in Figure 14-31 for the 41 Zone. As seen in this Figure, 
although most of the drill holes are located within the area of interest, drill holes in surrounding 
areas are also observed. The latter are however not part of the estimate of the 41 Zone. 
Statistics on drill hole spacing indicate an overall average distance of 16.4m and median of 
14.1m for the 3 mineralized zones of the 41 Zone. For the individual zones, the average drill 
spacing and median spacing of the Veins is 15.2m and 13.3m, for the Graphitic Schist the average 
and median spacings are 21.0m and 16.7m, and for the Graphitic Schist they are 17.3m and 
16.0m. 

With regard to the orientation of the drill holes, a single orientation along a 315°-330° azimuth 
with dips varying between -30° to -65° are observed at the 41 Zone. Figure 14-32, which 
represents the bottom half of a sphere, displays the azimuth and dip angles of the drill holes for 
the 41 Zone.

14.3.3 Geologic Modeling 

The controls on mineralization of the 41 Zone consist of 3 types of mineralized orebodies: a set 
of parallel veins made of 2 larger veins and 7 smaller veins, a chloritic schist located on the 
periphery of the mineralized area, and a graphitic schist located in the core of the mineralized 
area. These mineralized units are oriented at an azimuth of approximately 50° and dipping at 
approximately 60° to the southeast. The modeling process comprises of the interpretation of 
geologic units in combination with the gold and silver grades. These interpretations were 
snapped to drill holes and then linked together in 3-D as wireframes in the Leapfrog® software 
(Figure 14-33 and Figure 14-34).

14.3.4 Compositing 

The samples of the 41 Zone show that 24% of them are 0.9m long and 20% are 1.5m long. The 
original sample lengths of gold and silver assays were composited to regular 1.0m intervals for 
each hole. The 1.0m composite length preserves the intrinsic variability of the original samples 
and provides a good fit with the envisioned block size for the block model of grade estimates 
(3mx3mx3m), providing a 3:1 ratio of block height to composite length. The compositing process 
starts at the drill hole collar down to the hanging wall of the first orebody encountered, then a 
new compositing begins at the hanging wall down to the footwall of this first orebody, and 
another compositing starts from the footwall of the orebody down to the hanging wall of the 
next orebody. This process is repeated for all the modeled orebodies encountered along each 
hole. A total of 2,438 composites were generated from 63 holes.

14.3.5 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

A set of various statistical applications was utilized to provide a better understanding of the gold 
and silver grade populations within the mineralized zone.  

14.3.5.1 Bivariate Statistics 

A scatterplot was generated to examine the possible relationship of gold with silver within the 
41 Zone deposit. As seen in Figure 14-36, there is a strong correlation between gold and silver, 
with a correlation coefficient of 0.766.  

 

Figure 14-36 Bivariate Statistics of Gold and Silver Grades of the 41 Zone. 

14.3.5.2 Univariate Statistics 

Basic statistics were performed on the gold and silver grades of the 1.0m composites. 
Histograms and probability plots indicated that the gold and silver grade distributions resemble 
positively skewed lognormal populations. Basic statistics results are presented as boxplots in 
Figure 14-37 for gold and in Figure 14-38 for silver. As seen in these Figures, the gold and silver 
grade populations of the Veins are rather well behaved with coefficients of variation (CV) lesser 
than 3.0. The populations of the Chloritic Schist and Graphitic Schist are more heterogeneous 
with CVs above 3.0. It can also be observed that the Veins unit has the highest average gold 
grade followed by the Graphitic Schist and the Chloritic Schist. The Vein unit also has the highest

Gold and silver assays were also examined on a drill hole basis for various elevated grade cut-
offs, where the number of samples above various cut-offs, the highest grades, and the distance 
to the nearest hole were computed on a per drill hole basis. As seen in Figure 14-39, holes with 
the highest gold intercepts in the 41 Zone are PB89-344, PB87-147, and PB80-163. From Figure 
14-40, the holes with the highest silver intercepts in the 41 Zone are PB89-344, PB78-059, and 
CR16-42. The statistics calculated in these Figures can also be useful to detect the presence of 
isolated higher grades. In such case, difficulties during grade estimation could occur due to a 
greater generation of higher grade blocks in this area. After inspection of the average distances 
away from the closest hole and the maximum grades reported in Figure 14-39 and Figure 14-40, 
it was concluded that no isolated hole(s) with high-grade values are present, and for such no 
related difficulties in the grade estimation process is anticipated.

14.3.6 Capping of High-Grade Outliers 

It is common practice to statistically examine the higher grades within a population and to trim 
them to a lower grade value based on the results from specific statistical utilities. This procedure 
is performed on high-grade values that are considered outliers and that cannot be related to any 
geologic feature. In the case of the 41 Zone, the gold and silver higher grades were examined 
with two different tools: the probability plot, and the cutting statistics utility. The usage of 
various investigating methods allows for a selection of the capping threshold in a more objective 
and justified manner. For the probability plot method, the capping value is chosen at the 
location where higher grades depart from the main distribution. For the cutting statistics utility, 
the selection of the capping value is identified at the cut-off grade where there is no correlation 
between the grades above this cut-off. The resulting compilation of the capping thresholds for

gold and silver of each of the 2 mineralized units is listed in Table 14-19 for gold and silver. One 
of the objectives of the capping strategy is to have less than 10% of the metal affected by the 
capping process. A larger percentage of affected metal was observed for the combined Chloritic 
and Graphitic Schists, where few high-grade outliers carry a large percentage of the metal 
content of this unit.

Figure 14-42 Boxplots of Capped Silver Composites – 41 Zone 

It can be observed from those Figures that the coefficients of variation were further reduced for 
the gold and silver grade populations. For the Veins unit the CVs are below 3.0, while the CV of 
the Schists unit remains above 3.0, displaying greater heterogeneity even after the capping of 
high-grade outliers. The effect of the capping of higher gold and silver grade outliers has reduced 
the overall average gold grade by 2.6% and reduced the overall average silver grade by 2.2%.  

Because of the generally low coefficients of variation for gold and silver grade populations of the 
Veins unit, displaying fairly good grade homogeneity, it can be concluded that there is no need 
to treat the higher grade composites differently than the lower grade composites during the 
estimation process. Ordinary kriging is thus a well suited estimation technique in this case. For 
the Schists unit, which displays a higher level of heterogeneity, a similar estimation strategy is 
planned based on the fact that it is a unit with a lesser impact on the mineral resources. 

14.3.7 Declustering 

In general, there is a tendency to drill more holes in higher grade areas than in lower grade areas 
when delimiting an orebody. As a result, the higher grade portion of a deposit will be overly 
represented and would translate into a bias towards the higher grades when calculating 
statistical parameters of the population. Thus, a declustering method is utilized to generate a 
more representative set of statistical results within the zone of interest. In this case, a polygonal 
declustering technique was applied to the composites of the 41 Zone. This approach consists of 
assigning the volume of a polygon, defined by the halfway distance between a sample and its 
surrounding neighbours, as a weight for each sample within the mineralized zone. Therefore, a

sample that is isolated will have a larger weight than a sample located in a densely sampled area.  

Comparison of average gold and silver capped and declustered grades with the capped and un-
declustered gold and silver averages shows a consistent reduction of the grade averages 
resulting from the declustering process. This outcome confirms the occurrence of a clustering in 
the higher gold grade areas for the three mineralized zones. Thus a reduction of 6.7% of the 
mean gold grade and an increase of 7.1% of the mean silver grade are noted.  

The average grade from the declustered statistics provides an excellent comparison with the 
average grade of the interpolated blocks, as a way to assess any overall bias of the estimates.  

14.3.8 Variography 

A variographic analysis was carried out on the gold and silver composites within the different 
units of the 41 Zone. The objective of this analysis was to spatially establish the preferred 
directions of gold and silver grade continuity. In turn, the variograms modeled along those 
directions would be later utilized to select and weigh the composites during the block grade 
interpolation process. For this exercise, all experimental variograms were of the type relative lag 
pairwise, which is considered robust for the assessment of gold and silver grade continuity.  

Variogram maps were first calculated to examine general gold and silver grade continuities in the 
XY, XZ, and YZ planes. The next step undertaken was to compute omni-directional variograms 
and down-hole variograms. The omni-directional variograms are calculated without any 
directional restrictions and provide a good assessment of the sill of the variogram. As for the 
down-hole variogram, it is calculated with the composites of each hole along the trace of the 
hole. The objective of these calculations is to provide information about the short scale structure 
of the variogram, as the composites are more closely spaced down the hole. Thus, the modeling 
of the nugget effect is usually better derived from the down-hole variograms. 

Directional variograms were then computed to identify more specifically the three main 
directions of continuity. A first set of variograms were produced in the horizontal plane at 
increments of 10 degrees. In the same way a second set of variograms were computed at 10° 
increments in the vertical plane of the horizontal direction of continuity (plunge direction). A 
final set of variograms at 10° increments were calculated in the vertical plane perpendicular to 
the horizontal direction of continuity (dip direction). The final variograms were then modeled 
with a 2-structure spherical variogram, and resulting parameters presented in Table 14-20 for 
gold and silver.

The directions of gold and silver grade continuity are in agreement with the orientation of the 
mineralized zone. For the 41 Zone, the orientations of greater continuity are trending to the 
northeast along strike with a plunge to the southwest and to the southeast down-dip. The 
modeled variograms have relatively low nugget effects with values ranging from 19.1% to 22.2% 
of the sill for gold, and ranging from 19.1% to 23.3% of the sill for silver. The experimental 
variograms are considered of good quality for the along strike and down-dip directions, 
however, for the across strike and dip direction, few composites are available. The variogram 
analysis was conducted on the Veins unit and the combined Chloritic and Graphitic Schist units.  

14.3.9 Gold and Silver Grade Estimation 

The estimation of gold and silver grades into a block model was carried out with the ordinary 
kriging technique. The estimation strategy and parameters were tailored to account for the 
various geometrical, geological, and geostatistical characteristics previously identified. The 
database of 1.0m capped gold and silver grade composites was utilized as input for the grade 
interpolation process.  

The grid definition of the block model is presented in Table 14-21. It should be noted that the 
origin of the block model corresponds to the lower left corner, the point of origin being the 
exterior edges of the first block. The block model is oriented according to a reference grid 
provided by Nordmin. A block size of 3m (easting) x 3m (northing) x 3m (elevation) was selected 
to better reflect the orebodies' geometrical configuration and anticipated open pit / 
underground production rate. The block model is rotated with its X axis oriented along an 
azimuth of 51°.

The size and orientation of the search ellipsoid for the estimation process was based on the 
variogram parameters modeled for gold and silver. For the across strike and dip direction, the 
parameters from the down-the-hole variogram were utilized, due to the restricted number of 
composites available along this direction. No other restrictions, such as a minimum number of 
informed octants, a minimum number of holes, a maximum number of samples per hole, etc., 
were applied to the estimation process. Further details of the estimation parameters are 
presented in Table 14-22.

The grade estimation process consisted of a 3-pass approach with the parameters of the first 
pass as presented in Table 14-22. The estimation parameters of the second and third passes are 
the same, with the exception of an enlarged search ellipsoid by 1.5 times and 3.0 times, 
respectively, of the dimensions from the first pass. 

14.3.10 Validation of Grade Estimates 

Validation tests were carried out on the estimates to examine the possible presence of a bias 
and to quantify the level of smoothing/variability.  

14.3.10.1  Visual Inspection 

A visual inspection of the block estimates with the drill hole grades on plans, and northwest-
southeast cross-sections was performed as a first check of the estimates. Observations from 
stepping through the estimates along the different planes indicated that there was overall a 
good agreement between the drill hole grades and the estimates. The orientations of the

estimated grades were also according to the projection angles defined by the search ellipsoid. An 
example of a northwest-southeast cross-sections of gold grade estimates is presented in Figure 
14-43. Additional cross-sections of the estimates for the 41 Zone can be found in Appendix A.

14.3.10.2  Global Bias Test 

The comparison of the average gold and silver grades from the declustered composites and the 
estimated block grades examines the possibility of a global bias of the estimates. As a guideline, 
a difference between the average gold and silver grades of more than ± 10% would indicate a 
significant over- or under-estimation of the block grades and the possible presence of a bias. It 
would be a sign of difficulties encountered in the estimation process and would require further 
investigation. Results of this average gold and silver grade comparison are presented in Table 
14-23.

As seen in Table 14-23, the average gold and silver grades between the declustered composites 
and the block estimates are within the tolerance limits of acceptability for the Veins and Schists 
estimates, except for the silver grade estimates of the Veins unit.  

14.3.10.3  Local Bias Test 

A comparison of the grade from composites within a block with the estimated grade of that 
block provides an assessment of the estimation process close to measured data. Pairing of these 
grades on a scatterplot gives a statistical valuation of the estimates. It is anticipated that the 
estimated block grades should be similar to the composited grades within the block, however 
without being of exactly the same value. Thus, a high correlation coefficient will indicate 
satisfactory results in the interpolation process, while a medium to low correlation coefficient 
will be indicative of larger differences in the estimates and would suggest a further review of the 
interpolation process. Results from the pairing of composited and estimated grades within 
blocks pierced by a drill hole are presented in Table 14-24 for gold and silver of the 41 Zone.

14.3.10.4  Grade Profile Reproducibility 

The comparison of the grade profiles of the declustered composites with that of the estimates 
allows for a visual verification of an over- or under-estimation of the block estimates at the 
global and local scales. A qualitative assessment of the smoothing/variability of the estimates 
can also be observed from the plots. The output consists of three graphs displaying the average 
grade according to each of the coordinate axes (east, north, elevation). The ideal result is a grade 
profile from the estimates that follows that of the declustered composites along the three 
coordinate axes, in a way that the estimates have lower high-grade peaks than the composites, 
and higher low-grade peaks than the composites. A smoother grade profile for the estimates, 
from low to high grade areas, is also anticipated in order to reflect that these grades represent 
larger volumes than the composites. Grade profiles of the Veins unit are presented in Figure 
14-44 and Figure 14-45 for gold and silver, respectively.

From the plots of Figures 14.39 and 14.40, it can be seen that the grade profiles of the 
declustered composites are well reproduced by those of the block estimates and consequently 
that no global or local bias is observed. As anticipated, some smoothing of the block estimates 
can be seen in the profiles, where estimated grades are higher in lower grade areas and lower in 
higher grade areas.  

14.3.11 Resource Classification 

The mineral resource was classified as indicated, and inferred based on the variogram ranges of 
the second structure. The average distance of composites from the block center was utilized as 
the classification criterion. The classification distances for each category are provided in Table 
14-25.

from Block Center) 

Unit Indicated Inferred 

Veins ≤ 40m >40m 

Chloritic+Graphitic Schists ≤ 40m ≥ 40m 

 

The absence of measured resources stems from the uncertainty associated with some of the drill 
hole locations.  

14.3.12  Mineral Resource Calculation 

The mineral resource was calculated for 3m (X) x 3m (Y) x 3m (Z) blocks with a constant specific 
gravity (SG) value of 2.84. The tonnage calculation accounted for the block fraction within the 
mineralized zones' wireframes, as well as the block fraction below the topography surface. The 
indicated, and inferred mineral resources at various gold grade cut-offs are presented in Table 
14-26.

1. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic 
viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resources estimated will 
be converted into Mineral Reserves. The estimate of Mineral Resources may be 
materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, 
marketing, or other relevant issues 

2. The CIM definitions were followed for the classification of Indicated, and Inferred mineral 
resources. 

3. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Resources in this estimation are uncertain in 
nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Resources as 
an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource. It is reasonably expected that a portion of 
inferred mineral resources could be upgraded with continued exploration. 

14.4 Windowglass Hill 

14.4.1 Drill Hole Data  

The drill hole database is made of 48 holes intersecting the mineralized orebodies of the 
Windowglass Hill deposit. A total of 1,182 Au and Ag assays are located within the 3 mineralized 
zones that make up the Windowglass Hill deposit. The Fault Block 1 zone has 19 holes with 377 
Au and Ag assays, the Fault Block 2 zone has 26 holes with 531 assays, and the Fault Block 3 zone 
has 16 holes with 274 assays. All missing samples were replaced with a 0.0 g/t value for gold and 
silver.

14.4.2 Location, Orientation, and Spacing of Drill Holes 

The location of the drill holes is presented in Figure 14-46 for the Windowglass Hill deposit. As 
seen in this Figure, although most of the drill holes are located within the area of interest, drill 
holes in surrounding areas are also observed. The latter are however not part of the estimate of 
the Windowglass Hill deposit. Statistics on drill hole spacing indicate an overall average distance 
of 32.1m and median of 28.0m for the 3 mineralized zones of the Windowglass Hill deposit. For 
the individual zones, the average drill spacing and median spacing of the Fault Block 1 is 40.5m 
and 35.8m, for the Fault Block 2 the average and median spacings are 28.3m and 20.0m, and for 
the Fault Block 3 they are 30.6m and 16.4m. 

With regard to the orientation of the drill holes, various orientations are observed with 4 main 
directions; 50°-55° azimuth, 70°-90° azimuth, 120°-140° azimuth, and 320°-325° azimuth. Dips 
vary from -30° to -90°. Figure 14-47, which represents the bottom half of a sphere, displays the 
azimuth and dip angles of the drill holes for the Windowglass Hill deposit.

14.4.3 Geologic Modeling 

The control on mineralization at the Windowglass Hill deposit consists of 3 main orebodies: Fault 
Block 1, Fault Block 2, and Fault Block 3. Fault Block 1 is located at the bottom eastern half of the 
area of interest, while Fault Block 2 is located at the top eastern half on top of Fault Block 1, and 
Fault Block 3 occupies the western half of the mineralized area. A NW-SE fault separates Fault 
Block 3 from Fault Blocks 1 and 2. This fault is oriented at an azimuth of 149° dipping at an angle 
of -60° to the southwest. The modeling process comprises of the interpretation of geologic units 
in combination with the gold and silver grades. These interpretations were snapped to drill 
holes, and then linked together in 3-D as wireframes in the Leapfrog® software (Figure 14-48 and 
Figure 14-49).

14.4.4 Compositing 

The samples of the Windowglass Hill deposit show that 17% of them are 0.9m long and 19% are 
1.5m long. The original sample lengths of gold and silver assays were composited to regular 1.0m 
intervals for each hole. The 1.0m composite length preserves the intrinsic variability of the 
original samples and provides a good fit with the envisioned block size for the block model of 
grade estimates (3mx3mx3m), providing a 3:1 ratio of block height to composite length. The 
compositing process starts at the drill hole collar down to the upper contact of the mineralized 
fault block, then a new compositing starts at the top of the fault block down to the lower contact 
of the fault block. Once outside the fault block, a new compositing begins to the end of the drill 
hole. A total of 1,101 composites were generated from 48 holes.  

14.4.5 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

A set of various statistical applications was utilized to provide a better understanding of the gold 
and silver grade populations within the mineralized zone.

A scatterplot was generated to examine the possible relationship of gold with silver within the 
Windowglass Hill deposit. As seen in Figure 14-51, there is a weak to moderate correlation 
between gold and silver, with a correlation coefficient of 0.412.

14.4.5.2 Univariate Statistics 

Basic statistics were performed on the gold and silver grades of the 1.0m composites. 
Histograms and probability plots indicated that the gold and silver grade distributions resemble 
positively skewed lognormal populations. Basic statistics results are presented as boxplots in 
Figure 14-52 for gold and in Figure 14-53 for silver. As seen in these Figures, the gold and silver 
grade populations of the Fault Blocks are somewhat well behaved with coefficients of variation 
(CV) lesser than or slightly above 3.0. The gold populations of the Fault Block 2 unit are more 
heterogeneous with a CV slightly above 3.0. It can also be observed that the Fault Block 2 unit 
has the highest average gold grade followed by the Fault Block 1 and Fault Block 3 units. The 
Fault Block 1 unit has the highest average silver grade, followed by the Fault Block 2 and Fault 
Block 3 units. There are no anomalous gold or silver grades in the overburden unit and for such, 
it is considered barren.

Gold and silver assays were also examined on a drill hole basis for various elevated grade cut-
offs, where the number of samples above various cut-offs, the highest grades, and the distance 
to the nearest hole were computed on a per drill hole basis. As seen in Figure 14-54, holes with 
the highest gold intercepts in the Windowglass Hill area are PB87-221, PB87-237, and PB87-208. 
From Figure 14-55, the holes with the highest silver intercepts in the Windowglass Hill area are 
PB87-238, WGH-04-11, and PB87-206. The statistics calculated in these Figures can also be 
useful to detect the presence of isolated higher grades. In such case, difficulties during grade 
estimation could occur due to a greater generation of higher grade blocks in this area. After 
inspection of the average distances away from the closest hole and the maximum grades 
reported in Figure 14-54 and Figure 14-55, it was concluded that no isolated hole(s) with high-
grade values are present, and for such no related difficulties in the grade estimation process is 
anticipated.

14.4.6 Capping of High-Grade Outliers 

It is common practice to statistically examine the higher grades within a population and to trim 
them to a lower grade value based on the results from specific statistical utilities. This procedure 
is performed on high-grade values that are considered outliers and that cannot be related to any 
geologic feature. In the case of the Windowglass Hill deposit, the gold and silver higher grades 
were examined with two different tools: the probability plot, and the cutting statistics utility. The 
usage of various investigating methods allows for a selection of the capping threshold in a more 
objective and justified manner. For the probability plot method, the capping value is chosen at 
the location where higher grades depart from the main distribution. For the cutting statistics 
utility, the selection of the capping value is identified at the cut-off grade where there is no 
correlation between the grades above this cut-off. The resulting compilation of the capping

thresholds for gold and silver for the grouped mineralized fault blocks is listed in Table 14.28 for 
gold and silver. One of the objectives of the capping strategy is to have less than 10% of the 
metal affected by the capping process. As seen in Table 14-28, the capping of the high-grade 
outliers is less than 10% for both gold and silver.

Figure 14-57 Boxplots of Capped Silver Composites – Windowglass Hill 

It can be observed from those Figures that the coefficients of variation were further reduced for 
the gold and silver grade populations. The CVs of the Fault Block units are now all below 3.0. The 
effect of the capping of higher gold and silver grade outliers has reduced the overall average gold 
grade by 5.9% and reduced the overall average silver grade by 8.7%.  

Because of the generally low coefficients of variation for gold and silver grade populations of the 
Fault Block units, displaying fairly good grade homogeneity, it can be concluded that there is no 
need to treat the higher grade composites differently than the lower grade composites during 
the estimation process. Ordinary kriging is thus a well suited estimation technique in this case.  

14.4.7 Declustering 

In general, there is a tendency to drill more holes in higher grade areas than in lower grade areas 
when delimiting an orebody. As a result, the higher grade portion of a deposit will be overly 
represented and would translate into a bias towards the higher grades when calculating 
statistical parameters of the population. Thus, a declustering method is utilized to generate a 
more representative set of statistical results within the zone of interest. In this case, a polygonal 
declustering technique was applied to the composites of the Windowglass Hill deposit. This 
approach consists of assigning the volume of a polygon, defined by the halfway distance 
between a sample and its surrounding neighbours, as a weight for each sample within the 
mineralized zone. Therefore, a sample that is isolated will have a larger weight than a sample 
located in a densely sampled area.

Comparison of average gold and silver capped and declustered grades with the capped and un-
declustered gold and silver averages shows a consistent reduction of the grade averages 
resulting from the declustering process. This outcome confirms the occurrence of a clustering in 
the higher grade areas for the three zones. A reduction of 2.9% of the mean gold grade and a 
reduction of 7.4% of the mean silver grade are noted.  

The average grade from the declustered statistics provides an excellent comparison with the 
average grade of the interpolated blocks, as a way to assess any overall bias of the estimates.  

14.4.8 Variography 

A variographic analysis was carried out on the gold and silver composites within the different 
units of the Windowglass Hill deposit. The objective of this analysis was to spatially establish the 
preferred directions of gold and silver grade continuity. In turn, the variograms modeled along 
those directions would be later utilized to select and weigh the composites during the block 
grade interpolation process. For this exercise, all experimental variograms were of the type 
relative lag pairwise, which is considered robust for the assessment of gold and silver grade 
continuity.  

Variogram maps were first calculated to examine general gold and silver grade continuities in the 
XY, XZ, and YZ planes. The next step undertaken was to compute omni-directional variograms 
and down-hole variograms. The omni-directional variograms are calculated without any 
directional restrictions and provide a good assessment of the sill of the variogram. As for the 
down-hole variogram, it is calculated with the composites of each hole along the trace of the 
hole. The objective of these calculations is to provide information about the short scale structure 
of the variogram, as the composites are more closely spaced down the hole. Thus, the modeling 
of the nugget effect is usually better derived from the down-hole variograms. 

Directional variograms were then computed to identify more specifically the three main 
directions of continuity. A first set of variograms were produced in the horizontal plane at 
increments of 10 degrees. In the same way a second set of variograms were computed at 10° 
increments in the vertical plane of the horizontal direction of continuity (plunge direction). A 
final set of variograms at 10° increments were calculated in the vertical plane perpendicular to 
the horizontal direction of continuity (dip direction). The final variograms were then modeled 
with a 2-structure spherical variogram, and resulting parameters presented in Table 14-29 for 
gold and silver.  

The directions of gold and silver grade continuity are in agreement with the orientation of the 
mineralized zones. At the Windowglass Hill deposit, the orientations of greater continuity are 
trending to the northeast along strike and vertically. The modeled variograms have relatively low 
nugget effects with values of 17.1% of the sill for gold, and of 16.0% of the sill for silver. The 
experimental variograms are considered of good quality overall. Due to the few assays available 
in each Fault Block unit, the variogram analysis was conducted on the grouped Fault Block units 
1, 2, and 3.

14.4.9 Gold and Silver Grade Estimation 

The estimation of gold and silver grades into a block model was carried out with the ordinary 
kriging technique. The estimation strategy and parameters were tailored to account for the 
various geometrical, geological, and geostatistical characteristics previously identified. The 
database of 1.0m capped gold and silver grade composites was utilized as input for the grade 
interpolation process.  

The grid definition of the block model is presented in Table 14-30. It should be noted that the 
origin of the block model corresponds to the lower left corner, the point of origin being the 
exterior edges of the first block. The block model is oriented according to a reference grid 
provided by Nordmin. A block size of 3m (easting) x 3m (northing) x 3m (elevation) was selected 
to better reflect the orebodies' geometrical configuration and anticipated open pit / 
underground production rate. The block model is rotated with its X axis oriented along an 
azimuth of 51°.

The size and orientation of the search ellipsoid for the estimation process was based on the 
variogram parameters modeled for gold and silver. No other restrictions, such as a minimum 
number of informed octants, a minimum number of holes, a maximum number of samples per 
hole, etc., were applied to the estimation process. Further details of the estimation parameters 
are presented in Table 14-31.

The grade estimation process consisted of a 3-pass approach with the parameters of the first 
pass as presented in Table 14-31. The estimation parameters of the second and third passes are 
the same, with the exception of an enlarged search ellipsoid by 1.5 times and 3.0 times, 
respectively, of the dimensions from the first pass. 

14.4.10 Validation of Grade Estimates 

Validation tests were carried out on the estimates to examine the possible presence of a bias 
and to quantify the level of smoothing/variability. 

14.4.10.1  Visual Inspection 

A visual inspection of the block estimates with the drill hole grades on plans, and northwest-
southeast cross-sections was performed as a first check of the estimates. Observations from 
stepping through the estimates along the different planes indicated that there was overall a 
good agreement between the drill hole grades and the estimates. The orientations of the 
estimated grades were also according to the projection angles defined by the search ellipsoid. An 
example of a southwest-northeast cross-sections of gold grade estimates is presented in Figure 
14-58. Additional cross-sections of the estimates for the Windowglass Hill deposit can be found 
in Appendix A.

14.4.10.2  Global Bias Test 

The comparison of the average gold and silver grades from the declustered composites and the 
estimated block grades examines the possibility of a global bias of the estimates. As a guideline, 
a difference between the average gold and silver grades of more than ± 10% would indicate a 
significant over- or under-estimation of the block grades and the possible presence of a bias. It 
would be a sign of difficulties encountered in the estimation process and would require further 
investigation. Results of this average gold and silver grade comparison are presented in Table 
14-32.

and the block estimates are within the tolerance limits of acceptability. It is concluded that no 
overall bias is present in the gold and silver estimates.

14.4.10.3  Local Bias Test 

A comparison of the grade from composites within a block with the estimated grade of that 
block provides an assessment of the estimation process close to measured data. Pairing of these 
grades on a scatterplot gives a statistical valuation of the estimates. It is anticipated that the 
estimated block grades should be similar to the composited grades within the block, however 
without being of exactly the same value. Thus, a high correlation coefficient will indicate 
satisfactory results in the interpolation process, while a medium to low correlation coefficient 
will be indicative of larger differences in the estimates and would suggest a further review of the 
interpolation process. Results from the pairing of composited and estimated grades within 
blocks pierced by a drill hole are presented in Table 14-33 for gold and silver of the Windowglass 
Hill deposit.

As seen in Table 14-33 for both gold and silver, the block grade estimates are similar to the 
composite grades within blocks pierced by a drill hole, with high correlation coefficients, 
indicating satisfactory results from the estimation process.  

14.4.10.4  Grade Profile Reproducibility 

The comparison of the grade profiles of the declustered composites with that of the estimates 
allows for a visual verification of an over- or under-estimation of the block estimates at the 
global and local scales. A qualitative assessment of the smoothing/variability of the estimates 
can also be observed from the plots. The output consists of three graphs displaying the average 
grade according to each of the coordinate axes (east, north, elevation). The ideal result is a grade 
profile from the estimates that follows that of the declustered composites along the three 
coordinate axes, in a way that the estimates have lower high-grade peaks than the composites, 
and higher low-grade peaks than the composites. A smoother grade profile for the estimates, 
from low to high grade areas, is also anticipated in order to reflect that these grades represent 
larger volumes than the composites. Grade profiles of the Fault Block units are presented in 
Figure 14-59 for gold and Figure 14-60 for silver. It can be seen that the grade profiles of the 
declustered composites are well reproduced by those of the block estimates and consequently 
that no global or local bias is observed. As anticipated, some smoothing of the block estimates 
can be seen in the profiles, where estimated grades are higher in lower grade areas and lower in 
higher grade areas.

As seen in Figure 14-61 and Figure 14-62, there is an overlap in the block model limits between 
the 41 zone and the 04 Zone. Although this overlap in limits exists, care was taken to ensure that 
the mineralized orebodies of each zone did not overlap, in order to avoid any possibility of 
double accounting at the mineral resource reporting stage.

1. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no 
certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resources estimated will be converted into Mineral Reserves. The 
estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 
socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues 

2. The CIM definitions were followed for the classification of Indicated, and Inferred mineral resources. 
3. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there 

has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral 
Resource. It is reasonably expected that a portion of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded with 
continued exploration. 

14.6 Mineral Resource Comparison 

The previous mineral resource estimate dated September 8, 2015 is compared to the latest 
estimate of the mineral resources dated February 1, 2017 (Table 14-37).

As seen in Table 14-37, the current estimate of the indicated resource has a larger Au and Ag 
metal content with more tonnes at a lower grade. The current estimate of the inferred resource 
has a lesser Au and Ag metal content with more tonnes at a lower grade. 

These changes in the mineral resource estimates can be mainly attributed to a new 
interpretation of the mineralized orebodies in each of the zones examined, and to a different 
approach in the estimation methodology utilized for this update. The increase in indicated 
resources stems largely from the addition of indicated resources in the 51 Zone, which were all 
inferred in the previous estimate.  

14.7 Interpretations and Recommendations 

For this update of the mineral resources of the Cape Ray project, all aspects of the estimation 
procedures were re-visited. As such, a new interpretation of the mineralized orebodies was 
performed for each zone, as well as all statistical and geostatistical analyses were carried out 
from first principals.  

One element of importance observed in the resource estimation procedure is the setting of the 
un-assayed samples to a barren value (0.0 g/t). Some of these missing samples are located

within the mineralized solids along with higher grade assays. It is understood that the main 
reason for not having these samples assayed is that they were believed to be barren. Therefore, 
not accounting for them in the grade interpolation process will generate a higher grade 
estimate. 

A single SG value of 2.84 was utilized throughout the different zones evaluated. It is 
recommended that SG measurements be taken from drill holes in each orebody of each zone to 
ensure a proper assessment of the tonnage and metal content. The SG has a direct influence on 
these components and as an example, a difference of 10% on the SG value translates into a 10% 
difference on tonnage and total ounces. 

There is some uncertainty associated with the location of the older drill holes. To address this 
uncertainty, it is recommended to twin some of the older drill holes to provide a validation of 
the drill hole database and to advance the project to a higher level of confidence. Twinning some 
of the older holes that carry a greater portion of the resource would be a good starting point for 
this exercise. The drill holes mentioned in the "univariate statistics" sections of the report are 
good examples of holes that have a larger proportion of higher grade intercepts. 

It was observed that some of the drill holes ended before the mineralization horizon, especially 
in the 04 Zone where certain drill holes did not intercept the Footwall Zone. The deepening of 
these holes would provide valuable information.  

With regard to the 51 Zone, it was noted that the drilling was carried out mostly in the upper 
half of the orebody. Drilling deeper holes in the 51 Zone orebody would provide a good 
opportunity to increase the mineral resources, particularly in the northeastern and 
southwestern portions of the zone where vertical ore shoots are observed. 

Although no overall bias was observed, some smoothing of the grade estimates was noticed 
from the grade profile plots (swath plots). Further investigation in the reduction of the 
smoothing of the estimates is suggested, where perhaps a decrease in the maximum number of 
samples to calculate an estimate could be tested. 

The comparison of the current estimate of the mineral resource with the September 8, 2015 
estimate has shown an increase of indicated resources and a reduction of inferred resources 
from the current estimate. A larger tonnage at a lower average grade is noted for both indicated 
and inferred resources of the latest estimate. Changes in the interpretation of the mineralized 
zones as well as a different approach in the grade interpolation methodology are most likely the 
sources of the differences observed. 

The estimation of the gold and silver grades are believed to be a fair representation of the in-situ 
mineral resources of the Cape Ray project, based on the validation tests performed, and 
considering the drill hole database provided, and the current geologic understanding. The usage 
of ordinary kriging with capped composite grades is an appropriate grade estimation strategy for 
the Cape Ray deposits.

16. Mining Methods 

16.1 Introduction 

This PEA is based on the updated mineral resource estimate completed by Ginto Consulting Inc. 
as reported in Section 14. 

The PEA for the 04, 41, 51, and WGH deposits includes inferred mineral resources that are too 
speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable 
them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be 
realized. 

The mining methods, mine design, mine plan and costing was prepared by Nordmin's mining 
group and reviewed by Moose Mountain Technical Services (MMTS). MMTS found the work 
suitable for the scope of this PEA study and is the QP for said sections.  

The relative location and geometry of the 04, 41, 51 and WGH deposit to surface warrant an 
open pit mine scenario. The 04 deposit proposed plan incorporates a pit with the remainder of 
the deposit mined underground using a longhole stope method with cemented and un-
cemented rock fill.  

The 04 underground deposit would be accessed by one ramp from pit bottom, with broken rock 
transported to surface in underground haul trucks. 

The proposed Cape Ray production schedule would begin with the open pit mining of the 04 
deposit. The 04 open pit would take approximately 1 year to complete and generate 
approximately 270,000 tonnes of mill feed and 5.7 MT of waste that would be made available for 
underground backfill. The 04 pit would supply initial feed to the mill and surface stockpile.  

Once the 04 open pit is complete, towards the middle of year 1, the 04 pit crew and equipment 
would move to the 51 deposit and an underground contractor crew would commence driving 
the access for the underground portion of the 04 Zone.  The 51 open pit would take 
approximately 2 years to mine producing approximately 475,000T of mill feed and generating 
10.6 MT of waste rock. The 51 open pit mining would be complete early in year 3.  The 04 Zone 
underground production would start in year 2 and take approximately 1 year to complete mining 
approximately 151,000T of resource. 

Upon completion of mining in the 51 pit, crews would commence mining in the 41 open pit. The 
41 open pit would begin early in year 3 and finish in the later part of year 5. It would generate 
approximately 630,000 tonnes of mill feed and 5.9 MT of waste rock. 

When the 41 pit is complete, the contracting crews would transfer to the largest pit on the 
property, Window Glass Hill. Mining would commence in the later part of year 5, and finish in 
year 9. Total mill feed produced would be 1.4 MT while generating 8.1 MT of waste rock. Once 
completed, the contractor pit crews and equipment would demobilize.

The proposed plan is to operate the open pits for 6 months of the year, from May to November 
producing approximately 2,000 t/d of mill feed with the surplus stockpiled beside the mill. The 
annual open pit mill feed is anticipated to be approximately 336,000 tonnes per year. 

The underground deposits would be mined yearround with an anticipated production rate of 
315 t/d for an annual production rate of approximately 113,500 tonnes. 

The total feed to the mill over the 9 year mine life would be 2.9 MT and would be processed by 
the mill at a rate of 1000 t/d or 336,000 tonnes per year (see Table 16-1).

16.2 Geotechnical Analysis 

The PEA level geotechnical investigation work for selection of an underground mining method 
and required ground support as well as preliminary open pit parameters was performed by Mine 
Design Engineering. The recommendations formed the basis for the mine methods and selected 
methodology used in this technical report (PEA). 

The full geotechnical analysis report - MDENG Technical Report 0316-R0814-D02 is available for 
review. 

Mine Design Engineering (MDEng) of Kingston, Ontario, has conducted analyses based on 
geotechnical information collected from previous studies and reports and observations of core 
from previous drilling campaigns. A summary of the results are as follows:  

16.2.1 Geotechnical Site Characterization 

Rock conditions on site are very poor to good (mean Q rating between 0.6 and 32), in 
moderately strong rock (mean UCS 25-50 MPa). Structural conditions are assumed to be 
consistent across site, dominated by foliation dipping at approximately 55° to the southeast and 
a sub-horizontal set (J1) dipping at about 20 degrees to the northwest.

16.2.1.1 Open Pit Geotechnical Design  

Southeast facing slopes may support a maximum inter-ramp pit angle of 48° by empirical 
assessment. It has been assumed that benches would be 10m high; and while it is likely that 
benches can be drilled vertically, it is possible that the upper 5 m of southeast facing slopes 
would fail back to foliation, producing an effective bench face at 71°. These benches should be 
designed with 10 m catch bench width; this allows for a final effective bench width of 6.5 m after 
the hypothesized instability.  

On all other pit slopes, an inter-ramp angle of 52° is recommended; a bench width of 7.8 m is 
recommended to produce an inter-ramp angle of 52°, assuming 10 m high, near-vertical bench 
faces. This pit slope angle is also recommended for the Windowglass Hill deposit. 

For the shallow Windowglass Hill pit, an inter-ramp angle of 57° is recommended; assuming 10 
m high, vertical benches, a minimum catchment width of 6.5 m is suggested by rule-of-thumb 
calculations.  

Further site investigation is recommended to establish geotechnical domains, and provide 
structural orientation data to be used in more detailed analyses.  

16.2.1.2 Underground Geotechnical Designs  

Empirical methods were used to estimate appropriate stope sizes for the given ground 
conditions and make recommendations for mining method based on stope size restrictions.  

Long Hole Open Stoping (assuming the full width of the geological structure, plus the transition 
zone will be mined from HW and FW). 

 Endwall instability will be a major risk to longhole stoping. 

 Mine design will require small sub-level intervals  

All development will require: 

 Short rounds to avoid uncontrolled caving of the back. 

 In-cycle shotcrete to provide early confinement to the back and sidewalls. 

 Bolts and weld wire mesh screen should be installed over the shotcrete. Swellex bolts 
length should be ½ the drift span (dictated by deposit thickness), with spacing equal to 
no greater than ½ the bolt length (a maximum practical support spacing is 1.2 x 1.2 m). 

 For spans exceeding 6 m Super Swellex (24 tonne) should be utilized. Where 
development exceeds 5-6 m it will likely be necessary to develop a primary drive, and 
then slash out the sidewall(s) after support has been installed in the primary drive.

16.3 Open Pit  

16.3.1 Introduction  

The WGH, 04, 41, and the 51 zones would be mined by open pit method. Geotechnical criteria 
for the open pits is described in Section 16.2. Operations for the Cape Ray project are planned to 
have both Open Pit and Underground Mining. Each zone will be campaigned separately with the 
use of contractors. The initial mill feed will come from the 04 zone. Once the 04 pit is completed 
the 51 pit will commence to be mined followed by the 41 pit. The underground development for 
the 04 zone will start during the mining of the 51 pit. The start of the Window Glass pit will begin 
once the 41 pit is mined.  

The WGH is approximately 3.5km from the mill. A steel bridge would be required to cross the Isle 
Aux Morts River to access the WGH pit. Refer to the Section 18 for mill site and pit locations. 

16.3.2 Cut-off Grade 

Cut-off grade criterion represents the breakeven point of costs compared to revenue. A cutoff 
grade of 0.8g/t Au is selected, based on the breakeven cut-off grade calculations in the following 
table.

16.3.3 Ultimate pit shell optimization  

The pit shells used for this estimate are based on Lerchs Grossman optimization, using a gold 
price US$ 1,306 oz. and silver price was US$ 18.97/oz., with an exchange rate of 1.26 CDN:USD. 
The ultimate pit limits for the 04, 41, 51 and WGH deposits have been carried out using the block 
model files, transferred into NPV Scheduler® ver 4.27.19.0 software package. The model was 
checked, including a review of the block grades to ensure the integrity of the transfer. The block 
size for the model is 3 x 3 x 3 metres. The following data in the block model were utilized for the 
pit shell optimization.  

 Gold and Silver grades -  g/t 

 Resource category (Indicated and Inferred) 

 Density 

 Mineralized % – volume of the mineral zone in the block. 

 Non-mineralized % – volume of the block outside the mineral zone. 

 Topography % - volume of the block below the topography surface 

16.3.3.1 Pit shell parameters  

The pit shell optimization process uses the LG 3D algorithm in NPV Scheduler ® and is considered 
as the standard routine in the industry. The pit optimizer generates an optimal economic pit-
shell from a 3D block model. The basic optimization principle of the algorithm operates on a net 
value calculation for the block in the model, i.e. revenue from sales less total operating costs. 
The combination of these values and slope requirements allow the optimizer to search for the 
pit shell with the highest undiscounted cash flow. 

Geotechnical criteria for the open pits is described in Section 16.2. Since the pit optimization 
program does not produce a pit design with haul ramps, geotechnical berms and a proper 
benching arrangement, angles are taken to be slightly steeper than the anticipated final pit 
design slopes. To account for eventual pit designs that include these details, during the pit shell 
optimization, 95% mine recovery and 10% dilution was added to the delineated resource, and 
12% was added to the waste rock contents.The figures belove display 3D views of the generated 
pit shells used to produce the scheduled resources in this PEA.

16.3.4 Open Pit Operations 

The proposed open pits are conventional operations that use demonstrated technology and 
equipment for drilling, blasting, loading and haulage. A mine contractor would supply the 
needed manpower and equipment for the open pit operation. The pit contractor would also 
manage and supply all explosives and blasting accessories. The pit contract crews and equipment 
would also construct the haul roads.

Due to the extreme snowfall conditions in this area it is envisaged that open pit mining 
operations would be limited to 6 months of the year, 24 hour per day. Total open pit production 
is anticipated to be 4.6Mt per year from year -1 to year 3, then 2.5Mt per year from years 4 to 9, 
(during summer months). Ore will be transported to the mill and surface stockpile directly from 
the open pits. During the winter months, mill feed would come from underground and the 
surface stockpile. Table 16-4 shows the proposed contractor primary open pit equipment:

16.3.5 Open Pit Infrastructure 

16.3.5.1 Dewatering 

Conventional sumps and pumps would be used to dewater the pits during the warmer weather 
months. The pit water would be stored in a collection pond and treated prior to discharge if 
required. 

16.3.5.2 Water Management Infrastructure 

All open pit sites require water management infrastructure. This includes construction of 
collection ponds, ditching to collect contact water from the site, and berms to divert outside run 
off from entering the sites. Contact water would be directed to collection ponds by gravity feed 
and ditching. These collection ponds would allow sediments to settle. Water would be tested 
before being released into the environment or treated if required. 

16.3.5.3 Waste Dump Designs 

It is assumed for this PEA that all waste rock from open pit mining is potentially acid generating 
(PAG) material and would be dealt with accordingly. Overburden material would be segregated 
from the waste rock and stockpiled for mine closure. 

Stockpiling of ore material on a pad at the mill sites is envisaged. The ore stockpile and waste 
dumps would be designed to tie in with a water collection pond.

16.4 Underground Mining 

16.4.1 Underground Mine Design 

The selected stope cut-off grade for underground mining was 3.0 g/tonne Au. This was selected 
based on the parameters from Table 1-2 and Table 21-3. The block model was set to a cut-off 
grade of 4.0 g/t Au with vein limits and a preliminary mine design was created. 

All the operating costs are based on typical Canadian prices from contractors, suppliers and 
other similar type Canadian projects, for consumables and parts. The cost of power is based on 
rates charged by Newfoundland Labrador Hydro for similar sized power consumers in the 
province.  

The 04 deposit would have levels developed from the ramp at approximately 15 m vertical 
intervals. This small sub level interval will reduce the stope hydraulic radius (HR) to control

hanging wall failure. Each level could be developed from the ramp to the mineralized zone. All 
muck would be loaded into underground haul trucks and hauled-up the ramp to surface.  

The mining method proposed would be longhole open stoping with placement of cemented rock 
fill (CRF) in the primary stopes and unconsolidated waste fill in the secondary stopes. Figure 16-5 
represents the proposed 04 underground development and longhole stopes. 

 
Figure 16-5 Representation of the 04 underground LH Stopes. 

The mine access ramps for each deposit would facilitate movement of equipment, rock, 
manpower and materials to and from the underground mine. 

Most underground support facilities would be located on surface including the maintenance 
shop, main washrooms and the fuel farm. A push-pull ventilation arrangement would utilize 
raises at each extremity of the mineralized zones for fresh or return air. The ramp system would 
also be used to ventilate the mine. 

16.4.2 Underground Mine Development and Infrastructure 

16.4.2.1 Access Ramp 

The access ramp for the 04 zone would be developed from the 04 pit bottom. The ramp would 
be 509 metres long and driven at a grade of 18%.  

Remuck bays would be excavated every 150 m along the ramp. The ramp would have

dimensions of 4.5 m by 4.5 m to accommodate the underground haul trucks, and also to provide 
a reasonable cross-sectional area for ventilation. Safety bays would be spaced at 30 m intervals, 
as required. Services located in the main ramp would include compressed air line, water line, 
discharge water line, electrical power cables, blasting line and a leaky feeder cable.  

The 4.5 m wide by 5.5 m high muck bays would be located on each mucking horizon. These 
loading areas would accommodate a Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) loading a 30 tonne truck. 

16.4.2.2 Level Development 

Levels would be developed with access from the main ramp to the LH stopes. The levels would 
consist of a haulage drift in waste running the entire strike length of the zones to be mined.  

Access to the ventilation raise andsecondary means of egress would be developed on each level. 
Truck loading stations would be located at intersections of the haulage drift and ramp access. 
The loading area would have the backs excavated to a height to facilitate an LHD loading a 30 
tonne underground haul truck. Other level development would include temporary electrical sub-
stations, sumps and refuge stations.  

Services installed in the haulage drift would include 51 mm water line, 102 mm compressed 
airline, power cable, blasting line and a leaky feeder cable. At each active mucking stope an 
auxiliary ventilation fan would be located in the haulage drift with ventilation ducting hung into 
the draw point for ventilation. All ramp and level waste development would be excavated by the 
mining contractor using 2 boom electric hydraulic drill jumbos, LHDs, 30 tonne haul trucks, 
scissor lift/bolters and other rubber tired diesel-powered support equipment.  

16.4.3 Underground Service Infrastructure 

16.4.3.1  Process Water  

Process water would be used for underground activities and muck conditioning. 

16.4.3.2 Compressed Air 

Compressed air would be supplied at 110 PSI from two electric centrifugal air compressors. The 
compressors would be connected to the 102 mm schedule 40 pipe in the main ramp with 
distribution to each haulage drift and stope draw point. 

16.4.3.3 Collection Sumps 

Process water collection sumps would be located throughout the mine and would be staged 
pumped along the main ramp back up to the surface collection pond. 

16.4.3.4 Refuge Stations 

Refuge stations would be set up near each of the deposits. The refuge stations would be 15 m 
long by 4 m wide and 3.8 m high; they would be located off the haulage drifts. Ground support

for the would consist of 1.8 m resin grouted rebar bolts installed on a 1.2 m by 1.2 m pattern 
with welded wire mesh screen, on the back and walls to the drift sill. The floor would be poured 
concrete. The access wall would be shotcreted, and a steel man-door would be installed for 
entry. The refuge stations would contain potable water, fire clay, rescue and first aid equipment, 
a fire extinguisher, an eyewash station, emergency rations and a stretcher. The refuge stations 
would also serve as a heated lunch room with basic amenities. The refuge stations would be 
ventilated through intake and exhaust ventilation ducts which can be sealed off in an 
emergency. A compressed air line would also service the refuge station. Due to the short mine 
duration, a portable refuge station would be used.  

16.4.3.5 Explosives Magazine 

An explosives magazine would be located off the main ramp and would meet the Newfoundland 
Mines Act and Regulations requirements. The powder magazine would also be equipped with 
sufficient auxiliary ventilation to adequately ventilate the area. 

16.4.3.6 Detonator Magazine 

A detonator magazine would be located off the main ramp and would meet the Newfoundland 
Mines Act and Regulations requirements. The detonator magazine would also be equipped with 
sufficient auxiliary ventilation to adequately ventilate the area. 

16.4.3.7 Materials Handling and Storage Area 

With access readily available to surface via the ramp system, the main storage of materials 
would be in a surface storage building or surface laydown area. Smaller amounts of material 
would be stored underground in idle headings. Fuel and lubricants would be transported 
underground by the lube truck which would service underground equipment at the face. Mobile 
equipment destined for surface would stop at the surface fuel farm for fuel and lubes prior to 
heading back underground. 

16.4.3.8 Latrines 

The heated washrooms on surface would be easily accessible from the mine due to the relatively 
short distance from the work headings to surface. Underground toilets of a temporary nature 
would be provided. They would be of portable design and the catchment containers would be 
checked regularly and exchanged as required. The used catchment containers would be 
transported to the sewage treatment area where they would be dumped and cleaning before 
they are returned into service.  

16.4.3.9  Communications and Controls System 

The main emergency notification system would be a stench gas that is injected into the main 
fresh air ventilation system and the compressed air lines. A mine radio system would be installed 
to allow communication on surface and underground through the leaky feeder cable.

16.4.4 Mine Production Methods 

It is envisaged that the mining method used to mine the underground portion of the 04 deposit 
would be by conventional longhole stoping.  

16.4.4.1 Longhole Stoping  

Stopes would have a nominal dimension of 15 m along strike by 3m wide with sub level intervals 
of 15m.  

Mineral extraction would commence from the bottom stope in each area and continue upwards. 
Primary stopes would be filled with cemented rock fill (CRF) and secondary stopes with un-
cemented rock fill.  

Longhole open stoping requires an undercut and top sill drift to be developed for each stope. 
The undercut sill is the extraction level from which stopes are mucked out. The top sill is initially 
the drilling horizon. After a stope has been backfilled, the top sill is used as a mucking horizon for 
the longhole stope directly above the backfilled stope. 

Mucking and backfilling activities would be accomplished utilizing remote controlled load-haul-
dump (LHD) units.  

16.4.4.1.1 Stope Sequencing 

Stopes would be sequenced from the bottom of the zone with primary stopes filled with CRF 
and secondary stopes with waste rock. Figure 16-6 shows a typical stope sequence in a 
longitudinal section view. 

 
Figure 16-6 Stope Sequence 

16.4.4.1.2 Mining Dilution 

The longhole open stopes are mined from the bottom up with primary stopes filled with 
cemented rock fill and secondary stopes with waste rock.

The following methodology is used to estimate the dilution from all sources. The dilution 
estimate is from the stope perimeter walls sloughing. All dilution is considered unplanned 
dilution from stope wall failures, blast over break or backfill mixed in the mineralized muck from 
the stope floor.  

The maximum extent of hanging wall, footwall and side wall slough into the stopes is controlled 
by the short sub level interval. Backfill dilution would also come from mucking off the waste 
filled stope below. Emphasis would be placed on mucking operation to minimize this dilution. 
Dilution of 20% can be expected with longhole mining.  

16.4.4.1.3 Mining Recovery & Loss 

Recovery of (diluted) resource tonnes (RDT) is expected to be 95%. The losses can occur from 
inefficient drilling or hole deviation, blasting in stope corners and walls, difficult remote mucking 
in stope corners and edges, or abandoning a stope due to excessive dilution from wall failure. 
Mineralized rock would be mucked until the stope is empty or deemed waste under geology 
control. 

16.4.5 Backfill  

The waste rock required for the underground backfill would be generated from the open pit 
deposit. Pit waste would be generated as follows:  

Table 16-6 Open pit waste produced (in thousand) 

Deposit Waste tonne  

04 5,725 
41 5,929  
51 10,576 
WGH 8,120  
Total 30,350 

16.4.5.1 04 deposit backfill methodology 

On surface, waste rock would be dumped into the backfill raise and travel down the raise to a 
designated backfill station. A portable concrete slurry batching plant would be set up on surface 
near the 04 underground deposit. If cemented rock fill (CRF) is required cement slurry would be 
sent underground via a drilled hole to the backfill station and cement slurry sprayed on a truck 
loaded with waste rock. The CRF would then be trucked and placed into the stope. 

16.4.6 Ventilation 

The ventilation system is required to provide clean air of adequate volume to remove airborne 
contaminants from the underground work headings. The air flow requirements were based on 
the Newfoundland Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations dated January 17, 2012 
which states that ASHRAE, ACGIH requirement to be observed. Table 16-7 presents the

16.4.6.1 Ventilation Plan 

Air distribution would be dependent on the quantity and location of diesel equipment deployed 
throughout the mine. Vent regulators, air lock doors and auxiliary vent fans would control and 
direct air volumes and flow to the required areas. 

The primary ventilation system proposed is a push-pull system which would consist of high 
pressure exhaust fans and low pressure intake fans located on surface. Low pressure fans would 
push fresh air down the fresh air raise. This air would be heated in cold weather conditions. The 
high pressure exhaust fans would draw air from underground up the exhaust raise to surface. 
The ventilation network was not simulated. The fans selected and costs are typical for the size of 
these underground operations. 

16.4.7 Underground Development Plan and Schedule 

Pre-production mine development and construction for underground requires approximately 1.5 
years that would be performed by a mining contractor. One development crew would drive the 
ramp for the 04 deposit from the mined out pit with an expected advance rate of 5.2 m/d. The 
anticipated life of mine for underground mining is 1 year, operating 350 days per year at the 
following mining rate.

and out of the mine. These man carriers would also be used to move maintenance and support 
staff into and out of the mine. Two shotcrete spray units would be required during the cut and 
fill drift mining. Drills would be required for longhole production drilling and deep swellex bolt 
support. The full complement of underground equipment is listed in Table 16-10.

16.5 Life of Mine Schedule  

The life of mine production schedule is shown in Table 16-1. 

The mill production schedule is based on processing approximately 1,000 tonnes of resource per 
day for 335 days per year, or 336,000 tonnes per year. The mill would have a capacity of 1,150 
t/d based on 85% availability providing some flexibility to the operation. 

The open pits would operate 183 days/yr., or 6 months of the year, at a rate of approximately 
2,000 t/d PMR. This resource would feed the mill and surface stockpile.  

The underground mine would operate 350 days/yr. at a rate of approximately 315 t/d.

17. Recovery Methods 

17.1 Conceptual Process Flowsheet Summary 

Run of mine Potential Mining Resource would be delivered to the mill feed stockpile at a rate of 
1000 t/d for six to seven months of the year from the open pit while underground production 
would continue throughout the year. The proposed processing rate is 46 t/h or 1000 t/d with the 
mill operating at 92 % availability 365 days per year. ROM (Run of Mine), at– 203.2 mm, is first 
reduced to – 25.4mm in a single jaw crusher. Further size reduction to–12.7mm is achieved in a 
series of two gyratory cone crushers operating in closed circuit with a double deck screen. The 
crushed product is stockpiled ahead of the grinding circuit and is then fed to grinding via a 
primary grinding mill feed conveyor.  

Size reduction from – 10 mm to 80 % passing 100 microns is achieved in the grinding circuit. 
Crushed product is fed to two parallel primary ball mills at 46 t/h. Primary mill discharge is 
directed by a screen and the screen underflow reports to a pair of gravity concentrators for 
recovery of any coarse free gold. The screen oversize reports back to the primary mill feed. The 
gravity concentrator tailing reports to the secondary grinding circuit for further size reduction 
before reporting to the CIL circuit thickener.  

Prior to cyanide leaching of the contained gold in the PMR, the pulp is thickened to 45 % solids 
by weight using the CIL pre-leach thickener. The thickened pulp is advanced in the CIL circuit at 
the full process flow rate of 46 t/h solids. In the CIL circuit gold is recovered from the solids using 
whole ore cyanidation and the gold is transferred to the surface of the activated carbon. The 
activated carbon is separated from the main pulp flow by a combination of pumping and 
screening. The loaded carbon is washed with hydrochloric acid solution to remove the 
carbonates. Gold is then removed from the loaded carbon using pressure stripping. The gold is 
transferred from the surface of the loaded carbon to solution and from there is recovered to 
marketable form using the electrowinning process.  

The stripped carbon is regenerated in a reactivation kiln before being reintroduced to the 
process. Fine carbon is constantly eliminated (and recovered) from the process to avoid gold 
loss, with fresh carbon being continuously added to the process.  

The cyanide contained in the tailings from the CIL circuit is eliminated in a cyanide destruction 
tank with SO2-air process. Once the cyanide is destroyed, the tailings are transported to the 
tailings pond for disposal.  

Below is a conceptual process flow sheet that will be used to process the ore;

17.2 Process Description 

17.2.1 Material Handling 

Run of mine material will be trucked to the mill site which will be in the range of one to three 
kilometers. It will be stockpiled through the summer months and processed year round. The 
crushing circuit was designed with a nominal 76tph capacity, allowing for further flexibility and a 
de-coupling between crushing and processing plant.  

Primary crushing will comprise a 20 tonne capacity feed hopper with 42" vibrating grizzly feeder 
and 30'x42' jaw crusher driven by 150 hp motor and will be fed by a front end loader.  

Crushed PMR will drop on to a 36" conveyor and travel under a cross-belt magnet for tramp 
metal removal and over a single idler belt scale for monitoring the processed tonnage. The jaw 
crusher product will be fed to a double deck 5'x12' inclined vibrating screen.  

Screen oversize will report to a secondary crusher, intermediate product will report to a tertiary 
crusher. The screen undersize, (-10mm) will be stockpiled outside the processing plant in an 
uncovered pile. The secondary crusher will operate in open circuit and the tertiary crusher will 
operate in closed circuit with the vibrating screen. The discharges from all three crushers will be 
conveyed back to the screen feed conveyor. A Sepro Blackhawk 100 crusher with 100 kW direct 
drive motor has been recommended for both secondary and tertiary crushing duty.  

17.2.2 Grinding and Thickening 

The fine PMR surge pile reclaim conveyor will discharge onto a fixed speed primary grinding feed 
conveyor. The conveyor will have a single idler belt scale and discharge into a splitting discharge 
chute to feed material to the two primary ball mill feed conveyors.  

The grinding circuit will have a total of four 2.1mx 6.0m, 330 kW drive, tyre-mounted grinding 
mills. Two primary mills will operate in parallel with two more identical mills for secondary 
grinding duty. The primary mills will be in open circuit and the secondary mills in closed circuit 
with classifying cyclones. The discharge from all four mills will be pumped to a 2mm scalping 
screen. Oversize material will be returned to the primary ball mills and the fines will report to 
two Falcon SB 1350 gravity concentrators.  

The gravity tailings will be pumped to the cyclones. The cyclone overflow, with a target p80 of 
100µm will report to a trash screen to remove wood chips, plastic etc., and to a primary 
thickener ahead of the CIL circuit. The cyclone underflow will be split two ways and delivered by 
gravity back to the two secondary mills.  

The gravity concentrate will drop into a secure containment and will be pumped to the Sepro 
SLR 3000 intensive leach reactor where it will be subject to leaching under high cyanide and 
dissolved oxygen. Clear pregnant leach solution from the SLR will be pumped to the secure 
electrowinning circuit located in the elution section of the plant. Tailings from the SLR will be

returned to the secondary mill discharge sump. In this configuration, the entire ball mill 
discharge stream can be processed through the gravity concentrators.  

The tails underflow target is 35% solids  by weight at a pH of 10.5 reporting to the CIL circuit. The 
pulp pH is controlled by lime addition in the grinding circuit and additional lime added in the CIL 
as required. . 

17.2.3 Carbon-in-Leach 

The thickened slurry from the preleach thickener will be pumped to a series of four 7m diameter 
by 12m high agitated tanks, providing 30h residence time. The inter-tank flow will be by gravity 
launders equipped with inter-stage screening to maintain the counter current flow of activated 
carbon 

Leaching is achieved with sodium cyanide (NaCN) which will be added at the front end of the 
leach circuit. pH will be monitored throughout the leach and absorption circuit. Manual sampling 
will be used to monitor and control free cyanide levels in the leach circuit.  

The underflow from the pre-leach thickener is pumped to the first of four CIL tanks. Slurry from 
this tank overflows into the second and flows by gravity through the circuit. Cyanide solution and 
lime are added, as required, for gold dissolution and pH control. Gold in the solution is adsorbed 
onto the activated carbon. Slurry from the last CIL leach tank passes over a safety screen prior to 
cyanide destruction. Air is injected in the bottom of each tank for gold dissolution. 
Interconnecting tank launders are arranged so that any tank in series can be bypassed without 
having to shut down the entire CIL circuit 

Loaded carbon is pumped counter current to the slurry flow through the CIL tanks in order to 
increase gold loading. The carbon-forwarding pump of the first CIL tank transfers the slurry on to 
the loaded carbon screen to recover the loaded carbon from the slurry. The undersize from the 
loaded carbon screen is filtered and sold to recover the contained gold. Fresh and regenerated 
carbon is added into the last CIL tank.  

17.2.4 Elution and Carbon Reactivation 

Loaded carbon recovered by the screen reports to the acid wash column of the elution circuit. 
The acid solution is prepared in the dilute acid tank and the pumped through the acid wash 
column. The spent acid is then neutralized with caustic. The carbon is transferred from the acid 
wash column to the strip column for gold desorption. During desorption the gold is transferred 
from the surface of the activated carbon into the strip solution. This process is carried out at 
elevated temperature and pressure and is normally a 8 - 12 hours cycle. A series of heat 
exchangers and a heater in the barren strip solution tank are used to bring the strip solution to 
operating temperature before entering the strip column. The pregnant solution then goes to the 
electrowinning cells in the refinery for gold recovery.  

The stripped carbon is drawn from the strip column and reports to the carbon reactivation kiln. 
After reactivation, the carbon is discharged into the carbon pre-preparation tank. The carbon

from the carbon pre-preparation tank is pumped and screened out to remove and recover fine 
carbon and then drops by gravity to the last CIL tank. Fresh carbon is added in the carbon pre-
preparation tank on a regular basis to compensate for the fine carbon removal.  

17.2.5 Electrowinning and Refinery 

The pregnant solution from the strip column flows first by gravity to the electrowinning flash 
tank and then the electrowinning cells, where the gold is plated on cathodes. The barren 
solution from the electrowinning cells is recovered in a pump box and pumped back to the 
barren strip solution tank in the carbon elution circuit.  

In the electrowinning cells, the stainless wool cathodes are cleaned with high pressure water and 
the gold sludge sinks to the bottom of the cells. The gold sludge is then pumped to a filter-press 
to remove the excess water. The filtrate is pumped to the Tank A launder in the CIL circuit. 

The filtered gold sludge is sent to the calcination oven to remove excessive humidity. The dried 
gold sludge is then mixed with flux and is fed to the electric induction furnace. Once the gold is 
melted, it is poured into the doré moulds. The doré bar is recovered for shipment.  

17.2.6 Cyanide Destruction 

Slurry from the last CIL tank reports across a safety screen (size) in order to capture any carbon 
that might inadvertently escape through the last interstage screen and report to tailing. The 
carbon is recovered at the oversize and into a bin.  

The screen undersize flows by gravity into the cyanide destruction tank feed pump box and is 
pumped to the cyanide destruction tank. Air and liquid SO2 is added at the bottom of the 
cyanide destruction tank. Once cyanide destruction is complete, the tailings are discharged in to 
a buffer tank for filtering before disposing in the tailings containment area.   

17.2.7 Tailings Management 

Tailings from mill operations (after CN destruction process) will be handled by conventional 
methods and disposed of in an engineered Tailings Management Facility (TMF). The tailings and 
waste water will be pumped to the TMF via a slurry pipeline at 35% solids.  

The TMF supernatant pond and waste water treatment plant will be designed to withstand a 30 
day duration, 1 in 100 year rain on snow event. The TMF will be equipped with an engineered 
spillway to prevent a potential dam failure due to overtopping during a Probable Maximum 
Precipitation ("PMP") event.  

The preliminary TMF design has storage capacity of 1.2M cubic metres of tailings solids, with the 
possibility to increase in the future by raising the height, concurrent with any requirements for 
amendments to necessary approvals. The TMF surface footprint is not anticipated to be 
materially changed as a result of any future raises. The TMF will be constructed, operated, 
maintained and monitored in accordance with Guide to the Management of Tailings Facilities

(MAC, 1999) and Environment Canada (2009). 

At closure, the TMF and plant sites will be covered with an engineered, low-permeability dry 
cover that will minimize infiltration of water. Seepage collection around the TMF will continue 
post closure until the seepage decreases and no longer poses a risk to the environment.   

17.2.8 Reagents 

Sodium Cyanide (NaCN) is used for gold leaching in the CIL circuit and for carbon stripping in the 
carbon elution circuit. This will be supplied in tote bags and will be mixed on site.  

Flocculent: used in the thickeners to aid in settling rates. This will be supplied in tote bags and 
mixed on site.  

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is used for carbon acid wash. This will be supplied in drums and pumped 
to a storage tank.  

Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is used as an oxidising agent in the cyanide destruction process. This will be 
delivered by 1 tonne totes.  

Lime is used to control the pH in the grinding circuit, CIL and cyanide destruction circuit. It will be 
delivered in bulk and stored in a lime silo on site.  

Copper sulphate (CuSO4) is used as a catalyst in the cyanide destruction process. It will be 
delivered in totes and mixed on site.  

Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) is used for carbon stripping and after the carbon acid wash to 
neutralize the residual acid in the dilute acid tank and the acid wash column. This will be 
supplied in drums.  

Anti-scalent will be used to reduce the calcium carbonate buildup in the water system. This will 
be supplied in drums and added to the process water tank.  

Grinding balls will be delivered in totes or large containers for use in the ball mills. 3.5" balls will 
be used in the primary mills and a mixed ball charge of 1.25" and 2" will be used in the 
secondary mills.   

The two cone crushers will require liners. Standard liner configuration will be required for the 
secondary crusher and short-head standard configuration of liners for secondary crushing. 

17.3 Utilities 

Utilities required will include a fresh water system; reclaim water system from the tailings 
impoundment and process water.  

Potable water will be required for emergency showers and washroom facilities and fire system.

Cape Ray Technical Report February 08, 2017 
 

18.  Project Infrastructure 

Currently there is no permanent infrastructure at the Cape Ray Property. There is evidence of 
previous exploration work including drilling, trenching, and bulk sampling via a portal and drift at 
the 41 Deposit. Electrical and telephone lines do not extend to the Cape Ray Property with the 
nearest high voltage electrical substation located approximately 25 km southwest in the 
community of Channel-Port aux Basques - see Figure 18.1 

 
Figure 18.1 Cape Ray Property nearby Infrastructure 

Presently, mobile portable camp trailers on the Cape Ray Property require the use of gas 
generators for electricity and propane for heat and cooking. Due to the small quantities 
required, fuel is brought to site in portable tanks via the access road. To support activity on the 
property, a sewage system and water supply system is required along with the appropriate 
certificate of approvals. 

All areas covered by the PEA presented in this technical report occur on crown land owned by 
the Province of Newfoundland. The development of any future mining operations in this area 
must follow provincial permitting requirements.  

The deposit area is surrounded by an abundance of barren land that is not populated except for 
a few seasonal cottages within the claim boundary. Considering the local economy and the ideal 
location, it is anticipated that the Newfoundland government would be favorable to the 
development of a new mining project, provided all of the environmental, socio-economic, and 
permitting issues were addressed properly.

The abundance of surface water resources from lakes on the Cape Ray Property is a positive 
factor for future development, as is the presence of deep water wharf facilities and commercial 
shipping infrastructure at nearby Channel - Port aux Basques (<50 km driving distance) (Ténière 
& Hilchey, 2012). 

The main infrastructure required for the Cape Ray project includes: (Figure 18.2 Mine Site and 
Complex.)  

 Processing Plant (Mill) 

 Tailing Management Facility (TMF) with Treatment plant and CN Destruction plant 

 Road and culvert upgrades 

 "Bridge Mabey" C200 bridge x 5.25m width, c/w epoxy aggregate steel decks

18.1 Processing Plant 

The Mill would process muck at a rate of 1000 tonnes per day with an anticipated annual 
capacity of 335,000 tonnes. During the winter months, underground operations would supply 
feed to the mill with supplemental feed drawn from the stockpile, outside the mill. The mill 
would house the assay lab, dry, office, first aid station and a lunch room. 

Process facility design and recovery are covered in greater detail in Sections 13 and 17.  

18.2 Tailings management Facility (TMF) 

The TMF and effluent treatment plant will be design to withstand a 100 year rain or snow event. 
The TMF would cover an area of approximately 38 hectares and provides adequate storage 
capacity for the approximately 1.6M m

3
 of tailings anticipated to be produced over the projected 

mine life. The average rate of deposition of tails is 335k t/yr. at a density of 1.6 t/m
3
. The TMF 

construction of the dams and buttresses will utilize mine waste rock or quarried rock from a 
nearby location. Tailings would be deposited from spigots located along the ridge of the TMF. 
Process water would be drawn from the TMF area. If required to control water levels in the TMF, 
effluent water would be treated and discharged to the polishing pond. Figure 18.2 above shows 
the TMF location. 

18.3 Site Access Road 

The existing 22 km road to the Cape Ray project would require upgrades to enable site 
construction and year round mill access. This includes widening parts of the road, changing some 
of the existing culverts, and cutting and filling in some of the steep sections of road.  

The final 22 km road would be a single lane gravel road with pull overs. The road would be 
maintained to supply year round access to the mill site. Figure 18.3 shows the location of the 
existing road into the Cape Ray site.

18.4 Electrical and Communications 

18.4.1 Mine Site Power 

Access to the Newfoundland Power electrical transmission grid is available along Route 470 near 
Isle aux Morts. The installation of a three-phase 66kV electrical transformer station and a 
transmission line tap would need to be installed. 

The utility that owns the 66kV line is actually Newfoundland Power (a Fortis company) that 
connects to Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro further up the line near Port aux Basques at a 
higher voltage. The site would be a customer of Newfoundland Power. 

 A medium voltage 13.8 kV overhead power line to the proposed 5MVA, 4160 Volts substation at 
the mine site would supply the needed power for the milling and underground mining 
operations. A 1MVA genset will supply emergency power to the site during a power outage. A 
genset will also be used for electricity needed for the open pit operation.  

18.4.2 Communications 

Communication lines would be run in conjunction with the electrical pole line to the mine site. A 
radio system would be installed to establish mine site surface and underground communication. 
Typical land line telephones will be used for contact on and off site.

18.5 Propane 

Propane storage tanks of a suitable size would be located close to the area it serves. Propane 
units would be used for mine air heating, surface building heat and hot water. 

18.6 Fuel Storage 

A 20,000 litre double wall above ground fuel tank would store and dispense fuel as required. 
Open pit haul trucks would fuel at the fuel storage site along with underground haul trucks. A 
service fuel truck would also deliver fuel to underground and open pit drill equipment. 

18.7 Process and potable water 

Process water in the mill and water accumulating in the TMF would be recirculated back into the 
mill process water supply system which minimizes the amount of fresh water pumped from the 
lake. 

An insulated pump house would draw fresh lake water from a nearby source at a volume of 
1,150 cu.m per day (800 L/min). This water will be utilized as process make up water to the mill 
and as a supply of raw water for treatment to serve as potable water.  

18.8 Sewage Treatment Facility 

A small sewage treatment facility will be required to service the entire mine site. 

18.9 Mine Services 

The mine site would have an office, first aid station, security, mine rescue room, mine dry and 
process plant. A parking area for employee vehicles and service vehicles would be located near 
the office. 

A warehouse and cold storage would be attached to the process plant. A 20m x 30m dome style 
shop would service the open pit and underground mine equipment.  

An explosive and detonator storage would be located a safe distance from buildings and mine 
operations. 

Waste rock generated from the 41 pit and 51 pit would be stored on the waste pad north west of 
the TMF. Site water and open pit water would be controlled by diversion ditches and berms. 
Open pit water would report to the existing catchment and sediment pond. A water treatment 
plant would treat water discharged to the environment if required. The mine complex is 
depicted in Figure 18.4.

19.  Market Studies and Contracts 

Gold and silver will be the only commodities produced from Cape Ray. These commodities are 
freely traded, at prices that are widely known, and the prospects for the sale of any production 
are virtually assured. Prices for these commodities are usually quoted in U.S. dollars per troy 
ounce. Figure 19-1 and Figure 19-2 show the fluctuation of the price of gold and silver and the 
American dollar to the Canadian dollar exchange rate over the last five years. The PEA base case 
scenario uses a price of 1,306.15 $US per ounce gold, 18.97$US per ounce silver, and an 
exchange rate of 1.262 Canadian dollars per American dollar.

Figure 19-2 5 Year Silver Price Charts 

Nordmin is aware that while a project of this size does not require absolute knowledge of the 
intricacies associated with markets and contracts, the joint venture partnership with Benton is 
well aware of the risks and benefits provided through different strategies.

Doré will be produced at the Cape Ray Mill. The doré will be transported via a contracted 
security company from the mill to Deer Lake then to the contracted refinery. Agreements will be 
required with a refinery to sell doré and produce bullion.  

The cost associated with doré transportation from the mine site to the commercial refinery and 
insurance used in the economic analysis is $5/oz.

20.  Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social Impacts 

The following sections will briefly describe the physical, biological and socio-economic 
environments within the area that may be adversely affected by Project activities. There have 
been no regional studies as described in Sections 73 to 77 of CEAA 2012 carried out at the site as 
of yet. The collection of empirical data for all of these environmental aspects is planned for the 
2017 and 2018 season following final EIS Guidelines issued by the NL government and the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA).  

Some data on regional biophysical baseline conditions was obtained from historical publications 
submitted to the NL government by the previous owners. This information is summarized below. 
For those aspects where no baseline data exists, plans for the collection of this data will be 
prepared before initiation of the EA. 

For the environmental studies, permitting and socio-economic evaluation sections of this report 
the following documents were reviewed:  

1. An Environmental Preview Report for the Proposed Access Road to the Cape Ray Exploration 
Site. S. Fudge and Associates Ltd. August 1988.

Waste Management Consultants. April 1989. 

8. Guidelines for the Assessment of Alternatives for Mine Waste Disposal. Environment Canada 
Mining and Processing Divison. September 2011. 

The list of documents above, which were accessed through an Inter-Library loan from Memorial 
University, were the only ones available on site conditions at Cape Ray after an exhaustive 
literature search. Other documents reviewed but not listed here included Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador EA Guidance Manuals, Environmental Acts and Regulations as well 
as personal communications with regulatory officials in Newfoundland and Labrador 
Environment and Conservation and Department of Natural Resources.

20.1 Natural Environment 

20.1.1 Regional Climate 

The study area has a moderate climate with a maritime influence based on its proximity to the 
sea the Cabot Straight and Gulf of St. Lawrence. Freeze up usually does not occur until 
December. There are variable weather conditions and frequent freeze/thaw cycles throughout 
the winter. The prevailing winds are west to northwesterly in autumn and winter and 
southwesterly in spring and summer.  

Climate data for the periods 1981 to 2010 is shown in Table 20-1 and Figure 20-1. This data was 
obtained from the Environment Canada Climate Data website from climate monitoring stations 
located in Isle aux Morts which is the village most proximate to the Project site.  

The climate data for the period of record analyzed shows that show daily mean temperatures in 
August of 15.8 °C and an average maximum August daily temperature of 19.0 °C (see Table 20-1). 
The average daily winter maximum temperature in February is -2.4°C and the corresponding 
average minimum is -9.2°C. The extreme winter minimum is -24°C, recorded in February. 
Average yearly precipitation totals 1,653.1 mm, which includes 325.8 cm of snowfall. Very high 
winds with gusts >100 km/h can occur, often from southerly and southeasterly directions. 
Temperature and precipitation averages for Isle aux Morts are shown below in Figure 20-1.  

Weather and site conditions during the spring break-up period (typically April to late May) can 
prevent some exploration activities from being carried out due to high water levels and remnant 
snow cover. Scheduling of field activities to avoid this period is generally advisable. Winter 
programs can be carried out with snowmobiles, with consideration given to snowfall and cold 
temperature conditions, as well as potentially high wind conditions with reduced visibility that 
generally accompany storm events. Coastal waters south of the Cape Ray Property are free of ice 
and are navigable all year around.

20.1.2 Air Quality and Noise 

There are no historical records for air quality and noise in the regional area surrounding the 
Project Site. As part of the EA process and Environmental Baseline data collection program, 
these surveys will be conducted as per the issued final EIS Guidelines for the Cape Ray Gold 
project. The surveys will take place in 2017 or 2018 and the data included in the EIS submissions 
to the government of NL and CEAA. 

20.1.3 Geology and Topography 

There is little historical data available on the Geology and Topography of the study area other 
what could be obtained from some of the component studies performed by the previous owners 
of the Site. In summary, the regional area surrounding the Project site was glaciated during the 
advance of the Wisconsin ice sheet. The study area is located on the southern slopes of the Long 
Range Mountains and is characterized by broad wooded valleys, gently sloping organic deposits 
and rugged bedrock dominated uplands. The dominant surficial characteristics are bedrock 
concealed by vegetation, barren outcrops or lichen covered rock, thin bog cover; minor thin until 
deposits and the occasional drumlinoid feature. The deeply incised river valleys contain 
glaciofluvial deposits and alluvial deposits derived from postglacial erosional and sedimentary 
processes. 

The rugged and often strongly sloping topography varies in elevation from approximately 140 m 
along the valley bottom of the Isle aux Morts River to nearly 480 m along the eastern boundary 
of the regional study area.

20.1.4 Vegetation and Soils 

The following information was gleaned from various component study reports undertaken by 
the previous owners. Nordmin intends to augment this data with baseline field surveys as part of 
the EA process. These studies are in the planning stages at present and will be implemented 
during the 2017 and 2018 field seasons. 

Most of the regional study area is occupied by dwarf shrub heath. Species composition varies 
depending on snow cover and exposure. Sheep laurel (Kalmia angustifolia) heath is the most 
abundant dwarf shrub vegetation in this ecoregion. In areas with deep snow cover, this heath is 
augmented by rhodora (Rhododendron canadense). Exposed knolls and summits are generally 
occupied by heath, dominated by arctic-alpine species such as diapensia (Diapensia lapponica), 
pink crowberry (Empetrum eamesii) and tundra bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosa).  

Wind pruned stands of black spruce (Picea mariana) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) known as 
tuckamoor are generally found on well-drained sites with moderate wind exposures. These 
stands are characteristic of the Long Range Barrens ecoregion. Fully developed forests are 
restricted to sheltered valleys. In the Southern Long Range sub region, these forests are 
composed mainly of balsam fir, with small quantities of mountain white birch (Betula cardifolia) 
and black spruce. These stands are densely stocked and are often severely affected by moose 
browsing and damage from exposure to wind and ice. 

Peatlands vary in abundance depending on the topography. Peatlands are extensive in the 
Southern Long Range sub region but are not the dominant feature of the landscape. The most 
common peatlands are oligotrophic patterned fens.  

Ferro-Humic Podzols and Humo–Ferric Podzols are the characteristic soils of the study area. 
These soils are course textured, extremely stony and bouldery. They are usually very shallow, 
but bedrock outcrops are uncommon. Soils of the study area are unsuitable for agricultural 
purposes by virtue of their shallowness and wetness, and lack of organic matter and nutrients. 
Organic soils in the form of Typic Mesisols are derived from sedge peats and occur throughout 
the study area. Orthic Regosols occur on the lower terraces along the rivers and streams. These 
soils are by definition poorly developed and have poor moisture holding capacity because of 
their coarse textures and are susceptible to inundation because of their location.  

20.1.5 Wetlands 

There are no historical records for the wetlands that occur in the regional area surrounding the 
Project Site. As part of the EA process and Environmental Baseline data collection program, 
these surveys will be conducted as per final EIS Guidelines for the project. The surveys will take 
place in 2017 or 2018 and the data included in the EIS. 

20.1.6 Regional Hydrology 

Monthly average flow rates for the Isle aux Morts River were obtained from the Water Survey of 
Canada (WSC) hydrometric database. The WSC maintains a hydrometric gauging station on the

Isle aux Morts River just below the Highway 470 bridge (Sta 02ZB001). Hydrometric data is 
available for this station dating back to 1962, however, only the period from 2000 to 2013 (the 
last year available) was analyzed for trending purposes for this report. Table 20-2 summarizes 
the mean monthly flow rates (m

3
/sec) for this period. Figure 20-2 illustrates the flow trends over 

this same period of record. As illustrated, the maximum flow rates occur in April and May and 
minimum flow rates generally occur in January and February and again in July/August.

Figure 20-3 Mean, Max and Min Monthly flows for Isle aux Morts River 2003 – 2013 

 
Figure 20-4 Isle aux Morts River Hydrograph for 2013 

The drainage area for the Isle aux Morts river system is 205 km
2 

and as can be seen from the 
hydrometric data the river tends to be quite "flashy" with mean daily flows, which can increase 
up to 150% or more from one day to the next. This is due mainly to the very shallow soils in the 
study area, exposed bedrock and very little moisture retention capability from these materials. 

As illustrated, the largest number of peak floods occurs during the months of April and May, 
then again in November and December.

Cape Ray Technical Report February 08, 2017 
 

20.1.6.1 Local Area Hydrology and Water Quality 

All sub-watersheds within the project area report directly to the Isle aux Morts River. There 
appear to be only two small sub-watersheds within the project footprint that would potentially 
be affected by project activities, and the current temporary work camp sits on the height of land 
that separates them. Surface water runoff north of the camp flows directly to the river via a 
small stream. Surface water to the south of the camp collects in a series of four small-
interconnected bogs that also eventually report to the river but take a much more elongated 
flow path. The Isle aux Morts River is directly north of the property and difficult to access. From 
visual observations made from a distance it appeared to have a relatively high and fast flow with 
a series of riffles and pools along the length of river adjacent to the property. 

The Project will utilize existing ponds for water and tailings storage as illustrated in Figure 20-5. 
The final option for this has yet to be determined pending baseline hydrology studies to be 
completed in 2017. The preferred option at this stage is utilizing the small pond northeast of the 
access road for tailings and wastewater storage. This would create the smallest footprint in 
terms of sub-watershed area utilized out of the entire Isle aux Morts River watershed. This small 
pond reports to a series of larger ponds that eventually report to the Isle aux Morts River by way 
of Jack Henry's Brook 3.8 km downstream. These smaller ponds would be utilized as polishing 
ponds or emergency ponds in the event of an unplanned discharge. Control structures would be 
constructed at the outlet of the tailings storage pond and the emergency pond.  

Currently, ground water from the existing underground workings (flooded adit), flows into a 
perimeter collection ditch then into a series of settling ponds which then discharge to a small un-
named brook which flows into the Isle aux Morts River. Water samples were obtained by 
Nordmin staff in September of 2014 from several locations along this collection system for the 
purposes of assessing water quality leaving the site. Samples were obtained from the portal 
entrance, north drainage ditch; south drainage ditch and the polishing pond overflow which 
reports to the Isle aux Morts River. The results of this sampling campaign are summarized in 
Table 20-3 Water quality currently discharging from the property is good and there are no 
exceedances of CCME criteria for the protection of aquatic life or the Newfoundland and 
Labrador Environmental Control and Sewage Regulation 65/03. A broader baseline surface water 
monitoring program was undertaken in 2015 during exploration activities at the site and again 
there were no exceedances of Reg. 65/03 criteria. These results are shown below in Table 20-4 
and Table 20-5. The location of the water quality monitoring stations is shown in Figure 20-6. A 
baseline water quality assessment of all water bodies for EA purposes is scheduled to be 
implemented at the site and regional study area in 2017 in support of the EA and permitting 
process.

20.1.7 Hydrogeology 

There are no historical records for hydrogeology in the regional area surrounding the Project 
Site. As part of the EA process and Environmental Baseline data collection program, these 
surveys will be conducted as per previously issued EIS Guidelines for similar mineral 
development projects in NL. The surveys will take place in 2017 or 2018 and the data included in 
the EIS or EPR submissions to the government of NL. 

20.1.8 Fish and Fish Habitat 

Information on fish and fish habitat within the surface waters of the regional study area was 
gleaned from component study reports prepared by the previous owners of the site. Although 
this data is dated (1989/90) it is still of relevance and will be augmented by further fishery 
baseline studies to be conducted by Nordmin at the site in 2017 and 2018 as part of the EA and 
permitting process.  

Historical data indicates that species reported to be present in the Isle aux Morts River are; 
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and American eel (Anguilla 
rostrate). The river was considered to be completely obstructed 3.2 km from the mouth until the 
two falls were channelized by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) in 1961 and is now 
considered unobstructed clear to the headwaters.  

Salmon angling data for 2012 for the Isle aux Morts River, collected by DFO revealed that a total 
of 177 individual fish were either captured and retained, or released (small and large) over a 
total of 289 rod/days. This resulted in a catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of 0.61. The river is 
considered to be an important angling river by DFO although fishing effort is restricted to the 
lower 5 km of river. The removal of the obstructions in 1961 has not dramatically changed the 
success rate or harvest. The 2012 angling data was compared to historical catch and CPUE data 
(1952 – 1990) and revealed that individual numbers of fish caught or released has remained 
fairly constant (mean = 172 vs. 177), while the CPUE has increased (mean = 0.42 vs. 0.61). This 
may be due to the fact that commercial fishing for salmon was suspended in 1984.  

Brook trout are fished in the watershed but mostly in ponds and brooks near the lower reaches 
of the river.  

Fish community data were collected in 1989 by the previous owners as part of the component 
studies and involved backpack electrofishing of the small brooks and ponds as well as in the river 
and overnight gill net sets in the deeper ponds. This effort produced 123 Atlantic salmon, 2 
brook trout and 1 American eel. These were all captured in the Isle aux Morts River and the 
lower reaches of Jack Henry's Brook. Most of the salmon captured (52%) were young of the year 
(age 0+) with the remainder (36%) being either yearlings (age 1+) or 2 year old fish (12%). 

The two brook trout that were captured were taken in the lower reaches of Jack Henry's Brook 
just upstream of the confluence with the Isle aux Morts River. Age of the specimens was 
estimated to be 0+ and 1+. The single American eel was captured in the river.

Gill net sets in the deeper ponds to the south of the proposed mine site did not produce any fish. 
Electroshocking of the interconnecting streams, shoreline areas and shallower sections of these 
ponds also did not produce any fish. Level of effort was not recorded so a CPUE could not be 
calculated for these surveys.  

20.1.8.1 Fish Habitat 

Fish habitat mapping was also undertaken as part of the fishery resource component studies 
conducted in 1989 by the previous owners and is summarized below. Habitat mapping was 
completed on the entire length of the Isle aux Morts River from the mouth at the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence to the headwaters upstream of the proposed mine site. The river forks into two 
branches approximately 6 km upstream from the mouth; the Main Stem branch and the Big 
Pond branch.  

The main stem of the Isle aux Morts comprises 12 sections of river each of which can be 
categorized into five main habitat types. They are (moving from upstream to downstream): 

i. Section 1 – described as wide well defined channel with steep banks for the first four 
kilometers of the river. Shoreline is mainly bedrock and heavily wooded with mature 
spruce and alder that provide some instream cover. Average water depth is one metre 
or more with some cobble and gravel bars that would be exposed during low flow 
periods. This section of river has some holding pools and is subject to the highest fishing 
pressure as the upstream areas are difficult to access on foot. The spawning habitat type 
could be characterized as Type I and II good for spawning and rearing of salmonid 
species.  

ii. Section 2 – described as a narrow stretch of rapids and chutes with a substrate of mainly 
bedrock. The banks are steep and also bedrock with steep vertical cliffs. There are many 
rapids, riffles and chutes along these sections but they do not pose as an obstacle to 
upstream migration. The spawning habitat types can be characterized as Type II, good 
for rearing and III, mostly falls or rapids which are not optimal areas for spawning or 
rearing. 

iii. Section 3 – described as a wide shallow stretch of river with some slow riffle sections 
and an average depth of less than one metre. The average width is 20 m with low banks 
composed of boulders, cobble and sod with a gentle back slope. The substrate in this 
section of the river is mainly cobble, gravel and boulders with some exposed bars. There 
is limited shoreline cover and the spawning habitat is Type II and some Type I areas.  

iv. Section 4 – this section is described as having several braided channels with large 
wooded islands in the middle of the river. The water depth is shallow (< 1m) and is 
boulder strewn with large banks that would be exposed during low flow periods. The 
shoreline areas are gently sloping and treed with spruce and alder providing some shade 
and overhead cover. River substrate here is mainly cobble and gravel which provide 
good areas for spawning and rearing for salmonid species (Type I and II). 

v. Section 5 – this section is defined as being boulder strewn with an ill-defined streambed. 
The banks are barren plateau areas indicative of the upper watershed areas of the river 
with boulders and rock providing the only cover. This section is poor spawning and 
rearing habitat and is probably not utilized by anadromous salmon or trout. This section

is typical of the numerous rivulets and small streams that drain the highland regions of 
this watershed.  
 

The Big Pond branch of the Isle aux Morts River comprises habitats similar to those described 
above, with some Type I and II spawning habitats at the section closest to the confluence with 
the main stem. Upstream of this point is the limit for migrating salmonids due to physical 
barriers however there are still good rearing areas for trout. 

20.1.9 Wildlife 

Little current information exists on the wildlife common to the Project site and surrounding 
areas however, some information was obtained from the Environmental Preview Report for the 
proposed mine access road that was prepared by the previous owners in 1988. Most of this 
information is anecdotal in nature or based on personal communication with local residents or 
outfitters. Some information was gathered from game harvesting records as well. This 
information is summarized below. 

20.1.9.1 Large Mammals  

Three species of big game are known to inhabit the Project site and surrounding areas. They are: 
black bear (Ursus americanus), woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus), and moose (Alces alces). 
Although no detailed information is available on black bear populations in the area, sightings are 
common but they are not considered to be abundant in the Project area.  

Woodland caribou are by far the most abundant big game in the Project area and surrounding 
territories however the two major herds (La Poile, and Long Range Barrens) listed in the 
information available showed that they exist mainly 50 -60 km and 30 -40 km respectively from 
the proposed mine site. However, some of these caribou migrate south to the Burnt Island Pond 
area to calve in the spring which is approximately 10 km east of the proposed mine site. 

Although some moose habitat does exist in the Project area, it is considered marginal and 
confined to the river valleys where there is some forest cover. Moose herd numbers are 
unknown but 1988 harvest records show that the two local outfitters harvested 15 moose each 
during the season.  

20.1.9.2 Small and Furbearing mammals 

Very little data exists on small game and furbearing mammals in the immediate Project Area but 
information obtained from historical reports suggest that the area provides habitat for the 
following species: arctic hare (Lepus arcticus), willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), snowshoe 
hare (Lepus americanus), rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), muskrat 
(Ondatra gibethicus), mink (Mustela vison), ermine (Mustela erminea), beaver (Castor 
Canadensis), and otter (Lutra Canadensis).

20.1.10 Avifauna 

There is some historical information available on raptor resources in the Project area from the 
component study report prepared by the previous owners and this is summarized below. 
Information on waterfowl and passerines is not available other than anecdotal references in 
some reports that the area may be used by migrating waterfowl in the spring and fall and that 
waterfowl production in the proposed Project area is not considered significant. 

Aerial and ground surveys for large raptors were conducted by the previous owners in 1989 as 
part of the resource component studies. Aerial surveys covering 100 % of the study area and 
ground surveys covering approximately 30 km of ground within an 8 km radius of the proposed 
mine site and along the access road were conducted during early June of 1989. Ground surveys 
involved the use of tape recorded raptor calls to evoke a vocal response if any raptors were 
present.  

The results of the surveys revealed the presence of only one species of raptor. Two ospreys 
(Pandion haliaetus) were sighted during one of the ground surveys. No other raptors were 
sighted or responded to any of the raptor calls. 

Although only one species of raptor was noted during these surveys, the Project area would 
likely be frequented by other raptor species for hunting , nesting or overwintering such as Bald 
Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus), American Rough-legged 
Hawk (Buteo lagopus), Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentiles), Sharp-shinned Hawk (Accipiter 
striatus), American Kestrel ( Falco sparverius), Merlin (Falco columbarius), Great Horned Owl 
(Bubo virginianus), Northern Hawk Owk (Surnia ulula), Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus), and 
Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus). There is currently no data available on migratory birds on or near 
the Project site. This data will be collected for the EIS. 

20.2 Human Environment 

20.2.1 Historic and Heritage Resources 

There are no known designated environmentally sensitive or cultural heritage sites within the 
Project lands. Aboriginal consultation, as well as biological and archaeological assessment work 
that is planned as part of the EA process will identify any environmentally sensitive sites and 
cultural heritage sites. An objective of the on-going consultation process with the engaged 
Aboriginal communities is anticipated to result in the identification of such sites so that they can 
be considered for preservation during the EA and Project planning process. 

A Stage 1 Archaeological Assessment of the Project lands and road corridor will be completed as 
part of the baseline studies to be undertaken as part of the EA process. This assessment would 
be conducted by a licensed archaeologist, in accordance with requirements of the Government 
of NL, with full participation and involvement by the surrounding First Nations to the extent that 
they are willing to participate.

20.3 Consultation Overview 

Nordmin has identified the following government agencies, Aboriginal groups and other public 
stakeholders with whom Project consultation or notification would likely be required. They are 
listed below. In addition, staff at the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency in Halifax, the 
Newfoundland and Labrador Environmental Assessment Agency and previous consultants 
involved in past studies of the Project site were consulted in the preparation of this Project 
Description report and their feedback was taken into consideration in the completion of this 
document. No other consultation has taken place to date with respect to the EA for this Project.  

A final list of government agencies, aboriginal communities and stakeholders to be notified or 
consulted will be issued by CEAA and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador. 

Federal Government: 

 Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency; 

 Fisheries and Oceans Canada; 

 Environment Canada; 

 Natural Resources Canada; and, 

 Transport Canada – Navigable Waters Protection Act 

Provincial Government: 

 Government of Newfoundland and Labrador – Environmental Assessment Division; 

 Government of Newfoundland and Labrador – Department of Natural Resources; 

 Service Newfoundland; and, 

 Labrador and Aboriginal Affairs Office 

Local Governments: 

 Town of Isle aux Morts; 

 Town of Port aux Basques; and, 

 Town of Rose Blanche 

Aboriginal Communities: 

 The Mi'kmaq Community; 

 The Qalipu First Nation; and, 

 The Miawpukek First Nation 
 

With respect to consultation with Aboriginal organizations, Nordmin will work closely with the 
Labrador and Aboriginal Affairs Office (LAAO) to establish consultation guidelines and a list of 
communities that will be consulted with. Further, we will also follow the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador's Aboriginal Consultation Policy on Land and Resource 
Development Decisions (April 2013).

20.3.1 Aboriginal, Community Consultation and Social Requirements 

Aboriginal and community engagement will be an integral part of the Environmental Assessment 
process should the project move forward. Consultation plans will be developed for Aboriginal 
groups, local communities and other interested persons including NGO's and implemented to 
provide feedback on social and community impacts from the project.  

In addition to community meetings, Aboriginal organizations and the public will have several 
opportunities for participation and feedback during the EA process. The project proponent will 
also provide current information to the communities most likely affected by the project as early 
as possible and at key points of the project development. This will ensure that all stakeholders 
have an opportunity to gain an understanding of the proposed Project and may facilitate their 
continued involvement in the EA process. 

A record of all consultation efforts will be kept which will describe key stakeholder groups, 
summarize comments heard, and identify key issues of concern and responses. 

20.3.2 Governmental Consultation 

Consultation with government agencies will be scheduled at key points during the EA process 
and project development.  

The following government agencies will be engaged as required by the EA process and for 
general project updates on an ongoing basis: 

Newfoundland and Labrador Government: 

 Department of Environment and Conservation – Environmental Assessment Division 

 Department of Natural Resources – Mineral Lands Division  

Federal Government: 

 Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) 

 Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) 

Municipal Governments: 

 Municipalities of Port aux Basques and Isle aux Morts 

20.4 Potential Environmental Constraints to Development 

The following sections describe possible constraints to development of the property and, are 
based solely on visual observations and literature available on the site. These may or may not be 
mitigated through good management and sustainable development practices but this would 
require further investigation and collection of empirical data from the site though baseline 
environmental assessment studies.

20.4.1 Proximity to the Isle aux Morts River 

As stated previously, previous studies have shown that this river is utilized by Atlantic salmon for 
spawning purposes and is a designated Scheduled Salmon River by the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans Canada. The present mine workings (adit, ore/waste rock pile, collection ditching 
and ponds) are within 900 metres of the river and are currently discharging directly into it. The 
location of the open pit mines would likely be within 500 metres of the river. If spawning (and 
early life cycle stage) salmon are utilizing the section of the river proximate to the site, water 
would likely have to be treated and pumped into the watershed south of the mine camp site. 
This may be a requirement regardless of salmon activity but would depend on the quality of the 
water discharging from the adit and coming into contact with the ore/waste rock piles. 
Geochemistry data suggests the waste rock is potentially acid generating. This will be mitigated 
through proper engineering design of waste rock pads and following best management practices 
for water management/treatment. 

20.5 Environmental Assessment and Permitting 

In the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, proposed resource development projects may 
be subject to provincial and/or environmental assessment legislation. 

Under the provincial Environmental Protection Act (EPA, 2002), the proponent of a project that 
could have significant effects on the natural, social or economic environment is required to 
register this project or undertaking for examination under the provincial EA process. Under the 
EPA, the project or undertaking is subject to Part 10 of the EPA and pursuant to Section 33(2) of 
the associated Environmental Assessment Regulations (EAR, 2013) which states: 

33(2) "An undertaking that will be engaged in the mining, beneficiating and preparing of a 
mineral as defined in the Mineral Act whether or not these operations are to be performed in 
conjunction with a mine or at mills that will be operated separately shall be registered." 

Following a 45 day public and governmental review of this EA Registration, the Minister of 
Environment and Conservation will make a determination whether the project may proceed, 
subject to terms and conditions or if further EA review and obligations are warranted.  

The Cape Ray Gold Project has already undergone the 45 day public and ministerial review and it 
was concluded that an EIS would be required under the provincial Environmental Protection Act. 
Final EIS Guidelines have been issued for the Project. 

Under CEAA 2012, if the project or undertaking is captured by the Regulations Designating 
Physical Activities, a project description must be submitted which then undergoes a 45 day 
screening process to determine if a federal EA is required.  

This Project Description has been developed to satisfy Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
requirements, as the Cape Ray Gold Project meets the definition of a designated project that 
may require a federal EA, pursuant to the Regulations Designating Physical Activities. This

regulation identifies that gold mines with ore production capacity of 600 t/d or more, as stated 
in Section 16(c) of the Act: The construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of a 
new rare earth element mine or gold mine, other than a placer mine, with an ore production 
capacity of 600 t/day or more. 

As the Cape Ray Gold Project exceeds the or production capacity thresholds described in the 
Regulations Designating Physical Activities, a Project Description has been submitted to the CEA 
Agency for determination of whether a federal EA is required. After a 45 day internal and public 
review it has been determined that a federal EA is required and Draft EIS Guidelines have been 
issued.  

Nordmin is currently in the process of advancing the EA and has retained a consulting group in 
NL to assist with the EA. Environmental baseline studies are planned for 2017 and 2018 with a 
planned EIS submission date in late 2018. Project permitting will be undertaken concurrent with 
EA activities to facilitate an early start of construction.  

20.6 Environmental Management and Protection 

Nordmin will develop a comprehensive environmental, health and safety (EHS) management 
system to address the EHS needs of the Project based on the results of the Environmental 
Impact Statement. The range of plans and programs comprising the EHS Management System 
will likely include:  

 Environmental Protection Plan – addressing environmental protection and pollution 
prevention practices; 

 Emergency Response and Contingency Plan – addressing situations of accidents, 
malfunctions and unplanned events; 

 Environmental Awareness and Education Plan – addressing worker and visitor needs 
with respect to species of concern, sensitive areas and sensitive periods for fisheries, 
wildlife and cultural resources in the Project area; 

 Community Engagement Plan – addressing information sharing, identification of issues 
and concerns, and optimizing employment and business benefits; 

 Monitoring and Follow-up Plan – addressing regulatory compliance monitoring 
requirements with respect to conditions of permits, authorizations and approvals as well 
as any identified follow-up needed as a result of the EIS findings 

 Auditing and Continuous Improvement Plan – addressing overall EHS performance and 
striving for continuous improvement in EHS matters. 

20.7 Other Required Environmental Approvals and Permits

20.8 Requirements and Plans for Waste & Tailings Disposal, Site Monitoring and Water 
Management 

20.8.1 Waste Rock Management 

The volume of waste rock produced is highly dependent the final pit design, project economics, 
and deposit geology. Waste rock material will be stockpiled near the pit it was excavated from 
on an engineered pad if it is acid generating. The potential for acid generation for waste rock 
materials is unknown. There is a test program currently underway to determine acid generation 
potential. Any potentially acid generating (PAG) materials will require a NPAG (non-potentially 
acid generating) pad and either need to be relocated back to the pit once it is complete, or 
covered to reduce the acid generation potential. Some waste rock materials which are non-acid 
generating will be required to build roads, pads for buildings, and laydown areas. 

20.8.2 Tailings Management 

The Tailings Management Facility (TMF) and effluent treatment plant will be designed to 
withstand a 100 year rain or snow event. The TMF would cover an area of approximately 3.8 ha 
and provides adequate storage capacity for the approximately 1.2M m3 of tailings anticipated to 
be produced over the projected mine life. The average rate of deposition of tails is 285k t/yr. at a 
density of 1.5 t/m3. The TMF construction of the dams and buttresses will utilize mine waste 
rock or quarried rock from a nearby location. Tailings would be deposited from spigots located 
along the ridge of the TMF. Process water would be draw from the TMF area. If required to 
control water levels in the TMF, effluent water would be treated and discharged to the polishing 
pond, refer to Figure 20-5 for the TMF location. There is currently a small ephemeral bog where 
there TMF will be constructed but based on historical data it is not a fish bearing water body and 
would not be considered fish habitat. In addition, physical barriers, intermittent flow and 
elevation difference between this bog and the Isle aux Morts River would prevent any upstream 
migration of fish. 

Tailings from mill operations (after CN destruction process) will be handled by conventional 
methods and disposed of in an engineered Tailings Management Facility (TMF). The tailings and 
wastewater will be pumped to the TMF via a slurry pipeline. 

Tailings will normally be thickened to around 35-40 % solids via the thickener and disc filter prior 
to discharge within the TMF. This practice will reduce the size of the TMF supernatant pond, 
reduce seepage, minimize or eliminate liquid-solids separation, improve the physical stability of 
the TMF and reduce both the risk and consequences associated with a potential failure. During 
thickened tailings deposition, discharge points will be frequently re-located to maximize the size 
of the wetted surface, thereby minimizing fugitive dust. In addition, tackifier and/or binder may 
be added to discharge tailings to bind particles together and minimize entrainment by wind and 
a flocculent will be added to the tailings stream to promote settling of solids.  

Late in the life of the mine, tailings solids may be dewatered in the mill to <15 % moisture 
content and mechanically placed within the TMF footprint using conventional heavy equipment.

Project # 14200-11 NORDMIN ENGINEERING LTD. Page 238 of 351 
Cape Ray Technical Report February 08, 2017 
 

The TMF supernatant pond and wastewater treatment plant will be designed to withstand a 30 
day duration, 1 in 100 year rain on snow event. The TMF will be equipped with an engineered 
spillway to prevent a potential dam failure due to overtopping during a Probable Maximum 
Precipitation ("PMP") event.  

The preliminary TMF design has storage capacity of 1.2M m3 of tailings solids, with the 
possibility to increase in the future by raising the height, concurrent with any requirements for 
amendments to necessary approvals. The TMF surface footprint is not anticipated to be 
materially changed as a result of any future raises. The TMF will be constructed, operated, 
maintained and monitored in accordance with Guide to the Management of Tailings Facilities 
(MAC, 2011) and Environment Canada (2009). 

Decanted water from the TMF will then pass through the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), 
which will treat to provincial and federal effluent criteria (process described in Section 20.8). 
Treated effluent will then report to a series of small bogs before discharging to the environment 
via a natural flow path that eventually discharges to the Isle aux Morts River. Based on historical 
data these bogs would not be considered fish bearing waters and there is no potential for 
upstream migration of fish from the river due to physical barriers, intermittent flow and 
elevation differences. The approximate linear distance of stream between the TMF discharge 
point to the river is four kilometres. Water quality monitoring stations will be established at fixed 
points along this stream and sampled on a monthly basis.  

Run off from the watershed surrounding the TMF will be collected in a perimeter intercept ditch, 
which will be constructed around the base of the TMF. The interception ditches will be 
excavated in bedrock or glacial till lined with rock to mitigate erosion. All runoff water from 
these intercept ditches will report to the polishing ponds (Figure 3.5). 

At closure, the TMF and plant sites will be covered with an engineered, low-permeability dry 
cover that will minimize infiltration of water. Seepage collection around the TMF will continue 
post closure until the seepage decreases and no longer poses a risk to the environment.  

20.8.3 Mine Water Management 

The thin (<2m) layers of overburden that have been observed at the Project site are interpreted 
to be permeable compared to the underlying competent bedrock and the hydrogeology of the 
Project site is predominantly bedrock controlled. Groundwater flow is currently assumed to be 
primarily through the overburden units and similar to surface drainage within the Project area; 
primarily originating at the heights of land and flowing radially downslope.  

The proponent will gather additional field data (i.e. slug testing and/or packer testing to 
determine bulk conductivity of bedrock mass; similar testing to determine bulk conductivity, 
sustained yield and drawdown from any potentially affected overburden units) to develop a 
hydrogeological model to predict the zone of influence that is created by the mine dewatering 
and estimate dewatering volumes. It is not anticipated that there will be any significant effects 
to the water table of the Property and therefore no effects to existing groundwater users. There 
are no users of groundwater in the vicinity of the Property and the primary function of

groundwater is to provide base flow in surrounding watercourse features. The baseline work 
completed to date does not indicate the presence of upwellings or other groundwater 
discharges that support significant fish habitat, but additional work is planned in this regard, so 
that any potential impacts can be identified and mitigated. Due to the tight bedrock conditions 
observed to date and the absence of deep, continuous overburden deposits to connect the pit 
shell with surrounding watercourses, the potential for mine dewatering to affect potential 
groundwater upwellings in surface watercourses is interpreted to be low. 

20.8.4 Open Pit De-watering 

During the life of the open pit, a sump (that is founded in bedrock) will be carried in the floor of 
the pit to contain runoff, direct precipitation and the groundwater seepage that will enter the pit 
because much of the excavation will be done below the water table. The sump will serve as a 
primary treatment pond to achieve the treatment listed below, if required.  

 Settling of suspended solids and potential chemical conditioning (coagulant and/or 
flocculant addition). Metals will not be precipitated in the sump. 

 Potential addition of commercially available ammonia oxidizing bacteria to reduce the 
concentration of ammonia that would be present due to the use of explosives. 

 Potential attenuation of hydrocarbons using sorbent materials and/or the use of 
hydrocarbon degrading enzymes.  
 

The sump will also serve as a surge pond to equalize the flows of water being pumped from the 
pit to the treatment system and/or process water tanks (for recycling) and/or release to the 
environment. 

The potential for the pit shell to have a strong hydraulic connection (i.e. through overburden) to 
proximal surface watercourses or aquifers is interpreted as low. However, additional field 
investigations will be conducted to determine the potential for seepage from these features to 
enter the pit so that adaptive management plans can be developed and implemented as may be 
required during the life of the Project. The adaptive management plan may include, but not 
necessarily be limited to the measures listed in the bullets listed below. 

 Low-permeability cut off walls installed in overburden to reduce the hydraulic 
connectivity between the pit and the water feature.  

 Targeted grouting program to install a grout curtain in bedrock to reduce groundwater 
seepage entering the pit. 

 Groundwater interception wells to intercept overburden and/or bedrock groundwater 
before it enters the pit. 

 Groundwater and/or surface water interception trenches to intercept overburden 
groundwater and surface water before it enters the pit. 
 

As the development of open pit(s) is not anticipated to create a strong hydraulic connection with 
any surface water features or aquifers, no dewatering wells surrounding the pit are planned. 
Sometimes this strategy is employed at "wet pits" to create a drawdown cone surrounding open

pit developments to intercept groundwater before it enters the pit and typically allow direct 
discharge of this water to the environment. 

A hydrogeological model will be developed to predict the volume of groundwater that will enter 
the workings as part of the environmental assessment and permitting process. 

20.8.5 Site Run Off Water 

Water collecting on the site in the form of precipitation or seepages will be collected by 
perimeter intercept ditches that will be installed around the site including waste rock and over 
burden piles. Water collected in the ditches will be pumped to the TMF for treatment and 
discharge. 

20.8.6 Water Treatment 

Wastewater (i.e. mine water, grey water, treated sewage from domestic sewage systems, 
backwash water from potable water treatment plants, collected runoff that has contacted 
process materials, wash water, etc.) will be consolidated in the Tailings Management Facility 
("TMF"). This water will be recycled for use in the mine and the mill. Surplus water in the TMF 
will be treated to meet provincial effluent criteria as well as federal requirements pursuant to 
the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations. Treatment steps and water treatment strategies that are 
currently anticipated are summarized in the bullets below.  

 Control of contaminants at the source through good housekeeping practices that 
minimize hydrocarbon. 

 Implementation of an ammonia control program to reduce ammonia in mine water. 
Components of the ammonia control program would include, but not necessarily be 
limited to, low solubility product selection, minimization of spillage, promote efficient 
blasting practices. 

 Deployment of hydrocarbon degrading enzymes in sumps and in the TMF as needed. 

 Use of ammonia oxidizing bacteria in sumps and in the TMF as needed. 

 Use of coagulants and/or flocculants (i.e. chemical conditioning) to remove total 
suspended solids either in a pond or in a clarifier. Sludge from this treatment step would 
be placed in the TMF. 

 Additional chemical conditioning (i.e. metal precipitants that work at neutral pH) and/or 
pH adjustment to precipitate metals as low solubility hydroxides. Sludge from this 
treatment step would be consolidated and managed to minimize any environmental risk 
from potential metal leaching. 

 Filtration, following the chemical conditioning step, to remove suspended solids and 
metal precipitates.  

 Final pH adjustment through the addition of carbon dioxide or acid (i.e. citric, 
hydrochloric or sulphuric) to within regulatory limits. 

 Aeration and biological treatment of residual ammonia to oxidize any nitrites or other 
contaminants that could be present.

Any treatment steps that are deemed unnecessary based on operating experience and empirical 
evidence, would be by-passed. 

Cyanide would be destroyed in tailings slurry before it leaves the mill building envelope. 
Although additional engineering is required, this would likely be achieved using the well-
established S02-air process. The by-product of this process of most concern would be ammonia, 
which would be produced through the hydrolysis of cyanate. 

20.8.7 Discharge Point to Surface Water Receiver 

Treated mine water from the TMF will pass through two polishing ponds which discharge to a 
small brook that eventually reports to the Isle aux Morts River approximately 4kms downstream. 
At the time of the preparation of this report a site wide water balance had not yet been 
completed, however, it is anticipated that this would be a seasonal discharge, releasing effluent 
only during the ice-free periods of the year (May to November).  

An assimilative capacity assessment of the receiver will be undertaken during the permitting 
phase of the project to determine effluent limits that will not impact the ambient water quality 
in the Isle aux Morts River. 

20.8.8 Potable Water 

Raw water will be filtered and disinfected in accordance with regulatory requirements and good 
engineering practices. Water will report to a surge tank and then distributed to areas of the 
Project site where potable water is required. Backwash water from the potable water treatment 
systems will report to the TMF. 

20.9 Mine Decommissioning and Closure 

The objectives of mine closure activities, as will be outlined in the Closure Plan are to return the 
site to a natural condition as soon as possible upon cessation of mining activities and to ensure 
the long term chemical and physical stability of the site post-closure.  

Remediation and reclamation activities are designed to minimize and reduce the duration of any 
impacts to the local receiving environment from past mining activities. These include the closing 
and rehabilitation of the mine and tailings management facilities and the immediate dismantling 
of all unnecessary infrastructure.  

A monitoring program will also be implemented post-closure to ensure the long term 
performance of the restoration measures, and to put into effect, remedial action if necessary. 
The monitoring program will also include continuous characterization and control of the surface 
waters throughout the various project sites as well as the quality of the soils and the 
sustainability of the permafrost after closure and restoration activities have been completed. 
Campaigns for the collection of surface water and soil samples, as well as visual inspections of 
reclamation sites will be implemented.

The monitoring program will be carried out over a ten year period after closure of the mine.  

Total cost for all closure activities is estimated to be $56,660,579.00. A financial guarantee will 
be paid annually to the Minister of Finance of Newfoundland and Labrador. 

20.9.1 Mine Closure and Decommissioning Activities 

The rehabilitation measures that are being developed are intended for walk-away closure. 
Rehabilitation activities will be completed within approximately 36 months from the 
commencement of closure and the major activities are summarized below in general 
chronological order. 

 Buildings, trailers, intermodal shipping containers, storage tanks, equipment and any 
chemicals/consumables will be removed and salvaged, recycled or disposed of in 
accordance with applicable legislation. Concrete foundations will be demolished to 
grade as is necessary and used to backfill local depressions. 

 Hydrocarbon contaminated soil will be identified and remediated in accordance with 
applicable legislation. 

 Equipment in the pit workings will be purged of all operating fluids and salvaged to the 
maximum extent practical. Consumables will be removed from the pit workings and 
salvaged. 

 The open pits will be backfilled with clean NAG rock, overburden replaced and surface 
areas will be revegetated with native plant species. 

 The haulage roads between the pits and on surface along with waste rock and ore pads 
will be removed and the areas revegetated with native plant species. 

 Pipelines (water, compressed air) on the site will be flushed with fresh water or air, 
plugged and left in place. Fuel pipelines (propane, diesel) will be decommissioned with 
legislative requirements and good engineering standards as applicable. 

 The domestic sewage disposal system components will be salvaged. The septic tank will 
be purged of its contents by a licensed hauler and backfilled with locally available soil 
and/or rock.  

 Remaining liquid and solid waste at the Project site will be removed for recycling or 
disposal with licensed contractors in accordance legislative requirements. 

 Rock, sludge and tailings that pose a risk of acid generation and/or metal leaching will be 
consolidated during the life of the mine and managed in accordance with best industry 
practice.  

 Areas of the Project site that are overlain with (clean) development rock will be scarified 
and any modest embankments will be sloped to a minimum of 3H:1V for long-term 
physical stability. Accumulations of soil sized particles in the crevasses of rock 
embankments will be planted with native tree seedlings in accordance with established 
silvicultural practices. Native soil from the established stockpiles on the site will be 
placed over these prepared areas and the area will be re-vegetated.  

 The power line, electrical distribution infrastructure and substation will be removed and 
re-used to the extent practical.

21.  Capital and Operating Costs 

Preparation of the capital cost estimates are based on the Nordmin's philosophy that 
emphasizes accuracy over contingency and uses defined and proven project execution 
strategies. The estimates were developed by using first principles and applying direct applicable 
project experience, and by avoiding the use of general industry factors. Virtually all of the 
estimate inputs are derived from engineers, contractors, and suppliers who have provided 
similar services to existing operations and have demonstrated success in executing the plans as 
defined in the PEA. The target accuracy of the capital cost estimate is in the range of +20%/-20%.  

The following cost estimates are detailed within this section: 

 Initial Capital Cost – Major costs incurred in constructing the Mill and Tailing 
Management Facilities (TMF).  

 Sustaining Capital Cost – Expenditures incurred during operations for waste 
development, underground set-up and underground infrastructure for deposit 04, 51 
and 41. 

 Closure and Reclamation Cost – Costs incurred to permanently close and reclaim the site 

The following capital costs are not discussed in this section: 

 Sunk Costs – Not considered in this PEA. 

 Owners Reserve – Not considered in this PEA. 

It is assumed that Contractors will be used for all deposits for the specific scope and execution 
plans described in this PEA. Any deviations from these plans will affect the capital costs. 

The following costs are not included in the capital cost estimate: 

 HST 

 Schedule acceleration costs 

 Schedule delays and associated costs, such as those caused by: 
- Unexpected site conditions 
- Latent ground conditions 
- Force majeure 
- Permit applications 

 Development fees and approval costs beyond those specifically identified 

 Cost of any disruption to normal operations 

 Foreign currency changes from project exchange rates 

 Commodity specific escalation rates 

 Event risk 

 Cost associated with third party delays 

 Sunk costs 

 Escalation – all cost data is presented in Canadian 2015 dollars.

Certain items within the operating costs begin during the pre-production phase and continue 
through the life of the mine. All costs incurred during the pre-production phase have been 
capitalized and are part of the capital cost estimate under sustaining capital. Operating costs 
have been compiled in accordance with industry standards. 

The pre-production capital expenditures have an internal contingency of 10%. The estimates are 
based on budget pricing from suppliers for critical components, consultants, contractors and a 
review of other Canadian projects. Smaller equipment and facilities component costs were 
factored based on industry norms for the type of facility being constructed and, where possible, 
adjusted to reflect local conditions.  Table 21.1 summarizes the pre-production capital 
expenditures.

The sustaining capital expenditures by deposit do not have any contingency. Included in these 
expenditures are the initial cost to start-up each deposit as well as ramp development for the 
underground mine. In the open pits, the expenditures include initial setup as well as overburden 
and first pioneer benching (see Table 21-2).

All the operating costs are based on typical Canadian prices from contractors, suppliers and 
other similar type Canadian projects, for consumables and parts. The cost of power is based on 
rates charged by Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro for similar sized power consumers and 
services in the province. Labour costs for the operating period are based on the manpower 
schedules presented for each department and their associated labour costs. The costs include a 
burden component of 25-30%. All costs are quoted in constant 2016 Canadian Dollars.

Both operating costs include the expenditures for direct mining related labour and supervision. 
Geology and engineering staff costs are provided as G&A within each mining method. The vision 
of this PEA is to use contractors for both Open Pit and underground operations. The processing 
cost is expected to be $23.46 per tonne of potentially economic mineralization based on 
preliminary discussions with custom milling operations. A breakdown of the processing cost is 
presented in Section 17.

22.  Economic Analysis 

The PEA is based on Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources. The Inferred Resources are 
preliminary and generally considered to be too speculative to be categorized as Mineral 
Reserves beyond a Preliminary Economic Analysis. Due to the uncertainty that may be attached 
to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral 
Resource will be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of 
continued exploration. Confidence in the estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful 
application of technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic 
viability worthy of public disclosure. 

An engineering economic model was developed to estimate annual cash flows and sensitivities. 
Pre-tax estimates of project values were prepared for comparative purposes, while after-tax 
estimates were developed to approximate the true investment value. It must be noted the tax 
estimates involve many complex variables that can only be accurately calculated during 
operations and, as such, the after-tax results are only approximations. 

For the cash-flow, gold price of US$1,306/oz., silver price of US$18.96/oz. and exchange rate 
US$=CAD$1.26 were considered. The processing plant recovery for gold is 98% and for silver 63% 
utilized throughout the project life.

25.  Interpretations and conclusions 

The four deposits in the Cape Ray Gold Zone comprise 04, 41, 51 and Windowglass Hill and are 
the topics of interest in this report and are included in the joint venture agreement between 
Nordmin and Benton.  

Results of the current NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate for the 04, 41, 51 and 
Windowglass Hill Deposits are presented in Table 25-1 below. The effective date of this mineral 
resource estimate is February 1, 2017. As it is still very early in the development stage and as 
mining and processing studies have not yet been finalised it is inappropriate to apply any sort of 
"mine design" as such that would imply that any contained resources can be considered 
"reserves". As a result the resources reported here are only blocks above cut-off and have had 
no mineability criteria applied to them.

1. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no 
certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resources estimated will be converted into Mineral Reserves. The 
estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 
socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues 

2. The CIM definitions were followed for the classification of Indicated, and Inferred mineral resources. 
3. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there 

has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral 
Resource. It is reasonably expected that a portion of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded with 
continued exploration. 

Historical metallurgical test campaigns align well with recent bench scale test campaigns. Under 
Benton's operation, samples were selected for metallurgical testing. At a lab scale level, 
extractable gold can be as high as 98% and extractable silver between 50 and 70% with cyanide 
leach. Gravity recoverable gold has shown potential to be greater than 80%. Further work is 
required for flowsheet development and optimization.

Cape Ray Technical Report February 08, 2017 
 

Based on the overall size and characteristics of the mineralized zones known to date, the Cape 
Ray Fault Zone has the demonstrated potential for occurrence of potentially mineable gold 
resources. However due to the geologic uncertainty, definition of the zone limits and grade 
trends require further drill definition at closely spaced intervals.

26.  Recommendations 

It is of the opinion of the authors that the property has potential to host mineable gold deposits. 
Based on the findings of this technical report, it is recommended that additional work be 
completed to advance the project to a pre-feasibility study level.  The following phased approach 
to complete the necessary work to advance the project to feasibility is recommended.  

Phase 1 consists of upgrading the on-site camp facilities, site LIDAR survey, infill and exploration 
drilling to convert additional resources from inferred to indicated and to expand the resource.  
Concurrent with drilling, desk top environmental studies hydrology and surface water baseline 
studies and geotechnical studies would be conducted to move the data to a feasibility level. The 
location of diamond drill holes that meet the requirements of the geotechnical study would be 
incorporated into the overall diamond drilling program. 

Phase 2 would include updating the geological model utilizing the new drill results, further 
environmental studies to satisfy the EIS including Geochemical testing and analysis, tailings 
design and beginning the feasibility study. 

Phase 3 would see preparation of the EIS and submission to the Newfoundland EA Division and 
CEAA, a NFLD Hydro Study, upgrades to the access road and completion of the mineral resource 
estimate and feasibility study. 

A proposed budget and timing for Phase 1,2 and 3 is shown below in Table 26-1.
