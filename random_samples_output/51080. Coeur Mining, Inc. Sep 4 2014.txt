1 SUMMARY 

M3 Engineering & Technology Corporation of Tucson, Arizona was contracted by Coeur Mining, Inc. (Coeur) to prepare 
a Feasibility Study (the FS) and an Independent Technical Report (the Report), compliant with National Instrument 43-
101 (NI 43-101) on the La Preciosa Silver-Gold Project (the Property or the Project). This section briefly summarizes 
the findings of the Feasibility Study.  

The Project is situated on the eastern flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range located approximately 85 
kilometers (km) northeast of the city of Durango, in the municipalities of Pánuco de Coronado and Canatlán, within 
Durango State, México. The property is centered on coordinates 24°25'42.4200"N Latitude and 104°27'27.2380"W 
Longitude (554,987.8815mE, 2,701,771.0046mN) in the Universal Transverse Mercator (WGS 84 datum), Zone 13R 
(Northern Hemisphere). 

The proposed Project is an open pit silver-gold mine. The mill throughput rate is estimated at 3,650 ktonnes/yr or 
10,000 dry tonnes per day (dtpd) for an 11-year life, but is reliant on other factors such as equipment productivity. Over 
the life of the Project, 106 million troy ounces of silver and 128 thousand ounces of gold are projected to be recovered. 

Coeur selected M3 Engineering & Technology Corporation (M3) and other respected third-party consultants to prepare 
mine plans, resource and reserve estimates, process plant designs, and to complete environmental studies and cost 
estimates used for this Report. All consultants have the capability to support the Project, as required and within the 
confines of expertise, from feasibility study to full operation. The costs are based on end of first quarter 2014 US dollars. 

1.1 KEY DATA 

Key project parameters are presented in Table 1-1 including a summary of the project size, production, operating costs, 
metal prices, and financial indicators.  This Project is sensitive to changes in metals pricing.  A metals pricing scenario 
of US$22/oz for silver and US$1,350/oz for gold resulted in an economic project with an approximately 11-year mine 
life.

1.2 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION  

1.2.1 Location and Access 

The Property is located approximately 85 km by existing roads, northeast of the city of Durango and can be accessed 
by vehicle from Durango in approximately 90 minutes.  A new access road is anticipated to be constructed which would 
reduce this to a distance of 50 km and a time of 45 minutes.  Durango is the capital city of Durango State and has a 
population of over 600,000.  One of the major industries in Durango is mining, particularly for silver, and the region is 
expected to be a good source of skilled personnel, support services, and mining equipment. An international airport 
serves the city of Durango with daily flights connecting to destinations within México and connections to the United 
States. Figure 1-1 shows the Project's regional location. 

Durango is situated along Mexican Federal Highway 40, which connects Durango to Mazatlán, approximately 310 km. 
to the southwest on the Pacific coast, and to Torreón, approximately 245 km to the northeast.  A railway line runs 
between Durango and Torreón and connects to other cities in Mexico and the United States.   

To get to the site from Durango, travel northeast toward Torreón by sealed Federal Highway 40, to the town of Francisco 
I. Madero.  At this point, a secondary paved road is followed northwest to the village of Lázaro Cárdenas, then by newly 
paved road to the village of Francisco R. Serrano.  After 9 km, turn and traverse a newly paved road in a southwest 
direction to the village of Francisco Javier Mina, then travel in a southerly direction for 5.5 km by gravel road to the 
access road to the Project site.  The access road is a 3.5 km gravel road heading southeast and leads to the portal of

the historic workings and the main camp of the Project.  It is to be noted that the road between Francisco Javier Mina 
and the town of Ricardo Flores Magón is in the process of being paved and should be completed in late 2014. 

A much shorter site access road is planned to go from Highway 40 directly to the site and avoid the small communities.  
This road is also anticipated to be aligned with the anticipated water pipeline route. The pursuit and acquisition of rights 
in and to necessary or convenient surface estates is ongoing.

Figure 1-1: Project Location Map 

The Property lies on the western edge of the high plains of northern México, an extensive volcanic plateau 
characterized by narrow, northwest trending ranges separated by wide, flat-floored filled basins.  In the Durango area, 
the basins have elevations of between 1,900 m to 2,100 m above mean sea level (amsl) and the higher peaks rise to 
3,000 m.  The Property elevation in the area of the mineralized zones at the Property is between 1,990 m and 2,265 
m.  The highest elevations on the Property are at the northwest trending La Preciosa Ridge, which overlies the La 
Gloria and Abundancia veins.  A broad valley forms to the east of the ridge and extends approximately 1 km toward 
another lower lying ridge to the northeast.  Grasses, small shrubs, and cactuses comprise the typical vegetation on the 
steep hillsides with larger bushes and mesquite trees in the lower lying areas near springs and streams.  Nearby 
farmers produce beans and maize with groundwater sourced from thick gravel beds in the surrounding plains or via 
dry farming during the rainy season.  Local cattle graze on land dominated by rocky soils supporting nopal (prickly 
pear) and huizache (acacia) scrubland. 

The Property area has a semi-arid climate, with an annual average temperature of about 25°C and an average annual 
precipitation of about 600 millimeters (mm), usually occurring between May and October.  Temperatures can fall below 
freezing on winter nights but snow is rare.  Mining activities can take place year round.  The dominant wind direction is 
southeast.

1.2.2 History 

In April 2013, Coeur completed the acquisition of Orko Silver Corp. (Orko), which owned the property.  The Project 
now operates as a Mexican-registered company under the name of Proyectos Mineros La Preciosa, S.A. de C. V. 
(PMLP) a wholly owned subsidiary of Coeur. Since acquisition, activities have included land and water resource 
acquisition plus additional efforts on geological and technical studies.  All involved property owners were identified and 
their titles verified to be in good standing prior to acquisition of surface rights. 

1.3 GEOLOGY  

The Project is located on the eastern flank of the Cretaceous to mid-Tertiary age Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) a 
north to southeast trending mountain range in northwestern Mexico that parallels the Pacific coast of Mexico and 
extends south from the Arizona-Sonora border to Guanajuato.  This mountain range is part of an island arc assemblage 
of early Mesozoic age consisting of metamorphosed, deep-water sedimentary rocks, and island arc volcanic rocks.  
These volcanic rocks are characterized by a thick sequence of lower Tertiary andesite units (Lower Volcanic Series) 
overlain by younger pyroclastic dominated rhyolites (Upper Volcanic Series). 

The oldest rocks in the property are Jurassic-Cretaceous metasedimentary graphitic schist, chlorite schist, and layers 
of quartzite.  Overlying the metasedimentary sequence is a thick package of unmetamorphosed polylithic conglomerate 
containing lenses of arkosic sandstone.  The sedimentary package is overlain by intermediate tuff and agglomerate of 
the regional Tertiary age Lower Volcanic Series.  Locally, the flows are porphyritic and the tuffs are partly welded.  
Post-mineralization basalt flows that erupted from several Pleistocene-age volcanic vents fill the lower valleys, and are 
the youngest rocks within the property. 

The region is transected by a regional northwest-striking San Luis-Tepehuanes fault system, which roughly coincides 
with the eastern margin of the SMO.  This fault system is a complex network of northwest- to north-striking, west-
dipping fault segments that are associated with east to northeast tilting of Tertiary stratigraphy. 

The Project area contains a series of Tertiary-age silver-bearing (±gold) low and intermediate epithermal quartz veins 
associated with adularia, barite, calcite, rhodochrosite, as well as acanthite, freibergite, silver sulfosalts and minor 
electrum, plus variable amounts of pyrite, honey-colored sphalerite, tennantite/tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite and galena, 
as well as supergene iron and manganese oxides.  Mineralization variably occurs throughout all lithologic units, with 
the exception of post-mineralization basalts and alluvium, and mineralization is preferentially concentrated in the Lower 
Volcanic Sequence and Sedimentary Sequence. 

Mineralization is present as three main types that occur as syn-mineralization veins and faults: 

 South to southeast– and south–striking, shallow west-dipping structures; 
 South to southeast– to south to southwest–striking, moderate to subvertical west-dipping structures; and 
 East-southeast–striking, moderate to steep south-dipping structures. 

In addition to mineralized structures, post-mineralization faults were observed that are typically steeply dipping and 
southwest- or northeast-striking. 

Main visible alteration observed in the deposit consist of patchy albite-epidote ± chlorite, pseudomorphic clay or calcite, 
silica-sericite-pyrite, pervasive silica, and fracture-fill clay.  Alteration is defined on the basis of alteration mineral 
assemblages, texture, and distribution.

1.4 SAMPLE COLLECTION AND DATA VERIFICATION 

Sample collection, analysis, and security were conducted through industry-accepted practices throughout the life of 
the Project.  The Project contains 874 exploration and development drillholes.  Drilling methods consisted of both 
diamond core and reverse circulation.  Analytical assay procedures were conducted at ISO-certified laboratories, with 
commercial standards, blanks, and duplicates inserted for quality control at variable rates dictated by the drill campaign 
and project owner.   

Coeur completed multiple assay and data collection campaigns during 2013 and 2014.  A category 3 development-
drilling program resulted in the completion of 103 drillholes, adding 11,587 primary samples to the Project database.  
The Coeur exploration team conducted a visual inspection of legacy drill core; targeting previously un-sampled zones 
of altered rock and geologic structures which added 3,520 primary samples to the Project database.  A comprehensive 
assay campaign was conducted to reanalyze 6,884 legacy sample pulps in the range of 25-100 ppm silver using a 
more precise 4-acid ICP digestion method.  Results from two participating commercial laboratories indicated an 
increase in the median silver grade for the sample population tested.  These assay campaigns adhered to Coeur 
Quality Assurance/ Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures and available results indicate a low failure rate of 1.8% for 
inserted standards and blanks.  The QA/QC program is in progress, with continual analyses of failed samples and the 
initiation of a check assay program at a certified umpire laboratory.   

Data collection and verification commissioned by Coeur included a comprehensive review of the original geologic logs 
from Orko, Pan American Silver (PAS), and Coeur; followed by the subsequent recoding and data entry of the 
information.  Coeur continued to verify Orko era data by obtaining original assay certificates from commercial 
laboratories.  Evaluation of the data and performance of the quality control samples were acceptable.  Coeur provides 
recommendations for further QA/QC and Data Verification work and acknowledges that the current and former data 
collection methods, QA/QC procedures, and data performance are adequate for use in resource evaluation. 

1.5 MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINERAL RESERVES 

A new mineral resource model was built for this feasibility study, using updated drillhole data and multiple indicator 
kriging (MIK) was used to estimate both silver and gold grades.  MIK was used to check for any potential biases in 
previous resource models and because MIK required less time to implement.  Using the new resource model for the 
feasibility study, the resulting Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources (MRMR) are shown in Table 1-2 and Table 
1-3.

troy ounce of gold. Metal prices used for the estimation of Mineral Resources were $25 per troy ounce 
of silver and $1,400 per troy ounce of gold. 

2. A Net Smelter Return (NSR) cutoff of $21.93/tonne ($24.17/short tonne) was used, based on the 
following parameters: 

NSR = [(Ag price per ounce -refining charge) × plant recovery × payable recovery] + [(Au price per ounce 
-refining charge) × plant recovery × payable recovery] 

3. Rounding of short tonnes, grades and troy ounces, as required by reporting guidelines, may result in 
apparent differences between tonnes, grades and contained metal contents. 

4. Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 
considerations applied to them that would enable them to be considered for estimation of Mineral 
Reserves. 

5. U.S. Investors are cautioned that the term "mineral resource" is not defined or recognized by the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 
1.5.1 Methodology 

The methodology used for this resource model was multiple indicator kriging (MIK).  This was used for both the silver 
and gold estimation.  The result of the modeling is a probabilistic model that represents the probability of finding ore as 
a model block rather than a deterministic model that will tag each block as ore or waste.  There are two major 
advantages to probabilistic methods.  First, they are quicker and less prone to biases that can be inadvertently 
introduced to the model when using deterministic methods.  Secondly, probabilistic models allow for a rigorous 
implementation of estimating mining dilution.  It is much more difficult to do this with deterministic models without the 
introduction of somewhat arbitrary factors. 

1.5.2 Geological Database 

Following Coeur's QA/QC protocols, the database was thoroughly validated by Coeur prior to being used to develop 
the resource model.  One significant issue was found with the pre-Coeur drillhole data is that only 37 percent of the 
meters drilled were sampled and assayed because of sampling decisions made by previous operators.  Many of these 
un-assayed intervals are away from the known mineralization, but a significant number of un-assayed intervals are 
intermixed with assayed intervals in the mineralized zones.  Ignoring these un-assayed intervals and treating them as 
missing data would lead to a significant selection bias in the estimate.  To address the issue of un-assayed intervals 
all of the un-assayed intervals were filled with zero values except those that were logged as having no core recovery.  
It is anticipated that many of the intervals actually would have silver and gold values above zero, but the actual grade 
would likely be significantly less than the ore cutoff, so the impact of using a zero value rather than a non-zero value is 
likely to have minimal impact on the resource estimate.

Coeur recognizes that the presence of null values in the data is problematic and has identified the un-assayed intervals 
within the first few years of mining and has instituted a program of sampling and assaying the missing intervals.  As a 
standard practice, all intervals in Coeur's drill campaign are sampled. 

The assay and geological database consists of data from 866 holes representing a total of 267,921 m of drilling.  Silver 
and gold assays are present in 827 holes for a total of 100,446 m assayed.  The average interval length is 0.84 m.  It 
can be seen that only 37% of the drilled meters have been assayed.  The data available, along with the assays, was 
mineralization, alteration and lithology logging.  The exploratory data analysis focused primarily on analysis of ore 
controls associated with lithology and the relationship between the silver and gold. 

Potential "ore grade" intervals were examined by looking at all intervals where the silver grade was greater than 31.1 
ppm (Table 1-4). The veining appears to be the source of the mineralization, but it can be seen that significant 
mineralization occurs away from the veins within the adjacent volcanic and sedimentary rocks that host the veining. 

Table 1-4: Occurrence of High-grade Intercepts. 

Unit Occurrence (m) Relative Percent Silver (ppm) Gold (ppm) 
Vein 3616 36 198.5 0.348 

Volcanic 4067 41 99.6 0.143 
Sedimentary 2248 23 119.5 0.208 

Total 9931 100 140.1 0.232 
 
The correlation between the silver and gold is important to the resource evaluation as both contribute to the economic 
value.  The distributions of the silver and gold were estimated independently then evaluated jointly on a block by block 
basis.  The correlation was examined by stratigraphic unit including host rocks, mineralized units, and the post-mineral 
rock and soil formations.  Correlation is relatively poor between silver and gold, but it is not unreasonable within the 
ore-bearing units such as the Quartz Vein unit and the Upper and Lower Volcanic Series. 

Silver variograms were fitted for the grade data and for the indicators for each domain.  The orientation of the structures 
remained constant for each domain with the exception of North Martha, which changed slightly with the upper indicator 
variables (Table 1-5). 

Table 1-5: Structural Orientation of Estimation Domains 

Domain Strike (Azimuth) Dip (degrees) 
North Martha (Ind. 0 to 4) N15E 30 to West 
North Martha (Ind. 5 to 11) N10E 40 to West 
South Martha N15W 25 to West 
Gloria & Abundancia NS 30 to West 

 
A general kriging plan was identical for all variables, only the search orientation and variograms used were changed 
by domain.  Search ellipsoids with a radius of 500 m along strike, 200 m down dip and 40 m perpendicular to the 
structure were used and the orientation of the search ellipsoid was changed for each domain to be identical to the 
orientation of the variograms.  Because of the limits on the number of composites used, the search limits were rarely 
extended to their limits. 

The dimensions of the resource model are shown in Table 1-6. The model origin and dimensions are slightly different 
from previous models but were adjusted to be compatible with the geologic model.  The block height of 5 m was chosen 
to be compatible with the anticipated mining bench height.

A metallurgical model was developed and is primarily dependent on the lithological composition of the mineralized 
material.  Metallurgy recoveries were grouped into three distinct rock types: vein quartz, volcanic, and sediments.  It 
was necessary to attempt to predict the relative proportions of the various rock types that the mineralized material 
would be composed of, but the geological model was not sufficiently detailed to enable it to be used directly to estimate 
the mineralized material composition.  An indicator model was used to predict the rock type proportions associated 
with the mineralized material by using the estimated proportions.  A linear weighted average of the metallurgical 
recovery parameters were calculated for each block in the model.  A separate silver and gold recovery were calculated 
based on the grade of the ore portion of the block and stored back into the block model. 

The originally proposed metallurgical recovery parameters consisted of a simple constant tail fraction with steps at 
various grades.  Post-processing of the grade distributions requires that the metallurgical recovery be a continuous 
function rather than a step function; to accomplish this, a linear regression function was fitted to the tail grade versus 
the calculated head grade of the bottle roll tests.  Separate regressions were done for each of the three rock types for 
silver and gold and then the regression curves were used to predict the recovered grade as a function of the head 
grade. 

There is a relatively small amount of Inferred material estimated into the model.  This is in large part because of a 
function of the kriging plan.  The kriging plan requires data to be present in at least three octants and from at least 
three drillholes.  These limitations set in the kriging plan prevent excessive extrapolation of the model away from 
available data.  Allowing further extrapolation away from the data would result in estimates that would be considered 
basically unsupported. 

Three levels of model validation were done: first the model was checked to ensure that it was globally unbiased, second 
it was checked to ensure that it was spatially unbiased, and finally the resource model was visually checked in cross-
section and plan to ensure that the model compared reasonably to the drilling. 

The indicator kriged model was compared to a nearest neighbor model to check for unbiasedness.  The nearest 
neighbor (NN) model will provide poor local estimates and should never be used for local estimates, but the NN model 
will provide a superior unbiased global estimate of the grade distribution within the model volume.  Therefore, over 
large volumes, the NN model estimate can be used to provide an excellent check against unbiasedness in the model.  
The NN estimate honored the fault boundaries, as did the kriged model. 

The e-type estimate is the estimated average block grade (at a zero cutoff) reconstructed from the indicator kriged 
distribution in each block.  Looking at the average block grade at a zero cutoff allows it to be directly compared to the 
nearest-neighbor estimate, also at a zero cutoff.  Global unbiasedness was checked by averaging all of the estimated 
Measured and Indicated blocks in the model and the E-type estimate for silver is slightly higher than the NN estimate 
while the gold estimate is slightly lower.  These differences are within acceptable limits. 

1.6 MINING METHODS 

The Project mine plan was developed using conventional hard rock open pit mining methods.  No underground 
resource was envisioned in this mine plan.  While a smaller, higher grade portion of the resource could be recovered 
in an underground mine, the scale and percent recovery of the resource would be substantially diminished.  In addition, 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128

the complicated structure of the low angle Martha vein which makes up 60% of the resource would make underground 
mining complicated and costly.   

Scoping studies indicated that a production schedule filling the mill at 10,000 tpd maximized the Project return on 
investment.  The total material rate is tied to equipment productivity. The total material moved ramps up to 214,000 
tonnes per day in year 6, and averages 60,400 ktonnes/yr or 167,700 tpd for the first 10 years.  The mine is scheduled 
to operate 365 days/yr with two, 12-hour shifts/day. 

The mine plan was developed with a phased approach to facilitate sufficient waste mining to provide the mill feed 
desired.  In addition to the phases, mining was envisioned on 5 m in ore bencehs and 10 m benches in waste to 
increase productivity and mill feed. The approach to phase designs, mine schedule, and mine equipment requirements 
are summarized below. 

A Lerchs Grossman algorithm using a 10% discount rate was used as a guide to the design of the phases or pushbacks.  
Multiple economic pits were developed using the costs, slope angles and recoveries outlined in the Section below. The 
slope angles used include an allowance for roads and recommended catch benches in the overall slopes. Metal prices 
were varied from low to high in order to establish a series of multiple nested pit geometries and resulting Net Present 
Values (NPVs).  The results of this work indicated the starting point, final pit and the extraction sequence that maximized 
the NPV throughout the mine life.   

The pit evaluation was based on a $22 per ounce silver and $1,350 per ounce gold price. Recoveries were based on 
the metallurgical model.  Refining costs and payabilities were based on quotes received for refining doré.  For pit design 
purposes, prices from the 2013 Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) (M3, 2013) were used to establish the pit 
limits.  This pit was designed on only Measured and Indicated resources.  Inferred resources were not included.   

The economic pit was discounted at an annual discount rate of 10%.  The benches were discounted according to a 
twelve 10-m bench per year annual advance rate.   

Eight phases were designed for Project with a minimum of 100 m of operating width on each bench within a phase, in 
general.  Phase 1 was sized to contain roughly one year of mineralized material.  The following summarizes the basic 
parameters used for mine design.  General design criteria are listed in Table 1-7. 

Table 1-7: Phase Design Parameters 

Haul Road Width 30 meters 
Haul Road Grade 10% Maximum 

Interramp Slope Angles by sector (see) 
Operating width between pushbacks 100 meters nominal 

 
Preproduction stripping will occur in Phases 1, 2, and 3.  In many cases there is less than 1 month of mineralized 
material per 5m bench within a phase at the Project.  Consequently, the mine plan maintains 2 phases in mineralized 
material in order to assure that mineralized material is released and available to assure plant feed.   

The mineralized material that is encountered during pre-production (509 ktonnes) will be stockpiled near the crusher 
(or in the pit) and delivered to the mill during Year 1.  The mineralized material in the upper benches of Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 is limited in quantity.  This material is accumulated and stockpiled to ensure there is sufficient mineralized 
material release in Phase 1, Phase 2, and the stockpile combined to assure mill production.  

Low grade material that is above the internal cutoff of $16.11/tonne NSR and less than mill feed cutoff in the early 
years will be stored in the low grade stockpile that is located northeast of the crusher.  That material is planned to be

  10 

re-mined and delivered to the mill in later years.  The bottom of Table 20-4 illustrates the mineralized material planned 
for processing inclusive of stockpile re-handling.   

The NSR calculation for the mine plan and mineral resource is: 

NSR = [(Ag price per ounce -refining charge) x plant recovery x payable recovery] + 

[(Au price per ounce -refining charge) x plant recovery x payable recovery] 

NSR =  [($22.00 / 31.1035) – 0.02] x Plant Recovery x 0.9975] + Silver Contribution 

  [($1350 / 31.1035) – 0.16] x Plant Recovery x 0.9950]  Gold Contribution 

The mine plan for the Project includes only Measured, and Indicated category mineralization.  The economics do not 
include a credit from Inferred mineralization.  The mine plan material in Table 20-4 contains 37.3 million tonnes of mill 
feed. 

Mine equipment is expected to be comprised of standard commercially available units.  Principal mining equipment is 
a fleet of hydraulic mining shovels and 184 tonne class mechanical drive rock trucks. 

Ore will be mined on 5 m bench heights and most of the waste will be mined on 10 m bench heights.  The amount of 
waste mined on 5 m benches is equivalent to 150% of the ore-grade material on each bench.  

Mine total manpower is based on having a three-panel roster of crews to man the mine on a 2 by 12-hour shift basis.  
The rotations are anticipated to be 5 days of day shift, 5 days of night shift and 5 days off, with 24 hours between the 
end of day shift and the start of night shift. This allows for one crew to be off at all times. 

Operating manpower numbers were set by the numbers of equipment, multiplied by the three crews.  Maintenance 
manpower numbers were set by using experience and a ratio of about 60% maintenance to operations staff.  These 
numbers do not include the contracted services for diesel supply, tire maintenance and explosives delivery.  A blasting 
crew was put on to design and load the explosives.  

Labor rates are modeled after Coeur's Palmarejo operations, and include fringe benefits.  An allowance of 10 percent 
of the overall manning schedule was added to allow for vacation, sickness and absenteeism.

The mining equipment capital costs are based on a leased fleet. The lease costs were calculated from the equipment 
list.  Escalation and contingency are not included in capital costs.   

The costs for all the major equipment was based on vendor supplied quotes while costs for most of the minor equipment 
is based on historical quotes and estimates.  Much of the cost information was current during 2013 and 2014.  Older 
quotes for minor capital equipment were inflated as required.

Mine operating costs estimates are based on first principals for the scheduled production, equipment lease 
requirements, operating hours, hourly equipment operating costs, and manpower requirements. Neither escalation nor 
contingency are included in operating costs.  Life-of-mine operating costs are expected to average $1.395 per tonne 
drilled and blasted, and $1.383 per tonne overall, including rehandled stockpile material.   

It is expected that the mining fleet will be leased for a 5-year period with an option to purchase after the lease has 
expired. Sustaining capital includes the purchase of the leased mining fleet in every fifth year. Fuel costs were set at

Knight Piésold Ltd. of North Bay, Ontario, has completed a feasibility level design for the tailings storage facility (TSF).  
The design has been carried out based on the preferred TSF option for tailings storage and water management as 
provided by Coeur.  The selected site for the TSF lies to the southwest of the proposed open pit and process plant. 

The current feasibility level design of the TSF is based on a projected 17-year mine life at a processing rate of 
approximately 10,000 dtpd.  The design was performed concurrently to the mine design and planning, and used the 
PEA resources as a design basis.  The actual mine life may be shorter or longer under certain economic conditions.  
Tailings at 50% solids content (approximately, by weight) will be delivered via pump and pipeline from the plant site for 
storage at the TSF.  The TSF is broadly triangular in shape with the long axis trending slightly northwest-southeast.  
The ground slopes gently downwards towards the south, at an average gradient of about 4%.  The TSF has been sized 
to store on a permanent basis approximately 45.5 million m3 or 59.1 million tonnes of tailings at an estimated average 
in situ dry density of 1.3 tonnes/m3. 

The feasibility design will provide permanent and secure tailings storage, in addition to water storage and controls to 
ensure protection of the environment during operations and in the long-term (after closure).  The TSF has been 
designed to manage stormwater and run off water inflows.  The stormwater management design includes selection of 
an Inflow Design Flood and an Environmental Design Storm.   

Depending on mine life, two embankments will be constructed to establish the TSF, including a main embankment 
along the south side of the basin and a smaller embankment constructed later at the north side of the basin.  Natural 
topographical containment will form the northeast and west sides of the TSF.  The TSF design section will include an 
initial starter embankment (Stage 1) for the south embankment with ongoing raises completed for the south and north 
embankments using centerline construction methods throughout the life of the facility.  The initial starter embankment 
at the south will be constructed of zoned rockfill with a composite liner on the upstream slope.  The centerline raises 
will consist of zoned rockfill with a low permeability core zone.  Transition zones will be established between the core 
zone and the embankment rockfill to ensure internal stability.  The Stage 1 TSF will provide storage for two years of 
tailings deposition.  Construction of the north embankment will not be required until Year 9 of operations.  The 
embankments will be extended and raised using rockfill from the mine over the life of the facility. 

Tailings will be deposited sub-aerially using spigot offtakes starting in the southwest corner and cycling around the 
south, east and north sides of the facility.  Discharge from the embankments and basin perimeter will maintain the 
supernatant pond near the central west side of the tailings basin away from the embankments.  A water reclaim system 
will maintain the pond with limited size to minimize evaporation.  Under these conditions, sufficient storage capacity 
will be provided within the TSF to store any tailings supernatant water, run off and the design storm events, in addition 
to an allowance for freeboard.  Embankment construction will be scheduled to ensure that there is always sufficient 
storage capacity available in the facility to avoid overtopping and negate the need for interim spillways for each 
embankment stage.

The Project is located where water resources are scarce and water supply can be expensive.  In addition to minimizing 
the downstream impacts of the facility on the environment, the primary water management objective for the TSF is to 
collect all available water for re-use in the process in order to minimize make-up water requirements.   

Supernatant water will be removed from the TSF via a decant tower system. Water recovered from the decant system 
will be pumped back to the plant for re-use in the process circuits.  The operating pond will be maintained at the 
minimum volume required to provide adequate clarification prior to reclaim.  A monthly operational water balance was 
completed for the TSF and the results indicate that the TSF will operate at a net water deficit during all years of 
operations.  Only a portion of the process water requirements can be satisfied by water reclaimed from the TSF.  
Additional make-up water, from other sources, is required in all years of operation.  Overall, the average make-up water 
requirement over the life of the facility is estimated to be around 0.34 m3/t of ore processed. 

A number of seepage reduction strategies have been incorporated into the design and operation of the facility, including 
the installation of a liner system and an underdrain collection system to collect any available free water above the liner.  
The design includes a composite liner consisting of a 60 mil HDPE geomembrane overlying a low permeability soil 
layer placed on the upstream slope of the starter embankment and over the entire basin footprint.  The centerline 
embankment raises will be constructed with a low permeability core zone.  The underdrain system will comprise a 
series of perforated drainage pipes above the HDPE liner on a herringbone pattern over the TSF basin floor.  The 
underdrain system will terminate in one of two reinforced concrete collection sump towers.  The towers will be 
surrounded with clean, free-draining rockfill and will be raised with the embankments.  Submersible pumps, located 
within the sumps, will return water to the supernatant pond.   

Instrumentation will be installed in the TSF embankments and foundations during construction and over the life of the 
project.  The instrumentation will be monitored, as part of the detailed monitoring plan to be developed for the facility 
during the construction and operation to assess embankment performance and to identify any conditions which differ 
from those assumed during design and analysis.  Amendments to the ongoing designs and/or remediation work can 
be implemented to respond to changing conditions, should the need arise.  Instrumentation will include vibrating wire 
piezometers, survey monuments and vibrating wire settlement gauges and groundwater monitoring wells.  

The primary objective of reclamation and closure activities will be to ensure physical and chemical stability of the TSF. 
Closure and reclamation will focus on removal of surface infrastructure and stabilizing and covering the exposed tailings 
surface to ensure that acceptable downstream water quality is maintained.  Additional closure work will involve 
progressive reclamation of the downstream face of the embankments and construction of permanent spillways. 

1.6.2 Surface Geotechnical  

 Surface Infrastructure 

Geotechnical investigations were completed by Knight Piésold in 2014 to support the feasibility designs for the Project 
Surface Infrastructure.   

The focus of the 2014 geotechnical site investigation program was to characterize the general soil and bedrock 
conditions within the vicinity of the proposed Plant Site and TSF.  The completed site investigations consisted of 
geotechnical drilling (soils and bedrock), test pit excavation, collection of representative samples, geotechnical logging, 
geomechanical logging, in situ testing and laboratory index testing.  

A total of 18 drillholes and 24 test pits were completed to characterize the overburden and near surface bedrock 
conditions at the proposed Plant Site and TSF locations.  Since the site investigation was initiated, the configuration of 
the Plant Site has been modified.  Additional modifications to the layouts may occur during the next level of design. 

The following paragraphs provide a brief summary of the findings of geotechnical site investigations.

Plant Site - A total of five drillholes and eight test pits were completed in the Plant Site area in order to evaluate the 
foundation conditions and to characterize the overburden and near surface bedrock.  Main observations included: 

 The depth to bedrock was relatively deep and typically ranged from 15 m to 20 m.  The depth to bedrock at 
one drillhole location was shallow at 4 m. 

 The overburden encountered in the area was generally found to comprise of nominal surficial layer of organic 
silt underlain by sand, with varying amounts of clay or gravel overlying bedrock.  All of the soil samples 
collected from the Plant Site area, except for one, exhibited plasticity with plasticity index values ranging from 
9.4% to 26.2%. 

 Bedrock underlying the overburden at the Plant Site mainly consisted of andesite which ranged in quality from 
POOR to FAIR.  Basalt was encountered at one drillhole location. 

Tailings Storage Facility - A total of 12 drillholes and 16 test pits were completed in the TSF area in order to 
characterize the overburden and near-surface bedrock and evaluate the shallow bedrock hydraulic conductivity.  Main 
observations included: 

 The depth to bedrock was shallow (i.e. less than 5 m) in all the drillholes except on the west side of the TSF, 
where up to 15.5 m of overburden was locally encountered.  

 The overburden encountered in the TSF area generally consisted of a nominal surficial layer of organic silt 
underlain by sand, with varying amounts of clay or gravel overlying bedrock.  All of the soil samples collected 
from the TSF area exhibited plasticity, with plasticity index values ranging from 8.4% to 31% 

 The bedrock consisted of basaltic flows with a well-developed vesicular structure, dense basalt with a weak 
to moderately developed vesicular structure, scoria and andesite.  The encountered rock mass qualities 
typically ranged from POOR to FAIR.   

 A total of 23 packer tests were performed at 12 drillhole locations.  Hydraulic conductivity values were 
generally high especially within the shallow bedrock.  This likely is attributed to the well-developed vesicular 
structure in the basalt, broken and rubble zones.  A small area in the southwest corner of the TSF that is 
underlain by andesite exhibited relatively low hydraulic conductivities.  Intervals with no recovered bedrock 
core were encountered in drillholes at the north end of the facility potentially indicating the presence of a lava 
tube or similar structure (void).   

Geologic Structure between TSF and Open Pit - One deeper, inclined drillhole was advanced into bedrock within 
the northern area of the TSF to evaluate if the hydrogeological conditions and/or geologic structures were present that 
could convey seepage from the TSF to the Open Pit.  Main observations included: 

 Five possible faults were identified in this drillhole with consistent north-south or northeast-southwest striking 
fault orientations similar to the fault orientations identified in the area of the Open Pits. Faults with these 
orientations could represent a potential conduit for seepage between the TSF and the Open Pit. 

 The measured hydraulic conductivity of the encountered faults was generally one to two orders of magnitude 
higher than the deep host rock, but several orders of magnitude lower than the shallow bedrock.  Given the 
expected hydraulic conductivities, it is likely any seepage from the TSF will flow through the highly permeable 
shallow vesicular basalt and not be conveyed to the Open Pit via any specific geologic structure. 

1.6.3 Geomechanical - Open Pit 

PMLP is currently evaluating the feasibility of mining the deposit using several open pits: 

 Abundancia Pit (the main pit, 460 m deep)  
 North Satellite Pit (105 m deep) 
 Central Satellite Pit (130 m deep) 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128

 South Satellite Pit (115 m deep) 

The geomechanical and hydrogeological site investigation program was designed to support the pit slope design of the 
proposed open pits.  The site investigation program was completed between December 2013 and March 2014, and 
included the following: 

 Six oriented and triple-tubed geomechanical drillholes with associated detailed geomechanical logging and 
hydraulic conductivity (packer) testing 

 Installation of multi-point vibrating wire piezometers in three (3) geomechanical drillholes 
 Detailed geomechanical logging of intervals of full core from seven (7) exploration drillholes 
 Underground line mapping at two (2) locations, and surface line and spot mapping at one (1) and two (2) 

locations, respectively 
 Collection of 123 samples for laboratory strength testing. Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), Triaxial 

and Direct-Shear tests were completed 
 On-site evaluation of the susceptibility of the rock mass to time-dependent degradation 
 Borehole televiewer surveys of eight (8) exploration drillholes and one (1) geomechanical drillhole conducted 

by Groupe Qualitas Inc. 
 Training Bufete Minero y Servicios de Ingenería, S.A. de C.V. geologists in drill supervision and Expromin 

S.C. geologists in detailed geomechanical logging 

Based on the location and characteristics of the geomechanical domains and the pit design provided by Coeur, 11 
design sectors were identified. Slope stability analyses were undertaken to define achievable slope configurations for 
each sector. 

A slope design summary for the Abundancia Pit is included below: 

 Bench Face Angle:  55 to 70° 
 Bench Width:  6.5 to 10 m  
 Bench Height:  10 to 15 m (double or triple benching 5 m benches)  
 Interramp Angle:  36 to 49° (for heights up to 150 m) 
 Overall Slope Angle:  31 to 45° 

1.7 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Metallurgical testing prior to 2013 was summarized and reported in the PEA.  An extensive drilling program and 
metallurgical investigation was initiated in support of this feasibility study.  The data summarized here are from this 
recent investigation, and although the PEA data analysis supports this recent investigation, the older data are not 
included in this report summary.   

The analysis for feasibility level metallurgical studies for the recovery of silver and gold is reported here along with 
conclusions.  The deposit is amenable to conventional process technology and will be processed in a conventional 
crushing, grinding and Merrill-Crowe silver recovery circuit with detoxified tailings reporting to a tailings storage facility.  

The metallurgical and mineralogy investigations were developed by the following techniques: XRD, QEMSCAN, clay 
and near infrared analyses, flotation, comminution parameters, variability and development sodium cyanide leaching, 
bulk sodium cyanide leaching, sodium cyanide detoxification, Merrill-Crowe simulation, flocculent screening, 
conventional, high rate and paste thickening, vacuum and pressure filtration, pressure clarification and slurry rheology.

Mineralogy Highlights: 

 The gold grains are contained in iron hydroxide that is enclosed in quartz-rich particles.  
 The majority of the located gold occurrences in the samples would be considered to be liberated.  
 Gold particles precipitated in direct association with pyrite and non-sulfide gangue minerals were generally 

low in gold content and were of smaller average diameter than the liberated gold particles.  Some of this gold 
was found as inclusions within the pyrite or gangue particle and may not be amenable to cyanide leaching. 
Gold was detected in association with silver sulfide minerals. 

 The major portion of the silver in this sample occurs as silver sulfide (acanthite, Ag2S). Traces of silver–
selenium sulfide (possibly aguilarite) and complex silver–antimony–zinc sulfide were also observed.  Silver-
bearing grains range from 15 -100 μm in size.  The silver-bearing grains observed and described here are 
locked in quartz or are associated with pyrite, galena and lead carbonate, and iron oxide or iron hydroxide.  
Acanthite also occurred as very fine veins within quartz.  

 Minerals detected by short-wave infrared and visible light include: copiapite, cerussite, epidote, goethite, 
gypsum, hematite, illite, illite-NH4, jarosite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, nontronite, quartz, saponite.  Oxidation 
state did not correlate with silver dissolution.  

Bond crusher work index values were measured from 65 whole core samples. The Bond crusher work index averaged 
9.7 kWh/t ± 3.4 and varied from 21.3 to 5.2 kWh/t for all samples tested.  

Bond abrasion index (Ai) tests were completed on 47 samples.  Ai results ranged from 0.37-1.27 g, and averaged 0.74 
± 0.25g.   

Bond ball mill work index (BWi) tests were completed on 47 samples.  BWi results ranged from 14.7–18.2 kWh/t and 
averaged 16.1 ± 1.0 kW/t.   

Bond rod mill work index (RWi) tests were completed on 36 samples.  RWi results ranged from 12.7–18.1 kWh/t and 
averaged 15.3 ± 1.4 kW/t.   

Sag mill comminution tests were completed. 

Silver dissolution testing in the variability study consisted of 141 bottle roll tests with samples ground to a particle size 
P80 of ~45 μm and 23 bottle roll tests with the samples ground to a particle size P80 of ~74 μm.  The ground material 
was leached for 72 hours at a pulp density of 40% solids in 1.5 gpl NaCN at a pH of 11.5.  Lead nitrate was not added.  

The exploratory cyanide leach series investigated various alternative leaching schemes to determine silver and gold 
recoveries or improve metal leaching kinetics.  The exploratory leaches included feed and residue size classification, 
baseline cyanide leaching, two-stage leaching, hot leaching, leaching of sand and slime size fractions, O2 enriched 
leaching, and pressure conditioning and pressure leaching.  

Thirteen leach tests were completed as standard NaCN bottle roll tests conducted for 72 or 96 hours at pH 11.5, pulp 
density of 40 wt% and ambient temperature.  The test series evaluated three particle sizes P80; 30, 45, and 75 um, and 
two sodium cyanide concentrations 1.5 and 4.0 gpl.   

Feasibility study silver and gold recovery was calculated based on head grade versus tail grade regression of the 
Variability Average Grade, Lithology Elevation bench, and selected Exploratory bottle roll tests.   

The weighted silver and gold recovery was determined to be 84% and 61%, respectively, based on life of mine head 
grades.

The average cyanide consumption was determined to be 1.0 kg/t.  Lime consumption was determined to be 1.4 kg/t. 
The flocculant consumption was determined to be 0.085 kg/tonne.  

Sodium cyanide detoxification reagent consumptions were determined to be 0.8 kg sodium metabisulfite/t and 0.07 kg 
copper sulfate pentahydrate/t.  

1.8 RECOVERY METHODS 

The mill feed will be delivered from the mine at a rate of 10,000 dtpd.  A primary jaw crusher will crush the ore. Crushed 
ore will be ground in a closed SAG and ball mill grinding circuit.  Ground material will be leached with sodium cyanide 
in agitated leach tanks.  Soluble precious metals are washed from the leached slurry then recovered in the Merrill-
Crowe process.  The precious metal precipitate will be smelted to produce doré bars.  Tailings will be thickened then 
routed to either the cyanide destruction circuit or to the tailing storage facility.  A basic flow sheet of the process can 
be seen in Figure 1-2.

1.9 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

It is contemplated that there will be several surface buildings constructed to support the mining and process operations. 
These facilities include administration, guardhouse, truck shop, warehouse, change house, explosives storage 
buildings, and truck wash and mill maintenance facilities. 

A new access road and utility corridor has been anticipated for the site, and is shown on Figure 5-1.  This road will 
connect to the site from an existing exit off of Mexican Federal Highway Route 40 at the exit to the community of 
Vicente Suarez.  This mine access road will use a portion of the existing community road and then deviate from that 
road to take a more direct route to the mine.  Total road to be constructed is ~14 km of which ~12.5 km will be new 
construction and 1.1 km of the existing road will be improved.  The final road will be about 50 km from Durango to the 
mine. 

Due to heavy transport to the site during construction, the road is anticipated to be 10 meters wide of driving surface, 
consisting of improved and compacted gravel, with drainage ditches.  With exception of replacement or by-pass of one 
existing bridge on the portion of the existing road to Vicente Suarez, the remaining arroyo crossings are assumed to 
be "low water" crossings with concrete base. 

The site is currently equipped with a radio communications tower that belongs to the site and has radio capacity to 
communicate back to the town of Durango. This radio tower was constructed by prior owners and consists of a 
dedicated 34.5 m fenced tower, solar power, with multi frequency and repeater capacity and has a second tower located 
on the roof of the Durango office building to assure 2-way communications to the site. 

The Project's location limits the ability to secure firm pipeline natural gas supply due to the unavailability of firm capacity 
in the nearby pipeline.  Other options for natural gas delivery, including Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied 
Natural Gas (LNG), could provide firm gas supply, but would result in an all-in power cost that exceed published 
Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) tariffs for electricity. 

Three options are being explored for supply of electrical connections to the Project: 

1. CFE has proposed to provide power from the future Canatlán Potencia substation located about 42 km west-
northwest from the site. Canatlán Potencia substation is planned to have a capacity of 100 MW, and will step-
down the voltage level from 230 kV to 115 kV. From the substation a 42 km long, 115 kV transmission line 
will feed the Project.  A 115 kV power line could be constructed using wood poles or steel towers as favored 
by CFE with a 477 kCMIL size, ACSR type conductor.  CFE offered to build the transmission line in 34 months, 
including the new Canatlán Potencia substation.  It is typical for a mining project client, or their contractor, to 
build the transmission lines and related substations and then turn them over to CFE for their operation and 
maintenance. The construction of any infrastructure that needs to be turned over to CFE, switching substation 
and transmission line will need to be inspected and accepted by CFE technical personnel during and after 
construction and commissioning of the facilities.   

2. There is an existing 115 kV power line at a distance of about 9 km from the mine site.  It is currently providing 
power to the city of Guadalupe Victoria. This option would require construction of a new branch, running to 
the mine site at a length of about 11 km.  Connecting to this power line is not feasible since it does not have 
sufficient power capacity.  

3. The 230 kV power line connected to the national grid is located at a distance of about 9 km from the mine 
site.  Construction of a branch line with a length of about 11 km will be required.  Positive discussions are 
continuing with CFE.  This option will also require construction of a new switching substation nearby route 40.  
The new 230 kV transmission line to the Project will follow the new access road to the north.  The line will

   19 

need to be designed and constructed on steel tower with a minimum ACSR conductor size of 1113 circular 
mils (kcmil).   

Option 3 is preferred due to shortened construction, potentially lower capital cost, and lessened right-of-way acquisition 
issues.  Engineering could start once CFE approves final connection point and the route is defined. Design 
specifications and requirements will be based on CFE normalized standards based on substations and transmission 
line voltages.  

The Project Substation would consist of two 30 MVA 230 kV to 13.2kV power transformers.  Each transformer would 
be sufficient to power the entire plant load allowing one transformer to be taken down for maintenance at any given 
time without affecting the plant operations.  Stepdown transformers from 13.2 kV to 4160 V or 480 V will be located at 
the individual process areas. 

Site power distribution will be at 13.2 kV and will consist of both underground distribution and overhead lines.  
Underground distribution will be used to supply power to the main process areas near the substation while overhead 
lines will be used to provide power to the outlying areas such as primary crushing, stockpile, water tanks, and tailing.  
Wells and well water booster pumps will be fed by a 34.5 kV overhead line from a 13.2 kV to 34.5 kV step up transformer 
in the main substation. 

A water source for the Project has been located in the Valle de Guadiana aquifer, and two wells were drilled to supply 
the anticipated approximately 80 L/s of plant and mine demand.  Those two wells were drilled on farm land and all 
agreements are in place with the land-owners for the use of the land.  Water rights have been obtained for 
approximately one half of the required water.  The remaining water rights applications are being reviewed by the 
government agency CONAGUA. 

Power for the two wells is anticipated to cost approximately US$180,000 and consist of extension of existing power 
lines that go to Vicente Suarez and also service other agricultural wells in the area. This will include posts, wire, 
transformers and control for the primary well pumps and the booster pumps. 

A booster tank will be located so as to serve both the existing wells with an installation of two in-line booster pumps 
such that water can be pumped directly to the site. 

Water pipeline design from the well booster tank to the site will cross easements with local landowners and the Vicente 
Suarez Ejido and will be constructed of steel in the lower portion and HDPE in the upper portion as pressure 
requirements drop. 

1.9.1 Water Balance 

A steady state water balance was prepared for inclusion in the environmental permitting application by SRK Consulting 
(SRK) of Tucson. The water balance indicates that the Project will be a net water user and that the site will rely on 
make-up water pumped from the water supply wellfield, stormwater run off ponds, and from groundwater inflows from 
pit dewatering. Water is primarily used in the plant process circuit and the tailings disposal system, but will also be 
used for dust suppression of haulage and access roads and of drilling rig operations. Reliance on well water will decline 
after Year 4 as the main pit (Abundancia) deepens and greater inflow water becomes available. Reclaiming the 
maximum water possible from the TSF pond, reducing water usage across the property, and recycling water, wherever 
feasible, are key components of the design of the plant and TSF facilities. 

1.10 PROJECT EXECUTION PLAN 

The proposed project execution plan incorporates an integrated strategy for engineering, procurement and construction 
management (EPCM). The primary objective of the execution methodology is to deliver the Project at the lowest capital 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT

cost, on schedule, and consistent with the Project standards for quality, safety, and environmental compliance.  Coeur 
would provide a Project Management Office for oversight and project controls through project turnover to operations. 

Execution of the Project is based on several steps, some occurring simultaneously.  It is anticipated that there will be 
18 months of field construction to commencement of commissioning. Project location is sufficiently close to a major 
city that no camp is required for housing of employees. 

 The detailed engineering schedule is based on interim approval to be granted in early Basic Engineering 
starting in the first quarter (Q1) of Y-2, and full EPCM release in Q3 of Y-2. The design is scheduled to be 
60% complete by the end of Q4 Y-2. Engineering will be completed upon receipt of all pertinent vendor data. 

 Procurement of long lead items (i.e. SAG mill, ball mill, leach agitators) would begin in Q2 Y-2, ensuring 
vendor data available for detailed engineering in a timely manner. 

 Contractor mobilization for earth moving begins as soon as the environmental permitting is released at the 
beginning of Q3 Y-2. 

 Coeur training of mine operators, mine pre-stripping activity, and access road works would begin as soon as 
permits allow.  Water well preparation would begin immediately to provide construction water requirements. 

 The construction program is scheduled to start in Q3 Y-2. Contract bid calls will start in Q2 Y-2. The work 
includes clearing and grubbing of the plant site, mass earthwork for site development, project access road 
and in-plant roads. Concrete foundations and underground utilities for the process buildings and other support 
structures will be constructed beginning in early Q4 Y-2. 

 Construction work is scheduled for 18 months from ground breaking to the commencement of commissioning.  
Earthworks for process facilities will commence as soon as the contractor can be mobilized to the field, after 
all required permits have been obtained.  This work will include surface water control diversions, process 
building foundations and tailings facilities. 

The EPCM integrated approach includes project controls and services brought together at the appropriate times to 
ensure a successful project. 

 Contracting – A combination of vertical (e.g., all trades for laboratory), horizontal (e.g., electrical trade for 
process area), and design construct (e.g., fire protection) contracts may be employed as best suits the work 
to be performed, degree of engineering and scope definition available at the time of award. Concrete batch 
plants are expected to be based on-site. 

 Expediting, Logistics, and Inspections – The EPCM contractor will be responsible to expedite the receipt of 
vendor drawings to support the engineering effort as well as expediting the fabrication and delivery of major 
equipment to the site.  An expediting report will be issued at regular intervals outlining the status of each 
purchase order in order to alert the Project of any delays in the expected shipping date or issue of critical 
vendor drawings. Corrective action can then be taken to mitigate any delay. 
The EPCM contractor will also ensure that qualified personnel inspect critical equipment before shipments 
are made. 

 Quality Plans, Health and Safety Plans, and Commissioning plans will be developed before construction 
activity starts. 

1.11 CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE 

Initial capital costs have been estimated for Project in compliance with feasibility level design based on the associated 
material quantities, labor cost estimates and equipment quotations. Unit rates have been based on historic data, 
published sources and inputs from Coeur's operations in Mexico. The estimate includes all evaluated sections of the 
Project such as process, tailing, mining, and maintenance facilities. The costs also include pre-production mining, 
owner's costs and contingency. A more detailed initial capital breakdown is located in Section 21 of this report as well 
as in the economic model.

1.13 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

The economic analysis for the Project assumes an 18-month construction period, followed by a production period of 
11 years, and reclamation and closure in Year 12.  Total initial capital totals $327.6 million and sustaining capital equals 
$126.6 over the life of the Project. 

Annual revenue in the economic analysis is calculated by applying forecast metal prices to the estimated annual 
payable metal produced in each operating year. No escalation or hedging is assumed in the analysis.  

The Project is assumed to be subject to a Mexican corporate income tax rate of 30%, consistent with current income 
tax laws enacted in Mexico.  Total income tax payments over the life of the Project equal $102.1 million.  The Project 
is also assumed to be subject to two newly enacted mining royalty taxes: a 0.5% royalty tax on revenue from precious

metal, and a 7.5% royalty tax calculated on earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization. These taxes 
represent additional $12.5 million and $67.7 million payments, respectively, to the government over the life of the 
Project. 

The average Total Cash Cost over the LOM is estimated to be $15.16 per ounce of silver processed. Total Cash Costs 
includes mine operations, process plant operations, general and administration cost, smelting and refining charges, 
and transportation costs. The estimated cash cost by area per ounce of silver produced is summarized in Table 1-11.

1.14 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT  

A number of site characterization and engineering studies have been completed and/or initiated as part of the feasibility 
studies and in support of the environmental permit applications and approvals. The inventories, site characterization 
studies, monitoring plans, and management plans were prepared for the Project area and adjacent land in compliance 
with required components of the main environmental documents that must be submitted to the federal government and 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128

approved prior to mine development. The primary environmental documents include the Environmental Impact 
Statement (Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental or MIA), the Forest Land Use Modification (ETJ), and Risk 
Assessment (ER). Two MIA application documents are needed – one for the road access and utility corridor to the 
mine, and the other for the mine site itself. Further environmental work will continue at the site in the form of pre-mining 
baseline monitoring programs. 

Baseline characterization has been initiated to establish pre-mine ambient conditions and to prepare monitoring and 
management plans to mitigate the disturbance and potential impacts to the environment in the Project area. PMLP has 
constructed a weather station to monitor the site climate conditions. Biological and wildlife inventories were completed 
over 14,261 hectares including scrub forest, natural and planted grassland, and the dry-land and irrigated agricultural 
areas to identify the nature of the existing flora and fauna and to assess the presence of protected species. No historic 
or archeological resources were found during these surveys. A census of local wells was completed to establish the 
local potentiometric surface and hydrogeologic gradient. The wells were sampled to provide baseline water quality 
characteristics. A preliminary assessment of the site aquifer properties was established by completing packer tests in 
select geotechnical boreholes. Surface water quality samples were taken in the Project area from a spring, several 
man-made reservoirs, and from water accumulating in a nearby volcanic crater. Preliminary geochemical 
characteristics of the mined waste materials were established by analyzing 50 waste rock samples compiled from drill 
core and from two tailings samples created from metallurgical test residues. Neither the waste rock nor tailings is 
considered to be toxic per Mexican regulations. Several samples of the volcanic waste rock were measured to be 
potentially acid generating; the tailings samples are acid neutralizing. Additional test work is recommended to confirm 
the geochemical characteristics for operations management and for closure planning. 

A Conceptual Closure and Reclamation Plan has been prepared (SRK, 2014c) that outlines key activities prior to 
closure and during the closure and post-closure period. At present it is anticipated that the post-closure land use will 
be wildlife habitat, grazing, and potential future mining of underground resources.  Undisturbed portions may also be 
used for dry farming uses. The areas of the open pits, tailings, and former plant site would be restricted from public 
access. 

The closure process will include decommissioning, demolition, and rehabilitation. The decommissioning process would 
begin at the early stages of closure and would include the decommissioning of all cyanide-containing materials and 
equipment. The general reclamation process would be to break and backfill foundations and sumps, recontour for 
positive drainage, cover the regraded areas with growth medium, re-establish natural drainages, and revegetate with 
native species. A closure plan for the post-closure pit lake will be developed once sufficient hydrogeological and 
geochemical site data are available.  

A reclamation and closure cost was estimated for third-party implementation.  Rehabilitation of the major facilities was 
estimated in the cost estimate for the process plant, tailing impoundments, waste rock areas, infrastructure (buildings, 
roads, and landfill), contaminated areas, and utilities.  The reclamation and closure process is estimated to cost 
approximately US$11.1 million including a 20% contingency that applies to the closure activities but not to the post-
closure care and maintenance. 

Health and safety issues are being monitored by PMLP's Safety Department. Standardized training is being developed 
to train employees and contractors and for tracking and reporting safety incidents. By 2013, employees, consultants, 
and contractors had worked 51 months and 201,600 man hours without a lost-time injury or a medical-treatment case. 

PMLP has developed a community relations program in alignment with Coeur's corporate mission, vision, and values. 
Project personnel are in consultation with government agency representatives, local property owners, local community 
leaders, and the ejidos. Key stakeholders who are interested in being benefitted or impacted by the Project have been 
identified; interest to date in the Project has been neutral to strongly supportive.  The community relations program has 
worked to communicate consistently about the Project Plans with the communities and interested parties, to provide

   24 

information and training about care for the environment, to participate in local social programs (medical support and 
educational activities), and to assist with land acquisition, and to provide assistance in the environmental permitting 
process. 

1.15 LAND ACQUISITION AND STATUS 

1.15.1 Land and Surface Property Regulations 

Provided all the necessary rights in and to applicable surface estates and governmental permits are acquired, a Mining 
Concession grants the holder (Holder), the right to conduct all phases of exploration, exploitation, and processing 
(beneficiation) of a mineral deposit.   

The Mining Law provides that exploration, exploitation, and processing of the minerals and substances allowed under 
the Ley Minera are preferred over any other types of land use. The rights granted by a Mining Concession do not 
include rights in and to the surface estate overlying and corresponding to the dimensions of the respective Mining 
Concession, which underlies said surface estate.  Proper control of the surface estate is a key issue in terms of 
environmental permitting, exploration, exploitation, and beneficiation activities. Generally, the surface estate has to be 
either purchased or leased from the respective surface estate owner.  Alternatively, pursuant to Article 19, Section IV 
of the Ley Minera, a Holder may also acquire rights in and to the surface estate by obtaining the legal expropriation, 
temporary occupancy or creation of a land easement needed to carry out the exploration, exploitation, and beneficiation 
works, as well as for the deposit of waste rock dumps, tailings, slag's and slag dumps, and underground rights-of-way 
through adjacent mining concessions. 

1.15.2 Location and Mineral Tenure 

The Project consists of eight (8) Mining Concessions that encompass approximately 1,120 hectares (ha). PMLP holds 
100% of the registered, legal, and beneficial interest in and to these Mining Concessions.  PMLP also holds 100% of 
the registered, legal, and beneficial interest in and to three (3) additional Mining Concessions that are adjacent to, and 
contiguous with, the Project.  These three additional Mining Concessions encompass approximately 31,300 hectares 
(ha).  Combined, the eleven (11) Mining Concessions of PMLP comprise approximately 32,400 ha and together with 
approximately 1,800 ha of surface estates controlled, represent the Consolidated Property Package (Property 
Package).  

Table 1-13 provides notable information about the Mining Concessions.  Figure 1-3 depicts the location of the Mining 
Concessions, which comprise the Property Package.

The Dirección General de Minas (General Bureau of Mines) administers Mining Concessions in Mexico.  A legal survey 
(Trabajos Periciales) of each Mining Concession was completed as a requirement of, and condition precedent to, the 
General Bureau of Mines granting such Concession. 

Payment of Mining Duties are required for each Mining Concession and, each year, are payable semiannually in 
January and July to the Secretaría de Economía (Secretariat of Economy).  The Mining Duties are calculated by 
determining the correct Cuota3 (Fee), which vary based upon the age of the Mining Concession.  The Fee is then 
multiplied by the number of hectares encompassed by the Mining Concession, the product of which equals the 
semiannual Mining Duty payable for the respective Mining Concession.  A copy of the payment receipt of the Mining 
Duty must be filed with the Dirección General de Regulación Minera, a sub-directorate of the General Bureau of Mines, 
semiannually, each February and August.  
 
Annually, in May, owners of Mining Concessions must file with the Dirección de Revisión de Obligaciones, a sub-
directorate of the General Bureau of Mines, Informes Para Comprobar La Ejecución de Las Obras y Trabajos (Work 
Assessment Reports), disclosing the works to, and investments made in, each Mining Concession or sanctioned 
Agrupamiento (Group) of Mining Concessions, for the immediately preceding calendar year.  The Regulations 
promulgated under the Mining Law establish tables containing the minimum investment amounts for each Mining 
Concession or Group(s) of Mining Concessions. These amounts are updated annually in accordance with the changes 
to the Mexican Consumer Price Index (CPI) and published in the Diario Oficial De La Federación in December, 
providing the Cuotas Fija (flat fee) and Cuotas Adicional (additional flat fee), which determine the total investment the 
owner is obligated to make in each Mining Concession or Agrupamiento thereof, for the succeeding year.  In 2014, 
PMLP must invest a minimum of MXN$70,590,535.53 in Agrupamiento La Preciosa, which consist of all eleven (11) 
Mining Concessions.   

Informes Estadístico Sobre La Producción, Beneficio y Destino de Minerales o Sustancias Concesibles (Production 
Reports), detailing the production, beneficiation, and destination of concessionable minerals, must be submitted by 
annually by January 30.  These reports must be submitted for each Mining Concession bearing production and all 
Mining Concessions with over six (6) years of age, whether bearing production or not. 

The surface estates overlying the Project are owned by a mixture of ejidos4 and private parties.  

1.15.3 Issuer's Interest 

On February 20, 2013, Coeur announced it was entering into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Coeur would 
agree to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Orko, the parent company of PMLP, in a 
transaction with a total value of approximately CAD$350 million. 

On April 16, 2013, Coeur announced the completion of its acquisition of Orko pursuant to its previously announced 
plan of arrangement, detailed in the news release on February 20, 2013.  As a result of the completion of the 
arrangement, Coeur now owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of Orko.   

PMLP remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Orko, which was renamed Coeur La Preciosa Silver Corp. 

1.15.4 Royalties, Back-in Rights, Payments, Agreements, and Encumbrances 

A Consulting and Finder's Fee Agreement dated May 01, 2002, between Silver Standard Resources, Inc., the 
predecessor in interest of PMLP and La Cuesta International, Inc. (LCI).  In accordance with the terms thereof, PMLP 
 

3 The Base Rate or "Fee" is adjusted annually and published the Diario Oficial De La Federación each December for use in calculating Mining Duties payable due 
the following year. 
4 An ejido is one of two types of social property in Mexico, granted by the government that combines communal ownership with individual use.  The ejido consists 
of common use land, community development land, and individual parcels, which may be assigned to ejido members.

pays a Finder's Fee to LCI, comprised of: (I.) an advance royalty, every six (6) months, equal to the greater of (i.) 
USD$5,000 or (ii.) 2% of direct exploration costs in and to the Mining Concession San Juan, and (II.) a one-quarter of 
one percent (0.25%) NSR royalty on production derived from the Mining Concession San Juan, which is located 
adjacent to the Property Package. The maximum amount payable under the terms of the Agreement is USD$2,000,000.  
PMLP has the right, at any time, to acquire from LCI all of the NSR payable in respect to LCI, including any amount 
remaining payable under the NSR.   

Numerous Contratos de Ocupación Temporal Para La Extracción, Explotación, Uso y Aprovechamiento de Las 
Fuentes de Agua del Subsuelo (Temporary Occupancy Agreements) with local ejidos and land owners have been 
executed.  All agreements executed to date have terms of occupancy and use of between 25 to 30 years.  

1.15.5 Adjacent Properties 

Arcelia Gold Corp., through its wholly owned subsidiary, Arcelia Gold, S.A. de C.V. owns two (2) Mining Concessions 
(La Peña, and El Niño) that are adjacent to and contiguous with the El Choque Tres, El Choque Cuatro, La Preciosa, 
and San Juan Mining Concessions of PMLP. 

Canasil Resources, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary, Minera Canasil, S.A. de C.V. owns two (2) Mining 
Concessions (Carina, and Reducción Victoria Fracción B) that are adjacent to and contiguous with the San Juan Mining 
Concession of PMLP. 

1.16 MARKET CONSIDERATIONS 

The Project will produce silver and gold doré, which will be trucked from the mine site to the refinery. 

Coeur has received quotes for the secure transportation and refining of the silver-gold doré bars produced at the Project 
from parties with which it has existing business relationships.  Given the Project's proximity to Coeur's Palmarejo mine, 
the rates for secure transportation are similar to what Coeur is currently paying its secure transportation provider in the 
region.  The quote included in the financial analysis includes a fixed charge of $14,500 per shipment (up to 7,500 kg) 
plus a liability charge of $0.30 per thousand of amount declared. 

Refining terms include a treatment charge of $0.17/oz based on the net weight of the doré bars received by the refinery; 
(ii) a metal return of 99.7% of recoverable gold; and (iii) 99.92% of recoverable silver. Refining losses attributable to 
melt losses and differences in assays with the refiner is assumed to be 0.5%.  This is based on Coeur's refiner loss 
experience at Coeur's San Bartolomé mine.  No penalties are expected to be assessed against the refining.  The 
refined silver and gold is expected to be available for Coeur to sell eight business days after receipt of the doré bars 
by the refinery. 

Coeur plans to sell the refined silver and gold from the Project primarily to financial institutions, including multi-national 
banks and bullion trading houses.  The markets for both refined silver and gold are highly liquid. 

1.17 PROJECT RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES 

1.17.1 Risks 

The Project is anticipated to be a large scale (150,000 mtpd) open pit operation feeding about 10,000 mtpd to a 
processing plant.  The majority of the ore mineralization is contained within veins that will be mined and separated from 
the waste rock.  There is risk in the continuity and grade of those veins and risk in the high strip ratio if mining costs 
are not well controlled. 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128

Pursuit of the purchase or control of the necessary and convenient surface estates that overlie the Project is 
ongoing.  There are risks that some of these surface estates, or portions thereof, may not be acquired due to unrealistic 
expectations of the parties, uncured or incurable defects in the legal land title, and/or survey and legal description 
inaccuracies.  Many of the surface estates overlying the Project have been secured by long-term leasehold 
agreements.  The application for the MIAs (environmental documents) can be pursued when some minimal issues 
regarding water and power are resolved. 

Coeur has four water wells on the Project site, and an additional two water wells approximately 10 km south of the 
Project which have been drilled and water rights applied for.  Conagua, the Mexican water agency, has received 
Coeur's application for water rights and has acknowledged receipt in writing.  The two wells south of the Project have 
demonstrated capacity to produce on the order of 70 liters per second, which, in conjunction with capture of precipitation 
at the site, and dewatering of the pit, may represent sufficient water for the Project.  Coeur is also investigating 
opportunities to treat and use municipal and industrial waste water available near the Project to futher supplement 
supplies.  As of the date of this technical report Conagua is processing Coeur's application for industrial use of water 
from its wells. 

Electrical Power is available from the local grid, either from an existing 230 kV power line located approximately 12 km 
south of the Project via a connection to a 115 kV power line located approximately 41 km to the west of the Project.  
However, the local governmental agency responsible for power supply and connections (CFE) has not responded to 
requests for connections that have been proposed by the company.  Power can be obtained at lower rates than is 
being offered by CFE via wheeling of power from other sources through the CFE grid. 

Environmental permit activities need to be completed and the anticipated approval time would be about 6-9 months.   

Mining Claim maintenance fees and activities are required to maintain the status of mining concessions.  This involves 
exploration or other activities on the property as well as annual reports.  In the event of project delay, those activities 
would have to be included in the on-going activities and expenses at the site. 

Mexican mining tax and royalty rates increased in recent years but regulations governing those new laws are still not 
available and may change interpretations of how those laws will be enforced or put into effect.  Those tax and royalty 
laws were recently enacted and at a time of low metal prices.  There is about two more years of the current government 
before the next major elections. Those elections may result in a relaxation, a continuation or other changes in those 
tax and royalty laws. 

1.17.2 Opportunities 

Due to the current lower metals price environment, the availability of mining and processing equipment and associated 
terms and conditions for acquiring that equipment are very advantageous. 

The start-up of production will take approximately 2 years from date of approval.  This is a quick, but attainable, 
timetable for bringing the production on-line.  The plant and mine design are state-of-the-art but also uses well-
established technologies. 

Extended mine life is likely with improved metals prices due to the nature of the deposit.  The deposit is not closed at 
depth and still has some inferred resources that could be added to the ultimate mine production.  There are multiple 
veins within the deposit, and a quality Ore Control program could bring additional resources into the production matrix.  
There is additional exploration potential in the region and Coeur holds a large mining concession position. 

The property is close to population centers without being too close, is close to power and transportation infrastructure, 
and has a ready workforce available locally and in the region.

Reduced water needs are likely due to a combination of water in-flow into the pit at depth and from the capture of rain 
water during the rainy season. 

The opportunity to stockpile waste rock within mined out portions of the pits can reduce the haulage profile and there-
by reduce the mining costs and equipment acquisition costs for the Project. 

Power costs are available at better rates than are being offered by CFE.  The quoted reduced rates are included in the 
current evaluation but there is a highly competitive market developing in the energy sector that could result in further 
reductions in those costs. 

1.18 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

On the basis of the results of this feasibility study, it is recommended to consider completing basic engineering.  The 
Project has an estimated net present value of $87.6 million at a 5% discount rate, with an estimated internal rate of 
return of 9.5%, and a projected Project payback period of 6.9 years after taxes at the metal prices used for this study.  
Having basic engineering completed will allow the rapid start-up of construction, when the company decides to proceed 
with the Project. 

Key up-front activities during the basic engineering period include: 

Environmental  

 Continue Baseline environmental monitoring, including the monitoring of the piezometers and weather station.  
Additional geochemical testing of tailings residues by humidity cells is recommended to confirm the long-term 
geochemical behavior. Initiate the air monitoring with contractors to have baseline information. 

 Complete Archeological Survey.  
 Reinitiate MIA applications for road construction and Project. 

Land 

 Continue with land acquisitions and right of ways (ROWs) for road and ancillary activities (power/water). 
 Maintain mining claim rights through exploration programs. 

Power 

 Pursue 230 kVA connection point approval with CFE. 

Metallurgy 

It is recommended metallurgical developments continue to support optimization of process parameters: 

 Optimization of leach parameters with Lithology and Variability composites; commercial tank pressure leach, 
temperature, and particle size. 

 Evaluation of alternate technology: CELP, or equivalent, provided the development is stepwise, and without 
commercial obligations prior to proving the technology. 

 Continue development of the geometallurgy model with additional sampling, bottle roll, and QEMSCAN 
analysis. 

 An allowance for additional metallurgical test work is approximately $600,000. 

Plant Design 

 Initiate Basic Plant Design.

Water Rights 

 Continue process to obtain water rights or confirmation of water rights dependent upon operation/approval of 
the Project. 

Tailing Design 

 Collection of site specific meteorological and hydrology data.  These data will be used to refine seasonal run 
off values and design storms to be used in future detailed design work.   

 Optimization of the water balance to incorporate updated run off and process flow estimates, in order to 
maximize the available reclaim back to the process.  The TSF water balance should be combined with the 
site wide water balance for the Project. 

 Additional site investigations should be completed as part of detailed design.  The investigations should focus 
on construction materials and foundation conditions, with particular focus on the potential for large voids to be 
present in the near surface bedrock within the basin and below the embankments. 

 The tailings materials and properties should be reviewed during detailed design to be sure they are 
representative, especially if any changes to the process occur or as more representative tailings samples 
become available.  

 Development of a full closure plan for the TSF based on the final design configuration.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 LOCATION AND MINERAL TENURE 

The Project is located in the state of Durango, Mexico, within the municipalities of Pánuco de Coronado and Canatlán, 
and is approximately 85 km by existing road, northeast of the city of Victoria de Durango, the state capital.  A new 
access road is anticipated to be constructed which would reduce this to a distance of 50 km and a time of 45 minutes. 

The Project is situated on the eastern flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range and can be found on the 
Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática (INEGI) General Carlos Real Topographic Map G13D72 and 
is centered on coordinates 24°25'42.4200"N Latitude and 104°27'27.2380"W Longitude (554,987.8815mE, 
2,701,771.0046mN) in the Universal Transverse Mercator (WGS 84), Zone 13R (Northern Hemisphere).  A General 
Location Map of the Project is provided in Figure 4-1. 

 
 

Figure 4-1: General Location Map 

The Project consists of eight Mining Concessions that encompass approximately 1,120 hectares (Has.). PMLP holds 
100% of the registered, legal, and beneficial interest in and to these Mining Concessions.  PMLP also holds 100% of 
the registered, legal, and beneficial interest in and to three (3) additional Mining Concessions that are adjacent to, and 
contiguous with, the Project.  These three additional Mining Concessions encompass approximately 31,300 hectares 
(Has.).  Combined, the eleven (11) Mining Concessions of PMLP comprise approximately 32,400 hectares (Has.) and,

Figure 4-2: Map of the Project Consolidated Property Package 

The Dirección General de Minas (General Bureau of Mines) administers Mining Concessions in Mexico.  A legal survey 
(Trabajos Periciales) of each Mining Concession was completed as a requirement of, and condition precedent to, the 
General Bureau of Mines granting such Concession. 

Pursuant to an amendment of the Mexican Mining Law (Law), by Congressional Decree of February 22, 2005, which 
was published in the Diaro Oficial de la Federación April 28, 2005, there is no longer any distinction between an 
Exploration Concession and an Exploitation Concession.  Consequently, all Concessions are "Mining Concessions" 
(Exploration and Exploitation), and as a result, all Exploration and Exploitation Concessions have been converted into 
Mining Concessions, expiring fifty years (50) from the date they were originally granted. 
 
Payment of Mining Duties are required for each Mining Concession and, each year, are payable semiannually in 
January and July to the Secretaría de Economía (Secretariat of Economy).  The Mining Duties are calculated by 
determining the correct Cuota7 (Fee), which vary based upon the age of the Mining Concession.  The Fee is then 
multiplied by the number of hectares encompassed by the Mining Concession, the product of which equals the 
semiannual Mining Duty payable for the respective Mining Concession.  A copy of the payment receipt of the Mining 
Duty must be filed with the Dirección General de Regulación Minera, a sub-directorate of the General Bureau of Mines, 
semiannually, each February and August.  

Annually, in May, owners of Mining Concessions must file with the Dirección de Revisión de Obligaciones, a sub-
directorate of the General Bureau of Mines, Informes Para Comprobar La Ejecucion de Las Obras y Trabajos (Work 
Assessment Reports), disclosing the works to, and investments made in, each Mining Concession or sanctioned 
 

7 The Base Rate or "Fee" is adjusted annually and published the Diario Oficial De La Federación each December for use in calculating Mining Duties payable due 
the following year.

Agrupamiento (Group) of Mining Concessions, for the immediately preceding calendar year.  The Regulations of the 
Mining Law establish tables containing the minimum investment amounts for each Mining Concession or Group(s) of 
Mining Concessions.  These amounts are updated annually in accordance with the changes to the Mexican Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) and published in the Diario Oficial De La Federación in December, providing the Cuotas Fija (flat fee) 
and Cuotas Adicional (additional flat fee), which determine the total investment the owner is obligated to make in each 
Mining Concession or Group thereof, for the succeeding year.  In 2014, PMLP must invest a minimum of 
MXN$70,590,535.53 in Agrupamiento La Preciosa, which consist of all eleven (11) Mining Concessions.   

Informes Estadístico Sobre La Producción, Beneficio y Destino de Minerales o Sustancias Concesibles (Production 
Reports), detailing the production, beneficiation, and destination of concessionable minerals, must be submitted by 
annually by January 30.  These reports must be submitted for each Mining Concession bearing production and all 
Mining Concessions with over six (6) years of age, whether bearing production or not. 

The surface estates overlying the Project are owned by a mixture of ejidos8 and private parties. 

4.2 ISSUER'S INTEREST 

On February 20, 2013, Coeur Mining, Inc. (Coeur) announced it was entering into a definitive agreement pursuant to 
which Coeur would agree to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Orko, the parent company of 
PMLP, in a transaction with a total value of approximately CAD$350 million. 

On April 16, 2013, Coeur announced the completion of its acquisition of Orko pursuant to its previously announced 
plan of arrangement, detailed in the news release on February 20, 2013.  As a result of the completion of the 
arrangement, Coeur now owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of Orko.   

Proyectos Mineros La Preciosa, S.A. de C.V. remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Orko.

4.4 ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND PERMITS 

Please refer to Section 20 for a discussion regarding environmental and permitting factors related to the Project. 

4.5 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND RISKS 

Pursuit of the purchase or control of the necessary and convenient surface estates that overlie the Project is 
ongoing.  There are risks that some of these surface estates, or portions thereof, may not be acquired due to unrealistic 
expectations of the parties, uncured or incurable defects in the legal land title, and/or survey and legal description 
inaccuracies.   

The accuracy and completeness of ownership records maintained by the several Registros Públicos de la Propiedad 
y del Commercio (RPPyC) and Direcciones de Catastro within the state of Durango varies greatly.  Prior to commencing 
negotiations for the purchase or control of a surface estate, legal land titles are thoroughly abstracted to determine 
legal ownership and the defects affecting validity of said ownership.  Many Certificados and Constancias, issued by 
the several RPPyC, Direcciones de Recaudación, and Registros Agrario Nacional (RAN), are requested and obtained, 
in order to cross reference our own research with that of these government entities.  Any disparities between the two 
are flagged for curing or ameliorating the title risk(s).   

Well before consummating the purchase or leasehold transaction, each surface estate parcel is surveyed in the field 
using high-precision equipment manufactured by Trimble Navigation, LTD.  Any discrepancies between the survey 
results, legal descriptions within the chain of title, and/or previous surveys are analyzed and curative actions are taken 
to formally reconcile and/or correct the legal dimensions of said surface estate.    

Many of the surface estates overlying the Project have been secured by long-term leasehold agreements.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 LOCATION ACCESS 

The Property is located approximately 85 km by existing roads, northeast of the city of Durango and can be accessed 
by vehicle from Durango in approximately 90 minutes.  Figure 5-1 shows the Project's regional location.  A Google 
satellite map showing the location of the Property relative to Durango and the access roads is shown in Figure 5-2.  
From Durango, travel northeast toward Torreón by sealed Federal Highway 40, to the town of Francisco I. Madero.  
From this point, a secondary paved road is followed northwest to the village of Lázaro Cárdenas, then by newly paved 
road to the village of Francisco R. Serrano.  After 9 km, turn and traverse a newly paved road in a southwest direction 
to the village of Francisco Javier Mina, then travel in a southerly direction for 5.5 km by gravel road to the access road 
to the Project site.  The access road is a 3.5 km gravel road heading southeast and leads to the portal of the historic 
workings and the main camp of the Project. 

A much shorter site access road is planned to go from Highway 40 directly to the site and avoid the small communities.  
This road is also anticipated to be aligned with the anticipated water pipeline route.  Land acquisitions and road right 
of way with local landowners are in progress.

5.2 CLIMATE AND LENGTH OF OPERATING SEASON 

The Property area has a semi-arid climate, with an annual average temperature of about 25°C and an average annual 
precipitation of about 600 millimeters (mm), usually occurring between May and October.  Temperatures can fall below 
freezing on winter nights but snow is rare.  Mining activities can take place year round.  The dominant wind direction is 
southeast.   

5.3 PROXIMITY TO POPULATION CENTER AND TRANSPORT 

Durango is the capital city of Durango State and has a population of over 600,000.  One of the major industries in 
Durango is mining, particularly for silver, and the region is expected to be a good source of skilled personnel, support 
services, and mining equipment.  The city of Durango is served by an international airport with daily flights connecting 
to destinations in México and connections to the United States.  Durango is situated along Mexican Federal Highway 
40, which connects Durango to Mazatlán, approximately 310 km to the southwest on the Pacific coast, and to Torreón, 
approximately 245 km to the northeast.  A railway line runs between Durango and Torreón and connects to other cities 
in México and the United States.   

5.4 SURFACE RIGHTS, LAND AVAILABILITY, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND LOCAL RESOURCES 

5.4.1 Surface Rights, Land Availability, and Mining Areas 

The Project area includes suitable sites for construction of the plant and infrastructure for the mine.  A plan of the 
proposed pits, dumps, TSF, plant, and infrastructure is shown in Figure 5-3. 

Surface rights in the Project area are held by a combination of private landowners, ejidos, and ejidatarios, which are 
ejido members with rights to use specific tracts of land within the ejido.  Ejidos are areas of communal land used for 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT

5.4.2 Ownership 

Coeur has verified who the registered land owners are who hold surface rights within the boundaries of the proposed 
mining activities.  Contacts have been established with all registered surface holders and negotiations have been 
completed or are in progress with all involved individuals and/or groups. 

5.4.3 Power, Infrastructure, and Water 

The quality of infrastructure and the population density increases towards the city of Durango.  The Property is not 
currently connected to the commercial electrical grid, but the nearby village of Francisco Javier Mina (population around 
920) and the town of Francisco I. Madero (population around 4,550) are serviced by the commercial electrical grid.  
The Property presently is supplied electrical power by one 65-kilowatt (kW) diesel generator and two smaller 5.5 kW 
diesel generators. The main power grid for Durango follows a paved federal highway and a power connection. There 
is currently an application in to CFE to connect a trunk line to the existing 230kv power line located adjacent to the 
Ruta 40, about 12 km from the site. 

The town of Francisco I. Madero has a Pemex gas station and the services of metal fabricators and mechanic shops.  
A railway line is present near the south boundary of the Property and the railway has a direct line to Torreón, the site 
of the nearest metal smelter.  The smelter is owned by Met-Mex Peñoles S.A. de C.V. and is a primary producer of 
lead and zinc.  The facility also has a silver refinery, which has the capacity to refine 120,000 kilos of silver per month. 

Presently the Property has six core storage sheds, an office, lunch room, washrooms, small warehouse, flammable 
substances storage area, drilling company workshop, night watchman's accommodation, and a generator/core cutting 
shed.   

The water for drilling and services is obtained from a water reservoir in Francisco Javier Mina, charged at a rate of 
$500 Mexican Pesos per 1.75 cubic meters (m3), including the cost to haul water to the Project by tanker trucks to 
water tanks located adjacent to the drilling areas. Water for mining production is proposed to be supplied from aquifers 
to the south and east of the Project.  Two large diameter water wells have been drilled on property 9.7 km to the south 
of the Project.  Permits for these wells and the water rights have been submitted to CONAGUA and are being processed 
and permitted. Water reuse will be maximized to minimize the water cost to the Project.  

5.4.4 Local Resources and Mining Personnel 

There is expected to be sufficient qualified local work force available in Durango and the surrounding region for Project 
construction and operation.  Durango is approximately 45 minutes away from the Project site. An inventory of the local 
education levels, employment levels and skill sets of the two nearest population centers, Ricardo Flores Magón and 
Francisco Javier Mina, have been conducted.  Current employment levels and the skills and abilities found in the local 
communities are shown in Table 5-1 and Table 5-2, respectively. Additional detail on distance of various communities 
to the site, population, and the number of potentially active workers is found in Table 5-3.

5.5 TOPOGRAPHY, ELEVATION, AND VEGETATION 

The Property lies on the western edge of the high plains of northern México, an extensive volcanic plateau 
characterized by narrow, northwest-trending ranges separated by wide, flat-floored filled basins.  In the Durango area, 
the basins have elevations of between 1,900 m to 2,100 m above sea level and the higher peaks rise to 3,000 m.  The 
Property elevation in the area of the mineralized zones at the Property is between 1,990 m and 2,265 m.  The highest 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128

   48 

elevations on the Property are at the northwest trending La Preciosa Ridge, which overlies the La Gloria and 
Abundancia veins.  A broad valley forms to the east of the ridge and extends approximately 1 km toward another lower 
lying ridge to the northeast.  Grasses, small shrubs, and cactuses comprise the typical vegetation on the steep hillsides 
with larger bushes and mesquite trees in the lower lying areas near springs and streams.  Nearby farmers produce 
beans and maize with groundwater sourced from thick gravel beds in the surrounding plains or via dry farming during 
the rainy season.  Local cattle graze on land dominated by rocky soils supporting nopal (prickly pear) and huizache 
(acacia) scrubland.

6 HISTORY 

In the late 19th century, the Property was known as Mina La Preciosa.   Early work was focused on the north end of La 
Preciosa Ridge where the Gloria and Abundancia veins outcropped to surface.  Mining ceased at the onset of the 
Mexican Revolution, in 1910, and further mining did not occur until the 1970s.  It has been estimated by Orko personnel 
that a total of ~30,000 tonnes was extracted during that time (Mining Plus, 2012). 

Luismin (Compania Mineras Minas San Luis) operated under the name Minera Thesalia as a joint venture with Tormex 
S.A. and conducted exploration on the property in 1981, 1982, 1988 and 1994.  This work consisted of a surface and 
underground channel sampling program, a single east-west line of induced polarization (IP) resistivity across the 
property, and drilled seven diamond drill core holes totaling 1319 meters.  This included five surface drillholes targeting 
the Gloria and Abundancia veins 50-75 meters below the primary underground workings, and two holes drilled from 
within those older workings. 

Luismin expanded the historic underground workings to a size of approximately 3 meters by 3 meters. This allowed for 
the underground drilling and also for a program of channel sampling.  A reported 11,739 tonnes of material was 
removed from the sides of the historic underground workings at reported grades of 0.43 g/t Au and 157 g/t Ag.   That 
material was stockpiled outside the portal of those underground workings and is still in-place.  While Luismin staff did 
calculate several Mineral Resource estimates during that time, based on limited information, the channel sampling and 
shallow drilling were not used for the calculation of the current Mineral Resources.  

Orko Gold Corp. (subsequently Orko Silver Corp.) entered into a joint venture (JV) agreement with Luismin in 2003 
and subsequently acquired the control of the property with Luismin maintaining a royalty. 

Orko performed a series of exploration programs beginning in 2005 and lasting until 2008, and drilled 388 core holes 
for a total of 152,368 meters on targets at Orito, San Juan and La Preciosa.  Additional surface sampling and mapping 
was also performed during that time. 

Orko signed a JV agreement with Pan-American Silver (PAS) in 2009.  PAS drilled 363 drillholes for a total of 91,096 
meters during 2009-2010.  The desired result was a Measured Resource to support a feasibility study issued in 2012 
by Quantitative Geoscience Pty. Ltd. and included a Technical Report by Snowden done in 2011 (Snowden, 2011a).  
PAS work included the use of some drillholes for geotechnical purposes, and four metallurgical test programs 
performed by SGS Mineral Services in Durango, Mexico.  Problems with those metallurgical test programs were noted 
by Snowden and future work was recommended.  However, a table of Mineral Resources was produced as a result of 
the Mining Plus Updated Mineral Resource Estimate prepared for Orko in 2012 (Mining Plus, 2012). A QP has not 
done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves; and (ii) Coeur 
is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.  The resources are presented 
for the disclosure for historical purposes only.

In April 2013, the acquisition of Orko was completed by Coeur.  Since completion of the acquisition, activities have 
included land and water resources acquisition plus additional efforts on geological and technical studies.  All involved 
property owners were identified and their titles verified to be in good standing prior to acquisition of surface rights. 

6.1 WATER 

Two wells were drilled by Coeur in an aquifer located about 10 km due south of the proposed plant site.  The wells 
were drilled on advice from CONAGUA, the water resource monitoring agency, and were drilled and completed with 
guidance from a respected hydrologist.  This resulted in two wells with demonstrated large capacity, anticipated to 
meet or exceed the required 80 L/s needed for plant and mine operations. 

In addition, four existing small diameter wells, previously drilled to provide water for grazing, were logged, cased and 
had pumps installed in them.  These wells were located in the vicinity of the proposed TSF and are anticipated to be 
plugged and abandoned prior to construction of the tailing dam.  These wells were not suitable for plant operational 
needs due to low capacity; however, a water right application was submitted for those wells at the same time as the 
application was submitted for the two larger wells. The water rights for those four wells have been granted and are 
being registered in the Regional and National offices of CONAGUA.  Those water rights can be transferred within the 
aquifer and used for other uses such as monitor wells, dewatering and other uses. 

6.2 GEOLOGIC MODELING PROGRAMS 

In addition to the new data generated by the drilling programs, differences were noted in prior ore-body model data 
quality.  As a result, all prior core logs were reviewed and interpreted via a common core logging system and re-entered 
into the model.  As a result, finer details that had been previously logged but not entered into the model were able to 
be captured for future interpretation.  This has resulted in common naming conventions, notations on mineralization 
type and oxidation states, alteration codes and host rock naming conventions.  This greatly improved the quality of the 
ore-body model. 

Over 1,400 new mineral density measurements were taken across a broad spectrum of both mineralized and non-
mineralized sections of the model.  This included both new and older core measurements and greatly improved the 
density data within the model.

A review of the prior core also resulted in the discovery that not all mineralized sections of the core had been reviewed 
by Orko.  A re-sampling effort was undertaken to identify additional mineralized zones and also to sample zones 
between and adjacent to known veins to define if there was mineralization in those rock masses. This included 252 
new assays of existing core.  This resulted in defining some additional mineralized material that can be mined via bulk 
mining methods as well as providing guidance on the actual grade of material that will be assumed as dilution grade 
when the veins are mined. 

During a review of the prior Orko data, it was also discovered that they had used a less expensive laboratory procedure 
of a 3-acid digestion rather than the ISO standard 4-acid digestion for AA (atomic adsorption) chemical analysis. Pulps 
for these samples were removed from storage and submitted for re-analysis.  This included approximately 6,400 pulps 
located at the site and some ~800 located at a remote storage location in Canada.  These were re-analyzed, with new 
standards and blanks, and compared to the prior data set.  This resulted in a ~15% increase in grade that would be 
applied to a portion of the deposit, for a likely 5% increase in anticipated plant feed grade. 

New structural models were defined for the deposit and regional areas.  Clay alteration testing was performed to define 
age/temperature/chemical relationships within the veins so that future testing could be compared to those results.  

6.3 METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Metallurgical testing performed by Orko showed recoveries that had considerable variation.  A review of that data 
showed that there was no testing performed to optimize recovery and that the testing was done with a variety of 
conditions.  New programs of metallurgical testing were performed to define the optimum conditions for the testing and 
then re-perform that testing within those defined optimums. 

This includes flotation and leaching testing at optimized pH, reagent addition levels and retention times to provide 
circuit design and operating characteristics.   

Flotation testing did not prove to be a viable alternative due to low quality concentrate grades and low recoveries.  
Whole ore leaching, at a grind of 75 microns, was found to provide optimized recovery in agitated leaching applications.  
This metallurgical process is designed to feed a Merrill-Crowe plant to produce doré at site.  

Additional testing was initiated to define leach recovery potential for heap leaching of low-grade ores.  This testing was 
initiated with bottle roll tests based on previously-defined pH and reagent levels. 

6.4 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 

The Project was divided into two study areas for environmental applications: one for the mine area and one for the 
access, power and waterlines.  All plant and animal studies and clearances, surface and groundwater baseline data, 
drainage basin studies and storm water drainage volumes and flows were defined. Local and site studies have been 
completed for groundwater characterization (water quality, water level, pit-inflow rates), surface water quality, and 
geochemical characterization of mining wastes (waste rock and tailings). Monitoring and management plans have been 
developed for groundwater monitoring, waste rock, tailings, prevention and control of potential petroleum and chemical 
spills, sediment control plans, and tailing designs were completed based on those studies. A mine closure and 
reclamation plan and closure cost estimate has been prepared.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The Project is situated on the eastern flank of the Cretaceous to mid-Tertiary Sierra Madre Occidental (Figure 7-1).  
The SMO is the largest silicic igneous province in North America and it stretches from the USA-Mexico border to the 
latitude of Guadalajara, where the SMO is covered by the late Miocene to Quaternary Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. 

The SMO is part of the Basin and Range physiographic province where magmatism and tectonism were related to the 
subduction of the Farallon Plate beneath North America.  Physiographically, the core of the SMO forms the boundary 
between the Mexican Basin and Range Province to the east and the Gulf Extensional Province to the west. 

Figure 7-1 shows a simplified geological map of Northern Mexico showing the main assemblages of the Sierra Madre 
Occidental (from Ferrari et al., 2007). The Lower Volcanic Complex is shown in blue and the Upper Volcanic 
Supergroup is shown in pink and orange.  

 

Figure 7-1: Simplified Geological Map of Northern Mexico (from Ferrari et al., 2007) 

The stratigraphy of the SMO comprises the following main sequences: 

 Late Cretaceous to Paleocene plutonic rocks; 
 Paleocene-Eocene (ca. 67-55 Ma) andesites and lesser rhyolites, traditionally grouped into the Lower 

Volcanic Complex (LVC; McDowell and Keizer, 1977);  
 Silicic ignimbrites mainly deposited during two pulses; e.g., Oligocene (ca. 32-28 Ma) and Early Miocene (ca. 

24-20 Ma), and grouped into the Upper Volcanic Supergroup (UVS; McDowell and Keizer, 1977);  
 Transitional basaltic-andesitic lavas that erupted toward the end of, and after, each ignimbrite pulse; and  
 Post-subduction volcanism consisting of alkaline basalts and ignimbrites deposited in the Late Miocene, 

Pliocene, and Pleistocene.

In the area, deformed metasedimentary rocks of Cretaceous age are exposed in small windows through the Tertiary 
volcanic rocks of the SMO.  These consist of folded and foliated clastic metasedimentary rocks that are unconformably 
overlain by undeformed Early Tertiary conglomerate and sandstone of the Ahuichila Formation (Aguirre-Diaz and 
McDowell, 1993), which are in turn overlain by a sequence of intermediate tuffs, flows and agglomerate of the 
Paleocene-Eocene age LVC.  The LVC sequence is overlain by a thick sequence of rhyolite and intermediate to felsic 
ignimbrite, tuff, and volcanic breccia of Oligocene-age that are exposed along cliffs to the west of the Project. 

The region is transected by the regional northwest-striking San Luis-Tepehuanes fault system (Nieto-Samaniego et al., 
1999), which roughly coincides with the eastern margin of the SMO.  This fault system comprises a complex network 
of northwest- to north-striking, west-dipping fault segments that are associated with east to northeast tilting of Tertiary 
stratigraphy. In the Durango region, the fault system is made up of north-northwest trending normal faults and 
associated (half) grabens that were active during two stages of extension between ca. 32 and 24 Ma (Nieto-Samaniego 
et al., 1999). The basins and parts of the lower hills in the region are covered with varying thicknesses of Pliocene to 
Pleistocene basalt that erupted from numerous vents now marked by small volcanic cinder cones and domes.

7.2 REGIONAL MINERAL DEPOSITS 

Mineral deposits of the Sierra Madre Occidental plateau and the La Preciosa District consist mainly of silver and gold 
mineralization with or without significant base metal components.  The known deposits form a northwest-trending belt 
from the state of Zacatecas and the large Fresnillo silver deposit on the south east to the Guanaceví silver deposit near 
the border with the state of Chihuahua. 

Adjacent to the Project, approximately 18 km to the northeast, is the historic Avino property, and in particular the Avino 
and San Gonzalo veins and stockwork system, which is considered a low- to intermediate-sulphidation Ag-Au-copper 
(Cu) epithermal deposit similar to other deposits in the Mexican silver belt. 

Approximately 50 km north of the Project, is the El Castillo Mine (Argonaut Gold is the operator), which is thought to 
be a porphyry-style gold system related to Oligocene granodiorite-diorite porphyries that intrude Cretaceous clastic 
and carbonate sediments in an extensional tectonic setting.  Gold mineralization occurs throughout the magmatic-
hydrothermal system. 

 

Figure 7-3: Mineral Deposits in the Project Area (from M3, 2013) 

The nearest large mine is the Mina Avino of Avino Silver & Gold Mines Ltd., 20 km to the northeast of the Project, near 
the town of Pánuco de Coronado.  The current mine operated from 1974 to 2001.  Mill throughput reached 1,000 tonnes 
per day (tpd) in the 1990s, but mining was suspended in 2001 due to low metal prices. The Avino veins were reported 
to contain approximately 140 g/t Ag, 1.4 g/t Au, and 0.5 % Cu.  A drilling program is currently underway at Avino. 

San Sebastian, located 60 km to the east of the Project, contains a number of productive vein systems including 
Francine, Don Sergio and Andrea.  Production by Hecla from the Francine vein was high-grade silver, with significant

   55 

gold values. Mineralization occurs in poly-phase chalcedonic quartz veins with an average width of 1.6 m. Production 
from the Don Sergio vein was high-grade gold, with some silver values.  Several epithermal veins exist within the San 
Sebastian valley.  The Francine, Professor, Middle and North vein systems are hosted within a series of shale units, 
with interbedded fine-grained sandstones.  The Don Sergio, Jessica, Andrea, and Antonella veins located in the Cerro 
Pedernalito area, about 6 km from the Francine vein, are hosted in the same formation, with the addition of diorite 
intrusion.  Mining ceased in 2005, however, Hecla is continuing with an active exploration program in the area, in 
particular on the Hugh Zone. 

Directly adjacent to the Project on the west is the San Juan project of Silver Standard.  Orko conducted prospecting, 
geological mapping and some surface sampling.  Vein targets, La Plomosa, La Plomosa Sur, El Vaquero, San Juan, 
Nancy Sur and the down-dip projection of the Nancy ein, are known on the San Juan property. La Plomosa vein has 
approximately 80 meters of historical drifting and one drillhole.   

Immediately south of La Plomosa and San Juan are the large Victoria and Salamandra concessions of Canasil 
Resources Inc. under joint venture with Blackcomb Minerals Inc.  Salamandra is a skarn silver-zinc-copper prospect. 

La Parrilla mine of First Majestic Silver Corporation, is located near the Durango – Zacatecas border, approximately 
65 km southeast of the city of Durango and 80 km south of the Project.  La Parrilla is currently in production at a rate 
of 800 tpd. First Majestic is focusing on the La Rosa/Los Rosarios, San Marcos, San José, San Nicolás, Vacas, 
Quebradilla, La Luz and Recuerdo structures.  The silver-lead-zinc mineralization is hosted in vein-fault zones, breccias 
and replacement bodies.  These occur within the porphyritic diorite intrusive rocks and in the adjacent limestone, skarn, 
and hornfels rocks.  While the geology is different than that at the Project, it does illustrate another example of precious 
metal mineral endowment in the region. 

There are numerous precious metal exploration and expansion projects underway in Durango State and adjacent 
areas, including Metates, La Cienega, La Parrilla, Pitarrilla, Guanacevi, San Agustin, Peñasquito, Santa Cruz, San 
Sebastian and Topia, as well as an expansion at the Tayoltita (San Dimas) operations. Neighboring Zacatecas state 
is also very active. 

7.3 LOCAL GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS 

7.3.1 Local Geology 

The oldest rocks on the property are Jurassic-Cretaceous metasedimentary graphitic schist, chlorite schist, and layers 
of quartzite (Figure 7-4 and Figure 7-5).  These metasedimentary rocks do not outcrop at surface but are intersected 
in drill core.  Overlying the metasedimentary sequence is a thick package of unmetamorphosed polylithic conglomerate 
containing lenses of arkosic sandstone of unknown age. 

The sedimentary package is overlain by intermediate tuff and agglomerate of the regional Tertiary age Lower Volcanic 
Complex.  In places, the flows are porphyritic, or glomeroporphyritic and the tuffs are partly welded.  The youngest 
rocks within the property are basalt flows that erupted from several Pleistocene-age volcanic vents and which now fill 
the lower valleys.  Cerro Prieto, Cerro Blanco, and Cerro La Chicharronera are prominent examples of the volcanic 
vents.  Other nearby (9 km west) volcanic vents is the Holocene age, La Breña-El Jagüey maar complex, which is part 
of the Durango Volcanic Field.  Sporadic mafic to felsic dikes and sills of unknown age are found in the deeper parts 
of the area and rarely at surface. 

The area contains a series of Tertiary-age silver-bearing (±gold) epithermal quartz veins associated with barite, fluorite, 
and sporadic base metals, primarily zinc and lead.  There are two major vein and vein-breccia systems exposed on a 
series of hills and ridges, which are separated by a flat-floored valley roughly 800 m wide.  The conglomerate and 
Tertiary Lower Volcanic andesitic rocks are the main host rocks for quartz veins, although vein mineralization does 
extend into the basement metasedimentary rocks.

The main veins system on the Abundancia Ridge consists of dominantly south-striking and west-dipping veins plus 
east-southeast-striking, south dipping crosscutting veins.  For example, the Abundancia Ridge vein system has been 
traced on surface for more than 1.5 km, and drilling has revealed that the veins continue to the north, beneath basalt 
cover. 

Along the eastern side of the Project, a series of hills expose a north- to northwest-striking, shallow west-dipping vein 
system with associated hanging wall veining and alteration.  This vein system is referred to as the Martha vein or fault 
zone and has been traced by drilling for over 2.5 km along strike. 

Mineralization at the Project is hosted within multiple discrete poly-phase quartz veins, often displaying banded, smoky, 
drusy, and chalcedony textures. Also in each stage there is variably crustiform banded fracture fill/breccia cement 
mineralogy.  Fluorite, amethyst, a substantial number of barite laths, calcite, and rhodochrosite may also be present, 
and sulfide mineralization in the form of sphalerite, galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite, acanthite, sparse native silver and free 
gold, as well as iron and manganese oxides have been noted in drill core.  The principal silver bearing mineral at the 
Project is acanthite-pseudomorphic after argentite or as microcrystalline to amorphous grains. 

Vein mineralization does extend into the basement metasedimentary rocks, but its extent and distribution is not well 
understood.  The main vein system on the Abundancia ridge consists of dominantly southward-striking and westward-
dipping veins plus east-southeast–striking, south-dipping crosscutting veins.  The Abundancia ridge vein system has 
been traced on surface for over 1.5 km.  Along the eastern part of the Project, a series of hillocks expose a north- to 
northwest-striking, shallow west-dipping vein system with associated hanging wall veining and alteration.  This vein 
system is referred to as the Martha vein or fault zone and has been traced by drilling for over 2.5 km along strike. 

Examination of mineralized samples identified mainly argentite, tennantite/tetrahedrite, and Ag sulphosalts in samples.  
The majority of gold/electrum is inter-grown with or occupying the same paragenetic position as argentite, silver 
sulphosalts, sphalerite and galena, mostly transitional between quartz and carbonate/iron carbonate in formation. 

Wall rocks hosting mineralization are variably silicified, with proximal patchy illite-smectite alteration and distal chlorite 
alteration.  The presence of manganocalcite has been noted in several drillholes, but it is not uniformly distributed.  In 
shallower drillholes, pyrolusite and limonite often appear on fracture surfaces. 

The host rocks and veins have undergone intense weathering.  The base of oxidation is erratically distributed as 
weathering is controlled by the presence of post mineralization faults which allowed the percolation of oxidized meteoric 
groundwater to vertical depths of 350 m below surface.  Weathering minerals include iron oxides, iron carbonates, 
manganese oxides, and unidentified clays.

7.3.2 Lithological Units 

The main rock types occurring in the Project area include volcanic flows, pyroclastic rocks, sedimentary rocks (clastic 
and epiclastic rocks), metamorphic rocks, and subvolcanic dikes.  The lithological descriptions below include the 
alteration products that were most commonly observed. 

Volcanic Flows:  Distinctive volcanic flows include vesicular basalt, basaltic andesite, and latite to andesite.  The 
lithology logs also include rhyolite.  Rhyolite flows were not observed during the alteration study.  Quartz-phaneritic 
felsic crystal-lithic tuff is abundant in the northeastern part of the property, and it is possible that rhyolite flows occur 
within that unit. 

Vesicular basalt:  Vesicular basalt is the youngest lithology in the property.  It forms sub-horizontal flows that cover 
the tilted volcanic, pyroclastic, and volcaniclastic sequence beneath.  The vesicular basalt unit is black, fine-grained, 
and has abundant vesicles.  It commonly overlays a paleosol horizon that varies in thickness from tens of centimeters 
to meters.  The vesicular basalt unit is not affected by visible hydrothermal alteration. 

Basaltic andesite:  Basaltic andesite is dark purple-brown, sparsely porphyritic, with phenocrysts that average less 
than 1 mm in length.  Phenocrysts and to a lesser degree groundmass are commonly altered to carbonate. 

Latite to andesite:  Latite to andesite is beige colored, porphyritic, with few feldspar phenocrysts and few mafic 
phenocrysts.  Feldspar phenocrysts are variably altered to clay, mafic phenocrysts are variably altered to chlorite, clay, 
pyrite, or hematite after pyrite, and groundmass is variably altered to clay. 

Pyroclastic Rocks:  Distinctive volcanic pyroclastic lithologies include lapilli-tuff breccia, crystal-lapilli tuff, felsic 
crystal-lapilli tuff-breccia, and lesser mafic lapilli tuff and mafic crystal tuff. 

Lapilli-tuff-breccia:  Lapilli-tuff-breccia is the most widespread pyroclastic lithology observed in the deposit.  It has a 
dark green to brown green magmatic, porphyritic matrix enclosing angular lithic clasts and juvenile clasts of various 
sizes.  Minor agglomerate and clastic horizons occur within the lapilli-tuff-breccia.  Lapilli-tuff-breccia is consistently 
classified as agglomerate in lithology logs.  However, according to the pyroclastic rock classification, the term 
agglomerate should only be applied for pyroclastic rocks that contain over 75% pyroclasts greater than 64 mm, whereas 
the lapilli-tuff-breccia commonly contains over 40% magmatic matrix.  Intervals of autobreccia were also observed 
locally. 

Significant differences in composition between magmatic matrix and lithic clasts makes this unit favorable for patchy 
alteration facies. Smectite clay is a common secondary mineral in the lapilli-tuff-breccia, and may be a product of 
devitrification of the magmatic matrix and of juvenile clasts, or of hydrothermal activity. 

Crystal-lapilli-tuff:  The lapilli-tuff-breccia (described above) grades into intervals of crystal-lapilli-tuff and lapilli-tuff 
that is up to several meters thick.  Flow banding is observed locally in the form of aligned lapilli.  Feldspar crystals are 
variably altered to clay, which are most commonly kaolinite or illite. 

Felsic crystal-lapilli-tuff-breccia:  Felsic crystal-lapilli-tuff-breccia has abundant quartz crystals, subangular to 
angular porphyritic lithic lapilli, and numerous fiamme enclosed in a light reddish-brown to white or light green-white 
magmatic matrix.  This unit occurs in the northeast portion of the Project area, and includes intervals of felsic 
crystal±lapilli-tuff up to several meters wide that locally contain that contains feldspar crystals.  Feldspar crystals and 
lithic clasts are variably altered to clays. 

Sedimentary Rocks:  Sedimentary rocks include conglomerate, sandstone, and minor siltstone and shale. 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
   60 

Sedimentary Breccia and Conglomerate:  Greenish-grey to brown, matrix to clast supported, moderately to poorly, 
and locally well sorted polylithic sedimentary breccia to conglomerate is the most widespread sedimentary lithology.  
Weak carbonate and hematite cement are common.  Disseminated, fine-grained euhedral pyrite is commonly observed 
within the cement.  Locally the matrix is completely replaced by epidote. 

Sandstone:  Sandstone forms lenses that are typically less than 6 m thick, and occur most commonly associated with 
the conglomerate.  Irregular, thicker sandstone horizons up to 20 m thick also occur in the upper parts of the volcanic 
stratigraphy in the northwestern part of the property.  Locally, sandstone grades into siltstone and shale beds that are 
generally less than 2 m thick. 

Metasedimentary Rocks:  Metasedimentary rocks include muscovite-schist and quartz-muscovite-schist that form the 
basement to the overlying sedimentary and volcanic sequence.  The upper contact of the metasedimentary rocks is 
commonly veined, intruded by subvolcanic dikes and sills, and faulted.  The schist contains two well-developed 
foliations, one of which is folded by the other. 

Subvolcanic Intrusions:  The entire volcanic, sedimentary and metasedimentary sequence is intruded by dikes and 
sills of felsic to intermediate composition.  The subvolcanic intrusions are most abundant along the contacts between 
basement metasedimentary rocks and the overlying conglomerate.  Dike and sill contacts are typically strongly clay 
altered. 

Light to dark colored feldspar porphyry dikes and sills are sparsely porphyritic, but locally have few to moderate feldspar 
phenocrysts and few mafic phenocrysts that are completely converted to pyrite and clays.  Feldspar phenocrysts are 
variably clay altered.  Groundmass is commonly moderately sericitized. 

7.3.3 Alteration 

The principal visible alteration facies observed in the Property consist of: 

 Patchy albite-epidote±chlorite flanks the deposit to the west, north, and southeast, and produces 
strengthening of the rock.  Chlorite, brucite, and epidote are the most common minerals present in this facies. 

 Silica-sericite-pyrite occurs along northwest and east-northeast trending corridors, and does not appear to be 
intense enough to affect rock strength.  Illite and muscovite are the most common minerals in this facies. 

 Pseudomorphic clays and carbonate after phenocrysts occurs throughout all porphyritic lithologies and does 
not define specific trends or affect rock strength. Illite, phengite, and montmorillonite, iron-carbonates, and 
lesser chlorite are the most common in this facies. 

 Pervasive texture destructive silica defining northwest-trends are often defined by zones of breccia. 
 Fault-fill clays are restricted to post-mineral faults.  Montmorillonite is the most common mineral in this facies. 

The most frequently occurring are (in order of decreasing frequency): montmorillonite, illite, phengite, iron carbonate, 
silica, chlorite, brucite, muscovite, kaolinite, calcite, and epidote.  Among the alteration minerals, muscovite is the 
mineral that appears to have best spatial correlation with faults. 

The Deposit lacks a distinct halo of a high illite crystallinity surrounding mineralization.  This lack of an alteration halo 
is interpreted as being due to a combination of the strong lithological control over illite crystallinity, and to the scale of 
this alteration study, which was conducted along the main mineralized zones.  It is possible that a broad zone of illite 
crystallinity high would be defined at a more regional scale. 

7.4 MINERALIZATION 

The area has been cut by numerous structures, both NW and NE oriented (to NNW and NNE), as well as ~E-W; post-
Oligocene extension resulting in graben-style faults, possibly with low-angle listric-type movement.  Subsequent 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128

   61 

mineralization occurred along these low and high-angle faults, and also followed the low-angle contact of the basement 
or conglomerate with the tuff.  The Martha vein, with a dip of ~20° to the SW, defines the unconformity at depth.  The 
shallowly dipping Abundancia vein dips ~50° to the WNW, and the high-angle La Gloria vein, in the west, dips ~75° to 
the WSW.  Internal to this main system of veins, are also areas of veinlets and stockwork, which constitute most of the 
mineralization. 

Mineralization is controlled by three types of structures: 

 Type 1: structures commonly associated with faults and exhibit crustiform, cockade, and colloform textures 
that are representative of multiple vein opening stages.  These veins generally have widths of greater than 30 
centimeters and can form vein systems up to several meters wide.  Cavities are also common in these veins.  
Quartz stockwork comprising millimeter- to centimeter-scale quartz veinlets is common both in the hanging 
wall and footwall of Type 1 vein systems. 

 Type 2: structures consist of veins that range in width from 1 centimeter to several tens of centimeters, and 
rarely include veins up to 6 meters wide (e.g., Abundancia and La Gloria veins).  Type 2 veins are dominated 
by colloform textures with sugary quartz and euhedral crystals projecting into cavities along the vein centers.  
Dilation (or jigsaw) breccia veins are also common, with angular clasts of wall rock (typically fine-grained 
volcaniclastic rock) in quartz and (or) calcite cement.  Colloform textures and crystal growth into cavities are 
characteristics of open-space filling which commonly occurs in extensional settings. 

 Type 3: structures are commonly associated with abundant hematite alteration of the host rock, breccia, minor 
stockwork development, and patchy or narrow quartz vein development.  Type 3 structures are typically fault 
zones up to several meters wide with variably developed quartz-carbonate-calcite veins and fault breccia. 

As previously mentioned, the mineralization in the area occurs in veins, veinlets, and stockwork.  These veins average 
in true width under 15 m (Martha Vein) consist of several stages of banded, crustiform to colloform, quartz (and 
cryptocrystalline quartz at shallow depths), adularia, barite and typically later carbonates (both calcite and 
rhodochrosite); illite commonly replaces the adularia.  There are variable amounts of pyrite, sphalerite and galena plus 
argentite, and variable amounts of tetrahedrite - tennantite, freibergite and Ag sulfosalt. 

7.4.1 Local Mineralization 

The district has many characteristics that are typical of epithermal veins in Mexico, particularly of the Ag-rich variety.  
Quartz veins are accompanied by adularia, barite, calcite, rhodochrosite of variable timing, as well as acanthite, 
freibergite, Ag sulfosalts and minor electrum, plus variable amounts of pyrite, honey-colored sphalerite, 
tennantite/tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite and galena, and supergene Fe and Mn oxides; the hypogene minerals are 
characteristic of intermediate-sulphidation deposits in Mexico.  Mineralization is believed to be Tertiary in age both the 
LVS and UVS are mineralized, but the basalts are recent and not mineralized. 

Petrographic studies of the veins in Deposit, find that multiple stages of silver and base metal mineralization are 
associated with repeated fluid boiling and mixing events, defined by crustiform banded fill/cement assemblages within 
a framework of intermittent and more significant fracturing/rupturing of wall rock and pre-existing vein/cement 
assemblages.  There is a repetition of common hydrothermal fill/cement mineralogy, including ore minerals, such that 
correlation of vein/cement assemblages/events between drillhole intersections would be difficult. 

The occurrence of adularia and style of early quartz and chalcedonic quartz replacement amongst wall rock 
replacement and fracture-fill/cement assemblages confirms silver and base metal mineralization associated with low 
sulphidation, epithermal style systems developed on the Martha and Olin structures at the Project.  Significant widths 
of mineralized quartz and carbonate dominated fracture-fill and breccia cement assemblages have developed as a 
result of extended episodes of hydrothermal fluid flow and repeated rupturing of wall rock and pre-existing vein/cement

assemblages.  Internal crustiform banding within the different voluminous fill/cement assemblages represents 
incremental opening and filling of fractures/cavities between major rupturing events. 

The Martha vein is the largest vein in the deposit by far, with at least 3 times the volume of the next largest vein, La 
Abundancia.  Both veins are low angle, the Martha vein dips ~20-30°, following the SW-dipping contact of volcaniclastic 
rocks overlying an immature conglomeratic unit (consisting mainly of polylithic clast-supported fragmental rock with 
angular to sub-rounded clasts), or the underlying schist. 

There are also high-angle veins in the west on the ridge, such as La Gloria vein, the largest of this set of veins.  These 
high-angle veins can be considered as a mineralized zone or lode of stock work, silicification, breccias, veins, vein 
breccias, veinlets, and a general mix of multiple styles of mineralization.  Within this broader zone, for example the 
Martha lode ranges from 1 m to 35 m thicknesses and averages approximately 5 m. 

7.4.2 Structural Geology 

There are three main types of syn-mineralization veins and faults in the property: 

 Type 1 – Silver-gold bearing, south–southeast– and south–striking, shallow west-dipping structures (e.g., the 
Martha fault zone). 
 These structures are commonly associated with faults and exhibit crustiform, cockade, and colloform 

textures that are representative of multiple vein opening stages.  Veins generally have widths greater 
than 30 cm and can form vein zones up to several meters wide;  

 Steep down-dip (i.e., shallow west-plunging) mineral lineation and associated steps indicate that these 
structures developed as normal faults.  

 Type 2 – Silver–gold bearing, south–southeast– to south-southwest–striking, moderate to sub vertical west-
dipping structures (e.g., the Abundancia and La Gloria veins). 
 These structures contain veins that range in width from 1 cm to several tens of cm, and include rare up 

to 6 meters wide veins. Vein textures comprise colloform banding, dilation (jig-saw) breccia, and euhedral 
crystals projecting into cavities along the vein centers typical of extensional veins.  Few faults are 
associated with these veins, although vein walls are sometimes characterized by smooth and striated 
post-mineralization faults; 

 Type 2 veins developed as extensional veins in the hanging wall and footwall of Type 1 structures.  Rare 
syn-mineralization faults display steep-west plunging mineral lineation and associated steps indicating 
normal dip-slip movement. 

 Type 3 - East–southeast–striking, moderate to steep south-dipping structures (e.g., two ESE structures, La 
Plomosa, and Transversal veins) with sporadic silver-gold bearing quartz veins.  These structures are up to 
several meters wide, consisting of fault zones with variably developed quartz-carbonate-calcite veins and fault 
breccia commonly associated with hematite alteration of the host rock; 

 Dominantly moderate to steeply west-plunging mineral lineation and associated steps along southwest-
dipping veins indicate that these structures developed as normal-dextral oblique-slip faults.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

Silver and gold mineralization in the Project area can be grouped into the low sulphidation epithermal model of precious 
metal deposits.  These types of deposits are found worldwide and have been commonly formed during the Cretaceous 
to Holocene. 

Low sulphidation deposits occur as veins, breccias, and disseminated precious metal mineralization deposited by the 
circulation of neutral to weakly acidic hydrothermal fluids along regional fault structures, fracture zones, or through 
highly permeable lithologies such as ignimbrite and agglomerate.  Because the fluids are relatively neutral, very little 
alteration is evident and the veins and nearby wall rock may commonly include illite, sericite, and adularia.  Generally 
this style of mineralization is distal from a heat source. 

Sillitoe and Hedenquist (2003) subdivide epithermal deposits into High (HS-), Low (LS-) and Intermediate-sulphidation 
(IS) types based on mineralogy, deposit morphology, associated alteration, and geologic setting (Figure 8-1). 

Type IS epithermal deposits occur in a broadly similar spectrum (to HS deposits) of andesitic-dacitic arcs, but commonly 
do not show such a close connection with porphyry Cu deposits as do many of the HS deposits.  However, high silica 
igneous rocks such as rhyolite are related to only a few IS deposits.  IS deposits form from fluids spanning broadly the 
same salinity range as those responsible for the HS type, although Au-Ag, Ag-Au, and base-metal rich Ag-(Au) 
subtypes reveal progressively higher ore-fluid salinities.

a. Calc-alkaline volcanic arc with neutral to mildly extensional stress state showing relationships between high- and intermediate-sulphidation epithermal and 
porphyry deposits (note that the complete spectrum need not be present everywhere).  Early magmatic volatiles are absorbed into ground water within the volcanic 
edifice (shown here as a stratovolcano, but it may also be a dome setting) to produce acidic fluid for lithocap generation, over and/or supra-adjacent to the causative 
intrusion.  Later, less acidic intermediate-sulphidation fluid gives rise to intermediate-sulphidation mineralization, both adjacent to and distal from the advanced 
argillic lithocap.  Where the intermediate-sulphidation fluid flows through the leached lithocap environment, it evolves to a high-sulphidation fluid (Einaudi et al., 
2003) to produce high-sulphidation veins or disseminated mineralization, depending on the nature of the structural and lithologic permeability.  The high-sulphidation 
fluid may evolve back to intermediate-sulphidation stability during late stages, supported by paragenetic relationships and lateral transitions of high- to intermediate-
sulfidation mineralogy.  b. Rift with bimodal volcanism and low-sulphidation deposits.  Deep neutralization of magmatic volatiles, typically reduced, results in a low-
sulphidation fluid for shallow low-sulphidation vein and/or disseminated mineralization and related sinter formation (Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003). 

Figure 8-1: Schematic sections of end-member volcanotectonic settings and associated epithermal and 
related mineralization types.   

The veins in the Project area consist of several stages of banded, crustiform (to colloform; quartz and cryptocrystalline 
quartz at shallow depths, adularia, barite and typically later carbonates both calcite and rhodochrosite, "illitic clay" (illite) 
commonly replaces the adularia (Coote, 2010).  There are variable amounts of pyrite, sphalerite and galena plus 
argentite, and variable amounts of tetrahedrite-tennantite, freibergite and Ag sulfosalts. 

The Ag:Au ratio is high, approximately 500:1 for the resource.  Supergene oxidation extends to at least 300 m depth, 
and includes manganese oxide.  There is abundant adularia, bladed calcite textures and coexisting vapor-rich and 
liquid-rich inclusions, all indicating an ascending, boiling fluid, consistent with the abundant evidence for brecciation, 
which suggests that that mixing caused metal deposition and carbonate formation.

9 EXPLORATION 

9.1 SUMMARY OF PAST EXPLORATION 

Exploration and other work at the Project date back to mining in the late 1800s on the Abundancia and La Gloria veins, 
two prominent veins exposed on the surface of La Preciosa Ridge.  This work, which ceased in the early 1900's, and 
small-scale underground mining in the 1970s, resulted in the production of a small amount of material from these two 
veins, estimated by Mining Plus  (Head and Collins, 2012) to be less than 30,000 tonnes.  This tonnage estimation was 
not validated by Coeur but site inspections support that a small amount of mining was previously done. 

The majority of work at the Project that is material to the mineral resources is from contemporary exploration, mainly 
drilling, conducted by Luismin, Orko, and PAS (Table 9-1).  In addition to the drilling completed by these companies, 
other exploration activities, consisting of: 

1. Prospect sampling by Orko in 2004, followed by geologic mapping by Orko geologists; 

2. Completion of three IP (Induced Polarization) ground geophysical surveys in 2005 that totaled 40 line-km.  
The resistivity data did not appear to be a useful product of this work, but the chargeability component did 
identify an anomaly in the valley between La Preciosa Ridge and Zona Oriente; and 

3. A large geochemical soil sampling program over a grid spanning 5 km north to south and 2 km east to west.  
This program produced anomalous analytical results from areas near shallowly covered veins such as Veta 
Nueva, Orito, and Nancy. 

Historic exploration (along with recognition of late 1800s/early 1900s mining) was responsible for the identification of 
anomalous silver and gold in soils and outcropping veins. 

9.2 COEUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT 

Coeur's 2013-2014 drilling program was divided into three types: 

 Type I drilling: completion of 21 RC drillholes to test and condemn waste dumps and tailings impoundment 
areas, drilling commenced January 2014 and completed February 2014. 

 Type II drilling: infill core drilling between February 2014 and mid-April 2014 completed a 75-hole drilling 
program totaling 11,437m.  Drilling targeted the first three years of the mine plan to convert inferred to 
indicated resources and reduce risk in achieving the early mine plan.  All drilling was concentrated around the 
Abundancia Ridge area. 

 Type III drilling: from December 2013 to March 2014 Major Drilling, under KP supervision, completed seven 
HQ3 core holes specifically to obtain geotechnical data in the area of the design pits, tailings impoundment, 
and process plant footprint.  Subsequently, these holes also were sampled for geochemical data. 

Coeur has completed development and exploration work at the Project in 2013-2014, as shown in Table 9-1.

In the opinion of the QP, Coeur's drilling, sampling, and logging was done to industry standards.  A total of 25.908 
meters of RC samples, or 17 intervals, was logged as NR (no return), which is 0.3% of the total amount of RC drilled 
in 2014 (Table 9-1).  RC drilling was specifically focused on exploring sites for waste rock and tailings facilities.  Core 
recovery is reported as 100 percent, no NR intervals were reported.  Because the 2014 core drilling program was 
designed to infill between existing drillholes, the resulting samples are representative of the mineralization as a whole 
and are not biased in their location, orientation, sampling method, or metal grade.  Since the core drilling infilled the 
area designed to be mined in the first three years of the mine plan, the spatial density of sampling is good, sufficient 
for much of the material to be classified as indicated or measured. 

In the opinion of the QP, the quantity and quality of the lithological, geotechnical, collar and downhole survey data 
collected in the exploration and infill drill programs completed by Coeur, Orko, PAS, and Lusmin are sufficient to support 
Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation as follows: 

 Core logging meets industry standards for gold exploration. 
 Collar surveys have been performed using industry-standard instrumentation. 
 Downhole surveys were performed using industry-standard instrumentation. 
 Recovery data from core drill programs are acceptable. 
 Geotechnical logging of drill core meets industry standards for planned open pit operations. 
 Drill orientations are generally appropriate for the mineralization style, and have been drilled at orientations 

that are optimal for the orientation of mineralization for the bulk of the deposit area. 

Core logging did not reveal any unusual geologic features that have not been observed in previous logging in the 
Project area.  Assay results and location of mineralized intercepts are consistent in spatial location and grade of 
previous drilling in the Project area and no unusally high-grade intercepts or previously unknown mineralized areas 
were encountered, i.e. the distribution of sample grades from the 2014 drill program are similar to distributions of grades 
from previous drill programs.

10 DRILLING 

In early 2014, Coeur planned and drilled 75 HQ diamond drillholes for a total of 11,437m, with an average depth of 
150m, and core recoveries of 85%.  Drilling was done by Layne de Mexico S.A de C.V. 

In addition to infill core drilling, an additional 2,244m of core was drilled for the geotechnical investigation by Major.  
These core holes were logged and on completion of geotechnical work, the core was split, sampled, and assayed; 
however, the assay and geology data were not available in time for use in the resource model. 

All drillholes, with the exception of reverse circulation drillholes for condemnation drilling, are diamond core holes of 
varying diameters, mainly HQ and some NQ diameter drillholes. Exploration and development drilling to delineate 
mineral resources has been performed in sequential campaigns by Luismin, Orko, PAS, and Coeur as summarized in 
Table 10-1 (excludes RC drilling because RC was not used in resource estimation).

10.1 DRILLING BY LUISMIN 

Of the seven Luismin drillholes in the Project database, two were drilled from underground workings and five from the 
surface.  The primary targets were the Abundancia and La Gloria veins, which run semi-parallel to the NNW-striking 
Abundancia Ridge, at depths of 50 to 75 m below the primary underground workings on the 2065m level (elevation).  
Lusmin drilled one additional drillhole 313 m deep in 1994 in the eastern vein breccia system, but data for this drillhole 
are not available.  There are no available details on the Luismin drilling procedures, except that the drill core was either 
small-diameter BQ or AX size.  The remaining half-core from these holes is stored in the original core boxes on site.  

10.2 DRILLING BY ORKO (2005 TO 2008, 2011, 2012) 

Orko began drilling in March 2005, ultimately completing 388 diamond drillholes totaling 152,368 m of core, spaced on 
roughly 100 m centers, with all but 16 of the holes targeting various veins.  Orko used Major for all of its drilling using 
Longyear 44, 38A, and 38B core drills.  Drill core diameters started at HQ-diameter, with reductions to NQ-diameter at 
around 260 m downhole.  Between rod changes the drillers inserted a wooden "run" block in the core boxes marked 
with the downhole depth in both feet and meters.  Downhole surveys were taken approximately every 50 m down the 
hole with a Reflex survey instrument.  The results of these surveys indicated only moderate deviation in downhole 
azimuths and inclinations. 

Drill core was collected on a daily basis from the drill rig by Orko technicians, who taped the boxes shut prior to 
transporting the core to the site core shed.  Once at the shed, technicians cleaned the boxes and core, marked the 
boxes with the hole number, box number, and the depth intervals, and reconciled these data with the depths marked 
on the driller's core run blocks. 

After completion of each hole, a PVC pipe was placed in the hole collar and a concrete cap was poured around the 
collar PVC pipe, and a length of PVC pipe was left protruding above the concrete cap.  The concrete cap was inscribed 
with the drillhole number, total hole depth, and the azimuth and inclination of the hole at the collar.  An independent 
surveyor was contracted to survey the collar coordinates on a regular basis. 

10.3 DRILLING BY PAS 

PAS began drilling in June 2009, under the terms of PAS's Option Agreement to acquire a joint venture interest in the 
Project from Orko, and PAS completed 331 diamond drillholes.  The drilling focused on in-filling the 100 m center grid 
previously completed by Orko.  PAS's drilling resulted in a spacing of 50 m on every other section (100 m apart) over 
an area approximately 800 m × 800 m.  This selective tighter spaced drilling area is located in the northern part of the 
deposit.  Additionally, infill drillholes were drilled on selected sections as well as on two 15- to 20-meter close-spaced 
fences to assess the short-range continuity of geology and mineralization.  Major was also used by PAS to do the 
drilling program, which resulted in similar drilling and downhole surveying procedures as Orko, although greater 
capacity drill rigs were employed which resulted in fewer NQ-diameter drillholes.  Beginning in early 2010, selected 
drillholes were surveyed using a Reflex ACT/QPQ orientation tool to obtain oriented drill core for geotechnical 
purposes.  The drillhole collar monuments and the survey of collar coordinates followed the same procedures 
established earlier by Orko. 

10.4 DRILLING BY COEUR 

Between January and April 2014 Coeur drilled a total of 75 HQ core drill, 21 reverse circulation (RC) holes totaling 
19,980 m, and 7 geotechnical core holes totaling 2,244 m.  A majority of Coeur's drillholes were oriented west to east 
at varying dips, depending on the target vein orientation, to minimize the drillhole intersection angle with the vein.  In 
general, the downhole length of the drill intersection approximates the true thickness of the vein, but this length can 
vary from hole to hole.  Most of the 2013 drillholes were completed in the main deposit area, an area approximately 
3000 m north to south by 2000 m east to west.

RC condemnation drillholes were designed to test potential mineralized targets within the boundaries of waste dumps 
and tailings facilities.  RC drillholes were drilled on -45° to -60°, to -90° inclination with N-NE and SW-W azimuths.  
Infill drillholes were designed to increase the amount of Measured and Inferred material in the first three years of the 
mine plan (an area encompassing Abundancia Ridge).  These drillholes were inclined from -40° to -85°, with azimuths 
from N-NE to SW-W. 

Downhole surveying in core and RC drillholes was done from top to bottom approximately every 10 meters downhole 
using a gyroscope survey instrument.  Results of these surveys indicated only minor deviation in azimuth and 
inclination.  Collars were surveyed with total station instrument using WGS 84 coordinate system. 

Drill core was collected on daily from the drill rig by Coeur technicians, who taped the boxes shut prior to transporting 
the core to the onsite core shed.  In the core shed technicians cleaned the boxes and core, marked the boxes with the 
drillhole number, box sequence number, depth intervals, and checked recorded depths against the depths marked on 
the driller's core run blocks.  Color digital photographs of each core box were taken before the core was split and 
sampled.  Core was then laid out and logged, using paper logging forms, by project geologists, who also marked 
sampling intervals according to Coeur QA/QC sampling protocols.  Briefly sampling criteria requires samples to be 
greater than 50 cm and less than 200 cm in length.  Logging describes all common features, such as rock type, 
alteration, mineralization, faults, etc. 

RC drill sampling was done on 5 foot or 1.5 m intervals.  Samples were collected after passing through a cyclone under 
both wet and dry conditions.  Samples were placed in plastic bags when drilling dry material and in Micropore bags 
when the drilling was wet. 

After completion of each hole, a PVC pipe was placed in the drillhole collar and a cement cap or monument was poured 
around the collar PVC pipe and inscribed with the drillhole number, total drillhole depth, and the azimuth and inclination 
of the hole at the collar.  An independent surveyor was contracted to survey the coordinates of each collar on a regular 
basis. 

10.5 CORE RECOVERY AND ROCK QUALITY DESIGNATION (RQD) 

Only Orko drilling had drillhole core recovery and RQD values recorded in the acQuire database, these types of data 
were not recorded by PAS or Luismin.  Although Coeur recorded core recovery and RQD measurements, at the time 
of this report was written those data had not been entered into the acQuire database, thus no analysis was done. 

Orko's recovery values are reasonable with a mean core recovery of 94.5 percent and a mean RQD of 54.3%.  For 
both silver and gold there is a decrease in Ag and Au grade with increasing core recovery where recovery is >20 
percent, which suggests that there is a small sampling bias with loss of material in higher grade zones.  Grades 
decrease slightly with increasing core recovery, however maximum grades increase with increasing core recovery 
because of the greater number of intervals with better core recovery.  It is important to note that the data are not 
normalized for the number of recovery measurements.  Because the highest Ag and Au grades are typically found in 
quartz veins, and core recovery in quartz veins tends to be lower because the veins are fractured, the grade-recovery 
relationship is expected.  Given the small number of recovery measurements in the range of 0-40 percent recovery, 
and lower maximum grades in the 0-40 percent range, the impact of core recovery on the resource estimate is 
insignificant.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 SAMPLE COLLECTION METHODS 

11.1.1 Luismin (1981, 1982, 1994) 

No documents/reports are available that describe the sampling methods used by Luismin. Based on descriptions 
provided by visual inspection of Luismin core by previous Qualified Persons, the core was split using a conventional 
manual splitter and properly "marked and neatly stored".  Luismin reportedly collected a total of only 130 samples for 
assay, with variable sample lengths that ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 meters.  The breaks between samples reportedly 
respected geologic features. 

11.1.2 Orko (2003-2008, 2011, 2012) 

Orko technicians transported core from the drill rigs on a daily basis to the core logging facility, where it was cleaned 
and the core boxes marked with the hole number, box number and from-to depth intervals.  Each box of core was then 
photographed and moved to a rack for examination by a geologist who logged lithology, structure, alteration, 
mineralization type, intensity and sulfide percentage and oxidation and assigned codes for rock types, structures, and 
veins. Logging was done manually on paper logging forms.  Following geologic logging, geotechnical data including 
core recovery, was recorded.  After logging was complete, the geologist marked the sample intervals on the core and 
on the core box dividers with a permanent marker, along with a cutting line along the longitudinal axis of the core and 
recorded the sample interval depths and corresponding sample numbers on the geological log.  The core was then 
sawn in half along the cut line by an Orko technician using a water-cooled diamond saw, after which one half of the 
interval was placed in a plastic sample bag along with a sample tag. The remaining half was returned to the core boxes 
that then were placed on numbered racks in a large, secure, storage shed at the Project site. 

In order to determine material density, a single piece of the sampled core was removed from each sample sack, allowed 
to air-dry, and then dry weighed for measurement of specific gravity. Once measured, the core piece was returned to 
the appropriate sample bag and the whole sample was placed in a rice sack for transport to the Inspectorate de Mexico 
sample preparation facility in the city of Durango.  Prior to transport, each rice sack was weighed and the total weight 
recorded.  All samples were in the possession of Orko personnel from the diamond drill rigs to the Inspectorate lab. 

11.1.3 PAS (2008-2010) 

PAS followed essentially the same drillhole logging and sampling procedures and protocols developed by Orko, 
beginning with PAS drillhole BP10-458 onwards. The geologists determined the diamond core sample intervals and 
marked the positions of the intervals on both the core and the core box dividers. The core was then cut along the cut 
line marked on the core by the geologists using a water cooled diamond bladed saw, and both halves were placed 
back in the core boxes for transport to the core sampling area.  Sample bags and sample tags were labeled with the 
consecutive sample numbers assigned to the sample intervals, with numbers reserved for insertion of QA/QC samples.  
The pieces of half core to be assayed were then placed in the appropriate labeled sample bags along with the 
corresponding sample tag, and then the bags containing the individual samples were inserted in groups of ten into 
labeled rice sacks along with the labeled standard and blank QA/QC samples. The rice sacks filled with samples were 
stored on site until transported by a PAS employee to the SGS de Mexico laboratory in the city of Durango, Mexico. 

11.1.4 Coeur (2013-2014) 

The Coeur development program consisted of reverse circulation (RC) and core drilling.  The RC drilling program was 
conducted by two drill rigs contracted from Layne de Mexico. One geologist was assigned to each active drilling shift.  
Geologists were provided with a package of sample tags which indicated the sample identification and the interval.  
Sample tags were included inside each sample bag and a permanent marker was used to note the sample identification

and interval on each sample bag.  A geologic description was recorded on a paper log at the drill rig, including any 
additional notes on the drilling or sample.  This log was later transferred to an electronic format.  Coeur's company 
protocol for quality control (Coeur, 2012) was applied throughout the sample collection process. All RC samples were 
collected by Coeur technicians, accompanied by a project geologist.  Samples were collected at 1.5 m intervals in two 
five gallon buckets.  The entire sample was weighed, with typical weights ranging from 100-125 kg.  The sample was 
initially split in half using a single Jones-type splitter with one half of this split bagged for analysis at the commercial 
laboratory.  The remaining sample is split once more, retaining 1/8 of the original sample, and bagged for storage in 
the project warehouse. 

Core was collected at the drill rig and transported to the core logging facility on a daily basis, where it was cleaned and 
the boxes were marked with hole number, box number, and the sample interval.  Each box of core was photographed 
and moved to a rack for examination by a geologist.  After geologic and geotechnical logging were complete, geologists 
then marked sample intervals on the core and on the core box dividers with a permanent marker, along with the cutting 
line along the longitudinal axis of the core.  All sample intervals and corresponding sample numbers were recorded on 
the geologic log.  The core was then sawn in half along the cut line by a Coeur technician using a water cooled diamond 
saw.  One half of the interval was placed in a plastic sample bag along with a sample tag.  The remaining half was 
returned to the core box and placed on numbered racks in a large, secure, storage shed at the project site. 

11.2 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS PROCEDURES 

11.2.1 Luismin (1981, 1982, 1994) 

The drillhole samples collected by Luismin were transported to the company's in-house laboratory in Durango.  No 
written records of the chain of custody, sample preparation, or sample analysis procedures are known to exist. 

11.2.2 Orko (2003-2008, 2011, 2012) 

 Sample Preparation  

Orko used two-sample preparation labs located in the city of Durango – Inspectorate and SGS. For most of 2005 to 
2007, SGS was the primary lab used and Inspectorate served as the secondary lab. After completion of hole BP07-93 
or thereabouts, the primary and secondary lab designations were switched and Inspectorate became the primary lab 
in order to improve assay turn-around times. Upon receipt at both the SGS and Inspectorate sample preparation 
laboratories, the samples were placed in order according to sample number, and then crushed, and a sub-sample split 
was taken for pulverization. The remaining coarse rejects were returned to the project site and stored.  Neither 
preparation lab was ISO nor IEC certified at the time the Project samples were processed. 

 Sample Analysis 

The sample pulps were sent to Inspectorate's analytical laboratory in Reno, Nevada, USA, which was ISO 9001:2008 
certified, and to the SGS analytical laboratory in Toronto, Canada, which was accredited by ISO/IEC 17025. Sample 
pulps representing check assays also were sent to these analytical facilities, as well as to ALS Chemex in North 
Vancouver, Canada and ALS Chemex in Reno, Nevada, USA, each of whom is independent of Coeur.  At the SGS 
analytical laboratory in Toronto, the pulps were analyzed by several methods.  Gold content was determined by fire 
assay at a detection limit of 5 ppb Au. Silver was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), at a calibrated 
detection limit of 0.3 g/t Ag and an upper limit threshold of 300 g/t Ag. Samples with silver values greater than 300 g/t 
Ag based on this analytical method were re-run by fire assay with a gravimetric finish.  All samples also were subjected 
to strong acid digestion followed by a 40 element Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) analyses, including silver.   

Some of the elements in the ICP package have threshold limits for ICP analysis. Examples include silver, which due 
to its 10 g/t upper ICP threshold does not allow the method to be used for this Project because over half of all samples

   74 

exceed this value.  Similarly, the base metals Pb and Zn and the element Ba have an upper threshold of > 10,000 g/t, 
(or 1.0%), which also precludes the use of ICP analysis for these elements.  For the minerals containing any of the 40 
elements that are totally digestible by strong acids, such as oxide, sulfide and carbonate species, the ICP analysis 
method works well.  However, for minerals containing any of these elements that are resistant to the strong acid 
digestion, only partial values will result.   

The laboratory procedures used at the Inspectorate lab in Reno were similar to those used by SGS and described 
above. However, silver was an exception where, due to more precise instrument calibration, the detection limits were 
a lower 0.1 g/t (g/t) Ag and the upper threshold limit was 200 g/t Ag.  As a result, samples having silver contents greater 
than 200 g/t were subsequently re-analyzed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish. 

Orko completed two drillholes in 2011 and three drillholes in 2012 for a total of 500 meters.  Only 29.2 meters of this 
drilling was sampled and assayed, according to the Orko database.  No record of QA/QC procedures and results exists 
for these drill campaigns. 

11.2.3 PAS (2008-2010) 

 Sample Preparation  

With the exception of the pulp duplicate samples, all PAS samples were prepared and assayed by SGS Laboratories 
in Durango, México. Upon arrival at the SGS laboratory, the samples were assembled in numerical order according to 
the sample tag numbers, individually crushed, then riffle split to provide a sub-sample for pulverizing. The pulverized, 
approximately 200 g sub-sample, was placed in a small labeled paper packet. After the required assay aliquots were 
removed, the residual material remaining in the packet was returned to PAS for storage on site at the Project, along 
with the coarse reject that remained after splitting of the assay sub-sample.  

Pulp duplicate samples were analyzed at Inspectorate's lab in Sparks, Nevada. 

 Sample Analysis 

Sample pulps analyzed at the SGS laboratory used the following procedures:  

 For gold analyses at SGS, all samples were initially assayed using fire assay procedures with atomic 
absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish.  The detection limit for this procedure was 0.005 g/t and the maximum 
assay threshold was 10 g/t.  For samples initially assaying more than 10 g/t Au, these were rerun using a fire 
assay with gravimetric finish procedure having a detection limit of 3 g/t Au, 

 For silver analyses at SGS, all samples were initially analyzed using 3-acid digestion with an AAS finish (0.3 
g/t detection limit). For samples with analyses greater than the 300 gram Ag threshold limit, the samples were 
rerun using a fire assay with gravimetric finish procedure having a detection limit of 5 g/t Ag.  In addition, 33-
element trace analyses using a 2-acid digestion and ICP finish having a 2 g/t detection limit and a threshold 
of 10 g/t for silver were completed for all samples, 

 For gold analyses at Inspectorate, all samples were run by fire assay with a gravimetric finish that had a 
detection limit of 3 g/t Au, and 

 Silver analyses for all samples run at Inspectorate were initially run using a 4-acid digestion with ICP finish 
(0.1 g/t Ag detection limit) that had a 200 g/t Ag upper threshold limit. For samples with analyses greater than 
200 g/t, the samples were rerun using fire assay with a gravimetric finish that had a detection limit of 5 g/t and 
an upper threshold limit of 5,000 grams per tonne Au.

11.2.4 Coeur (2013-2014) 

 Sample Preparation 

All Coeur samples in 2013 and 2014 were submitted to an accredited commercial laboratory. Coeur contracted ALS 
Laboratory in Zacatecas, ZAC, MX to complete all sample preparation on RC cuttings and split HQ drill core.  The 
sample is logged in the tracking system, weighed, dried and finely crushed to better than 70% passing a 2 mm screen. 
A riffle split of up to 250 g is taken and pulverized to better than 85% passing a 75 micron screen.  The method is 
appropriate for both RC cuttings and drill core. 

 Sample Analysis 

Sample pulps were created in Zacatecas and sent to ALS's analytical laboratory in Vancouver, BC, CA which is ISO 
9001:2008 certified.  Orko era pulps representing re-assays were sent to ALS Vancouver, as well as to SGS in 
Lakefield, ON, CA which is ISO 17025 certified. Both labs are independent of Coeur. 

11.2.4.2.1 Silver Detection 

At ALS Laboratory, silver content was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-
AES). A 0.25 g sample is digested with perchloric, nitric, hydrofluoric, and hydrochloric acids.  The residue is topped 
up with dilute hydrochloric acid and the resulting solution is analyzed.   The lower and upper detection limits for this 
method are 0.5 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively. At 100 ppm the sample triggers an additional 4-Acid Digestion ICP-
AES analysis that is optimized for accuracy and precision at high metal concentrations.  This method utilizes the same 
acids as the prior method, but includes additional stages of heating and drying, along with the addition of de-ionized 
water to aid in further digestion.  The lower and upper detection limits for this method are 1 ppm and 1500 ppm, 
respectively. 

At SGS Laboratory, silver content was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Absorption Finish.  This is a 
4-Acid digestion.  A 2 g sample is digested with perchloric, nitric, hydrofluoric, and hydrochloric acids. The lower and 
upper detection limits are 0.3 g/t and 300 g/t respectively. 

11.2.4.2.2 Gold Detection 

Gold content was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES), following an 
initial Fire Assay Fusion of a precious metal bead.  The sample bead is digested in 0.5 ml dilute nitric acid in the 
microwave oven.  0.5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid is then added for further digestion.  The lower and upper 
detection limits of this method are 0.001 ppm and 10 ppm, respectively. At 10 ppm the sample triggers an additional 
Gravimetric analysis.  This includes the creation of a lead button containing the 30 g sample, which is then cupelled to 
remove the lead.  The remaining gold and silver bead is parted in dilute nitric acid and weighed as gold. The lower and 
upper detection limits for this method are 0.05 ppm and 1000 ppm, respectively. 

At SGS Laboratory, gold content was determined by exploration grade fire assay. This is a 30 g fire assay with an ICP 
finish.  The lower and upper detection limits are 1 ppb and 10000 ppb, respectively. 

11.2.4.2.3 Multi-Element Detection 

At ALS Laboratory, an additional suite of 40 elements were also analyzed by ICP for all new samples created in 2013 
and 2014.  The drilling also encountered base metal values of zinc and lead which triggered the multi-element over 
limit method.  Table 11-1 lists the elements and associated units, and detection limits.

11.3 SAMPLE SECURITY 

RC samples are collected and bagged at the drill rig by Coeur technicians, accompanied by a project geologist.  The 
bags are labeled with a unique sample ID and the interval meterage.  Core samples were bagged by Coeur technicians 
at the project logging and storage facility.  Samples were delivered daily by Coeur technicians and a project geologist 
to the ALS laboratory in Zacatecas, ZAC, MX.  Sample prep was completed Zacatecas and pulps samples were 
shipped to ALS Vancouver, BC, CA for analytical test work. 

Chain of custody for delivery is established by transmittal sheets and sample receipt documents from the lab.  Final 
chain of custody is ensured through electronic delivery of work orders and PDF assay certificates. 

Hard copies of assay certificates and the geologic logs are stored at the project office in Durango, MX.  The geologic 
logs include the sample sequence list, including inserted QAQC.  Electronic copiers of all data are stored on a corporate 
server in Chicago.  This server is backed up regularly.  Ultimately all data are stored in an acQuire database located 
on an independent, backed-up server.

11.4.2 Data Delivery and Storage 

Following the completion of analyses at the commercial laboratory, electronic results are delivered via email to a 
distribution list of Coeur recipients, approved by the project manager.  ALS also provides secure online access to 
review the status of work orders and offers the ability to download data files and certificates. 

Data are loaded into the acQuire database by a database manager or geologist with sufficient acQuire permissions.  
AcQuire is designed to securely store all original data.  Acquire uses calculated and derived fields to produce data in 
a consistent format that can be uploaded into a 3D modeling package which allows for a further visual review of the 
data. 

11.5 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC), CHECK SAMPLES, AND CHECK ASSAYS 

11.5.1 Luismin QA/QC (1981, 1982, 1994) 

There are no records of any QA/QC programs or protocols prior to 2003. 

11.5.2 Orko QA/QC (2003-2008, 2011, 2012) 

 Orko QA/QC Procedures 

Orko maintained a QA/QC program during its tenure that consisted primarily of inserting standards and blanks into the 
sample sequence.  Although no duplicates were included in the regularly submitted sample batches, duplicates (check 
samples) were submitted to a secondary laboratory in separate batches to check for systematic bias by the primary 
assay laboratory.  



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128

According to earlier Technical Reports (MDA, 2009, Snowden 2011a, Mining Plus 2012), alternating standards and 
blanks were inserted every tenth sample in the sample sequence, equivalent to a 5% insertion rate for each sample 
type.  Mining Plus noted that based on the 88,235 core samples submitted by Orko to the primary laboratories, a 5% 
insertion rate is roughly equivalent to 4,400 blanks and an equal number of standards.  However, Mining Plus stated 
that in the QA/QC files in the database provided for its mineral resource estimate, there were data for a slightly smaller 
number of standards (3,994 standards, 4.3% of the total samples), but a significantly lesser number of blanks (1,127 
blanks, or 1.3% of the total samples) and 1,103 duplicates.  Similar quantities of Orko QA/QC data were reported by 
MDA and Snowden.  The data verification process performed by the Qualified Persons responsible for this Report also 
detected a shortfall in the amount of expected QA/QC data, which is discussed in the following Section 12 of this 
Technical Report. 

Mining Plus and Snowden stated in their Technical Reports that Orko's blank samples consisted of a combination of 
basalt core drilled during its exploration program and material collected from basalt boulders found on the property. 
The basalt blanks reportedly used were designated as Orko-2, Orko-4, Orko-5, Orko-7, and Orko-9.  MDA noted in its 
Technical Report that SGS provided certificates for the basalt blanks based on approximately 150 analyses by aqua 
regia digestion and ICP-AES finish, but that no round-robin multi-laboratory analyses were done to substantiate the 
SGS values for the blanks. 

Early on in Orko's exploration program, two commercial standards were used in a small number of sample batches, 
one of which was certified for gold and silver, and the other for gold only. The accepted values for these standards are 
unknown.  For most of Orko's tenure, custom standards were used that were prepared from a stockpile of mineralized 
material situated near the Luismin portal.  An unspecified amount of this material was sent to SGS's metallurgical 
division for certification prior to preparation of the standards. MDA reported that this certification was based on 
approximately 150 analyses. As with the SGS-certified basalt blanks, MDA noted that values established for the 
standards were not supported by round-robin testing at multiple labs.  Over the course of Orko's exploration activities, 
four such custom standards were compiled, numbered as follows with accepted values in parenthesis: Orko-1 (0.210 
g/t Au, 293.40 g/t Ag), Orko-3 (0.068 g/t Au, 112.00 g/t Ag), Orko-6 (0.072 g/t Au, 146.10 g/t Ag), and Orko-8 (0.134 
g/t Au, 237.90 g/t Ag). In addition to these standards, in accordance with recommendations by MDA, a fifth standard 
was compiled that was subjected to round-robin multi-lab analyses.  This standard, Orko-10, did not have a final 
certified value at the time MDA issued its Technical Report (results from one of the five round-robin labs had not been 
received).  This standard subsequently saw limited use by PAS, and is discussed in Section 11.3.3.1 of this Technical 
Report. 

 Orko QA/QC Results 

The results of Orko's QA/QC results are not easily interpreted. The standards were problematic because they were not 
certified, and record keeping was reported to have been inadequate such that the identity of the standards in the 
sample batches and assay certificates was not always certain (MDA, 2009).  The standard deviation of some of the 
standards was unusually high, particularly silver for Orko-1 and gold for all standards. The relative closeness of the 
accepted silver values for the high grade standards (Orko-1: 293.40 g/t Ag, and (Orko-8: 237.90 g/t Ag) and the 
moderate grade standards (Orko-3: 112.00 g/t Ag and Orko-6: 146.10 g/t Ag) result in overlapping of the two-standard 
deviation ranges for the standard pairs, making it unclear whether some observed "failures" falling outside of these 
ranges were due to inconsistencies in the standards themselves, mislabeling of the standards during sample 
submission (as noted by MDA), or actual errors in the assay analyses. Snowden's graphical plots of the standard 
results suggest that there may have been some switching of standard labels for standards Orko–3 and Orko-8. 

MDA (whose personnel were the only independent Qualified Persons involved one-on-one with Orko personnel during 
exploration drilling) reported that although Orko examined the standard sample assay results on a batch-by-batch 
basis, these results were not systematically charted over time, and as a consequence analytical failures were not 
investigated in a timely manner. This was compounded by the uncertainty as to the identities of some standards (as 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128

described above), which made the identification of actual failures all the more difficult. As a result, trends in the results 
of standards during drilling were not identified. Also, in a number of cases the standards were analyzed by an analytical 
method that differed from the method used to analyze certain drill core samples in a batch. This occurred at the 
Inspectorate lab, where all initial silver assays that fell below 200 g/t Ag were analyzed using an ICP method (which 
occurred for two out of the four standards), whereas those samples with initial ICP assays greater than 200 g/t Ag were 
analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric finish.  However, after reviewing the results of the Orko standards analyses, 
MDA concluded that the data neither revealed any systematic analytical biases, nor did it provided assurance that no 
such problems existed. 

Four percent of the samples representing the Orko-2 blank and 10% of the basalt drill core samples exceeded the 
allowable value for silver, while the basalt drill core samples experienced no failures for gold. However, due to the lack 
of true round-robin certification of the blanks, in Snowden's opinion the blank samples could not be considered to 
actually be void of mineralization, making it impossible to determine whether blank sample failures were a result of 
contamination or background silver grade.  Thus, Snowden judged the blanks to be unreliable for determining whether 
contamination was an issue in the sample preparation and analytical laboratories. However, Snowden did recognize 
an important point – if the blank failures were totally due to contamination, their magnitude did not indicate "significant 
concern with sample contamination". 

A discussion of Orko's QA/QC duplicate samples can be found in Section 12 of this Technical Report. 

Orko completed two drillholes in 2011 and three drillholes in 2012 for a total of 500 meters.  Only 29.2 meters of this 
drilling was sampled and assayed, according to the Orko database.  Therefore no record of QA/QC procedures and 
results exists for these drill campaigns. 

11.5.3 PAS QA/QC (2008-2010) 

The descriptions and discussions of results presented in this section rely on those provided by Snowden in its 2011 
Technical Report prepared for Orko and PAS (Snowden, 2011a). 

 PAS QA/QC Procedures  

Relative to the Orko QA/QC program, the PAS QA/QC procedures provided for a much more systematic insertion of 
blanks, standards, and pulp duplicates into the batches of drill core samples.  PAS batches consisted of 50 samples 
submitted to the SGS laboratory, within which sample numbers ending with 10 or 60 were silver standards, sample 
numbers ending in 30 or 80 were gold standards, and sample numbers ending in 20, 40, 70, or 90 were blanks.  
Duplicate samples were collected by the laboratory by taking a pulp duplicate split of every sample represented by 
sample numbers in the sequence ending with 49 or 99, and these pulp duplicates were subsequently assigned the 
next sample numbers (ending in 50 and 00, respectively), which had been reserved in the sample numbering sequence 
by the geologists.  These duplicates were subsequently submitted in separate batches of pulps to an umpire 
(secondary) laboratory.  

The blank samples used by PAS consisted of half-core basalt.  A total of 652 blank samples were inserted as described 
in the previous paragraph, resulting in a 4% insertion rate. A total of 662 standards were inserted as described, resulting 
in a similar 4% insertion rate. PAS used three different standards summarized as follows, with expected values shown 
in parenthesis - Orko-10 (145.47 g/t Ag, 0.057 g/t Au), GBM908-13 (151.4 g/t Ag), and G308-7 (0.27 g/t Au).  Standards 
GBM908-13 and G308-7 were commercial standards purchased from Geostats Pty. Ltd. Standard GBM908-13 was a 
base metal standard that was also certified for silver and sulfur, while standard G308-7 was certified for gold only. 
Standard Orko-10 was the custom standard described earlier in this Report.  Snowden confirmed that Standard Orko-
10 was prepared by SGS in Durango from material obtained from stockpiles at the Project site, and noted that although 
this standard was round-robin tested in five independent laboratories from which expected values for gold and silver 
were derived, it was never officially certified. A total of only 21 samples from this standard were inserted in sample

FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT

   80 

batches, all of which were from drillholes BP09-355 to BP09-364. PAS commissioned SGS Peru to evaluate the Orko-
10 standard material, and SGS Peru concluded that this standard had unacceptably high variances, probably due to 
the presence of native silver in the sample. As a result, PAS discontinued its use of standard Orko-10 beginning with 
hole BP09-365 and thereafter. 

Snowden reported that PAS geologists regularly monitored the performance of standard and blank assays received 
from SGS by plotting values on line graphs in Excel as soon as each batch of assays was reported by the laboratory. 
Whenever any of the standard results exceeded three standard deviations from the expected value, the entire batch of 
assays was re-submitted for analysis. 

 PAS QA/QC Results 

Snowden reported failures for only two gold standards and five silver standards which represent failure rates of 0.3% 
for gold, and 0.8% for silver. These results indicate that laboratory contamination was not a material concern for the 
samples from the PAS drilling campaigns.   

The results for both silver and gold from certified commercial standards GBM908-13 and G308-7 displayed a bias on 
the high side of the expected values. Although the results for GBM908-13 fell within acceptable limits, a consistent high 
bias relative to the expected mean was present. Results for standard G308-7 displayed a very slight bias towards the 
under-reporting of the gold grades.  However, all results were within two standard deviations of the certified expected 
values, indicating acceptable levels of laboratory accuracy. 

11.5.4 Coeur QA/QC Program (2013-2014) 

Coeur maintained a QA/QC program that was structured on guidelines set forth in the written company QA/QC policy.  
QA/QC consisted of routine insertion of standards, blanks and duplicates into the primary sample stream for both RC 
and core samples.  Umpire check assays have been commissioned in 2014. Table 11-3 defines the suggested Test % 
for QA/QC sample insertion based upon the total count of primary samples.

 Certified Standards and Blanks 

The 2013 and 2014 assay campaigns utilized five certified commercial standards and one round robin tested standard.  
The campaigns used one certified blank and one round robin tested blank. The certified standards were purchased 
from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd., in Langley, B.C., Canada and SGS de Mexico, in Durango, Mexico.  The blank 
was purchased from Rocklabs, in Auckland, New Zealand. Table 11-4 lists the standards and blank and their certified 
silver and gold values.

QA/QC comparison analyses are completed in the acQuire database using separate tools for blanks, standards, and 
duplicates.  Performance of the standards was tracked over time and against lower and upper cut-off limits.  Run plots 
were generated, with multiple user controlled options.  Plots generated for this report include the assay value plotted 
against the certificate number, which depicts the standard's performance over time. The plots also contain error lines 
indicating the acceptable minimum and maximum values for the given standard and assay method.  Coeur policy 
recognizes QA/QC failures as ± 3 standard deviations for standards and ± 5 times the lower detection of the assay 
method for blanks. 

When a blank or standard fails QA/QC it is moved to a "rejected" status in acQuire, along with all primary, duplicate, 
and lab QA/QC samples above and below the failure, and up to the next or previous passing blank or standard.  This 
partial batch of samples must be re-run at the original laboratory, and with the same analysis method as the failed 
method. In the case of the Project, the QA/QC focuses on silver and gold, although the primary analysis includes multi-
element ICP.  Coeur does not re-run the multi-element ICP on failed sample batches.  If the blank or standard fails a 
second re-assay the entire batch must be analyzed a third time at a second commercial laboratory, using an analysis 
method similar to that of the original test work. 

 Coeur QA/QC Results 

11.5.4.2.1 Blanks and Standards 

In 2013-2014, Coeur submitted 21,991 primary samples for assay at two commercial laboratories.  1,018 blanks and 
1,369 standards where inserted into the sample streams, representing insertion rates of 4.63% and 6.23%, 
respectively. The combined insertion rates exceed the total of 10% standards and blanks suggested by Coeur protocol 
and included in Table 11-3.  All standards and blanks were analyzed at ALS in Vancouver, BC, CA and/or SGS in 
Lakefield, ON, CA.  Table 11-5 is an actual example of a QA/QC report exported directly from the acQuire database.  
The report tables the statistical performance of all standards and blanks, defined the assaying laboratory and by the 
analytical method utilized.  The column # Outside Limit   is the count of failed standard or blanks.

The manual insertion of standards and blanks includes an inherent risk for mislabeled or incorrectly inserted samples.  
Original standards and blanks failed QA/QC and the sample batches were reassayed.  Further review was conducted 
on the failed standards and blanks by Coeur and Amec.  The result of the review identified 189 standards and seven 
blanks that were likely assigned an incorrect standard ID or blank ID.  These samples were reclassified based on the 
original assay results which produced silver and gold values that were associated with another active project standard 
or blank.   The result of the reclassification was the approval of the Round 1 QA/QC for these samples. 

Further review of the results of standard Orko-10 indicated a resulting bias to the overall QA/QC performance.  The 
PEA indicated that the use of Orko-10 had been discontinued by PAS after a reevaluation of the standard resulted in 
unacceptably high variances (M3, 2013).  The Orko-10 standard was inserted 143 times into the 2013-2014 campaign.  
The decision to use the standard was the result of recent performance indicating low standard deviations, based on 
161 sample results; and its immediate availability to the Project.  The standard failed 38 silver analyses, a 26.6% failure 
rate. The run plots in Figure 11-1 illustrates that the standard performed consistently when analyzed by Ag_OG62_ppm, 
by failing both above and below the standard limits, with locally larger magnitude failures above the maximum 
acceptable limit.  In order to quantify these findings, Table 11-6 and Table 11-7 contain values in parentheses that 
indicate QA/QC results which exclude the entire Orko-10 sample set.  Coeur has moved to discontinue the used of 
standard Orko-10, and dispose of any remaining sample material.

All QA/QC samples that have not successfully passed Coeur's QA/QC procedures remain in a "rejected" status in the 
acQuire database.  Additionally all primary samples associated with these failed control samples remain in a "rejected" 
status and are unavailable for use in the resource evaluation.  When a control sample passes QA/QC, the new primary 
assay value of the associated primary samples will be moved to an "accepted" status in the acQuire database. 

11.5.4.2.2 Duplicates 

In 2013-2014 Coeur submitted 15,107 new primary samples to ALS Global.  These samples are subjected to the 
company duplicate QA/QC protocol, included in Table 11-3.  The protocol suggests an equal distribution of duplicate 
samples at various check stages.  These include the sample (S), prep (C), and analytical (P) stages.  Coeur submitted 
1,347 duplicates resulting in an insertion rate of 8.92% which exceeded the total suggested insertion rate of 7.5%.  
Check stage totals and resulting failures are included in Table 11-8.  The Threshold is a dynamic value that eliminates 
sample pairs from the population based on their assay value's proximity to the lower detection level of the method 
used.  For this exercise the Threshold is equal to 10 times the lower detection of the method.  Any primary sample with 
an assay value less than this is considered below the Threshold and is removed from the analysis.  Failed duplicates 
will be reassayed in 2014 with the primary sample and all associated duplicates per Coeur QA/QC protocol.

11.5.4.2.3 Umpire Assays 

Umpire assays for the 2013-2014 sample campaigns are currently in progress.  Per Coeur policy, a random selection 
of pulps chosen throughout the range of grades should be selected from each assay certificate from the primary lab 
and sent to another laboratory for check analysis; using the same analytical digestion method and instrumental finish. 

11.5.5 Opinions and Recommendations of the Qualified Person 

In the opinion of the QP responsible for this section of this Report, the sample collection procedures, sample 
preparation, sample analysis procedures, and chain of custody procedures were adequate and acceptable for 
operators before Coeur. The QP acknowledges the issues related to the Orko blanks and standards, but in the QP's 
opinion these do not constitute a material issue.  The QP does note that the insertion rates for blanks and to a lesser 
degree for standards was below the 5% of total samples rate that is generally accepted in North American and 
Australasian jurisdictions.  However, based on the very low number of blank failures, in the opinion of the QP this is 
not a material issue. 

The QP acknowledges that Coeur was successful in addressing the following recommendations presented in the PEA.   

 The deficiency in standard insertion rates exists in pre-Coeur campaigns.  The 2013-2014 Coeur campaign 
met or exceeded the generally accepted 5% insertion rate.  

 A new set of commercial standards and blanks were purchased, addressing the criteria of the necessary 
variable grades. 

The QP acknowledges Coeur has achieved insertion rates for quality control samples consistent with Coeur and 
industry requirements.  The QP acknowledges that Coeur has completed or is in the process of completing QAQC 
procedures on all assay campaigns, with methods consistent with those defined in company protocol.  These include 
accepting and rejecting assays based on standard and blank performance, reassaying of failed sample batches, and 
the completion of umpire lab check analyses.  The QP does note that conditions were identified with quality control

samples that initially affected the integrity of the assay results, and also that these conditions have been addressed 
and corrected.    The following are recommendations for work to be completed by Coeur. 

 Continue and complete the QA/QC review of Orko-era SGS assay data.  This includes identification of 
unknown standards and blanks; and identification of missing samples located only on laboratory data files. 

 Complete and finalize the standard, blank, and duplicate QA/QC review for 2013-2014 drill data.  This includes 
the secondary and tertiary rounds for failed standards and blanks; and their associated sample batches. 

 Complete a Coeur compliant check assay campaign for the 2013-2014 Coeur development and exploration 
sampling campaigns at an accredited umpire laboratory. (Initiated July 2014)

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

The Project drillhole database has been validated by the Coeur technical services group.  It has been verified and 
deemed appropriate for resource modeling.  A review and validation of the 2013-2014 assay, collar coordinate, 
downhole survey, and assay data has been performed by Coeur. 

The historic drillhole database has been verified by Orko (pre-2009), MDA (2009), PAS (2008-2010), Snowden (2011), 
Mining Plus (2012), and IMC (2013).  The following section 12.1 is taken from the PEA compiled by M3. 

12.1 HISTORIC DATA VERIFICATION PROCEDURES 

12.1.1 Orko – Pre-2009 

Prior to 2009, Orko reportedly sent 331 duplicate sample pulps from five of its drillholes to ALS Global (formerly ALS 
Chemex) in North Vancouver, B.C., Canada, as a check against Inspectorate's primary assay results for these holes.  
Although the analytical methods used by ALS Global (ALS) for silver for some of the check samples reportedly differed 
slightly from those methods used by Inspectorate, the results for these check samples indicated a only slight high bias 
on the part of Inspectorate for silver grades less than 30 g/t Ag, and a corresponding very slight high bias across the 
board for Inspectorate gold assays, as determined using fire assay with gravimetric finish methods. The QP responsible 
for this section of the Report reviewed scatterplots of 317 of these 331 gold and silver check analyses provided in 
earlier Technical Reports (which did not provide reasons for the 14 check assays missing from scatterplot 
comparisons).  Based on these reviews, in the opinion of the QP, these check assay data fall within acceptable limits 
(M3, 2013). 

In addition to the 331 duplicate samples, Orko submitted coarse rejects to SGS for 134 samples from drillhole BP07-
102 that were originally prepared and assayed by Inspectorate.  SGS in turn prepared pulp duplicates for these samples 
that were subsequently submitted to ALS.  Mining Plus, consultants to Orko and the Qualified Persons for the 
November 5, 2012 Technical Report on the Project, created Q-Q plots of assays for 120 of the 134 samples from the 
three labs that were available in the Mining Plus database.  These plots indicated reasonable correlation with no biases 
between Inspectorate and SGS for gold or silver.  The Q-Q plots for Inspectorate versus ALS showed similar 
correlations, but with an apparent slight high bias for silver in the Inspectorate assays.  In the opinion of the QP 
responsible for this section of the Report, these comparisons are acceptable for both gold and silver between all three 
laboratories (M3, 2013). 

12.1.2 Mine Development Associates (MDA) – 2009 

As a follow-up to the pre-2009 check assay programs conducted by Orko, Mine Development Associates (MDA) in 
2009 conducted a comprehensive check assay program that included pulp and coarse reject samples reportedly 
representing each of the mineralized vein intercepts.  Submitted by MDA to ALS Chemex in Reno, Nevada, these 
checks samples consisted of 240 pulp rejects, of which 61 original pulps were assayed by SGS and 179 original pulps, 
which were assayed by Inspectorate.   Q-Q plots of the results revealed acceptable correlation between the two primary 
laboratories (SGS and Inspectorate) and the secondary laboratory (ALS), with no indication of biases.  In conjunction 
with this check assay effort, MDA inserted QA/QC blanks and gold and silver standard samples into the check assay 
batches at select but unequal intervals.  The QA/QC results for the blank samples indicated no failures for silver and 
two failures (out of 10) for gold. All standard assays fell within the acceptable ranges (M3, 2013). 

For determination of material density, Orko had routinely conducted one density measurement from each sample sent 
for assay, using a single piece of half-core removed from each sample and a water immersion method that resulted in 
a set of recorded densities that exceeded 88,000 in number.  After each density analysis, the samples used were 
returned to the appropriate sample sacks for shipment to the laboratory for assay.  Concerned that Orko's density 
determinations were possibly biased high because the method used did not account for the presence of vugs in the 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
   90 

vein samples, MDA had Orko complete an additional 92 density determinations using a dry analysis technique on 
whole core representing the Martha vein and other lesser veins from the deposit.  In the opinion of the Qualified Persons 
responsible for this section of the Technical Report, this density validation testing generated specific gravity values that 
are not significantly different than the average specific gravities obtained by Orko's analyses (M3, 2013). 

12.1.3 PAS – 2008-2010 

The Snowden (September 2011) and Mining Plus (November 2012) Technical Reports both make reference to a suite 
of pulp duplicate samples representing the Martha vein from both earlier Orko and PAS drillholes.  According to the 
Snowden Technical Report, "To eliminate any concerns about the quality of Orko data, PAS undertook a specific testing 
program of original data by reassaying drillhole samples and by comparing recent PAS drillhole sample grades with 
earlier Orko sample grades, which also showed grade biases".  The Snowden Technical Report further states in Table 
11.3 that the duplicate samples, which totaled 146 in number, were submitted "because of problems in correlating 
mineralization over short distances between Orko and Pan American holes". The Mining Plus Technical Report added 
that of the 146 duplicate pulps, 43 of the pulps were originally assayed by Inspectorate, while 103 were originally 
assayed by SGS.  The duplicate assays for all 146 pulps were generated by SGS.  However, neither report provides 
any details of the results of comparisons between the duplicate sample pairs (M3, 2013). 

To follow up on MDA's validations of material density, PAS applied four different testing methods to the same individual 
rock samples removed from 252 different sample intervals in the remaining half core.  These included 133 samples 
from veins and adjacent silicified material and 119 samples from un-silicified andesite, the most common host rock to 
the Project mineralization.  The selection of each of the 252 samples considered the variable degree of oxidation in the 
deposit by taking approximately 40 samples of vein/silicified material and approximately 40 samples of andesite from 
shallow (highly oxidized), middle (moderately oxidized), and deep (weakly oxidized to unoxidized) portions of the 
deposit. One of the four measurement techniques employed included data for determination of a "void index" that could 
be used to derive bulk density. The selected samples (most of which were previously measured for specific gravity by 
Orko) weighed between 400 grams and 600 grams in order to reduce measurement error. Prior to testing, each sample 
was geologically described.  The resulting specific gravity measurements reportedly were made by a technician in the 
metallurgical laboratory at PAS's La Colorado mine operations in Zacatecas, Mexico. The results of these 
measurements indicated that the Orko specific gravity data were suitable for use in Mineral Resource estimation, 
provided that a bulk density conversion factor of 0.99 was applied to the average specific gravity for each of the material 
types (vein, vein silicification, and various host rocks).  In the opinion of the QP responsible for this section of the 
Report, this fine tuning of the measured specific gravities for the various material types is acceptable, but not material 
to estimation of Mineral Resources in the Project deposit (M3, 2013). 

12.1.4 Snowden – 2011 

The Snowden Technical Report (Snowden 2011a; 2011b) does not mention the collection by Snowden of any 
independent drill core samples or existing coarse reject or pulp duplicates for check assay.  Snowden reportedly 
reviewed original assay certificates from the SGS laboratory in Durango, México and from Inspectorate's laboratory in 
Sparks, Nevada, which included 441 assays from PAS's drilling and 3,188 assays from Orko drillholes.  In total, 44 
errors were noted in the PAS database assay files (an error rate of 1.4%), 41 of which were determined to be related 
to a single assay batch that apparently was subsequently reassayed. Two of the three remaining errors reportedly 
involved the entry of incorrect assay detection limits. Nine errors were noted in the Orko assay database, seven of 
which were reportedly due to cases where the average values of acceptable duplicate assay pairs were entered rather 
than the primary sample assays. 

Snowden did not perform or recommend additional material density (specific gravity) testing (M3, 2013).

12.1.5 Mining Plus – 2012 

Mining Plus independently collected 74 samples consisting of 23 samples of half (sawn) core and 46 existing coarse 
rejects.  Although the Mining Plus Technical Report states that, "All results from this program returned values well 
within acceptable limits", no actual data for the duplicate sample analyses were provided.  Mining Plus also reportedly 
compared the results of 3,285 assays representing the major zones of mineralization reported on laboratory certificates 
with entries in the assay database and found six errors (an error rate of only 0.2%), and concluded that none of these 
errors were materially significant with respect to mineral resource estimation (M3, 2013). 

Mining Plus checked collar coordinates for 17 drillholes using a hand-held GPS unit and noted no significant 
discrepancies (taking into account the accuracy of the GPS unit) with the values in the project database.  Downhole 
survey data also were reviewed by Mining Plus, which found errors believed to have been caused either by inaccurate 
data transcription or by errors in the actual survey measurements. Where original data could be located, these 
downhole survey data were verified or corrected.  Mining Plus also noted variances between drillhole azimuths and 
inclinations at the drillhole collars and the initial downhole survey data points.  In Mining Plus's view, the reason for 
these discrepancies probably was due to the drill set-ups not corresponding to the planned azimuths and inclinations.  
To address these differences, Mining Plus reported that hole collar markers were removed and new collar 
measurements made of drillhole azimuths and inclinations, except where prevented by deterioration of the drillhole 
collars due to caving and/or the presence of the magnetic basalts on the eastern portion of the project drill pattern.   
Also, Mining Plus reported removing the downhole survey data for several drillholes for which it determined that the 
trace of these holes as defined by the downhole surveys was physically impossible.  In summary, outside of the errors 
described above, Mining Plus noted that with the collection of downhole survey data on 50 m intervals, the potential 
impact of individual survey errors is limited. 

Mining Plus did not perform or recommend additional material density (specific gravity) testing (M3, 2013). 

12.1.6 IMC – 2013 

Only five additional drillholes that were not included in the Mining Plus Mineral Resource estimate were considered for 
inclusion in the IMC Mineral Resource Estimate summarized in Section 14, (holes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and only one of 
these has assay data (BP12-718).  In the opinion of the QPs responsible for this Report no additional independent 
validations of these data were warranted.  This opinion is based on the lack of any significant amount of additional data 
that post-dates the Mining Plus study and Technical Report, and in light of the documented acceptable agreement 
between duplicate sampling and assaying exercises and material density validations conducted by previous Qualified 
Persons (M3, MDA, Snowden and Mining Plus). 

The QA/QC information that has been described in this section was loaded into the IMC system and analyzed to confirm 
previous work.   

In summary, the primary basis for confirmation of the drillhole database are the inserted standards that have been 
completed during the assay programs.  There were also a number of inserted blank samples.  As described earlier, 
there are a total of 1,103 duplicate assays in the QA/QC database.  These are a mixture of: 

Duplicate Pulps to the same lab:      43 samples 
 Check Pulps to a second lab: 793 samples 
 Coarse Rejects to the same lab: 192 samples 
 Coarse Rejects to a second lab:   75 samples 

The analysis by previous Qualified Persons and IMC do not indicate any particular issues with bias in the above data 
sets.  However, none of the above programs are sufficiently consistent in procedure, data distribution, or purpose to 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
   92 

be considered as a major component of the QA/QC data.  The above duplicate samples represent 1.1% of the total 
assay database.   

The reliability of the entire drill program is therefore relying on the inserted standards and blank samples. 

 Standards: 

There are 4,580 standards inserted into 104,720 assays (4.4%) of which 547 standards were inserted into the 
12,955 assays above 25 g/t (4.2%).  

 Blanks: 

There are 1,765 blanks out of 104,720 assays (1.7%) of which 348 blanks were inserted into the 12,955 
assays above 25 g/t (2.7%). 

Blanks were not inserted on a regular basis, although it appears that blanks were likely inserted after high-grade 
intercepts on a visual judgment basis rather than on a consistent insertion basis. 

Standards were generally inserted throughout the database.  The percentage inclusion is similar in both mineralized 
material and waste components of the deposit.  IMC prepared maps and sections of the holes that contain standards 
and found them to cover the area of the mineral resource on a relatively consistent basis. 

Analysis of tested standards versus the published Standard Value in the Mining Plus Report (MP Report) dated 5 
November 2012 do not show any immediate issues regarding assay lab bias, regardless of the lab used for the primary 
assay.  There are some confusing data points in the QA/QC database that present different certified values for some 
standards compared to the MP Report.  IMC has chosen to use the certified values as published in the MP Report. 

The statistical analysis of the QA/QC database indicates that the project database can be accepted for estimation of 
mineral resources, based almost entirely on the reliable results from inserted standards.  However, the QA/QC 
database in general does not meet industry "best practices" in the opinion of IMC. 

12.2 VALIDATION OF COEUR DRILL DATA 

12.2.1 Assay Data Validation 

Assay data are imported into an acQuire database using assay import object.  The commercial laboratories provide 
assay data in a pre-constructed CSV template that imports seamlessly into the acQuire database, when no errors are 
present.  AcQuire imports adhere to very strict rules relating to sample ID's, assay data, and lab job numbers.  When 
these rules are violated, an error report is generated.  There is no manual data entry related to the assay import 
process.  In addition, continuous comparison of the database values against the original PDF certificates is a valuable 
check on the database integrity.  These checks should be conducted on an annual basis. 

12.2.2 Geologic Data Validation 

In 2014 Coeur initiated and completed a comprehensive review and data entry campaign for all drillhole geologic logs 
from Orko, PAS, and Coeur.  The review included 843 drillholes for a total of 259,919 meters.  The Project was 
contracted to HRC and included review and data entry of hardcopy and scanned geologic drill logs.  HRC inspected 
four database tables; lithology, alteration, mineralization, and structure.  A list of accepted logging codes was provided 
by Coeur with edits applied as needed as the Project proceeded.  HRC supplemented the data process with an internal 
validation process that reviewed the logs for legibility, completeness, and consistency with regards to geologic 
interpretation.  Select drillholes were reviewed in 3D to identify potential error in interpretation. Mechanical audits were 
completed to identify overlapping intervals, gaps in geology, and inconsistencies in drill depths.

12.2.3 Collar Survey Checks 

Drillhole collars are checked visually in MineSight and on topographic based maps to confirm that holes are on the 
correct drill pads and map coordinates. 

12.2.4 Downhole Survey Checks 

Downhole survey data are imported into an acQuire database using an import object.  The 2013-2104 downhole 
surveys were completed by IDS Mexico.  IDS provided CSV data files that, in most cases, imported seamlessly into 
acQuire.  On several occasions the CSV file was constructed from a different template, and additional manual 
formatting was required and completed by the geologic database manager.  On import, the data are checked for 
overlapping intervals and intervals below the recorded length of the drillhole. 

12.3 COEUR ONGOING VALIDATION OF HISTORICAL DRILLHOLE DATA 

Coeur continued to verify Orko era data in 2013 and 2014.  A 2013 report includes a review of the original Orko 
database and reviews subsets of the data loaded into the acQuire Database. This review included drillhole collar, 
downhole survey, density, RQD, and sample ID and assays.  The review also outlines the general acQuire database 
structure. Recommendations are proposed and have been addressed by Coeur, or are included in this report as 
recommendations for further work. 

Coeur identified the need to verify assay data against original hardcopy assay certificates.  Coeur initiated this project 
in 2014. Verification of samples against hard copy assay certificates was conducted manually at both the Chihuahua 
Exploration office and the Chicago Corporate office.  The initial comparisons checked 298 standards and 497 primary 
samples that were analyzed at Inspectorate Laboratory from 2006 through 2008.  No discrepancies between the two 
datasets were identified.  This amounts to verification of 2.9% of QAQC samples and 0.7% of primary samples. 

The Orko and PAS assay results required verification for use in resource estimation.  Further evaluation of the Orko 
master database was completed in 2014.  

Inspectorate Laboratory provided official data files and certificates for 100% of the lab jobs completed from 2007-2009.  
The Inspectorate results were loaded to acQuire directly from the data files and are presumed validated, but will benefit 
from an additional check against the hardcopy certificate.  The SGS Laboratory data files provided by Orko had been 
modified.  Coeur was able to obtain 426 of 753 (57%) original data files and 634 of the original PDF certificates from 
the SGS Laboratory.  The data files received were loaded directly into acQuire and the resulting data are considered 
validated.    

QA/QC procedures were completed on the imported SGS data files, per Coeur's company protocol. A combined silver 
and gold total of 3,180 identifiable QA/QC values were analyzed in acQuire, resulting in 30 failures.  Seven pairs of 
data were excluded from the analysis due to either the standard value exceeding the upper detection limit (UDL) of the 
assay method, or because the standard was not certified for a gravimetric analysis.  Coeur policy mandates that a 
standard fails when the value exceeds ± 3 standard deviations (SD) of the standard value and a blank fails if it exceeds 
± five times the lower detection limit (LDL) of the analysis method.  Failure rates for silver and gold for from the SGS 
data files were 0.7% and 1.3%, respectively. 

Assay pairs from the Orko master database and the SGS Laboratory data files were compared in acQuire to validate 
the primary assay database.  A combination of 46,551 sample pairs of silver and gold were analyzed using x-y scatter 
plots. (Figure 12-1 and Figure 12-2) The silver and gold values should be exact matches and therefore a failure is 
defined as any deviation greater than zero.  The comparison resulted in 510 failures, or 1.1% of the pairs. Figure 12-1 
and Figure 12-2 visually indicate that the failures are of relatively low magnitude. Coeur is confident 54 of the silver 
failures are the result of Orko gravimetric results being merged into a fire assay field.  These are not true failures, but

   94 

the result of manual data manipulation.  The remaining silver and gold failures are assumed to be attributed to manual 
error or discrepancies with reporting of assays at or near the detection level of the assay method. 

 

Figure 12-1: Scatter Plot of Failed Silver Pairs 

 

Figure 12-2: Scatter Plot of Failed Gold Pairs 

The data and statistics presented in this section illustrate that Coeur was able to verify 60% of the primary SGS sample 
count and was able to verify a 43% increase in the QA/QC sample count.  The QA/QC insertion rate of 12%, from the 
SGS data files indicated that the validated data contained an acceptable quantity of QA/QC samples which exceeded 
Coeur's current internal requirement.  The QA/QC completed on the SGS data performed well, with low failure rates.  
The primary assay comparison produced very low failure rates and overall low magnitude failures. In summary, these 
comparisons represent 60% of the primary assay database and 57% of the total lab jobs stored in acQuire.  The 
remainders of the outstanding original data files are considered to be unobtainable.  Therefore, Coeur considered the 
performance of the Orko data that was verified by the SGS data files to be indicative of the performance of the entire 
Orko master database, and subsequently acceptable for use in resource evaluation.

12.4 COEUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER DATA VERIFICATION WORK 

 Field check of drillhole collar coordinates for a random 10% of 2014 drillholes. 
 Submit two batches of SGS samples to ALS in Vancouver to check for lab bias when analyzing samples with 

a 4-Acid ICP digestion. (Initiated July 2014). 
 Completion of database to assay certificate verification of random silver and gold assay results from 2005 

through 2014 assay certificates  It is recommended that 5% of the total sample population for both primary 
and QA/QC samples be verified.   

 Further review of 510 failures reported from the Orko and SGS database comparison. 
 Further review and report on missing samples from the Orko master database.  Develop an action plan to 

include, exclude, or re-define the samples. 

12.5 COEUR DATA COLLECTION CAMPAIGNS 

12.5.1 Density  

The Orko master density database contained 89,226 records of calculated density, with an average density of 2.51 
g/cm3. In 2014, Coeur developed a standardized procedure to improve the accuracy of density measurements.  In 
March 2014 Coeur employees completed 1,667 density measurements using the new procedure.  The average density 
of these measurements was 2.52 g/cm3. The 2014 density measurements were also coded to specific lithologies for 
use in the resource model shown in Table 12-1.

Lithology Density (g/cm3) 

Basalt 2.38 

Metamorphic 2.67 

Sedimentary 2.50 

Volcanic 2.48 

12.5.2 Geomechanical 

In 2013 KP initiated a geomechanical drill program.  The drilling consisted of two holes completed in 2013 and four 
holes completed in 2014.  The drilling was completed by Major Drilling using HQ3 diameter core using triple tube 
techniques.  The geomechanical core was oriented using the Reflex ACTIII device.  The drill core was split and assayed 
using Coeur's procedures discussed in this report.  The assay results for these drillholes are not included in the 
resource estimation data set. 

12.5.3 Reassay of Pulps 

Initial silver assaying by Orko at SGS used a 3-acid digestion with ICP-AES finish for all samples, followed by fire 
assays for samples exceeding 300 g/t Ag.  In 2013, 313 pulp samples were reassayed and demonstrated that using a 
4-acid digestion with an ICP finish resulted in a more complete sample digestion and, on average, higher Ag grades.   

In 2014 Coeur selected all Orko era samples within the 25 - 100 ppm silver grade range for reassay by the 4-Acid 
ICP method. Coeur submitted 6,059 and 825 pulp samples to ALS and SGS laboratories, respectively. Reassay 
results from ALS (Figure 12-3) show the graphical representation of the average increase in Ag grade of 11 percent 
when comparing Coeur's 4-acid digestion ICP results to Orko's 3-acid digestion results.  Reassay results from SGS 
(Figure 12-3 and Figure 12-4) show an average increase in Ag grade of 2.2 percent when comparing Coeur's 4-acid 
digestion ICP results to Orko's 3-acid digestion results.

12.5.4 Orko Era Drill Core Sampling 

Core drilled during the Orko and PAS campaigns was selectively sampled based on geologic observation during the 
core logging process.  In 2013 Coeur initiated a campaign to re-log, sample, and assay portions of the previously un-
split core. The program originated as a consequence of the identification of inconsistencies between the core data and 
the geologic interpretation in cross sections (Figure 12-5).  During the review of the core and logs, Coeur geologists 
identified samples that ended in mineralized material as well as structures and alteration that were unsampled.  The 
geologists collected these new samples from 35 drillholes along three parallel sections.   The program resulted in 3,520 
new primary samples added to the acQuire database.

interpretation in the cross section. 

 Orko Era Quartz Vein Sampling 

In addition to the legacy drill core sampling, Coeur geologists reviewed the database to identify un-sampled intervals 
logged as quartz vein.   A total of 95 samples, representing 120 meters of core length, were identified in the drillhole 
database.  If the material was available and un-sampled, the vein interval and several meters of core above and below 
it would be sampled and assayed. 

12.5.5 Spectroscopy Study 

In 2014, Coeur contracted SRK Consulting of Toronto, Ontario to conduct an Infrared Absorption scan for alteration on 
the Project drill core.   SRK scanned 76 drillholes for a combined 8,568 intervals totaling 24,987 meters. The spectral 
data identifies the presence or absence of clay species and is useful for geotechnical purposes such as identifying fault 
zones, zones of high cohesive strength, and depth to water.  The spectral dataset is stored in the project acQuire 
database.

completed tests from 2007 and 2009.  In the period from 2007 to 2010, a total of 865 samples from diamond drill core 
were used to prepare 44 metallurgical composites, including 28-variability composites.  Orko and PAS, in 2009, shipped 
composites to the SGS metallurgical laboratory in Durango, Mexico.  The composites were used to prepare a new 
master composite that was used in the first of four programs.  A second master composite and variability composites 
were prepared for testing at SGS. 

PAS initiated a test program at McClelland Laboratory, Inc. in 2012.  The McClelland test program and results were 
reviewed in this study.  

13.3 METALLURGICAL TEST PROGRAMS  

Metallurgical development for the Feasibility study was completed at several laboratories and with third party 
consultants.  The following laboratories or contractors contributed to the metallurgical program: 

 ALS Metallurgy, Kamloops (ALS) - mineralogy, and flotation.

 Completed sodium cyanide leach and detoxification of large bulk composites.  
 Completed Merrill-Crowe precipitation of leach solution. 
 Prepared composite samples for solid/liquid separation evaluation. 
 Prepared composite samples for flotation evaluation.  

13.3.2 McClelland Laboratories – PAS Metallurgical Composites  

McClelland received 602 drill core intervals from PAS in January 2012.  Thirty (30) individual composites and one 
Master composite were developed from core samples. Samples for comminution testing were provided; five drums of 
1/2 core were blended, and five buckets of whole core were provided for crusher work index testing, CWi. 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128

McClelland was requested to complete the final report, and ship remaining samples to Hazen.  The following tasks 
were completed at Hazen:    

 Master composite samples were subjected for a Quick Leach optimization test program.  
 Whole core samples were submitted for Crusher work index testing, CWi. 
 Comminution testing was completed for the five comminution composites.  

13.3.3 Hazen Metallurgical Composites – Variability Composites  

Coeur collected two composite groups from the Project site.  The first group was identified as Variability Composites; 
open pit areas were divided into five different rock types; volcanic, sedimentary, quartz vein, metamorphic and intrusive.  
The composites were grouped by depth and two silver grade ranges.   

The silver grades were:  

 Low-Grade (LG), silver grade ranging from 30 to 55 gpt. 
 Average-Grade (AVG), silver grade ranging from 55 to 120 gpt. 

Fifty-three (53) composites were identified, and 1307 drill core intervals were selected, quartered, bagged at the Project 
site, and shipped to Hazen.  

13.3.4 Hazen Metallurgical Composites – Lithology Composites  

The second composite group, based on the Geological database in November 2013, were separated by Lithology; 
Quartz Vein, Volcanic, and Sedimentary.  The composites covered the entire database range by combining the data 
into 10m or 20m elevation bench levels.  The analysis resulted in the identification of 79 individual Lithology elevation 
composites; Quartz Vein – 26, Volcanic – 31, and Sedimentary – 22.  A total of 2739 samples of drill core, representing 
1967 m, were prepared at the Project site.  The selected samples were logged, split to provide ¼ core sections, and 
shipped to Hazen. 

Additionally,  

 The weighted silver grade per elevation bench was determined.  Samples were randomly selected to match 
the weighted grade.  

 The mass of material collected was weighted by the distribution of samples, in the elevation, to provide a total 
composite weight of ~ 700-800 kg. 

 Some elevation-benches were combined to reduce the number of composites. 
 Intervals from previous metallurgical tests programs were omitted.  
 An additional 20-30 kg of 1/2 core, for comminution testing, was collected.  The elevation distribution of 

samples was used to weight the number of ½ core samples selected for comminution tests for each lithology.  

13.4 METALLURGICAL HEAD ANALYSIS 

The composites were subjected to different analytical techniques depending on the laboratory and the composite.  
Analyses included: head assay gold and silver – with a fire assay (AA finish), silver, copper, and zinc – with a 4-acid 
digestion/A.A. finish, cyanide shake test to determine soluble gold, silver, and copper, multi-element ICP analysis, 
mercury (cold vapor/A.A), sulfur speciation analysis, XRD analysis, semi quantitative x-ray fluorescence (XRF) whole 
rock analysis, QEMSCAN analysis, clay analysis, and Cation-Exchange–Capacity (CEC).

13.5 MINERALOGY 

13.5.1 Historical Mineralogy Investigations 

Mineralogy was reviewed by M3 in the 2013 PEA. The following summarized points are from the various mineralogical 
programs: 

 Mineralogy work identified the various contained minerals including the metallic minerals, but was of limited 
use since there was no quantitative data.  

 Gold was not identified, as expected, because of the low concentration of that metal.  
 Silver minerals in the Martha Oxide zone were identified as argentite (Ag2S) and stromeyerite (AgCuS), the 

latter of which was the sole copper mineral.   
 In the Martha Sulfide zone, the primary silver mineral was argentite.  
 In the Abundancia composite the silver minerals were bromo-argentite (AgBr), argentite, and anglesite (a lead 

sulfate mineral with less than 9% Ag in solid solution). The various silver minerals range in size from 15 to 
135 microns. 

13.5.2 Feasibility Study Mineralogy 

The main gangue minerals identified were quartz and feldspar, predominantly K-feldspar.  Quartz had the highest 
concentration in the Quartz Vein composite, and feldspar was most prominent in the Volcanic composite.  The 
Sedimentary composite exhibited the highest carbonate concentration, predominantly calcite.  Other gangue minerals 
were the micas; (biotite and muscovite), clinochlore and chlorite–smectite clays, barite, iron oxide or iron hydroxide, 
titanium oxide, and trace kaolinite. 

Silver was found to be present in a wide variety of silver sulfide minerals.  The Quartz Vein had the highest detected 
occurrences of liberated silver and silver sulfide minerals, in binary association, with sulfide minerals, compared to the 
other two composites.  The Volcanic and Sedimentary composites had a higher percentage of detected minerals in 
association with gangue minerals.   

In the Quartz Vein Lithology composite, the major portion of the silver occurred as silver sulfide, acanthite, Ag2S.  
Traces of silver–selenium sulfide, possibly aguilarite, and complex Ag–Sb–Zn sulfide were also observed.  The largest 
silver-bearing grain observed was about 100 μm in size.  The silver-bearing grains observed were locked in quartz or 
were associated with pyrite, galena and lead carbonate, and iron oxide or iron hydroxide.  Acanthite also occurred as 
very fine veins within quartz.  

In Volcanic and Sedimentary composites, the major portion of the silver occurred as silver sulfide, acanthite, Ag2S.  
Traces of silver–copper sulfide, possibly stromeyerite, were also observed.  The largest acanthite grain observed was 
about 60 by 15 μm in size.  The silver-bearing grains were associated with manganese-rich carbonate, quartz, and 
sphalerite, or other sulfides.  

Due to the low head grade of gold in the samples, gravity concentrations were conducted via a Knelson Concentrator 
to increase the likelihood of finding occurrences.  The majority of the located gold occurrences in the samples 
would be considered liberated, these liberated particles were in general larger in diameter.  Gold inclusions were 
found within the pyrite or gangue particles, and may not be amenable to cyanide leaching.  Gold was detected in 
association with silver sulfide minerals. 

In the Quartz Vein, the average gold concentration was measured at 0.3 g/t, two gold grains, less than 1 μm in size, 
were observed.  The gold grains were contained in iron hydroxide, enclosed in quartz-rich particles.

Pyrite was the most abundant sulfide, followed by sphalerite and galena. The total sulfide concentration was highest 
in the Sedimentary Composite. 

Lead occurred as galena and was also observed as manganese-rich barium–lead hydroxides, as lead carbonate, 
cerussite, and as a lead–zinc–iron–copper–vanadium oxide.   

Zinc was observed in sphalerite, but also occurred in oxidized zinc phases; zinc-bearing clay, zinc silicate, and zinc-
bearing carbonate.  Low levels of zinc were also observed in the silicate clinochlore and iron hydroxide. 

The clay analysis indicated the samples contained clinochlore proper, a non-swelling mineral, and two mixed-layer 
clinochlore-smectite clays, one of which has a higher portion of smectite layers.  Quantitative mineral abundance 
analysis using QEMSCAN indicated the total concentration of clinochlore and mixed chlorite-smectite clay for the 
Quartz Vein composites ranged from 1.3–2.2%, for the Volcanic composites 4.5-6.6%, and for Sedimentary composites 
4.2-4.4%.  

Near infrared analysis of core samples indicated that the oxidation state of the sample did not correlate with silver 
dissolution.  

13.6 COMMINUTION PARAMETERS  

Three previous comminution Bond ball mill work index (BWi) tests were completed indicating work indices of 12.2, 
14.1, and 16.1 kWh/t for three composites. The Bond abrasion index ranged from 0.721-0.764 g.  

Comminution testing for this feasibility study consisted of: Bond crusher work Index (CWi), Bond abrasion index (Ai), 
Bond rod mill work index, (RWi), Bond ball mill work index (BWi), and Semi-autogenous grinding mill comminution 
testing (SMC).   

The Bond crusher work index values were measured from 65 whole core samples obtained from the McClelland-PAS 
test program.  The samples were split by lithology and depth and submitted to FLSmidth for analysis.  The Bond crusher 
work index averaged 9.7 kWh/t ± 3.4 and varied from 21.3 to 5.2 kWh/t for all samples tested.  

The Bond Ai tests were completed on 47 samples.  Bond abrasion index, Ai, ranged from 0.37-1.27 g, and averaged 
0.74 ± 0.25g.   

The Bond BWi tests were completed on 47 samples.  Bond ball mill work index, BWi, ranged from 14.7–18.2 kWh/t 
and averaged 16.1 ± 1.0 kW/t.   

The Bond RWi tests were completed on 36 samples.  Bond roll mill work index, RWi, ranged from 12.7–18.1 kWh/t and 
averaged 15.3 ± 1.4 kW/t.   

Sag mill comminution tests were completed on eight ½-core composites. 

13.7 FLOTATION  

ALS Metallurgy evaluated flotation as part of feasibility study.  Sequential lead-zinc separation and bulk flowsheets 
yielded poor silver and gold recoveries when compared to whole ore cyanidation; the test program was suspended. 

13.8 SODIUM CYANIDE LEACHING  

In this study, McClelland completed a report for a test program initiated by PAS in 2012.  Hazen completed five leach 
programs; Quick Leach study, Development tests, Variability study, Exploratory tests, and Bulk leach tests (2014d).

13.8.1 McClelland Test Results - 2012   

Master composite head analysis indicated silver and gold concentrations of 175 gpt and 0.30 gpt, respectively.  Silver 
recoveries ranged from 80.3% to 87.7%.  Gold recoveries ranged from 74.1 to 79.3%.  Sodium cyanide consumption 
ranged from 0.16 – 0.91 kg NaCN/t.  Lime consumption ranged from 0.3-1.3 kg CaO/t.  Leach kinetics indicated silver 
leaching was increasing after 96 hours, and gold leaching was complete after 50 hours.  

Optimum leach parameters suggest a grind particle size P80 63 microns, initial cyanide concentration of 3 gpl, pH of 
10.3, pulp density was inconclusive, and lead nitrate addition of 30 gpt. 

13.8.2 Hazen Quick Leach Development  

Quick leach development tests evaluated initial sodium cyanide concentration, particle size, leach time, leach 
temperature, and lead nitrate addition.   

The conditions selected for the variability quick leach tests were a particle size P80 of 9 µm, an initial cyanide 
concentration of 4 gpl NaCN, ambient temperature, residence time of 2 hours, 0 lead nitrate, pH 11.5, and a pulp 
density of 20% solids.  

Material was ground to a particle size P80 9.4 -11.2 µm.  Average silver head grades silver ranged from 71.9-161.5 gpt.  
The average residues ranged from 16.6-29.5 gpt.  Silver recovery ranged from 57.5%-89.8% and averaged 74.6%-
77.1%.  Sodium cyanide consumption averaged 0.5-0.9 kg/t.  Lime consumption averaged 1.8-2.4 kg/t.  The data 
indicate a slightly increasing tail grade and recovery with increasing head grade. 

Quick leach results did not correlate with bottle roll recoveries. 

13.8.3 Hazen – Variability, Lithology, and Exploratory Bottle Roll Results  

The variability study consisted of 141 bottle roll tests with samples ground to a particle size P80 of ~45 μm and 23 bottle 
roll tests with the samples ground to a particle size P80 of ~74 μm.  The ground materials were leached for 72 hours, 
at a pulp density of 40% solids, in 1.5 gpl NaCN, and at a pH of 11.5.  Lead nitrate was not added.  

The Exploratory cyanide leach series investigated various alternative leaching schemes to determine silver and gold 
recoveries, or improve metal leaching kinetics.  The Exploratory leach tests included feed and residue size 
classification, baseline cyanide leaching, two-stage leaching, hot leaching, leaching of sand and slime size fractions, 
O2 enriched leaching, and pressure conditioning and pressure leaching.   

Quartz Vein Variability and Lithology composite bottle roll tests indicate silver recovery ranged from 67.7% to 92.8%. 
Average silver dissolutions in Low-Grade Variability, Average-Grade Variability, and Lithology elevation composites 
were 74%, 85% and 87%, respectively.  Gold recovery ranged from 41% to 100%.  Average gold dissolutions in Low-
Grade Variability, Average-Grade Variability, and Lithology elevation composites were 48%, 53%, and 66%, 
respectively.

13.8.4 Bulk Leach – Variability Master Composite  

Hazen conducted a bulk leach test on a 2 kg sample of the Variability Master composite (Hazen, 2014d).  The leach 
parameters were a particle size P80 45 µm, pulp density of 40 wt.% solids, for 96 hours, pH 11.4, and an initial cyanide 
concentration of 4 gpl. 

The silver, gold, copper and zinc extractions were 88%, 65%, 41%, and 3%, respectively.  The sodium cyanide addition 
and lime addition rates were 2.1 kg/t and 0.8 kg/t, respectively.  Leach kinetics were not determined.  

The slurry was filtered, washed and prepared for a sodium cyanide destruction test.  The washed filter cake was re-
pulped in primary filtrate and wash liquor. The liquors were combined to provide 1,000 mg/l free cyanide concentration, 
and a pulp density of 50 wt.% solids.  The prepared slurry was subjected to a cyanide detoxification test and shipped 
to ACZ Laboratories for geochemical characterization. 

The cyanide detoxification process was simulated with the addition of reagents and air to the slurry.  The WAD cyanide 
measured less than 10 mg/l at the conclusion of the test.  Reagents additions were not optimized.  Sodium metabisulfite 
was added at a rate of 23 kg/t ore.  Lime at a rate of 6.5 kg/t ore, and copper sulfate at a rate of 0.2 kg/t ore.  

13.8.5 Bulk Leach – Lithology Master Composite  

Bulk leach tests on the Lithology Master composite were completed at two primary grind sizes, P80 45 µm and 74 µm.  
The leach tests were split into two leaches at P80 74 µm, and two leaches at 45 µm.  The leach parameters were a 
pulp density of 40 wt.% solids, for 72 hours, pH 11.4, and an initial cyanide concentration of 1.54 gpl.   

The average silver, gold, copper and zinc extractions, at a particle size P80 74 µm, were 79%, 63%, 47%, and 3%, 
respectively.  The sodium cyanide and lime consumptions were 1.1 kg/t and 1.4 kg/t, respectively.  

The average silver, gold, copper and zinc extractions, at a particle size P80 45 µm, were 84%, 69%, 49%, and 3%, 
respectively.  The sodium cyanide and lime consumptions were 2.0 kg/t and 1.0 kg/t, respectively. 

Silver leaching was not complete after 72 hours.  

The slurry was filtered, washed, and the filter cake prepared for sodium cyanide destruction tests.  The filter cake was 
repulped in filtrate and wash liquor to provide 1,000 mg/l free cyanide concentration, and a pulp density of 50 wt.% 
solids.  The prepared slurry was subjected to cyanide detoxification and shipped to ACZ Laboratories for geochemical 
characterization. 

Solutions were submitted for ICP analysis. 

13.8.6 1 kg Leach – Lithology Master Composite  

A 1 kg bottle roll leach tests on the Lithology Master composite was completed at a primary grind size, P80 82 µm.  The 
leach parameters were a pulp density of 45 wt.% solids, 72 hours, pH 11.5, and an initial cyanide concentration of 4 
gpl.  Silver, gold, copper and zinc extractions were 81%, 49%, 49%, and 3%, respectively.  Sodium cyanide and lime 
consumptions were 4.2 kg/t and 2.7 kg/t, respectively.  Gold dissolution was complete after 24 hours.  Silver dissolution 
was nearly complete after 72 hours.

13.8.7 Heap Leach Evaluation – ½" Bottle Roll Results 

Twenty bottle roll tests were completed at a particle size P80 8,950 µm to evaluate low grade material for heap leaching.  
The average head grade was 50 gpt.  Silver dissolution averaged 26%.  Heap leaching of low grade material was not 
recommended. 

13.8.8 Feasibility Metal Recovery Methodology 

 Silver Dissolution  

Silver recovery was based on head grade versus tail grade bottle roll results.  The Variability Average-Grade, Lithology 
Elevation bench, and selected Exploratory bottle roll test data were evaluated.   

The following adjustments to the data set were employed: 

 A multiple linear regression was completed using; particle size P80 diameter, Area (P80), and head grade 
versus tail grade, the data correlated poorly.   

 The regression equations were used to adjust the tail grade data to a grind size of P80 of 74 µm.  
 The final head grade versus tail grade regression correlation was based on a recovery adjustment for 

commercial size tank, based on the agitated pressure leach test.  

Figure 13-2 and Figure 13-3 present head grade versus tail grade data, and silver dissolution, respectively.  Silver 
recovery from life-of-mine plan head grades are indicated.

 Gold Dissolution 

Gold dissolution was based on head grade versus tail grade regression of the Variability Average Grade, Lithology 
Elevation bench, and selected Exploratory bottle roll test results. 

The following methodology was employed: 

 Due to low gold grade, poor analytical data resulted in many analyses at or near the detection limits for gold.  
Assay head grade data were select for the data set.  A head grade versus tail grade regression was completed 
and the results reviewed.  The review indicated some negative recovery points, which were replaced with 
adjacent data. 

Figure 13-4 and Figure 13-5 present gold head grade versus tail grade data and recovery, respectively. 

Silver and gold recoveries, based on mine plan head grades, were determined to be 84.1% and 61.2%, respectively.

13.9 SOLID-LIQUID SEPARATION TESTING 

Pocock conducted solids-liquid separation tests on six samples of Lithology Rock Type composites.  Slurry was 
provided at two primary grind size P80 45 µm and 75 µm.  The test program included particle size analyses, flocculant 
screening, conventional, high-rate and paste thickening, underflow viscosity tests, pressure and vacuum filtration and 
pressure clarification.  

13.10 TAILINGS CYANIDE DETOXIFICATION  

The tests indicated that optimum conditions for obtaining a WAD CN concentration less than 100 mg/l are a residence 
time of 99 minutes, with 0.8 kg sodium metabisulfite/tonne ore, and 0.07 kg copper sulfate pentahydrate/tonne ore.  

13.11 MERRILL-CROWE 

Three Merrill-Crowe experiments were performed to demonstrate that silver could be precipitated from solution using 
standard technology.  Silver-bearing leach liquors proved to be amenable to the simulated Merrill Crowe process.  

13.12 FEASIBILITY STUDY REAGENT CONSUMPTION 

The average cyanide consumption was determined to be 1.0 kg/t.   

Lime consumption was determined to be 1.4 kg/t.  

The flocculant consumption was determined to be 0.085 kg/tonne.  

Cyanide destruction reagent consumptions were determined to be 0.8 kg sodium metabisulfite/t and 0.07 kg copper 
sulfate pentahydrate/t.  

13.13 REPRESENTATIVE METALLURGICAL COMPOSITES 

In this study, new composites, based on variability and lithology methodologies, and new metallurgical results, were 
developed independently from previous test work. Metallurgical results obtained from the composites are considered 
representative of the mineralization represented by the selected core samples. The metallurgical results indicate 
variable metallurgical response in the mineralized zones.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 SUMMARY 

A new mineral resource model was built for this feasibility study, using updated drillhole data and multiple indicator 
kriging (MIK) was used to estimate both silver and gold grades.  MIK was used to check for any potential biases in 
previous resource models and because MIK required less time to implement.  Using the new resource model for the 
feasibility study the resulting Mineral Resources, exclusive of Mineral Reserves, are shown in Table 14-1.

1. Metal prices used for the estimation of Mineral Resources were $25 per troy ounce of silver and $1,400 

per troy ounce of gold. 
2. An NSR cutoff of $21.93/tonne ($24.17/short tonne) was used, based on the following parameters: 

NSR = [(Ag price per ounce - refining charge) × plant recovery × payable recovery] + [(Au price per 
ounce -refining charge) × plant recovery × payable recovery] 

3. Rounding of short tonnes, grades and troy ounces, as required by reporting guidelines, may result in 
apparent differences between tonnes, grades and contained metal contents. 

4. Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 
considerations applied to them that would enable them to be considered for estimation of Mineral 
Reserves. 

5. U.S. Investors are cautioned that the term "mineral resource" is not defined or recognized by the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 

6. Mineral Resources are exclusive of Mineral Reserves. 

14.1.1 Methodology 

The estimation methodology used for this resource model was MIK, which was used for both the silver and gold 
estimates.  A result of using MIK is a probabilistic model that represents the probability of finding ore in a model block 
rather than a deterministic model that tags each block as ore or waste.  There are two major advantages to probabilistic 
methods, first they are quicker and less prone to biases that can be inadvertently introduced to the model when using 
deterministic methods and second, probabilistic models allow for a rigorous implementation of estimating mining 
dilution.  It is much more difficult to achieve both items using deterministic models without the introduction of somewhat 
arbitrary factors. 

14.1.2 Significant Changes from Other Models 

The most significant change from the PEA resource model to the feasibility study resource model was the change from 
using ordinary kriging (OK) to MIK.  Previous models used deterministic methods, i.e. hard boundaries were interpreted 
in three dimensions to represent the extent of the vein mineralization.  Interpretation of these boundaries is a time-
consuming task.  Using discrete boundaries generally works well where there are very distinct and well defined veins, 
however there are a number of potential problems with this method.  Other than the time required, the biggest potential 
problem is that it is easy to introduce biases into the resource tonnage and grade with very small changes in the 
interpreted boundaries.  In cases where there are distinct well defined veins, there are inevitably splays and stockworks 
of smaller veins, as seen at the Project.  It can be difficult to account for these smaller veins and the interpretation can 
become very subjective.  For most deposits, an experienced geologist can do an excellent job of building a deterministic

   114 

model that takes into account smaller veins and stockwork. With the potential problems involved, it is difficult to validate 
the deterministic model.  This was one of the primary reasons that the method was changed. 

14.2 GEOLOGICAL DATABASE 

14.2.1 Data Validation 

Following Coeur's QA/QC protocols the database was thoroughly validated by Coeur (Section 11.0) prior to being used 
to develop the resource model.  For the purposes of the resource model the data were essentially used as received 
from Coeur.  No data checks were made as part of the resource modeling process, instead data validation was done 
before resource modeling.  Early in the process a number of problems were found with drillhole surveys and some 
holes with missing data.  All of these potential problems were resolved prior to the final model being estimated. 

14.2.2 Un-Assayed Intervals in the Database 

One significant issue was found with the pre-Coeur drillhole data is that only 37 percent of the meters drilled were 
sampled and assayed because of sampling decisions made by previous operators.  Many of these un-assayed intervals 
are away from the known mineralization, but a significant number of un-assayed intervals are intermixed with assayed 
intervals in the mineralized zones.  Ignoring these un-assayed intervals and treating them as missing data would lead 
to a significant selection bias in the estimate.  To address the issue of un-assayed intervals all of the un-assayed 
intervals were filled with zero values except those that were logged as having no core recovery.  It is anticipated that 
many of the intervals actually would have silver and gold values above zero, but the actual grade would likely be 
significantly less than the ore cutoff, so the impact of using a zero value rather than a non-zero value is likely to have 
minimal impact on the resource estimate. 

Coeur recognizes that the presence of null values in the data is problematical, has identified the un-assayed intervals 
within the first few years of mining and has instituted a program of sampling and assaying the missing intervals.  As a 
standard practice all intervals in Coeur's drill campaign are sampled. 

14.2.3 Lithology Model  

The lithology model developed by SRK Consulting of Toronto was used to code the blocks in the resource model.  Fault 
zones interpreted by SRK were used directly as hard boundaries within the resource model.  Lithology itself does not 
appear to be a factor in controlling the mineralization, thus the lithology model was used only to establish the rock 
density and was not used directly in controlling the interpolation. 

14.2.4 Topographic Information 

Site topography was done by PhotoSat™ (at the request of PAS) using high definition satellite photos (color ortho 
photos with 50 cm resolution acquired on 14 October 2011) from which a digital elevation model (DEM) was built, and 
the DEM then reduced to a topographic map with 1, 5, 10, and 50 m contour intervals.  PhotoSat reports an accuracy 
of ±30 cm on a 1 m grid.  An unknown number of control points were established on the ground to register the satellite 
image to the project datum (datum used is WGS84). 

Contours were provided by PhotoSat in several digital formats, and the digital topographic data were imported into 
MineSight for use in the resource model.  An indirect method of validation of topography by PhotoSat was done during 
PhotoSat's analysis of 759 drillhole collars. This drillhole collar validation for PAS (Section 12.2.3) was done by 
comparing surveyed collar coordinates against collar coordinates determined from digitized collars using PhotoSat's 
images.  Although done for validating collar coordinates, this validation process works equally well for validating 
topography.  In general the surveyed collar coordinates are on average within ±2.5 m of the DEM model.

14.2.5 Densities 

Densities applied to the resource model, the QA/QC results, and measurement methodologies are discussed in Section 
3.7.3.1.  Densities were assigned to the resource model based on SRK's simplified lithology model.  In the lithology 
model each block was coded as metamorphic (2.67 t/m3), sedimentary (2.50 t/m3), volcanic (2.48 t/m3) or basalt (2.38 
t/m3).  After the lithology types were coded into the blocks in the resource model, the densities were stored in the model 
based on the lithology code.  There is one lithology and one density per block based on the majority coding of the 
lithology.  Densities were then used directly in the resource summary and for mine planning. 

14.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 

14.3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

The assay and geological database consists of data from 866 holes representing a total of 267,921 m of drilling.  Silver 
and gold assays are present in 827 holes for a total of 100,446 m assayed.  The average interval length is 0.84 m.  
Only 37% of the drilled meters have been assayed. In addition to assays, there are codes for mineralization, alteration 
and lithology.  EDA focused primarily on analysis of controls on mineralization associated with lithology and the 
relationship between silver and gold.  In addition, multi-element assays were done on a significant number of intervals, 
but those data were not used in EDA or mineral resource estimate. 

 Lithological Controls 

The geological logging of lithology used 65 unique designations that were subsequently grouped into 10 unique 
stratigraphic units (Table 14-2); mineralization is present in all of the lithological units.  Veining is heavily mineralized 
and significant mineralization also appears in the sedimentary and volcanic series.

Non-stratigraphic Codes 0 4.6 9.9 0.030 

Potential "ore" intervals were examined by looking at all intervals where the silver grade was greater than 31.1 ppm 
(Table 14-3). The veining appears to be the source of the mineralization, but significant mineralization occurs away 
from the veins within the adjacent volcanic and sedimentary rocks that are host to the veining.

 Correlation between Silver and Gold 

Correlation between silver and gold is important to the resource evaluation as both contribute to the economic value.  
Distributions of silver and gold were estimated independently then evaluated jointly on a block by block basis.  The 
correlation was examined by stratigraphic unit (Table 14-4), and it can be seen that the correlation is relatively poor 
between silver and gold, but within the ore-bearing units the correlation is not unreasonable.  A correlation of 0.5 could 
easily be explained by the nugget effect seen in the sampling and assaying process where the silver and gold are 
actually highly correlated.

Metamorphic Basement Package 5.4 0.17 4.3 0.020 

 Composites 

Fixed length 2.5 m composites were used for the evaluation of the resource.  A 2.5 m composite was used with a 5 m 
bench height because it is anticipated that the mining will be highly selective.  The composites were declustered using 
a cell declustering technique then tagged with lithology and estimation domain using the appropriate geometric solids.  
Within the model volume there are 95,143 composites from 786 drillholes.   

Declustered weighted statistics for resource modeling domains are shown for the 2.5 m composites in Table 14-5.  
Methodology to establish resource modeling domains is discussed below.  It can be seen that both the silver and gold 
grades are highly variable and that the correlation between the silver and gold is moderate to low.

Cross variograms were calculated to examine the spatial relationship between silver and gold for each of the domains. 
The spatial correlation between silver and gold was very good, very similar to the silver and gold variograms.  Nugget 
effects of the fitted models inferred greater correlation than calculated with the declustered statistics.  Because of the 
nugget effect it is believed that the actual correlation between the silver and gold is higher than what is inferred by the 
declustered statistics and that the lower correlation coefficients can be explained by the nugget effect inherent in the 
variance associated with the sampling and assaying process. 

14.3.2 Spatial Data Analysis 

All of the spatial analysis was based on the 2.5 m fixed length composites.  Correlograms were used exclusively to 
model the spatial structure of the data; and correlograms were calculated for each domain.  All of the data in a given 
domain were used but data pairs that crossed fault boundaries were not allowed.  In this way the faults were honored 
as hard boundaries without partitioning the domains.  If the domains are made too small then it becomes very difficult 
to infer the spatial structure since there are not enough data pairs to dampen out the noise, using all the data in a 
domain while honoring the faults avoided this problem. 

All fitted variogram models used spherical models.  The procedure that was followed to fit models was the same for all 
variograms.  Data were first paired into a three dimensional block matrix.  The major, intermediate and minor directions 
of continuity were determined by slicing the three dimensional matrix to produce three orthogonal two dimensional 
variogram maps.  Once the rotations were determined, three one-dimensional orthogonal variograms were created 
along the rotation axes.  These variograms were then fitted with spherical models using Excel. 

 Silver Variography 

Silver variograms were fitted for the grade data and for the indicators for each domain.  The orientation of the structures 
remained constant for each domain with the exception of North Martha, which changed slightly with the upper indicator 
variables (Table 14-6). 

Table 14-6: Structural Orientation of Estimation Domains 

Domain Strike (Azimuth) Dip (degrees) 
North Martha (Ind. 0 to 4) N15E 30 to West 
North Martha (Ind. 5 to 11) N10E 40 to West 

South Martha N15W 25 to West 
Gloria and Abundancia NS 30 to West 

It became impossible to fit variograms models at the higher indicator thresholds because the noise in the variogram 
overwhelmed any structure present at that point.  The highest fitted variogram model was also used for all subsequent 
indicators.  The fitting of variograms in the undifferentiated domain proved to be problematical because a large number 
of the unassayed intervals fall in this domain.  Visual inspection of the domain shows that the mineralization present 
appeared to parallel mineralization seen in the Martha.  The North and South Martha orientations and variograms were 
used to estimate the undifferentiated domain. 

Structural continuity shown in the silver variograms is generally quite good, and the nugget effect seen in the variogram 
models are relatively low when compared to other precious metal deposits.  This good continuity and low nugget is 
primarily because the mineralization is structurally controlled.  These factors should significantly enhance the mines' 
ability to separate ore and waste with a high level of mining selectivity.

 Gold Variography 

Gold variograms were fitted to the grade data and for the indicators for each domain.  The orientation of the structures 
for gold was identical to that of silver. The fitted variogram models for the gold variograms are very similar to that of 
the silver. 

14.4 RESOURCE MODEL 

14.4.1 Summary 

The dimensions of the resource model are shown in Table 14-7.  The model origin and dimensions are slightly different 
from previous models but were adjusted to be compatible with the SRK geologic model.  A block height of 5 m was 
chosen to be compatible with the anticipated mining bench height.   

Table 14-7: Model Schema 

Dimension Minimum (UTM m) Maximum (UTM m) Block Size (m) No. of Blocks 
East 554,500 557,000 10 250 
North 2,700,050 2,703,200 25 126 
Elevation 1,550 2,270 5 144 

 Modeling Domains 

The resource model was originally separated into three main domains: the Gloria-Abunduncia, the Martha and the 
undifferentiated volume in between.  Orientation of the Martha domain changes slightly from the south end to the north 
end, so the Martha domain was split into North and South domains.  A large part of the drilling in the undifferentiated 
volume has not been sampled or assayed, thus it was virtually impossible to derive variograms for this undifferentiated 
volume.  It appears that any mineralization in this undifferentiated volume is close to parallel to the Martha vein system.  
The undifferentiated volume was combined with the Martha domain and the two domains were estimated together 
using the variograms and orientations derived for the two Martha domains. 

Fault boundaries, developed as part of the geological model, were used to subdivide the domains into fault blocks.  
The fault boundaries were treated as hard boundaries, that is data search was not allowed to cross the fault boundaries 
during estimation.  Fault offsets appear to be relatively small, on the order of 100 meters, but are locally significant in 
the interpolation of the data.  Domain boundaries that are not fault-controlled were treated as soft boundaries.  Using 
soft boundaries the variograms and search orientations change for each domain but the data search was allowed to 
cross the domain boundaries. 

 General Kriging Plan 

The general kriging plan was identical for all variables (silver and gold); only the search orientation and variograms 
used were changed by domain.  A true octant search was used with a maximum of 12 composites per octant.  A 
maximum of 12 composites were allowed from any given drillhole and a minimum of 26 and a maximum of 64 
composites were used for interpolation.  The limits of the number of composites per octant and per drillhole forced all 
estimated blocks to be estimated with a minimum of 3 octants populated and a minimum of three drillholes used.  Block 
kriging was used with a block discretization of 4 × 8 × 2 for the 10 m × 25 m × 5 m block.  A search ellipsoid with radii 
of 500 m along strike, 200 m down dip and 40 m perpendicular to the structure was used for block estimation.  The 
orientation of the search ellipsoid was changed for each domain to be identical with the orientation of the variograms.  
Because of the limits on the number of composites used, the search limits were rarely extended to their maximum limits 
because the number of composite criteria was met before the search limit criteria were met.  The number of composites 
used appears large but 2.5 m composites were used with the 5 m blocks instead of 5 m composites.  The data support 
would be the same with 5 m composites and use half the number of composites.

Composites that fell within the model bounds were coded by fault zone and all of the blocks in the model were also 
coded by fault zone using majority coding.  When the blocks were estimated, only composites within the same fault 
zone were used, i.e. the faults were treated as hard boundaries during estimation. 

The estimation variance was stored in the block model as the third indicator for both silver and gold.  In addition the 
following items were stored in the block model:  number of composites, number of drillholes, distance to the closest 
composite, and the average distance to all composites was retained in the model for both the silver and gold indicator 
kriging. 

14.4.2 Multiple Indicator Kriging 

MIK was chosen as the method used to estimate the assayed values for all of the various domains, both veins and 
non-vein domains.  Both silver and gold values were estimated using MIK, but silver and gold were estimated 
independently of each other.  MIK was chosen because it is capable of producing reasonable estimates when there 
are highly skewed distributions of grades.  For the Project, there are a relatively small number of high-grade samples 
that represent a large portion of the contained metal. 

It is difficult to produce reasonable estimates that are not overly smooth using ordinary kriging (OK) when dealing with 
highly skewed data.  The proper level of smoothing can be achieved by adopting methods that estimate a distribution 
rather than a single value for a block.  Methods, such as, MIK or OK followed by uniform conditioning (UC) can do this.  
MIK was chosen primarily because it is an appropriate method that will work well and because of familiarity with the 
method. 

MIK is a probabilistic method that produces a probabilistic view of the deposit, which is distinctly different from traditional 
models that attempt to produce a deterministic model.  With a traditional deterministic model the actual location of 
mineralized material and the expected grade at every point is predicted.  A resource model is produced that "looks like" 
the deposit.  In contrast with a probabilistic model, the actual location of mineralized material is not determined.  What 
is estimated is the probability of encountering ore as it is mined.  As a large area is mined, the probability can be treated 
as a proportion of the tonnes and grade of ore and waste can be determined.  The resulting resource model that is 
produced will be a "fuzzy" probabilistic model. 

In a deterministic model a single grade is estimated into each block in the model, in contrast in an MIK model the entire 
grade probability distribution is estimated into each block.  With MIK it is possible to apply any cutoff grade to a block 
and determine the probability of encountering material above that cutoff grade. 

The grade distribution is estimated by using indicator variables where an indicator is a variable that is set to zero or 
one.  An example of the use of an indicator would be to create an indicator variable for the composites where it is set 
to 1 if the grade is less than or equal to a threshold value of, say 30 ppm and to 0 if it is greater than 30 ppm.  This 
variable is estimated into the resource model using OK, the result is a continuous value between 0 and 1 that represents 
the probability of encountering a composite less than or equal to the threshold of additional samples taken at the 
location being estimated.  This estimation process is then done for multiple indicators set at a series of increasing 
discrete thresholds. 

The result obtained from MIK is a conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF) for each block estimated.  The 
estimated CDF for each block allows the portion of the block that is above any arbitrary cutoff and the average grade 
of that portion to be calculated. 

A distribution directly estimated with MIK is the probability distribution of composites within the blocks.  What is desired 
is the distribution on minable sized units within a block, not composite sized units.  As the size of the volume being 
estimated increases, the variability of the estimated value will decrease, i.e. the variability of gold grades of a large 
volume of rock will be much less than the variability of the gold grades of individual composites within a given block.

This is known as the volume variance relationship and correcting for this relationship is known as "change of support".  
To turn the estimated probability distribution of composites into a distribution of minable units (SMU), it is necessary to 
reduce the variance of the distribution.  This variance reduction is done by using an indirect lognormal change of 
support with the application of a variance reduction factor (VRF) on a block by block basis.  The change of support and 
the application of the working cutoff grade to the blocks is known as "post processing" the MIK distribution. 

The block CDF is modeled by estimating the probability of obtaining a sample less than or equal to a discrete number 
of thresholds.  For practical considerations, there need to be a relatively small number of discrete thresholds.  The 
thresholds need to be chosen such that the CDF is adequately represented.  If thresholds are correctly selected then 
the average grade can be reasonably calculated and change of support can be properly applied.  Experience has 
shown that the best way to choose these thresholds is to distribute the thresholds such that in the low grade portion of 
the distribution, the amount of data between each threshold is approximately the same, and in the high grade portion 
of the distribution, the amount of metal between each threshold is approximately the same. 

The post-processing of the indicator kriging is done using a parameter free method.  This technique breaks the 
estimated CDF into a probability density function (pdf) for each block.  The pdf is fitted using a piecewise linear function 
that is consistent with the estimated CDF.  A cutoff grade can then be applied by integrating the density function above 
the cutoff. This technique eliminates the use of class means and the interpolation of grades between the thresholds; 
however it is necessary to provide a maximum grade of the distribution.  For the integration of the density function, the 
top end of the distribution, between the last threshold and the maximum grade is considered a triangular distribution.  
The median of a triangular distribution is 29% of the way between the minimum and the maximum while the mean is 
1/3 of the way between the minimum and maximum.  The mean was used to establish the maximum grades. 

14.4.3 Silver and Gold Estimation 

Both silver and gold values were estimated using MIK, but silver and gold were estimated independently of each other 
and they are the only economic metal variables estimated.  It is possible to implement a full bivariate MIK but it is not 
worthwhile at this time.  The two distributions were combined on a block by block basis as part of the change-of-support 
process. 

 Silver Model 

The silver model was produced using twelve indicator variables; with eleven indicator thresholds chosen to provide a 
reasonable balance between the quantity of tonnes and the quantity of metal in each class.  With the large number of 
unassayed intervals, a twelfth indicator was added at 0.0 to properly reflect this portion of the population.  The same 
thresholds were used for all domains.  The highest two thresholds were not estimated in the undifferentiated domain 
and the maximum value of the distribution was adjusted for each domain.  Since MIK will treat all data above the 
highest threshold equally, it is not necessary to consider top-cutting assay values. 

Indicator thresholds were applied to the declustered distribution of the 2.5 m composites.  Composites were declustered 
using cell declustering with a cell size of 50 m east-west, 100 m north-south and 10 m vertically.  Silver distribution is 
extremely skewed with 65% of the metal in the deposit represented by approximately 1% of the data. 

The maximum grades used in the post-processing of the indicator distributions were calculated for each domain using 
the class median of the top class, which assumes a distribution of the top class.  This approach resulted in maximum 
silver grades of 1501 ppm for North Martha, 1018 ppm for South Martha, 946 for Gloria and Abundancia, and 459 ppm 
for the undifferentiated domain.

 Gold Model 

The gold model was produced using 12 indicator variables; with 11 indicator thresholds chosen to provide a reasonable 
balance between the quantity of tonnes and the quantity of metal in each class.  With the large number of unassayed 
intervals, a twelfth indicator was added at 0.0 to properly reflect this portion of the population.  The same thresholds 
were used for all domains.  Unlike the silver model, all thresholds were estimated for all domains in the gold model. 

The indicator thresholds were applied to the declustered distribution of the 2.5 m composites.  Composites were 
declustered using cell declustering with a cell size of 50 m east-west, 100 m north-south and 10 m vertically.  Gold 
distribution is extremely skewed with 65% of the metal in the deposit represented by approximately 1% of the data. 

The maximum grades used in the post-processing of the indicator distributions were calculated using the class median 
of the top class assuming a triangular distribution of the top class, which resulted in a maximum grade of 2.87 ppm 
gold. 

 Post-processing of MIK Models – Change of Support 

The results from MIK create an estimation of the distribution of composites within a block in the resource model.  
Although the estimates were created using a composite block size in the resource model, the blocks will not be mined 
the size they are represented in the resource model; instead they will be mined as much larger volumes, commonly 
referred to as a selective mining unit (SMU).  Thus it's necessary to adjust the estimated grade distribution so that it 
reflects the distribution of SMUs rather than composites.  This adjustment is referred to as a volume-variance 
correction, or change of support. The adjustment consists of reducing the variance of the distribution to represent the 
larger SMU volumes.  A significant benefit of this process is that the resource model should represent what will be 
achieved at the time of mining, i.e. the predicted resource is fully diluted to represent what will be mined.  Factoring in 
additional dilution is not required or recommended.   

Once the adjustment is made to the indicator distribution, it is possible to apply any arbitrary cutoff grade and determine 
the proportion of ore and the average ore grade for a block in the model.  The cutoff grade used for the Project is an 
economic cutoff grade with anticipated revenues from both silver and gold.  Thus it is necessary to look at both the 
silver and gold distributions simultaneously to determine the revenue contribution of each to determine the economic 
cutoff. Treating the silver as the primary variable and gold as a secondary variable is reasonable because the majority 
of the revenue is from silver.  The process of determining the economic portion of the block carried out using an iterative 
approach with a FORTRAN program.  A cutoff grade was calculated for the silver using the average gold grade and 
the resulting ore portion was applied to the gold distribution and a gold grade for the ore portion was calculated.  A new 
cutoff grade for the silver was calculated using the new gold grade which resulted in a new ore portion and new gold 
grade and this process was continued until the ore portion converged.  This process used not only the silver and gold 
distributions but also the economic parameters associated with the project and the metallurgical model discussed 
below. 

A net result of the process is that each estimated block will be populated with the proportion of the block that would be 
expected to be ore and the silver and gold grades of the ore portion of the block (Figure 14-1 and Figure 14-2).

The change of support process requires an anticipated SMU size which is dictated by a number of factors, including 
the size of the mining equipment and the ore control practices employed.  If the SMU size used is too small then the 
model will be under diluted and will predict too few tonnes at too low a grade.  Conversely if the SMU size used is too 
large the model will be over diluted and will predict too many tonnes at too low a grade.  It can be seen that it is critical 
to the veracity of the model and subsequent mine planning that the SMU size used be as close as possible to what will 
be achieved at the time of mining.  The SMU will be used to calculate the amount of variance reduction that will be 
imposed on the indicator distribution.  At operating properties, the required variance reduction is relatively easy to 
determine by reconciling the resource model to the production model.  Prior to production it is necessary to calculate 
the variance reduction theoretically from the SMU size using the variogram.  Variance reduction factors are calculated 
using variograms of the grade.  Grade variograms were fitted by domain and the variance reduction factors calculated 
for an anticipated SMU of 5 m × 5 m ×5 m, which is a relatively small SMU by open pit mining standards, but reflects 
the expectation that a high level of care will be exercised in ore control and mining (Table 14-8).

14.4.4 Metallurgical Model 

The metallurgical model used is primarily dependent on the lithological composition of the ore. The metallurgy 
recoveries were grouped into three distinct rock types: vein quartz, volcanic, and sediments.  It was necessary to 
attempt to predict the relative proportions of the various rock types that mill feed would be composed of, but the 
geological model was not sufficiently detailed to enable it to be used directly to estimate its composition.  An indicator 
model was used to predict the rock type proportions associated with the ore by using the estimated proportions.  Using 
the estimated proportions of rock type a linear weighted average of the metallurgical recovery parameters was 
calculated for each block in the model.  A separate silver and gold recovery were calculated based on the grade of the 
ore portion of the block and stored back into the model. 

 Metallurgical Parameters 

The originally proposed metallurgical recovery parameters consisted of a simple constant tail fraction with steps at 
various grades.  Post-processing of the grade distributions requires that the metallurgical recovery be a continuous 
function rather than a step function and to accomplish this, a linear regression function was fitted to the tail grade 
versus the calculated head grade of the bottle roll tests.  Separate regressions were done for each of the three rock 
types for silver and gold and the regressions were used to predict the recovered grade as a function of the head grade. 

Recovered Grade = Head Grade – Tail Grade (Equation 1) 

Recovered Grade = Head Grade – [Head Grade × slope + intercept] (Equation 2) 

Recovered Grade = Head Grade × (1.0-slope) – intercept (Equation 3) 

The derived parameters are shown in Table 14-9.

Gold   
Quartz Vein 0.020 0.794 
Volcanics 0.050 0.956 
Sedimentary 0.054 0.881 

This was not done originally because the correlation coefficients of the linear regressions are not high, so an average 
tail and head value were used over groups of the data. This resulted in a non-continuous step function of recovery 
which is difficult to use effectively.  Because of the scatter seen in the data, it may be desirable to attempt to determine 
if there are other geological attributes that may be possible to explain the different recoveries. 

 Estimation of the Ore composition 

Ore composition was estimated using three indicator variables, one each for vein quartz, volcanic, and sediments.  It 
was desired to estimate the composition of the ore portion of a block, not the relative proportions of the entire block.  
Indicator variables were established using only the assays that were potentially ore, whether an assay will actually be 
used in the estimation of ore is difficult to determine ahead of time, which is why the potential for ore was used.  An 
assay was classified as potentially ore if the value was greater than 31.1 ppm Ag.  Two calculated sample variables 
were added to the assay database, one for vein quartz and one for volcanic.  If an assay interval was potentially ore 
and logged as vein quartz then the indicator variable was set to 1, if it was potentially ore and not vein quartz it was set 
to zero, and if it was not potentially ore it was set to missing, the volcanic indicator was set in a similar fashion.  A 
separate composite file was created for the ore composition indicators using fixed length 2.5 m composites.  The valid 
length (the length of the defined portion) of the composites was also stored.  After the composites were created, a third 
indicator was added to represent the sediments as one minus the vein quartz and volcanic indicators. 

Since the indicators only represent lithological proportions of the ore, it was impossible to derive variograms for them 
because the indicators were estimated by domain, with the fault zones as hard boundaries, just as the grade indicators 
were.  The variograms modeled for the third silver indicator for each domain were used to estimate the ore composition 
indicators. 

The estimation of the indicator values for a block was weighted by the valid length of the composite along with the 
kriging weights.  This was done because the length of the potential ore within a composite would be volumetrically 
proportional to the composition of the ore. 

 Determination of Silver and Gold Recoveries by Block 

A result of the estimation of the ore composition is the three indicator values should nominally sum to 1.0, and to insure 
they would sum to 1.0 the indicator values were normalized.  A weighted linear average of the metallurgical parameters 
was then calculated using the predicted relative proportions and these proportions were used in the post-processing 
of the indicator distributions to determine the ore portion and ore grade of a block.  Once the ore grade of the block 
was determined, it was possible to calculate the final recovery for both gold and silver and the metallurgical recoveries 
were stored back into the block.

14.4.5 Model Classification 

Estimated blocks within the resource model were classified as Measured, Indicated, or Inferred based primarily on data 
support and closeness to available composite data.  These two factors are indirectly represented by the kriging 
estimation variance, thus the final resource classification was based on this estimation variance.  This resource 
classification approach is consistent with accepted and legal definitions of Measured, Indicated and Inferred. 

Estimation variance for the third silver indicator is generally preferred for use as the criterion for resource classification 
as it will directly reflect the geometric configuration of the data.  When the estimation is interpolating between data, the 
estimation variance will generally stay relatively low, reflecting higher confidence.  When the estimation starts 
extrapolating away from data, the estimation variance will rise rapidly, reflecting low confidence.  The estimation 
variance is basically made up of three components; first is the natural variability of the data; secondly is the distance 
from the block being estimated to the data being used; and thirdly is how well the data points are spread out in space.  
The distribution of the average distance to the closest composite is shown in Figure 14-3.  There is some overlap in 
the distance to the closest composite but this only reflects one aspect of the data configuration and not how all of the 
data used is spatially configured.  The distribution of the estimation variance versus the distance to the closest 
composite is shown on Figure 14-4.  For this study, the thresholds chosen are 0.2 for Measured and 0.4 for Indicated, 
with everything greater than 0.4 being Inferred.

Figure 14-4: Estimation Variance vs. Distance to Closest Composite 

The final classification is shown in Figure 14-5.  An example of the final classification was based on the distance to the 
nearest composite.  Where the estimation variance is less than 0.2, the block has been classified as Measured, where 
it is greater than or equal to 0.2 and less than 0.4, the block has been classified an Indicated; and when greater than 
or equal to 0.4 it is Inferred.   

There is actually a relatively small amount of Inferred material estimated into the resource model.  This is due to a large 
part of the function of the kriging plan because the kriging plan requires data to be present in at least three octants and 
from at least three drillholes.  These limitations prevent excessive extrapolation of the model away from available data.  
Allowing further extrapolation away from the data would result in estimates that would be considered basically 
unsupported.  An example of the estimation variance and final classification is shown if Figure 14-5 from the 1950 
bench.

14.4.6 Model Validation 

Three levels of model validation were done: first the model was checked to ensure that it was globally unbiased, second 
it was checked to ensure that it was spatially unbiased, and finally the resource model was visually checked in cross-
section and plan to ensure that the model compared reasonably to the drilling. 

The MIK model was compared to a NN model to check for unbiasedness.  The NN model will provide poor local 
estimates and should never be used for local estimates, but the NN model will provide a superior unbiased global 
estimate of the grade distribution within the model volume.  Therefore, over large volumes, the NN estimate can be 
used to provide an excellent check against unbiasedness in the model.  The average grade of each block was 
calculated using the estimated indicator distribution, the e-type estimate.  The NN estimate was populated into the 
model by taking the nearest composite to the block center for each block.  The nearest neighbor estimate honored the 
fault boundaries as did the kriged model. 

Global unbiasedness was checked by averaging all of the estimated Measured and Indicated blocks in the model as 
summarized in Table 14-10.  It can be seen that the e-type estimate for silver is slightly higher than the NN estimate 
while the gold estimate is slightly lower.  These differences are within acceptable limits.

Swath plots were developed by averaging all of the block values within a given east-west section, north-south section 
or given elevation.  The values for the nearest-neighbor and e-type estimates were plotted for each of the orthogonal 
directions.  The swath plots were examined by estimation domain and globally.  The global plots are shown in Figure

14-6 through Figure 14-8. It is expected that the kriged values would be a little smoother than the NN estimates which 
is the case.  It can be seen that the kriged estimates follow the trends of the NN estimates in all three directions.  There 
does not appear to be any spatial bias in the estimate.  The exact same validation process was done for the gold 
estimate with similar results. 

 

Figure 14-6: North-South Swath Plot – Silver 1 

As a final validation the resource model was compared in cross-section and in plan against the drilling data using 
computer visualization.  The resource model appears to do a very reasonable job of representing the original drilling 
data.  The model also appears to be consistent with the faulting and domain models, as intended. 

The ability of the mine operator to separate ore from waste selectively and the continuitiy or lack of continuity in the 
veining could reduce the average grade mined.  There are no other mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, permitting or 
other relevant factors that would materially affect the mineral resource estimate.

15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

Table 15-1 presents the mineral reserves for the Project based on the mine and plant production schedules developed 
for the project.  The mineral reserves amount to 37.3 million ore tonnes at 105.4 g/t silver and 0.174 g/t gold.  Contained 
metal amounts to 126.4 million ounces of silver and 208,500 ounces of gold.  Measured and indicated mineral 
resources in the production schedule are converted to proven and probable mineral reserves, respectively.

1. W. David Tyler is the QP for these reserve estimates. Metal prices used for estimation of Mineral 

Reserves were $22 per troy ounce of silver and $1,350 per troy ounce of gold.  Metal prices used for 
the estimation of Mineral Resources were $25 per troy ounce of silver and $1,400 per troy ounce of 
gold. 

2. An NSR cutoff of $21.93/tonne ($24.17/short tonne) was used, based on the following parameters: 
NSR = [(Ag price per ounce -refining charge) × plant recovery × payable recovery] + [(Au price per 
ounce -refining charge) × plant recovery × payable recovery] 

3. Rounding of short tonnes, grades and troy ounces, as required by reporting guidelines, may result in 
apparent differences between tonnes, grades and contained metal contents. 

4. U.S. Investors are cautioned that the term "mineral resource" is not defined or recognized by the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 

15.1 DESIGN ECONOMICS 

Table 15-2 shows the economics for mine design and production scheduling.  It should be noted that these are initial 
estimates used to initiate mine design and scheduling and are not the final economics developed for the Feasibility 
Study.  The final pit design was based on silver and gold prices of $22 and $1,350 per ounce, respectively. 

The mining, processing and G&A costs were estimated using the costs included in the 2013 PEA.  The costs were not 
escalated between the PEA and the Feasibility Study.  Average recoveries for silver and gold were 84.1% and 61.2%, 
respectively, based on the metallurgical model provided in the resource model. 

The NSR calculation for the mine plan and mineral resource per tonne is: 

NSR = [(Ag price per gram-refining charge) x silver recovery x refinery payable x silver grade] + 

[(Au price per gram-refining charge) x gold recovery x refinery payable x gold grade] 

NSR =  [($22.00 / 31.1035) – 0.0122] x Silver Recovery x 0.997 x Ag grade (g/t)] +  Silver Contribution 

 [($1350 / 31.1035) – 0.0122] x Gold Recovery x 0.9950 x Au grade (g/t)]  Gold Contribution 

NSR is calculated in US$ per tonne of ore.  The breakeven cutoff grade would include the processing, G&A and the 
mining cost per tonne and totals $17.43 per tonne.  The incremental cutoff grade assumes that the mining cost is sunk 
for blocks that have to be moved from the pit.  The internal cutoff grade includes processing plus the G&A cost and 
equals $16.11/tonne.

As will be discussed in Section 16, Mining Methods, the mine production schedule and resultant mineral reserves 
estimate, is based on cutoff grades that vary from year to year to balance mine and plant production capacities.  The 
cutoff grades are higher than the breakeven and internal cutoff grades. 

Mining advance rates are high for the ore benches and will be further discussed in Section 16.  There are no other 
mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, permitting or other relevant factors that would materially affect the mineral reserve 
estimate.

16 MINING METHODS 

The Project mine plan was developed using conventional hard rock open pit mining methods.  No underground 
resource was envisioned in this mine plan. While a smaller, higher grade portion of the resource could be recovered in 
an underground mine, the scale and percent recovery of the resource would be substantially diminished.  In addition, 
the complicated structure of the low angle Martha vein which makes up 60% of the resource would make underground 
mining complicated and costly.  

Scoping studies indicated that a production schedule filling the mill at 10,000 tpd maximized the Project return on 
investment.  The total material rate is tied to equipment productivity.  The total material moved ramps up to 214,000 
tonnes per day in year 6, and averages 60,400 ktonnes/yr or 167,700 tpd for the first 10 years.  The mine is scheduled 
to operate 365 days/yr with two, 12-hour shifts/day. 

The mine plan was developed with a phased approach to facilitate sufficient ore release to provide the mill feed desired.  
In addition to the phases, mining was envisioned on 5 m in ore and 10 m in waste to increase productivity and ore 
release. The approach to phase designs, mine schedule, and mine equipment requirements are summarized below. 

16.1 PHASE DESIGN 

A Lerchs Grossman algorithm using a 10% discount rate was used as a guide to the design of the phases or pushbacks.  
Multiple economic pits were developed using the costs, slope angles and recoveries outlined in the Section below. The 
slope angles used include an allowance for roads and recommended catch benches in the overall slopes. Metal prices 
were varied from low to high in order to establish a series of multiple nested pit geometries and resulting NPVs.  The 
results of this work indicated the starting point, final pit and the extraction sequence that maximized the NPV throughout 
the mine life.   

The evaluation was based on a $22 per ounce silver and $1,350 per ounce gold price (Table 16-1).  Recoveries were 
based on the metallurgical model.  Refining costs and payabilities were based on quotes received for refining the 
Project doré.  For pit design purposes, prices from the PEA were used to establish the pit limits.  This pit was designed 
on only Measured and Indicated resources.  Inferred resources were not included.   

The benches were discounted according to a twelve 10-m bench per year annual advance rate.

Discounting of the ultimate pit by use of a discount to the value throughout the depth of the pit reduces the likelihood 
that uneconomic material will be mined at some future date.  The discounting prior to estimating the economic pit is 
applied in order to maximize the NPV of the Project. 

Seven phases were designed for Project with a minimum of 100 m of operating width on each bench within a phase, 
in general.  Phase 1 was sized to contain roughly one year of mineralized material.  The following summarizes the 
basic parameters used for mine design.  The challenge in mining the Property is that there frequently is not one month 
of ore available on any one bench.  General design criteria are listed in Table 16-2.   

Table 16-2: Phase Design Parameters 

Haul Road Width 30 meters 
Haul Road Grade 10% Maximum 

Interramp Slope Angles by sector  
Operating width between pushbacks 100 meters nominal 

The phases were tabulated from the block model and those tabulations were used as input to the development of the 
mine production schedule. Figure 16-1 illustrates the relative position of the phases at surface.  Table 16-3 summarizes 
the material in each phase. 

Phase design was challenging since the majority of the ore is in the Martha Vein in the base of the deepest phases. 
The initial phases were focused on mining the more vertical sectors of the mine, in the Abundancia and Gloria veins.  
This is illustrated in Figure 16-1.  This shows in the phase numbering from low to high, with Phases 1 through 3 mining 
the vertical veins, providing ore for mill feed while waste is removed from Phase 4.

16.2 METAL PRICE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 

A comparison of LG pits was made to show the sensitivity of the resource to metal prices.  The same economic and 
recovery factors were used as well as the preliminary slope angle recommendations.  The exceptions are the slope 
angles were estimated using a 40 degree slope in the area between the Abundancia and the satellite pits.  The LG 
analysis used a 10% discount rate in every case.  The economic pits and the strip ratio calculated include the inferred 
material as waste.

16.3 MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 

The mine production schedule was developed with the goal of filling the mill at 10,000 tpd and maximizing the Project 
return on investment.  Multiple mine production schedules were developed that analyzed alternative cutoff grade 
strategies versus mine total material movement.  Total material rates were tied to the size and number of loading units 
so that the final selected schedule would provide efficient use of the capital equipment employed. 

The multiple schedules were evaluated on a NPV basis at the project design prices that were used to establish the 
mineral resource.  The best overall production schedule on an economic and practical basis was selected and is 
summarized in Table 16-6. 

This schedule utilizes a variable-cutoff scheme to maximize the grade moving to the processing facility. Five cutoffs 
were selected to allow the schedule optimization program to calculate the best solution to keep the mill filled to capacity.  
In order to move waste more efficiently, it was decided to mine waste from 10-m benches.  This kept the vertical 
advance rates in waste to a reasonable 10-12 benches per year.  To provide for selectivity, ore was planned to be 
mined from 5-m benches. Rates on 5-m benches are aggressive at 10,000 tonnes per day ore feed rates.  The vertical 
advance in ore is 18-20 benches per year. 

Pre-production is estimated to require 12 months, starting at 1 shift per day of operation.  Once the first shift of operators 
is trained, a second shift will start training in the last four months of that year.  A third shift will be added two months 
after that.  A staff of seasoned operators will be hired to be a nucleus of trainers during the pre-production period and 
then to transition to senior operators.   

Preproduction stripping will occur in Phases 1, 2 and 3.  In many cases there is less than 1 month of mineralized 
material per 5m bench within a phase at the Project.  Consequently, the mine plan maintains 2 phases in mineralized 
material in order to assure that mineralized material is released and available to assure plant feed.   

The mineralized material that is encountered during pre-production (509 ktonnes) will be stockpiled near the crusher 
(or in the pit) and delivered to the mill during Year 1.  The mineralized material in the upper benches of Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 is limited in quantity.  This material is accumulated and stockpiled to ensure there is sufficient mineralized 
material release in Phase 1, Phase 2, and the stockpile combined to assure mill production.  

Low grade material that is above the internal cutoff of $16.11/tonne NSR and less than mill feed cutoff in the early 
years will be stored in the low grade stockpile that is located northeast of the crusher.  That material is planned to be 
re-mined and delivered to the mill in later years.  Several cutoffs were used in to optimize the ore feed to the mill.  The 
cutoffs used, by year, are listed in Table 16-7. Those cutoffs were based on lower metal prices and are summarized in 
Table 16-5. The bottom of Table 16-6 illustrates the mineralized material planned for processing inclusive of stockpile 
re-handling.

The cutoff grade for the mine schedule uses an NSR calculation that includes a credit for both the silver and gold.  
Using the parameters in Table 16-1, and using the metallurgical recovery model, an initial silver cutoff is calculated 
using the average gold grade in the block.  Using the block percent ore, the average grade of gold is calculated for that 
portion of the grade distribution.  The recoveries and resulting revenues are recalculated to re-estimate a new silver 
cutoff.  This process is iterated until it converges.   

The mine plan for the Project includes only Measured, and Indicated category mineralization.  The economics do not 
include a credit from Inferred mineralization.  The mine plan material in Table 16-6 contains 37.3 million tonnes of mill 
feed as shown in Table 16-7.  

In addition, there are 3.4 million tonnes of mineralized material which is inferred.  This resource offers potential metal 
production if the material can be converted to Measured or Indicated by additional drilling, within the economic pit shell 
and between the pits. 

Once the pit was designed, incremental cutoffs were used to decide if direct mining of higher grade material could 
sustain the mill feed requirements.  The desire was to feed the highest grade directly to the mill and stockpile lower 
grade material until the direct mining of that material could not fill the mill.  Then stockpiled material would be added to 
the mill feed, from the highest grade stockpile first.

reserves.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  Please see 
Section 14 of this report for a discussion of the qualifications and assumptions made by the Qualified Persons (QPs) 
responsible for this Report pertaining to mineral resource estimates. 

16.3.1 Waste and Low-Grade Storage 

The annual mine schedule drawings at the end of this section illustrate the location and size development of the waste 
dumps and the low-grade stockpile.   

The low-grade stockpile is located adjacent to and east of the crusher and southeast of the Abundancia (main) pit.  The 
location was selected to be a reasonable haul during the mine life for the storage of the material as well as a short haul 
distance to the crusher at the end of the mine life.  The stockpile is planned to be re-mined and is not designed for 
future reclamation. The maximum total storage planned for the low-grade stockpile is 4,888 ktonnes of low-grade 
mineralized material that will be re-handled in subsequent years as the schedule requires.   

There are two waste dumps planned at this time.  The west dump is located 100 m northwest of the pit and the east 
dump is located 700 meters east of the pit.  Waste storage was designed at 2.5 to 1 overall slopes (21.8 degrees) to 
facilitate reclamation at the end of the mine life.  Dump lifts are expected to be 30 m high at the angle of repose (37 
degrees) with 35 m setbacks between lifts.  The total storage of waste material over the mine life is 583.7 million tonnes.  
The west dump is designed to contain 354.7 million tonnes and the east dump will contain 472.8 million tonnes, for a 
total dump capacity of 851.9 million tonnes.   

There is no provision for re-contouring of the waste dumps within the mine operating costs.  Re-mining of the low-grade 
stockpile is included in the mine operating costs. 

16.3.2 Mine Equipment Requirements 

Mine equipment is expected to be comprised of standard commercially available units.  Principal mining equipment is 
a fleet of hydraulic mining shovels and 184 tonne class mechanical drive rock trucks. 

Drilling on 5-m benches is expected to be completed with rotary blast hole rigs with 180 kN pull down capacity.  Drilling 
on 10-m benches is expected to be completed with rotary blast hole rigs with 200 kN pull down capacity. A down-the-
hole drill will be used for drilling trim wall patterns. 

Drill capacity was based on a 0.2 kilogram of explosives per tonne of rock powder factor.  This necessitated the use of 
the maximum drill bit sizes for the 5 and 10-m drills.  The drill bit used for the 5-m benches was sized at 20.3 centimeter 
diameter.  The drill bit for the 10-m benches was sized at 25.4 cm diameter. 

The blasted rock will be loaded into 184-tonne haul trucks using three 26 m3 hydraulic shovels and one 18.5 m3 front-
end loader.  The loading equipment was selected to be able to mine on 5 m and 10 m benches.  Truck fleet 
requirements were developed from haul time simulation over profiles measured for each material type, by phase, for 
each year of the mine plan.  The trucks can be loaded with the hydraulic shovels and loaders.  

The equipment fleet includes a large hydraulic excavator with a backhoe configuration that can be used to load 
mineralized material in narrow veins or used as an auxiliary support unit.  The excavator has been scheduled for heavy 
use in all years so that the operating costs reflect the potential use as a material loading unit.  A 10.5 m3 loader and 
two 100-tonne haul trucks will be used for mining of high grade within the pit to improve selectivity and rehandling of 
stockpiled material.

16.3.5 Manpower Requirements 

Mine total manpower is based on having a 3 panel roster of crews to man the mine on a 2 by 12-hour shift basis.  The 
rotations are anticipated to be 5 days of dayshift, 5 days of nightshift and 5 days off, with 24 hours between the end of 
day shift and the start of night shift. This allows for one crew to be off at all times. 

Operating manpower numbers were set by the numbers of equipment, multiplied by the 3 panels.  Maintenance 
manpower numbers were set by using experience and a ratio of about 60%.  These numbers do not include the 
contracted services for diesel supply, tire maintenance and explosives delivery.  A blasting crew was put on to design 
and load the explosives.  

Labor rates are modeled after Coeur Mexico's Palmarejo operations, and include fringe benefits.  An allowance of 10% 
of the overall manning schedule was added to allow for vacation, sickness and absenteeism. 

16.3.6 Supervisory – Salaried Labor 

A project supervisor is assigned to the general manager to accomplish minor projects during the life of mine.  
Maintenance supervision also doubles as warehouse and purchasing supervision, at the shop/warehouse complex, 
due to their close proximity.

16.4 WASTE STORAGE DESIGNS 

16.4.1 Dump Design Criteria (Geotechnical) 

The west and east waste storage facilities (WSF) have been designed with these parameters. Both WSFs have been 
designed at 2.5 to 1 overall slope angles, 30 m lifts, at an overall slope angle which is angle of repose (37 degrees) 
and includes a 35 m catch bench. The WSFs have been designed to accommodate a 30-m wide haul road. The toes 
of the WSF's are approximately 25 m from the property boundaries. The WSF's have also been designed to respect 
the maximum LG pit.  The WSF capacities and designs are shown in Table 16-14 and Figure 16-9, respectively. Dump 
designs have been redesigned since the PEA to now include a 30-meter setback from the pit rim and from property 
boundaries under Coeur control.  This will allow for seepage collection structures at the toe of the dumps.

Figure 16-9: West and East Waste Storage Facility Design 

Three options have been developed for the Low-Grade Stockpile (LGS) (Table 16-15). The LGS is assumed to be built 
in single 5 m lifts at the angle of repose (37 degrees). The LGS has been designed to accommodate a 30 m wide haul 
road. The LGS access is from the crusher pad in all three options. Option 2 has dual access from the pit. The 3rd 
option includes an allocation for splitting the stockpile between high and low grade material. The low-grade stockpile

All waste storage and stockpile designs are based on a dry bank density of 2.5 tonnes per cubic meter and a swell 
factor of 30 percent.

16.4.2 ARD Considerations (If Applicable) 

Geochemical testing of waste materials showed that 16% (6 of 37) of volcanic waste rock samples analyzed are acid-
generating as defined by regulations published by SEMARNAT for characterization of mining wastes and hazardous 
wastes (NOM-157) (SRK, 2014K). Additional testwork will be required to assess the portion of the volcanic rock types 
in the future waste rock dump that will be acid generating and will need to be managed through selective handling, 
placement, and water management.  No extraordinary waste rock management was assumed for the purposes of this 
study. 

Numerous constituents in waste rock exceed the dry base maximum permissible limits of NOM-157. However, when 
subjected to the leaching analysis (PECT test), no analyses exceeded the maximum permissible limits for the PECT. 
By definition in NOM-157, none of the waste rock is therefore classified as "dangerous" due to metals toxicity. 

16.4.3 Recommendations  

Suggestions are to use an indicator to estimate the percentage of mineral within blocks.  This mineral percentage can 
be used as a boundary to separate the data sets for estimation at some cutoff.  Pit designs should be updated to reflect 
the latest geotechnical recommendations.  When expedient, a bench through the scoria should be excavated to 
generate data to allow geotechnical design recommendations.  Slope stability monitoring while mining initial phases

should also be planned using technology such as the use of reflectorless surveying or radar monitoring. This will allow 
the final slopes to be steepened opportunistically and reduce design conservatism. 

In addition, a number of design changes were noted during the planning and costing exercise which should be 
implemented.  These include:  

 The discounting in the economic pit shells should be adjusted to account for the advance rates seen during 
this schedule. 

 A method should be developed to allow for the Abundancia pit to be scheduled as two pits mining concurrently.  
This would allow an improvement in the production profile, by accessing ore at the bottom of phase 4 sooner, 
while still mining mill feed from phases 1 through 3.  A potential solution may be available using linear 
programming. 

 Pit ramps should be adjusted to allow for continuous access to adjacent phases, when possible, as the 
subsequent phases are mined.  This will allow for backhaul of waste material to fill areas where mining has 
been completed. 

 Haulage routes should be optimized to minimize material movements.   
 Drill density in the Tajitos should be reviewed to more fully develop the resources in those pits. 
 Review of mining costs, using haulage simulations, should be done to better estimate the incremental haulage 

cost on a bench-by-bench basis. 
 The use of a geotechnical model could provide for a more optimum slope design. 

Mine plans should be detailed on a month-by-month basis for the first 3 years, to match the long-range plans developed.  
A strategy should be developed that considers a protore cutoff for low-grade material and accounts for a storage 
location for that protore.   

Finally, plans for drilling for ore control should be more developed to allow planning of the use of RC drilling. 

16.5 GEOMECHANICAL – OPEN PIT 

16.5.1 Introduction 

Coeur is currently evaluating the feasibility of mining the deposit using several open pits: 

 Abundancia Pit (the main pit, 460 m deep)  
 North Satellite Pit (105 m deep) 
 Central Satellite Pit (130 m deep) 
 South Satellite Pit (115 m deep) 

KP was retained by Coeur to complete the geomechanical and hydrogeological work needed to support feasibility level 
slope design for the Abundancia pit.  Preliminary recommendations that were based on limited site investigations were 
also provided for the satellite pits.  The completed work included:  

 A review of all available geological and structural information 
 A geomechanical and hydrogeological site investigation program 
 Laboratory strength testing 
 Characterization of the engineering properties of the encountered rock masses 
 Slope stability analyses 
 The development of slope recommendations for the final pit walls

This report summarizes the completed work and presents feasibility level final pit slope recommendations for the 
Abundancia pit.  

16.5.2 Site Investigation Program 

The geomechanical and hydrogeological site investigation program was designed to support the pit slope design of the 
proposed open pits.  The site investigation program was completed between December 2013 and March 2014, and 
included the following: 

 Six (6) oriented and triple-tubed geomechanical drillholes with associated detailed geomechanical logging 
and hydraulic conductivity (packer) testing 

 Installation of multi-point vibrating wire piezometers in three (3) geomechanical drillholes 
 Detailed geomechanical logging of intervals of full core from seven (7) exploration drillholes 
 Underground line mapping at two (2) locations, and surface line and spot mapping at one (1) and two (2) 

locations, respectively 
 Collection of 123 samples for laboratory strength testing. Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), Triaxial 

and Direct-Shear tests were completed 
 On-site evaluation of the susceptibility of the rock mass to time-dependent degradation 
 Borehole televiewer surveys of eight (8) exploration drillholes and one (1) geomechanical drillhole conducted 

by Groupe Qualitas Inc. 
 Training Bufete Minero y Servicios de Ingenería, S.A. de C.V. geologists in drill supervision and Expromin 

S.C. geologists in detailed geomechanical logging 

16.5.3 Rock Mass Characterization 

The data collected from the geomechanical site investigations and laboratory strength testing allowed several 
geomechanical domains to be defined based on rock mass characteristics.  Two possible domain definitions were 
considered and, ultimately, it was decided that domains would be defined by lithology.  A summary of the rock mass 
characteristics for each domain is included below.  

 Scoria - The characteristics and spatial extents of the Scoria are currently not well understood, as limited 
information is available for this unit.  No recommendations have been provided for the Scoria.  

 Basalt - This domain is characterized by an average UCS value of 120 MPa and a mi value of 13.  The quality 
of the Basalt varies with the quantity of vesicles, but is generally GOOD quality rock with relatively short (< 5 
m) intervals of reduced quality.  The basalt has a RMR89 design value of 60.  

 Paleosoil - The Paleosoil and the associated zone of paleo-weathering in the underlying Basalt or Volcanics 
is characterized by an average UCS of 25 MPa and is classified as POOR quality rock with a RMR89 design 
value of 30.  A mi value was not estimated.  Due to its limited thickness and flat orientation, the Paleosoil was 
not considered in the analyses.   

 Volcanics - This domain is characterized by an average UCS of 80 MPa and a mi value of 10.  The rock mass 
quality varies from FAIR to GOOD with a RMR89 design value of 55.  

 Sediments - This domain is characterized by an average UCS of 55 MPa and a mi value of 9.  This domain 
is classified as GOOD to VERY GOOD quality rock with a RMR89 design value of 70.  

 Metasediments - This domain is characterized by an average UCS of 60 MPa and a mi value of 5.  This 
domain is classified as FAIR to GOOD quality rock with a RMR89 design value of 50.  The contact between 
the Metasediments and the Sediments is faulted and thought to have an increased susceptibility to time-
dependent rock mass degradation. 

 Martha Vein and Hangingwall Zone - This domain consists of the Martha Vein and a 20 m thick zone of 
reduced rock mass quality in the hangingwall of the upper vein.  The domain is characterized by an average 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
   157 

UCS of 65 MPa.  A mi value of 10 was assumed based on the results for the Volcanics and Sediments.  This 
domain is classified as POOR quality rock with a RMR89 design value of 35.  

 Other Veins - The Abundancia, La Gloria and Transversal veins are characterized by an average UCS of 65 
MPa.  A mi value of 10 was assumed based on the results for the Volcanics and Sediments.  This domain is 
classified as POOR to FAIR quality rock with a RMR89 design value of 35.  

The overburden is expected to form only a minor part of the proposed pit slopes and was not considered in the domain 
definition process and subsequent analyses. 

16.5.4 Stability Analyses and Pit Slope Design 

Based on the location and characteristics of the geomechanical domains and the pit design provided by Coeur, 11 
design sectors were identified.  Slope stability analyses were undertaken on each sector to define achievable slope 
configurations.  These analyses included Kinematic and Limit-Equilibrium analyses.  The results from these analyses 
provided guidance on achievable bench face, inter-ramp and overall slope angles for each design sector.  

A slope design summary is included below: 

 Bench Face Angle:  55 to 70° 
 Bench Width:  6.5 to 10 m  
 Bench Height:  10 to 15 m (double or triple benching 5 m benches)  
 Inter Ramp Angle:  36 to 49° (for heights up to 150 m) 
 Overall Slope Angle:  31 to 45°  

16.5.5 Geomechanical Conclusions and Recommendations 

The provided pit slope design recommendations are based upon the currently available geological, structural, 
geomechanical and hydrogeological data.  The results of the analyses and a review of precedent practice suggest that 
the recommended geometries are reasonable and appropriate.  To achieve these angles, the design assumes that 
controlled blasting and proactive geotechnical monitoring will be undertaken, along with an on-going commitment to 
geomechanical data collection and analyses. The results of the analyses suggest that groundwater depressurization 
is not likely to strongly influence overall slope stability; however, the phreatic surface that develops behind the pit walls 
should be carefully monitored and depressurization implemented on an as-needed basis.  Maintaining flexibility in the 
mine plan will be important to accommodate any slope stability issues. 

Future work should include a review of the updated pit design when it becomes available, as well as the work required 
to support detailed design.  The detailed design level work is expected to include more detailed analyses based on 
additional and/or updated data for the deposit.  It is anticipated that the current 3D lithological and/or structural models 
will be updated to incorporate the results of any additional exploration drilling and/or an improved understanding of the 
deposit geology.  

Additional data requirements to be obtained through future site investigations (e.g., drilling, surface mapping, 
hydrogeological testing, laboratory testing, etc.) include: 

 Characterization of the engineering properties of the Scoria through a focussed drilling program and/or the 
excavation of test trenches in the slopes of the cinder cone.  

 Definition of the relative extents of the Scoria and Basalt through additional exploration/infill or geotechnical 
drilling, potentially supplemented by geophysical investigations. 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
   158 

 Confirmation of the lithologies and structures present behind the North wall of the Abundancia pit through 
additional exploration/infill drilling.  The geological and structural models are currently extrapolated in this 
area.  

 Additional characterization of the rock masses in the Northeast, East, Central (West), Southeast, West (South) 
and West (North) sectors where potential stability concerns have been identified.  In these cases, 
the achievable pit slope geometry is sensitive to the discontinuity properties (persistence, spacing, strength 
and orientation).   

 Additional characterization of the DB1_ENE_Fault, including defining the spatial extents and significance of 
its zone of influence. 

Any further infill drilling at the Deposit should be reviewed for opportunities to provide additional information on the 
deposit rock masses and large-scale structures.  Stripping and the initial stages of mining will also present opportunities 
for the collection of additional information. 

The domain definition, stability analyses and slope recommendations should be updated to account for the results of 
the recommended site investigations and any changes to the geological models, large-scale structural interpretations 
and/or pit wall geometry.  Additional analyses are also recommended to advance the slope recommendations to 
support detailed design.  These analyses include: 

 Further consideration of joint persistence and spacing and their influence on the results of the stability 
analyses 

 Developing slope recommendations for the Scoria 
 Reviewing the stability and configuration of the interim pit designs 

The feasibility level recommendations have only been provided for the Abundancia pit. Geomechanical and 
hydrogeological site investigations, along with the associated analyses, will be required to advance the preliminary 
slope recommendations for the satellite pits to a similar level of design.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

The results of metallurgical testing have indicated that conventional cyanide leaching technology can be used to 
recover silver and gold from the Project feed material.  The design basis for the feed processing facility is 10,000 dry 
metric tonnes per day (dtpd) or 3.65 million dry metric tonnes per year (dtpy).  It is contemplated that feed will be 
transported from the mine to the concentrator facility by off-highway haulage trucks.  The mineralized material would 
then be processed to produce silver and gold doré that would be loaded onto highway haul trucks and transported to 
a metal refinery.   

The proposed process operations are summarized as follows: 

 Crushing of the feed by primary jaw crusher to reduce the feed size from run of mine to minus 152 mm.   
 Stockpiling primary crushed feed in a coarse feed stockpile and then reclaiming by feeders and conveyor belt.   
 Grinding feed in a SAG mill / ball mill circuit prior to processing in a cyanide leach circuit.  The SAG mill will 

operate in closed circuit with a vibrating screen.  Crushed pebbles will be stacked on the ground for return to 
the SAG mill.  The ball mill will operate in closed circuit with a hydro-cyclone to produce the desired grinding 
product size distribution of 80% (P80) passing 74 microns.   

 Leaching of the slurry at 40% solids by weight with cyanide solution in agitated leach tanks to dissolve the 
silver and gold contained in the slurry.   

 Recovering soluble silver and gold using multi-stage counter current decantation technology (CCD).  Barren 
solution will be added in the final CCD thickener as the washing solution. 

 Clarifying of the pregnant solution followed by adding zinc dust to the solution to obtain a precipitate containing 
the recovered precious metals. 

 Filtering and batch smelting of the precipitate to produce a silver and gold doré.   
 Thickening of the leached tailing slurry and the recovery of the cyanide solution before detoxifying the 

thickened tailing slurry using oxygen and sulfur, with copper sulfate as a catalyst, prior to disposal in a tailings 
pond.   

 Recycling water from the tailing pond for re-use in the process plant.  Plant water stream types include barren 
solution, reclaim solution, fresh water, and potable water.   

 Storing, preparing, and distributing reagents to be used in the process.   

The overall process flow sheet is shown in Figure 17-1.  Reagents to be used in the process and other main process 
consumable items are listed in Table 17-1 and the general design criteria used for equipment selection are identified 
in Table 17-2.

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

18.1 FACILITY LAYOUT 

The main processing facilities for the Project are to be located in a compact arrangement to limit the amount of required 
earthworks. These facilities are shown in Figure 18-1 and include primary crushing, grinding, leaching, CCD thickeners, 
Merrill-Crowe processing, and refining facilities.   

In addition to the main process facilities, it is contemplated that there will be several surface buildings constructed to 
support the mining and process operations. These facilities include administration, guardhouse, truck shop, warehouse, 
change house, explosives storage buildings, and truck wash and mill maintenance facilities.

18.2 ACCESS TO SITE 

The Project is located 85 km by road northeast of Durango and can be accessed by vehicle in approximately 90 
minutes.  Figure 18-1 shows the primary access by Mexican Federal Highway Route 40, an excellent all weather 
asphalt road connecting two major cities of Torreon to the Northwest, and Durango to the Southwest. 

A new access road and utility corridor has been anticipated for the site, and is shown on Figure 18-2.  This road will 
connect to the site from an existing exit off of Mexican Federal Highway Route 40 at the exit to the community of 
Vicente Suarez.  This mine access road will use a portion of the existing community road and then deviate from that 
road to take a more direct route to the mine.  Total road to be constructed is ~14 km of which ~12.5 km will be new 
construction and 1.1 km of the existing road will be improved.  The final road will be about 65 km from Durango to the 
mine. 

Due to heavy transport to the site during construction, the road is anticipated to be 10 m wide of driving surface, 
consisting of improved and compacted gravel, with drainage ditches.  With exception of replacement or by-pass of one 
existing bridge on the portion of the existing road to Vicente Suarez, the remaining arroyo crossings are assumed to 
be "low water" crossings with concrete base. 

Costs for this road are estimated to be $1.1 million.

18.3 COMMUNICATIONS 

The site is currently equipped with a radio communications tower that belongs to the Project and has radio capacity to 
communicate back to the town of Durango. This radio tower was constructed by prior owners and consists of a 
dedicated 34.5-m high fenced tower operated by solar power, with multi frequency and repeater capacity. There is a 
second tower located on the roof of the Durango Coeur office building to assure 2-way communications to the site. 

Costs for an internet and phone communications network were defined for the site and anticipate the construction of 
relay towers and a system of up to 30 Mbps can be constructed between the site and Durango for a cost of 
approximately US$135,000. 

18.4 POWER 

18.4.1 Power Supply and Regulatory Framework 

According to the Mexican Secretary of Energy (SENER), Mexico had 53.5 gigawatts (GW) of effective generation 
capacity in 2013. Over three-quarters of power generation in Mexico is supplied by fossil fuels with natural gas thermal 
plants providing the largest component of power generation among the fossil fuels group (oil, natural gas, coal).  
Hydroelectricity represented 22% of installed capacity and provided 11% of energy in 2013 with production being highly 
dependent on annual rainfall.  Non-hydro renewables (wind, solar, geothermal, biofuels) account for approximately 3% 
of power generation, and the country's sole nuclear power plant, Laguna Verde, has an installed capacity of 1.6 GW 
and contributes the remaining ~10% of generation in Mexico.  Recently, through government support initiatives, Mexico 
is poised to become one of the fastest growing wind energy producers, with plans to add 3 GW of installed capacity by 
2020. 

 
Source: Pace Global (June 2014) 

Figure 18-4: 2013 Mexico Power Generation Capacity 

The state-owned utility, CFE, is the dominant player in the power sector, controlling over three-quarters of the country's 
installed generating capacity and controls all transmission and distribution of electricity in Mexico.  In addition to the 
Public Sector (CFE), 29 units totaling 13 GW are owned by Independent Power Producers (IPPs).  33% of power 
generation in Mexico was from private entities as of 2013.

Mexico's electric power sector was partially liberalized in 1992-1993.  The Energy Reform 2013 was published the 21st 
of December, 2013, and focuses on changes to Articles 27 and 28 of the Constitution with the following objectives: 

 To reduce system costs and make headroom to lower the CFE tariffs  
 To add renewable generation in large amounts to meet the legal regulations of the Climate Change and 

Renewable Laws  

Article 27 is to be modified to create a competitive generation (capacity + energy) market and an Independent System 
Operator (ISO) to dispatch the fleet.  The State maintains control of the power sector and ownership and operation of 
the transmission and distribution infrastructure through CFE, who will also be able to compete in the wholesale market.  
The below graphic illustrates the changes this Reform will have on the previous Mexican power market model.

Figure 18-5: Changes to the Mexican Power Market by the New Energy Reforms 

The primary differentiators between the "Old" and "New" models are: 

 PEMEX (state-owned petroleum company and natural gas supplier) and CFE will become "State Productive 
Entities" – commercially-oriented organizations coupled with subsequent tax reform that will allow them to 
operate on a for-profit basis and reinvest in its projects, rather than operating as a revenue unit of the federal 
government. 

 National Center for Energy Control (CENACE) – will be an independent entity which controls the operations 
of the national electricity system and the electricity wholesale market. 

 Private parties may participate with appropriate permits. 
 Private parties may take part via contracts exclusively with CFE with no concessions issued. 

Mexico's Congress will be reviewing and voting on the proposed secondary energy reform laws starting in June 2014, 
which further define the legislative detail governing the Reform and the final step towards passage of the law.  This 
could result in a blackout period that could last as long as two years until the final regulations are passed.9   

 

9 It is important for all potential applicants for self-supply agreements applying under the existing scheme to initiate agreements before the laws are signed to avoid 
any permitting delays that may result from a potential blackout period.

18.4.2 Power Market Considerations 

 Options to Commercially Available Power 

Purchase Power from the CFE 

CFE is a state-owned company which generates, transmits, and distributes electricity across Mexico.  The grid, which 
is owned, operated, and maintained by CFE, stretches across the country, interconnecting all of Mexico with the 
exception of Baja California.  CFE controls roughly 85% of all generation in Mexico.  

CFE electricity rates are published tariffs, set by SENER.  CFE offers two basic types of tariffs:  1) specific use tariffs, 
and 2) general tariffs.  Specific tariffs are set for designated user types: residential, public service, agricultural, and 
temporary.  General tariffs are set by voltage and region.  All tariffs offered by CFE are full service, which include 
capacity, energy, transmission, and delivery services.  Most medium voltage and all high voltage tariffs are time-of-use 
rates, with energy charges that vary by hour and season.  All CFE tariffs are adjusted monthly to reflect changes in the 
cost of generation. 

 
Source: Pace Global 

Figure 18-6: CFE Tariff Adjustment Methodology for High Voltage Users 

If the Project maintains its current plan to interconnect to the CFE transmission grid at 230 kV, the applicable tariff will 
be the H-T tariff for the North region.  Based on a 90% load factor, the cost of CFE electricity in May 2014 would have 
been $108/MWh. 

Purchase from Third Party via Self-Supply 

Through the 1992-3 reform, a regulatory law permits private investment in specific types of generation such as IPPs 
and self-supply generation or cogeneration.  IPP projects are private power projects which are developed exclusively 
to serve CFE load under long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).  Self-supply projects are private power 
projects in which all the off-takers are shareholders, which enable sale of power directly to end-users.

Figure 18-7: Self-Supply Projects Are Not Required to Be On-Site 

Self-supply projects must receive permits from CFE and CRE in order to interconnect and operate on the transmission 
grid.  Once approved, CFE is obligated to receive the power at the point of interconnection for the power plant and 
deliver the power to the load point(s).  Typically, these projects are constructed only after PPAs are signed with the off-
takers, which provide the banks the certainty they require to finance the project.  The timeline for self-supply projects 
can range from one to three years, depending on project complexity and development progress.  In addition to the 
PPA, three other contracts are required between the power project and CFE. 

Table 18-1: Contracts Required for a Self-Supply Project 

Interconnection 
Agreement 

Sets the terms and conditions of the project interconnect to CFE's grid, describes location of 
injection and cascade schedule of the project's delivery points, metering equipment, invoicing and 
arbitration procedures. 

Back-up Agreement 
Sets the procedures, cost, metering, etc. by which CFE will provide back-up service and energy to 
the self-supply project (both for planned and forced outages). 

Wheeling Agreement 
Sets the procedures, cost, metering, etc. by which CFE will transport the electricity from the 
interconnection point to the load nodes of the consumer. Several wheeling options available: 5-yr 
renewable for normal and minimal charges, hedging option for normal and minimal charges.

Current self-supply indicative pricing offers received show significant potential savings when compared to normal CFE 
high voltage tariffs.  Below is a list of indicative pricing offers received for the Project.  Prices are based on "all-in" cost, 
inclusive of any back-up and/or supplemental power required from CFE.  The pricing structures offered fell into three 
categories: 

1. "Cost Plus" – fixed monthly capacity charge + variable energy charge + transmission + back-up.  Vendor's 
margin is typically included in the fixed capacity charge to achieve a certain return on investment in the asset.  

2. Fixed Discount to CFE – a fixed percentage discount off the prevailing CFE H-S tariff 
3. Fixed Price – fixed price of energy (minimum contract volume applies), escalating with inflation 

A detailed analysis based on the prices quoted by six IPP's in formal proposals, indicates that power costs can range 
from a low of US$83/MWh to US$104/MWh and represent an "all-in" price including transportation charges.  The pricing

and fee structures were presented under confidentiality agreements by several vendors, so specifics are not disclosed 
in this document. A comparable cost for power acquired from CFE is US$112/MWh. 

Purchase Power from Third Party via On-Site Generation 

Self-supply regulations also permit on-site generation.  In many cases, large industrials prefer not to focus on owning 
and operating power plants as it is outside of their core business and expertise.  Instead, a self-supply project can be 
established on-site with a third-party developer who will finance, construct, own, and operate the plant, selling electricity 
to the industrial.  Candidate sites for on-site generation require ready access to firm natural gas supply, water, and, in 
many cases, will rely on CFE grid interconnection for back-up power.  If electrical grid interconnection is unfeasible or 
uneconomical, additional back-up capacity should be installed on-site to provide power during periods of scheduled or 
forced outages of generation units. 

The Property location, northeast of Durango, is limited in its ability to secure firm pipeline natural gas supply due to the 
unavailability of firm capacity in the nearby pipeline.  Other options for natural gas delivery, including Compressed 
Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), could provide firm gas supply, but would result in an all-in power 
cost that exceed published CFE tariffs for electricity. 

 Pemex Natural Gas Pipeline 

Availability 

Mexico's state owned gas producer and supplier, PEMEX, owns and operates the bulk of the natural gas transmission 
infrastructure.  Mexico currently imports 25% of its gas supply via pipeline from the U.S., primarily through south Texas.  
The rest of the natural gas is supplied from domestic production and 9% from LNG, imported through Manzanillo.  La 
Preciosa is located near the end of PEMEX's 16" diameter pipeline which supplies all loads south of the Chavez 
compression station (between Torreon and Durango).

Figure 18-8: Map of Existing Natural Gas Pipelines 

According to PEMEX officials, that particular section of pipe is highly constrained.  The pipe has a total capacity of 92 
million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) and currently serves the following loads: 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128

  172 

 Norte I – power plant (firm capacity) 
 Biopapel – paper mill 
 Energas – currently produces/sells CNG  
 Ecogas – local gas distributor in Durango (firm capacity) 

There is no firm capacity available in the pipe at this time. Compression station upgrades could increase the firm 
capacity available on the Torreon-Durango pipeline, but Coeur would likely be the entity responsible for bearing the 
cost of these upgrades.  The upgrades would increase capacity well beyond the needs for the Project, which would 
require coordinating partners (other gas users) to share in the expense of the upgrades, which would add to the 
development timeline and increase project complexity and risk.  As an alternative, it is possible that a gas storage 
solution at the mine site could be used to convert the existing interruptible gas supply to firm/semi-firm service, though 
the option would carry its own risks and associated costs, including potential interconnections of new gas off-takers or 
increases in usage from existing users.   

Pricing 

Natural gas prices in Mexico are regulated by the CRE and are set by PEMEX based on the cost of imported gas from 
south Texas at Reynosa.  First-hand gas sales are based on five distinct regions: Norte, Golfo, Occidente, Centro, and 
Sur.  In addition to the zonal charges, all first-hand sales include an LNG premium which essentially socializes the 
higher cost of LNG imports across all gas users in Mexico.  Under the energy reform, private participation in the natural 
gas Exploration & Production (E&P) and transportation will be allowed.  This change will likely impact natural gas 
pricing structure across Mexico.

Natural Gas Price Forecast to Torreon
Henry Hub 2012$/MMBtu Reynosa 2012$/MMBtu Delivered Torreon

Figure 18-10: Historical and Forecasted Natural Gas Prices Delivered to Torreon 

First-hand gas sales price formula uses a netback methodology from South Texas to determine the monthly and daily 
gas index prices at Reynosa and the PEMEX gas processing site located near Tabasco.  To calculate the regional gas 
prices, the CRE issues postage transportation tariffs.  Prices account for the gas commodity, transportation, service 
and distribution.  Exhibit 12 above shows the calculated price of natural gas, delivered to Torreon based on this 
methodology and forecasted through 203510.  As shown in the chart, prices to Torreon are expected to soften in the 
near term to US$5.20 per MMBtu11 in 2015 then increasing as high as US$6.70 per MMBtu by 2020. 

Offsite Power Generation Utilizing Natural Gas 

Because of limited pipeline capacity, an alternative, offsite option considered is power produced upstream of the 
Durango pipeline (for example at Torreon), and wheeled via transmission lines to the mine site was also considered 
as an option. 

Pemex has confirmed the ability to deliver gas to the Project via Durango pipeline; but firm service would require 
multiple compression upgrades upstream from the power generating station, at a cost yet to be confirmed, but likely in 
excess of US$100 million. 

18.4.3 Grid Capabilities 

Near the mine site at about 21 km to the south east there is an existing power plant, natural gas fired combined cycle, 
owned by Union Fenosa. This power plant is capable of generating 450 MW, 400MW are committed and delivered to 
CFE via a 230 kV substation and its associated power lines. Besides the above mentioned power plant, the state of 
Durango is interconnected with CFE's national grid via their 230kV power lines. 

The 230 kV line supplied by Union Fenosa passes within a straight line distance of about 9km from the mine site, 
roughly parallel to Route 40. Also, there is a 115 kV line at the same location and distance from the mine site.  According

to CFE however, power is not available from this line because the conductors are too small and have insufficient 
capacity to supply mine power requirements. 

A 115kV line at the village of Canatlán, at a distance of 42km from the mine site has sufficient capacity to provide for 
the mine's requirements. 

18.4.4 Project Transmission Line 

Three route options have been considered for this study: 

1. CFE has proposed to provide power from the future Canatlán Potencia substation located about 42 km west-
northwest from the site, Canatlán Potencia substation is planned to have a capacity of 100MW, and will step-
down voltage level from 230 kV to 115 kV, from the substation a 42 km long, 115kV transmission line will feed 
the Project.  A 115 kV power line could be constructed in wood poles or steel towers as favored by CFE with 
a 477 kCMIL size, ACSR-type conductor.  CFE offered to build the transmission line in 34 months, including 
the new Canatlán Potencia substation.  It is typical for mining projects for the client, or their contractor, to build 
the transmission lines and related substations and then turn them over to CFE for their operation and 
maintenance. The construction of any infrastructure that needs to be turned over to CFE, switching substation 
and transmission line will need to be inspected and accepted by CFE technical personnel during and after 
construction and commissioning of the facilities.  

2. There is an existing 115 kV power line at a distance of about 9 km from the mine site.  It is currently providing 
power to the city of Guadalupe Victoria. This option would require construction of a new branch, running to 
the mine site at a length of about 11 km.  The power line does not have sufficient capacity to provide the 
power required by the mine, connecting to this power line it is not feasible since it does not have excess power 
capacity.  

3. The 230 kV power line connected to the national grid is located at a distance of about 9 km from the mine 
site.  Construction of a branch line with a length of about 11 km will be required.  Positive discussions are 
continuing with CFE.  This option will also require construction of a new switching substation nearby route 40.  
The new 230 kV transmission line to the Project will follow the Project new access road to the north.  The line 
will need to be designed and constructed on steel tower with a minimum ACSR conductor size of 1113 circular 
mils (kcmil).  Following the same logic as indicated in the first option, CFE may allow for a credit for the cost 
of construction to be applied against the rate in future billings. 

Option 3 is preferred due to shortened construction, potentially lower capital cost, and lessened right of way (ROW) 
acquisition issues.  Engineering could start once CFE approves final connection point and route is defined, design 
specifications and requirements will be based on CFE normalized standards based on substations and transmission 
line voltages.

ROW acquisition and other indirect cost of constructing a new power line are not included in the above noted estimates. 

18.4.6 Site Power Distribution 

 Substation and step down transformers  

The Substation will consist of two 30 MVA 230 kV to 13.2 kV power transformers.  Each transformer is sufficient to 
power the entire plant load allowing one transformer to be taken down for maintenance at any given time without 
affecting the plant operations.  Step-down transformers from 13.2 kV to 4160V or 480V will be located at the individual 
process areas. 

 Site-wide power distribution 

Site power distribution will be at 13.2 kV and will consist of both underground distribution and overhead lines.  
Underground distribution will be used to supply power to the main process areas near the substation while overhead 
lines will be used to provide power to the outlying areas such as primary crushing, stockpile, water tanks, and tailing.  
Wells and well water booster pumps will be fed by a 34.5 kV overhead line from a 13.2 kV-34.5 kV step-up transformer 
in the main substation. 

18.4.7 Auxiliary Generating Capacity 

Two 1000 KW generators will be located in the Project Substation to provide emergency power to critical loads. 

18.5 WATER 

A water source for the Project has been located in the Valle de Guadiana aquifer, and two wells were drilled to supply 
the anticipated ~80 liter per second (L/s) of plant and mine demand.  Those two wells were drilled on farm land and all 
agreements are in place with the land-owners for the use of the land.  Water rights have been obtained from the 
government agency CONAGUA or are in the process of being obtained. 

Power for the two wells is anticipated to cost approximately US$180k and consist of extension of existing power lines 
that go to Vicente Suarez and also service other agricultural wells in the area. This will include posts, wire, transformers 
and control for the primary well pumps and the booster pumps. 

A booster tank will be located so as to serve both the existing wells with an installation of two in-line booster pumps 
such that water can be pumped directly to the site. 

Water pipeline design from the well booster tank to the site will cross easements with local landowners and the Vicente 
Suarez Ejido and will be constructed of steel in the lower portion and HDPE in the upper portion as pressure 
requirements drop.

A review of local mine dewatering needs, performed by KP, indicates that the processing plant will require use of the 
wells for water in the initial operation of the mine but that mine dewatering may be able to provide all required plant 
water in mid to late mine life. 

18.6 TAILING STORAGE FACILITY 

KP completed a feasibility level design for the TSF for the Project (KP, 2014).  The TSF will provide permanent and 
secure tailings storage, in addition to water storage and control to ensure protection of the environment during 
operations and in the long-term (after closure).  The design has been carried out based on the preferred TSF option 
as provided by Coeur.   

The TSF site lies to the southwest of the proposed open pit and process plant.  The ultimate configuration of the TSF 
is shown on Figure 18-11 with respect to the overall site layout.

18.6.1 Design Basis Overview 

The principal objective of the TSF design is to provide tailings and water storage, ensure protection of the environment 
during operations and following closure, and to achieve effective reclamation at mine closure.  The feasibility design of 
the TSF has taken into account the following requirements: 

 Permanent, safe and secure long-term management of tailings and water 
 Control, collection and decant of free draining water from the tailings during operations, for recycling as 

process water to the maximum extent practical 
 The inclusion of appropriate monitoring strategies for all elements of the facility to ensure performance goals 

are achieved and that the design criteria and assumptions are met over the mine life 
 Secure reclamation and closure of the impoundment after mining is complete 

Embankment stability and design storm events chosen for the TSF are based on relevant criteria including Mexican 
standards (i.e. SEMARNAT NOM-141 Standards (2004)) and the guidelines of the Canadian Dam Association (CDA, 
2007), including the following: 

 Environmental Design Storm: 1 in 25 yr., 24-hour storm event 
 Inflow Design Flood: 1/3 between 1/1000 and PMF, 24-hour storm event  
 Minimum Freeboard Allowance:  Site plots in "Humid Zone". Minimum freeboard is 2 m 
 Maximum Design Earthquake: 1 in 2,500 year (0.045 g) 

The feasibility study design for the TSF is based on a projected 17-y mine life at a processing rate of approximately 
10,000 dtpd. The size is due to performing the design work in parallel with mine engineering work.  The life of mine 
storage capacity is 59.12 Mt in this design. 

18.6.2 Tailings Physical Properties 

Tailings samples were produced and subjected to geotechnical testing (KP, 2014).  Based on this test work, the 
following tailings properties have been adopted for the feasibility design: 

 Specific Gravity:  2.77 
 Approximate Grain Size:  81.7% passing 74 µm (No. 200 sieve); SILT (69%), some sand (18%), some 

clay (13%) 
 Average Settled Dry Density:  1.3 t/m3 

18.6.3 Tailings Management 

The TSF includes the lined tailings basin for settlement of solids and supernatant water storage.  Two (2) embankments 
will be constructed to establish the TSF, including a main embankment along the south side of the basin and a smaller 
embankment constructed later at the north side of the basin.  Natural topographical containment will form the northeast 
and west sides of the TSF.  

Tailings at 50% solids content (approximately, by weight) will be delivered via pump and pipeline from the plant site for 
storage at the TSF. Tailings will be deposited sub-aerially using multiple spigot offtakes at regular spaced intervals 
starting in the southwest corner and cycling around the south, east and north sides of the facility.  Perimeter discharge 
from the embankments and natural topography will maintain the supernatant pond near the central west side of the 
tailings basin away from the embankments.   



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
  179 

The TSF has been sized to permanently store approximately 45.5 million m3 of tailings at an average settled dry density 
of 1.3 t/m³.   

18.6.4 Water Management 

The Project is located where water resources are scarce and water supply can be expensive.  In addition to minimizing 
the downstream impacts of the facility on the environment, the primary water management objective for the TSF is to 
collect all available water for re-use in the process in order to minimize make-up water requirements. 

Supernatant water will be removed from the TSF via a decant tower system.  Water recovered from the decant system 
will be pumped back to the plant for re-use in the process circuits.  The operating pond will be maintained at the 
minimum volume required to provide adequate clarification prior to reclaim.   

The design incorporates a tailings underdrain collection system comprising a series of perforated drainage pipes over 
the TSF basin floor.  Free water draining from the tailings mass will be collected by the underdrain collection system 
and will report to reinforced concrete collection towers located upstream of the south embankment toe.  Submersible 
pumps installed within these towers will return the water to the supernatant pond. 

A monthly operational water balance was completed for the TSF and the results indicate that the TSF will operate at a 
net water deficit during all years of operations.  Only a portion of the process water requirements can be satisfied by 
water reclaimed from the TSF.  Additional make-up water, from other sources, is required in all years of operation.   

In addition to strategic tailing deposition and minimizing operating pond size, a number of seepage reduction strategies 
have been incorporated into the design and operation of the facility, including the installation of the liner and underdrain 
collection system to collect any available free water above the liner.  Additionally, seepage collection drains will be 
installed along the base of the south embankment.     

Discharge from the embankments and basin perimeter will maintain the supernatant pond near the central west side 
of the tailings basin away from the embankments.  A water reclaim system will maintain the pond with limited size.  
Under these conditions sufficient storage capacity will be provided within the TSF to store any tailings supernatant 
water, run off and the design storm events, in addition to an allowance for freeboard.  Embankment construction will 
be staged and the construction schedule will ensure that there is always sufficient storage capacity available in the 
facility to avoid overtopping and negate the need for interim spillways for each embankment stage. 

During the final year of operation, the supernatant pond will be 'pushed' toward the southwest corner of the facility by 
depositing tailings primarily from the east-northeast side of the facility.  The closure spillway will be constructed as part 
of the last embankment stage, prior to closure, and will be designed to provide long-term passive water management 
for the closed facility.  The permanent spillway will be constructed in such a manner as to allow rainfall run off from the 
surface of the rehabilitated facility to flow into the surrounding natural drainage system.  The spillway has been sized 
to safely pass run off from the TSF catchment resulting from rainfall events up to and including the PMP. 

18.6.5 Facility Construction 

The TSF design section will include an initial starter embankment (Stage 1) for the south embankment with ongoing 
raises completed for the south and north embankments using centerline construction methods throughout the life of 
the facility.  The initial starter embankment at the south, will be constructed of zoned rockfill with a composite liner on 
the upstream slope.  The centerline raises will consist of zoned rockfill with a low permeability core zone.  Transition 
zones will be established between the core zone and the embankment rockfill to ensure internal stability.  The Stage 1 
TSF will provide storage for two (2) years of tailings deposition.  Construction of the north embankment will not be 
required until Year 9 of operations.  The embankments will be extended and raised using rockfill from the mine over 
the life of the facility. 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128

  180 

The design includes a composite liner consisting of a 60 mil HDPE geomembrane overlying a low permeability soil 
layer placed on the upstream slope of the starter embankment and over the entire basin footprint.   

Design analyses completed for the dams, included seepage and stability analyses. 

18.6.6 Monitoring 

Monitoring of TSF operations will be active and ongoing to ensure optimum performance and allow refinement of the 
operation, as necessary.  The achieved density of the tailings will be dependent on the tailings deposition practices 
and supernatant pond configuration.  Field information on the in situ tailings densities will be collected during the initial 
months of operations for comparison with the design values.  This information will allow further optimization of the 
tailings deposition strategy and water balance model, adjustments to the pond operating levels and, if necessary 
refinement to ongoing operations and future design.  Other performance monitoring items include: groundwater 
monitoring well sampling and testing, analyzing piezometer levels, analyzing settlement gauge data, monitoring 
movement monuments, completing embankment surveys, water flow measurements. 

18.7 SURFACE GEOTECHNICAL 

Geotechnical investigations were completed by KP in 2014 to support the feasibility designs for the Project surface 
infrastructure. The detailed results of the geotechnical site investigations are summarized in KP's geotechnical 
investigation report (KP, 2014b).  

The focus of the 2014 geotechnical site investigation program was to characterize the general soil and bedrock 
conditions within the vicinity of the proposed Plant Site and TSF. 

18.7.1 Investigation Methods 

The completed site investigations consisted of geotechnical drilling (soils and bedrock), test pit excavation, collection 
of representative samples, geotechnical logging, geomechanical logging, in situ testing and laboratory index testing.  

 Geotechnical Drilling 

A total of 17 vertical drillholes were completed to depths ranging from 11.8 m to 37.30 m, with an average depth of 
22.3 m.  One additional drillhole with an azimuth of 90o and a dip of 50o was completed to a length of 185.3 m to 
evaluate if hydrogeological conditions and/or geologic structures are present that could convey seepage from the TSF 
to the Open Pit.   

The geotechnical drilling, sampling and in situ testing was completed by Major using a diamond drill rig equipped with 
HQ3 diameter drill rods.   

Each drillhole was advanced through the overburden by augering or coring and sampling via SPT until refusal.  
Advancement in bedrock was accomplished by casing and coring. The casing was advanced through the overburden 
and seated in the bedrock and the rock cored using an HQ3-diameter drill bit. 

 Test Pit Excavation 

A total of 24 test pits were excavated during the site investigation program.  Test pits varied in depth from 0.0 m 
(bedrock at surface) to 3.8 m (the maximum reach of the backhoe), with an average depth of approximately 2.0 m.   



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
  181 

Test pits were excavated using a CAT 430E backhoe supplied and operated by Coeur.  The excavation was advanced 
until refusal due to bedrock or the limits of the backhoe power and/or reach.  The test pits were logged, sampled, and 
photographed prior to being backfilled.   

 Overburden Logging 

Logging, sampling and testing of the overburden was undertaken in accordance with the Canadian Foundation 
Engineering Manual (Canadian Geotechnical Society, 2006) and the Standard Practice for Description Identification of 
Soils (ASTM, 2009).   

Approximately 166 m of overburden in the proposed Plant Site and TSF areas was drilled or test pitted and 
characterized. The overburden was logged and photographed in the field as the samples 
were recovered (factual logging) from the drill core tube, split spoon or test pit walls.   

Only samples considered to be representative of the in situ conditions were collected.  Representative samples were 
placed in double plastic bags, sealed and labelled in preparation for future testing at a Mexican soils laboratory.   

 Bedrock Logging 

Recovered bedrock drill core was placed in core boxes and labeled (drillhole identification, run identification and 
depths).  KP personnel were present during bedrock drilling activities. 

Bedrock core logging included estimates of key intact rock and discontinuity characteristics.  The logging results were 
used to estimate the quality of the encountered rock masses using the Rock Mass Rating (RMR89) system (Bienawski, 
1989).  Rock mass characteristics were collected to support foundation design.   

Approximately 263 m of bedrock was logged.  The assigned lithologies are based on field descriptions and consultation 
with the Coeur geologists. 

 Standard Penetration Tests (SPTs) 

SPTs were conducted within the overburden in all drillholes at an interval of approximately 0.75 m (2.5 ft.) starting from 
surface.  The tests were completed in order to obtain relative density information and allow for collection of 
representative samples.  The SPT tests were completed using a standard manual hammer and a standard split spoon 
sampler.  The "standard penetration resistance" or the "N" value, reported in blows/foot was recorded during each test.   

 Packer Hydraulic Conductivity Testing 

Hydraulic conductivity testing was completed using packers within the bedrock in the TSF drillholes.  The packer testing 
was conducted by Major under the direction of KP personnel, using nitrogen or hydraulic inflatable packers.  The tests 
were performed using the Lugeon or constant head method, typically isolating the bedrock zone as the drillhole was 
advanced.  Note, groundwater was not encountered in any of the geotechnical drillholes and the packer testing was 
completed above the groundwater table, as such, these conductivities are relative estimates only and cannot be directly 
compared to conductivities measured below the groundwater table. 

 Laboratory Index Testing 

Laboratory index testing was completed on select overburden samples from the drillholes and test pits.  The purpose 
of the testing was to confirm general soil characteristics and to classify the various overburden materials encountered.  
Laboratory testing of the overburden was completed by Ingeniería Geotécnica del Norte, S.A. de C.V., in Durango, 
Mexico.  The Laboratory test work included the following:

 Natural Moisture Content (ASTM D2216-10, 2010a) 
 Particle Size Analysis of Soils using Sieve and Hydrometer (ASTM D422-63, 2007) 
 Atterberg Limits (ASTM D4318-10, 2010b) 

18.7.2 Site Investigation Results 

A total of 18 drillholes and 24 test pits were completed to characterize the overburden and near surface bedrock 
conditions at the proposed Plant Site and TSF locations.   

The following paragraphs provide a brief summary of the geotechnical site investigations findings. 

Plant Site - A total of five drillholes and eight test pits were completed in the Plant Site area in order to evaluate the 
foundation conditions and to characterize the overburden and near surface bedrock.  Main observations included: 

 The depth to bedrock was relatively deep and typically ranged from 15 m to 20 m.  The depth to bedrock at 
one drillhole location was shallow at 4 m. 

 The overburden encountered in the area was generally found to comprise of nominal surficial layer of organic 
silt underlain by sand, with varying amounts of clay or gravel overlying bedrock.  All of the soil samples 
collected from the Plant Site area, except for one, exhibited plasticity with plasticity index values ranging from 
9.4% to 26.2%. 

 Bedrock underlying the overburden at the Plant Site mainly consisted of andesite which ranged in quality from 
POOR to FAIR.  Basalt was encountered at one drillhole location. 

Tailings Storage Facility - A total of 12 drillholes and 16 test pits were completed in the TSF area in order to 
characterize the overburden and near-surface bedrock and evaluate the shallow bedrock hydraulic conductivity.  Main 
observations included: 

 The depth to bedrock was shallow (i.e. less than 5 m) in all the drillholes except on the west side of the TSF, 
where up to 15.5 m of overburden was locally encountered.  

 The overburden encountered in the TSF area generally consisted of a nominal surficial layer of organic silt 
underlain by sand, with varying amounts of clay or gravel overlying bedrock.  All of the soil samples collected 
from the TSF area exhibited plasticity, with plasticity index values ranging from 8.4% to 31%. 

 The bedrock consisted of basaltic flows with a well-developed vesicular structure, dense basalt with a weak 
to moderately developed vesicular structure, scoria and andesite.  The encountered rock mass qualities 
typically ranged from POOR to FAIR.   

 A total of 23 packer tests were performed at 12 drillhole locations.  Hydraulic conductivity values were 
generally high especially within the shallow bedrock.  This likely is attributed to the well-developed vesicular 
structure in the basalt, broken and rubble zones.  A small area in the southwest corner of the TSF that is 
underlain by andesite exhibited relatively low hydraulic conductivities.  Intervals with no recovered bedrock 
core were encountered in drillholes at the north end of the facility potentially indicating the presence of a lava 
tube or similar structure (void).   

Geologic Structure between TSF and Open Pit - One deeper, inclined drillhole was advanced into bedrock within 
the northern area of the TSF to evaluate if the hydrogeological conditions and/or geologic structures were present that 
could convey seepage from the TSF to the Open Pit.  Main observations included: 

 Five possible faults were identified in this drillhole with consistent north-south or northeast-southwest striking 
fault orientations similar to the fault orientations identified in the area of the Open Pits. Faults with these 
orientations could represent a potential conduit for seepage between the TSF and the Open Pit.

 The measured hydraulic conductivity of the encountered faults was generally one to two orders of magnitude 
higher than the deep host rock, but several orders of magnitude lower than the shallow bedrock.  Given the 
expected hydraulic conductivities, it is likely any seepage from the TSF will flow through the highly permeable 
shallow vesicular basalt and not be conveyed to the Open Pit via any specific geologic structure. 

18.7.3 Future Investigations 

Additional site investigations are recommended to provide supporting data for future design studies.  Any previously 
uninvestigated, new or modified infrastructure locations should also be investigated to provide the required data.  The 
proposed site investigations may include the following: 

 Completing test pits and drilling for the Waste Rock Dumps, Low Grade Ore Stockpile, the scoria deposit 
forming the North walls of the Abundancia pit and any other ancillary facilities associated with the Project to 
confirm subsurface foundation conditions and design assumptions. 

 Completing the additional investigations needed to evaluate potential construction materials and borrow 
sources. Borrow material will be necessary for site grading, embankment construction and roads.  Laboratory 
testing of fine grained soils should be performed to assess the suitability for low permeability fill. 

 Completing the additional investigations needed to evaluate foundation conditions, with particular focus on 
the potential for large voids to be present in the near surface bedrock within the TSF basin and below the 
embankments. 

18.8 WATER BALANCE 

A site-wide water balance has been prepared to represent average steady state conditions during the life of mine (SRK, 
2014g). The site-wide water balance summarizes water balance calculations completed for individual work areas (plant 
area, process circuit, mine area, TSF) prepared by Coeur and Coeur's consultants. SRK estimated stormwater run off, 
direct precipitation, and evaporation related to the plant and mine areas. M3 and other Coeur consultants estimated 
the steady state water balance calculations for the process circuit. KP prepared a variable and steady state water 
balance for the TSF (KP, 2014b) and estimated inflows to the Abundancia pit as the pit deepens (KP, 2014c).  

For each identified area, the major water flow rates included stormwater run off, direct precipitation of ponds, well water 
for process circuit, TSF supernatant pond pump-back to reclaim solution tank, potable water needs, dust suppression, 
tailing slurry, entrained water in tailings, TSF seepage, groundwater pit inflow, and evaporation. The estimated water 
usage by area is presented in Table 18-4 and the steady state water balance flow rates are presented in Table 18-5. 

The total average plant area water inflow rate is 81.7 cmh from run off and potable water and the average water outflow 
rate is estimated to be 2.6 cmh due to evaporation and septic leach field discharges to the subsurface. For the process 
circuit, the total average water inflow rate is 535.1 cmh based on well water and TSF reclaim water sources, and the 
total average water outflow rate is estimated to be 469.3 cmh with losses due to fresh water usage at the mine 
administration offices and shops, dust suppression, and TSF discharges. The total average TSF water inflow and 
outflow rates are balanced at 479.2 cmh. The water retained in tailings voids is estimated to be 170.1 cmh, the total 
average evaporation loss is 29.6 cmh, and a small volume of seepage is assumed (1.8 cmh). The total average TSF 
reclaim water, therefore, is 277.7 cmh so that the process circuit will require 138.9 cmh of fresh make-up water. The 
total average mine area water inflow rate is 324.7 cmh basin run off and groundwater, and the total average water 
outflow rate due to evaporation is estimated to be 2 cmh.  

The results from the average steady-state water balance indicate that the Project is a net water user and will rely on 
the make-up water addition pumped from the well field, stormwater run off, and Abundancia Pit dewatering. The water 
balance for the plant area, process circuit, and TSF indicate an estimated water loss of 257.7 cmh. Fresh water demand 
from the water supply wells will be reduced slightly as make-up water from pit dewatering becomes available in

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

19.1 MARKET STUDIES 

The Project will produce silver and gold doré, which will be trucked from the mine site to the refinery. 

Coeur has received quotes for the secure transportation and refining of the silver-gold doré bars produced at the Project 
from parties with whom it has existing business relationships.  Given the project's proximity to Coeur's Palmarejo mine, 
the rates for secure transportation are similar to what Coeur is currently paying its secure transportation provider in the 
region.  The quote included in the financial analysis includes a fixed charge of $14,500 per shipment (up to 7,500 kg) 
plus a liability charge of $0.30 per thousand of amount declared. 

Likewise, the doré bars that will be produced at Project are expected to be similar in grade and purity to those produced 
at Coeur's San Bartolome mine.  As such, the refining charges quoted for the Project's production are similar to those 
currently quoted for the refining of San Bartolome's bars.  Under the proposed contract terms, the refiner will credit the 
refined silver and gold to PMLP's account, at which point it will become available to sell.  Coeur sells its silver and gold 
production on behalf of its subsidiaries on a spot or forward basis, primarily to banks and metal trading houses.  After 
a sale is made, Coeur will send the refiner a bullion transfer order thereby directing the refiner to deliver the sold metal 
to the trade counterparty on the trade settlement date.  The proceeds from said sales will be credited to PMLP's USD 
bank account upon delivery of the refined silver or gold bullion to the counterparty.   

The expected precious metal and trace metal compositions of the doré are shown in Table 19-1 and Table 19-2, 
respectively.  Refining terms include (i) a treatment charge of $0.17/oz based on the net weight of the doré bars 
received by the refinery; (ii) a metal return of 99.7% of recoverable gold; and (iii) 99.92% of recoverable silver.  A 0.5% 
refining loss attributable to melt losses and differences in assays with the refiner was assumed.  This is based on 
Coeur's refiner loss experience at Coeur's San Bartolome mine.  No penalties are expected to be assessed against 
the refining.  The refined silver and gold is expected to be available for Coeur to sell 8 business days after receipt of 
the doré bars by the refinery.

Au 0.13 wt% 

 Table 19-2: Traces 

Fe 0 - 0.1- 0.3 wt%

The estimated doré transportation charges and refining costs used for the financial analysis were based on quotes 
mentioned above. 

Coeur plans to sell the refined silver and gold from the Project primarily to financial institutions, including multi-national 
banks and bullion trading houses.  The markets for both refined silver and gold are highly liquid. 

19.2 CONTRACTS 

There are no established contracts for the sale of the doré currently in place for the Project. Coeur has a number of 
existing agreements with refiners in the United States and Europe.  An agreement for the Project will be negotiated at 
the point the project is deemed to be approaching production.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 

Section 20 describes factors related to the Project and the preliminary results of environmental studies to support the 
permitting activities. The section summarizes the environmental issues identified on site, existing permit status, and 
environmental monitoring that is either in place or planned.  Social and community programs are also discussed. 

20.1 FACTORS RELATED TO THE PROJECT 

This section addresses the general context of Mexican regulations related to mining law, land, environmental protection 
and management, and health and safety programs. 

20.1.1 Mexican Mining Law 

Under the Mexican Constitution Article 27, minerals are part of the national patrimony and are under the jurisdiction of 
the federal government. Mineral exploration and mining in Mexico are regulated by the Mining Law of June 26,1992, 
which established that all minerals found in Mexican territory are owned by the nation and that private parties may 
exploit these minerals (with the exception of oil and nuclear resources) through mining concessions granted by the 
federal government.  

The right to explore for or exploit minerals is granted to private parties, through mining concessions issued by the 
Federal executive branch (Secretaría de Economía). Amendments to the Mining Law in April 2005, and put into effect 
in January 2006, provide for all mining concessions to be valid for a period of 50 years. A concession may be extended 
for an equal period on5 years advance notice prior to expiration and if no other cause for cancellation of the concession 
is evident. Amendments to the Mining Law were most recently approved by the Mexican Senate in October 2013 when 
mining tax reforms were passed, including a 0.5% tax on gross revenues of gold, silver, and platinum mines and a 
7.5% tax on mining sales, minus certain deductions. These mining tax reforms received final approval by President 
Peña Nieto in December 2013 and went into effect on 1 January 2014. 

A mining concession in Mexico does not confer any ownership of surface rights. Surface rights must be secured through 
land purchase or land lease; the legal documentation must be certified by the Agrarian Ministry. Mining concessions 
may only be granted to Mexican nationals and companies, ejidos, agrarian communities and communes, and 
indigenous communities. Eligible companies must be based in Mexico, and foreign participation in the ownership of 
such companies must comply with the Foreign Investment Law that allows companies to be owned by a foreign interest. 

The mining concessions are held by PMLP, which is domiciled in México and owned by Coeur La Preciosa Silver Corp. 
(formerly, Orko Silver Corp.), a Canadian entity and La Preciosa Silver, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican entity, both of which 
are wholly owned by Coeur Mining, Inc.  The bylaws and charter of PMLP includes the exploration or exploitation of 
minerals and substances that are subject to the Mining Law. 

In accordance with a 2005 Mining Law amendment, there is no difference between exploration and exploitation mining 
concessions. The law allows owners of mining concessions to perform exploration activities with the purpose of 
identifying mineral deposits and quantifying and evaluating economically usable reserves and conducting work to 
prepare and develop areas containing mineral deposits; and to exploit the deposits (that is, mine the mineral products). 
Articles 29 and 39 from the Mining Law clearly stipulate that all mining concessions and projects must adhere to 
applicable regulations and permitting, including and not limited to labor, environment, explosives, etc. 

The Mining Law requires the mining concession owner to: 

 Start operations of exploration or exploitation 90 days following the recorded date of the mining concession, 
and incur and show evidence of certain minimum investments or obtain economically useful minerals;

FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 
 

 

 M3-PN130128

  188 

 Pay mining concession fees (fiscal requirements include corporate income tax and value added tax, but no 
royalties); 

 Comply with applicable regulations and standards, including but not limited to labor, safety, explosives, and 
the environment; 

 Maintain permanent fortification works, shoring and other installations needed for stability and safety; 
 Preserve landmarks; 
 Provide the Secretary of Economy with statistical, technical and accounting reports; 
 Allow inspections by the Secretary of the Economy; 
 Provide the Secretary of the Economy with technical reports when the mining concession is cancelled; 
 Provide the Mexican Geological Service with semi-annual reports on work and production if the concession 

is granted through a bid process; and 
 File annual reports detailing production statistics for the previous calendar year to the Secretary of the 

Economy. 

20.1.2 Key Mexican Environmental Statutes and Regulations 

At the federal level, the key environmental statutes and regulations are under the following laws: 

 General Law for the Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection and its Regulations in various 
matters (Ley General del Equilibrio Ecológico y la Protección al Ambiente (LGEEPA)); 

 General Law for the Prevention and Integral Management of Waste and its Regulations (Ley General para la 
Prevención y Gestión Integral de los Residuos); 

 Law of National Waters and its Regulations (Ley de Aguas Nacionales); 
 General Law for Forestry Sustainable Development and its Regulations (Ley General de Desarrollo Forestal 

Sustentable); 
 General Law of Wildlife and its Regulations (Ley General de Vida Silvestre); 
 General Law of Climate Change (Ley General de Cambio Climático); 
 Federal Law of Environmental Liability (Ley Federal de Responsabilidad Ambiental (LFRA)); 
 Mexican Official Standards, which contain technical provisions in environmental matters (Normas Oficiales 

Mexicanas (NOMs)). 

Environmental regulations, compliance criteria, and other environmental guidance related to mining operations are 
promulgated primarily on a federal level by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Secretaría de Medio 
Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT). 

The authorization to disturb the environment is through an Environmental Impact and Risk Authorization, change-of-
use permit for forest land, or other comparable authorization by SEMARNAT. The Environmental Impact Evaluation is 
performed by SEMARNAT upon receipt of an Environmental Impact Statement [Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental 
(MIA)] study prepared by the mining company. The MIA contains property ownership and land/legal information, 
technical information about the pre-mine ambient conditions related to the environment, a description of the 
environmental impacts and disturbance that will result from the mining and processing operations, and mitigation plans 
presented by the company to reduce impacts to the environment. The MIA is submitted along with the Technical Study 
of Forest Land use Modification (ETJ) and a Risk Assessment (ER) when the Project involves hazardous activities, 
such as the storage and handling of cyanide. 

As established by the federal environmental regulations, when naturally occurring vegetation or natural land is totally 
or partially cleared in order to use such land for non-forestry activities, the Project developer is required to obtain a 
Forest Land-Use Change from SEMARNAT. Important factors to note about the handling of the submitted ETJ 
document to request the authorization for a change in forest land use include the following:

 ETJ environmental documents are denied by default and only those projects that justify an exception are 

authorized; 
 The ETJ authorization involves a compensation fee, currently at $1,750 USD per hectare; 
 The ETJ authorization will most likely result in high compensation measures to keep an adequate balance 

between forest clearing and environmental services (i.e. reforestation in areas around or near the Project site 
will be required); 

 SEMARNAT requests a technical opinion from the State Forest Council; and 
 The required legal documentation for ejido land must be certified by the Agrarian Ministry. The General Ejido 

Assembly grants permission for the Forest Land Use Modification to Mining. The Ejido contract, leases, 
occupation, and expropriation must be certified by the Agrarian Ministry. 

The MIA process in Mexico is maturing towards a more stringent permitting policy with increasing compliance criteria, 
especially for high profile projects involving open pit mining, use of cyanide, and deforestation. The MIA submittal and 
resolution process involves the following: 
 

 Meeting a number of environmental conditions and requirements for pre-construction, construction, operation, 
closure, and post-closure activities; 

 Submission of periodic compliance reports; 
 Proof of a financial instrument to ensure full compliance to environmental conditions (environmental 

insurance, environmental bond, environmental trust fund, or other viable instruments); 
 Continuous verifications (i.e. site visits, audits) by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency [Procuraduría 

Federal de Protección al Ambiente (PROFEPA)]; and 
 Preparation and periodic update of specific management, monitoring, and training programs. 

Provisions of LFRA are designed to protect, preserve, and restore the environment and ecological equilibrium in order 
to guarantee the human right to a healthy environment for all individuals. LFRA defines the concept of environmental 
damage and the responsibility of corporate entities causing that damage, exemptions, and liabilities related to illicit acts 
or omissions, and compensation requirements when damage cannot be restored to the original state. A suit can be 
filed by (1) inhabitants of the community adjacent to an area where environmental damage has occurred, (2) Mexican 
non-profit organizations representing a community inhabitant, (3) PROFEPA or (4) a state or federal environmental 
agency or institution within their territorial jurisdiction working in partnership with PROFEPA. In addition to repairs, fines 
can be levied against individuals and corporate entities. LFRA defines the judicial process for civil claims, makes a 
provision for an Environmental Liability Fund [Fondo de Responsabilidad Ambiental (FORA)] and alternative 
mechanisms of resolving disputes. LFRA creates new Environmental Judicial Courts that will begin operation as of 7 
July 2015. 

Several of the specific environmental standards and regulations [Normas Oficiales Mexicanas (NOMs)] that apply to 
mining and beneficiation operations, including closure for these same facilities are listed below.  

 NOM-035-SEMARNAT-1993 establishes the measurement methods to determine the concentration of 
suspended particles in the air to monitor air quality. It requires data for temperature, barometric pressure, wind 
direction and speed to determine the concentration of total suspended particles. 

 NOM-083-SEMARNAT-2003 requires that the landfill facilities should be instrumented to monitor gas 
emissions and that any leachate should be characterized to determine pH, biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD), as well as heavy metals. The aquifer should be monitored for 
changes in the water gradient as well as the natural variations of the flow due to the seasonal changes; and 
a baseline study should be conducted to determine groundwater quality. At closure the landfill must be closed

using an engineered cover. This cover must isolate the waste, minimize infiltration of fluids into the ground, 
control the flow of biogas, minimize erosion, and provide adequate drainage. 

The regulation applies to landfills that reach their final height and have an area of at least one hectare. The 
closure of the landfill should include restrictions regarding the use of the site, slope stability, land boundaries, 
details about the closure engineered cover, surface drainage and infrastructure to control leachate and biogas. 
A program for post-closure monitoring and maintenance of all facilities of the landfill should be developed, for 
a period of at least 20 years. This period may be reduced if it is shown that there is no risk to health and the 
environment. The program should include the maintenance of the final cover and procedures to repair it as 
well as procedures to handle subsidence caused by the degradation of the solid and hazardous waste. Also 
damage from erosion (caused by stormwater run off and wind) should be taken into account when preparing 
the monitoring and maintenance program. 

 NOM-138-SEMARNAT/SS-2003 establishes maximum permissible limits for hydrocarbons in soil.  Should 
limits be exceeded, an environmental and human health risk assessment may be conducted to determine 
remediation options. 

 NOM-141-SEMARNAT-2003 establishes procedures to characterize tailings, as well as providing 
specifications and criteria for tailings dam siting, design, construction, operation, and closure. The post-
closure requirements for tailings impoundments requires that measures be taken to ensure that the closed 
facilities are not liberating particulates to the atmosphere, that discharges are not impacting surface water or 
groundwater and that the impoundments are physically stable. If the tailings are potentially acid-generating, 
then the tailings should be covered or submerged to prevent acid drainage formation, or they should be 
neutralized using other materials. If mitigation of acid drainage is required, then the measures taken should 
prevent impacts to water, soils, and sediments. The slopes needed to be stabilized. 

 NOM-147-SEMARNAT/SSA1-2004 establishes soil remediation levels for concentrations of arsenic, barium, 
beryllium, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, mercury, nickel, silver, lead, selenium, thallium, and vanadium. 
The regulation includes specifications for site characterization (such as the number of samples), a conceptual 
site model, and an alternative method to determine remediation levels based on a risk assessment. 

 NOM-157-SEMARNAT-2009 establishes the requirements for mine waste management plans. Section 5.6 of 
the regulation describes the criteria for storage and final deposition of wastes. The criteria include identification 
of the site environment that could be impacted by operations; the engineering and maintenance specifications 
to maintain physical stability; control measures to avoid wind and water erosion; and measures to prevent 
acid drainage, leaching, and run off. Post-closure criteria include monitoring of water bodies that could be 
impacted and reforestation using stockpiled soil and native species of the area. 

20.1.3 State Laws and Ordinances 

The Durango State Ecological Ordinance is the primary state law that will be applied to the Project. The type of project 
proposed at the Property falls under two environmental categories: A) Conservation and B) Land usage. The Durango 
State ordinance does not set limiting statutes for mining under these two categories and clearly states that these 
activities, in terms of ecological ordinances, must be reviewed at municipal or local scale. 

The Project will need to file for a Land Use License. A permit is generally required by the Local Urban Development 
Regulations, if they exist, stating that the use of the land where a given mining project is located is compatible with the 
local or regional urban development plan. The Project will also need to secure a construction permit for the installation 
of the required infrastructure.

20.1.4 Site Permitting Requirements 

The environmental permits will be primarily issued by SEMARNAT. The Environmental Impact Evaluation will take 
place in Mexico City (Central Offices), as the current applicable SEMARNAT criteria is that all projects that involve a 
hazardous activity, must be evaluated by SEMARNAT´s Central Offices. The Project will need a number of permits for 
commercial operation including: 

 A Change of Use of Forest Land to Mining use; 
 An Environmental Impact and Risk Authorization; 
 Environmental License (Licencia Ambiental Única), which will allow commercial mining extraction and mineral 

processing after the MIA application is approved; 
 Land Use License and Construction Permit; 
 Permit for the Use of Explosives; 
 Hazardous Waste Generator Permit (Generadora de Residuos Peligrosos); and 
 Water concession permits for extraction and use of mine water. 

A Cédula de Operación Anual (COA) – an annual report regarding the air emissions and contaminants generated on 
site, is submitted as part of the environmental license requirement. The COA requires an update to describe the mining 
and processing operation every 5 years. 

20.1.5 Site Permitting Status 

The Project currently has two exploration drilling permits from SEMARNAT. The permits needed for commercial 
operations will first require approval by SEMARNAT of the MIA documents. 

 Baseline Studies to Support MIA Applications  

Coeur has initiated the baseline studies on the major topics (i.e. forest, wildlife, soil, landscape, hydrogeology, waste 
characterization) in support of preparing two MIA applications that will be submitted to SEMARNAT in the future. The 
baseline studies include information collected in different seasons and years (2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014), based on 
the location of the mine site and expected access road and services. The environmental baseline is composed of data 
collected on a regional level as well as physical, chemical, and biological data collected on a local scale. The 
environmental baseline was scaled to ensure suitable coverage by collecting regional and site-specific data, including 
the definition of the local environmental system, based mostly on nano and micro basins directly upgradient and 
downgradient of the Project infrastructure and operations, as well as additional surface areas that have similar 
conditions or natural barriers. 

The "Environmental System" needed for permitting evaluations has been identified, covering 14,261 hectares that 
comprise a mosaic of agricultural land, scrub forest, the mine site, and the immediate communities; the Environmental 
System considers the current land use and the natural hydrologic basins and aquifers. The first MIA application will 
address disturbance to the road and utility access corridor from Federal Highway 40 to the site. The second MIA 
application will address the disturbance to areas at the Project site required for mining, processing, and disposal of 
waste rock and tailings. 

 Future Permitting Phases 

The Project is planned to be executed in two permitting phases: 
 
Phase 1: Access road and services. Once the mine development moves forwards, a suitable and dedicated 

mine road is needed ready in advance for construction. The environmental documents and 
authorization that must be submitted and obtained prior to execution are a MIA and an ETJ.

Phase 2:  Development of mine site (preparation, construction, exploitation, processing, and closure) 

The environmental documents and authorization that must be submitted and obtained prior to execution of Phase 2 
are a MIA, a Risk Assessment (ER) and an ETJ. Mine site preparation and construction will need a dedicated access 
road and infrastructure; the two phase approach should enable the Project to initiate construction as soon as an 
authorization is issued.  

The Project is in the process of completing the environmental documents. The final documents will include the following: 

 Project updates and latest design improvements (geotechnical, resource modeling, water balance, 
infrastructure components and final master plan) 

 Legal documentation for surface land (ownership, lease, documentation ratified by Agrarian Ministry) 

The required evaluation period for the environmental authority is 60 workings days. Certain projects, owing to their 
complexity, profile, and need for additional information, may have an expanded review period of up to 60 additional 
working days (for a total of 6 months). 

If the Project requires modifications and additional areas, a new MIA, ETJ and an updated ER may need to be submitted 
in order to consider new and total environmental impact for a new environmental authorization. 

20.1.6 Social License in Mexico 

Under the Mexican legal system, the concept of the "social license to operate" does not exist. It must be considered, 
however, that whereas the Federal Government issues permits for mine development and operations, it is the Municipal 
(local) Government that grants a Land Use Permit and a Construction License, in accordance with the local legislation 
that allows or prohibits certain activities or land uses. 

In the past years, increased concern has arisen related to the topic of indigenous groups. This issue is addressed by 
the government in the current criteria considered during the authorization of the MIA. The La Preciosa region and 
municipality around the Project fall under the "scattered indigenous population" category; less than 40 percent of the 
population is indigenous. Locally, the largest concentrations of indigenous people (55 percent) reside in the locality of 
Francisco I. Madero, approximately 13.75 km east of the Property. 

In terms of the role that society plays in the environmental legislation in Mexico, a public consultation can take place 
within the Environmental Impact Evaluation Procedure of the Project whereby any person interested in the Project can 
make observations to the MIA and propose further mitigation and compensation measures. Furthermore, a public 
assembly can take place with all stakeholders. 

As discussed in Section 20.1.2, any person, social group, non-governmental organization, or association can file claims 
before the environmental authorities in accordance with the LGEEPA when an activity threatens to cause damages to 
the environment. This law allows third parties to submit appeals against administrative acts that result in illegal actions 
related to environmental law. 

20.1.7 Site Health and Safety Program and Training 

Health and safety issues are being monitored by Coeur's Safety Department, and training is and will be provided by 
the staff to employees, contractors, and others working on site The Safety Department is currently developing a 
standardized Health and Safety system for training and for tracking and reporting incidents (PMLP, 2014). Since 
purchasing the Project, PMLP has worked without a lost time injury or medical treatment case.

20.2 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY INVESTIGATIONS AND RESULTS 

A number of site characterization and engineering studies have been completed or are currently in progress to support 
the MIA applications. The completed environmental studies and inventories have been compiled for the project area 
and adjacent land in compliance with requirements for the presentation of the main environmental documents that must 
be submitted prior to mine development: the MIA, the ETJ and ER. The information collected will be used for the 
preparation of the MIA and for other environmental documents to be submitted to the authorities for environmental 
permitting. Further environmental work will continue at the site in the form of pre-mining baseline monitoring programs. 
Brief summaries are provided in Sections 20.2.1 through 20.2.8 of the pre-mine site conditions and the findings from 
these studies. 

20.2.1 Local and Site Climate Studies 

Local climatological data, acquired from the climatological network of CONAGUA, was compiled to estimate climate 
conditions for the Project site. Data from four weather stations located around the Project were reviewed; the locations 
of the stations are listed in Table 20-1 and shown in Figure 20-1. Each station represents more than 25 years of 
precipitation data. Proximity to the Project, a comparison of elevation, and suitability of the data collected at each 
station were the criteria used to select the data set that would best represent climate conditions at the Project. The 
Peña del Águila weather station was the furthest from the site, but was selected based on similar elevation, and the 
relevance and integrity of the data records from this station (longer period of precipitation data and more complete). 

A compilation of monthly average total precipitation and evaporation is presented in Table 20-2. The local precipitation 
data were used as design criteria inputs for the Project, and were used to estimate the probable maximum precipitation 
24-hour rainfall  depth (302 mm) (SRK, 2014a), to determine the various design storms (SRK, 2014b), and to estimate 
the steady-state water balance discussed in Section 20.2.5 (SRK, 2014j). 

A site weather station was installed in 2014 at the core sheds (future location of the Abundancia pit) to monitor the 
climate conditions at the Project. Measurements for temperature, rainfall depths, rainfall time interval (intensity), 
humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and wind direction are being recorded and downloaded from a data logger for 
compilation and monthly review. Daily maximum and minimum values are being compiled. Evaporation pan equipment 
has not yet been installed.

20.2.2 Baseline Air Quality 

The existing air quality at the Project site is typical of the farming regions of Central Durango State. The air quality in 
the area is variable. While there are few fixed-point emission sources, fugitive dust emissions are a common 
characteristic of the area, especially during dry season and during the preparation of agricultural plots prior to the rain 
season. No formal study of the baseline air quality at the site has yet been undertaken.

Farming activities in the area immediately surrounding the project site include dry farming for beans and corn. There 
is a plowing season that occurs in late May and into June, with planting of the desired seeds immediately prior to the 
monsoonal rainy season. Harvest of the beans and corn begins after the rainy season, with that farm activity occurring 
for some months as a primary and gleaning activities occur. Thus, there are two extended times during the year when 
plowing and harvesting activities will likely cause considerable dust. Two other times during the year generate very 
little dust including the rainy season and the inactive agricultural season during which there is limited activity in the 
fields.  

20.2.3 Groundwater Characterization 

The Project is within the limits between Madero-Guadalupe Aquifer and the Valle del Guadiana Aquifer as defined by 
CONAGUAS (2009).  As part of the preliminary baseline groundwater characterization, SRK located and sampled 21 
wells and 3 springs that are located within 10 km of the Project site (SRK, 2014n).  These wells and springs are used 
for drinking water supply, agriculture, and livestock.  At each source, SRK measured field parameters (temperature, 
pH, and conductivity) and collected samples for analysis of total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, nitrates, 
chloride, alkalinity, total hardness, sulfates, and dissolved metals.  The laboratory results show that the groundwater 
in the region is generally of good quality.  For reference purposes the results were compared against the permissible 
limits established by NOM-001 for human drinking water.  Nearly all of the wells and springs were compliant with the 
drinking water standards; however, two wells and one spring located approximately 7 km south of the Project had iron 
and fluoride levels in excess of the standards.  These elevated levels are believed to be naturally occurring.  The water 
supply wells for the Project are within 500 meters of one of these wells.   

In addition to the samples taken, SRK recorded water levels where possible and constructed a map of the regional 
potentiometric surface. From the available well data listed in Table 20-3, the groundwater appears to flow from the 
north-northwest to the south-southeast, mimicking the regional topography (Figure 16-1). KP also documented site 
water levels in geotechnical boreholes drilled in 2014 and from the vibrating wire piezometers (VWPs) they installed. 
The three VWPs installed in the Abundancia pit area indicate the water level is approximately 1,960 masl (ranges from 
1960 masl to 1,963 masl) or 8.8 to 200.8 m below ground surface (bgs). The average water level beneath the 
Abundancia pit and the TSF is approximately 100 m and 150 m bgs, respectively. 

In the Project area, the most important aquifer is the "volcanic" unit which hosts most of the mineralization. Increased 
fracturing is associated with localized vein contacts, and jointing and fracturing is more prevalent in the volcanic unit 
than in the underlying conglomerate and schist units. The irregular fracturing and vein density make the hydraulic 
conductivity of this unit quite variable. While permeability is generally low, the hydraulic conductivity based on packer 
testing performed ranges from 4E-08 to 3E-04 m/s (KP, 2014b).

20.2.4 Surface Water and Storm Water 

Surface run off is mostly to the south and east and all the surface run off is seasonal, lacking permanent surface water 
bodies in the area (SRK, 2014i). One perennial stream flows past the village of Francisco Madero. The remaining 
streams in the Project area are ephemeral with short-duration seasonal flow in washes and arroyos that are dry for 
most of the year. The ephemeral stream flow is captured at numerous locations in the Project site and immediate 
environs by man-made reservoirs created for agriculture and livestock usage. A semi-permanent source of water is 
found in the crater of the nearby Jaguey volcano in the La Breña-El Jaguey Maar Complex. In October 2013, SRK took 
surface water quality samples from the Jaguey crater, a nearby spring, and from selected nearby water reservoirs 
(SRK, 2014n). The samples were intended to provide a preliminary analysis of pre-mine background conditions for 
local surface water. None of these water sources appear to be used for human drinking water. For reference purposes, 
the results were compared against the permissible limits established by NOM-001 for human drinking water. Arsenic 
and sodium were elevated above permissible limits in the water sampled from the nearby crater. Results from three of 
the agricultural reservoirs showed concentrations of aluminum and iron that exceeded permissible limits for human 
consumption. One of the reservoir samples had elevated total dissolved solids. 

20.2.5 Site Water Balance Estimate 

As discussed in Section 18.8, a steady-state site-wide water balance was prepared for inclusion in the second MIA 
application (SRK, 2014j). The water balance estimate indicates the site will be a net water user and that the Project 
will rely on make-up water pumped from the well field, stormwater run off ponds, and from pit dewatering. Water usage 
from water supply wells will decrease with time owing to the contribution of groundwater inflows as the pits deepen. 

20.2.6 Geochemical Assessment – Waste Rock and Tailings 

A preliminary geochemical assessment of mine waste materials was performed by SRK in 2014 (SRK, 2014k). The 
primary objective of the program was to assess the acid rock drainage and metal leaching potential (ARD/ML) of waste 
rock and tailings that have been or will be produced during mining and processing and that could potentially impair 
local surface and groundwater quality. The methods that were used comply with Mexican regulations pertaining to 
geochemical characterization of mining wastes, and the results will provide documentation to support the site-wide 
MIA. 

The geochemical analytical program was based primarily on regulations published by SEMARNAT for characterization 
of mining wastes and hazardous wastes. These include NOM 141 SEMARNAT 2003 (SEMARNAT 2004), NOM 157-
SEMARNAT-2009 (SEMARNAT 2011), and NOM 052 SEMARNAT 2005 (SEMARNAT 2006). SRK also included 
analyses for pH, moisture, and neutralization potential per the Modified Sobek method. 

 Waste Rock  

Representative samples of waste rock were generated from historic and recent drill core through a review of the assay, 
rock, and oxidation data in the drillhole database and the location of drill samples within the 3D pit shells. The results 
of the preliminary waste characterization indicate that some of the mining wastes generated at the Project have the 
potential to cause environmental impacts and may require mitigation measures. Seven of the 50 waste rock samples 
are acid generating by the criterion defined in NOM-157. Six of these are volcanic and one is quartz vein. Based on 
data and field observations, the basalt, sedimentary rock, and paleosoil rock units are non-acid generating. The six 
acid generating samples of the 37 volcanic rock samples represent 16% of the volcanic sample set. The samples were 
selected randomly with no known geologic or spatial bias. Unless supplementary kinetic testing proves that the rocks 
are not acid generating, waste rock management methods will be considered where necessary to limit stormwater 
contact with potentially acid generating waste rock and to minimize run off and release of acid rock drainage.

The extent to which the measured neutralization potential compares to the effective neutralization potential may be an 
important factor in the generation of ARD/ML from waste rock. Measured NP includes non-carbonate minerals such as 
silicates that can neutralize acid in a laboratory setting. Effective NP is the NP that can neutralize internal and external 
acidity inputs sufficiently to maintain a near-neutral drainage pH (Price, 2009). NP measured in static tests may be 
higher than effective NP for several reasons. At high rates of acid generation, silicate minerals, which can report as 
neutralizing minerals in ABA, may not be available for neutralization. This may be relevant at the Project which, owing 
to the volcanic host, is characterized by relatively large proportions of silicate minerals. Kinetic testing can help quantify 
effective NP, which is why SRK recommended conducting humidity cells on selected samples (SRK, 2014k).. 

With respect to leaching potential of metals and metalloids, numerous constituents exceed the dry base maximum 
permissible limits of NOM-157. However, when subjected to the leachate test (PECT), there were no analytes that 
exceeded the maximum permissible limits for the PECT. By definition in NOM-157, none of the waste rock is classified 
as dangerous owing to metals toxicity. 

 Tailings 

 Two representative tailings samples were generated from historic and recent drill cores through a review of assay 
(above cutoff grade), rock and oxidation data in the drillhole database and the location of the proposed drill core 
intervals with the 3D pit shells. Both of the samples of tailings materials generated through laboratory test work were 
measured to be acid neutralizing. No follow-up testing is required per Mexican regulations, and no mitigation measures 
appear to be necessary to comply with the mandates of Section 5.7.2 in NOM-141. From the standpoint of regulatory 
compliance for permitting, the PECT data are the only leachate data that are relevant, and the leachate data show no 
analytes that exceed regulatory limits. 

However, the ore processing methodology currently being evaluated has the potential to leave residual constituents 
that might necessitate mitigation measures at some time in the future depending on circumstances such as exposure 
of tailings to humans or wildlife. More specifically, based on supernatant analyses, tailings have the potential to carry 
cyanide at concentrations that exceed NOM-001 limits for aquatic life. Although analyzing the supernatant solution 
component and submitting this data is not required for permitting documents, routine monitoring of the TSF liquid 
fraction will be expected over the life of the mine, and these data are the best indicator of the long-term conditions 
expected. With a lined TSF, possible groundwater or surface water discharge is a minor concern assuming the liner 
functions as designed. The primary concern requiring monitoring is the potential for wildlife to access and ingest the 
tailings supernatant fluid. 

20.2.7 Biological and Wildlife Assessment 

There are several conservation designations that have the potential to impact potential land use if the Project were to 
fall within one of these specially protected lands. No portion of the Project area is designated for special environmental 
protection. There are three national Protected Natural Areas [Área Natural Protegida (ANP)] within the state of 
Durango, but the closest ANP is 100 km from the Project. The Project also falls outside any protected area classified 
as a critical terrestrial region [Regiones Terrestres Prioritarias (RTP)]; the closest RTP is found 20 km away near the 
municipality of Canatlán (M3, 2013). There are two areas in Durango set aside for conservation of bird species 
(particularly migratory water fowl) [Areas de Importancia para la Conservación de las Aves (AICA)]. The two AICAs, 
however, are 8 km and 48 km distant from the site.  

The vegetation in the Project area is characterized by large expanses of agricultural fields, thorny acacia, scrub brush, 
succulent woody scrub brush (stegnosperma), ocotillo, cacti (opuntia), yucca; the foothills contain limited woody 
vegetation. The most prevalent woody species is acacia, which is quite abundant in the non-agricultural lowlands. 
Baseline studies in 2009 identified the area to be heavily impacted by intensive agricultural disturbances (farming, 
grazing). Although the technical vegetative designation of the area is a scrub oak forest, there are very few oak trees 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 
 

 

 M3-PN130128

  199 

in the immediate area including the rolling hills that outcrop between the agricultural files. The area adjacent to the 
Project support more oak forests than in the immediate Project area (M3, 2013).    

Baseline surveys at the Project site were initiated by Clifton Associates Ltd (Clifton) of Guadalajara, Mexico in 2009 for 
a previous owner (Clifton, 2009). These studies reviewed all regional and local site characteristics (climate, geology, 
vegetation zones/types, soil zones/types, and the plant and vertebrate species). The 2009 survey identified 91 local 
vertebrate species including 67 birds, 11 mammals, 1 amphibian, and 12 reptiles. Nine of the species within the Project 
area were identified as protected fauna under Mexican Law.  

In 2014, Clifton updated the vegetation surveys and wildlife inventories on a total of 14,261 ha (Clifton, 2014). The 
inventoried land comprises scrub forest, natural and planted grassland, seasonal dry-land agriculture, and irrigated 
agriculture. The following species were identified: 

 41 plant species; and 
 121 vertebrates including 87 birds,15 mammals, 3 amphibians, and 16 reptiles. 

Thirteen of the animal species were identified as protected fauna and two of the cacti species are protected flora. 

20.2.8 Historical and Archaeological Resources 

In order to assess the presence of any historical and/or archaeological resources within the Project area, the site was 
first outlined on a map based on the preliminary plans for the open pits, waste rock dumps, low-grade stockpile, TSF, 
and processing plant facilities (M3, 201) plus a half kilometer buffer zone. This potential disturbance area was sent for 
review to the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History [Instituto Nacional de Antropolgía e Historía 
(INAH)] in Durango; INAH reviews plans for industrial or mining disturbance. INAH maintains national databases for 
resources related to anthropology, history, archaeology, paleontology and ethnography and is responsible for the 
conservation of those resources. The Durango INAH Durango office reviewed the outline of proposed disturbance and 
compared the outline with known resources catalogued in the Sistema de Registro Público de Monumentos y Zonas 
Arqueológicos e Históricicos. Five archaeological sites were noted in the database in the general region but none were 
known to exist within the project area (INAH, 2013).   A site specific inventory is being contracted. 

The project site and the access road route were reviewed in 2013-2014 by field consultants from Clifton for the initiation 
of the permitting process for the Project. Their focus was the documentation of flora, fauna and other resources. No 
historic or archeological resources, however, were reported during those field surveys.    

20.3 ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND MITIGATION PLANS 

This section summarizes the planned programs to characterize baseline conditions and for routine monitoring and 
management during construction, operations, and closure. 

20.3.1 General 

The mitigation plans for disturbance at the Project cover three main areas: 

 Project designs based on site-specific geotechnical, geochemical, natural resources, and land-use 
considerations and Coeur's commitment to minimize disturbance where ever possible; 

 Environmental monitoring and mitigation plans for each project stage, activity and project component; and  
 A closure plan that is periodically updated for site restoration and elimination of residual impacts and 

reclamation of disturbed land.

 M3-PN130128

The development during preparation, construction, and operations will be monitored based on a strict control over the 
authorized disturbance areas, actual disturbances, and compensation measures to offset the expected disturbance. 
This requires creation of an environmental management system at site and a GIS-based monitoring plan through the 
use of remote sensors to be updated during the life of mine. 

The main tool for environmental compliance and monitoring actions throughout the life of mine is the Environmental 
Surveillance Program (PVA). The PVA, will be an essential tool for environmental compliance and performance 
monitoring. The PVA will integrate the following: 

 Prevention, Control and Mitigation measures for environmental impacts; 
 Terms and conditions derived from environmental authorizations; and 
 Social, Community and Corporate policies, guidelines and reporting protocols. 

The PVA will integrate various operational, environmental, and health and safety aspects including: 

 Stability monitoring of the TSF, waste rock piles, and open pits; 
 Soil erosion prevention, topsoil recovery and the installation of soil retention structures; 
 Storm water pollution prevention plan to manage, protect and divert run off and avoid mixing with contact 

water (from waste rock piles, stockpile, mining areas); 
 Materials management plan, based on characteristics, volume, production, handling and disposal; 
 Vegetation protection and restoration plans; 
 Fauna protocols: Inspections, animal chase off, capture and release, burrow holes and nest inspections; 

specific protocols for capturing, handling and relocating protected species; identification protocols and new 
species reporting; 

 Forest material: Monitoring the usage of non-commercial forest resources; 
 Land and soil: Securing and controlling toilet services, delimitation of each work area and land disturbance 

boundary, training personnel for land clearing, topsoil recovery and handling, recovery and integration of plant 
material to topsoil, application of land conservation measures; 

 Hydrology: Methods for surface water conveyance, protection and monitoring; protection and segregation of 
clean and contact stormwater; 

 Spill Control and Chemical Handling: Training employees to prevent spills, handle chemicals, and perform 
emergency response actions, if necessary. 

 Air emissions: Dust monitoring and dust abatement; 
 Noise and Vibration: Monitoring and control of excessive noise and vibrations; daily and periodic equipment 

checks, monitoring and emissions controls from process operations; 
 Climate monitoring: Operation, maintenance, and database management of the site weather station; 
 Waste management: Preparation and updating a waste management plan including waste classification, 

waste separation, adequate and labeled waste containers, continuous monitoring and cleanup activities, 
waste minimization program (generation, reutilization, recycling), storage and handling, pollution prevention, 
training, transportation, security, and emergency response. 

 Preventive maintenance program: Asset management program; 
 Signage: Design and implementation of environmental and health and safety protection signs, identification 

of restricted use areas (authorized for mine development, conservation area, recovery, reforestation, etc.), 
educational and informative signs; 

 Reforestation and reclamation of disturbed land: Reforestation surface, species, reporting by parcels, surface, 
density, species, survival rate, phytosanitary conditions; plant nursery operation and production; 

 Financial instruments:  Update of a technical and financial assurance documents to secure environmental 
bonds, insurance, or other financial instrument; 

 Mine Closure: Periodic update of mine closure plan, progressive closure measures; and

 Additional programs: Personnel training, community relations, environmental budget review and update, 
follow up and periodic reviews, environmental reporting. 

The sections below provide details on specific mitigation and monitoring plans. 

20.3.2 Climate Monitoring 

The Project staff will continue to maintain and monitor the site weather station to provide information relevant to 
operations and environmental management of the site. Daily measurements for temperature, rainfall, humidity, solar 
evaporation, wind speed, and wind direction will be measured and downloaded monthly from the data logger for 
compilation and reporting monthly. Pan evaporation equipment is recommended to be added in the future. 

20.3.3 Air Quality Monitoring and Dust Abatement 

Dust monitoring will begin in the area 6 months prior to site preparation, using a certified air emissions laboratory for 
Total Suspended Particles (TSP) and Particulate Matter (PM-10). Once mine development initiates, laboratory samples 
will be collected each trimester. The Project will operate an internal program for dust monitoring though the use of 
portable low volume samplers for TSP and PM-10. 

The Project will effectively minimize, monitor, and control dust and particulate generation during both the construction 
and operation phases. Construction activities will include clearing and grubbing of soils during site preparation of the 
plant site, TSF, mine waste dumps and roads, and other features. The dust generated during construction activities 
will be controlled with application of additional water or other seasonal measures, as required. 

Control of dust during mine operations will be via standard industry practices and techniques. This includes adding 
water as part of all drilling activities and installing enclosed skirting around the drill bits to minimize dust generation. 
Road dust will be minimized through use of dust control agents on haulage and mine roads and applying water using 
large water trucks. Environmentally friendly surface stabilization products will be used where needed. 

20.3.4 Groundwater Monitoring Plan 

No permanent groundwater monitoring wells exist at the site. One well has been proposed to be installed to monitor 
background conditions upgradient of the Project. One well has been proposed downgradient of the Plant Site and two 
wells have been proposed to be installed downgradient of the TSF (SRK, 2014m). The wells will be monitored monthly 
for a minimum of one year to establish the pre-mining baseline groundwater quality and water level conditions. During 
operations and for a minimum of 10 years post-closure, the wells will be routinely analyzed for an extensive suite of 
constituents on an annual basis. A limited list of indicator parameters will be analyzed on a quarterly basis during 
operations to provide more frequent operational monitoring. Water level measurements will be used to prepare an 
annual potentiometric surface map and vertical profiles through the pit area to monitor water level conditions. A data 
management system will be initiated to review the analytical results, prepare hydrographs and water quality graphs, 
and to assess the occurrence of any trends that may occur in groundwater quality. 

Groundwater or methane monitoring wells may be required for monitoring downgradient of the solid waste landfill, but 
will be reviewed once a design has been prepared for the landfill. 

20.3.5 Surface Water Monitoring and Storm Water Management Plan 

Stormwater run on from upgradient watershed basins will be managed to minimize run on into the open pits and to the 
plant area, waste rock dumps, and the TSF. Preliminary designs for channels and berms have been developed to 
prevent unimpacted stormwater from contacting mining wastes. Precipitation and stormwater falling directly on or within 
the plant or tailings areas will be considered to be impacted through contact with potentially impacted soils and mined 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT

  202 

waste materials. Precipitation within the open pits, plant area, or on the TSF will be collected and pumped to the plant 
site as make-up water.  

A Surface Water and Storm Water Management and Monitoring Plan will be developed prior to the initiation of 
construction activities and will be updated, as needed, during operations (KP, 2014f).  The plan is intended to:  

 protect local surface waters from impacts owing to the potential erosion of sediments from newly disturbed 
construction areas and fines from tailings and waste rock dumps; 

 divert unimpacted stormwater to the greatest extent possible to adjacent natural drainages to minimize losses 
to the downgradient arroyos and agricultural users; 

 provide guidance on best management practices to control stormwater run on and run off, and to prevent loss 
of fines (i.e. berms, channels, ditches, sumps, sediment collection basins); 

 provide guidance on routine inspections  to ensure the stormwater control features are operating properly; 
and 

 provide guidance for stormwater outfall monitoring for any potential impacted stormwater that is discharged 
from the site. 

20.3.6 Petroleum and Chemical Spill Control Plan 

A Chemical and Petroleum Spill Prevention and Control Plan (Spill Control Plan) has been prepared to ensure the safe 
response to potential release of chemical and petroleum products to the environment (SRK, 2014d). It also describes 
procedures to prevent, control, and mitigates releases of diesel fuel, gasoline, lubrication oils, hydraulic oils, anti-
freeze/water mixes, transformer oils, plant reagents, and liquid lab wastes to the environment. 

The Spill Control Plan was prepared in to be in accordance with Mexican environmental regulations including: Ley 
General de Equilibrio Ecológico y Protección al Ambiente; Reglamento de la Ley General de Equilibrio Ecológico y 
Protección al Ambiente en Materia de Impacto Ambiental; Ley General para la Prevención y Gestión Integral de los 
Residuos y su Reglamento. The Plan incorporates additional industry best practices using requirements promulgated 
by both Mexico and the United States Environmental Protection Agency 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 
112, Oil Pollution Oil Pollution Prevention and Response; Non-Transportation-Related Onshore and Offshore Facilities; 
Final Rule. La Presciosa must comply with these minimum requirements because the facility will store greater than 
1,320 gallons of chemical and petroleum products above ground. The Spill Control Plan will be implemented at the 
beginning of pre-mine construction and updated during operations as needed. 

20.3.7 Hazardous and Solid Waste Disposal 

Prior to start up, the Project will implement a waste management program. A consolidated Waste Management Plan 
will be prepared and submitted to SEMARNAT. The management program will focus on separate components:  

 Hazardous waste management (prevention, reduction, classification, storage, disposal). 
 Non-hazardous special and solid waste management (reduction, recycling, re-utilization, and disposal). 

A specific building or area will be designated for temporary on-site storage of hazardous materials and special wastes 
(batteries, fluorescent lights, electronic waste, used oils), or other materials requiring recycling. Manifests will be 
prepared for hazardous wastes to document the container sizes, residual quantity of each material requiring disposal, 
and the destination of each shipment to a permitted storage. Wastes will be shipped by a licensed transporter.  

An on-site solid waste landfill will be managed for disposal of non-hazardous wastes including office trash, food waste, 
and building and wood debris. Cardboard and plastics will be recycled, if practical, rather than be placed in the solid

  203 

waste landfill. No asbestos-containing waste is expected to be generated or stored on site. A tire burial cell will needed 
on-site to dispose of large truck tires. Waste water disposal will be handled through on-site septic systems and disposal. 

20.3.8 Waste Rock Management and Monitoring Plan 

A Waste Rock Monitoring Plan has been prepared (SRK, 2014l) and will be updated as needed. The plan addresses 
management of stormwater run on and run off through the use of berms, ditches, and diversion channels to minimize 
the stormwater contact with sub-grade, but metal-bearing, waste rock. The plan provides for the creation of sediment 
collection basins at the downgradient toe of the waste rock storage facilities to prevent fines from being transported 
into surface water drainages. Monitoring activities will focus on assessing the stability of the rock storage facilities, 
inspecting stormwater structures, and performing geochemical analyses on representative samples from each dump. 
The geochemical data will be provided to SEMARNAT in an annual monitoring report and will be used to assess the 
need for blending of materials during operations to minimize potential for acid rock drainage and to assist in closure 
planning. 

20.3.9 Tailings Management and Monitoring Plan 

A preliminary Tailings Management Plan (KP, 2014) has been prepared to address construction, operations, and 
maintenance of the TSF including the TSF itself and associated pumping and piping systems. A Monitoring Plan for 
the Tailings Storage Facility (SRK, 2014e) was prepared to provide protocols for routine site inspections (stability, 
freeboard, stormwater management structures). The Monitoring Plan provides guidance and requirements for 
documenting the results of the inspections, addressing repair issues as needed, and providing clear contingency 
actions in the event upset conditions occur. The two plans will be updated and/or consolidated as needed during 
operations. 

20.3.10 Vegetation Protection and Restoration Plan 

The Project staff will develop a Vegetation Protection and Restoration Plan that will provide protocols to be used during 
the initial site preparation activities (clearing and grubbing), concurrent reclamation of the TSF embankment and other 
disturbed areas as appropriate during operations, and the restoration methods at closure. The vegetation protection 
protocols will specify methods for rescue and transplanting of protected species, salvaging wood or edible plants, 
methods for performing mechanical and manual land clearing, and plant handling and relocation. An on-site nursery 
will be designed and constructed to provide plants for restoration purposes. 

20.4 MINE CLOSURE AND RECLAMATION 

Mine reclamation is addressed in Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution, which sets two broad standards for 
reclamation: 

(1) Mexico retains ownership of the land at all times and concession holders only have rights to mined materials. 
As such, the Nation may establish the conditions of reclamation. 

(2) Mexico has an obligation to take mitigation measures to protect natural resources and restore the ecological 
balance. 

Mexican mining law has no requirements or technical guidance pertaining to the site-wide closure, reclamation, and 
post-closure of a mining and beneficiation facility. Post-closure requirements, standards, and guidelines related to 
specific facilities such as landfills, tailings impoundments, and mining waste storage facilities are specified in the NOMs. 
The maximum permissible limits for hydrocarbons and soil remediation levels for concentrations of metals are set in 
NOM-138-SEMARNAT/SS-2003 and NOM-147-SEMARNAT/SSA1-2004, respectively. Many mining corporations in 
Mexico, however, do prepare site-wide closure plans in accordance with the requirements of their corporate

environmental charters, international best closure practices, and prescriptive environmental protection and 
management codes.  

The Project duration is expected to be approximately 11 years based on the current LOM plan shown in Table 20-4. 
Detailed closure planning typically begins in the latter part of the mine life within three years of mine closure. A 
Conceptual Closure and Reclamation Plan (Closure Plan) was prepared by SRK (2014c) for the Project. The plan 
provides a conceptual level outline of the proposed closure activities and associated costs, and incorporates current 
best practices for rehabilitation and closure.  It incorporates facility rehabilitation options, strategies, and details 
pertaining to construction, operations, and final facility closure. This document was prepared as a component of the 
MIA.

20.4.1 Closure and Reclamation Plan 

The main processing facilities to be constructed and eventually closed include primary crushing, grinding, leaching, 
CCD thickeners, Merrill-Crowe processing, and refining facilities. The mining and waste disposal facilities will also 
include four open pits, two rock dumps, a temporary low-grade stockpile, and a TSF. In addition to the main processing 
facilities, there will be several surface buildings constructed to support the mining and process operations. These 
facilities include administration, laboratory, guardhouse, truck shop, warehouse, change house, explosives storage 
buildings, truck wash, and mill maintenance facilities.   

The conceptual closure plan outlines the following key activities: 

 Concurrent reclamation, where feasible, of the tailings embankment raise and disturbed land during 
operations; 

 Internal closure planning and closure-related engineering and characterization studies and permitting 
activities in the 1- to 3-year period prior to closure; 

 Decommissioning of equipment and management of salvageable, recyclable, and waste materials at closure; 
 Demolition of physical structures and management of infrastructure to be removed or that will remain; 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 
 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
  205 

 Earthworks regrading of the TSF, waste storage facilities, and plant area, as needed, to shed stormwater and 
re-establish natural drainages; 

 Reclamation and re-vegetation of disturbed land; and 
 Post-closure environmental monitoring and maintenance. 

At present it is anticipated that the post-closure land use will be wildlife habitat, grazing, and potential future mining of 
underground resources.  Undisturbed portions may also be used for dry farming uses. The areas of the open pits, 
tailings, and former plant site will be restricted from public access. 

The closure process will include decommissioning, demolition, and rehabilitation. The decommissioning process would 
initiate at the early stages of closure and would include the decommissioning of all cyanide materials and equipment.  
Appropriate methods would be put in place for decommissioning procedures for hazardous materials and equipment.  

The general reclamation process is to break/perforate and backfill foundations and sumps, recontour for positive 
drainage, cover with growth medium, re-establish natural drainages, and revegetate with native species.  Further details 
for closure procedures are explained in the Closure Plan (SRK, 2014c). The site closure and reclamation activities are 
estimated to take approximately three years assuming some concurrent reclamation. 

20.4.2 Post-Closure Period 

Post-closure requirements will be established based on a review of facility closure actions. A post-closure plan will be 
prepared at the time of closure to address post-closure maintenance and monitoring actions.  The plan will describe 
the sampling, monitoring, and inspection procedures to be followed after closure and to describe actions to be taken if 
a discharge results in exceedances of permissible limits, or if the physical stability of a facility deteriorates. Post-closure 
monitoring will include inspections of physical stability of remaining facilities and monitoring for environmental impacts.  
Annual site monitoring will be conducted for 10 years, or until compliance with applicable standards is achieved.  
Revegetation efforts will be monitored annually for at least 5 years after closure, or more depending on the revegetation 
study recommendations. 

20.4.3 Closure and Post-Closure Costs 

A reclamation and closure cost was estimated for third-party implementation of the closure process (SRK, 2014c).  The 
cost of closing the various mine facilities is a function of the closure design plan chosen for each facility. The life-of-
mine configuration of the facilities was used as the basis of this cost estimate; closure design plans will be prepared 
prior to closure. Rehabilitation of the major facilities was estimated in the cost estimate for the process plant, tailing 
impoundments, waste rock areas, infrastructure (buildings, roads, and landfill), contaminated areas, and utilities.   

A total reclamation and closure cost is presented in Table 20-5.  The table provides a summary of associated cost for 
the major mine facilities.  The estimated cost is approximately US$11.1 million with a contingency of +/- 20%, which 
applies to the closure cost (Item Nos. 1.00 through 6.00) and not to the post-closure care and maintenance (Item No., 
7.00).

20.6 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Progress has been made in the last year to address gaps in the site knowledge of pre-mining conditions, identify 
environmental liabilities, prepare documentation to support the site permits, and to prepare management plans to 
mitigate potential environmental impacts to the environment. Some studies are currently in progress and others remain 
to be done, or are planned for the future to support two MIA studies. Presented below are recommendations related to 
specific environmental studies or monitoring programs. These are designed to meet Mexican regulations and 
international environmental best management practices to reduce potential environmental impacts and risks to 
employees and nearby communities during operations and closure. 

20.6.1 Baseline Characterization Programs 

Baseline characterization programs need to be continued or initiated to document the pre-mine conditions as a 
requirement for the environmental permitting process (MIA) and to provide site information to refine the operational 
designs and management strategies. 

 Ambient Air Quality Monitoring 

 A pre-development dust characterization program will need to be implemented prior to site preparation, ideally 
commencing six months in advance of road-building or other construction activities and using a certified emissions 
laboratory. The baseline program should include PM 10 and PM 2.5 particulates monitoring in addition to total 
suspended solids. 

 Ambient Groundwater Monitoring  

Water quality monitoring has been performed on a number of wells in the local region. Water quality monitoring wells 
should be installed within the next few months at the Project site to characterize ambient groundwater quality and water 
levels prior to start up.  Sufficient sampling needs to be done to address potential variability on an annual or seasonal 
basis. 

 Surface Water and Stormwater Monitoring  

One set of surface water quality samples was collected in late 2013 from several local reservoirs. A second set of 
samples is recommended to establish the seasonal water quality of these man-made ponds and ephemeral washes 
such as during the rainy season. Collecting storm water samples in the ephemeral washes will require installation of 
sampling stations and equipment and the ability to mobilize a technician on short notice to take custody of the sample. 

 Data Management   

An environmental data management and reporting system should be implemented prior to start up to itemize sampling 
frequencies and requirements, inspection requirements, record results, and prepare routine reporting forms. All 
boreholes drilled on the site including exploration drillholes, geotechnical borings, and water wells (supply, dewatering, 
monitoring) should be entered into a unified drillhole database systems for use by operations and environmental staff. 

20.6.2 Additional Geochemical Testwork of Mining Wastes 

Additional samples, generated through metallurgical test work and of the future actual tailings, are recommended to 
confirm the geochemical behavior of the tailings materials. The samples could be composited by production years, 
dominant ore types, or other method to ensure representative samples are collected and analyzed.

The preliminary analysis of waste rock materials indicates that a percentage of the rock materials do have the potential 
to generate acidic rock drainage and contain metal concentrations that exceed dry base maximum permissible limits. 
However, when the materials were subjected to a leachate test (PECT), the analyses confirm the materials are not 
classified as dangerous owing to metals toxicity levels.  Kinetic testwork (humidity cells) is recommended on selected 
rock types to confirm that the rock materials will not generate acid or metal-bearing leachate that will require mitigation 
measures.  This will also confirm the suitability of the waste rock storage facilities as potential sources of non-toxic 
closure cover and rock armor materials.  

20.6.3 Archaeological Surveys 

The Project does not have archaeological features that may pose a cultural liability to mine development. However, 
the area does contain historic hunting grounds and rock artifacts that are commonly found in the region. An 
archaeological land survey will be completed by the INAH prior to site preparation. In the event that artifacts are 
detected, the survey will need to incorporate salvage activities prior to the intended land liberation resolution. 

20.6.4 Wildlife Management 

As part of the MIA study and permitting process, it is recommended that the Project develop a wildlife management 
program (protection, identification, monitoring, conflict prevention, relocation and identification of potential risks). The 
program should be appropriate for each stage of mine development. 

20.6.5 Forest Land Use Compensation 

The Project requires a change in forest land use (scrub forest) to mining land use; this will require the execution of 
internal compensation measures to ensure continuity of environmental services in the area, mostly by the application 
of reforestation parcels. It is highly recommended that the Project explores potential reforestation areas, ideally as a 
buffer zone to separate mining activities from agricultural land. It is anticipated that a large portion of land will be 
required in order to maintain forest cover equilibrium between mine development and surrounding areas. 

20.6.6 Reforestation Program 

Owing to the required surface area and reforestation intensity for the environmental compensation, it is advisable to 
design, install and operate an on-site plant nursery (Mezquite, Acacia and Pine species) with a plant production 
capacity that is adequate for each stage of project development as well as the inclusion adequate space for seedlings 
maintenance. 

20.6.7 Social and Community Engagement 

It is important for the Project to identify a communication strategy in order to monitor stakeholder development and 
dynamics. Additional mechanisms are recommended to inform the general public and specific groups about the mine 
development plans and to ensure an adequate mechanism to integrate stakeholders and maintain a positive equilibrium 
in terms of project acceptance. 

20.6.8 Land Ownership 

Addressing land ownership and legal documentation issues, especially for Ejido land, tends to be a cumbersome 
process that may require more time than originally anticipated. Each property and parcel needs adequate 
documentation / titles, the land owners need to be present, and internal proprietor disputes can halt certain transactions, 
and/or stimulate real estate speculation. The land ownership and documentation issues have the potential to delay 
submittal of and requests for MIA approvals so should receive priority attention.

21.3 BASIS OF ESTIMATE 

21.3.1 General Conditions and Parameters 

 General Costs 

The estimated costs are based on the Project being executed by experienced EPCM contractor(s) in the hard rock 
mining industry with a recent record of bringing projects on budget or under budget.  In addition, it is assumed that 
all contracts and subcontracts are based on a lump-sum basis or a competitively bid unit cost basis, such as per 
m3 of concrete placed.  In particular, no time and material contracts are anticipated, nor should they be allowed in 
order to ensure that this budget is best maintained. 

The general costs include the following: 

 Mobilization     0.5% of direct field costs 
 Bussing      $2.00 / manhour 
 Construction Power   0.25% of direct labor cost 
 EPCM Trailers with Utility Setup  0.2% of direct field cost 
 Owner Costs are listed based on data provided by the Project Manager 

For horizontal contracts in process areas, it is assumed that at least two sufficiently sized self-performing local 
contractors are in place for all trades, such as civil, concrete, steel, architectural, mechanical, electrical, 
instrumentation and controls, and process piping.  Certain contractors will have multiple trade capabilities. 

The estimate assumes that vertical contracts encompassing all trades will be the method of execution for ancillary 
buildings such as labs and offices.  Often smaller local contractors are suitable for this effort. 

Sanitary facilities will be provided by contractor.  Any existing or newly constructed facilities are for PMLP's use 
and in general will not be available to construction personnel. 

No allowance has been made for fire protection during construction. PMLP will provide security services, access 
to construction water, communication links, and power for the contractors.  The contractors will provide their own 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 
 

 

 M3-PN130128

  218 

communication system, equipment and radio frequencies.  The contractors are responsible for their own drinking 
water and portable toilets, all utility hookups (e.g., satellite communications and power into construction trailer), 
delivery of construction water, all construction (portable or temporary) power. 

PMLP will not supply any construction equipment (such as forklifts and crane for unloading or water trucks for dust 
suppression) to the Project. 

The construction site will be available to contractors 24 hours per day Monday morning through Saturday 
afternoon. 

It has been assumed that construction work areas would be accessible during all scheduled working hours.  
Allowance is not included in this estimate for stand-by time for inefficiencies resulting from work stoppages or 
interferences initiated by operations or revisions. 

Contractors can have trailers and laydown yards in designated areas near the construction site.  Construction 
personnel can park their construction vehicles in designated areas near the construction site.  Personal vehicles 
will be parked near the contractor designated gate and personnel bused to the site by the contractors. 

The contractors are responsible for all receiving of materials and equipment supplied by them.  Any such items 
that have been received prior to construction, and received by EPCM or PMLP, must be loaded and transported 
to the construction site from the receiving area by the contractors responsible for installation of the equipment.  In 
general, PMLP personnel will not receive shipments. 

Contractors shall be responsible for security of received material including supply and preparation of fenced areas. 

Contractors shall be responsible for quality control of safety.  The EPCM shall be responsible for quality assurance 
of safety. 

Conversion rates used in this estimate to convert from foreign currencies to US Dollars were: 

1.00 US Dollar equals 0.72 Euros 
1.00 US Dollar equals 13 Mexican Pesos 
1.00 US Dollar equals 1.08 Canadian Dollar 

 
 Labor  

Labor rates are based on prevailing merit shop wages.  The costs for indirect labor hours as well as any contractor 
profit are captured in the direct labor hour rates. Craft labor has been estimated at the following overall average 
rates.

 Material Take-off and Field Labor 

Material unit prices for the project were developed using costs gained through contacts with local regional 
suppliers, information from recently constructed projects and M3 in-house data. 

Civil work quantities of general excavation, grading and backfill were taken off the site plot plan, general 
arrangement drawings and grading plans.  In mountainous and hilly areas, in the absence of better information, 
the top 5 m of excavation has been assumed to be rippable, and thereafter blasting has been assumed.  In alluvial 
areas, normal excavations were assumed.  Takeoffs are broken into the categories of alluvium, rippable, and 
blastable.  The civil engineering department performs rough grading takeoffs and the structural department 
handles foundation excavations and finish grading.  The following factors are typically used on neat quantities.  
These are to be added by engineering and clearly spelled out. 

a. Major Excavations   add 5% 
b. Finish grading    add 50% 
c. "Small" building foundation excavations add 100% 
d. Roads including sub-base and graveling add 10% 

Construction borrow material sources are assumed to be located within 6 kms.  Excess borrow material haulage 
is not included.  Bulk fill material will be supplied by Coeur with material from pre-production stripping. 

Tailings core fill is by PMLP, supplied in 2 m lifts at a cost of $2.00 per m3. 

Road construction by PMLP is included in direct charges. 

Tailings MTO supplied by PMLP's representative (KP). 

Civil miscellaneous items include:

21.3.3 Mine Capital Basis 

Estimated mining capital costs are summarized in Table 21-4.  Contingency is not included in mining costs. 

 Cost Basis 

The costs listed in Table 21-4 for all the major equipment were based on vendor supplied quotes and most of the 
minor equipment is based on historical quotes and estimates.  Much of the historical cost information was current 
during 2013 and 2014.  Older quotes for minor units were inflated as required. 

Equipment quotes were received from several vendors, including Caterpillar, Komatsu, Atlas Copco and Sandvik.  
Quotes included delivery to the mine site, erection, import duties and taxes.   

Equipment supplied under contracted blasting and tire service was not included in this estimate.  The equipment 
from the explosives vendor includes the supply of ANFO storage tanks, powder and cap magazine buildings, and 
the explosives delivery vehicle.  Under the tire service contract, tire handling equipment will be supplied by the 
vendor.

 Mine Capital Costs 

The mining equipment capital costs are based the major mining equipment required for the pre-production year 
and the first three years of operations being leased for a five-year term.  At the end of the lease, the leased 
equipment is purchased, with the exception of the 994 loader and the 390D excavator. Details for the proposed 
capital costs, are not included due to the proprietary nature of those costs.  Equipment requirements during the 
first four years is also included as an operating cost. The lease costs were calculated from the equipment list 
shown on Table 16-8. Escalation and contingency are not included in capital costs.  Lease costs are discussed in 
the operating cost summary. 

Mine capital costs include: 

1. The mine mobile equipment fleet. 
2. An allowance for initial shop tools. 
3. An allowance for initial spare parts inventory. 
4. Mine engineering equipment (computers, survey equipment etc.). 
5. Mine communication network & system. 

Mine capital costs do not include: 

1. Mine office buildings, or shop facilities.  They are included elsewhere in the project capital list. 
2. Mobile equipment that is not required by the mine. (i.e. no mobile units for the plant) 
3. Infrastructure or process plant related costs. 

A capital cost build up was created that includes the capital purchase of major and minor mining equipment.  The 
table is not included due to the confidentiality of the majority of those costs.  End-of-lease capital and costs were 
included in the capital cost estimates as a residual purchase.  

21.3.4 Tailing Basis of Estimate 

The principal objective of the TSF design is to ensure protection of the environment during operations and following 
mine closure.  The design of the TSF takes into account the following requirements:  

 Safe and secure long-term management of tailings and water  
 Control, collection, preservation and removal of free draining water from the tailings during operations, 

for; 
 Recycling as process water to the maximum extent practical  
 The inclusion of monitoring features within the facility to ensure performance goals are achieved and 

design  
 Criteria and assumptions are met; and  
 Secure reclamation and closure of the impoundment after mining is complete 

The TSF design will include an initial starter embankment and ongoing raises throughout the life of the facility.   

This offers a number of advantages as follows:  

 The ability to reduce capital costs and defer some capital expenditures until the mine is operating.  
 The ability to refine design, construction and operating methodologies as experience is gained with local 

conditions and constraints.  
 The ability to adjust plans at a future date to remain current with evolving best practice (engineering and 

environmental).

  224 

 To allow the observational approach to be utilized in the ongoing design, construction and operation of 
the facility.  The observational approach can deliver substantial cost savings and a high level of safety.  
It also enhances knowledge and understanding of site-specific conditions.   

Two embankments will be constructed to establish the TSF, including a main embankment along the south side 
of the basin and a smaller embankment constructed later at the north side of the basin.  Natural topographical 
containment will form the northeast and west sides of the TSF.  The TSF design section will include an initial starter 
embankment (Stage 1) for the south embankment with ongoing raises completed for the south and north 
embankments using centerline construction methods throughout the life of the facility.  The initial starter 
embankment at the south, will be constructed of zoned rockfill with a composite liner on the upstream slope.  The 
centerline raises will consist of zoned rockfill with a low permeability core zone.  Transition zones will be 
established between the core zone and the embankment rockfill to ensure internal stability.  The Stage 1 TSF will 
provide storage for two (2) years of tailings deposition.   

The cost basis uses the feasibility design MTO's provided by Knight Piésold and estimated costs by M3 based on 
typical contractor costs in Mexico. The initial capital expenditure for the first stage of tailings operation is included 
in the initial capital cost estimate.  Costs are based on a qualified contractor performing preparation, excavation, 
minor haulage, and compaction of materials.  The cost basis for the core of the tailings dam assumes suitable 
material from the pre-stripping of waste material from the Abundancia pit and placed into 2 m lifts, spread by 
contractor, and compacted with the aid of the heavy haulage equipment.  The supply cost for this material is $2 
per m3 placed.  Similarly, a limited amount of suitable materials will be excavated from the core of the tailings 
impoundment by the Coeur.  

Tailings pipelines, and recovered water piping and pumps, as well as earthwork for access roadways is included 
in the M3 estimate. 

The feasibility design by Knight Piésold provides for up to 17 years of productive mine life, although eleven were 
used for the feasibility economic model.  The tailings construction is planned for 8 phases, and the unit costs 
similar to the initial capital cost and applied to the sustaining capital in the economic model.   

21.3.5 Indirect Cost Basis of Estimate 

EPCM indirect costs are factored as percentages of constructed costs, which include direct costs, plus 
mobilization, plus any construction facilities and utilities:

21.4 OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COST ESTIMATE 

The operating cost estimate was developed for the Project in support of 10,000 tpd milling operation and a pit 
design optimized to maximize economic grade and tonnes.   

21.4.1 Mine Operating Cost Summary 

Mine operating costs estimates are based on first principals for the scheduled production, equipment lease 
requirements, operating hours, hourly equipment operating costs, and manpower requirements. Mine operating 
costs were developed based on first principals for the mine plan and the equipment list.  Neither escalation nor 
contingency are included in operating costs. 

It is expected that the mining fleet will be leased for a 5 year period with an option to purchase after the lease has 
expired. Sustaining capital includes the purchase of the leased mining fleet after the 5th year. The unit costs for 
mining labor were developed based on labor rates for Coeur's Palmarejo mine.  Fuel costs were set at $0.77 USD 
per liter based on publically available price forecasts, excluding VAT. 

The annual lease payments have been shown as a line item in the Financial Model in Table 22-8 starting in Year 
-1 of mine operations.  The preproduction cost of mine equipment due to the equipment leased during that time is 
included in the cash flow as a capitalized expense.  The details of the lease costs are in operating expenses and 
were developed based on discussions with vendors that Coeur has had business relationships with in the past.  
The details are not presented here due to the confidential nature of those costs. 

The mine plan stipulates that all ore will be mined on 5 m bench heights and most of the waste will be mined on 
10 m bench heights.  The amount of waste mined on 5 m benches is equivalent to 150% of the ore on each bench. 
The total material mined on 5 m benches equals 250% of all ore. 

The equipment selection has been designed to accommodate the two bench heights (5 m and 10 m).  The drilling 
equipment was split into two different size drill fleets and paired with each bench height.  The drill fleet requirements 
were calculated based on the amount material mined on each bench height.  The shovel requirements are applied 
only to the 10 m bench waste material.  The front end loader is applied to 5 m benches in pit, stockpiles and will 
occasionally assist with the 10 m waste benches as needed.  A large excavator will also assist with the extraction 
of 5 m ore.  

Table 21-8 summarizes the total mine operating cost per time period along with the total mine capital cost.  This 
table should provide a clear indication of the mine operating costs by year of operation.

Table 21-9 summarizes the mine operating costs by the unit operations per time period.  Preproduction is 
established to be 12 months in duration operating 1 shift/day.  The cost per tonne in all periods is based on the 
total tonnage moved within the mine plan. 

The estimated mine operating costs include: 

1. Drilling, blasting, loading, and hauling of material from the mine to the crusher, low grade stockpile or 
waste storage facilities.  Maintenance of the waste storage areas and stockpiles is included in the mining 
costs.  Maintenance of mine mobile equipment is included in the operating costs.   

2. Mine supervision, mine engineering, mine safety/emergency team, environmental team, geology and ore 
control are included in the G&A category. 

3. Operating labor and maintenance labor for the mine mobile equipment are included. 
4. Contractor cost for tire service is included in the general mine maintenance cost. 
5. The contracted cost for the blasting supplied and for the blasting related equipment (i.e. ANFO/slurry 

truck, stemmer and explosive storage tanks) is included in the blasting operating cost. 
6. Mine access road construction and maintenance is included.  If mine haul trucks drive on the road, its 

cost and maintenance is included in the mine operating costs. 
7. The small stockpile (958 ktonnes) that is generated during preproduction stripping is re-handed to the 

plant in Years 1 & 2. 
8. The low grade stockpile (3,930 ktonnes) that is generated until year four is re-handled to the plant as 

needed throughout the mine life.  The cost of re-mining the low grade stockpile is included in the operating 
costs. 

9. A general mine allowance is included that is intended to cover mine pumping costs and general operating 
supplies that cannot be assigned to one of the unit operations.  Included in the general mine cost is an 
allowance for ore control assaying, dispatch software, mine planning software, general labor and dispatch 
personnel cost. 

10. The excavator operating costs include an allocation that is equivalent to moving 1/2 of the ore.  However, 
the actual loading and hauling costs for ore are based on the loader productivity.

11. A general maintenance allowance is included that is intended to cover the general operating supplies of 
the maintenance group. 

12. Allocations have been made for 10% wet hole blasting, a mine communications network and 10% for 
VS&A.   

13. Haul truck fleet and operating requirements were based on haul time simulation.  Haul profiles for input 
to simulation were measured from mine plans provided by Coeur.   

IMC assisted Coeur with the development of the equipment requirements, operating and capital costs.  The final 
selection and application of mining costs were established by Coeur personnel.  The mine schedule was provided 
to IMC in several iterations. Haul profiles were measured from "Mineplan4".  Later, the mine plan was updated and 
insufficient detail was available to update the haul profiles. The profiles applied to the truck requirements do not 
have a direct correlation to mine schedule but are a reasonable approximation to the haulage schedule developed.  

The schedule that was used to determine the truck requirements did not maintain access to all working phases of 
the mine.  The following assumptions were applied to resolve instances when access was cut off. 

The mine operating costs in Table 21-9 do not include: 

1. Lease costs for mine major and mobile equipment. A breakdown of the mine equipment, which is 
assumed to be leased, including lease costs.  

2. Crushing, conveying or processing. 
3. Road base material, man camp cost or travel expenses.   
4. Reclamation recontouring costs. 
5. IVA [Mexian Value Added Tax (VAT)] taxes. 
6. A small auxiliary excavator for projects. 

The mine is planned to work 2 shifts per day for 365 days per year.  Five days (10 shifts) of loss time are assumed 
due to weather delays. The mine will operate using 3 crews.

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 INTRODUCTION 

The financial evaluation presents the determination of the projected NPV, payback period (time in years to recapture 
the initial capital investment), and the IRR for the Project.  Annual cash flow projections were estimated over the life of 
the mine based on the estimates of capital expenditures and production cost and sales revenue.  The sales revenue 
is based on the production of silver and gold bullion.  The estimates of capital expenditures and site production costs 
have been developed specifically for the Project and have been presented in earlier sections of this report.   

22.2 MINE PRODUCTION STATISTICS 

Mine production is reported as mineralized material and overburden from the mining operation.  The annual production 
figures were obtained from the mine plan as reported earlier in this Report. 

The life of mine mineralized material quantities and mineralized material grades are presented Table 22-1.

Low Grade Mineralized material 3,930 0.07 45.00 

Waste 583,674   

The table displays material mined, it does not display material re-handled from stockpile. The mined material is either 
placed on the stockpile or fed directly to the plant. 

22.3 PLANT PRODUCTION STATISTICS 

The design basis for the process plant is 10,000 tonnes per day at 92% mill availability.  The recoveries are projected 
to average for the life of the mine as follows: 

 Gold   61.0% 
 Silver  84.0% 

 The estimated life of mine metal production is presented in Table 22-2.

22.3.2 Capital Expenditure 

 Initial Capital  

The financial indicators have been determined assuming internal financing and leasing of the mine mobile equipment 
for the initial capital.  Any acquisition cost or expenditures prior to start of the full Project period have been treated as 
"sunk" cost and have not been included in the analysis. 

The total initial capital carried in the financial model for new construction and pre-production mine development is 
$327M expended over a 2 year period.  The initial capital includes all pre-production capital expenditures for design, 
procurement and construction of project facilities, including owner's costs and contingency.  The cash flow will be 
expended in the years before production and a small amount carried over into the first production year.   

The initial capital includes all pre-production capital expenditures for design, procurement and construction of project 
facilities, including owner's costs and contingency. Declaration of commercial production is defined as at the end of the 
third consecutive month of 60% of nameplate or greater mill tonnage throughput.  

The initial capital is presented in Table 22-4.

  $ in millions 

Mining (includes preproduction)  $53.0 

Process Plant $262.4 

Owner's Cost  $12.2 

Total  $327.6   

 
22.3.3 Sustaining Capital 

A schedule of capital cost expenditures during the production period was estimated and included in the financial 
analysis under the category of sustaining capital.  The total life of mine sustaining capital is estimated to be $126.6 
million.  This capital will be expended during an 11 year period.  

22.3.4 Working Capital 

All working capital is recaptured at the end of the mine life and the final value of these accounts is $0.  During the mine 
life, working capital is comprised of the following components:  



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 
 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
  236 

Trade Receivables:  Receipts on doré sales are assumed to be received 15 days after revenue recognition.  

Supplies Inventory: An allowance of $3.0 million for plant consumable inventory is estimated in each of years -1 and 
1.  It is assumed that this stock will remain constant throughout the production life.   

Trade and Other Accounts Payable: Trade payables are equal to 30 days of annual non-labor expenditures.   

The year-to-year working capital impacts are shown in the cash flow model in Table 22-8.  

22.3.5 Salvage Value 

An allowance for salvage value has been included in the cash flow analysis of approximately $11.4 million.  

22.3.6 IVA Taxes 

The VAT tax (in Spanish, the "Impuesto al Valor Agregado" (IVA)) is assumed to be recovered within the year spent 
and was not included in the cash flow. 

22.3.7 Revenue 

Annual revenue is determined by applying estimated metal prices to the annual payable metal estimated for each 
operating year.  Sales prices have been applied to all life of mine production without escalation or hedging.  The 
revenue is the gross value of payable metals sold before treatment charges and transportation charges.  Metal sales 
prices used in the evaluation are as follows: 

 Gold  $1,350.00/ounce 
 Silver  $22.00/ounce 

These price assumptions are considered conservative compared to allowances made for calculating NI 43-101 metal 
price assumptions.  This model allows 60% for an average of previous 36 month metal pricing and 40% component 
based on futures forecasts for 24 months. 

22.3.8 Exchange Rate 

Currency used in this report is in United States dollars. The Mexican peso (MXN) to United States dollar (USD) forecast 
exchange rate was determined based on publicly published forecasts by leading US and Canadian financial institutions.   
Within the financial model, exchange rate was assumed to equal 13$MXN per $USD.  

22.4 TOTAL OPERATING COST 

The total operating cost over the life of the mine is estimated to be $43.32 per tonne of mineralized material processed, 
excluding the cost of the capitalized pre-stripping.  The total operating cost includes mine operations, process plant 
operations, general administrative cost, refining charges and shipping charges.  The table below shows the estimated 
total operating cost by area per metric tonne of mineralized material processed.

  Equipment Lease $3.08 

  Process Plant $14.70 

  General Administration $2.33 

  Refining Charges $0.69 

  Total Operating Cost  $43.32 

22.5 TOTAL PRODUCTION COST 

The average Total Cash Production Cost over the life of the mine is estimated to be $45.59 per tonne of mineralized 
material processed.  Total Cash Production Cost is the Total Operating Cost plus royalty, salvage value, reclamation 
and closure costs, and the new mining royalties.  Total Production Costs which includes depreciation plus the Total 
Cash Production Cost equals $57.76 per tonne of mineralized material processed. 

22.5.1 Mining Royalties 

Production costs include two mining royalty taxes: 

 A 7.5% royalty tax has been applied to include income from mining activities. The tax is  calculated on a basis 
of earnings before interest, income taxes,  depreciation and amortization (i.e. EBITDA),  

 a  0.5% royalty tax has been applied on revenue from precious metals 

Both of these taxes are assumed to be deductible against income before the calculation of corporate income tax. 

22.5.2 Net Smelter Return Royalty 

The purchase of the NSR royalty by Coeur is treated as a capital cost for the purposes of this evaluation. 

22.5.3 Reclamation and Closure 

An allowance for reclamation and closure was included in year 12 of the cash flow of $15.7 million. 

22.5.4 Salvage Value 

At end of the mine life an estimated salvage value was shown of $11.4 million which was based on 10% of the cost of 
capital equipment. 

22.6 TAXATION 

22.6.1 Income Tax 

The corporate income tax rate of 30% in effect in Mexico for 2014 was included in the economic model.  This is applied 
to net profits of the company.   

Income taxes paid over the life of the mine are estimated to be $102.1 million. 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 
 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
  238 

22.6.2 Depreciation for Tax 

Capital expenditures are assumed to be depreciated for calculation of Mexican Corporate Income Tax on a straight 
line basis over a ten year period. 

22.6.3 Tax Loss Carry Forward Balances  

Tax loss carry forwards for Mexican corporate income tax purposes equal to $39.5 million MXN are available (with 
varying expiry periods) as at the start of the construction period. Tax losses can be carried forward for a period of ten 
years. 

22.6.4 Inflation/Deflation of Asset Balance  

The financial model is computed in real dollars.  Accordingly, in the financial model, zero inflation or deflation is 
applied to calculations of depreciable asset balances and loss carry forwards.  (In accordance with Mexican 
income tax laws, depreciable asset balances and loss carry forwards will increase each year based upon 
inflation and therefore retain their full value in real terms).  

22.7 EXCLUDED COSTS  

Sunk costs (e.g. drilling costs and corporate overheads) incurred prior to project construction commencement are 
excluded from the economic analysis. 

22.8 BONUS/PROFIT SHARING  

Profit sharing is not applied to the Project.  

22.9 PROJECT FINANCING 

The Project is assumed to be internally financed, with the exception of the mining mobile equipment, which is financed 
for 5 years and then purchased.  

22.10 NET INCOME AFTER TAX 

Net income after tax amount over the life of the Project is estimated to be $240.6 million.   

22.11 NET PRESENT VALUE, INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN, PAYBACK 

The economic analysis indicates that the Project has an NPV using a 5% discount rate of $87.6 million and a projected 
IRR of 9.5%. Payback of the initial capital occurs at a period of 6.9 years after commencement of commercial 
production. Over the life of the Project, cash operating costs are $15.29/oz payable silver and production costs of 
$20.38/oz payable silver.  

22.12 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS  

Table 22-6 compares the base case project financial indicators with the financial indicators when different variables 
are applied.  By comparing the results it can be seen that the metal prices have the most impact on the Project while 
the capital and operating cost have a lesser impact.

24 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

24.1 PROJECT EXECUTION PLAN 

24.1.1 Introduction 

This section of the Report provides the outline for the Project Execution Plan which forms part of the framework for the 
project schedule and capital cost estimate.  The execution plan covers the period post feasibility and application of 
environmental permitting, and finishing with plant commissioning and reaching full production.   

Going forward, Coeur will advance the Project by completing a number of tasks (Figure 24-1). These include receiving 
permits and Environmental Assessment (MIA) to construct and operate the mine and finally constructing the mine site.   

The major assumptions for execution of the Project include the following: 

 Coeur Board of Director approval for expenditure prior to advancing this project. 
 Rights-of-way and land rights are finalized for the Project prior to construction activities. 
 All construction and environmental permits required to commence construction are in place. 
 Adequate project financing is in place at the start of construction. 
 Basic engineering is started a minimum of six months prior to initiating construction of major earthwork 

aspects. 
 Major equipment specifications and procurement are prepared in the first three months of basic engineering 

so that vendor certified drawings can be obtained and long-lead items can begin manufacture. 
 Construction contracts are developed for earthworks and civil concrete during basic design. Contracts are bid 

and subsequently awarded four to six months after design begins. 
 The power line and fresh water system are designed, bid and awarded midway through basic engineering. 
 The access road is constructed immediately after environmental approval. 
 Construction water is sourced from new wells near the site. Construction power is supplied by diesel-fired 

generators until power is available from the power line. 
 Separate contracts are awarded for earthworks, concrete, structural steel erection, mechanical installation, 

electrical installation, instrumentation and controls. Unit quantity bids will largely be employed.  Contracts may 
or may not be with the same contractor (i.e. mechanical/electrical).  

 An EPCM construction approach will be utilized as outlined above.

24.1.2 Description 

The project execution plan describes, at a high level, how the Project will be carried out. This plan contains an overall 
description of what the main work focuses are, Project organization, the estimated schedule, and where important 
aspects of the Project will be carried out. 

The project execution plan proposed incorporates an integrated strategy for EPCM. The primary objective of the 
execution methodology is to deliver the Project at the lowest capital cost, on schedule, and consistent with the Project 
standards for quality, safety, and environmental compliance. 

24.1.3 Objectives 

The Project execution plan has been established with the following objectives: 

 To maintain the highest standard of safety so as to prevent incidents and accidents; 
 To design and construct a process plant, together with the associated infrastructure, that is cost-effective, 

achieves performance specifications and is built to high quality standards; 
 To design and operate the mine using proven methodologies and equipment; 
 To optimize the project schedule to achieve an operating plant in the most efficient and timely manner within 

the various constraints placed upon the Project; and 
 To comply with the requirements of the conditions for the construction and operating license approvals. 

24.1.4 Plan of Approach 

 Philosophy 

This section describes the execution plan for advancing the Project from the current Feasibility Report stage to 
production. The project execution plan will ensure that key project processes and procedures are in place that will: 

 Develop a project schedule from completion of the feasibility study through permitting, construction and 
commissioning; 

 Consider significant project logistics; 
 Develop and implement site communications, construction infrastructure, and water supply for an early and 

efficient startup; 
 Plan for early construction mobilization; 
 Develop and execute project control procedures and processes; 
 Perform constructability reviews; 
 Define Work Breakdown Structure (WBS); 
 Implement project accounting and cost control best practices suitable for downstream owner usage; 
 Issue a cost control plan and a control budget, and monitored continually; and 
 Oversee project accounting. 

Coeur intends to utilize an EPCM approach utilizing multiple hard money and low unit cost prime contracts for 
construction management, as the recommended method for executing the Project. The capital cost estimate is based 
on this methodology. The Project is located in an area with sufficient qualified contractors, and experienced mining 
personnel.  Construction is to be performed by Mexican companies, normally with at least two such companies for 
each of the skill trades. 

Mine development pre-production work activities as well as site road construction will be performed by Coeur. 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 
 

 

 M3-PN130128

Some usual items which could affect the Project are: 

 Ability to start work early that does not require significant engineering; e.g., civil rough grading; 
 Experience of the qualified firms considered and their typical and proposed approach; and 
 An approach that utilizes the best resources available (matching contractors to the size of each contract). 

An EPCM approach is the basis for the capital cost estimate.  This approach provides for contracts that would include 
the skill trades of civil, concrete, structural steel, mechanical, piping, electrical and instrumentation. 

The majority of mechanical and electrical equipment required for the Project will be procured within North America. 
Concrete and building construction materials will be sourced locally in northern Mexico. Structural and miscellaneous 
steel, piping, tanks, electrical and miscellaneous process equipment will be sourced within Mexico, to the extent 
practical. 

The Coeur PMO group will generally provide corporate level project oversight and control through the process of 
detailed engineering / construction / and project hand-off to operations.  Important duties of the PMO will include, but 
not be limited to such things as monitoring adherence to accepted Coeur procurement (and other general business, 
safety, environmental, ethics, etc.) policies, engineering approvals, inspection and approval of work completed, 
management of change requests, reporting of project earned value and schedule performance, contract management, 
and verification and final approval of contractor invoices for payment. 

The PMO will coordinate monitoring project performance using Primavera P6 with an interface to the Coeur's Oracle 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. 

The PMO, comprised of an anticipated four to six Coeur employees, most likely stationed at the project site and 
Durango office, will form the staff of the vice president accountable for project delivery. 

 Engineering 

The detailed engineering schedule is based on interim approval to be granted in early basic engineering starting in Q1 
Y-2, and full EPCM release in Q3 Y-2. The design is scheduled to be 60% complete by the end of Q4 Y-2. Engineering 
will be completed upon receipt of all pertinent vendor data.  

Engineering will be done to match the plant protocol for drawing titles, equipment numbers and area numbers. Design 
will produce drawings in metric format. Preliminary drawings and specifications will be done in English, while field 
specifications approved for construction will be in dual versions with Spanish prevailing contractually.  

A site conditions specification will be done to ensure that vendors are aware of the site conditions.  Individual equipment 
specifications will be done. Individual equipment specifications will be based on performance requirements plus 
minimum hardware requirements. 

Engineering control will be maintained through drawing lists, specification lists, equipment lists, pipeline lists and 
instrument lists. Control of Engineering Requisitions for Quote will be performed through an anticipated purchase orders 
list. Progress will be tracked through the use of the lists mentioned. 

Concrete reinforcing steel drawings will be done using customary bar available in Mexico.  Reinforcing bar will be fully 
detailed to allow either site or shop fabrication.  Shop fabrication is usually preferred due to delivery and cost 
advantages.

Structural steel will be detailed by the EPCM contractor using 3D computer aided design software (e.g. TEKLA). 
Mechanical steel will be detailed by the EPCM utilizing a similar approach. This will allow fabrication of steel prior to 
the award of steel installation contracts. 

Coeur review of engineering progress and design philosophy will be a continuous process. 

 Procurement 

Procurement of long delivery equipment and materials is scheduled with their relevant engineering tasks.  This will 
ensure that the appropriate vendor information is incorporated into the design drawings and that the equipment will be 
delivered to site and supports the overall project schedule.  Particular emphasis will be placed on procuring the material 
and contract services required to establish the temporary construction infrastructure required for the construction 
program. 

Under general supervision of Coeur, procurement of major process equipment will be by the EPCM contractor, acting 
as Agent for Coeur through the use of owner approved purchase order forms. This will include all of the equipment in 
the equipment list as well as all of the instruments in the instrument list.  Some instruments will be part of vendor 
equipment packages. In addition, structural steel, electrical panels, electrical lighting, major cable quantities, specialty 
valves and special pipe will be purchased.  Contractors will be responsible for the purchase of common materials only. 

The EPCM contractor will establish a list of recommended pre-qualified vendors for each major item of equipment for 
approval by Coeur. The EPCM contractor will prepare the tender documents, issue the equipment packages for the 
bid, prepare a technical and commercial evaluation, and issue a letter of recommendation for purchase for approval by 
Coeur. Coeur through the assistance of the EPCM contractor will conduct the commercial negotiations with the 
recommended vendor and advise the EPCM contractor of the negotiated terms for preparation of the purchase 
documents. When approved, the EPCM contractor will issue the purchase order, track the order, and expedite the 
engineering information and formally accept delivery of the equipment to the site maintaining care custody and control 
of the equipment until it is turned over to the installation contractor. 

Major equipment may be sourced on a world-wide basis, assessed on the best delivered price and delivery schedule, 
fit-for-purpose basis. Equipment and bulk material suppliers will be selected via a competitive bidding process. 

Equipment will be typically purchased FOB at the point of manufacture for domestic suppliers or nearest shipping port 
for international shipments.  The EPCM working in association with Coeur's logistics coordinator will arrange all 
shipments of equipment and materials for the Project and arrange for ocean and overland freight to the job site. 

The EPCM contractor will be responsible for the receipt of the major equipment and materials at site; with the quantities 
and conditions of the items received reviewed and accepted by a representative of the Company's PMO.  The EPCM 
contractor will manage and care and custody of materials until the equipment and materials are turned over to the 
installation contractor for storage and safe keeping until installed.  Bulk piping and electrical materials and some minor 
equipment will be made part of the construction contracts, and as such will be supplied by the various construction 
contractors. It is expected that each construction contractor provide for the receipt, storage, and distribution of materials 
and minor equipment they purchased. 

 Inspection 

The EPCM contractor will be responsible to conduct QA/QC inspections for major equipment during the fabrication 
process to ensure the quality of manufacture and adherence to specifications. Levels of inspection for major equipment 
will be identified during the bidding stage, which may range from receipt and review of the manufacturer's quality control 
procedures to visits to the vendor's shops for inspection and witnessing of shop tests prior to shipment of the 
equipment. Where possible, third-party independent inspectors close to the point of fabrication will be contracted to

perform this service in order to minimize the travel cost for the Project. Some assistance will be provided by the EPCM 
engineering design team if and as required.  The EPCM shall ensure a qualified person performs inspection of major 
components. 

 Expediting and Logistics 

The EPCM contractor will also be responsible to expedite the receipt of vendor drawings to support the engineering 
effort as well as expediting the fabrication and delivery of major equipment to the site.  An expediting report will be 
issued at regular intervals outlining the status of each purchase order in order to alert the Project of any delays in the 
expected shipping date or issue of critical vendor drawings. Corrective action will be taken to mitigate any delay. 

The EPCM contractor will also be responsible to coordinate the logistic of the equipment and material shipments from 
point of manufacture to site, including international shipments through customs. 

 Project Services 

The EPCM contractor will be responsible for management and control of all Project service activities and ensure that 
the team has appropriate resources to accomplish Coeur's objectives.  Coeur will provide corporate level oversight 
through a PMO. 

24.1.5 Construction 

 Construction Methodology  

The construction program is scheduled to start in in the third quarter after commencing basic engineering. Contract bid 
calls will start in in the second quarter following commencement of basic engineering. The work includes clearing and 
grubbing of the plant site, mass earthwork for site development, project access road and in-plant roads. Concrete 
foundations and underground utilities for the process buildings and other support structures will be constructed 
beginning in early Q2 Y-1. 

Construction work is scheduled for 18 months from ground breaking to the commencement of commissioning.  
Earthworks for process facilities will commence as soon as the contractor can be mobilized to the field, after tall required 
permits have been obtained.  This work will include surface water control diversions, process building foundations and 
tailings facilities. 

 Construction Management 

Construction Management will be performed by the EPCM contractor using prime contracts for civil/concrete and 
structural/mechanical/electrical/piping/instrumentation. The contracting plan is based on utilizing local contractors to 
execute the construction work packages to minimize mobilization and travel costs. The EPCM contractor will pre-qualify 
local contractors and prepare tender documents to bid and select the most qualified contractor for the various work 
packages. Some work packages will include the design, supply, and erection for specific facilities which are specialized 
in nature. The EPCM contractor team will be comprised of  individuals capable of coordinating the construction effort, 
supervising and inspecting the work, performing field engineering functions, administering contracts, managing 
warehouse and material management functions, and performing cost control and schedule control functions.  These 
activities will be under the direction of a Coeur resident construction manager and a team of engineers, supervisors, 
and technicians. There would also be a commissioning team to do final checkout of the Project. Some site services will 
be contracted to third party specialists, working under the direction of the resident EPCM construction manager. 
Construction service contracts identified at this time include the following: 

 Field survey services; 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 
 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
  248 

 QA/QC testing services 
 Concrete 
 Welding and x-ray 
 bolt torque 
 instrument calibration 

There would also be a commissioning team to do final checkout of the Project. The commissioning stages from 
mechanical completion to startup are as follows.   
 

 Mechanical Completion – Mechanical Completion consists of the confirmation of fabrication, assembly and 
nonfunctional testing of a specific system(s) or facility to confirm the integrity of the construction and 
installation.  Verification of system(s) or facilities mechanical completion includes confirmation that the final 
construction is in accordance with the project drawings, specifications, and industry standards as well as all 
regulatory requirements from any authorities having jurisdiction. 

Small-scale operational checks such as bumping motors, circuit checks, piping/instrumentation valves and 
controls and dry running (without any processing or test material) of  conveyors and other equipment are  also 
included.  Mechanical Completion is the precursor to the Pre-Commissioning and Commissioning stages of a 
project. 

 Pre-Commissioning – Pre-commissioning activities are preliminary efforts to test and check the individual 
units, systems and/or sub-systems within a logical area (Filter Press within Area 100 is one example).  This 
is done to ensure that the components of any given system and/or sub-system perform as designed.  An 
activity essential to the pre-commissioning process is the testing with water or other liquids of those systems 
and/or sub-systems that contain a process flow during facility operations. 

 Mechanical Completion Punch List – The Mechanical Completion Punch List is a list of items (structural, 
mechanical, piping, electrical, and instrumentation) that were found to be deficient or incomplete during the 
Pre-Commissioning testing and checking phase.  During this phase these problems will be corrected and 
indicated as such on the punch list.  When punch list items are complete, they should be logged and so 
indicated to ensure the full functionality of the items/systems before Commissioning.  All punch list work should 
be complete including any additional work requested by the Coeur (where possible) prior to commencement 
of the Commissioning phase. 

 Commissioning – The Commissioning phase follows completion of the Pre-Commissioning activities 
performed by the Contractors and other Pre-Commissioning team members.  Commissioning involves testing, 
checking and start-up at the system-level.  Commissioning occurs prior to the facility actually becoming 
operational.  Commissioning entails running and testing all areas of each system to ensure the system 
performs as anticipated and to correct any remaining problems prior to Plant Operational Start-up.  Testing 
and calibration of the facility occurs with water only.  Material handling systems, including conveyor belts, are 
run empty.  

 Start-up – Start-up constitutes the commencement of actual plant operations.  During the Start-up phase, 
systems that were tested in isolation in the Commissioning phase are initialized together so that product may 
be introduced and the plant put into production mode.  The order in which systems are initialized during Start-
up should be determined beforehand and followed explicitly to prevent damage to plant equipment.  The Start-
up order should be organized to ensure that when product is introduced into the system the follow on systems 
or processes are also functional and in an operational mode.  During Start-up, the plant runs continuously 
with product to ensure that the plant and facilities are running and producing the end product as originally 
intended. Coeur's PMO will coordinate this phase in preparation of handoff to operations.

24.1.6 Contracting Plan 

Contracting is an integral function in the Project's overall execution. A combination of vertical (e.g., all trades for 
laboratory), horizontal (e.g., electrical trade for process area), and design construct (e.g., fire protection) contracts may 
be employed as best suits the work to be performed, degree of engineering and scope definition available at the time 
of award.  

Concrete batch plants are expected to be based on-site, to supply specified concrete mixes to all construction 
contractors. There will not be a dedicated construction camp as Durango is located 45 minutes away by asphalt roads. 

The civil/concrete contract will cover clearing, grubbing, bulk excavation, engineered fill, geomembrane lining, and all 
concrete forming, rebar, and placement.  This approach will result in economy of scale and eliminate interfacing issues 
which would arise if multiple contractors were employed. The contractor will require only one major mobilization for all 
work. 

As part of the contracting strategy, a list of proposed contract work packages has been developed to identify items of 
work anticipated to be assembled into a contract bid package. Depending upon how the Project is ultimately executed 
and the timing, several work packages may be combined to form one contract bid package. The following table 
represents highlights of the proposed contract work package list:

24.1.7 Project Schedule 

The schedule consists of milestones, permitting, basic engineering & long-lead procurement, detail engineering and 
construction & start up activities. The summary schedule is shown at the end of this section. 



LA PRECIOSA SILVER-GOLD PROJECT 
FORM 43-101F1 TECHNICAL REPORT 
 

 

 M3-PN130128 
 29 August 2014 
  250 

The construction schedule is to occur within two years including start-up and ramp-up and assumes that Basic 
Engineering, permitting and feasibility engineering will commence Q1 of Y-2. The key milestone assumptions that drive 
the schedule are the completion of environmental permitting in Q2 of Y-2 leading to a full project release in Q3 of Y-2.  
The schedule allows for 5 days of weather delays to weather during the seasonal rains.   

Construction/Project execution of 18 months is expected. Coeur intends to engage an EPCM contractor with significant 
mining project experience in Mexico, which involved large projects and contractors to insure timely project delivery.  
Construction Completion and Turn-over Procedure 

The Construction Completion and Turn-over Procedure is part of the Project Execution Plan.  Contractors are to enter 
into contractual agreements jointly with Coeur and the EPCM contractor acting as agent for Coeur Mining to perform 
certain portions of the work, which includes quality control of their work.  

The PMO will manage the turnover between construction and operations. 

24.1.8 Quality Plan 

A project specific, quality plan will be developed, incorporated into the project execution plan, and implemented before 
mobilization. The quality plan is a management tool for the EPCM contractor, through the construction contractors, to 
maintain the quality of construction and installation. The plan, which consists of different manuals and subcategories, 
will be developed during the engineering phase and available prior to the start of construction.  The Coeur PMO will 
strictly monitor the Quality Plan for compliance. 

24.1.9 Commissioning Plan 

The Commissioning Plan will be developed, incorporated into the Project Execution Plan and implemented to insure a 
step-by-step, documented process and procedure for all mechanical, process, electrical/instrumentation completion, 
checkout and pre-operational testing. Pre-operational testing and commissioning will take place concurrent with 
mechanical completion. Pre-operational testing is currently scheduled to commence in Q4 Y-1 and wet commissioning 
and start-up is scheduled to commence in Q1 Y1. 

The Commissioning Plan will also be project specific and is characterized as the transition of the constructed facilities 
from a status of "mechanically" or "substantially" complete to operational as defined by the subsystem list that will be 
developed for the Project.  The commissioning group will systemically verify the functionality of plant equipment, piping, 
electrical power and controls. This test and check phase will be conducted by discrete facility subsystems. The tested 
subsystems will be combined until the plant is fully functional. Start-up, also a commissioning group responsibility, will 
progressively move the functional facilities to operational status and handover to operations. 

24.1.10 Health and Safety Plan 

The Health and Safety Plan (HASP) will be established for the construction of the Project and any other authorized 
work at the Project site. The HASP covers all contractor, EPCM, and Coeur personnel working at the site.  All 
contractors will be contractually bound to plan and perform all work in compliance with the conditions of the HASP. 

The HASP specifies regulatory compliance requirements, training, certifications and medical requirements necessary 
to complete the project for all personnel and contractors involved in the Project.  A written safety plan will be required 
of each contractor as a deliverable before mobilization to site.

24.2 METALLURGICAL RISKS AND MITIGATION 

Metallurgical samples received for the test programs fall within the current open pit outline and were representative of 
the material that would be mined.   

Individual metallurgical results are highly variable, and the data taken collectively, correlate poorly in linear relationships 
used to established recovery curves.  However, the data do establish head grade - tail grade trends that are likely to 
be observed in commercial operations.  Optimization of leach parameters during detailed engineering may reduce 
variability risk.

25 INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 

This Feasibility Study of the Project indicates that the project has economics at $22/ounce Ag and $1,350 Au that 
indicate an IRR of 9.5%, and a payback of 6.9 years.  The Project has an IRR that increases to 18% at $25/ounce Ag 
and $1,500/ounce Au, with a payback of 3.5 years. 

The Project is located in an area with moderate climate, workable topography and regional work force that has 
experience in construction and operations of mining projects.  The Project is located near a major population center 
and has proximity to infrastructure.  The permitting process in Mexico is relatively straightforward and a reasonable 
permitting schedule is achievable.  The preparation of permitting documents is essentially complete, with only the 
source of power and final water permit to be resolved, prior to submission. 

The Project mine plan was developed using conventional hard rock open pit mining methods.  The mine production 
schedule was developed with the goal of filling the mill at 10,000 tpd and maximizing the Project's return on investment.  
Further mine planning work needs to be done to improve the mining vertical advance rates to minimize the risk. 

Detailed capital and operating costs were developed for the Project based on budgetary equipment quotations, in 
house data and material quantity take-offs.  

The mineral resources for the Project were developed using a computer block model, the drillhole data, and the 
geologic and structural interpretations.   The mineral reserves and mineral resources are summarized in Table 25-1 
and Table 25-2.

25.1 PROJECT RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES  

The Project is a well explored and studied project located close to centers of population and infrastructure.  
Considerable knowledge and understanding of the deposit has been obtained in the last several years that have 
improved the prospects of this large scale open pit silver mine.  Many of the risks and opportunities of this project are 
common to all such mining projects located in Mexico.  

Recent studies have largely eliminated typical project risks of processing design and recovery issues, slope stability 
issues, and have optimized mine and plant design.  Mine plans are flexible and can offer a variety of mine life durations 
based on metals prices.  The plant design is conventional in nature with no esoteric new processes or chemicals and 
the mine plan anticipates conventional drill, blast, excavation, haul technology with well-known costs and performance.  

25.1.1 Risks to the Project  

The Project is anticipated to be a large scale (150,000 mtpd) open pit operation feeding about 10,000 mtpd to a 
processing plant.  The majority of the ore mineralization is contained within veins that will be mined and separated from 
the waste rock.  There is risk in the continuity and grade of those veins and risk in the high strip ratio if mining costs 
are not well controlled. 

Control of surface land for the mining activity has lagged due to issues with clear titles on most parcels of land that 
have caused delays in obtaining those surface rights required prior to initiating mining/construction activities.  The 
majority of the land is now controlled and the MIAs (environmental documents) can be pursued when some immaterial 
issues regarding water and power are resolved. 

Water rights have been difficult to obtain from the local office of CONAGUA and additional rights remain to be resolved.  
The existing well locations and pipeline location will need to be approved and included in the MIA for both access road 
construction and for project operation.  The two wells seem to be adequate for the projected processing plant needs, 
but alternative water sources are being evaluated. 

Electrical Power is available from the local grid, either from an existing 230 kV power line located approximately 12 km 
south of the Project of via a connection to a 115 kV power line located approximately 41 km to the west of the Project.  
However, the local governmental agency responsible for power supply and connections (CFE) has not responded to 
requests for connections that have been proposed by the company.  Power can be obtained at lower rates than is 
being offered by CFE via wheeling of power from other sources through the CFE grid. 

Environmental permit activities need to be completed and the anticipated approval time would be about 6-9 months.   

Mining concession maintenance fees and activities are required to maintain the status of mining concessions.  This 
involves conducting exploration or other activities on the property as well as filing annual reports.  In the event of Project 
delay, those activities would have to be included in the on-going activities and expenses at the site. 

Mexican mining tax and royalty rates increased in recent years but regulations governing those new laws are still not 
available and may change interpretations of how those laws will be enforced or put into effect.  Those tax and royalty 
laws were recently enacted and at a time of low metal prices. There are approximately two more years of the current 
government before the next major elections.  Those elections may result in a relaxation, a continuation or other changes 
in those tax and royalty laws. 

25.1.2 Opportunities 

Due to the current lower metals price environment, the availability of mining and processing equipment and associated 
terms and conditions for acquiring that equipment are very advantageous.

 M3-PN130128

  256 

The start-up of the Project production will take approximately 2 years from date of approval.  This is a quick, but 
attainable, timetable for bringing the production on-line.  The plant and mine design are state-of-the-art but also well-
established technologies. 

Extended mine life is likely with improved metals prices due to the nature of the deposit.  The deposit is not closed at 
depth and still has some inferred resources that could be added to the ultimate mine production.  There are multiple 
veins within the deposit and a quality ore control program could bring additional resources into the production matrix.  
There is additional exploration potential in the region and Coeur holds a large mining concession position. 

The Property is close to population centers without being too close to generate opposition, is close to power and 
transportation infrastructure, and has a ready workforce available locally and in the region. 

Reducing purchased water needs are through a combination of water in-flow into the pit at depth and from the capture 
of rain water during the rainy season. 

The opportunity to stockpile waste rock within mined out portions of the pits can reduce the haulage profile and there-
by reduce the mining costs and equipment acquisition costs for the Project. 

Power costs are available at better rates than are being offered by CFE.  The quoted reduced rates are included in the 
current evaluation but there is a highly competitive market developing in the energy sector that could result in further 
reductions in those costs. 

25.2 METALLURGY CONCLUSIONS 

Feasibility level metallurgical studies for the recovery of silver and gold from the Project have been completed. The 
deposit may be processed in a conventional crushing, grinding, and Merrill-Crowe silver recovery circuit with detoxified 
tailings reporting to a tailings storage facility.  

Metallurgical results obtained from the composites in this study were considered representative of the mineralization 
represented by the selected core samples.  The metallurgical results indicate variable metallurgical response in the 
mineralized zones. 

Mineralogy indicated the major portion of the silver occurs as silver sulfide, acanthite, Ag2S. Traces of silver–selenium 
sulfide, possibly aguilarite, and complex silver–antimony–zinc sulfide were observed.  Silver-bearing grains ranged in 
size from 15 -100 μm.  The silver-bearing grains, were locked in quartz, or were associated with pyrite, galena, lead 
carbonate, and iron oxide or iron hydroxide.  Acanthite occurred as very fine veins within quartz.  Gold grains were 
contained in iron hydroxide that was enclosed in quartz-rich particles.  The majority of the located gold occurrences 
in the samples would be considered liberated.  Gold particles, in binary associations, with pyrite and non-sulfide 
gangue minerals, were generally low in gold content, and were of smaller average diameter than the liberated gold 
particles.  Gold was found as inclusions within the pyrite or gangue particle, and in association with silver sulfide 
minerals. 

The Bond crusher work index averaged 9.7 kWh/t ± 3.4 and varied from 21.3 to 5.2 kWh/t for all samples tested.  Bond 
abrasion index, Ai, ranged from 0.37-1.27 g, and averaged 0.74 ± 0.25g.  Bond ball mill work index, BWi, ranged from 
14.7–18.2 kWh/t and averaged 16.1 ± 1.0 kW/t.  Bond rod mill work index, RWi, ranged from 12.7–18.1 kWh/t and 
averaged 15.3 ± 1.4 kW/t.  Sag mill comminution tests (SMC) were completed. 

Feasibility Study silver and gold recoveries were based on head grade versus tail grade regression of over 154 bottle 
roll tests from the Variability Average Grade, Lithology Elevation bench, and selected Exploratory bottle roll test 
programs.  The weighted silver and gold recoveries, based on life of mine head grades, were determined to be 84% 
and 61%, respectively.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 

On the basis of the results of this Feasibility Study, it is recommended to consider completing basic engineering.  The 
Project has an estimated net present value of $87.6 million at a 5% discount rate, with an estimated internal rate of 
return of 9.5%, and a projected Project payback period of 6.9 years after taxes at the metal prices used for this Report.  
Having basic engineering completed will allow the rapid start-up of construction, when the company decides to proceed 
with the Project. 

Key up-front activities during the basic engineering period include: 

Environmental  

 Continue baseline environmental monitoring, including the monitoring of the piezometers and weather station.  
Initiate the air monitoring with contractors to have baseline information. Confirm geochemical characteristics 
of tailings and waste rock with kinetic testing to assess long-term geochemical behavior.  

 Complete archeological survey.  
 Reinitiate MIA applications for road construction and Project. 

Land 

 Continue with land acquisitions and ROWs for road and ancillary activities (power/water). 
 Maintain mining claim rights through exploration programs. 

Power 

 Pursue 230 kVA connection point approval with CFE. 

Metallurgy 

It is recommended metallurgical developments continue to support optimization of process parameters: 

 Optimization of leach parameters with lithology and variability composites; commercial tank pressure leach, 
temperature, and particle size. 

 Evaluation of alternate technology: CELP, or equivalent, provided the development is stepwise, and without 
commercial obligations prior to proving the technology. 

 Continue development of the geometallurgy model with additional sampling, bottle roll, and QEMSCAN 
analysis. 

 An allowance for additional metallurgical test work is approximately $600,000. 

Plant Design 

 Initiate basic plant design. 

Water Rights 

 Continue process to obtain water rights or confirmation of water rights dependent upon operation/approval of 
the Project.

 Collection of site specific meteorological and hydrology data.  These data will be used to refine seasonal run 
off values and design storms to be used in future detailed design work.   

 Optimization of the water balance to incorporate updated run off and process flow estimates, in order to 
maximize the available reclaim back to the process.  The TSF water balance should be combined with the 
site wide water balance for the Project. 

 Additional site investigations should be completed as part of detailed design.  The investigations should focus 
on construction materials and foundation conditions, with particular focus on the potential for large voids to be 
present in the near surface bedrock within the basin and below the embankments. 

 The tailings materials and properties should be reviewed during detailed design to be sure they are 
representative, especially if any changes to the process occur or as more representative tailings samples 
become available.  

 Development of a full closure plan for the TSF based on the final design configuration.
