1.0 SUMMARY 
 

The Goldfield property (the Property) is located in the historic Goldfield Mining District of 

Goldfield, Nevada, USA (the Goldfield Mining District) approximately 30 miles south of 

Tonopah, Nevada, adjacent to the town of Goldfield in Esmeralda County. The Property 

hosts three currently-known gold deposits: Goldfield Main, McMahon Ridge and Gemfield.  

The Property is 100%-owned by International Minerals Corporation (IMZ), a Yukon 

Territory registered company based in Scottsdale, Arizona and listed on the Toronto (TSX) 

and Swiss (SIX) stock exchanges (trading symbol: IMZ).   

 

The Gemfield Project (the Project) currently comprises the development of Gemfield as an 

open-pit heap leach operation. IMZ completed a Feasibility Study on the potential production 

of gold and silver from the Gemfield deposit in 2012. Subsequently, updates were made to 

the feasibility study in 2013 and Micon International Limited (Micon) has been retained to 

prepare a Technical Report in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-

101) to support the disclosure of the results of the updates to the Feasibility Study (the

Goldfield Property Site Location  

 

 
 

US Highway 95 runs (north-south) through the western portion of the Property with the 

majority of IMZ's land holdings located to the east of the highway. A major geographic 

feature on the Property is Columbia Mountain, located in the west-central part of the 

Property.    

 

The Property is located within portions of 56 sections of land within various Townships and 

Ranges and comprises 568 patented and 1,017 unpatented mining claims, either owned or 

controlled by IMZ.   

 

The Goldfield Mining District was the site of intensive mining after the initial discovery in 

1902 until 1919, when the Goldfield Consolidated Mill closed.  Since that time, operations 

have been sporadic and relatively small in scale. Remnants of the early mining activities 

include numerous head frames, mine shafts and waste-rock dumps widely scattered around 

the Property.

1.2 HISTORY 
 

Goldfield was one of the world's great gold camps and one of the last historic gold rushes in 

the western USA. Although typical of many of the Nevada "boom and bust" gold camps, 

what made Goldfield unique was the extremely high-grade nature of the material mined.  

From 1906 to 1910 Goldfield was the largest city in Nevada. 

 

Modern gold production has been confined to the Goldfield Main area, extending from the 

southern part of Columbia Mountain in the north to the Red King Shaft located 

approximately one mile to the south. Production figures during this time are incomplete; 

however the Nevada Bureau of Mines reports 28,400 ounces of gold were produced during 

this period.  

 

Property ownership in the Goldfield Mining District has historically been complicated and 

fragmented. However, over the past decade and a half, IMZ and its predecessors have been 

successful in consolidating the largest land position ever held by a single owner in the 

Goldfield Mining District.   

 

The list of companies and individuals involved in the Goldfield Mining District is extensive. 

A partial list of the companies that have done work at Goldfield since the 1970s includes 

Cordex, Hanna Mining, Noranda, Utah International, Cyprus, Southern Pacific Land, 

Blackhawk Mines, Westley Mines, Transwestern Mining, Newmont, Meridian, Echo Bay, 

AMAX, Dexter, American Pacific, Red Rock, Crown, Santa Fe, American Resources, 

Kennecott, Cameco, Rea Gold, North, Romarco, Geochem Mines, Lode Star Gold, and 

Metallic Ventures.  

 

On February 26, 2010, IMZ acquired the Canadian public company, Metallic Ventures Gold 

Inc., including its three Nevada operating subsidiaries: Metallic Ventures (U.S.) Inc., (with 

its royalty interest in Barrick's Ruby Hill gold mine in central Nevada); Metallic Nevada Inc. 

(with its Converse gold property in north-central Nevada); and Metallic Goldfield Inc., which 

controlled the majority of the historic Goldfield Mining District.  

 

1.3 GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
 

The oldest known rock unit found in the Goldfield Mining District is the Ordovician 

Palmetto Formation. The Palmetto Formation mainly consists of black siliceous shale and 

argillite, but also contains minor amounts of limestone. Jurassic granitic to granodioritic 

batholithic rocks intrude the Palmetto Formation. These rocks have been dated at 170 million 

years old (Ma).  

 

During Oligocene to Early Miocene times, for a period of approximately 14 million years, 

the Goldfield mining district became a centre of volcanic activity, hydrothermal alteration 

and gold deposition. By the Late Miocene, volcanic activity in the district had diminished, 

with volcanism in the Goldfield Mining District limited to minor amounts of tuff deposited in 



 
 

  15 

a subsiding, lacustrine environment. By the end of the Miocene, flood basalts were extruded 

over the region 

 

Different models for the origins of the structures in the Goldfield Mining District have been 

proposed. One of the earliest proposed a re-activated caldera model whereby caldera collapse 

during the Early Miocene resulted in the creation of a "ring structure", followed by left-

lateral movement along northeast trending faults (Cross Fault system), the latter movement 

resulted in the creation of low-angle (shingle) faults, one of which is the main mineralized 

structures at the Goldfield Main deposit. 

 

The ore bodies in the Goldfield Mining District generally occur within silicified 

hydrothermal alteration zones. Both historically and presently, these zones are often referred 

to as "ledges". The siliceous ledges were created during multiple hydrothermal alteration 

events.  The events began with an early "acid" event (pH<2) which resulted in the partial to 

pervasive dissolution of the host rock, creating a "vuggy" host. Progressively less acid 

solutions later flooded the surrounding rock and deposited quartz together with alunite, barite 

and pyrite (pH =3-4).  

 

The Gemfield, McMahon Ridge, and Goldfield Main deposits are structurally controlled, 

volcanic-hosted, epithermal gold deposits of the high-sulfidation, quartz-alunite type. Other 

examples of the deposit type include Paradise Peak (Nevada, USA), Summitville (Colorado, 

USA), Pierina and Yanacocha (Peru), Nansatsu (Japan), El Indio (Chile), Temora (New 

South Wales, Australia), Pueblo Viejo (Dominican Republic), Chinkuashih (Taiwan), 

Rodalquilar (Spain), Lepanto and Nalesbitan (Philippines). 

 

1.4 IMZ EXPLORATION 
 

Drilling using both reverse circulation (RC) and core drilling methods started in May 2010 

and continued until June 2013. As of the date of this report, 541 RC drill-holes totaling 

335,645 ft and 77 HQ core holes totaling 46,657 ft have been completed. Table 1.1 shows the 

breakdown for the areas drilled at the Property.

Initially, RC drilling was started in the main Goldfield Main deposit, concentrating on the 

shallow east-dipping Columbia Mtn.-Red Top fault. Close to half of all of the recorded 



 
 

  16 

historic production of 4 million ounces of gold has been produced from this shallow-dipping 

structure. IMZ drilling shows that lower-grade gold mineralization, not of interest to past 

operators, continues at depth from the historic surface open pits to the east for a distance of 

approximately 1,500 ft and along strike for 3,000 ft.   

 

Drilling at the Gemfield deposit was concentrated around the edges of the known Gemfield 

resource. Drilling on the west side of Gemfield, in the deeper extension of the deposit, did 

intercept gold mineralization. However, much of this mineralization was sulfide and 

refractory in nature.  Drill programs on the southeast side of Gemfield have encountered 

zones of low grade (0.3-0.4 ppm gold) oxidized Sandstorm Rhyolite. To date no mineral 

resource has been estimated for these possible extensions.  

 

At McMahon Ridge, drilling was undertaken to provide samples for metallurgical studies and 

pit slope geotechnical assessment.  

 

A number of reconnaissance exploration targets were drill tested. The most encouraging 

results came from the Florence mine area at Goldfield Main. Strongly anomalous gold grades 

averaging around 0.5 ppm over widths of 100 ft were encountered. 

 

Detail geologic mapping, soil sampling over large portions of the Goldfield District along 

with PIMA clay alteration studies continue at this time to help define future drill targets in 

the district. 

 

1.5 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 

The mineral resource estimate for the Gemfield deposit has been updated from 3D block 

models in which grades have been interpolated from drill-hole data using ordinary kriging 

within separate geological and statistical domains.   

 

Table 1.2 summarizes the current estimate of the mineral resources at the Gemfield deposit at 

a cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t gold (Au).

demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study", and define a 'Probable Mineral 

Reserve' as the "the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances a 

Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study." 

5. These estimated ore reserves have an effective date of June 17, 2013. 
 

1.7 MINING 
 

The Updated Study assumes only the development of the Gemfield deposit at this time. 

 



 
 

  18 

Standard mining technology will be utilized to create an open pit with approximate 

dimensions of 3,000 feet north-south by 1,900 feet east-west and a maximum depth of 550 

feet below current ground level. A second smaller open pit is also developed with 

approximate dimensions of 1,000 feet north-south by 1,100 feet east-west and a maximum 

depth of 220 feet below current ground level. The mine was evaluated assuming that IMZ 

will purchase and operate its own mining fleet with a maintenance and repair contract 

(MARC) on all mobile equipment. 

 

Micon was retained by IMZ to complete new pit optimizations in order to determine the 

optimal economic pit shape for the new Gemfield mineral resource model. A number of 

scenarios were considered and completed in order to determine the final conceptual pit shell 

that was ultimately selected. This pit shell was then used for feasibility-level detailed phased 

pit designs and production scheduling. 

 

A mine production schedule was prepared using Maptek's Chronos scheduling software. Ore 

selection was based on a fixed cut-off of 0.0066 ounces per ton (oz/T) gold (0.25 g/t gold) 

and calculated using updated mine optimization parameters. 

 

Four pit shells selected from the Whittle optimization were used to guide the design of five 

distinct pit phases. Three phases were developed in the Gemfield Main pit while two phases 

are developed in the Gemfield Southeast pit. Primary access for each pit phase was designed 

from the north to minimize haul cycle times. The tonnage and grade tabulations by pit phase 

are summarized in Table 1.5.

1.8 METALLURGICAL TESTING AND PROCESSING 
 

Various sources of information address mineral processing and metallurgical testing at the 

Property. They include: 

 

 Results from historical testing by previous owners.  
 



 
 

  19 

 A metallurgical overview report dated April 1995 by American Resource Corporation 
(ARC) which discusses their heap leach operations treating feed from Goldfield Main 

in the early to mid-1990s.  

 

 Results from testing by IMZ. 
 

Based on all of the information available it has been decided to focus on the development of 

Gemfield as a heap leach operation. Metallurgical sampling and testing has been carried out 

on material selected from core-holes that are considered to be well distributed throughout, 

and spatially representative of, the Gemfield deposit and it has been concluded that: 

 

 Gemfield is amenable to heap leaching but mining should be limited to the oxidized 
rhyolite (i.e. from above the redox boundary established in geological modeling). 

 

 The Gemfield mineralization is not particularly hard but becomes quite abrasive in 
zones of higher silicification.  

 

 At Gemfield the highest gold grades are found in the highly silicified zones 
("ledges") which require finer crushing to ensure adequate gold particle liberation. 

Conversely, at a constant crush size, recovery declines with increased silicification 

(i.e. increased gold grade). 

 

 Gold recovery at grades typically anticipated from the Gemfield pit (nominal cut off 
and average grades of 0.01 and 0.03 oz/T respectively) are relatively insensitive to 

crush sizes between 100% passing 0.5 inches and possibly as high as 100% passing 2 

inches.  

 

 100% passing 1.0 inch leach feed has been selected for design purposes. At this crush 
size, ultimate gold recoveries in column tests at grades generally anticipated from the 

Gemfield pit ranged between the low 70%'s and the mid-90%'s. Load permeability 

testing on column tails indicates that at 100% passing 1.0 inch the ore could be 

stacked on the leach pad up to 300 ft compared to the 200 ft considered for 

engineering design.  

 

The model proposed for gold recovery versus head grade has been used for mine modeling to 

develop pit production schedules and economic analysis of the Project and results in a life-of-

mine (LOM) average metallurgical gold recovery of 85.2%. 

 

The process flowsheet comprises three-stage crushing and screening, heap leaching, carbon 

adsorption, stripping and regeneration followed by electrowinning and smelting to produce 

doré bars (gold and silver with minor impurities) for shipment offsite to third party refiners.  

Crushing and pad loading will operate on day shift only 12 hours per day, seven days per 

week. Leaching and gold recovery will operate on two shifts, 24 hours a day, seven days a 

week.

1.9 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

Onsite ancillary facilities include various infrastructure buildings, power supply, fuel storage 

and distribution, water storage and distribution and sanitary sewage systems.  Offsite 

ancillary facilities include realignment to the west of approximately 2.5 miles of US 

Highway 95. 

 

1.10 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 
 

In general the environmental liabilities attached to the Goldfield land package are those 

associated with working within a historic mining district.   

 

The environmental study work undertaken so far includes development of the Environmental 

Design Criteria, Environmental Baseline Studies, and initial permitting for the Project.   

 

The Environmental Design Criteria was prepared as a technical memorandum. This 

document defines the environmental aspects relating to soil, water, air and noise that will be 

considered and implemented during design, development and closure of the proposed 

Project. 

 

An environmental baseline study was undertaken in 2003/2004 on the Project area. An 

additional baseline study program was implemented in 2012 and 2013 to collect 

environmental, natural resource and socio-economic data required to support the completion 

of the federal and state agency permitting and approval program, and the environmental 

documentation process that will be required under National Environmental Policy Act 

(NEPA) for the proposed mining project. 

 

Mine closure and reclamation for the project will be conducted in accordance with BLM and 

State of Nevada regulations and guidelines and best management practices. The closure and 

reclamation plan for the Project will include the open pit, waste rock dump and heap leach 

pad and other ancillary facilities. 

 

The permitting strategy identifies and addresses the various local, state, federal and 

international environmental and social requirements and standards applicable to the Project. 

 

1.11 CAPITAL COSTS 
 

Capital expenditures and capitalized pre-production operating costs for the Project are 

summarized as initial and sustaining costs in Table 1.6. The estimates are expressed in first 

quarter 2013 US dollars, without escalation. The expected accuracy of the estimates is ±15%.

The LOM average unit operating cost totals $13.05/T leached over the LOM period, 

comprising $6.03/T for mining, $5.21/T for processing, and $1.80/T for general and 

administrative (G&A) costs, including permitting and environmental expenses. Adding 

bullion transport and refining costs gives an estimated cash operating cost of $524/oz gold 

produced. The net smelter return (NSR) royalty payable to third parties and the Nevada Net 

Proceeds of Minerals (NPOM) tax bring total cash cost estimates to $612/oz of gold 

produced.   

 

1.13 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 

Micon has prepared its assessment of the Project on the basis of a discounted cash flow 

model, from which Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), payback and 

other measures of project viability can be determined.  

 

Cost estimates and other inputs to the cash flow model for the project have been prepared 

using constant, first quarter 2013 dollars, i.e. without provision for escalation or inflation. 

 

The 3-year trailing average price at the end of May, 2013 for gold was $1,546/oz, however, 

in the economic evaluation, a more conservative price of $1,350/oz was selected, being close 

to the spot price prevailing at the time of writing of this report. This price was then applied 

consistently throughout the operating period of the LOM. 

 

US federal income tax and NPOM tax have been allowed for in the cash flow model. Regular 

and alternative minimum tax (AMT) were taken into consideration for federal tax.  

 

Depreciation is applied on a unit of production basis and a 15% depletion allowance is taken 

where applicable. Net operating loss carry forwards related to the Property of $36.5 million 

are also taken into account. 

 

A 5% NSR royalty, payable to third parties, has been provided for in the cash flow model on 

100% of the production from Gemfield.  

 

The LOM base case project cash flow is presented in Figure 1.2 and Table 1.8.

was tested over a range of 20% above and below base case values. The results show that the 

project is most sensitive to revenue factors, with an adverse change of 20% reducing the Net 

Present Value at a 7% discount rate (NPV7) from $73.4 million to $8.9 million. The impact 

of changes in capital and operating costs are almost identical: adverse changes of 20% reduce 

NPV7 to $49.1 million and $47.2 million, respectively. 

 

In Micon's analysis, applying an increase of more than 30% in both capital and operating 

costs simultaneously would be required to reduce NPV7 to below zero. Figure 1.3 shows the 

results of changes in each factor separately.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
 

The Goldfield property (the Property) is located in the historic mining district of Goldfield, 

Nevada, USA (the Goldfield Mining District), approximately 30 miles south of Tonopah, 

Nevada, adjacent to the town of Goldfield in Esmeralda County.  

 

The Property hosts three currently-known gold deposits: Goldfield Main, McMahon Ridge 

and Gemfield.   

 

At this time, only the Gemfield gold deposit is being considered for development as an open-

pit heap leach operation (the Project). The other two deposits are still being evaluated by 

IMZ. 

 

At the request of International Minerals Corporation (IMZ), Micon International Limited 

(Micon) has been retained to prepare a Technical Report in accordance with Canadian 

National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) to support the disclosure of the results of an update

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 

4.1 PROPERTY LOCATION AND AREA 
 

International Minerals (IMZ), through its wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary, Metallic 

Goldfield Inc., owns or controls approximately 22,000 acres (over 34 square miles) in and 

around the historic Goldfield Mining District of Nevada. The Property is located 

approximately 30 miles south of Tonopah, Nevada and 174 miles northwest of Las Vegas, 

Nevada, adjacent to the town of Goldfield.  The majority of the Property is within Esmeralda 

County, with the remaining portion located in Nye County.   

 

The Property is located at approximately 37º42' N latitude and 117º14' W longitude. The site 

location is shown in Figure 4.1.   

 

State Highway 95 runs (north-south) through the western portion of the Property with the 

majority of IMZ's land holdings located to the east of the highway. A major geographic 

feature on the Property is Columbia Mountain, located in the west-central part of the 

Property. 

 

The Property is located within portions of 56 sections of land within the following 

Townships and Ranges: Township 2 South, Range 42 East; Township 3 South, Range 42 

East; Township 2 South, Range 43 East; Township 3 South, Range 43 East, using the Public 

Land Survey System, (PLSS). Map coverage of the area is on the 7.5 minute USGS Goldfield 

Nevada topographic quadrangle map. 

 

4.1.1 Land Status 
 

As is often the case with historic mining districts, land ownership in the Goldfield Mining 

District is somewhat complex. Many of the claims were staked in the early 1900s.  Since that 

time, many claims have been passed through generations of families, with ownership often 

divided among heirs. The sheer number of individual property owners has been a serious 

impediment in recent years to the re-start of commercial mining activities in the area. Over 

the past decade and a half, IMZ and its predecessors have been successful in assembling the 

largest property position ever controlled by a single company in the Goldfield Mining 

District.   

 

The Property comprises 568 patented and 1,017 unpatented mining claims, either owned or 

controlled by IMZ and is summarized in Table 4.1.

4.1.2 Property Maintenance Payments 
 

The unpatented mining claims that IMZ owns or controls in the Goldfield Mining District are 

subject to all the rights and obligations associated with claims located on federal lands under 

the US Mining Law of 1872. The unpatented claims have the rights vested to them to 

develop the underlying minerals and utilize the surface in such a manner as to benefit the 

development of the resource. The unpatented mining claims are subject to annual 



 
 

  37 

maintenance fees paid to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and annual filing fees paid 

to the counties.  

 

The patented mining claims are lands to which title has been passed from public to private 

ownership through the mineral claims patenting process. Thus patented claims are subject to 

annual county real estate taxes. Some of the claims controlled by IMZ are held by lease and 

thus subject to annual payments (as either pre-production minimum royalties or as lease 

payments). The numerous individual leases have variable terms. The fees, taxes and other 

payments for both unpatented and patented claims have consistently been maintained in a 

manner to ensure the claims remain valid. 

 

4.2 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 
 

The Goldfield Mining District was the site of intensive mining after the initial discovery in 

1902 until 1919 when the Goldfield Consolidated Mill closed.  Since that time, operations 

have been sporadic and relatively small in scale. Remnants of the early mining activities 

include numerous head frames, mine shafts and waste-rock dumps widely scattered around 

the Property. The foundations of the Goldfield Consolidated Mill are still evident on the 

western flank of Columbia Mountain. The mill tailings, from the Goldfield Consolidated 

Mill, were discharged by gravity and deposited on the flat areas below the mill. 

 

A Property map showing the land ownership and claims in the area controlled by IMZ is 

presented as Figure 4.2.   

 

Exploitation work during the 1980s and 1990s consisted of several companies performing 

limited re-processing of the historic dumps and tailings and limited mining by open pit 

methods. Pits excavated included the Adams, Red Top, Jumbo and the Combination. In 

general, ore mined was stacked on leach pads and the metal was recovered by heap leaching. 

The resulting features are three open pits, a small pit that was backfilled, a re-contoured 

waste dump, a decommissioned heap leach pad, process ponds, and several buildings. 

Several exploration drill programs have been carried out to locate and expand the mineral 

inventory on the Property. As required under the terms of the exploration Plan of Operations 

(POO) filed with the Bureau of Reclamation, site reclamation was conducted concurrently 

with this exploration drilling resulting in minimal environmental impact.

4.4 ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES 
 

In general the environmental liabilities attached to the Property are those associated with 

working within a historic mining district.   

 



 
 

 40 

There are numerous open shafts scattered throughout the Property as a result of intensive 

mining during the 1900s. Nevada state law requires all open shafts be fenced to prevent 

access to areas where "Abandoned Mine Hazards" exist. All identified shafts have been 

fenced, backfilled, or otherwise remediated to comply with state law.  The open pits located 

on the Property have a relatively small footprint and barriers have been placed to limit access 

to these pits.   

 

The foundations of the historic Goldfield Consolidated Mill, which operated for eleven years 

starting in 1908, are still standing today.   

 

Infrastructure associated with mining and processing activities which occurred during the 

1980s and 1990s (including a heap leach pad, process ponds, maintenance shop, warehouse 

and processing plant building) has been removed and/or remediated (with exception of the 

building which housed the adsorption, desorption and recovery (ADR) plant). Reclamation 

responsibility for the heap rests with Decommissioning Services, LLC (DSL), an affiliate of 

Kappes, Cassiday & Associates (KCA) of Reno, Nevada. The reclamation work on this heap 

leach facility is basically completed, but has not yet been formally accepted by the state of 

Nevada.   

 

4.5 PERMITS REQUIRED AND IN FORCE 
 

The permits currently in place at the Property are those required for exploration drilling only. 

An exploration POO was submitted and approved for the ongoing and projected drilling 

programs. The plan limits the amount of land that can be disturbed as the program progresses 

to a maximum of 23.8 acres at any time. This limit is maintained by concurrent reclamation 

of drill sites as the drilling program progresses. All permits are active and in good standing 

for the completion of the planned exploration drilling program. 

 

The BLM will be the lead regulatory agency for the overall mine and surface disturbing 

activities while the BMRR would be responsible for ore processing permitting and approval 

process. Coordination between IMZ, BLM and the BMRR would ensure all required state, 

federal and local agency permits and approvals are obtained for the Project.  

 

Permitting of the Gemfield Project would entail acquiring the following major permits: 

Esmeralda County Special Use Permit; BLM Plan of Operations (including reclamation and 

closure plans); BLM Environmental Impact Statement (EIS); Nevada Water Pollution 

Control Permit; Nevada Reclamation Permit; Nevada Air Quality Permit; Nevada Water 

Discharge Permit and various SF. 299 Right-of-Way applications. 

  

A number of additional permits would also be required, but the above will require the most 

significant effort, time and cost. The information that has been gathered and developed for

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

5.1 ACCESS TO THE PROPERTY 
 

The Property is located approximately midway between Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada along 

a main north-south transportation route in Nevada, US Highway 95. Goldfield is 

approximately 250 miles southeast of Reno and 174 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Goldfield 

has been the county seat of Esmeralda County since 1907. The county covers an area of 

3,589 square miles.   

 

5.2 LOCAL POPULATION CENTRES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

Esmeralda County is sparsely populated with about 40% of the population residing in 

Goldfield. The other main population centres in Esmeralda County are Silver Peak, 

approximately 26 miles west, and Dyer/Fish Lake Valley, approximately 100 miles to the 

west. In 2010, the population of Goldfield was 268 and the entire population of Esmeralda 

County was 783. The county is designated as rural by the United States Census Bureau. 

 

The nearest community of significant size to Goldfield is Tonopah, located about 30 miles to 

the north of Goldfield (30 minutes by car). Tonopah is the county seat of Nye County, has a 

population of approximately 2,600 and is a full service community. Trained labor, 

accommodations, most required commercial services and educational and medical facilities 

are available in Tonopah. 

 

Problems with transportation of materials, equipment and supplies into and out of Goldfield 

are not anticipated. A major north-south route, US Highway 95, traverses Goldfield and 

connects Las Vegas and Reno. Both these cities serve as major transportation hubs to all 

points in the United States. A network of gravel and dirt roads provide good access to various 

parts of the Property. 

  

Major airports are located in both Las Vegas and Reno. A small airport is located a short 

distance east of Tonopah. This airport is not serviced by any commercial air carrier and can 

be used only for private or charter flights. 

 

5.3 TOPOGRAPHY, FLORA AND FAUNA 
 

The topography of the area comprises broad valleys and alluvial fans, low lying mesas and 

foothills. The foothills and mesas are rocky with drainages and topographic low areas in 

between. The area lies within the southern-most extreme of the Tonopah Section of the Great 

Basin, and the northern border of the Mohave Desert. The maximum topographic relief on 

the Property is 1,424 ft at elevations between 5,440 ft asl (Red Top open pit) and 6,864 ft asl 

(Diamondfield).   

 



 
 

 43 

Vegetation in the area is sparse, consisting of sagebrush, salt desert shrub, Joshua trees, and 

grasses. There are no federally listed Threatened or Endangered plants on the Project site. 

One BLM Special Status Sensitive plant species, Eastwood's Milkweed (Asclepias 

eastwoodiana), is known to occur within the vicinity of the Project.  However, it is not found 

within the direct disturbance area. Wildlife on the Property includes rabbit, quail, dove, and 

wild burros. 

 

5.4 CLIMATE AND LENGTH OF OPERATING SEASON 
 

The Property is situated in the high desert region of the Basin and Range physiographic 

province in the Western USA. Precipitation averages 5.8 inches per year, primarily derived 

from snow and summer thunderstorms. There are warm summers and generally mild winters. 

However, overnight freezing conditions are common during winter. The mean annual 

temperature is 51°F.   

 

5.5 SUFFICIENCY OF SURFACE LAND AREA 
 

IMZ has a substantial land position in the Goldfield Mining District, comprising over 34 

square miles. IMZ has sufficient property under control for its planned mining and 

processing operations.

6.0 HISTORY 
 

6.1 PRIOR OWNERSHIP TO THE PROPERTY AND OWNERSHIP CHANGES 
 

Property ownership in the Goldfield Mining District has historically been complicated and 

fragmented. However, over the past decade and a half, IMZ and its predecessors have been 

successful in consolidating the largest land position ever held by a single owner in the 

Goldfield Mining District.   

 

The list of companies and individuals involved with work in the Goldfield Mining District is 

extensive. A partial list of the companies that have done work on the Property since the 

1970s includes Cordex, Hanna Mining, Noranda, Utah International, Cyprus, Southern 

Pacific Land, Blackhawk Mines, Westley Mines, Transwestern Mining, Newmont, Meridian, 

Echo Bay, AMAX, Dexter, American Pacific, Red Rock, Crown, Santa Fe, American 

Resources, Kennecott, Cameco, Rea Gold, North, Romarco, Geochem Mines, Lode Star 

Gold, and Metallic Ventures.  

 

On February 26, 2010, IMZ acquired the Canadian public company, Metallic Ventures Gold 

Inc., including its three Nevada operating subsidiaries: Metallic Ventures (U.S.) Inc., (with 

its royalty interest in Barrick's Ruby Hill gold mine in central Nevada); Metallic Nevada Inc. 

(with its Converse gold property in north-central Nevada); and Metallic Goldfield Inc., which 

controlled the majority of the historic Goldfield Mining District.  

 

Hereafter, the parent company and subsidiaries of Metallic Ventures Gold Inc. will be 

referred to as MVG. 

 

6.2 RESULTS OF EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT WORK OF PREVIOUS OWNERS 
 

In the early 1990s American Resources Corporation (ARC) began mining and processing 

activities in the Goldfield Mining District. Ore was mined from the Red Top, Combination 

and Jumbo pits and stacked on a heap leach pad. In 1995 ARC reported that 532,379 tons 

grading 0.044 oz/T Au was mined from the Red Top and Jumbo pits. In 1998 the parent 

company of ARC, Rea Gold Corporation, declared bankruptcy. Following bankruptcy, the 

property interest and reclamation responsibilities were acquired by Decommissioning 

Services LLC (DSL), a Reno, Nevada private company.  

 

In 1999 Romarco Nevada Goldfield, Inc. (RNG), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Romarco 

Minerals Inc. (Romarco), obtained a mining sublease, lease and option to purchase 

agreement from DSL for claims including the Goldfield Main and McMahon deposits.  RNG 

conducted exploration work on these properties until 2001.   

 

In March 2001 MVG purchased all issued and outstanding shares in RNG. MVG conducted 

several exploration drilling programs, updated the mineral resources and began preliminary 

engineering work directed toward production from the Property.   

   



 
 

 45 

In August 2002 MVG acquired the claims covering the Gemfield deposit from Newmont 

Capital Limited. 

 

In early 2010 IMZ purchased all issued and outstanding shares of MVG and assumed control 

of its assets, including the Property. Shortly after acquiring MVG, IMZ began a 

comprehensive drill exploration program to expand the mineral resources on the Property. 

 

Geophysical surveys have been carried out at various locations on the Property since 1980, 

including Induced Polarization-resistivity (IP) and Controlled-Source Audio-Frequency 

Magneto Telluric (CSAMT). Both methods aid in the identification of intense silicification 

(locally known as ledges) that is often associated with gold mineralization in the Goldfield 

Mining District. 

 

6.3 HISTORY AND PRODUCTION FROM PROPERTY 
 

Goldfield was one of the world's great gold camps and also one of the last historic gold 

rushes in the western USA. Although typical of many of the Nevada "boom and bust" gold 

camps, what made Goldfield unique was the extremely high-grade nature of the material 

mined. From 1906 to 1910 Goldfield was the largest city in Nevada.   

 

Production records are incomplete and generally difficult to reconcile. The exact amount of 

modern era production and the production results are not known. A number of companies 

have attempted to detail production figures and the following paragraph summarizes the 

results of these investigations.    

 

In 1902, a Shoshone Indian named Tom Fisherman went to Tonopah with some gold-bearing 

samples he had found about 25 miles south of the site near what is now known as Columbia 

Mountain.  The first claims were staked by two prospectors, William Marsh and Harry 

Stimler, in December of 1902 and early 1903 on the northern part of Columbia Mountain.   

 

In 1903 the Combination group of claims and the Florence group of claims were located 

south of Columbia Mountain, in the present day location of the Goldfield Main district. The 

Jumbo and Red Top mines were located on the Florence group of claims. Over the next six 

years these mines produced gold worth $1,250,000, with the gold price then at $20.67 per 

troy ounce. During this time period the Tennessee and Berkeley claims were located and 

these later became the location of the rich Mohawk mine.   

 

The Goldfield Mining District was formally organized on October 20, 1903 and the initial 

town site of Goldfield was laid out on October 24, 1903. The first ore was shipped from the 

Combination No. 2 claim in November 1903. A major gold rush ensued. In just the first six 

weeks of 1904 Goldfield grew from 400 to 1,000 residents. Reportedly the Mohawk mine 

produced gold worth $5,000,000 in the first 106 days of mining operations. An indication of 

the ore grade produced at Goldfield is the records of 1904 showing production of over 

110,000 ounces of gold from 8,000 tons at an average grade of 13.75 oz/T.   

 



 
 

 46 

In September 1905, the Tonopah and Goldfield railroad was completed. Goldfield had a 

population of about 8,000 residents and was still growing. By 1905, a dozen mines in town 

had produced gold with a value of nearly $7,000,000, with the Florence mine at the top of the 

list with production valued at $1,848,000. 

 

Late in 1907 the majority of the mines in Goldfield District were acquired by the Goldfield 

Consolidated Mines Company. By 1910, the population of Goldfield had risen to 20,000 and 

the mines had a record year with gold production valued at over $11.2 million. However, by 

1919, Goldfield Consolidated had closed the last of their mills and moved-out the equipment. 

 

Minor production continued from leasing operations through 1926. Leasing was a system in 

which claim owners leased out small portions of their holdings on an annual basis. Between 

1927 and 1937 about 3.1 million tons of tailings from the Goldfield Consolidated mill were 

reprocessed. The recorded production was 160,800 ounces of gold recovered at an average 

grade of 0.05 oz/T Au. 

 

Several mining companies worked and explored the area between 1935 and 1951; however, 

production was relatively minor. Newmont reportedly produced approximately 17,000 

ounces of gold from about 30,000 tons of ore mined underground from the "Newmont Lode" 

between 1948 and 1951. 

 

Beginning in 1970, Blackhawk leached 60,000 tons of tailings grading 0.078 oz/T Au, 

(recovering 75% of the gold). From 1979 to 1981, Blackhawk also mined and heap leached 

ore from the Adams pit and some of the Goldfield Main area dumps. Transwestern Mining 

Company (also known as Trafalgar Mines) leached 62,900 tons of mixed dump and tailings, 

achieving 61% gold recovery. Dexter mined 357,000 tons at 0.058 oz/T Au of material from 

the Main district in the Red Top pit, during the period 1986 to 1988. Red Rock reprocessed 

285,000 tons of waste dumps in 1989 but apparently only 149,000 tons grading 0.078 oz/T 

gold were properly agglomerated and a total of 7,500 ounces of gold were recovered from the 

dump leaching operation, yielding a recovery of 65%. 

 

Modern gold production has so far been confined to the Goldfield Main area, extending from 

the southern part of Columbia Mountain in the north to the Red King Shaft located 

approximately one mile to the south.   

 

Production figures for the district since 1990 are incomplete. The Nevada Bureau of Mines 

reports only 28,400 ounces of gold were produced during the 1980s and 1990s.   

 

Heap leach ore was extracted by ARC from the Red Top, Combination and Jumbo open pits 

during the early 1990s. American Pacific Minerals reported in 1995 that 532,379 tons 

grading 0.044 oz/T Au were mined from ARC's pits but no official figures are known.

6.4 HISTORIC MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 

Historic and on-going exploration programs have defined and expanded the mineral 

resources in the three currently-known gold deposits within the Property: Gemfield 

(approximately 1.5 miles north of the town of Goldfield); McMahon Ridge (approximately 

3.5 miles north-east of the town of Goldfield); and Goldfield Main (approximately 0.5 miles 

east-north-east of the town of Goldfield). Table 6.1 provides a summary of the recent 

resource estimates.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 

7.1 PRE-MINERAL STRATIGRAPHY 
 

The oldest known rock unit found in the Goldfield Mining District is the Ordovician 

Palmetto Formation. The Palmetto Formation mainly consists of black siliceous shale and 

argillite, but also contains minor amounts of limestone.  

 

Jurassic granitic to granodioritic batholithic rocks intrude the Palmetto Formation. These 

have been dated at 170 million years old (Ma) by Ashley and Silberman (Ashley, 1976). 

Both the Palmetto and the granites are exposed in the western part of the district, on 

Columbia Mountain; in the central part of the district, on Vindicator Mountain and in drill 

core at both Gemfield and Goldfield Main (Figure 7.1).

During Oligocene to Early Miocene times, for a period of approximately 14 million years, 

the Goldfield mining district became a centre of volcanic activity, hydrothermal alteration 

and gold deposition. By the Late Miocene, volcanic activity in the district had diminished, 

with volcanism in the Goldfield Mining District limited to minor amounts of tuff deposited in 



 
 

 49 

a subsiding, lacustrine environment. By the end of the Miocene, flood basalts were extruded 

over the region (Table 7.1).

The pre-mineral volcanic rocks in the Goldfield Mining District were deposited during two 

eras, each characterized by distinct magmatic assemblages: Oligocene (33.6 Ma - 28.8 Ma), 

predominantly rhyodacitic; and Early Miocene (23.2 Ma - 19.8 Ma), predominantly 

andesitic/dacitic. Gold mineralization was emplaced during the waning stages of 

andesite/dacites deposition (20.0 Ma - 21.2 Ma). 
 

A geological model for the formation of the Oligocene-Early Miocene volcanic rocks, which 

incorporates a caldera, has been proposed by Ashley (Ashley, R.P., 1974). He based his 

model mainly on the localization of the Goldfield Main and McMahon Ridge deposits 

(Gemfield had not, as yet, been discovered) along an annular, normal fault system (ring 

fracture) between the two deposits. His caldera model incorporated two compositionally-

distinct source magmas (rhyodacitic and andesitic/dacitic), whose extrusion was separated by 

a period of at least 5 million years. As such, his model was at odds with the accepted models 

for caldera formation which require rapid extrusion and collapse followed by hydrothermal 

alteration and mineralization. Ashley did, however, point out evidence for an annular 

structural control (ring fracture) for the younger dacitic domes as a basis for including them 

in the formation of the caldera, but this could be the result of erosion of the centrally-uplifted 



 
 

 50 

portions of the caldera, giving an appearance of circular control; or, if real, it could be the 

result of re-activation of earlier caldera structures. The evidence for the formation of a 

caldera strictly during the Oligocene is presented as follows.  
 

The Oligocene volcanic succession at Goldfield is characterized by dykes, flows, ash-flow 

tuffs and breccias of rhyolitic to dacitic compositions. These rocks are distributed into two 

distinct areas, implying two different eruptive centres. Age dating by Ashley has shown that 

these eruptive centres were active during two distinct periods, separated by a period of 

collapse and lacustrine sedimentation:  

 

 Early Oligocene, centre of the district: early rhyolite dykes and tuff, latites/quartz 
latites (33.5-33.6 Ma) and Vindicator Rhyolite (33.0 Ma). 

 

 Late Oligocene, northern half of the district: lacustrine sedimentation (Diamondfield 
Formation). 

 

 Late Oligocene, western part of the district: Kendall Tuff (31.1-33.2 Ma), Morena 
Rhyolite ash-flow tuffs (24.4-31.1Ma) and Sandstorm Rhyolite (28.8 Ma). 

 

All of the late Oligocene (western) rhyodacitic volcanic units are localized within a semi-

circular arc along the northwestern quadrant of the district, implying a semi-circular structural 

control, possibly a ring structure.  

 

The above relationships are consistent with known caldera features in other parts of the world. 

The small size  of the Goldfield caldera (diameter of approximately 2 miles) is consistent with 

the small volume of material ejected during Early Oligocene volcanism. 

 

Following a hiatus of approximately five million years, andesitic lavas of the Milltown 

Andesite were erupted during the Early Miocene. Related dacitic flow domes were also 

emplaced during the same period, together with local units (Espina Breccia, tuff of Chispa 

Hills, Chispa andesite and rhyolite of Wildhorse Springs). Although stratigraphic 

relationships between these units are poorly understood, overlapping radiometric ages 

suggest that they were roughly contemporaneous (Table 7.1). 

 

The andesites/dacites are typical of similar successions, in other parts of the world, which are 

thought to have been deposited during periods of relatively quiet structural activity. Berger 

(Berger, 2007), however, postulated that the eruption of the andesites/dacites were related to 

the eastward migration of strike-slip faults and related extensional stepping, based on age-

dating by Vikre (Berger, 2007). 
 

The Vikre dates, however, are for hydrothermal alunites, which would make them post-

volcanic. Ashley's age dating of Early Miocene volcanic rocks from the same three zones do 

not show any systematic progression in ages (Table 7.2).

7.2 POST-MINERAL STRATIGRAPHY 
 

The third period of volcanism in the Goldfield Mining District occurred during the Late 

Miocene after hydrothermal alteration and gold deposition. This period is characterized by 

rhyolitic tuffs and lacustrine sedimentary rocks (Siebert Formation) which were deposited in 

local basins. 

 

The Siebert Tuff is the most common post-mineral unit in the Property area and is generally 

composed of volcanic ash, gravel and scattered beds of diatomaceous earth. In the Goldfield 

Main area, the basal beds of the Siebert consist of sedimentary breccias, probably colluvium, 

composed of locally derived altered porphyritic dacite, rhyodacite, and Milltown Andesite.  

 

The fourth period of volcanism in the Goldfield Mining District consists of basalt flows that 

have yielded ages ranging from about 10.4 to 14 Ma (Armstrong, 1972). Such flows cap the 

Siebert on Myers and Mira Mountains, south of Goldfield, and patches of basalt are also 

exposed on all sides of the Goldfield Hills at lower elevations in the pediment areas. 

 

The fifth and final period of volcanism in the Goldfield Mining District occurred following a 

hiatus of approximately 3.6 million years. This consists of the Spearhead Member of the 

Thirsty Canyon Tuff, dated at 6.8-6.7 Ma (Ashley, 1976), which outcrops on the flanks of the 

Goldfield Hills on the western, southern and eastern portions of the district. Several other 

local units, very young in age, occur in the general vicinity of Goldfield, including the Pozo 

Formation, which lies between the Siebert and the Spearhead Member, the Rabbit Spring 

Formation, which lies between the Spearhead and the Malpais Basalt. Gravels of Quaternary 

age overlie all of the previous units.  

  

7.3 STRUCTURE 
 

Five populations of faults have been identified in the Goldfield Mining District: 

 



 
 

 52 

1. An arc-like structure (ring fracture), which begins at the Goldfield Main deposit (the 
"Combination-Florence" structure), strikes northerly along the east side of Columbia 

Mountain, continues north-easterly and easterly through the Adams mine and the 

McMahon Ridge deposit, respectively. The ring structure hosts gold mineralization at 

both Goldfield Main and McMahon Ridge. Drilling in both areas, as well as at 

Columbia Mountain, show this fault to be normal, with sense-of-movement towards 

the centre of the district. Searls (1948) observed a normal, vertical displacement of up 

to 200 ft on this fault. At Columbia Mountain, vertical displacements of 300 ft have 

been recorded by previous workers.  

 

2. A north-striking, shallow, east-dipping, structure hosts the major portion of the 
mineralization at Goldfield Main (Main Mineralized Horizon or MMH) and continues 

northward to Columbia Mountain. Its age relationship to the adjacent "ring structure" 

has not been proven. Detailed mapping in the Combination pit, however, shows that 

they are distinct structures. Sense-of-movement has not been determined on this 

shallow-dipping structure. 

 

3. Three west-northwest fault sets which are regional in scale; one tangential to the 
"ring" structure at Goldfield Main; a second at Tom Keane; and a third in the 

northern part of the district at Black Butte and Belmont. The sense-of-movement on 

these structures has not been determined, except at the south-eastern extremity of the 

district, near the Tom Keane occurrence. 

 

4. Northeasterly structures, which cut both the Goldfield Main and Vindicator Mountain 
areas. Detailed mapping of these structures by both IMZ and MVG, in the vicinity of 

the Combination pit (the Cross Fault) and towards Vindicator Mountain, together 

with recent drilling by IMZ, indicate that these structures are south-side-down, 

normal or normal-oblique. 

 

5. Steep, normal, north-northeast trending faults at the Gemfield deposit, which form a 
horst. 

 

A simplified structural map of the Goldfield Mining District is presented in Figure 7.2. 

 

Different models for the origins of the structures in the Goldfield Mining District have been 

proposed. The earliest was by Ashley who commented on the similarity of the Goldfield area 

to a caldera (Ashley, 1974). He proposed a re-activated caldera model whereby caldera 

collapse during the Early Miocene (i.e. post-Milltown andesite) resulted in the creation of a 

"ring structure", followed by left-lateral movement along northeast trending faults (Cross 

Fault system), the latter movement resulted in the creation of low-angle (shingle) faults, one 

of which is the main mineralized structures at the Goldfield Main deposit.

Recent work in the Goldfield Mining District, however, shows that a caldera likely formed 

much earlier than the Early Miocene, during the Oligocene, as evidenced by the 

emplacement of moat sediments of the Diamondfield Formation. The second problem with 

the Ashley model is that the "left-lateral" movement on the north-easterly trending faults is 

"apparent" and not "actual". Recent studies have shown that the west end of the same fault 

exhibits apparent right-lateral movement of the same dacite flow unit. This feature, together 

with the funnel-shape of the displaced dacite flow unit, determined by recent drilling, can 

only be explained by south-side-down normal or oblique-normal movement. Down-dropping 



 
 

 54 

of the Main Mineralized Horizon (MMH) across the same fault implies that the movement 

was post-mineral. 

 

More recent structural proposals have focused on right-lateral (Walker Lane type) 

movements as regional controls for mineralized structures in the Goldfield district. There are 

a few difficulties with these models, the most important being a lack of empirical evidence 

for strike-slip movement. To date, only one such observation has been made in the Goldfield 

district, in the Tom Keane area, located at the southeastern extremity of the district (Figure 

7.2) 

 

The Walker Lane structural models are summarized as follows. 

 

Swager (1997) proposed a model whereby right-lateral (Walker Lane) movement on the 

Combination-Florence fault, coupled with left-lateral movement on the Cross Fault, resulted 

in the creation of the low-angle, MMH structure which hosts the Goldfield Main Deposit. 

The two problems with this model have already been mentioned: a lack of empirical evidence 

for right-lateral movement on the Combination-Florence fault (drill-hole data indicate 

normal, east-side-down movement for this fault) and evidence indicating that the Cross Fault 

is a south-side-down normal fault (and not a left-lateral fault). Swager's model also requires 

the rotation of east-dipping, dacite flows towards the west. However, drilling by IMZ on the 

down-dip extension to the MMH clearly indicates that the dacite is a funnel-shaped intrusive 

dome with no evidence for any kind of rotation. 

 

More recently, Berger (2007), proposed a strike-slip, releasing bend model for the structures 

in the Goldfield Mining district, whereby northwestern trending, strike-slip faults (e.g. 

Combination-Florence) are coupled with northeastern trending, normal-oblique faults (e.g. 

Cross Fault) at synformal bends. His hypothesis is mainly based on data from the 

Combination-January pit area (Figure 7.3). 

 

Berger also postulates that a series of these strike-slip releasing bends migrated across the 

district in an easterly fashion through time. 

 

As with the previous strike-slip model, the assumption of strike-slip movement on the 

Combination-Florence and other northwest trending faults has not yet been sufficiently 

demonstrated by field evidence. A second problem with this hypothesis is that the 

relationship between the Combination and Cross Faults, which Berger indicates as being 

essentially continuous in space and time. Surface mapping at Goldfield Main, however, 

shows that these faults are separate in both space and time, with the northeast set being 

younger and displacing both the northwest set and the MMH mineralization.   

 

The fault movement data shown in Berger's 2007 paper does indicate a small number of 

northwest trending, shallow-plunging (<45°), fault striations. The location of these striations, 

however, is unknown.

7.4 ALTERATION 
 

Potassium-argon dating of hypogene alunite and potassium-mica from hydrothermally 

altered rocks yields mineralization ages of 19.6 Ma to 21.6 Ma (Ashley 1976), which is in 

good agreement with the age of mineralization established by potassium-argon dating of 

unaltered pre-mineralization and post-mineralization volcanic units. 

 

Most of the Early Miocene volcanic rocks in the district exhibit some degree of hydrothermal 

alteration, with the exception of the porphyritic dacite on Tognoni Mountain, the Chispa 

Andesite (20.8 Ma), and the rhyolite of Wildhorse Spring. These three units appear to be 

unaltered and together with the radiometric ages obtained from alunites, sericites and apatites 

obtained by Ashley, date  the mineralization at Goldfield at around 20 Ma. 

 

The hydrothermal alteration in the Goldfield Mining District is fairly typical of high-

sulfidation, gold hydrothermal systems found throughout the world. The hydrothermal fluids 

in these types of systems are emplaced episodically and follow a pattern of decreasing 

sulfidation state, decreasing acidity and increasing gold content over time. 

 

In the areas studied by IMZ geologists (Goldfield Main, Gemfield and McMahon Ridge), the 

following scenario of alteration/mineralization events were observed. 

 



 
 

 56 

The earliest hydrothermal fluids were highly acidic (pH<2) and followed fractures and faults 

created by pre-mineral structures. This event resulted in the partial corrosion of the original 

rock, forming a vuggy texture. As the hydrothermal fluids became progressively less acid 

(pH 3-4) due to dilution, they deposited an acid-sulfate assemblage consisting of quartz, 

alunite, barite, kaolinite and pyrite, with gold, mainly as silica-flooded zones surrounding the 

vuggy rocks. Outward from this silica-flooded zone, the host rocks were altered to an 

assemblage of intermediate clays (smectite-illite) and chlorite, forming a broad argillic-

propylitic zone. Other workers have noted a gradual increase in smectite and decrease in illite 

with increasing distance from the silica-flooded zones, which is consistent with a decreasing 

temperature gradient. Very low levels of gold are associated with this early alteration. 

 

The gold-bearing hydrothermal events (two were noted in core samples from the Gemfield 

deposit) cross-cut the early hydrothermal assemblages and consist of white chalcedonic 

quartz with clear, druzy terminations, dickite, pyrophyllite (indicating a pH of about 4), and 

fine disseminations of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, enargite-luzonite, famatinite, 

tetrahedrite-tennantite, bismuthinite, goldfieldite, hessite, argentite and electrum in various 

combinations. The mineralization is either in the form of finely-banded veinlets (indicative of 

boiling), as breccia fragment coatings, or coating vuggy cavities.  

 

Post-mineral, low-temperature veinlets of smectite (indicating temperatures of <160 ºC) were 

observed in a few localities. 

 

Alunite of supergene origin is common in the Goldfield Mining District. Dating of supergene 

alunite samples yields imprecise ages in the range 12 to 9 Ma that probably record the first 

exposure of their hydrothermally-altered host rocks to oxidizing conditions (Ashley, 1976). 

 

7.5 MINERALIZATION 
 

The ore bodies in the Goldfield Mining District generally occur within silicified 

hydrothermal alteration zones.  Both historically and presently, these zones are often referred 

to as "ledges". The siliceous ledges were created during multiple hydrothermal alteration 

events. The events began with an early "acid" event (pH<2) which resulted in the partial to 

pervasive dissolution of the host rock and creating a "vuggy" host. Progressively less acid 

solutions later flooded the surrounding rock and deposited quartz together with alunite, barite 

and pyrite (pH of 3-4).  

 

Two hydrothermal pulses have been identified. The main gold-bearing event, which was 

volumetrically-low compared to the initial event, deposited white, chalcedonic quartz.  In 

addition dickite and pyrophyllite were deposited in narrow veinlets and vugs in the 

previously-silicified rock. Fine-grained disseminations and bands of enargite, famatinite, 

bismuthinite and pyrite, with gold tellurides, were also deposited with the quartz.  Spatially, 

the gold-bearing quartz veins and disseminations are usually superimposed on, or adjacent to, 

early silica-flooded zones. 

 



 
 

 57 

The high-grade sulfide-sulfosalt-gold bearing rocks generally form as veins, vugs, and open 

cavities in fractured and brecciated parts of the fault zones. Many mineralized bodies have a 

medial seam of high-grade material, historically termed a "stope streak", surrounded by low 

grade. Spectacular high-grade material often consists of breccia fragments coated with 

several layers containing quartz, pyrite, famatinite, tetrahedrite-tennantite, bismuthinite, 

goldfieldite and gold in various combinations.  Sphalerite or tellurides also occur in the crusts 

of some high-grade zones and gold is often clearly visible in one or more of the layers.  In 

typical mineralization, pyrite is the most abundant sulfur-bearing mineral followed by 

famatinite. Famatinite often encloses subordinate tetrahedrite-tennantite, sometimes minor 

bismuthinite and a few tiny specks of gold.   

 

Junyoung Sung (University of Utah, M.Sc. Thesis, 2005) defined three stages of 

mineralization in the Goldfield Mining District: 

 

 Stage I: (pre-mineralization): quartz-alunite-kaolinite-barite-pyrite.  

 Stage II  (main mineralizing stage): 

 Sub-stages IIa-IId: chalcopyrite, enargite-famatinite, mohite, tetrahedrite and 
goldfieldite. 

 Sub-stage IIe: bismuthinite. 

 Sub-stages IIf: argentite and hessite. 

 Stage III  (supergene weathering): chlorargyrite, native silver. 
 

Three distinct structural zones in the Goldfield Mining District gold mineralization have been 

recognized, and are typified by the Goldfield Main, Gemfield and McMahon Ridge deposits.  

 

7.5.1 Gemfield 
 

The Gemfield deposit is hosted by the Sandstorm Rhyolite which is composed of strongly 

flow-banded, often glassy, but generally devitrified, porphyritic rhyolite.   

 

Northeast trending normal structures, which contain most of the higher-grade mineralization, 

acted as "feeders" from which mineralization spread along shallow-dipping, flow contacts in 

the Sandstorm Rhyolite resulting in the lower grade, generally stratabound mineralization. 

 

Lava flows of the Sandstorm Rhyolite are almost always hydrothermally altered, including 

propylitic, argillic, and intense silicification. The widespread distribution of hydrothermal 

alteration in the rhyolite is due to the highly permeable character of portions of the flow-

banded volcanic stratigraphy. Formations above and below the rhyolite are generally weakly 

altered and unmineralized.   

 

The Gemfield deposit has a known strike length of approximately 2,400 ft and is 1,200 ft 

wide at its widest point. The depth of gold mineralization beneath barren alluvial cover varies 

from about 10 ft in the northeast part of the deposit where the Sandstorm Rhyolite has been 

removed by erosion, to a maximum depth of nearly 700 ft at the southwest margin of the 

deposit. A representative section of the geology and mineralization is provided in Figure 7.4.

The Gemfield deposit is fault-bounded on at least three sides: east, west, and south.

7.5.2 Goldfield Main 
 

At Goldfield Main, the majority of the gold mineralization occurs within a moderate to 

shallow, east-dipping, fault known as the Main Mineralized Horizon (MMH). The MMH is 

exposed in both the Red Top and Combination pits, where it consists of a series of parallel 

faults, forming a mineralized zone between 100 ft and 200 ft thick. In both pits, the MMH 

structure dips east at 35º to 55º east. 

 

With increasing depth to the east, the MMH dips at lower and lower angles, 30º or less in the 

lower levels of the Mohawk and the Clermont mine, and about 20º in the Jumbo Extension 

and Grizzly Bear mines. According to some authors, the MMH has also been mined in lower 

levels of the Merger and Jumbo mines. Searls (1948) observed a normal, vertical 

displacement of up to 200 ft on this fault. Further north, at Columbia Mountain, vertical 

displacements of 300 ft have been recorded by previous workers. 

 

The Goldfield Main deposit has a strike length of 3,000 ft and a down-dip length of up to 

1,500 ft. The average thickness is in the order of 100 ft. 

 

A representative cross section of the Goldfield Main deposit is provided in Figure 7.5.

Note: Minbound is the approximate limit of in-situ mineralization. RDT is recent dump material, mostly 
historic tailings. 

 

7.5.3 McMahon Ridge 
 

At McMahon Ridge the gold mineralization is controlled by the main ring structure which 

strikes easterly and dips steeply to the south.  Gold mineralization is hosted principally by the 

Milltown Andesite consisting of tuffs, flows and lahars. Mineralization in deeper drill-hole 

intercepts is hosted by tuffaceous sedimentary rocks and black shales of the Diamondfield 

Formation.   

 

Hydrothermal alteration ranges from weak propylitic and argillic in unmineralized rocks to 

strong argillic and intense silicification in the mineralized zones. Mineralization is generally 

structurally controlled with the possible exception being the apparent stratabound character 

of mineralization in the Diamondfield Formation.   

 

A representative section of geology and mineralization is provided in Figure 7.6.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 

The Gemfield, McMahon Ridge, and Goldfield Main deposits are structurally controlled, 

volcanic-hosted, epithermal gold deposits of the high-sulfidation, quartz-alunite type. Other 

examples of the deposit type include Paradise Peak (Nevada, USA), Summitville (Colorado, 

USA), Pierina and Yanacocha (Peru), Nansatsu (Japan), El Indio (Chile), Temora (New 

South Wales, Australia), Pueblo Viejo (Dominican Republic), Chinkuashih (Taiwan), 

Rodalquilar (Spain), Lepanto and Nalesbitan (Philippines). 

 

High-sulfidation systems of this type are commonly found in extensional and transtensional 

settings in continental margin and oceanic arc settings. They commonly occur in zones with 

high-level magmatic emplacements where andesitic stratovolcanoes and other volcanic 

edifices are constructed above plutons. High-sulfidation epithermal systems have been shown 

to overlie, and be genetically related to, porphyry copper systems within subvolcanic stocks. 

Other settings include calderas, flow-dome complexes and maars (the latter being rare).  

 

Host rocks are typically volcanic pyroclastic and flow rocks, commonly andesite to dacite in 

composition, and their subvolcanic intrusive equivalents. Permeable sedimentary 

intervolcanic units can also be sites of mineralization.   

 

Mineralization typically forms in vuggy bodies, veins, stockworks and breccias. Commonly, 

irregular deposit shapes are determined by host rock permeability and the geometry of ore-

controlling structures. Multiple, cross-cutting composite veins and breccias are common.  

  

The most common minerals in high-sulfidation deposits are pyrite, marcasite, 

enargite/luzonite, famatinite, chalcocite, covellite, bornite, gold, and electrum. Deposits can 

also contain chalcopyrite, sphalerite, tetrahedrite/tennantite, galena, marcasite, arsenopyrite, 

silver sulfosalts, and tellurides including goldfieldite.   

 

Most of the production from the Goldfield Mining District has come from composite 

silicified zones consisting of an early quartz-alunite-pyrite phase, with low levels of gold; 

followed by a later, gold-bearing quartz-dickite pyrophyllite phase.  In the Goldfield Mining 

District, these deposits are locally referred to as "ledges," which generally consist of one or 

more, shallow to steeply dipping, vein-like, irregular, silicified zones.

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 

The more recent exploration programs undertaken at the Property are discussed in this 

section of the Technical Report.   

 

9.1 METALLIC VENTURES GOLD INC. (MVG) EXPLORATION PROGRAMS 
 

9.1.1 MVG Exploration Program – 2001 
 

MVG began exploration in the Goldfield Mining District in 2001 and the southeastern part 

was the initial target. Exploration work done during this time included geological mapping 

and geochemical sampling. The results of this program identified six previously 

unrecognized drill targets. Each of these drill targets occurred along a major east-southeast 

trending structural zone from the Goldfield Main Deposit.  

 

Other work included:  

 

 A detailed mapping and geochemical sampling program in the Jumbo open pit area.   
 

 A district-scale geological mapping program from the McMahon Ridge-Black Butte 
area eastward along the northeast extension of the main regional ring fracture system.  

 

 A detailed geological mapping program in a number of other areas, mainly in the 
south-eastern part of the district. 

 

 The completion of approximately two line-miles of soil gas geochemistry in the 
north-western part of the district. 

 

9.1.2 MVG Exploration Program – 2002 
 

In 2002 MVG completed 203 exploration drill-holes for a total of 76,072 ft. The program 

was a combination of 73,655 ft of reverse circulation (RC) and 2,417 ft of core drilling and 

was designed to investigate the McMahon Ridge, Goldfield Main, and Gemfield Deposits.   

 

A total of 155 RC and three core drill-holes were completed in the McMahon Ridge deposit. 

12 RC and five core drill-holes were completed in the Goldfield Main deposit. The drilling at 

Goldfield Main was centred in the area between the Red Top and Combination open pits. At 

Gemfield, 28 core drill-holes were completed in order to twin (duplicate) existing RC holes 

to confirm confidence in the RC data. Assay results indicated good correlation. 

 

Drilling at McMahon Ridge was designed as a two-phased program. Phase I was infill 

drilling between existing drilling to test the continuity of the deposit at a nominal drill-hole 

spacing of 100 ft. Phase II consisted of a combination of additional infill and step-out 

drilling. The Phase II program added 3,400 ft of strike length to the McMahon Ridge deposit, 

increasing the identified strike length to 4,800 ft. 



 
 

 63 

9.1.3 MVG Exploration Program – 2003-04 
 

A total of 449 drill-holes were drilled for a total 213,736 ft from March 2003 to March 2004.  

The goal of the program was in-fill drilling at Goldfield Main and McMahon Ridge, 

metallurgical sampling, limited deep drilling at Goldfield Main, condemnation drilling, and 

testing of identified geologic targets.   

 

A total of 373 drill-holes were completed from March through December, 2003 for a total of 

166,666 ft.   

 

In the McMahon Ridge deposit 54 RC holes and four core drill-holes were completed. The 

RC drilling was designed to, and was successful in, increasing the known mineralized area. 

The core drill-holes were sited to obtain material for metallurgical testing and were located to 

twin existing RC drill-holes. Assay values correlated well for the core and RC drill-holes. 

 

At the Gemfield deposit, 187 RC and six core drill-holes were completed. The RC program 

was designed to reduce nominal spacing to about 100 ft and to provide close-spaced data for 

the development of a geologic model. The drilling located additional high-grade 

mineralization and better defined the geometry of the central "ledge". In addition several 

splays and offshoots of high-grade mineralization on the northeast and southwest edges of 

the deposit were identified. The core drill-holes again were designed to provide material for 

metallurgical testwork and to twin existing RC drill-holes. Condemnation drilling completed 

during 2003 consisted of 28 RC drill-holes and were sited to test areas tentatively selected for 

construction of surface facilities, such as proposed waste rock dumps and process plant 

locations.   

 

A total of 94 RC drill-holes were completed in 2003 to test previously-identified geologic 

targets. 10 drill-holes were completed at the Tom Keane prospect in the extreme southeast of 

the Goldfield Property. This area had seen a small amount of historic production and had 

been identified as a potential target for additional mineralization. Encouraging results from 

this program included drill-hole TK-5 with 145 ft grading 0.03 oz/T of gold and TK-6 with 

75 ft with an average gold grade of 0.084 oz/T.  

 

A total of 76 RC holes were drilled from January through March 2004 for a total of 47,070 ft. 

An additional 25 RC holes were drilled at McMahon Ridge as infill drilling.   

 

MVG constructed a new geologic model with the information resulting from the 2003/2004 

drill program. Condemnation drilling continued in 2004 with 39 condemnation holes drilled 

in the area of the Adams Mine, which is located between the McMahon Ridge and Gemfield 

deposits. 12 RC holes were drilled in the area of the Goldfield Main area and were designed 

to test the deep potential at Goldfield Main. 

 



 
 

 64 

9.1.4 MVG Exploration Program – 2005 
 

In 2005 MVG completed 14 RC holes for a total of 6,300 ft to explore extensions of the 

mineralization in six areas outside of the Gemfield deposit. Results of this program indicated 

that there was potential for the discovery of additional gold mineralization beyond the limits 

of that currently defined.    

 

9.1.5 MVG Exploration Program – 2006 
 

A limited drilling program was undertaken by MVG in June, 2006. Ten RC drill-holes for a 

total of 2,380 ft were completed within the Gemfield deposit. It was intended to more clearly 

define the continuity of gold mineralization in a near-surface mineralized block at Gemfield 

for use in a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) report. Results were as expected with 

shallow, high-grade, near-surface intercepts reported.   

 

9.2 IMZ EXPLORATION PROGRAM – 2010-2013 
 

Following IMZ's February 2010 acquisition of MVG, IMZ initiated a RC drilling program in 

April 2010 to target the Main Mineralized Horizon (MMH) at the Goldfield Main deposit. 

 

By January 2012, IMZ had completed 174 RC drill-holes, totaling 146,895 ft at the Goldfield 

Main deposit.   

 

RC drilling was also carried out in 2011 at four targets outside of the three known deposits. 

These drill targets were: Florence, Kendall, Tailings and North Gemfield. By January, 2012, 

a total of 58 RC drill-holes, totaling 26,405 ft had been completed.  

 

Core drilling (including both twinning of RC and metallurgical drill-holes) was initiated at 

the end of 2010 at the Gemfield, McMahon Ridge and Goldfield Main deposits. By January 

2012, 54 drill-holes, totaling 29,288 ft, had been completed at Gemfield; eight drill-holes, 

totaling 3,112 ft. at McMahon Ridge; and 15 drill-holes, totaling 10,463 ft, at Goldfield 

Main. 

 

Detailed geologic mapping, soil sampling over large portions of the Property along with 

PIMA clay alteration studies were also carried out to help define future drill targets.

10.2 ROMARCO MINERALS INC. (ROMARCO) – 1999 
 

Romarco completed 33,865 ft of RC drilling in 77 drill-holes during a single campaign from 

June to August 1999. All were drilled by the Eklund Drilling Company of Elko, Nevada 

(Eklund). Three Romarco geologists supervised all drilling operations on a hole-by-hole 

basis during the entire program. 

 

Sampling of drill cuttings and first-pass geologic chip logging was undertaken on site during 

the actual drilling process. Later, more detailed chip logging was done at Romarco's 

Goldfield office where a binocular microscope and infrared spectrometer were used to 

acquire additional information regarding host and wall rock lithology, hydrothermal 

alteration, and mineralogical detail. 

 

Generally drill-hole depths during this phase of drilling were relatively shallow (average 440 

ft); therefore much of the drilling was dry. 

 

Representative sample splits over five-foot intervals were taken using a Gilson adjustable 

sample splitter placed beneath the cyclone sample collector attached to the drill rig. Where 

ground water and/or bad drilling conditions were encountered, water and drilling fluids were 

injected into the hole to stabilize the hole and to improve fluid circulation and sample 

recovery. A rotary wet splitter was used to reduce the wet sample size down to about 5 to 10 

kg per split. Wet samples were collected beneath the wet splitter in 20 inch by 24 inch 

polypropylene fabric bags to allow for water filtration, thereby minimizing the loss of fine 

solids. The bags were placed in a 5-gallon plastic bucket and hung beneath the sample 

outflow port at the base of the wet splitter during sample collection. 



 
 

 67 

Duplicate samples were collected at the drill rig by taking two equal splits of the recovered 

sample cuttings collected during the 5 ft long drill runs. The duplicate samples were used for 

assay checks and/or for back-up samples in case the primary sample split was unavailable for 

assay due to accident, loss, or vandalism. By the end of the program, the duplicate sample set 

had only been used for select check assays, and all primary assay samples reached the 

laboratory without incident and in good condition. 

 

10.3 ROMARCO - 2000 
 

Romarco completed 8,055 ft of RC drilling in 15 holes with an average depth of 537 ft from 

July to August, 2000. All of the holes were drilled by Eklund. All drilling operations were 

continuously supervised by two Romarco geologists. 

 

Standard procedures regarding geologic chip logging, drill sample handling, temporary on-

site sample storage, and transportation to a contract analytical laboratory were carried out in 

essentially the same manner as described above for the 1999 campaign, with one exception. 

Because several of the holes were deeper during this program, unusually high water flows 

(>10 gpm) were sometimes encountered (e.g. GFBK-84: 1,160 ft and GFBK-89: 965 ft at the 

"East Goldfield" target area). In cases where the volume of water flow was greater than could 

be contained in a 20 in. by 24 in. sample bag and supporting 5-gallon bucket, the bag and 

bucket were placed in a large rubber pan for the purpose of collecting fines from the stream 

of water that overflowed from the sample bag. In cases where sample slurry overflow was 

deemed imminent, and prior to actual slurry overflow, a flocculating agent was added to the 

slurry in the sample bag (and eventually to the contents in the overflow pan) for the purpose 

of settling fines from the sample slurry. The slurry in the overflow pan was then allowed to 

settle, clear water was later decanted and discarded, and the dewatered sample fines were 

added to the sample bag. In some cases, particularly in clay zones with slow drill penetration 

rates, some sample fines were observed to overflow the second catchment basin, but no effort 

was made to contain this material. 

 

ALS Chemex was the primary analytical laboratory used during the 2000 drill program.  

 

Sample preparation procedures again included drying when necessary, crushing the entire 

sample, splitting, and pulverizing to the same standards as described above for the 1999 drill 

campaign.  

 

10.4 MVG – 2002 
 

10.4.1 Phase I 
 

Between March and May, 2002, four drill rigs completed 22,220 ft in 61 drill-holes. The 

program included 19,800 ft of RC and 2,420 ft of core drilling.  

 

The handling procedures for RC samples during this campaign varied only slightly from 

those for the Romarco 1999 and 2000 drilling programs. In this case, because most of the 



 
 

 68 

drilling was restricted to only two geographic locations, the samples were stored at each drill 

site by the drill contractor and then later loaded on site by ALS Chemex employees and 

transported to the Elko sample preparation facility.  

 

Two RC rigs were operating simultaneously and therefore the sample load required a 

minimum of two lab pick-ups per ten-day drill period. For the purpose of sample security, the 

final sample pickup during a ten-day drill period always collected all remaining samples 

from the project area so that no sample was left on site during a four-day work break. 

 

HQ-sized drill core was stored in 10 ft capacity waxed-cardboard core boxes on site until the 

hole was completed. Upon drill-hole completion, the core boxes were transported to the 

Merger shaft sample storage facility for geologic logging and sampling. Except for a few 

days at the end of the program, the core drilling operation coincided with the RC drill 

program in terms of period of operation, but the core drilling operation involved two 12-hour 

shifts per day; hence, the core stored on site was rarely left unattended. 

 

During the geologic logging procedure, the whole core was first photographed and then 

placed on wooden benches for core recovery measurements and geologic review. The 

photographs of the core were initially taken using a single lens reflex camera and 

conventional color film. Four-by-six inch color photographs of the core were kept in a file in 

the MVG Reno office. Duplicate digital photographs were prepared by the commercial photo 

lab during the film development and printing process by scanning the original film negatives. 

These photographs were stored on CD media in the MVG Reno office. 

 

The HQ-size drill core was sampled by taking a ½ split of the original whole core sample. A 

½ split of core was taken by one of the following three splitting techniques.  

 

1. In the case of competent core material, the core was sawn using one of two on-site 
electric motorized diamond-bladed saws.   

 

2. If the core material was extremely hard, such as typical silica ledge material, the core 
was split using a hand-operated hydraulic core splitter. In this case, the core samples 

are first etched on two sides with a shallow pass of the diamond-bladed saw and then 

these cuts were used to align and secure the jaw blades of the hydraulic core splitter. 

 

3. In the third case, where very soft clay-rich and/or very broken and/or friable core 
must be split, a steel paint scraper was used for splitting the core. 

 

Finally, bagged half splits of the HQ-size core was transported to ALS Chemex in Elko, 

Nevada, and the second ½ core split was stored in a secure steel container at the Merger shaft 

sample storage facility.  

 

 

 



 
 

 69 

10.4.2 Phase II 
 

Procedures for phase II, regarding geologic chip logging, drill sample collection, sample 

handling, temporary sample storage, and sample transportation to ALS Chemex were 

essentially the same as those described above for the 2002 phase I drill campaign with one 

exception. A set of standard samples were prepared by ALS Chemex from material obtained 

from the Goldfield Main District. These standards were to be included with future primary 

drill sample shipments for the purpose of laboratory checks. 

 

10.5 IMZ – 2010-2013 
 

Drilling using both RC and core drilling methods started in May 2010 and continued until 

June 2013. As of the date of this report, a total of 541 RC rotary drill-holes totaling 335,645 

ft and 77 HQ core holes totaling 46,657 ft have been completed. Table 10.2 shows the 

breakdown for the areas drilled at the Property by IMZ.

Initially, RC drilling was started in the main Goldfield Main deposit concentrating on the 

shallow east-dipping Columbia Mtn.-Red Top fault. Close to half of all of the recorded 

historic production of 4 million ounces gold has been produced from this shallow-dipping 

structure. Between May 2010 and January 2012, a total of 174 RC drill-holes totaling 

146,895 ft and 15 core holes totaling 10,463 ft were completed This drilling shown that 

lower grade gold mineralization, not of interest to past operators, continues at depth from the 

historic surface open pits to the east for a distance of 1,500 ft and along strike for 3,000 ft.   

 

Drilling at the Gemfield deposit was concentrated around the edges of the known Gemfield 

resource. This program commenced in January 2011 and to date a total of 214 RC drill-holes 

totaling 102,250 ft and 54 HQ core holes totaling 33,083 ft have been completed. Exploration 

on the west side of Gemfield, in the deeper roots of the deposit, did intercept gold 

mineralization. However, much of this mineralization was sulfide and refractory in nature. 

Drill programs on the southeast side of Gemfield have encountered zones of low grade (0.3 

to 0.4 ppm Au) oxidized Sandstorm Rhyolite. Most of the core drilling at Gemfield was used 

for metallurgical studies, twinning potential contaminated RC drill-holes, pit slope studies, 

hydrology packer test studies and drilling in the deeper portions of the Gemfield gold system. 

 



 
 

 70 

At McMahon Ridge, 8 core holes totaling 3,112 ft were used to provide samples for 

metallurgical studies and pit slope geotechnical assessment. Reconnaissance RC drilling west 

of McMahon Ridge totaled 12,050 ft from 23 RC drill-holes. Results received from this drill 

program have not encountered any significant mineralization. 

 

A number of reconnaissance exploration targets were drill tested with 105 RC drill-holes 

totaling 60,715 ft.  

 

Detailed geologic mapping, soil sampling over large portions of the Property along with 

PIMA clay alteration studies were also carried out to help define future drill targets.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 

11.1 CORE/RC CHIP HANDLING AND LOGGING PROTOCOLS 
 

11.1.1 RC Drilling 
 

Procedures for chip handling and logging during the pre-Romarco RC drilling campaigns are 

not well documented. It is assumed that standard practices and procedures normal to the 

industry at that time were employed. Eklund Drilling of Elko, Nevada was the main drill 

contractor during that period. Eklund was, and still is, a well-established drilling contractor 

with over thirty years of experience drilling gold deposits in Nevada.   

 

RC chip logging and handling procedures were similar for all MVG and IMZ drilling 

programs. The initial 20 ft of each hole was generally drilled dry. State of Nevada 

environmental regulations for dust suppression mandate drilling with water injection for the 

remainder of each drill-hole. Wet RC cuttings were split at the drill rig using a rotary wet 

splitter. A geologist was assigned to each rig to ensure samples did not overflow the 

collection bucket. Overflow of the collection bucket would result in the loss of fines from the 

sample.   

 

The main difference in sampling procedures before and after IMZ acquired MVG was for 

samples collected where high ground water flow was encountered: pre-IMZ, the overflow 

was collected in an oversized rubber tub and a flocculent was used to settle the fines. Once 

the fines had settled the water was decanted from the overflow tub and the fines added to the 

sample; IMZ drilling did not recover the overflow of fines.  

 

Geologists also collected a representative portion of the chip sample from the reject material 

for each sample and placed these in covered plastic chip trays. These chips were then logged 

by the geologist. Lithology, alteration and recovery were logged as the interval was drilled. 

Plastic chip trays were subsequently stored in a locked IMZ facility at Goldfield, Nevada.   

 

11.1.2 Core Drilling 
 

Core logging and handling procedures were similar for all MVG and IMZ drilling programs. 

Company geologists first digitally photographed the drill core; the core was then logged for 

alteration, mineralization, lithology and core recovery. Sampling was performed after 

completion of the logging.   

 

Relevant information was recorded on paper log sheets by geologists. Subsequent to the core 

logging the information was transferred into Excel and then imported into a digital database. 

The digital database enables the use of the recorded information in geologic modeling 

programs to aid in interpretation of the data. The data transfer from the log sheets to Excel 

was done by hand entry. 

 



 
 

 73 

11.2 SAMPLE HANDLING AND SECURITY 
 

11.2.1 Romarco and MVG (1999-2006) 
 

Sample handling and security procedures initiated under Romarco in 1999 continued through 

to 2006 under MVG. Romarco/MVG personnel were responsible for the drilling and both 

used similar procedures for sampling and security.  

 

RC samples were collected at the drill rig by a sampling technician. Samples were placed in 

heavy duty plastic bins and were transported to the storage yard. The samples were stored in 

the yard until pick-up by personnel from the commercial assay laboratory.   

 

The core drill samples were placed in boxes by the drill contractor. The full boxes were 

collected on a daily basis and transported to the storage yard. Samples were stored under lock 

and key at the former Merger Mine site in the Goldfield Main area.   

 

There was little opportunity for anyone to tamper undetected with the samples at any step in 

the shipping, preparation and assaying process.   

 

All samples, whether RC chips or core were logged, split and packaged on site, prior to being 

shipped to the lab for assay.   

 

11.2.2 IMZ (2010-2013) 
 

IMZ uses similar sampling and security controls as discussed above.  

 

11.3 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ASSAYING 
 

11.3.1 Romarco and MVG (1999-2006) 
 

Romarco and MVG used American Assay Labs based in Reno, Nevada, an ISO/IEC 17025 

certified facility. ALS Chemex based in Reno, Nevada an ISO 9002 certified facility was also 

used. The analytical procedures these companies followed are described in the following 

paragraphs. 

 

The wet samples were oven-dried as the first step in the process. Individual samples were 

passed through a jaw crusher to produce a nominal minus 10 mesh size, which was then 

passed through a Jones riffle splitter to obtain a 200 to 400 g split for pulverization. The 

individual samples were pulverized to 90% passing -150 mesh (106 microns) using a ring 

grinder. Barren rock was subsequently run through both the jaw crusher and pulveriser 

between samples to prevent cross-contamination between samples.   

 

A 30 g representative pulp sub-sample was analyzed for gold by fire assay with an atomic 

absorption (AA) finish with a 5 ppb lower detection limit.  



 
 

 74 

Samples returning grades exceeding 10 g/t Au were re-assayed using the gravimetric assay 

method as it is more accurate for higher-grade gold samples. Gold-mineralized intervals 

exceeding about 100 ppb Au were subsequently assayed for silver by aqua regia digestion 

and AA analysis. In some cases, samples from mineralized intervals were later analyzed 

using an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) multi-element analysis method.   

 

Silver analyses were done using an aqua regia digestion and the atomic absorption analysis 

method with a 0.2 ppm lower detection limit. Check samples for this drill campaign were 

prepared from select sample rejects. 

 

11.3.2 IMZ (2010-2013) 
 

IMZ uses Inspectorate Labs based in Reno, Nevada as the primary laboratory and American 

Assay Labs in Reno as a check laboratory. Both are internationally recognized and certified 

to ISO 9002 or ISO/IEC 17025 standards.  

 

11.3.2.1 Sampling Preparation 
 

Samples received at Inspectorate are documented and organized within the laboratory. The 

Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) allocates a work order to each set of 

samples arriving at the laboratory using bar coding and scanning technology. 

 

Once the samples are received and sorted, they are placed in a dryer for 24 hr. The rock and 

drill-hole samples are dried at 110 ºC, while the soil and stream sediment samples are dried at 

60ºC. The dried samples are then prepared for analyses. These samples are pulverized to 

>85% passing 200 Mesh (75 microns) to reduce the mean grain size, thereby homogenizing 

the samples. The Inspectorate code for this process is SP-RX-2K. Pulps and coarse rejects 

from the prepared samples are returned to IMZ and stored in a secured warehouse in Reno, 

for future reference. 

 

11.3.2.2 Assaying 
 

For both RC and core samples, the prepared sample pulps were analyzed for gold by fire 

assay using 30 g of sub-sample and are analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry 

(AA) finish (Inspectorate code Au-1AT-AA). Samples that assayed in excess of 5 g/t Au are 

re-analyzed with a gravimetric finish to ensure a more accurate result at the higher grades 

(Inspectorate code Au-1AT-GV). 

 

In addition to the methods outlined above, the prepared sample pulps from selected samples 

are also analyzed by a semi-quantitative multi-element ICP method. The Inspectorate code 

for this is 30-AR-TR. The pulps are digested using aqua regia and read on ICP-AES for the 

30 elements in the package.  

 

The sample rejects are returned to IMZ and stored in a secured warehouse in Reno, for future 

reference.

11.4 ASSAY QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
 

11.4.1 Quality Control Coverage 
 

11.4.2 Romarco and MVG (1999-2006) 
 

The quality control (QC) data available for assays from campaigns prior to the Romarco 

exploration programs has not been evaluated. AMEC reviewed the QC data available in the 

MVG offices prior to the acquisition by IMZ. These data were predominantly generated from 

drill information acquired during the MVG drilling campaigns. The results were in the form 

of reported AA duplicates on selected samples in each report and from a check assay 

program that re-submitted coarse reject samples corresponding to mineralized intercepts.  

These intervals were identified by MVG geologists (AMEC, 2007).   

 

11.4.3 IMZ (2010-2013) 
 

IMZ uses a comprehensive protocol based on standards, blanks and duplicates for quality 

control for the current drilling program. The standards are used to monitor accuracy and the 

blanks are used to monitor contamination. 

 

IMZ uses a head office staff geologist to monitor and implement the QA/QC program and the 

results of the standards and blanks for deviations from the accepted values. All anomalous 

results are reported to IMZ's Exploration Manager (based in Reno) for resolution with the 

laboratory. 

 

IMZ utilizes five standards, four of which were purchased from CDN Resource Laboratories 

(CDN), and one which was purchased from Rocklabs Ltd. The gold standards range from 

0.61 g/t to 6.42g/t.  

 

The samples from the Property are shipped to IMZ's Reno storage facility where the 

standards and blanks are inserted and the entire sample shipment prepared for delivery to the 

Inspectorate laboratory in Reno. Either a standard or a blank is inserted every ten samples, 

with standards and blanks being used alternately. The position of the QA/QC samples is 

determined in the field during logging and sample tags are reserved for QA/QC purposes so 

that the sample numbering of the standards and blanks are seamlessly integrated with the 

samples. 

 

Standards are monitored using control charts similar to the ones shown in Figure 11.1, Figure 

11.2 and Figure 11.3. The solid magenta line on the control chart shows the reference value 

for the standard; the red points show the assay values reported by the lab; and the red lines 

define the acceptable range for each standard.

The QA/QC database records the specific action taken on each failure. In all cases, 

discussions with the laboratory and a review of the other assays in the same batch led to a 

decision that no samples needed to be re-analyzed. A summary of the statics relating to the 

gold standard analyses is presented in Table 11.1.

11.5 TWIN DRILL-HOLES (CORE AND RC) 
 

11.5.1 Romarco and MVG (1999-2006) 
 

MVG, prior to acquisition by IMZ, had twinned several RC drill-holes with core drill-holes. 

In its report, WGM noted that for over the entire mineralized zone the RC and core drill-hole 

assays were, on average, within 2% of each other for the Gemfield deposit, and within 4% of 

each other for McMahon Ridge deposit (WGM, 2005). An example of one of these twin-hole 

comparisons is presented in Figure 11.6. 

 

The results showed that the RC drill-hole grades were usually higher by about 10%. The 

reason for this difference is not known but should be considered as added risk to the resource 

estimation process. It may be a consequence of either selective gold loss from core-drilling, 

or gold enrichment in RC cuttings, or a combination of both. Selecting high-grade RC drill-

holes to twin with core-holes may exaggerate the effect if mineralization occurs in lenses that 

have dimensions that are less than or similar to the distance separating the holes.   

 
Figure 11.6  

Core to RC Drill-Hole Twin Comparison (GEM 385C vs GEM 183) 

 

 
 

MVG reported that these differences were reviewed and most of the differences in gold assay 

between twin holes generally corresponded to changes in the geologic environment within 

each drill-hole. The PQ size core size used in the MVG drilling program in 2003 resulted in 

core holes that were very straight (i.e. little deviation) when compared to the twin RC hole.  

The twin RC holes showed significant drift (deflection) at depth. Thus the drill-hole 

separation distance increases between twinned drill intervals with increasing drill-hole depth. 

As the drill-hole separation increases, geological variations are more likely to occur.  This is 

especially true in the case of mineralized zones in bonanza gold systems such as those in the 

Goldfield District.

11.5.2 IMZ (2010-2011) 
 

After carefully reviewing the geologic cross sections, there were four suspected RC 

contaminated drill-holes, especially in the deeper and higher grade portion of the Gemfield 

deposit. These four RC holes were twinned with HQ core and IMZ noticed the same effect 

observed by MVG - that the higher-grade silicified (ledge) material in the RC drill-holes was 

causing down-hole contamination. As a result, only the gold zones intercepted in the core 

holes were used in the geologic cross sections in these areas. The comparisons showed that 

the gold grades were similar in the RC and core holes but the thickness of the gold zones 

were highly exaggerated in the RC drill-holes.   

 

11.6 CONCLUSIONS 
 

In the opinion of the QP responsible for resource estimation, the assay data have an accuracy 

and precision adequate for resource estimation purposes.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 

IMZ verified the Goldfield historical database (GHDB) when the Property was first acquired 

and on two occasions since then, when new data became available. Each of these data 

verification exercises consisted of checks of the entries in the electronic database against 

original assay certificates from the laboratories. 

  

In 2009 the review of the GHDB focused on 132 drill-holes from the Gemfield deposit and 

187 drill-holes from McMahon Ridge deposit. The procedure consisted of: 

 

 Ensuring that 100% of the drill-holes had been loaded into the database. 
 

 Identifying the percentage of geochemically anomalous samples in the records (over 
300 ppb in gold). 

 

 Randomly selecting 5% of the total of geochemically-anomalous records, checking 
that the correct units were used. The reason for this check was that the database 

records values in g/t (ppm) as well as in ppb, while the majority of the original 

certificates had gold values in ppb, but some are reported in ppm. This check 

confirms that there has been no inadvertent mistake in the units of measurement 

between the certificates and the database. 

 

 A record-by-record check of the selected 5% to confirm the grade values, creating a 
database of every difference. For each record the original gold ppb data value found 

in the Access database was compared to the Au ppb data found in the assay 

certificates and the difference and percentage difference were calculated. 

 

 Once these results were reviewed, "AU_PPB Original" data were plotted versus 
"AU_PPB IMZ" checked data in a scatter plot.  

 

 The scatter plot was used to check the accuracy of the data. 
 

In 2010, the same method was used to analyze the GHDB; this exercise focused on 130 

Gemfield drill-holes and 226 Goldfield Main drill-holes. 

 

The method used in 2011 consisting in checking 20% of the historical holes that had not been 

previously checked. A total of 480 drill-holes from all three deposit areas were checked. 

 

These verification exercises revealed that approximately 95% of the database records 

matched exactly with the original assay certificates. Of the 5% where discrepancies were 

detected, the vast majority of these were differences between a value that carried decimal 

places and a rounded value. For the very few cases where the database value was wrong 

(usually missing, when a value actually existed), the database was corrected. 



 
 

 82 

In the opinion of the QP, the verification of the database has been thorough and has been 

appropriately updated when new data have been entered. The resulting electronic database is 

reliable for the purposes of resource estimation.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 

13.1 SUMMARY 
 

Various sources of information address mineral processing and metallurgical testing at the 

Property. They include: 

 

 Results from previous testing by others. 
 

 A metallurgical overview report dated April 1995 by American Resource Corporation 
(ARC) which discusses their heap leach operations treating feed from Goldfield Main 

in the early to mid-1990s.  

 

 Results from testing by IMZ. 
 

13.2 PREVIOUS TESTING 
 

A review of information in MVG's records revealed that older files generally consisted of 

poorly documented testing, inadequately identified samples and informal handwritten notes. 

These have been largely ignored, but comments on more recent reports produced by 

recognized independent testing facilities are summarized as follows. 

 

A more detailed description of the previous testing can be found in the NI 43-101 Technical 

Report "Feasibility Study on the Goldfield Property, Nevada, USA" by Micon, with an 

effective date of 17 July, 2012 (Micon, 2012). 

 

13.3 CURRENT TESTING BY IMZ 
 

13.3.1 Gemfield 
 

Drill core was collected from core-holes GEM C001, 002, 003, 004 and 005 representing 

material from what was then described as Gemfield East and West (now the Gemfield 

deposit) and assembled into four composites (low, medium, high and very high-grade), for 

column testing at 100% passing 1.5 inches and 0.5 inches. Based on previous work the 

composites were agglomerated with a limited quantity of cement and allowed to cure prior to 

the onset of irrigation. No blinding or ponding was noted as the tests progressed.  

 

Results are summarized in Table 13.1 and show good response to column leaching at either 

crush size, with higher recoveries, cyanide and lime consumption at the finer size. 

 

The locations of the drill-holes used for this phase of testwork are shown in Figure 13.1.

Bottle roll testing at 80% passing 75 and 45 microns (the latter also with carbon-in-leach 

(CIL) testing) on splits of the column composites, as well as individual variability samples 

taken from elsewhere on the Gemfield deposit, averaged gold recoveries in the range of low 

to mid 90% for gold, low to mid 50% for silver, relatively low cyanide and lime 

consumption, and no evidence of preg-robbing. 

 

Column residues (non-rinsed, air dried) were submitted to Knight Piésold (KP) in Elko, 

Nevada, for load-permeability testing. Results indicated that minus 1.5 and 0.5 inch residues 

could both be stacked on the leach pad significantly higher than the 200 ft established for the 

original Gemfield Feasibility Study design purposes. 

 

As the geology of the Gemfield deposit has become better understood and modeled by IMZ, 

it is apparent that gold grade increases significantly with the degree of silicification in the 

oxidized rhyolite.  

 

Drill results were classified into four levels of increasing silicification, numbered 1 thru 4, 

and additional testwork was focused on their different metallurgical characteristics.

Drill core was collected from core-holes GEM C027, 028, 029 and 030 and assembled into 

14 composites for column testing, representing a range of gold grades within the various 

silicification classes (plus two additional composites classified as non-silicified). The 

locations of the drill-holes used for this phase of testwork are shown in Figure 13.1. 

 

All the composites were column leached at 100% passing 0.5 inches, corresponding to the 

base case crush size selected for the Feasibility Study. Selective re-compositing of excess 

material was used to set up a limited number of parallel tests on coarser-sized material. The 

composites were not agglomerated prior to the onset of irrigation. No blinding or ponding 

was noted as the tests progressed.  

 

Column test results are summarized in Table 13.2 and generally show good response to 

column leaching at all the crush sizes tested. Gold recoveries tended to decrease and cyanide 

consumption increase with increased silicification, but lime consumption was relatively low 

for all samples.

Leached residues (non-rinsed, air dried) from the columns were submitted to KP for load-

permeability testing and confirmed earlier results. Material crushed to 100% passing 0.5 

inches can be stacked on the leach pad to 300 ft and still maintain adequate permeability.  

This compares to the 200 ft considered for the Updated Study. 

 

Bottle roll testing at 80% passing 75 and 45 microns, (the latter with CIL) was carried out on 

core samples collected from below the oxide/sulfide (redox) boundary. Gold recoveries were 

significantly lower than those encountered in oxidized material, ranging between the low 

10's and mid-20%'s, confirming the need to restrict mining to the oxidized zones of the 

Gemfield deposit. 

 



 
 

87 

 

Random drill-core samples selected to represent increasing levels of silicification were 

submitted to Phillips Enterprises, LLC, in Golden Colorado (Phillips) to determine crushing 

and abrasion indices. Bond crushing indices were quite moderate, ranging between 5.5 and 

6.8 kWh/T. Abrasion indices ranged between 0.0498 to 0.5404.  

 

For the most recent testing, drill-core was collected from holes GEM C001, 002, 003, 004, 

005, 036, 045, 046, 048 and 049 (drill-holes locations are shown in Figure 13.1) and 

assembled into four composites (low, medium, high and very high-grade) for column testing 

at 100% passing one and 0.5 inches. Lime was added to the composites prior to loading the 

columns based on bottle roll test results. The samples were not agglomerated but no blinding 

or ponding was noted as the tests progressed.  

 

Results are summarized in Table 13.3 and show good response to column leaching at either 

crush size. As previously concluded from earlier testing, except for very high grade samples 

(generally in excess of 3ppm gold) recovery appears relatively insensitive to crush size in the 

range tested (100% passing 1.5 to 0.5 inches). Recoveries fit the model proposed in the 

original Feasibility Study. Leaching was essentially complete in all tests at or before the 

point of 2.5 tons of solution per ton of ore previously established as the limit for primary 

leaching.  

 

Based on these and all prior test results it was concluded that 100% passing one inch should 

be used as the basis for plant design.

13.3.3 Goldfield Main 
 

A more detailed description of the IMZ testwork at Goldfield Main can be found in the NI 

43-101 Technical Report "Feasibility Study on the Goldfield Property, Nevada, USA" by 

Micon, with an effective date of 17 July, 2012 (Micon, 2012). 

 

The conclusions derived from the testwork can be found in Section 13.4 of this report. 

 

13.4 CONCLUSIONS  
 

Based on all the information available to date (including operational problems addressed in 

the ARC Report) it has been concluded that Goldfield Main is not a candidate for heap 

leaching. Similarly McMahon Ridge requires further investigation but seems to be more 

suited to a milling operation. The decision has therefore been made to focus exclusively on 

the Gemfield deposit for development as a heap leach operation:  

 

 Gemfield is amenable to heap leaching but mining should be limited to the oxidized 
rhyolite (i.e. from above the redox boundary established in geological modeling). 

 

 Load permeability testing on column tails indicates that at 100% passing 0.5 inches 
the ore could be stacked on the leach pad up to 300 ft compared to the 200 ft 

considered for the original Feasibility Study.  

 

 The Gemfield mineralization is not particularly hard but becomes quite abrasive in 
zones of higher silicification.  

 

 The highest gold grades are found in the highly silicified zones ("ledges") which 
require finer crushing to ensure adequate gold particle liberation at higher grades. 

Conversely, at a constant crush size, recovery declines with increased silicification 

(i.e. increased gold grade). 

 

 Gold recovery at grades typically anticipated from the Gemfield pit (nominal cut-off 
and average grades of 0.01 and 0.03 oz/T respectively) are relatively insensitive to 

crush sizes between 100% passing 0.5 inches and possibly as high as 100% passing 2 

inches.  

 

 100% passing 1.0 inch leach feed represents a reasonable compromise upon which to 
base engineering design. At this crush size, ultimate gold recoveries in column testing 

at grades generally anticipated from the Gemfield pit ranged between the low 70%'s 

and the mid-90's. 

 

Results from IMZ testing, along with data from the earlier KCA columns were submitted to 

Mohan Srivastava of Toronto, Canada, for statistical analysis. On the premise that gold 

recovery appears relatively insensitive to crush size (in the range of head grades anticipated 



 
 

89 

 

from the Gemfield pit) Srivastava evaluated data from all tests on minus one inch material or 

less.  

 

Test recoveries were limited to a solution to ore ratio of 2.5 to 1, the same as used for 

primary leaching in engineering design. Analysis of the end-of-test results with longer 

irrigation cycles indicates incremental recovery might be achieved in production due to 

"trickle down" leaching by solutions from subsequent lifts placed on top of primary leached 

feed.   

 

For the purposes of this study, projected gold recovery (in oxidized rhyolite) has been based 

on gold head grade. The graph shown in Figure 13.2 presents the model proposed by 

Srivastava for gold recovery versus head grade. This has been used for mine modeling in the 

Updated Study to develop pit production schedules and economic analysis of the project and 

results in a life-of-mine (LOM) average metallurgical gold recovery of 85.2%. 

 

The process flowsheet selected for project development comprises three-stage crushing and 

screening, heap leaching, carbon adsorption, stripping and regeneration followed by 

electrowinning and smelting to produce doré bars (gold and silver with minor impurities) for 

shipment offsite to third party refiners. Crushing and pad loading will operate on day shift 

only 12 hours per day, seven days per week. Leaching and gold recovery will operate on two 

shifts, 24 hours a day, seven days a week).

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 

14.1 OVERVIEW 
 

14.1.1 Resource Estimation Procedures 
 

The mineral resource estimates for all three deposits on the Property (Gemfield, Goldfield 

Main and McMahon Ridge) have all been estimated from 3D block models in which grades 

have been interpolated from drill-hole data using ordinary kriging within separate geological 

and statistical domains. Broadly speaking, there are two domains within each deposit: a 

strongly mineralized domain and a weakly mineralized domain. Each domain has its own 

estimation parameters, with the most important changes being in the variogram model 

parameters and the capping levels. 

 

In each deposit, the estimation procedure customizes the local direction of maximum 

continuity so that it is aligned with the direction of maximum continuity identified from 

geological cross-sections. In the case of Gemfield and Goldfield Main, the direction of 

maximum continuity is sub-horizontal, and is captured by using a coordinate system that 

follows the undulations of a mineralized zone whose geometry is clearly identified on the 

geological cross sections. At Gemfield, this mineralized zone is a silicified band within the 

Sandstorm Rhyolite that generally dips to the west, but that locally undulates and that is 

offset by normal faults. In Goldfield Main, the mineralized zone is an east-dipping alteration 

zone (the MMH) whose dip flattens at depth. 

 

At McMahon Ridge, the mineralization is interpreted as steeply-dipping but the orientation 

of the mineralized lenses does not lend itself to the same method as the one used for 

Gemfield and Goldfield Main. In particular, there are several sections on which there appears 

to be two sets of mineralized structure, one dipping to the north and the other dipping to the 

south, creating an "X" pattern. For this deposit, the local variations in the direction of 

maximum continuity were captured by creating a block model of the strike and dip of the 

mineralization, interpolating the orientations drawn on geological cross-sections. 

 

In all three block models, gold grades were interpolated directly from drill-holes assay data; 

no compositing was performed. After ordinary kriging weights were calculated for the 

individual assays, these weights were multiplied by the assay length, and renormalized to 

sum to one. This length-weighting and renormalization procedure ensures that assay length is 

taken into account, and that short-length/high-grade sample intervals from core holes do not 

unduly influence the grade estimates. Generally speaking, the vast majority of the drill-holes 

sample intervals are the 5 ft intervals that come from the RC drill-holes. So the variation in 

sample length is minor, and the direct use of assays, rather than composites, permits greater 

fidelity to the original sample intervals; grades are not needlessly blurred across visible 

geological contacts. 

 



 
 

92 

 

In all three block models, assay grades are capped at levels where the upper tail of the 

distribution starts to break up, as determined from cumulative probability plots of gold on a 

logarithmic scale. 

. 

The resource estimation for each of the three block models included an analysis of the 

possibility of down-hole contamination in RC samples. RC assays were not used for resource 

estimation wherever drill logs included commentary on down-hole contamination, and/or 

where geological interpretations raised serious doubts about the validity of RC assays, 

particularly in intervals with high grades in clayey material that lies immediately below 

silicified material. RC intervals that were deemed to be contaminated were removed from the 

database used for resource estimation, and these intervals were treated as having missing 

values (i.e. not as zeros). 

 

All three block models use search ellipsoids that are aligned with the principal axes of the 

variogram model, with the three radiuses of the ellipsoid being set to the ranges of the 

variogram model. All three block models use octant searches, with the maximum number of 

samples per octant being set to four. The minimum number of samples required for 

estimation was one; meaning that every block that had even one sample within the range of 

the variogram received a grade estimate. 

 

14.1.2 Classification  
 

All of the mineral resources at Goldfield have been classified in accordance with the 

Definition Standards of the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: 

 

A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource
 
for which quantity, grade 

or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 

estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 

economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic 

viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling 

and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 

outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill-holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm 

both geological and grade continuity. 

 

An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource
 
for which quantity, grade 

or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of 

confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic 

parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 

The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered 

through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 

drill-holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be 

reasonably assumed. 

 

An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource
 
for which quantity and 

grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling 



 
 

93 

 

and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is 

based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from 

locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill-holes. 

 

Classification for each of the block models (Gemfield, Goldfield Main and McMahon Ridge) 

takes into account the number of drill-holes used in the estimation, and the number of octants 

that had data; blocks whose grade estimate is based on only one sample, or on assays from 

only one drill-hole, are always classified as "inferred". "Indicated" resources require samples 

from more than one drill-hole, and within 2/3 of the range of the variogram. "Measured" 

resources require samples from several drill-holes, and within 1/3 of the range of the 

variogram. 

 

14.1.3 Location Information: Local Coordinates, Topography and Down-Hole 
Surveys 

 

The local coordinate system used throughout the Property is an imperial coordinate system 

known as GOLD2008. It assigns 50000E, 50000N to the survey monument designated as 

Columbia-1950 and uses 5,066 ft (in NAVD88) as the elevation plane onto which horizontal 

coordinates are projected. Srivastava (2012) provides linear equations that can be used to 

convert between the GOLD2008 coordinates and UTM coordinates. 

 

A high-resolution topography model, with 2 ft contour intervals, was developed in 2008 by 

Aerographics from aerial photography and 105 ground control points surveyed in the 

GOLD2008 local coordinate system. 

 

For resource estimation purposes, the Aerographics topography was locally updated to 

incorporate drill-hole collars that were not available as control points in 2008. This was done 

by extracting the 2 ft contours, building a digital elevation model, calculating residuals (i.e. 

differences between drill-hole collars and topography), gridding the residuals using minimum 

curvature interpolation, and then adding the estimated residuals to the original topography. 

With this procedure, the locally adjusted topography within the resource study area exactly 

matches the drill-hole collars. The residuals calculated for this procedure were checked to 

ensure that there were no anomalous values that might reflect horizontal or vertical location 

errors. For the several hundred new collars in all three deposit areas, only one required a 

database correction; in all other cases, the surveyed collar elevation and the elevation from 

the Aerographics topography agreed to within ±5 ft. 

 

During the development of cross-sectional interpretations, it became apparent that a few 

drill-holes had incorrect down-hole survey data in the electronic database. These were 

checked against original paper records, and corrected.

Table 14.1 and Figure 14.1 provide the location and configuration of the three block models 

that cover the three main mineralized areas on the Property. The columns and rows of each

block model are aligned with the north-south and east-west axes of the GOLD2008 

coordinate system (which are, for all practical purposes, also the north-south and east-west 

axes of the UTM coordinate system); there is no rotation of the block model.

14.1.5 Units 
 

All of the block models use a combination of imperial and metric units. Imperial units are 

used for coordinates and for the block sizes (always a multiple of 5 ft in each direction) and 

are also used for tonnage factors. Grades are interpolated in metric units (grams per metric 

tonne) since these are the units used by the lab to report the grades. In the final block models 

that have been archived, all of the estimates are presented in imperial units; in the case of the 

estimated grades, these are reported both in imperial units (troy ounces per short ton) and in 

metric units (grams per metric tonne). The header record of each file identifies the units used 

for each field. "Tons" are imperial short tons; "tonnes" are metric tonnes; "ounces" are troy 

ounces. 

 

14.2 GEMFIELD 
 

14.2.1 Gemfield Data 
 

14.2.1.1 Drill-holes 
 

The current resource estimate for the Gemfield deposit is based on all drill-holes whose 

assays were available by mid-January 2013: a total of 655 core and RC drill-holes totaling 

approximately 94,500 m. Figure 14.2 shows the collars of these drill holes. Most of the 

additional drilling since the previous resource estimate is in the region east of the Highway 

95 and south-southeast of the historical tailings. 

 

 



 
 

96 

 

Figure 14.2  

Collar Locations of Holes Used For January 2013 Resource Estimation of the Gemfield Deposit. 

 

 
 

For the purpose of resource estimation, the only available Gemfield drill-holes that were not 

included are those drill-holes that were drilled within the footprint of the historical tailings. 

The reasons for excluding these drill-holes in their entirety are: 

 

1) Although some of these drill-holes do penetrate through the base of the tailings, and 
provide assay in the underlying rock, the exact base of the tailings is hard to 

determine. It is hard to distinguish easily between Quaternary alluvium and tailings 

that have been compacted and weathered for nearly 100 years, and whose clays often 

have cemented the grains.  

 

2) The historical tailings pile contains some erratic high grade material. 
 



 
 

97 

 

3) There may be down-hole contamination, with gold in the alluvium intervals being 
sourced from the tailings above. 

 

4) Above the central part of the Gemfield deposit, the alluvium is essentially 
unmineralized. 

 

For all of the blocks that lie beneath the footprint of the historical tailings, the Gemfield 

resource block model has grades of zero. 

 

14.2.1.2 Assays 
 

Of the 50,121 gold assays available in mid-January 2013, all were used for resource 

estimation, with the exception of those within the footprint of the historical tailings and those 

from RC intervals where there was evidence of down-hole contamination. At this cut-off date 

for the assay database, the last holes that provided assay information were GEM 599 in the 

RC series and GEMC-053 in the core series. 

 

Except as noted below, for sample intervals where duplicates existed, the assay used for 

resource estimation purposes was the first assay. All of the duplicates were checked and in no 

case was there a significant difference between the first assay and any of the duplicates. 

 

In three recent core holes (GEMC-028, GEMC-029 and GEMC-030) there are seven 

intervals for which the first assay, the AA-finish assay, was reported as ">10 g/t". Because a 

gravimetric assay was available for each of these seven intervals, the gravimetric assay was 

used for resource estimation in these seven cases. 

 

Assays below detection limit were set to half the detection limit. Unsampled intervals were 

treated as missing (and not as having a grade of zero). 

 

14.2.1.3 Density 
 

The dry bulk densities used for calculating tonnages in the resource block model are those 

used in previous Gemfield deposit resource block models, as reported by AMEC (2007) and 

are summarized in Table 14.2. 

 

In April 2012, Tetra-Tech measured dry bulk densities of 27 samples obtained from core 

holes. These included 13 samples from the Sandstorm Rhyolite, the main host of the 

mineralization at the Gemfield deposit, and 14 samples from unmineralized formations 

whose densities had not previously been measured, but that would have to be stripped in an 

open pit. Since the ranges of densities measured by Tetra-Tech were consistent with the 

values used in previous studies, no changes were made to the dry bulk densities used 

previously.

Figure 14.3  

Topography above the Gemfield Deposit 

 

 
 



 
 

99 

 

The region is essentially flat, with an alluvial plain that straddles the state highway that 

traverses the Gemfield deposit, draining to the east. Across the Gemfield deposit, the 

elevation changes from approximately 5,525 ft asl in the east to 5,600 ft asl in the west. 

 

The peak in the northeast of the study area is a minor peak near Columbia Mountain whose 

summit serves as the 50000E, 50000N reference point for the GOLD2008 local coordinate 

system.  

 

14.2.2 Gemfield Data Analysis 
 

14.2.2.1 Geological Controls on Mineralization 
 

Figure 14.4 shows a typical cross-section through the mineralization at Gemfield. Virtually 

all of the gold mineralization at grades reaching economically viable levels lies in the 

Sandstorm Rhyolite, specifically within an undulating band that contains the strongly 

silicified material referred to locally as "ledge". On Figure 14.4, the band that contains the 

strong gold mineralization, and the vast majority of the strongly silicified Sandstorm 

Rhyolite, is shown in yellow. In the discussion that follows, this band is referred to as the 

"mineralized ledge horizon" (MLH). 

 

Although the MLH extends, in places, into the vitrophyres that lie immediately above and 

below the Sandstorm Rhyolite, bringing minor amounts of gold into the Upper and Lower 

Vitrophyres, the vast majority (well over 98%) of the gold lies in the Sandstorm Rhyolite. 

 
Figure 14.4  

Geological Interpretation Through the Gemfield Deposit on Cross-Section 47000N, Looking North 

 

 

 



 
 

100 

 

Although the MLH is, broadly speaking, relatively flat-lying at Gemfield, it has significant 

local undulations. In places, particularly at the edges of horst-and-graben fault blocks, the dip 

of the MLH can appear vertical. Elsewhere, particularly to the west, the MLH appears to 

follow the westerly dip of the Tertiary formations. 

 

The location of the MLH within the Sandstorm Rhyolite also changes across the deposit. 

Sometimes it lies at the top of the formation, reaching into the Upper Vitrophyre; elsewhere, 

it lies at the bottom of the formation, reaching into the Lower Vitrophyre. 

 

Figure 14.5 shows side-by-side boxplots of the distribution of gold assays above, within and 

below the MLH. The only significant mineralization lies within the MLH. Although the gold 

grades below the MLH are noticeably higher than they are above the MLH, they very rarely 

reach levels that are economically viable.  

 
Figure 14.5  

Side-by-Side Boxplots of Distribution of Gold Assays in Different Geological Domains  

at the Gemfield Deposit 

 

 

 

In the data analysis that follows, and in the resource estimation, the Gemfield deposit was 

separated into two geological and statistical domains: the MLH and the non-MLH (both 

above and below the mineralized ledge horizon).  

 

As seen in the example of Figure 14.4, the MLH can generally be treated as an undulating 

horizon that has an upper and lower contact. In places, the geological interpretations show 

more complexity: lenses of non-silicified rhyolite within the main band, as well as forks and 



 
 

101 

 

splays. For the purposes of resource estimation, the MLH was digitized as a band with an 

upper and lower contact. Where the geological interpretation of the MLH shows more 

complexity, folding back on itself, the contacts were digitized to include the non-silicified 

waste material. Where the geological interpretation shows a "stair step" along a normal fault, 

the contact was digitized along the fault trace. With this slight simplification of the geometry 

of the MLH, the mineralized domain includes some minor amounts of non-silicified ledge 

material that was not shown in yellow in the original geological cross-sections. The effect of 

this assumption is conservative in the resource estimates: it brings small amounts of low-

grade waste material into the domain that carries the majority of the gold mineralization. 

  

14.2.2.2 Grade Capping 
 

Figure 14.6 shows cumulative probability plots (on a logarithmic scale) of the gold assays in 

the two domains. In both domains, the high-grade tail is continuous through the 99
th

 

percentile of the distribution but has a slight break near the 99.8
th

 percentile. For the gold 

assays that lie within the MLH, this break occurs near 40 g/t; for those outside the MLH, this 

break occurs near 3 g/t. Within the MLH, all gold assays above 40 g/t were capped at 40 g/t; 

outside the MLH, all gold assays above 3 g/t were capped at 3 g/t. 

 
Figure 14.6  

Cumulative Probability Plots of Gold Assays in the Two Domains  

at the Gemfield Deposit, With Capping Levels. 

 

 
 

14.2.2.3 Variograms 
 

Figure 14.7 shows correlogram maps of gold grades within each domain. These figures show 

the horizontal variation of the gold grades in all horizontal directions. The center of each 

plot, with zero separation in the east-west and north-south directions, shows extremely good 

correlation at very short distances (the red indicates a correlation close to 1). As pairs of 



 
 

102 

 

samples are further apart, the correlation generally decreases, eventually reaching zero (the 

blue/black colours). 

 

There is a clear direction of maximum continuity in both domains: the N25°E direction that 

is roughly parallel to the major normal faults in Gemfield. The magenta line shows the ellipse 

formed by the ranges of correlation in the horizontal direction. In the MLH, the range of 

correlation is 175 ft parallel to the major faults, and approximately 100 ft perpendicular to the 

major faults. Outside the MLH, the ranges are longer: 250 ft parallel to the major faults, and 

approximately 150 ft perpendicular to them. 

 
Figure 14.7  

Correlogram Maps of Gold in the Two Domains at the Gemfield Deposit 

 

 
 

 

Figure 14.8 shows down-hole variograms of the gold grades in the two Gemfield domains. 

With most of the Gemfield holes being vertical, these down-hole variograms show the 

continuity of gold in the vertical direction. The relative nugget effect in each domain is about 

30% of the sill in both domains. As with the horizontal ranges of correlation, the vertical 

range is slightly shorter inside the mineralized ledge horizon: approximately 20 ft inside the 

MLH and 25 ft in the much lower-grade material outside the MLH.

14.2.3 Gemfield Resource Estimation 
 

14.2.3.1 Resource Blocks and Sub-Blocks 
 

With the level of selectivity inside the planned open pit being approximately a 20 ft cube, the 

block size for the resource block model was 20 ft × 20 ft × 20ft. In order to capture the 

details of the undulations in the mineralized ledge horizon and the rock formation contacts, 

sub-blocks were used. Each 20 ft × 20 ft × 20 ft resource block was split into sub-blocks if 

the entire block contained more than one rock formation. The 20ft dimension was sub-

divided into two 10 ft blocks in each direction; if these 10 ft sub-blocks contained more than 

one rock formation they were further sub-divided into 5 ft sub-blocks. At the 5 ft scale, the 

block was assigned the rock formation code of the formation that constituted the largest 

tonnage within the sub-block. This sub-blocking affects the assignment of dry bulk density 

and tonnage. The tonnage and grade of the sub-blocks were estimated and these were then 

combined to get the total tonnage and average grade of each 20 ft × 20 ft × 20 ft block. 

 

14.2.3.2 Estimation of Tonnage 
 

The tonnage of each sub-block was calculated by multiplying the sub-block volume by the 

dry bulk density for the rock type assigned to the sub-block, using the dry bulk densities 

given in Table 14.2. 

 

Rock type contacts were digitized from the geological cross-sections, and simplified in the 

same manner as the mineralized ledge horizon: all the contacts are represented as elevation 

grids, with minor fold-backs removed and with the contact running down faults where these 

serve as the formation boundary. These "layer-caked" elevation surfaces were clipped against 



 
 

104 

 

each other successively, from top to bottom, so that the top of an older, deeper formation 

never crosses above the bottom of a younger, shallower formation. 

 

The top and bottom of the silicified Sandstorm Rhyolite were assumed to be the same as the 

top and bottom of the MLH (the yellow band on Figure 14.4). There are some minor amounts 

of silicified rhyolite that fall outside the MLH and, within the MLH, there are minor amounts 

of rhyolite that are not strongly silicified. Tonnage estimates could be improved if the 

geological logs permitted logging of the silicification intensity. Since the current and 

historical formats for the descriptive logs do not allow this to be properly coded, the most 

reliable data for the assessment of the density variations within the rhyolite are the geological 

interpretations of the mineralized ledge horizon. With the density constants for rhyolite (see 

Table 14.2) having been rounded to the nearest decimal place, the uncertainty on the exact 

location of the silicified / unsilicified contact within the rhyolite has very little impact on the 

resource estimates. Any error in the tonnage estimates is globally very minor, likely less than 

2% for the blocks that contribute to measure and indicated resources within the pit. 

 

At the ground surface, the topographic surface (Figure 14.3) was used to clip the block 

model. Sub-blocks with their centroids above the topography had their tonnages set to zero. 

With no historical mining activity at Gemfield, there was no need to account for historical 

production voids beneath the ground surface. 

 

The tonnage of each 20 ft × 20 ft × 20 ft resource block is the sum of the tonnages of the 

individual sub-blocks within it. 

 

14.2.3.3 Estimation of gold grade 
 

Hard domain boundaries 

 

The gold grade for each sub-block was estimated by interpolating the nearby drill-holes 

assays using ordinary kriging using hard domain boundaries. If the centroid of the sub-block 

falls within the MLH domain, the sub-block was treated as belonging to the MLH and was 

estimated from surrounding MLH assays. If the centroid of the sub-block falls within the 

non-MLH domain, the sub-block was treated as belonging to the non-MLH domain and was 

estimated from surrounding non-MLH assays. 

 

No estimates below base of oxidation 

 

Since metallurgical test work has consistently shown poor recoveries for non-oxide material 

at Gemfield, all sub-blocks with centroids below the base-of-oxidation (redox) surface were 

assigned gold grades of zero. The base-of-oxidation surface was digitized from the 

geological cross-sections and interpolated between sections to produce a continuous surface 

that completely spans the resource block model area. 

 

 

 



 
 

105 

 

Use of stratigraphic vertical coordinate 

 

A stratigraphic coordinate was used instead of elevation. Within the MLH, this is the distance 

above/below the centreline of the MLH band. Above the MLH, the stratigraphic coordinate 

was the distance above the top of the MLH band; and below the MLH, it was the distance 

below the bottom of the MLH band.  

 

Replacing the elevation with a stratigraphic coordinate ensures that the interpolation follows 

the undulations in the MLH band. Using Figure 14.4 as an example, the direction of 

maximum continuity has a dip of about 45° to the west on the western side of section 

47000N but has a shallow dip to the east on the eastern side of the same section; in the 

middle, it steepens (near a fault) and then flattens to nearly horizontal. The use of a 

stratigraphic coordinate captures all of these variations in the direction of maximum 

continuity since the centreline of the MLH follows the undulations. 

 

Variogram model 

 

Table 14.3 gives the variogram model parameters used for kriging. The variogram models 

are all single-structure exponential models, with a relative nugget effect of 30% of the sill. 

The long and intermediate ranges are in the plane of the MLH; the shortest range is 

perpendicular to the MLH. 

 

Down-hole variograms (Figure 14.8) were used to determine the nugget effect, the shape and 

the vertical range of the variogram model; correlogram maps (Figure 14.7) were used to 

determine the directions of maximum and intermediate continuity and the ranges in these 

directions. Because of the use of a stratigraphic vertical coordinate, the directions of 

maximum and intermediate continuity are not strictly horizontal but, instead, follow the 

undulations of the mineralized ledge band.

Search strategy 

 

An octant search was used within an ellipsoid that was the same as the ellipsoid defined by 

the variogram ranges. Within each octant, the closest four assays were retained for 



 
 

106 

 

estimation. The maximum number of nearby samples that could be used for the estimation of 

any sub-block was 32; the minimum was 1. 

 

Reblocking to 20 ft × 20 ft × 20 ft 

 

The average gold grade for a 20 ft × 20 ft × 20 ft block is a tonnage-weighted average of the 

gold grades in all of the sub-blocks that fall within the parent block. Sub-blocks that have no 

grade estimate (usually because they fall below the base-of-oxide surface) were assigned a 

grade of zero before reblocking to the 20 ft × 20 ft × 20 ft scale used for reporting purposes. 

 

14.2.3.4 Silver 
 

The previous resource block model for Gemfield (used in the original Feasibility Study) 

contained silver grade estimates. Since many older drill-holes do not have silver assays, and 

previous economic analysis established that silver contributes less than 2% to gross revenue, 

the current block model in the Updated Study does not include estimates of silver grades. 

 

14.2.4 Gemfield Resource Classification 
 

Resource classification was done in a two-step procedure. In the first step, each sub-block 

was assigned a 1/2/3 code according to the following criteria:  

 

 Sub-blocks with samples within ⅓ of the variogram range, with at least four octants 
containing data from at least four different drill-holes were assigned a value of 1. 

 Sub-blocks with samples within ⅔ of the variogram range, with at least four octants 
containing data from at least two different drill-holes were assigned a value of 2. 

 Sub-blocks with samples within the variogram range were assigned a value of 3. 

The resulting sub-block codes were then spatially averaged to produce values between 1 and 

3 for each 20 ft × 20 ft × 20 ft block. All blocks outside the MLH were classified as Inferred, 

regardless of their average code. Within the MLH, blocks with an average code less than 1.5 

were classified as Measured; those with average codes between 1.5 and 2.5 were classified as 

Indicated; and those with average codes above 2.5 were classified as Inferred. 

 

Since sub-blocks below the base-of-oxidation surface were left unestimated, the classified 

resources extend down to the base-of-oxidation surface, but not beyond it.  

 

14.2.5 Checks of Gemfield Resource Block Model 
 

14.2.5.1 Visual Checks 
 

The resource block model was checked visually by overlaying drill-holes data on cross-

sections through the block model, along with the geologic surfaces used to guide the grade 



 
 

107 

 

interpolation: the top and bottom of the MLH, and the base-of-oxidation. Figure 14.9 shows 

an example of this type of visual check. 
 

Figure 14.9  

Visual Checks on North Facing Cross Section 47000N of Gemfield Block Model. 

 

 
 

As shown in Figure 14.9, the resource block model was checked both at the scale of the 20 ft  

blocks, as well as at the scale of the sub-blocks, since the honouring of the drill-hole data and 

the geological contacts was easier to assess at the finer scale. 

 



 
 

108 

 

14.2.5.2 Statistical Checks 
 

The distribution of estimated gold grades for the 20 ft × 20 ft × 20 ft blocks was compared to 

the distribution predicted from a change-of-support procedure (Parker, 1979) that reduces the 

variance of the assay distribution, using the variogram model to determine the variance 

reduction factor. Figure 14.10 shows, as a solid line, the grade-tonnage curve for the 

Measured and Indicated blocks in the model and, as a dashed line, the grade-tonnage curve 

predicted by the indirect lognormal change-of-support procedure applied to the assays that 

fall within the Measured and Indicated blocks. The variogram model predicts that the gold 

grades of 20 ft cubes should have a standard deviation 53% lower than that of the assays. The 

dotted line in Figure 14.10 comes directly from the length-weighted assay distribution, with 

each assay value moved toward the average by the amount needed to reduce the standard 

deviation by the 53% predicted by the variogram model. The close agreement between the 

two curves indicates that the degree of smoothing in the estimates is appropriate for the 

intended level of mining selectivity and that the block model does a good job of reflecting the 

grade variability that the mining operation will experience

14.2.5.3 Software Checks 
 

The resource block model was build using in-house Benchmark Six (B6) software developed 

by R. Mohan Srivastava, the QP for resources, for the specific purpose of enabling the 

interpolation to be done in a stratigraphic coordinate system that follows the undulations and 

faulting in the Sandstorm Rhyolite. 

 

A similar procedure was implemented in Micromine, a commercial software package that 

includes resource estimation and that has the necessary tools for manipulating surfaces, 

calculating stratigraphic coordinates and using these to guide interpolation. 

 

For the measured and indicated blocks within the main mineralized horizon, the Sandstorm 

Rhyolite, the B6 and Micromine tonnages and grades agreed to within ±5% at the reporting 

cut-off of 0.25 g/t gold. 

 

14.2.6 Gemfield Mineral Resource Estimate 
 

Table 14.4 summarizes the current estimate of the mineral resources at Gemfield, using 20 ft

14.2.6.1 Sensitivity to reporting cut-off 
 

The mineral resources for Gemfield have been reported at 0.25 g/t gold, a slightly lower cut-

off than was used for the previous resource statement in July 2012. As discussed in the 

following section on reserves, the most recent economic analysis indicates that the economic 

break-even cut-off is slightly lower than 0.25 g/t. Table 14.5 shows the sensitivity of 

Gemfield's Measured+Indicated resources to small changes in the cut-off grade, below and 

above the 0.25 g/t cut-off used as a base case.  

 

Changes of approximately ±15% in the cut-off grade cause changes of approximately ±13% 

in tonnage, ±9% in gold grade, and ±4% in metal content of the Gemfield resource.

15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 

As of June 17, 2013, the mineral reserves for the Gemfield deposit are summarized in Table 

15.1. There are no reserves estimated for the Goldfield Main and the McMahon Ridge 

deposits. These mineral reserve estimates are included within the mineral resource estimates 

discussed in Section 14 of this report. The parameters for optimization and subsequent mine 

design work supporting these reserves are described more fully in Section 16 below.

validity of this reserve estimate. 

4. CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines (1) define 
a 'Proven Mineral Reserve as "the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral 

Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study", and define a 

'Probable Mineral Reserve' as the "the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and 

in some circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a 

Preliminary Feasibility Study." 

5. These estimated ore reserves have an effective date of June 17, 2013. 

 

The mineral reserves presented in Table 15.1 were estimated by Sam Shoemaker, Jr., 

Registered Member-SME. Mr Shoemaker is a QP as defined in NI 43-101 and is independent 

of IMZ. 

 

The Gemfield resource model was developed using a 20 ft x 20 ft x 20 ft parent block with 5 

ft x 5 ft x 5 ft sub-blocks. This resource model was then exported into the Whittle open pit 

optimization software. This block size exported (20 ft x 20 ft x 20 ft) was selected as a 

suitable basis for pit optimization, mine planning, and reserve estimation because it 

represented a smallest mining unit (SMU) and best balanced the objectives to (a) account for 

mining dilution and losses while still maintaining reasonable fidelity to the geological 

interpretation and (b) reflect practicable mining selectivity based on the equipment 

envisioned for this project. 

The mine plan developed in this report is based on Measured and Indicated Resources. The 

ultimate pit limit is based on the results of a Whittle Optimization completed by Micon. 

Sulfide material and all inferred resource blocks were not considered as potential revenue-

generating blocks in the optimization.   

 



 
 

113 

 

A fixed economic cut-off was applied on a block-by-block basis to select blocks for 

processing using the parameters summarized in Section 16 below. Gold recovery was coded 

into the underlying resource model and was used to determine the recoverable gold ounces 

on a block by block basis. Blocks that were in the Measured or Indicated categories, with a 

gold grade greater than 0.0066 oz/T gold, were sent to the crusher. Other than a small amount 

of crusher feed developed during the pre-production mining period, no ore material is 

stockpiled and all ore material mined is assumed to be sent directly to the crusher.

16.0 MINING METHODS 
 

The Updated Study assumes only production from the Gemfield deposit at this time. 

 

Standard mining technology will be utilized to create an open pit with approximate 

dimensions of 3,000 feet north-south by 1,900 feet east-west and a maximum depth of 550 

feet below current ground level. A second smaller open pit is also developed with 

approximate dimensions of 1,000 feet north-south by 1,100 feet east-west and a maximum 

depth of 220 feet below current ground level. Four pit shells selected from the Whittle open 

pit optimization discussed below were used to guide the design of five distinct phases as 

shown in Figures 16.4 to 16.8.   

 

IMZ will have responsibility for site preparation, haul road construction and maintenance, 

production drilling and blasting, the excavation and haulage of ore and waste, management 

of ore stockpiles, oversize breakage, pit dewatering and haul road maintenance. IMZ will 

provide the open pit equipment, operator training, supervision, pit technical support services, 

mine consumables, and the pit operations and maintenance facilities. Mine maintenance 

personnel will be supplied by the manufacturer, per the terms and conditions of a standard 

maintenance and repair (MARC) agreement. Specialized contractors will provide explosives 

storage on-site. Explosives, blasting agents, fuel and other consumables will be provided by 

established suppliers.  

 

16.1 MINE DESIGN 
 

The ultimate pit limit for the Gemfield deposit was selected based on Whittle open pit 

optimizations. The pit will be developed using five distinct phases designed to approximate 

an optimal extraction sequence. The phase designs are based on slope design parameters and 

benching configurations provided by Golder Associates (Golder). A mine production 

schedule was prepared by Micon using Maptek's Chronos scheduling software.   

 

16.1.1 Whittle Pit Optimization 
 

Micon was retained by IMZ to complete new pit optimizations in order to determine the 

optimal economic pit configuration for the new Gemfield mineral resource model. To 

accomplish this task, Micon used the GEMCOM Whittle open pit optimization software. 

This software uses the industry standard Lerchs-Grossmann algorithm to determine an 

optimal pit shape using various economic, geotechnical, and metallurgical parameters. A 

number of scenarios were considered and completed in order to determine the final 

conceptual pit shell that was ultimately selected. This pit shell was then used for feasibility-

level detailed phased pit designs and production scheduling. 

 

Mine planning slopes for the Enterprise Optimization (EO) were based on recommendations 

provided by Golder Associates (Golder, 2011), as summarized in Table 16.1.

2. Maximum slope height of 200-ft for recommended inter-ramp slope angles 

 

Using the detailed mine planning results from the original Feasibility Study, basic operating 

cost assumptions were developed for the Whittle open pit optimization. The previous study 

assumed a production rate of 6,600 tons per day as a basis. The Updated Study will be using 

a production rate of 8,250 tons per day and the costs were updated as required. These 

parameters are summarized in Table 16.2.

Initial Whittle optimizations were completed using an early version of the Gemfield resource 

model (February 7, 2013). This early work allowed a better understanding of the changes to 

the resource model from the previous models and its impact on the optimal pit shape. This 

early work included 12 scenarios and examined various combinations of mining restrictions 

and minimum mining widths. Once the final Gemfield resource model was available (March 

12, 2013), this earlier work allowed Micon to quickly determine the optimal pit shape for 

design and production scheduling using the new resource model.   

During the initial Whittle optimization runs, it was determined that the new resource model 

would extend into the east drainage diversion ditch. A trade-off study, to determine if 

restricting the optimization to avoid this drainage ditch or to allow it, was completed. It was 

found that by restricting the pit optimization to avoid this drainage ditch the overall project 



 
 

116 

 

economics were improved and a restriction was placed in the resource model to not allow the 

pit optimization to mine in this area.   

For the final Whittle open pit optimization runs, four major scenarios were examined: 

 GEM 13 – Base economics, Measured and Indicated resources only, east pit lobe 

restricted, minimum mining width of 100 feet, no mining allowed of the lower 

Vitrophyre unit, and no slope adjustment for ramps. 

 

 GEM 14 – Base economics, Measured and Indicated resources only, east pit lobe 

restricted, minimum mining width of 100 feet, no mining allowed of the lower 

Vitrophyre unit, and slope adjustments for ramps.   

 

 GEM 15 – Base economics, Measured and Indicated resources only, east pit lobe 

restricted, minimum mining width of 100 feet, no mining allowed of the lower 

Vitrophyre unit, slope adjustments for ramps and a 100 foot set back from the plan of 

operation limits.   

 

 GEM 16 – Base economics, Measured and Indicated resources only, east pit lobe 

restricted, re-blocked to a 100 feet by 100 feet by 20 feet block size to account for a 

minimum mining width of 100 feet, no mining allowed of the lower Vitrophyre unit, 

slope adjustments for ramps and a 100 foot set back from the plan of operation limits. 

 

Scenario GEM 13 was examined primarily to evaluate the maximum pit extents without 

regard for ramps in the overall slopes. This scenario was generated as a check against the 

remaining three scenarios.  

Scenario GEM 14 was found to intrude on the plan of operations limits (POO) and a limit 

establishing a 100 foot set-back from the POO was established in later scenarios. GEM 14 

was then abandoned.  

Scenario GEM 16 examined using a re-blocked model to account for a minimum mining 

width.  This coupled with the other limitations in the optimization severely restricted the 

mining footprint and as a result GEM 16 was also abandoned.   

Scenario GEM 15 was selected for detailed design and production scheduling. This scenario 

applied actual operational constraints in order to ensure that the final pit shell selected would 

remain within the operational plan of operations, not impact the east drainage ditch, and 

avoid both high sulfide materials and the lower Vitrophyre unit. Additionally, the overall 

slopes were reduced in order to account for ramps in the final design. An attempt was made 

through re-blocking to apply a minimum mining width (scenario GEM 16) which does not 

generate a workable pit shell. Minimum mining width was applied instead through the 

Whittle optimization by the use of a floating template that provided the required minimum 

mining width of 100 feet in each direction. With the exception of some minor issues with 



 
 

117 

 

drop cuts at the bottom of the pit, this approach worked well and resulted in a very workable 

pit shell for the final design.   

Based on this analysis, inflection points were selected where significant increases in tonnages 

were identified as the user specified case. In the case of scenario 15, pit shells were selected 

at pit shell numbers 6, 11, 36, 41, 48, 58, 62, 67, and 71 where pit shell 71 is the shell where 

the revenue factor is equal to one. This production scenario is shown as the specified case on 

the green line in Figure 3.1 above. Pit shell 71 is the maximum optimal pit at a full revenue 

factor of 1. A material balanced production schedule was then run for each of these pits 

reducing each schedule by the previous run pit shell number (the first schedule would use all 

9 phases, the second would use 8 phases dropping off shell 71 and so on). This approach 

allows the economic impact of waste stripping (in this case, pit shells above pit number 58 

have significant cost due to increased waste movement) to be examined at various material 

movement inflection points. Figure 16.1 shows these results graphically. 

Figure 16.1  

Scenario GEM 15, Graph of Results 

 

 
 

Based on these results, pit shell 58 was selected for detailed design and production 

scheduling. This scenario was selected as a compromise between the best discounted value 

(without capital) and mine life. Selecting a pit near revenue factor 1 resulted in a significant 

increase in waste stripping with a minimal increase in recovered gold ounces and a decrease 

in discounted value. Pits below shell 41 also resulted in reduced discounted value and 

significantly reduced recovered gold ounces. Pit shell 48 achieved the highest discounted 

value with the selected pit 58 being about $1.4 million less. Based on this analysis, the best 

fit for mine life and discounted value was achieved at pit shell 58. Figure 16.2 shows the 

overall shape of the selected pit shell.

16.1.2 Design Criteria 
 

Geotechnical Assumptions 

 

Different mining phases were designed in accordance with the recommended bench 

configurations provided by Golder Associates as tabulated in Table 16.3. Double benching of 

20 ft production benches were determined to be feasible in all geologic units except the 

Lower Vitrophyre. In the final optimization run, blocks within the Lower Vitrophyre were 

assigned higher mining costs to prevent pit walls from intersecting this unit. Ramps and pit 

walls were also carefully adjusted as needed to avoid exposure of the Lower Vitrophyre.

Haul Road Design Parameters 

 

Two-way haul roads, 60-ft wide at a 10% grade, were designed in most cases where higher 

traffic may require extra width for safe and efficient passing of trucks. To maximize ore 

recovery at depth, the final benches of each pit floor were designed with single-lane access 

and steeper grades ranging from 12% to 15%. Safety berms were designed in accordance 

with the recommendations provided by Golder. Where haul roads intersect the highwall 

safety berm, the full safety berm was added to maintain efficient access onto berms as may 

be required to keep haul roads free of loose rock. Figure 16.3 shows the final pit and waste 

storage area configuration.   

 

16.1.3 Phase Designs 
 

Four pit shells selected from the Whittle optimization were used to guide the design of five 

distinct pit phases as shown in Figures 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7, and 16.8. Three phases were 

developed in the Gemfield pit while two phases are developed in the Gemfield Southeast pit. 

Primary access for each pit phase was designed from the north to minimize haul cycle times. 

The tonnage and grade tabulations by pit phase are summarized below in Table 16.4.

Gemfield Pit Phased Designs 

 

The main Gemfield pit is made up of three pit phases; Phase 1 or the 'starter' pit; Phase 2 an 

intermediate phase design to allow balanced ore production while the final phase is 

developed; and Phase 3, the final pit phase. The small Phase 1 starter pit was designed to 

maintain a minimum set-back of 250 feet from the existing highway to facilitate alluvium 

earthworks and blasting during the final months of the highway realignment. Waste rock 

from this pit phase will be used to construct the crusher road and the first lift of the rock 

stockpile. Once the Highway relocation is complete, development of the Phase 2 can begin in 

tandem with the Phase 1 development. Phase 3 completes the final development of the main 

Gemfield pit.   



 
 

120 

 

   

Southeast Pit Phased Designs 

 

The Gemfield Southeast pit is made up of two phases, developing a minor extension of the 

deposit located to the southeast of the main pit. The first phase of this pit develops a high- 

grade core and the final phase extends to the final pit limits. Overall, this is a fairly low-grade 

pit and, with the exception of the Phase 1 pit, it is mostly developed towards the end of the 

Gemfield mine life. 

 

16.1.4 Stockpile Designs 
 

The rock and alluvium stockpile was designed with a 36° angle of repose, based on the 

assumption that the quantity of fines or plastic materials incorporated would be minimal. To 

facilitate reclamation to final out slopes of 2.5(H):1(V), the rock stockpile was designed in 

40-foot lifts with setbacks of 45 feet. A swell factor of 25% was applied to the Siebert 

Formation and alluvium and a swell factor of 40% was applied to all other bedrock materials.   

 

An estimated 4.3 million tons of alluvium will be removed from the pit area. Alluvium not 

used during construction and not stored in various small stockpiles will be stored in the rock 

stockpile. Alluvium removal required for the heap leach pad and other plant facilities will 

also be stockpiled in the alluvium/growth medium storage area for use in future reclamation 

and plant closure. 

 

During the pre-production period, waste developed will be used as needed for road and ramp 

construction to provide access to the crusher and heap leach areas. Waste not used in 

construction will be sent to the waste stockpile area.

16.2 MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 
 

A mine production schedule was prepared using Maptek's Chronos scheduling software. Ore 

selection was based on a fixed economic cut-off of 0.0066 ounces per ton gold and calculated 

using the parameters shown in Table 16.2. The schedule was prepared on the following basis: 

 

 Period 1 – This is a three-month period for pre-production waste stripping. For 

scheduling purposes this is assumed to be the third quarter of 2015.   

 

 Periods 2, 3, and 4 – These three periods are monthly during the initial start-up. 

Scheduling by month during this first quarter of production ensured that the crusher 

could be fed during this period. For scheduling purposes this is assumed to be the 

fourth quarter of 2015. 

 

 Periods 5 through 12 – These are quarterly periods through the end of the first two 

full years of production. For scheduling purposes this is assumed to be the quarters 

for the years 2016 and 2017.   

 

 Periods 13 through 17 – These are annual production schedules for the remainder of 

the mine life. For scheduling purposes this is assumed to be years 2018 through 2022. 

Please note that the mine operation during the last period (quarter 17 or year 2022) 

occurs only during the month of January when the current mineral reserve is fully 

exhausted.   

 

Other than a small amount of leach material mined during the pre-production period (period 

1), all ore material is assumed to be directly fed into the crusher. For those times when the 

crusher is down or not available, it is assumed that the mine will switch to waste production 

as required. The detailed production schedule is presented in Table 16.5.

16.2.1 Operating & Manpower Assumptions 
 

The open pit will operate 24 hours a day and seven days a week on a 12-hour shift basis. 

Crushing and pad loading will operate on day shift only. Ore hauls will primarily run in 

conjunction with the crushing schedule on day shift. Waste stripping operations will run two 

shifts a day. Blasting operations will be devoted to day shift only. Productivity estimates 

were based on an assumed mechanical availability of 85% and utilization of available hours 

varied to reflect seasonal usage of equipment where appropriate.  

 

A standard day-shift blasting crew will be required while three rotating labor crews will be 

scheduled to operate production equipment.   

 

16.2.2 Preproduction Development 
 

Approximately 2.5 miles of new highway will be constructed to the west of the existing US 

Highway 95. During the final stages of this Highway realignment, a small starter pit (Main 

Pit Phase 1) will be developed to provide waste rock material required to construct the main 

crusher haul road. Any ore encountered in the upper benches will be stockpiled temporarily 

until crushing commences. 

 

16.2.3 Mine Waste Management 
 

The rock and alluvium stockpile was designed with a 36° angle of repose, based on the 

assumption that the quantity of fines or plastic materials incorporated would be minimal. To 

facilitate reclamation to final out slopes of 2.5(H):1(V), the rock stockpile was designed in 

40-foot lifts with setbacks of 45 feet. A swell factor of 25% was applied to the Siebert 

Formation and alluvium, and a swell factor of 40% was applied to all other bedrock 

materials.   

 

An estimated 4.3 million tons of alluvium will be removed from the pit area. Alluvium not 

used during construction and not stored in various small stockpiles will be stored in the rock 

stockpile. Alluvium removal required for the heap leach pad and other plant facilities will 



  

 
 

 129 

also be stockpiled in the alluvium/growth medium storage area for use in future reclamation 

and plant closure. 

 

16.3  MINE EQUIPMENT SELECTION 
 

The Gemfield deposit will be developed using standard open pit technology, scaled 

appropriately for the size of the operation. All mobile mining equipment is assumed to be 

owner-operated under a MARC contract. The required mining equipment is shown below in 

Table 16.6.

16.3.1 Drilling and Blasting 
 

Drilling demands will be met with three Atlas Copco DM45HP production drills. Blasting 

volumes are based on a 6.75 inch blasthole diameter and bench height of 20 ft. Drill spacing 

was adapted based on the assumed material properties for each geologic unit encountered.  

Conceptual drill pattern and powder factor assumptions are summarized in Table 16.7. Sub-

drilling is estimated at 3 ft with stemming columns of approximately 11 ft. Productivity 

estimations were based on a mechanical availability of 85%, a utilization rate of 80%, an 

assumed re-drill rate of 5%, and an average set-up and sampling time of five minutes per 

hole. Revisions to these assumed parameters may be required as warranted by the availability 

of new geotechnical information and site conditions encountered in the field once the mine 

goes into operation. 



  

 
 

 130 

Unit costs for explosives were based on a quote received from Southwest Energy LLC 

(Tucson, AZ), a joint venture with Orica.  Chain of custody and delivery costs were based on 

monthly deliveries of bulk explosives, cartridges and detonators. Four 60 ton silos will be 

located on site providing adequate supply for 5 to 8 weeks, depending on production 

demands.  

 

Grade control will be overseen by the mine geologist. Drilling operating costs already 

include the cost of sample collection as it is assumed cuttings from drill-holes will be 

collected by the drill operators, who will subsequently deliver samples to the on-site assay 

laboratory during shift change.

16.3.2 Loading and Hauling 
 

A fleet of two to three Cat 990H wheel loaders and nine Cat 772 haul trucks will be required. 

Ore hauls will be reserved for day shift to coincide with the crushing operations. A small run-

of-mine ore pad will be maintained with a loader in the event of daily logistical delays. No 

stockpiling is planned for the operation and all ore mined is assumed to feed directly into the 

crusher.   

 

Trucking requirements were estimated using Maptek's Vulcan Haulage Profile software 

program. Using performance data provided by the manufacturer, the Haulage Profile 

program automatically generates highly detailed cycle time estimates for a given haulage 

profile, taking into full account anticipated acceleration and deceleration, as well as any user-

applied speed limits based on safety considerations. This program outputs the results for each 

block contained within the block model. Data calculated and stored include the total block 

productivity time (time required to excavate and move the block to its final destination) in 

minutes, total cycle time in minutes, and total one-way haul in feet. The block data is used 

later during schedule optimization as a constraint to level out haulage equipment 

requirements.   



  

 
 

 131 

 

16.3.3 Support Equipment 
 

An auxiliary fleet of dozers, graders, water trucks and other support equipment will be 

required. One Cat D9T track dozer will be staged in the active pit while the other Cat D8T 

track dozer will be staged at the waste rock stockpile. The Cat D9T track dozer will be 

devoted to alluvium removal and stockpiling in the early years of the project. The Cat 824H 

wheel dozer will remain available as a mobile unit capable of handling miscellaneous tasks 

as required.   

 

16.3.4 Manpower 
 

Total estimated manpower requirements for the mine are shown below in Table 16.8. Micon 

notes that grade control samples are assumed to be collected by the driller as part of the move 

and set-up period between drill-holes. A Chief Mine Engineer is not included in the mine 

G&A since this position is assumed to be filled out of the corporate office in Reno.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 
 

The process flowsheet selected for the Project comprises three stage crushing and screening, 

heap leaching, carbon adsorption, stripping and regeneration followed by electrowinning and 

smelting to produce doré bars (gold and silver with minor impurities) for shipment offsite to 

third party refiners. Crushing and pad loading will operate on day shift only 12 hours per day, 

seven days per week. Leaching and gold recovery will operate on two shifts, 24 hours a day, 

seven days a week. 

 

A conceptual site plan showing the site facilities is presented in Figure 17.1. 

 

17.1 PROCESS DESCRIPTION 
 

The three stage crushing and screening plant will produce leach feed, 100% passing one inch 

at the rate of 8,250 dry T/d. The crushing and screening facilities will operate on a schedule 

of one 12-hour shift per day, 7 days per week. Ore will be hauled from the pits and direct 

dumped into the primary crusher feed hopper. 

 

Tertiary screen undersize (final product, 100% passing one inch) will be conveyed to an 

uncovered conical load-out pile adjacent to the leach pad. A remotely operated "clamshell" 

dump gate will reclaim crushed ore onto a high speed load-out conveyor designed to fill a 50-

ton capacity dump truck in one minute. Pebble lime will be added at a predetermined rate to 

the load-out pile feed conveyor. Dump trucks will transport crushed ore to the leach pad. 

 

Leach pads, ponds, pumps, solution distribution and collection piping and associated storm-

water diversion systems were designed by SRK (Elko and Reno, Nevada). The leach pad will 

be constructed in multiple phases but will ultimately cover an area of approximately 4 

million square feet. The pad will be designed to meet State of Nevada Division of the 

Environment requirements consisting of a base of low permeability soil beneath an 80-mil 

thick HDPE geomembrane covered with crushed over-liner, which will contain the solution 

collection piping resting on the geomembrane. Ore will be placed in 25 ft high lifts on the 

leach pad to an ultimate height of 200 ft. Heap faces will be contoured with catch benches to 

provide an overall operating slope of 2.5:1.  

 

Due to the region's low rainfall and high evaporation rate, control of the project water 

balance will be an important factor in leach operations. To minimize evaporative losses leach 

solutions will be applied to the heap with "drippers", which will also be buried to minimize 

possible freezing problems in the winter. Testwork has indicated that the ore leaches rapidly 

and a single-stage leach system will be designed to deliver 2.5 tons of sodium cyanide 

(NaCN) solution per ton of ore (approximately 90 days at a solution application rate of 0.005 

gpm/ft
2
) for primary leaching. 



  

 
 

 133 

Figure 17.1  

Gemfield Project Conceptual Site Plan 

 



  

 
 

 134 

Leach effluent solutions will be collected in a common launder system at the toe of the heap 

and flow by gravity to the pregnant solution pond. Pregnant solution will be pumped to the 

carbon adsorption plant. Cyanide will be added to barren solution discharged from the carbon 

columns in the barren solution tank before it from where it is returned to leaching. The barren 

solution tank overflows to the barren solution pond as does the pregnant solution pond in the 

event of significant rainstorms. In this way the barren pond functions as the event 

containment pond and will retain pad area runoff until it can be returned to circuit in place of 

raw water.  

 

The pregnant and barren ponds will be double-lined and provided with intermediate leak 

detection monitoring systems. The ponds will be fenced and netting and/or bird balls will be 

provided for wildfowl protection. 

 

The process plant and solution ponds will be located at the northern edge of the leach pad.  

Leaching and gold recovery circuits will be monitored and controlled from an operator's 

station located in the process building. 

 

The high-security refinery area (electrowinning and smelting) will be located adjacent to and 

contiguous with the process building. Carbon adsorption will consist of a single train of five 

up-flow columns. Loaded carbon will be advanced to acid washing with dilute hydrochloric 

acid followed by rinsing with raw water and stripped of the contained metal (elution) in a 

pressure stripping system. Spent acid wash solution and acidified rinse water will be 

neutralized with caustic soda and discharged to the barren pond. Spent eluate will be 

periodically discharged to the adsorption circuit. 

 

Gold and silver will be electrowon from loaded eluate and deposited on stainless steel wool 

cathodes, rinsed-off, decanted and collected as "sludge" which will be dried and smelted on-

site to produce doré bars for shipment to third party refiners.  

 

Stripped carbon will be thermally regenerated in a gas fired rotary kiln operating at 1,200 ºF 

and returned to carbon adsorption.  

 

In accordance with environmental regulations regarding the possible presence of mercury at 

mining operations, the carbon stripping, regeneration, electrowinning cathode and sludge 

handling and smelting circuits will be provided with mercury vapor capture equipment 

 

Bulk handling systems will be provided for the receipt, storage, mixing and distribution of 

sodium hydroxide, sodium cyanide, hydrochloric acid, anti-scalant, activated carbon and 

propane.

17.2 PROCESS DESIGN CRITERIA 
 

Base case process design was developed from experience at similar projects coupled with 

metallurgical test results discussed in Section 13 of this Technical Report. Key criteria used

Note: As discussed in Section 13.0 analysis of test results received suggest that average gold recoveries will be 

slightly higher than originally projected.  The slight increase in production can easily be handled by the 

current process design. 

 

17.3 WATER BALANCE 
 

The raw water requirement is projected at approximately 425 gpm. This water will be 

sourced from dewatering wells installed around the perimeter of the ultimate pit. A raw water 

distribution system will deliver raw water as required for drilling, dust control, process 

makeup, cooling, and reagents. An onsite purification plant will provide potable water.  

 

 

 



  

 
 

 136 

18.0 PROPERTY INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

Onsite ancillary facilities include various infrastructure buildings, power supply, fuel storage 

and distribution, water storage and distribution and sanitary sewage systems. Offsite ancillary 

facilities include realignment to the west of approximately 2-1/2 miles of US Highway 95. 

Figure 17.1 shows the location of the main ancillary infrastructure.  

 

18.1 BUILDINGS 
 

Plant site buildings will include the following modular and engineered structures: 

 

 The administration building is a single-storey modular structure approximately 144 ft 
long by 60 ft wide. This structure will house all of the management, administrative 

and engineering staff. 

 

 The security/safety building is a single-storey, modular structure approximately 38 ft 
long by 24 ft wide. It will be used to control access to the site and incorporate a first 

aid room and an ambulance garage. 

 

 The laboratory consists of a single-storey, modular structure approximately 72 ft long 
by 60 ft wide. It will contain all the sample preparation and analytical facilities 

required to process both mine and process plant samples. 

 

 The truck and plant maintenance shop/warehouse is an engineered steel structure 
approximately 80 ft long by 80 ft wide. It will incorporate one high-bay for truck and 

loader maintenance and two low-bay areas for small vehicle repair and general 

maintenance together with a warehouse area and office space for the maintenance 

staff. A tank farm containing all engine and hydraulic oils, antifreeze and waste fluids 

will be located outside but adjacent to the building.  

 

18.2 POWER SUPPLY 
 

Primary power source will be sourced from the existing 60kV NV Energy power line which 

traverses the project site. This power source will feed a new plant substation where the 

voltage will be reduced to 13.8 kV for in-plant distribution via overhead power lines to 

several unit substations where the voltage will be further reduced to serve the needs of the 

process, administrative and maintenance facilities.  

  

18.3 FUEL STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION 
 

Storage tanks will be provided for gasoline and both off-road and on-road diesel fuel. Storage 

capacities are one 1,000 gallon gasoline tank, one 1,000 gallon on-road diesel tank and two 

25,000 gallon off-road diesel tanks. These tanks will be installed above-ground inside a 



  

 
 

 137 

concrete containment area to contain leaks and will incorporate both bulk and independent 

vehicle dispensing equipment.  

 

18.4 WATER SYSTEMS 
 

Although no significant dewatering activities are envisaged for the first 2 years of mining, 

approximately 425 gpm of raw water will be required for project operations. This water will 

be sourced from six wells installed primarily to the west of the ultimate pit limit. 

 

A raw water storage tank (capacity 360,000 gallons) will be provided on site. Raw water 

distribution pumps will deliver raw water as required for dust control, process makeup, 

cooling, and reagents.  

 

The bottom 20% of the raw water storage tank (72,000 gallons) will be reserved for fire 

protection, serviced by dedicated firewater protection pumps and hydrants.  

 

It is expected that approximately 5 gpm of potable water will be required. This will be 

provided from an on-site purification plant. 

 

18.5 SANITARY SEWAGE SYSTEMS 
 

Sanitary sewage will be collected and treated in two sanitary waste systems each system 

consisting of a septic tank and sanitary leach field. One system will be located adjacent to the 

ADR plant area and the second will service the ancillary building area. 

 

18.6 US HIGHWAY 95 REALIGNMENT 
 

The existing US highway 95 currently traverses the planned Gemfield open pit and will 

therefore need to be realigned. Approximately 2-1/2 miles of new Highway will be 

constructed to the west of the existing road. It will consist of a two lane highway, providing 

Class II access road to the project. The realigned road section will be sited such that there 

will be a minimum distance of 1,000 feet from the future pit so as to avoid the necessity of 

road closures during blasting operations. In addition to relocating the road several utilities in 

the existing Right-Of-Way, including a 12.5 kV NV Energy power line, a section of the town 

of Gemfield well-water supply line, together with a booster pump station and two fiber optic 

cables owned by AT&T and Nevada Hospitals Association respectively, will also be 

reconstructed in the new Right-Of-Way. This realignment project is being coordinated by 

Atkins North America Inc. (Reno, Nevada) under contract to IMZ.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

 

This section provides an overview of environmental and permitting work undertaken and 

requirements for the Property. The work undertaken included development of the 

Environmental Design Criteria, Environmental Baseline Studies, and initial permitting for the 

Project. 

 

20.1 ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN CRITERIA 
 

The Environmental Design Criteria (EDC) was prepared as a technical memorandum by 

SRK, in consultation with IMZ. The EDC defines the environmental aspects relating to soil, 

water, air and noise that will be considered and implemented during design, development and 

closure of the proposed Project.  

 

The relevant design criteria (by category) for environmental protection focus on engineering 

design as well as operational requirements. Also included in the EDC are design 

considerations (based on qualitative requirements) that IMZ considered using during the 

preparation of the Updated Study.  

 

20.2 ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE CONDITIONS  
 

An initial environmental baseline study program was undertaken by MVG in 2003/2004 on 

approximately 696 acres as part of an Environmental Assessment (EA) for what was then 

named the Gemfield Exploration Project. Upon consultation with the BLM, an  additional 

baseline study program was implemented to collect environmental, natural resource and 

socio-economic data required to support the completion of the federal and state agency 

permitting and approval program, and the environmental documentation process that will be 

required under NEPA for the proposed mine at Gemfield. 

 

The topography of the area comprises broad valleys and alluvial fans, low-lying mesas and 

foothills. The foothills and mesas are rocky with drainages and topographic low areas in 

between. The area lies within the southernmost extreme of the Tonopah Section of the Great 

Basin and the northern border of the Mohave Desert.  

 

The climate is arid with average annual precipitation in the area of approximately 6.4 inches, 

most of which falls in the form of winter snow and/or spring rain. Summers are typically dry 

and hot, with occasional summer thunderstorms and average daytime temperatures in the 90 

to 100ºF range. Elevations in the Project area range from approximately 5,400 to 6,000 ft. 

The Property has been mined both historically and recently, leaving much of the area 

disturbed, except for the area directly above the Gemfield deposit, which is beneath a cover 

of alluvium.

20.3 CLOSURE  
 

Mine closure and reclamation for the Project will be conducted in accordance with BLM and 

State of Nevada regulations and guidelines and best practices. A closure and reclamation plan 

will be developed for the Project and will include the open pit, waste rock dump and heap 

leach pad and other ancillary facilities. This plan is also required for the permitting of the 

Project. A closure bond, which is jointly held by the State of Nevada and the BLM, will be 

required to be posted prior to permit approval.  

 

After operations cease, solution in the heap leach pad will be allowed to drain until the rate of 

flow from this facility can be passively managed through evaporation from the ponds or a 

combination of evaporation and infiltration. The barren, pregnant, and storm ponds will be 

backfilled and the double-lined barren and pregnant ponds converted to evaporation cells for 

heap drain-down. 

 

The berm around the perimeter of the pit will be extended and a pit lake will be allowed to 

develop at closure. Pits can sometimes be excluded from requirements to backfill and/or re-

contour at closure under the Nevada mining regulations. However, if possible, backfilling 

some of the pits can sometimes reduce long-term liabilities. This is an option that will be 

evaluated by IMZ during future studies. 

Waste rock and heap leach facilities will be capped with a 2 ft cover and vegetation 

established that will comply with Nevada regulations. Reclamation works will be completed 



 
 

142 

 

in one year. Reclamation monitoring has been assumed for three years for vegetation and ten 

years for water.  

 

Closure costing for the Project has been carried out using the Nevada Standardized 

Reclamation Cost Estimator (SRCE) model version 1.1.2, Heap Leach Drain-down Estimator 

(HLDE) version 1.2, Process Fluid Cost Estimator (PFCE), and 2011 mob-demob cost 

estimator, which are published in the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) 

website. The well closure cost estimate was carried out with the well abandonment sheet of 

the public domain version of the SRCE.  

 

The closure cost associated with the Project is estimated to be $7.36 million.  

 

20.4 PERMITTING 
 

The permitting strategy identifies and addresses the various local, state, federal and 

international environmental and social requirements and standards applicable to the project. 

These include the statutory requirements, stakeholder interests, and environmental, social and 

economic aspects. 

 

The strategy fulfills requirements or standards of the following: 

 

 Local (Esmeralda County land use, environmental and safety requirements). 

 Federal (BLM and other federal agencies with regulatory jurisdiction). 

 State (Nevada) environmental and safety requirements. 

 Canadian securities and CIM requirements for disclosure of liabilities associated with 
environmental aspects, including but not limited to, closure and reclamation. 

 Financial institutions. 

 The Board of Directors of IMZ. 

A multi-agency regulatory process will be completed to obtain all required federal, state, and 

local agency permits and approvals necessary to construct, operate, and ultimately close the 

project.  

 

Nevada permits are issued by the NDEP Bureau of Mining Regulation and Reclamation 

(BMRR). Three primary branches of BMRR include the Regulation Branch that issues water 

pollution control permits (WPCP), the Reclamation Branch that issues reclamation permits 

and the Closure Branch that reviews and approves closure plans. The latter branch is 

involved in an advisory role during project permitting and it reviews, approves, and 

administers formal final closure plans at the end of mine life. Under current NDEP 

administrative procedures, the Regulation Branch also issues permits for dewatering for mine 



 
 

143 

 

projects, in lieu of issuing a discharge permit by the Bureau of Water Pollution Control, in 

order to consolidate and streamline the permitting process for mines into one Bureau.  

 

A review of the permits requirements indicates that the following primary permits/actions 

will be required:  

 

 BLM Plan of Operations (including reclamation, closure, and bond estimate). 

 BLM Environmental Impact Statement. 

 NDEP Water Pollution Control Permit. 

 NDEP Reclamation Permit. 

 NDEP Air Quality Operating Permit. 

 NDEP Mercury Air Quality Operating Permit to Construct. 
 

A number of other permits will be required, but the above will require the most time, effort, 

and cost. Planned timing for the other permits will be such that all permits are received well 

before the proposed construction start date. 

 

The following are the main permits required from the State of Nevada: 

 

 Nevada Air Quality Operating Permit. 

 Nevada Water Pollution Control Permit.  

 Nevada Reclamation Permit. 

 Nevada Water rights.  

 Hazardous Material Storage Permit.   

 Other Permits. 
 

20.4.1 Plan of Operations/Reclamation Permit Application 
 

The NEPA process is initiated by the submission of a Plan of Operations or POO to the BLM 

who will review the document for completeness and to identify potential issues. The POO 

was submitted to the BLM on July 10.  This review will take at least 30 days. The same 

document can be submitted to NDEP as an application for a Reclamation Permit. 

 

The POO includes basic information concerning the company and its principal contact, 

detailed maps showing all project components: size of areas where surface resources will be 

disturbed; information sufficient to describe either the entire operation proposed or 

reasonably foreseeable operations and how they would be conducted, including the nature 

and location of proposed structures and facilities; the type and condition of existing and 

proposed means of access, the means of transportation used or to be used, and the estimated 

period during which the project activities will take place.  

 

The POO includes description of:  

 

 Highway 95 realignment. 

 Open Pit. 



 
 

144 

 

 Material handling. 

 Crushing and Process Facilities. 

 Heap leach. 

 Process Ponds. 

 Water Supply Ponds. 

 Onsite/offsite Roads. 

 Other Land Disturbance. 

 Water Supply. 

 Pipelines. 

 Chemical Storage Facilities. 

 Fuel Storage Facilities (Tanks and Pipelines). 

 Surface Drainage Facilities. 

 Electrical Generation/Transmission Facilities. 

 Noise. 

 Light. 
 

Reclamation is a major part of the POO and must describe the reclamation measures that will 

take place and be used to prepare the reclamation cost estimate for bonding.  

 

Because the NEPA analysis will be performed on the proposed POO, potential impacts have 

already been identified during the Feasibility Study and the Updated Study and mitigation 

incorporated in the design. For example, potentially sensitive cultural sites have been avoided 

in the rerouting of US Highway 95 and location of the waste dump.  

 

20.4.2 NEPA Analysis 
 

After the POO is reviewed and accepted, BLM is required to evaluate the potential impacts 

from the proposed project in accordance with NEPA. These impacts are analyzed through the 

preparation of an EA and/or an EIS. For the Project, it has been determined that an EIS is 

necessary. 

 

During the NEPA process impacts for project construction, operation and closure will be 

evaluated.  These include, at a minimum, the following: 

 

 Air Quality. 

 Cultural Resources. 

 Environmental Justice and Socio-Economic Values. 

 Wildlife. 

 Native American Religious concerns. 

 Vegetation, including Special Status species and Non-Native or Invasive species. 

 Geochemistry. 

 Water quality. 

 Paleontology. 

 Visual Resources. 



 
 

145 

 

The permitting schedule is very much affected by the context of the mine project, including 

the environmental elements in the project area, technical factors specific to the project, local 

community support, the level of public support/controversy, BLM workloads, BLM 

practices, BLM and NDEP staff assigned to the project, the EIS contractor that is selected by 

BLM, other NEPA analyses being conducted at the time, the political context etc.  

 

IMZ is in process of developing a proactive, integrated, project-based management plan to 

meet all concerns, rather than separate, reactive, non-integrated plan. The management plan 

will be structured according to the context of the Project during any given phase and updated 

continuously during the life of the Project. 

 

Successful permitting is as much a result of regulatory and community engagement, 

communications, transparency and superior technical quality as it is with meeting and 

fulfilling explicit statutory and regulatory requirements.  

 

The IMZ technical team believes the Project could be permitted within 18 months from the 

acceptance of the POO for the following reasons: 

 

 Meetings/communications with the BLM in 2012. The BLM advised IMZ of a fast-
tracking mechanism in place for projects in Nevada and development of IMZ's 

Project is being targeted as one of the early ones under this new permitting 

mechanism. The BLM has also instituted a cost recovery program for review of 

projects that requires that the project proponent/owner pay for BLM staff time and 

expenses dedicated to the project. The exact cost of this will not be known until the 

process is initiated and will change depending upon the complexity of the 

environmental review and time to complete the project. 

 

 The lack of many critical natural resources and environmental issues on the Property 
related to designated Areas of Critical Environmental Concern, farm lands, forests 

and rangelands, wild and scenic rivers, wilderness, wetlands, jurisdictional waters 

subject to Clean Water Act, riparian habitat, prime recreational areas and public 

opposition. 

 

 Favorable site characteristics include the geology and rock types associated with the 
mine, the lack of meteoric water (approximately 6.5 inches of annual precipitation) 

and limited and manageable surface water, all of which make the Project favorable 

with regard to management of mine waste rock to prevent acid rock drainage and 

leaching of metals of concern. 

 

 Local attitude to mining. Goldfield is a historic mining area and the local population 
is familiar with mining activities. Interaction with the community indicates a fair 

level of support with the local community. Even though there are active NGO's in 

Nevada, diligent engagement of the local community and stakeholders is a necessity 

and can help offset the inevitable state-level and national anti-mining sentiment. 

 



 
 

146 

 

 Many members of the IMZ project team have been involved with development of 
mining projects in both the western USA, including Nevada, and internationally, 

including several high profile mining projects. Their understanding of stakeholder 

and community concerns, technical issues, regulatory process, and government 

officials will be beneficial to guide the Project through the permit process.

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 

22.1 BASIS OF EVALUATION 
 

Micon has prepared its assessment of the Gemfield Project on the basis of a discounted cash 

flow model, from which Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), payback 

and other measures of project viability can be determined. Assessments of NPV are generally 

accepted within the mining industry as representing the economic value of a project after 

allowing for the weighted cost of capital invested. 

 

The objective of the study is to determine the viability of the proposed open pit mine and 

heap leaching process plant to exploit the Project. In order to do this, the cash flow arising 

from the base case has been forecast, enabling a computation of the NPV to be made. The 

sensitivity of this NPV to changes in the base case assumptions is then examined. 

 

22.2 MACRO-ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS 
 

22.2.1 Exchange Rate and Inflation 
 

All results are expressed in United States dollars. Cost estimates and other inputs to the cash 

flow model for the project have been prepared using constant, first quarter 2013 money 

terms, i.e. without provision for escalation or inflation. 

 

22.2.2 Cost of Equity Capital 
 

The cash flow projections used for the valuation have been prepared on an all-equity basis. 

 

In order to estimate the NPV of the cash flows forecast for the Project, an appropriate 

discount factor must be applied which represents the cost of equity capital (CEC) imposed on 

the project by the capital markets. This being the case, CEC is equal to the market cost of 

equity, and can be determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM): 

 

 (  )       ( (  )     ) 
 

Where E(Ri) is the expected return, or the cost of equity. Rf is the risk-free rate (usually taken 

to be the real rate on long-term government bonds), E(Rm)-Rf is the market premium for 

equity, commonly estimated to be around 5%, and beta (β) is the volatility of the returns for 

the relevant sector of the market compared to the market as a whole. 

 

Figure 22.1 illustrates the real return on US bonds computed by Federal Reserve, taken as a 

proxy for the risk-free interest rate. Recently, this has dropped from around 2.0% to less than 

0.5%. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that using a long-term average rate will give a 

more reliable estimate of the cost of equity. Micon has therefore used a value of 2.0% for the 

risk free rate, close to the real rate of return averaged over 10 years. 

 



 
 

153 

 

Figure 22.1  

Real Return on US Bonds 

(source: US Federal Reserve) 

 

 
 

Taking beta for this sector of the equity market to be in the range 0.7 (among larger gold 

producers) to 1.3 (typical for the mining sector), CAPM gives a cost of equity for the Project 

of between 5% and 9%, as shown in Table 22.1. Micon has taken a figure in the middle of 

this range as its base case, and provides the results at alternative rates of discount for 

comparative purposes.  

 
Table 22.1  

Cost of Equity Capital 

 

Range Lower Middle Upper 

Risk Free Rate (%) 1.5 2.0 2.5 

Market Premium for equity (%) 5.0 5.0 5.0 

Beta 0.7 1.0 1.3 

Cost of equity (%) 5.0 7.0 9.0 

 

22.2.3 Expected Gold Prices 
 

Figure 22.2 shows the monthly average gold price over the past ten years, together with the 

3-year trailing average. At the end of May, 2013, the three-year trailing average price was 

$1,546/oz gold. However, in the economic evaluation, a more conservative price of 

$1,350/oz was selected, being close to the spot price prevailing at the time of the economic 

analysis of the Project. This metal price was then applied consistently throughout the 

operating period of the LOM of the Project. 

 

Silver was not attributed any value in the economic evaluation, notwithstanding that small 

amounts of silver are expected to be present in the doré produced at Gemfield.

For comparison, Micon also evaluated the project with gold at $1,050, $1,200, $1,500 and 

$1,650/oz. As part of its sensitivity analysis, Micon also tested a range of prices 20% above 

and below the base case value. 

 

22.2.4 Taxation Regime 
 

US federal income tax and Nevada Net Proceeds of Minerals (NPOM) tax have been allowed 

for in the cash flow model. Regular and alternative minimum tax (AMT) was taken into 

consideration for federal tax.  

 

Depreciation is applied on a unit of production basis and a 15% depletion allowance is taken, 

where applicable. Net operating loss carry-forwards related to the Property of $36.5 million 

are also taken into account. 

 

22.2.5 Royalty 
 

A 5% NSR royalty, payable to third parties, has been provided for in the cash flow model on 

100% of the production from Gemfield. There is currently no federal or state royalty. 

 

22.3 TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS 
 

The technical parameters, production forecasts and estimates described elsewhere in this 

report are reflected in the base case cash flow model. These inputs to the model are 

summarized below. The measures used in the study are short tons and troy ounces. Where 

applicable, the metric equivalents of these are given here for reference only.

22.3.1 Mine Production Schedule 
 

The mine plan was prepared on a quarterly basis and consolidated into annual periods for the 

purposes of the economic evaluation.  

 

Waste mining is scheduled to start one quarter-period earlier than ore mining, with 

approximately 2.3 million tons of waste rock mined prior to the first ore being placed on the 

heap. Figure 22.3 shows the annual mining of ore and waste rock mining of all types, 

including alluvium, as well as ore grade (expressed in g/t Au) and the waste-to-ore ratio. 

 
Figure 22.3  

Annual Mining Production Schedule 

(Showing Head Grade in grams per tonne (g/t)) 

 

 
 

Process plant throughput is held steady over the LOM period at 3.01 million tons annually. 

Except for 105,750 tons re-handled from a temporary stockpile in Year 1, all material 

processed is direct (run-of-mine) feed to the crusher.   

 

A gold recovery of 85.2% is forecast over the LOM. The timing of sales is adjusted to reflect 

an inventory of recoverable gold in the leach pad equivalent to a 90 day production cycle. 

 

Silver is present in the ore and a small amount will be recovered into the doré product. 

However, silver is not expected to make a significant contribution to project economics and 

is not used in the economic evaluation of the Project. 

 

22.3.2 Selling Expenses 
 

Doré transport charges of $5,000 per shipment, based on a weekly schedule, have been 

allowed for. Insurance charges of 0.1% of doré value are also provided.

Refining charges are estimated at $5.00/oz gold, based on similar mining projects elsewhere 

in the USA and internationally. Payability was estimated to be 99.9% of gold in the doré. 

 

22.3.3 Closure Costs 
 

Estimated closure costs for the project are $7.36 million. Although this cost will only be 

incurred at the end of the Project life, the cash flow model assumes that a bond will be 

lodged for 25% of this amount (i.e. $1.84 million) upon Project start-up, and that the balance 

of the closure costs will be secured by way of insurance or similar financial instrument at an 

annual cost of 1.5% of that amount (i.e., $82,771 each year until closure). The closure costs 

are off-set by a refund in income tax in respect of the post-closure losses incurred.  

 

22.3.4 Operating Costs 
 

Direct operating costs average $13.05/T treated over the LOM period, comprising $6.03/T 

for mining, $5.21/T for processing, and $1.80/T for general and administrative (G&A) costs, 

including permitting and environmental expenses. 

 

Figure 22.4 shows these expenditures over the LOM period, compared to the net sales 

revenue, showing the strong margin maintained over the LOM period in the base case. Over 

the LOM period, unit operating costs trend downward from over $13.50/T to around $12/T as 

the volume of waste rock mined reduces annually.

22.3.5 Capital Costs

indirect costs, and $34.3 million for owner's costs (including $20.9 million for realignment 

of US Highway 95), and contingencies totaling $14.1 million.  

 

Working capital has been estimated to include 90 days product inventory in the heap leach 

circuit and 15 days receivables from dispatch of doré. Stores provision is for 30 days of 

consumables and spares inventory, less 30 days accounts payable. An average of $4.2 million 

of working capital is required over the LOM period. 

 

Figure 22.5 compares annual capital expenditures over the preproduction and LOM periods 

with the project's cash operating margin.

22.3.6 Base Case Cash Flow 
 

The LOM base case project cash flow is presented in Figure 22.6 and Table 22.2. The 

application of gold revenue to each main area of usage is shown in Figure 22.7. Annual cash 

flows are presented in Table 22.3. 

 

Direct site operating costs equate to $13.05/T. Adding bullion transport and refining costs 

gives an estimated cash operating cost of $524/oz gold produced. The NSR royalty and 

Nevada Net Proceeds of Minerals (NPOM) tax bring total cash cost estimates to $612/oz of 

gold produced.

22.3.7 Base Case Evaluation 
 

The Project demonstrates an undiscounted pay back of 3.2 years, or approximately 3.8 years 

discounted at 7.0%, leaving a production tail of just over 2 years. The base case generates an 

IRR of 23.2% before tax and 20.4% after tax. At a discount rate of 7.0%, the net present 

value (NPV7) of the cash flow is $92.4 million before tax and $73.4 million after tax.  

 

Table 22.4 presents the results at comparative discount rates of 5%/year, 7%/year and 

9%/year.

22.4 SENSITIVITY STUDY 
 

22.4.1 Capital, Operating Costs and Revenue Sensitivity 
 

The sensitivity of the project returns to changes in all revenue factors (including grades, 

recoveries, prices and exchange rate assumptions) together with capital and operating costs 

was tested over a range of 20% above and below base case values. The results show that the 

project is most sensitive to revenue factors, with an adverse change of 20% reducing NPV7 

from $73.4 million to $8.9 million. The impact of changes in capital and operating costs are 



 
 

162 

 

almost identical: adverse changes of 20% reduce NPV7 to $49.1 million and $47.2 million, 

respectively. 

 

In Micon's analysis, applying an increase of more than 30% in both capital and operating 

costs simultaneously would be required to reduce NPV7 to below zero. 

 

Figure 22.8 shows the results of changes in each factor separately.

Sensitivity Diagram 

 

 
 

22.4.2 Metal Price and Discount Rate Assumptions 
 

The sensitivity of the project to variation in gold price was tested using values of $1,050/oz, 

$1,200/oz, $1,350/oz (base case), $1,500/oz and $1,650/oz over the life-of-mine period, as 

shown in Figure 22.9.  

 

The base case price of $1,350/oz approximates the spot price at the time of Micon's 

economic evaluation estimate and is below the three-year trailing average price of $1,546/oz 

at the end of May, 2013, At $1,050/oz gold the project approaches an economic breakeven 

(zero NPV) using the base-case annual discount rate of 7%.

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 

IMZ controls most of the minerals rights for the Property. The other significant group of 

mineral claims and patents are owned by Lode-Star Gold Inc., who controls an area adjacent 

to the town of Goldfield (which currently is subject to an option agreement with Corazon 

Gold Corp.). In addition, there are some minor claims in the area of the Combination Pit, 

where IMZ and Lode-Star Gold share ownership. Multiple small claims within and around 

IMZ property have individual owners.

24.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 

24.1 PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 
 

A comprehensive project schedule was developed by IMZ and Micon. This schedule has 

been derived from information developed during execution of the Feasibility Study and the 

Updated Study for the Project. It reflects a phased approach to the engineering, permitting, 

procurement, construction (EPCM) and commissioning of the Project. 

 

The final approval of the EIS is the critical issue for all on-site development and construction 

activities at Gemfield.  

 

Although the Project has been evaluated on a 100% equity basis, IMZ may fund the project 

from a combination of working capital and debt. Due to the market capitalization of IMZ, the 

existing cash-flow from its Peruvian projects - the Pallancata silver mine and the anticipated 

cash-flow (in 2015) from the Inmaculada gold mine - IMZ anticipates that raising the finance 

necessary to implement the development and construction of the Project should not present a 

significant challenge.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

The Goldfield property (the Property) is located in the historic Goldfield Mining District of 

Goldfield, Nevada, USA (the Goldfield Mining District) approximately 30 miles south of 

Tonopah, Nevada, adjacent to the town of Goldfield in Esmeralda County. The Property 

includes three known mineralized deposits, Goldfield Main, McMahon Ridge and Gemfield. 

Mineral resources for all three of these deposits have been updated.   

 

The Gemfield Project (the Project) currently comprises the development of Gemfield as an 

open-pit heap leach operation and IMZ has completed an update of the Feasibility Study (the 

Updated Study) on the potential production of gold and silver from this deposit. The Updated 

Study is based on the proposed open-pit mining and heap leach processing of the mineral 

reserves at a rate of 8,250 dry short tons per day (T/d) to produce a gold and silver doré 

product on-site.   

 

25.1 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 

The mineral resource estimates for the Gemfield deposit was updated from 3D block models 

in which grades have been interpolated from drill-hole data using ordinary kriging within 

separate geological and statistical domains.   

 

Table 25.1 summarizes the current estimate of the mineral resources at the Gemfield deposit 

at a cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au.

25.2 GOLDFIELD UPDATED STUDY 
 

The Updated Study is based on the proposed open-pit mining of the Gemfield deposit and 

heap leach processing of the mineral reserves at a rate of 8,250 dry short tons per day (T/d) to 

produce a gold doré product on-site.   

 

The results of the Updated Study comprise the following: 

 



 
 

167 

 

 Total proven and probable reserves of 19.0 million T grading 0.0298 oz/T containing 
567,000 oz of gold. 

 Target nominal annual heap leach mill feed rate of 8,250 T/y. 

 Life-of-mine (LOM) waste-to-leach feed ratio of 2.14. 

 The life of the operating mine will be approximately six years. 

 Conventional open-pit mining techniques and gold heap leach processing technology 
will be used to produce a gold doré product. 

 Estimated LOM gold recovery of 85.2%.  

 Estimated LOM gold production of 483,000 oz and an average annual production of 
approximately 76,000 oz.   

 Access to site will be via the nearby US Highway 95. 

 Electrical power will be provided from the existing power line which traverses the 
project site, on-site generation will be for emergency purposes only. 

The results of the Updated Study are summarized in Table 25.2.  All dollars are in United 

States Dollars.
