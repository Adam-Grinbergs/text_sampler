Executive Summary 

The Pyramid Project is an early stage copper molybdenum gold exploration prospect located in 

Alaska, USA. 

This technical report documents the mineral resource estimate for the Pyramid prospect. It was 

prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 

43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral 

Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines". 

Property Description, Location, Access and Physiography 

The Pyramid Project is located on the southwestern tip of the Alaskan Peninsula approximately 

890 km by air southwest of Anchorage, centered on NAD83 coordinates N394450, E6165953 

Zone 4N. The nearest town is the fishing village of Sand Point on Popof Island, 33 km south-

southeast of the Pyramid Project. Access to the property is via a daily flight from Anchorage to 

the regional airport in Sandpoint. People and supplies are ferried 25 km across the Unga Straight 

that separates Sand Point and the camp on Balboa Bay. 

Prominent volcanic geographical references are the Veniaminof Volcano (140 km northeast) and 

the Pavlof Volcanoes (80 km southwest). The project is set in the upper most part of a west 

draining basin that works its way north out to Herendeen Bay and towards Bristol Bay. Elevations 

vary from 150 m above sea level in the valley to the south to 850 m at the top of Pyramid Peak. 

The terrain is moderate to steep and sparsely vegetated as much of the work area is considered 

to be above the tree line. Rock scree-talus is commonplace throughout the area and rock outcrop 

is generally sparse. In the lower elevations, minor tundra and low-lying shrubs are present. 

The Pyramid property consists of 21,385 hectares, encompassing 83 mineral claims. Lands at the 

project are split into separate surface and sub-surface (mineral) ownership. The sub-surface 

(mineral) rights are held by The Aleut Corporation ("TAC"), whereas the surface rights are held by 

the Shumagin Corporation in some areas and the Tanadgusix Corporation ("TDX") in others. The 

Company acquired the property from Full Metal Minerals Ltd. ("FMM") as a result of a plan of 

arrangement involving Choice Gold, 0999279 and Full Metal Minerals Ltd. and approved on 

October 21, 2014.  

FMM had entered into an option agreement ("Pyramid Agreement") with The Aleut Corporation 

("TAC"), an Alaska Regional Native Corporation, on January 5, 2007, to acquire a 100% interest 

in subsurface mineral rights covering the Pyramid project. A letter agreement was reached with 

the Shumagin Corporation for lease of eight townships within their surface owned estate. At 

present there are no outstanding hindrances with respect to land status at the Pyramid Project.

History 

The history of Pyramid dates back to the mid-1970s when geologists from the Aleut Corp -

Quintana-Duval joint venture identified porphyry copper-molybdenum potential during regional 

reconnaissance along the Alaskan Peninsula. Although Pan American Petroleum was active in 

the region during the 1960s, there is no evidence they conducted exploration at Pyramid other 

than possible claim staking. There is no evidence of historic mining or prospecting in the Pyramid 

area, which is relatively uncommon for a broadly mineralized and partly exposed porphyry 

system. 

The Aleut-Quintana-Duval Joint-Venture group initiated surface mapping and geochemical 

sampling in 1974, which ultimately defined a large area of porphyry-style alteration and copper-

molybdenum mineralization sufficient to warrant a 1975 drill program. In 1975, Aleut-Quintana-

Duval completed 19 core holes for a total of 1692 m which confirmed the presence of a broad 

area of copper and molybdenum mineralization to a maximum depth of 168 m. The distribution of 

holes and broad Cu-Mo mineralization allowed Aleut-Quintana-Duval to produce a shallow (less 

than 100 m) resource estimation (Christie, J. S., 1975). The 1975 program was followed-up in 

1976 with a one-hole program, placed on a prior site which had poor recovery in the chalcocite 

enrichment zone; however, the results did not indicate higher grades and the entire program was 

abandoned. 

Minor rock and stream sediment sampling was performed at Pyramid between 1979 and 1991, 

and the exploration was gold oriented, thus most samples were typically analyzed for gold, silver, 

mercury, and arsenic. 

Full Metal Minerals (FMM) completed five induced polarization ("IP") lines and several miles of 

ground magnetics along with rock chip sampling and outcrop lithologic-alteration mapping. During 

2006, exploration by FMM focused upon a rock channel sampling program on continuous 

exposures in one of the principal creeks transecting the Pyramid porphyry system. A total of 113 

rock chip samples were collected and only analyzed for gold, copper and molybdenum. 

In 2010, FMM initiated a drilling program on the Pyramid Project drilling a total of 30 core holes 

between 2010 and 2012. The drilling resulted in the estimation of an inferred mineral resource 

totalling 173 million tonnes grading 0.35% copper and 0.02% molybdenum. The mineral resource 

is considered historical as defined in NI 43-101. The historical mineral resource was estimated 

using Gemcom's GemsTM (Gems) 3D block modeling software in multiple passes in 25 by 25 by 

10 m blocks by ordinary kriging. Grade estimates were based on capped 2 m composited assay 

data. Capping levels were set at 1.3% Cu for the supergene and 0.83% Cu for the hypogene 

zone. Mo was capped at 0.1% and 0.08% for the supergene and hypogene zones respectively. 

Gold grades were capped at 4.2 g/t for the supergene and 0.215 g/t for the hypogene zone. In 

calculating the CuEq, SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. utilized the long-term metal prices provided 

by Energy and Metals Consensus Forecast (Cu US$ 3.54/lb, Mo US$ 18.23/lb, Au US$ 1,480/oz) 

and no metal recoveries were applied. Mineral resources were classified in accordance with 

definitions provided by the Canadian Institute of Mining (CIM) as stipulated in NI43-101. All 

interpolated blocks were classified as Inferred Mineral Resource.

In order to quantify the Mineral Resources requirement of "reasonable prospects of economic 

extraction", the block model was subjected to conceptual mining limits using an open pit 

optimization program. The historical mineral resource estimate is relevant in that it provides a 

good indication of the size of the deposit before the CopperBank drill program. The historical 

estimate should no longer be relied upon as it is now obsolete and replaced by the mineral 

resource presented in Section 13 of this technical report. 

CopperBank is not treating the historical mineral resources as current mineral resources or 

mineral reserves and SRK has not done the work necessary to classify the historical estimate as 

current mineral resource or mineral reserves.  

Geological Setting and Mineralization 

The Pyramid Project is located in the 'Ring of Fire', in a portion of the arc which contains a 

number of other porphyry copper epithermal gold deposits in addition to hundreds of metal 

occurrences. The project area is located in a volcanic arc setting, approximately 20 km from the 

Pacific-North America convergent plate boundary. The volcanic arc is derived from semi-

continuous tectonic activity and oceanic crust subduction since the Mesozoic and currently 

represented by a chain of nearly 80 volcanoes throughout the Aleutian island chain and the 

Alaskan Peninsula. 

The Pyramid Cu-Mo mineralization is centered on several late Miocene porphyry intrusions, likely 

quartz diorite in composition, which is hosted by a sequence of Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary 

clastic sedimentary rocks. The intrusive bodies are small (<200 m) stocks or dikes and are 

exposed in an area of at least 2.5 km x 1.5 km largely within an east-west trending glacial valley. 

Available drill hole data suggest that most of these intrusive units occur as vertical bodies but 

existence of smaller sills cannot be ruled out. They have similar mineralogy of plagioclase, biotite 

and amphibole with variable occurrence and abundance of quartz phenocrysts. Texture of the 

rocks varies from small to coarse grained porphyritic to coarse equigranular texture. 

Exploration and Drilling 

In 2017, CopperBank drilled 14 holes totalling 3,660 metres.   

Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security 

CopperBank has used a robust procedure for sampling, sample preparation, analysis and 

security. Assay samples were collected from half core sawed lengthwise with an unbiased 

sampling interval of two meters through the entire length of the drill holes starting at bedrock. 

Assaying protocols include the use of commercial certified control samples, sample blanks and 

duplicates to monitor the accuracy of the laboratory, ALS-Chemex Vancouver, ALS USA Reno or 

their preparation laboratory in Fairbanks Alaska.

Data Verifications 

Exploration data verification for the Pyramid Project has included a site visit by SRK, enforced 

database structures, analytical quality assurance and quality control samples and assay 

checking. 

SRK Associate, Dr. Gilles Arseneau, visited the site in March 2013 and on August 10 to 12, 2017 

to examine drill core, core logging and sampling procedures, and view the drill sites. Drill site 

locations were verified with hand-held GPS and were found to agree with the digital database of 

drill hole locations. 

SRK conducted routine verifications to ascertain the reliability of the electronic borehole database 

provided by CopperBank and completed an audit of the CopperBank analytical and quality control 

data acquired during the sampling of the Pyramid deposit. All assays in the current database 

were verified against the independently sourced sample certificates from ALS Laboratories and 

ActLabs.  

After the review, SRK concluded that the Pyramid drilling database was sufficiently reliable for 

inclusion in resource estimation. 

Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

Antofagasta collected a small suite of pulps from the 2011 and 2012 drilling programs and had 

them tested at an ALS-Minerals laboratory in Chile. Samples were selected based upon high 

estimated chalcocite content and tested for leaching potential. 

Mineral Resource Estimates 

SRK utilized Geovia's Gems version 6.8 to complete the Mineral Resource estimation. A 

comprehensive and validated drill hole database including 63 drill holes was utilized to complete 

the analysis. 

Three domains were modeled: a very low-grade leach cap varying between zero to 90 m in 

thickness (not estimated); a supergene enrichment zone below the leach cap with variable depth 

extending to 250 m below surface in some areas and defined by increased chalcocite 

mineralization and higher copper values; and the primary hypogene mineralized zone, with 

copper mainly occurring as chalcopyrite, underlying the supergene zone in most areas. 

The Pyramid resource was estimated using multiple passes in 25 by 25 by 10 m blocks by 

ordinary kriging. Grade estimates were based on capped 2 m composited assay data. Capping 

levels were set at 1.5% Cu for the hypogene zone. Mo was capped at 0.2% and 0.15% for the 

supergene and hypogene zones respectively. Gold grades were capped at 0.6 g/t for the 

supergene and hypogene zones. In calculating the copper equivalent (CuEq) grades, SRK 

utilized the long-term metal prices provided by Energy and Metals Consensus Forecast (Cu US$ 

3.54/lb, Mo US$ 9.00/lb, Au US$ 1,400/oz). Recoveries of 90%, 60% and 50% were applied to 

copper, molybdenum and gold respectively.

Mineral resources were classified in accordance with definitions provided by the Canadian 

Institute of Mining ("CIM") as stipulated in NI43-101. All interpolated blocks were classified as 

Inferred Mineral Resource. 

In order to quantify the Mineral Resources requirement of "reasonable prospects of economic 

extraction", the block model was subjected to conceptual mining limits using an open pit 

optimization program. The process uses reasonable mining and processing parameters to define 

a conceptual pit within which the material with reasonable economic prospects should be 

contained. The inferred resources for the Pyramid deposit reported at Copper cut-off grade of 

0.20% are summarized in Table i.

Cu US$3.54lb, Mo US$9.00/lb and Au US$1400/oz and 90% recovery for copper, 60% for molybdenum and 50% for 
gold. All numbers have been rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate. Mineral resources are reported in 
relation to a conceptual pit shell. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic 
viability. Numbers may not add up because of rounding of values. 

 

Conclusion and Recommendations 

The Pyramid Project is an early stage copper-molybdenum-gold exploration prospect located on 

the southwestern tip of the Alaskan Peninsula, Alaska, USA. Drilling by CopperBank and the 

previous owners has identified Cu-Mo mineralization centered on several small late Miocene 

porphyry intrusions, hosted by a sequence of Late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary clastic sedimentary 

rock.  

Mineral resources were estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of 

Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices" guidelines by ordinary kriging using 

Geovia's Gems software. Mineral resources may be affected by further infill and exploration 

drilling that may result in increases or decreases in subsequent resource estimates. 

SRK is not aware of any significant risks and uncertainties that could be expected to affect the 

reliability or confidence in the early stage exploration information discussed herein. 

SRK recommends that CopperBank continues the exploration on the Pyramid Project, 

specifically, SRK recommends that the next exploration phase includes a 2,500 m drilling 

program comprising of 10 additional drill holes to expand and further delineate the porphyry 

mineralization. Contingent on positive results of the drilling program, SRK recommends that

CopperBank carry out a Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") of the Pyramid Project. The 

total cost of the combined recommended program is estimated to be approximately 

US$1,600,000.

 Introduction and Terms of Reference 

The Pyramid Copper Project is an early stage copper-molybdenum porphyry exploration project 

located in Alaska. It is located on the southwestern tip of the Alaskan Peninsula approximately 

890 km by air southwest of Anchorage and 33 km northwest of Sand Point, the nearest town. 

CopperBank Resources Corp. ("CopperBank") has an agreement to earn a 100% interest in the 

Project.  

In June 2017, CopperBank commissioned SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. ("SRK") to visit the 

property and prepare a geological and mineral resource model for the Pyramid Project. The 

services were rendered between June and December 2017 leading to the preparation of the 

mineral resource statement reported herein.   

This technical report documents a mineral resource statement for the Pyramid Project prepared 

by SRK following the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 

43-101 and Form 43-101F1. The mineral resource statement reported herein was prepared in 

conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 

Best Practice Guidelines." 

1.1 Scope of Work 

The scope of work, as defined in a letter of engagement executed on June 21, 2017 between 

CopperBank and SRK includes the construction of a mineral resource model for the Copper-

Molybdenum porphyry mineralization delineated by drilling on the Pyramid Project and the 

preparation of an independent technical report in compliance with National Instrument 43-101 and 

Form 43-101F1 guidelines. This work typically involves the assessment of the following aspects 

of this project: 

• Topography, landscape, access; 

• Regional and local geology; 

• Exploration history; 

• Audit of exploration work carried out on the project; 

• Geological modelling; 

• Mineral resource estimation and validation; 

• Preparation of a mineral resource statement; and 

• Recommendations for additional work.

1.2 Work Program 

The mineral resource statement reported herein is a collaborative effort between CopperBank 

and SRK personnel. The exploration database was compiled and maintained by CopperBank and 

was audited by SRK. The geological model and outlines for the porphyry mineralization were 

constructed by SRK from a two-dimensional geological interpretation. In the opinion of SRK, the 

geological model is a reasonable representation of the distribution of the targeted mineralization 

at the current level of sampling. The geostatistical analysis, variography and grade models were 

completed by SRK during the months of November and December 2017.   

The mineral resource statement reported herein was prepared in conformity with generally 

accepted CIM "Exploration Best Practices" and "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral 

Reserves Best Practices" guidelines. This technical report was prepared following the guidelines 

of the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1.  

The technical report was assembled in SRK Vancouver during the months of December 2017 and 

January 2018.

The resource evaluation work and the compilation of this technical report was completed by Dr. 

Gilles Arseneau, PGeo (APEGBC, 23474), under the supervision of Marek Nowak, PEng 

(APEGBC, 119958). By virtue of their education, membership to a recognized professional 

association and relevant work experience, Gilles Arseneau and Marek Nowak are independent 

Qualified Persons as this term is defined by National Instrument 43-101. 

Marek Nowak, PEng, reviewed drafts of this technical report prior to their delivery to CopperBank 

as per SRK internal quality management procedures. Marek Nowak did not visit the project. 

1.5 Site Visit 

In accordance with National Instrument 43-101 guidelines, Dr. Arseneau visited the Pyramid 

Project in March of 2013 and between August 10 and 12, 2017 accompanied by Gianni 

Kovacevic, Brigitte Dejou and Thomas Ullrich of CopperBank.  

The purpose of the site visit was to review the digitalization of the exploration database and 

validation procedures, review exploration procedures, define geological modelling procedures, 

examine drill core, interview project personnel and to collect all relevant information for the 

preparation of a revised mineral resource model and the compilation of a technical report. During 

the visit, a particular attention was given to the treatment and validation of historical drilling data.  

The site visit also aimed at investigating the geological and structural controls on the distribution 

of the gold mineralization in order to aid the construction of three dimensional gold mineralization 

domains. 

SRK was given full access to relevant data and conducted interviews of CopperBank personnel to 

obtain information on the past exploration work, to understand procedures used to collect, record, 

store and analyze historical and current exploration data.

3.2 Underlying Agreements 

A lease agreement was completed on the 30th of June, 2010 granting Full Metal Minerals 

("FMM") and its affiliates, conditional exploration rights in specific lands outlined in the agreement, 

particularly lands in the Pyramid Project area. A separate surface lease agreement was obtained 

with the TDX Corporation in July, 2010. A letter agreement was reached with the Shumagin 

Corporation for lease of eight townships within their surface owned estate. The agreements 

provided FMM access to the surface owned lands with the right to conduct mineral exploration 

and ultimately mining if there is sufficient encouragement to proceed.  



SRK Consulting 
Pyramid Copper-Molybdenum Project Technical Report Page 12 

 

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

On October 21, 2014, CopperBank acquired the Pyramid Property through a plan of arrangement 

involving Choice Gold, 0999279 and Full Metal Minerals Ltd. 

The exploration agreement has been extended for calendar years 2018 and 2019. CopperBank 

will make a minimum exploration expenditure of USD $1,000,000 for each year. On or before 

January 1, 2020, CopperBank has the option to enter into a mine lease for portions of the 

Pyramid exploration lands on the same terms set out in the original option agreement signed 

June 30, 2010. 

3.3 Permits and Authorization 

Permits required for the Pyramid Project include the Alaska Costal Management Permit from the 

Alaska Division of Mining, Land & Water, the Miscellaneous Land Use Permit, also from the 

Alaska Division of Mining, Land and Water and a water use permit from the Army Corp of 

Engineers ("AMPC") permit, all of which have been received and are in good standing. 

3.4 Environmental Considerations 

Preliminary base-line hydrology and water quality sampling were initiated in 2012. APC Services 

LLC. collected preliminary baseline hydrological, water quality, fishery and habitat data at 8 sites 

on streams located around the deposit area (APC Services, 2012). Data were collected twice 

during the 2012 drilling season – once at the beginning of August and once at the beginning of 

September. For both data collection events, discharge measurements and elevation survey data 

were collected, along with water quality samples for laboratory analysis and field parameters 

were collected using a YSI 556 multi-parameter meter ("YSI"). In August, a cross sectional profile 

survey was performed. 

Field water quality parameters collected showed interesting results. Sites located north of the 

deposit area, recorded abnormally low pH values. Field observations indicated that these surface 

water sites were located on run through a sulfide deposit, which would explain the low pH values 

recorded. Specific conductivity and ORP values for these same three sites were also quite high 

compared to the other values. 

There are no known existing environmental liabilities on the Pyramid Project.  

3.5 Mining Rights in Alaska 

When Alaska became a state in 1959, Section 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act provided that any 

existing Alaska Native land claims would be unaffected by statehood and held in status quo. In 

1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act ("ANCSA") was signed into law thereby 

settling First Nations claims to aboriginal lands in Alaska. In return, First Nations received up 

to 44 million acres (180,000 km2) of land and were paid $963 million. The land and money 

were divided among regional, urban, and village tribal corporations established under the 

law.

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

There are three ANSCA corporations involved at the Pyramid Project, the Shumagin and 

Tanadgusix village Corporations are the surface owners and the Aleut Corporation own the 

mineral titles.  Section 7(i) and (j) of the ANSCA act provide that 70% of revenues from 

timber resources and the sub-surface rights be shared annually with the village corporations. 

All mineral rights around the Pyramid Project are controlled by the Aleut Corporation and as 

such mining rights to the project are governed by an agreement with the Aleut Corporation. 

Exploration and mining agreements with Native Corporation do contain a few unique 

considerations which vary depending on the Corporation.  These include: the approval from the 

villages surrounding the exploration activity, an employment clause to provide jobs and training 

for regional shareholders, and scholarship fund donations. Some provisions may also include 

bidding preferences, job training programs, periodic information meetings for affected villages and 

the establishment of committees to insure that subsistence resources are not harmed by the 

exploration activities.

 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure 
and Physiography 

4.1 Accessibility 

Access to the property is via a flight from Anchorage to the regional airport in Sandpoint. People 

and supplies are ferried 25 km across the Unga Straight that separates Sand Point and the camp 

on Balboa Bay. This occurs either via boat or helicopter. Several kilometres of existing dirt roads 

exist on the property and date back to 1975 when the first exploration program was conducted. 

An access road from Balboa Bay to the project site also exists but is in need of major repairs and 

only passable with all-terrain vehicles ("ATV") at the moment.  Drill moves were done using 

helicopter to minimize surface impact for the 2017 drill program. 

4.2 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The nearest town is the fishing village of Sand Point which is on the northwest side of Popof 

Island and 33 km south-southeast of the Pyramid Project (Figure 3.2). Sand Point has a 

population which varies from about 2000 in the summer to 1200 in the winter. Commercial fishing 

is the key industry of Sand Point and the surrounding towns of Cold Bay (135 km southwest), 

King Cove (119 km southwest), Nelson Lagoon (50 km north), and Bear Lake (48 km northeast). 

4.3 Climate 

Temperatures at nearby Sand Point range from highs near 60°F (15°C) in the summer to lows 

around 20°F (-6°C) in the winter. The daytime and nighttime temperatures vary daily by about 

10°F (6°C). Precipitation is common; snow from autumn to spring and rain when the 

temperatures allow it. The truncated summer often does not allow for snow to fully melt from 

winter to winter, although by August/September the area of snow cover has often decreased a 

considerable amount compared to the start of the season. The weather is generally unpredictable 

and typically windy with fronts ascending from both the north and south, however, exploration 

work or mining activity can be carried out year-round.  

4.4 Physiography 

The project is set in the upper most part of a west draining basin that works its way north out to 

Herendeen Bay and towards Bristol Bay. Elevations vary from sea level to the south to 850 m at 

the top of Pyramid Peak; however, most exploration activities have been conducted in the range 

of 300 m to 600 m. The terrain is moderate to steep and sparsely vegetated as much of the work 

area is considered to be above the tree line (Figure 4.1). Rock scree-talus is commonplace 

throughout the area and rock outcrop is generally sparse. In the lower elevations, minor tundra 

and low-lying shrubs are present. There is also minor alder growth in some of the lower 

elevations to the south.

 History 

5.1 Early History 

Exploration, prospecting, and mining in the region dates back to 1882 when coal was identified 

and extracted on Unga Island followed shortly thereafter with the discovery of gold on both 

Shumagin and Unga Islands. Gold mining in 1886 at the Apollo vein on Unga Island is considered 

the first gold mining operation in the state of Alaska. The Apollo produced approximately 112,000 

ounces of gold between 1886 and 1914 through the extraction of nearly 500,000 tons of free 

milling rock. Approximately 18 km north of Pyramid are Cretaceous aged bituminous coal beds 

that were identified in 1889, though they proved difficult to extract, possibly due to structural 

complexity.  

The history of Pyramid dates back to the mid-1970s when geologists from the Aleut Corp -

Quintana-Duval joint venture identified porphyry copper-molybdenum potential during regional 

reconnaissance along the Alaskan Peninsula. Although Pan American Petroleum was active in 

the region during the 1960s, there is no evidence they conducted exploration at Pyramid other 

than possible claim staking. There is no evidence of historic mining or prospecting in the Pyramid 

area, which is relatively uncommon for a broadly mineralized and partly exposed porphyry 

system. 

5.2 1970 - 1976 

The Aleut-Quintana-Duval Joint-Venture group initiated surface mapping and geochemical 

sampling in 1974 which ultimately defined a large area of porphyry-style alteration and copper-

molybdenum mineralization sufficient to warrant a 1975 drill program. Geology, alteration, and 

sample location maps from 1974 were geo-referenced and digitized ((Source: SRK, 2013) 

Figure 5.1: Quintana-Duval Geology, Alteration and Drill Hole Location). The 1974 exploration 

was sufficient to identify several targets based upon detailed geological and alteration mapping in 

addition to geochemical results from 63 soil, 18 rock, and 11 silt/stream sediment samples 

((Source: SRK, 2013) 

Figure 5.2: Historical Surface Sampling ). All of the samples were analyzed for copper, 

molybdenum, zinc, gold, and silver. 

Aleut-Quintana-Duval commenced drilling in September 1975. Operations were conducted from a 

Peninsula based camp and an access road was constructed by bull dozer from the head of 

Balboa Bay (Albatross Anchorage) to the Pyramid Project, a road distance of 6.8 km. Upon 

commencement of drilling, two rigs completed 19 core holes for a total of 1692 m (Figure 5.1). 

One drill rig consisted of a skid mounted Longyear 38 which drilled 1163 m of NQ core over 13 

holes. The second, a screw-feed Boyles rig, was a smaller machine that drilled 6 AQ holes for a 

total of 529 m and was transported in part by helicopter or skid.  

The 1975 drilling confirmed the presence of a broad area of copper and molybdenum 

mineralization to a maximum depth of 168.6 m where NQ holes averaged 89.3 m and AQ holes

Pyramid Copper-Molybdenum Project Technical Report Page 17 

 

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

averaged 88.1 m, the deepest of which was 135.6 m. The distribution of holes and broad Cu-Mo 

mineralization allowed Aleut-Quintana-Duval to produce a resource calculation which is stated in 

the 1975 Pyramid Project report by J. S. Christie (Christie, J. S., 1975). The report stated a 

resource of 126,330,000 tons containing 0.403% Cu and 0.025% Mo with a 0.25% cut-off grade. 

This resource was based upon drill hole geochemistry and calculation of 17 polygonal blocks to 

produce tonnage. The estimated resource is shallow at less than 100 m and was indicated to 

have potential to grow at depth. An additional 48,800,000 of potential tonnage was also 

calculated based upon a favorable undrilled area, though no grade was predicted. These results 

are historic in nature from work completed prior to 2001 and NI 43-101 standards and should not 

be relied upon. They are only stated here for historical completeness. The 1975 program was 

followed-up in 1976 with a one-hole program, placed on a prior site which had poor recovery in 

the chalcocite enrichment zone. However, the results did not indicate higher grades and the 

entire program was abandoned.

5.3 1979 - 1991 

Gold exploration was active throughout the region between 1979 and 1991 by various companies 

including Resource Associates of Alaska ("RAA"), Battle Mountain Gold, Bear Creek, Teck, and 

Cominco (Van Wyck, et al, 2005). Exploration consisted of broad reconnaissance –style rock, 

stream and soil sampling programs and some drilling, though no significant deposits were 

identified. It should be noted that only minor rock and stream sediment sampling was performed 

at Pyramid during this time, and the exploration was gold oriented, thus most samples were 

typically analyzed for gold, silver, mercury, and arsenic. Historic databases contain sparse metal 

or trace element geochemistry. 

5.4 2003 - 2006 

Alaska Earth Resources, Inc. ("AERI") successfully negotiated a mineral exploration lease with 

two Peninsula native corporations in 2003: BBNC (Bristol Bay Native Corporation) and The Aleut 

Corporation. The Pyramid Project sits entirely within TAC mineral lands and a combination of 

surface lands dominated by the Shumagin Corporation and to a lesser degree by the St Paul 

Tanadgusix Corporation. Full Metal Minerals examined the property in 2004 and subsequently 

optioned the lease from AERI. 

FMM and Metallica Resources (Metallica), following completion of a joint venture, commenced 

mineral exploration in 2005 along the Alaskan Peninsula using Sand Point as a base of 

operations. The exploration team focused on the Pyramid porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit 

in addition to Centennial and Apollo-Shumagin gold deposits. The 2005 program consisted of 

reconnaissance-style mapping, surface sampling, ground geophysics, and examination of the 

Apollo-Shumagin epithermal gold vein systems. The work at Pyramid included completion of five 

induced polarization lines and several miles of ground magnetics along with opportunistic rock 

chip sampling and outcrop lithologic-alteration mapping. A reported 177 rock chip, 14 silts/stream 

sediment, and 1 soil samples were collected during the 2005 season (Figure 5.2). The samples 

were analyzed at BSI inspectorate through Alaska Assay Laboratories for fire assay gold and 31 

elements by aqua regia ICP. Recommendations for additional work at Pyramid were made for the 

2006 season, including drilling four holes totaling 914 m.

Figure 5.2: Historical Surface Sampling  

 

A remote sensing study was undertaken in late 2005 over the Pyramid area and surrounding 

areas (Figure 5.3).  The study examined several band widths from land satellite imagery, and 

through filtering, identified the following minerals: sericite, kaolinite pyrophyllite, illite, jarosite, and 

alunite. Most of these minerals are associated with porphyry copper systems and are present in 

or peripheral to Pyramid. The work was contracted to and conducted by Ming-Ho Du Image2Map 

Services Inc. 

During 2006, exploration by FMM and Metallica focused upon a rock channel sampling program 

on continuous exposures in one of the principal creeks transecting the Pyramid porphyry system. 

This program was recommended by consultant John Proffett who conducted a one-day visit to 

the property and suggested a line of continuous channel sampling along a well exposed creek 

segment might represent a horizontal drill hole. The crew collected 113 rock chip samples and 

only analyzed for gold, copper, and molybdenum. 

No drilling was completed on the property since a surface exploration agreement was not 

completed with the Village Corporations. However, a review of the historic drill core was

undertaken at the Alaska Materials Archive Center in Eagle River, AK. This review was 

conducted by Joanna Lispke and Joel Rotert and compiled into a separate report. Based upon 

the positive core review report and surface sampling, a drill program was recommended for the 

following season. 

There was no additional exploration conducted on the Pyramid property until the FFM exploration 

program in 2010.

5.5 2010 - 2012  

5.5.1 2010 

A program of work on the Pyramid Project commenced in early August, 2010 and was completed 

by mid-September, 2010. The program encompassed geologic mapping, collection of 150 rock 

chip samples, and diamond core drilling of 5 holes for a total of 1668 m with depths ranging from 

201 m to 500 m. The 2010 exploration program included the collection of surface samples, 

particularly in areas with deficient sample coverage. Six of the 150 samples were taken at the 

San Diego Bay alteration target, 8 km to the east.

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

The 2010 surface sampling and mapping program identified previously un-recognized exposures 

containing strong porphyry style alteration and mineralization, and defined a 4 km x 3 km NE-SW 

oriented zone of strong porphyry style alteration and mineralization.  

Copper, molybdenum, and gold geochemistry from the five core holes indicated economic 

mineralization with the potential to expand dimensions of known mineralization. The most 

significant drill hole, PY10-005 was oriented northward on the north side of the known system and 

encountered 0.63% Cu, 0.018% Mo, and 0.141 g/t Au from surface to a depth of 201 m. Other 

highlights from the 2010 drilling included 156 m of 0.402% Cu, 0.039% Mo, and 0.108 g/t Au in 

drill hole PY10-004 and 468 m of 0.32% Cu, 0.018% Mo, and 0.067 g/t Au in drill hole PY10-001. 

Higher grades were detected over intervals of 40 to 70 m in all 5 drill holes, and drill hole PY10-

005 recorded multiple 2 m intercepts with over 1% Cu. Despite core recovery problems reported 

by Quintana-Duval in 1975, the core recovery during this campaign was excellent. 

5.5.2 2011 

The 2011 field program began June 1st and lasted until August 1st of that year. The program 

consisted of rock chip and grab sampling (Figure 5.4), detailed geologic mapping, vein density 

mapping, diamond core drilling of 12 holes totaling 2,576 m with depths ranging between 105 m 

to 327 m, and a magnetic survey at Pyramid as well as minor prospecting and geologic sampling 

at San Diego Bay. A ground magnetic survey was contracted to Aurora Geoscience LTD out of 

Whitehorse, Yukon Canada. A one-man crew conducted the survey and collected a total of 26.6 

line kilometers with 3 km of N-S tie lines, 100 km E-W line spacing and 10 m station spacing. The 

survey was oriented east-west over the heart of the porphyry system. Also during late 2011, a 

high quality 5 m resolution IKONOS Geo Eye image capture over the immediate Pyramid target 

and surrounding area was commissioned through ETerra.

During 2011, 12 NQ sized diamond core holes totaling in 2,576 m with depths ranging between 

105 m to 327 m were drilled. Copper, molybdenum, and gold geochemistry from the 12 drill holes 

showed potential for the expansion of the known mineralization. Although some drill holes failed 

to intercept significant Cu-Au-Mo mineralization, eight were successful. Of those eight, 11PY010 

was the most impressive with 310 m of 0.39% Cu, 0.009% Mo, and 0.102 g/t Au. Drill hole 

11PY016 returned 156 m of 0.71% Cu, 0.018% Mo, and 0.179 g/t Au. 

5.5.3 2012 

The 2012 exploration campaign consisted of an extension of the 2011 ground magnetic survey 

and minor geologic mapping. Most of the focus for the season was on a drill program which 

resulted in 3,241 m of drilling over a total of 13 holes. The most substantial part of the program, 

outside of drilling, was a four-day ground magnetic survey performed by two Alaska Earth 

Sciences geologists in mid-August (Figure 5.5).

Thirteen diamond core holes with a total drilled depth of 3241 m were completed during the 2012 

program (Figure 5.6). Nine of the thirteen drill holes had anomalous to significant copper, gold, 

and molybdenum intercepts. Three drill holes had greater that 0.2% Cu over approximately 100 

m. The longest continuously anomalous intercept was in drill hole 12PY018 which had 344 m at 

0.110% Cu, 0.036% Mo and 0.035 g/t Au.

5.6 Metallurgical Testing 

In 2012, Antofagasta collected a small suite of pulps from the 2011 and 2012 drilling programs 

and had them tested at an ALS-Minerals laboratory in Chile. Samples were selected based upon 

high estimated chalcocite content and tested for leaching potential. Samples were collected from 

eight drill holes and tested for one and three-hour leach cycles. Results indicated that about 22% 

of the copper present in the samples was amenable to acid leaching. Individual test results 

ranged a low of 6% to a high of 32%. The limited testing seems to indicate that leaching of copper 

would not be an efficient process for the Pyramid Project. 

 

5.7 Historical Mineral Resources 

The drilling by FFM in 2010 to 2012 resulted in a mineral resource estimate being prepared by 

SRK and reported in a technical report dated June 21, 2013 (SRK, 2013). The mineral resource 

was estimated using Gemcom's GemsTM (Gems) 3D block modeling software in multiple passes 

in 25 by 25 by 10 m blocks by ordinary kriging. Grade estimates were based on capped 2 m 

composited assay data. Capping levels were set at 1.3% Cu for the supergene and 0.83% Cu for 



SRK Consulting

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

the hypogene zone. Mo was capped at 0.1% and 0.08% for the supergene and hypogene zones 

respectively. Gold grades were capped at 4.2 g/t for the supergene and 0.215 g/t for the 

hypogene zone. Mineral resources were classified in accordance with definitions provided by the 

Canadian Institute of Mining (CIM) as stipulated in NI43-101. All interpolated blocks were 

classified as Inferred Mineral Resource. The mineral resource was reported within the confines of 

a Whittle optimized pit shell and estimated to contain 173 million tons grading 0.35% copper, 

0.08% molybdenum and 0.08 g/t gold. The historical mineral resource is reliable and represents a 

reasonable indication of the mineralization at Pyramid before the current drilling by CopperBank. 

The historical mineral resource is no longer considered to be relevant in that it is being 

superseded by the estimated presented in Section 13 of this report. 

CopperBank is not treating the historical mineral resources as current mineral resources or 

mineral reserves and SRK has not done the work necessary to classify the historical estimate as 

current mineral resource or mineral reserves.

 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

6.1 Regional Geology 

The Pyramid Project is located in the 'Ring of Fire', a portion of the arc which contains a number 

of other porphyry copper epithermal gold deposits in addition to hundreds of metal occurrences. 

The project area is located in a volcanic arc setting, approximately 20 km from the Pacific-North 

America convergent plate boundary. The volcanic arc is derived from semi-continuous tectonic 

activity and oceanic crust subduction since the Mesozoic and currently represented by a chain of 

nearly 80 volcanoes throughout the Aleutian island chain and Alaskan Peninsula.  

The Alaska Peninsula is comprised of arc-related volcanic and plutonic rocks intermixed with 

marine and minor continental sedimentary rocks that date to the late Paleozoic (Figure6.1). 

Exposed Peninsula basement lithologies have both accretion and continental origins, derived 

from a long complex tectonic history. Regional mapping has labeled lithologic boundaries by 

structural components such as thrust faults, normal faults, strike-slip faults, intrusive contacts, 

and unconformities. Thrust and strike-slip faults are principally derived from compressional and 

transpressional tectonism, some as deeply rooted long lived structures. This is typical of 

structural preparation in conjunction with arc-related subduction and is partly responsible for the 

genesis of the Pyramid porphyry center. 

The sedimentary rocks throughout the range of the Alaskan Peninsula are dated from the upper 

Triassic through the Pliocene with a good percentage represented by the Jurassic through 

Tertiary. Collectively, the entire sedimentary stratigraphic column consists of roughly 800 m of 

upper Triassic, 6,424 m of Jurassic, 5,825 m from the Cretaceous, and 8,131 m contained within 

the Tertiary for an aggregate total of about 21,180 m (Detterman, et al, 1966). The most dominant 

rock types are siltstone, sandstone, shale, and conglomerate, with lesser amounts of tuffs and 

lavas, limestone, mudstone, and non-marine coal. Tuffs and lava material are found prominently 

within much of the Tertiary formations whereas the limestone and non-marine coal is confined to 

the Cretaceous and older.  

Examination of Port Moller 1:250.00 quadrangle reveals fewer overall exposed sedimentary 

formations with the following being most dominant with measured thickness: 

Tertiary 

• Stepovak Formation (2030 m) 

• Tolstoi Formation (660 m) 

Cretaceous 

• Chignik Formation (490 m) 

• Hoodoo Formation (630 m) 

• Shumagin Formation (3000 m) 

  



SRK Consulting 
Pyramid Copper-Molybdenum Project Technical Report Page 27 

 

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

Jurassic 

• Northeast Creek Member (Naknek Fm), (614 m) 

• Snug Harbour Siltstone Member (Naknek Fm), (625 m) 

• Indecision Creek Sandstone (Naknek Fm), (870 m) 

The Jurassic, likely by virtue of a longer history, is more deformed and becomes better exposed 

on the northern side of the Peninsula. Should a continuous sequence be exposed of the above 

sedimentary rocks, there would be roughly 8,920 m of sediments present within the Port 

Moller/general Pyramid area. 

 

(Source: Wilson et al, 1999) 

Figure 6.1:  Regional Geology Setting. 

 



SRK Consulting 
Pyramid Copper-Molybdenum Project Technical Report Page 28 

 

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

The entire sedimentary package is not exposed, but in general, has a northeast-southwest strike 

and southeast dip that varies from shallow to steep. The further northeast on the Peninsula, the 

more deformed and rotated the sedimentary package tends to be.  

Relative timing and interpretation indicates the Alaska Peninsula terrain was accreted in the early 

Tertiary exposing Upper Cretaceous variably marine sedimentary rocks of the Chignik, 

Shumagin, and Hoodoo Formations. Early Tertiary sedimentary rocks are also within the accreted 

terrain and were subducted beneath the peninsular terrain. The Border Range Fault is interpreted 

to occur between the inner and outer Shumagin Islands where the Shumagin Formation and Late 

Cretaceous Plutons of 58-63 Ma are best exposed. Following terrain accretion, southern Alaska 

rotated counter-clockwise between 30-50 degrees to its current location by no later than 43 Ma. 

At this time, the direction of the accretion shifted to a northwest vengeance of the currently active 

Aleutian (subduction) Trench. 

6.1.3 Economic Geology 

Regional metal endowment and mineralization is consistent with other porphyry copper districts 

worldwide. There are several different mineralizing events within the region, all of which are 

related to arc-subduction volcanism. The oldest event is the farthest south and includes 

epithermal and porphyry style mineralization on Unga and Popof islands, 47 km (30 miles) to the 

south-southwest. Although this event is older than the event responsible for Pyramid 

mineralization, it is less eroded and present surface distribution may suggest that only the upper 

tiers of the greater porphyry system are exposed.  

The Pyramid Project itself is, within the current volcanic arc, a contemporaneous intrusive rock 

that has been dated to 6 million years by K-Ar isotope dating (Armstrong et al, 1976). Also 

associated with this activity are Pavlof and Veniaminof; two active volcanoes within the arc. The 

arc becomes progressively older to the east with the Bee Creek porphyry system being roughly 

20 Ma. While the current arc is more deeply eroded, several epithermal centers have been 

identified, most notably the San Diego bay epithermal center and hot springs located along the 

northern coast of the Alaskan Peninsula only a few kilometres from the Pyramid Project. 

6.2 Property Geology 

6.2.1 Sedimentary Rocks 

The sedimentary rocks at Pyramid consist of a thick succession of clastic rocks of largely siltstone 

character. The siltstone commonly occurs as a fine-grained rock with no preserved internal 

structure such as bedding. Locally, feldspatic siltstone with small (<1 mm) plagioclase grains or 

slightly coarse sandstone texture occurs. They are thought to belong to the Late Cretaceous-age 

Hoodoo Formation and the Late Paleocene to Middle Eocene Tolstoi Formation. The Hoodoo is a 

lower continental slope submarine shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone, becoming coarser 

(sandy) stratigraphically upwards.  

Siltstone within the Pyramid area is intensely affected by pervasive K-silicate alteration of biotite 

giving the pale brown to creamy appearance to the rock. This is variably overprinted by green to 



SRK Consulting 
Pyramid Copper-Molybdenum Project Technical Report Page 29 

 

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

grey sericite alteration in the core of the mineralized area. It characteristically has higher hairline 

vein density relative to the adjacent intrusive porphyry unit reflecting a pre-mineralization fracture 

system and competency difference. Least altered siltstone occurs as a dark grey rock outside the 

K-silicate zone. Therefore, appearance of zones of dark grey siltstone in drill holes marks the 

outer limit of the intense K-silicate alteration zone. 

6.2.2 Intrusive Rocks 

The Pyramid Cu-Mo mineralization is centred on several late Miocene porphyry intrusions, likely 

quartz dioritic composition, which are hosted by a sequence of Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary 

clastic sedimentary rocks (Figure 6.2). The intrusive bodies are small (<200 m) stocks or dikes 

and are exposed in an area of at least 2.5 × 1.5 km largely within an east-west trending glacial 

valley. Available drill hole data suggest that most of these intrusive units occur as sub-vertical 

bodies but existence of smaller sills cannot be ruled out. They have similar mineralogy of 

plagioclase, biotite and amphibole with variable occurrence and abundance of quartz 

phenocrysts. Texture of the rocks varies from small to coarse grained porphyritic to coarse 

equigranular texture. The intrusive rocks found on the property have been divided into several 

types on the basis of texture, mineralogical composition and timing of emplacement. 

Feldspar porphyry ("FP") is a main intrusive rock at Pyramid emplaced into the host sedimentary 

rocks commonly as vertical bodies less than 150 m wide. It is characterized by approximately 

35% small (2-3 mm) plagioclase phenocrysts in a fine-grained mafic groundmass of dominantly 

plagioclase, biotite and hornblende. Locally, small (<2 mm) triangular shape quartz occur. 

Hornblende is rarely preserved but abundant biotite occurs in groundmass in areas with least 

sericite alteration. Quartz diorite porphyry ("QDP") is texturally and mineralogically similar to the 

feldspar porphyry, having approximately 35% plagioclase phenocrysts. However, 

characteristically, it has approximately 5% small (ca. 3 mm) hexagonal to rounded quartz 

phenocrysts. 

The equigranular diorite ("ED") forms a large central intrusive body at Pyramid with surface 

exposure of at least 600 m × 400 m. Drill core data suggest that it probably expands at depth and 

extends especially towards west. It is characterized by approximately 60% plagioclase (3-4 mm), 

30% biotite (1-6 mm) and amphibole, 2% magnetite and less than 10% groundmass of largely 

plagioclase. The biotite is usually recrystallized, and hornblende is rare. It has been affected by 

K-silicate alteration characterized by quartz + K-feldspar + magnetite. It locally contains veins with 

green sericite alteration halos with minor chalcopyrite and trace pyrite (cp>>py). They cut and are 

cut by early green sericite veinlets suggesting development of early veins within ED. However, 

typical Pyramid mineralization associated with quartz-grey sericite veins do not occur. Late pyrite 

veins are not common. 

Crowded feldspar porphyry ("CFP") is a distinct porphyry unit at Pyramid characterized by 

abundant coarse phenocrysts of zoned plagioclase (2-8 mm, 45%), biotite (2-5 mm, 15%), 

hornblende (3-4 mm, 10%), and magnetite (1-2 mm, 3%) in a fine-grained grey feldspar-rich 

groundmass. CFP cuts FP and QDP with sharp contacts and rarely has clasts of QDP. CFP is 

only weakly mineralized and commonly barren when altered with green sericite.

Pyramid Copper-Molybdenum Project Technical Report Page 30 

 

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

The plagioclase biotite dike ("PBD") is a late mafic dike with thickness from a few cm to over 20 

m. It cuts all previous rock units especially near the contacts between older rocks and occurs as 

dikes trending approximately east-west. PBD is characterized by variable amounts of plagioclase 

(20 to 40%) and locally biotite phenocrysts in a biotite-rich groundmass with magnetite (1-3%). 

Locally, PBD contains disseminated chalcopyrite with minor pyrrhotite similar to minette dikes. 

PBD, however, is commonly barren, cuts all vein types and is locally cut by trace hairline pyrite 

veins.

Figure 6.2:  Local Geology Setting. 

 

6.3 Mineralization and Alteration 

The alteration suites can be described as multiphase and in approximate paragenetic order 

consisting of early potassic assemblages (biotite-magnetite+/-kspar), early dark micaceous 

("EDM") veining, A and B quartz-kspar-sulphide veining, minor D-veining as pyrite-carbonate-

quartz-sericite, copper sulphide enrichment, anhydrite veining and oxidation (Figure 6.3). The 

complete timing of phyllic alteration (quartz, sericite, pyrite) has not been fully established but 

likely overlaps the potassic alteration phase and is identified with aspects of EDM, A, B, and D 

veining. Indications of argillic alteration are also present with an abundance of clay altered 

feldspars, particularly in holes drilled on the south side of the valley. Not all alteration types were 

identified in each hole, but various combinations were observed and contribute to a slightly 

complex multiphase system.

The early potassic is dominantly potassium-rich secondary biotite with variable disseminated to 

veinlet fine-grained magnetite. The biotite is fine-grained, often root beer brown, shreddy, 

preferentially replaces pre-existing hornblende and often biotite. The magnetite is typically fine-

grained disseminated and/or in hairline veinlets with biotite. A slightly possibly later phase of 

potassic alteration consists of potassium feldspar with quartz and sulphides in veining as A-type 

veins. This type of veining is common in the drilling and locally very abundant on the surface.  

The early dark micaceous (EDM) veins and veinlets are abundant, particularly in hornfelsed 

sedimentary rocks. The veins are composed of quartz, sericite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, minor 

chlorite, and sparse K-spar. They are 1-3 mm wide, but can be up to 1 cm and have diffuse halos 

with no distinct wall boundary. These veins are thought to be genetically early as they are 

observed cross-cut by A, B, and D veins. Another hypothesis indicates EDM veins originally 

contained biotite and K-spar, but no sericite or chlorite which would be later alteration 

components replacing biotite and most of the K-spar. 

All drill holes were found to contain A-veins, variably composed of quartz, K-spar, sericite, and 

sulphide minerals (chalcopyrite, pyrite, and molybdenite) with minor anhydrite and carbonate. The 

veins range from a few millimeters to a couple of centimeters wide, have distinct wall boundaries,

center-lines which are frequently filled with sulphide minerals. The veins can occur as cross-

cutting stockwork and observed in hornfels, quartz diorite porphyry, diorite porphyry, and feldspar 

porphyry. Coeval and slightly later B-veins are apparent by their lack of alteration halo and are 

dominantly composed of quartz with minor sericite and deep purple anhydrite and have sharp 

continuous transects of the core. Molybdenite and chalcopyrite are the most frequent sulphide 

minerals associated with B-veins, commonly along the wall rock-vein boundary. They are not as 

abundant as EDM or A veins but are found in all holes. The EDM, A, and B veins probably 

occurred during the transition between late potassic to early-middle phyllic alteration.  

Perhaps the latest veining event, D-veins, tend to cross cut all other vein types mentioned above. 

They can contain a variety of minerals, though nearly always contain pyrite with at least minor to 

moderate amounts of sericite, quartz, calcite/siderite, clay, and sparse molybdenite. D-veins are 

interpreted to arrive late, during the waning phyllic alteration phase, though are not considered a 

major part of the system in the holes drilled.

 Deposit Types 

A porphyry copper-molybdenum-gold deposit is sought at the Pyramid Project. The project is 

regionally located within the 'Ring of Fire', a geographic moniker for an area of tectonic and 

volcanically active terrains encircling the Pacific Basin. There are hundreds of known porphyry 

style deposits located within this feature, which includes countries such as the United States, 

Canada, Russia, Japan, Indonesia, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, and Mexico. The 'Ring of Fire' 

hosts an enormous amount of copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver from porphyry style deposits 

which are typically large low grade, bulk tonnage and generally open pit for economically effective 

extractions. 

Porphyry deposits are large, low-medium grade deposits; their primary (hypogene) mineralization 

is dominantly structurally controlled and is genetically and spatially related to felsic or 

intermediate intrusions. Along with hypogene mineralization, copper rich porphyry deposits have 

the potential for secondary (supergene) mineralization. Supergene mineralization occurs when 

copper bearing sulfide minerals (i.e. chalcopyrite) are weathered or dissolved by downward to 

laterally migrating acidic groundwater, then re-precipitated in a deeper reduced setting; the end 

result can be the precipitation and deposition of higher grade copper minerals, enhancing the 

economic potential. Secondary supergene mineralization does occur at Pyramid. 

Porphyry deposits come in varying styles, grades, and depths of exposure and as a result have a 

broad spectrum of deposit types. Typical copper porphyry deposit grades range from 0.2 to 1.5% 

copper, 0.01 to 0.05% Mo, 0.05 to 0.5 g/t Au, and 0.5 to 5.0 g/t Ag. Due to the various 

compositions of porphyry deposits, they often have varying metal values. There are deposits that 

are copper and gold rich, molybdenum and silver poor or copper and molybdenum rich, and gold 

and silver poor. Some deposits can also have smaller quantities of other precious metals that fall 

into the platinum group metals (platinum, palladium, rhenium, indium and rhodium) as well as 

selenium. These rarer metals and elements are often extracted during the smelting process.

 Exploration 

CopperBank acquired the Pyramid Project in 2014 as part of a plan of arrangement. The 

Company began exploring the Project area in 2017. The initial exploration program consisted of 

data compilation of all historical information followed by mobilization of a drill camp at Balboa 

Bay. Other than selected exploration mapping traverses to pinpoint outcrops and past drill holes, 

the exploration program consisted mainly of a drilling program described in Section 9 of this 

report.

 Drilling 

9.1 Historical Drilling 
Drilling conducted by the Aleut-Quintana-Duval JV in 1975 consisted of two rigs which completed 

19 core holes for a total of 1692 m (Table 9.1 and Figure 9.1). One drill rig consisted of a skid 

mounted Longyear 38 which drilled 1,163 m of NQ core over 13 holes. The second, a screw-feed 

Boyles rig, was a smaller machine that drilled 6 AQ holes for a total of 529 m and was transported 

in part by helicopter or skid. Overall core recovery was poor; especially in strongly altered 

chalcocite enriched rocks. It is hypothesized that overall grades may be higher than indicated due 

to loss of chalcocite in these sections.  

Drilling confirmed the presence of a broad area of copper and molybdenum mineralization to a 

maximum depth of 169 m where NQ holes averaged 89 m and AQ holes averaged 88 m; the 

deepest of which was 136 m (Table 9.1).

9.2 2010 FMM Drilling 

A surface exploration agreement with the village corporations was finalized in 2010, and FMM 

subsequently entered into a joint-venture with Antofagasta Minerals PLC (Antofagasta), 

principally focused on the Pyramid area. Work on the program commenced in early August, 2010 

and was completed by middle September, 2010. The program encompassed geologic mapping, 

collection of 150 rock chip samples, and HQ sized diamond core drilling of 5 holes for a total of 

1,668 m with depths ranging from 201 m to 500 m (Table 9.2) and (Figure 9.1).

Copper, molybdenum, and gold geochemistry from the five core holes indicated economic 

mineralization with the potential to expand dimensions of known mineralization. The most 

significant drill hole, PY10-005 was oriented northward on the north side of the known system and 

encountered 0.63 % Cu, 0.018 % Mo, and 0.141 g/t Au from surface to a depth of 201 m. Other 

highlights from the 2010 drilling included 156 m of 0.402 % Cu, 0.039 % Mo, and 0.108 g/t Au in 

drill hole PY10-004 and 468 m of 0.32 % Cu, 0.018 % Mo, and 0.067 g/t Au in drill hole PY10-

001. Higher grades were detected over intervals of 40 to 70 m in all 5 drill holes, and drill hole 

PY10-005 recorded multiple 2 m intercepts with over 1% Cu. Despite core recovery problems 

reported by Quintana-Duval in 1975, the core recovery during this campaign was excellent and 

there are no issues that could impact the mineral resource estimate.  

9.3 2011 FMM Drilling 

During 2011, 12 NQ sized diamond core holes totaling in 2,576 m with depths ranging between 

105 m to 327 m were drilled  (Table 9.3 and Figure 9.1). Copper, molybdenum, and gold 

geochemistry from the 12 drill holes showed potential for the expansion of the known 

mineralization. Although some drill holes failed to intercept significant Cu-Au-Mo mineralization, 

eight were successful. Of those eight, 11PY010 was the most impressive with 310 m of 0.39 % 

Cu, 0.009 % Mo, and 0.102 g/t Au. Drill hole 11PY016 returned 156 m of 0.71 % Cu, 0.018 % Mo, 

and 0.179 g/t Au.

9.4 2012 FMM Drilling 

During the third year of exploration, the joint venture between Antofagasta-Full Metal continued, 

although a third-party consulting/logistics group Alaska Earth Sciences was used for general 

project management. A helicopter supported drill rig was used throughout the entire project 

supplied by Peak Exploration Drilling Co. All of the diamond core drilling was NQ in dimension, 

drill hole orientation was either north or south and always at an angle.  

Thirteen diamond core holes with a total drilled depth of 3,241 m were completed during the 2012 

program (Table 9.4 and Figure 9.1). There were very few weather days and the drill remained in 

good repair. Nine of the thirteen drill holes (12PY018, 019, 021, 022, 023, 027, 028, 029, and 

030) all had anomalous to significant copper, gold, and molybdenum intercepts. There were three 

drill holes with ≥ 0.2% Cu over approximately 100 m. The longest continuously anomalous 

intercept was in drill hole 12PY018 which had 344 m at 0.110 % Cu, 0.036 % Mo and 0.035 g/t 

Au.

9.5 General Comments on Historical Drilling Programs 

The procedures followed for the historical drill program were in keeping with industry standards at 

the time that the drill programs were implemented. Core recoveries were generally poor for the 

1975 drill program, but recoveries were very good for all successive programs. The impact of the 

poor recovery for the 1975 program is minimal as most holes were short and most holes have 

been essentially duplicated with the 2010 – 2012 drill programs.  

All historical drill holes were drilled vertical or steeply to the north or south. The mineralization at 

Pyramid is a broad zone of disseminated mineralization associated with porphyry copper deposits 

as described in Section 7. The historical drilling was designed to try and determine the vertical as 

well as horizontal dimensions of the mineralization. As such vertical holes were drilled parallel to 

the mineralization whereas the inclined holes were drilled to target the outside contacts of the 

mineralization. Drill hole intercepts reflect the width of the mineralization where encountered, true 

widths are difficult to estimate and not generally known as some holes are completely within the 

mineralized domains.  Table 9.5 summarizes the best intersections of the historical drill programs 

and Figure 9.2 shows a typical cross-section of the mineralized domains with the historical drill 

holes.

9.6 2017 CopperBank Drilling 

In July of 2017, CopperBank mobilized two diamond drill rigs at the Pyramid Project with focus to 

better define and expand on the know copper-molybdenum mineralization. Helicopter supported 

drill rigs were used throughout the entire project. Helicopter support was provided by Guardian 

Helicopters and drill rigs were supplied by Yukuskodon Professional Services of Palmer Alaska 

who also supplied geological services for core logging. All of the diamond core drilling was NQ in 

dimension, drill hole orientation was either north or south and always at an angle. 

Fourteen diamond core holes with a total drilled depth of 3,660 m were completed during the 

2017 program (Table 9.6 and Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4).

9.7 Drilling Pattern and Density 

The combined drilling on the Pyramid Project produced an average drill spacing of 30 to 60 m for 

most of the main deposit area. The central part of the property where the equigranular diorite is 

exposed is not well drilled and as a result currently excluded from the mineral resource 

estimation.

9.8 SRK Comments 
SRK is of the opinion that the current drill pattern for the Pyramid Project is sufficient for the 

estimation of mineral resource for a porphyry-styled deposit. SRK is also of the opinion that the 

drill data is adequate for the estimation of mineral resources.

 Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security 

10.1 Sample Preparation and Analyses 

10.2 Historical Sample Preparation and Analyses 

Samples for analysis were obtained by splitting the core with a core splitter, crushing to a -4 mesh 

size and then reducing the volume by 50-75% using a Jones Riffle. These yielded samples 

consisting of 2-3 lbs depending on core size and recovery. Copper and molybdenum assays were 

run on all samples and check assays from two additional laboratories were made with the original 

pulps. 50-75 ft composite samples were also run for gold and silver and select representative 

samples run with 30 element spectrographic analysis.  

SRK is unaware of the laboratory used for the 1975 drilling or of the sampling procedures. The 

1975 drilling has very limited impact on the mineral resource as the drilling is limited in extent.   

10.3 2010 to 2012 Sample Preparation and Analyses 

Sampling during the 2012 project was a continuation of the methods used in the 2010 and 2011 

seasons which had been laid out by FMM Geologists and approved by Antofagasta. This involved 

an unbiased sampling interval of two meters through the entire length of the drill holes starting at 

bedrock. Core was sawn in half using two 14-inch diamond bladed rotary saws on site and placed 

in sealed polyethylene bags. Within the catch basin below the blade, a chafing dish was placed, 

which was able to collect the fines from cutting. The fine material was allowed to settle, after 

which the water was poured off. The fine material was halved, one part was put into the core box 

and the other with the samples bound for the laboratory. The chafing dish was emptied upon 

completion of each sample. This procedure was initiated early in the 2012 program when 

chalcocite mineralization was present in the core and wet saw cutting showed minor evidence of 

'washing' of this secondary copper mineralization. 

Upon completion of each drill hole, sample bags were compiled into rice sacks and transported to 

a locked facility rented by FMM in Sand Point, Alaska. Each rice sack was labeled with a bag 

number and sample string contents. After completion of up to three drill holes, the rice sacks were 

then loaded onto charter aircraft and transported to Anchorage, where the samples were 

couriered by Alaska Earth Sciences personnel to the ALS Preparation Facility in Anchorage, AK. 

Samples were kept under lock and key or under direct supervision by AES employees during the 

entire process of shipment to the prep facility. Drill holes were generally submitted as their own 

work order; exceptions were made to accommodate deeper holes. 

The Anchorage, AK preparation laboratory crushed and pulverized every sample then produced a 

balanced 200 g split called a pulp which was placed into a small envelope.  

The Pulps were then sent to the ALS-Chemex Vancouver laboratory, or in some cases, their 

Reno, Nevada laboratory where each sample was analyzed. Two methods were chosen for each 

sample: a 30-g fire assay ICP-AES method for gold analysis and a 4-acid near total digestion 

ICP-AES procedure that produces quantitative results for 33 elements. The lower detection limit 



SRK Consulting 
Pyramid Copper-Molybdenum Project Technical Report Page 46 

 

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

for gold is 0.005 parts per million (ppm), 1 ppm for copper, and 1 ppm for molybdenum. A pre-

determined over limit for copper and molybdenum was prescribed to the laboratory by both FMM 

and Antofagasta. Thus, when copper exceeded 2,500 ppm and/or molybdenum exceeded 200 

ppm, the sample was automatically analyzed by the method AA-OG62, which consists of the 

same method just with a higher detection limit of 0.001 to 40 %. Once the laboratory had 

completed analyzing all of the samples in the batch, they reviewed the data for any potential 

quality control problems and upon passing their QAQC restrictions, results were posted on their 

secure website. Upon which time, pre-designated members of FMM were allowed to access and 

download the data. The time frame for preparation and analysis was typically 15 to 25 days, but 

sometimes longer during the busiest times of the year. 

10.4 2017 Sample Preparation and Analyses 

The 2017 core sampling program followed procedures that were very similar to the procedures 

established by FMM. Samples were collected in an unbiased sampling interval of two meters 

through the entire length of the drill holes starting at bedrock. Core was sawn in half using two 14-

inch diamond bladed rotary saws on site and placed in sealed polyethylene bags. Upon 

completion of each drill hole, sample bags were compiled into rice sacks and transported to Sand 

Point for shipping by air to ALS Fairbanks for analysis. 

At ALS Fairbanks, samples were pulverized and pulps were sent to ALS Minerals Laboratories in 

Reno, NV for analysis. All pulps were analyzed by a 4 acid multielement analysis for 61 elements 

by ICP-AES method and assayed for Au by standard atomic absorption spectrometry (Au-AA23) 

following the fusion by fire-assay of a 30-gram sample. Samples returning copper values higher 

than 10000 ppm were re-analyzed by ICP-AES following a four-acid digestion and those 

exceeding 1 g/t gold by gravimetric finish (Au-GRA21). Standards and blanks were inserted at a 

rate of one for every 20 samples.   

ALS is a world recognized assay laboratory company. Its facilities in Vancouver and Reno 

Nevada are ISO 17025 certified. 

10.5 Bulk Density Data 

Bulk density ("BD") on select samples from the pyramid project was collected in 2010 and 2011 

but not in 2012. In 2010, 21 samples were sent to ALS Laboratory for analysis. These samples 

were weighed in both air and water with the data reported as a ratio between the density of the 

sample and the density of the water. In 2011, 40 samples representing various lithologies were 

tested on-site by geologists from Antofagasta Minerals using methods similar to 2010. 

10.6 2010 – 2012 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs 

All drill holes, including the historical holes were initially located using a handheld Garmin GPS 

with an accuracy of ± 3 m. In 2012, a differential GPS survey was conducted over the pyramid 

project, covering most but not all of the drill holes located on the property. Down hole drill surveys 

were conducted on all recent drill holes except in cases where this was impossible due to 

collapsed holes or lost pipe.  



SRK Consulting 
Pyramid Copper-Molybdenum Project Technical Report Page 47 

 

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

A batch of samples from each drill hole were carefully selected and sent to a second ISO certified 

laboratory as a means of data verification. A total of 10 % of all 2012 pulp samples (167) were 

sent to ActLabs for analysis in November 2012. Consistent with the results from 2011, copper 

ICP values from ActLabs were slightly higher than those from ALS and gold values were slightly 

lower. Molybdenum values matched very closely between the two laboratories. For copper ICP, 

there were five sample pairs with over 20% relative difference. All of these pairs were at or below 

500 ppm. For over-limit copper samples, all pairs were within 5% relative difference. As expected, 

there was much more variation in the relative difference of the gold values. The only sample over 

1 ppm (L182223) had an original value of 5.06 ppm and a rerun value of 0.034. As there were no 

other high-grade samples, this sample pair was removed as an outlier.  

A quality control and assurance system was implemented by FMM from the beginning of the 

program, which consisted of placing a blank sample or Standard Reference Material ("SRM") 

sample every 10 samples, alternating between the two. Blank material for 2010 and 2011 was 

sourced from a granodiorite intrusion near the town of Chicken, Alaska intended to have similar 

properties to the host rocks at Pyramid. Overall, these rocks were barren but were later found to 

contain anomalous fracture hosted copper mineralization which led to irregular spikes in the data. 

In 2012, blank material was sourced via AES personnel from an Interior Alaska quarry. This 

material consisted of barren unaltered basalt. Though unmineralized, it contained on average 30 

ppm Cu due to the fact that mafic volcanic rocks naturally contain a higher concentration of 

copper than average crustal rocks. These blanks were systematically sampled to assure that they 

contained sufficiently low metal values before being used. The SRM's used are tabulated in Table 

10.1 and have all been certified by the source company, CDN Laboratories.

There were no outstanding quality control or quality assurance issues during the 2010 to 2012 

seasons. Most standards fell within 2 standard deviations for copper and molybdenum and rarely 

fell near 3 standard deviations, most typically in relation to the gold. The standard with the most 

range in gold was CDN-CM-14 with 3 samples falling outside 3 standard deviations, though not 

considered extreme and these batches were not re-analyzed. 

The 2010 to 2012 external analytical quality control data produced by FMM is summarized in 

Table 10.2.

10.7 2017 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs 

All drill holes for the 2017 drill program were located using a handheld Garmin GPS with an 

accuracy of ± 3 m. Down hole drill surveys were conducted on all recent drill holes except in 

cases where this was impossible due to collapsed holes or lost pipe. Two holes were not 

surveyed because of instrumentation failure. 

A quality control and assurance system was implemented by CopperBank the beginning of the 

program, which consisted of placing a blank sample or Standard Reference Material ("SRM") 

sample every 20 samples, alternating between the two. Four separate SRM were used during the 

2017 drilling program, all were provided by CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. and selected to low, 

medium and high-grade values for copper, molybdenum and gold. A total of 87 SRM were 

introduced in the assay shipments. Analytical results of the SRMs were monitored by 

CopperBank geologists and any SRM falling outside of three standard deviation of the accepted 

value for the SRM was re-assayed by the laboratory. The blank material used was sterile 

limestone purchased from a hardware store. These blanks were systematically sampled to assure 

that they contained sufficiently low metal values before being used. Review of the blank material 

seemed to indicate a minor contamination at the sample preparation laboratory in Fairbanks. 

CopperBank had twenty samples re-assayed because of apparent contamination.  

As a final quality control test, CopperBank had 90 samples assayed by American Assay 

Laboratory ("AAL") of Sparks Nevada as a check on ALS. The results indicated a good correlation 

between both labs for the exception of molybdenum which was consistently reported lower by 

AAL. The lower readings by AAL are attributed to the use of a two-acid digestion process as 

opposed to the four-acid process used by ALS. The four-acid process results in a more complete 

extraction and therefore higher overall assay. SRK is of the opinion that the differences in 

reported molybdenum values between the two laboratories is acceptable and not indicative of any 

assay biases. Table 10.3 summarises the quality control samples utilized by CopperBank during 

the 2017 drilling program.

In the opinion of SRK the sampling preparation, security and analytical procedures used by FMM  

and CopperBank are consistent with generally accepted industry best practices and are therefore 

adequate.

 Data Verification 

11.1 Verifications by SRK 

11.1.1 Site Visit 

SRK Associate, Dr. Gilles Arseneau, carried out a site visit on March 19 and 20, 2013 and again 

on August 10 and 12, 2017. The purpose of the site visits was to examine drill core, core logging 

and sampling procedures, and visit the drill sites. Drill site locations were verified with hand-held 

GPS and were found to agree with the digital database of drill hole locations, a total of ten drill 

sites were verified. Several holes were re-logged and checked against original drill log. SRK 

noted that the original drill logs agreed well with the re-logging and copper assay values seem to 

agree well with the amount of visible chalcopyrite and chalcocite present in drill core. In February 

2013, SRK completed an audit of the FMM analytical and quality control data acquired during the 

sampling of the Pyramid deposit and SRK verified all of the CopperBank assay data against 

original assay certificates provided from ALS. All assays in the current database were verified 

against the independently sourced sample certificates from ALS Laboratories and ActLabs. The 

copper, molybdenum and gold values in the assay table were found to match the laboratory 

certificates. 

After the review, SRK concluded that the Pyramid drilling database was sufficiently reliable for 

inclusion in the estimation of a mineral resource. 

11.1.2 Verifications of 2010 – 2012 Analytical Quality Control Data 

FMM made available to SRK the analytical results for analytical quality control data accumulated 

for the Pyramid drilling project from 2010 to 2012. SRK aggregated the assay results from the 

quality control samples for further analysis. Sample blanks and certified reference materials data 

were summarized on time series plots to highlight any potential failure. Field duplicate paired 

assay data were analysed using scatter plots and ranked absolute relative difference charts. 

Field blanks are used to monitor contamination introduced during sample preparation and to 

monitor analytical accuracy of the laboratory. True blanks should not have any of the elements of 

interest much higher than the detection levels of the instrument being used. SRK consider batch 

samples which contain a blank sample with more than five times of detection limit as problematic 

batches. In general, molybdenum and gold returned good results while copper consistently 

returned values that were too high. The high copper values can be attributed to the fact that FMM 

was using mafic volcanic rocks which naturally contain a higher concentration of copper than 

average crustal rocks. The spikes in the earlier blank samples are due to blank material for 2010 

and 2011 which was sourced from a granodiorite intrusion near the town of Chicken, Alaska 

containing anomalous fracture hosted copper mineralization.  

Analysis of field duplicate samples was undertaken during the 2010 drilling campaign but not in 

2011 and 2012. Scatter plots and percentile rank charts for coarse reject split duplicate copper, 

molybdenum and gold data demonstrated very good correlation between coarse reject splits for 

copper with 87.5% of duplicate pairs having a half absolute relative difference of less than 10%.

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

SRM CDN-CM-13 was the only standard that performed consistently well for gold. The other 

SRM's returned a number of samples with values greater than three standard deviations from the 

certified mean value for the SRM. 

Variable performance of all SRM's used was seen for copper using the ICP-AES method of 

analysis with a number of samples returning values greater than three standard deviations from 

the certified mean value of the SRM. With the exception of CDN-CM-11A in which one sample 

returned a copper value very much greater than three standard deviations of the mean, all SRM's 

performed well when analysed using the AA-OG62 method of analysis for copper. 

All SRM's performed well for molybdenum analysed by the AA-OG62 method of analysis, 

whereas with the ICP-AES method of analysis, CDN-CM-11a returned one sample with a 

molybdenum value of very much greater than three standard deviations from the certified mean 

molybdenum value and CDN-CM-14 returned two samples with molybdenum values greater than 

three standard deviations from the mean. 

FMM did not request re-analysis of batches of samples containing SRM's which returned values 

greater than three standard deviations from the certified mean value of the SRM. Where samples 

were analysed for copper and molybdenum using both the ICP-AES and the AA-OG62 method of 

analysis, the AA-OG62 results were used for the resource estimate and on the whole all SRM's 

performed better using the AA-OG62 method of analysis. However, not all samples were 

analysed using both methods and SRK recommends that for future programs, FMM should 

request re-analysis of batches of samples which return SRM values greater than three standard 

deviations of the mean. 

11.1.3 Verifications of 2017 Analytical Quality Control Data 

CopperBank made available to SRK the assay results for analytical quality control data 

accumulated for the Pyramid drilling project from 2017 drill program. SRK aggregated the assay 

results from the quality control samples for further analysis. Sample blanks and certified reference 

materials data were summarized on time series plots to highlight any potential failure. The results 

indicated no major standard reference material failures for the 2017 drilling program.  

11.2 Independent Verification Sampling  

SRK collected three samples from drill core during the 2017 site visit. Samples were selected by 

SRK to represent typical mineralization encountered in the 2017 drill program. The samples were 

composed of selected pieces of core taken from core boxes. The samples are not intended to be 

duplicate samples but only selected to demonstrate that mineralization is present in the core at 

concentrations similar to that reported by CopperBank. Table 11.1 compares the results obtained 

by SRK with the results reported for the same intervals by CopperBank.

The check sampling by SRK returned very similar copper and molybdenum values to those 

reported by CopperBank indicating that the mineralization is not very nuggety but uniformly 

distributed as would be expected for this style of mineralization.  

 

11.3 SRK Comments 

In the opinion of SRK the drill assay data are sufficient and adequate for the inclusion in a mineral 

resource estimation.

 Mineral Resource Estimates 

13.1 Introduction 

The Mineral Resource Statement presented herein represents the first disclosure of mineral 

resource for the Pyramid Project by CopperBank but the second mineral resource evaluation 

prepared for the Pyramid Project in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators' 

National Instrument 43-101. 

The mineral resource model prepared by SRK considers 63 core boreholes.  Fourteen holes were 

drilled by CopperBank in 2017 including one hole that was abandoned after 28 m. All other drilling 

was carried out by previous property owners in 2010-2012 and 1975. The resource estimation 

work was completed by Dr. Gilles Arseneau, P.Geo (APEGBC #23474) an appropriate 

"independent qualified person" as this term is defined in National Instrument 43-101. The effective 

date of the resource statement is January 15, 2018. 

This section describes the resource estimation methodology and summarizes the key 

assumptions considered by SRK. In the opinion of SRK, the resource evaluation reported herein 

is a reasonable representation of the global copper-molybdenum mineral resources found in the 

Pyramid Project at the current level of sampling. The mineral resources have been estimated in 

conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves 

Best Practices" guidelines and are reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities 

Administrators' National Instrument 43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do 

not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral 

resource will be converted into mineral reserve. 

The database used to estimate the Pyramid Project mineral resources was audited by SRK. SRK 

is of the opinion that the current drilling information is sufficiently reliable to interpret with 

confidence the boundaries for the porphyry copper-molybdenum mineralization and that the 

assay data are sufficiently reliable to support mineral resource estimation. 

Geovia Gems Version 6.8 and LeapFrog Geo Version 4.1.2 were used to construct the geological 

solids, prepare assay data for geostatistical analysis, construct the block model, estimate metal 

grades and tabulate mineral resources. Sage 2001 geostatistical software was used for 

geostatistical analysis and variography.  

13.2 Resource Estimation Procedures 

The resource evaluation methodology involved the following procedures: 

• Database compilation and verification; 

• Construction of wireframe models for the boundaries of the porphyry copper-molybdenum 

mineralization; 

• Definition of resource domains;

Pyramid Copper-Molybdenum Project Technical Report Page 55 

 

GA/MN Pyramid_CopperBank_TR_2CF012.000_20180115_Final.docx January 2018 

• Data conditioning (compositing and capping) for geostatistical analysis and Variography; 

• Block modelling and grade interpolation; 

• Resource classification and validation; 

• Assessment of "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" and selection of appropriate 

cut-off grades; and 

• Preparation of the Mineral Resource Statement. 

13.3 Resource Database 

The mineral resource database comprises 63 diamond drill holes totalling 12,841 metres of 

drilling and 5,646 assay intervals. Nineteen holes were drilled in 1975, six of which were AQ size 

and 13 were NQ. All holes drilled after 1975 were NQ in size. The drill hole data contains the 

following data: 

• Drill hole collar information such as location and length; 

• Down hole survey information such as direction and dip; 

• Lithology information including rock group codes and interpreted geology; 

• Mineralization information including mineral types and percentage; 

• Vein counts and types of veins; 

• Alteration information including alteration type; 

• Down hole specific gravity measurements;  

• Chemical analytical (assay) records; and, 

• Style of mineralization.  

The supplied drill data were imported into Geovia's GemsTM 8.1 software and validated by 

checking for inconsistencies in naming conventions, analytical units, duplicate entries, length, 

distance values, or sample intervals less than or equal to zero, blank or zero-value assays, out-

of-sequence intervals, intervals or distances greater than the reported drill hole length, 

inappropriate collar locations, and missing interval and coordinate fields. A few minor 

inconsistencies were noted and corrected by SRK. No other significant validation errors were 

noted in the supplied database. Gold assay intervals marked below the detection limit of 0.005 g/t 

were assigned a nominal grade of 0.0025 g/t prior to importing into Gems. 

13.4 Bulk Densities 

The data supplied included 59 bulk density measurements collected from the 2010 and 2011 

drilling. In 2010 samples were sent to the ALS Laboratory for density determination and in 2012 

samples representing various lithologies were tested on-site by geologists from Antofagasta 

Minerals using a laboratory scale and recording the mass of drill core pieces in air and in water.

While the measurements show a moderate variation in densities, there are insufficient data to 

interpolate the density into the block model. Specific gravity measurements falling within the 

supergene and hypogene zones were averaged and an average specific gravity value of 2.59 and 

2.68 were applied to the blocks in the supergene and hypogene domains respectively. 

13.5 Solid Body Modelling 

Solid models were generated in Gems to provide spatial limits for each of the mineralization 

domains within the Pyramid copper molybdenum gold porphyry deposit. 

Three domains were modeled: a low-grade leach cap varying between 0 to 90 m in thickness; a 

supergene enrichment zone below the leach cap with variable depth extending to 250 m below 

surface in some areas and defined by increased chalcocite mineralization and higher copper 

values; and the primary hypogene mineralized zone, with copper mainly occurring as 

chalcopyrite, underlying the supergene zone in most areas. Three zones of hypogene 

mineralization were modeled, one to the north of the equigranular diorite, one to the south of the 

equigranular diorite (ED) (together forming the Main Zone) and one to the west of the ED 

intrusion (West Zone). The boundary between the hypogene and supergene mineralization was 

broadly based on the percentage of chalcocite together with the copper values within the drill 

holes.   

The topography surface was constructed from E-Terra satellite imagery tiles from which a DEM 

was created and imported into Gems as a dxf file. Figure 13.1 depicts a three-dimensional (3D) 

view of the modeled resource domains.

13.6 Compositing 

Of the 5,646 assay intervals, over 90% are 2.0 metres in length or shorter. For this reason, a 2.0 

m assay length was selected. Composites were calculated within each of the respective 

mineralized domains and composites less than 0.5 m were excluded from the grade interpolation 

process. 

13.7 Evaluation of Outliers 

Grade capping analysis was conducted on the domain-coded sample assay data in order to limit 

the influence of extreme assay values during estimation. The assays for all domains were 

examined using histograms and cumulative frequency plots. Capping threshold values were 

selected to minimize the influence of isolated outliers, and assay values were capped prior to 

compositing the assay data as outlined in Table 13.1.

13.8 Statistical Analysis and Variography 

Statistical analyses were carried out on the raw assay data. There are 5,646 entries in the drill 

hole assay table for the Pyramid Project. Of these, 1,686 are within the supergene zone and 

1,764 are within the hypogene. The remaining samples are either within country rock (1,357), 

equigranular diorite (288) or within the leach cap (551). Table13.2 summarises the statistical 

information for the entire assay database and for the subset assigned to the supergene and 

hypogene mineralization.

Spatial continuity of copper, molybdenum and gold was evaluated with correlograms developed using 

SAGE 2001 version 1.08. Experimental correlograms and correlogram models were generated from 

capped composited grade data. The nugget effect was established from down hole correlograms. The 

correlogram models used for grade estimation within the supergene and hypogene domains are 

summarized in Table 13.3.

13.9 Block Model and Grade Estimation 

A block model was constructed to cover the entire extent of the modeled mineralized domains for 

Pyramid. The block model includes estimated copper, molybdenum and gold grades as well as 

estimated grades by other than ordinary kriging methods, and an estimated copper equivalent 

(Cu Eq) grade. A block percentage model was used to accurately determine volume and tonnage 

values based on the modeled wireframes. The geometrical parameters of the block model are 

summarized in Table 13.4.

Block Dimensions (metres) 25 25 10 

Number of Blocks 120 105 122 

Rotation (degree) 0° 

 

Ordinary Kriging (OK) was used for the estimation of block grades. For all metals a three-pass 

with varying minimum sample requirements was used for sample selection and estimation.  

Capped composite data used for the estimation was restricted to samples located in the 

respective domains, i.e., hard boundaries were used. Estimated copper, molybdenum, and gold 

block grades were used to estimate CuEq block grades. Estimation criteria for the supergene and 

hypogene domains are summarized in Table 13.5 and Table 13.6 respectively. All interpolated 

blocks were classified as inferred mineral resource.

13.10 Model Validation  

The block model was validated visually by the inspection of successive cross sections in order to 

confirm that the block model correctly reflects the distribution of high-grade and low-grade 

samples. Figure 13.2 shows a typical cross section comparing estimated copper grades with 

composited drill hole assays. As can be seen, the estimated grades seem to agree reasonably 

well with the drill hole composites.  

 

(Source: SRK, 2017) 

Figure 13.2: Cross section 394150 showing copper block grades and composited drill hole grades 

Note: grid lines are 200 by 200m 

 

 An inverse distance squared estimate (ID2) was prepared for the blocks using the same search 

criteria and compared against the OK estimate. The average composite sample grades for all 

blocks containing composite samples (informed blocks) were compared to the OK and ID2 

estimates using QQ plots. The QQ plots for copper estimated by OK are shown in Figure 13.3. 

The estimated block grades agree very well with the composited data. The composites are 

slightly higher than the estimated block grades for grades higher than 0.5% copper which is 

typical of smoothing associated with the ordinary kriging algorithm.

Figure 13.3: QQ plot for copper composites and estimated Ordinary kriged block grades for 
supergene and hypogene mineralization 

The ID2 and OK models were compared using swath plots (Figure 13.4). Both models agree very 

well indicating no significant biases in the OK model. The OK model was also compared to the 

composite data using swath plots and again the estimated copper grades agree well with the drill 

hole composited data (Figure 13.5). Agreement between the model and the composites is 

reasonably good for both the hypogene and supergene. The largest difference between the 

model and the composites is noted in the elevation swath for the hypogene where the number of 

blocks for the comparison are fewer.  

13.11 Mineral Resource Classification 

Block model quantities and grade estimates for the Pyramid Project were classified according to 

the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2014) by 

Dr. Gilles Arseneau, P.Geo. (APEGBC, #23474), an appropriate independent qualified person for 

the purpose of National Instrument 43-101. 

Mineral resource classification is typically a subjective concept, industry best practices suggest 

that resource classification should consider both the confidence in the geological continuity of the 

mineralized structures, the quality and quantity of exploration data supporting the estimates and 

the geostatistical confidence in the tonnage and grade estimates. Appropriate classification 

criteria should aim at integrating both concepts to delineate regular areas at similar resource 

classification. 

SRK is satisfied that the geological modelling honours the current geological information and 

knowledge. The location of the samples and the assay data are sufficiently reliable to support 

resource evaluation. The sampling information was acquired primarily by core drilling on sections 

spaced at about 50-metre spacing. At the current stage of drilling, SRK considers that the 

mineralization at Pyramid satisfies the definition of inferred mineral resource as defined by CIM. 

SRK believes that with limited additional drilling, better knowledge of bulk density and 

metallurgical recoveries, that some of the mineralization could be classified as indicated at the 

current drill spacing.

13.12 Mineral Resource Statement 

CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014) defines a 

mineral resource as: 

"A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or 

on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable 

prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity 

and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted 

from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling." 

The "material of economic interest" refers to diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural 

solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals. 

The "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement generally implies that the 

quantity and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that the mineral resources 

are reported at an appropriate cut-off grade taking into account extraction scenarios and 

processing recoveries. In order to meet this requirement, SRK considers that some portions of 

the Pyramid Project are amenable for open pit extraction.  

In order to determine the quantities of material offering "reasonable prospects for eventual 

economic extraction" by an open pit, SRK used a pit optimizer and reasonable mining 

assumptions to evaluate the proportions of the block model (Indicated and Inferred blocks) that 

could be "reasonably expected" to be mined from an open pit. 

The optimization parameters were selected based on experience and benchmarking against 

similar projects (Table 13.7). The reader is cautioned that the results from the pit optimization are 

used solely for the purpose of testing the "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" 

by an open pit and do not represent an attempt to estimate mineral reserves. There are no 

mineral reserves on the Pyramid Project. The results are used as a guide to assist in the 

preparation of a mineral resource statement and to select an appropriate resource reporting cut-

off grade.

prospects for eventual economic extraction" and can be reported as a mineral resource. Table

13.13 Grade Sensitivity Analysis 

The mineral resources of the Pyramid Project are sensitive to the selection of the reporting cut-off 

grade. To illustrate this sensitivity, the global model quantities and grade estimates within the 

resource shell are presented in Table 13.9  and Figure 13.6 at different cut-off grades. The reader 

is cautioned that the figures presented in this table should not be misconstrued with a Mineral 

Resource Statement. The figures are only presented to show the sensitivity of the block model 

estimates to the selection of cut-off grade.

13.14 Previous Mineral Resource Estimates 

A mineral resource estimate was prepared for the Pyramid Project in 2013 by SRK (SRK, 2013). 

Comparison between the current resource estimate and the 2013 historical estimate is not 

straightforward as the two estimates used different metal prices and recoveries. 

To facilitate the comparison of the 2017 resource estimate with the 2013 resource, SRK re-

evaluated the 2017 resource model using the 2013 parameters. The comparison showed that the 

two models reported very similar grades with the 2017 model and reporting about 25 to 30 

percent more tonnage. The additional tonnage is a reflection of the additional drilling by 

CopperBank which resulted in a reinterpretation of the mineralized domains and in the infill of 

previously undrilled volumes. 

SRK is of the opinion that the current mineral resource estimate compares well with the 2013 

estimate given all the changes in input parameters between the two models.

 Adjacent Properties 

The Alaska Peninsula is a subduction-related volcanic arc that hosts a high concentration of 

intrusion-related porphyry and/or poly-metallic deposits. Many of these have been well 

documented by mining and exploration companies working in the region within the last century. A 

total of 167 occurrences are briefly described per quadrangle in the Alaska Resource Data Files 

(Figure 14.1). Most of the occurrences can be divided into two broad categories: intrusive related 

(porphyry) poly-metallic deposits concentrated mainly on the Alaskan Peninsula; and volcanic 

hosted (epithermal) gold-silver deposits concentrated mainly in the Inner Shumagin Islands. 

14.1 Intrusive Related Occurrences 

Several porphyry prospects are recognized in the Project area including: 

• Porphyry copper – San Diego Bay, Weasel Mt, Mallard Duck 

• Porphyry copper-molybdenum – Bee Creek, Rex 

• Porphyry copper-gold – Kawisgag, Zachary Bay 

• Porphyry molybdenum – Mike 

• Porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum – Pyramid  

• Copper-molybdenum breccias and veins – Weird Duck, Warner Bay 

The majority of the systems have only seen minor exploration including surface sampling and 

geologic mapping. The most recent work undertaken in the area was by FMM and Metallica 

Resources in 2005 and 2006 as part of a joint venture. Several of the prospects were assessed, 

resulting in the placement of three drill holes for a total of 641 m at Bee Creek. No additional work 

has been performed on the other porphyry occurrences since 2006. 

Poly-metallic base metal veins ± gold also occur adjacent to the porphyry systems in a number of 

areas, particularly on the Alaskan peninsula, the most notable vein systems include: 

• The gold-rich base metal Manhattan Prospect veins that were drilled by Pan American and 

later Anaconda occur approximately two miles east of the Cathedral porphyry system. 

• The Marshinlak base metal ± gold veins occur approximately two miles north of the mallard 

Duck porphyry system.  

• Dave's Vein occurs one-mile northeast of the Kawisgag porphyry system. 

• Massive sulfide-bearing base metal veins occur one mile southeast and southwest of the 

Pyramid Mountain porphyry system. 

• The Mud Bay silver-lead rich vein system occurs structurally above a granodiorite stock with 

porphyry affinities.

14.2 Epithermal Occurrences 

Several epithermal gold and silver prospects occur along the Alaskan Peninsula and Aleutian 

chain. Most have only undergone a cursory inspection with the exception of epithermal 

occurrences on the inner Shumagin Islands; particularly Unga and Popof Islands (Figure 14.2). 

Multiple prospects occur on the islands and have been explored 

 and mined as early as 1886. The majority of the work was focused on Unga Islands Apollo vein 

which produced 112,000 ounces of free milling gold from 1886 to 1914. Limited production is also 

reported from the Sitka, Shumagin, and Suzie occurrences on Unga Island. Gold was discovered 

on Popof Island in the late 1980s by Battle Mountain Gold Corp.

 Other Relevant Data and Information 

In addition to the Pyramid Project, CopperBank also has an option on the San Diego Bay 

Property. The San Diego Bay claims are contiguous with the Pyramid Project claims. In January 

2018, CopperBank signed a new exploration agreement specific to this project and will be in 

effect for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. CopperBank will make a minimum exploration 

expenditure of USD $300,000 for 2018 and 2019, and $500,000 for 2020. On or before January 

1, 2021, CopperBank has the option to enter into a mine lease for portions of the San Diego 

exploration lands on the same terms set out in the original option agreement signed June 30, 

2010. 

San Diego bay lies 10 km to the southeast of Pyramid, adjacent to the pyramid tenement. It 

consists of a 60 km2 area of strong argillic alteration, iron oxide staining, and high-sulfidation 

epithermal gold-silver-lead-zinc and porphyry style copper-gold mineralization. The area saw 

limited exploration for gold by RAA and Battle Mountain Gold in the 1980s, but remains largely 

unexplored. Several rock chip and grab samples with high grade silver, copper, lead, and zinc, 

and zones of strong stock work quartz veining were noted by RAA, and two shallow drill holes 

were placed targeting a zone of carbonate veining. FMM and Antofagasta Minerals PLC 

performed minor exploration on the area in 2011 as part of the Pyramid joint venture, including 

geologic mapping, prospecting, and rock sampling. 

This work focused upon four separate areas with known geochemical anomalies, particularly 

those with reported porphyry style alteration and mineralization, some of which have intrusive 

rocks. The limited mapping and sampling resulted in the identification of widespread argillic and 

sericite-pyrite alteration prominently associated with various structures, nominally oriented N-S, 

NNW, and NW. Outcrops with fresh pyrite typically restricted to fracturing is commonplace and 

quartz veining when present, often has vuggy textures indicative of high level alteration. Minor 

amounts of sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and galena are found disseminated in the quartz-silica 

veining along with variable amounts of pyrite. Peripheral to the vein zones, the rocks show 

passive alteration and less frequent quartz-silica occurrences. An area of reported molybdenite 

was prospected though none was encountered, nor were elements of alteration associated with 

molybdenite mineralization.  

In contrast to the Pyramid area, prospecting at San Diego Bay confirms the widespread presence 

of andesite with minor possible diorite intrusive and no diorite porphyry or hornfelsed sedimentary 

rocks were identified in our limited work nor reported in the historic work by RAA. 

CopperBank carried out limited exploration during the 2017 filed season on the San Diego Bay 

area and commissioned Auracle Geospatial of Vancouver to carry out a structural analysis of the 

San Deigo Bay area, the results of which will be incorporated in a new technical report in early 

2018.

 Interpretation and Conclusions 

The Pyramid Project is an early stage copper molybdenum gold exploration prospect located on 

the southwestern tip of the Alaskan Peninsula, Alaska, USA. The history of Pyramid dates back to 

the mid-1970s when geologists from the Aleut Corp (TAC)-Quintana-Duval joint venture identified 

porphyry copper-molybdenum potential during regional reconnaissance along the Alaskan 

Peninsula.  

Drilling by CopperBank and the previous owners has identified Cu-Mo mineralization centered on 

several small late Miocene porphyry intrusions, hosted by a sequence of Late Cretaceous-early 

Tertiary clastic sedimentary rock.  

A total of 63 drill holes totaling 12,841 m has delineated an inferred mineral of 153.4 million 

tonnes grading 0.09 g/t Au, 0.37% Cu and 0.02% Mo. Mineral resources were estimated in 

conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 

Best Practices" guidelines by ordinary kriging using Gemcom Gems software. Mineral resources 

may be affected by further infill and exploration drilling that may result in increases or decreases 

in subsequent resource estimates 

SRK is not aware of any significant risks and uncertainties that could be expected to affect the 

reliability or confidence in the early stage exploration information discussed herein.

 Recommendations 

The 2017 field season was successful in expanding the mineral resources and demonstrating the 

continuity of the mineralization at Pyramid. SRK recommends that CopperBank continues to 

explore the Pyramid Project.  Specifically, SRK recommends additional drilling to in-fill some of 

the wider spaced drilled areas and expand on the known mineralization.  SRK also recommends 

that CopperBank initiates a preliminary metallurgical testing program to determine the viability of 

extracting molybdenum and gold and to better define the copper recovery. Additionally, SRK 

recommends that CopperBank collect additional bulk density data to enhance the quality of future 

mineral estimates.  

Following the next drilling campaign and contingent on positive results, SRK recommends that 

CopperBank prepare a Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") for the Pyramid Project.  

A program of at least 2,500 m of diamond core drilling in 10 holes is recommended with drill holes 

taken to depths greater than 250 m on average. Specifically, SRK recommends that the central 

equigranular diorite be tested to determine if this unit is truly barren of mineralization or not. The 

total phase one program is estimated to cost approximately 1.4 million dollars (Table 17.1). The 

total cost of the combined phases is expected to be about 1.6 million dollars. 

Table 17.1: Estimated Cost for the Exploration Program Proposed for the Pyramid Project.  

Description Quantity Unit Cost Estimate (US$) 

Phase 1 Program    

Diamond drilling all in cost ($500/m) 2500 metres $1,250,000 

Metallurgical testing (6 drill core composites)   $160,000 

Bulk density measurements   $4,000 

TOTAL Phase 1   $1,414,000 

Phase 2 Program Contingent on Phase 1 results    

Preliminary Economic Assessment   $200,000 

Total Phase 2   $200,000 

Total Recommendations (Phase 1 + 2)   $1,614,000 

 

SRK is unaware of any other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right 

or ability to perform the exploration work recommended for the Pyramid Project.
