CAUTIONARY NOTE WITH RESPECT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
This document contains forward-looking information as defined in applicable securities laws. 
Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements with respect to the future production, 
costs and expenses of the project; the other economic parameters of the project, as set out in this technical 
report, including; the success and continuation of exploration activities, including drilling; estimates of 
mineral reserves and mineral resources; the future price of gold; government regulations and permitting 
timelines; requirements for additional capital; environmental risks; and general business and economic 
conditions.  Often, but not always, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of words such 
as plans, expects, is expected, budget, scheduled, estimates, continues, forecasts, projects, predicts, 
intends, anticipates or believes, or variations of, or the negatives of, such words and phrases, or statements 
that certain actions, events or results may, could, would, should, might or will be taken, occur or be achieved. 
Forward-looking information involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may 
cause the actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any of the future 
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking information.  These risks, 
uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to: the assumptions underlying the production 
estimates not being realized, decrease of future gold prices, cost of labour, supplies, fuel and equipment 
rising, the availability of financing on attractive terms, actual results of current exploration, changes in project 
parameters, exchange rate fluctuations, delays and costs inherent to consulting and accommodating rights 
of local communities, title risks, regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to obtaining necessary 
permits or delays in obtaining same, and other risks involved in the gold production, development and 
exploration industry, as well as those risk factors discussed in Monument Mining Limited's latest Annual

1 Executive Summary 
 Property Description and Ownership 

Monument Mining Limited (TSX-V: MMY and FSE: D7Q1) (MMY) is a mining and exploration company 
based in Vancouver, British Columbia, with an existing operation in Malaysia. In 2014, it acquired the 
Burnakura and Gabanintha properties from Kentor Gold (subsidiary of KGL Resource Ltd), and 
Tuckanarra from Phosphate Australia later that year. All properties are located in the Murchison region 
of Western Australia.  

The Burnakura Project will be the major focus for MMY in Western Australia.  MMY has completed a 
Mineral Resource update as stated in this report and is looking to shortly conduct a Preliminary 
Economic Assessment (PEA) of the Burnakura property.  The Mineral Resources update was 
completed by independent external consultants, SRK Consulting (Australasia) Pty Ltd (SRK).  SRK 
has been commissioned by MMY to prepare an Independent Technical Report (ITR) on the Burnakura 
Project. 

The Burnakura property consists of several deposits, all with pre-existing open pit mining being carried 
out.  In the North of Alliance 2 deposit, an underground mining has also been carried out.  The deposits 
that are the focus of this report are:  

• Alliance and New Alliance (ANA)  

• North of Alliance 1 to 8 (NOA)  

• Federal City 

• Authaal. 

The Burnakura site also contains a non-operational processing plant (previously capable of processing 
up to 0.3 Mt per annum), mining camp and office block complex. 

Access to the Burnakura Property area is approximately 765 km north-northeast of Perth via the 
sealed Great Northern Highway and then via numerous unsealed private and shire-maintained roads. 

 Geology and Mineralisation 
The Burnakura gold project covers an area on the eastern margin of the Archean 
Meekatharra-Wydgee greenstone belt within the north-eastern Murchison Domain of the Yilgarn 
Craton.  The Murchison Domain forms part of the Youanmi Terrane.  Limited geochronology shows 
that most greenstones and granitic rocks of the Murchison Domain were deposited or emplaced 
between 3.0 Ga and 2.6 Ga.  

The majority of the Burnakura gold project covers Archaean basement rocks assigned to the 
2815--2805 Ma basal Norrie Group of the Murchison Supergroup covering the eastern margin of the 
Meekatharra-Wydgee greenstone belt.  

The Burnakura gold deposits are situated along a northeast trending splay (Burnakura Shear Zone) 
that parallels and is linked to the north-northeast trending regional scale Mt Magnet fault.  The 
Mt Magnet fault is the major east bounding structure to the 'Meekatharra structural zone', a major 
regional, northeast-trending shear dominated zone, about 50 to 60 km wide, incorporating the 
Meekatharra area.  The Meekatharra structural zone is dominated by north- and northeast-trending 
folds and shears, including refolded folds with approximately coplanar fold axes.  Many of the folds 
are truncated by shears or faults, and the structural zone is interpreted as a major zone of shear-
related deformation.

Gold mineralisation is thought to have extended for at least 30 Ma from 2,660 to 2,630 Ma during 
predominantly strike-slip D4 shearing.  Significantly, the peak of granitic magmatism at 2,660 Ma is 
coincident with the onset of major gold mineralisation, suggesting a cogenetic relationship through 
magma- and heat-driven remobilisation of mineralisation originally hosted by older volcanic rocks.  
Gold deposition has been precisely dated at 2,639±4 Ma in the South Emu deposit at the Reedy mining 
centre, some 20 km southwest of Burnakura. 

The Burnakura Thrust Zone (BTZ) gold mineralisation is typical of a brittle to semi-ductile shear zone 
forming semi-continuous dilational veins.  A mineralised horizon may extend >100 m, but the thickness 
and the tenor of mineralisation within these horizons is highly variable and discontinuous.  The 
thickness may vary by ±100% on the 5–10 m scale. 

The NOA mineralisation is associated with the NOA fault and NOA splays. The mineralisation is 
dominated by steep dipping quartz (±minor sulphides) veins orientated parallel to the foliation of the 
fault zone.  Minor sulphides are present and little alteration of the host lithology is also observed.  The 
gold mineralisation is low grade (i.e. <1.5 g/t) and sporadic, but within the BTZ, moderate grades have 
been recorded ranging from ~3 to 4 g/t. 

The ANA and Federal City prospects, the rheological contrast between the banded iron formations 
(BIFs) and the tuffs have likely played an important role as an additional geological control to create a 
favourable environment for veining and gold mineralisation.  

 Project Status  
The Burnakura Property area and surrounding environs have a long gold mining history with 
underground operations commencing in 1897 at Alliance and Federal City areas.  The existing 
processing facility on site operated between 2005 and 2013 in conjunction with concurrent open pit 
and underground mining; however, modern mining with processing off-site was completed between 
1989 and 1997. 

Drilling within the Burnakura gold project has been undertaken by numerous mining and exploration 
companies since 1987 though to 2017.  A total of 378,393 m of drilling has been completed, of which 
MMY has completed 48,644 m, representing 13%of the total database.  Sample preparation and 
analytical techniques are considered by SRK to be globally appropriate and as such, the data is 
appropriate to be used in Mineral Resource estimation studies.  SRK notes that significant QAQC 
verification work has been completed. 

 Mineral Resource Estimates 
The Mineral Resource estimates for the project is reported in accordance with National Instrument 
43-101 and has been estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum 
('CIM') 'Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines' (2014).  The 
Mineral Resource estimates are classified as Indicated and Inferred as defined by the CIM. Numbers 
displayed in Tables E-1 to E-5 are affected by rounding.  Reporting cutoffs have been determined on 
the basis of the broad economics of the mining style proposed (Underground Mining 3 g/t Au 
(NOA 7--8) Open Pit Mining 0.5 g/t Au (NOA1-6;ANA,Authaal,Federal City)).

 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
The existing mill at Burnakura produced around 58 koz of gold in concentrate, using a combination of 
gravity and flotation. 

The mineralisation defined in the Mineral Resources reported is thought to have similar metallurgical 
characteristics to previously mined ore in contiguous geological areas; however, some differences are 
noted at depth and there are also changes in local geology.  These areas require further investigation 
by collection of appropriate representative samples and completion of subsequent testwork.  

Further metallurgical testwork is planned as part of an ongoing development plan for the project, 
including investigations into heap leach processing.  SRK notes that further testwork is currently being 
completed by MMY to assist in refining recoveries and developing the optimal metallurgical flowsheet.  

 Conclusions and Recommendations 
SRK has completed updates of the Mineral Resource Estimates suitable for input into Preliminary 
Economic Analysis studies that are to be completed by MMY.  The basis of the Mineral Resource 
Estimates were an updated geological interpretations and review of all available data for the project 
over its 20-year plus history. 

The update of the Mineral Resources will also allow for refined targeting of proposed drilling programs 
to extend and infill the mineralisation to achieve a higher confidence and enlarged Mineral Resource 
in the future. 

The review of the available metallurgical data and its relationship with the mineralisation will allow 
better targeting of resources to define a refined data collection outcome. 

SRK considers that this study report will assist in progressing the project in a refined manner.

From the review of historic work and recent drilling by Monument Murchison Limited (Monument), it is 
apparent that there is an opportunity to extend the mineralisation envelopes and infill the current 
inferred classified material to improve and extend the mineral resource estimation confidence.  

Current focus of exploration includes: 

• Further definition and extension the NOA mineralisation 

• Collection of additional metallurgical data 

• Definition and extension of shallow oxide gold occurrences on the Burnakura leases. 

Other recommended work programs to enhance future resource modelling include:  

• Further studies of the structural setting and timing of the mineralisation which may lead to deeper 
exploration targeting 

• Gold characterisation 

• Lithogeochemistry studies to improve understanding of the mineralising geology and alteration 
types  

• Metallurgical characterisation studies to assess variability of mineralisation for mineral processing.

2 Introduction 
 Introduction 

Monument Mining Limited (TSX-V: MMY and FSE: D7Q1) (MMY) is a mining and exploration company 
based in Vancouver, British Columbia, with an existing operation in Malaysia.  In 2014, it acquired the 
Burnakura and Gabanintha properties from Kentor Gold (subsidiary of KGL Resource Ltd), and 
Tuckanarra from Phosphate Australia later that year.  All properties are located in the Murchison region 
of Western Australia as shown in Figure 2-1. 

 

Figure 2-1: Monument Mining Limited – Murchison Operations location 
The Burnakura Project will be the major focus for MMY in Western Australia.  MMY has completed a 
Mineral Resource update as stated in this report, and is looking to shortly conduct a Preliminary 
Economic Assessment (PEA) of the Burnakura property. 

The Mineral Resources update was completed by independent external consultants SRK (Australasia) 
Pty Ltd (SRK), with SRK qualified personnel providing the necessary signatories. 

The Burnakura property consists of several deposits, all with pre-existing open pit mining being carried 
out.  In the North of Alliance 2 deposit, an underground mining has also been carried out.  The deposits 
that are the focus of this report are:  

• Alliance and New Alliance (ANA)  

• North of Alliance 1 to 8 (NOA)  

• Federal City 

• Authaal. 

Several other deposits with previously mined open pits also exist with future geological resource 
potential with additional data collection which include: 

• Banderol 

• Lewis 

• Reward. 

The Burnakura site also contains a non-operational processing plant (previously capable of processing 
up to 0.3 Mt per annum), mining camp and office block complex. Figure 2-2 shows the various 
deposits, processing plant and camp locations at Burnakura.

 Scope of Work 
SRK has been commissioned by MMY to prepare an Independent Technical Report (ITR) on the 
Burnakura Project in the state of Western Australia (the Project), to provide a disclosure of the updated 
Mineral Resources. The scope of work as determined by MMY's senior corporate management 
required SRK to complete the Mineral Resource estimates based on updated geological 
interpretations.  The report also includes an update on the metallurgical testwork completed. 

 Basis of technical report 
This report is based on information collected by the authors during site visits and on additional 
information provided by MMY throughout the course of the authors' discussions and technical reviews.  
Other information was obtained from non-published past producer reports, internal technical 
memorandums and other public domain sources.  

 Work program 
The work program included collation and review of all geological resource aspects and update of the 
Mineral Resource models with additional review of the completed metallurgical testwork.  This was 
then compiled in an Independent Technical Report (ITR).  The ITR complies with disclosure and 
reporting requirements set forth in the Canadian Securities Administrators National instrument 
NI43-101, Companion Policy 43-101CP and Form NI43-101F1 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, 
Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Code (2014). 

 Site visit 
David Slater, the principal author of the ITR and SRK's Principal Resource Geologist, visited the 
Burnakura Project on between 7 and 9 March 2018 to assess it for available data and data collection 
protocols.   

 Sources of information 
MMY supplied all sources of information that were validated by SRK.  This information included all 
data, reports and discussions with MMY staff.

4 Property Description and Location 
 Location 

The Burnakura property area is located at latitude 27° 03' 48'' S, longitude 118° 25' 47''E, and is 
approximately 600 km north-northeast of Perth, Western Australia, and covers an area of ~144.1 km3. 
It is situated in the Murchison Mineral Field within the Mid-West region of Western Australia, and 
comprises a number of historical workings, non-operational open pits, a closed NOA 2 underground 
mine, mining tenements, historical gold resources, the Burnakura gold plant, mine infrastructure and 
accommodation village (Burnakura Property).  The Burnakura gold operation is currently on care and 
maintenance, with only exploration operations and environmental monitoring being undertaken.  The 
Burnakura Property was granted a mining tenement holding.  

 Land tenure 
The Burnakura Property mining tenements were purchased by Monument Murchison Pty Ltd (a fully 
owned subsidiary of MMY) (Monument) on 21 February, 2014.  The Burnakura Property mining 
tenements and associated infrastructure were acquired from Jinka Minerals Limited, Kentor Minerals 
(WA) and KGL Resources Limited as part of the Murchison Gold Project acquisition (see Monument 
Press Release #14-2014, 25 February 2014).  

As of 26 February 2017, the Burnakura Property mining tenements comprise six granted mining 
leases; five granted prospecting licences and three granted exploration licences that cover a combined 
area of approximately 114 km2.  

Mining tenements are currently held in the name of Monument Murchison Pty Ltd.  It is understood 
that Monument holds 100% beneficial mineral rights over all mining tenements.  The total annual 
expenditure commitment for the Burnakura Property mining tenements is $604,840.  The Burnakura 
Property mining tenement details are presented in Table 4-1.  

Group annual reporting status (Department of Minerals and Petroleum Ref: C21/2005) was previously 
granted by the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) for M51/116, M51/117, M51/177, 
M51/178, M51/252 and M51/478 on 22 March 2005.  Prospecting licences P51/2793-2797 were 
granted group reporting status on 16 January 2014.  Exploration licences E51/1618, E51/1553 and 
E51/1562 were granted group reporting on  31 July 2015.  Exploration licences E51/1687 were granted 
group reporting on 30th December 2016. 

The Burnakura Property mining tenements are located on the Culculli pastoral lease (3114/455).  The 
extreme northern portion of mining lease M51/116 is located over the Polelle pastoral lease 
(3114/550).  The main northern access road is partially covered by miscellaneous licences L51/78 and 
L51/79 held by GMK Exploration Pty Ltd.  

The mining tenements are covered by the Yugunga-Nya People Native Title Claim (WC1999/046).  
The corresponding Yugunga-Nya People and Sandfire Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) also 
cover this area. 

 Underlying agreements 
The current underlying agreements are as follows: 

1. The Burnakura mining tenements are wholly within land the subject of the Yugunga-Nya People 
Native Title Claim (WC 1999/046), registered in the Federal Court of Australia.  



SRK Consulting Page 11 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

2. The eastern portion of exploration licence E 51/1562 is the subject of the Wutha People Native 
Title Claim (WC 1999/010), registered in the Federal Court of Australia.  The area of this portion 
totals 6.59 km2 (658.92 Ha) is overlapping with the Yugunga-Naya Claim as described in (1).  

3. With the exception of the eastern portion of exploration licence E 51/1562 covered by the Wutha 
claim as described in (2), the Burnakura mining tenements are wholly covered by the Yugunga-
Nya People and Sandfire ILUA, registered with the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) on 21 
September 2012. 

4. The Burnakura Mining leases were granted prior to 1 January 1994 and the commencement of 
the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth).  The mining leases constitute valid 'past acts' (sections 14 and 19 
of the Act and Section 5 of the Titles (Validation) and Native Title (Effect of Past Acts) Act 1995 
(WA)); hence, they are valid against native title.  However, validation of past acts does not 
constitute extinguishment of native title, and it is still possible for native title to exist for the mining 
leases.   

5. The Burnakura prospecting licences and exploration licences were granted subsequent to the 
enactment of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) via the expedited procedure, and hence are subject 
to native title.  The author of this section of the report has not reviewed any heritage agreements.   

6. There are two sites registered in accordance with the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA) on the 
Department of Indigenous Affairs Register with direct relation to the ANA deposits at Burnakura.  
Site P07597 relates to Artefacts/ Scatter that covers parts of M51/116 and M51/177, including the 
NOA 1 and NOA 2 open pits and waste dump, and the NOA 4 and NAO 6 in-pit tails storage 
facility.  Site P03587 relates to a mythological site associated with Cullculli Hill and in part covers 
the western boundary of exploration licence E51/1553.  

 Royalties 
A royalty agreement is in place with Royal Gold Inc., which was formerly with Barrick Gold Australia 
Limited (previously named Homestake Gold Australia Limited), in which a royalty is payable after the 
production of 300,000 ozs of gold from an area that was formerly the subject of a joint venture between 
Metana Minerals and Homestake Gold Australia Limited.  No royalties have been paid so far; however, 
continued mining and milling at the Burnakura Property is likely to trigger the clause of a royalty 
payment of 1.5% on a net smelter return of up to 75,000 ozs/ annum Au, and a 2.5% net smelter return 
for production in excess of 75,000 ozs/ annum Au (Mapleson et al., 2015).   

Gold royalties are due to the State of Western Australia (WA) at a rate of 2.5% of the 'royalty value' of 
the gold metal produced after the first 2,500 ozs of gold metal produced during the financial year 
('royalty value' refers to the product of the total gold metal produced during the month and the average 
gold spot price) (Harvey et al., 2007).   

Silver royalties are due to the State of WA at a rate of 2.5% of the realised value.  Company tax in 
Australia is charged a rate of 30% of profits.  Payroll tax is charged by the State of WA at a rate of 
5.5% to companies, where annual wages and salaries exceed $750,000.  A diesel fuel rebate is 
available at $0.38 per litre for mining activities (Mapleson et al., 2015).   

 Permits and authorisation 

 Exploration and Mining Legislative Framework 
West Australian Mining Act 
Section 9 of the West Australian Mining Act 1978 ('Mining Act') states, 'Except in the case of land 
alienated in fee simple before the 1st January 1899 (in which case minerals other than gold, silver and 
precious metals are the property of the owner), all minerals are the property of the Crown.' Where the 



SRK Consulting Page 12 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

minerals are the property of the Crown, a mining title must be obtained from the Department of Mines, 
Industry Regulation and Safety (DMIRS), formerly Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP), before 
any mining operations may be undertaken.  For the purposes of the Mining Act, Western Australia is 
divided into various mineral fields, some further divided into districts.  The Burnakura Property's 
licences fall within the Murchison mineral field.   

The mining tenements available under the Mining Act are as follows:  

• Prospecting Licences (Sections 40–56)  

• Special Prospecting Licences for Gold (Sections 56A, 70 and 85B)  

• Exploration Licences (Sections 57–69E)  

• Retention Licences (Sections 70A–70M)  

• Mining Leases (Sections 70O–85A)  

• General Purpose Leases (Sections 86–90)  

• Miscellaneous Licences (Sections 91–94).   

The basic provisions of each type of Burnakura mining tenement are summarised in Table 4-1 and 
further described below: 

Prospecting licences 
For Prospecting licences, the following applies: 

• The maximum area for a prospecting licence is 200 Ha. 

• Prospecting licences must be marked out. 

• Application is made to the Mining Registrar of the relevant Mineral Field. 

• An application fee and rental is payable. 

• There is no limit to the number of licences a person or company may hold, but a security (or bond) 
is required in respect of each licence. 

• The term of a prospecting licence is 4 years, with the provision to extend for one further 4-year 
period.  

• The holder of a prospecting licence may, in accordance with the licence conditions, extract or 
disturb up to 500 t of material from the ground, including overburden, and the Minister may approve 
extraction of larger tonnages. 

Exploration licences  
On 28 June 1991, a graticular boundary (or block) system was introduced for exploration licences as 
follows:  

• The minimum size of an exploration licence is one block, and the maximum size is 70 blocks, 
except in areas not designated as mineralised areas, where the maximum size is 200 blocks  

• An exploration licence is not physically marked out  

• Application is made at any Mining Registrar's Office, or lodged electronically via the DMIRS, 
Mineral Titles Online system.  

Table 4-1 shows the charges applicable.

• There is no limit to the number of licences a person or company may hold, but a security ($5,000) 
is required in respect of each licence. 

• The term of an exploration licence applied for after 10 February 2006 is five years.  

The Minister may extend the term of an exploration licence if grounds for extension exist as follows:  

• By one period of five years; and  

• By a further period of two years.  

• For all exploration licences applied for and granted after 10 February 2006, the holder of an 
exploration licence is obliged to surrender 40% of the number of blocks subject to the licence 
within 5 years of the date of grant.  The minister may defer this requirement by a period of one year 
if grounds for an extension exist.  

• The holder of an exploration licence may, in accordance with the licence conditions, extract or 
disturb up to 1,000 t of material from the ground, including overburden, and the Minister may 
approve extraction of larger tonnages.  

• Exploration licences are subject to a prescribed minimum annual expenditure commitment 
enforced by the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DMIRS).  This requirement 
applies to granted licences only, and the labour cost of the licence holders' own work on the licence 
(contract equivalent) may be treated as expenditure.  

• The holder of an exploration licence must lodge a Form 5 Operations Report detailing the annual 
expenditure on a mining tenement to the Department of Mines and Petroleum. 

Table 4-2 lists the Mining Tenement details and their expenditure schedule.  Figure 4-1 describes 
tenement locations.

Mining leases 
For mining leases, the following applies: 

• The maximum area for a mining lease applied for before 10 February 2006 is 1,000 Ha.  

• After this date, the size applied for relates to an identified orebody, as well as an area for 
infrastructure requirements.  

• Mining leases must be marked out.  

• Application is made to the Mining Registrar of the relevant Mineral Field.  

• An application fee and rental is payable.  

• Pursuant to Section 74(1)(ca) of the Mining Act, an application for a mining lease shall be 
accompanied by a mining proposal OR a statement in accordance with Subsection (1a) and a 
Mineralisation report that has been prepared by a Qualified Person.  The statement under 
Subsection (1a) shall set out information regarding the mining operation likely to be carried out 
including:  

− When mining is likely to commence  

− The most likely method of mining  

− The location and area of land that is likely to be required for the operation of the plant, 
machinery and equipment and for the other activities associated with those mining operations  

− There is no limit to the number of mining leases a person or company may hold  

− The term of a mining lease is 21 years and may be renewed for further terms  

− The lessee of a mining lease may work and mine the land, take and remove minerals and 
undertake all things necessary to effectually carry out mining operations in, on or under the 
land, subject to conditions of title.  

The mining proposal for the Burnakura operation was submitted in December 2016 and approved in 
February 2017 (refer APM 2016 'Revised Mining Proposal Monument Murchison Gold Project 
Burnakura Operations' prepared for Monument by Animal Plant Mineral Pty Ltd December 2016; a 
subsequent letter of approval is contained in Appendix 1 DMP February 2017 'Approval for Mining 
Proposal – Monument Murchison Gold Project Burnakura Pit Cut-Backs and Heap Leach Facility on 
M 51/116, M 51/117, M 51/177 and M 51/252 Registration ID: 61054'). 

Mining operation 
Under the Mines Safety and Inspection Act 1994, a mining operator must have an approved project 
management plan (PMP) in place before any construction or mining operations commence.  This plan 
must be submitted via the online system of the DMIRS. 

As at February 2018, the Monument operation has a PMP lodged on the DMIRS online Safety 
Regulation System (SRS) system.  This PMP covers both construction refurbishment of the processing 
plant, and the mining operation is awaiting the final mining and processing plan update prior to final 
approval. 

Other legislation covering the safe operation of the mining operations in WA and administered under 
the DMIRS are: 

• Mines Safety and Inspection Act 1994 

• Mines Safety and Inspection Regulations 1995 

• Mines Safety and Inspection Levy Regulations 2010 

• Various dangerous goods safety legislation including: 



SRK Consulting Page 18 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

− Dangerous Goods Safety Act 2004 

− Dangerous Goods Safety (Storage and Handling of Non-Explosives) Regulations 2007 

− Dangerous Goods Safety (Road, Rail Transport of Non-Explosives) Regulations 2007 

− Dangerous Goods Safety (Explosives) Regulations 2007. 

It should be noted that as of December 2017, the WA government is developing a revised Work and 
Health and Safety Bill that will replace the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984, Mines Safety and 
Inspection Act 1994, which will both in effect govern safety management at the Burnakura operation 
once it is in full operation. 

 Native Title Act 
In 1992, the High Court of Australia determined in Mabo v Queensland (No. 2) that the common law 
of Australia recognised certain proprietary rights and interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
people in relation to their traditional lands and waters.  In response to the Mabo decision, the Native 
Title Act 1993 (Cth) was enacted.  'Native tile' is recognised where persons claiming to hold that title 
can establish they have maintained a continuous connection with the land in accordance with 
traditional laws and customs since settlement and where those rights have not been lawfully 
extinguished. 

The Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (NTA) codifies much of the common law in relation to native title.  The 
doing of acts after 23 December 1996 that may affect native title (known as 'future acts'), including the 
grant of mining tenements, are validated subject to certain procedural rights afforded to persons 
claiming to hold native title and whose claim has passed a 'registration test' administered by the NNTT 
(which assesses the claim against certain baseline requirements). 

 Effect of Native Title on mining tenements 
In Western Australia, the State processes applications for exploration licences under the 'expedited 
procedure' of the NTA, subject to the applicant for the exploration licences first giving the State 
satisfactory evidence that it has offered to enter into, or is already party to, an appropriate Aboriginal 
heritage agreement. 

Where a mining tenement is advertised under the expedited procedure, those persons having a 
registered native title claim (or any persons who may become persons having a registered native title 
claim) may object to the application of that procedure within four months of the relevant advertisement 
date. 

If an objection is received, the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) must determine whether or not 
the expedited procedure should apply to the relevant application for the mining tenement.  In doing so, 
the NNTT must consider whether or not the grant of that tenement: 

• Is likely to interfere directly with the carrying on of the community or social activities of any holders 
of native title or persons having a registered native title claim 

• Is likely to interfere with areas or sites of particular significance to any holders of native title or 
persons having a registered native title claim 

• Is likely to, or will create, rights whose exercise is likely to involve major disturbance to the land 
the subject of the licence. 

If the NNTT determines that the expedited procedure should apply to the application, the State may 
proceed to grant the application.  If the NNTT determines that the expedited procedure should not 
apply to the application, the 'right to negotiate' process in the NTA will apply to the application, whereby 



SRK Consulting Page 19 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

the applicant for the tenement, any holders of native title and registered native title claim groups over 
the relevant land and the State are obliged to negotiate in good faith for a minimum of six months. 

 Aboriginal Heritage Act  
The Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA) (AHA) and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage 
Protection Act 1984 (Cth) protect places and objects that are of significance to Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander people in accordance with their traditional laws and customs (Aboriginal Sites).  The 
AHA provides that it is an offence for a person to damage or in any way alter an Aboriginal Site. 

Compliance with the AHA is an express condition of all mining tenements in WA.  Accordingly, 
commission of an offence under the AHA may mean that the exploration licence is vulnerable to an 
order for forfeiture.  The Department of Indigenous Affairs maintains a Register of sites that have been 
registered under the AHA.  The Register does not purport to be comprehensive.  Sites and objects of 
significance to Aboriginal persons are protected by the Act whether or not those sites are registered 
under the AHA.  MMY may need to engage with Aboriginal persons with appropriate traditional 
knowledge of the land the subject of the exploration licence applications to ensure that any proposed 
works will not interfere with any Aboriginal sites that are not recorded in the Register. 

 Permitting and Approvals  
Mining tenements are subject to various conditions under the Mining Act.  These include standard 
conditions for the protection of the environment and conditions that relate to the protection of certain 
third-party interests in land (particularly reserves).  The Burnakura Property mining tenements are 
subject to compliance with these conditions.   

Prior to a mining company or prospector conducting any ground-disturbing activities with mechanised 
equipment in Western Australia, they are required by the Mining Act (sections 46, 63 and 82) to 
complete and submit a Program of Work (PoW) application to the DMIRS' Environment Division.  The 
PoW for is used to detail: 

• Exploration work to be undertaken  

• Total area proposed to be disturbed (Ha)  

• Land tenure  

• Existing environment  

• Environmental management  

• Rehabilitation practices to be used.   

Once approved, the PoW becomes a legally binding document which is often imposed as a tenement 
condition.  Any alterations or expansion of the approved activities requires a new PoW application to 
be lodged and approved.  Approved PoWs are valid for a period of 12 months unless an extension is 
granted.  It is expected that rehabilitation activities under a PoW is completed within six months from 
the date the ground-disturbing activity occurs. 

In addition to a number of standard environmental conditions attached to mining tenements, there are 
normally a number of environmental conditions attached to the approval of a PoW. 

The DMIRS may require an Unconditional Performance Bond to be lodged as financial security for 
higher risk exploration programmes that involve significant ground disturbance (e.g. cut and fill 
activities).  Generally, bonding is based on a standard dollar amount per hectare of disturbance but 
may also involve an additional rate to account for rehabilitation costs. 

The Minerals Environment Branch of the Environment Division administers aspects of the Mining Act 
and Mining Regulations 181 relating to the activities of the mining industry by undertaking the 



SRK Consulting Page 20 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

assessment, approval and inspection of mining and exploration projects.  When exploring on Mining 
tenure that covers Pastoral Leases, the tenement holder is required to notify the pastoralist of the 
timeframe and extent of the proposed activities. 

In addition, other legislation that may be applicable to the environmental regulation of mining activities 
(including exploration) includes:  

• Environmental Protection Act 1986 (WA)  

• Conservation and Land Management Act 1984 (WA)  

• Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 (WA)  

• Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914 (WA)  

• Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth)  

• Contaminated Site Act 2003.  

SRK could not determine any reasons or factors that would prevent the right or ability of MMY to 
conduct future exploration programs, over the areas covered by the granted mining tenements.   

Mining leases M51/116 and M51/177 were subject to an ethnographic and archaeological survey 
conducted during 1996 (Macintyre, et al 1996).  There were no ethnographic sites of Aboriginal 
significance located within the proposed boundaries of the NOA 2, NOA 4, NOA 6, and NOA 7/ 8 open 
pits, haul roads and waste dumps.  The survey identified one archaeological site, FS 1, which consists 
of a creek line artefact scatter.  The site is considered of moderate significance, and if disturbance of 
the site is required, permission under Section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972–1980 (WA) must 
be obtained.  It was concluded that the significance of this site is reduced due to disturbance caused 
by cyclic flooding that results in movement of the artefacts. 

Eight archaeological sites and two combined ethnographic–archaeological sites had been previously 
identified within a 20-kilometre radius of the NOA mine workings.  It was recommended that all granite 
domes, outcrops and breakaways be avoided unless a thorough archaeological study of such areas 
has been conducted (Macintyre, et al 1996).  Recommended that prior to any future development 
outside those areas surveyed further archaeological surveys should be undertaken (Animal Plant 
Mineral Pty Ltd, 2013). 

The author of this section of the report has not reviewed any of the Aboriginal heritage agreements 
that relate to the Burnakura exploration and prospecting licences, but understands them to be in good 
standing. 

The Aboriginal Heritage Agreements entered into with the Yamatji Marlpa Aboriginal Corporation as 
agent for the Yugunga Nya Claim Group provides: 

• For the expeditious grant and validity of the tenements without objections by the claimant group  

• The grant of the tenements is not likely to interfere directly with the community life of the claimant 
group, is not likely to cause damage, disturbance or interference to areas or sites or particular 
significance to the claimant group and is not likely to involve major disturbance to any land or 
waters in the claim areas  

• That all work done to the tenements is in compliance with the provisions of the Aboriginal Heritage 
Act 1972 (WA) and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Act 1984 (Cth) the 
requirement for the tenement holder to undertake heritage surveys for the purposes of locating 
Aboriginal sites and areas of significance in case of undertaking exploration activities in certain 
circumstances  

• Key permits and licences to conduct mining operations at the site, as listed in Table 4-3.

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

Monument has a licence to take water, granted by the Minister under Section 5C of the Rights in Water 
and Irrigation Act 1914.  The licence permits Monument to extract up to 600,000 kL per annum from 
M51/116, M51/117, M51/252 and M51/177.

Extensions are still to be granted to the Dangerous Goods Storage licences and the Explosives 
Storage Licence.  It should be a formality to reapply for these licences to allow mining and processing 
to recommence, but contingencies with respect to these aspects should be considered in advance. 

 Environmental considerations 
In purchasing the Burnakura Property, Monument has inherited environmental liabilities associated 
with mining activities undertaken by previous owners.  In addition, current exploration activities 
represent disturbances that will be required to be rehabilitated in accordance with tenement conditions. 

Areas of disturbance for the Burnakura mining tenements are registered with the DMIRS (Environment 
Division).  Details of areas of disturbances recorded on the DMIRS's Environmental Assessment and 
Regulatory System (EARS) are listed in Table 4-4 by tenement.  The current total approved footprint 
for the Burnakura mining leases is 225.95 Ha.

The NOA 4 and NOA 6 open pits were utilised for tailings storage during previous milling operations 
conducted by Tectonic Resources NL.  These were backfilled, capped and rehabilitated between 2006 
and 2009 previous owners (Tectonic Resources NL and ATW Gold Corp).  Tectonic Resources NL 
was granted approval to utilise the Lewis and Reward open pits, located 3 km southwest of the 
Burnakura gold plant for future tailings storage.  Subsequently, ATW Gold Corp utilised the Lewis and 
Reward pits to dispose of tailings from milling of the NOA 2 underground mine between 2007 and 
2009. 



SRK Consulting Page 23 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

Upon purchasing the Burnakura Property, Kentor Gold utilised both the Reward and Lewis pits for 
tailings disposal during milling of material mined from the Lewis, Reward and Alliance open pit cut 
backs.  The Reward open pit is currently estimated to be at 80% capacity while the Lewis pit no longer 
contains any tailings.  Final storage capacity of both open pits will depend on consolidation rates of 
the current and future tailings.  Subsequent to the completion of mining by Kentor Gold, the Lewis and 
Reward pits were bunded and perimeter fencing was erected around the Reward pit.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography 
Mapleson et al., 2015's description for the accessibility, climate, local resources, infrastructure and 
physiography is largely unchanged and is listed in the following sections with minor updates by SRK 
as required. 

 Access 
Access to the Burnakura Property area is approximately 765 km north-northeast of Perth via the 
sealed Great Northern Highway and then via numerous unsealed private and shire-maintained roads.  
Access from the north is via the Nannine-Polelle Shire Road that departs Great Northern Highway 
about 29 km south of Meekatharra, then via the private haul road to the Burnakura gold processing 
plant, a total distance of about 26 km.  The haul road is in good condition and allows access in all 
weather conditions except for some of the very highest rainfall events. 

Alternatively, the project area may be accessed from the south through the Tuckanarra mining centre 
on the Great Northern Highway (approximately 38 km north of Cue) via the Culculli or Reedy road east 
to the Reedy Mining Centre, then via an old haul road to the Burnakura gold plant, a total distance of 
about 48 km. 

Access by four-wheel drive vehicle within the project area is via various mine infrastructure roads, 
previous exploration tracks and pastoral tracks (Figure 5-1).

 Climate and physiography 
The project area falls within a semi-desert Mediterranean climatic regime with mild winters and hot 
summers with most rain falling in the cooler months of April–September, although cyclonic systems 
can cause heavy falls in the summer months.  Rainfall is highly variable but averages between 
200--250 mm per annum and a maximum mean monthly rainfall of 56 mm in February.  Temperature 
ranges from a winter mean of 16° C to a summer mean of 38° C in the general region, although 
summer maxima in excess of 40° C are common.  Evaporation rates are high with an annual average 
of 3,563 mm.  Mining and exploration operations may be undertaken all year round, however may be 
interrupted by heavy or prolonged rainfall.

The Burnakura Property area is located within the Murchison bioregion, being characterised by low 
hills and mesas separated by flat colluvium and alluvial plains.  Within the project area, topography is 
gently undulating, ranging between about 500 and 520 m ASL.  Vegetation is typically composed of 
low mulga woodland (Acacia aneura) on broad flat colluvium plains and tree steppes of Eucalyptus 
and Triodia on sandy plains.  As a result of historical mining activities, some of the project area has 
been denuded of mulga.  The principal soil type is shallow earthy loam, colluvium and alluvium sheet 
wash overlying red-brown hardpan (Wiluna Hardpan).  Shallow stony loams occur on hills and red 
earth sands on sand plains. 

The project area lies within the upper Murchison River catchment on the eastern flank of Lake Annean.  
Locally, the drainage trends are to the west and north into Lake Annean.  The catchment area for the 
intermittent creek line that runs past the NOA underground mine in the northern portion of the project 
area is large, extending some 9.3 km to the south.  

High rainfall events in the catchment area that led to flooding of the unnamed ephemeral creek that 
flows in a north-easterly direction passing between the NOA 1 and NOA 2 open pits previously resulted 
in breaching of the pit bund walls and flooding of the pits and underground mine in 2005 (Harvey et al, 
2008). 

Tectonic Resources NL developed a revised surface water management scheme that addressed these 
issues in terms of safety for personnel in the case of flood level events similar to that experienced in 
the past.  Contingencies implemented after the flood event included the raising of the bund wall on the 
perimeter of the NOA 2 pit to 2 m while maintaining the bund wall of the NOA 1 pit at a height of 1 m.   

Harvey et al. (2008) were of the opinion that a flood event as experienced in the past would result in 
failure of the bund wall option to create a diversion upstream within the catchment of the creek.  
Discussions during a 2007 site visit revealed that the earthworks required would be minor to divert the 
stream into a neighbouring yet isolated catchment (Harvey et al., 2008).  No declared rare flora or any 
scheduled fauna have been identified over the Burnakura Property area (Woolard, 2008). 

 Local resources and infrastructure 
The majority of the Burnakura Property area lies within the municipal Shire of Cue (population 298; 
ABS 2013).  The northern portion of the project (mining lease M51/116) lies within the Shire of 
Meekatharra (population 1,521; ABS 2013).  The local economy in the region is dominated by gold, 
copper, nickel and iron ore mining operations and pastoral stations (cattle and sheep).  Mining 
operations are supported by a predominantly fly-in-fly-out (FIFO) workforce. 

Project infrastructure includes a 260,000 TPA CIL gold processing plant, diesel powered generators 
and a fuel storage facility, laboratory, workshops, administration offices, and a serviceable 118-person 
accommodation village.  This infrastructure is currently used to support all exploration activities over 
the mining tenements.  The majority of the Burnakura Property mine infrastructure is located on mining 
lease M51/116.  The mine accommodation village is located on mining lease M51/252. 

The project is serviced by the town of Meekatharra located approximately 55 km to the north by road.  
Meekatharra is serviced by regular road freight and commercial passenger air services from Perth. 

Groundwater up to 600,000 kL per annum is authorised for abstraction under Groundwater Well 
Licence.  Process plant water sources include the NOA1' NOA7/8 and New Alliance open pits.  Potable 
water is obtained using a reverse osmosis plant with the source water from a bore adjacent to the 
accommodation village.

6 History 
Mapleson et al. 2015's description of site history is largely unchanged and is listed in the following 
sections with minor updates as completed by SRK. 

 Prior ownership 
The Burnakura Property area and surrounding environs have a long gold mining history with 
underground operations commencing in 1897 at Alliance and Federal City areas.  The first discovery 
of gold in the district was made to the northwest at Nannine in 1890, prompting a gold rush in the area.  
In 1897, gold was discovered at Monument's Gabanintha Property located 20 km to the northeast.  
Gold at Reedy located about 45km to the west southwest of Burnakura was discovered in 1899. 

Since 1982, a total of seven mining companies have undertaken mineral exploration and gold mining 
operations over the Burnakura Property prior to being acquired by Monument in late February 2014. 

Metana Minerals NL originally pegged a large area of ground including part of the Burnakura Property 
as part of their Reedy Project.  Subsequent to a merger with Gold Mines of Australia (GMA) and other 
entities in 1994, open pit mining and exploration of the Burnakura property continued until 1997 
(Tectonic Resources NL, 2006).  Metana Minerals NL (Metana) and later GMA undertook substantial 
open pit mining in the period between 1989 and 1987. 

Following acquisition from the GMA administrators in 1988, St Barbara Mines Ltd (SBM) removed 
significant tonnage of previously stockpiled material between 2000 and 2003 that was treated at their 
Bluebird Mill (now Yaloginda) south of Meekatharra (Woolard, 2008).  In late August 2003, SBM 
entered into a joint venture with Coronet Resources Ltd, whereby Coronet could earn up to 70% in the 
Burnakura project by spending $2M. 

In July 2003, Extract Resources Ltd (Extract) entered into a Joint Venture with St Barbara to explore 
and develop the NOA 2 deposit, later buying St Barbara's remaining interest in the project in 2004.  In 
the same year, Extract and Tectonic Resources NL (Tectonic) entered into a joint venture (the 
Burnakura JV), whereby Tectonic subsequently acquired a 30% interest in the Burnakura mining 
tenements and a 50% interest in the NOA 2 mine.  Tectonic acted as managers of the Burnakura JV 
and operated the NOA 2 mine between 2005 and 2007.  The present Burnakura gold plant was 
commissioned by Tectonic in in November 2005. 

ATW Gold Corp (TSX-V: ATW) acquired the Burnakura property in late December 2007 and resumed 
mining of the NOA 2 underground mine in March 2009.  The mine was subsequently placed on care 
and maintenance in November 2009.  Jinka Minerals Ltd (Jinka Minerals) acquired the property from 
ATW in June 2010, and Kentor Gold Ltd (Kentor Gold) acquired the Burnakura Property subsequent 
to a friendly acquisition of Jinka Minerals.  Kentor Gold recommenced mining operations of the NOA 2 
underground and a number of historical open pits in August 2012.  Kentor Gold also took up additional 
ground (current exploration and prospecting licences).  Production ceased in late April 2013, when the 
operation was placed in care and maintenance.  Monument acquired all of Kentor Gold's interests in 
the project on 21 February 2014 (see Monument's press release #14-2014, dated 25 February 2014). 

 Production history 
According to de la Hunty (1970), the major historical production from Burnakura from 1898–1916 
amounted to 42,545 t for 32,231 ozs at an average grade of 26 g/t Au (Table 6-1).  The majority of this 
production was from the New Alliance, Alliance and Federal City underground workings.  This is 
supported by the figures compiled by Tectonic (Armstrong, 2006). 



SRK Consulting Page 28 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

Production prior to the commissioning of the Burnakura gold processing plant in 2005 from the 13 
producing pits and two underground operations amounted to 1.8 Mt at 3.7 g/t Au for a total of 
216,000 ozs Au (Harvey et al., 2008).  All mine production prior to the commissioning of the Burnakura 
gold plant by Tectonic in 2005 was processed at the Reedy gold plant up to 1997 and later the Bluebird 
gold plant at Meekatharra. 

Between 1989–1997, Metana Minerals and later GMA trucked ore from a total of open pits to their 
Reedy gold processing plant.  Subsequent operators St Barbara trucked low grade material stockpiled 
by GMA to their Bluebird gold plant at Meekatharra (Table 6-1).

7 Geological Setting and Mineralisation 
 Regional Geology 

The Burnakura gold project covers an area on the eastern margin of the Archean 
Meekatharra-Wydgee greenstone belt within the north-eastern Murchison Domain of the Yilgarn 
Craton (Van Kranendonk and Ivanic, 2009).  The Murchison Domain forms part of the Youanmi 
Terrane.  Limited geochronology shows that most greenstones and granitic rocks of the Murchison 
Domain were deposited or emplaced between 3.0 Ga and 2.6 Ga.   

Recent (2017) re-mapping at 100,000 scale, geochemistry and geochronology undertaken as part of 
the Geological Survey of Western Australia's (GSWA) regional mapping program has resulted in the 
development of a new lithostratigraphic scheme of the Murchison Domain.  The regional geology of 
the Burnakura Property area within this new framework is presented in Figure 7-1.

Domain

The majority of greenstones within the Meekatharra-Wydgee belt have been stratigraphically placed 
within the Polelle Group and the Norrie Group of the Murchison Supergroup (Van Kranendonk et al., 
2013).  The Polelle Group conformably overlies the basal Norrie Group and contains tholeiitic basalt, 
komatiitic basalt, komatiite and thin interflow felsic volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks of the basal 
Meekatharra Formation, andesitic to rhyolitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the conformably 
overlying Greensleeves Formation, and conformably overlying banded iron formation (BIF) and felsic 
volcaniclastic rocks of the upper Wilgie Mia Formation.  The basal Norrie group comprises a thick 
succession of pillowed and massive tholeiitic basalts of the Murrouli Basalt and conformably overlying

felsic volcaniclastics with interbedded BIF and felsic volcanic rocks of the Yaloginda Formation, seen 
at Figure 7-2. 

 

Figure 7-2: Stratigraphy of the north-eastern Murchison Domain after Van Kranendonk 
and Ivanic (2009)  

The main structural deformation events are described by Watkins & Hickmamn (1990) with five 
deformational events recorded in the Murchison Domain.  Horizontal tectonic movement during the D1 
event involved recumbent folding and thrusting as well as the intrusion of the monzogranite along the 
Polelle Group.  The D2 phase of deformation produced tight, upright folds with east-trending fold axes 
including the Polelle Syncline (Van Kranendonk, 2008).  This event deformed the entire Murchison 
Supergroup including the pegmatite banded gneiss and the pre-D1 recrystallised monzogranite.   

An overprinting of a more intense D3 event is represented by tight isoclinal upright folds with NNE to 
NNW trending fold axes that developed in response to east-west compression.  A strong penetrative 
foliation (S3) formed during D3 is well-preserved and defines the dominant fabric throughout the 
Murchison Domain. 



SRK Consulting Page 33 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

Development of large-scale D4 shear zones formed in response to a progressive increase in strain 
through the D3 event associated with an approximate east-west compression.  These developed an 
extensive NW-SE to NE-SW, trending an anastomosing shear zone system with a dominant NNE 
trend characterised by dextral, crustal scale structures with many extending greater than 100 km and 
up to 1 km wide (Watkins and Hickman, 1990).  The north to NNW trending structures are typically not 
as extensive and accommodated variable displacement trajectories, including sinistral (Watkins and 
Hickman, 1990).   

Peak regional metamorphism was contemporaneous with D4 constrained between D3 folding and the 
emplacement of post folding granitoids at 2941 Ma (Watkins and Hickman, 1990).  The majority of D4 
deformation occurred under greenschist facies conditions. 

Post-folding granitoids are contemporaneous with D4 and were probably localised by these structures.  
The final event (D5) of east to SE trending shear zones and faults occurred in the north-western part 
of the Murchison Domain. 

 Local Geology 
The majority of the Burnakura gold project covers Archaean basement rocks assigned to the 
2815--2805 Ma basal Norrie Group of the Murchison Supergroup, covering the eastern margin of the 
Meekatharra-Wydgee greenstone belt.  The Norrie group comprises a thick succession of pillowed 
and massive tholeiitic basalts of the Murrouli Basalt, and conformably overlying felsic volcaniclastics 
with interbedded BIF and felsic volcanic rocks of the Yaloginda Formation (Van Kranendonk et al, 
2013).  On the southeastern limb of the Pollele Syncline a Ti-rich, Al-depleted komatiite and komatiitic 
volaniclastic rocks occur as part of the Norrie Group (Van Kranendonk et al, 2013).

The Burnakura gold deposits are situated along a northeast trending splay (Burnakura Shear Zone) 
that parallels and is linked to the north-northeast trending regional scale Mt Magnet fault.  The 
Mt Magnet fault is the major east bounding structure to the 'Meekatharra structural zone', a major 
regional, northeast-trending shear dominated zone, about 50 to 60 km wide, incorporating the 
Meekatharra area and extending through the Cue region as far south as Mount Magnet (Spaggiari, 



SRK Consulting Page 35 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

2006), as shown in Figure 7-3.  The Meekatharra structural zone is dominated by north- and northeast-
trending folds and shears, including refolded folds with approximately coplanar fold axes.  Many of the 
folds are truncated by shears or faults, and the structural zone is interpreted as a major zone of shear-
related deformation.   

A regional scale structural interpretation of the Burnakura and Gabanintha areas was completed in 
2012 by Warwick Crowe for Kentor Gold.  The interpretation further advanced the structural 
interpretations completed by Roger Marjoribanks on the NOA and Alliance deposits for Tectonic 
Resources between 2004–2006.   

Burnakura Gold deposits have formed within a number of distinct lithostructural settings, all of which 
are considered to have developed in a regional dextral deformational setting (Crowe, 2012). 

A regolith of extensive sheet wash cover largely obscures weathered Archaean basement rocks that 
host the Burnakura gold project.  Sheet wash cover is variable in thickness over the Burnakura area 
from a few metres up to more than 20 m.  Weathering generally persists to a depth of around 40 m 
(coinciding with the regional water table), although preferential oxidation along mineralised basement 
structures persists to far greater depths.

 NOA deposits 
The NOA deposits (also known as North of Alliance) are comprised of the NOA 1 to 8 deposits 
numbered south to north as shown in Figure 7-4.  The main deposits are NOA 2 and NOA 7, with 
underground operations undertaken at NOA 2 and major open pit mining on NOA 7.  The NOA deposits 
are located in a flat sheet wash area and underlain by acid to intermediate volcanic rocks and 
associated sediments within mafic and ultramafic intrusives and volcanics.  Five of the six known gold 
concentrations in this area (NOA 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8) are co-linear within a northerly trending dilationary 
structure that splays northwards from the Burnakura Fault and which have been traced over a distance 
of 1600 m.   

The NOA 1 deposit is offset some 200 m to the east along a different but related structure.  The ore 
zones are identified by quartz stockwork veining that is bound by silica altered wall rocks. 

The NOA 2 gold mineralisation lies within a regional thrust zone called Burnakura Thrust Zone (BTZ) 
that strikes north-south and dips at 30°–60° to the east.  The thrust zone is a regional structure, and 
elements of the structure are present in all the deposits of the NOA-Alliance line.  The thrust zone cuts 
through a dolerite sill which is interpreted as having intruded along a sequence of felsic pyroclastics 
flows and associated sedimentary rock sequences (refer Figure 7-5).  The BTZ is the dominant feature 
of the NOA 2 deposit, constraining and controlling the economic gold mineralisation defined at depth.  
The highly deformed package of rocks contained within the BTZ is locally known as the mine 
sequence.  The original lithologies are dominated by altered mafic with minor fine grained felsic rocks.

The NOA 4 & 6 deposits are within the BTZ have variable dips and widths.  It may also split into more 
than one branch.  The immediate host rocks to the mineralised shear zone are also variable within 
dolerite, silty sediments and felsic volcanic units (Marjoribanks, 2005, Figure 7-6).

NOA 7 and 8 are the northernmost pit and contain a mineralised zone over a strike length of 560 m.  
The zones strike 40º and dips 50º to the east.  Pit depth is down to 61 m.  Mineralisation is open along 
strike to the north and south as well as open down dip.  The structural setting for the gold mineralisation 
is interpreted to be similar to that of the NOA 2 deposit, in that the mineralisation appears to be 
confined to the BTZ.  The host lithologies are predominantly sedimentary and felsic volcanoclastic 
units.  The footwall of the mineralised zones changes from felsic volcanoclastics below NOA 7 in the 
south, to an ultramafic lithology in the north below NOA 8. 

 Alliance and New Alliance (ANA) deposits 
The geology within the Alliance open pit consists of a low grade meta-volcano-sedimentary succession 
comprising an interlayered sequence of felsic volcanics and banded iron formation (BIF).  The pit is 



SRK Consulting Page 40 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

located along a moderate (~40°) east dipping, north-south trending eastern limb of a fold.  The hinge 
zone of this fold is exposed in the north face of the pit.   

Previous mapping by Marjoribanks (2004) identified three BIF horizons within the sequence with the 
two lower units associated with quartz veining and associated gold mineralization (Figure 7-7).  
Subsequent mapping undertaken by Crowe (2012) in the pit provides a modified geological 
interpretation.  The main difference is that the later model interprets two BIF horizons (a lower and 
upper) as opposed to three proposed by Marjoribanks (2004).  

The BIF units are each around 1–3m thick and are spaced around 15–20 m apart.  The BIF comprises 
strongly bedded hematite and chert layers.  The chert layers are commonly a distinct bright-red 
jasperlite.  The top surface of each BIF horizon is markedly planar and defined by a strong foliation.  
This contrasts with the lower surface of the BIF units that are typically strongly folded.  Axial planes of 
folds flatten and rotate into parallelism with the top surface of the BIF.  This is explained as the result 
of shearing along the top surface of each BIF.  Shearing was initiated at the same time as the folding 
and was located along this contact by the extreme ductility contrast between the BIF and enclosing 
rocks. 

Bedding strikes north to northeast and dips east at 25° to 50°.  Bedding is folded at all scales by a set 
of open to moderately tight, sinistral folds that plunge NNE at around 30º.  A well-developed, 
penetrative, axial-plane cleavage to these folds can be identified in almost all rocks in the pit.  The 
cleavage strikes NNE and dips at 75°–80° to the ESE. 

An intrusive mafic unit is present along the upper benches of the west wall.  This unit is a massive red-
brown-purple coloured rock being oxidised.  Minor steep dipping, east trending, 50–100cm thick felsic 
dykes intrude the felsic volcanics and BIF on the west central wall of the pit. 

There are a series of steep, south dipping faults that trend east–west, with local subsidiary splays 
trending northeast–southwest.  The distribution and geometry of the BIF units on either side of this 
fault zone are consistent with a predominant normal dip-slip displacement and possibly a small 
component of dextral accommodation.  The changing orientation of BIF A unit in the south as it 
transects the western pit wall suggests the anticline axis is proximal to the southern western pit wall 
(Figure 7-7).  This is also supported by the apparent increasing limb separation between BIF's A and 
B in the northern section of the pit indicative of a thickening hinge zone (Figure 7-7).

The structural data collected by Crowe (2012) through the Alliance Pit define a coherent fold structure 
across the late faulting.  These data are consistent with a shallow plunging north trending normal to 
inclined fold.  The limited foliation data suggests the axial plane is near vertical and trend north–south, 
defining a normal plunging fold.  However, this is inconsistent with the northeast plunging fold axis 
which is well defined by the distribution of the BIF bedding data.  A more optimal axial plane orientation 
maybe more inclined and trend NNE-SSW, Figure 7-7. 

Gold mineralisation at Alliance is associated with north-trending, shallow east dipping (25–50°) zones 
of thin quartz veining.  The veins are conformable with bedding, and usually occur along, or proximal 
to, the upper and lower contacts of the BIF units.  It is postulated that the location of gold mineralisation 
was directed by the extreme ductility contrast between the BIF units and surrounding tuffaceous 
sediments. 

The following description of Alliance ore is provided by Marjoribanks (2004), and refers to remnant 
quartz veining of Lode 2 observed in the southern pit wall: 'The vein is composed of massive white 
quartz up to 1 m thick.  In places, the quartz is brecciated and has been re-cemented with later silica.  
A laminar banding defined by pale grey- dark grey quartz is also present.  The upper 50–100 cm of

BIF adjacent to the main vein is cut by numerous, irregular thin quartz veinlets.  Abundant limonite, as 
blebs and zones with box-work after pyrite, is associated with these veinlets, and indicates sulphidation 
of the iron formation from fluids derived from the vein fractures.' 

At New Alliance, the NNE-striking BIF horizons dip at 35–45° to the east and are hosted by felsic 
volcanoclastics and pillow basalts.  The New Alliance pit is 375 m long with a maximum depth of 85 m 
at its northern end.  Gold mineralisation at Alliance and New Alliance has been defined over a 1,150 m 
strike length. 

 Federal City  
At Federal City, gold mineralisation is associated with quartz veining at or near the contact between 
an ultramafic and a basaltic unit.  The ore structure strikes northwest and dips to the northeast at 
30--40°.  Low grade mineralisation appears to exist below the pit floor and is open at depth.  The 
Banderol deposit is located in a sequence of talc-carbonate altered ultramafic rocks which are in turn 
overprinted by potassic alteration with associated quartz veining.  The orebody strikes in a north–south 
direction and dips at 30° to the east.  Mineralisation appears to be open along strike to the north 
(Harvey et al, 2008). 

 Authaal 
Gold mineralisation at the Authaal and Authaal North pits occur along a northeast–southwest trending 
direction and dip towards the west.  Mineralisation is hosted by oxidised mafic and ultramafic rocks 
with associated quartz veining.  At Authaal North, quartz veining does not appear to be an indicator of 
gold mineralisation.  Mineralisation occurs below the pits, although it appears to be erratic in extent.  
A second structural feature is evident in the pit wall striking to the west (Harvey et al, 2008). 

 Gold mineralisation 
Known gold deposits within the Murchison Domain appear to be particularly abundant and spatially 
located within the Meekatharra structural zone.  According to Van Kranendonk et al. (2013), field 
mapping and geochronology undertaken as part of the Geological Survey of WA's Murchison regional 
mapping program indicates that D4 structures formed at or soon after emplacement of 2660 Ma 
granites and continued during gold mineralisation.  

Gold mineralisation is thought to have extended for at least 30 Ma from 2,660 to 2,630 Ma during 
predominantly strike-slip D4 shearing.  Significantly, the peak of granitic magmatism at 2,660 Ma is 
coincident with the onset of major gold mineralisation, suggesting a cogenetic relationship through 
magma- and heat-driven remobilisation of mineralization originally hosted by older volcanic rocks.  
Gold deposition has been precisely dated at 2,639±4 Ma in the South Emu deposit at the Reedy mining 
centre, ~20 kilometres southwest of Burnakura. 

The BTZ mineralisation is typical of a brittle to semi-ductile shear zone forming semi-continuous 
dilational veins.  A mineralised horizon may extend >100 m, but the thickness and the tenor of 
mineralisation within these horizons is highly variable and discontinuous.  The thickness may vary by 
±100% on the 5–10 m scale (Marjoribanks, 2005 & 2006). 

The NOA mineralisation is associated with the NOA fault and NOA splays.  The mineralisation is 
dominated by steep dipping quartz (±minor sulphides) veins orientated parallel to the foliation of the 
fault zone.  Minor sulphides are present and little alteration of the host lithology is also observed.  The 
gold mineralisation is low grade (i.e. <1.5 g/t) and sporadic, but within the BTZ moderate grades have 
been recorded ranging from ~3 to 4 g/t.

The ANA prospects, the rheological contrast between the BIFs and the tuffs, have likely played an 
important role as an additional geological control to create a favourable environment for veining and 
gold mineralisation.

8 Deposit Types 
Based on classification from Watson and Hickman (1990), there are three main types of epigenetic 
gold deposit which can be recognised in the Murchison Domain: 

• Basalt-hosted and, less commonly, dolerite-hosted quartz vein deposits 

• Ultramafic schist-hosted, and less commonly mafic schist-hosted, shear zone deposits 

• BIF-hosted and chert-hosted deposits. 

These epigenetic gold deposits have been described by Groves et al (1993) as mesothermal or 
orogenic shear hosted gold deposits.  

Additionally in the Burnakura gold project area, lateritic-hosted gold is found at Tuckabianna and 
Reedy.  Laterite-hosted gold deposits occur within 1 km of Archaean epigenetic deposits.  Lateral 
transport of gold has been minimal and some of the deposits are partly residual.  Gold enrichment 
zones in laterite profiles are largely the result of precipitation at water-table redox barriers (Watson 
and Hickman, 1990). 

 Mesothermal/ orogenic shear hosted gold deposits 
Mesothermal (or orogenic) gold deposits worldwide, irrespective of age, have a number of common 
features.  They are normally formed in convergent-margin settings, under compressive or 
transpressional stress regimes, from deep (metamorphic) low-salinty H2O-CO2+/-CH4 ore fluids that 
move into zones of structural permeability within volcanic (e.g. greenstone) or sedimentary (e.g. slate) 
belts (Yeats and Vanderhor, 1998).   

In Archaean greenstone belts, there is a crustal continuum of mesothermal lode-gold deposits which 
formed under conditions ranging from about 180°C at 2-5 km depth to >650°C and >15 km depth 
(Groves, 1993, Yeats and Vanderhor, 1998, Groves et al 1993).  They are a coherent genetic group 
on the basis of: 

1. A metal association of Au>Ag, associated with As+/-Te+/-Sb+/-W+/-B, and low Cu, Zb Zn 

2. Deposition from a consistently low salinity, near neutral H2O-CO2+/-CH4 ore fluid  

3. Consistent wallrock alteration envelopes involving addition of CO2, S, K and other LILE  

4. Their extensive vertical extent, with only cryptic vertical alteration zonation but marked lateral 
alteration zonation 

5. Their strong structural control.

deposits in terms of depth of formation and structural setting within a

Lode gold deposits are generally high-grade, thin, vein and fault-hosted.  They are primarily made up 
of quartz veins also known as lodes or reefs, which contain either native gold or gold sulfides and 
tellurides.  Lode-gold deposits are intimately associated with orogeny and other plate collision events 
within their geologic history, as shown in Figure 8-1 and Figure 8-2.

rocks and metamorphic settings

 Laterite-hosted gold deposits 
The Archaean cratons of WA have been subjected to prolonged weathering, resulting in the 
development of a complex regolith.  In-situ weathering of basement rocks produces a weathering 
profile typified from bottom to top by saprock, saprolite, clay and/ or mottled clay zones, and 
ferruginous duricrusts.

Figure 8-3:  Lateritic gold deposit (Callion, WA) showing gold dispersion and enrichment 
Source: Butt, 1998 

The characteristics of laterite gold deposits are shown in Figure 8-3 and summarised by Butt (1998) 
as the following: 

• Flat-lying zone of enrichment, contiguous with the ferruginous and mottled zones of the laterite 
profile  

• Mostly at the surface or buried by shallow (<20m) sediments  

• Commonly thin (2–10m)  

• Characterised by ferruginous pisolitic gravels, nodules and duricrust  

• Fine-grained Au of high fineness (Ag <0.5%) and some residual primary Au  

• Particles of coarse Au may be present as primary nuggets and inclusions in vein quartz and 
pisoliths, and as secondary crystals developed with Fe oxide segregations.  

Widespread multi-element geochemical anomalies (Au+/- As+/-Sb+/-W) in the lateritic residuum are 
often an important exploration vector, often being much larger (100–400 times broader) than the 
primary source.  They are formed by dilute groundwater in the vadose zone, gold probably mobilised 
by organically derived ligands and precipitated by dilution, reduction by Fe2+ oxidation (Butt, 1998).

9 Exploration 
 Aerial photography 

Fugro Spatial Solutions Pty Ltd (Fugro) of Perth was commissioned to complete a fixed wing aerial 
photography survey.  The survey was flown on 17 September 2014.  The survey covered the main 
Burnakura mining leases (M51/116, M51/117, M51/177, M51/ 178, M51/252, M51/478), as well as the 
main gazetted access roads and private haul roads (L51/78, L51/79 and L51/81) a total area of 59 km2. 

The survey and all associated data were registered with the DMP (Registration No. 70979) on the 
MAGIX airborne geophysical index (MAGIX ID. 4190).  Ortho-imagery and SGM products were 
delivered by Fugro in various digital file formats including ECW, MapInfo TAB, CSV.  Derived datasets 
included digital imagery at 12 cm pixel resolution and a DEM gridded at 5m x/y. 

 Geophysical data 
UTS Geophysics undertook an airborne geophysical survey for magnetics, radiometrics and digital 
elevation in 2008.  The survey was conducted with 40 m line spacing and covered an area of 162 km2 

encompassing the Burnakura mine leases.  

Fugro Airborne Surveys completed an airborne geophysical survey for magnetics, radiometrics and 
digital elevation in 2004.  The survey was conducted with 400 m line spacing and covered an area of 
55,400 km2 for Geoscience Australia, covering the Cue and Kirkalocka areas. 

SkyTEM Australia conducted an aerial electromagnetic survey for the Department of Water WA with 
4000 m line spacing in 2015. 

All geophysical data are available from the DMP website for download as required. 

 Structural Interpretations 
Several structural interpretations have been completed within the Burnakura gold project by different 
consultants with the use of the GSWA geophysical datasets and included site visits to specific sites.  
Interpretations have been conducted by Crowe (2012) (Figure 9-1), Marjoribanks (2004, 2005, 2006) 
(Figure 7-5, Figure 7-6) and Baxter (1993).  Results from the structural interpretations have been 
included in the mineralisation domaining at the prospects.

10 Drilling 
Drilling within the Burnakura gold project has been undertaken by numerous mining and exploration 
companies since 1987 though to 2017.  All data utilised within this review has been taken from the 
Monument supplied Microsoft Access database, MurchisonExport_8Dec2016.mdb (Master database) 
and burnakura_2014019.mdb (Authaal database).  The Authaal database was used only for the 
Authaal resource estimation as this was compiled for previous estimates. 

Within the Master database, the main companies which have completed drilling are ATW Venture 
Group, Kentor Gold, Gold Mines of Australia and Monument.  Drilling completed by Tectonic 
Resources, Homestake, Metana and St Barbara Mines Ltd has not been attributed within the Drill Hole 
collar table of the database supplied.  Within the Authaal database, drilling has been completed from 
1990–2012 with companies identified as Kentor Gold, Metana and Gold Mines of Australia. 

In the Master database, there are several tables as a compilation of all drilling information within the 
Burnakura, Gabanintha and Tuckanarra projects.  Drill hole information on collar location, down hole 
survey, geology, mineralisation, core recovery, assays, QA/ QC and structural data have been collated 
from historical databases and original logs by Monument and previous operators of the project. 

A summary of the drill holes used from the Master database for Alliance, New Alliance, NOA 1–8, and 
Federal City is indicated in Table 10-1 and Table 10-2.

Note: 'Other' hole types include aircore (AC), rotary airblast (RAB), underground sludge holes, 
underground face samples, grade control and blast holes.  These holes have not been utilised within 
the resource estimation process except to assist in mineralisation domain definition. 

RC sampling was completed using reputable drilling contractors with industry standard drilling 
equipment for the time, containing appropriately sized compressors suitable for keeping drill holes 
clean and dry at appropriate depths. Sample splitting techniques are appropriately completed using 
three tier riffle and cone type splitters with globally appropriate sample recoveries recorded.  

DDH was also completed using reputable drilling contractors with industry standard drilling equipment 
with globally appropriate recoveries recorded for the core size used.

been recorded within the database or has been assumed from planned hole information.  

Drill hole collars have been located in the original coordinate system and have been transformed to 
MGA94 Zone 50.  Several deposits/ pits have had historical local coordinate systems that have been 
transformed to MGA94 Zone 50 by previous operators.  All recent Monument drilling is located using 
a handheld GPS and then resurveyed using an RTKDGPS in MGA94 Zone 50 UTM format.  

Drilling information for the Authaal database has been compiled into tables including collar, survey, 
geology and assay.  Drill hole location is in MGA94 Zone 50 coordinates with down hole survey

11 Sampling Preparation, Analyses and Security 
For the Burnakura Gold Project encompassing the NOA, ANA, Federal City and Authaal deposits there 
have been various exploration companies that have collected data and that have been utilised in the 
geological models and resource estimation by SRK.  The different methods employed in sample 
preparation and analyses are summarised and discussed below.  

Monument provided SRK with a Microsoft access database, MurchisonExport_8Dec2016.mbd, that 
included numerous other deposits and prospects not included in this review such as Lewis, 
Gabanintha, and Tuckanarra.  For the Authaal drilling information the Microsoft access database, 
burnakura_2014019.mdb was supplied to SRK. 

 Sample Preparation and Analytical Techniques 

 Homestake and Metana (1987–1989) 
Homestake's drilling was conducted as part of a joint venture with Metana and samples were routinely 
assayed at Metana's Perth laboratory.  Samples were reportedly generally split to 250–300 grams for 
pulverisation and analysis, with the exception of quartz-rich samples identified as coming from main 
ore zones, which were entirely pulverised.  Assaying was generally by aqua-regia digest with every 
tenth sample and samples reporting aqua-regia gold grades above approximately 1.0 g/t repeated by 
one more fire assays. 

Homestake's hard copy sampling records include QA/QC information such as standards, field 
duplicates, blanks and repeat assays.  This data is not present in the database supplied and was not 
reviewed. 

 Gold Mines of Australia (GMA) (1991–1998) 
Reverse Calculation (RC) samples were collected over metre intervals and commonly composited to 
4 m with a scoop for initial assaying.  Mineralised composites were predominantly re-assayed over 
metre intervals.  Diamond core was halved with a diamond saw and generally sampled over 0.5 or 
1.0 m intervals with shorter samples at geological contacts. 

For initial program, 1991–1995, GMA's drilling, samples were assayed at GMA's laboratory in Perth.  
After oven drying, RC samples were split to 500 g before pulverisation in a ring mill with a 25 g aliquot 
analysed by aqua-regia digestion.  Samples reporting gold grades of greater than 2.0 g/t were 
repeated by 50 g fire-assaying of a second coarse reject split.  Diamond core samples were dried, jaw 
crushed and pulverised in entirety before analysis by 50 g fire assay. 

Samples from 1996–1998 were analysed at either Genalysis or Analabs in Perth.  At both laboratories, 
RC samples were dried and pulverised and a 30 g aliquot of pulverised sample was digested in aqua-
regia, the solution taken up in a ketone solvent and aspirated into a flame atomic absorption 
spectrophotometer.  The level of detection for gold by this method was 0.01 ppm for Genalysis and 
0.02 ppm for Analabs. 

Coarse rejects from RC samples that returned gold values greater than 1.0 ppm, and all core samples 
were pulverised and a 50 g aliquot of pulverised sample was subject to fire assay by lead collection.  
This was then analysed for gold by solvent extraction and flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry.  
The level of detection for gold by this method was 0.01 ppm for both Analabs and Genalysis. 



SRK Consulting Page 52 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

 St Barbara Mines Ltd (2000–2001) 
RC drill samples from the St Barbara drilling campaigns were submitted predominantly to Australian 
Laboratory Services (ALS) in Wangara.  Some samples from the earliest drilling by St Barbara were 
submitted to Amdel Laboratories in Wangara.   

Samples were pulverised and a 30 g aliquot of pulverised sample was subject to fire assay by lead 
collection and then analysed for gold by solvent extraction and flame atomic absorption 
spectrophotometry.  The level of detection for gold by this method was 0.01 ppm for both Amdel and 
ALS. 

Resamples of GMA diamond core collected by St Barbara were submitted to Amdel and analysed by 
the same method.  A total of 342 diamond core samples were submitted. 

Most of the pulps and rejects from the RC drilling and core resampling by St Barbara have suffered 
deterioration as a result of exposure to weather on-site, and unprotected storage.  The pulps and 
rejects from RC drilling completed during the most recent campaign in 2002 are stored at ALS in 
Wangara. 

 Tectonic Resources NL (2002–2006)  
Tectonic surface RC drilling samples were assayed at SGS in Welshpool.  Samples were pulverised 
and a 50 g aliquot of pulverised sample was subject to fire assay by lead collection and then analysed 
for gold by solvent extraction and flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry.  The level of detection 
for gold by this method was 0.01 ppm.   

Underground sampling data (sludge and channel sampling) was assayed at SGS Mount Magnet using 
50 g fire assay, identical as Tectonic RC drilling assay methodology, from June 2005 through to March 
2006. 

During underground mining of NOA 2 (2002–2006), an onsite laboratory was established with nearly 
all underground samples assayed using an aqua-regia digest, with assay of a 25 g charge on a Spectra 
50 AAS machine. 

 ATW Venture Corp (2008) 
ATW used Genalysis Laboratory Services of Maddington, WA to assay for gold samples generated 
from its RC drilling program.  Samples were dried, pulverised to <75μ for 85% and then a 50 g aliquot 
was taken for fire assay with an atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) finish.  Detection limit 
was 0.01 ppm gold. 

 Kentor Gold (2011–2012) 
Kentor Gold samples were submitted to ALS in Perth.  The samples were prepared by pulverising the 
entire sample to 85% passing 75μm or better for sample up to 3 kg.  Analysis for gold was by fire 
assay on a nominal 30 g sample aliquot with an AAS finish and detection limit range of 0.01g/t to 
100g/t Au. 

 Monument Mining Limited (2014–2017) 
All RC samples have been analysed by SGS mineral laboratory in Perth for routine Au analysis.  
Sample preparation by SGS comprised sorting and reconciliation, weighing, oven drying to 115°C, 
pulverising to nominal 90% passing –75µm with an LM-5 employing a Cr-steel bowl and then rotary 
splitting of an approximate 200 g analytical pulp.  The unsplit bulk wet samples were oven dried to 
105°C and riffle split down to <3.5 kg prior to undergoing pulverising.  Barren quartz flushes of the 
LM-5 pulveriser was performed at the start and end of each batch of samples. 



SRK Consulting Page 53 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

Analysis for Au was by fire assay using a 50 g charge.  Fire assaying employed standard fusion of 
sample with flux and lead collector in a furnace at 1,000°C, followed by cupellation.  The prill was 
digested by aqua-regia and analysed by AAS.  Assay results were reported to a 0.01 ppm Au lower 
detection level. 

Monument's diamond core was sent to ALS AMMTEC in Perth for analysis.  Drill core was sent whole 
to the lab and samples cut by ALS with sample preparation completed for assay and reserve for 
metallurgical testwork.  Samples were crushed and pulverised to 80% passing <75um, with the assays 
reported as shown in Table 11-1.

 Sample QAQC/ Precision 
The Master database, MurchisonExport_8Dec2016.mdb, provided by Monument has two tables with 
data for the QA/QC of the drilling results for submitted standard, field duplicates, pulp umpires, and 
laboratory checks.  The tables named DHAssaysQC and StandardsAssays encompass all the projects 
within the Monument tenement package.  The data presented here focuses on the NOA, Alliance, 
Authaal and Federal City deposits.  No QAQC data are recorded within the Authaal database, 
burnakura_2014019.mdb.

Overall, the QAQC completed within the project has been completed to a standard relevant at the time 
of each drilling program.  Apart from Authaal, QAQC samples were submitted for all deposits with a 
spread of duplicates, standards, pulp umpires and blanks.  

 Standards 
In total, there are 50 different standards that have been used by various companies during exploration 
and mining phases within the Burnakura gold project.  The standards have been used in various 
phases for AC, RC and DD programs, and for grade control during underground mining of NOA 2.  
The standards used have a range of grades and providers with the majority of the standards being 
sourced from Geostats Pty Ltd in Perth, WA.  A small number of standards are either in house 
company or laboratory standards that reference data is not currently available for and thus has not 
been reviewed by SRK.  The current dataset with standards number 4,072 submitted with the majority 
lying within acceptable tolerances.

As an overview, several standards are shown in Figure 11-1 to Figure 11-7 with expected values and 
returned values for a range of grades from the global database.  The standards samples showed 
generally acceptable behaviour, but there were some samples with grades much lower or higher than 
expected.  This can occur due to sample swaps, incorrect sample numbering and a lack of sampling 
protocol.  A low bias was evident for some of the standards.  The blanks showed good results with low 
bias and only a few spikes in the data that may be from contamination in the laboratory or on site.

 Duplicates 
Duplicate samples within the database are field duplicates, re-splits, laboratory checks, screen fire 
checks and pulp umpire checks.  The use of duplicates and check samples within the database allows 
the Qualified Person to assess the quality and accuracy of the analysis of the sample and assists in 
the confidence of the resource estimate. 

There are a significant number of duplicates for the NOA, Alliance and Federal City deposits which 
are shown separately in Figure 11-8 to Figure 11-10.  

The NOA deposit includes the historical exploration and recent underground mine activity completed 
by Tectonic Resources.  The Q-Q plot indicates a good correlation between the original and duplicate 
samples, with Pearson and Spearman correlations coefficients of 0.998 and 0.967 respectively.  The 
Ranked Half Absolute Relative Difference (HARD) plot indicates that 67% of the samples have a <20% 
relative difference.  



SRK Consulting Page 59 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

The Federal City deposit includes the historical exploration samples from RC drilling in 2014–2015.  
The Q-Q plot indicates a reasonable correlation between the original and duplicate samples, with 
Pearson and Spearman correlations coefficients of 0.985 and 0.880 respectively.  The Ranked Half 
Absolute Relative Difference (HARD) plot indicates that 77% of the samples have a <20% relative 
difference.  

The ANA deposit includes the historical exploration from RC drilling in 2014–2015.  The Q-Q plot 
indicates a reasonable correlation between the original and duplicate samples with Pearson and 
Spearman correlations coefficients of 0.991 and 0.792 respectively.  The Ranked Half Absolute 
Relative Difference (HARD) plot indicates that 62% of the samples have a <20% relative difference.

 Sample security 
Due to the historical nature of the majority of the drilling data and samples utilised within this study, 
SRK has reviewed available documentation on the sample security undertaken by previous companies 
before MMY and that undertaken by MMY.  

The chain of custody was appropriate with samples taken using appropriate equipment that was 
appropriately numbered and documented/ referenced.  The sampling was generally overseen by a 
technician or geologist who was appropriately skilled and trained. 

SRK notes the presence of an advanced sample preparation facility on site with appropriate manual 
handling provisions.  Samples submitted to the laboratory were generally appropriately secured in tied 
plastic bags then placed in drums and pallets that were numbered.  Limited lag time is generally noted 
in the database from sample collection to submission to the laboratory. 

SRK considers that the chain of custody is appropriate and that sample security has been 
appropriately considered by all owners completing data collection. 

 Summary of Adequacy of Data Collection Procedures 
The Qualified Person considers that on review of all the available data and analysis of the results of 
interpretation of the data verification in the preceding sections that the data is of sufficient adequacy 
in the areas of sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures that it can be used in resource 
estimation studies and that mineral resource classifications can be confidently applied.

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

12 Data Verification 
As part of the validation process, SRK has completed investigation and reviewed quality control data 
as described in Section 12 which includes:  

• Blind standards and blanks 

• Field duplicates 

• Umpire assay 

• Twin Drilling. 

The vast majority of the submitted standards reported within the accepted 10% tolerance.  Generally, 
low biases are evident, indicating the assaying for this period of exploration was accurate.  The field 
duplicate comparative dataset shows acceptable repeatability.  The Umpire assay comparative 
dataset also shows acceptable repeatability. 

Original material in the form of core, drill chips and assay pulps has been located and viewed by SRK 
on site for some of the historic drilling during the site visit.  Selected mineralisation intervals were 
reviewed by SRK and elevated grades were seen corresponding to mineralisation and alteration styles 
typical of elevated Au grade noted in the documentation and also seen in the mined open pit walls. 

Additional verification of the drilling data is possible and has been completed based on global 
reconciliation studies completed using the production data (mining and plant data).  Globally, the drill 
hole data assay data, and the grade estimation tenor, compare favourably with the production grade 
control data and plant production data when modifying factors such as recovery and ore loss and 
dilution are applied.  This information supports the overall veracity of the drill hole assaying.  SRK 
notes that although this global reconciliation is in broad agreement with grade drill hole tenor, it is 
limited to the broad location of the mineralisation by deposit and is not completed locally. 

The Qualified Person considers that the data verification process completed confirms the global 
accuracy of the mineralisation tenor and hence confirms the overall tenor of Mineral Resources 
reported, and confirms confidence when mineral resource classification is applied.

13 Minerals Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
The existing mill at Burnakura produced around 58 koz of gold in concentrate using a combination of 
gravity and flotation, with reported recoveries generally ranging from 60 to 90%.  The existing 
processing plant flowsheet (Figure 13-1) is analogous to the current configuration of the processing 
plant.  SRK notes that some refurbishment would be required to return the processing plant to 
production; however, this has not been reviewed by SRK due to the current level of study. 

 

Figure 13-1: Existing processing plant configuration flowsheet 

The mineralisation defined in the reported Mineral Resources is thought to have similar metallurgical 
characteristics to previously mined ore in contiguous geological areas; however, some differences are 
noted at depth and there are also changes in local geology.  These areas require further investigation 
by collection of appropriate representative samples and completion of subsequent testwork.  

Further metallurgical testwork is planned as part of an ongoing development plan for the project, 
including investigations into heap leach processing. 



SRK Consulting Page 68 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

Current test work post 2014 includes the following key reports: 

• ALS March 2015 ANA testwork Report Number.  A15963 

• ALS May 2016 Federal City testwork Report Number A16573 

• OMC April 2017 – 2016/17 Burnakura Metallurgical Testwork Summary Report Number 7794. 

The following is a summary of the key findings of the above reports. 

The 2015–2017 testwork campaigns on Monument Mining's Burnakura Project targeted NOA1, NOA6, 
NOA7/8 and ANA to establish: 

• Comminution characteristics 

• Intermittent Bottle Roll leach tests at coarse crush sizes to establish the likely behaviour in a heap 
leach 

• Tank leaching response at varying grind sizes and carbon in leach (CIL) vs direct leach without 
carbon (DL). 

Comminution testwork results are described in Table 13-1 below with 2017 samples shown in red: 

Table 13-1: Comminution testwork results 

 

Leach tank results in Table 13-2 show extraction results for comparison between tank and heap leach.  
Other than the black shale lithology, results show tank leach recoveries from 73% to 99% and heap 
leach recoveries from 15 to 80%, which indicate economic extraction is achievable for specific 
lithologies and processing routes.

Table 13-2 Leach testwork results 

 

Current CIL recoveries that are assigned to each deposit on the basis of the testwork and similar 
geological characteristics and assuming oxide and transition being ground to 150 um and fresh to 
75 um are shown in Table 13-3.  SRK notes that this tabulation will be refined with additional data 
collection and testwork, but is not considered definitive for the project at present. 

Table 13-3 Generalised recovery – % results by deposit 

 Proposed Recovery % 
Area Oxide Transitional Fresh 
ANA 1 and 2 95% 94% 90% 

ANA 3 and 4 95% 94% 90% 

Federal City 95% 91% 90% 

NOA 1 and 2 91% 91% 91% 

NOA 4 and 6  93% 92% 87% 

NOA 7 and 8 86% 78% 78% 

Authaal 95% 91% 90% 

 

Note that in Table 13-3, ANA 1 and 2 are considered the same geologically as ANA 3 and 4.  Federal 
City transitional and fresh are the same geology as NOA1/2.  Authaal is considered similar to Federal 
City.  It is also noted from above that the NOA 7/8 material which contains black shales is not amenable 
to heap leach and recoveries in CIL are considered low. 

SRK notes that further testwork is being completed by MMY to assist in refining recoveries and 
developing the optimal metallurgical flowsheet.  SRK however considers that the preliminary testwork 
described shows the potential for the economic extraction of Au within the appropriate mineralised 
units.

14 Mineral Resource Estimates 
SRK has completed updated Mineral Resource Estimates for the Burnakura Gold Project (the Project).  
This following is a summary of the estimation process and reported grade tonnages for five deposits 
within the Project area. 

SRK notes that the estimates have been classified and reported by SRK according to CNI 43-101 and 
CIM guidelines based on review of the QA/QC data and the consideration that the mineral resource 
conforms within criteria of having 'reasonable prospects for economic extraction' (see detailed 
discussion in Section 14.6). 

 NOA 1–6 Mineral Resource 
The updated NOA 1–6 mineralisation model was updated based on additional data from the 2015-
2016 drill campaign.  This represents a greater geological understanding and acknowledgement of the 
continuity of the mineralising system seen at NOA1-6 and the proposed open pit bulk mining method.  
The NOA1-6 deposit was modelled and estimated using the Vulcan software package.  Mineral 
Resource estimates for the NOA 1–6 deposit have been generated by SRK on the basis of exploration 
data and analytical results available up to 1 March 2018. 

 Geological Modelling 
An implicit geological model of the mineralisation was generated in Leapfrog software based on a 
nominal 0.3g/t Au and 1 g/t cut-off grade and geological interpretation, which considered quartz veins/ 
gold lodes systems orientations.  The structural setting was considered with six major faults modelled.  

Mineralisation wireframes generated for NOA 1–6 were split into 10 major domains, based on the tenor 
with similar mineralisation styles and orientations as shown in Figure 14-1.  

The base of oxidation surface and top of fresh surface were constructed from logged depths in the drill 
holes; however, the majority of the mineralisation lies in the primary portion of the oxidation profile.  
The digital terrain model is the general topography covering the entire Burnakura area, termed 
'burnakura_110712', based on the July 2012 site survey.  Voids from underground workings including 
development and stopes were validated and applied.

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

 Statistical analysis 
Samples within the domains were composited to 2 m down-the-hole lengths.  Residual composites 
>0.5m in length were retained as calculated, while those <0.5m long were removed. 

SRK completed removal of high grade material in the mined underground void areas for estimation.  
Sensitivities showed that the inclusion of this void material considerably overstated the contained 
metal in the lower grade mineralisation halo. 

Grade outliers in the 2 m composites were examined to determine high grade cuts.  A variety of 
differing top cuts was applied on the basis of spatial distribution and probability plots to the 10 domains.  
Cut and uncut means are included in Table 14-1.

 Variography 
Variography for the study was based on the 2 m composites.  Several types of variograms and 
variogram fans were calculated for the cut grade data, including the traditional variogram, the 
correlogram and a Gaussian variogram. 

The normal scores transformed variogram proved to display reasonable structure and were modelled.  
The nugget was determined from the close spaced down-the-hole data, with a lag distance of 2 m and 
an omni-directional search.  The ranges were determined from directional variograms with a lag 
distance of 10 m in the east-west (major), 10 m north-south (semi-major) and 3 m vertical (minor).  The 
variogram model parameters for the major domain 110 (which is similar to the other domains) are 
detailed in Table 14-2.

 Block model development 
A block model panel size of 5 m E by 10 m N by 5 mRL was selected to best represent the available 
data, the data characteristics (variability as defined by variography), and the envisaged mining 
practises (open-cut). 

Details of the block model are shown in Table 14-3.

Z 200.0 – 480.0 5 1.0 

All variables necessary to record the domain coding, resource grade estimates and related estimation 
statistics, density assignments and resource category assignments were incorporated into the block 
model. 

Bulk density was assigned on the basis of the bulk density database and assumptions for the oxide, 
transitional and fresh. 

• Oxide mineralised – 2.19t/m³ 

• Transitional mineralised – 2.4t/m³ 

• Fresh mineralised – 2.7t/m³.  

 Grade estimation 
Grade estimation within the interpreted mineralised envelopes was undertaken by Ordinary Kriging 
(OK) based on the 2m composite gold data generated for each domain.  Kriging parameters were 
determined from the variography discussed in Section 14.1.3.  The sample search parameters have 
been selected based on detailed neighbourhood testing which allows for optimisation of the estimation 
plan.  Grade was generally interpolated in three passes as follows: 

• First pass:  Based on a 25 m by 25 m by 5 m (major, semi-major and minor axes respectively), 
ellipsoid search with a minimum of 6 and maximum of 16 composites 

• Second pass:  50 m by 50 m by 10 m sample search using a minimum of 6 and maximum of 16 
composites   

• Third pass:  150 m by 150 m by 15 m, sample search using a minimum of 4 and maximum of 16 
composites.   

All domains were interpolated simultaneously, using a block discretisation of 5 m E by 5 m N by 
3 mRL.  A high-grade limit was placed on the second and third pass for values greater than an upper 
Au threshold determined for some domains.  This limited the sample search to composites below the 
grade threshold if these higher grade samples were outside a sample search distance of 25 m (major 
axis), 25 m (semi major axis) and 10 m (minor).  This has the effect of limiting smearing effects of 
isolated high-grade samples.  Searches were oriented to be consistent the model variography for each 
domain. 

Validation of the estimate was completed and included both visual and statistical review.  The visual 
comparison was undertaken by comparing the input data, using the composites, against the estimated 
grades in the model.  The statistical review included a comparison of the mean grade of the input 
composites against the model grade via statistics and swath plots. 

Based on the validation, the estimate adequately maps the input data where sufficient data existed, 
with grade trends reproduced acceptably in the model.  However, in the regions of low data density, 
the estimates appeared to be less robust and an increased level smoothing was noted, although the 
smoothing was still considered acceptable.

 Mineral Resource reporting 
The Mineral Resource estimate of the NOA 1–6 deposit has been classified as a combination of 
Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources with reference to the guidelines outlined in NI 43-101. 

The definitive criteria used for resource classification is based on a combination of the drilling data 
density, distance to the nearest informing input data and the slope of regression.  Drill density is 
insufficient to classify the smaller domains and mineralised halos as indicated, even where the 
occasional block estimate is of a reduced quality.  

The NOA 1–6 mineralisation area, as estimated by SRK, is summarized in Table 14-4.  The model is 
reported using the general topography covering the entire project area, based on the July 2012 site 
survey.  It is also depleted for underground working voids.

 NOA 7–8 Mineral Resource 
The updated NOA 7–8 mineralisation model was updated based on the additional data from the 2015-
2016 drill campaign.  This represents a refined understanding and acknowledgement of the continuity 
of the mineralising system seen at NOA 7–8 and the proposed underground mining method.  The 
NOA 7–8 deposit was modelled and estimated using the Vulcan software package.  Mineral Resource 
estimates for the NOA 7–8 deposit have been generated by SRK on the basis of exploration data and 
analytical results available up to 1 March 2018. 

 Geological modelling 
An implicit geological model of the mineralisation was generated by SRK in Leapfrog software based 
on a nominal 0.3g/t Au and 2.0 g/t cut-off grade and geological interpretation which considered quartz 
veins/ gold lodes systems orientations.  The structural setting was considered with faults modelled.  

Mineralisation wireframes generated for NOA 7–8 were split into two major domains, based on the 
tenor with similar mineralisation styles and orientations as seen in Figure 14-2. 

The base of the oxidation surface and the top of the fresh surface were constructed from logged depths 
in the drill holes; however, the majority of the mineralisation lies in the primary portion of the oxidation 
profile.  The digital terrain model is the general topography covering the entire Burnakura area, termed 
'burnakura_110712', based on the July 2012 site survey.

 Statistical analysis 
Samples within the domains were composited to 1 m down-the-hole lengths.  Residual composites 
>0.5m in length were retained as calculated, while those <0.5m long were removed. 

Grade outliers in the 1 m composites were examined to determine high grade cuts.  A variety of 
differing top cuts was applied on the basis of spatial distribution and probability plots to the two 
domains.  Cut and uncut means are included in Table 14-5.

 Variography 
Variography for the study was based on the 1 m composites.  Several types of variograms and 
variogram fans were calculated for the cut grade data, including the traditional variogram, the 
correlogram and a Gaussian variogram. 

The normal scores transformed variogram proved to display reasonable structure and were modelled.  
The nugget was determined from the close spaced down-the-hole data, with a lag distance of 2 m and 
an omni-directional search.  The ranges were determined from directional variograms with a lag 
distance of 10 m in the east-west (major), 10 m north-south (semi-major) and a 3 m vertical (minor).  
The variogram model parameters for the major domain 110 (which is similar to the other domains) are 
detailed in Table 14-6.

 Block model development 
A block model panel size of 5 m E by 10 m N by 2 mRL was selected to best represent the available 
data, the data characteristics (variability as defined by variography), and the envisaged mining 
practises (open-cut). 

Details of the block model are shown in Table 14-7. 

Table 14-7: Block Model Extents – NOA7–8 

 Extent (m) Dimensions (m) Min. Subcell Dimensions 

X 645300.0 – 645820.0 5 2.5 

Y 7010920 – 7011600.0 10 5.0 

Z 200.0 – 480.0 2 1.0 

All variables necessary to record the domain coding, resource grade estimates and related estimation 
statistics, density assignments and resource category assignments were incorporated into the block 
model. 

Bulk density was assigned on the basis of the bulk density database and assumptions for the oxide, 
transitional and fresh. 

• Oxide mineralised – 2.19t/m³ 

• Transitional mineralised – 2.4t/m³ 

• Fresh mineralised – 2.7t/m³.  

 Grade estimation 
Grade estimation within the interpreted mineralised envelopes was undertaken by OK based on the 
1 m composite gold data generated for each domain.  Kriging parameters were determined from the 
variography discussed in Section 14.2.3.  The sample search parameters have been selected based 
on detailed neighbourhood testing which allows for optimisation of the estimation plan.  Grade was 
generally interpolated in three passes as follows: 

• First pass:  Based on a 25 m by 25 m by 5 m (major, semi-major and minor axes respectively), 
ellipsoid search with a minimum of 10 and maximum of 20 composites 

• Second pass:  50 m by 50 m by 10 m sample search using a, minimum of 10 and maximum of 20 
composites   

• Third pass:  150 m by 150 m by 15 m, sample search using a minimum of 6 and maximum of 24 
composites.   

All domains were interpolated simultaneously, using a block discretisation of 5 m E by 5 m N by 
3 mRL.  A high-grade limit was placed on the second and third pass for values greater than an upper 
Au threshold determined for some domains.  This limited the sample search to composites below the 
grade threshold if these higher grade samples were outside a sample search distance of 25 m (major 
axis), 25 m (semi major axis) and 10 m (minor).  This has the effect of limiting smearing effects of 
isolated high-grade samples.  Searches were oriented to be consistent the model variography for each 
domain. 

Validation of the estimate was completed and included both visual and statistical review.  The visual 
comparison was undertaken by comparing the input data, using the composites, against the estimated 
grades in the model.  The statistical review included a comparison of the mean grade of the input 
composites against the model grade via statistics and swath plots. 



SRK Consulting Page 76 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

Based on the validation, the estimate adequately maps the input data where sufficient data existed, 
with grade trends reproduced acceptably in the model.  However, in the regions of low data density, 
the estimates appeared to be less robust and an increased level smoothing was noted, although the 
smoothing is still considered acceptable. 

 Mineral Resource reporting 
The mineral resource estimate of the NOA 7–8 deposit has been classified as a combination of 
Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources with reference to the guidelines outlined in NI 43-101. 

The definitive criteria used for resource classification is based on a combination of the drilling data 
density, distance to the nearest informing input data and the slope of regression.  Drill density is 
insufficient to classify the smaller domains and mineralised halos as indicated, even where the 
occasional block estimate is of a reduced quality.  

The NOA 7–8 mineralisation area, as estimated by SRK, is summarised in Table 14-8.  The model is 
reported using the general topography covering the entire project area based on the July 2012 site 
survey. It is expected that the Mineral Resource will be mined by Underground mining methods and 
as such a lower grade cutoff of 3.0 g/t Au is applied.

 ANA Mineral Resource  
The updated ANA mineralisation model was updated based on additional data from the Monument 
2015 drill campaign.  This represents a greater geological understanding and acknowledgement of the 
continuity of the mineralising system seen at ANA and the proposed open pit bulk mining method.  The 
ANA deposit was modelled and estimated using the Vulcan software package.  Mineral Resource 
estimates for the ANA deposit have been generated by SRK on the basis of exploration data and 
analytical results available up to 1 March 2018. 

 Geological modelling 
A model of the mineralisation was updated by SRK in Vulcan software based on a nominal 0.3g/t Au 
and 1 g/t cut-off grade and geological interpretation which considered BIF and quartz veins/ gold lodes 
systems orientations.  The structural setting was considered with major faults considered during 
modelling.  

Mineralisation wireframes generated for ANA were split into 14 major domains, based on the tenor 
with similar mineralisation styles and orientations. 

The base of the oxidation surface and the top of the fresh surface were constructed from logged depths 
in the drill holes; however, the majority of the mineralisation lies in the primary portion of the oxidation 
profile.  The digital terrain model is the general topography covering the entire Burnakura area, termed 
'burnakura_110712', based in the July 2012 site survey.

Figure 14-3: ANA Mineralisation domains and drilling plan view 

 Statistical analysis 
Samples within the domains were composited to 2 m down-the-hole lengths.  Residual composites 
were weighted back to the previous interval. 

SRK completed removal of high grade material in the mined underground void areas for estimation.  
Sensitivities showed that the inclusion of this void material considerably overstated the contained 
metal in the lower grade mineralisation halo. 

Grade outliers in the 2 m composites were examined to determine high-grade cuts.  A variety of 
differing top cuts was applied on the basis of spatial distribution and probability plots to the 10 domains.

 Authaal Mineral Resource 
The updated Authaal mineralisation model was based on additional pit mapping data from the site visit 
completed by SRK.  SRK notes that no additional drilling has been completed, since Kentor Gold in 
2012, by Monument at Authaal.  This model represents a refined geological understanding and 
acknowledgement of the continuity of the mineralising system seen at Authaal and the proposed open 
pit bulk mining method.  The Authaal deposit was modelled and estimated using the Vulcan software 
package.  Mineral Resource estimates for the Authaal deposit have been generated by SRK on the

A block model panel size of 5 m E by 10 m N by 5 mRL was selected to best represent the available

All variables necessary to record the domain coding, resource grade estimates and related estimation 
statistics, density assignments and resource category assignments were incorporated into the block 
model. 

Bulk density was assigned on the basis of the bulk density database for other nearby deposits and 
assumptions for the oxide and fresh mineralised material: 

• Oxide mineralised – 2.0t/m³ 

• Fresh mineralised – 2.75t/m³.  

 Grade estimation 
Grade estimation within the interpreted mineralized envelopes was undertaken by OK based on the 
2 m composite gold data generated for each domain.  Kriging parameters were determined from the 
variography discussed in Section 14.4.3.  The sample search parameters have been selected based 
on detailed neighbourhood testing which allows for optimisation of the estimation plan.  Grade was 
generally interpolated in three passes as follows: 

• First pass:  Based on a 25 m by 25 m by 5 m (major, semi-major and minor axes respectively), 
ellipsoid search with a minimum of 6 and maximum of 16 composites. 

• Second pass:  50 m by 50 m by 10 m sample search using a, minimum of 6 and maximum of 16 
composites.   

• Third pass:  150 m by 150 m by 15 m, sample search using a minimum of 4 and maximum of 16 
composites.   

All domains were interpolated simultaneously, using a block discretisation of 5 m E by 5 m N by 
3 mRL.  A high-grade limit was placed on the second and third pass for values greater than an upper 
Au threshold determined for some domains.  This limited the sample search to composites below the 
grade threshold if these higher grade samples were outside a sample search distance of 25 m (major 
axis), 25 m (semi major axis) and 5 m (minor).  This has the effect of limiting smearing effects of 
isolated high-grade samples.  Searches were oriented to be consistent the model variography for each 
domain. 



SRK Consulting Page 82 

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

Validation of the estimate was completed and included both visual and statistical review.  The visual 
comparison was undertaken by comparing the input data, using the composites, against the estimated 
grades in the model.  The statistical review included a comparison of the mean grade of the input 
composites against the model grade via statistics and swath plots. 

Based on the validation, the estimate adequately maps the input data where sufficient data existed, 
with grade trends reproduced acceptably in the model.  However, in the regions of low data density, 
the estimates appeared to be less robust and an increased level smoothing was noted, although the 
smoothing is still considered acceptable. 

 Mineral Resource reporting 
The Mineral Resource estimate of the Authaal deposit has been classified and reported as an Inferred 
Mineral Resource with reference to the guidelines outlined in NI 43-101 and the CIM code. 

The definitive criteria used for resource classification is based on a combination of the drilling data 
density, distance to the nearest informing input data and the slope of regression.  QA/QC data 
availability also influenced classification. 

The Authaal mineralisation area, as estimated by SRK, is summarised in Table 14-16.  The model is 
reported using the general topography covering the entire project area based on the July 2012 site 
survey and is depleted for previous workings.

 Federal City Mineral Resource 
The updated Federal City mineralisation model was based on additional data from the late 2015 drill 
campaign completed by Monument.  This model represents a refined geological understanding and 
acknowledgement of the continuity of the mineralising system seen at Federal City and the proposed 
open pit bulk mining method.  The Federal City deposit was modelled and estimated using the Vulcan 
software package.  Mineral Resource estimates for Federal City have been generated by SRK on the 
basis of exploration data and analytical results available up to 1 March 2018. 

 Geological modelling 
A model of the mineralisation was updated by SRK in Vulcan software based on a nominal 0.3g/t Au 
cut-off grade and internal nominal +1 g/t Au cut-off on internal lodes and the geological interpretation 
which considered quartz veins/ gold lodes systems orientations.  The structural setting was considered 
with major faults considered during modelling.  

Mineralisation wireframes generated for Federal City were split into four major domains, based on the 
tenor with similar mineralisation styles and orientations. 

The base of oxidation surface and top of fresh rock surface was constructed from logged depths in the 
drill holes.  The digital terrain model is the general topography covering the entire Burnakura area, 
termed 'burnakura_110712', based on the July 2012 site survey.

 Statistical analysis 
Samples within the domains were composited to 2 m down-the-hole lengths.  Residual composites 
were weighted back to the previous interval. 

Grade outliers in the 2 m composites were examined to determine high-grade cuts.  A variety of

 Variography 
Variography for the study is based on the 2 m composites.  Several types of variograms and variogram 
fans were calculated for the cut grade data, including the traditional variogram, the correlogram and a 
Gaussian variogram. 

The normal scores transformed variogram proved to display reasonable structure and were modelled.  
The nugget was determined from the close spaced down-the-hole data, with a lag distance of 2 m and 
a directional search.  The ranges were determined from directional variograms with a lag distance of 
9 m in the east-west (major), 8 m north-south (semi-major) and 3 m vertical (minor).  The variogram 
model parameters for the major domain 140 (which is similar to the other domains) are detailed in 
Table 14-18.

 Block model development 
A block model panel size of 5 m E by 10 m N by 5 mRL was selected to best represent the available 
data, the data characteristics (variability as defined by variography), and the envisaged mining 
practises (open-cut). 

Details of the block model are shown in Table 14-19.

Y 7005100.0 – 7005950.0 10 5.0 

Z 350.0 - 500.0 5 1.0 

All variables necessary to record the domain coding, resource grade estimates and related estimation 
statistics, density assignments and resource category assignments were incorporated into the block 
model. 

Bulk density was assigned on the basis of the bulk density database for other nearby deposits and 
assumptions for the oxide and fresh mineralised material. 

• Oxide mineralised – 2.0t/m³ 

• Transitional mineralised – 2.4t/m³ 

• Fresh mineralised – 2.75t/m³.  

 Grade estimation 
Grade estimation within the interpreted mineralised envelopes was undertaken by OK based on the 
2 m composite gold data generated for each domain.  Kriging parameters were determined from the 
variography discussed in Section 14.5.3.  The sample search parameters have been selected based 
on detailed neighbourhood testing which allows for optimisation of the estimation plan.  Grade was 
generally interpolated in three passes as follows: 

• First pass:  Based on a 25 m by 25 m by 5 m (major, semi-major and minor axes respectively), 
ellipsoid search with a minimum of 6 and maximum of 16 composites 

• Second pass:  50 m by 50 m by 10 m sample search using a, minimum of 6 and maximum of 16 
composites   

• Third pass:  150 m by 150 m by 15 m, sample search using a minimum of 4 and maximum of 16 
composites.   

All domains were interpolated simultaneously, using a block discretisation of 5 m E by 5 m N by 
3 mRL.  A high-grade limit was placed on the second and third pass for values greater than an upper 
Au threshold determined for some domains.  This limited the sample search to composites below the 
grade threshold if these higher grade samples were outside a sample search distance of 25 m (major 
axis), 25 m (semi-major axis) and 5 m (minor).  This has the effect of limiting smearing effects of 
isolated high-grade samples.  Searches were oriented to be consistent the model variography for each 
domain.

SLAT/WALS/FAIR/mena MNM004_Burnakura__NI_43 101_Technical Report_June 2018_Rev2 18 July 2018 

Validation of the estimate was completed and included both visual and statistical review.  The visual 
comparison was undertaken by comparing the input data, using the composites, against the estimated 
grades in the model.  The statistical review included a comparison of the mean grade of the input 
composites against the model grade via statistics and swath plots. 

Based on the validation, the estimate adequately maps the input data where sufficient data existed, 
with grade trends reproduced acceptably in the model.  However, in the regions of low data density, 
the estimates appeared to be less robust and an increased level smoothing was noted, although the 
smoothing is still considered acceptable. 

 Mineral Resource reporting 
The Mineral Resource estimate of the Federal City deposit has been classified and reported as an 
Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource with reference to the guidelines outlined in NI 43-101 and the 
CIM code. 

The definitive criteria used for resource classification is based on a combination of the drilling data 
density, distance to the nearest informing input data and the slope of regression.  QA/QC data 
availability also influenced classification. 

The Federal City mineralisation area, as estimated by SRK, is summarised in Table 14-20.  The model 
is reported using the general topography covering the entire project area based on the July 2012 site 
survey and is depleted for previous workings.

Inferred 0.5 259 1.3 11 

 Mineral Resource classification and reasonable prospects for 
economic extraction discussion 
SRK considers there to be no material impediments to the potential economic extraction of the mineral 
resources, and hence classification of the mineral resources, by any other known environmental, 
permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or political factors other than issues noted 
and discussed in the relevant sections of this ITR.  It is noted that the majority of the mineral resources 
described in the ITR are the extensions of previously and currently mined open pits and underground 
workings at the Burnakura Project. 

The open pit mineral resources have been reported within broad pit optimisation sensitivities using an 
inflated gold price and aggressive mining and milling assumptions with an appropriate lower cut-off 
(0.5 g/t Au), which resulted in reporting grades that are typically economic for the mineralisation style 
and proposed medium scale open pit bulk mining operation  

The underground mineral resources have been reported using an assumed decline development from 
the base of current and potential open pits within 200 m vertical depth from a portal and an appropriate 
reporting lower cut-off (3.0 g/t Au) that results in reporting grades that are typically economic for the 
style of mineralisation and proposed decline development and open stope mining methods.

25 Interpretation and Conclusions 
SRK has completed updates of the Mineral Resource Estimates suitable for input into Preliminary 
Economic Analysis studies that are to be completed by MMY.  The basis of the Mineral Resource 
Estimates were an updated geological interpretations and review of all available data for the Project 
over its 20-year history. 

The update of the Mineral Resources will also allow for refined targeting of proposed drilling programs 
to extend and infill the mineralisation to achieve a higher confidence and enlarged Mineral Resource 
in the future. 

The review of the available metallurgical data and its relationship with the mineralisation will allow 
better targeting of resources to define a refined data collection outcome. 

SRK considers that this study report will assist in progressing the Project in a refined manner.

26 Recommendations 
The Burnakura Project has been the subject of a number of exploration and resource definition drilling 
program over the past 20 years.  From the review of historic work and recent drilling by Monument, it 
is apparent that there is an opportunity to extend the mineralisation envelopes and infill the current 
Inferred classified material to improve and extend the Mineral Resource Estimation confidence.  

Current focus of exploration includes: 

• Further definition and extension the NOA mineralisation 

• Collection of additional metallurgical data 

• Definition and extension of shallow oxide gold occurrences on the Burnakura leases. 

Other recommended work programs to enhance future resource modelling include:  

• Further studies of the structural setting and timing of the mineralisation, which may lead to deeper 
exploration targeting 

• Gold characterisation 

• Lithogeochemistry studies to improve understanding of the mineralising geology and alteration 
types  

• Metallurgical characterisation studies to assess variability of mineralisation for mineral processing. 

The exploration drilling/ assaying budget for FY18 is ~A$300,000 and focuses on NOA7-8 Deeps, 
Alliance Deeps, NOA1-2 Deeps and Structural targeting near Lewis Reward Deeps and also 
extensions to oxide targets.  

The exploration drilling for FY17 focused on extending NOA 78 down plunge, and testing the deeps 
potential of Alliance.  The exploration focus for FY18 is to further delineate the deeps potential at 
Alliance, and to test for potential repeat structures at the NOA line of mineralisation which is still open 
at depth.   

Monument intends to complete a lithostructural targeting study across all three of its Murchison 
Projects, including Burnakura, with a budget of approximately A$40,000.  The targeting study will 
utilise all available geophysical, geochemical and geological datasets.  Follow-up work and drill 
planning will be based on the outcome of this targeting work.  

The budget for the metallurgical testwork is ~A$30,000, and incudes standard testwork and an ore-
sorting trial. 

SRK considers that the proposed budget expenditures are in keeping with the continued exploration 
strategy and are appropriate for the current status of the project.
