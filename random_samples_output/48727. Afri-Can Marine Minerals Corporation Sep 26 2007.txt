1. PREAMBLE & SUMMARY 
 

Afri-Can Marine Minerals Corporation ("Afri-Can") is pleased to announce that the analysis 

and interpretation of data collected in Feature 08 during the geophysical surveys in EPL 2499 

(Block J) in 2006, was completed on August 31st, 2007. Of the 854 line-kilometres completed 

during the whole survey, 422 line-kilometres were done in Feature 08.  

This report, including accompanying illustrations, is one of a series detailing the geology of 

various geological Features in EPL 2499 (Block J). It comprises a detailed account of 

observations and interpretations of the geology of Feature 08, and whilst acknowledging the 

surrounding geology, it focuses on Feature 08.  A report on Feature 06 was published on 30th 

June 2007 1, and other reports concerned with Features 17 and 19 will follow in coming months. 

The complete set of reports will then be compiled as a Final Report in compliance with National 

Instrument 43-101.

Summary of Report 
 

Previous geophysical work was done in 2001, followed by sampling programmes in 2001 

and 2002.  The data from these operations was used as appropriate during the analysis, as were 

the results of the extensive geophysical and vibracore surveys in 2006, mentioned above. 

This report is structured on the geological history of Feature 08, from the oldest formations 

to the youngest.  The report commences by examining the setting of EPL 2499 (Block J) in 

relation to broad geological structures in the region, and the position of Feature 08 within this 

context.  A broad ancient drainage system is recognised immediately to the northeast of  

Feature 08.  The possible ages of this structure, and the sediments contained therein, are 

discussed. 

The detailed geology of Feature 08 is then examined, commencing with the Precambrian 

basement and its structures.  The account then moves to the oldest recognised sediments, which 

are concluded to be Lower Tertiary (late Eocene or early Oligocene) in age. These are sediments 

that fill the ancient valley structure mentioned above.  The ancient drainage structure, and its 

associated valley-fill sediments, plunges to the west beneath a sequence of Miocene sediments, 

the basal units of which lie directly on Precambrian basement, or unconformably on the valley-fill 

sediments. 

The Oligocene-Basal Miocene unconformity is of intense economic interest in the region, 

as it represents the first major flushing of diamondiferous Eocene sediments from the coastal 

plain onto the continental shelf area.  Therefore the basal Miocene sediments, and younger units 

derived from them, are of major economic interest in Feature 08, and the majority of the proposed 

samples fall within this target.  The basal Miocene unit comprises sandstones and conglomerates 

and is overlain by finer Miocene sediments, the latter being designated the middle and upper units 

within Feature 08.  Whilst the economic potential of the latter might be low, they contain some 

minor gravels containing jaspers and black agates, the origin of which is ambivalent.  It is 

therefore proposed that they should be tested by a limited amount of sampling. 

The Terrestrial-Colluvial Formation (TC Fm), recognised in Feature 06 and dating from the 

time of maximum last glaciation (± 20000 years BP), also occurs in Feature 08.  Previous phase 1 

and phase 2 sampling (2001 and 2002) has shown that this formation is well mineralised in 

Feature 08.  It probably derives, in the main, from erosion of the potentially diamondiferous 

Eocene/Oligocene and basal Miocene formations in the vicinity, and therefore is highly 

prospective.  The rise of sea level away from F08 elevations, during the last transgression of the 

sea to present levels, reworked previous deposits and redistributed any loose diamonds.  This did 

not include diamonds still within the TC Fm, which are available to modern sampling technology. 

It is concluded that the basal Miocene unit, together with the TC Fm and more recent 

sediments derived from it, is the primary target for sampling in Feature 08.  It is also proposed that 



Page 6 of 18 

the middle and upper Miocene units, the valley-fill sediments and patches of probable loose 

gravel, should be tested by sparse sampling. 

The total number of samples recommended for the first round of sampling in Feature 08 is 

167 samples.  A second round of sampling, designed to enhance and fill gaps in the first-round 

results, will close up the sampling density and allow estimation of mineral resources, whilst also 

enhancing and evaluating any new mineralisation detected by the first round of sampling.  

This report is published with the rider that the model for Feature 08 is likely to be 

enhanced and updated as further interrogations of the data are undertaken, in the process of 

establishing geological models for the other Features of interest in Block J. 

 

 

2.  BROAD GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK  
 
2.1  Old Drainage Systems 
 

Map 1 shows the location of Block J in relation to the outcrops of basement and sediment 

in the adjacent nearshore and on land, documented by previous workers2 3.  It is concluded that a 

major old drainage system passes through the centre of Block J, with a smaller one near the 

southern boundary.  The existence of a broad geological entity crossing the centre of Block J, of 

differing texture from the surrounding Precambrian basement, was documented in previous 

reports (by consultants RWF and K.B.Lord) but the significance of the feature was not then 

realised.  It is now clear from regional information that the structure is a broad, shallow valley.  

Discontinuous Sparker results from the phase 2 geophysics (November 2006) suggest depths of 

at least 12 metres below seabed to the valley floor to the south of Feature 06, whilst further to the 

west, in Feature 08, depths of 40 metres are recorded.  The structure is about 4 kilometres wide 

in Feature 08. 

The age of the valley systems is not clear.  They may be as old as the Dwyka (312 – 280 

million years ago (Ma)) by analogy to similar valleys further north on the Namibian coast that 

contain Dwyka-age sediments.  Whatever the age of establishment of the valley, a vibracore 

within the valley structure in Feature 08 recovered material of Eocene or early Oligocene age, so 

the valleys are at least as old as the arrival of diamonds at the west coast, and therefore have 

significance in the geological history of the area. 

Feature 08 is situated at the point where the old valley structure, and its associated 

sediments, plunges beneath the Miocene formations onlapping from the west.  Therefore this old 

drainage structure has importance in the geological history of Feature 08.

Less is known about the old drainage system that crosses the southern part of Block J.  

That valley is thought to be of no significance to the geology of Feature 08, so it is not considered 

further in this report.  It will be discussed in future reports dealing with Features in its vicinity. 

 

2.2  Lower Tertiary Sediments in Old Drainage Systems 
 

Side Scan Sonar (SSS) and Multi Beam Echo Sounder (MBES) data from Feature 08 

show that indurated sediments occupy the major old drainage valley.  These form small scarps 

and (at least along the northern valley fringe) dip towards the valley centre.  Phase 1 sampling in 

the valley area failed to achieve any significant penetration and chips of grey sandstone or 

conglomerate were regularly recovered.  From this evidence it is concluded that some of the 

valley sediment-fill consists of indurated grey sandstones and conglomerates.  Material of Eocene 

aspect recovered in Vibracore 31 from within the valley structure consists of compact, partly 

cemented yellow-brown sand. 

 

2.3  Upper Tertiary Sedimentation 
 

The broad ancient valley, and its associated sediments, plunges to the west beneath an 

extensive cover of Miocene sediments that occupy most of the western part of Feature 08.  These 

sediments, which have been bevelled back to approximately 115 metres water depth, rest upon 

the Oligocene/Miocene unconformity.  This break in sedimentation coincides with a major 

lowering of sea level and the flushing out of diamondiferous Lower Tertiary sediments from the 

coastal plain onto the continental shelf.  The basal Miocene units are therefore of extreme 

economic interest. 

 

2.4  Quaternary and Recent Sedimentation 
 

There is a major break in the geological record of Feature 08 from the Miocene until the 

late Pleistocene, when sediments of the Terrestrial/Colluvial Formation (TC fm) were deposited 

during the maximum sea level regression of the last glacial.  Following this, the recovery of sea 

level to its present elevation deposited sediments of the Last Transgressive Sequence (LTS), 

reworking many of the previous deposits and their associated diamonds.    

 

 

3.  GEOLOGY OF FEATURE 08 BEFORE 20 000 YEARS AGO 
 

The following sections of this report are a synopsis of the main geological events and units 

in Feature 08.  For more comprehensive information concerning the geology and geological 



Page 8 of 18 

model of Feature 08 and the whole of Block J, refer to the detailed report on the vibracores 

collected in 2006 4.   

 
3.1  Bathymetry and topography 
 

For the purpose of this report, Feature 08 is defined as a rectangular area 9 kilometres 

from north to south and 4.5 kilometres east to west.  The southwestern corner of the area is 

situated at co-ordinates X = 462000, Y = 7169000 (UTM zone 33S, datum WGS84). 

Map 2 shows the bathymetry of Feature 08, compiled from results of both the 2001 and 

2006 surveys. The highest point, 98 metres below mean sea level (MSL) is towards the southern 

fringe of the area and the deepest point, 130 metres below MSL, is in the southwest.  The 

topography is also seen in oblique view in Image 1, and comprises a broad embayment, with 

distinctly higher ground on the southern flank and slightly higher ground on the northern flank.  

The western part of the Feature is generally smooth, sloping gently to the west, whilst the eastern 

part (the ancient drainage and valley-fill mentioned above) has small-scale rugged relief. 

 

3.2  Sea Bed Geological Map 
 

 Map 3 is a geological map of the seabed in Feature 08, interpreted from SSS textures and 

subtle topographic elements revealed by the MBES.  The main components of the geology are 

(from youngest to oldest):  

Silt, a discontinuous veneer of recent material. 

Gravel waves, loose gravel arranged into wave or mega-ripple structures.  

Gravel, an amorphous dark textured formation, not indurated. 

Upper Miocene unit, regularly bedded stiff grey fine sands and sandy muds. 

Middle Miocene unit, irregularly bedded stiff grey sands and muds, seemingly restricted to 

the outlet of the old drainage. 

Basal Miocene unit, compacted and semi-cemented sandstones and conglomerates with 

abundant Orange River Suite (ORS) pebbles. 

Valley Fill 2, (at least in part) marine sandstones with Eocene oysters.  It outcrops along 

the centre of the old Valley system. 

Valley Fill 1, (at least in part) Eocene yellow-brown compact clayey sand.  It forms small 

scarps and occurs along the outer parts of the old drainage system. 

Precambrian basement.

Image 2 shows the geological outcrops in relation to the topography of Feature 08.  The 

legend colours are the same as Map 3.  Basement material forms the higher ground to the north 

and south, whilst the Basal Miocene unit forms a distinct positive feature that sweeps across the 

broad embayment, behind which is the irregular topography of the valley fill material.  The middle 

and upper Miocene sediments form a generally even topography, sloping to the west.   

The details of each of the geological components are discussed below.  Map 4 shows the 

locations of the 2006 vibracores and also the Phase 1 (2001) and the Phase 2 (2002) samples, 

which are included in these discussions. 

 

3.3  Precambrian Basement 
 

Map 5 shows the outcrop of the Precambrian basement, together with the location of 

major fractures.  Two directional trends are noticed for the fractures: NW - SE and ENE - WSW.  

The NW - SE set of fractures are generally coast parallel and may be related to the rifting that 

took place during the break-up of Gondwana and formation of the South Atlantic, at about 130Ma.  

The NW - SE set of fractures is probably related to the NNW - SSE set noted in Feature 06. 

The ENE – WSW fractures are similar to those of identical orientation noted in Feature 06. 

   

3.4  Lower Tertiary Valley-Fill Sediments 
 

As described above, the ancient valley in the basement, that occupies the eastern part of 

Feature 08 and extends eastwards towards the coast, is filled by a series of Lower Tertiary 

sediments.  During seabed mapping using SSS and MBES data, two fairly distinct sedimentary 

units were noted, on the basis of texture and topography.  These are designated "Valley Fill 1" 

and "Valley Fill 2", and their outcrops within Feature 08 are shown in Map 6. 

Map 7 shows the outcrop structures of the valley-fill sediments.  Unit "Valley Fill 1" 

outcrops along the flanks of the valley.  In some places sub-parallel small escarpments are 

visible, apparently dipping towards the valley centre.  Elsewhere in Valley Fill 1 enigmatic curved 

outcrop structures are seen.  It must be pointed out that the so-called "valley" is in fact a very 

broad shallow drainage system that is about 4 kilometres wide but, from discontinuous Sparker 

evidence, only 40 metres deep in Feature 08.  Such a broad shallow drainage structure would be 

likely to contain several sinuous braided streams, and the enigmatic outcrops may be those of 

fluvial sediments in braided stream channels.  Vibracore 31 was taken very close to the small 

scarps mentioned above (Map 7), and recovered compact, semi-cemented yellow-brown clayey 

sand, which by comparison with outcrops on the modern coastal plain, is thought to be late 

Eocene or early Oligocene in age. 

Unit "Valley Fill 2" seems to be more massive than Valley Fill 1 (Map 7), but has a surface 

morphology showing lineation or trend in a NE – SW direction, which might represent the strike of

gently folded strata or, alternatively, longitudinal sedimentary structures.  Several vibracores taken 

in the Terrestrial-Colluvial Formation (see below), immediately down-slope of the outcrop of Valley 

Fill 2 unit, recovered abundant casts of oysters in grey or brown sandstone as well as copious 

exotic (ORS) pebbles, which are considered to be a "signature" of Eocene, or derived Eocene, 

material.  The oysters are distinctly of Eocene aspect and it is concluded that the material was 

derived from the adjacent Valley Fill 2 outcrop. 

It is therefore concluded that Valley Fill 1 was probably deposited by braided streams 

during a time of low sea level in the late Eocene (or early Oligocene) when drainage down the 

ancient valley system was active.  Valley Fill 2 is a shallow marine deposit representing recovery 

of sea level in late Eocene or early Oligocene times and submergence of the valley structure, 

about 34 million years ago (Ma). 

      

3.5  Miocene Sediments 
 

There is a break in the geological record in Block J, spanning the period from the early 

Oligocene (34 Ma) until some time during the Miocene (between 23 and 5 Ma).  This major beak 

in sedimentation is characteristic of the whole southern African West Coast region, and 

represents a major lowering of sea level during the Oligocene.  During that event there was major 

erosion and flushing out of the diamondiferous sediments that had accumulated on the coastal 

plain during the Eocene, when diamonds were first arriving at the West Coast.  Large quantities of 

diamonds were moved down-slope onto the present continental shelf area.  These diamonds 

were then reworked and redistributed as sea level rose during the Miocene, and were 

incorporated into the basal Miocene sediments, particularly those lying on the Oligocene 

unconformity surface. 

The vibracoring programme in Block J has proved that the western part of Feature 08 is 

occupied by a series of Miocene sediments that dip gently westward.  During mapping and 

classification of the seabed outcrops (from the geophysical data), three separate units were 

identified, and designated the Basal, Middle and Upper Miocene Units.  It should be noted that the 

terms Basal, Middle and Upper do not refer to the absolute age of the units within the Miocene 

epoch, but merely indicate their relative stratigraphic positions within Feature 08.  The Miocene 

sediment outcrops, which are largely covered by Recent silt, are shown in Map 8. 

The Basal unit lies directly on Basement or on the valley-fill sediments, and as such is 

considered to lie upon the Oligocene unconformity.  MBES records show that this unit forms a 

small scarp, up to 3 metres in height in places, facing northeast, as shown in Map 9.  An 

interesting aspect of the Basal Miocene sediments is that in many places they are intensely 

gullied, as shown in Map 10.  From sampling operations in 2001 and 2002 it was concluded that 

the Basal Miocene Unit consists of indurated or partly cemented sandstones and conglomerates.  

This conclusion is supported by the fact that the unit is sufficiently cemented to form a small

scarp, and is competent enough to support a gullied structure.  The sampling also showed that 

the Basal Unit contains abundant exotic (Orange River Suite) pebbles, and loose derivatives from 

it yielded diamonds. 

The gullies, which are generally parallel to the dip of the unit, are typical of gullies eroded 

in surf zones in hard substrates by the shoreward–seaward movement of pebbles and boulders in 

the swash zone.  The gullies therefore indicate an old shoreline that stood for a significant time.  

However, there have been many depressions of sea level since the Miocene, so the gullies do not 

necessarily date from the sea level regression of the last ice age.  An important aspect, however, 

is that the intense gullying of the Basal Miocene would have released diamonds for re-distribution 

into later sediments. 

The Middle and Upper Miocene Units are shown by the vibracoring to be very similar to 

each other, consisting generally of dark grey stiff fine sandy muds with variable shells.  There are 

also occasional scattered bands of gravel containing dark agates and jaspers, which are 

enigmatic.  However, the Middle Unit seems to have the form of a domed structure related to the 

ancient valley structure mentioned above, whereas the Upper Unit is more evenly bedded, parallel 

to the Basal Unit.  There is a clearly visible unconformity between the Middle and Upper Units, 

seen on the SSS records.  Some of the strata within the Middle Unit are hard, and form small 

scarps or minor positive relief features, whereas the strata of the Upper Unit do not.  Both the 

Middle and Upper units are concluded to originate from a shallow shelf marine environment. 

It is concluded that the Basal Miocene Unit rests upon the Oligocene unconformity and 

represents the reworked products of the major flushing out of diamondiferous sediments onto the 

present continental shelf area.  The sediments are relatively coarse, and have a significant 

diamond content.  The Middle Miocene Unit consists of shallow shelf sediments deposited in the 

vicinity of the output of the old valley structure, and the Upper Miocene Unit was also deposited in 

a shallow shelf environment, but sedimentation was more regular and uniform. 

The Basal Miocene Unit is clearly a target for future sampling.  The Middle and Upper 

Units contain enigmatic gravels, which should be tested by sampling. 

 

3.6  Terrestrial-Colluvial Formation 
 

The Grey-Green Sandy Muds (GGSM) formation that occurs extensively in Feature 06 and 

dates from the previous interglacial period (about 100 000 years ago), is not seen in Feature 08. 

Five vibracores to seawards of the outcrop of the Basal Miocene Unit in Feature 08 

recovered up to 5.5 metres of the Terrestrial/Colluvial (TC) formation, similar to that seen in 

Feature 06 (Map 11). The sediments in that unit consist of stiff and semi-cemented yellow and 

brown sands containing lumps of other sediment units in the vicinity, in places abundant exotic 

(ORS) pebbles, and some marine shells.  As was the case in Feature 06, it is concluded that

these sediments represent colluvial fans derived from surrounding upland areas, formed during 

the depression of sea level towards the last glacial maximum, about 30 000 years ago. 

The TC Fm occurrences in the vicinity of the Basal Miocene Unit would be expected to 

contain considerable quantities of material from that formation.  Indeed, phase 1 and phase 2 

sampling (2001 & 2002) proved that the TC Fm (although it was not recognised as such during 

that sampling) in Feature 8 contains considerable quantities of ORS pebbles and also diamonds.  

It therefore clearly is a prime target for phase 3 sampling.  Also worthy of note is that the 

vibracores generally penetrated about twice as deep as did the phases 1 and 2 sampling, as 

shown in Image 3.  This statement is certainly true regarding the TC Fm, where up to 5.5 metres 

of the material was penetrated, and still the base was not reached.  Clearly the TC formation in 

the vicinity of the Basal Miocene Unit has significant dimensions and is a primary target for 

sampling. 

 

4.  SEA LEVEL CHANGES DURING THE ICE AGE 
 

It is now generally accepted that the northern hemisphere ice age commenced at about 

2.5 Ma.  Many workers have produced contributions regarding changes of sea level.  Figure 1 

shows the sea level curve (on left of drawing) for the last 1.2 Ma; during that period there were 

about 14 major glaciation episodes with low sea levels (curve at left of range).  It also shows that 

each glacial advance characteristically was slow, with periodic reversals.  By contrast, 

deglaciation was characterised by rapid melting and rise of sea level. 

Figure 1 indicates that sea level was seldom above present level (curve at right of range) 

and was below present levels for most of the past 1.2 million years.  That statement probably 

applies to the whole glacial period of 2.5 million years.  Therefore there were many episodes of 

reworking of previous deposits and redistribution of diamonds along the west coast, each 

successive episode partially or wholly obliterating the previous record. 

Figure 2 shows sea levels over the past 140000 years.  The deposition of the GGSM 

formation in Feature 06 during high sea levels about 120000 years before present (BP), the 

gradual progress of the last ice advance over a period of some 90000 years, and the deposition of 

the TC formation in Features 06 and 08 about 30000 years BP, and the rapid rise of sea level 

after the last glacial maximum, are illustrated. 

 

 

5.  THE LAST TRANSGRESSIVE SEQUENCE 
 

Figure 3 shows the details of the recovery of sea level from the last glacial maximum 

about 19500 years BP to present levels about 7000 years BP, during which time the Last 

Transgressive Sequence (LTS) was deposited.  For the purposes of the reports on the Features

of Block J, the LTS sediments have been subdivided into four units.  The first unit, LTS1, consists 

of lagoonal or embayment deposits, typically seen in Feature 06.  LTS2 consists of shoreface 

deposits and is usually overlain by the shallow shelf deposits of LTS3.  The LTS 4 deposits are 

the modern sandy muds of the middle shelf. 

Of importance to the geological history of Feature 08 is firstly the stand of sea level at 

about –120 metres (Figure 3), for about 2500 years from 22000 BP.  During this sea level stand 

most of Feature 08 would have been above sea level, and possibly the TC Fm was still being 

deposited.  However, extensive gravels were being eroded from the exposed Middle and Upper 

Miocene Units in a shallow shoreface environment, and were carried shorewards, as sea levels 

gradually rose, in the form of longitudinal accumulations or "gravel waves".  These seem to 

originate from one or more strata near the top of the Middle Unit.  The sea level rose quite rapidly 

from –120 to –110 metres during the 500 years between 19500 and 19000 BP.  The sea level 

then stood at –110 metres for about 1000 years.  At that time the beach line would have been 

about 5 metres above the scarp of the Basal Miocene Unit, so it seems unlikely that the scarp, 

and the gullying, were formed at that time.  Thus they probably were formed during an earlier 

depression of sea level, of which there were many during the previous 2.5 million years. 

There was then a sea level stand at about –105 metres from 18000 to 14500 BP, during 

which time the water depths over Feature 08 would have been in the order of 15 to 20 metres.  

The loose gravel deposits adjacent to the east of the southern Basement outcrop were probably 

deposited at that time.  Thereafter, sea level rapidly rose, eventually attaining its present level 

about 7000 years ago. 

It is of note that sediments of the LTS are poorly represented in the vibracores from 

Feature 08.  However, this would agree with the sea level history described above, in which the 

shoreline, after standing below the general levels of Feature 08, rapidly traversed the area to 

higher levels. The gravel waves mentioned above, formed during lower sea levels, were left 

behind by the rapid rise in sea level, becoming "lag gravel waves".  Similarly, the LTS deposits 

were incompletely redistributed because of the rapid rise of sea level across the area.  The sea 

level rose to reach its present state about 7000 BP, in the course of which shallow shelf and 

middle shelf sediments were deposited on Feature 08 as a discontinuous veneer. 

  

 

6.  PROPOSED PHASE 3 SAMPLING 
 
6.1  Sampling Target Areas 
 

Phases 1 and 2 sampling in Feature 08, in 2001 and 2002, established that the (now 

recognised as) Terrestrial-Colluvial (TC) Formation in the vicinity of the Basal Miocene outcrop 

contains many diamonds.  The results and findings of all the previous sampling and geophysical 



Page 14 of 18 

work were detailed in a NI 43-101 report in 2006 5.  That report concluded that a distinct 

"mineralised area", comprising some 1.5 km², exists within Feature 08.  At that time, the 

mineralised area was thought to comprise valley lag gravels adjacent to the outcrop of the basal 

Tertiary strata.  However, as a result of the vibracoring later in 2006, the ages of many of the 

formations have been established.  It is now known that the longitudinal outcrop in Feature 08, 

previously thought to be Eocene in age, is in fact Miocene.  It is now also clear that what were 

previously thought to be valley lag gravels are in fact terrestrial/colluvial deposits of the TC 

formation.  The vibracores showed that they contain abundant ORS pebbles, which indicate an 

Eocene origin, and also derived Eocene oysters. 

The ages of the deposits in Feature 08, and their true geological nature, has now been 

established.  However, the fundamental geological model for feature 08, in which diamonds were 

released from an older source that has an elongate coast-parallel outcrop, and their concentration 

in a younger formation adjacent to seawards of the older formation, has not changed. 

As explained in the 2006 report 6, the quality of the phase 1 and phase 2 sampling was 

inadequate to support the estimation of Inferred Resources.    The sampling equipment that will 

be used for the phase 3 programme will be more powerful than that previously used, and will take 

a larger sample.  It is therefore intended that the phase 3 sampling programme will re-visit the 

areas previously sampled in phases 1 and 2.  Therefore the actual (now known as) Basal 

Miocene formation, the TC formation, and its possible extension to seawards of the vibracore 

sites, now form the primary target for sampling.  The extent of this primary target is shown in Map 

12.  This target area, which is about 6.3 square kilometres in size, encloses the "mineralised area" 

of the 2006 report and extends to the north and south of it, as shown in Map 13.  It is not expected 

that the target area will eventually prove to be totally mineralised, but as a result of the more 

powerful nature of the phase 3 sampling equipment, the former mineralised area might be 

expanded and enhanced.  However, the primary target area should not at this stage be 

considered as an expansion of the potential deposit area.   

One conclusion of the 2006 report was that there is a potential for up to 1 600 000 carats 

in a long narrow deposit, some 11.5 square kilometres in size, extending from Feature 08 to the 

northern and southern boundaries of Block J.  The fundamentals of the model for Feature 08 as 

set out in the 2006 report have not changed, in spite of more accurate dating and better 

geological understanding from the vibracoring.  Therefore that conclusion is still valid and is 

supported by the new information.  The proposed phase 3 target area for Feature 08 includes 

some of the 11.5 square kilometres of the 2006 report, and is intended to test and enhance the 

earlier conclusions. 

In addition to the above, other formations within Feature 08 are potentially diamondiferous.

Coast and filling one of the drainage systems leading from the coastal plain onto the continental 

shelf, are potentially diamondiferous and they, and any surficial sediments derived from them, 

should be tested by sampling.  Their incorporation into sampling target areas results from the 

dating of the vibracores, which showed that they are of an age that makes them potentially 

diamondiferous.  However, their proposed sampling is designed, in round 1, to test for potentially 

economic diamond content, so at this stage they should not be considered as an extension to the 

potential deposits. 

Further to seawards, it has been noted that the Middle and Upper Miocene Units contain 

sparse gravels with dark agates and jaspers.  As stated earlier, the origin of this material is 

ambivalent, but it should be tested for diamond content as the black agates and jaspers are of 

exotic origin.  As with the Valley Fill deposits, round 1 sampling in that area should be regarded as 

testing for diamond content. 

   

6.2  Proposed Sampling Pattern 
 

The objective of the sampling within the primary target area will be the establishment of an 

"Inferred Resource" in conformity with the terms of Canadian Rule 43-101.  It is generally 

accepted that the typical patchy distribution of diamonds in marine alluvials dictates that each 

individual sample should have a large "footprint" to enable reliable estimation of resources.  It is 

therefore planned that the footprint of each individual sample will be 10m². 

It should be noted that it has been decided by the Afri-Can Resources Development Team 

to establish a local co-ordinate system covering Block J, oriented 040º from north, to optimise the 

line and sample orientation for the trend of the deposits in Block J.  This local system is 

designated the "Block J L-S System" (for Line–Sample) and has its origin at UTM coordinates X = 

492000, Y = 7170000.  This orientation is also operationally advantageous in terms of the 

prevailing wind and sea-state conditions.  As a result of this decision, the sampling programme for 

Feature 06, as set out in an earlier report7, will be re-oriented before sampling operations 

commence. 

The proposed sampling pattern for Feature 08 is shown in Map 14.  The programme is 

concentrated on the primary target area, with lines of samples 800 metres apart and samples at 

100 metres intervals.  Between these lines are samples 200 metres apart to determine the along-

strike continuity of the deposits.   A single line is proposed with samples at 200 metres to test the 

Middle and Upper Miocene Units as well as the gravel waves in the offshore area.  A pattern of 

samples at 200 metres intervals is proposed to test the Valley Fill deposits, and five samples will 

test the gravel deposits inshore of the southern basement outcrop.  The total number of samples 

proposed for the first round of sampling is 167.

The sampling programme will be conducted in a flexible manner.  The areas to be 

sampled will be prioritised before sampling commences, and the conduct of the programme will 

be modified according to the ongoing sampling results, which will be available on a day-to-day 

basis. 

 

 

7.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
7.1  Geological History of Feature 08 
 

The geological history of Feature 08 includes the following significant events: 

• A major ancient drainage system from the continent crosses the centre of the lease 

area EPL 2499 (Block J).  The age of this system might be as old as about 300Ma.  

A similar valley crosses the southern part of the lease. 

• The sediments occupying these valleys are known from dating of the vibracores to 

include material of Eocene age, which means that the valleys were in existence 

when diamonds arrived in the area.  They are now thought to be of potential 

significance, and occur in Feature 08. 

• During the Oligocene epoch, there was a major depression of sea level, and 

Eocene diamondiferous sediments were flushed onto the present continental shelf 

area. 

• Recovery of sea level during the Miocene resulted in deposition of Basal Miocene 

sediments containing diamonds derived from the earlier sediments.  These are well 

represented in Feature 08.  Formerly they were thought to be basal Eocene, but 

information from the vibracores has shown that they are Miocene. 

• During lowered sea levels as the ice sheets advanced for the last time, previous 

diamondiferous deposits were eroded, re-worked, and deposited as the 

Terrestrial/Colluvial Formation.  This unit, formerly thought to be valley gravel lag 

deposits, has been shown by the vibracores to be terrestrial-colluvial deposits. 

Previous phases 1 and 2 sampling in Feature 08 has shown that they are very 

diamondiferous. 

• Rising sea levels, following the glacial maximum, passed relatively rapidly across 

Feature 08, and nearshore deposits of the Last Transgressive Sequence (LTS) are 

uncommon in Feature 8.

7.2  Sampling Targets and Proposed Sampling Programme 
 

• Although the ages and more accurate geological origins for the deposits have been 

determined from the vibracores, the fundamental geological model, as described in 

previous reports, has not changed. 

• The primary sampling target identified in Feature 08 is about 6.3 square kilometres 

in area and includes an area of 1,5 square kilometres shown to be mineralised by 

the previous sampling.  The primary target includes the Basal Miocene Unit, which 

rests upon the Oligocene unconformity, and the TC Formation derived from it.  The 

latter contains abundant ORS pebbles (indicating an Eocene source), derived 

Eocene fossils, and diamonds. 

• The primary target delineated for the phase 3 sampling should not be considered a 

change to the 1.5 square kilometres of mineralised area and the 11.5 square 

kilometres of potential deposit, as the phase 3 work partly includes those areas 

and tests earlier declarations.  

• The 2006 report describing all previous work8 concluded that there is potential for 

up to 1 600 000 carats in a narrow strip extending north and south from Feature 08 

to the lease boundaries.  The new information from the modern geophysics and 

vibracores supports that conclusion.  The proposed sampling target includes 

extensions to the north and south of the known mineralised area in Feature 08 in 

order to test and enhance the earlier conclusions.   

• The Valley Fill sediments occupying the ancient drainage system from the 

continental interior have become a potential target because their age is now 

known.  It is proposed to test to test them as part of the phase 3 round 1 sampling.  

• The Middle and Upper Miocene Units contain gravels with some exotic pebbles 

that might be diamondiferous and therefore represent areas to be tested by 

sampling. 

• A programme, comprising 167 samples for the first round, has been designed to 

evaluate the known deposits and to test the potentially diamondiferous areas.  A 

second round of sampling will follow-up on the results of the first round.     

 
 
7.3  Proposed Vibracoring During Sampling 
 

• The 2006 vibracoring programme yielded a vast amount of information about the 

diamondiferous sediments and their environs.

• It is therefore recommended that a robust vibracoring machine be acquired and 

used simultaneously with the forthcoming sampling programmes. 

• The results from such a programme will provide detailed deposit continuity 

information, supporting the establishment of an Indicated Diamond Resource.  

 

7.4  General Comments 
 

• The geological history of Feature 08 has been established in considerable detail as 

a result of work done in 2006, supported by earlier work. 

• Previous conclusions regarding the potential diamond content of Feature 08 and of 

Block J are supported by the recent results. 

• The way is now clear to establish formal Diamond Resources in Feature 08 

according to NI 43-101.
