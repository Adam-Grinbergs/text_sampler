Technical Report on Energy Fuels Resources Corporation's  
 
Torbyn Property 
 
 
1.0  Summary 
 
The Energy Fuels Resources Company's (EFRC) Torbyn Mine project is located in the 
Tenderfoot Mesa District of the Uravan Mineral Belt, 11.3 miles southeast of Gateway, 
Colorado.  It consists of 156 unpatented claims, covering approximately 3,120 acres.  The 
property is held under a mining lease with Rimrock Exploration and Development, Inc.            
for a 20-year term, which can be extended.  The area was claimed at earlier times by Energy 
Reserves Group.  This district has seen production of radium, vanadium, and uranium ores since 
early in the 20th century.  Numerous underground mines on the Torbyn property, and 
surrounding within one mile of the claim group perimeter, have produced in excess of 294,969 
pounds U3O8 and nearly 1,103,328 pounds V2O5, (Nelson-Moore, 1978).   Production derived 
from fluvial sandstones, mostly in the upper part of the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison 
Formation of Jurassic age.  The last production was in 1980, which ceased due to inadequate 
uranium prices. 
 
In addition to the older mines on the property, the Torbyn Mine was started in 1975 by  
Energy Reserve Group (ERG).  Drilling by ERG and Energy Fuels Resources Corporation shows 
the remaining indicated resources at the Torbyn Mine of 47,858 lbs U3O8 and 239,289 lbs V2O5.  
This is contained in some 9,610 tons of material at a grade diluted to a mining grade of 0.17% 
U3O8 and 0.85% V2O5.  The Sapphire Mine has indicated resources of 36,046 pounds U3O8 and 
144,185 pounds of V2O5 contained in 6,390 tons diluted to a mining grade of 0.189% U3O8 and 
0.76% V2O5.  The land package is large, with an extensive historical mining activity in the area; 
the potential to increase this resource is quite possible.  Evaluation of historic data coupled with 
the EFRC 2007 drill results lead to a geologic inferred resource estimated at 265,000 lbs U3O8.   
The above figure, given to the writer by EFRC, is not to be considered a resource estimate at this 
time and is an indication of what might be present; therefore, the author cannot vouch for the 
inferred resource stated above. 
 
2.0 Introduction and Terms of Reference 
 
Alinco GeoServices, Inc. (AGS) was retained by Energy Fuels Resources Corporation to prepare 
an Independent Technical Report compliant with National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) on the 
Torbyn uranium/vanadium project.  The report has been prepared to meet the requirements of NI 
43-101 and Form 43-101F1. 
 
AGS understands that this report will be used in support of future public offerings by EFRC's 
parent company, Energy Fuels Incorporated. 
 
M. Hassan Alief, CPG #11134, and principal in AGS, visited the surface of the Torbyn property 
on November 27, 2007.

Relevant reports, maps, and data were reviewed and discussed with EFRC staff, principally Mr. 
Richard White who is serving as Vice President of Exploration for the company's Colorado and 
Utah operations and Jane Zimmerman, EFRC staff geologist.  The References section of this 
report lists those documents of importance. 
 
Measurements are in English units (i.e., short tons, feet, or acres), and grades are expressed as 
percent of U3O8 or V2O5. 
 
3.0 Reliance on Other Experts 
 
This report has been prepared by AGS for Energy Fuels Incorporated.  The information, 
conclusions, opinions, and estimates contained herein are based upon information available to 
AGS at the time of report preparation, and certain data, maps and other documents in the 
possession of EFRC from exploration and mining efforts conducted by previous companies in 
the immediate district.  
 
Mr. Richard White, CPG #08792, was instrumental in assisting with the review, discussion, and 
understanding of both the general and site-specific geology of the Tenderfoot Mesa Mining 
District.  Jane Zimmerman supervised the EFRC 2007 drill project and significantly contributed 
to geologic interpretation and resource estimation. 
 
AGS reviewed a copy of the original contract and a subsequent contract for the acquisition of 
some more claims. It appears that the claims have been properly located and that a subsequent 
lease agreement with Rimrock Exploration and Development, Inc. (the underlying claim holder) 
conveyed to EFRC all possessory rights in the Torbyn claim group.  AGS did not review any 
legal documents concerning the claims, permitting and reclamation status of the Torbyn 
property.  
 
4.0 Property Location and Description 
 
The Torbyn property consists of 156 unpatented lode claims located in the Tenderfoot Mesa 
Mining District, some 11.3 miles southeast of Gateway, Colorado. (Figure 4-1). The claims lie in 
sections 19, 20, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, T51N, R18W, NMPM Mesa County, Colorado. The area 
encompassed by the claims is approximately 3,120 acres and is covered almost entirely by the 
U.S. Geological Survey Gateway, Colo. Quadrangle-7 ½ minute topographic map with the 
extreme eastern part of the group located on the Pine Mountain Quadrangle (Figure 4-2). This 
land is administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The claims were staked over a 
period of time ranging from January, 2005 through May, 2006. The Torbyn Mine portal is 
located at latitude 380 39' 51" N, longitude 1080 54' 19" W, at an elevation of 6,820 feet. 
 
The claims were staked on the ground and filed with Mesa County and the BLM. The subsequent 
year's BLM maintenance fees have been paid.  Energy Fuels Resources Corporation entered into 
an option to lease the Torbyn group with Rimrock Exploration and Development, Inc. on July 1, 
2006 for a term of twenty years, which is extendable if mineral production is on a continuing 
basis.  Payments consist of $500.00 per mining claim for the first 60 mining claims and $400.00 

 4



for each mining claim in excess of 60 claims.  Energy Fuels Resources Corporation pays the 
annual BLM and county maintenance fees.  An annual work commitment of $50,000 is required, 
or once production commences, EFRC will commit to spend at least 10% of the gross value of 
the ore produced at the mine for exploration of the Mining Claims. There is an annual advanced 
royalty of $20,000.00 to be paid at the beginning of the fourth year, which is credited against the 
production royalties.  The production royalty is 5% based on the market value of the minerals 
recovered.   
  
The mine can currently operate under a permit acquired by Rimrock Exploration and 
Development Inc. as a Notice of Intent to Conduct Prospecting approved by the Colorado 
Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety (DRMS) and the Grand Junction office of BLM, as 
well as necessary approvals from Mesa County.  The NOI covers rehabilitation work and allows 
for bulk sampling up to 1,000 tons, which in effect allows production of this quantity of 
mineralized material and any waste rock necessary for rehabilitation. Stabilization of the portal 
(new timber and gate) was completed in the summer of 2006. The mine is located approximately 
130 miles from the Denison White Mesa Mill at Blanding, Utah.  It would be about 65 miles to 
the mill proposed by Energy Fuels near Naturita, Colorado. 
 
5.0 Access and Physiography 
 
The Torbyn Mine portal is located in the west central part of the claim group.  It is accessed by 
driving 3.8 miles northeast from the Gateway Post Office on Colorado Highway 141 to Mesa 
County Road 6 3/10 Rd, turn and head east for about 5 miles, to the intersection with Mesa 
County 10 8/10 Rd., then proceed southeast for nearly 5 miles. Take the northern road into the 
tributary canyon to get to the portal in 0.30 miles. These county roads are mostly graded dirt with 
short graveled sections.  They are not presently maintained during the winter months, road 
maintenance would therefore be necessary.  No permanent structures exist at the site.   
                
Gateway, Colorado, is a very small town currently undergoing a transition from agriculture to a 
tourist-based economy.  Recently-completed Gateway Canyons Resort includes a grocery store, 
recreational store and tour center, motel, restaurant, car museum, small convention center, and 
employee housing for part of the facility staff.  Additional resort-type facilities are currently 
being built.   
 
The region is characterized by mesas cut by deep canyons. There are narrow benches on the 
mesa shoulders in some areas and near-vertical, 500-foot cliffs elsewhere.  Elevations within the 
claim group range from 7,600 feet in the northeastern part to 6,500 feet near the canyon rim in 
the southwestern part.  However, the elevation drops to 4,560 feet at Gateway, Colorado, where 
Highway 141 crosses the Dolores River. Tenderfoot Mesa drains mainly to the southwest into 
Larsen Canyon, to the south into Bull Canyon, and to the east into Maverick Canyon; all are 
tributaries to the Dolores River. 
 
The area is semiarid.  All elevations support moderate growths of juniper and pinõn in rocky 
soils along with sage and other brush, forbs, and grasses.  Where soils are rich in the higher 
elevations and northern slopes, there are stands of ponderosa pine and oak brush.

6.0 History 
 
Ores in this and other parts of the Uravan Mineral Belt were mined intensively in the early 20th 
century for radium (about 1914-1923).  The Gateway/Tenderfoot Mesa District of the Mineral 
Belt was mostly idle from the 1920's until about 1937 when several mills, including a small one 
at Gateway (Gateway Alloys, Inc.), were built to process the ore for its vanadium content.  
Uranium became the emphasis of the district when the U.S. Army's Manhattan Project came to 
the area in 1943.  The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) purchased concentrates from several 
area mills from 1947 through 1970 (Chenoweth, 1981).  Mining diminished until the mid 1970's 
when the private market price of uranium began rising to record levels.  The area boomed until 
1980 when the uranium price decline brought on by the Three Mile Island nuclear plant incident 
made most mining unprofitable.  Since the 1940's, the vanadium price was never sufficiently 
high to make mining practical for the vanadium content alone, even though it is about 3-4 times 
the uranium content in the Gateway area ores.  However, the value of the vanadium as a by-
product has always been important to uranium mining within the Uravan Mineral Belt.  
 
Production of several mines on, and surrounding, the Torbyn property is shown in Table 6-1 
(Nelson-Moore, et al, 1978) mostly for the period up to 1971, when the AEC stopped purchasing 
uranium. 
 
Besides demand and price forces, the mining history of the Torbyn property is also tied to 
technology advances, particularly in exploration drilling and rubber-tired underground mining 
equipment.  Deposits were discovered in exposures of carnotite mineralization in the canyon 
rims early on.  Many small adits were driven for prospecting, the successful ones becoming the 
numerous mines listed in Table 6-1.  The preferred method, at least into the 1960's, was to use 
tracked haulage equipment at or slightly below the ore elevation.  Where the dip of the ore-
bearing sandstones became steeper than track equipment could negotiate, the ore above was 
accessed by raises and mined with slushers, draw points, and chutes to fill the rail cars below. 
Ore that was found below track level was sometimes accessed by steep track declines wherein a 
hoist was used to pull cars back up to the haulage level.  Advancements in rubber-tired haulage 
equipment and loaders in the 1960's allowed the ore to be followed to changing elevations with 
ease and was much less labor intensive.  It also allowed for easier removal of the waste generated 
in the split-shooting method needed to selectively mine the thin ore lenses. 
 
Shallow exploration drilling was conducted on the benches, along with some up to 50 feet long 
long-hole drilling underground. Mining followed ore into areas of deeper cover as drill rigs 
improved.  
 
The Torbyn Mine was originally called the Black Mama Mine. When Energy Reserve Group 
found mineralization to the east, they changed the name to Peaches.  When Rimrock Exploration 
and Development restaked the ground in 2005-2006, the BLM requested a name change, thusly 
Torbyn.  
 
Mike Ince of Gateway mined the Black Mama Mine in the 1970s.  The reported production from 
1971 Geological Survey Report, lists 18,557 tons at 0.28% U3O8 (103,607 lbs) and 1.09% V2O5 
(404,305 lbs) located in the middle rim sands of the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison 

 6



Formation.  Energy Reserve Group (ERG) bought the property in 1975. They drilled and 
developed reserves to the east of the Black Mama Mine.  Using the Black Mama portal, ERG 
continued past the end of the Black Mama drift driving a 3% incline for 1100' until reaching the 
mineralization in the top rim sands of the Salt Wash.  They called the mine the Peaches; mining 
continued until the price dropped in 1980. (William G. Merrill; ERG geologist, personnel 
communication.)     
 
The Sapphire Mine portal lies 8,500 feet south east of the Torbyn Mine portal.  Originally named 
the Harvey Mine, the mine name was changed by Rimrock Exploration and Development when 
they staked the claims.  The production from the mine prior to 1971 is 765 tons at 0.39% U3O8 
(6005 lbs) and 1.14% V2O5 (17,632 lbs) located in the middle rim sands of the Salt Wash. 
(Nelson-Moore et al, 1978). 
  
John I. Schumacher had the Bujan Mine, south of the Torbyn, in the middle 60's. Before the 70's 
it was named the Buick, the named used in the production sheet. The production from this mine 
came to 2,853 tons at 0.18% U3O8 (10,305 lbs) and 0.63% V2O5 (36,092 lbs).  Strategic Minerals 
Exploration Co. named their claims the Cash claims. By 1980, twenty-four hundred feet south of 
the Buick Mine, Pioneer Uravan Inc. had the Cash #6 Claim. Pioneer quit mining in 1983 and 
reported drill-indicated resources left in place of 327 tons of 0.221% U3O8 (1,445 lbs). 
    
With the increase in the uranium and vanadium prices, Rimrock Exploration and Development 
Corporation staked the ground in the winter of 2005-2006.  They acquired a Prospecting NOI 
Permit, reopened and secured the portal with bat grate doors.  In July of 2006, Energy Fuels 
Resources Corporation leased the group of 156 Torbyn claims.          
 
The Torbyn Mine could be rehabilitated, developed, and made ready for production within about 
six months.  Mining will be conducted by conventional rubber-tired underground drill-blast-
muck methods in a random room-and-pillar configuration (reflecting the geometry of the deposit 
as found during mining). 
 
The Sapphire Mine would also need around six months for rehabilitation and portal reopening.  
 
7.0 Geologic Setting 
 

7.1 Regional Geology 
 
The Colorado Plateau covers nearly 130,000 square miles in the Four Corners region. (Figure 7-
1). The Torbyn and other properties currently held by Energy Fuels Resources Corporation 
(EFRC) lie in the Canyon Lands Section in the central and east-central part of the Plateau in 
Utah and Colorado.  The Plateau's basement rocks are mostly Proterozoic metamorphics and 
igneous intrusions.  The area was relatively stable throughout the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras 
with minor uplifts, subsidences, and tiltings resulting in fairly flat-lying sedimentary rocks 
ranging from evaporites, limestones, and marine clastic sediments, through eolian sandstones, to 
detritus of fluvial systems. The Uncompahgre Uplift, three miles northeast of the Torbyn claims, 
was active during the late Paleozoic so that Pennsylvanian through early Jurassic sedimentary 

 7



rocks wedge out against the pre-Cambrian crystalline rocks. This thick stratigraphic sequence to 
the southwest is interrupted locally by salt-cored anticlines in the Paradox Basin area, basement 
fault-related monoclines, and Tertiary/Late Cretaceous laccolith intrusions.  The salt anticlines 
are elongated in a northwest-southeasterly direction similar to the Uncompahgre Uplift.  Flowage 
of the salt was erratically active from Permian through late Jurassic, thereby affecting deposition 
of the Triassic and early Jurassic sediments, including the flow of the streams that deposited the 
Morrison formation.  The Uncompahgre Plateau was again faulted upward in Tertiary time and 
deep canyon cutting occurred, continuing through the Pleistocene.  Some twenty-six miles to the 
southwest of the Torbyn Mine area lay the La Sal Mountains.  These consist of Tertiary 
laccoliths intruded into several different horizons of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. Figure 7-2 is a 
stratigraphic column of the rock units exposed in the Gateway, Colorado area. 
  
Major uranium deposits of the east-central Colorado Plateau occur principally in two of the 
fluvial sequences.  The older one is located at or near the base of the upper Triassic Chinle 
Formation.  Areas of uranium deposits occur where the basal Chinle consists of channels filled 
with sandstone and conglomerate that scoured into the underlying sediments. This channel 
system is known as the Shinarump Member in southern Utah.  Farther north in eastern Utah, the 
basal member of the Chinle is a younger channel system known as the Moss Back.  The Chinle 
deposition followed a period of tilting and erosion; therefore, the basal contact is an angular 
unconformity.  Where the Chinle channels are in contact with sandstones of the Permian Cutler 
Formation, good uranium deposits locally occur in the Cutler, as well.  The basal Chinle beds at 
the Torbyn property are greater than 2,300 feet deep.  Channel sandstones are absent in 
exposures in the nearby canyons, and therefore no Chinle uranium resources are known for the 
Torbyn property.   
 
The other significant Colorado Plateau uranium deposits occur in the late Jurassic Morrison 
Formation.  The Morrison comprises two members in the Gateway, Colorado area.  The lower 
member, the Salt Wash, is the main uranium host.  The upper part of the Morrison is the Brushy 
Basin Member. The Salt Wash consists of about equal amounts of fluvial sandstones and 
mudstones deposited by meandering river systems.  The Brushy Basin was deposited mostly as a 
large mud flat probably with many lakes and streams.  Much of the material deposited to form 
the Brushy Basin originated from volcanic activity to the west.  The majority of the uranium 
production has come from the upper sandstones of the Salt Wash Member known as the Top 
Rim.  
 
Uranium occurrences have been found throughout most of the Colorado Plateau; however, there 
are numerous belts and districts where the deposits are larger and more closely spaced. (Figure 7-
3). In addition to the uranium, many of the deposits contain considerable amounts of vanadium.  
In fact, in some districts the vanadium content is ten times or more the uranium content.  In 
general, the Cutler and Shinarump ores contain very little vanadium, whereas the Salt Wash 
deposits usually contain large amounts of vanadium.  The V2O5:U3O8 ratio averages about 4:1, 
and can range up to 15:1 in the Uravan Mineral Belt.  The economics of the Salt Wash deposits 
are therefore enhanced by the vanadium content, even when vanadium prices are lower than at 
present.  The Tenderfoot Mesa/Gateway District of the Uravan Mineral Belt, where the Torbyn is 
located, generally has a V2O5:U3O8 of about 4:1 ratio.   Past production is shown in Table 6-1 
and Figure 7-4 shows the surface geology of Tenderfoot Mesa and the location of surrounding 

 8



mines.  The ratio value used for resource calculations when direct vanadium assays are absent is 
the average of the reported production in Table 6-1, namely 3.74:1. 
 
 7.2 Local Geologic Detail 
 
Geologic units exposed on the Torbyn property range from the lower cliff of the white Jurassic 
Navajo Formation, Jurassic Entrada Sandstone, upwards to the Summerville, now named the 
Wanakah Formation and the Tidwell Member of the Morrison Formation (O'Sullivan, 1984), to 
the Morrison Formation which comprises two members, the lower is the Salt Wash sandstone 
member and the upper is the Brushy Basin shale member, on to the top of the mesas which are 
capped by the Cretaceous Burro Canyon (Figures 7-4 and 7-5).  On the lower cliffs and slopes of 
Tenderfoot Mesa there are good exposures of the red beds of the Permian Cutler Formation, 
Triassic Moenkopi, Chinle, Wingate, and Kayenta Formations. There are no exposed basal 
Chinle conglomerates that are the favorable type for uranium deposits.  A good description of the 
Morrison Formation, as summarized below, can be found in Cadigan, 1967.      
 
The Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation consists of interbedded fluvial sandstones 
(about 60%) and floodplain-type mudstone units (40%).  The sandstone units crop out as cliffs or 
rims while the mudstones form slopes. The Top Rim sandstone is more continuous and tends to 
be thicker than the middle rim and bottom rim sands. These sands are more lenticular, 
discontinuous, and interbedded with mudstone splits.  The mineralization in the Black Mama 
Mine and the Sapphire Mine is in the Middle Rim.   Mineralization in the Torbyn and the new 
drilling around the Torbyn is in oxidized Top Rim sands, which also hosts the largest deposits in 
the Uravan Mineral Belt.  At Tenderfoot Mesa, the Salt Wash is 280-340 feet thick.   
 
The streams that deposited the sandstones flowed mostly in large meander belts across an 
aggrading, partly eroded plain with varying subsidence rates.  The source area for most of the 
Morrison Formation was a highland about 450 miles to the southwest. The rocks eroding in the 
source area included volcanic, intrusive igneous, metamorphic, and minor sedimentary strata. 
Salt Wash streams flowed generally northeastward; however, some of the channels systems were 
obviously locally diverted by contemporaneous uplifting of the salt-cored anticlines. The 
Uncompahgre Uplift probably also contained remnant high areas that turned the direction of the 
stream flows, resulting in the east-southeasterly aspect of the Uravan Mineral Belt at the 
Gateway District (north end).  The Salt Wash sandstones are usually very fine to fine grained.  
They are varieties of orthoquartzite, arkose, and tuffs.  Major detrital components are quartz, 
feldspars, and rock fragments.  Minor components include clays, micas, zircon, tourmaline, 
garnet, titanium and iron minerals.  The cement is authigenic silicates, calcite, gypsum, iron 
oxides, and clays. 
  
Much of the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation (90%) is mudstone, claystone, 
and siltstone composed of clays derived from detrital glassy volcanic debris from volcanic 
activity to the southwest.  This material settled on the same large floodplain where the Salt Wash 
streams had flowed, and deposited fine-grained clastic material interbedded with a few channel 
sandstones and conglomerates, the latter indicating more rapid subsidence than during Salt Wash 
time.  The Brushy Basin also contains a few thin fresh-water limestone beds, some of which have 
been silicified. Devitrification of the volcanic ash may have been a major source of the uranium 

 9



that leached downward into the Top Rim sandstones.  The Brushy Basin is about 350 feet thick 
on the claims.  It is overlain by the Lower Cretaceous conglomerates, sandstones, and shales of 
the Burro Canyon Formation which is approximately 40-80 feet thick.   
 
The Salt Wash sandstones exhibit several facies and sedimentary features.  These features can be 
seen in some outcrops, sometimes in drill cores, and in underground mines. However, these 
features are usually thin enough that they cannot be identified in borehole logs, such as neutron 
or resistivity logs.  Large cross-bedding is common indicating stream thalwegs.  Flat, thin 
bedding of low energy areas can be seen along with apparent levies and crevasse splays.  
Channel scouring is also common as is the associated point bar deposits of the meandering 
streams.  The point bars are characterized by mudstone galls which are rip-up clasts from the 
scouring on the outside of the previous meander.  The sand grains become finer upward.  There 
are often abundant logs and other plant material in the point bars, which make them a prime 
location for uranium deposits. 
 
Fossils in the Morrison include petrified wood and carbonized plant material; dinosaur bones, 
tracks, and embryos; and sparse microfossils in the thin fresh-water limestone beds. 
               
The beds on Tenderfoot Mesa dip gently to the southwest at 1-3 degrees.  Even though the main 
fault bounding the Uncompahgre uplift is less than three miles northeast of the Torbyn group, the 
area was little affected by the Uncompahgre or La Sal related faulting. The south tip of 
Tenderfoot Mesa is near the axis of the Dolores River Syncline (Cater, 1955) which is the 
northwest trending syncline between the Paradox Valley salt-cored anticline and the 
Uncompahgre uplift. 
 
8.0 Deposit Details 
 
The Torbyn and other Gateway/Tenderfoot Mesa district uranium-vanadium deposits are typical 
of the Uravan Mineral Belt type.  The Uravan Mineral Belt was defined as a curved, elongated 
area in southwestern Colorado where the uranium-vanadium deposits in the Salt Wash Member 
of the Morrison Formation generally have closer spacing, larger size, and higher grade than those 
in adjacent areas and the region as a whole (Fischer and Hilpert, 1952). The location and shape 
of mineralized deposits is largely controlled by the permeability of the host sandstone and 
primary structures of the host sandstones.  Most mineralization is in trends where Top Rim 
sandstones are thick, usually 40 feet or greater. 
 
Most of the Mineral Belt area consists of oxidized sediments of the Morrison Formation, 
exhibiting red, hematite-rich rocks.  Individual deposits are localized in areas of reduced, gray 
sandstone and gray or green mudstone. The Morrison sediments accumulated as oxidized detritus 
in the fluvial environment. However, there were isolated environments where reduced conditions 
existed, such as oxbow lakes and carbon-rich point bars.  During early burial and diagenesis, the 
through-flowing ground water within the large, saturated pile of Salt Wash and Brushy Basin 
material remained oxidized, thereby transporting uranium in solution.  When the uranium-rich 
waters encountered the zones of trapped reduced waters, the uranium precipitated.  Vanadium 
may have been leached from the iron-titanium mineral grains and subsequently deposited along 
with or prior to the uranium.  

 10



 
The exposed, remnant mineralization in the old mines that have been examined show habits 
typical of the Uravan Mineral Belt deposits.  Where the sandstone has thin, flat beds, the 
mineralization is usually tabular.  In the more massive sections, it rolls across the bedding, 
reflecting the mixing of two waters.  This accounts for the fact that there are several horizons 
within the Top Rim that are mineralized. Very thin clay layers on cross beds appear to have 
retarded ground water flow which enhanced uranium precipitation.  The beds immediately above 
mineralized horizons sometimes contain abundant carbonized plant material and green or gray 
clay galls.  The mudstone beds adjacent to mineralized sandstone are reduced, but can grade to 
oxidized within a few feet.  The deposits exposed in the limited workings of the Torbyn Mine 
show these same characteristics.  There are no significant differences between mineral 
depositional habits in the Top Rim and those in the Middle Rim sands.  Figure 8-1 is a map 
showing the blocks used for the Torbyn Mine resource estimation based on the 2007 drilling by 
EFRC and historic drill information.  Figure 8-2 is a map showing drill holes, underground mine 
workings and resource estimates of the Sapphire Mine.  
 
The thickness, the gray color, pyrite and carbon content of sandstones along with gray or green 
mudstone were recognized by early workers and have served as exploration guides (Thamm, et 
al, 1981). 
 
9.0 Mineralization 
 
The uranium and vanadium bearing minerals occur as fine grained coatings on the detrital grains, 
they fill pore spaces between the sand grains, and they replace carbonaceous material.  The 
principle uranium mineral is carnotite (K2(UO2)2(VO4)2.5-8H2O),  the oxide of uranium and 
vanadium, other oxide minerals may include, calcium and potassium uranyl vanadates, 
tyuyamunite, corvusite, rauvite and pascoite (Weeks, et al, 1959).  Where the host rock horizon 
is under deeper parts of Tenderfoot Mesa, there is likely primary uranium and vanadium 
minerals, namely pitchblende and montroseite, respectively.   
 
Some stopes in the Torbyn Mine are over 200 feet long and 50-60 feet wide.  Individual 
mineralized beds vary in thickness from several inches up to three or four feet. (Figure 8-1) 
   
10.0 Exploration 
 
Outcrops were explored by prospectors in the early 20th century. The Torbyn claim group is 
composed of properties previously held separately by Energy Reserve Group (known as the 
Peaches claims).   
 
All of the past drilling was completed before 1980. 
 
Portions of the Torbyn Mine were explored by longhole drilling as mining was in progress. Some 
of the mineralized material found by this method near the end of the last mining episode remains 
in place. 
 

 11



Throughout the history of the Peaches production there have been no reports of disequilibrium 
problems with the ore.  (personal communication; Clive Bailey, Lease Mine Coordinator (ore 
buyer) for Energy Fuels Nuclear, for the White Mesa Mill, 1978-1979). 
 
Energy Fuels has not conducted any underground exploration other than cursory examinations 
and limited rib-scanning in the Torbyn Mine.  EFRC conducted a surface rotary drilling program 
in the fall of 2007. 
 
11.0 Drilling 
 
Most of the drilling on the Torbyn property was performed by previous operators.  Over 200 
holes have been drilled by these operators on the Torbyn property.  The area contains holes 
drilled by the U.S. Geological Survey in the late 1940's and early 1950's, which were associated 
with the Atomic Energy Commission work.  Holes drilled by Energy Reserve Group in the 
1970's were rotary holes.  EFRC has come into possession of several maps, including drill hole 
and Salt Wash sandstone isopach maps (both Top and Middle Rim), but not the gamma/neutron 
electric logs or the lithologic logs.  The Energy Reserve Group drill maps are deemed to be 
accurate.  However, without logs it is not possible to verify calculations of mineral intercepts.   
 
EFRC conducted a 37-hole drilling program in the fall of 2007, offsetting mineralization in the 
Torbyn Mine area, the Black Mama, and the Sapphire Mine Area, (Figure 8-1 and 8-2). Two 
holes offset the southern portion of the Torbyn mine.  These encountered 1.5' of 0.539 % U3O8.  
About 150' further south is another hole with 3.6' of 0.367 % U3O8.  The area remains open to 
the south for another 520 feet. Cuttings were logged with particular attention to sandstone color, 
carbon content, and interbedded mudstone characteristics.  The holes were probed using a natural 
gamma tool along with resistivity and spontaneous potential logs when the holes contained 
water.  An induction tool was used in holes that were dry.  All holes were also logged with a 
deviation tool.  Even though the digitally recorded data displays estimated eU3O8 content, the 
gamma logs were interpreted and mineralization calculated using the AEC method (area under 
the curve times the k factor equals the grade times thickness (Scott et al., 1960)).  It is believed 
that previous operators also used this method, or a close variant of it.  The Colorado Plateau 
Logging tools were calibrated at the U.S. DOE test pits in Grand Junction, Colorado in May, 
2007.  A follow-up calibration run at the Grand Junction pits in October, 2007 showed no 
statistical difference between calibrations. 
 
The property boundary is extensive and there are many old mines located around the cliff 
perimeter.  Extremely good potential exists for an extension of mineralization from a past 
producer or an entirely new mineralized body that could be found with future drilling.        
 
 
12.0 Sampling Method and Approach 
 
The estimation of mineral resources in this report has relied upon documentation from earlier 
operators.  EFRC employed a conventional combination of rotary drilling, geologic logging, 
downhole electric, directional, and radiometric logging and assayed drill cuttings when 
mineralized. 

 12



   
13.0 Sample Preparation, Analyses, Security 
 
The results of historical preparation techniques and analyses have been relied upon as being 
reasonably accurate.  These tasks were performed by companies experienced in uranium 
exploration, sampling, and analytical methods, and the presentation of the summary data appears 
to be in conformity with technological standards at the time. 
 
14.0 Data Verification 
 
No verification of the historical data has been conducted.  EFRC does not currently possess 
geologic or downhole logs from any of the previous operators.  The 2007 EFRC drill holes were 
planned as exploration holes; therefore, none were located as verification twin holes to historic 
drilling. 
 
15.0 Adjacent Properties 
 
Tenderfoot Mesa is a mesa isolated by the canyons cut on all sides.  The Salt Wash Member of 
the Morrison Formation has been removed by erosion in these canyons.  Since the Torbyn claim 
group occupies nearly the entire mesa top, there is very little potential for other claims to cover 
the host horizon.  Therefore, there are no claims adjacent to the EFRC property. 
 
 
16.0 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 
The Tenderfoot Mesa/Gateway district of the Uravan Mineral Belt has a long history of uranium 
and vanadium production. Deposits from this district have been successfully milled at Union 
Carbide's (Umetco) mill at Uravan, Colorado, the Climax Uranium mill in Grand Junction, 
Colorado, the Atlas mill at Moab, Utah, and International Uranium Corporation's mill in 
Blanding, Utah (now owned by Denison); therefore, it is believed at this point that the Torbyn 
mineralization deposit will present no unforeseen problems with either metallurgical testing or 
processing. 
 
17.0 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 
 
Mineral resources have been calculated by the polygonal method.  Polygons are drawn as 
perpendicular bisectors between drill holes.  The drilling is randomly-spaced, being about 40 
foot centers near the old workings of the Torbyn and Sapphire Mines, to 75 foot centers in many 
areas, and greater than 100 foot spacing elsewhere.  Therefore, the resource polygons enclose 
varying area; the polygons are smaller where drill spacing is closer, and some extend as much as 
50 feet away from a drill hole. For the in situ resource estimate, the thickness and grade assigned 
to each polygon equals that of the intercepts recorded in the center hole of the polygon.  A 
tonnage factor of 14 cubic feet per ton is used for Salt Wash deposits. Dilution for mining 
tonnage is one foot of waste for mineralized thicknesses less than 6.0 feet (a resuing or split-shot 
mining approach will be followed to minimize dilution when extracting thin zones), or an 
appropriate fraction of a foot (if the intercept is greater than six feet) up to 7.0 feet, the assumed 

 13



minimum mining thickness. Intercepts greater than 7.0 feet are not diluted for resource 
calculations.  It is conservative to use waste at zero grade for the dilution, since there is often 
lower grade material adjacent to the target mineralized zones.  Sparse data exist on vanadium 
grade; therefore, the intercept is assigned a value based on the historical district average 
V2O5:U3O8 ratio of 3.74:1. The actual grade of vanadium for the Torbyn Property may only be 
determined after coring and mining are done on the property.     
 
Hole locations have been scaled off existing maps prepared by previous operators.  No surveying 
has been done by EFRC.  It would be difficult to locate many of the old holes since most were 
reclaimed more than twenty years ago.  The mineral resource estimates that follow are based on 
general knowledge of the area as well as historic drill records and maps of the companies 
mentioned above.   EFRC geologists are acquainted with many of the project geologists that 
worked these properties during these times and the reputations of those companies doing the 
work.  Therefore, the following resource estimates are believed to be reasonable for the Torbyn 
property. 
 
The total drill indicated resource in the two mine's areas is 83,904 lbs U3O8 and 313,800 lbs 
V2O5. 
 
17.1a Indicated Mineral Resource in the Torbyn Mine Area 
 
The cursory inspection of the Torbyn workings shows at least four areas where unmined 
resources exist in the ribs of the mine.  A combination of historic drill holes and EFRC 2007 drill 
holes also show uranium-vanadium resources near the Torbyn Mine around most of the 
perimeter.  Indicated resources for the Torbyn Mine portion of the property, based on EFRC and 
ERG drilling data is projected to be approximately:  9,610 tons in place at average thickness of 
2.2 ft containing 47,858 pounds U3O8 (0.25%) and 178,988 pounds V2O5 (0.93%) in the upper 
sandstone of the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation. Diluted to a mining thickness, 
this equates to 14,090 tons at 0.17% U3O8 and 0.64% V2O5 (See Table 17-1and Figure 8-1).  
 
The potential, unidentified resource on this claim group is believed to be significant.  
Documented production within this district was in excess of 294,000 lbs U3O8 and over 1 million 
lbs V2O5. (Figure 6-1)  
 

 17.1b Indicated Mineral Resource in the Sapphire Mine Area 
 

The Sapphire Mine's mineralization is in a middle rim sandstone of the Salt Wash.  Much of the 
mineralization continues beyond the workings in a north 650 west direction for 550 feet.  This 
mineralized channel is between 70 and 120 feet wide. Another pod of mineralization is south of 
the workings, about 500 feet northwest of the mine portal (Figure 8-2).  Indicated resources for 
the Sapphire Mine, based on EFRC and ERG drilling data is approximately 6,390 tons in place at 
an average thickness of 2.2 ft., containing 36,046 pounds U3O8 at a grade of 0.28% U3O8 and 
134,813 pounds V2O5 (1.05%).  Diluted to a mining thickness this equates to 9,535 tons at 
0.189% U3O8 and 0.71% V2O5 (Table 17-2). The vanadium grade is calculated as the ratio to the 
uranium grade from the local historical mining grades. It would take about six months to 
refurbish the old workings and open the portal.           

 14



 
17.2  Inferred Resources 

 
ERG constructed isopach maps from their drill data for both the Top Rim and Middle Rim 
channels in the area of the Torbyn (Peaches) Mine and the Sapphire (East Peaches) Mine.  In this 
area, ERG sub-divided the Top Rim, calling the lower portion the "Peaches Sand". The 
discovery of mineralization to the south of the Torbyn mine during the summer drilling season in 
2007 was in the thicker part of the Peaches Sand channel.  This opened up a large undrilled area 
that could increase the Torbyn Mine's resources by over 50,000 pounds U3O8.  This area, Area 
A, is within the northwest-southeast trending Top Rim channel. On the west side of the Torbyn 
mine the Peaches channel sands arc in a more westerly direction as demonstrated by the 
sandstone isopach map.  An additional 15,000 lbs could be added in the Inferred category from 
this area, Area B.  In Area C, which is east to northeast of the Torbyn Mine, the channel sands 
are favorable.  Future drilling could increase the geologic inferred resources here by 10,000 lbs.  
A favorable drill hole, T-07-5, just east of the mine, encountered 0.4 ft of 0.206% U3O8 in the 
top of the middle rim and low grade mineralization in the Top Rim sands.  The sandstones are 
altered (reduced) and have a favorable thickness.  The sandstone isopach map shows the channel 
continuing in this direction. It is reasonable to suggest 20,000 lbs U3O8 in the inferred category 
in this area, Area D. 
 
During the 2007 drilling season, three holes in an area 2,000 feet east of the Torbyn Mine 
encountered very favorable Top Rim sandstones with alteration. This area will be explored 
further by drilling. There are 30,000 lbs U3O8 inferred to exist here in Area E. 
  
To the south of a small spur off of the Sapphire Mine are two mineralized holes. It is expected 
that more drilling to the south of these holes could find as much as 15,000 lbs U3O8.  Therefore, 
that amount of geologic inferred resources is assigned to Area F.   
 
Several mines with past production are located south of the Torbyn Mine area.  Small drill 
indicated resources are known here, but due to their remoteness they are included in geologic 
inferred resources near these mines. Most of these mines were closed in 1983.  On the old Cash 
#6 claim, north of the Protector and Lincoln mines (see Figure 7-4), there is a small drill-out of 
1,445 pounds of U3O8 at an average thickness and grade of 2.3' of 0.221% U3O8. This has been 
included in the following inferred category.  Considering the channel sands could continue north 
for several hundred feet, the total inferred resource in this Area G is 50,000 lbs U3O8.  
    
A channel sandstone continuing southeast of the Little Johnny Mine, Area H is inferred to 
contain mineralization amounting to 25,000 lbs U3O8.  The area northwest of the Fountain of 
Youth Mine, between it and the Bujan Mine, is very favorable and has the potential of increasing 
the inferred category another 50,000 lbs U3O8.   This is Area I on Figure 7-4.    
 
These nine identifiable areas of geologic inferred resources combine for a total of 265,000 lbs 
U3O8.  
        
The data on inferred resources stated above by EFRC cannot be corroborated by this author and 
is to be taken as potential for the area and may be substantiated by future drilling exploration. 

 15



 
18.0 Other Relevant Data and Information 
 
The Torbyn Mine is presently permitted under a Prospecting NOI Permit.  When surface drilling 
increases the resources enough to make the mine viable economically, the required mine permits 
will be applied for concurrently with mine rehabilitation.   Mine rehabilitation work will consist 
of reopening the collapsed vent hole, which could have the duel purpose of ventilation and the 
required secondary escape route.  The incline would need increased bolting and chainlink on the 
ribs, since the incline is in the muds between the Middle Rim sands and the Top Rim sands. It is 
estimated that six months would be required for refurbishing the mine. This can be done under 
the Prospecting Permit while the Mining Permit application is being approved.  
 
19.0 Interpretations and Conclusions 
 
The property is an old mine that will be reactivated. Much will depend on the economics of the 
operation and the price of uranium and vanadium. Recent resource estimate by EFRC completed 
based on earlier drilling by others and current 2007 drilling completed by EFRC states 74,214 
pounds of U3O8 and 371,076 pounds of V2O5. There also may be potential for more resources 
along the extensions of the known mineralization.   
 
20.0 Recommendations 
 
AGS recommends the following: 
 

1. Complete two to four core holes to determine the uranium equilibrium status and to   
validate the previous drilling results. Some of the holes need to be twins to old drill holes. 
The chemical analyses of the cores will help refine the vanadium-uranium ratio in the 
mineralized rocks as well as establish the equilibrium status of uranium mineralization. 

 
2. Reopen and rehabilitate the mine and sample the ribs where mineralization is present. 
Analyze the samples for uranium and vanadium content. Also take sufficient samples to 
perform a bench test to check on percent recovery of uranium and vanadium in the 
mineralized rock. 
 
3. Drill 15-20 holes, including the 2-4 holes mentioned under item one, to off-set the 
mineralization encountered in 2007 and convert some of the Indicated and Inferred to 
Measured resources. 

 
4. Recalculate the resource estimates for U3O8 and V2O5 contents, taking into 
consideration the results of the new rotary and core drilling and underground mine 
sampling. 
 
 
 
 
 

 16



21.0 Budget  
 
For drilling, coring, chemical analyses, underground sampling and geologist's time, $250,000.00 
is estimated. This is merely a rough estimate and the actual cost may be different.
