1.0 SUMMARY 

This Technical Report titled "CLARKSON HILL URANIUM PROJECT, MINERAL 
RESOURCE, NI 43-101 Technical Report, NATRONA COUNTY, WYOMING, USA" was 
prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 
Projects (NI 43-101) and the mineral resource estimates were prepared using the definitions in 
the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM Definition Standards). The effective date for 
mineral resources and of the Technical Report, is July 27, 2017.  

This Report was prepared for Anfield by Douglas Beahm, PE, PG, Principal Engineer, BRS 
Engineering to support a current Mineral Resource estimate Clarkson Hill Uranium Project 
(Clarkson Hill or Project).   

Currently available drill data consists of radiometric equivalent data (eU3O8) for 255 drill holes; 
250 pre-2008 and 5 completed in 2008.  No additional recent drilling is known.  Of the total 238 
drill holes 17 were cored. All original drill data including geophysical logs, lithological logs, and 
chemical assay certificates are available for the Project. 
 

The Clarkson Hill Project is located in Natrona County, Wyoming, about 20 air miles southwest 
of Casper, WY.  The property is located on portions of sections 7, 17, and 18 of T31N R82W at 
approximate latitude 42o 39' North and longitude 106o 41'West (refer to Figure 4.1 Location 
Map).   

Land Ownership consists of Federal lands administered by the United States Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM), State lands, and private lands. The Mineral Ownership Map, Figure 4.2, 
represents the approximate location of unpatented mining lode claims held by Anfield.  The 25 
mining claims are unpatented mining lode claims comprise some 500 acres and are located on 
federal lands.  The claims located and controlled by Anfield are referred to as CKH claims 1 
through 3, 6 through 17, and 18 through 27. The claims have production royalties of 0.5% to 3.0%.   

The initial discovery of mineralization at the Clarkson Hill Claims was made in the 1950s and 
"small amounts of ore were mined and shipped for treatment from the old pit area located in 
Section 17, T31N, R82W" (Ljung et al, March 1974). However, USGS and USBM databases list 
the Clarkson Hill Claims as a surface mine prospect with no reported production. Surface 
disturbance is limited and there is no known infrastructure, tailings, or mine waste is apparent at 
the site. Drill data utilized in the estimation of mineral resources at the Clarkson Hill Claims in 
the Technical Report reflect a deeper horizon and is not affected by the presence of "old pit".

Uranium mineralization at the Clarkson Hill is typical of the Wyoming roll-front sandstone 
deposits (Figure 8.1) as described by Ganger and Warren (1979) and Rackley and others (1972).   
Geological reports from the previous operator, Mineral Exploration Company state that the 
majority of the mineralization at depth is within the underlying Fort Union Formation (Ljung, et 
al, March, 1974).  The estimated mineral resources reflect only mineralization in the lower 
portion of the Fort Union Formation. 
 

Metallurgical testing of core samples from Clarkson Hill was completed by Hazen Research Inc. 
(Hazen, 1977).  Their report was based on the development of an acid leach conventional 
uranium processing facility.  The evaluation was based on a 60 pound composite sample from 
four core holes with an average grade of 0.077% U3O8.   Nine separate leach test were 
completed with acid concentrations ranging from 20.6 to 70.4 with an average of 33 pounds per 
ton H2SO4 (sulfuric acid).  Uranium extraction ranged from 93.5 to 96.1 %.  These metallurgical 
studies demonstrate that the uranium mineralization at Clarkson Hill is recoverable by 
conventional acid leach methods but are considered preliminary in nature. Additional 
metallurgical testing is recommended. 
 
The great majority of the data available for estimation of mineral resources is radiometric 
geophysical logging data from which the uranium content is interpreted. A disequilibrium factor 
(DEF), (Radiometric eU3O8 to Chemical U3O8) is assumed to be 1, i.e. equilibrium is assumed.  
For the Clarkson Hill Uranium Project data is available for the evaluation of radiometric 
equilibrium.  Available chemical data includes 17 core holes, however, only 13 were 
mineralized.  The calculated DEF ranges from 0.96 to 1.06 depending on uranium grade with the 
lower factor observed for grade less than 0.05 %eU3O8. Thus, an assumption of radiometric 
equilibrium (DEF = 1) is reasonable with respect to mineral resources.   
 
The pre-2008 drill data for the drill holes used in the estimate includes original hard copies of 
geophysical logs which are in possession of Anfield and are well preserved. The drill data has 
been reviewed and verified by the author. The post-2008 drill data is complete and includes both 
electronic and hard copies of the original data. Drill hole database entries have been spot 
checked. 
 
Interpretation of the geophysical logs (pre and post 2008) followed industry standard methods. 
The interpretations of the pre-2008 geophysical logs are generally conservative based on the 
comparison to the logs re-interpreted by the author. Data verification is discussed in Section 12  

1.1 Mineral Resources 

The mineral resource estimates are based on radiometric equivalent uranium grades %eU3O8.  A 
minimum grade cut-off of 0.02 % eU3O8, minimum thickness of 2 feet, and minimum GT of 0.20 
were used in the estimations along with a bulk dry density of 16 cubic feet per ton, as previously 
discussed.  Mineral resources were estimated using the GT contour method which is considered 
appropriate for this type of deposit.  The GT contour model Figure 14.1, provides a graphical

representation of the mineralization reflecting the location, quality, represented by GT, and 
continuity of the mineralization.     

The mineral resource estimate reflects mineralization within the Fort Union Formation. Uranium 
mineralization is also found in the overlying Wind River Formation and was explored and 
reported to have been mined in limited quantities in shallow excavations (Ljung et al, March 
1974). No estimate of mineral resources within the Wind River Formation was made due to 
limited data. 

Based on the depths of mineralization (100 to 400 feet), average grade, thickness and GT, and 
continuity of the mineralization Clarkson Hill has reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction, however, the current mineral resource will not support extensive capital expenditures 
and would need to be developed is association with, or as a tributary project to, a Central 
Processing Plant (CPP).  

The deposit is closely drilled, approximately fifty to one hundred foot centers. The drilling 
demonstrates continuity particularly along the mineralized trends. Based on the drill density and 
the apparent continuity of the deposit along trend the mineral resource estimate would meet the 
criteria as an Indicated Mineral Resource. However, due to the lack of current drilling to verify 
the pre-2008 drill data the Author has classified the estimate as Inferred Mineral Resources under 
the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves. Mineral resources are reported based on 
minimum grade cutoffs of 0.02 weight % eU3O8 and at GT cutoffs of 0.10, .015, 0.20 and 0.50.  

For reporting purposes the 0.20 cutoff is recommended and is thus highlighted in the mineral 
resource tabulations that follow. The author expects the majority of the Inferred Mineral 
Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with additional drilling. Mineral 
resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability, however, 
based on the depth, grade, and geological continuity in comparison to mine operations in similar 
host formations there is a reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction.

1.2 Conclusions and Recommendations 

Overall it is recommended that future resource estimations consider alternative mine extraction 
assumptions and mineral recovery methodologies including conventional open pit mining with 
heap leach or conventional mill recovery and/or In Situ Recovery (ISR).  The depth, local 
geologic and hydrologic conditions, and local variations in the character of mineralization, will 
influence the ultimate selection of mining method. Leach solutions from heap leach and/or ISR 
would require a similar central processing facility for final product production.  

The recommended Phase 1 non-contingent program with total estimated expenditures of 
$500,000 (US dollars) includes: 

 
1. Confirm by drilling the potential mineralized trends within the horizons and at the 

locations indicated by historical data.  Estimated 50 drill holes at average depth of 500 
feet or 25,000 feet of drilling at an estimated cost of $250,000. 

2. Confirm previous radiometric equilibrium evaluations by completing core holes and 
comparing chemical assays with radiometric data within the horizons and at the locations 
indicated by historical data.  Estimated 10 core holes at a cost of $10,000 each for a total 
estimated cost of $100,000. 

3. Confirm and expand previous metallurgical studies and investigations including the 
collection of additional core samples for testing utilizing an alkaline lixiviant. Estimated 
cost $100,000. 

4. Complete hydrological investigations and studies including determination of aquifer 
properties and current ground water levels and quality. Construction and testing of two 
monitor wells; estimated cost $25,000 each for a total estimated cost of $50,000.

Upon completion of Phase 1, Phase 2 recommendations include: 

1. Complete a mineral reserve and economic feasibility study including preparation of an NI 
43-101 compliant mineral reserve report. 

2. Evaluate the potential for developing the Clarkson Hill Claims as a satellite operation 
feeding existing mineral processing facilities and/or consolidating the Clarkson Hill 
Claims with other properties to support the capital investment of a new central processing 
facility. 

 
1.3 Summary of Risks 

The Clarkson Hill Project is located in an area for which the geology, nature of mineralization, 
and host formation (Fort Union Formation) is well known.  Mining and milling have been 
successfully completed at projects within the same host formation at different localities within 
Wyoming. The Project does have some risks similar in nature to other mineral projects in general 
and uranium projects in particular.  Risks common to mineral projects include:  

 variance in the grade and continuity of mineralization from what was interpreted by 
drilling; 

 changes in future commodity demand that could significantly change the assumed 
uranium prices used in the mineral resource estimates; 

 environmental,  social and political acceptance of the project could cause delays in 
conducting work or increase the costs from what was assumed; 

 variance in operating costs from what was assumed in assessing reasonable prospects and 
cut-offs used in the mineral resource estimates; 

 changes in the mining and mineral processing recovery from what was assumed in the 
resource estimates; and 

 additional exploration may not result in discovery of additional mineral resources within 
the targeted areas. 
 

With regard to the socio-economic and political environment, Wyoming mines have produced 
over 200 million pounds of uranium from both conventional and ISR mine and mill operations.  
Production began in the early 1950's and continues to the present.  The state has ranked as the 
number one US producer of uranium since 1994.  Wyoming is considered generally favorable to 
mine development provided established environmental regulations are met (refer to "Wyoming 
Politicians, Regulators Embrace Uranium Miners With Open Arms", Finch, 2006).  An 
assessment by the Fraser Institute published in February 2017, ranks Wyoming as 7th out of 104 
jurisdictions using a Policy Perception Index, which indicates a very favorable perception by the 
mining industry towards Wyoming mining policies. 

To the author's knowledge there are no other significant risks that could materially affect the 
Mineral Resource estimates or interfere with the recommended work programs.

Mr. Beahm has past work experience on the project in the preparation of a Technical Report on 
the project for Artha Resources in 2007 and 2008. 

Mr. Beahm last visited Clarkson Hill on July 22, 2017. During this site visit;  

 Evidence of past drilling was observed and several pre-2008 drill holes were located and 
mapped with a hand-held GPS (accuracy 3 meters). Drill holes were not well marked in 
the field. Mapped drill holes were compared to the locations in the drill hole database and 
matched within the mapping accuracy. 

 Three of the five drill holes completed in 2008 were located. All were on CH claim 15 
and all fell outside the area of the mineral resource estimate. The 2008 drill holes were 
marked in the field with orange plastic stakes. Aluminum tags were present but difficult 
to read. 

 Several claim stakes were located and mapped with a hand-held GPS. Claim stakes were 
marked with aluminum tags. Mapped claim stake locations were compared to the 
reported locations from the database and were within the mapping accuracy. 

 No evidence of recent claim staking and/or drilling was observed.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Property Description and Location 

The Clarkson Hill Project is located in Natrona County, Wyoming, about 20 air miles southwest 
of Casper, WY.  The property is located on portions of sections 7, 17, and 18 of T31N R82W at 
approximate latitude 42o 39' North and longitude 106o 41'West (refer to Figure 4.1 Location 
Map).   

Land Ownership consists of Federal lands administered by the United States Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM), State lands, and private lands. The Mineral Ownership Map, Figure 4.2, 
represents the approximate location of unpatented mining lode claims held by Anfield.  The 25 
mining claims are unpatented mining lode claims, comprise some 500 acres and are located on 
federal lands.  The claims located and controlled by Anfield are referred to as CKH claims 1 
through 3, 6 through 17, and 18 through 27. The claims have production royalties of 0.5% to 
3.0%.   

Anfield has a possessory right to explore, develop and produce on the unpatented lode mining 
claims and must pay an annual maintenance fee to the Bureau of Land Management of $155.00 
per claim on or before September 1.  Surface use on mining claims on BLM lands are allowed 
subject to 3809 regulations and require both BLM and WDEQ/LQD permitting. 

4.2  Anfield Acquisition of the Clarkson Project 

On September 14, 2016, Anfield Resources Inc. closed a transaction with Uranium One 
Americas Inc. ("Uranium One") for the transfer of 24 uranium mining properties in Wyoming, 
which included the Clarkson Hill Project. 

Under the terms of the leases and claims transfer agreement, Anfield has agreed to purchase the 
Properties for consideration of US$6,550,000, of which US$450,000 was paid upon execution of 
the agreement. The remaining US$6,100,000 will be paid in annual installments over five years. 

4.3  Permitting 

In order to conduct exploratory drilling Anfield would be required to obtain a Drilling 
Notification approved by the State of Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Land 
Quality Division (WDEQ/LQD) and the BLM to allows surface use for the purposes of 
exploration by drilling.   

Although not required at this stage, mine development would require a number of permits 
depending on the type and extent of development, the most significant permits being the Permit 
to Mine issued by the WDEQ/LQD and the Source Materials License from the U.S. Nuclear

Regulatory Commission (NRC) required for mineral processing of natural uranium. Any 
injection or pumping operations will require permits from the WDEQ which has authority under 
the Safe Water Drinking Act that stems from a grant of primacy from the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency for administering underground injection control programs in Wyoming. 

4.6  Environmental Liabilities  

To the Author's knowledge, no specific environmental liabilities are known to exist, however, no 
formal environment assessment or audit has been completed.  There are pre-existing surface 
disturbances on and adjacent to the Anfield properties including drill roads, drill sites, haul 
roads, shallow open pits and cuts, and associated mine waste. These pre-existing conditions 
preceded the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) and could be considered 
for reclamation by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) and it's 
Abandoned Mine Lands Division (AML) with cooperation of the US BLM. 

Current State of Wyoming mining regulations will require Anfield to reclaim any new mining 
activities but excludes Anfield from any environmental liability associated with historical 
mining.  The AML fund is financed by a tax of 31.5 cents per ton for surface mined coal, 15 
cents per ton for coal mined underground, and 10 cents per ton for lignite. 50% of AML fees are 
distributed to states with an approved reclamation program to fund reclamation activities. 
(https://www.osmre.gov/programs/aml.shtm 

4.7  State and Local Taxes and Royalties 

The current Wyoming severance tax is four percent but after the allowable wellhead deduction 
the effective severance tax rate is approximately 3% of gross sales. In addition, the ad valorum 
(gross products) tax varies by county assessment but is approximately 6.5%. Federal income tax 
is assessed based on company profits. Due to the favorable regular tax depletion deduction most 
mining companies' effective tax rate is the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) rate of 20%.  

4.8  Encumbrances and Risks 

The unpatented lode mining claims will remain the property of Anfield provided they adhere to 
required filing and annual payment requirements with Fremont and Natrona Counties and the 
BLM. Legal surveys of unpatented lode mining claims are not required and are not known to 
have been completed. All of the unpatented lode mining claims have annual filing requirements 
($155 per claim) with the BLM, to be paid on or before September 1 of each year. Mining claims 
are subject to the Mining Law of 1872. Changes in the mining law could affect the Project.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 

The site is accessible from either Highway 220 or from the Oregon Trail Road, a Natrona County 
improved gravel road.  From Highway 220 the site is approximately 4 miles northwest of the 
junction of the highway with Natrona County Road 318.  From the Oregon Trail Road the site is 
approximately 3 miles to the southeast.  Although the site is situated on public lands 
administered by the U. S. Bureau of Land Management, BLM, site access from either route will 
require an arrangement with intervening private land owners for ingress/egress. 
 
Although past mining on a limited scale was completed on the site in the 1950's no infrastructure 
is present at the site.  Utility corridors do exist along the Oregon Trail Road including power and 
gas transmission lines. The principal access roads to the site are maintained year-round and year-
round operations could be conducted at the Project. 
 
5.2 Topography, Elevation, Physiography 

The Clarkson Hill Project is located in a broad synclinal valley northeast of the North Granite 
Mountain Fault.  Dip is gentle, approximately 4 degrees to the northeast (Rich, 1962).  
Geological units exposed at the surface include Tertiary White River and Wind River Formations 
and Quaternary alluvial and pediment gravel deposits. 
 
The property extends from the base to the top of a small mesa known as Clarkson Hill.  The top 
of the mesa is relatively flat lying at an elevation of approximately 6,200 feet above mean sea 
level.  The mesa has approximately 200 feet of vertical relief with some relatively steep slopes, 
in excess of 3:1 (horizontal to vertical).  The currently defined area of mineralization is at the 
base and along the slope of the mesa. 
 

5.3 Climate, Vegetation and Wildlife 

Climate at the Project is continental semi-arid, with annual precipitation of 8-12 inches, mostly 
falling in the form of late autumnal to early spring snows.  The summer months are usually hot 
with temperature occasionally exceeding 100oF, dry and clear except for infrequent rains.  
Winter conditions can be severe, and can include sub-zero temperatures and ground blizzards. 
Most drainages in the area are ephemeral, flowing only during storm events or spring snow melt.  
The North Platte river some 4-5 miles south of the Project is perennial and is one of the major 
river systems in Wyoming.   

The climate of the Project is most similar to that of Casper Wyoming, some 20 air miles from the 
site for which a brief summary of weather conditions follows.

Casper weather averages 

Average Annual high temperature: 59.2°F 

Average Annual low temperature: 31.3°F

Average Annual temperature: 45.25°F 

Average annual precipitation - rainfall: 12.48 inches 

Average annual snowfall: 75 inches 

(http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/casper/wyoming/united-states/uswy0030) 

Most common native vegetation is sage brush and prairie grasses and to a lesser extent, rabbit 
brush.  No threatened or endangered plants are known in the area. Limited upland areas have 
juniper and limber pine trees on north facing slopes. 

Mule deer and pronghorn antelope are common, as are nesting raptors.  Small rodents and rabbits 
are common.  The Greater Sage Grouse, present in the general area of the Project, has been 
considered for listing as a threatened or endangered species.   

5.4 Infrastructure 

In addition to site access, mine development will require utilities and water supply.  No current 
infrastructure is present at the site. The nature and scope of the mine operations will greatly 
influence utility and water supply demands.  The closest utility services are along the ROW of 
the Oregon Trail Road.  Water supply could be obtained from locally permitted and constructed 
wells or from surface water sources including the Platte River south of the Project area.  Water 
rights for both surface and ground water are administered by the Wyoming State Engineer's 
Office and are subject to prior water rights.  Options for on-site power demands would include 
extension of existing utilities to the Project or the generation of power on site. 

The nearest community is the town of Casper, Wyoming.  Casper is the second-largest city in 
Wyoming, according to the 2010 census, with a population of 55,316. Casper is the County Seat 
and has a long history as an oil boomtown (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper,_Wyoming). 
Several oilfield and mining service companies are located in Casper including a caterpillar 
dealership, several drilling companies, and industrial supply companies. Casper has an adequate 
workforce skilled in mining and mineral exploration to support the Project.

5.5  Surface Rights 

The 1872 Mining Law grants certain surface rights along with the right to mine provided the 
surface use is incident to the mine operations.  In order to exercise those rights the operator must 
comply with a variety of State and Federal regulations (refer to section 20).  For areas of private 
surface ownership appropriate surface-owner agreements would be required. Adequate surface 
rights can be obtained through permitting and licensing of site activities including potential 
waste disposal areas, heap leach pads, and potential plant sites.  

The Code of Federal Regulations 43 CFR 3715 governs the use and occupancy under the mining 
laws for Federal Lands. Under these regulations, 3715.05, states "Mining operations means   all   
functions, work, facilities, and activities reasonably incident to mining or processing of mineral 
deposits." For future mining and mineral processing the author concludes that Anfield can obtain 
through permitting and licensing of site activities, sufficient surface rights for possible future 
mining operations, including potential waste disposal areas, heap leach pads, ISR wellfields, and 
potential plant sites as was common with previous mine and mineral processing operations in the 
vicinity.

6.0 HISTORY 

The initial discovery of mineralization at the Clarkson Hill Claims was made in the 1950s and 
"small amounts of ore were mined and shipped for treatment from the old pit area located in 
Section 17, T31N, R82W" (Ljung et al, March 1974). However, USGS and USBM databases list 
the Clarkson Hill Claims as a surface mine prospect with no reported production. The surface 
disturbance, based on site observation by the author of the Technical Report is shallow (less than 
20 feet in depth) and limited in aerial extent. Surface disturbance is limited and there is no 
known infrastructure, tailings, or mine waste is apparent at the site. Drill data utilized in the 
estimation of mineral resources at the Clarkson Hill Claims in the Technical Report reflect a 
deeper horizon and is not affected by the presence of "old pit". Surface disturbance from past 
exploration and/or limited mining activities at the site are readily apparent from current aerial 
views and on the ground. 

6.1 Ownership and Control 

Utah Construction and Mining conducted drilling on the property in 1959 but results are not 
available.  Subsequently, the property was held by a private individual who in turn optioned the 
property to Nuclear Reserves Inc.  In 1969, Nuclear Reserves Inc. entered into a joint venture 
with Minerals Exploration Company.   

Minerals Exploration Company (MEC) held the property through the mid-1980's until in light of 
declining uranium prices they dropped the claims. Initial staking of 14 claims in the intensely 
explored area was completed by Energy Metals Corporation (EMC) who also obtained the 
relevant data for the property. EMC optioned the Project to Artha Resources (Artha) who 
conducted limited verification drilling on the project. The project reverted from Artha to EMC. 

The Project currently consists of 25 unpatented mining lode claims. EMC was subsequently 
acquired by Uranium One Inc. in August of 2008. Through subsequent transactions, Uranium 
One Inc. is now Uranium One Americas Inc. (Uranium One). Uranium One sold interest in 
twenty-four uranium projects located in Wyoming, including Clarkson Hill Project to Anfield. 
The transaction closed on September 14, 2016.  

The aggregate consideration due from Anfield totals $6,100,000.00 to be paid over a five year 
period.  Thera are no overriding royalties due to Uranium One. As discussed in Section 4, the 
Project has production royalties of 0.5% to 3.0% to other parties.

6.2 Historical Mineral Resource Estimates  

Historical mineral resources are available from a number of sources. However, previous resource 
estimates are not relevant since there is a current mineral resource on the Project which is 
described in Section 14 of this Report.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

Clarkson Hill is located near the southern and eastern margin of the Wind River Basin just west 
of the Casper Arch which separates the Powder River and Wind River Basins. Both the Wind 
River and Fort Union Formations are terrestrial sedimentary deposits.  The primary source of 
sediments for the Wind River and Fort Union Formations was the ancestral Granite Mountains to 
the west and south of the project.  The Granite Mountains were formed during the Laramide 
Orogeny, a period of extensive mountain building which began at the end of the Mesozoic Era 
and continued into the early Cenozoic Era.  Subsequent erosion of the Granite Mountain 
highlands coupled with the down-warping of adjacent basins such as the Wind River and Powder 
River Basins combined to accumulate thousands of feet of sedimentary deposits within the 
Wyoming basins.  The Paleocene Fort Union is the oldest Tertiary formation and consists of 
sandstone, siltstone, shale, coal and local conglomerates.  The Fort Union is overlain, often 
uncomformably, by the Eocene Wind River Formation which consist of sandstones, 
conglomerates, siltstones, and shale.  Overlying the Wind River Formation is the Oligocene 
White River Formation.  The White River Formation also consists of sandstones, siltstone, and 
shale, however, along with fluvial deposition of the sands and clays, substantial volumes of 
windblown volcanic ash (tuffs) were also deposited.  This volcanic ash is regarded by many as 
the source of uranium both at the Project for many of the Wyoming sandstone uranium deposits. 

Surficial geology is shown on Figure 7.1, Geologic Map and Stratigraphic Column.  Rich, 1962, 
shows the Clarkson Hill area to be within a broad synclinal valley located northeast of the North 
Granite Mountain Fault.  Dip is gentle, approximately 4 degrees to the northeast (Rich, 1962).   

7.2 Local Geology and Mineralization 

Uranium mineralization at Clarkson Hill occurs in both the Wind River and Fort Union 
Formations, according to both published and unpublished reports. Ljung, et al, March, 1974, 
states that the majority of the mineralization occurs locally within a 100 foot thick sandstone unit 
of the Fort Union Formation.   

Near surface uranium mineralization occurs in the Wind River Formation in the vicinity of the 
Project and was explored in the 1950's by shallow excavations. Later drilling defined deeper 
mineralization within the Fort Union Formation near the contact with the Lance Formation , as 
shown on Figure 10.2: Cross Section A-A'.  The Mineral Resource estimate is restricted to the 
uranium mineralization within the lower portion of the Fort Union Formation. 

Uranium mineralization is typical of Wyoming sandstone-type (roll-front) mineralization as 
subsequently discussed in Section 8.

7.3 Geohydrology 

Ground water levels and aquifer properties are generally not known.  In 1976 the previous 
operator attempted to complete a water supply well located in Section 17, T31N, R82W.  A fluid 
level of 75 feet is shown of the geophysical log of the well.  The well was perforated in multiple 
sand units, 50 to 100 feet, 110 to 125 feet, 165 to 180 feet, and 200 to 215 feet.  According to the 
report the sand units were silty and the well production less than 2 gallons per minute.   
 
Evaluation of geohydrologic conditions at the site is recommended if ISR methods are to be 
considered for exploitation of this project.

The key components for the formation of roll-front type deposits according to Granger and 
Warren (1979) include: 
 

 A permeable host formation; 
 A source of soluble uranium;  
 Oxidizing ground waters to leach and transport the uranium; 
 Adequate reductant within the host formation; and  
 Time sufficient to concentrate the uranium at the oxidation/reduction interface. 

 
At Clarkson Hill;  

 Both the Wind River and Fort Union Formations are known sandstone hosts for uranium 
deposits in Wyoming; 

 Both the White River Formation and Granite Mountains are in reasonable proximity and 
could have provided the source of uranium; 

 Oxidation of the sandstone host is evident from the lithologic descriptions from drilling; 
 Carbonaceous material is described to occur within the host formations in the vicinity by 

Minobras (1976) and Wilson (1960) and pyrite is described in lithologic descriptions 
from drilling.  Either of these sources would provide adequate reductant; and 

 Drilling at Clarkson Hill demonstrates the presence of uranium mineralization at an 
oxidation/reduction interface indicating that favorable hydrologic and geochemical 
conditions were present for sufficient time to concentrate uranium.

9.0 EXPLORATION 

The initial discovery of mineralization at the Clarkson Hill Claims was made in the 1950's from 
aerial and ground radiometric surveys (Ljung et al, March 1974). Early exploration was also 
aided by visible alteration in outcrops of the Wind River Formation. In the vicinity of the Project 
mineralization in the Wind River Formation is near surface. Later drilling led to the discovery of 
mineralization at depth in the Fort Union Formation.  

The outcrop pictured on the cover of this report is an altered sandstone unit within the Fort 
Union Formation with anomalous gamma levels. This outcrop is up-dip from the mineralization 
at Clarkson Hill.  

To the author's knowledge, no relevant exploration work other than drilling, as described in 
Section 10, Drilling, has been conducted on the property since that time.

10.0 DRILLING 

10.1  Drilling Methods 

Currently available drill data consists of radiometric equivalent data (eU3O8) for 255 drill holes; 
250 pre-2008 and 5 completed in 2008.  No additional recent drilling is known.  Of the total 250 
pre-2008 drill holes 17 were cored. All original drill data including geophysical logs, lithological 
logs, and chemical assay certificates are available for the Project. 
 
The vast majority of the drilling (pre and post 2008) was conducted by air and/or mud rotary 
drilling (vertical) with limited core drilling for evaluation of radiometric equilibrium conditions. 
The principal data collected for mineral resource estimation by drilling was downhole 
radiometric equivalent assays. Geologic data collected included lithologic descriptions of drill 
cuttings and interpretation of geophysical logs (SP and Resistivity). Core recovery is not an issue 
as uranium grade is determined primarily by geophysical methods in an open drill hole.  
Evaluation of disequilibrium, discussed in Section 11, was based on comparisons of assay data 
form core and radiometric equivalent geophysical data. 
 
The locations of drill holes and extent of drilling are shown on Figure 10.1. Drill hole 
coordinates and elevations are in state plane coordinates.  
 
The locations of drill holes used in the mineral resource estimation are shown in greater detail on 
the GT Contour Maps provided in Section 14, Figure 14.1. 
 
10.2  Drilling Length Versus True Thickness 

All drill holes were vertical and typically less than 500 feet in depth. Downhole drift surveys are 
available only for the 2008 drilling. These surveys show random deviation from vertical of less 
than 1o and less than a 0.6% variance in depth drilled as compared to true depth (Refer to Table 
10.1). No deviation of the drill holes was assumed in the mineral resource estimation and this is 
considered reasonable. The dip of the host formation is slight approximately 4 degrees to the 
northeast (Rich, 1962).  Drilling was conducted vertically.  A slight variation from vertical is 
expected but will not impact interpreted mineralized thickness nor would a slight variation in 
horizontal location impact the mineral resource estimate.  At a 4 degree dip penetrated by a 
vertical drill hole, the true thickness is 0.9976 (cosine of 4o) of the measured thickness.  Thus, 
the 0.5 foot measurements of thickness from the geophysical logs would have a true thickness of 
0.4988 or a difference of 0.0012 feet.  This difference is far less than the accuracy to which 
geophysical logs can be interpreted and does not affect the resource estimate.

was limited in the development of the GT contour model and the GT model was limited to a 
maximum GT of 3.0.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Radiometric Equivalent Geophysical Log Calibration 

DOE supports the development, standardization, and maintenance of calibration facilities for 
environmental radiation sensors. Radiation standards at the facilities are primarily used to 
calibrate portable surface gamma-ray survey meters and borehole logging instruments used for 
uranium and other mineral exploration and remedial action measurements. This is an important 
quality control measure used by the geophysical logging equipment operators. The author has 
reviewed the geophysical logs and they have annotation of the calibration parameters necessary 
for the accurate conversion of gamma measurements recorded by the logging units to radiometric 
equivalent uranium grade. Anfield has acquired exploration files for the Project which includes 
original geophysical logs and data. This data is currently in the possession of the Author and will 
be transferred to Anfield upon completion of this report. 

Calibration facilities are located at DOE sites at Grand Junction Regional Airport in Grand 
Junction, Colorado; Grants, New Mexico; Casper, Wyoming; and George West, Texas 
(https://energy.gov/lm/services/calibration-facilities). These calibration facilities were first 
established by the US Atomic Energy commission (AEC) in the 1950's to support the domestic 
uranium exploration and development programs of that era.  

Early geophysical logs were analog which required manual interpretation. The standard method 
for estimation of the grade and thickness or uranium was the half-amplitude method. In the late 
1960's this method was gradually replaced with computer processing. Dodd and Droullard, 
1967, state that borehole logging is the geophysical method most extensively used in the US for 
the exploration and evaluation of uranium deposits and that gamma-ray logging at that time 
supplied 80 percent of the basic data for ore reserve calculations and much of the subsurface 
geologic information. At that time calibration and correction factors were established for each 
logging unit and probe in the full scale model holes established by the AEC. GAMLOG and 
RHOLOG computer programs (Fortran II) were used to quantitatively analyze gamma-ray logs 
to obtain radiometric equivalent grade and thickness of mineralized intercepts (Dodd and 
Drollard, 1967).   

Calibration procedures and standards for the geophysical logging equipment used in the 
determination of radiometric equivalent uranium grade has been consistent through the various 
drilling campaigns and has relied on calibration facilities maintain by the US government. It is 
standard practice for geophysical logging companies to rely on these calibration facilities. 
Century calibrates to the primary standards located at ERDA facilities in Grand Junction, 
Colorado where a family of calibration models are maintained. These models consist of a barren 
zone bored in concrete and a mineralized zone constructed of a homogenous concentration of 



 

 

 

 

29 

 

uranium at a known grade followed by and underlying barren zone. There are different grade 
models to reflect the range on uranium concentrations typically found in the US. In addition, the 
models can be flooded to determine a water factor and there are models which are cased for the 
determination of a casing factor. Each of the models are approximately 9 feet deep consisting a 3 
foot mineralized zone with 3 foot barren zones above and below. The facilities are secure. 
Logging unit operators logs the holes, provide the geophysical log data in counts per second 
(CPS) to the facility which in turn processes the data and provides the company with standard 
calibration values including; dead time, K Factor, and water and casing factors (Century, 1975). 

11.2 Pre-2008 Drilling Analyses 

The pre-2008 drill data was originally collected by Minerals Exploration company (MEC) using 
company logging trucks and several third party contractors The pre-2008 drill data includes 
geophysical logs from MEC (40%), Century Geophysical (4%), Birdwell (20%), Master Logging 
Inc. (10%), Velocity Radiation Surveys (22%), and GEO Nuclear Services (4%).  It was then, 
and still is standard industry practice to routinely calibrate downhole geophysical logging 
equipment at the facilities operated by the US Department of Energy. 

Standard electric logs consisted of recordings of gamma, self-potential, and resistivity.  Self-
potential and resistivity data are useful in defining bedding boundaries and for correlation of 
sandstone units and mineralized zones between drill holes.  At the time of the pre-2008 drilling, 
equivalent U3O8 content was calculated from gamma logs using industry-standard methods 
developed by the Atomic Energy Commission (now the DOE: Department of Energy), using 
either manual or computer methods.  The manual method is as follows: 

For zones greater than 2 feet thick, first pick an upper and lower boundary of mineralization by 
choosing points approximately one-half height from background to peak of gamma anomaly.  
Then determine counts per second (cps) for each half-foot interval between the points, convert 
cps to GT (grade times thickness) using the appropriate dead-time, k-factor and water factor for 
the specific logging unit utilized, and divide GT by thickness to obtain grade - %eU3O8.  

These gamma log interpretations are the basis from which quantities of mineralization could be 
estimated.  These interpretations were industry standard at the time 1950s through 1980s.  

The pre-2008 sampling, logging, and gamma-probing practices varied based on the practices of 
previous operators.  Based on the author's experience, all operators, whether using company-
owned or contracted geophysical logging trucks, maintained calibration of the logging units 
through AEC (later DOE) standard calibration facilities located in Casper, Wyoming and Grand 
Junction, Colorado. The original geophysical logs are currently in the possession of Author and 
will be transferred to Anfield upon completion of this report.

The AEC published information the calibration standards for geophysical logging and on gamma 
log interpretation methods (Dodd and Droullard, 1967). The standard manual log interpretation 
method was the half-amplitude method (Century, 1975). The AEC and its successor agency the 
Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) conducted workshops on gamma-
ray logging techniques and interpretation as did private companies including Century 
Geophysical. The author and several peers in the uranium industry at the time attended the 
geophysical log interpretation workshop conducted by Century Geophysical. On November 19, 
1976 the author received certification in geophysical log interpretation from Century after 
attending their short course. 

11.3 Post-2008 Drilling 

In 2008, Artha Resources (a former operator) complete 5 drill holes at Clarkson Hill by vertical 
rotary drilling. Geophysical logging was provided by Century Geophysical Corporation an 
independent contractor. The geophysical log data consists of downhole natural gamma, 
resistivity, and SP; downhole drift surveys, and radiometric equivalent uranium assays for each 
½ foot. 

11.3 Security 

The original drill data is in currently in the possession of the Author and will be transferred to 
Anfield upon completion of this report. Drill cutting samples and core samples were generally 
not preserved. 

11.4 Summary 

The author was active in uranium exploration and mining in Wyoming in the 1970's when earlier 
drilling programs were undertaken on the Clarkson Hill, participated in quality control and 
industry practice workshops, and observed that industry accepted practices were well understood 
by industry and followed at the time. The Author reviewed the available drill data and 
independently correlated mineralized horizons and determined appropriate composite intervals 
for use in mineral resource estimation, as discussed in Section 14.  It is the Author's opinion that 
the available drill data is reliable and adequate for the estimation of Indicated and Inferred 
Mineral Resources.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION  

Currently available drill data consists of radiometric equivalent data (eU3O8) for 255 drill holes; 
250 pre-2008 and 5 completed in 2008.  No additional recent drilling is known.  Of the total 238 
drill holes 17 were cored. All original drill data including geophysical logs, lithological logs, and 
chemical assay certificates are available for the Project. 
 

12.1 Verification of Radiometric Database 

The pre-2008 drill data was originally collected by Minerals Exploration company (MEC) using 
company logging trucks and several third party contractors The pre-2008 drill data includes 
geophysical logs from MEC (40%), Century Geophysical (4%), Birdwell (20%), Master Logging 
Inc. (10%), Velocity Radiation Surveys (22%), and GEO Nuclear Services (4%).  It was standard 
industry practice at the time, and it is the current practice, to maintain calibration of geophysical 
logging equipment through use of the AEC/ERDA (now DOE) standard calibration pits located 
at Casper, Wyoming and Grand Junction, Colorado for quality control and assurance with 
respect to radiometric equivalent data.   

Original geophysical logs are in possession of the Author. The drill logs contain header 
information for essentially all of the drill holes including K Factor, Dead Time, and Water 
Factor. Several of the drill holes headers also included notes as to the date of calibration of the 
logging unit at the ERDA test pits. Pre-2008 drill data generally consists of geophysical logs of 
drill holes including of copies (blueprints) of original drill logs and copies of digital printouts of 
depth and counts per second (CPS) in ½ foot increments within the mineralized zones. The 
geophysical logs include natural gamma, resistivity, and spontaneous potential (SP). All drill 
holes were drilled with fluid and logged in the open hole with no casing. All drill holes were 
vertical with no drift data.  

Radiometric equivalent data is available for all the drill holes used in the mineral resource 
estimate (Pre and Post-2008) and is incorporated into the drill hole database. 

The pre-2008 drill data was combined with data from 2008 drilling in an electronic database.  
During the preparation of this Report the available electronic data was reviewed for each of the 
mineral resource areas. This process included:  

 Plotting of the drill hole locations and comparing these to drill maps prepared by previous 
operators. 

 Screening the drill hole data and preparing a subset of the data containing mineralized 
intercepts meeting grade, thickness and GT cut-off criteria. 

 Correlating the mineralized intercept data such that mineral resource estimates reflected 
only continuous horizons within the Fort Union Formation. 



 

 

 

 

32 

 

 Excluding any spurious mineralized horizons (laterally or by depth from the continuous 
horizons) from the mineral resource estimate. This process excluded mineralization in the 
overlying Wind River Formation.  

 Examining any mineralized intercepts which were either substantially higher or lower 
than the surrounding values to insure the data was considered reliable and therefore 
suitable to be used.  
 

Verification of pre-2008 radiometric equivalent data follows.  

12.2 Verification of Drill Data  

Radiometric equivalent (%eU3O8) drill data from a total of 255 drill holes was available for the 
Clarkson. Of the total 255 drill holes 110 expressed uranium mineralization greater the 0.02 
%eU3O8 and a GT greater than 0.10 and thus were included in the mineral resource estimate. 

Drilling campaigns were conducted by:  

 Minerals Exploration Company (MEC) between 1968 and 1981.  
o Drill data exists for a total of 250 drill holes. 
o Radiometric equivalent data for all holes. 
o 12 drill holes (5%) were selected by Author over a range of GT values for 

verification purposes and were recalculated using standard half-amplitude method 
for log interpretation. 

o All drill holes were logged open with no casing. 
o All holes were filled with fluid 

 Artha Resources 2008. 
o Drill data from 5 drill holes. 
o Radiometric equivalent data by ½ foot intervals. 
o Digital radiometric data database entry verified by the Author. 

 

For verification purposes, 10% of the drill holes used in the mineral resource estimate (5% of 
total drill holes) were selected representing the range of mineralization observed and year drilled. 
The earliest year was 1968 and the latest was 1981. Mineralization in the selected drill holes 
ranged from a high GT value of 3.5 to a low value of 0.16. Barren holes were examined but not 
included in the analysis.  

Examination of these drill holes confirmed that the drill hole database reasonably reflects the 
depth, thickness and radiometric equivalent uranium grade from the original geophysical logs. 
The only discrepancy noted was the omission of isolated mineralized intercepts of lower grade 
and thickness which were not included in the database, which the author concurs with.   



 

 

 

 

33 

 

Re-calculation by the Author shows the original interpretation of radiometric equivalent uranium 
grade is approximately 8.2% less the re-calculated values which means that the database is 
conservative with respect to grade as compared to the re-calculated holes. Figure 12.1.1 is a 
comparison of the drill hole database values to those re-calculated by the Author using the 
standard half-amplitude log interpolation method. 

FIGURE 12.2 – DATA COMPARISON 

 

Note: By comparison of the sum of the GT values in the Database GT values are 8% less than 
the re-interpreted GT values.  

12.3 Verification of Disequilibrium Factor 

Radioactive isotopes decay until they reach a stable non-radioactive state. The radioactive decay 
chain isotopes are referred to as daughters.  When all the decay products are maintained in close 
association with the primary uranium isotope U238 for the order of a million years or more, the 
daughter isotopes will be in equilibrium with the parent isotope (McKay, 2008).  Disequilibrium 
occurs when one or more decay products are dispersed as a result of differences in solubility 
between uranium and its daughters. Disequilibrium is considered positive when there is a higher 
proportion of uranium present compared to daughters and negative where daughters are 
accumulated and uranium is depleted.  The disequilibrium factor (DEF) is determined by

comparing radiometric equivalent uranium grade eU3O8 to chemical uranium grade.  
Radiometric equilibrium is represented by a DEF of 1, positive radiometric equilibrium by a 
factor greater than 1, and negative radiometric equilibrium by a factor of less than 1.  

Except in cases where uranium mineralization is exposed to strongly oxidized conditions, most 
of the sandstone roll front deposits reasonably approximate radiometric equilibrium.  The nose of 
a roll front deposit tends to have the most positive DEF and the tails of a roll front would tend to 
have the lowest DEF (Davis, 1969). 

The great majority of the data available for estimation of mineral resources is radiometric 
geophysical logging data from which the uranium content is interpreted.  Radiometric 
equilibrium conditions may affect the grade and spatial location of uranium in the deposit.  
Generally an equilibrium ratio (Radiometric eU3O8 to Chemical U3O8) is assumed to be 1, i.e. 
equilibrium is assumed.  For the Clarkson Hill Uranium Project data is available for the 
evaluation of radiometric equilibrium.  Available chemical data includes 17 core holes, however, 
only 13 were mineralized.  The Table 12.3 summarizes the results of the data available for 
evaluation of radiometric equilibrium conditions:

> 0.05 % eU3O8 11 44 1.06 

 
 
In summary, based on available data and considering typical grade cutoffs in the range of 0.03 to 
0.05 Weight % eU3O8, an assumption of radiometric equilibrium (DEF = 1) is reasonable with 
respect to mineral resources.  It is recommended that in the future assessment of mineral 
reserves, additional data relative to radiometric equilibrium be developed and equilibrium be 
evaluated for each potential mining area by elevation with respect to the water table. 

12.4   Density of Mineralized Material 

The density of mineralization used in the Clarkson Hill resource estimation was 16 cubic feet per 
ton. This is the most common figure used for sandstone hosted, roll-front uranium deposits in 
Wyoming and Colorado, as noted extensively throughout the literature on these deposits, and 
from the Author's working experience from mining similar sandstone-hosted deposits.  Density 
studies were completed by a previous operator MEC (Bares et al, May, 1979) based on limited 



 

 

 

 

35 

 

data from 17 core holes (13 of which were mineralized). This study stated an average density of 
16.9 cubic feet per ton.  

 Based on the limited number of core sampled for density, and the overall average being very 
similar to the 16 ft3/ton average used historically, the author has assumed a density factor of 16 
ft3/ton for the mineral resource estimates reported in Section 14.  The variance in the use of a 
density factor of 16 versus 16.9 cubic feet per ton is 5%. 

 
12.5  Qualified Person's Opinion 

The pre-2008 drill data for the drill holes used in the mineral resource estimate includes original 
hard copies of geophysical logs which are in possession of Anfield and are well preserved. The 
drill data has been reviewed and verified by the Author as previously discussed. The Post-2008 
drill data is complete and includes both electronic and hard copies of the original data. Drill hole 
database entries have been spot checked by the Author. 
 
Interpretation of the geophysical logs (pre and post 2008) followed industry standard methods. 
The interpretations of the pre-2008 geophysical logs are generally conservative based on the 
comparison to the logs re-interpreted by the Author.  

Based on the Author's review of the quality and completeness of the documentation and the data 
verification procedures completed, the Author considers the data reliable and suitable for the 
purposes used in the Report.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Metallurgical testing of core samples from Clarkson Hill was completed by Hazen Research Inc. 

and the results summarized in their report "Metallurgical Test Work on Uranium Ore Sample 

from Clarkson Hill, Wyoming", dated July 29, 1977.  Their report was based on the development 

of an acid leach conventional uranium processing facility.  The evaluation was based on a 60 

pound composite sample from four core holes with an average grade of 0.077% U3O8.   Nine 

separate leach test were completed with acid concentrations ranging from 20.6 to 70.4 with an 

average of 33 pounds per ton H2SO4 (sulfuric acid).  Uranium extraction ranged from 93.5 to 

96.1 %.  These metallurgical studies demonstrate that the uranium mineralization at Clarkson 

Hill is recoverable by conventional acid leach methods. 

 

Recommendations 

 

While available metallurgical testing data demonstrates that uranium is recoverable from 

mineralized material the results were based on a limited samples and are considered preliminary. 

Additional metallurgical testing is recommended. Specifically, metallurgical studies which are 

representative of the portions of the mineral resource that may be incorporated into preliminary 

mine plans and which simulate the proposed mineral processing method are recommended. This 

may include both heap leach and ISR recovery and either acid or alkaline lixiviants.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1  Mineral Resource Definitions  

The definition of Mineral Resources and the confidence categories are in accordance with CIM 
Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, May 10, 2014. The effective 
date of the Mineral Resources is July 27, 2017. 

14.2  Basis of Mineral Resource Estimates  

14.2.2 Methodology 

The mineral resource estimates are based on radiometric equivalent uranium grades %eU3O8.  A 
minimum grade cut-off of 0.02 % eU3O8, minimum thickness of 2 feet, and minimum GT of 0.20 
were used in the estimations along with a bulk dry density of 16 cubic feet per ton, as previously 
discussed.  Mineral resources were estimated using the GT contour method which is considered 
appropriate for this type of deposit.  The GT was determined for each drill hole, by major 
stratigraphic horizon, and the GT was summed for all intercepts meeting the cut-off criteria by 
horizon for each hole.  GT and T were then contoured using standard algorithms based upon the 
geological interpretation of the deposits. The GT contour model Figure 14.1, provides a 
graphical representation of the mineralization reflecting the location, quality, represented by GT, 
and continuity of the mineralization.     

From the contoured GT ranges, the contained pounds of uranium were estimated by multiplying 
the measured areas by GT and applying the density factor.  Similarly, the total tonnage was 
estimated by contouring thickness and multiplying by area to obtain cubic feet, then converting 
to tonnage by applying the density factor.  Tonnage by GT range was estimated based on the 
ratio of GT areas to total tonnage and the results summed.   

The mineral resource estimate reflects mineralization within the Fort Union Formation. Uranium 
mineralization is also found in the overlying Wind River Formation and was explored and 
reported to have been mined in limited quantities in shallow excavations (Ljung et al, March 
1974). No estimate of mineral resources within the Wind River Formation was made due to 
limited data. 

 14.2.3 Uranium Price Assumption 

Uranium does not trade on the open market and many of the private sales contracts are not 
publically disclosed.  Monthly long term industry average uranium prices based on the month-
end prices are published by Ux Consulting, LLC, and Trade Tech, LLC.  CIM Guidance of 
Commodity Pricing (November 28, 2015) reviews methods for determining an appropriate long 
term commodity price assumption for use in cut-off calculations and to support assessment of 



 

 

 

 

38 

 

"reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction".  Industry accepted practice is to use 
"Consensus Prices" obtained by collating public available commodity prices from credible 
sources. The following provides a summary of six analyst price forecasts made public in the last 
6 months.

While the analysts' forecasts vary, the median value of $US65/lb is considered reasonable by the 
author for use in cut-off determination and to assess reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction. References for these forecasts are provided in Section 27.  

14.2.4 Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction 

Based on the depths of mineralization (100 to 400 feet), average grade, thickness and GT, and 
continuity of the mineralization Clarkson Hill has reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction, however, the current mineral resource will not support extensive capital expenditures 
and would need to be developed is association with or as a tributary project to a Central 
Processing Plant (CPP)   

The deposit has reasonable concentrations of mineralization and the location of mineralization is 
defined by drilling in three dimensions. It is the author's opinion that, using a long term price of 
$US65 per pound, mineral resources at Clarkson Hill could be recoverable by a combination of 
open pit methods in combination with underground mining from the highwall, provided that the 
mined material and/or an upgraded product could be shipped a reasonable distance to a facility 
capable of processing. There is also a reasonable prospect for eventual extraction via ISR. ISR 
extraction has been successful within similar mineralization and at similar or greater depths 
within the Fort Union Formation. Recommendations in is this report include detailed study and 
evaluation of the local geohydrology with respect to ISR extraction.

14.3 Key Assumptions and Parameters 

Mineral resource estimates are based on radiometric equivalent uranium grades %eU3O8.  A 
minimum grade cut-off of 0.02 %eU3O8, minimum thickness of 2 feet, and minimum GT of 
0.20 were used in the estimations along with a bulk dry density of 16 cubic feet per ton, as 
subsequently discussed.  Indicated and Inferred mineral resources were estimated using the GT 
contour method which is appropriate for this type of mineral deposit.   

The deposit is closely drilled, approximately fifty to one hundred foot centers. The drilling 
demonstrates continuity particularly along the mineralized trends. Based on the drill density and 
the apparent continuity of the deposit along trend the mineral resource estimate would meet the 
criteria as an Indicated Mineral Resource. However, due to the lack of current drilling to verify 
the pre-2008 drill data the Author has classified the estimate as Inferred Mineral Resources under 
the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves. Mineral resources are reported based on 
minimum grade cutoffs of 0.02 weight % eU3O8 and at GT cutoffs of 0.10, 0.20 and 0.50. For 
reporting purposes the 0.20 cutoff is recommended and is thus highlighted in the mineral 
resource tabulations that follow.  

The GT Contour map shown in Figure 14.1 provides a graphical representation or model of the 
mineralization reflecting the location, quality represented by GT, and continuity of the 
mineralization. The mineral resource estimate is based on the total GT, by major stratigraphic 
horizon (lower portion of the Fort Union Formation), by hole, and above cut-off criteria.  Drill 
data reflecting the thickness (T), grade (eU3O8), and GT was summed for all intercepts meeting 
cut-off criteria by horizon for each hole.  GT and T were then contoured using standard 
algorithms based upon the geological interpretation of the deposits.  From the contoured GT 
ranges, the contained pounds of uranium were estimated by multiplying the measured areas by 
GT and applying the density factor.  Similarly, the total tonnage was estimated by contouring 
thickness and multiplying by area to obtain cubic feet, then converting to tonnage by applying 
the density factor.  Tonnage by GT range was estimated based on the ratio of GT areas to total 
tonnage and the results summed.   

14.3.1  Cut-off Criteria 

The cut-off criteria 0.02 % eU3O8, a minimum thickness of 2 feet and a minimum GT of 0.20 
was applied herein for the estimation of mineral resources. In most cases the governing criteria 
was the GT cut-off. The minimum grade, minimum thickness, and minimum GT cut-off criteria 
were assumed by the author based on similar Wyoming operations, including;

14.3.2  Bulk Density 

Site specific bulk density data is available and is summarized in Section 12 of this report.  This 
data was based on limited sample data and estimated a density of 16.9 ft3/ton. . The Author 
recommends a density of16 ft3/ton be used for all mineral resource estimations, based on 
available data and direct mining experience within the host formation.   

14.3.3  Radiometric Equilibrium 

Evaluation of radiometric equilibrium is discussed on Section 12 of this report.  Based on the 
available data and the geological setting of the mineral deposits, the Author considers it 
appropriate to assume a DEF factor of 1 for all mineral resource estimates. 

14.4   Mineral Resource Summary 

Mineral Resources for the Project are estimated by classification, meeting CIM standards and 
definitions as Inferred Mineral resources, at a 0.20 GT cut-off, as summarized in Table 14.1.

14.6 Discussion on Mineral Resources 

Mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability, but they have had technical and 
economic constraints applied to them to establish reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction.  Typically the tons and grade of the Inferred Mineral Resources are estimated on the 
basis of limited geological evidence and sampling, but the information is sufficient to imply, but 
not verify, geological and grade continuity.  At Clarkson Hill, based on the pre-2008 drill data, 
geological evidence derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and 
testing and is sufficient to reasonably assume geological and grade continuity and support 
classification of the mineral resources as indicated. However, due to the lack of verification 
drilling, the Author recommends classification as Inferred Mineral Resources.   The author 
expects the majority of the Inferred could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with 
additional drilling. 

The project is located in a geological setting and host formation for which the geology is well 
known and past mining, milling, and recovery of uranium has been successfully completed from 
similar deposits.  The Mineral Resources do have risks similar in nature to mineral resources on 
other mineral projects in general and uranium projects in particular.  Risks common to mineral 
projects include:  

 variance in the grade and continuity of mineralization from what was interpreted by 
drilling; 

 changes in future commodity demand that could significantly change the assumed 
uranium prices used in the mineral resource estimates; 

 environmental,  social and political acceptance of the project could cause delays in 
conducting work or increase the costs from what was assumed; 

 variance in operating costs from what was assumed in assessing reasonable prospects and 
in determining the cut-offs used in the mineral resource estimates; 

 differences in the mining and mineral processing recovery from what was assumed in the 
resource estimates. 
 

With regard to assessing the socio-economic, political, environmental, permitting, legal, title, 
taxation, marketing, or other relevant factors which could materially affect the estimated mineral 
resources of the Project, the following information is pertinent.  Wyoming mines have produced 
over 200 million pounds of uranium from both conventional and ISR mine and mill operations.  
Production began in the early 1950's and continues to the present.  The State has ranked as the 
number one US producer of uranium since 1994.  Wyoming is considered generally favorable to 
mine development provided established environmental regulations are met (refer to "Wyoming 
Politicians, Regulators Embrace Uranium Miners With Open Arms", Finch, 2006).  An 



 

 

 

 

43 

 

assessment by the Fraser Institute published in February 2017, ranks Wyoming as 7th out of 104 
jurisdictions using a Policy Perception Index, which indicates a very favorable perception by the 
mining industry towards Wyoming mining policies.  

The Author is not aware of any other environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
economic, marketing, political, or other relevant factors which would materially affect the 
mineral resource estimates. To the Author's knowledge there are no other significant factors that 
may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the property, provided the 
conditions of all mineral leases and options, and relevant operating permits and licenses are met.  
The reader is cautioned that additional drilling on the project may or may not result in discovery 
of additional mineral resources on the property.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

This report summarizes the mineral resources within the Clarkson Hill Claims.  The Technical 
Report provides an estimate of mineral resources, indicating that the available data does define a 
mineralization predominantly within the Sections 17 and 18, T31N, R82W.  Data available for 
this mineral resource evaluation was complete with the exception of actual drill and or core 
samples and included: 
 
 Copies of all geophysical logs; 
 Copies of all lithological logs; 
 Copies of chemical assays; 
 Copies of reports and studies referenced in the Technical Report; 
 Surveyed hole locations and elevations; 
 Drill hole maps; and 
 Geologic Cross Sections 
 
At Clarkson Hill, based on the pre-2008 drill data, geological evidence derived from adequately 
detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to reasonably assume 
geological and grade continuity and support classification of the mineral resources as indicated. 
The 2008 drilling was located outside the area for which mineral resources were estimated and 
does not affect the estimate.  Due to the lack of verification drilling, the Author recommends 
classification as Inferred Mineral Resources.   The author expects the majority of the Inferred 
could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with additional drilling. Mineral resources are 
not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability, however, based on the 
depth, grade, and geological continuity in comparison to mine operations in similar host 
formations there is a reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction. 

Wyoming is a State with a long history of uranium mining operations, is currently the largest 
producer of mined uranium in the USA, and is considered by the mining industry to be a State 
with a highly favorable Policy Perception Index. Assumptions regarding uranium prices, mining 
costs, and metallurgical recoveries are by their nature, forward-looking, and actual prices, costs, 
and performance results may be significantly different.   

The author considers the risks to the Clarkson Hill mineral resource estimates to be reasonably

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS  

Overall it is recommended that future resource estimations consider alternative mine extraction 
assumptions and mineral recovery methodologies including conventional open pit mining with 
heap leach or conventional mill recovery and/or In Situ Recovery (ISR).  The depth, local 
geologic and hydrologic conditions, and local variations in the character of mineralization, will 
influence the ultimate selection of mining method. Leach solutions from heap leach and/or ISR 
would require a similar central processing facility for final product production.  

The recommended Phase 1 non-contingent program with total estimated expenditures of 
$500,000 (US dollars) includes: 

 Confirm by drilling the potential mineralized trends within the horizons and at the locations 
indicated by historical data.  Estimated 50 drill holes at average depth of 500 feet or 25,000 
feet of drilling at an estimated cost of $250,000. 

 Confirm previous radiometric equilibrium evaluations by completing core holes and 
comparing chemical assays with radiometric data within the horizons and at the locations 
indicated by historical data.  Estimated 10 core holes at a cost of $10,000 each for a total 
estimated cost of $100,000. 

 Confirm and expand previous metallurgical studies and investigations including the 
collection of additional core samples for testing utilizing an alkaline lixiviant. Estimated cost 
$100,000. 

 Complete hydrological investigations and studies including determination of aquifer 
properties and current ground water levels and quality. Construction and testing of two 
monitor wells; estimated cost $25,000 each for a total estimated cost of $50,000. 

Upon completion of Phase 1, Phase 2 recommendations include: 

 Complete a mineral reserve and economic feasibility study including preparation of an NI 
43-101 compliant mineral reserve report. 

 Evaluate the potential for developing the Clarkson Hill Claims as a satellite operation feeding 
existing mineral processing facilities and/or consolidating the Clarkson Hill Claims with 
other properties to support the capital investment of a new central processing facility.
