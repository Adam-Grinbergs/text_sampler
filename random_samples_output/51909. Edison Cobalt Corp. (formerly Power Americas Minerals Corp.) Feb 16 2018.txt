  Kittson‐Cobalt Property – Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

1 Summary 
Property Description and Ownership 

Mr. Steven Flank, M.Sc., P.Geo. has been retained by Power Americas Minerals Corporation to produce a 

NI 43‐101‐compliant Technical Report on its Kittson‐Cobalt Project. This report has been prepared in 

accordance with National Instrument 43‐101, Companion Policy NI 43‐101CP, and Form 43‐101F.  

The claims of the Kittson‐Cobalt Property are registered to both Neil Pettigrew (5 claims) and Benjamin 

Kuzmich (10 claims) (see Table 4Five (5) mineral claims currently registered to Neil Pettigrew were 

purchased through an option agreement whereby, under the terms of the Option Agreement, Power 

Americas earned a 100% interest in the Property for an aggregate purchase price of $1,155,000 paid by a 

combination of common shares and cash, of which $1,125,000 of the purchase price was satisfied by the 

issuance of 25,000,000 common shares at a deemed price of $0.045 per common share and a one time 

only $30,000 payment. The Property is subject to an underlying 2% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty in 

favour of the underlying optioner, Mr. Neil Pettigrew, of which 1.5% may be purchased by the Company 

for $1 million (see Power Americas Press Release dated Jan 23, 2017).  Power Americas has warranted in 

writing that the terms of the option agreement have been met and Power Americas now owns 100% of 

these 5 claims.  

Ten (10) additional claims registered to the original claim staker, Mr. Ben Kuzmich, are subject to an 

option agreement disclosed by the company on November 22
nd

, 2017.  Power Americas can acquire 100% 

interest in the claims under the terms of a share purchase agreement for a purchase price of $1,430,000 

payable by the issuance of 13,000,000 common shares of the Company at a deemed price of $0.11 per 

share. This transaction is subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval.  

There are deep mining roots in the entire Cobalt Mining Camp, of which the Kittson‐Cobalt Property is 

a part. Although full‐scale mining on the Property last took place over 70 years ago, the area is steeped 

in mining tradition and history, with old headframes and mill sites peppering the landscape. The town 

of Cobalt, Ontario, is only 40 km due east, and many exploration companies are actively working in the 

area. The Kittson‐Cobalt Project is located 10 km north of Latchford, Ontario, and 130 km north of North 

Bay, Ontario, within NTS map sheet 31/M05 in the Larder Lake Mining Division of Northeastern 

Ontario. It is centered on UTM coordinates (NAD83 Zone 17N) 582,500 mE, 5,246,000 mN and 

comprises 15 contiguous unpatented mineral claims totaling 196 units and 3082 ha (30.82 km
2
). There is 

a valid exploration permit and plan related to 5 out of 15 of the claims making up the Property, granted 

by the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (PR‐16‐10965, PL‐16‐10653). 

Geology and Mineralization 

The Kittson‐Cobalt Property lies within Ontario's Proterozoic Southern Province, and is part of the 

central Cobalt Group of the Huronian Supergroup. The Property is dominated by Lorrain Formation 

arkoses and quartz arenites which are underlain by upper Gowganda Formation wackes, siltstones and 

mudstones. Nipissing diabase dykes and sills intruded along the Lorrain‐Gowganda contact, providing 



  Kittson‐Cobalt Property – Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

pathways for Co‐ and Ag‐bearing fluids to migrate into related fractures. The Latchford Fault, which is a 

dominant regional structure, runs through the eastern edge of the Property.  

There are two past‐producing Co‐Ag mines on the Property, namely the Cobalt‐Kittson and Shakt‐Davis 

Mines. The Darby Mine (also known as the Edison Mine), falls just off the property within a privately‐

held patent. Unlike the nearby Cobalt silver camp, these three mines were developed primarily for their 

cobalt, as well as gold (locally >1 oz/ton). The target of mining at the three mines was a 70‐120 m wide 

diabase dyke which cut Lorrain Formation arkoses near the Gowganda‐Lorrain contact.  

Smaltite (CoAs2) and other cobalt‐nickel sulpharsenide minerals occur in quartz‐calcite veins which are 

vertically dipping, varying in width between 0.1‐1.5 m. These mineralized veins are hosted within 

fractures and faulted zones parallel to the diabase dyke, and are focused along both the contacts of the 

diabase dyke and in parallel fractures. All three historic mines saw limited production in the pre‐1950's 

era. The Shakt‐Davis mine had the most underground development. 

Status of Exploration 

Power Americas is actively exploring the Kittson‐Cobalt Property, having very recently completed both a 

prospecting and diamond drilling program in late 2017. The focus of the current Technical Report is to 

verify and report on this recent exploration and any results available at the time of writing. Power 

Americas has indicated to the Author that the company is planning a follow‐up winter drill program. 

Conclusions and Recommendations 

The Kittson‐Cobalt Property contains two past‐producing Co‐Ag mines. Results from initial prospecting 

have demonstrated continued %‐level Co‐bearing mineralization. These samples also contain variable 

amounts of Ag. There is continued merit in exploring the contact between Lorrain and Gowganda 

metasediments in the vicinity of the Nipissing diabase units for further occurrences of Co‐bearing 

mineralization, as there is potential for additional cobalt mineralization to be discovered in and around 

the past‐producing mines as well as within the larger Property boundary.  

The Cobalt mining camp has seen renewed interest from mineral exploration companies recently as 

prices of Cobalt have risen sharply in the past two years.  This has resulted in explorers staking large 

tracts of land to better assess the mineralizing systems responsible for the numerous historical mines in 

the Cobalt area.  Mines in the Cobalt camp primarily targeted Ag mineralization while mines in the 

vicinity of the Kittson‐Cobalt property, including the Shakt‐Davis and the Cobalt‐Kittson mines, were 

known to be significantly more Co rich.  As such the Kittson‐Cobalt Property represents and excellent 

opportunity to better evaluate Co‐rich mineralization in the Cobalt camp. 

Recommended work on the Kittson‐Cobalt Property involves continued drilling in and around the 

Shakt‐Davis Mine, Cobalt‐Kittson Mine, and directly north of the Edison mine within claims held by 

Power Americas Minerals Corporation.

2 Introduction 
2.1 Issuer for Whom the Technical Report is Written 

Mr.  Steven Flank, M.Sc., P.Geo. was engaged by the Issuer, Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

("Power Americas"), to prepare an Independent Technical Report for its Kittson‐Cobalt Property (the 

"Property"), near Latchford, Ontario, Canada. The Technical Report is compliant with National 

Instrument 43‐101, companion policy NI 43‐101CP, and Form 43‐101F. Mr. Flank serves as the 

Independent Qualified Person ("QP") in accordance with Section 1.5 of NI 43‐101CP (Companion Policy) 

in that there is no circumstance that, in the opinion of a reasonable person aware of all relevant facts, 

could interfere with the QP's judgment regarding the preparation of the Technical Report. Mr. Flank is a 

member in good standing with the Association of Professional Geoscientists of Ontario (APGO #2695). 

The Statement of Qualifications for the QP is presented in Section 28.  

The QP's scope of work entailed reviewing available historical information, examining select drill core 

intercepts available in Thunder Bay at the offices of Fladgate Exploration Consulting Corporation 

("Fladgate Exploration") from Power Americas' 2017 drill program, visiting the project site, verifying 

the location of two claim posts, collecting two verification samples near a historic shaft, and analysing 

these samples for Au, Ag, and base metals such as Co. The QP also summarized these findings and 

provided recommendations for future exploration work.  

2.2 Purpose of the Technical Report 

The purpose of this Technical Report is to provide an independent review of Power Americas' Kittson‐

Cobalt Property, verifying the validity of their geochemical database, examining available drill core, and 

conducting a site visit to confirm access to the Property and to verify any significant work completed on 

the Property. The Property is a significant acquisition for the Company and this report will be used to 

comply with TSX Venture Exchange regulatory requirements. 

An independent site visit was conducted, whereupon two verification samples were taken for 

independent analysis. Except for the purposes legislated under provincial securities laws, any other use 

of this report, by any third party, is at the party's sole risk. The data supporting the statements made in 

this report have been verified for accuracy and completeness by the Author.  

2.3 Sources of Information and Data 

In conducting this study, the Author consulted and utilized various sources of information and data, 

including government publications and publicly available assessment reports. A list of the various 

sources used to prepare the current report is given in the 'References' section. 

2.4 Details of the Personal Inspection on the Property by the Qualified Person 

On December 17
th

, 2017, the Author and QP, Mr. Steven Flank, M.Sc., P.Geo., accompanied by 

prospector Mr. David Clement, visited the Kittson‐Cobalt Property near Latchford, Ontario. The 

Property was accessed by helicopter chartered from Expedition Helicopters in North Bay, Ontario. The 

helicopter landed in a clearing on the northeast shore of Kitt Lake (known locally as 'Trout Lake') at 



  Kittson‐Cobalt Property – Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

approximately 582,140 mE, 5,246,070 mN (UTM NAD83 Zone 17), proximal to cabins used as a basecamp 

during exploration activities conducted in 2017 (Figure 1 and Figure 2). 

A smaller scale map showing the site visit area is shown below, illustrating the helicopter landing site, 

historic adit and shafts of the Shakt‐Davis mine, drill collar locations from the Power Americas' 2017 drill 

program, claim post verification location, and the eastern border with an adjacent patent (Figure 2). 

Coordinates for some of these features are listed in Table 1.

From the landing site, Mr. Flank and Mr. Clement proceeded east on foot along an access trail towards 

the historic Shakt‐Davis mine. The mine site includes an open adit, as well as three open shafts, which 

appear as large, deep holes (Figure 3). The partially collapsed adit is located at the foot of a large hill 

located on the property of the cabin owner near the helicopter landing site. The open shafts are situated 

along a NE‐SW trend following a semi‐continuous trench (Figure 2). Flagging tape was observed around 

Shaft 1 (Figure 3), however there was no hazard markings around Shafts 2 or 4. Shaft 3 is known to be a 

winze and was therefore not observed on surface. 

Historical mining equipment is abandoned on site, located within 100 m of the adit, appearing to be 
relicts of mining operations at Shakt‐Davis (Figure 4). All of the above features are recorded in the 

Abandoned Mines Information System (AMIS File 03723) and are classified as "active hazards", therefore 

extreme caution must be taken.

Claim post #4 for claim 4279295 (which is also post #3 for claim 4279296) was located by following the 

E‐W trending, northern claim line for claim 4279295 (Figure 2). The location of this claim post 

corresponded to the digital location according to Claimaps and the Ontario Ministry of Northern 

Development and Mines, and the size of the post meets the requirements set out in the Mining Act 

(Figures 5 and 6). The claim line was followed on foot for 475 m to the east, until its termination at 
patent JB34.  

Most of the drill core from the 2017 drilling program conducted by Fladgate Exploration (on behalf of 

Power Americas) is stored 2.5 km from the drill sites at a boat launch on claim 4279297 (Figure 1). 
There was insufficient room at this boat launch, and also insufficient ice thickness on the Montreal 

River to the east to safely land the helicopter, therefore the Author did not inspect the drill core stored 

in the field. However, drill core intervals from holes KIT‐17‐006 and ‐007 are stored in Thunder Bay, 

Ontario, at the offices of Fladgate Exploration. These sections of drill core were made available to the 

Author for inspection. The Author compared the drill logs to the available drill core and noted that the 

lithology and mineralization was logged accurately. Sample positions were clearly marked on the split 

core, and sample tags were stapled to the core box indicating each sample interval. At the time of core 

inspection, assay results for these drill holes were not available.

4 Property Location and Description 
4.1 Area and Location of the Property  

The Kittson‐Cobalt Property is located 10 km northwest of Latchford, Ontario (population ~400), and 

130 km north of North Bay, Ontario, Canada (population 52,000) (Figure 7). The property is centered at 
UTM coordinates 582,500 mE, 5,246,000 mN. It is located on the western shore of the Montreal River, 

which becomes Bay Lake further to the south near Latchford. The Property is also located approximately 

30 km due west of Cobalt, Ontario, which experienced an immense silver mining boom in the early 

1900's and is now seeing renewed interest in cobalt exploration. 

4.2 Mineral Tenure 

The property consists of 15 mineral claims containing 196 units and 3082 ha (Table 4 and Figure 8). The 

claims are situated within Kittson, Coleman, and Brigstocke Townships, in the Larder Lake Mining 

Division, and are in good standing with the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and Mines 

(MNDM) as of the effective date of this report (December 18, 2017). 

4.3 Surface Rights Holders 

Surface titles to lands covered by the Kittson‐Cobalt Property are held by a mixture of the Province of 

Ontario (the "Crown"), as well as private surface rights holders. In Ontario the Mining Act states under 

Subsections 6(1) and 13(1) of the Ontario Regulation 308/12 that an early exploration proponent is 

required to provide notice of intent to submit an Exploration Plan or apply for Exploration Permit to 

surface rights owners associated with the lands on which prescribed early exploration activities are 

proposed. The notification is to include: 



  Kittson‐Cobalt Property – Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

 A complete Notice of Intent to Submit an Exploration Plan or Exploration Permit Application 
(Notice of Intent) 

 a copy of a proposed Exploration Plan or Exploration Permit Application 
 A map that shows the location of the proposed exploration activities. 

Having provided the notification to SRO, the proponent must provide to director of exploration 

confirmation that the required notice to all surface rights owners of the mining lands have been 

provided, when submitting an exploration plan or exploration permit application. The proponent is 

considered to have provided the confirmation by certifying the Surface Rights Owner Notification 

section of the forms for Exploration Plan or Exploration Permit Application. Failure to provide 

notification to the SRO and/or to provide the confirmation to the Director renders the application 

incomplete. Power Americas has indicated it has provided adequate consultation with the surface rights 

holders during the permitting process. A list of all private land owners within the Property was reviewed 

by the Author. In Ontario the Mining Act allows for exploration. A map showing the various patents 

where surface rights are present is presented in Figure 9.

4.4 Exploration Plans and Permits 

A valid exploration plan and permit exists for the 5 original 'core' claims within the Kittson‐Cobalt 

Property (PR‐16‐10965 and PL‐16‐10653) in the name of Mr. Neil Pettigrew, from whom Power Americas 

Minerals Corporation has an option agreement. There is no exploration plan or permit in place for the 

remaining 10 claims. 

4.5 Issuer's Title or Interest in the Property 

The claims of the Kittson‐Cobalt Property are registered to both Neil Pettigrew (5 claims) and Benjamin 

Kuzmich (10 claims) (see Table 4Five (5) mineral claims currently registered to Neil Pettigrew were 

purchased through an option agreement whereby, under the terms of the Option Agreement, Power 

Americas earned a 100% interest in the Property for an aggregate purchase price of $1,155,000 paid by a 

combination of common shares and cash, $1,125,000 of the purchase price was satisfied by the issuance 

of 25,000,000 common shares at a deemed price of $0.045 per common share and a one time only 

$30,000 payment. The Property is subject to an underlying 2% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty in 

favour of the underlying optioner, Mr. Neil Pettigrew, of which 1.5% may be purchased by the Company 

for $1 million (see Power Americas Press Release dated Jan 23, 2017).  Power Americas has warranted in 

writing that the terms of the option agreement have been met and Power Americas now owns 100% of 

these 5 claims.  

Ten (10) additional claims registered to the original claim staker, Mr. Ben Kuzmich are subject to an 

option agreement disclosed by the company on November 22
nd

, 2017.  Power Americas can acquire 100% 



  Kittson‐Cobalt Property – Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

interest in the properties under the terms of a share purchase agreement for a purchase price of 

$1,430,000 payable by the issuance of 13,000,000 common shares of the Company at a deemed price of 

$0.11 per share. This transaction is subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure, 
Physiography 

5.1 Accessibility 

The Kittson‐Cobalt property is accessed in the summer months by driving north from Latchford, 

Ontario, a small town with population of 400, which is 130 km north of North Bay along Trans‐Canada 
Hwy 11. Roughly 5 km north of Latchford is a turn‐off at Gillies westward towards Portage Bay. The 

property is accessible by boat across the Montreal River near 'Booming Out Point' (Error! Reference 

source not  found.). In the winter months the property is accessible by helicopter, landing near the 

northwest bay of Kitt Lake (locally known as 'Trout Lake'). Portions of the Montreal River and Bay Lake 

may not freeze during the winter months, and therefore winter crossings are not advised. Logging roads 

exist towards the south end of the property, which connect to the Red Squirrel Road accessed through 

the town of Temagami North. Permission is required to use these roads from the Ontario Ministry of 

Natural Resources. 

5.2 Climate and Operating Season 

The climate at Earlton, Ontario (10 km NW of the Kittson‐Cobalt Property), is typical of northern 

Ontario. During the winter months (Dec‐Mar), minimum temperatures of ‐10 to ‐20˚C are common 

(Table  5) and snowfall ranges from 20 to 40 cm monthly (Earlton Weather Station, Environment 

Canada, 2006). During the summer months (June‐Aug), the daily maximum temperatures range from 20 

to 25˚C. Mineral exploration programs are best carried out during the summer months as barges can be 

used to ferry equipment and personnel across the lake. Prospecting can only be done in the non‐winter 

months because of snow cover, and any winter drill programs require helicopter support and are limited 

by the weight restriction of slung material.

5.3 Infrastructure, Local Resources, Power, Water, Personnel, Potential Tailings 
Storage, Waste Disposal, Heap Leach Pads, Processing Plant Sites 

There is a very experienced workforce available across northeastern Ontario, with personnel available in 

Sudbury, Timmins, North Bay, and across to Thunder Bay in the northwest. Contractors, equipment and 

supplies can be brought in from New Liskeard, Ontario, or Timmins.  The Property is 10 km west of the 

all‐weather Trans‐Canada Highway (#11) that extends north from North Bay and carries on 

northwestward to Cochrane and Kapuskasing. Power is readily accessible from hydro lines along this 

route. No potential encumbrances for future mining operations are expected based on the sufficiency of 

surface rights for potential waste disposal areas, heap leach pad areas and potential processing plant 

sites in addition to the nearby availability and sources of power and water. 

The Property is located 90 km southeast of Glencore's Kidd Creek mining operations in Timmins, 

Ontario. The Timmins area is well known for its mining heritage, and current gold and base‐metal 

operations and infrastructure. An experienced mining work force, along with mining/exploration 

services and equipment, are readily available from this mining center.  

There is an airport in Timmins with service to major centers such as Toronto and Montreal, as well as 

access to two CN rail lines, one that runs east‐west along the Trans‐Canada Highway, and another that 

runs north‐south along Highway 634, passing 25 km from the project site (Error! Reference source not 

found.).

5.4 Physiography 

The Kittson‐Cobalt Property is topographically variable, with a mixture of tall ridges, swampy marches, 

lakes, and is situated at 240 masl on average. The Montreal River passes along the eastern edge of the 

Kittson‐Cobalt claims, draining southeastward towards Lake Nipissing. Bedrock exposure is also 

variable, with many outcrops along the ridge yet significant vegetation cover and quite thick forest 

including old‐growth maple, white pine, red pine, black spruce, balsam, and cedar, with alder, poplar 

and birch trees closer to creeks and rivers. 

6 History 
In the early 1900's, several high grade Co‐Ag‐veins containing Ni and varying amounts of Au were 

explored in the region, many striking NE‐SW (e.g. Watts, 1993). Marginal notes on OGS Map P3116 

declare that "mineral exploration for silver and cobalt within the map area dates from 1910 with 

prospecting, trenching, shaft‐sinking, and tunneling at the Canadian prospect (Cobalt‐Kittson mine), 

located on the Montreal River (Kittson Township), and at the Shakt‐Davis Mine on the northeastern 

shore of Kitt Lake near the Kittson‐Coleman Townships boundary." 

In 1923 an Ontario Department of Mines report describes work carried out by Crescent Silver Cobalt 

Mining Co. and a "pronounced fault vein exposed by stripping for a length of 2000 ft (610m) on surface, 

upwards to 3 ft wide has given native silver in several places" (Burrows, 1926).  

The next reported work on the prospect was in 1927 when the Cobalt‐Kittson Silver Mining Syndicate 

did some surface work, installed a small mining plant, and sank a 2‐compartment shaft to a depth of 250 

ft (ODM Report in Resident Geologist's Office, Cobalt). The following year, Cobalt‐Kittson Mines Ltd. 

was incorporated to acquire and further develop the property. The following is an excerpt from an 

Assessment Report written by H. Watts (1993) detailing the history of exploration near Shakt‐Davis: 

 "During  1928 and  1929 and  the  early part of  1930,  this  company deepened  the 

shaft to 628 ft and carried out lateral work on 4 levels: 30 ft on the 60 ft level, 386 

ft on  the 250  ft  level, 860  ft on  the 450  ft  level, and 400  ft on  the 625  ft  level. 

Values  in  Co,  Ag,  Au  and  Ni  were  encountered  but  no  positive  ore  shoots 

outlined. Channel  samples  from  the 450  ft  level  said  to be  from a vein  2.5‐4  ft 

wide, are reported to have averaged 2‐4% Co, 4‐13% Cu, 3‐6 oz/ton Ag, and $4‐

$7/ton  Au  (Au  @  $20.67/oz;  equating  to  5.4‐9.6  g/t  Au).  High  grade  Co 

mineralization was reported also  from  the other  levels. The  total production of 

the mine was  600  pounds  of  cobalt  (smaltite)  and  operations  ceased  in  1930" 

(ODM Report in Resident Geologist's Office, Cobalt. 

In 1935, Kittson Hazelton Gold Mines Ltd., an amalgamation of Cobalt‐Kittson Mines Ltd. and Hazelton 

Porcupine Gold Mines Ltd. was incorporated and acquired the claims, however, no development work 

was carried out. In 1947, title to the property was transferred to Canadian Cobalt and Metals Company 



  Kittson‐Cobalt Property – Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

Ltd. The shaft was dewatered in 1949, and it is reported that a small amount of diamond drilling was 

done although no records remain (Johns, 1985). Limited diamond drilling of an unknown amount was 

carried out in 1951 and was followed by minor underground development in 1953 and 1964 by Aconic 

Mining Corporation (OGS Map P3116). Two drill holes are reported by A. Arsenault in 1968 and 1971, 

with no assays and very meager drill log descriptions.  

During a 1987 OGS mapping survey over the Brigstocke and Kittson Townships a single sample was 

collected on the eastern shore of Harris Lake. This sample was collected of a quartz‐pyrite vein hosted in 

diabase which returned 0.02 oz/t Au, 1370 ppm Co, 730 ppm Cu and <0.10 oz/t Ag (Born and Burbidge 

1988; 1997). No follow up work on this sample has been recorded. 

Minor prospecting, trenching, and blasting was carried out on the property by H. Watts between 1991 

and 2011. A magnetometer and electromagnetometer survey was conducted over the property by the 

same prospector in 1991 (Watts, 1992). A high resolution magnetic helicopter‐borne geophysical survey 

was flown by Fugro in 2006 for Temex Resources Corp., as they held an extensive claim package in the 

region at this time. A till‐sampling program was also carried out in 2006 and 2007 for Contact Diamond 

Corp. across portions of the current property (Montgomery, 2008). 

Strike Minerals optioned the Kittson‐Cobalt property from H. Watts in 2007. Strike's Aug 26
th

 2008 

MD&A indicates exploration costs of $207,007 on the property suggesting they did some work, with a 

total write down of $227,007. They state they drilled 4 holes. Two to the east and two to the west of the 

Kittson‐Cobalt shaft, one each aimed above and below the drift level on either side. No assessment 

report was ever filed for this drilling and the option was allowed to lapse, more than likely due to falling 

commodity prices associated with the Global Financial Crisis of 2008/2009.  

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 
7.1 Regional Geology 

The Kittson‐Cobalt property lies within the eastern portion of Ontario's Proterozoic Southern Province. 

More specifically, the property falls within the central Cobalt Group of the Huronian Supergroup. The 

Kittson‐Cobalt property is dominated by Lorrain Formation arkoses and quartz arenites underlain by 

upper Gowganda Formation wackes, siltstones and mudstones. Nipissing diabase dykes and sills 

intruded along the Lorrain‐Gowganda contact. 

The dominant regional structure trends to the northwest and is represented by the Latchford Fault 

which runs through Bay Lake on the eastern edge of the property. The area has been intruded by 

Nipissing diabase sills. Regional geology is illustrated on Figure 11 andFigure 12. 

7.2 Property Geology 

An illustration of property geology is included in Figure 13. The Kittson‐Cobalt property includes two 

historic producing Co‐Ag mines, namely the Kittson‐Cobalt Mine and the Shakt‐Davis Mine. A third 

past‐producing mine called the Darby Mine (also known as the Edison Mine), falls just off the property 

on a privately‐held patent. These mines, unlike those in the nearby Cobalt silver camp, were developed 



  Kittson‐Cobalt Property – Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

primarily for their cobalt content, and interestingly possessed significant gold contents (locally >1 

oz/ton). The mines are hosted in a 70‐120 m wide diabase dyke cutting arkoses of the lower Lorrain 

Formation near the Gowganda‐Lorrain contact. Smaltite, and other cobalt‐nickel sulpharsenide 

minerals occur in calcite veins which are vertically dipping, varying in width between 0.1‐1.5 m. These 

mineralized veins are hosted within fractures and faulted zones parallel to the diabase dyke, and are 

focused along both the contacts of the diabase dyke and in parallel fractures. As a general rule, values 

for Co, Ag, Cu, and Au are usually higher in the calcite‐bearing, rather than quartz‐bearing veins. This is 

characteristic of the Kittson area, in contrast to the Cobalt mining camp. All three historic mines saw 

very limited production in the pre‐1950's era. The Shakt‐Davies mine had the most underground 

development.  

7.2.1  Shakt‐Davis Mine 

At the Shakt‐Davis mine several major calcite veins are hosted in a fractured and faulted zone within 

Nipissing diabase. This zone strikes northeast (60°) parallel to a 120 m thick vertical diabase dyke. The 
main vein varies from 1 to 7 m, whereas the vertically oriented chimney vein ranges from 1 to 3 m wide. 

Both are vertically oriented and contain smaltite (Co), cobaltite (Co), gersdorffite (Co), erythrite (Co), 

annabergite (Ni), pyrite, chalcopyrite (Cu), and niccolite (Ni). From assessment files in the Cobalt 

MNDM office, "Assays and analyses indicated 1.5% Co and minor Ag over a width of 1.37 m with select 

grab samples indicating up to 4% Co, and others with up to 2.72 oz/t Au. A further test of hand‐picked 

ore indicated values of 0.87 oz/t Au, 0.25 oz/t Ag, 7.92% Co, and 7.72% Ni. Another smaltite ore sample 

returned 97 oz/ton Ag, 0.336% Co, and 0.18% Ni (Born and Hitch, 1990) Grab samples collected by N. 

Pettigrew in 1987 from the mine dump yielded assay values of 0.25% Co, 0.75% Ni, 0.06% Cu, 0.10 oz/t 

Au, and <0.10 oz/t Ag (N. Pettigrew, personal communication). 

7.2.2 Cobalt‐Kittson Mine 

The Kittson‐Cobalt mine is hosted in a 70 m wide diabase dyke cutting arkoses of the lower Lorrain 
Formation near the Gowganda‐Lorrain contact. Chalcopyrite, smaltite and pyrite occur in several north‐

trending calcite veins which are vertically oriented and 4 to 100 cm wide. The veins are hosted in 

fractured and faulted zones parallel to the dyke. Assay results from Johns (1985) indicate 0.08 and 0.20 

oz/t gold. The total production of the mine was 600 pounds of smaltite (cobalt sulpharsenide) from the 

598 ft level (R. Thomson; Resident Geologist's Files, Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and 

Mines, Kirkland Lake; OGS Map P3116). 

7.3 Mineralization 

The main target on the Kittson‐Cobalt property is calcite‐quartz veins hosting Co‐Ag‐Ni‐Au‐Cu 

mineralization, such as arsenides (e.g. smaltite, skutterudite, cobaltite, etc.) and sulfides (e.g. 

chalcopyrite, pyrite, etc.). Veins are typically 1 to 7 m wide with the most calcite‐rich portions typically 

higher in Co, Ag, Cu and Au content. This is more typical of the Gowganda mining camp than the 

nearby Cobalt mining camp where the quartz‐rich portions of the veins typically carried the better 

grades of mineralization (OGS Misc. Paper #137, 1987). Calcite alteration may therefore be a vector to 

economic mineralization on the Kittson‐Cobalt Property.

8 Deposit Types 
The main target on the Kittson‐Cobalt property is calcite‐quartz veins hosting Co‐Ag‐Ni‐Au‐Cu 

mineralization, such as arsenides (e.g. smaltite, skutterudite, cobaltite, etc.) and sulfides (e.g. 

chalcopyrite, pyrite, etc.). Veins are typically 1 to 7 m wide with the most calcite‐rich portions typically 

higher in Co, Ag, Cu and Au content. This is more typical of the Gowganda mining camp than the 

nearby Cobalt mining camp (where the quartz‐rich portions of the veins typically carried the better

grades of mineralization (OGS Misc. Paper #137, 1987). Calcite alteration may therefore be a vector to 

economic mineralization on the Kittson‐Cobalt Property. 

9 Exploration 
A total of 150 prospecting rock samples were collected during prospecting activities throughout the 

summer and fall 2017 by Fladgate Exploration Consulting Corporation for Power Americas Minerals 

Corporation. Samples were chosen based on visual observations of Co‐Cu‐Ni‐Ag‐bearing arsenides, 

sulfarsenides, oxides, and sulfides. Samples were collected across the northern block of claims in areas 

targeted for favourable geological units and/or historical workings, and are therefore biased towards 

mineralized samples. Samples were not collected in a systematic method, for instance along a grid 

pattern, yet specifically targeting mineralization. The collection sites of the prospecting samples is 

illustrated in Figure 14.

Property in 2017.

Samples were analysed for Au, Ag, and a suite of base metals including Co, Cu, Ni, Mn, Pb, and Zn. 

Other elements were also included in the analyses, such as those present in the gangue minerals, in 

order to determine bulk mineralogy. Samples were analysed at Activation Laboratories in Thunder Bay, 

Timmins, and Ancaster, depending on the analytical package. The analytical codes used include 1A2‐Au‐

50g (fire assay/AAS), 1E‐Ag (aqua regia digest/ICP‐OES), and 8‐peroxide‐all elements (Na2O2 digest/ICP‐

OES). The Author notes that no standards or blanks were included in the sample stream.  

Significant results were returned for 25% of the total number of prospecting samples, which are those 

containing >0.1% Co (Table 6). Locations for this subset of samples are illustrated in Figure 15.

The prospecting sample containing the highest amount of Co was found adjacent to the past‐producing 

Shakt‐Davis Mine. Many other samples returned values between 1 and 4% Co at this location. Lower 

grade but still significant Co mineralization was found just north of the past‐producing Edison Mine 

(within Power Americas' claims), as well as further north near the Cobalt‐Kittson Mine. Intriguing 

results were also discovered along the corridor of claims towards the south‐southwest, where a sample 

containing 0.97% Co was found. Collectively, these prospecting samples confirm the presence of 

significant Co‐bearing mineralization within the Kittson‐Cobalt Property, and highlight areas for future 

exploration consideration.

10 Drilling 
10.1 Methods Employed 

Between September 12
th

 and November 15
th

, 2017, Power Americas drilled seven shallow BTW‐sized 

diamond drill holes totaling 166 m using an ultralight Winkie drill. This drilling was undertaken by 

Fladgate Exploration Consulting Corporation of Thunder Bay, Ontario, with Neil Pettigrew, P.Geo, 

acting as the Qualified Person and supervisor of the program. 

Drill core was logged and split on site, using a gas‐powered core saw. One half of the split core was 

placed into a sequentially numbered plastic sample bag conforming to the numbers identified in the 

sample tag book along with an identification tag from the sample tag book and the bags were securely 

fastened. The other half of the drill core was returned to the core box in its original position for future 

reference. The boxes containing the remaining half core were stacked and are currently stored on‐site, 

at a boat launch on claim 4279297. Standards and blanks were alternately inserted every 20
th

 sample. 

Standards were sourced from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Langley, British Columbia, and blank 

material from Nelson Granite Ltd., of Kenora, Ontario. Samples were then transported by Fladgate staff 

to Manitoulin Transport in New Liskeard, Ontario, who then shipped them to Actlabs in Timmins 

where they were received by the laboratory staff. The same analytical methods were employed for the 

drill core samples as for the prospecting, including Au by fire assay/AAS), Ag by aqua regia digest/ICP‐

OES, and Co, Ni and other base metals by peroxide fusion/ICP‐OES). 

All drill holes were drilled on claims 427924 and 4279295 (Figure 16). The locations and 

collar details of each hole are listed below in  

Table 7. Drill core sample sizes ranged from 0.3 to 2.0 m, but averaged 1.1 m. All reported sample widths 

are drilled core lengths, true widths are unknown as the exact orientation of the cobalt mineralized 

veins within the fracture zone(s) are unknown at this time.

10.2 Drill Log Summaries 

Fladate Exploration personnel indicated that assays from the drill program were not yet available as of 

the Effective Date of this report. However, drill logs were made available for examination and are 

summarized below.  

KIT‐17‐001 

This first drill hole was 26m in length and targetted the Shakt‐Davis fracture zone beneath overburden 
trenches. It intercepted medium‐ coarse‐grained non‐magnetic Nipissing diabase between 1.3 and 6 m, 

followed by 4m of fine‐ to medium‐grained diabase with local quartz‐carbonate alteration and small 
clacite‐smaltite‐chalcopyrite‐bearing veinlets. This intersection contained local "cobalt bloom" along 

fractures and also smaltite mineralization. After this unit, the hole became more magnetic, and from 



 
 Kittson‐Cobalt Property – Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

10.75m to 20.9m is described as Nipissing diabase which is strongly magnetic containing skeletal 

magnetite.  

KIT‐17‐002 

The second drill hole was 25.5m in length and was an undercut of the first drill hole. It intercepted 

medium‐grained moderately‐magnetic Nipissing diabase between 1.5 and 5 m, followed by a similar unit 

but more magnetic between 5 and 10 m depth. A more altered unit of diabase was encountered 
between 10 and 14.9 m depth, with pervasive carbonate veining. After this unit, the rocks became more 
massive and magnetic up to 21.75m depth, and then until the end of the hole was diabase containing 

pervasive quartz‐carbonate alteration and disseminated smaltite mineralization.  

KIT‐17‐003 

The third drill hole was 19.5m in length situated just west of the 2
nd

 Shakt‐Davis shaft. It intercepted 

massive medium‐grained moderately‐magnetic Nipissing diabase for the first 6m with trace smaltite 
mineralization, followed by 5m of the quartz‐carbonate‐altered diabase unit containing "cobalt bloom" 
and minor smaltite mineralization. The Nipissing diabase unit is encountered below 11m depth in the 

hole, again containing "cobalt bloom" and disseminated smaltite mineralization until 19.5m.  

KIT‐17‐004 

The fourth drill hole was only 3.6 m in length, situated just east of the 1
st
 Shakt‐Davis shaft. It was 

originally targetting the Shakt‐Davis fracture zone, however only intercepted the top Nipissing diabase 

unit with no "cobalt bloom" observed, however local disseminated smaltite observed near fractures from 

3.1 to 3.6 m depth. Hole was abandoned as it passed through a sand‐filled seam.  

KIT‐17‐005 

Hole 5 targeted an undercut of hole 4, in order to achieve a longer drill hole length in the same area. 

This hole ended up being 35 m in length and the first 22.6 m was the medium‐grained, massive 

Nipissing diabase with minor disseminated smaltite mineralization adjacent to epidote‐filled joints and 

fractures. Some quartz‐carbonate‐filled fractures were also encountered. From 22.6 to 29 m depth the 

rock unit became pervasively carbonate altered, with the occurrence of a silvery‐grey replacement 

mineral (perhaps a Ni‐sulfide or fine‐grained smaltite?), up to 3%. The remaining 6m of the hole is 

returned to Nipissing diabase, relatively unmineralized and massive with local calcite‐filled fractures 

and strong sausseritization. 

KIT‐17‐006 

Hole 6 was an undercut of hole 3, just west of the 2
nd

 Shakt‐Davis shaft, and reached 29m in length. The 

first 10 m intercepted the massive, moderately magnetic Nipissing diabase which was locally cut by 

epidote‐calcite‐filled fractures with trace disseminated smaltite. Between 10.5 and 13.7 m depth 
appeared to be the pervasively‐carbonate‐altered diabase unit, similar to the other drill holes. This unit 

contained a calcite‐dolomite breccia vein and >10% of a 'silver grey' replacement mineral (described as 

either smaltite or a 'bronzy sulphide'). The hole returned to the more massive Nipissing diabase this 



 
 Kittson‐Cobalt Property – Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

time with 'cobalt bloom' along fractures. Then returned back to the pervasively quartz‐carbonate‐

altered unit between 17 and 23 m depth. The hole ended in massive Nipissing diabase at 29m.  

KIT‐17‐007 

Hole 7 was targetting the Shakt‐Davis fracture zone, just east of the 2
nd

 Shakt‐Davis shaft, and reached 

27.5 m in length. The first 15.5 m intercepted the massive, moderately magnetic Nipissing diabase. 
Between 15.5 and 27.5 m depth appeared to be the pervasively quartz‐carbonate‐altered diabase unit, 
similar to the other drill holes, yet lots of mineralization encountered in the form of "cobalt bloom" and 

the same 'bronzy sulfide' mineral that might be a Ni‐arsenide or smaltite. The hole ended in this 

perceived mineralized unit. 

10.3 Summary of Drilling Results 

The drilling targeted the Shakt‐Davis fracture zone beneath overburden‐filled pits and trenches. The 

historic trenching had been so thorough that very little in  situ vein material remained in bedrock at 

surface making evaluation of the grade and thickness of the fracture zone difficult. The program 

intersected the fracture zone that hosts the Shakt‐Davis mineralization over a strike length of 55 m and 

tested it to a maximum depth of ~30 m. The fracture zone ranged from 5 to 13 m wide (drilled core 

length) and hosted several 0.1‐1.0 m quartz‐carbonate veins surrounded by intense carbonate alteration. 

Although assay results were not available as of the effective date of this report, observations within the 

drill logs suggest that the majority of cobalt mineralization occurs as smaltite within quartz‐carbonate 

veins hosted within a brittle fracture zone, and a significant portion may also occur as erythrite ("cobalt 

bloom"), a powdery pink coating on joint and fracture surfaces.  

11 Sample Preparation, Analysis, and Security 
No sample preparation was needed for the prospecting samples. Collected samples were put directly 

into individual sample bags with sample tags and transported by truck back to Thunder Bay, Ontario, in 

the possession of the QP for Fladgate Exploration, Neil Pettigrew. Samples were transported directly to 

Activation Laboratories in Thunder Bay, Ontario where they were then received, processed, and 

analyzed.  As mentioned above, the analytical codes used include 1A2‐Au‐50g (fire assay/AAS), 1E‐Ag 

(aqua regia digest/ICP‐OES), and 8‐peroxide‐all elements (Na2O2 digest/ICP‐OES). No standards or 

blanks were included in the sample stream of the prospecting samples, however standards and blanks 

were alternatively placed every 20 samples for the drilling.  

All of the drill core was logged and split onsite using a gas powered core saw. One hundred percent of 

the core was split and sampled. The remaining half of the core was replaced in the core boxes and the 

core is stored onsite. Standards and blanks were alternately inserted every 20
th

 sample. Standards were 

sourced from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Langley, British Columbia, and blank material from 

Nelson Granite Ltd., of Kenora, Ontario. No duplicate samples were included in the sample stream. The 

nature and extent of QA/QC procedures implemented in the drill program are sufficient for a 166 m 

program, in order to provide adequate confidence in the data received. All drill core samples were 



 
 Kittson‐Cobalt Property – Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

transported by Fladgate Exploration personnel to Manitoulin shipping in New Liskeard, Ontario, and 

shipped directly to the Timmins location of Activation Laboratories for analysis, with security tags in 

place. Samples were received, processed, and analysed following same methods as described above for 

the prospecting samples. 

Activation Laboratories is independent of the Issuer of this Technical Report. It is an accredited 

analytical facility, with a Quality Control System accredited to "international quality standards through 

the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission 

(ISO/IEC) 17025 (ISO/IEC 17025 includes ISO 9001 and ISO 9002 specifications), with CAN‐P‐1578 

(Forensics), CAN‐P‐1579 (Mineral Analysis) and CAN‐P‐1585 (Environmental) for specific registered tests 

by the SCC. The accreditation program includes ongoing audits which verify the QA system and all 

applicable registered test methods." (Source: www.actlabs.com) 

In the Author's opinion, the sample preparation techniques, sample security, and analytical procedures 

followed for both the prospecting and drill core samples is adequate for this stage of exploration. 

12 Data Verification 
Data associated with the 2017 prospecting, sampling, and drilling program conducted by Fladgate 

Exploration on behalf of Power Americas has been entered into a master database in Microsoft Excel 
format, and this database has been reviewed and verified by the Author. Listed information includes 

sample IDs, UTM coordinates, dates, descriptions, and assay results. All samples within the database are 

accounted for in laboratory certificates and approximately 10% of the data was verified for accuracy. No 

assay results were available for the drill core at the time of writing this document.   

One aspect of the site visit performed by the Author was to collect a few verification samples in and 

around the 2017 prospecting and drilling programs. The site visit was conducted in December, and there 

was roughly 30 cm of snow cover blanketing all outcrops and historic mine workings and waste piles, 

therefore it was challenging to locate outcrop from which to take verification samples. In order to find 

samples that might be comparable to those in the Power Americas sample database, muck piles adjacent 

to the shafts were investigated. Two samples with orange flagging tape and numbering corresponding to 

prospecting samples 469022 and 469025 were located in muck piles adjacent to Shafts 2 and 1, 

respectively (Figure 17).

taken. 

 

The coordinates were compared to those in the Power Americas master database and found to be 

accurate to within 5‐10 m (Figure 2, Table 8).

The Author then collected two grab samples (KIT‐SF‐001 and KIT‐SF‐002) from the muck piles adjacent 

to Shaft 1 and 2, respectively, to verify reported Co‐Ag mineralization in the area (Figure 18). Both 

samples were observed to have visible Co‐oxide mineralization ("Co‐bloom"), likely corresponding to 

pink‐coloured erythrite. Sample coordinates and ID's are shown in Table 8. The samples were 

transported by the Author back to Thunder Bay, Ontario, and submitted to Activation Laboratories Ltd.

methods as employed during Power Americas' 2017 exploration programs for Au, Ag, Co, Ni, among 

other base metals. The assay certificates are included in Appendix I and results displayed in Table 9.

Analysis of the two verification samples revealed the presence of Co (0.48 and 0.97 wt%) and Ag (0.5 

and 1.3 ppm). These metals are most likely contained within the observable "Co bloom" (erythrite), 

however a more detailed petrological study could determine the specific type(s) of mineralization 

present. Anomalous Ni was also present, consistent with historical descriptions of Co‐Ni‐bearing 

skutterudite ([CoNi]As2) mineralization in the vicinity of the Kittson‐Cobalt property and specifically 

the Shakt‐Davis mine (Born and Hitch, 1990). Results of those samples corroborate the presence of Co, 

Ni, As, S, and Ag on the Kittson‐Cobalt Property, within the range of values reported from the 

prospcting samples collected by Power Americas.  

Four diamond drill hole collars, marked with birch timbers placed into the open holes, were observed 

on the Property, an example of which is shown in Figure 19. Collar coordinates taken by the Author 

during the site visit corresponded well to those listed in Power Americas' database (Table 10).

Report.  

14 Mineral Resource Estimates 
No mineral resource estimates have been undertaken for the Kittson‐Cobalt Property. 

23 Adjacent Properties 
The Kittson‐Cobalt Property is part of the larger Cobalt Mining Camp. The area is steeped in mining 

tradition and history, with old headframes and mill sites peppering the landscape and recent interest in 

cobalt exploration has brought many companies into the area to explore. The two companies working in 

close proximity to the Kittson‐Cobalt Property are Tri‐Origin Exploration Ltd. on their South Abitibi 

gold project (http://www.triorigin.com/), and MetalsTech Bay Lake Cobalt Inc., an Australian junior 

mining company, on their Bay Lake Cobalt project (http://www.metalstech.net/projects/bay‐lake‐high‐

grade‐cobalt/). Information from these companies is publicly available on their websites. 

Tri Origin's South Abitibi project lies 1 km south of the southern boundary of claim 4287875 of the 

Kittson‐Cobalt Property. The property is presently being explored for gold and base metal potential in 

Archean rocks underlying the Proterozoic rocks hosting cobalt mineralization. From a news release 

disseminated by Tri Origin in August of 2017, their main exploration target covers a 15 km long trend of 

poorly‐mapped, prospective volcanic rocks of the southern Abitibi greenstone belt. Results of Tri 

Origin's geological investigations indicate that 50% of this area is covered by younger sedimentary 
rocks of Proterozoic age, and 50% by older Archean volcanic rocks. The Proterozoic rocks have only 
received a cursory amount of surface prospecting. Tri‐Origin has recently completed geological 

mapping, prospecting, and a limited diamond drilling program targeting the underlying Archean rocks 

and found anomalous nickel, zinc, copper and cobalt. No resource estimates have been completed on 

this project. 

The Bay Lake Cobalt project held by MetalsTech Bay Lake Cobalt Inc. is contiguous to the easternmost 

border of the Kittson‐Cobalt Property and claim 4287875. Information on the MetalsTech website 

indicates that they have held the project since April 2017. While there are historic mining shafts on the 

property, MetalsTech is the first company to complete any modern exploration. Recent results of the 

exploration work done by MetalsTech, included in the corporate presentation on website, indicate 

surface sampling results of for example 15.36% cobalt.  

The QP and Author of this report has been unable to verify the information described above (in Section 

23 "Adjacent Properties"). This information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on Power 

Americas' Kittson‐Cobalt Property, which is the subject of the current Technical Report.

24 Other Relevant Data and Information 
There is no further relevant data or information needing to be disclosed that is not already part of this 

43‐101 Technical Report in another section. 

25 Interpretations and Conclusions 
The mineralization on the Kittson‐Cobalt Property is hosted in Proterozoic quartz‐carbonate veins 

within brittle fracture zones in Nipissing diabase. These fracture zones are roughly parallel to an 

extensive E‐W‐trending diabase dyke system. Historical work indicates this project represents a cobalt‐

gold‐rich, silver‐poor example of the more classical silver‐rich mineralization found in the Cobalt camp 

proper, directly east of the Kittson‐Cobalt Property. This cobalt‐gold style of mineralization is found 

elsewhere in the larger cobalt embayment such as in the Silver Centre and Temagami areas, and was 

historically not as extensively exploited due to their lower silver grades. As a result, whereas much of the 

near‐surface silver‐rich cobalt‐type mineralization has been mined‐out, much of the lower silver, higher 

cobalt‐type mineralization remains in the ground. 

A modest prospecting and drilling program was conducted by Fladgate Exploration, on behalf of Power 

Americas, with assay results for only the prospecting samples available to the Author as of the effective 

date of this report. Significant results were returned from the prospecting samples, with >0.1% Co in 25% 

of the 150 sample population. The highest value achieved was 3.66% Co, from a sample taken near the 

past‐producing Shakt‐Davis Mine. There are no reasonable circumstances that may affect either the 

reliability or level of confidence in the exploration information presented herein for this early‐stage 

"grassroots" project.   

The Kittson‐Cobalt Property merits continued exploration, as limited work performed to date by Power 

Americas supports the reported historic cobalt grades and widths. The project encompasses an extensive 

prospective E‐W‐trending fracture zone, only portions of which have been tested historically. While 

substantial underground development was conducted on the project, very few historic records of this 

work remain, making evaluation of the cobalt mineralization difficult. Therefore, a modern exploration 

program including diamond drilling is required in order to better evaluate the quality and quantity of 

the cobalt mineralization on the project.  

The Cobalt area has been mined extensively in the past, including from shafts within the Kittson 

Property boundaries.  This does not guarantee that mineralized zones being explored today will have 

economic grades or widths by todays standards.   

26 Recommendations 
26.1 General 

There are three past‐producing Co‐Ag mines on, or near, Power Americas' Kittson‐Cobalt Property, 

including the Shakt‐Davis, Cobalt‐Kittson, and Edison Mines. From these historical workings as well as 



 
 Kittson‐Cobalt Property – Power Americas Minerals Corporation 

the extensive Ag mining that took place to the east near Cobalt, Ontario, the geological model 

constraining the mineralization is quite well known. "Copper, cobalt, silver, and gold mineralization is 

related to Nipissing diabase dikes and sills intruding arkoses of the Lorrain Formation and laminated 

shaley mudstones of the Firstbrook Member in the Gowganda Formation" (OGS Misc. Paper #137, 1987). 

It was even mentioned that "the same narrow (70 m wide) Nipissing diabase dike hosts all three 

deposits", referring to the three mines in and around the Kittson‐Cobalt Property.  

Prospecting sampling conducted by Fladgate Exploration for Power Americas in the fall of 2017 centered 

mostly around the past‐producing mines has resulted in samples containing 3.66 wt% Co. A verification 

sample collected by the Author during the site visit contained 0.976 wt% Co, confirming the presence of 

this base metal, along with Ni, As, and Ag. Visual inspection of the mineralogy suggests significant "Co 

bloom", or erythirite, a pink‐coloured Co‐As‐bearing hydroxide which may become the target mineral 

for exploration. Smaltite, or skutterudite, is also suggested, by the presence of Ni, Co, and As in the 

same sample. It has been documented that "mineralized veins in the Kittson occur in parallel fracture 

zones near margins of the diabase body…and as a general rule, values of Co, Ag, Cu, and Au are usually 

higher in calcite rather than quartz veins…which is more similar to the Gowganda than the Cobalt 

mining camp…" (OGS Misc. Paper #137, 1987).  

Continued exploration of this Property is warranted, due to the apparent Co grades within the modest 

2017 prospecting program, as well as the favourable extent to which the Property covers past‐producing 

Co‐Ag mines and the contact regions between intruding Nipissing diabase and host metasediments of 

the Lorrain and Gowganda Formations. A short 166 m drill program was completed by Power Americas 

late in 2017, however as of the Effective Date of this report, Fladgate Exploration informed the Author 

that assay results were not yet available to review. Given the relatively limited scope of this 

reconnaissance drilling program, the Author is satisfied that results from the 2017 drilling program 

would not materially affect the conclusions of the current Technical Report.  

26.2 Phase 1 Recommendations 

While the historic mining areas within the Kittson‐Cobalt Property are known to contain cobalt 

mineralization, very little documentation survives from when they were in operation, making it difficult 

to evaluate their economic potential. This is further exacerbated by the lack of recent diamond drilling. 

Phase 1 of the recommended work therefore involves a diamond drill program targeting specific areas 

outlined from the compilation effort.  

A modest drill program consisting of 9‐10 diamond drill holes located near the historic Shakt‐Davis 

mine would further elucidate the nature and extent of mineralization at this prospective site. 

Prospecting around the historic Cobalt‐Kittson mine has produced samples containing 0.15‐0.24 wt% 

Co, warranting inclusion of this area in the drill plans as well. Prospecting throughout the entire 

Property, including the two southern claims, should also continue, as well as north of the historic 

Edison mine, within the Kittson‐Cobalt Property boundaries. 

A summary of proposed expenditures for the Phase I drilling portion of the program is shown in Table 

11.

26.3 Phase 2 Recommendations 

Phase 2 recommended exploration is contingent upon the success of the Phase 1 drilling program. This 

second phase of exploration for the Kittson‐Cobalt Property would involve continued drilling within 

areas of interest, targeting veins and fracture zones that contained Co‐bearing mineralization discovered 

from Phase 1. This program would target these known zone(s) of mineralization at greater depth, and 

along strike, staying within the favourable geological contact zone.
