Enterprise Capital Corp.  – NI 43-101 – June 2012 Executive Summary vii 
AC/1631618.1 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Introduction 
Enterprise Capital Corporation (TSX-V: ECE.P), incorporated under the laws of 
Alberta, Canada hereinafter referred to as Enterprise, has reached an agreement 
with Ecuador Capital Corp. (Ecuador Capital), incorporated under the laws of British 
Columbia, Canada with respect to the reverse takeover of Enterprise by Ecuador 
Capital (the "Transaction"). It is expected that the Transaction will constitute the 
qualifying transaction for Enterprise in accordance with policies of the TSX Venture 
Exchange (the "Exchange"), and this report is prepared in connection with the 
Transaction. 

Ecuador Capital acquired mineral assets in Ecuador through its acquisition 
(the "Acquisition") of 90% ownership of Condormining Corporation S.A. 
(Condormining), incorporated under the laws of Ecuador, from Ecometals Limited 
(Ecometals), and formerly named Goldmarca Ltd (Goldmarca) (TSX: EML). 
Condormining is the concession holder of the Condor Gold Project mineral 
properties.  Pursuant to the Acquisition, Ecuador Capital agreed to pay Ecometals 
US$7.7 million, all of which has been paid.  As of 1st January 2011, Ecuador Capital 
assumed management of Condormining and the Condor Gold Project and has 
transferred its 90% ownership of Condormining to Ecuador capital's wholly-owned 
subsidiary, Ecuador Gold and Copper Inc. The exploration concessions cover 
7,124.5 hectares bordering Peru and have been subject to extensive exploration 
since 1995 with more than $40 million invested and 84,830 metres of drilling 
completed. In addition Ecuador Capital, through its wholly-owned subsidiary 
Corporacion FJTX Exploration S.A., subsequently acquired all interests in the 
adjacent FJTX concession (960ha) for US$500,000 from Ecometals (and its 
subsidiary). 

Mineral Concessions 
The Condor Gold Project forming the qualifying transaction encompasses all the 
concessions named as Viche Conguime I, Viche Conguime II, Viche Conguime III, 
Hitobo and FJTX and is located in the Zamora-Chinchipe Province, Ecuador.  The 
project is within a portion of a regional Mesozoic (Jurassic-Cretaceous) fold and 
thrust belt and contains numerous precious metal occurrences (see Table 1 below).

metres of drilling on the Condor Gold Project from 2004 to 2008 by Ecometals and/or 
Goldmarca. 

 

Background and Status of Exploration & Development 
This region in southeast Ecuador, which contains the Condor Gold Project has 
received considerable geological attention following the discovery and definition of 
the 'Fruta del Norte' gold deposit by Kinross/Aurelian Resources, which is located 
approximately  31km north of Condor and the Mirador copper deposits of China 
Railway, Tongling (formerly Corriente Resources), which is located 55km to the 
north. Dorato Resources´ concessions and camp adjoin the Condor Gold Project on 
the Peruvian side of the Ecuador-Peru Border some 2km from the Condor 
exploration camp. The Condor Gold Project concessions surround the Jerusalem 
project (225 hectares) of Dynasty Metals and Mining (TSX:DMM) (see Figure 1). 

The Condor Gold Project covers an area of 80.85 km2, running approximately 18km 
north- south and up to 10km east-west. The Condor Gold Project mining concessions 
cover the bulk of the Condor mining camp and extend southward to cover the 
porphyry copper-gold potential that TVX Gold Inc. ("TVX") explored for in late 1990s 
at the Santa Barbara deposit and El Hito prospect. Gold has been mined in the area 
since pre-Columbian times, after which there was no activity until it was rediscovered 
in the early 1980s when the district became subject to small scale, and primitive, 
mining activity by informal miners. There are no figures available for the amount of 
gold (or other metals) that have been extracted from this area by these informal 
mining activities.

TVX extensively explored the Condor Gold Project property during the period from 
1993 through 1999. This work included geochemistry, geophysics, extensive and 
widespread drilling totalling 51,439 metres, as well as underground tunnelling and 
sampling and completion of a feasibility study of a number of gold (+silver) and gold-
silver-zinc-lead veins in the Condor Property (Chinapintza Deposit). TVX completed a 
feasibility study in 1996 for Chinapintza. 

From 2003 to 2010 Goldmarca worked the project and began a campaign of 
mapping, sampling, trenching, diamond drilling (33,390 metres), geophysical survey, 
both IP and magnetometry totalling 52.8 line-km and metallurgical test work. 
Goldmarca completed an in-house feasibility study in 2005 and obtained an 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) approval for exploitation of a 500 TPD mine 
in 2006. See Table 2.

Geology and Mineralization 
Four types of mineral systems are considered to exist at the Condor Project:  

• Low sulphidation epithermal gold bearing diatremes, volcaniclastics and 
breccia pipes; 

• Polymetallic (Au,Ag,Pb,Zn) mesothermal veins; 
• Structurally controlled high grade epithermal gold veins; and 
• Gold, copper/gold and copper/molybdenum porphyry systems. 

The Northern Condor Sector mineralization comprises 'low sulphidation' 
mineralization which is hosted by a series of breccia pipes, as well as by the 
numerous narrow fault-veins of the Chinapintza Vein System.  

The mineralization in the Condor Sector is developed in a Lower Cretaceous felsic 
volcanic-intrusive complex which overlies and intrudes the granodiorites of the Lower 
Jurassic Zamora Batholith. This epithermal district is hosted by multiple eruptive 
centres within a rhyolitic volcanic complex that has undergone multiple intrusive and 
brecciation events; these multiple events have overlapped and possibly deformed 
adjacent centres, including the eruptive products such as lapilli tuffs, resulting in 
complex geology. Much structural interpretation is still required. 

The Chinapintza vein system Complex that straddles the Condor Gold Project, the 
adjacent Dynasty Metals Jerusalén Project to the north, and the Los Cuyes and, 
Soledad-San Jose-Guaya Complexes, that are hosted within breccia complexes 
associated with intrusive volcanism. The predominant controls on mineralization are 
interpreted as a Mesozoic diatreme emplacement and associated brecciation events, 
plus a series of broadly N-E and N-W trending structures that are partly related to the 
development of the regional fold-thrust belt. 

The Condor Sector is contained within the Vinche Conguime 1 Concession which 
forms part of a larger concession block that covers the Condor Gold Project.  

The main focus of exploration during Goldmarca´s previous phase was in the Condor 
Sector on the proposed development of higher grade mineable gold-silver resources 
at the Soledad, San Jose I and Enma deposits and drill definition resource of bulk, 
low-grade tonnage, gold-silver mineralization at the Los Cuyes deposit which is an 
intrusive porphyry diatreme and breccia complex. 

Mineralization here is developed within intrusive and & extrusive volcanic, steeply 
dipping, almost cylindrical-shaped bodies that are typically strongly altered and 
brecciated. 

Subsequently Goldmarca focused on the larger scale bulk deposit potential by 
reinterpretation and deeper drilling of Los Cuyes Complex , Soledad - San Jose - 
Guaya complex and Santa Barbara deposit. 

Emphasis should be placed on further structural interpretation studies which will help 
establish detailed structural controls on mineralization. The NW and NE trending 
lineaments may well be the focus or 'conduit' for igneous bodies and associated 
breccias. They commonly constrain large blocks of mineralised sequences and could 
have acted as pathways for mineralised fluids to pass and deposit.

In 2007, 4,278 metres of diamond drilling was carried out in the Soledad- San Jose- 
Guayas Rhyodacite Complex. The drill results indicated deep and widespread 
disseminated mineralization (Au +Ag +Zn) inside the peripheral occurrences of 
Soledad San Jose I and Guayas mineralization. A possible zonation of silver-gold 
mineralization requires further definition and interpretation. The host lithology 
outcrops on the surface with lateral extent approximately 500 metres long and 350 
metres wide and represents a large bulk Au + Ag + Zn target of promise. Further drill 
definition is required. 

The Enma Complex comprising Enma Breccia, Conguime Rhyolite Porphyry and the 
Brechas Negras structural intersection zone, represents the south east border of the 
Condor Gold Project. 

This presents a first-priority drill target to increase the known gold and base metals 
mineralization. 

The Complex is also associated with the adjacent Peruvian porphyry and skarn zone 
of Dorato. Additional drilling is warranted to locate extensions to known 
mineralization inside the complex. 

There is potential for extensions to the Chinapintza gold veining under an effusive 
'cover' sequence on and south of La Pangui as insufficient drilling has tested the 
area. Some mapping should be carried out in this area with geophysical results used 
to generate drill targets as well as Mobile Metal Ion ("MMI") geochemical sampling 
conducted in parallel to hone in on the "Centre of Gravity" from targets thus derived. 

Disseminated mineralization is related to late-stage effusive volcanism, quartz 
feldspar porphyry intrusions, small hydrothermal breccias and/or zones of silica 
flooding, many of which appear localized along the margin of the main intrusive 
complex and are both open along strike. 

There is considered to be a strong possibility of increasing the quantity of 
mineralization and the discovery of new mineralised shoots at depth of Los Cuyes 
Complex, Soledad-San Jose- Guaya Complex and the Enma Complex. 

To the south, Santa Barbara hosts structurally controlled Au-Cu mineralization and 
the El Hito prospect has a Cu-Mo +/- Au mineralization signature. 

The mineralization developed at Santa Barbara is hosted with structures developed 
in andesitic-basaltic volcanics of the Jurassic Misahualli Formation and in association 
with dioritic porphyry intrusives. This geological unit is the same as that which hosts 
the Kinross/Aurelian Fruta del Norte gold deposit. 

The margins of porphyry El Hito and the north and south extensions of porphyry 
Santa Barbara are considered important because of the potential to increase mineral 
resources. There is surface rock sampling evidence that this is an epithermal system 
preserved in the hill to the south and southwest of Cerro Conguime.

Recommendations 
It is strongly recommended that mineralogical studies of the various ore types are 
conducted to support the previous metallurgical test works and extractive metallurgy 
investigations, particularly for the known deposits of Los Cuyes, Soledad-San Jose 1-
Guaya, Enma, Santa Barbara and El Hito. 
 
The Condor Gold Project warrants a two-phase work program totalling 47,000 metres 
of infill, extension and exploration drilling with the aim being to increase the estimated 
mineral resources and become a producing company. Phase 1 will consist of 10,000 
metres of infill, extension and exploration drilling, and Phase 2 will consist of a further 
37,000 metres of infill, extension and exploration drilling. 
 
The estimated cost to complete Phase 1 of the exploration is approximately 
US$2,200,000, and the estimated cost to complete Phase 2 is approximately 
US$6,800,000.

Scope of Work 
The scope of work is to provide an updated NI 43-101 Form 1 technical report on the 
Condor Gold Project with particular emphasis on updating the Mineral Resource 
Estimates. 

 

Project team  
The current reporting team is headed by geologist Allen J. Maynard with the mineral 
resource estimates being provided by geologist Philip A Jones. Capable on-site 
support was provided by local Ecuadoran geologists Edgar Gordillo, Fabian Toledo 
and Xavier Toledo, as well as mining engineer Mr R. Slaughter, all of whom have 
extensive 'Hands-On' experience with the project over the past 15 years. 

 

Basis of the Technical Report  
Information provided is based on both historical and current work. Sources of 
information used in this report included available public documents from diverse 
sources, including those submitted to the Ecuador Government by the previous 
workers, plus other reports made available to the author by Ecometals, Goldmarca 
and Condormining, along with personal observations made by the authors during the 
property visits.  

There is historic artisanal, small scale mining activity that continues in several areas, 
viz. Chinapintza and La Pangui (underground, narrow vein mining), plus a small 
underground operation adjacent to Los Cuyes.  

Interpretation and assessment of the information collected on the Condor Gold 
Project property in this report is to provide an updated resource estimate plus an 
evaluation of the exploration potential with recommendations for further work. 

Site visits  
Mr. Maynard visited the Condor Gold Project property from July 9th to 11th, 2010 to 
inspect the surface geology and topography and confirm that the sampling 
procedures met CIM Code standards.  Reference samples were also taken of 
selected core as a QA/QC check, as discussed later in this report.  Further 
discussions with Ecometals/Goldmarca personnel were held in Quito between 
July 7th and 12th 2010 to discuss logistics as well as government permitting and 
concessions. A second field trip was conducted by Mr. Maynard from January 14th to 
17th, 2011 to re-visit the Condor Gold Project property and discuss the proposed 
exploration program with the site personnel.  

Mr. Jones made a site inspection field trip from April 10th to 16th, 2011 during which 
the Condor Gold Project properties were visited to inspect the geology and

topography. Discussions were also held with the site personnel on core sampling, 
storage and security, resource modelling methods, CIM Code requirements, setting 
up a central database for the project and the proposed exploration program. 

RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

This report has been prepared by Al Maynard & Associates Pty Ltd. for Enterprise.  
The information, opinions and conclusions contained herein are based on information 
made available from Ecometals (and Goldmarca, as it then was), Condormining, 
Ecuador Capital and third party sources prior to and during the preparation of this 
report, as listed in the 'References' or as otherwise noted in the report.  As 
understood by the authors, no other work has been done to alter or change the 
exploration of the Condor Gold Project as outlined in this report. 

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 

Land Tenure 
The Condor Gold Project is located approximately 400km south-southeast of the 
Ecuadorean capital, Quito, and approximately 40km east of the regional capital town 
of Zamora, within the Parroquia Nuevo Quito, Paquisha Canton and Parroquia 
Guaysimy, Nangaritza Canton, close to the Peruvian border. 

UTM centroid  
The UTM centroid is 9,552,000N and 770,000E (Datum: PSAD-56 Zone 17 S). 

Mineral rights 
In Ecuador, all mineral concession boundaries are submitted by applicants to the 
relevant Ecuadorean government agency in standard documents describing the 
boundary corners in UTM grid coordinates.  If the areas applied for have not been 
already granted to other parties the areas applied for are granted to the applicants.  
No physical pegging of boundaries is required.  The concessions are valid in their 
entirety for 10 years provided that annual reports are submitted on time, expenditure 
commitments are met and annual rents are paid. 

The Vinche Conguime 1, 2, 3 and Hitobo concessions are wholly owned by 
Condormining, a 90% owned subsidiary of Ecuador Capital (the 90% ownership is 
held by Ecuador Capital's wholly-owned subsidiary, Ecuador Gold and Copper Inc.). 
Ecuador Capital, through its other wholly-owned subsidiary Corporacion FJTX 
Exploration S.A., has also acquired from Ecometals (and its subsidiary) all interests 
in the FJTX Concession adjacent to Vinche Conguime.

The Condor Gold Project comprises a group of four concessions owned by 
Condormining, (Viche Conguime I, Viche Conguime II, Viche Conguime III, Hitobo) 
and one concession (the FJTX Concession) subsequently acquired by Ecuador 
Capital (and its wholly-owned subsidiary), from Ecometals (and its subsidiary). The 
Condor Gold Project area is a total of 8,025 ha. (80.25km2). 

In December 2002, Goldmarca and DINE, (Direccion de Industrias del Ejercito) 
entered into a joint venture to explore several areas. The early concessions that 
formed part the original agreement were VICHE CONGUIME I, VICHE CONGUIME 
II, VICHE CONGUIME III, and HITOBO, (the Condor Concessions). Goldmarca  also  
purchased 100% of the adjacent FJTX concession which was operated separately .

AC/1631618.1 

In June, 2003 agreement was reached with DINE to consolidate the previous 
agreements, which covered separate concessions.  This resulted in Goldmarca 
acquiring 70% equity in the Condor Gold Project. 

On 7th May 2007, Goldmarca increased its interest in the Condor Gold Project to 
90% through its 90% shareholding in a new company, Condormining Corporation SA 
that was formed to own the Condor Concessions in exchange for the following 
compensation to DINE: 

1. Payment of US$2.5M 
2. 10% Net Profit carried interest 
3. Right of first refusal on acquisition of remaining 10% interest 
4. Removal of the obligation to initiate mining and gold production 

 
Goldmarca subsequently changed its name to Ecometals Limited, and on December 
31st 2010, Ecometals transferred and sold its 90% shareholding in Condormining to 
Ecuador Capital in consideration for payments totalling US$7.7 million. The initial 
cash payment of US$2.0 million was paid on closing of the shares sale transaction 
with a further US$5.7 million paid since then.   

Ecuador Capital now owns (through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ecuador Gold and 
Copper Inc.) 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of Condormining, which 
maintains the surface rights corresponding to the Condor Gold Project.  The Condor 
Gold Project area is within an unsurveyed, agricultural region, with land claims 
registered at INDA, (Instituto Nacional de Desarollo Agrario).  INDA does not grant 
mineral rights. 

In 2011, Ecuador Capital, through a new Ecuador wholly owned subsidiary, 
Corporacion FJTX Exploration S.A., arranged for the subsequent purchase of the 
100% interest in the FJTX concession for US$500,000, all of which has been paid. 

Based on information provided by Ecometals' legal counsel, there are no known 
outstanding legal mineral claims on the Condor Concessions. A summary of the 
pertinent exploration concessions is presented below:

The requisite Annual Environmental Audit for 2011 was filed in March 2012, along 
with a work/exploration program proposal. 

As part of its overall land review with respect to royalties and environmental 
regulations, in 2008, the Ecuador government temporarily suspended mining and 
exploration operations.  The new Mining and Environmental Laws regime has been 
proclaimed, and consequently, mining and exploration activities now operate in 
Ecuador under a more de-centralized, professional regulatory control and 
supervisory environment. 

Reports describing in detail all exploration work and expenditures carried out by the 
concession owners are required to be submitted annually to the Ecuadorean 
government by a set anniversary date.  It is understood by the author that all such 
reports have been submitted and that there are no outstanding reports. 

All mine production is subject to royalty payments to the Ecuadorean government.  
The relevant royalties are as follows: 

• Gold and silver; minimum of 5% gross value of bullion produced 

• Base metals including copper, lead, zinc; minimum of 5% gross value of 
metal produced. 

No other royalties, rents, fees or other payments are known to be required to be paid 
on mine production or exploration rights. 

Environmental Considerations 
An Annual Environmental Audit Report is required to be submitted every year to the 
Ecuadorean government which must be approved before future exploration in 
subsequent years can proceed.  This report shows the environmental impact of the 
exploration work and any remedial work that has been taken to remediate any 
damage that has occurred.  

The 2011 Annual Environmental Audit Report has been submitted.  

Laboratory results from August, 2008 indicate the existence of heavy metals and 
minerals such as lead and cyanide in all streams sampled, with concentrations that

exceed the allowable limit. The burden of solids in the water is a result of artisanal 
'informal mining' in the upper part of the concessions. 

ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY  

 

Location and Access 
The Condor Gold Project is located within the Zamora province of in the Loja region 
of southern Ecuador  

The Loja region is serviced by air (Catamayo airport) via a new international airport 
called "Santa Rosa", which is located south of Machala city and around six hours 
drive from the Condor Gold Project.  Military airports are located at Zamora and 
Gualaquiza. 

Access is along paved highways except for the last 10km, which is a dirt road 
through the town of La Punta via the regional centre of Zamora (pop. approximately 
6,000). 

Depending on road conditions, travel time from Loja airport to the property is 
between 3 and 4 hours.  Loja to Zamora is approximately 50km, and  Zamora to the 
property is 73 m. 

The in-property and surrounding area can be accessed by 4-wheel drive vehicles, 
through a number of variably maintained dirt roads. These dirt roads are subject to 
seasonal modification by slope instability and rainfall, which may prevent access and 
egress from time to time.

Climate  
The climate at the Condor Gold Project is typical for areas situated at this elevation 
along the Amazonian side of the Andes. Daily temperatures range between 18oC and 
29o C, and average 220 C. Rainfall is on the order of 2 to 4 meters/year with 
maximum rainfalls occurring between February and April. However, heavy rainfalls 
can occur at any time of the year. The humidity averages 79% year round. Fog and 
cloud cover is typical during the rainy season. Except for disruptions that may occur 
as a result of unusually heavy rainfall, the Condor Gold Project property can be 
operated year round. 

Topography, Elevation and Vegetation  
The Condor Gold Project is located in the Amazon Region of southwestern Ecuador, 
and is located on the western flanks of Cordillera del Condor, the crest of which 
defines the Ecuador-Peru border. Elevations within the project area range from 
1,000m above sea level in the Santa Barbara sector up to 1,900m elsewhere with an 
average of 1,500m. The topography is very rugged and slopes are steep (290 

average slope). The mountains are covered with typical tropical rain forests and 
dense vegetation. 

Local Resources and Physiography  
The largest regional centre close to the property is Loja, with a population of over 
100,000.  Loja is an education centre and provides unskilled to skilled labour and 
basic equipment supplies. Zamora also provides unskilled and skilled labour with 
additional labour sourced from the towns of Puerto Minero, Chinapintza and 
Paquisha Canton. 

Potable water is brought to the camp site via pipes from springs and collected in rain 
water tanks. There is sufficient available water for current operations on and around 
the Condor Gold Project area.  The main camp, 'Mirador', can accommodate over 60 
personnel.  Electricity to the camp is provide by a government installed 22KV line to 
the nearby town of Chinapintza, via a transformer with 2 lines into the camp. These 
power lines are currently being upgraded by the authorities to three phase power.  
The permits obtained for the Condor Gold Project provide surface rights 
corresponding to the exploration on the property. 

HISTORY  
Modern exploration has occurred within the concession areas since 1988.  This 
exploration work has continued through to the present, however a moratorium which 
froze all new exploration activities was imposed by the Ecuadorian government 
between April 15, 2008 and January 12, 2009.  This moratorium was enacted to 
allow a revision of the country's mining laws to bring these laws more in line with 
other market economy countries.  The moratorium was lifted on January 12, 2009 
and a permit to drill within the concessions has been granted effective July 1, 2011.

During the moratorium, the concession owners at the time, Golmarca/Ecometals, 
were restricted to data compilation and processing data collected to date, re-logging 
existing core and generating new geological models to be used in future exploration 
programs along with limited surface mapping and geochemical sampling. 

A summary of exploration work completed between 1993 and the present by the 
various concession owners is provided below. 

TVX Gold and others 
According to MEM (2000), gold was discovered within and about the property now 
held by Condormining in 1984 by prospectors and "informal" miners in what became 
known as the Pachicutza Mining Camp. Goldmarca (2004) indicates that the 
presence of gold in the area was known since pre-Columbian time. 

From 1988 to 1991, Pachicutza CEM, an association of companies including DINE, 
in which Prominex U.K had a majority interest (65%), initiated formal exploration 
within and about the property covering some 25,000 hectares (Ronning, 2003). This 
work included regional mapping, geological reconnaissance and geochemical stream 
sediment sampling. MEM (2000) states that the bulk of the currently known prospects 
and deposits (gold - polymetallic veins and porphyry breccias) were first discovered 
at this time. 

In 1991, Prominex U.K. withdrew from the project and TVX, under the name of 
Condor Mining, acquired the property previously held by Pachicutza CEM with DINE 
and the Chulapas Mining Company as partners. TVX conducted detailed surface and 
underground geological studies of a number of "mining parcels" which it bought from 
informal miners in the Chinapintza area. 

In December, 2002 Goldmarca entered into a joint venture agreement with DINE to 
acquire the properties which now constitute the Condor Gold Project, and in 2003 
initiated activities which are described in Section 10 (Exploration). 

TVX Gold Exploration 1993 to 1999 
During the period 1993-1999, TVX constructed drill access roads and completed 
51,439.6 meters of diamond drilling (in 230 holes) to test the vein systems and 
breccias at depth in the Chinapintza deposit. Exploration was put on hold during the 
short border war (1995) between Peru and Ecuador. TVX Gold completed 6,000 
meters of trenching across the various mineralised breccia pipes and areas which 
had been discovered by the earlier rock chip and soil geochemical sampling. TVX 
Gold also completed 10.2 line-km of geophysics, took 1,200 geochemical soil 
samples on 3,000m of grid, assayed 23,539 drill core samples, and took 2,800 
underground samples and 3,636 rock chip samples (Ronning, 2003, Goldmarca, 
2002). 

These areas included the following sectors: La Pangui, Reina del Cisne, Los Cuyes, 
San Jose 1 and 2, Soledad, Bonanza, Guayas, Enma, Conguime and Santa Barbara. 
Access within the property required the preparation of approximately 26km of hand 
constructed roads and approximately 53km of trails.

TVX used a variety of electronic surveying equipment for its surface and 
underground work, which included the Electronic Total Station GTS 13, TOPCON, 
Electronic Total Station Sokkia SET-6 and the Electronic Total Station Sokkia SET-
3E each of which have accuracies of down to 1.0mm. This equipment was used to 
create a series of triangulation stations from which second and third order points 
were established so that the property could be topographically surveyed and the 
locations of all of the trenches, drill holes, roads, etc. could be accurately located with 
X, Y and Z coordinates.  

In a first stage of tunnelling at Chinapintza, TVX extended an existing working by 200 
meters. In a second stage, TVX drove a 734m access tunnel at the 1535 ft level of 
the Chinapintza Veins and approximately another 487m in drifts and cross cuts; 
394m of the tunnel is contained within the Viche Conguime 1 Concession, and the 
balance (340m) entered into the Jerusalén concession (Ronning, 2003), which is not 
part of the Condor Gold Project property. The access opening of the adit is on the 
Viche Conguime 1 Concession. Third party access to this adit requires Condormining 
approval. TVX stockpiled several hundred tonnes of material at this time. 

TVX completed its resource calculations and feasibility studies for Chinapintza and 
the other areas tested and concluded that the production potential that it required had 
not been defined. However, TVX did conclude that potential to produce at a rate of 
200-400 tonnes per day of material could be feasible at Chinapintza (MEM, 2000). 

In early 1998, due to the prevailing corporate situation TVX, withdrew from the 
project to develop Chinapintza; however, it continued to conduct exploration for 
porphyry copper potential elsewhere in the area and within what is now the southern 
extent of the Condor Gold Project property in the El Hito and Santa Barbara sectors. 

Between 1994 and 1998, TVX covered the El Hito and Santa Barbara areas with a 
north-east trending soil sampling grid of dimensions 250m x 50m. In 1997 and 1998, 
additional work consisted of stream silt-sediment sampling and heavy mineral 
panned concentrate sampling along the rivers and creeks draining the area, outcrop 
sampling and channel sampling of altered/mineralised outcrops. TVX Gold also 
established two detailed (50m x 50m) geochemical grids over areas of 1,000m x 
1,500m in the Santa Barbara Norte and Sur areas, respectively. Exploration in the 
Santa Barbara Sector consisted of IP (29,250m over 14 lines), trenching (5,100m; 
514 of 3m chip channel samples) rock chip and soil geochemical sampling, mapping 
and drilling (17 holes 4,296m). The IP defined 2 positive chargeability and resistivity 
anomalies that were tested by drilling. 

Nine diamond drill holes were drilled in the north-east sector to test the coincident 
geochemical/IP anomalies for the indicated gold-copper potential. Two holes 
intersected significant widths of gold mineralization -104m (45 to 149m) grading 0.73 
g/t Au and 44m (0 to 44m) grading 1.32 g/t Au.  

Eight diamond drill holes were drilled in the south-west sector to test the coincident 
geochemical/IP anomalies for the indicated gold-copper potential. Four holes 
intersected significant intervals of gold mineralization -104m (0 to 104m) grading 
1.3g/t Au; 84m (140 to 224 m) grading 0.7g/t Au, 42.3m (224 to 266.31m) grading

Au; and, 228m (16 to 244m) grading 1.01 g/t Au. 

Exploration in the El Hito areas consisted of IP (2 by 1,000m lines), rock chip and soil 
geochemical sampling, 4,000m of trenching, mapping and sampling, BLEG sampling 
and drilling. The IP resulted in positive chargeability and resistivity anomalies that 
were tested by drilling. Four diamond drill holes (1,188m) were drilled at El Hito to 
test for the indicated porphyry copper potential. The average copper grades 
intersected in the four holes ranged from 0.21% to 0.32% total copper. 

In 2000, TVX Gold abandoned all exploration within the El Hito and Santa Barbara 
portions of the property citing inadequate potential to meet their corporate objectives. 
The author understands that no other exploration/development work has been 
performed at the property prior to the arrival of Goldmarca. 

Goldmarca/Ecometals (2003 to 2008) 

Geological Mapping & Sampling 
Three mapping stages were carried out on the Condor Sector: 

First Stage: (2003-2005): reconnaissance mapping of the project area to identify the 
geological character of specific targets, specifically Los Cuyes, San Jose, Guaya and 
Enma. 

In this process the main lithological units were defined, but the alteration and 
mineralization was not considered.

The geology of the Santa Barbara Sector was regionally mapped from 2008-2009 in 
parallel with the geochemical sampling covering both the El Hito and Santa Barbara 
prospects.

Geophysical Surveys 

In 2006, magnetic and IP surveys were carried out by Geofisica Consultores S.A.C of 
Peru over the majority of the concession.  A total of 53.7 line-km of magnetic surveys 
were completed over a 2.5 km x 2.5 km grid, covering all of the targets including the 
Condor Sector.  

An initial Pole-Dipole at 100 m IP survey program using an ELRECPROIS IP with a 
3.6 KW transmitter covered 34.1 km.  The line length varied between 1.4 to 3.4km 
with an average of 2km at a separation of 200 m.  A number of lines at 100 metre 
spacing were also run.   

By 2007, an additional 16.85 line km of IP and magnetometer surveys was 
completed. Overall results are shown, Figures 10 to 17. 

There may have been distortion or compromising of data for IP on some lines as 
there are believed to be NW lineaments parallel to the NW trending survey lines. 

A central magnetic high covers the Reina Del Cisne prospect area that was 
previously tested by three TVX holes that intersected pyrrhotite and concentrations of

semi-massive sulphides that assayed anomalous zinc, silver and gold. The 
mineralization is associated with a skarn. 

Small sub-circular bodies are also interpreted to represent a breccia body at San 
Jose and Enma, possibly a quartz-feldspar porphyry.

Correlation with available geology indicates large areas of the concession or be 
underlain by either mafic-intermediate volcanic rocks or relatively high magnetic 
intermediate intrusions.  Individual breccias and diatreme complexes are not outlined. 

There is a weak correlation between breccias and chargeability in the IP, see Figure 
13 below. If this observation is correct, additional targets may be located south-east 
of Bonanza and south of Enma. Resistivity suggests broad-intrusive bodies 
underlying much of the concession.

Santa Barbara 
Three magnetic surveys have been conducted over the Santa Barbara grid: TVX 
(1999), Goldmarca (2006) and Ecometals (2008).  The Goldmarca survey 
repeated and expanded the smaller TVX grid area. The detailed survey by 
Ecometals was interrupted by the exploration moratorium, and along with 
logistical problems, limited the area covered. 

 
There does not appear to be any correlation between the magnetic response and 
the western mineralised zone (cf. Analytic Signal).

Exploration Drilling  
No drilling has been completed on the project since the exploration moratorium was 
proclaimed in April 2008.  After the moratorium was lifted in January 2009, the project 
remained effectively dormant through 2012, pending the sale of Condormining. 

The metres drilled during 2002 to 2008 are summarised below.

Table 7: Drilling metres for Condor during Goldmarca/Ecometals (2002‐2008). 

Mid-2004 and previous drilling focussed on Los Cuyes, San Jose I, Soledad and San 
Jose II with exploratory holes targeting Guayas, Bonanza, and Buena Esperanza.  
Additional drilling was also carried out on the Chinapintza veins extending to the 
south-east towards and at Reina del Cisne.   

Post-2004 drilling concentrated on upgrading a resource at Los Cuyes, exploratory 
drilling at Luna, for extensions to Chinapintza veining and the postulated intersection 
of Chinapintza with the buried brecciated margins of the Los Cuyes diatreme, drilling 
on the Enma and the east adjacent Brechas Negras, drilling off of San Jose I and II, 
and testing Guayas and Bonanza including targeting continuity of mineralization 
between the latter two prospects.   

The Los Cuyes holes were drilled in excess of 300 metres to test deeper extensions 
to known mineralization and to tighten up the resources.  The majority of the holes 
were along east-northeast to north-east azimuth to test for parallel structures at 
breccia contacts. 

The deepest drilling indicates a possible new gold zone below 250 metres, possibly 
to a depth of 400 metres. Ecometals had planned additional holes to test this feature 
near the contact with the basement, which is now known to be brecciated.

Luna and Reina del Cisne drilling was purely exploratory, testing weak geophysical 
responses under arguably thick effusive volcanic cover that would overlie extensions 
to either the Chinapintza veining, and/or extensions to the Los Cuyes complex. 

Enma and Brechas Negras drilling was oriented north-east and south-west to test for 
vein-style and breccia margin mineralization along a postulated east-west altered 
intrusive contact. 

Past drilling on Soledad indicates a narrow steeply dipping and plunging mineralised 
feature.  However, drilling deeper than 200 metres to the south and south-east 
indicated that the 'new' mineralization could be the extensions of Enma prospect 
mineralization.  Holes deeper than 300 metres oriented east-west were drilled to test 
for continuity.  The results obtained from this drilling suggest the new mineralization 
warrants additional drilling. 

Drilling on San Jose I is considered reasonably complete, with no new significant 
mineralization intersected.  Guayas, because of the new deeper mineralization, 
requires additional drilling, particularly in the north-west and west. 

A review of drill collar locations indicates the vast majority are marked with concrete 
pad, with an unknown number still with casing intact and capped. All the 2004-2008 
drill holes were surveyed down-hole with the 2007-2008 surveyed down hole using 
FLEXIT.  All the holes were drilled with HQ-NQ diameter rods.

The Condor Gold Project was basically dormant in 2010-12 due to the then proposed 
and pending sale of Condormining. 

GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

Regional Geology  
The Condor Gold Project property is located within the Condor Real Cordillera, 
between the Andean Cordillera in the west and the Pre-Cambrian Amazon Craton. It 
forms part of a significant Jurassic-Cretaceous back-arc fold-thrust belt with Jurassic 
granitoid plutons and younger supracrustal sequences. 

The region hosts several areas of significant mineralization, notably the Corriente 
Mirador copper deposit, the Aurelian Resources, Fruta del Norte gold deposit, and 
the Nambija gold skarn district. A stratigraphic column is provided below:

The region is strongly structurally controlled by transecting north-northeast to north-
south trending lineaments with cross-cutting by younger, north-east and north-west 
sets. Jurassic magmatism and volcanism was partly controlled by the former regional 
lineaments which remain active.  A significant portion of the region is underlain by the 
152-157 Ma I-type, Zamora Batholith. 

Mineralization is in part controlled by younger structural features, typically internal, 
second order brittle systems within large more north-south trending thrust sequences 
or rifts.

the Condor Gold Project property is underlain by the intrusive-volcanic rocks of the

Chinapintza and Chapiza formations, and is bounded on the west principally by the 
granodioritic rocks of the Zamora Batholith. Amphibolite schists (metamorphosed 
Misahualli Fm volcanics) are found bounding dacite porphyry to the northwest of the 
principal area of mineralization and are extensively found to the southeast of the 
Enma zone. The principal mineralization controlling structures in this area generally 
trend north-westerly. 

The Santa Barbara - El Hito (henceforth referred to as the Santa Barbara Sector) 
area which is located approximately 7.5km to the south of the Condor Sector, is 
underlain by the gently dipping, continental and volcaniclastic sediments (comprising 
coarse, ferruginous (redbed) sandstones with intercalated conglomerates, tuffs, 
agglomerates, etc) of the Chapiza Fm., which are overlain by the andesites and 
basalts (locally with pillows) of the Misahualli Fm. The Chapiza Fm. (MEM, 2000) 
partially overlies, and in part comprises the lateral facies equivalent of the calcareous 
turbidites of the Santiago Fm. (Lower Jurassic). The sedimentary/volcanic sequence 
has been intruded by the rocks of the Zamora Batholith. The bulk of the exposed 
rocks at Santa Barbara comprise the andesitic/basaltic volcanics of the Misahualli 
Fm. which have been intruded by a NNW trending swarm of felsic porphyry dikes and 
stocks which may be of Tertiary age. 

The Northern Sector is separated from the Santa Barbara area by rocks of the 
Zamora Batholith. 

Condor Sector 
The property is underlain by a suite of felsic-intermediate intrusive rocks comprising 
likely Jurassic to Cretaceous age granodiorite to quartz diorite, and Chinapintza and 
Chapiza Fm. rhyodacite to dacite plugs, dykes and associated sub-ordinate volcanic 
rocks. 

There are small exposures of older, possibly Misahualli Fm. andesitic rocks that flank 
Chinapintza stocks and plugs. 

According to Williams (2008), "The mapped dacitic, rhyodacitic and rhyolitic 
lithologies in the Condor Sector from Los Cuyes in the North west to Enma and 
Brechas Negras in the south east; from La Pangui in the north east to Guayas in the 
south west, has previously been interpreted as part of a 1500 meter diameter 
diatreme complex with mineralization related to and centred on rhyolite - rhyodacite 
plugs and associated hydrothermal breccia bodies localized around its steep margin 
(Morrison 2007)". 

Underlying rocks in the concession area are predominantly Cretaceous rhyodacite to 
dacite intrusions and effusive rocks, Zamora Batholith, with minor Cretaceous 
volcanogenic sediment and sedimentary cover.  A number of diatreme bodies and 
brecciated systems associated with intrusions and/or diatreme bodies are known on 
and around the concession, specifically Enma, San Jose I and II, Soledad, Bonanza, 
Guayas, Buena Esperanza, Brechas Negras, Los Cuyes, La Pangui and Reina del 
Cisne plugs.

The Chinapintza vein is a significant gold mineralised quartz vein system and 
remains a significant gold target. 

Los Cuyes represents a complex intrusive phreatomagmatic breccia with associated 
hydrothermal alteration within magmatic and effusive volcanic lithologies. 

The Soledad complex comprises several occurrences, specifically Soledad itself, 
Guaya plus San Jose (I and II) and Bonanza, with all hosted by the granodioritic to 
quartz dioritic intrusion. 

The Soledad and Guayas mineralization is typically replacement veining and 
disseminated; San Jose (I and II), and Bonanza are usually ascribed a hydrothermal 
breccia style, associated with an intrusive breccia system. 

Therefore all share similar features, specifically mineralised, brecciaed margins 
associated with brecciaed and hydrothermally altered felsic-intermediate intrusions. 

Lithology 
Based on the lithologies exposed in the area and in drill core, this system is hosted 
by volcanic units that are proximal to one or more eruptive vents. There are also 
multiple intrusive bodies of stocks and dikes, as well as breccias of phreatomagmatic 
and hydrothermal origin. The volcanic material includes lapilli and coarser breccia 
deposits with pumice, accretionary lapilli, and fragments of fresh and altered rock 
from numerous sources.

Figure 19: Geological map of Condor Sector. (2004, Goldmarca Limited.) 

Tuff beds are common, from fine ash with fine laminations to more coarse bedding 
and large fragments. The laminated tuffs are commonly tilted to angles greater than 
the original bedding (Photo 1), indicating post-depositional tilting, either due to 
slumping or listric faulting into a crater, or locally by deformation due to adjacent 
shallow intrusion. Post-mineral faulting, which is common in the area but occurred 
mainly with strike-slip displacement, may also cause some tilting. Accretional lapilli 
are common in some horizons, due to wet conditions, and blocks of accretionary 
lapilli tuff broken up and hosted by lapilli tuff with primary accretions (Photo 2) 
indicate that slumping of beds into a crater occurred. Further evidence for such 
slumping is present in Los Cuyes, where beds are nearly vertical (Photo 3), and 
pumice tuffs are also common. Coarse volcanic breccias have also been deposited 
south of Reina del Cisne and at Taricori (Photo 4-5). 

In addition to the depositional breccias, there are also intrusive breccias with a soft, 
dark matrix (Figure 5) at Enma, Los Cuyes, and Taricori; at Enma they are called

Brechas Negras, and are spatially associated with high gold grades in structures and 
related breccias.  

These dark-matrix breccias contain fresh and altered wall rock, including black 
sedimentary fragments, apparently of a shale composition (Photo 7). Fine 
comminution of such shale likely provides the dark, muddy matrix that may have 
been squeezed up along structures (Photo 9) due to compaction resulting from 
eruption and loading of volcanic material, or as the result of intrusion of molten 
material, as evidenced by fine textures of fragments (Photo 8). In addition to the 
depositional, hydrothermal, and sedimentary diapiric breccias, there is also evidence 
in drill core as well as the surface for phreatomagmatic breccias.  

Fragment textures in Los Cuyes as deep as 400 m in drill core (Photo 12), as well as 
at the surface near Mirador camp (Photo 13), indicate juvenile characteristics of 
magma intruded into aqueous saturated rock with subsequent brecciation. In 
addition, there is evidence for sub-surface accretionary textures, as also observed at 
the Kelian volcanic complex (Davies et al., 1999, PacRim Proceedings).

The volcanic units described here, as well as the various breccias, are consistent 
with a setting proximal to eruptive vents. These include the bedded tuffs, ranging 
from ash to lapilli (with pumice and/or accretionary fragments) to coarse fragmental 
volcanic breccias, commonly with fragments of fresh to altered wall rock and 
magmatic material, the latter indicating phreatomagmatic activity that contributed to 
brecciation and formation of permeable conduits. 

Mapping such deposits and breccias will help to identify the location of such eruptive 
vents, and thus the focus of possible hydrothermal palaeo-fluid flow.

Mineralization 
Previous workers have considered various geological and mineralization 
relationships or zones: 

• Fault-controlled mineralised veining within the basement rocks, primarily 
intermediate porphyry (e.g. Chinapintza and El Tambo). 

• Breccia infill, veining (stockwork or sheet-type), at intrusion margins (e.g. 
Enma and San Jose). 

• Hydrothermal alteration-related mineralization, including replacement and 
vein-type, within or at diatreme margins (e.g. Los Cuyes). 

• Stockwork mineralization within later intrusive bodies (e.g. Soledad and 
Guayas). 

The Au and Ag contents are apparently directly related to sulphide content. Recent 
metallurgical tests suggest different Au phases and with it remobilized gold.  Assays 
suggest a broad correlation between gold and zinc values, especially in higher 
grades and in feldspar porphyries. 

Mineralization spatially related to diverse breccias occurs over a 2.2 by 2.5 km area 
Morrison (2007), states there is a broad sulphide envelope within which is "an 
upward and outward zoning from pyrrhotite pyrite chalcopyrite sphalerite  
galena" 

This zoning is understood to be on the order of 500 metres vertically. Deeper 
mineralization may be relatively chalcopyrite +/- sphalerite rich. Gold mineralization is 
typically associated with pyrite-sphalerite +/- galena and Mn carbonate, but there 
appear to be no direct correlation with overall sulphide content. Some of the gold 
appears to be a re-crystallization feature. 

Alteration is from out  in, propylitic (chlorite), with increasing sericite.  Shallow level 
alteration may be kaolinite-argillic alteration. Silicification is typical for many of the 
mineralised breccias. There are high-°T assemblages including alunite+/-
rhodochrosite or rhodonite.   

Alteration 
There is no systematic mapping of alteration assemblages. Propylitic alteration is 
widespread but generally weak.  The extent of carbonate alteration is weak and 
erratic, though it may be slightly stronger in zones with higher quartz vein density. 

Argillic alteration is typically seen at contacts between different intrusive lithotypes, 
including phreatomagmatic breccias. Kaolinite - alunite alteration is noted, particularly 
at the margins of breccia complexes.  Williams (2008), suggests this 'acid-leaching' 
pre-dates mineralization, and acted as preparation for sulphide ingress and 
deposition. Vug, vein or banded silica alteration has been observed by many workers 
at Condor, including the author. 

A more pervasive sericite-silica-pyrite-(carbonate alteration) is associated with 
quartz-adularia or quartz-alunite alteration, the latter typically within or adjacent to, 
the more strongly brecciated units. Kaolin may overprint the abovementioned

alteration.  One may also see variably dipping large scale zones of argillic alteration 
adjacent to silicified, magmatic or phreatomagmatic, high level breccias. 

Zones with higher silica content do not necessarily correlate with higher gold content 
or stronger, argillic alteration.  Sulphide mineralization appears in two-phases, with 
re-distribution and precipitation (replacement) noted in several intersections 
(personal observations). 

Structural Geology 
The structural geology of the mineralization is characterized by: 

• Through going, regional North-South trending, party re-activated, fold-thrust 
related systems with arcuate, low amplitude sigmoidal, often north-east to east – 
north-east trending second order faults.  This geometry is likely three-
dimensional, resulting in the formation of curvilinear blocks in all three planes. A 
north-west trending set, including the Chinapintza veining appears to be slightly 
older, based on offset by north-south trending graben (fold-thrust belt). An 
alternate explanation is re-activation of the north-east trending faults. 

• Poorly understood, with lack of exposure severely hampering attempts to resolve 
the probable association between the mineralogically important sub-linear 
Chinapintza Trend (N-S to NW-SE), a less well defined NE-SW set of low 
amplitude sinusoidal anastomosing brittle to semi-brittle faults seen in section in 
exposures as ramp features, from sub-horizontal to near vertical (thus the same 
geometry in plan). 

These phenomena would likely overprint an earlier north-south trending graven 
sequence. 

The geometry of the major rhyodacite intrusions in the area are at least partly 
controlled by the north-east trending faults.  Displacement measurements are difficult 
to calculate due to lack of exposure and lithological homogeneity.  Textural and 
mineralogical observations have been used to determine relative erosion levels and 
inter-fault block relationships.  For example, Williams (2008) suggests the Soledad 
complex and the South portion of the overall diatreme complex, from Enma East to 
Brechas Negras, are lower relative to the area around Los Cuyes, La Pangui, Reina 
del Cisne and Luna (by faulting and/or tilting). 

DEPOSIT TYPES  

Four types of mineral systems are considered to exist at the Condor Project:  
• Low sulphidation epithermal gold bearing diatremes, volcaniclastics and 

breccia pipes  
• Polymetallic (Au,Ag,Pb,Zn) mesothermal veins 
• Structurally controlled high grade epithermal gold veins 
• Gold, copper/gold and copper/molybdenum porphyry systems.

In the north of the project area, the mineralization is mostly low sulfidation breccia 
pipes with porphyry potential as well as the numerous narrow fault-veins at 
Chinapintza. 
 
The Santa Barbara Sector is host to both classic Cu-Au porphyry mineralization and 
structurally controlled higher grade Au.  El Hito is a large Cu-Mo porphyry system.  
 
These deposit styles are typical of regions subjected to high levels of tectonism 
caused when crustal plates collide forming mountain ranges such as the Andes.   

The intense pressures produced at depth provide a mechanism for crustal melting 
and especially intense heating at extreme pressures of ground waters that dissolve 
the ore forming minerals from the surrounding rocks as they are forced towards the 
crustal surface.  As the extremely hot, high pressure waters ascend towards 
shallower crustal levels they become subjected to lower hydrostatic pressures 
allowing the high pressure fluids to crack the surrounding rocks by hydrofracturing 
forming breccia pipes, diatremes, vents and stockwork zones.   

The brecciated or broken zones and surrounding rocks are then subject to varying 
degrees of chemical alteration and deposition of ore minerals upon contact with the 
cooling and depressurised mineralised fluids.  The intensity and mineralogy of the 
alteration and ore mineral deposition depends on the pressure, temperature and 
mineral content of the intruding fluids resulting in typical vertical and horizontal 
zoning (see Figures 20 and 21). These figures are schematic with no implications for 
scale and overall dimensions.  

Epithermal diatremes and breccia pipes can vary considerably in their dimensions 
and grade but have the potential to be generally compact and contain high grade 
portions, although large low grade breccia zones also have economic potential.  
Exploring for this deposit type usually requires precisely targeted drilling at closely 
spaced intervals.  Detailed surface geological mapping, geophysics and geochemical 
sampling is usually carried out prior to the drilling to assist with targeting the drill 
holes. 

Mesothermal and epithermal veins can also vary considerably in dimensions and 
grade but generally the exploration target is long, thin high grade mineralisation or 
broader zones containing swarms of veins and stockworks.  Exploring for this deposit 
type also usually requires precisely targeted drilling at closely spaced intervals.  
Detailed surface geological mapping, geophysics and geochemical sampling are also 
usually carried out prior to the drilling to assist with targeting the drill holes. 

Porphyry is a variety of igneous rock forming at or close to the surface, where cooling 
of the molten rock is rapid, that consists of large-grained crystals called phenocrysts 
such as feldspar or quartz that are dispersed within a fine-grained felspathic matrix or 
groundmass.  In certain geological environments these porphyries can include 
disseminated sulphide mineralisation containing ore forming minerals such as gold 
and copper.  Since the grade of this type of deposit is generally low, exploring for 
porphyry style deposits requires initial surface geological mapping, geophysics and 
geochemical sampling at a much broader scale than the more compact and higher

The proposed exploration program at the Condor Gold Project is based on these 
models.  In areas so far untested by drilling, the earlier surface mapping, geophysics 
and geochemical sampling has outlined structures and areas with promising 
alteration types and often anomalous ore bearing minerals.  This work will be 
followed up with drilling to take representative samples across these features both 
along strike and at depth.  At Chinapintza, Soledad, Enma, Los Cuyes and Santa 
Barbara, there is already sufficient drilling to estimate resources so the proposed 
drilling at these areas will be aimed to extend these resources along strike and at 
depth. 

Condor Sector 
In the approximately 1,500m diameter breccia complex there are several different 
targets centred on Los Cuyes. The complex comprises a poorly differentiated suite of 
dacite to rhyodacite or simply quartz porphyritic lithotypes that have been modified by 
structural, phreatomagmatic and igneous breccias.

Hydrothermal alteration components remain poorly defined, but generally occur at 
the margins of the complex in association with later rhyolite plugs.  There could be 
higher intensity breccias near surface, changing to more pervasive strong silica 
alteration at depth. Partially capping these are genetically related pyroclastic rocks 
and associated volcanogenic sediments. 

The breccia and basement rocks are cut by several generally north-easterly trending, 
arcuate possibly sinusoidal fracture systems. These could be related to more 
regional thrusting, forming as second or third order features. 

Los Cuyes 
The overall dimensions of the Los Cuyes portion of the large breccia complex are 
approximately 400m east-west by 250m north-south.  Most of the mineralization and 
alteration occurs within hydrothermal breccias above and flanking the diatreme 
complex.  The breccia is south-dipping and pipe-like, with several internal 
mineralised zones as follows:  

• An upper zone, dipping steeply southwards from the surface to 150m  

• Another towards Piedras Blancas, roughly parallel to topography 

• A deeper more cylindrical breccia target below 200 metres (approximately 
200m by 100-150m), and 

• A central zone, which was intersected by Ecometals in several drill holes 
along sections 000 to 050NE (e.g., DDH DC-47 has 68m @ 1.0g/t Au from 
188m downhole depth and DC-01 has 47m @ 3.13 g /t Au from 223m 
downhole depth). 

Alteration is threefold: 

1. Propylitic, typically chlorite-quartz-sericite +/- carbonate; 
2. Sericite-silica-pyrite-carbonate pervasive or vein-type silica, plus silicified 

fragments and cement; and 
3. Silica-alunite-kaolinite.  Kaolinite tends to be a late replacement feature. 

Mineralization is pyrrhotite → pyrite → chalcopyrite → sphalerite → galena.  Gold 
may occur in higher proportions with sphalerite, galena +/- manganese. 

Fine free gold grains have been noted in core. Mineral relationships reported by 
Morrison (2007) include good correlation between lead and copper rather than with 
lead-zinc, although there are some high grade zinc intersections corresponding with 
higher gold grades. 

TVX focussed much of its effort on diamond drilling the Los Cuyes mineralization 
target.  Early results from that drilling indicated mineralised widths from 20m to 80m 
(true), to depths of 300m vertical. Notable drill intersections include DC-47 returning 
44 m @ 1.26 g Au/t and 9 m @ 1.98 g Au/t and drill hole DC-39 returning 12 m @ 
3.64 g Au/t and 9 m @ 12.28 g Au/t.

Geological mapping at 1:500, 1:1000 and 1:5000 scale has covered Enma, Buena 
Esperanza, Santa Barbara and Hitobo using hand-held GPS equipment. 

The Los Cuyes area was mapped in 2006-2007 although exposures are very limited 
due to the topography and vegetation cover, with nearly all data coming from road 
cuts and associated exposures.  The majority of exposures are considered to be a 
central granodiorite to quartz diorite stock flanked and partly intruded by intermediate 
porphyritic plugs and dykes and subsequently modified by phreatomagmatic breccia 
and dacite to rhyodacite intrusions.  

As of year-end, 2007, an additional 12 diamond holes for a total of 4,508.7m were 
drilled at Los Cuyes with the majority of holes designed to prove up resources.  This 
drilling returned additional gold grades in excess of 1 g/t Au, at 350 metres to almost 
500 metres vertically below surface including DCU-32, with 89 m @ 0.8 g/t Au.  
Additional testing of this mineralization was recommended, because 1 g/t Au 
modelling suggested the potential for additional mineralization to the south and 
south-east at depth. 

Soledad 
The Soledad Complex is considered as a larger hydrothermal breccia pipe system 
covering the San Jose I, II, Bonanza and Guayas targets. It is located at the northern 
margin of the main complex, at the contact between the granodiorite and feldspar 
porphyry.  Recent interpretation, based on drilling, suggests the mineralized zone is 
north-south elongate, with slight flaring towards the surface.

The vein-type and replacement mineralization within the quartz feldspar porphyry 
intrusion hosted breccia is underlain by a felsic ('rhyolite') plug with marginal intrusive 
or hydrothermal breccias.  This package is in turn hosted by granite and feldspar 
porphyry. 

The felsic porphyry contacts are generally sharp, steep, with the south-east contact 
faulted and brecciated.  North-south oriented sphalerite-rich gouge in sheet fractures 
is noted at the surface. 

Alteration is typically quartz-argillic – (sericite).  The mineralization grades from Au-
Ag+/-sphalerite near surface to more pyritic, anomalous gold mineralization at depth, 
especially below 150 metres depth.  Gold is still 'anomalous' (i.e., > 0.2 g/t below 
250m). 

Higher grades of generally more than 1.0g/t Au are reported 100 metres below 
surface within a north-east to east striking feature with dimensions 80 metres by 90 
metres by 300 metres (depth). 

Significant diamond drill holes include DS006 and DS007 which intersected 
additional gold mineralization 300 metres below the surface with DS007 intersecting 
28m @ 1.5 g/t Au and with DS006 intersecting 106m @ 0.25 g/t Au. 

Generally the gold and zinc grades drop off below 200-300 metres vertical depth and 
are replaced gradually by pyrite from 100 metres below surface. 

San Jose I 
San Jose I is a small breccia located on the north of the main Soledad-San Jose-
Guaya intrusive complex at the contact between a rhyolite plug and the basement 
granodiorite.  The mineralization is found in Au-sphalerite rich veins within the 
breccias containing fragments of basement material, rhyolite and rare effusive 
material.  The mineralization is more pyritic with fewer veins and corresponding lower 
gold grades at depth. 

San Jose II is located east of Soledad and is essentially a remnant breccia on the 
east side of a rhyolite plug.  The breccia is rhyolitic with fragments of the larger 
rhyolite plug, pyroclastic and shale material.  The grade of the mineralization appears 
to taper off north-westwards but continues down-plug to the south-east where it may 
become contiguous with the north-western margin of the Bonanza mineralization. 

Diamond drill hole DSO-21 intersected 229 metres of continuous generally sub 1.0g/t 
Au mineralization (averaging 0.8g/t Au), which, along with similar intercepts from drill 
holes DSO-19 and DSO-20, could represent a feeder zone for the adjacent Guaya 
occurrence.

Guaya 

The Guaya mineralization covers an area of approximately 50 metres by 20 metres 
by 50 metres depth, hosted by a steeply south-east plunging quartz phyric 
rhyodacite, with kaolinised alkali feldspar dominant.  The mineralization is vein-type 
consisting of pyrite+/-sphalerite and Ag-Pb, is vein-type, occurring as two main sets 
trending north-west, with north-east dips.  Fine free gold has been identified in core. 

The contacts with the porphyry basement country rock are typically steep, commonly 
faulted, brecciated and mineralised. The breccia at the contact between the 
rhyodacite and granodiorite basement is polymict with a 'shearing' component.  
Overprinting this is variable hydrothermal alteration characterised by quartz-sericite 
with sub-ordinate kaolin-carbonate. 

The stockwork vein mineralization is broader at the surface with weak sphalerite 
noted. With depth, the mineralization weakens and the breccias become coarser with 
depth, with some continuity of both, albeit only low grade anomalous gold, through to 
the adjacent Bonanza occurrence where diamond drilling returned only weak gold 
values. 

At depth, breccias predominate and are typically quite dark with variable argillic 
alteration, chlorite and sulphides. They are strongly pyritic, with variable 
rhodochrosite, calcite and minor ankerite-calcite.

Enma-Buena Esperanza 
The mineralization at Enma-Buena Esperanza is located within rhyolitic to rhyodacitic 
microbreccias with pulses of rhyolitic flows and dykes at the contact between 
pyroclastic rocks and granodiorite.  The contacts are silicified and multiple-breccias.  
The overall dimensions of the breccia are 200 metres by 10 metres with the 
brecciation continuing down for at least 350 metres. 

The alteration is mainly chlorite, with minor quartz-sericite+/-alunite/kaolinite that 
could also be associated with a quartz feldspar porphyry dyke some 10m thick. The 
alteration post-dates brecciation and continues into the tuffs and granodiorite 
suggesting a hydrothermal overprint. 

Anomalous gold mineralization (>0.1 g/t Au) extends down for approximately 200 
metres, with a transition from pyrite-sphalerite-quartz to Au barren, pyrite-
pyrrhotite+/-chalcopyrite mineralization overprinting all lithologies. 

Buena Esperanza is located 400 metres West of Enma.  The geological setting is a 
steeply dipping rhyolite dyke intruding a diatreme margin contact between 
granodiorite and pyroclastic rocks. 

A later sedimentary package covers part of the deposit and skarn mineralization 
characterised by pyrrhotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite and sphalerite associated with chlorite-
sericite-carbonate and/or epidote-chlorite-magnetite-pyrite-pyrrhotite alteration is 
located within the mineralised zone. 

Three holes, DS009, DS010 and DS088, tested a magnetic anomaly and weak 
surface mineralization.  Shallow elevated Cu and Zn grades of 1000 ppm were 
returned from these holes.

are considered as the best targets. These targets are in moderate resistivity zones 
interpreted to be associated with a rhyolite porphyry and highly conductive sulphides. 

Chinapintza - La Pangui 
Chinapintza represents a parallel suite of mineralised quartz veins outcropping on the

property to the north, and also extends into the El Tambo district across the border 
into Peru.

Silica rich veins with variable manganese carbonate often follow pre-existing faults 
that were subsequently modified to produce deformed brecciated to cataclastic or 
gouge-like mineralised material.  These veins form the target of illegal mining activity 
in the area.  TVX conducted over 45,000 metres of diamond drilling on these veins. 

This vein set extends for at least 6 km along strike within a 4-5 km wide zone. The 
Condor Gold Project area contains a portion of this system over a strike length of 
approximately 1.5 km.  It is generally considered that the Chinapintza veining is 
truncated by the La Pangui Fault, or postulated graben south of La Pangui and north 
of the Piedras Blancas Fault. 

The host rocks are commonly variable sericite-clay-chlorite altered quartz or feldspar 
porphyritic dacite of either intrusive or effusive origin.  The sulphide assemblage is 
mainly pyrite, with sphalerite and lesser amounts of galena, pyrrhotite and 
arsenopyrite.  The sulphides may be either disseminated, vein-type, replacement or 
banded and locally semi-massive.  Some open space infill has been noted.

Other Prospects: Santa Barbara and El Hito Sector 
The porphyry prospects at Santa Barbara and El Hito-Conguime are distinct from the 
Pachicutza epithermal district. At Santa Barbara, ductile quartz veins indicate a high-
temperature, and thus relatively deep environment, below the level exposed or drilled 
in the Pachicutza epithermal district.  

The principal structural control in the El Hito-Santa Barbara sector is considered to 
be a through-going north-south trending structure. The intersection with the north-
south structure and the NW-SE trending Conguime Fault (MEM, 2002) is most 
probably responsible for the localization of the El Hito mineralization.

Santa Barbara 
Santa Barbara is a gold – rich porphyry copper deposit located 4km southwest of the 
main Condor Sector. The area is underlain by andesite volcanics covered by a 
sedimentary sequence consisting of conglomerate and quartz sandstone. In the 
northwest sector of the area, the coarse-grained pre-mineral granodiorite Zamora 
Batholith occurs. 

The andesite is intruded by two distinct types of diorite porphyries. The first one is the 
'main-stage' intrusion which caused the Cu – Au mineralization. The second is a 'late 
– stage' intrusion which is hornblende rich, weakly altered, less mineralised and rich 
in carbonate veinlets and fracture filling. The second type of diorite porphyry can be 
readily distinguished from the first type by its more crowded texture. 

The copper and gold mineralization occurs mainly in the 'main-stage' diorite porphyry 
and in the volcanic rocks. The mineralization is directly related to a dense stockwork 
of quartz – chalcopyrite – pyrite veinlets and dissemination developed in the porphyry 
and volcanics.

 Biotitic Dacite Porphyry – Granodiorite:  the variation in texture is probably 
due to the effect of potassic alteration affecting the ground mass.  Biotitic 
dacite porphyry with fine ground mass is less calcified than granodiorite, but 
share the same paragenesis (quartz-K-feldspar-chalcopyrite-pyrite); and 

 
 Feldspathic porphyry with plagiclase phenocrysts (Zamora Batholith): early 

potassic alteration with overimposed phyllic alteration (chlorite-sericite-illite-
kaolinite).  There is no evidence of calcification.   

The first two porphyries intrude the Zamora Batholith and are only exposed along a

The main alteration styles at the El Hito Prospect comprise a core showing phyllic-
argillic (illite-sericite-pyrite) surrounded by a propyllitic halo.  

The mineralization at El Hito is hosted within a stockwork zone developed in 
granodiorite-quartz diorite phase of the Zamora Batholith.  Copper-molybdenite 
mineralization has been defined to date at El Hito within an area approximately 2.5 
kms long (north-south) and 1.0 km wide. The principal minerals are comprised of 
pyrite, chalcopyrite and molybdenite associated with three phases of quartz-feldspar, 
quartz-biotite, and quartz-sericite-pyrite stockworks and flooding.

EXPLORATION  

Limited general exploration and no drilling has been conducted on the property by or 
on behalf of Ecuador Capital.  In April 2008, a Constituent Assembly of Ecuador's 
legislature, formed to examine Ecuador's Constitution, and accepted a mandate to 
revise mining laws. The Government of Ecuador, through the Ministry of Mines and 
Petroleum, issued a 180 day suspension of all mining and exploration activity while 
such laws were to be revised. On January 12, 2009, Ecuador's interim legislature 
approved a new draft mining law, lifting the previously imposed exploration 
moratorium while a new law was developed. The new law calls for negotiation 
between mining companies and the Government of Ecuador with respect to project-
specific mining contracts.  

By July 2011, the geological staff of Condormining were merely preparing for a 
surface exploration program including surface geology, alteration and structural 
mapping, extensive geochemical sampling, detailed re-logging of earlier drill holes 
and revision of geology models in preparation for a 10,000m and subsequent 
37,000m drilling program.  These programs are designed to both expand and 
delineate known gold resources and define new and existing gold occurrences, both 
in outcrop and with scout drill intercepts. 

All supporting geological, geochemical and related detailed information concerning 
the Condor Gold Project is incorporated into a new centralised corporate database.

DRILLING 

Condor Drilling  
All core had been moved to a new location at the old TVX camp ground (and planned 
plant site) in a refurbished warehouse 1 km away.  Overall the storage is good and all 
boxes have been, or will be, checked for preservation and identification.  Where 
necessary, core has been re-boxed and/or re-marked.  The author visited the new 
location during his visit, prior to core being moved. 

A brief visual assessment of the previous drill core suggests that the ground 
conditions were reasonably good, though mineralised sections can be strongly 
faulted with lower core recovery.  Sampling was carried out mostly over 1 to 2 metre 
intervals, and split for assay. Post 2005, all samples were cut with a rock saw at a 
securely fenced facility at the main camp. 

Drilling on San Jose I is considered reasonably complete, with no new significant 
mineralization intersected.  Because of the new deeper mineralization, Guayas 
requires additional drilling, particularly in the north-west and west.

Collar Surveys   
A review of drill collar locations indicates the vast majority are marked with concrete 
pad, with an unknown number still with casing intact and capped.   Ecometals has 
made best efforts to locate nearly all drill holes and re-record locations with 
differential GPS.  GPS locations have been recorded using the datum PSAD 76. 

Downhole Surveying  
All 2004-2008 drill holes were surveyed down-hole (see Verification, below) with all 
2007-2008 holes surveyed down hole using a FLEXIT tool. All drilling was by 
diamond drilling methods and all holes were drilled with HQ-NQ diameter rods. 

Summary and Interpretation of Drilling Results  
For additional summary and interpretation of drilling results, see the discussion under 
"Exploration Drilling" on pages 26-28.  See also "Mineral Resource Estimates—
Drilling" for a summary of the drill holes and locations and "Deposit Types" for a 
listing of drill hole intersection widths. 

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY  
In 2005, at the request of Goldmarca, Burns (2005) carried out an informal progress 
report on the QA/QC procedures followed by the exploration staff at the time.  Upon 
investigation, he concluded that the work programs in progress were being 
conducted in accordance with the requirements as laid out in National Instrument 43-
101. 

Sampling Bias  
Core recovery over the mineralised intervals was well over 90% in most holes and 
the core was generally intact Therefore splitting the core should be straight forward 
and not liable to bias, so as to produce representative samples.  The disseminated 
style of mineralization and the general fineness of the gold particles also make 
biased sampling unlikely.

Sample Intervals 
In almost all the drilling the sample intervals were done at regular intervals down the 
hole except for eight of the holes at Chinapintza which were sampled over the logged 
ore zones only, mainly quartz veins.   

All but a few of the earliest holes at Enma, Los Cuyes and Soledad were sampled at 
one metre intervals but the later holes were sampled at 2m intervals at Enma, Los 
Cuyes and Soledad and 2.5m at San Jose 1.    For the resource estimates all the 
holes used in the estimates were composited to 2.0m to avoid the volume variance 
affect of different sample sizes. 

Sampling Methods and Approach 
Since the drilling and sampling programs are complicated and involve several drilling 
programs, the sampling QA/QC is discussed separately for Chinapintza and the other 
areas. See below. 

Chinapintza Sampling Methods 
Of the 140 holes drilled in and around the Chinapintza mineral deposit, the earliest 
eight holes were continuously sampled at one metre intervals. In subsequent holes, 
only that material logged as potentially mineralised was sampled, and consequently 
those samples are of variable lengths.  Some of the samples taken from quartz veins 
are less than 10cm wide.  The method of sampling, whether splitting or sawing, is not 
stated in the reports provided to the author. 

Other samples collected and used in the resource estimates include: 

 

Trench samples 

Samples were collected in 20 centimetre wide, 2 metre long 
channels perpendicular to the structures being sampled. The 
channels were made deep enough to reach fresh rock. 

Road cut 
samples 

Samples were collected from the walls of road cuts, using 
procedures similar to those for trench samples. 

Underground 
development 

samples 

All the underground development samples were surveyed. 
Samples were collected across the backs (roofs) of the drives, 
from 15 centimetre wide by 10 centimetre deep channels (widths 
and depths of such samples are approximate). Samples were 
differentiated according to mapped rock types, which determined 
sample lengths. Initially samples were collected at 6 metre spacing 
along the mineralised structures with infill sampling later reducing 
the sample spacing to every 3 metres in some workings.

Factors Impacting the Accuracy of Results 
No factor that would impact a fair collection of samples is apparent from the data 
available within the Chinapintza project areas. 

Controls on Sample Intervals 
The historical drilling was entirely comprised of diamond drilling of various core 
diameters and not fully recorded in the data provided to the author. The sample 
intervals in all but eight holes were determined by lithologies.  Most samples were 
taken over zones identified during logging as potentially mineralised with the main 
focus being quartz veins.  As a result, sample intervals varied considerably and can 
be less than 10cm in narrow veins. 

Sample composites and true widths 
Typically, vein widths are quoted as either drill intercepts, true widths or horizontal 
widths.  Horizontal widths were calculated from drill intersections using the dip of the 
holes and intercept angle to the sections. 

Enma, Los Cuyes, San Jose 1 and Soledad Sampling Methods 
A total of 26 holes were drilled in Enma, 59 holes in Los Cuyes, 53 holes in San Jose 
1 and 20 holes in the Soledad areas that were used in these resource estimates.  
After the initial drilling in these project areas, the resource targets were determined to 
be stockwork veining and mineralised epithermal breccias and not the discrete vein 
lodes as found at Chinapintza. Accordingly, the sampling was not controlled by the 
logged geology with the samples being instead taken at regular intervals down the 
complete hole. 

Drill Sample Composites 
Most of the earlier holes drilled in these projects were sampled at 1.0m intervals with 
some individual veins sampled separately according to the geology but the later 
holes were sampled at 2.0m intervals at Enma, Los Cuyes and Soledad and 2.5m at 
San Jose 1.  For the resource estimates all the holes were composited to 2.0m to 
avoid the volume variance affect of different sample sizes. 

Drill Core Sampling 
Drilling post-2004 returned core recoveries in excess of 90% as noted by TVX and 
reported by Easdon (2004).  Sampling was over 1m and occasionally 2m intervals.  
Core was cut with a rock saw in a separate and secured facility away from logging 
areas. 

There are gold, silver assays or ICP results for all these samples with some 90% of 
the ICP results also including copper, zinc and lead.  ICP was run for approximately 
85% of the samples analysed. 

All core from August 2007 onwards has been photographed.

Post 2004 sampling records indicate that samples were sent for assay to Acme 
Analytical Laboratory, Vancouver, via a preparation laboratory in Cuenca, south-east 
Ecuador. 

The author understands that no officers of the company were directly involved in 
sampling or handling.  Test samples taken by the author during a property visit are 
discussed below (see "Data Verification"). 

Sample collection procedures followed were acceptable. Samples were taken from 
cut core, sealed in plastic bags, tagged, and with appropriate blanks and/or 
standards, sent in bags via truck to Loja for transport to the Chemex Cuenca 
preparation facility, prior to shipment for assay to the Acme Vancouver laboratory. 

Sample bags were inspected prior to shipment. The sample bags were stored in a 
secure facility before shipping. Any damaged bags of samples received at Cuenca 
were removed from that batch and not assayed. The appropriate samples were then 
re-taken and sent to Chemex. 

Core samples were marked on the box and recorded in drill logs prior to entry into 
the database. Core boxes were generally in good condition and stored in reasonable 
conditions prior to transfer to a larger facility at the camp site, approximately 1 km 
away. 

Factors Impacting the Accuracy of Results 
No factor which would impact a fair collection of samples is apparent from the data 
available within these project areas. 

Sample Quality 
In the author's opinion, after reading the reports previously described in this 
document, that the quality of historical sampling provides a reasonable basis to 
calculate resource estimates and plan further investigations. 

Laboratory Sample Preparation and Analytical Procedures 
All sample preparation was conducted by independent laboratories. 

From late 2004, samples were sent to the Vancouver Acme laboratory with the 
samples being prepared at the Cuenca preparation facility, then shipped to 
Vancouver for chemical analysis. 

Standard Acme Preparation Codes were used: 
• AuAg30FA = Fire assay for Au and Ag using 30g charges with ICP finish 
• M150 = Zn, Cu and Pb were and are analyzed by AA 

Preparation and analysis codes for the Acme labs are: 
• Group 6 (1.0AT-AuAg-(gm/t) 
• Group 7AR (1.0gm/100ml)-(gm/t)-FA 

Acme is an accredited ISO 9001:2001 laboratory.

DATA VERIFICATION 

Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs  
Information herein was obtained largely during the property visit by the author, to the 
Condor Gold Project property site, and subsequently, during discussions with 
Ecuador Capital Corp. and Condormining personnel. 

Assays 
Verification of previous results is largely dependent on reliance upon checks by past 
companies, from TVX to Ecometals and those of the previous author in the 
Ecometals database. 

Previous checks include those by Pitard (1995), and with respect to the TVX core, by 
Easdon (2004) and AMEC in 2004.  

During the site visit, the author carried brief field examinations of the Los Cutes, 
Soleded, San Jose, Enma and La Pangui prospect areas, and took sixteen check 
samples considered to represent mineralization therein. These sites or locations with 
depths (where drill core was taken), were surveyed using standard GARMIN GPS 
equipment. The condition of trenches (see above), made re-sampling difficult and the 
majority of check samples came from intercepts from drilling. 

The samples, including 1 OREAS blank and 1 OREAS standard, were taken under 
the direct supervision of one of the authors and transported under his supervision to 
Loja, for transport to the Acme preparation facility in Cuenca (by courier). The facility 
was not inspected at this time. The samples were sent to Acme Laboratory in 
Vancouver, an accredited laboratory. 

The samples were assayed for gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc.  Samples are 
shown in Table 14. The author's samples are shown in black, original samples in red. 
The results largely show similar grades for all elements, save DSO-12 results, with 
much higher gold grade. This could be attributed to erratic, possibly visible gold in the 
sections.

From July 2007 to date, Ecometals QA/QC involved the use of OREAS standards 
and blanks.  According to Ecometals personnel, for all surface and drill sampling, the 
following procedure was carried out: 

Insertion of Blank� 6 samples � Std � 7 samples � duplicate � 6 samples � blank 

A random check of individual batches of assays indicates that this methodology was 
not strictly adhered to though the number of blanks and standards.  Approximately 1 
per 10 samples for both used different methodology, but this is considered quite 
adequate. 

OREAS blanks were used after July 2007.  Between 2004 and 2007, mine waste 
material was used for some standards, but analysis of this indicated high variability 
and these are no longer used. Duplicates were made from the pulp reject and split 
(Acme labs).  Table 15 is a summary of the OREAS and ACME Standards used from 
2004-2008.

TVX core was re-sampled by Goldmarca and also AMEC, in 2003-2004.  The full 
report by the latter was unavailable at time of writing, although efforts are being made 
to source the document. 

This re-sampling comprised 358 samples. 50 g samples were fire assayed for gold.  
Blanks, standards and duplicates were inserted "according to the Canadian norms of 
the QA/QC." (April 2004 Goldmarca Report) Unfortunately, the methodology and 
values were unavailable at time of writing. 

Commencing in the fall of 2007, Ecometals commenced work on itsr database 
validation, covering drill and trench location, down-hole surveys, assays and drill 
logs.  This data was subsequently used for Micromine 3D modelling. 

By mid-2008, Ecometals had completed a QA/QC report on the 2004-2008 sampling 
from the various drill and trenching programs.  Samples, batch numbers, and control 
samples (duplicates, blanks and standards), were classified and results analysed to 
determine variance and overall acceptability. This covered the assay results from all 
the analytical laboratories used, Acme Canada Laboratory, Acme Chile Laboratory 
and Chemex Laboratory (Canada). 

A summary of the samples, blanks and hole statistics is presented below in Table 15. 

In summary, a check on the Ecometals database and sampling protocols indicates 
the following: 

1. The ACME standards used for gold are generally high relative to the overall 
average gold results.  The author would recommend a lower gold standard, 
around 1-2 ppm Au to be used for future work. 
 

2. The ACME Blank results are considered acceptable with a 98 percentile of 
less than 0.02 ppm Au and a standard deviation of 0.12064.  For Ag, there is 
an overall standard deviation for blanks of 0.4645, for copper, 0.000236; lead, 
0.00075243, and zinc, 0.004728.  All lie within acceptable limits. 
 

3. Eight percent of the gold and silver results from 42714 samples in the 
Ecometals database were checked for mismatches.  No mismatch was found. 
 

4. During the property visit, the author compared digital results from the 
assayers, Acme and those obtained directly from the laboratories.  A check of 
10% of the assays indicated no difference in numbers between actual results 
and the Ecometals database. 
 

5. The author could not establish precise QA/QC protocols for 2004-Fall 2007 
sampling.  It is understood that laboratory standards were inserted 
approximately every 15 samples with blanks every 10-15.  It is also 
understood that some of these internal standards were mineralised or 
otherwise, taken from the Condor Gold Project property.  A check on assay 
variance by Ecometals indicated they were unsuitable and subsequently were 
no longer used.

6. From late summer, 2007, new sampling protocols and QA/QC procedures 

were implemented.  Blanks and standards were obtained from OREAS, 
Australia.  No Condor Gold Project property material was processed. 
 

7. OREAS standards are stored in the secured company warehouse.  Access is 
restricted and the geological personnel requesting material are registered.  A 
chain of custody exists to ensure any handling is monitored.  Individual 
OREAS samples are put in appropriate sample bags with sample numbers 
under the supervision of the geologist but not handled by him to ensure there 
is no tampering by such personnel. 
 

8. The 2008 QA/QC study indicates that from a population of 42 samples 
obtained from 2004-2007 trenching and drilling, standard deviations for 
coarse reject (duplicates) and for original samples is 1.584 and 1.587.  This 
was attributed to either poor mixing of the sample or improper splitting. 
 

9. Of the 671 blanks used since 2003, for gold, 64 samples (9.54%), returned 
values >0.01 ppm Au.  These Acme blanks yielded 5 samples greater than 
one standard deviation and 4 samples greater than two standard deviations. 
OREAS blanks all passed 'tests' of 1,2 and 3 standard deviations.  It was 
concluded that Acme Chile and Acme Canada laboratories did suffer from 
contamination problems at the time.  As a consequence, batch A570157 
should be considered for exclusion from the database.  Results from this 
batch are considered to be sufficiently anomalous to warrant exclusion, 
particularly as the associated standards also failed. While other batches 
contained 'high' blank gold numbers, the related samples are deemed to have 
no material impact on overall results. 
 

10. The accuracy of 2004-2007 sampling was assessed by simple statistical 
calculations on the total number of samples and related batches plus the four 
gold standards used during that time.  The findings indicate between 9 and 
16% of samples exceed a 1 standard deviation control.  As such, the 
inclusion of these gold results in any resource calculation and as 'guides' for 
future drill programs should be reviewed immediately. 
 

11. QA/QC performed on the samples using OREAS standards indicated that in 
general this data set is robust; however, the findings indicated several 
batches would warrant re-sampling on the basis of failure at 1 and 2 standard 
deviations, particularly when taking into account specific relatively high gold 
values within each subset. 

This would include batches A22792, A770375, A770308, A770282, A770349, 
A770299. A770351, A770381, A770428. 

Overall, there is a less than 5% failure rate for the total database, indicating as a 
whole, the database is fairly robust.  It is strongly recommended that re-sampling be 
carried out on samples within the abovementioned batches, plus a review of high

QA/QC protocols match or exceed industry standards.

MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING  

2008 Cyanidation Test 
Metallurgical tests on representative mineralised material from mineralised 
occurrences in the Condor Gold Project have been conducted at several times. The 
most recent tests included cyanide bottle roll Au extraction on crushed samples 
without grinding by G & T Metallurgical Services Limited in Canada who stated that: 

"The low grade samples, (less than 0.3 g/t gold) on average, leached very poorly. On 
average, 10 percent of the gold and 6 percent of the silver was extracted to solution. 

- The medium grade composites, (0.3 to 1.0 g/t gold) demonstrated a considerable 
improvement in gold and leach performance. On average, 48 and 17 percent of the 
gold and silver were extracted from the feed. 

- As the feed grade increased beyond 1 g/t, the leach performance improved to about 
58 percent gold and 20 percent silver extraction. 

- Of the variables investigated, gold feed grade had a marginal effect on leaching 
performance. Provided the samples have sufficient gold, the maximum gold 
extraction rate reached a plateau of about 60 percent. No correlations between gold 
leaching performance and sulphur feed grade were identified. 

Conventional grinding and carbon in pulp testing should also be considered as a 
means to further increase gold extraction rates, albeit at higher processing costs. 

Lime and cyanide consumptions were relatively low, averaging 0.8 and 0.5 kg/tonne, 
respectively. There was no apparent relationship between consumption and gold or 
sulphur feed content. 

Further metallurgical testing would be required to optimize extraction rates. 
Conventional grinding and carbon in pulp cyanide leach process studies should be 
considered, as grinding the feed to a smaller particle size will likely improve gold 
extraction rates." From: G & T Metallurgical Services Limited, 2008

Table 17, above, lists the samples used in the above testing.  Although the samples 
are expected to be indicative of the respective deposits, further sampling and testing 
is recommended to verify and improve representativeness. 

Gravimetric separation-Lead-Zinc selective flotation 

These tests were performed in July 2004 by Centro de Investigation Minera y 
Metalurgica (CIMM) from Santiago, Chile during the early stage of Condor Gold 
Project. Composite samples were prepared from core drill rejects from different 
polymetallic (Au,Ag,Pb,Zn) mesothermal veins at Chinapintza. Grinding size was 
reported as 80% < 150 mesh. 

The Au recovery was acceptable but not to the expected level indicating that only a 
portion of the free gold and other gold associated with pyrite was recovered in this 
stage with the finer gold still contained in the gravimetric tailings.

AC/1631618.1 

The lower Ag recovery indicates a stronger association with the sulphides and 
possibly in the finer size range which is more difficult to recover by gravimetric 
separation. 

Lead flotation was performed on the gravimetric tailings under selective conditions to 
depress the Zn sulphide and pyrite. The Pb flotation was very effective in recovering 
much of the remaining Au and Ag together with Pb representing an overall recovery 
of 90% Au, 90% Ag and 90% Pb. 

The Pb rougher concentrate was then reground and passed to a two step cleaning 
flotation circuit in order to obtain a commercially acceptable grade concentrate. 
However, in the rougher concentrate upgrade process the Au recovery was seriously 
affected and in a minor degree the Ag recovery. This was as a consequence of Au 
content pyrite depression to the cleaner tailings.  Thus, production of high grade Pb 
concentrate may be questionable. 

The samples used for the testing in July 2004 by CIMM are as follows: 

Code Zone Wet Weight (Kg) Dry Weight (Kg) Humidity 

of Origin 

AG-1 Macas Vein 58.16 53.88 7.35% 

AG-2 Chileno Vein 60.04 50.11 16.53% 

AG-3 Superpan Vein 61.40 53.49 12.88% 

AG-4 Loayza Vein  68.56 59.19 13.66% 

Table 18: Summary of core sample composites from primary mineralized veins of 
Chinapintza. 

The core sample composites used in the 2004 testing by CIMM are summarized in 
the table above, which are a good indicative representative of the primary 
mineralized polymetallic (Au,Ag,Pb,Zn) mesothermal veins at Chinapintza.  However, 
as further drilling occurs it is recommended that additional such testing is conducted 
on the further core sample deposits to improve the certainty of representativeness of 
testing on the Chinapintza ore body in general. 

Gravimetric Separation – Cyanidation  

In July 2004, a set of gravimetric separation tests was also carried out by CIMM on 
composite core samples (as summarized in Table 18, above) prepared from equal 
weights of four polymetallic (Au,Ag,Pb,Zn) mesothermal veins at Chinapintza to study 
the response of the ore to gravimetric separation followed by bottle roll cyanidation of 
the tailings.  Mineralogical studies confirmed the presence of gold associated or 
included in sulphides as well as free gold particles.  

Total recovery (gravimetric separation + cyanidation of tailings) was calculated as 
Gravimetric separation=82%, Cyanidation = 15%, for a total recovery of 97%.

As stated above, this provides some indicative representative test results for the 
deposit but further sampling and testing is also recommended to help verify and 
improve representativeness. 

Direct Cyanidation 
In May 2004, core samples of low sulphidation epithermal gold bearing diatremes, 
volcaniclastics and breccia pipes at Los Cuyes breccia (10 samples for 40kg 
composite), Los Cuyes porphyry (15 samples for 46kg composite) and San José 1 
(10 samples for 35kg composite) were tested by bottle roll direct cyanidation.

General Metallurgical Conclusions 
Based on the results presented for the different investigations and for the different 
ore types tested, the following conclusions can be drawn: 

• Selective flotation of Pb-Zn does not allow an acceptable recovery of Au and 
Ag if compared with the direct cyanidation option or the combination of 
gravimetric separation-cyanidation. This method can be only applicable to 
veins with high Pb and Zn sulphide content. 

• Gravimetric separation is confirmed to be a good alternative, at least for the 
preliminary circuit. This method is acceptable not only for high sulphur content 
ore type but also for highly altered ore type with minimum sulphur content 
such as the brecciated Los Cuyes.

Cóndor Gold Project 

 

Enterprise Capital Corp.  – NI 43-101 – June 2012 Page  73 
AC/1631618.1 

• Gravimetric separation alone has its limits and does not guarantee recoveries 
over 90% for the Au and Ag values. This method has to be complemented 
either by cyanidation or flotation of the tails. 

• Sulphide bulk flotation has demonstrated to be a good complement for 
gravimetric flotation in order to recover the Au and Ag values contained in the 
finer particle size fractions. 

• The gravimetric separation-flotation-cyanidation of concentrate option allows 
overall recovery over 90% for Au but lower recoveries for Au compared with 
the best option (direct cyanidation). The main advantage is the significant 
reduction in the requirement of cyanidation equipment and grinding 
equipment because the cyanidation will be not be applied to the total ore flow 
but only to a fraction of it. An economic trade-off study will define the most 
convenient circuit. 

• The kinetic of cyanidation curves show that in some cases recoveries over 
90% of the gold is possible only after 48 hours of cyanidation time. This is 
important for the economics of the plant design. The curves also show the 
positive effect of injection of oxygen with some ore types. 

• A regrind level of 80% <50 microns seems to be the optimum for cyanidation 
feed. Finer regrind does produce a limited beneficial effect on recovery but a 
negative effect on process costs. 

It is the conclusion of this author, that since the Condor Gold Project is at such an 
early exploration stage, samples collected for metallurgical testing to date may not be 
truly representative of the final deposits should they eventually mined. The samples 
collected for the metallurgical tests mentioned above were taken to represent the 
typical mineralisation as it is known at the time the samples were collected or to test 
a particular portion of the mineralisation (especially low grade or high grade or with a 
particular ore bearing or country rock mineralogy) in the deposit to determine 
economic and metallurgical parameters to be considered for that type of 
mineralisation. Once the deposits have been more thoroughly tested by further 
drilling, it is highly recommended that more representative samples of the whole of 
the deposits and all variations of potential ores should be collected and tested.

The diamond drill hole spacing at Chinapintza was mostly on sections 80m apart 
although there were many holes off section, as shown in Figure 29. The drilling at the 
other projects was generally much more irregularly spaced as shown in Figures 30-
33.  The rugged topography greatly influenced the collar locations and it was 
common to have several holes fanned from the same drill pad.

Bulk Density 
The gold ore at Chinapintza is quartz-vein hosted and associated with significant 
sulphide mineralization. Bulk density measurements were not reported for a great 
number of intersections in this ore so an arithmetic method of assigning a bulk

density value to each mineralised intersection was used in the resource calculations 
at Chinapintza. A global bulk-density was used for the other projects where the ore is 
more disseminated through the country rock in thin veinlets and in breccia matrix. 

Chinapintza Bulk Density 
The specific gravity (SG) of any rock depends on the mineralogy of the rock samples 
under consideration. In unweathered rocks, sulphide minerals have a much higher 
specific gravity than the main non-sulphide minerals found in the mineralised veins at 
Chinapintza.  To estimate the SG in a drill intersection, the following formula was 
used which assumes that the SG is directly related to the lead and zinc grade: 

IF(2.7+(Zn assay in ppm + Pb assay in ppm)/110000>4,4,2.7+( Zn assay in ppm + 
Pb assay in ppm)/110000).  This SG formula adds the Zn and Pb grades in ppm 
together and divides the total by 110,000 then adds the product to 2.7 (the SG of 
quartz).  If the sum exceeds 4, the SG is fixed at 4.  The average SG of the 
mineralised intersections used in the resource calculations was 3.04. 

No SG data with assays was available to the authors at the time of the calculations to 
check this correlation with the data. Assigning SG values to drill intersections in this 
manner is more logical than simply using an average value for all intersections for 
this style of mineralization, especially since the highest grade gold tends to be 
associated with higher base metal grades and overall sulphide content. 

Enma, Los Cuyes, San Jose 1 and Soledad Bulk Density 
An unknown number of drill core samples were tested by the previous operators for 
bulk density from these projects and an average value of 2.6 was obtained.  This 
value is consistent with the rock types hosting the mineralization in these deposits.   
This global bulk density was used in these deposits for tonnage estimates. 

Past Production 
Artisanal mining, both controlled and un-controlled, has occurred on the properties 
over the years with an unknown amount of ore extracted by these miners.  The total 
quantity of ore mined and gold extracted is unknown.  Most of this mining has 
occurred in the higher grade quartz veins at Chinapintza.  The resources at Enma, 
Los Cuyes, San Jose I and Soledad, the main targets for future development by 
Condormining, are believed to be relatively unaffected by this historic mining. 

The resource estimates contained within this report do not take any of the historic 
mining into account.  Also, no mining, metallurgical or economic factors were 
considered to limit, by lower cut-off grade or by depth, of any of the resource estimates. 

Chinapintza Veins Resource Modelling 
The Chinapintza project was split into two areas for resource estimates, inside the 
former Dynasty tenement and outside the former Dynasty tenement.  Figure 34 
shows the limits of the former Dynasty tenement.

Figure 34: The former Dynasty tenement is shown in yellow with the underground 
workings shown in red and showing general layout of drill holes as grey (Jones, 2011). 

The majority of the estimated tonnes at Chinapintza were based on drilling data.  
Three estimation methods were deployed using the drilling data depending on the 
veins estimated. All resource estimates based on drilling data were categorised as 
Inferred due to the wide spacing of the holes making accurate determinations of the 
continuity between intersections in adjacent holes difficult. 
 
Higher resource categories for the resource estimates were not deemed appropriate 
as the higher resource categories require more confidence in location and continuity 
than is considered possible from the data as provided by Condormining.   
 

Geological mapping, both on the surface and in underground workings, is being 
conducted. After this work is completed and has been properly compiled and 
evaluated, more confidence in the continuity between drill hole intersections would be 
expected to allow reclassification of much of the Inferred resources estimated by the 
author to be moved up to the Indicated category.   

It is considered that any interpreted mineralization within 40m of the drill intersection 
would be reclassified as Indicated Resources and that for a distance of greater than 
80m it would be classified as Inferred Resources. 

Where drill intersections were interpreted as belonging to either of the five main 
veins, Macas, Cariamanga, Loayza 1, Loayza 2 and an as yet un-named vein, the 
tonnage of the vein within the former Dynasty tenement was calculated polygonally.

This was done by: 

 
 Constructing polygons on long sections around each drill hole with the 

boundaries half way between adjacent drill intersections of the same vein to a 
maximum of 80m. The ground surface up-dip from the intersection was taken as 
the upper limit of the resource polygons if the topographic surface was within 80m 
of the surface.  If underground workings were located within 75m of the drill 
intersections they also truncated the resource polygons. 
 

 Calculating the drill hole intersection horizontal width by multiplying the 
intersection width by the cosine of the hole declination projected perpendicular to 
the sections at that depth. 

 
 Multiplying the polygon area by the calculated horizontal width, then by the 

calculated bulk density as described, to calculate the resource tonnes at the 
grade of the drill hole intersection using a 0.5g/t Au lower grade cut-off to 
determine the limits of the vein intersection. 

 
 All the polygon tonnes and grades were then compiled to calculate the total 

tonnes and tonnage weighted average grade, for all the veins. 
 

Where drill intersections were interpreted as not belonging to any of the five main 
veins within the former Dynasty tenement, a slightly different calculation method to 
calculate tonnes was used according to the following: 

 Half the distance between interpreted drill hole intersections on cross sections of 
the same vein up and down dip were measured then multiplied by 80m (the 
distance between cross sections) to give the area of the vein along a long 
section.  Where there are no interpreted mineralised intersections below the drill 
hole, a maximum projection distance of 100m was used. The ground surface up-
dip from the intersection was taken as the upper limit or any underground 
workings within 75m of the drill intersections truncated the resource polygons as 
above. 
 

 The drill hole intersection horizontal width was calculated by multiplying the 
intersection width by the cosine of the hole declination projected perpendicular to 
the cross section at that depth. 

 
 The calculated long section area was multiplied by the calculated horizontal width 

and the calculated bulk density as described earlier to provide tonnes. 
 
 All the polygon tonnes and average grades were then compiled to calculate the 

total tonnes and tonnage weighted average grades for all the veins. 
 

Outside of the former Dynasty tenement it was considered too difficult to correlate the 
numerous gold bearing veins between the drill intersections.  This lead to a third 
resource estimation method based on the drilling data: 

 The mineralization projected out to a 20m radius of each drill intersection was 
assumed to be Inferred.

 Calculating the drill hole intersection horizontal width by multiplying the 
intersection width by the cosine of the hole declination projected perpendicular to 
the sections at that depth. 

 
 The areas of the Inferred polygons were then multiplied by the calculated 

horizontal width and the calculated bulk density as described earlier to give the 
respective tonnes. 

 
 All the polygon tonnes and average grades were then compiled to calculate the 

total tonnes and tonnage weighted average grades for all the veins. 
 

Where samples were taken of underground workings, both within and outside the 
former Dynasty tenement, the resource tonnes were calculated as follows: 

 The first 25m above and below the underground workings were considered to be 
in the Measured category, the next 25m above and below out to 50m was 
considered Indicated and the next 25m above and below out to 75m was 
considered Inferred.  The ground surface up-dip from the workings was taken as 
the upper limit. 
 

 The total length of each of the workings along the strike of the vein was 
measured.  
 

 The average width of the mineralization in each working was calculated by 
averaging the width of all the mineralised samples greater than 0.5g/t Au taken 
along each drive. 

 
 The strike length was then multiplied by the average width, then 25m and then 

the calculated bulk density as described earlier to calculate tonnes for each 
resource category at the length weighted average grade of the mineralised 
samples.   

 
 All the tonnes and grades were then compiled to calculate the total tonnes and 

tonnage weighted average grades for all the underground workings. 
 

The resources calculated surrounding the underground workings took precedence 
over the drilling resources in instances in which they overlap.

Enma, Los Cuyes, San Jose 1 and Soledad Resource Modelling 
 
The mineralization at Enma, Los Cuyes, San Jose 1 and Soledad is quite different to 
that of Chinapintza as it is generally lower grade and disseminated through the country 
rock in a stockwork of quartz veinlets and in breccia matrix.  This mineralization would 
be mined in bulk from open pits and or using bulk underground mining methods.   
 
It was considered appropriate to model this mineralization using search ellipses that 
were filled but were also confined by wireframes constructed so that they delimited, or 
domained, the bulk mineralization structures.  The modelling parameters used in these 
models are shown in Tables 23-26.

All the models were constructed using search ellipses that were 'disc-like' with the 
vertical search radius distance set at 5.0m with the horizontal 4-10 times greater using 
an inverse distance cubed weighting.  These modelling parameters maintained any 
vertical grade trends and limited any excessive smoothing. 
 
The models created for each of the prospects are shown in both plan and section in

Inferred Resources in Santa Barbara Sur and Santa Barbara Norte were originally 
estimated by TVX.  These estimates, based on cross-sections and plans, were 
respectively 21 million tonnes grading 1.0 g/t Au and 5 million tonnes grading 0.9 g/t 
Au.  Easdon in his National Instrument 43-101F1 Technical Report, "The Condor 
Project, Southeastern Ecuador UTM Coordinated 9,552,000N and 770,000E" dated 
October 28, 2004 generated cross-sections for each drill hole and projected the 
mineralized intervals in each hole half the distance to the next hole.  The mineralized 
intervals were projected to a depth of 200 metres and the tonnages and grades for 
each section estimated.  A specific gravity of 2.7 was used for this resource 
estimation.  The indicated average grade was weight averaged.  Easdon concurred 
that, based on the work performed to date, an Inferred Resource of 21 million tonnes 
grading 1.0 g/t Au and 5 million tonnes grading 0.9 g/t Au were reasonable estimates.  
These estimates were again verified by the author, Mr. P. Jones, BAppSc, MAIG, 
MAusIMM, Independent Consultant, by wireframing and block modelling and also 
concurs that such Inferred Resources are reasonable estimates.

Notes: 
1. Includes 117,000 tonnes Indicated Resource in Chinapintza having a cut‐off grade of 1.0 g/t Au (see Table 28). 
2. Includes 2,423,000 tonnes Inferred Resource in Chinapintza having a cut‐ff grade of 1.0 g/t Au (see Table 28). 
Table 32: Total Mineral Resource Estimates. (P. Jones, BAppSc, MAIG, MAusIMM, Independent Consultant) 

The resource estimates summarised in Table 32 are a compilation of several 
deposits with quite different geological origins and styles, which if mined, could be 
mined by quite different mining methods including underground and open cut 
methods.  The different mining methods can incur very different operating costs and 
economics.    
 
These resource estimates are based on geological investigations and drilling over a 
period spanning almost 20 years.  Over this period international standards, including 
the CIM guidelines, and general exploration practices have changed considerably.  
With the exception of some of the Chinapintza work, most of the information 
compiled for this report, and the drilling data used for resource estimation of the 
various deposits, is a result of exploration programs conducted since 2005. Upon 
investigation by the author, it has been found that all the data to be reliable and of a 
high standard and complies with the current CIM requirements. 
 
The Indicated and Inferred resources are based on sample spacings that are too far 
apart to ensure that the actual tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, 
grade and mineral content can be estimated with a high level of confidence.  Further 
drilling and sampling on a regular and close spacing is required in all these deposits 
before the level of confidence in the resource estimates could be considered high. 
 
The Condor Gold Project includes a number of highly prospective exploration targets 
including mineralized porphyries, breccia pipes and epithermal veins.  The Condor 
deposits have had their prospectivity confirmed by either one or a combination of 
surface mapping and sampling, geophysical response and in most cases by drilling.  
It is the author's opinion that the recommended extensive exploration program 
outlined in the Recommendations section below is entirely warranted.

Risks 

The reliability or confidence in the exploration information and mineral resources 
estimates contained in this report may be affected by variances in sub-surface 
mineralization, ground conditions and sampling QA/QC procedures and protocols. 

Occasionally, projects yield higher than actual results regarding the grades of 
precious metal mineral ores when exploring and assessing sub-surface 
mineralization such as the mineralisation in the Condor Gold Project.  Likewise, there 
can be no assurance that the exploration results will continue to exhibit good results 
due to natural variation of ground conditions where sometimes there is much less 
mineralisation than expected and at other times there is more. 

While the post 2007 QA/QC sampling protocols meets or exceeds industry 
standards, statistical analysis of the accuracy of 2004-2007 sampling indicated a 
broader variance warranting additional sampling and review.  On the other hand, the 
analysis of sampling revealed a less than 5% failure rate for the entire database, 
indicating a fairly robust database.  However, there is room to improve the variances. 

The project's potential economic viability would be overstated if the variances in sub-
surface mineralization, ground conditions and/or sampling led to higher than 
representative resource estimates.  However, it is the authors' firm opinion that the 
variances are in the acceptable range for the determination of potential economic 
viability, which warrants our recommendations of further exploration as described 
below in the "Recommendations" section. 

In addition to the foregoing, additional more general risks are also discussed below. 

Exploration and Mining Risks  

At the present, none of the Condormining properties have proven or probable 
reserves and the proposed programs are an exploratory search for proven or 
probable reserves. Substantial expenditures are required to establish reserves 
through further drilling.  

No assurance can be given that minerals will be discovered in sufficient quantities or 
having sufficient grade to justify commercial operations or that funds required for 
development can be obtained on a timely basis.  

The economics of developing gold and other mineral properties is affected by many 
factors including the cost of operations, variations of the grade of ore mined, 
fluctuations in the price of minerals produced, costs of processing equipment and 
such other factors as government regulations, including regulations relating to 
environmental protection. In addition, the grade of mineralisation ultimately mined 
may differ from that estimated by drilling results and such differences could be 
material.

Enterprise Capital Corp.  – NI 43-101 – June 2012 Page 101 
AC/1631618.1 

Financing Risks  

Further exploration and development of Condormining's properties will be dependent 
upon Condormining's ability to obtain financing through joint venturing, equity or debt 
financing or other means through itself, Ecuador Capital or Enterprise.  There can be 
no assurance that the Enterprise, Ecuador Capital or Condormining will be able to 
obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of such financing will be 
favourable.  

Mineral Prices  

Metal and mineral prices have fluctuated widely, particularly in recent years. The 
feasible development of metal and mineral properties is highly dependent upon the 
price of the minerals and metals. A sustained and substantial decline in these 
commodity prices could result in the termination of exploration work or loss of its 
interests in identified resource properties.  

Environment and other Regulatory Requirements  

Companies engaged in exploration activities generally experience increased costs 
and delays as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and 
permits.  

There can be no assurance that all permits which Condormining may require in the 
future for exploration and development of its properties will be obtainable at all or 
obtainable on reasonable terms or on a timely basis, or that such laws and 
regulations would not have an adverse effect on any project that Condormining may 
undertake.  

Parties engaged in exploration operations may be required to compensate those 
suffering loss or damage by reason of the exploration activities and may have civil or 
criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations 
and, in particular, environmental laws.

RECOMMENDATIONS 

Additional geological exploration and drilling is likely to increase the estimated 
resources. It is therefore recommended that a detailed surface and drill exploration 
program be initiated and carried out over in a two phase program, with Phase 1 
carried out over 10-12 months.  If Phase 1 is successful, it should be followed by 
Phase 2 carried out over another 12 months.  A general budget is proposed totalling 
approximately $2.2 million dollars for Phase 1 and $6.8 million for Phase 2, as set 
forth in Table 33, below.  This recommended work program should include surface 
geologic, alteration and structural mapping, extensive geochemical sampling, and 
detailed re-logging of earlier drill holes taking into consideration the latest geological 
interpretations of the structures, rock-types and controls on the mineralisation. This 
will require an estimated 10,000m of new drilling in Phase 1 and 37,000m in Phase 2 
to both expand and delineate estimated gold resource areas and to attempt to 
identify new gold occurrences both in outcrop and in isolated drill intercepts.

The geological controls related to the geology, alteration, structural controls at the 
Condor Gold Project have evolved over time with significant advances recently 
achieved by the new geologic staff.  The primary focus will be to explore on the surface 
and drill high grade gold bearing structural zones, structural intersections, mineralized 
breccias and hydrothermal breccias.   However, in addition, significant mid to lower 
grade gold mineralization exists both as disseminated and fracture controlled sulphide 
mineralization in tuffs, rhyolites and quartz feldspar porphyries, which are also to be 
targeted as significant zones to be drilled for expanding current known gold resources.  
Numerous other drill targets also exist and are proposed for drilling that are typical for 
gold or gold/copper related porphyry systems.   
 
It should be noted that significant amounts of silver, zinc, copper, lead and manganese 
occur in many of the existing gold resources and drill targets and these metals have the 
potential to add significant additional resource value in the future drilling.  It is therefore 
recommended that all future resource models include these minerals in any evaluation. 
 
It is recommended that Condormining conduct a typical resource expansion grid drilling 
program to further expand, delineate and define the current gold/copper resource at the 
Santa Barbara gold/copper porphyry project.  It is also recommended to include 
comprehensive surface geology, alteration and structural mapping, extensive 
geochemical sampling and detailed re-logging of earlier drill holes to improve the 
understanding of the geological controls of the mineralisation. 
 
It is further recommended that Condormining conduct detailed surface geology, 
alteration and structural mapping, extensive geochemical sampling and detailed re-
logging of earlier drill holes at the El Hito copper/molybdenum porphyry project to 
improve Condormining's understanding of the controls on the mineralisation at this 
project. This initial work should then be followed up with a reconnaissance drilling 
program to further test and sample this mineralization.
