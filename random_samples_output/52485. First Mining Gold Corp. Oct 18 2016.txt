Executive Summary 
SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. was retained by Gold Canyon Resources Inc. of Vancouver, British 

Columbia, to prepare a technical report summarizing the mineral resources for the Springpole Gold 

Project. The mineral resource estimate forms the basis of this preliminary economic assessment 

(PEA) prepared by SRK. 

Project Concept 

The proposed Springpole Gold Project concept is to develop a low-grade, greenfield gold and silver 

bulk tonnage deposit with open pit mining and conventional milling methods. The production rate 

was assumed to be 20,000 tonnes per day (t/d) with a total of 72.4 million tonnes (Mt) of mineralized 

material mined and processed during the project life. The overall strip ratio (the ratio of waste rock to 

economic mineralized rock) of the mine is approximately 1:7 and the average grade of the plant feed 

is estimated at 1.2 grams per tonne (g/t) of gold and 6.0 g/t of silver. 

Property Description and Ownership 

The Springpole Gold Project is located 110 km northeast of Red Lake, Ontario, and is 100% 

controlled by Gold Canyon. The project's land position comprises 30 patented claims and 300 

unpatented, contiguous mining claims and 6 leased unpatented mining claims totalling an area of 

approximately 32,448 hectares (80,181 acres).  

During late spring, summer, and early fall, the project is accessible by float-plane direct to Springpole 

Lake or Birch Lake. During winter, an ice road approximately 85 km long is constructed from the 

South Bay landing point on Confederation Lake to a point about 1 km from the Springpole camp.  

Geology and Mineralization 

The Springpole area is underlain by a polyphase alkali, trachyte intrusive displaying autolithic 

breccia. The intrusive is comprised of a system of multiple phases of trachyte that is believed to be 

part of the roof zone of a larger syenite intrusive; fragments displaying phaneritic textures were 

observed from deeper drill cores in the southeast portion of the Portage zone. Early intrusive phases 

consist of megacrystic feldspar phenocrysts of albite and orthoclase feldspar in an aphanitic 

groundmass Successive phases show progressively finer grained porphyritic texture while the final 

intrusive phases are aphanitic. Within the country rocks to the north and east are trachyte and 

lamprophyre dikes and sills that source from the trachyte- or syenite-porphyry intrusive system. 

The main intrusive complex appears to contain many of the characteristics of alkaline, porphyry style 

mineralization associated with diatreme breccias (e.g., Cripple Creek, Colorado). This style of 

mineralization is characterized by the Portage zone and portions of the East Extension zone where 

mineralization is hosted by diatreme breccia in aphanitic trachyte. It is suspected that the ductile 

shearing and brittle faulting have played a significant role in redistributing structurally controlled 

blocks of the mineralized rock. Diamond drilling in the winter of 2010 revealed a more complex 

alteration with broader, intense zones of potassic alteration replacing the original rock mass with 

biotite and pyrite. In the core area of the deposit where fine grained disseminated gold mineralization 

occurs with biotite, the primary potassic alteration mineral, gold displays a good correlation with 

potassium/rubidium.

Exploration Status 

The initial geologic and engineering studies at the end of 2009 resulted in the establishment of 

systematic drill sections at 50 m intervals across the three identified prospect areas, namely Portage 

zone, East Extension zone, and Camp zone. The subsequently developed drill program lead to a 

multi-phase drill campaign starting in the summer of 2010 and ending in the summer of 2012, 

resulting in completion of 77,275 m of diamond core drilling in 196 drill holes. During the course of 

the 2010, 2011, and 2012 programs, drilling identified a precious metal deposit of significant strike, 

depth and width within the Portage zone. 

Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 

The mineral resource model prepared by SRK considers 512 core boreholes drilled by Gold Canyon 

and previous owners of the property during the period of 2003 to 2012. The resource estimation 

work was completed by Dr. Gilles Arseneau, PGeo (APEGBC #23474), an appropriate independent 

qualified person as this term is defined in NI 43-101. The effective date of the resource statement is 

October 17, 2012. 

The revised mineral resource estimate (October 17, 2012) was based on a gold price of $1,400/oz 

and a silver price of $15/oz, both considered reasonable economic assumptions by SRK. To 

establish a reasonable prospect of economic extraction in an open pit context, the resources were 

defined within an optimized pit shell with pit walls set at 45°. Assumed recoveries of 80% for gold 

and 60% for silver were used. (Note: A silver recovery assumption of 85% was used for mine design 

and evaluation based on more recent data.) Mining costs were estimated at $2/tonne (t) of total 

material, processing costs estimated at $12/t and general and administrative (G&A) costs estimated 

at $2/t. A cut-off grade (COG) of 0.4 g/t gold was calculated, and is considered to be an 

economically reasonable value corresponding with breakeven mining costs. Approximately 90% of 

the revenue for the proposed project is derived from gold and 10% from silver. 

Note: For the mine development (Whittle™ optimization) and economic analysis in this PEA, 

updated input parameters were used. 

Mineral resources were estimated by ordinary kriging using Gemcom block modelling software in 

10 m x 10 m x 6 m blocks. Grade estimates were based on capped, 3 m composited assay data. 

Capping levels were set at 25 g/t for gold and 200 g/t for silver. Blocks were classified as indicated 

mineral resources if at least two drill holes and six composites were found within a 60 m x 60 m x 40 

m search ellipse. All other interpolated blocks were classified as inferred mineral resource. Mineral 

resources were then validated using Gemcom GEMS (6.4) software. 

This resource model includes mineralized material in the Main, East Extension and Portage zones 

spanning from geologic sections 0-1, 500 m in the northwest to 0-250 m in the southeast. Along the 

axis of the Portage zone, resource modelling includes mineralized material generally ranging from 

the surface to a depth of 340-440 m below surface.  

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. There 

is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resources would be converted into mineral reserves. 

The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, 

title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues. The quantity and grade of reported

inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature. There has been insufficient exploration 

to define these inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource. It is uncertain if 

further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured mineral resource 

category.  

The mineral resources in this report were estimated using current Canadian Institute of Mining, 

Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) standards, definitions and guidelines. The updated resource 

estimate is summarized in Table i.

Note: Mineral resources are reported in relation to a conceptual pit shell. Mineral resources are not 

mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures are rounded to reflect 
the relative accuracy of the estimate. All composites have been capped where appropriate.  

**Open pit mineral resources are reported at a COG of 0.4 g/t gold. COGs are based on a gold price of 
$1,400/oz and a gold processing recovery of 80% and a silver price of $15/oz and a silver processing 
recovery of 60%. 

 

Inferred resources were used in the life of mine (LOM) plan with inferred resources representing 

10% of the material planned for processing. Mineral reserves can only be estimated as a result of an 

economic evaluation as part of a preliminary feasibility study or a feasibility study of a mineral 

project. Accordingly, at the present level of development, there are no mineral reserves at the 

Springpole Gold Project. 

Mine Development and Operations 

The mine development plan for Springpole contemplates open pit mining with a mine plan to 

produce a total of 72 Mt of processing plant feed and 121 Mt of waste (1.7:1 overall strip ratio) over 

an eleven year mine production life. The current LOM plan focuses on achieving steady plant feed 

production rates, and mining of higher grade material early in schedule, as well as balancing grade 

and strip ratios. Figure i illustrates the proposed overall site layout for the project, including the open 

pit, waste rock facilities, and proposed plant site locations. 

The mine design process for the deposit commenced with the development of Whittle optimization 

input parameters. These parameters included estimates of metal price, mining dilution, process 

recovery, offsite costs, geotechnical constraints (slope angles) and royalties (Table ii).

Whittle software was used to determine the optimal mining shells with the assumed overall slope 

angles based on a preliminary geotechnical assessment. Preliminary phases were selected and 

preliminary mine planning and scheduling was then conducted on these selected optimal shells. The 

mineable resources for the deposit are presented in Table iii. Indicated and inferred resources were 

used in the LOM plan of which indicated resources represent about 90% (~ 65 Mt) of the material 

planned to be processed. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated 

economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resources would be 

converted into mineral reserves. Mineral reserves can only be estimated as a result of an economic 

evaluation as part of a pre-feasibility study or a feasibility study of a mineral project. Accordingly, at 

the present level of development there are no mineral reserves at the project.

The mining sequence was divided into a number of stages designed to maximize grade, reduce 

pre-stripping requirements in the early years and, maintain the plant at full production capacity. The 

LOM production schedule is shown in Table iv. The open pit mining operation is planned as an 

owner-operated scenario. A total of 72.4 Mt of mineralized material is proposed to be processed. 

Metallurgy and Mineral Processing 

Three metallurgical testwork programs have been completed on Springpole material since 1989, with 

the majority of work undertaken in the past three years. 

Based on the testwork results reported to date and the range of process flowsheet options 

considered in the 2012/2013 work, a likely flowsheet configuration is a moderately fine grind size 

followed by whole feed leaching. Removal of gravity gold prior to leaching appears to only benefit 

high grade (>5 g/t gold) feed and should be considered an option for the flowsheet. 

This PEA is based on a design plant capacity of 20,000 t/d. Cyanide leach extractions of 80% for 

gold and 85% for silver are expected at this grind size. Product from the process plant will be doré 

bullion. 

While considerable metallurgical testwork has been completed, additional testing is warranted to 

better define the plant design criteria and more confidently predict expected performance. 

Future testwork can consider concentrating the sulphides via flotation or classification into a smaller 

mass so that it can be stored separately from the remainder of the tailings. For example, dry stack or 

subaqueous deposition in the tailings pond to minimise the potential for acid generation.

Waste Management 

The waste rock facility is planned to be located immediately adjacent to the final pit limits. Given the 

deposit configuration and extraction sequence, no backfilling into previously mined out areas has 

been planned for Springpole. 

The waste rock facility would be built in a series of lifts in a "bottom-up" approach, and the facility 

would be constructed by placing material at its natural angle of repose (approximately 1.5H:1V) with 

safety berms spaced at regular intervals giving an overall operational slope of 2:1. The total design 

capacity of the waste rock facility is 121 Mt. 

Roughly 72 Mt of thickened tailings (about 60% solids by mass) will be centrally discharged at a site 

located about 5 km southeast of the proposed mill site. This results in an estimated 45 Mm3 of 

tailings to be stored, based on conservative estimates for a tailings density of 1.6 t/m3. 

Due to the flat topographical relief of the project area, the tailings will be contained by a ring dam 

which will prevent migration of tailings, lake bed sediments, and any free water. The tailings facility is 

designed such that the dams will remain at the initial starter dam height of 2 m, except in the areas 

were a higher dam is required to contain lake bed sediments or prevent the tailings from encroaching 

on nearby lakes. 

To minimize pre-production capital cost, a dam continuously raised over the LOM would be the 

preferred construction method. However, due to the need to contain lake bed sediments (from dike 

construction), the initial ring dam will be constructed to the final dam height in all but a few areas, 

and only minimal raises (less than 1 m) would be required in the remaining areas. 

Three dewatering dikes with a total length of approximately 510 m will be constructed in Springpole 

Lake to allow a portion of the lake to be dewatered. The dikes will be constructed to elevation 391 m 

above mean sea level, which allows 3 m of freeboard above the lake level.The dikes will be 

constructed under wet conditions; therefore, two silt curtains will be deployed downstream of the dike 

locations to prevent high suspended solids in the remainder of the lake. Prior to the placement of fill 

material, the foundation of the dam will be dredged to remove any soft lakebed sediments. The rock 

fill material will be placed, and then the grout curtain and plastic concrete cut-off wall will be built 

through the completed dike. 

An estimated 21.7 Mm3 of water will have to be drained from the area of Springpole Lake within the 

dewatering dikes. Of this, ~80% (17.4 Mm3) is estimated to be clean water which can be discharged 

directly over the dewatering dikes into Springpole Lake, inside the silt curtain. The remaining 20% 

(4.3 Mm3) is assumed to be "murky" (i.e., have suspended solids higher than the allowable discharge 

limits). The murky water will be pumped to the tailings management facility (TMF) which will act as a 

sedimentation pond; no tailings will be in the TMF at this time. Clear water from the TMF will be 

pumped to Springpole Lake. Steps will be taken during the dewatering process to reduce the amount 

of sediments that become suspended in the water, including silt curtains around the water intake 

area.

Project Cost Estimates 

Project costs were estimated from a combination of sources including first principles, reference 

projects, vendor's quotes, cost service publications and SRK experience.  

The capital cost (CAPEX) estimate for the project is shown in Table v at a total of $544M. An overall, 

weighted-average contingency of 15% was used for this project. Property acquisition costs are not 

included in the capital estimate.

Economic Analysis 

The Economic Analysis that forms part of this preliminary economic assessment (PEA) report is 

intended to provide an initial review of the Gold Canyon Resources Inc. Springpole Gold Project's 

potential and is preliminary in nature. The economic analysis incuded in this PEA includes 

consideration of inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have 

the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral 

reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA based on these mineral resources will be realized. 

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

The base case economic analysis results indicate a post-tax NPV of $388M (pre-tax NPV: $579M) at 

a 5% discount rate with an IRR of 14% (pre-tax IRR: 25%). Payback (post-tax, non-discounted) will 

be in Year 3 of production in a projected 11 year LOM production period. The economics are based

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

on a base case of $1,300/oz long-term gold price, $25/oz long-term silver price, and production rate 

of 20,000 t/d over 365 d/yr. Direct operating costs are estimated to be $636/oz of AuEq. Total capital 

costs are estimated at $544M, consisting of initial capital costs of $438M, and ongoing sustaining 

capital of $106M.  

Sensitivity analysis indicates that, at base case metal price assumptions, the project may be able to 

absorb significant escalation in capital and operating costs and remain a potentially viable economic 

proposition. 

Conclusions 

Industry standard mining, process design, construction methods, and economic evaluation practices 

were used to assess the Springpole Gold Project. Based on current knowledge and assumptions, 

the results of this study indicate that the project has positive economics within the preliminary 

parameters of a PEA and should be advanced to the next level of study - either preliminary feasibility 

or feasibility. 

The preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature; it includes inferred mineral resources 

that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to 

them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that 

the preliminary economic assessment will be realized. 

While a significant amount of information is still required to do a complete assessment, at this point 

there do not appear to be any fatal flaws for the project. The study achieved its original objective of 

providing a preliminary review of the potential economic viability of the Springpole Gold Project. 

Risks and Opportunities 

As with almost all mining ventures, there are a large number of risks and opportunities that can affect 

the outcome of the project. Most of these risks and opportunities are based on uncertainty, such as 

lack of scientific information (test results, drill results, etc.) or the lack of control over external factors 

(metal price, exchange rates, etc.). 

Subsequent higher-level engineering studies would be required to further refine these risks and 

opportunities, identify new risks and opportunities, and define strategies for risk mitigation or 

opportunity implementation. 

The principal risks identified for the Springpole Gold Project are summarized as follows: 

 Geological interpretation and mineral resource classification (10% of the resources used in the 

mine plan are Inferred); 

 Due to a relatively small number of metallurgical samples tested, larger variations in mineralogy 

and metal recovery may exist than have been observed to date; 

 Geotechnical and hydrogeological considerations; 

 No information on baseline groundwater quality; 

 No physical characterization of the tailings material has been done;

 Construction management and cost containment during development of the project; 

 High exposure to potential escalation of costs associated with latent ground conditions due to 

need for dewatering dykes and large, shallow TSF;  

 The permitting period associated with the project could be significantly longer than assumed in 

this study; 

 Increased OPEX and/or CAPEX; and 

 Reduced metal prices. 

The following opportunities may improve the project economics: 

 Metallurgical testwork has indicated that gold recoveries up to 90% are possible with a finer 

grind. Trade-off studies should be carried out to determine whether it's feasible to incorporate a 

finer grind process into the flowsheet; 

 Pit optimization work with the Whittle software identified a number of potential pit shells (or 

phases) and the selected pit shell provides higher grades, lower strip ratio, and reduced capital 

and operating expense; 

 Recently completed geotechnical drilling for pit slope stability analysis may increase pit slopes 

angles over those used in this PEA; 

 There are other geophysical targets around the current resource, particularly to the southwest of 

the current resource. Additional drilling has the potential to add resources; 

 Investigations may reveal that sufficient quantities of low permeability material for core 

construction may be available on-site and bedrock may be located at a shallower depth than 

assumed in the cost estimate; 

 Lake dewatering could occur at a faster rate if the water was discharged into several different 

lakes; 

 The potential to upgrade the mineral resource classification of the deposit; and 

 Improved metal prices. 

 

Recommendations 

SRK believes the project should be taken to the next level of engineering study and economic 

assessment, typically a pre-feasibility study. It is estimated that a pre-feasibility, along with all of the 

accompanying engineering and field work would cost approximately $5M (excluding additional 

resource development drilling programs). Some of the activities involved to advance the project 

include: 

 Additional metallurgical testwork; 

 Initiate project permitting; 

 Consummate agreements with First Nations groups; and 

 Convert remaining inferred resources to indicated resources.

1 Introduction and Terms of Reference 

This report comprises a National Instrument (NI) 43-101 and Form 43-101F compliant technical 

report that summarizes the findings of an independent resource estimate and preliminary economic 

assessment of the Springpole Gold Project in northwest Ontario, Canada. SRK Consulting (Canada) 

Inc. prepared this report in collaboration with Gold Canyon Resources Inc. (TSX: GCU) at the 

request of Mr. Troy J. Fierro, CEO and director of the company, which currently owns a 100% 

interest in the Springpole Gold Project. SRK is not an insider, associate, or an affiliate of Gold 

Canyon and does not hold any interest in the Springpole Gold Project. 

The contents of this report reflect various technical and economic conditions at the time of writing. 

Given the nature of the mining business, these conditions can change significantly over relatively 

short periods of time. Accordingly, actual results may be significantly more or less favourable. 

In addition, this report may include technical information that requires subsequent calculations to 

derive subtotals, totals, and weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of 

rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, SRK does not consider 

them to be material. The estimate of mineral resources conforms to the Canadian Institute of Mining, 

Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 

These standards were prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and 

adopted by CIM council on November 27, 2010. They are referred to in NI 43-101 Standards of 

Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  

The economic analysis provides only a preliminary overview of the project economics based on 

broad, factored assumptions. As per CIM guidelines, reserves can only be declared with a 

preliminary feasibility-level study.  

The mineral resources used in the life of mine (LOM) plan and economic analysis include inferred 

material. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic 

considerations applied to them for categorization as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty the 

inferred resources will be upgraded to a higher resource category. Consequently, there is no 

certainty the results of this PEA will be realized. 

This report is considered current as of March 25, 2013. 

1.1 Source of Information 

This report is based, in part, on internal company technical reports and maps, published government 

reports, company letters and memoranda, and public information (Section 27). Several sections from 

reports authored by other consultants are directly quoted in this report and are referenced 

accordingly. SRK has not conducted detailed land status evaluations and has relied upon previous 

qualified reports, public documents, and statements by Mr. Fierro regarding property status and legal 

title to the project.  

In addition to the site visits described below, a qualified person carried out a study of all relevant 

parts of the available literature, documented results concerning the project, and held discussions 

regarding all pertinent aspects of the project with technical personnel from the company.

1.2 Site Visits 

In accordance with NI 43-101 guidelines, Dr. Gilles Arseneau, PGeo, associate consultant with SRK, 

visited the project between February 10 and 12, 2012, for two days and again on August 8 and 9, 

2012. An additional site visit to the Springpole property was conducted by Dino Pilotto, PEng; 

Dr. Maritz Rykaart, PEng; and Bruce Murphy, FSAIMM from November 27 to 29, 2012, accompanied 

by Jim Muntzert, senior project manager for Gold Canyon. 

The purpose of these site visits was to review the digitalization of the exploration database and 

validation procedures, review exploration procedures, define geological modelling procedures, 

examine drill core, interview project personnel, and collect all relevant information needed for 

preparing the revised mineral resource estimate and preliminary economic assessment. The site 

visits also aimed at investigating the geological and structural controls on the distribution of the gold 

mineralization to aid the construction of three dimensional gold mineralization domains. 

SRK was given full access to relevant data and conducted interviews of Gold Canyon personnel to 

obtain information on past exploration work and to understand procedures used to collect, record, 

store, and analyze historical and current exploration data. During the visits, particular attention was 

given to the treatment and validation of historical drilling data.

3.3 Mineral Tenure 

 Claim Ownership 

Gold Canyon acquired ownership of five patented claims in 1993 (11229, 11230, 11231, 12868, and 

12869) covering a total area of 96.54 ha (238.55 acres) from Milestone Exploration Limited, a 

predecessor entity by way of amalgamation of Jubilee Gold Inc. These claims are subject to a 3% 

net smelter royalty (NSR) on all minerals mined, produced, and sold from these patented claims, 

provided the monthly average gold price is $700 or more. The NSR was increased to 5%, together 

with a NSR of 1 to 2.5% on other adjoining properties in which Gold Canyon conducted any mining 

operations.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

In 2010, Gold Canyon renegotiated the applicable NSR on these patented claims with Jubilee  This 

agreement terminated any applicable royalty on adjoining claims and set the applicable NSR rate 

payable upon commencement of commercial production at 3% with advance royalty payments of 

$70,000/yr, adjusted using the yearly Consumer Price Index.  

Gold Canyon retained an option to acquire 1% of the NSR for $1,000,000 at any time. In 

consideration of the renegotiated royalties, the company agreed that previously paid advanced 

royalties would be forfeited and not credited to any NSR subsequently payable to Jubilee. The 

company paid Jubilee $50,000 and issued to it 100,000 common shares and agreed to issue a 

further 100,000 common shares on each anniversary date up to the fifth anniversary of TSX Venture 

Exchange approval of the new agreement.  

Gold Canyon may terminate all royalty obligations by transfer of the patented claims back to Jubilee. 

Gold Canyon retains a right of first refusal on any sale of the remaining royalty interest on certain 

terms and conditions. The five patented claims identified above are fee simple parcels with mining 

and surface rights attached to all five claims registered with the Land Registry Office, Kenora, 

Ontario. The company has confirmed via independent legal counsel the five claims have been 

surveyed, are in good standing, and the property taxes are paid to date. 

 Leased Claims from Shirley Frahm 

Gold Canyon leases 10 patented claims (11233-11235, 12896-12901, and 13043) covering a total 

area of 182.25 hectares (450.34 acres) from Shirley Frahm of Rochelle, Illinois, USA. These 10 

patented claims are fee simple parcels with mining and surface rights attached to all 10 patented 

claims registered, together with the notices of lease, with the Land Registry Office in Kenora, 

Ontario. The lease is for a term of 21 years less one day and terminates on April 14, 2031. The lease 

stipulates Gold Canyon is to pay all applicable property taxes related to the 10 claims during the 

lease term together with advance royalty payments on a sliding scale of $50,000/yr (2011-2016), 

$60,000 (2016-2021), and $80,000 (2021-2031). These payments are to be credited to future NSR 

payables, if any.  

A 3% NSR is payable upon commencement of commercial production. On the 10 patented claims, 

Gold Canyon retained an option to acquire up to 2% of the NSR for $1,000,000 per 1% at any time. 

Gold Canyon has the right to access the 10 claims to conduct mining operations and produce all 

ores, minerals, and metals that are or may be found therein or thereon— provided the company has 

reserved a small portion of aggregate surface area for the recreational use of Ms. Frahm. 

Gold Canyon holds an option to acquire the 10 patented claims and would be required to do so upon 

the commencement of commercial production on these or certain adjoining patented claims, 

exercisable by the company within five years of date of the lease agreement. This option term is 

renewable for a further period of five years by providing notice and a $25,000 payment to Ms. 

Frahm. The consideration payable is, at the option of Gold Canyon on exercise or at the option of 

Ms. Frahm upon commencement of commercial production, either (a) a $5M with Ms. Frahm 

retaining a 1% NSR or (b) $4M with Ms. Frahm retaining a 2% NSR. Gold Canyon retains a right of 

first refusal on any sale of the remaining royalty interest on certain terms and conditions. The 

company has confirmed via independent legal counsel the 10 patented claims have been surveyed, 

are in good standing, and the property taxes are paid to date.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 Lease Claims from Springpole Group 

Gold Canyon has an option and lease to a further 15 patented claims (11236, 12867, 12871-12874, 

12902-12909) covering a total area of 310.19 hectares (766.5 acres) from a group of individuals 

and/or companies collectively referred to as the "Springpole Group". These 15 patented claims are 

fee simple parcels with mining and surface rights attached to all 15 patented claims registered, 

together with the notice of option and lease, with the Land Registry Office, Kenora, Ontario. The term 

of the option is for five years with five renewal option periods of five years each. These options can 

be exercised by Gold Canyon before expiry of the earlier option period by confirmation of good 

standing of the agreement and payment of a $50,000 renewal fee.  

Gold Canyon is required to make option payments in the aggregate amount of $35,000/yr and to 

expend an aggregate of C$300,000 on mining operations in each option term as a condition of any 

renewal and to pay all property taxes related to these patented claims. Gold Canyon is granted 

during the option term, the exclusive lease, the right and interest to enter upon the 15 patented 

claims, the right to conduct mining operations, and the right to have quiet possession thereof. The 

company also has the right, at its discretion to make any use or uses of the 15 patented claims 

consistent with the foregoing including the construction of roads, railways, conveyors, plants, 

buildings, and aircraft landing areas, as well as the alteration of the surface of the property subject to 

all applicable laws. Gold Canyon has reserved a small portion of aggregate surface area for the 

recreational use of a cabin by the members of the Springpole Group. 

Gold Canyon holds an option to acquire the 15 claims and would be required to do so upon the 

commencement of commercial production at any time during the option period by payment of an 

aggregate of $2M. Upon exercise of the purchase option, Gold Canyon must also acquire the cabin 

on the property for the lesser of fair market value or $20,000. A 3% NSR is applicable during the 

option term upon commencement of commercial production or a 1% NSR if the purchase option is 

exercised prior to commercial production. Gold Canyon can acquire the remaining 1% NSR by a 

payment of $500,000. The company has confirmed via independent legal counsel that the 15 

patented claims have been surveyed, are in good standing, and the property taxes are paid to date.  

 Claims Leased from the Crown 

In Ontario, Crown Lands are available to licenced prospectors for the purposes of mineral 

exploration. A licenced prospector must first stake an unpatented mining claim to gain the exclusive 

right to prospect on Crown Land. Claims can also be staked in areas where surface rights are not 

owned by the Crown if the ground is open for staking and mineral rights can be obtained. Claim 

staking is governed by the Ontario Mining Act and is administered through the Provincial Mining 

Recorder and Mining Lands Consultant Office of the MNDM. A total of 300 contiguous unpatented 

mining claims covering approximately 31,776 ha (78,520 acres) make up the greater area of the 

Springpole Gold Project and have been staked directly by Gold Canyon. A list of these unpatented 

claims including township/area, claim number, recording date, claim due date, and status is included 

in Appendix A. 

An additional six unpatented mining claims (KRL562895 to KRL562900) and related Crown leases 

for surface rights were acquired by Gold Canyon from an individual in July 2011 for an aggregate 

payment of $300,000. These claims are subject to a 3% NSR rate payable upon commencement of 



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 9 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

commercial production with advance royalty payments of $50,000/yr. Gold Canyon retained an 

option to acquire all or a portion of the applicable NSR at a rate of $500,000 per 1% of the NSR at 

any time. Gold Canyon has permitted the vendor to use a small portion of the property subject to the 

Crown leases, including a vacation home, for recreational purposes provided Gold Canyon was 

granted a 20 year option to purchase the vacation home for the price determined by an AACI 

valuator. The vacation home is required to be purchased upon commencement of commercial 

production.  

Subsequent to the acquisition, the Crown leases were to expire. In consultation with the MNDM, 

Gold Canyon applied for the lease of these claims to be renewed for an additional 21 years, effective 

August 31, 2011. As of March 13, 2012, Gold Canyon has confirmed via independent legal counsel 

that it has complied with all the requirements for lease renewal and that payment has been received 

by the MNDM. Gold Canyon subsequently received the lease renewal from the Crown Lands Office. 

 Claim Maintenance 

All unpatented claims are liable for inspection at any time by the MNDM and may be cancelled for 

irregularities or fraud in the staking process. Disputes of mining claims by third parties are accepted 

after one year of the recording date or after the first unit of assessment work is filed and approved. A 

claim remains valid as long as the claim holder properly completes and files the assessment work as 

required by the Mining Act and the Minister approves the assessment work.  

To keep an unpatented mining claim current, the mining claim holder must perform $400 per mining 

claim unit worth of approved assessment work per year, immediately following the initial staking 

date. The claim holder has two years to file one year worth of assessment work.  

Surface rights are separate from mining rights. Should any method of mining be appropriate, other 

than those claims for which Crown leases were issued, the surface rights would need to be secured. 

3.4 Environmental Liabilities 

PDAC's Excellence in Environmental Stewardship e-toolkit (PDAC 2009) is used to ensure best 

practice methods are applied to mineral exploration at Springpole. Improvements to critical areas 

that affect the environment are underway at all times in an attempt to reduce the environmental 

footprint of exploration activities. No material environmental liabilities or public hazards associated 

with the Springpole Gold Project are known to exist on the property. A temporary camp (~0.5 ha) 

with wood frame tents was erected for ongoing drilling campaigns. There has been occasional 

surface clearing related to past drilling work.  

3.5 Permits 

GCU complies with permit, notice and consultation requirements as they relate to the on-going 

exploration work on the project. Legislation that requires material permits and notices include the 

provincial Mining Act, Public Lands Act, Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, Ontario Water 

Resources Act, as well as the federal Fisheries Act. 

Gold Canyon has initiated negotiations with surrounding First Nations communities, but to date no 

formal memorandum of understanding agreements have been signed.

4 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure 
and Physiography 

4.1 Accessibility 

During late spring, summer, and early fall, the Springpole Gold Project is accessible by floatplane 

direct to Springpole Lake or Birch Lake. All fuel, food, and material supplies are flown in from Red 

Lake or Pickle Lake, Ontario, or from Winnipeg, Manitoba, with flight distances of 110 km, 167 km, 

and 370 km, respectively. The closest road access at present is the landing at the old South Bay 

Mine on Confederation Lake, approximately 50 km away by air.  

During winter, an ice road approximately 85 km long is constructed from the South Bay landing point 

on Confederation Lake to a point about 1 km from Springpole Lake camp (Figure 3.1). During 

breakup in spring and freeze-up in fall, access to Springpole is by helicopter. 

4.2 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

There is no existing infrastructure within 50 km of the Springpole Gold Project area. Businesses in 

Red Lake, a long established mining community 110 km to the southwest, provide the majority of the 

camp's supply needs. The nearest emergency medical facilities are at the Margaret Cochenour 

Hospital in Red Lake. 

The nearest major city is Winnipeg, Manitoba, which is approximately 370 km southwest of 

Springpole and about a 1.3 hour flight by Cessna Caravan. 

4.3 Climate and Physiography 

January temperatures range between -40°C and 0°C, and July temperatures range between 20°C 

and 40°C.  

Springpole and Birch Lakes are part of the Albany River system, which flows eastward into Cat River 

and then northward into Hudson Bay. The property is underlain by glaciated terrain characteristic of 

a large part of the Canadian Shield. Land areas are generally of low relief with less than 30 m of 

local elevation and are separated by a series of interconnected, shallow lakes. 

Tree cover consists of mature spruce, balsam, birch and poplar. Black spruce and muskeg swamps 

occupy low-lying areas. Glacial till is generally less than 1 m in thickness. Outcrops are limited and 

small and are generally covered by a thick layer of moss or muskeg.  

Figure 4.1 displays the typical landscape of the Springpole Gold Project area. Note the drill rig 

working on Springpole Lake near the shore.

5 History 

The history of the Springpole Gold Project prior to 2006 is excerpted from the Technical Report and 

Resource Estimate on the Springpole Lake Gold Property (Armstrong et al 2006). Drill log 

compilation and assay data compilation have formed an important part of the work presented in this 

report.  

Gold exploration on the property was carried out during two main periods, one during the 1920s to 

1940s, and a second period from 1985 to the present. 

In 1925, the discovery of gold at Red Lake brought prospectors into the Springpole Lake area. 

Visible gold in outcrop on the property was first discovered north of the Birch-Springpole Lake 

portage and prospected by Northern Aerial Mineral Exploration Ltd. in 1928 (Harding 1936). The 

showing was initially covered with eight claims around 1933 by prospector Tom Dunkin, who then 

completed the first stripping and shallow trenching in 1934. 

Between 1933 and 1936, the Windigokan Sturgeon Mining Syndicate conducted extensive trenching 

and prospecting, including 10 short holes totalling 458.5 m (1,504 ft). The claims were then 

transferred to Springpole Mines Ltd. who carried out limited trenching and prospecting in 1945. 

The Casey Summit Mine (later renamed the Casummit Mine), approximately 10 km to the north, 

started operation around this time. This mine ultimately produced 101,975 oz of gold and 9,788 oz of 

silver (Beakhouse 1990) and is the only significant past producer of precious metals in the Birch-

Springpole Lake area. 

This early prospecting activity and production from the Casummit Mine region prompted a more 

detailed geological investigation of the vicinity by the Ontario Department of Mines. The Birch Lake 

area was mapped at a scale of 1:63,360 by Harding (1936). 

Reconnaissance-style mapping of the Birch-Springpole Lake area has since been repeated four 

times: 

1. To study volcanic characteristics of selected Superior Province greenstone belts (Goodwin 

1967), 

2. To extend volcanic stratigraphy hosting the South Bay base metal mine into the Springpole area 

(Thurston et al. 1981), 

3. To stimulate gold exploration in the area after closure of several mines near Red Lake (Good et 

al. 1988), and 

4. To study the stratigraphy of epiclastic and volcaniclastic facies units, northern Birch-Uchi 

greenstone belt (Devaney 2001a). 

The area remained dormant until 1985 when Goldfields Canadian Mining, Ltd. (GFCM) optioned the 

Frahm claims and, in 1986, the Milestone claims and Maple Leaf (now Springpole Group) claims. 

GFCM conducted an airborne (Aerodat) geophysical survey in 1985 over the entire claim group. On

the 30 patented claims (Frahm, Milestone, and Springpole Group), line cutting was done at both 30.5 

m (100ft) centers (Milestone claims) and 61 m (200ft) centers (Frahm and Springpole Group 

claimes). Subsequently, geological mapping, humus geochemistry, and ground geophysics (VLF, 

Mag, and IP) were conducted over the grids. 

From 1986 through 1989, GFCM completed 118 diamond drill holes in seven drill phases totalling 

38,349 m (125,816 ft). In addition, during 1986 and 1987, approximately 116,119 m2 (1.25 ft2) of 

mechanical stripping was carried out by the company, and four petrographic reports were produced. 

As a result of this work, GFCM identified several gold-bearing zones on the property that included: 

 the Portage zone, entirely under the lake but the largest of the zones and, therefore, the main 

focus of the bulk of the exploration work;  

 the Jasper zone, a deep narrow higher grade zone in a banded iron formation horizon; and  

 several smaller but higher grade zones on the land portion of the property and close to surface, 

including the Main zone, Vein zone, Hillside zone, Camp zone, North Porphyry zone and East 

Extension zone. 

Late in 1989, GFCM entered into a 50/50 joint venture with the combined interests of Noranda and 

Akiko-Lori Resources Ltd. 

From 1989 through 1992 Noranda conducted an IP survey over the central portion of the Portage 

zone under Springpole Lake and tested the property with eighteen core holes totalling 6,195 m 

(20,323 ft). The majority of the drilling was conducted on the Portage zone.  

At the same time, and under a separate option agreement with BP Resources Canada, Noranda 

completed a seven core hole drill program around the east margins of Springpole Lake on claims 

then owned by BP Resources. BP Resources in turn completed lake-bottom sediment sampling of 

Springpole Lake east of Johnson Island. 

In 1992, Noranda dropped its interest in the property leaving Akiko-Lori to carry out further 

exploration while carrying its 50% partnership with GFCM. During 1993 and 1994, Akiko-Lori/Akiko 

Gold completed an additional 15 diamond drill holes on the Portage zone totalling 4,850 m (15,913 

ft).  

By 1995, Akiko Gold was reorganized into Gold Canyon Resources Inc. and GFCM's interest was 

acquired by Santa Fe Mining as part of an asset exchange with London based Hanson Plc., which 

controlled GFCM. During 1995, a joint venture between Gold Canyon and Santa Fe carried out an 

exploration program consisting of remapping of the main area, of some of the existing drill core, and 

a reinterpretation of the geology. 

During the 1995 and 1996 programs, Santa Fe drilled an additional 69 holes totalling 15,085 m 

(49,492 ft) on the Springpole Gold Project proper and two drill holes on Johnson Island. By late 

1996, the takeover of Santa Fe by Newmont Gold Company was nearing completion. Just prior to 

the merger with Newmont, Santa Fe exchanged their 50% interest in the property for a tax credit that 

left Gold Canyon with a 100% ownership. After Santa Fe's departure, Gold Canyon continued 

exploration in 1997 and 1998 with another 51 core holes totalling 5,642 m (18,510 ft).

Paso Rico Resources Ltd. had an option to earn an interest in the Project and, in the summer of 

1998, conducted with Gold Canyon a lake bottom sediment sampling program in several areas of 

Springpole. The results of this survey identified several follow-up targets that were tested in 1999 by 

Paso Rico with 12 core holes totalling 2,779 m (9,117 ft). In 2000, Paso Rico withdrew from the 

project leaving Gold Canyon with its current 100% interest.  

During 2004, 2005, and 2006, diamond drilling programs were conducted on the property by Gold 

Canyon. Summaries of the drilling results are reported in Section 9 of the 2006 technical report 

(Armstrong et al.) and summarized in Table 5.1 below.

5.1 Fall 2007 Program 

In the fall of 2007, Gold Canyon embarked on a limited exploration program to further investigate the 

Fluorite zone that was identified by Noranda during its trenching program in 1990. Noranda identified 

the potential for Ontario's largest undeveloped fluorite deposit in the form of a Sovite (calcitic 

carbonatite) from four trenches and having over 850 m of strike with high grade values up to 35.6% 

CaF2.  

During the course of the program 46 1-m samples were collected from four "cuts" across a 

previously identified 23 m wide zone of fluorite mineralization at the western end of Long Skinny 

Pond—a thin narrow pond to the north of camp that channels water from Birch Lake to Round Pond 

and into Springpole Lake via a narrow stream channel. 

Sampling results were inconclusive as fluorite content (CaF2) was not analyzed. Additionally, the 

samples were tested for their rare earth element potential but these results also were inconclusive. 

Gold values were borderline anomalous and did not warrant any follow up.

5.2 Summer–Fall 2009 Program 

From early August thru the end of October 2009, Gold Canyon embarked on a core re-logging and 

re-sampling program. Five geologists, under the supervision of Jeff Chambers, a senior consulting 

geologist, re-logged and re-sampled a portion of the historic drill core stored at Gold Canyon's 

project site and temporary tent camp.  

A total of 417 diamond drill holes were completed on the Springpole Gold Project prior to 2009; 

drilling had begun in 1933 (Zabev 2004). This amounted to a total of approximately 98,262 m of core 

drilled. Unfortunately, not all the drill core is on-site. The 1933 thru 1936 drill holes 1 to 10 are 

missing. Also missing are drill holes BL-20 thru BL-53 completed by the GFCM exploration program 

from 1986to 1988. From drill log records, it appears the whole cores were sent for analysis. Drill hole 

BL-95A is missing—extension of BL-95 completed during the Noranda program in early 1990. In 

addition to missing holes, there are many intervals throughout the core inventory that are missing.  

At the time the re-logging and re-sampling program was conducted, the full database of available 

historic core logs and historic assay data was not fully compiled and was not available to the 

geologists working in the field. The data used in the field were a compilation from the database that 

was compiled as a result of the work carried out for the previous technical report (Armstrong et al. 

2006). 

5.3 Core Re-Logging Program 

A total of 115 drill holes were re-logged during the fall 2009 program, which equates to 

approximately 31% of the 374 drill holes that are believed to be on the property. Forty-nine drill holes 

are known to be missing, and the above count does not include the numerous mineralized intervals 

that are missing within drill holes that were and were not re-logged. 

Core re-logging was carried out in a summary format designed to be easily incorporated into later 

modelling efforts. This meant drill holes were divided into broad units based upon average lithology, 

alteration, and mineralization. Quality of logging varied between geologists, as it was clear that a 

formal standard for logging was not adopted. Logging efforts were further hampered by core 

intervals that contained little, if any, useful material due to sampling of all or nearly all of the 

recovered core, as well as degradation and decay of core boxes and core racks. 

The information obtained from the re-logging exercise was used to plan the phased drill program of 

2010 to 2012. All re-logged core forms were scanned and now form a part of the digital database 

stored at the Gold Canyon's office in Vancouver, British Columbia. 

At the end of the core re-logging program, several days were taken to examine drill core from critical 

areas. The top 6 to 12 m (20 to 40 ft) of core was examined briefly, and a simplified lithology was 

assigned. Overburden was excluded. The intent of the exercise was to apply the noted lithology to 

produce a crude geologic map. This could then be used to assess the outline geometry of the 

trachyte intrusive, and all the associated breccia phases.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

A total of 2,580 samples were taken from the historic drill core. This included 132 standards, blanks, 

and duplicates, totalling approximately 5% of the number of samples collected. All samples were 

taken from drill core that was re-sampled by cutting the remaining drill core in half. This resulted in 

either a half or a quarter of the core remaining, depending on whether the interval had been sampled 

originally. Due to the small core diameter, core was not cut to less than one-quarter to preserve 

material for future reference. Table 5.2 represents significant intercepts from historic drilling 

combined with the re-sampling work outlined here. 

At the end of the core re-sampling program, 14 samples for thin-section petrographic analysis and 3 

samples for mineral petrographic analysis were collected. The samples collected were deemed 

representative of the principal lithologies occurring across the Springpole Gold Project.

6 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

6.1 Regional Geology 

The following excerpt is quoted from Devaney (2001b) and provides the most concise geologic 

description of the regional geology of the Springpole-Birch Lake area: 

The Birch-Uchi Greenstone Belt (Figure 6.1) is the portion of the Uchi Sub-province with an 

arcuate, concave to the southeast, (i.e., a major oroclinal bend between the Red Lake and 

Meen-Dempster portions of the sub-province). Studies of the southern part of the Birch-Uchi 

greenstone belt as a rootless greenstone belt only a few kilometres thick, have revealed a 

long (ca. 3.0 to 2.7 Ga), multistage history of crustal development. Based on mapping, 

lithogeochemistry, and radiometric dating, the supracrustal rocks of the greenstone belt were 

subdivided into three stratigraphic group-scale units (listed in decreasing age): the Balmer, 

Woman and Confederation assemblages. This three-part subdivision was applied to most of 

the Uchi Subprovince. The Confederation assemblage is thought to be a continental margin 

(Andean-type) arc succession, versus the less certain tectono-stratigraphic context of the 

other assemblages. Workers performing recent and ongoing studies of the southern Birch-

Uchi greenstone belt and the Red Lake greenstone belt (i.e., the Western Uchi Subprovince 

NATMAP Project) have proposed some modifications and additions to the Balmer-Woman-

Confederation stratigraphic scheme. As discussed herein, some relatively small 

conglomeratic units likely form a synorogenic, discontinuously distributed, post-

Confederation assemblage in the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt. Radiometrically dated plutons 

within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt are of post-Confederation assemblage, ca. 2725-2700 

Ma age. 

The northern margin of the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt forms a pattern of sub-regional scale 

cusps of supracrustal strata alternating with batholiths. Basaltic units are prominent around 

the periphery of the greenstone belt and may be part of the Woman assemblage but the 

accuracy of this stratigraphic assignment is unknown. Based on a ca. 2740 Ma age of 

Shabumeni Lake [intermediate to felsic fragmental] volcanic rocks at a site near the northern 

greenstone belt margin, suggested that Confederation assemblage age rocks make up the 

bulk of the greenstone belt. 

It is noteworthy that in many of the regional geology descriptions of the Birch-Uchi Greenstone Belt, 

especially those in the vicinity of Springpole and Birch Lakes, the structural geology is poorly 

understood. Many authors make relatively brief mention of the complexities that dominate the 

geology and geomorphology of the low lying areas. However, the Archean Orogenic gold deposit 

model developed by various authors has been applied to the mineral deposits of the Archean 

Superior Province. Recent concise summaries of these orogenic gold deposits can be found Groves 

et al. (1998), Hagemann and Cassidy (2000), Goldfarb et al. (2005), and Robert et al.(2005).  

Orogenic gold deposits are epigenetic, structurally controlled gold deposits that are hosted in 

orogenic belts. They are generally accepted as having formed during late stages of continental 

collision. Most of the discovered orogenic gold deposits in the world occur in greenstone belts 

situated on the margins or within Archean cratons in North America, Australia, and southern Africa.

6.2 Property Geology 

The Springpole prospect has been extensively studied during past programs and the findings of 

those studies will not be covered in detail here; however, they are adequately covered in the 

technical reports of Zabev (2004) and Armstrong et al. (2006).  

The following subsections summarize the geology interpreted from field observations and 

petrographic analysis of drill core from the 2009 re-logging program and from drill core produced 

during the 2010 and 2011 programs. Simplified drill hole geology from a number of selected sections 

can be found in Appendix B. 

 Trachyte Porphyry Intrusive 

A polyphase alkali, trachyte intrusive displaying autolithic breccia textures lies at the heart of the 

Springpole Gold Project. The intrusive is comprised of a system of multiple phases of trachyte 

believed to be part of the roof zone of a larger syenite intrusive, as fragments displaying phaneritic 

textures were observed from deeper drill cores in the southeast portion of the Portage zone. Early 

intrusive phases consist of megacrystic feldspar phenocrysts, up to 5 cm long, of albite and 

orthoclase feldspar in an aphanitic groundmass. Successive phases show progressively finer 

grained porphyritic texture while the final intrusive phases are aphanitic.

In 2009 and 2010, Gold Canyon carried out petrographic studies (Saunders and McIntosh 2009, 

2010) of historic drill core and drill core from the drill holes SP10-001 through SP11-006. The study 

confirmed trachyte intrusive is the dominant lithology within the project area and is a host to 

mineralization. Interpretation of the intrusive complex is complicated by a mixture of overprinted 

regional and local metamorphic events related to burial and tectonism Pervasive alteration and 

metamorphism have reduced the original porphyry intrusive to a complex alteration assemblage 

dominated by sericite, biotite, pyrite, calcite/dolomite, and quartz. Primary igneous textures are 

remarkably well preserved in places and give indications to the possible genesis of the initial phase 

of gold mineralization. Within the country rocks to the north and east are trachyte and lamprophyre 

dikes and sills that source from the trachyte - or syenite-porphyry intrusive system. 

 Confederation Age Volcanic and Siliciclastic Rocks 

The country rocks pre-date the alkali intrusive and are composed of a complex sequence of altered 

and metamorphosed intermediate andesitic volcanic rocks and associated volcaniclastics, 

siliciclastic sedimentary rocks, chemical sediments including banded iron formation (BIF), and 

coarse pebble conglomerates. Devaney (2001a) indicates that the sediments are likely of the 

Confederation assemblage dating at around 2,740 Ma, representing the proximal portions of a mixed 

volcanic-sedimentary basin. 

 "Timiskaming-type" Conglomerates 

Barron (1996) states pebble conglomerate outcrops between Springpole Lake and Birch Lake 

contain clasts of the trachyte porphyry, suggesting that the "Timiskaming-type" conglomerates 

postdate intrusion. Devaney (2001a) suggests these arcuate form conglomerates represent late 

orogenic, deformed, dextral sense strike-slip (pull-apart) basins of "Timiskaming-type," late Archean, 

post Confederation assemblage age rocks. 

6.3 Structure 

Deformation has added complexity to the apparent geometry of, and the potential of, the Springpole 

gold deposit. Gravity and magnetic surveys carried out across the Springpole Gold Project 

demonstrate that several phases of deformation are evident. Banded iron formations describe north-

northwest facing tight to isoclinal antiforms and synforms, and are illustrated on the property geologic 

map produced during the Summer 2005 Mapping Program (Armstrong et al. 2006) and are evident 

as strong magnetic anomalies on the aeromagnetic surveys conducted by Fugro.  

In 2011, SRK was contracted to carry out a preliminary study of the structural controls on 

mineralized deposit geometry. The study found the deposit was subjected to several deformational 

events including, but not limited to: 

 Early folding resulting in tight to isoclinal fold geometries and development of associated shear 

zones, 

 Intermediate large scale, potentially deep rooted shear zones, and 

 Late stage brittle faulting.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Further study is required to definitively establish the relationship of the timing of deformational events 

with respect to economic mineralization. 

6.4 Alteration 

All rocks on the property exhibit pervasive alteration that consists of multiple overprinted phases. 

Distinguishing between the individual phases will take considerable study on a microscopic scale. 

The country rocks and alkali intrusive rocks exhibit pervasive green-schist facies metamorphism and 

alteration, probably the result of burial. This manifests as chlorite, calcite, and pyrite in the 

intermediate volcanic rocks, pyritization of the banded iron formation, and sericite-pyrite alteration 

within the alkali intrusive associated rocks.  

Studies conducted as a part of the exploration work carried out from the fall of 2009 and the 

winter/spring of 2010 show there is evidence of early alteration phases. These probably resulted 

from magmatic hydrothermal fluids associated with porphyry gold mineralization and the associated 

epithermal/mesothermal style gold mineralization. This occurs as potassic and phyllic/sericitic 

alteration: K-feldspar, biotite, and muscovite (sericite), respectively, and is nearly pervasive in the 

alkali intrusive rocks and surrounding country rocks. Regional metamorphism has subsequently 

altered the primary hydrothermal mineral assemblages, but textures have been preserved with the 

exception of areas of high strain (e.g., northwest trending shear zones).  

Advanced argillic alteration appears throughout the trachyte intrusive and occurs in some of the late 

stage lamprophyre dikes though on a small scale. It is difficult to assess at what stage argillic 

alteration occurs, but it appears to define an envelope around the Portage zone potassic-

alteration/mineralization, suggesting an origin more in keeping with zoned alteration associated with 

epithermal-style porphyry intrusive hosted gold deposits. 

6.5 Mineralization 

 Porphyry Style Mineralization 

The main intrusive complex appears to contain many of the characteristics of alkaline, porphyry-style 

mineralization associated with diatreme breccias (e.g., Cripple Creek, Colorado). Direct comparison 

with drill core from the two sites shows a number of consistent textures and styles of mineralization. 

A recent observation made from drilling, combined with the airborne magnetic survey, shows the 

potentially economic gold mineralization is coincident with an unexplained geophysical anomaly. 

This style of mineralization is characterized by the Portage zone and portions of the East Extension 

zone where mineralization is hosted by diatreme breccia in aphanitic trachyte. It is suspected the 

ductile shearing and brittle faulting have played a significant role in redistributing structurally 

controlled blocks of the mineralized rock. Yet confirmed is a form of porphyry style alteration zoning 

consisting of an outer zone of phyllic (sericite) dominant alteration with narrow zones of advanced 

argillic alteration characterized by illite and kaolinite, and a core zone of intense potassic alteration 

characterized by biotite and K-feldspar.  

Multi-element analysis conducted during the 1992 program on the Portage zone, combined with gold 

assays, gave the first indication of the style of mineralization at Springpole. Diamond drilling in the 

winter of 2010 revealed a more complex alteration with broader, intense zones of potassic alteration

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

replacing the original rock mass with biotite and pyrite. The expected alteration zone envelopes or 

shells are very difficult to define due to complex sheared geometry and poorly defined contact zones 

of the deposit. In the core area of the deposit where fine grained disseminated gold mineralization 

occurs with biotite, the primary potassic alteration mineral, gold, displays a good correlation with 

potassium/rubidium. 

 Lode Gold Mineralization 

The intrusion of the trachyte complex into the volcanic pile, as well as the chemical and siliciclastic 

sedimentary rocks in a near surface environment, produced mesothermal to epithermal style lode 

vein mineralization. The difference between mesothermal and epithermal mineralization regimes is 

the temperature and pressure of the mineralizing fluids.  

Higher temperature (mesothermal) fluids would have existed within the emplaced intrusive, 

associated with the diatreme breccias, and in the immediately adjacent wall rock/country rocks. In 

the porphyry intrusive, and at the contact between intrusive and wall rock in the East Extension 

zone, and localized within the Main zone, mesothermal style quartz-biotite-calcite-sulfide veins with 

occasional tourmaline are observed with occasional coarse, visible gold.  

Further from the intrusive complex and wall rock contact zones, where meteoric fluids have a greater 

influence, epithermal style vein textures and mineralization styles dominate. These consist of banded 

to sucrosic quartz-calcite veins with a lower temperature mineral assemblage including sericite, 

minor biotite, possible adularia, calcite, dolomite and ankerite; here gold-silver and tellurium alloys 

dominate including electrum and gold-silver tellurides. 

 Gold Remobilization during Metamorphism 

As evidenced from the high degree of deformation, both ductile and brittle—in the form of isoclinal 

folding, ductile shear zones with protomylonite and blastomylonite textures, and brittle fault 

textures— the Springpole Prospect has been subjected to alteration and metamorphism. These 

processes alone have remobilized gold in epithermal quartz veins that were the principal motivation 

for exploring Springpole in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when shear zone hosted gold deposits 

were the targets of choice in the Red Lake area.

7 Deposit Types 

Mineralization at the Springpole Gold Project is dominated by large tonnage, low grade disseminated 

porphyry-style or epithermal-style gold mineralization associated with the emplacement of the alkali 

trachyte intrusive. Textures observed in the extensive repository of drill core appear to confirm the 

disseminated gold-silver-sulfide mineralization, the mesothermal to epithermal lode vein gold 

mineralization, and branded iron-formation hosted gold mineralization are all the result of the 

emplacement of multiple phases of trachyte porphyry and associated diatreme breccias, 

hydrothermal breccias, dikes and sills.  

The initial exploration on the property was conducted on the assumption the mineralization was a 

typical example of Archean mesothermal, sulfide-hosted lode gold type. While this model has not 

been completely ruled out, it has been replaced in favor of a high level emplacement porphyry 

model. Barron's thesis (1996) work presented strong evidence the gold and associated fluorite 

mineralization at Springpole are genetically related to the high level emplacement of a large, alkaline 

porphyry intrusive and breccia pipe complex. 

Barron considered the Springpole Complex to be the end product of magmatic fractionation 

processes and of fluids that evolved from magmatic to hydrothermal in the high level, sub-volcanic 

porphyry environment. These processes produced a low grade gold-porphyry-epithermal type 

deposit and associated high-grade veins and breccia pipes. 

Santa Fe geologists felt the nature of the mineralization at Springpole had many similarities with 

deposits of the Cripple Creek District, Colorado, including the Cresson Mine. Detailed mapping on 

the land based portions of the property by Santa Fe geologists showed that most, if not all, of the 

gold mineralization on the Springpole Gold Project is spatially associated with the feldspar porphyry 

diatreme dikes, veins, and diatreme breccia. The following is a brief description of this model in the 

Springpole area. 

7.1 Depositional Environment 

Based upon the abundance and size of epizonal trachyte porphyry intrusive masses and the 

widespread brecciation and alteration centered on the Portage zone, Barron (1996) considered this 

area to be the apex of a buried syenite stock. A high emplacement level for the Portage zone and 

surrounding porphyry is further supported by the lack of contact metamorphic effects in the enclosing 

country rocks. Trachyte clasts within the basal conglomerate overlying the intrusive complex indicate 

it was subjected to surface erosion.  

The rarity of trachyte clasts and their restriction to the base of the conglomerate unit would seem to 

indicate erosion over a short time interval. The lack of voluminous trachyte flows suggests there was 

no markedly positive volcanic edifice. Barron (1996) concluded that collectively these features 

suggested that the Portage zone and surrounding Main and East Extension zones existed as a small 

island of maar craters of low relief in a rapidly deepening shallow basin. 

This interpretation has its closest modern analogue in the Ladolam Gold Deposit, Lihir Island, Papua 

New Guinea. Mineralization at Lihir is believed to be less than 500,000 years old and is telescoped 

upon an earlier porphyry environment (Carman 2003) Deposition of gold is still an active process at 



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 24 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Ladolam as the hydrothermal system remains active. Host rocks at Ladolam can be divided into 

three groups (Carman 2003): 

 Mafic lavas composed of alkali basalt, porphyritic trachybasalt, trachyandesite, and rare trachyte 

and phonolite;  

 Alkali intrusions that are composed of multi-phase porphyry stocks with the most voluminous 

phase being biotite monzonite; and   

 Ladolam Breccia Complex that is composed of porphyry breccias and volcanic breccias. 

Porphyry breccias are dominantly monzonite composition and occur as poorly sorted, massive, 

matrix supported breccias with some rounding of clasts caused by magmatic milling; the clasts are 

supported by a cement of altered rock flour and anhydrite. The volcanic breccias are massive, 

moderately to poorly sorted, rock flour matrix supported breccias containing mafic clasts. 

Mineralization/alteration at Ladolam can also be sub-divided into three broad phases: 

 Biotite-orthoclase-anhydrite ± magnetite with minor copper-gold-molybdenum disseminated 

porphyry mineralization and veinlets; 

 Refractory sulfide-gold mineralization associated with pervasive adularia-pyrite (leucoxene-illite) 

alteration near surfacethat comprises the bulk of the near surface bulk mineable mineralized 

material; and 

 Quartz-calcite-adularia-pyrite-marcasite ±electrum stockwork veins. 

If the Ladolam Gold deposit is accepted as a reasonable genetic analogue to the Springpole deposit, 

then the following genetic model can be applied. This model is adapted from Barron's thesis (1996), 

Zabev's genetic summary (2004), and the genetic model of Armstrong et al. (2006), as well as 

observations made during the 2009 through 2012 diamond drilling programs. 

 Springpole Genetic Model 

The follow list summarizes the genetic model of Springpole Gold Project area: 

 Intrusion into the lower crust of parental alkaline primitive and anhydrous magma slightly 

enriched in incompatible elements including fluorine. 

 Fractionation at depth, precipitation of hornblende and apatite as early crystalline phases. The 

magma becomes increasingly anhydrous. Gold is retained in the melt. 

 Diapiric uprise from 4 to 8 km levels into hydrous wall rock with the apex of the magma chamber 

at <2 km depth. Continued fractionation producing an increasingly fluorine-rich melt. Feldspar of 

extreme composition is precipitated and the lowered solidus allows emplacement of porphyry 

dykes and sills to very high crustal levels. 

 High diffusivities and convection promotes water partitioning from wall rock into magma.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 The magma is quickly saturated and the sudden pressure is released (possibly from venting) 

prompting the immiscible separation of fluorine and carbon dioxide-rich phases, which escapes 

to high structural levels. Breccia pipes with rock fluorite and rounded clasts indicating turbulent 

fluidized and erosional vertical emplacement. 

 Fluid pressures generate dyke offshoots. 

 Fluorine escapes from brecciated wall-rock causing biotization or fluoritization of breccia and 

wall rock. Ultimately, the fluorine-water-carbon dioxide vapors condense, resulting in the 

precipitation of fluorite and calcite. Magmatic gold-rich fluids permeate the breccia and 

surrounding porphyry, depositing porphyry style, disseminated, pyritic mineralization. The 

fractures along the margins of breccia pipes acts as preferred sites for later deposition of quartz, 

electrum and tellurides. 

 Intrusion of a series of lamprophyre and carbonatite dikes, sills and veinlets—due to the intensity 

of deformation. 

 The complex is then buried by conglomerates derived from the complex and other areas 

(Devaney 2001b). 

 Continued intense deformation and associated metamorphism manifesting as folding, strike-slip 

faulting and shearing, coupled with regional green schist metamorphism of the region obscures 

primary textures and likely leads to some (possibly minor) degree of precious metal 

remobilization.

9.3 Winter 2008 Drill Program 

The winter 2008 program comprised seven core holes totalling 2,452 m and was designed to focus 

on step-out drilling to test the strike and down-dip potential of the new sedimentary hosted, semi-

massive sulfide environment. The first 1 km of strike potential for the sedimentary hosted semi-

massive sulfide environment has now been tested at a vertical depth of between 100 and 200 m. 

The results of the 2008 drilling program were inconclusive and did not return any gold intersections 

comparable to BL07-383. The sedimentary hosted gold target horizon is believed to continue for at 

least 7 additional km beyond the area tested. 

Table 9.3 summarizes the 2008 drilling program and Table 9.4 summarizes the significant 

intersections from the drilling campaign.

9.4 2010 Drill Program  

Winter 2010 drilling operations began on February 17th with mobilization of two Longyear 38 drills 

from Boart-Longyear International's (BLI) base in Red Lake. Drilling commenced on February 23, 

2010. A total of six diamond drill holes (SP10-001 thru SP10-006) were drilled for a total of 1,774.5 

m of HQ drilling (Figure 9.2). A summary of the 2010 drilling can be found in Table 9.5. 

BLI pulled out of the drill program and demobilized the drills on March 10, 2010, citing critical ice 

thickness problems with the access ice road to Springpole camp from the South Bay Mine landing. In 

doing so, BLI failed to complete drill holes SP10-005 and SP10-006, and both holes ended in altered 

and mineralized rock. Significant intercepts of the 2010 drill program are listed in  

Table 9.6. 

Drilling was suspended during the ice break-up on Springpole Lake and Birch Lake as the project 

has no land access route. Rodren Drilling Ltd of Winnipeg, Manitoba, was awarded the drilling 

contract in spring 2010 and mobilization of two Boyles 37 drills to the project site by helicopter began 

in June 2010. Drilling commenced on July 5, 2010, and ended on October 17, 2010. A total of 

8,664.2 m of HQ core drilling was completed in 23 drill holes, averaging 44.23 m of drilling per 24-

hour shift, including time for moving the drill between drill sites.

9.5 2011 Drill Program 

The 2011 drill program totaled 28,750 m in 80 diamond core holes and drill hole data are illustrated 

in Figure 9.3 and summarized in Table 9.7. Five of the diamond core holes were drilled for the 

purpose of metallurgical testing. All these holes (SP11-061, -065, -066, -069 and -090) were twins of 

previously drilled holes. The core obtained from SP11-061, -065 and -069 was not sampled in order 

to send the whole core for metallurgical testing. The drill core from SP11-066 and -090 was 

quartered and one-quarter was sent to SGS's Red Lake laboratory for assaying. The remaining 

three-quarters were sent to SGS's Lakefield metallurgical laboratory facility along with the whole 

cores. Results from the metallurgical testing are discussed in Section 12. 

Table 9.8 summarizes the significant gold and silver intercepts from the 2011 diamond core drilling 

program.

9.6 2012 Drill Program 

The 2012 drill program commenced on January 18, 2012, using the two Boyles 37 from Rodren and 

one discovery EF-50 drills from the 2011 program. Three Discovery LF-75 drills, mobilized to the 

project via the winter road, were also used. The drill program began in-filling the Portage zone based 

upon results of the 2011 drill program. The goal was to in-fill areas where inferred mineral resource 

had been defined in the February 2012 mineral resource update and to expand the mineral resource 

area to the southeast.  

The 2012 drill program totaled 38,069 m in 87 diamond core holes. The drill hole data are illustrated 

in Figure 9.4 and summarized in Table 9.9. Significant drill intersections from the 2012 drilling 

program are summarized in Table 9.10.

9.7 Drill Collar Surveying 

All historic holes drilled prior to 2010 were surveyed using various earth projections, either 

NAD27 (North American Datum 1927) Canada, WGS or NAD83 projections. In September 2006, 

W.J. Bowman Ltd of Dryden, Ontario, surveyed 275 historic drill hole collars from collar numbers 

BL-1 thru BL-373. For the purposes of inclusion in the data set for 3-D modelling, all the historic 

collar locations were converted to the UTM WGS84 projection. 

For the 2007 and 2008 drill programs, the drill hole collars were located and surveyed using a 

handheld GPS and recorded in UTM NAD27 Canada projection. For the purposes of this report 

all the collar survey information has been converted to WGS84 and field checked against collar 

locations using handheld Trimble GeoXH DGPS. 

The 2010 to 2012 drill hole collars were initially surveyed using handheld GPS devices. During 

the initial phases of the offshore 2010 drill program, drill hole collars on the lake ice were 

surveyed by handheld, real-time differential GPS with an average accuracy of 4 to 5 m and 

recorded in UTM NAD27 Canada projection. On-shore drill holes were initially located with 

handheld GPS and once the drill hole was complete, the hole location was temporarily marked; 

subsequently, the collars were surveyed using a Trimble GeoXH handheld DGPS device with an 

external antenna giving submetre (~10 cm) location accuracy. 

For the offshore 2011 and 2012 drill program, with drills mounted on barges, the drill sites were 

marked by floating buoy and located using the Trimble GeoXH from a boat. All onshore drill 

collars were located and subsequently surveyed using the Trimble GeoXH. At the beginning of 

the winter 2011 drill program, the UTM WGS84 projection was adopted as the standard for 

surveying drill collars and others surface landmarks. All previously recorded UTM measurements 

were converted accordingly. 

All drill site locations for inclined drill holes, onshore or offshore on the ice, were marked using 

two to four painted laths aligned along strike either side of the proposed drill hole location. These 

laths were used as fore- and back-sights for setting the drill location and orientation. Inclination of 

the drill hole was checked on the drill head, prior to commencing drilling, using either a Brunton 

compass or inclinometer accurate to half of one degree.

9.8 Oriented Core Surveying 

Oriented core measurements were collected from a total of 44 drill holes. Oriented core is used to 

evaluate the structural geology by allowing the geologists to measure the real angular 

relationships, as opposed to apparent angles. The tool used was the ACT 2 from Reflex 

Technologies. This system is fully digital, using infra-red and digital technology to make 

measurements easier to record in the field by the drill crew. There were significant problems 

encountered during the winter 2011 drill program due to tool failures. Some oriented core 

information was collected, but too little to be of widespread use.  

Where down-hole poor ground conditions were encountered, the oriented core tool proved to be 

of little value due to the incompetent nature of intensely altered and mineralized rock. Wherever 

competent rock was encountered, oriented core data were collected. 

9.9 Down-Hole Surveying 

All drill holes during the 2010 drill program were surveyed using a Reflex Technologies single EZ-

Shot or EZ-Trax down-hole survey system. Drill holes were surveyed once completed – this 

procedure was used because of the chance that bad ground conditions encountered in the drill 

holes increased the risk of cave-in when pulling the drill string backwards to conduct a survey. 

Cave-in can result in increased cost due to time spent reaming the drill hole clean back to the 

bottom, or from the possibility of sticking the drill string, causing loss of drilling tools. The 

presence of magnetite in banded iron formation and relatively unaltered trachyte or greenstone 

caused problems with respect to azimuth readings and also the azimuth of the drill traces. This 

required many repetitions of the down-hole survey readings, which in some cases resulted in an 

inability to record consistent data. 

For the 2011 and 2012 programs, the Reflex Down-Hole Gyro survey system was adopted with 

the EZ-Trax or EZ-Shot down-hole survey tools as back up. The Reflex Gyro is built around a 

digital micro-gyro, which consists of a silicon sensor chip and an integrated circuit assembled in a 

ceramic (non-magnetic) package. The gyro provides directional data (azimuth and dip) at any 

interval from inside the drill rods. This system is used to provide azimuth and inclination data in 

rocks with strong magnetic fields, because the gyros operate independently of the earth's 

magnetic field. The system also records ambient temperature as well as collecting basic gravity 

measurements. The gyro system was successfully applied to the majority of the 2011 and 2012 

drill programs.  

Data recorded from the down-hole surveys were incorporated into 3-D planning and modelling. 

9.10 Drilling Pattern and Density 

The overall drill pattern approximate a 50 m grid along the long axis of the Portage zone and 

about 45 to 65 m spacing down the dip of the mineralized zone. SRK is of the opinion that the drill 

spacing and density is appropriate for this type of deposit and style of mineralization.

10 Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security 

10.1 Core Drilling Sampling 

Detailed descriptions of the drill core were carried out under the supervision of a senior geologist, 

a member in good standing of the APGO (Association of Professional Geologists of Ontario) and 

AIPG (American Institute of Professional Geologists). The core logging was carried out on-site in 

a dedicated core logging facility. Drill log data were recorded onto paper logs that were later 

scanned and digitized.  

Core was laid out 30 to 40 boxes at a time. First, the core was photographed in 15 m batches 

prior to logging or sampling. This is followed by a geotechnical log that records quantitative and 

qualitative engineering data including detailed recovery data and rock quality designation. Any 

discrepancies between marker blocks and measured core length were addressed and resolved at 

this stage. The core was then marked up for sampling.  

For the 2010 and 2011 drill programs, all the drill core intervals were sampled using sample 

intervals of 1 m. During the 2012 drilling program, Gold Canyon changed its standard sample 

length from 1 to 2 m lengths. However, in zones of poor recovery, 1.5 or 3 m samples were 

sometimes collected. Samples over the standard sample length were typically half core samples 

and whole core was generally only taken in intervals of poor core recovery across the sampled 

interval. Sampling marks were made on the core and sample tickets were stapled into the core 

boxes at the beginning of each sample interval. Quality control samples were inserted into the 

sample stream.  

Inserting quality control samples involved the addition of certified blanks, certified gold standards, 

and field and laboratory duplicates. Field duplicates were collected by quartering the core in the 

sampling facility on-site. Laboratory duplicates were collected by splitting the first coarse reject 

and crushing and then generating a second analytical pulp. Blank, standards and duplicates 

made up 10% of the total sample stream. Sample tickets were marked blank, field or laboratory 

duplicate, or standard, and a sample tag was stapled into the core box within the sample stream.  

Geological descriptions were recorded for all core recovered. Separate columns in the log allow 

description of the lithology, alteration style, intensity of alteration, relative degree of alteration, 

sulphide percentage, rock colour, vein type, and veining density. A separate column was 

reserved for written notes on lithology, mineralization, structure, vein orientations/relations etc. 

The header page listed the hole number, collar coordinates, final depth, start/end dates, and the 

name of the core logging geologist.  

 Core Sampling, Handling and Chain-of-Custody 

Following the logging and core marking procedures described above, the core was passed to the 

sampling facility. Core sampling was performed by experienced sampling technicians from 

Ackewance Exploration & Services of Red Lake, Ontario, and quality control was maintained 

through regular verification by on-site geologists. Core was broken, as necessary, into 

manageable lengths. Pieces were removed from the box without disturbing the sample tags, were

cut in half lengthwise with a diamond saw, and then both halves were carefully repositioned in the 

box. When a complete hole was processed in this manner, one half was collected for assay while 

the other half remained in the core box as a witness. The remaining core in the boxes was then 

photographed at 51 cm (20 inch) intervals. All logs and photographs were then submitted to the 

senior geologist/project manager for review and were archived. Data were backed up. 

The sampling technician packed one half of the split core sample intervals into transparent vinyl 

sample bags that were sequentially numbered to match the sample number sequences in the 

sample tag booklets used by the core-logging geologists. The numbered, blank portion of the 

triplicate sample tag was placed in the bag with the sample; the portion was marked with the 

sample interval remained stapled into the bottom of the core box at the point where the sample 

interval begins. Sample bags were then sealed with plastic tags. Sealed sample bags were 

packed into rice sacks five samples at a time. All sacks were individually labeled with the name of 

the company, number of samples contained therein, and the number sequence of the samples 

therein. Sacks were assigned sequential numbers on a per shipment basis. A project geologist 

then checked the sample shipment and creates a shipping manifest for the sample batch. A copy 

was given to the project manager and a copy was sent along with the sample shipment. A copy of 

the sample shipment form was also sent via e-mail to the analytical laboratory.  

The project geologist prepared the sample submission form for the assay laboratory. This form 

identifies the number of sample sacks as well as the sequence of sample numbers to be 

submitted. Due to the remote location, the shipment was then loaded on to a plane or helicopter 

and flown direct to Red Lake where representatives of the commercial analytical laboratory met 

the incoming flight and took the samples to the laboratory by pickup truck.  

Once at the laboratory, a manager checked the rice sacks and sample numbers on the 

submission form. The laboratory then split the received sample manifest into batches for analysis, 

assigned a work order to the batch, and sent a copy of the mineral analysis acknowledgement 

form to the project manager. 

Aluminum tags embossed with the hole number, box number, and box interval (from/to) were 

prepared and stapled onto the ends of each core box. Core boxes were cross-stacked on pallets 

and then moved to on-site storage.  

10.2 Sample Security 

Core samples collected at the drill site were held in closed core boxes sealed with fiber tape; at 

various times of day, camp staff collected the core boxes that were then delivered to the core 

logging facility. All core logging, sampling and storage took place at the Springpole Gold Project 

site. Following the logging and marking of core (described in the preceding section), all core 

preparation and sampling was performed by technicians from Ackewance of Red Lake, Ontario, 

under the supervision of the project manager. All on-site sampling activities were directly 

supervised by the project manager.

10.3 Sample Preparation and Analytical Procedures  

 Analytical Laboratories 

All primary assay work since the 2010 drill program has been performed by SGS Laboratories in 

Red Lake (gold), Ontario and Don Mills (silver and multi-element) in Toronto, Ontario. The SGS 

Red Lake and Don Mills facilities are certified and conform to requirements CAN-P-1579 and 

CAN-P-4E (ISO/IEC 17025:2005). Certification is accredited for precious metals including gold 

and silver and 52 element geochemical analyses. 

 Analytical Procedures 

All samples received by SGS Red Lake were processed through a sample tracking system that is 

an integral part of the company's laboratory information management system. This system 

utilizes bar coding and scanning technology that provides complete chain of custody records for 

every stage in the sample preparation and analytical process.  

Samples were dried, and then crushed to 70% of the sample passing 2 mm (-70 mesh). A 250 g 

sample was split off the crushed material, and pulverized to 85% passing 75 micron (-200 mesh). 

A 30 g split of the pulp was used for gold fire assay and a 2 g split was used for silver analysis. 

Crushing and pulverizing equipment was cleaned with barren wash material between sample 

preparation batches and, where necessary, between highly mineralized samples. Sample 

preparation stations were also equipped with dust extraction systems to reduce the risk of sample 

contamination. Once the gold assay was complete, a pulp was sent to the SGS Toronto facility for 

silver and possibly for multi-element geochemical analysis.  

As part of the standard internal quality control procedures used by the laboratory, each batch of 

75 Springpole core samples included four blanks, four internal standards, and eight duplicate 

samples. In the event that any reference material or duplicate result would fall outside the 

established control limits, the sample batches would be re-assayed.  

Pulps and rejects of the samples were stored by SGS at its Red Lake facility at the request of 

Gold Canyon. 

 Gold, Silver and Multi-Element Analysis 

Prepared samples were analyzed for gold by fire assay with atomic absorption finish. Samples 

returning assays in excess of 10g/t gold are re-analyzed with a gravimetric finish.  

Prepared pulp samples shipped from SGS Red Lake to SGS Toronto are analyzed for silver by 

three-acid digestion with atomic absorption finish. 

During the winter 2010 program, prepared samples were analyzed for 52 elements by acid 

digestion (3:1 HCl: HNO3). The list of elements is included in Table 10.1.

10.4 Bulk Density Data  

Bulk density was obtained for select core samples using the paraffin wax method at SGS 

Lakefield Research Ltd. laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario. The bulk density of a sample is the 

weight of the sample divided by the volume of the sample including voids. 

The procedure as applied by SGS metallurgical laboratory was as follows: 

1) Oven-dry the samples and then cool to room temperature. 

2) Label and weigh each sample in grams. 

3) Coat the sample with paraffin wax heated in a container immersed in boiling water.  

4) Repeatedly immerse the sample in the wax until completely sealed.  

5) Avoid heating the sample. 

6) Weigh the waxed sample and record. 

7) Weigh the waxed samples (g)by suspending in water and recording the displaced volume 

(mL) and the water temperature (ºC). 

8) Remove the wax by placing in boiling water, or freezing the core and chipping off if return of 

the sample is required.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Calculations: 

1) Weight of wax = (weight of sample + wax) – (weight of sample) 

2) Volume of wax = weight of wax /specific gravity (s.g.) of wax corrected for temperature. 

3) Volume of sample = (volume of sample + wax) – (volume of wax) 

4) Bulk density (t/m3) = weight of sample (g) / volume of sample (mL) 

5) Bulk Density (lb/ft3) = (t/m3) / 0.0160. 

Results from selected analysis of bulk density are summarized in Table 10.2 and discussed in 

Section 13.14 of the report.

10.5 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs 

 Pre-2007 QA/QC Program 

No documentation relating to sample handling and preparation or sample QA/QC documentation 

for the pre-2003 drilling were provided to SRK.  

The QA/QC procedures for 2003 through 2006 drilling totalling 105 drill holes and comprising 

12,956 assay intervals were summarily described by Armstrong et al. (2006). The reader is 

referred to this report for additional relevant descriptions.  



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 44 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

P&E Mining Consultants checked a total of 1,725 entries in the database against the original 

certificates. According to the report, "A few data entry errors were observed and corrected."; 

however, the total number of errors is not presented (Armstrong et al. 2006). 

The QA/QC program for 2003to 2007 consisted of: 

 Resubmission of approximately 10% of the sample pulps to a second laboratory (ALS 

Chemex); 

 Insertion of two commercial standard reference materials (standards submitted every 30th 

sample); and 

 Insertion of blanks. 

There were no field or bulk reject duplicates submitted. Also, no pulp duplicates were submitted 

to the primary laboratory.  

Due to the lack of detailed documentation, particularly for pre-2003 drilling, SRK elected to use 

the pre-2003 drilling only in estimating the proportionately minor East Extension and Camp 

zones. The Portage zone was estimated using only 2003 and later drill holes. The East Extension 

and Camp zones as now defined correspond to the deposits estimated by P&E in their 2006 

study (Armstrong, 2006),  

Also, because of the lack of documentation, the current estimates for the East Extension zone 

were restricted to the inferred resource category, although P&E classified these zones as 

measured, indicated, and inferred resources in their report (Armstrong, 2006), recommended that 

Gold Canyon continue the program of re-sampling and re-logging of the core for the pre-2007 

drilling with focus on the mineralized intervals, to replace the missing duplicate field and pulp 

duplicate including appropriate insertion of blanks and standards that would demonstrate 

compliance with current NI 43-101 standards. The drill hole density in these areas was more than 

adequate for generating resource categories above inferred if appropriate sample methodologies 

and duplicates samples were included with the results. 

 2007/2008 QA/QC Program 

A total of 18 drill holes were completed in 2007 and 2008 comprising a total of 1,374 assay 

intervals. These samples were assayed for gold only by the Accurassay Laboratories of Thunder 

Bay, Ontario. SRK checked a total of 137 samples representing 10% of the total against the 

original certificates. No errors were found. 

No program was set up for duplicates, standards, or blanks for this drilling program. The 

laboratory ran their own set of duplicates for internal monitoring purposes; however, that data 

were not available to SRK. 

  



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 45 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 2010 to 2012 QA/QC Program 

A total of 196 drill holes, comprising 76,875 m, were completed and assayed in time for inclusion 

into this study. The vast majority of these drill holes targeted the Portage zone. The drill hole 

samples generated by the 2010 to 2012 drill programs were assayed by SGS Red Lake and SGS 

Mineral Services of Toronto, Ontario.  

In 2010, Gold Canyon instituted a QA/QC program consisting of commercial standard reference 

materials for gold, and it instituted, consistent with current industry practice, blanks, field 

duplicates, and pulp duplicates. In addition, a "round robin" program was instituted in 2011 with 

ACT Labs of Red Lake, Ontario, that compared pulp re-assay results against the original SGS 

results for 469 samples.  

SGS conducted their own program of internal duplicate analysis as well. The results of this 

program were also analyzed by SRK as a valuable comparison against the "blind" pulp duplicates 

submitted. Results are presented in Appendix C.  

A summary of the blanks and standards submissions are presented below: 

 A total of 1,336 field duplicates were submitted for gold. 

 A total of 1,359 field duplicates were submitted for silver. 

 A total of 1,303 lab or pulp duplicates were submitted for gold. 

 A total of 1,302 pulp duplicates were submitted for silver. 

 A total of 1,377 commercial gold standards were submitted from a set of 14 different 

commercial standards.  

 No commercial standards were submitted for silver. 

 A total of 1,371 blanks were submitted with the gold assays. 

 A total of 1,006 blanks were submitted with the silver assays. 

The total submissions for gold duplicates, standards and blanks was 5,387; 10.1% of the samples 

assayed for gold. The total submissions for silver duplicates, and blanks was 3,667 or 7% of the 

total samples assayed for silver. 

10.6 SRK Comments 

In the opinion of SRK, the sampling preparation, security and analytical procedures used by Gold 

Canyon for gold analyses are acceptable but not fully consistent with generally accepted industry 

best practices because of the lack of standard reference material for silver. However, because of 

the relative low economic value of silver, SRK concludes that the assay data are adequate for 

use in resource estimation. SRK recommends that Gold Canyon establishes a written QA/QC 

protocol for the acceptance of assay batches with respect to the performance of standard 

reference material, duplicates and blanks. SRK also recommends that Gold Canyon procure 

some standard reference material for silver before the beginning of the next drilling campaign.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

11 Data Verification 

Independent data verification was carried out by P&E and described in their technical report 

(Armstrong et. al 2006) for data collected from 2003 through 2006. 

Of the 18 drill holes completed in 2007 and 2008, comprising a total of 1,374 assay intervals 

analyzed for gold, SRK checked a total of 137 samples representing 10% of the total against the 

original certificates. No errors were found. 

A total of 3,135 assay values for gold and 3,161 assay values for silver in the database were 

compared against the original protected PDF assay certificates submitted by SGS Red Lake. 

These totals represent 10.1% and 10.4% of the total number of assays for gold and silver, 

respectively.  

Of the original assay values checked against certificates, the focus was on values material to any 

resource estimate, either higher-grade intervals or very low grade intervals in proximity to higher-

grade intervals. The average grade of gold samples verified was 2.05 g/t gold. The average grade 

of silver samples checked was 8.27 g/t silver.  

Only two errors were found for gold: 

 The gold value of sample interval SP10-028 from 433 m to 436 m (sample number 8287) 

found to have an entered value of 5.96 g/t gold against a value on the assay certificate of 

9.00 g/t gold.  

 The gold value of sample interval SP11-076 from 69 to 70 m (sample number 14583) having 

the value of 0.45 oz/t incorrectly placed in the parts per billion column. 

No errors were found with respect to silver assays. 

This represents an error rate of 0.064% in gold assays and an error rate of 0.0% in silver assays. 

This error rate is well within acceptable industry standards. 

11.1 Verifications by SRK 

 Site Visit 

SRK carried out visits to the Springpole site on February 10 and 11, 2012, and again on August 8 

and 9, 2012. During the site visits, core logging procedures were reviewed. Several sections of 

core from the Portage, Camp, and East Extension zones were examined. Sampling procedures 

and handling were observed. The deposit geology, alteration, and core recovery data were 

observed for the Portage zone. SRK was fully assisted during the site visit by Gold Canyon 

personnel and was given full access to data during the site visit. Gold Canyon field personnel 

were very helpful and fully cooperative during both site visits.  

During the site visit, SRK re-logged mineralized sections of drill core from the Springpole deposit 

and checked geological units against the recorded written logs. Down-hole survey data entered in 

the digital database were checked against data entered on paper logs at the site and no errors 



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 47 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

were noted. Drill site locations could not be verified as most drill sites are situated under 

Springpole Lake, but SRK did observe two drill platforms drilling on the lake during the visit. 

 Verifications of Analytical Quality Control Data 

As part of the mineral resource estimation process, SRK reviewed the QA/QC data collected by 

Gold Canyon, reviewed the procedures in place to assure assay data quality, and verified the 

assay database against original assay certificates provided directly to SRK by SGS Red Lake, the 

assay laboratory. A total of 53,431 gold assays, 46% of the assay data, were checked against 

original assay certificates. No significant database errors were identified. About 143 minor 

rounding errors were observed. None of the rounding errors are deemed material or of any 

significance to the mineral resource estimate presented in this report.  

 Independent Verification Sampling  

A total of three mineralized quarter core samples were collected during the February 2012 site 

visit. The intent of the sampling program was only to determine if gold did occur in concentrations 

similar to what had been reported by Gold Canyon. Assays from the samples collected by SRK 

are presented in Table 11.1. The re-sampling agrees with the original Gold canyon sampling.

12 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

To date, three metallurgical testwork programs have been completed on Springpole material: 

 Lakefield Research, Lakefield, Ontario (1989)—a preliminary program of whole feed leaching 

on two samples. 

 SGS Mineral Services, Vancouver, British Columbia (2011)—a follow up program of leaching 

on eight samples. 

 SGS Lakefield, Lakefield, Ontario (2012/2013)—comminution, whole feed leaching, 

flotation/leaching on six samples. 

Reports were issued at the completion of all programs and are listed in the References 

(Section 27). This section discusses the testwork completed during these programs, as well as 

expected plant performance on the selected process flowsheet. 

12.1 Lakefield Research 1989 

In 1989, preliminary metallurgical testing on two types of material from the Portage zone was 

completed by Lakefield Research on behalf of Goldfields Canadian Mining Ltd. 

The purpose of this testwork was to investigate gold extraction by direct, whole feed cyanidation 

at different feed sizes, as well as carbon in leach (CIL) extraction at fine grinds on two composite 

samples produced from core intersections received from Goldfields. 

 Sample Preparation 

The two samples of core received were described as typical Portage zone (Sample 1) and 

intensely broken altered (Sample 2). Lakefield prepared composites for their test program from 

these two samples, labelled Composite A and Composite B, respectively. 

The combined mass of sample received was 34 kilograms. For each composite, two 2.5 kg 

charges of "as received" material were riffled out and the remainder was crushed to -10 mesh or -

2 mm. A head assay sample was riffled out and the remaining sample was made into test 

charges. 

 Head Analysis 

Head analyses for the two composite samples are shown in Table 12.1. The precious metal 

grades were moderate to low and the sulphur levels relatively high, depending on gold 

association which may present challenges to cyanide leaching. Other elements analyzed did not 

raise major concerns.

 Cyanidation Testwork 

The leaching work was divided into "as-received" material, medium crush, fine grind, and fine 

grind with carbon present to identify any preg-robbing issues. Both composites were tested 

equally. 

As Received Cyanidation Tests 

Five kilogram splits of as-received Composite A and Composite B samples were pulped in a 10 L 

pail to 50% solids and leached with 2 g/L NaCN solution at a pH of 10.5 to 11, controlled with lime 

addition. The coarse samples were manually mixed periodically for 96 hours with intermediate 

solution samples taken at 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours with the results shown in Table 12.2.

The dimensions of the core samples were reported to be about 25 mm. Recovery on such 

material was relatively low, 35% and 45% after 96 hours. Sample B-1 showed a much higher 

head assay compared to the composite. 

Medium Crush Cyanidation Tests 

The sample splits were reduced to -10 mesh (-2 mm) and leached with 2 g/L NaCN solution at pH 

of 10.5 to 11 with controlled lime addition (Table 12.3). Duplicate tests were conducted at 50% 

solids in bottles rolled for 24 hours with intermediate solution samples taken at 2, 4, 8, and 

16 hours.

Recovery on the medium (-2 mm) material improved to between 63% and 66% after 24 hours. 

Cyanide consumption was relatively low at 0.26 to 0.36 kg/t.

Fine Grind Cyanidation Tests 

The sample splits were then ground to -200 mesh (75 µm) and leached with 2 g/L NaCN solution 

at a pH of 10.5 to 11 with controlled lime addition. Duplicate tests were conducted in bottles rolled 

for 24 hours with intermediate solution samples taken at 2, 4, 8, and 16 hours (Table 12.4).

Leach recovery on the A samples improved further to between 80% and 83% when ground to 

93.5% passing 75 µm. This is estimated to be an 80% passing (P80) size of 50 to 65 µm. Leach 

recovery on the lower B samples was better at around 77%, but still lower than the A samples. 

This was due to the coarser grind of 86% passing 75 µm and lower head grade. Cyanide 

consumption was significantly higher in all instances at between 0.8 to 1.0 kg/t compared with the 

-2 mm tests. 

Fine Grind Carbon-in-Leach Tests 

The sample splits were ground to -75 µm and leached with 1 or 2 g/L NaCN solution and 10 g/L 

pre-attritioned carbon at a pH of 10.5 to 11 with controlled lime addition. The tests were 

conducted at 50% solids in bottles rolled for 48 hours with intermediate solution samples taken at 

8 and 24 hours (Table 12.5).

The results of the CIL tests show no significant improvement over direct cyanidation on 

Composites A and B. Composite B extraction was lower than the A samples once again due to 

the coarser grind and lower head grade. Cyanide consumption was similar to the cyanidation 

tests at between 0.8 and 2 kg/t. 

12.2 SGS Mineral Services 2011 

During the first half of 2011, SGS Mineral Services in Vancouver, British Columbia, conducted a 

metallurgical test program on eight samples from the Springpole Gold Project. The primary 

objective was to conduct scoping level cyanide leaching tests on a range of material from the 

Springpole property.

The samples were stage crushed to -2 mm, blended and riffled into 1 kilogram charges for 

cyanidation bottle leach tests. A 150 g sample was also split from each sample and submitted for 

gold, silver, arsenic, iron, sulfur, and multi-element inductively coupled plasma (ICP) scan head 

analyses. Due to the small amount of Gold Canyon Met 1 sample, only 900 g grind calibration 

and bottle cyanidation charges were prepared. 

 Head Analysis 

Head analyses for the eight samples are shown in Table 12.7.

Arsenic and antimony levels were low (except for Met 7 and 8) while the sulphur content of most 

samples was relatively high and, depending on gold association, may present challenges to 

cyanide leaching. Sample Met 5 was likely oxidized and clearly different in mineralogy.

 Fine Grind Whole Feed Leach Tests 

All samples were subjected to grind calibration to determine the time to achieve a P80 size of 65 

microns. It was noted that the Met 1 sample took a long time to filter, suggesting the presence of 

clay material that could impact negatively liquid/solid separation processes.

The summarized results of the gold cyanidation tests are shown in Table 12.9. On average the 

2010 samples yielded a leach extraction of 73% compared to 83% for samples generated during 

the 2011 drill program. The gold leach extraction after 24 hours for these eight samples averaged 

79% and in the range 67 to 89%. Gold kinetic curves are shown in Figure 12.1 with extraction 

virtually complete at 24 hours with this grind size.

SGS Mineral Services noted that all samples were amenable to cyanide leaching but appeared to 

fall into two groups. Samples Met 1, Met 3, Met 5 and Met 8 yielded gold leach extraction in 

excess of 80%, while samples Met 2, Met 4, Met 6 and Met 7 showed lower leach extractions 

around 70%. Further investigation would be required to understand the reasons behind certain 

samples being more refractory than others. It may be of relevance to note that, with the exception 

of Met 3, the samples that yielded higher leach extractions were from 2011 drill holes.

All samples were seen to be amenable to cyanide leaching except for Met 5. This sample had a 

low silver head grade, low sulphur analysis and relatively high antimony analysis. The sample 

was also observed to have a brownish color and likely oxidized. Silver leach extraction on the 

other seven samples ranged from 71 to 86%.

 Sample Preparation 

Five samples were taken from individual holes, twinned to earlier drill holes from 2010 and 2011. 

Three were from the Portage zone (two sulphides and one oxide) and one from each of the East 

Extension, Camp, and Main zones. It was decided to separate SP11-61 into low grade (LG) and 

high grade (HG) samples, bringing the total to six. Table 12.11 shows the hole IDs and intervals 

sampled.

SP11-69 206 511 150 Portage Zone 

SP11-90 10 124 50 Camp/Main Zone 

 

 Head Analysis 

Head assays showed the samples to be 3 to 4 g/t gold with 1 to 6 g/t silver and similar to the 

average grade of the resource. Sample 66 from the East Extension zone was much higher in gold 

at 12 g/t (Table 12.12). Sample 61 was much lower in sulphur but higher in arsenic and was later 

shown to be highly oxidized with iron sulphide minerals converted to oxides (similar to Met 5 from 

2011).

Duplicate screen metallic assays were performed at 150 mesh (106 µm) with the average results 

shown in Table 12.13. With the exception of the high grade 66 sample, most showed limited 

amounts of coarse gold, with only 1 to 5% present in the coarse fraction. 

Full ICP analysis was completed on the sample heads with no deleterious elements noted. 

A QEMSCAN Rapid Mineral Scan (RMS) was performed on the sample heads for the 

mineralogical assemblage. The main minerals are summarized in Table 12.14. Pyrite is the 

principal sulphide mineral in most of the samples with it converted to iron oxides in sample 61. 

Feldspar, mica and quartz are the most abundant host minerals.

 Material Hardness 

Bond Work Index (BWI) tests were completed on five samples at a closing screen size of 150 µm. 

The results showed the oxide sample 61 was very soft at 7 kWh/t while the others were moderate 

at 12 to 17 kWh/t, with SP11-66 being the hardest. 

With the primary grind size likely to be 80% passing 75 µm or finer, the specific energy 

requirements for both primary and secondary grinding need to be better defined with additional 

hardness testing on a number of samples from all areas of the Portage East Extension, Camp, 

and Main zones. 

 Gravity Recovery 

Gravity concentration was performed prior to leaching or flotation to determine the expected level 

of gravity recoverable gold in the samples. Grind P80 sizes varied between 56 and 160 µm with 3 

to 13% gravity recoverable gold for the lower grade samples (Table 12.15). The higher grade 

sample (SP11-66) achieved 48% gravity recoverable gold as was indicated in the screen 

metallics assay to contain a greater amount of coarse gold particles. 

Initial leaching and flotation testwork were conducted on gravity recovery tailing.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

A mineralogical study of the gold occurrence in the gravity concentrates was undertaken using 

the QEMSCAN Trace Mineral Search (TMS) mapping routine. The distribution of gold (and gold 

minerals) for each sample are shown in Figure 12.2. 

 
Figure 12.2: Gold Occurrence in Gravity Concentrates 

Between 89 and 343 gold grains were identified during the QEMSCAN TMS with the high grade 

sample 66 producing the largest number of observed grains. The two Portage zone samples (65 

and 69) showed gold was associated with petzite, a telluride mineral. Liberated gold grains were 

generally 20 µm in size while exposed gold grains were finer at <5 µm for the two Portage 

samples. Sample 69 showed 34% of the gold particles (only 89 observed) were locked in gangue.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

The very fine gold grain size for the Portage samples is strong evidence as to why the leach 

extractions are sensitive to grind size. 

 Gravity Tailing Leaching 

The gravity tailing from each sample was subjected to bottle roll, cyanide leaching at 1 and 2 g/L 

NaCN with/without the presence of pre-attritioned carbon over 48 hours. The results are 

summarized in Table 12.16. Similar to the results from earlier testwork, gold extractions varied 

from 70% to over 90% for the oxide sample 61. Carbon did not appear to improve the leach rates 

and the majority of the extraction was completed in 24 hours. The Portage samples (65 and 69) 

achieved around 70% gold extraction after 48 hours at the moderate grind size tested. Cyanide 

consumption was between 0.1 and 1.0 g/t, higher with carbon present and at higher cyanide 

concentrations. 

Silver extraction was also variable, not correlated with gold and averaged around 70% for 48 

hours. 

 Rougher Flotation 

Rougher flotation tests were completed on each sample to recover a pyrite concentrate that 

would then be subjected to cyanide leaching. As indications were that the gold was both fine-

grained and associated with pyrite, flotation concentration would allow the regrinding and 

leaching circuits to be smaller as they would treat only 20 to 30% of the mass. Table 12.15 

summarizes the results.

 Flotation Concentrate Leaching 

As the proportion of oxide material (similar to sample 61) in the Portage zone is relatively small, work 

continued on samples 65, 69 and 90 as being more representative of the deposit. 

Following gravity treatment, a rougher concentrate was recovered and reground to three different 

grind sizes (nominal P80 sizes of 65, 55, and 45 µm) prior to cyanide leaching. The results are 

summarized in Table 12.17. Unfortunately, the three regrind sizes tested did not differ significantly, 

and no clear relationship between extraction and concentrate regrind size was observed in the test 

results. 

At 1 g/L cyanide concentration, leach extractions of gold did not exceed 80% after 48 hours, even at 

below 50 µm grinds. Cyanide consumptions were more stable at 0.23 to 0.54 g/t. Silver extraction 

was steady at almost 80%, except for sample 90. 

 Whole Feed Intensive Leaching 

As an alternative to flotation concentration followed by leaching, whole feed leaching was tested 

without gravity pre-treatment. The two main Portage samples (65 and 69) were tested with the 

primary grind reduced from a nominal P80 size of 150 microns to below 70 µm with intensive leach 

conditions (high cyanide concentration, elevated temperature and dissolved oxygen) maintained for 

96 hours (Table 12.18 for results). 

The finer grind size achieved about 5% higher gold and 2% higher silver extractions. The higher 

cyanide, oxygen and temperature did not appear to improve leaching rates and test results indicated 

that most of the extraction was completed in 24 hours. 

Diagnostic leach tests were completed on the two Portage samples to better understand the gold 

occurrence and association in the feed (not gravity concentrate). The results are shown in Figure 

12.3 and indicate 72 to 75% of the gold was freely extractable by cyanide with a further 21% locked 

in sulphides (i.e., pyrite) at a grind size of 61 to 74 µm. 

 

 
Figure 12.3: Diagnostic Leach Gold Distribution 

These results confirm the whole feed leach extractions of around 70%. Finer grinding is needed to 

expose/liberate the gold particles from the sulphides and increase the extraction by up to 90%. The 

remaining gold was refractory in carbonates, oxides or silicates.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Due to the presence of telluride minerals identified in the gravity concentrate scan, thiosulphate 

leaching was performed on SP11-65 and SP11-69 as an alternative lixiviant. Initial tests showed 29 

and 39% gold extraction for the two samples. Follow up tests which included resin showed 29 and 

47% gold extraction after 24 hours with silver extractions of 58 and 52%, respectively. 

Alternate leaching agents were not considered further as the relationship between cyanide leach 

extraction and particle size was well defined in the 2012 testwork results. 

 Geochemical Analysis 

Whole rock, ICP and solid phase analysis were completed on a number of flotation tailings and leach 

residues and the content of the associated solutions was also analysed. 

Acid Base Accounting (ABA) was conducted as well as ageing tests over 28 days on the rougher 

flotation tailings. In general, the flotation tailings samples were not net acid generating as the 

sulphide minerals had been recovered to concentrate. The whole feed leach residues contained up 

to 16% sulphur and were net acid generating, with net to acid producing ratios (NP:AP) under 1. 

If the process flowsheet is whole feed leaching, it can be expected—based on analyses to date—

that the leach residues will be net acid generating. 

12.4 SGS Lakefield 2013 

Test results showed gravity recovery was beneficial for higher grade material and whole feed 

leaching was sensitive to grind size as the gold particles were either fine (<5 µm for the two Portage 

samples) or locked with pyrite or gangue. 

It was decided to re-test the two Portage samples without gravity recovery, at a very fine grind size 

and intensive leach conditions to see if gold extraction could be improved. As the Bond Work Index 

results suggested a relatively soft to moderate hardness, a primary grind of finer than 70 µm may 

prove to be economic if 85% or higher gold extraction was demonstrated. 

Following the fine grind leach tests, additional rougher flotation tests followed by ultrafine regrinding 

was investigated to see how the flotation concentrate leaching was influenced by particle size. 

 Fine Grind Leach Tests 

Both samples SP11-65 and SP11-69 were cyanide leached for 48 hours after being ground to a P80 

size of around 38 µm and 30 µm. Cyanide levels were maintained at 5 g/L, oxygen levels were 

elevated along with the slurry temperature using a heat jacket. The results of the four tests are 

summarized in Table 12.19. 

Compared to the earlier tests done on 61 to 74 micron feed, the 30 to 38 micron test results showed 

a 5 to 10% increase in 48 hour gold extraction. Grind size estimates were based on a laser-sizing 

method; therefore, subject to some error or variation due to the small sample size used.

The finer grinds resulted in higher cyanide consumptions with up to 2 kg/t for the -40 µm feed 

compared to 0.9 kg/t for -70 µm feed and 0.4 to 0.5 kg/t for similar grade samples tested in 2011 at 

lower cyanide concentrations. 

These results confirmed the sensitivity of leach extraction to grind size. However, such a fine primary 

grind size, higher cyanide consumption as well as detoxifying and handling the very fine leach 

residues may result in higher costs (and issues) associated with the higher gold recovery. It is 

recommended that finer grinding be considered in future trade-off studies on the Springpole Gold 

Project. 

 Rougher Flotation with Fine Grind Leach Tests 

With the higher extractions observed in the finely ground, whole feed leach results, additional tests 

were conducted using flotation to recover the sulphides and gold followed by fine regrinding and 

leaching of the concentrate. The earlier tests were not conclusive in the regrind size used and a 

regrind P80 size of 30 µm was targeted for these supplementary tests. 

Following an extended rougher flotation period on a primary grind P80 size of around 100 µm, a 

concentrate of 2.8 to 5 g/t gold was generated which recovered 32 to 35% of the mass. This was 

reground to a P80 size of around 26 µm, and leached under intensive conditions for 48 hours. This 

included 5 g/L NaCN and dissolved oxygen of 20 to 29 mg/L at room temperature (Table 12.20).

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

These results showed that, even with very fine regrinding, the overall gold recovery was 75 to 79% 

by concentrating the sulphides with flotation followed by leaching. Overall silver recovery was around 

80% with fine regrinding. 

The advantage of this flowsheet is the potentially acid-generating sulphides are concentrated in 25 to 

35% of the feed and can be handled easier than leaching all of the feed. The cyanide detoxification 

circuit can also be considerably smaller. 

However, whole feed leaching at a grind P80 size of 70 µm will achieve slightly better gold recovery 

compared to flotation plus fine regrinding ahead of leaching. The option of a finer primary grind size 

ahead of whole feed leaching will increase cyanide costs and make the leach residues more difficult 

to detox, thicken and possibly filter; however, should be investigated further in the future.

13 Mineral Resource Estimates 

13.1 Introduction 

The mineral resource statement presented herein represents the third mineral resource evaluation 

prepared for the Springpole Gold Project in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators' 

NI 43-101. 

The mineral resource model prepared by SRK considers 512 core boreholes drilled by previous 

owners of the property and drilled by Gold Canyon during the period of 2003 to 2012. The resource 

estimation work was completed by Dr. Gilles Arseneau, PGeo (APEGBC #23474), an appropriate 

independent qualified person as this term is defined in NI 43-101. The effective date of the resource 

statement is October 17, 2012. 

This section describes the resource estimation methodology and summarizes the key assumptions 

considered by SRK. In the opinion of SRK, the resource evaluation reported herein is a reasonable 

representation of the global gold and silver resources found in the Springpole Gold Project at the 

current level of sampling. The mineral resources were estimated in conformity with generally 

accepted CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices guidelines and 

are reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators' NI 43-101. Mineral 

resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no 

certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve. 

The database used to estimate the Springpole Gold Project mineral resources was audited by SRK. 

SRK is of the opinion that the current drilling information is sufficiently reliable to interpret with 

confidence the boundaries for porphyry gold mineralization and that the assay data are sufficiently 

reliable to support mineral resource estimation. 

GEMS (6.4) was used to construct the geological solids, prepare assay data for geostatistical 

analysis, construct the block model, estimate metal grades and tabulate mineral resources. The 

Geostatistical Software SAGE2001 was used for variography. 

13.2 Resource Estimation Procedures 

The resource evaluation methodology involved the following procedures: 

 Database compilation and verification, 

 Construction of wireframe models for the boundaries of the Springpole gold mineralization, 

 Definition of resource domains, 

 Data compositing and capping for geostatistical analysis and variography, 

 Block modelling and grade interpolation, 

 Resource classification and validation,

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 Assessment of "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" and selection of appropriate 

cut-off grades (COGs), and 

 Preparation of the mineral resource statement. 

13.3 Drill Hole Database 

The Springpole Gold Project currently consists of three separate mineralized zones: East Extension, 

Camp or Main and Portage. The Portage zone is by far the largest of the three and represents more 

than 90% of the stated resource.  

The entire Springpole database consists of 601 drill holes totalling 173,660 m. Of these, 89 drill 

holes totalling 27,808 m were discarded, 60 holes because of uncertainty relating to sampling 

methods and QA/QC, 27 holes because they were not drilled near the resource area, and 2 holes 

because assay results were not received at the time the resource was estimated  

Of the 571 post-1986 drill holes, only those dating from 2003 through 2012 (331 drill holes) have 

documentation supporting a level of data verification and QA/QC sampling and analysis consistent 

with current NI 43-101 standards. Consequently, different restrictions were placed on which data 

could be used in which domain. 

Due to the lack of detailed documentation—particularly for pre-2003 drilling and because of the 

apparent bias of the historical drilling in the Portage zone (Figure 13.1)—SRK decided to include the 

1986–2003 drilling only in estimating the proportionately minor East Extension and Camp zones. 

 

Figure 13.1: Comparison of Historic and Recent Drilling for the Portage Zone

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Consequently, because of the good agreement between the recent and old drilling for the Camp and 

East Extension zones (Figure 13.2), it was decided that all historic drilling from 1986 to present 

would be included for estimation of these two zones. However, due to the lack of appropriate 

documentation, the estimates for the East Extension zone were restricted to the inferred 

classification. The Portage zone was estimated using only 2003 and later drill holes. 

 

Figure 13.2 Comparison of Historic and Recent Drilling for the Camp and East Extension Zones 

 

13.4 Core Recovery 

Drill core recovery for both East Extension and Camp zones was generally very good with average 

recovery recorded as approximately 97%. For Portage, with areas of intense argillic and potassic 

alteration, core recovery was a much more significant issue, primarily affecting near surface intervals 

and intervals that appear to intersect a narrow zone of intense biotitic alteration.  

SRK studied if there was any significant bias indicated, either high or low, as a function of core 

recovery. To a certain extent it was anticipated that more intense zones of alteration would also often 

reflect more intense mineralization.  

Core recovery was generally recorded in 3 m intervals, with some data recorded in 1.5 m intervals. 

Consequently, for this analysis, it was decided to composite the core recovery values to the 3 m 

sample lengths and compare them with assay grades. The comparison indicates that the gold grade 

is generally lower with the increased recoveries (Figure 13.3). For this reason, SRK decided to 

model areas of low core recoveries and treat these areas as hard boundaries during grade 

interpolation.

Figure 13.3: Gold Grade versus Core Recovery Relationship 

 

13.5 Geological Domains 

The Springpole Gold Project is comprised of three distinct domains: East Extension, Camp zone and 

Portage zones.  

The East Extension zone lies to the east of Camp and Portage and is strike- oriented approximately 

105° (N105°E). The zone exhibits erratic gold mineralization with slightly clustered "bonanza" grade 

drill hole intercepts intermixed with lower grade and barren intercepts.  

The Camp zone lies to the north and, where the two domains overlap, above the Portage zone. The 

Camp zone strikes approximately 120° (N120°E) and part of the zone is very similar in character to 

East Extension with highly erratic grades showing very little spatial organization. 

The Portage zone is by far the most significant domain, extending from beneath the southern extent 

of Camp zone for more than 1,500 m to the southeast. Other than location, the Portage zone exhibits 

few similarities with the other two domains. Also in contrast with East Extension and Camp, Portage 

has significant silver mineralization closely associated with gold. Drill-tested mineralization is 

extremely continuous with very little evidence of isolated erratic higher grade intervals. As drilled, 

Portage represents a zone of largely disseminated mineralization striking 135° (S45°E) and 

extending from the surface to a depth of over 400 m, on average approximately 150 m in width and 

over 1,500 m in length. 

Geological domains were defined on sections spaced at 50 m intervals and a cut-off of 0.2 g/t was 

used to identify the geological domains on sections. Figure 13.4 shows the Springpole drill plan with 

the three geological domains and Note: Grid is 200 by 220 m. Green drill hole traces are > 0.2 g/t 

and red traces are > 0.3 g/t gold.

13.6 Surface Topography 

Topography was provided in the form of a Drawing Interchange Format file containing data from a 

LIDAR survey with vertical precision of 1 m. The topographic surface beneath the portion of the lake 

overlying Portage was established by ground penetrating radar, Echo Sounder and sub-bottom 

profiling surveys conducted by Terrasond Ltd. of Palmer, Alaska, from the frozen surface (March 

2011) and water lake surface (June 2011). These multiple surfaces were then merged to create a 

continuous surface to constrain the top of the block model. Overburden surface was modelled by 

extracting the base of the overburden from all available drill hole logs and generating a surface by 

simple triangulation of drill hole points.  

13.7 Compositing 

An analysis of the sample lengths within the mineralized domains shows that sample lengths are 

variable ranging from a low of 0.1 m to a maximum of 21 m; however, the majority of the samples 

are between 0.5 and 3 m in length with the largest proportion of the samples at 1 m in length (Figure 

13.6). Most samples, 99%, are less than 3 m in length and for this reason SRK decided to composite 

all assays to a 3 m length within the mineralized envelopes. Compositing was generated from the 

drill collars and compositing was interrupted at domain boundaries. The compositing process 

generated 18,576 composites. A total of 274 composites with length less than 1.5 m were discarded 

from the database prior to resource estimation.

13.8 Grade Capping 

The primary goal of grade capping is to identify and restrict the influence of suspected "outlier" 

grades in an estimate.  

Grade capping for the Springpole Gold Project was carried out in two stages. First the assay data 

were investigated to determine if sample length could bias the average grade. An analysis of gold 

grade against sample length seems to indicate that sample length of less than 1 m has a significantly 

higher average grade than other sample lengths, indicating these samples were taken over a 

specific geological domain, perhaps quartz veins or narrow siliceous zones with visible gold (Figure 

13.7). Most short sample lengths seem to have been taken from the Camp and East Extension 

zones; for this reason, SRK decided to treat these short sample lengths as a separate statistical 

population and caped these short assays prior to compositing. SRK capped all gold assays for 

sample lengths less than 1 m to 100 g/t gold prior to compositing.  

All assays were then composited to 3 m lengths and all 3 m composites were evaluated for outliers 

by examining their distribution on cumulative probability plots and capped as outlined in Table 13.1.

13.9 Statistical Analysis and Variography 

Statistical analyses were carried out on both the raw assay data and on the 3 m composited data. 

There are a total of 116,320 entries in the drill hole assay table for the Springpole Gold Project. Of 

these, 42,325 are within the interpreted wireframes representing the three mineralized domains. 

Some 8,191 historical assays within the mineralized domains were rejected because of uncertainties 

relating to quality control procedures. Of these, 61 samples were missing gold and silver assays 

because the results had not been received from the lab in time for the resource estimation, and 138 

samples did not have gold assays because of missing core resulting from poor recovery. Data for 

these cores were omitted from the statistical analysis presented in Table 13.2. Statistical data for the 

3 m composited data are presented in Table 13.3.

Spatial continuity of gold and silver was evaluated with correlograms developed using SAGE 2001 

version 1.08. The correlogram measures the correlation between data values as a function of their 

separation distance and direction. The distance at which the correlogram is close to zero is called 

the "range of correlation" or simply the range. The range of the correlogram corresponds roughly to 

the more qualitative notion of the "range of influence" of a sample or composite.  

Variographic analysis was completed for gold in the Portage, Camp, and East Extension zones and 

for silver in the Portage zone. Directional correlograms were generated for composited data at 30° 

increments along horizontal azimuths. For each azimuth, correlograms were calculated at dips of 0, 

30, and 60°.

A vertical correlogram was also calculated. Using information from these 37 correlograms, SAGE 

determines the best fit model using least square fit method. The correlogram model is described by 

the nugget (Co) and two nested structure variance contributions (C1, C2) with ranges of the variance 

contributions and the model type (spherical or exponential). After fitting the variance parameters, the 

algorithm then fits an ellipsoid to the 37 ranges from the directional models for each structure. The 

final models of anisotropy are given by the lengths and orientations of the axes of the ellipsoids. 

The experimental and modelled directional correlograms are presented in Appendix D. The 

correlogram models applied in the resource estimates in each domain are presented in Table 13.4.

13.10 Block Model and Grade Estimation 

Block modelling was carried out in GEMS (6.4) software by Dr. Gilles Arseneau, PGeo, associate 

consultant with SRK. Block estimates were carried out in 10 by 10 by 6 m blocks using a percent 

model to weight partial blocks situated at zone boundaries. Block model parameters are defined in 

Table 13.5.

 Grade Models 

Grades were estimated by ordinary kriging with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 15 composites 

with no more than three composites permitted from a single drill hole. Grade interpolations were 

carried out in three passes with each successive pass using a larger search radius than the 

preceding pass and only estimating the blocks that had not been interpolated by the previous pass. 

Table 13.6 summarizes the search parameters for each interpolation pass.

Uncapped gold was also estimated for all three domains for comparison against the capped results. 

The capped estimates were used for use in resource reporting and classification. 

 Bulk Density Model 

There are 140 bulk density measurements in the Springpole database with an average of 2.89. SRK 

is of the opinion that while these are sufficient to estimate a mineral resource, the amount of bulk 

density data are very limited for a deposit of this size and additional data should be collected to 

develop a more robust density model. SRK recommends that Gold Canyon initiates an aggressive 

campaign of bulk density measurements for the next mineral resource update. 

Gold Canyon collected samples for bulk density from 37 widely-spaced drill holes in the Portage 

zone. These samples attempted to represent the spectrum of alteration types and intensities, but are 

too few in number to derive volumetrically representative values for bulk density. The samples were 

tested by SGS Mineral Services in Toronto, Ontario using the waxed-immersion method to establish 

specific gravity values for each. The results ranged in value from a high of 3.08 to a low of 2.70 with 

an average of 2.89. The lowest values are generally representative of a narrow zone of intense 

argillic/biotitic alteration that will require additional drilling to define an accurate envelope. 

In light of the paucity of specific gravity data, SRK decided to estimate the bulk density by inverse 

distance squared where data were nearby or assign an average density to unestimated blocks, as 

presented in Table 13.7.

13.11 Model Validation 

The Springpole resource block model was validated by completing a series of visual inspections. it 

was additionally validated by comparison of local "well-informed" block grades with composites 

contained within those blocks and by comparison of average assay grades with average block 

estimates along different directions – swath plots. 

Figure 13.8 shows a comparison of estimated gold block grades with borehole composite assay data 

contained within those blocks within the mineralized domains and Figure 13.9 compares the silver 

grades. On average, the estimated blocks are similar to the composite data, although there is a large 

scatter of points around the x = y line. This scatter is typical of smoothed block estimates compared 

to the more variable assay data used to estimate those blocks. The thick white line that runs through 

the middle of the cloud is the result of a piece-wise linear regression smoother.

Figure 13.9: Comparison of Silver Grades for Well-Informed Blocks 

 

Note that there are relatively few data for silver for the East Extension (domain 100) and Camp zone 

(domain 200). This is due to the fact that only the Gold Canyon drill holes had silver assay data for 

these two mineralized zones.

As a final check, average composite grades and average block estimates were compared along 

different directions. This involved calculating de-clustered average composite grades and 

comparison with average block estimates along east-west, north-south, and horizontal swaths. 

Figure 13.10 shows the swath plots in the mineralized zones, and Figure 13.11 shows the swatch 

plot for silver within the Portage zone. The average composite grades and the average estimated 

block grades are quite similar in all directions. Similar behaviour was documented for all other 

mineralized zones. Overall, the validation shows that current resource estimate is a good reflection 

of drill hole composited data.

13.12 Mineral Resource Classification 

Block model quantities and grade estimates for the Springpole Gold Project were classified by Dr. 

Gilles Arseneau, PGeo (APEGBC #23474), an appropriate independent qualified person for the 

purposes of NI 43-101. The classification was completed according to the CIM Definition Standards 

for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2005). 

Mineral resource classification is typically a subjective concept, industry best practices suggest that 

resource classification should consider the confidence in the geological continuity of the mineralized 

structures, the quality and quantity of exploration data supporting the estimates, and the 

geostatistical confidence in the tonnage and grade estimates. Appropriate classification criteria 

should aim at integrating these concepts to delineate regular areas at similar resource classification. 

SRK is satisfied the geological modelling honours the current geological information and knowledge. 

The location of the samples and the assay data are sufficiently reliable to support resource 

evaluation. The sampling information was acquired primarily by core drilling on sections spaced at 

50 m.  

The mineral resources were classified according to the following rules: 

1) All blocks estimated for East Extension were assigned to an inferred category due to inclusion of 

drill hole data for which documentation of appropriate sample preparation, analysis, and QA/QC 

were lacking. 

2) The Portage and Camp classification was based solely on the gold estimate. Silver, as a minor 

by-product, carries the classification associated with the gold. Any blocks that were estimated 

during Pass 1 or Pass 2 with at least two drill holes and six composites were classified as 

indicated mineral resources. All other interpolated blocks were classified as inferred mineral 

resources.

13.13 Mineral Resource Statement 

CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2005) defines a 

mineral resource as: 

"(A) concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural 

solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial 

minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality 

that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, 

geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 

interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge" 

The "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement generally implies that the quantity 

and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that the mineral resources are reported 

at an appropriate COG taking into account extraction scenarios and processing recoveries. To meet 

this requirement, SRK considers that major portions of the Springpole Gold Project are amenable for 

open pit extraction.  

To determine the quantities of material offering "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" by an 

open pit, SRK used a pit optimizer and reasonable mining assumptions to evaluate the proportions 

of the block model (Indicated and Inferred blocks) that could be "reasonably expected" to be mined 

from an open pit. 

The optimization parameters were selected based on experience and benchmarking against similar 

projects (Table 13.8). The reader is cautioned that the results from the pit optimization are used 

solely for the purpose of testing the "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" by an open pit 

and do not represent an attempt to estimate mineral reserves. There are no mineral reserves on the 

Springpole Gold Project. The results are used as a guide to assist in the preparation of a mineral 

resource statement and to select an appropriate resource reporting COG.

SRK considers the blocks located within the conceptual pit envelope show "reasonable prospects for 

economic extraction" and can be reported as a mineral resource (Table 13.9).

*Mineral resources are reported in relation to a conceptual pit shell. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not 
have demonstrated economic viability. All figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate. All 
composites have been capped where appropriate. 

**Open pit mineral resources are reported at a COG of 0.4 g/t gold. COGs are based on a gold price of $1,400/oz and a gold 
processing recovery of 80% and a silver price of $15/oz and a silver processing recovery of 60%. 

 

This resource model includes mineralized material in the Camp, East Extension and Portage zones 

spanning from geologic sections 0+1,500 m in the northwest to 0-250 m in the southeast. Along the 

axis of the Portage zone resource modelling includes mineralized material generally ranging from 

340 to 440 m below surface.  

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The 

estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, 

taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues. The quantity and grade of reported 

inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient 

exploration to define these inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource, and it 

is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured mineral 

resource category. The mineral resources in this statement were estimated using current Metallurgy 

and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 

13.14 Grade Sensitivity Analysis 

The mineral resources of the Springpole Gold Project are variable depending upon the reported 

COG. To illustrate this sensitivity, the global block model quantities and grade estimates within the 

conceptual pit used to constrain the mineral resources are presented at different cut-off grades in 

Table 13.10 for the indicated mineral resource and in Table 13.11 for the inferred mineral resource. 

The reader is cautioned that the figures presented in this table should not be misconstrued with a 

mineral resource statement. The figures are only presented to show the sensitivity of the block 

model estimates to the selection of COG. Figure 13.12 presents this sensitivity as grade tonnage 

curves for the indicated mineral resource and Figure 13.13 displays the inferred mineral resource.

13.15 Previous Mineral Resource Estimates 

Mineral resources for the Springpole property were estimated and reported in a technical report filed 

on April 6, 2012 (Arseneau 2012). This resource model included mineralized material in the Main, 

East Extension, and Portage zones spanning from geologic sections 0+1,150 m in the northwest to 

0-150 m the southeast. Along the axis of the Portage zone, resource modelling includes mineralized 

material generally ranging from the surface to a depth of 240 to 360 m below surface and included a 

total of 426 drill holes. Mineral resources were reported in accordance with NI 43-101 and are 

summarized in Table 13.12. These mineral resources are no longer current and are now replaced by 

the mineral resources presented in Table 13.9 of this report.

Inferred resources were used in the LOM plan with inferred resources representing 10% of the 

material planned for processing. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have 

demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resources 

would be converted into mineral reserves. Mineral reserves can only be estimated as a result of an 

economic evaluation as part of a preliminary feasibility study or a feasibility study of a mineral 

project. Accordingly, at the present level of development, there are no mineral reserves at the 

Springpole Gold Project.

15 Mining Methods 

15.1 Open Pit Optimization 

 Input Parameters 

The 3-D mineral resource block model, as developed by Dr. Gilles Arseneau, PGeo, Associate 

Consultant with SRK, was used as the basis for deriving the economic shell limits for the Springpole 

Gold Project. The block model dimensions were 10 m x 10 m x 6m. 

Estimates were made for gold and silver price, mining dilution, process recovery, offsite costs and 

royalties. Mining, processing, and general administration OPEX were also calculated based on 

calculated processing throughput and, along with geotechnical parameters, formed the basis for 

open pit optimization (Table 15.1). The open pit mining costs assumed owner-operated mining.

The mineral inventory block model for the Springpole deposit was then used with Whittle™ open pit 

optimization software to determine optimal mining shells. This evaluation included the 

aforementioned parameters. 

The economic shell limits included indicated and inferred mineral resources. Inferred mineral 

resources are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied 

to them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the inferred resources 

would be upgraded to a higher resource category. 

 Cut-Off Grade 

Table 15.2 summarizes the parameters used, along with incremental (or mill) COG calculations 

(based on NSR) and mining dilution. The incremental (or mill) COG incorporates all OPEX except 

mining. This incremental cut-off is applied to material contained within an economic pit shell where 

the decision to mine a given block was determined by the Whittle optimization. This mill cut-off was 

applied to all of the estimates that follow.

It should be noted that the gold COGs are for comparative purposes only, as the NSR cut-off was 

used for Whittle optimization and mineral inventory estimates. The incremental NSR cut-off value of 

$13.67/t was applied to the mineral inventory estimates that follow. This equates to an incremental 

gold COG of approximately 0.41 g/t gold). 

 Optimization Results 

A series of optimized shells were generated for the Springpole deposit based on varying revenue 

factors. The results were analyzed with shells chosen as the basis for ultimate limits and preliminary 

phase selection. 

The results of the pit optimization evaluation on the deposit for varying revenue factors values are 

summarized in Table 15.3 and Figure 15.1 to Figure 15.3 for inferred and indicated resources. Note 

the NPV in this optimization summary does not take into account CAPEX and is used only as a 

guide in shell selection and determination of the mining shapes. The actual NPV of the project is 

summarized in the economics section of this report. 

Whittle produces both "best case" (i.e., mine out shell 1, the smallest shell, and then mine out each 

subsequent shell from the top down, before starting the next shell) and "worst case" (mine each 

bench completely to final limits before starting next bench) scenarios. These two scenarios provide a 

bracket for the range of possible outcomes. The shells were produced based on varying revenue 

factors (0.3 through to 1.4 of base case) to produce the series of nested shells with the NPV results 

shown.

For the Springpole deposit, shells beyond Pit Shell 19 add mineralized rock and waste tonnages to 

the overall pit, but have higher incremental strip ratios with minimal positive impact on the NPV. To 

better determine the optimum shell on which to base the phasing and scheduling and to gain a better 

understanding of the deposit, the shells were analyzed in a preliminary schedule. The schedule 

assumed a maximum processing rate of 7.3 Mt/yr. No stockpiles were used in the analysis and no 

CAPEX were added.  

Based on the analysis of the shells and the preliminary schedule, Pit Shell 19 was chosen as the 

base case shell for further phasing and scheduling of the deposit. This shell contains 72.4 Mt of 

mineralized material above cut-off with an average diluted gold grade of 1.19 g/t and 2,777 koz 

contained gold along with a silver grade of 6.01 g/t and 13,991 koz of contained silver. The total 

waste tonnage in the shell is 121 Mt for a strip ratio of 1.7:1. 

Both indicated and inferred resources were used in the LOM plan of which indicated resources 

represent 90% (65 Mt) of the material planned to be processed. Mineral resources that are not 

mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any 

part of the mineral resources would be converted into mineral reserves. Mineral reserves can only be 

estimated as a result of an economic evaluation as part of a Pre-Feasibility study (PFS) or a 

Feasibility (FS) of a mineral project. Accordingly, at the present level of development there are no 

mineral reserves at the project. 

Table 15.4 summarizes the tonnages and grades contained within the shell limits, using the 

incremental cut-off value of $13.67/t. Table 15.5 further summarizes the resources by classification.

15.2 Open Pit Mine Design 

Mine planning for the Springpole deposit was conducted using a combination of software packages, 

including MINTEC Inc. MineSight™ and Gemcom GEMS™ (6.4) and Whittle™ . The base 3-D block 

model was analyzed using GEMS (6.4). The phase selection and production scheduling was 

undertaken with the use of MineSight and Whittle software. 

For the Springpole deposit, the ultimate shell limits, along with the associated phasing (a total of 

three phases selected that correspond to Whittle shell 5, 7, and 19) were based on the shell analysis 

described in this report. Preliminary waste dumps were then designed to account for the material 

produced in each mining phase and shell. 

Shell 19 was chosen as the mining shape limit for the deposit. Figure 15.4 and Figure 15.5 represent 

plan and section views of the ultimate pit shape.

15.3 Mine Sequence/Phasing 

The preliminary shells for Springpole were further analyzed and optimizations were conducted to 

better define the possible stage designs within the ultimate shell limit. The Springpole pit was further 

divided into three phases for the mine plan development to maximize the grade in the early years, 

reduce the pre-stripping requirements, and to maintain the process facility at full production capacity. 

The shell tonnages, grades, and contained metal of the preliminary phases (stages) are summarized 

in Table 15.6.

Figure 15.6 and Figure 15.7 further illustrate the phase designs for Springpole, with tonnes, grades, 

and contained metal shown. 

The phases were based on the optimized shells summarized above. Shells selected provide 

reasonable pushback widths with mining starting in the higher grade zone and progressing 

southwards to ultimate limits. 

During the active mining and processing of the deposit, the waste would be placed into a waste rock 

facility adjacent to the final shell limits. All mineralized material would be hauled to the process 

facility immediately to the east of the deposit.

15.4 Open Pit Mine Operation 

The open pit mining activities for the Springpole pit were assumed to be primarily undertaken by an 

owner-operated fleet as the basis for this preliminary economic assessment. The average unit 

mining costs used in the project economics was $2.78/t of mineralized material mined and $2.57/t 

waste mined, for pit and dump operations, road maintenance, mine supervision, and technical 

services. The cost estimate was built from first principles and based on experience of similar sized 

open pit operations and local conditions. The open pit mining costs for both mineralized material and 

waste mining take into account variations in haulage profiles and equipment selection. 

Labour rates were estimated using local information. 

 Equipment 

Table 15.7 summarizes the assumed, all diesel, major open pit equipment requirements used for the 

basis of this study and are based on similar sized open pit operations. The proposed processing rate 

of 7.3 Mt/yr was used, along with deposit and pit geometry constraints, to estimate the mining 

equipment fleet needed. The fleet has an estimated maximum capacity of 83,000 t/d total material, 

which would be sufficient for the LOM plan.

Unit Operations 

The 250 mm diameter blast hole drills are planned to perform the bulk of the production drilling in the 

mine (both mineralized and waste rock), as well as in the mineralized zones to allow for better 

definition drilling. The 165 mm diameter rotary crawler drill bit is used for secondary blasting 

requirements and may be used on the tighter spaced patterns required for pit development blasts. 

The main loading and haulage fleet is planned to consist of 136t haul trucks, loaded primarily with 

the diesel powered 22 m3 front shovels or the 20 m3 wheel loader, depending on pit conditions.  

As pit conditions dictate, the D10-class dozers are planned to rip and push material to the 

excavators and maintain the waste dumps and stockpiles. 

The additional equipment listed inTable 15.7 is planned to be used to maintain and build access 

roads and to meet various site facility requirements, including stockpile maintenance and further 

exploration development. 

15.5 Mine Schedule 

The production schedule for the Springpole deposit was developed with the aid of Whittle and 

MineSight software, and incorporated the various pits and stages mentioned above. 

With the mineralized material near surface at Springpole, Year 1 represents the commencement of 

pre-stripping as well as the processing of mineralized material (at approximately 53% of maximum 

mill throughput). The LOM maximum planned total material to be moved is approximately 82,000 t/d, 

while the average total mining rate was planned to be 49,000 t/d. 

Indicated and inferred resources were used in the LOM plan, with indicated resources making up 

90% of the total LOM tonnage processed. The resources calculated included an estimated external 

dilution factor of 5%. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have 

the economic considerations applied to them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no 

certainty the inferred resources would be upgraded to a higher resource category.

The Springpole deposit is planned to produce a total of 72.4 Mt of plant process feed and 121 Mt of 

waste (1.7:1 overall strip ratio) over an eleven year mine operating life. The current LOM plan 

focuses on achieving consistent processing feed production rates, mining of higher grade material 

early in the schedule and balancing grade and strip ratios, while trying to maximize NPV. No 

blending of stockpiled material was included in this preliminary schedule. To achieve targets, up to 

two phases are active in any one year. 

Figure 15.8 summarizes process tonnage, waste tonnages, and strip ratio by period. Figure 15.9 

illustrates the feed tonnage by phase and period, as well as overall gold grades. During full 

production, the mine, on average, is estimated to produce total recovered gold of 217 koz/yr and 

recovered silver of approximately 1,200 koz/yr.  

Figure 15.10 represents the proposed overall site layout for the Springpole Gold Project.

To further illustrate the progression of mining of the Springpole deposit, Appendix E provides 

snapshots of the pit and waste rock facilities at the end of various periods. 

The pit is mined out in a series of push-backs to achieve the required process feed, while trying to 

maximize the NPV of the project. 

Mine Development Schedule 

Year 1:  Development of the Springpole Gold Project commences with pre-stripping and mine 

production of the pit. Plant processing is also scheduled to begin in Year 1 as a result of the 

location of mineralized material being near surface leading to minimal pre-stripping 

requirements. A total of 3.9 Mt of mineralized plant feed (~53% of full production target) and 

16.1 Mt of waste are scheduled. The average diluted gold grade is estimated to be 1.54 g/t, 

and the silver grade is estimated to be 3.64 g/t with an overall strip ratio of 4.2:1 (waste: 

plant feed).  

Year 2: The 7.3 Mt/yr target plant feed is envisioned to be attained with mining continuing in 

Stage 1. The average mine grade in Year 2 is estimated to 1.47 g/t gold and 8.78 g/t silver. 

A total of 2.9 Mt of waste rock is scheduled at a mined strip ratio of 0.4:1. 

Year 3: Process plant feed production is scheduled to be maintained at the target of 7.3 Mt/yr (or 

20 kt/d). Stage 1 is completed in the year and mining commences in Stage 2. Total waste 

planned to be mined from the two active phases is 20.3 Mt. The average gold grade is 

estimated to be 1.32 g/t, with a silver feed grade of 6.29 g/t. Stripping of push backs is 

planned to increase overall strip ratio to 2.8:1. Production rates are envisioned to increase 

to an average of 76,000 t/d total material for the year. 

Year 4: Mining of Stage 2 continues. Process plant feed production is planned to be maintained at 

a steady state of 7.3 Mt total delivered. A total of 13.6 Mt of waste is planned to be mined at 

an overall strip ratio of 1.9:1. Production rates for the year are scheduled to near 57,000 t/d 

total material. 

Year 5 to 8: Mining in Stage 2 and Stage 3, with an average of 21.6 Mt of total material mined 

and an overall strip ratio of 2.0:1. The average gold grade is expected to be 1.2 g/t with an 

average silver grade of 6.1 g/t. 

Year 9 to 11:  Mining occurs in Stage 3 over the final years of the LOM plan. The average annual 

strip ratio is expected to decrease to 0.5:1 with an average of 3.5 Mt of waste and 5.8 Mt of 

process plant feed planned to be mined in each period. Average mining rate is scheduled to 

be 30,000 t/d.

15.6 Rock Geotechnical Information  

 Slope Design Review 

A scoping level review of available geotechnical and structural data for the purposes of open pit 

slope design was completed. This review was based on all available diamond drill core logs and 

included an on-site rock-core review. A core-photo review of ten drill holes was used to estimate the 

rock quality designation, solid core recovery, intact rock strength (IRS), and the geological strength 

index (GSI). These estimates were used to guide preliminary domain delineation used for the slope 

design guidelines. Additional details of the slope design review, and ancillary data, are presented in 

Appendix F. 

Geotechnical data collection is on-going, with a 2013 drill-program designed and implemented to 

better understand the rock mass characteristics and enable slope design and stability analysis at an 

appropriate level of study.  

 Lithological and Rock Mass Information 

A 3-D wireframe geological model was not available for review, and insufficient data were collected 

for the geotechnical model to be built at this stage. Individual drill logs have been recorded for rock 

drilling on the property, and they include lithological and alteration descriptions of major lithologies. 

Total core recovery and rock quality designation has been relatively consistently and correctly 

recorded for most of the drilling evaluated for the property. Empirical rock strength estimates are 

recorded for more recent (2011 onward) drill core recovered. No unconfined strength, point load test, 

or joint-condition data have been acquired to-date. 

 Structural Information 

Faults within the proposed Springpole open pits and immediate vicinity have not been mapped or 

modelled. In the absence of these data (and to gain a preliminary understanding of the possible fault 

trends and their influence on the proposed pit) the topography and bathymetry in the form of a digital 

elevation model was interpreted for lineaments and zones of weakness possibly associated with rock 

mass damage in fault zones. This information assisted with the preliminary domain delineation (as 

described in Section 15.6.5). 

 Seismicity Potential 

The Springpole property is located within in a low seismic hazard zone. 

 Drill Core Review and Rock Mass Characterization 

Ten drill holes were selected to represent the rock mass likely to be encountered in the proposed pit 

walls. The core-box photographs, in conjunction with all available logs, were viewed and rated for 

solid screen recovery, GSI, and IRS. The solid screen recovery estimates were compared with the 

logged rock quality designation, and relatively good agreement was found between the two. The IRS 

estimates from core-box photographs was compared to the field strength estimates and some 

inconsistencies were found in the drill hole data acquired on-site. For this reason, the IRS estimates 

from core-box photographs (with field calibration from the site-visit) were used for rock mass 

assessment and design guidelines.  



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

The data were interrogated for preliminary geotechnical domains. Below the lake-floor sediments 

and glacial overburden, there are at least three distinct rock mass domains within the pit +200 m 

envelope. A Strong-domain, which surrounds Springpole Lake, is considered the host or "country-

rock". There is a relatively narrow transition into the Intermediate-domain and Weak-domain. The 

Intermediate-domain may be related to regional-scale faulting in some areas, but is also the 

transition towards the centre of mineralization. The Weak-domain appears to be directly associated, 

spatially, with the mineralization. Strong rocks dominate in the north, and on the south-western flank 

of the pit. The Weak-domain appears continuous through the centre of the pit, with the southern-

most slopes likely being composed of these rocks. The three domains' intact rock strengths and 

geological strength indices are likely to be in the order of: 

1. Strong-domain, IRS ≈ 150 ±50 MPa, GSI ≈ 60 ±30; 

2. Intermediate-domain, IRS ≈ 75 ±35 MPa, GSI ≈ 40 ±25, and; 

3. Weak-domain, IRS ≈ 30 ±20 MPa, GSI ≈ 25 ±20. 

Down-hole rock data for the ten selected drill holes are represented in five vertical sections 

contained within Appendix F. A representative vertical section and the preliminary domain 

boundaries (in plan view) are presented in Figure 15.11. The overall trend is strong (Archaen-aged 

basement) rock in the north, strong to intermediate strength rock on the south-west and north-

eastern flanks of the proposed pit, and weak mineralized (mafic) rock at depth, along the pit mid-line, 

and in the south. Alteration fluids introduced during the mineralizing events appear to have 

weakened the intact rocks in the immediate vicinity of higher-grade zones. The alteration "halo" is 

approximately 50 m wide. 

 Preliminary Slope Design and Recommendations 

The pit was partitioned into preliminary design sectors, as illustrated in Figure 15.12. On-section rock 

mass domains were used to determine the slope composition and to estimate an overall rock mass 

rating (RMR) for each section. These estimated overall-slope rock mass rating values, taking into 

consideration the weaker rocks in the toe of most of the slopes, were compared to published design 

charts to estimate achievable Overall slope angles for a factor of safety of at least 1.2. The sectors 

and their maximum recommended overall slope angles (to the nearest five degrees) are contained in 

Table 15.9.

The pit design guidelines for these sectors (as detailed in Figure 15.12) are based on: 

 Bench heights of 12 m, using a maximum stack height of 96 m, 

 A minimum width of 20 m between stacks, and 

 Single benching, with the possibility of double-benches in the stronger rocks of N-sector, if the 

fabric orientation is favorable. 

There is possibly an up-side improvement in slope design-angles if a significant increase in the 

confidence of the geotechnical data (and model) can be achieved. What may ultimately control 

achievable slope angles (apart from hydrogeological constraints) is the Weak to Intermediate-

domain spatial arrangement, and anisotropy in the host rock in the Strong-domain. To achieve a pre-

feasibility level of confidence for the slope design input parameters:     

 Design and implement an oriented-core geotechnical drill program to log the rock mass and 

acquire intact rock and joint samples. 

 Do laboratory and field tests to adequately characterize the intact rock strength and joint 

properties of the main rock types. 

 Map and describe all major faults, as viewed in drill core and rock outcrop within 200 m of the pit 

crest and integrate them with the regional structural interpretation. 

 Produce robust 3-D digital wireframe models of lithology, alteration with intensity, and structures. 

 Characterize the rock mass using an appropriate rock mass rating system (for example RMR89), 

and map the geotechnical domains within a 3-D model. 

15.7 Hydrogeology 

This section presents a review of hydrogeological considerations for Gold Canyon's Springpole Gold 

Project. The objectives of this review were to: 

 Provide a general analysis and review of the project's hydrogeological characteristics as they 

relate to mining and infrastructure. 

 Provide preliminary recommendations for water management. 

 Mine Plan 

The proposed general layout for the Springpole mine is presented in Figure 15.13. SRK understands 

the deposit will be mined using a series of open pits with a maximum depth of approximately 300 m. 

The outline of these pits overlaps a small portion of Springpole Lake. For the PEA, it is proposed that 

a series of three coffer dams be constructed at the southern end of the pit area (Figure 15.12) and 

the lake water pumped out. Details of the lake pumping are provided in Section 15.8. 

The mine waste facilities are also presented in Figure 15.13. The waste rock dumps will be located 

to the southwest of the pit. Tailings will be stored in uncemented paste (or thickened) form at the 

management facility located approximately 3 km to the southeast of the pit.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 Available Data 

Prior to 2013, there was no collection of hydrogeological data from the Springpole site. In early 2013, 

SRK initiated a pre-feasibility level geotechnical data collection program for the open pit. This 

program concluded in March 2013 and included 20 packer tests in 7 geotechnical core holes drilled 

within the proposed pit footprint. A full interpretation of the data was not available for the PEA 

reporting; however, hydrogeological observations from site and preliminary testing data were used 

for this report. 

 Hydrogeological Conceptual Model 

Based on regional observations and experience, a simplified hydrogeological conceptual model can 

be developed for the site. As there are little site-specific data, this conceptual model can only be 

used for broad assumptions, but can guide assessment of risk and areas for future data collection. 

The factors contributing to the conceptual hydrogeology are summarized below. 

Topography and Soils 

The property is underlain by glaciated terrain characteristics of a large part of the Canadian Shield. 

Land areas are generally of low relief with less than 30 m of local elevation. Tree cover consists of 

mature spruce, balsam, birch, and poplar. Black spruce and muskeg swamps occupy low-lying 

areas. Glacial till is generally less than 1 m in thickness. Outcrops are limited and small and are 

generally covered by a thick layer of moss or muskeg. Land areas are separated by a series of 

interconnected shallow ponds and lakes. 

Climate 

January temperatures range between -40°C and 0°C, and July temperatures range between 20°C 

and 40°C. Annual rainfall averages 704 mm, with evaporation estimated to be around 545 mm, 

indicating a net gain. The area receives approximately 200 cm of snow throughout the year. 

Geology 

Bedrock Lithology 

The distribution of the lithological units is not well understood at the Springpole site. There has been 

extensive drilling over the past 40 years within the Springpole deposit, but this lithological information 

from drill core was not digitized into a geological model. 

Summarized lithological units recorded in drill core within the pit area consist of the following: 

 Andesite sequence containing massive and tuffaceous andesite; 

 Clastic metasedimentary rocks, banded iron formation, and minor fragmental rocks cut by meter-

scale megacrystic feldspar porphyry dykes and lamprophyre dykes; and 

 Trachytic volcanic rocks and polymictic breccias cut by numerous meter-scale megacrystic 

feldspar porphyry dykes. 

The gold and silver mineralization at the Springpole deposit occurs in association with the 

disseminated pyrite-rich argillic and biotite-rich alteration zone (that primarily affect the trachytic

volcanic rocks and feldspar porphyry dykes) and stockworks of quartz-pyrite veins and veinlets. The 

physical degradation of this rock is considerable in places. 

Structure 

The geological structure on a concession scale is not currently well understood. The appearance of 

the altered rock, as described in the above section, makes identification of structures in drill core a 

challenge. In 2011, SRK undertook a preliminary study of the structural controls on the mineralized 

deposit geometry; however, this study was carried out on a small scale to investigate structural 

controls on mineralisation and was not projected out sufficiently to interpret larger features that could 

influence pit scale hydrogeology. 

Quaternary Geology (Overburden) 

There is no site specific data available for quaternary/overburden geology. From experience in other 

areas of the Canadian Shield, bedrock is typically scoured with deposits of glacial till varying in 

thickness from 1 m to up to 10 m in pockets. Soft lake sediments may vary in thickness between 1 m 

to 10 m. 

Groundwater Levels and Groundwater Flow 

There is currently no groundwater level data being collected from the project site. Given its proximity 

to the surrounding lakes, it is assumed that the water levels are similar to that of the lake level.  

Experience in this environment suggests that groundwater flow will mostly follow surface water flow 

directions. It should be noted that there is a surface drainage divide between Birch Lake (to the 

north) and Springpole Lake (to the south). Groundwater monitoring plans for the project should be 

designed to verify and acknowledge these catchment divide so that the groundwater flow is 

adequately characterized. 

Groundwater Inflows to the Pit 

During operations, inflow rates will be a function of pit-development shape, volume and rate of 

excavation, as well as hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock and the hydraulic gradient between the 

mine and surrounding surface water sources (lakes). Estimates of potential inflow rates to the pit 

were made at an "order of magnitude" accuracy level using analytical methods (Dupuit 1863). 

Hydraulic conductivity (K) values were derived from preliminary testwork currently being undertaken 

by SRK in a separate geotechnical data acquisition program for the proposed open pit (reference the 

pit shells used here). Given the location of the pit relative to the surrounding lakes, and the limited 

information on geology and structure currently available, a conservative approach was taken in 

estimating the pit-inflow. Inflow rates were estimated to reach a maximum of approximately 10,500 

m3/d. The potential for geological features to connect to the lakes was flagged as a risk to the project 

in the form of unanticipated water management and environmental concerns.  

Mine Water Supply 

Final water requirements will be dictated by the plant design. Given the proximity of nearby surface 

water bodies, groundwater is unlikely to be required as a primary mine water source. Groundwater 

inflows collected in the pit will, however, be pumped out and incorporated into the mine site water 

balance.

Tailings Management Facility and Waste Rock Dumps 

Both waste rock and tailings are considered to be potentially acid generating (Morin 2012). Although 

no site investigation work on the overburden has been undertaken to date, the depth of overburden 

is expected to be less than 0.5 m on average. Neither the waste rock piles nor the tailings 

management facility will have an under liner.  

15.8 Hydrology 

 Topography and Watershed Delineation 

Topographical information for the Springpole Gold Project site and surrounding area was obtained 

from Geobase (CTI 1997). The information utilized consisted of: 

 Digital Elevation model files with 250 k resolution for areas 052a to 052p (CTI 1997) 

 Digital Elevation model files with 50 k resolution for areas 052e13 to 052o12 (CTI 1997) 

These digital elevation models were compiled, and the watershed delineation was computed with 

Esri® ArcMapTM 10.1 utilizing the hydraulics and hydrology analysis tools. The ArcMap software 

uses a finite element procedure to define watershed boundaries and drainage lines based on 

topographical elements as well as defined watercourses. 

Regional flow watercourses were obtained from the USGS (2012) database HydroSHEDS 

(Hydrological data and maps based on Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at multiple Scales) including the 

definition of the most important watercourses, rivers and creek around the site area. 

 Annual Run-Off and Flow Rates 

Historic daily flow rates were obtained from Environment Canada (2010) for five unregulated gauging 

stations surrounding the project site. The daily flow rates were utilized to determine the annual run-

off, monthly flow rates and monthly distribution for each station. The average of the values from the 

five gauging stations was used for the site specific values. The average annual run-off was 

estimated to be 306 mm. The monthly run-off distribution can be seen in Table 15.10 

 Precipitation 

Monthly mean precipitation data were collected for nine stations surrounding the Springpole site, 

using Canadian Climate Normals 1971-2000 (Environment Canada 2012). Only stations with more 

than 18 years of complete data and located within 200 km of the project site were utilized. Along with 

the precipitation data site coordinates and elevation were also obtained. 

Mean annual precipitation was calculated for each station, and a graph of mean annual precipitation 

versus latitude was created. The mean annual precipitation for the Springpole site was determined to 

be 704 mm. Table 15.10 displays the rainfall distribution.  

The 1:25 year, 24 hour storm, rainfall was estimated to be 80 mm based on Atlas of Canada extreme 

rainfall statistics (Hogg and Carr 1985).

 Lake Evaporation 

Lake evaporation was calculated using the WREVAP version 1.0 evaporation estimating software. 

Monthly mean calculated lake evaporation, mean monthly precipitation and daily bright sunshine 

hours was obtained for five stations surrounding the project site from Canadian Climate Normals 

1951 to 1980 (Environment Canada 1982a, 1982c, 1982c). These data were inserted into the 

WREVAP software to obtain the calculated evaporation in mm and the monthly evaporation 

distribution for each of the surrounding stations. The average evaporation and evaporation 

distribution of the five stations will be utilized as the site evaporation. This is displayed in Figure 

15.14. The average annual evaporation is 546 mm. 

 
Figure 15.14: Mean Monthly Lake Evaporation for Five Stations Around the Springpole Site 

 

 Site Water Balance 

Based on the estimated annual precipitation, run-off and lake evaporation the Springpole site has a 

net negative water balance. However, lake evaporation typically over estimates evaporation;

therefore, it is possible that the site may have a net zero water balance. A detailed water balance for 

site activities was not performed at this time. 

15.9 Surface Water Management 

 Preliminary Design Assumptions 

Diversion ditches, sumps, and ponds will be required to manage the surface water at the Springpole 

site. The following assumptions were used for the preliminary design of the water management plan. 

 Lake dewatering is considered a part of the scope of the dewatering dikes and will not be 

included in the preliminary surface water management plan. 

 Water management for project infrastructure such as roads and pads would be included in the 

infrastructure design. 

 Surface water will be separated into contact and non-contact water. 

 Non-contact water is assumed to be of discharge quality. Contact water is assumed not to be of 

discharge quality, based on preliminary geochemical testing. Contact water will be sent to the 

mill for treatment and reuse. Non-contact water will be diverted or pumped to the closest water 

body. 

 Contact water will be considered all run-off from: 

 Waste rock piles (190 ha) 

 Ore stockpiles (5 ha) 

 Pits (70 ha) 

 Tailings Management Facility (365 ha) 

 Plant and Shop area (25 ha) 

 Pollution control ponds are not required to contain run-off from the pit or tailings management 

facility as the management of this water is already accounted for elsewhere. 

 Diversion structures, ditches, and ponds for non-contact water are assumed to be unlined. 

 Diversion structures, ditches, and ponds for contact water are assumed to be lined.  

 Sedimentation and pollution control ponds will be sized to contain the 1:25 year 24 hour storm 

event. 

 Design 

The water management structures for the waste rock dump and tailings facility consist of 9,000 m of 

diversion ditches and several pollution control ponds to collect run-off from the waste rock. These 

can be seen in Figure 15.15. Pollution control ponds have a maximum depth of 2 m. Ponds have a 

freeboard of 0.5 m, 3 m wide crest and side slopes of 2H:1V on the upstream side and 1.5H:1V on 

the downstream side.

16 Processing Recovery Methods 

The Springpole PEA is considering a 20,000 t/d process plant treating soft to moderate hardness 

(BWI of 7 to 14 kWh/mt) material averaging 1 g/t gold and 6 g/t silver. Testwork has determined that 

a moderate grind P80 size of 70 µm should achieve 80% gold extraction through cyanide leaching 

for at least 36 hours. Gravity recovery is considered optional, as only higher grade feed would 

benefit from including this circuit. 

16.1 Process Flowsheet 

The expected process flowsheet for Springpole is shown in Figure 16.1, based on testwork results to 

date. 

 

Figure 16.1: Springpole Process Flowsheet 

Due to the relative hardness, consistency and poor integrity of the mineralized zones, it is likely that 

a conventional semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill followed by ball mill will be used to an 80% 

passing size of 70 µm. Multi-stage crushing could be considered, but handling the likely wet and 

incompetent feed will make slurry processing easier after only one stage of primary crushing. 

A gravity recovery circuit should be included to treat the cyclone underflow stream when processing 

higher grade feed with possibly higher amounts of gravity-recoverable gold. It is a relatively 

inexpensive circuit to install and operate and, therefore, a cost effective way to maintain high gold 

recoveries. Gravity concentrate can be processed with an intensive leach reactor with the pregnant 

solution reporting to the electrowinning gold recovery circuit. 

Grinding cyclone overflow will pass over a trash screen and be thickened prior to cyanide leaching. 

This circuit will likely comprise of a primary stage of aeration and leaching followed by secondary 

carbon in pulp (CIP) tanks. The target residence time for cyanidation should be 36 to 48 hours. 

Cyanide consumptions will be moderate at around 0.5 kg/t. Leach tailings will report to cyanide 

destruction prior to tailings impoundment in the storage facility.

Gold loaded carbon will go to stripping and reactivation prior to be returned to the CIP circuit. 

Pregnant strip solution will report to electrowinning where the gold sludge will be sent to the furnace 

for recovery as doré bullion. 

Reagents to be used in the flowsheet include: 

 Sodium cyanide for gold leaching and carbon stripping, 

 Lime for pH control of cyanide leaching, 

 Hydrochloric acid for carbon stripping, 

 Sodium hydroxide for carbon stripping (after acid wash), 

 Flocculant for thickening of feed and possibly tailings, 

 Sulphur dioxide for cyanide destruction, and 

 Copper sulphate for cyanide destruction. 

16.2 Expected Plant Performance 

Based on the testwork results reported to date and the range of process flowsheet options 

considered in the 2012/2013 work, a likely flowsheet is a moderately fine grind size followed by 

whole feed leaching. Removal of gravity gold prior to leaching appears to only benefit high grade 

(>5 g/t gold) feed and should be considered an option for the flowsheet. 

The results from the 2012/2013 samples show a similar whole feed leaching response to the 2011 

samples (Figure 16.2). Typical head grades of 1 to 2 g/t gold generated residues of 0.2 to 0.5 g/t 

gold after 48 hours of leaching. Higher grade samples showed better extractions with lower residue 

grades likely due to the nature of the gold and its association.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

For the different ranges of gold grade, a reasonable relationship between gold extraction and grind 

size was observed in the 2011 and 2012 whole feed leaching results (Figure 16.3). As the kinetic 

results indicated that extraction was almost complete at 24 hours, the plant design should be for 36 

hours. In addition, a cyanide concentration of around 1 g/L seems reasonable as the intensive leach 

test (5 g/L CN, higher dissolved oxygen and elevated temperature over 96 hours, shown circled) did 

not increase overall gold extraction. Tests at 2 g/L NaCN or with carbon present did not improve 

leach extractions either. It seems most likely gold extraction is largely determined by particle size, 

with cyanide and oxygen levels contributing only a minor role in leaching rates. 

 

Figure 16.3: Whole Feed Gold Leach Extraction vs. Grind Size 

 

For the <2 g/t gold samples (more typical of the deposit), 24 hour extraction increased with grind 

fineness as shown by the line in Figure 16.3. This relationship suggests 70% extraction at a P80 size 

of 150 µm, 80% at 70 µm, and 90% at <20 µm. The oxidized samples showed >90% extraction at 

any grind size while the higher grade (>4 g/t) samples followed a similar trend with 15% higher 

extraction for the same grind. 

For the same ranges of gold grade, silver extraction appeared to be influenced by the intensive leach 

conditions. For samples of <2 g/t gold, >80% was achieved after 96 hours for a range of grind sizes 

(Figure 16.4).

Figure 16.4: Whole Feed Silver Leach Extraction vs. Grind Size 

 

Overall, a primary grind P80 size of 70 µm is required to achieve 80% gold extraction or better, 

depending on head grade. A trade-off study comparing the benefit of higher gold extraction at a finer 

grind size should be completed, considering the potential implications of very fine leach residues 

needing to be detoxified and handled by the waste management facility. 

At a primary grind of 70 µm, whole feed leaching will achieve 80% gold extraction with silver 

extraction slightly higher at 85% as shown circled in red (Figure 16.5).

17 Project Infrastructure 

17.1 Waste Rock Facilities 

The waste rock facility is planned to be located immediately adjacent to the final pit limits for the 

Springpole deposit. Given the deposit configuration and extraction sequence, no backfilling into 

previously mined out areas has been planned for Springpole. 

The waste rock facility would be built in a series of lifts in a "bottom-up" approach, and the facility 

would be constructed by placing material at its natural angle of repose (approximately 1.5H:1V) with 

safety berms spaced at regular intervals giving an overall operational slope of 2:1. The total design 

capacity of the waste rock facility is 121Mt. 

17.2 Tailings Management Facility 

The following preliminary design assumptions and/or criteria were taken into consideration for the 

preliminary TMF design presented here: 

 About 72 Mt of tailings (20,000 t/d) will be produced throughout the 11 year LOM.  

 Tailings characterization has not been carried out, so for volumetric calculations, conservative 

estimates for tailings density were assumed. 

 In addition to tailings, the tailings facility will contain soft lake bed sediments excavated from the 

dewatering dike foundations and pit area; an estimated 2.1 Mm3 (assuming 4 m deep sediments 

in the pit area and 5 m deep sediments under the dikes). 

 Minimum design criteria will be in accordance with Canadian Dam Safety Regulations (CDA 

2007). 

 The project is located in the low seismic hazard zone of Canada. Therefore, at this stage, there 

has been no consideration for specific design elements to address seismicity. 

 No geotechnical and/or hydrogeological characterizations have been carried out to evaluate 

foundation conditions. The designs presented are based on engineering judgement considering 

visual observation of surficial conditions during the site visits by Megan Miller, EIT, and Maritz 

Rykaart, PEng. 

 The site has a net negative water balance.  

 The site has generally little natural relief offering limited opportunities for natural containment of 

tailings. The overall topography ranges from about 385 to 415 masl. 

 There is competing interest in the available surface area for the placement of mine waste rock. 

As a rule, open pit project economics are more sensitive to waste rock location than tailings 

location; therefore, where conflicts occur, waste rock placement gets preference in siting 

decisions. 

  



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 Preliminary geotechnical testing carried out on the tailings suggests that the tailings will be acid 

generating, and therefore that complete environmental containment will be required for the 

tailings management facility. Since the containment dams are expected to be founded on 

competent bedrock a complete under liner is not included. 

 Options Analysis for the Tailings Management Facility 

Alternate Deposition Methods 

Alternate deposition methods considered for the project included: 

 Conventional low solids content (typically less than 30%) slurry, deposited in an on-land facility; 

 Conventional low solids content (typically less than 30%) slurry, deposited in a nearby lake; 

 Thickened tailings slurry (solids content typically between 30 and 60%), but still pumpable with 

centrifugal pumps; 

 Cycloned tailings, using the overflow to construct the embankments; 

 Uncemented thickened tailings (solids content typically in excess of 60%) requiring positive 

displacement pumps; and 

 Filtered (i.e., dry-stack tailings) tailings. 

Due to the low topographical relief and lack of natural containment basins, ring-dams will be required 

for any on-land tailings deposition strategy. Therefore, tailings deposition methods that result in 

smaller containment dams are preferred. Conventional low solids content tailings would require the 

largest containment dams and were therefore not considered further. Thickened tailings slurry offers 

only a slight advantage in this regard and was therefore also dismissed. Cyclone tailings could be a 

cost effective method as additional borrow material is not needed to build the dams. However, this 

deposition strategy is operationally challenging in cold climates and borrow material would be 

required to construct the starter dams.  

Sub-aqueous deposition of conventional low solids content slurry in a nearby lake could be done 

with little or no dam construction. Permitting of lake disposal would be environmentally and 

socio/economically challenging, and has, therefore, not been evaluated further.  

Filtered tailings would require the smallest containment dams; however, the proposed production 

rate would require a significant capital investment in filter presses with a correspondingly high 

operational cost. Therefore, this option was not evaluated further. 

Uncemented paste tailings (or more accurately, thickened tailings to the point where there is only a 

minor amount of bleed water) was, therefore, selected as the preferred tailings deposition strategy 

as it requires the least amount of containment dams to be constructed, while being more amenable 

to cold weather operation. 

It should be noted that this is a high level evaluation, and considering the level of study, a more 

comprehensive evaluation of deposition strategies would be warranted during future stages of this 

project.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Alternate Retaining Structures 

Hydraulically placed sub-aerial thickened tailings require construction of retaining structures. The 

alternative retaining structure technologies considered included: 

 Earth fill dams, 

 Lined rock fill dams, or 

 In-pit deposition (mined out open pit). 

In-pit disposal into a mined out open pit was considered but dismissed since the proposed mine 

development sequence does not provide for suitable locations. 

The construction of a low permeability core earth fill dam requires the availability of suitable low 

permeability materials, within tight engineering tolerances. No borrow characterization study was 

carried out, and, based on the reconnaissance site visit; it is unlikely that large quantities of suitable 

materials would be readily available. Therefore, at this stage, the preferred dam design is a 

geosynthetically lined rock fill dam.  

Alternate TMF Sites 

Based on the lay of the land, the closest viable area to the mill that did not require a major stream or 

lake crossing was selected for the TMF. A high level reconnaissance desk top search for alternate 

sites was carried out, but ultimately only the currently earmarked location was given any real 

consideration. Within the confines of this general area, there is some room for minor optimization 

during future development stages. 

Environmental and socio-economic criteria have only been considered in broad terms in this site 

evaluation, and it is therefore biased towards technical and economic criteria. As the project 

advances and more information become available about baseline conditions and potential 

environmental effects, the analysis should be revisited to confirm that the identified preferred option 

remains valid. 

 Tailings Management Facility Design 

Roughly 72 Mt of thickened tailings (about 60% solids by mass) will be centrally discharged at a site 

located about 5 km southeast of the proposed mill site. This results in an estimated 45 Mm3 of 

tailings to be stored, based on conservative estimates for a tailings density of 1.6 t/m3. The centrally 

discharged tailings will have a positive beach angle of 4% from a central discharge point. This 

assumed beach angle should be confirmed with testwork during later studies on the project.  

Due to the flat topographical relief of the project area, the tailings will be contained by a ring dam 

which will prevent migration of tailings, lake bed sediments, and any free water. The tailings facility is 

designed such that the dams will remain at the initial starter dam height of 2 m, except in the areas 

were a higher dam is required to contain lake bed sediments or prevent the tailings from encroaching 

on nearby lakes. 

To minimize pre-production capital cost, a dam continuously raised over the LOM would be the 

preferred construction method. However, due to the need to contain lake bed sediments (from dike 



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 120 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

construction), the initial ring dam will be constructed to the final dam height in all but a few areas, 

and only minimal raises (less than 1 m) would be required in the remaining areas. The savings 

offered by deferring that construction is not significant and, as a result, all tailings dam construction 

is considered pre-production capital. 

Dam 

The tailings ring dam will be approximately 7,355 m in length, with a maximum height of 9 m. With 

the exception of the lake sediment storage area and areas where the tailings will encroach on 

surrounding lakes, the 2 m high ring dam has no defined crest elevation and will generally follow the 

original ground elevation. The minimum crest elevation in the region required for lake sediment 

storage is 401 masl, which includes a 2 m freeboard. 

The tailings dam is assumed to be a run-of-quarry (Type A material) rock fill dam with a bituminous 

liner system on the upstream side. The liner system will extend into a trench excavated to bedrock 

where it will be tied into the bedrock with a concrete pony wall. Foundation preparation will consist of 

excavating all overburden material (Type C material) to expose bedrock. 

The upstream side of the dam will have side slopes of 3H:1V to facilitate liner placement; the 

downstream slope will have 2H:1V slopes. The crest will be 5 m wide in areas where the dam is less 

than 3 m high and 10 m wide elsewhere. The dam crest will be utilized as an access road for 

maintenance. Figure 17.1 demonstrates a typical dam cross section.

Water Management 

During lake dewatering (prior to the placement of tailings), the TMF dam will be used as a settlement 

pond for water with high total suspended solids and retention of dredged lakebed sediments.  

During tailings operations, surface water draining towards the facility will be diverted away from the 

tailings facility with a diversion ditch. Surface water which collects within the TMF will be collected 

and pumped back to the mill for reuse/treatment. 

Tailings Management 

Tailings will be thickened and pumped via two 400 mm diameter heat traced and insulated HDPE 

pipelines to the tailings management facility a distance of 5.6 km. The tailings will be discharged via 

a single spigot located in a tower at the centre of the facility. This spigot point will continuously be 

raised and rotated as deposition advances. A 150 mm diameter heat traced and insulated HDPE 

return water pipeline will lead back to the plant. 

Closure and Reclamation 

Once mining operations cease, the dams surrounding the tailings facility will be flattened and 

contoured to allow for natural drainage. Assuming that the tailings composition does not pose an 

acid rock drainage risk or metal leaching risk, the tailings will be covered with a simple soil cover 

from a locally available borrow source. The covered tailings surface would be re-vegetated. 

17.3 Dewatering Dikes 

The following preliminary design assumptions and/or criteria were taken into consideration for the 

dewatering dike design: 

 Minimum design criteria will be in accordance with Canadian Dam Safety Regulations (CDA 

2007). 

 The project is located in the low seismic hazard zone of Canada. Therefore, at this stage, there 

has been no consideration for specific design elements to address seismicity. 

 A series of geotechnical drill holes were completed in 2012 at multiple candidate dike locations. 

These drill holes managed to measure depth to bedrock; however there was no recovery of any 

overburden soils or lake bed sediments. The designs presented are based on engineering 

judgement considering the available data supported by visual observation of surficial conditions 

during the site visit by Megan Miller, EIT and Maritz Rykaart, PEng. 

 To allow sufficient time to construct the dikes and dewater the contained lake, the dikes will be 

constructed two years before mining starts. 

 Mine sequencing does not allow mine waste rock to be available for dike construction. A 

dedicated rock quarry will therefore have to be developed..

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Alternate Dike Technology 

Alternate construction technologies considered for the dike include: 

 Complete dewatering of Springpole Lake followed by conventional dike construction under dry 

conditions; and 

 In-water construction which would not require dewatering of Springpole Lake. 

Springpole Lake is a very large lake and dewatering of it to allow dry construction would not be 

practical or cost effective. In-water construction is, therefore, proposed. To ensure a watertight seal, 

sheet pile, slurry wall, and grout curtain construction technologies were considered. 

Comparison of rock depths from preliminary drill holes in the general vicinity of the proposed dikes 

and lake bathymetry at the drill hole locations suggest lake sediment thickness between 0.6 m and 

8 m, with an average thickness of 4 m. The lake sediments overly reasonably intact rock, although a 

transition zone of weathered rock is to be expected. Given this limited amount of data, the viability of 

sheet piles and a slurry wall to produce a good seal is limited due to constructability concerns. 

Therefore, at this time, a grout curtain has been assumed to be the preferred method. 

Alternate Dike Locations 

Several locations were proposed for the dewatering dikes as illustrated in Figure 17.2. The general 

intent was to find locations that minimized the area of lake dewatering, while ensuring that the dikes 

would be located outside of possible pit expansion footprints (at least 100 m from the final pit rim). In 

addition, locations with shallow water are preferred as it would allow for optimized dike construction. 

Based on these criteria dikes C1, C2, and D were selected as the preferred locations, requiring a 

total lake area of 162 ha to be dewatered, containing about 21.7 Mm3 of water.

Three dewatering dikes with a total length of approximately 510 m will be constructed in Springpole 

Lake to allow a portion of the lake to be dewatered. The dikes will be constructed to elevation 391 m 

above mean sea level, which allows 3 m of freeboard above the lake level. 

The dikes will be constructed under wet conditions; therefore, two silt curtains will be deployed 

downstream of the dike locations to prevent high suspended solids in the remainder of the lake. Prior 

to the placement of fill material, the foundation of the dam will be dredged to remove any soft 

lakebed sediments. The rock fill material will be placed, and then the grout curtain and plastic 

concrete cut-off wall will be built through the completed dike.  

The dikes will be constructed with a 12 m wide crest which will act as an access road during 

construction in wet conditions and the sides of the dikes will slope at angle of repose. The dike will 

consist of an upstream rip-rap layer (Type D material) over a layer of run-of-quarry rock (Type A 

material), an inner layer of bedding material (Type B material), through which the plastic concrete 

slurry wall will be constructed, and finally a downstream layer of run-of-quarry (Type A material) rock. 

The typical cross section of the dewatering dikes can be seen in Figure 17.2.

A 1 m thick plastic concrete slurry wall will be constructed through the center of the dike and extend 

a minimum of 1 m into bedrock to provide a water retaining seal. A three row grout curtain cut-off 

wall will extend 5 m into the bedrock to prevent seepage.  

Prior to dike construction, an assumed 5 m of soft lake bed sediments would be removed from within 

the footprint of the dewatering dikes. These lake bed sediments would be deposited in the TMF. 

Lake bathymetry was available for all three of the dike locations selected. Average dike heights were 

determined to be 1.2, 2.3 and 5.1 m for dikes C1, C2, and D, respectively. The maximum overall dike 

height, above the lakebed surface, is 8.2 m for dike D.  

Quantities associated with the dewatering dikes were calculated based on average lake depth and 

assumed geometry.

Lake Dewatering 

An estimated 21.7 Mm3 of water will have to be drained from the area of Springpole Lake within the 

dewatering dikes. Of this, 80% (17.4 Mm3) is estimated to be clean water which can be discharged 

directly over the dewatering dikes into Springpole Lake, inside the silt curtain. The remaining 

4.3 Mm3 (20%) is assumed to be 'murky' (i.e., have suspended solids higher than the allowable 

discharge limits). The murky water will be pumped to the TMF which will act as a sedimentation 

pond; no tailings will be in the TMF at this time. Clear water from TMF will be pumped to Springpole 

Lake. Steps will be taken during the dewatering process to reduce the amount of sediments that 

become suspended in the water, including silt curtains around the water intake area. 

Due to project economics, it is preferred that the lake be drained within one year of dike completion. 

In order to dewater the lake in this time period, the dewatering flow rate will be 0.6 m3/s (assuming 

dewatering 365 d/y, 24 hr/d). This dewatering rate is within the range of other planned and actual 

lake dewatering rates (BHP 1995, 1999, and 2001; Diavik 2003; Agnico-Eagle 2010; De Beers 

2010). Additionally, literature from other lake dewatering projects indicates that dewatering during 

the winter months results in less suspended solids. Preliminary hydrological evaluations indicate that 

the 0.6 m3/s dewatering rate is possible. 

Water Management 

During operations, surface water will be diverted from entering the drained portion of Springpole 

Lake. Management of direct precipitation and seepage into the pit will be included in the mine 

dewatering activities. 

Closure and Reclamation 

When mining ceases, pumping will cease and water will be allowed to re-enter the drained lake bed 

and pit. Once the lake has reached the natural lake level the dewatering dikes will be breached and 

the above water portions removed. Before breaching of the dikes, silt curtains will be installed. These 

silt curtains will remain in-place until water sediments reach acceptable levels.  

17.4 Infrastructure 

 Roads 

Two Lane Access Corridor Road 

This 12 m wide, two-lane unpaved, 39 km access corridor road extends from the Springpole deposit 

along the Birch River before it connects up with the planned Wenasaga Road (Gold Canyon 2012). 

This will be the primary access road for the project. The primary normal design vehicles for the road 

are Super B-Train trucks for hauling of supplies and equipment. Heavy equipment and oversize 

vehicles will occasionally use the road, especially during the project construction phase. 

Road construction will consist of clearing and grubbing of the right of way corridor, prior to placing of 

an approximately 0.5 m thick compacted sub-base layer sourced from locally developed and 

approved borrow sources (which has been assumed to be no more than 10 km apart, for a maximum 

haul distance of 5 km). Based on a cursory review of the alignment using low resolution 

topographical mapping, it is anticipated that only basic cut/fill techniques will be required to construct 

the road. 



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 127 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

The unpaved road surface will require ongoing maintenance consisting of re-grading and 

topdressing the running surface to reduce the wear on the haul truck and heavy equipment tires. 

Topdressing will be sourced from the local borrow sources used during construction. For the purpose 

of the cost estimate, it has been assumed that annually on average at least 3 cm of new topdressing 

will be applied to the running surface of the road.  

Single Lane Access Roads 

There are four 7 m wide single lane access roads located throughout the project area: 

 A 5 km section from the Mill to the South Dike, 

 A 1 km section from the Access Corridor Road to the Explosives Facility,  

 A 0.3 km section from the Access Corridor Road to the Landfill, and  

 A 0.2 km section from the Access Corridor Road to the Overburden Dump. 

The primary design vehicles for these roads are light trucks, although it is expected that heavy 

equipment will infrequently travel on these roads. 

Construction and maintenance of these roads will be similar to the Access Corridor Road. 

Stream Crossings 

Two major stream crossings are required along the Access Corridor Road. A 5 m wide, 3 m high and 

14 m long arched culvert will be constructed at the Deaddog Stream Crossing. The Birch River 

Crossing will require a 90 m long pre-fabricated bridge. Both crossings will be clear span bridges that 

are in accordance with requirements of the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Department of 

Fisheries and Oceans 

Routine surface water management along all roads will be done through crowning of the roads. In 11 

key areas along the Access Corridor Road, surface water will be allowed to cross the road via 

0.45 m diameter corrugated steel culverts. No culverts have been identified for the single lane 

access roads. 

 Buildings 

The buildings discussed below will be of modular design or consist of fully contained prefabricated 

components. They will be shipped to site either as complete units or will require minimal on-site 

construction, plumbing, and electrical work. 

General Maintenance Shop 

This is a pre-engineered, insulated sprung structure with a concrete slab on-grade measuring 30 m 

in length and 25 m in width. This facility will be used for general facility maintenance and upkeep.  

Waste Management Building 

This open floor plan structure measuring 13 m by 20 m will be used for sorting and handling all the 

waste produced from building construction and operation activities. If permitting allows, an 

incinerator associated with the Waste Management Building would be used to burn unpainted 



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 128 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

construction material and domestic waste, which would reduce the volume being transported to the 

landfill. Hazardous and recyclable waste will be transported off-site.  

Emergency Response Building 

This will be a framed structure measuring 10 m in length by 20 m in width and will house all the 

equipment and facilities to handle site emergencies  

Mine Maintenance Shop 

This is a framed structure measuring 30 m by 25 m and will be used for general service for mine site 

surface infrastructure, haul trucks and heavy equipment as well as light vehicles. The building will be 

equipped with overhead cranes, workbenches and equipment, as well as areas allocated to permit 

maintenance and fabrication activities.  

Light Vehicle Maintenance Shop 

This pre-engineered sprung structure with a concrete slab on-grade will be used for the maintenance 

of light vehicles. The shop will measure 30 m in length by 25 m in width. This building will also be 

equipped with overhead cranes, workbenches and equipment, as well as areas allocated to permit 

maintenance and fabrication activities.  

Assay Laboratory 

This building will be a framed structure measuring 20 m by 22 m. It will have areas allocated for 

sample preparation and analyses. The assay laboratory is a climate controlled, "clean" building. 

Warehousing and Storage 

This will be another pre-engineered insulated sprung structure with a concrete slab on-grade. It will 

measure 25 m in length by 30 m in width. This building will handle all inventories on-site and house 

stock that must be protected from the environment. It will be associated with a lay-down yard for 

larger pieces of equipment and materials. 

Camp 

This will be composed of modular structures that will be transported to site then connected together. 

The camp will accommodate 300 people in single rooms with dormitory style washrooms. This 

facility will also contain a kitchen, a mess hall, and recreation facilities. 

Water Treatment Plant 

This will be a packaged reverse osmosis treatment plant. The treatment plant will be self-contained 

within a couple of SeaCans which, when connected together, measures 13 by 9 m.  

Sewage Treatment Plant 

This will also be a packaged bio-reactor treatment plant with a sludge filter press. Just like the Water 

Treatment Plant, it has been assumed the Sewage Treatment Plant will be contained within a couple 

of SeaCans which, when connected together, measures 13 by 9 m.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Fuel Storage 

Substantial storage of fuel will not be required on-site due to the easy access to the nearby highway. 

Some fuel storage will be required for the mine, haul, and light vehicle fleets, as well as for the heavy 

equipment and production of ammonium nitrate/fuel oil, a bulk explosive. For the cost estimate, it 

has been assumed a 5 ML fuel tank farm, within a bunded area is to be constructed at the mine site. 

This structure will be shipped as pre-formed panels and trussed which will require on-site erection 

and fabrication. 

Office Complex 

It is estimated the mine site will have an office staff of 200 people. Several administration buildings 

will be required. For the purposes of the cost estimate, four buildings measuring 20 by 20 m were 

assumed. These will be modular buildings with interior furnishings to allow for all the administrative 

and day-to-day activities needed for the mine to operate. 

Mine Truck Shop 

This will also be a framed structure measuring 55 m by 30 m used to service the mining fleet for 

mine specific operations. This building will also be equipped with overhead cranes, workbenches 

and equipment, as well as areas allocated to permit maintenance and fabrication activities.  

Power Lines 

A 60 km long by 23 m wide right-of-way will be cleared, grubbed and prepared for the installation of 

a 115 kV wood pole transmission line using 636,000 mils conductor. The right-of-way will start from 

Highway 105 near Ear Falls and travel a further 90 km alongside the existing Hydro One corridor 

overland where it will connect to and follow the access corridor road to the project site.

18 Market Studies, Pricing, and Contracts 

18.1 Market Studies 

No project-specific marketing studies were undertaken for the PEA. The planned CIP processing will 

produce gold doré bullion that is a fungible commodity for which an efficient global market exists. It is 

of high value density meaning that the realised price of the contained gold is insensitive to the 

ultimate location of the customer and refinery as freight costs are negligible in comparison to 

contained value. 

Refinery terms of 99.5% payable gold in doré bullion and a refining charge of $5/oz that were used 

are typical of current terms being offered for CIP produced gold doré bullion. 

18.2 Pricing 

Based on SRK's review, long-term gold pricing forecasts used for the design of the mining project at 

$1,300/oz is consistent with gold prices being used in similar publicly released studies (Figure 18.1).

19 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social Setting 

19.1 General 

The Springpole Gold Project is located in an area of Northwest Ontario which has hosted mineral 

exploration and mining projects for most of the previous century. The Springpole Gold Project 

property has a history of gold exploration being carried out during two main periods, one during the 

1920s to 1940s, and a second period from 1985 to the present. Previous exploration activities on the 

property have comprised surface drilling, geophysical surveys, geological mapping, and exploration 

trail development. The exploration activities have resulted in a network of exploration trails and minor 

disturbances to the environment due to line cutting, trenching, and surface stripping.  

19.2 Environmental Regulatory Setting 

The environmental assessment (EA) and permitting framework for metal mining in Canada is well 

established. The federal and provincial EA processes provide a mechanism for reviewing major 

projects to assess potential impacts. Following a successful EA, the operation undergoes a licensing 

and permitting phase to allow operations to proceed. The project is then regulated through all 

phases (construction, operation, closure, and post-closure) by both federal and provincial 

departments and agencies. 

 Federal Environmental Assessment Process 

In the spring of 2012, the1992 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act was amended and replaced 

(CEAA 2012). Two significant results of the updated act were the redefinition of what "triggers" a 

federal EA and the introduction of legislated time periods within a federal EA, if it is required.  

Under CEAA 2012, an EA focuses on potential adverse environmental effects that are within federal 

jurisdiction including: 

 Fish and fish habitat, 

 Other aquatic species, 

 Migratory birds, 

 Federal lands, 

 Effects that cross provincial or international boundaries, 

 Effects that impact on Aboriginal peoples such as their use of lands and resources for traditional 

purposes, and 

 Environmental changes that are directly linked or necessarily incidental to any federal decisions 

about a project. 

  



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 132 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

With respect to the Springpole Gold Project, there are two main methods in which a federal EA could 

be required under CEAA 2012: 

1. A proposed project will require an EA if the project is described in the Regulations Designating 

Physical Activities (CEAA 2012).  

2. Section 14(2) of CEAA 2012 allows the Minister of Environment to (by order) designate a 

physical activity that is not prescribed by regulation if, in the Minister's opinion, either the 

carrying out of that physical activity may cause adverse environmental effects or public concerns 

related to those effects may warrant the designation. 

With respect to item one above, Section 15 of the Regulations Designating Physical Activities (2012) 

states: 

15. The construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of 

(a) a metal mine, other than a gold mine, with an ore production capacity of 3000 t/d or 

more; 

(b) a metal mine with ore input capacity of 4,000 t/d or more; 

(c) a gold mine, other than a placer mine, with an ore production capacity of 600 t/d or more. 

If the proposed project is captured under Section 15 of the Regulations Designating Physical 

Activities (2012), which is the case for the Springpole Gold Project, the proponent is required to 

submit a project description to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency for screening. The 

agency will then screen the project to determine if a federal EA is required. If a federal assessment is 

required, the minister then determines what type of EA the project will require. There are two types 

of EAs conducted under CEAA 2012: an environmental assessment by "responsible authority" 

(standard EA) and an environmental assessment by a review panel. Both types of assessments can 

be conducted by the federal government alone or in conjunction with another jurisdiction. The 

responsible authority in the case of base and precious metal mining is the CEAA. 

Under CEAA 2012, the federal government may also delegate any part of an environmental 

assessment to the province. At the province's request, the agency may also substitute the provincial 

process for a federal EA if the provincial EA process meets the requirements of CEAA 2012. Both 

processes have the potential to streamline the EA process. 

In addition to the federally legislated requirements defining the need for an environmental 

assessment, the federal government introduced the Major Projects Management Office (MPMO) in 

2007. The MPMO role is to provide a management and coordinating role for major resource 

development projects in Canada. The authority and mandate of the office is provided through a 

committee comprised of deputy ministers from federal departments typically identified as 

"responsible authorities" in the conduct of a federal environmental assessment. The MPMO has no 

legislative authority. The MPMO would self-determine their level of involvement in the assessment 

as part of the original screening process.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 Provincial Environmental Assessment Process 

In the Province of Ontario, the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA) is administered by the Ministry 

of Environment (MOE). The Act promotes responsible environmental decision making and ensures 

that interested persons have an opportunity to comment on projects that may affect them. Under the 

act, the environment is broadly defined and includes the natural, social, cultural, and economic 

environment.  

Mining projects in Ontario are not usually subject to the EAA because the act does not apply to 

private companies unless designated by regulation or the proponent has volunteered to be subject to 

the requirements of the EAA. However, some of the activities associated with the development of a 

mining project may be subject to the requirements of the EAA through existing class EAs (Class EA) 

or regulations. Such activities include:  

 Granting permits on Crown land, disposition of Crown resources; 

 Constructing power generation or transmission facilities; 

 Constructing infrastructure related to provincial transportation facilities; and  

 Establishing a waste management facility. 

19.3 Environmental Assessment Project Requirements 

The proposed project will need to be screened under the CEAA 2012. The requirement of a federal 

EA will become clearer once consultations with CEAA for the development of a project description 

are completed; however, it is expected that a federal assessment of the proposed project will be 

required given the project's potential impacts on fish, fish habitat, and other aquatic species. 

It is anticipated the project will require multiple class EAs or individual EAs to develop the mining 

project. Gold Canyon may decide to enter into a Voluntary Agreement with the MOE to subject the 

Springpole Gold Project to one EA instead of multiple EAs.  

The Springpole Gold Project is likely to require a federal and/or provincial EA before it can proceed. 

Completion of an individual EA, following its initiation, would require approximately 12 to 24 months. 

Based on current CEAA 2012 guidance documents and the act's new legislated timelines, a 

standard EA would require 12 to 24 months from the commencement of the federal EA. In the event 

the final design of the project dictates an amendment to Schedule II of the Metal Mining Effluent 

Regulations, the time necessary to complete the environmental assessment and subsequent 

licensing phase would be increased. 

Ontario and Canada honour an EA cooperation agreement that harmonizes the two assessment 

processes to run concurrently under a single administrative process. This process is typically 

administered jointly by Ontario's Assessment Branch and the CEAA regional office located in 

Toronto, Ontario. Combining the assessment requirements of both jurisdictions under this 

cooperation agreement would make it possible to streamline the assessment process.

19.4 Environmental Licensing Process 

Following a successful EA, the project will be required to obtain a number of provincial and federal 

licences/permits. This process can generally be initiated, in part, during the final stages of the EA if 

one is required. The following sections contain lists of both federal and provincial licences and 

permits the project will require.

19.5 Social Setting 

Gold Canyon's Springpole Gold Project is located in northwestern Ontario, approximately 110 km 

northeast of Red Lake. The project is located in an unorganized township, Red Lake Mining District, 

Casummit Lake Area within the Trout Lake Forest Management Plan. The Red Lake area has been 

a historic mining camp since the gold rush of the 1920s, and it currently has five active mines and 

numerous decommissioned or abandoned mines situated within the Municipality of Red Lake. 

Mineral exploration, mining, mining spin-offs and wilderness tourism (hunting, fishing) comprise the 

majority of economic activity in the area.  

Groups that maybe impacted by the project are the Aboriginal communities in the area including Cat 

Lake, Slate Falls, Lac Seul, and Wabauskang First Nations; the Métis Nation of Ontario (MNO); 

remote tourism outfitters and local land owners. 

 Aboriginal Consultation 

Gold Canyon has made it a priority to identify and protect the Aboriginal values and sensitive sites 

and is committed to carry out meaningful and good faith consultation with the aboriginal communities 

that may be affected by the project. They have maintained an open-door policy and have provided 

regular notices and updates regarding their activities on the project. During the archaeological and 

biological assessment work that was completed in 2012, Gold Canyon hired technicians from the Cat

Lake, Slate Falls, and Lac Seul First Nations to help complete the assessment work and to be 

liaisons to their communities and participate in the open-house information sessions.  

In the spring of 2012, the Chiefs from the First Nation communities of Cat Lake, Slate Falls, and Lac 

Seul signed an internal protocol agreement to work together for the purpose of negotiations with 

Gold Canyon. Gold Canyon is also engaged in regular meetings with a working group that is 

comprised of members from each of the partnership First Nations. 

Gold Canyon has had introductory meetings with the Wabauskang First Nation. It is anticipated that 

there will be future meetings to discuss various parts of the project as they develop and progress.  

Gold Canyon has had an introductory meeting with the MNO to provide information about the 

Springpole Gold Project and has provided notification of the project to the Lands and Resources 

Branch of the MNO. Additional meetings are anticipated as the various parts of the project develop 

and progress. 

 Public Consultation 

Gold Canyon has identified many relevant stakeholders in the region including Domtar, the Red Lake 

Local Citizen's Committee, the Township of Ear Falls, local tourist operators, outfitters, commercial 

bait fisherman, bear licence holders and private landowners. Introductory presentations and updates 

about the project have been delivered by Gold Canyon. Gold Canyon is committed to advancing the 

consultation process with the affected stakeholders in the region to seek feedback and to help 

identify concerns so that the appropriate mitigation measures may be developed. 

19.6 Preliminary Reclamation Plan 

The final closure plan for the proposed project will be developed for the entire project as part of the 

assessment and licensing process in accordance with Ontario legislation, a financial bond will also 

be required in accordance with the Ontario Mining Act.  

Conceptually, the closure of the proposed project will consist of the following main components: 

 decontamination, 

 asset removal, 

 demolition and disposal, and 

 reclamation of all impacted areas. 

All project components will be decontaminated as necessary. Surplus chemicals and other 

hazardous materials will be removed and stored in designated temporary storage facilities within the 

facility footprint until such time that they can be resold or permanently stored in a licenced facility. 

All salvageable or recyclable components will be dismantled and stored in a designated lay down 

area to allow for secondary decontamination and eventual shipment off-site. All infrastructure that 

cannot be salvaged and re-used will be demolished and disposed of in an approved facility.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Following any required re-grading, an appropriate cover for the tailings management facility, as well 

as any remaining waste rock storage piles, will be developed and constructed.  

The open pit will be allowed to flood, and, once the water quality is acceptable the coffer dams will

The impacted areas including the tailings and waste rock covers will be vegetated with an 

appropriate seed mixture designed to enhance natural re-vegetation of the site.

20 Capital and Operating Costs 

20.1 Capital Costs 

 Mine Capital Cost 

The CAPEX estimate for the open pit operation is based on the scheduled plant throughput rates, as 

well as comparing to similar sized open pit gold operations (throughput of 7.3 Mt/a process plant 

feed). The open pit mining activities for the Springpole pit was assumed to be undertaken by an 

owner-operated fleet as the basis for this preliminary study with the fleet having an estimated 

maximum capacity of 85,000 t/d total material, which would be sufficient for the proposed LOM plan.  

The open pit equipment CAPEX (including sustaining and replacement costs) required to achieve 

the target processing rate is summarized in Table 20.1 below. Mining cost service information, as 

well as factors based on experience, was taken into consideration in determining the open pit 

CAPEX estimate. No equipment was considered as lease. 

The ancillary equipment includes light trucks and service vehicles, backhoes, and fuel trucks, along 

with a number of other required open pit mining support equipment.

Given that mineralized material outcrops at surface, no pre-stripping requirements were allocated for 

the Springpole pit. The first year of mine productions predicts that 3.9 Mt of mineralized material will 

be fed to the process plant. As such, no pre-stripping CAPEX have been estimated, other than those 

described below in relation to lake drainage.

 Process Capital Costs 

SRK prepared an estimate of capital costs for a 20,000 t/d process plant to treat Springpole material 

based on testwork results to date. As part of this PEA, such estimates should be considered 

accurate to ± 40%. 

The process flowsheet includes crushing, grinding, gravity recovery, CIP leach as well as gold 

recovery via activated carbon to produce doré bullion. 

Table 20.2 summarizes the process plant capital cost estimate of $148M ± 40%. It is based largely 

on comparative methods with similar leach plants and adjusted for local conditions and material 

hardness.

 Infrastructure Costs 

A PEA level cost estimate (accurate to ± 40%) has been developed for the infrastructure. Material 

take-off for earthworks (e.g., roads) is based on first principles calculations using averaged sections. 

Building costs are based on typical building sizes for similar operations using an in-house SRK 

database and engineering judgement. Site specific vendor quotes have not been obtained. Project 

indirect costs are assumed to be 30% and a contingency of 40% applies to the direct costs.

 Tailings Management, Lake Dewatering and Dike Costs 

A PEA level cost estimate (accurate to ± 40%) has been developed for the TMF and dewatering 

dikes. Primary material take-offs based on the designs presented in Section 17.1 and 17.2 were 

calculated using Global Mapper. Total quantities for each structure are presented in Table 20.4 and

Assumptions have been made about haul distances, road grades, material properties, productivity, 

labour rates, fleet type and equipment and materials rates. These assumptions were based on 

engineering judgement, past project experience and supplemented with conventional costing 

databases. Key assumptions are summarized as follows: 

 Construction will be done by a dedicated specialist contractor using their own fleet of equipment. 

 A fleet of five 40 t (19.85 m3) CAT 740 haul trucks will be used. 

 A CAT 980 loader and a CAT 345 excavator will be used to load the haul trucks at the rock 

quarry (borrow source). 

 Due to mine sequencing, waste rock will not be available for construction of the dewatering dikes 

or TMF dams. Local rock quarries will be developed and are assumed to be within 5 km of their 

intended use. Costs include quarry development, drilling, blasting, crushing and screening as 

appropriate.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 The overburden thickness is unknown, but expected to be limited. Local till within the confines of 

the TMF is therefore assumed to not be a viable construction source. 

 Barges already located at the project site will be utilized for dredging activities. 

 In the absence of geotechnical investigations for the dikes, it has been assumed that a grout 

curtain will be installed to create a suitable seal.  

 Costs do not include construction of access roads from the mill or haul roads from potential 

quarries (these costs are included in the infrastructure cost estimate). 

 Costs for the tailings thickeners and both tailings and reclaim water pumps are excluded here. 

Those costs are included in the processing CAPEX.  

 Lake dewatering costs are considered to be CAPEX. 

 Closure and reclamation costs are not included in this cost estimate. 

 Costs are estimated in 2013 USD. 

 Indirect costs have been assumed to be 30% of the direct costs 

 A contingency of 40% of direct costs was applied. 

The dewatering dikes must be constructed at least two years before mine production starts to 

provide enough time for lake dewatering. Since the TMF will be used as the settling basin during this 

time, it will be constructed at the same time. Table 20.6 and Table 20.7 summarize these costs.

 Surface Water Control 

Costs were built up based on the proposed waste rock facility design configurations and existing 

topography. Water diversion and catchment requirements were estimated. 

PEA level capital costs were estimated for the preliminary design and presented in Table 20.8.

The following assumptions were utilized in the cost estimate. 

 The construction fleet will consist of five CAT 740 haul trucks, a CAT 345 excavator, and a CAT 

980 loader. 

 No blasting is required to excavate channels for diversion ditches. 

 Sedimentation and pollution control ponds will be lined with bituminous geomembrane liner. 

 Construction material (quarried rock, bedding material and rip-rap) is assumed to be available 

within 5 km. 

 Indirect costs at 30% of direct costs. 

 Contingency at 40% of direct costs.

20.2 Operating Costs 

 Mining Operating Costs 

The open pit mining activities for the Springpole deposit were assumed to be primarily undertaken by 

the owner as the basis for the PEA. The cost estimate was built from first principles, input from Gold 

Canyon, as well as SRK experience of similar sized open pit operations. Equipment efficiency was 

estimated based on-site conditions (e.g., estimated haul routes for each phase). Local labor rates 

(for operating, maintenance, and supervision/technical personnel) and estimates on diesel fuel 

pricing ($1.10/L) were taken into consideration for the mining cost estimate. 

The Open Pit mining costs were calculated for both mineralized material and waste mining, where 

variations in haulage profiles and equipment selection were taken into account in the cost estimate. 

Open pit mining costs for this preliminary assessment were estimated to be $2.57/t waste mined and 

$2.78/t mineralized material mined.  

The mining cost estimates encompass open pit and dump operations, road maintenance, mine 

supervision and technical services. 

 Process Operating Costs 

A comparative estimate was made by SRK for the process OPEX of $10.5/t ± 40% (excluding 

tailings and general and administrative (G&A) costs). Table 20.9 summarizes the breakdown of 

operating expenses by area.

Tailings $(0.2) 

G&A $(2.3) 

Net Processing $10.5 

Notes: cost estimates are considered accurate to ± 40% for this PEA 

EPCM = Engineering, Procurement, Construction & Management 

 

An electrical power unit cost of $0.08/kWh was assumed for this project which was factored in with 

the material hardness and relatively fine primary grind requirements. The net processing cost after 

tailings and G&A costs are removed is $10.5/t.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Grinding media and liner wear were considered typical and the labour cost is for 95 process 

employees (staff + hourly) with a 42% burden applied. The OPEX includes sustaining capital which 

has been estimated at $1/t. 

 Tailings, Dewatering Dike and Surface Water Management Operating Costs 

OPEX for the TMF consist of operating the secondary thickener, and subsequently pumping tailings 

from the secondary thickener to the central TMF discharge point. This point has to be raised over the 

LOM. This cost equates to $0.83/t. The cost of pumping tailings slurry to the secondary thickener, 

and subsequently pumping recycle water back to the mill, is included in the mill operating cost.  

No operating costs were included for the dewatering dikes. It is assumed that any water seeping 

through the dikes will be included in the mining water management costs. Yearly operating costs for 

surface water management are estimated to be $33,000, assuming pumps are operating 50% of the 

time.

21 Economic Analysis 

21.1 Important Notice 

The Economic Analysis that forms part of this preliminary economic assessment (PEA) report is 

intended to provide an initial review of the Gold Canyon Resources Inc. Springpole Gold Project's 

potential and is preliminary in nature. The economic analysis incuded in this PEA includes 

consideration of inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have 

the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral 

reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA based on these mineral resources will be realized. 

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

21.2 Introduction  

A PEA-level technical economic model has been developed for the Springpole Gold Project. 

The PEA contemplates mining and processing material at 20,000 t/d and at an average head grade 

of 1.2 g/t gold and 6.0g/t silver. Summary parameters and economic results are presented in Table 

21.1.

21.3 Key Assumptions 

The following production related assumptions have been applied to the technical economic model: 

                                                      
1 From commencement of production 
2 From commencement of production

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 Production rate at maximum of 20,000 t/d over 365 d/yr. 

 Pre-production period of five years. 

In addition, the following general assumptions have been applied for mine design and economic 

evaluation: 

 A base case discount factor of 5% has been applied for NPV calculations. SRK considers this to 

be typical for gold projects of this type and in this location. . 

 An average LOM sales price of $1,300/oz gold. 

 An average LOM sales price of $25/oz silver. 

 Net smelter royalty of 3% on revenue. 

 Working capital days have been assumed at 45 days for creditors and 45 debtors. 

 Modelling Practice 

The project was evaluated using an Excel® based discounted cashflow model. The periods used 

were annual. The model used real, un-escalated Q1 2013 USD. 

The asset-level model assumes a simple all-equity project ownership and financing. No 

consideration of equipment leasing, project financing, bonding, metal strips, royalty sales (except for 

existing government and private royalties) forward sales, hedging, or any other financial 

arrangements was undertaken. No consideration was given to the structure of the ownership 

company. 

The valuation was undertaken on a pre-tax and post-tax basis. 

 Construction Schedule 

For the purposes of economic evaluation, five years of pre-production were assumed, comprising 

three years for permitting and two years for construction. 

Delays to commencement of construction do not materially alter the economic potential of the 

underlying project, but it must be recognised that costs associated with permitting, studies and 

management activities will accrue during the pre-construction phase. It should be noted that the 

impact of costs associated with a delayed construction schedule on the economics of the overall 

project have not been considered in modelled scenarios. 

 Production Schedule 

The mining production schedule evaluated was generated by SRK as described in Section 15.5 and 

is reproduced in Table 21.2.

 Mine Life  

The LOM is 11 production years. The first year of production includes near-surface material that 

does not require pre-stripping in year 1. Both mineralized material and waste mining ends in 

Year 11. 

 Commodity Pricing 

The base case economic evaluation uses long-term commodity prices of $1,300/oz for gold and 

$25/oz for silver. Sales prices have been applied to all LOM production without escalation or 

hedging. 

SRK considers the use of these prices for design and evaluation to be reasonable and to lie within 

the range of published price assumptions recently used for studies of this type. 

 Revenue Calculations 

Revenue is determined by applying selected metal prices to the annual payable metal contained in 

doré, minus refining and royalty payments. Detailed calculation of revenue is presented in Table 

21.3.

21.4 Mining 

 Capital Costs 

Mining capital costs were estimated by SRK on the basis of a detailed equipment schedule matched 

to the mining production schedule. Total mining capital was estimated at $140.9M for the life of the 

project inclusive of 5% contingency and 5% spares allowance.  

An amount of $20M is estimated for mine closure costs. 

 Operating Costs 

Mine operating costs were estimated by SRK based on the mine design, production schedule, 

equipment rates and other input costs. 

Table 21.4 shows a high-level summary of the LOM costs expressed per tonne of material moved 

and per unit of processed material. No contingency has been assumed for mine operating cost.

21.5 Processing 

 Capital Costs 

Processing capital costs for mill and plant infrastructure were estimated by SRK to be $168M 

inclusive of $20M contingency. 

 Operating Costs 

Operating costs were estimated by SRK to be $10.5/t of processed material based on 20,000 t/d 

plant capacity. The base case assumes a power cost of 0.08 $/kWh and no contingency has been 

assumed for processing operating cost. 

21.6 Overall Capital Costs 

Overall Capital costs are summarized in Table 21.5 and detailed capital costs for the LOM are 

presented in Table 21.6.

21.8 Taxes and Royalties 

 Royalty 

For project evaluation purposes in the PEA, an average royalty of 3% was applied to the net smelter 

return based on the Mineral Resource Update Section 13 of this report. The net smelter return is 

$3,154M calculated from: (payable metal) x (payable %) x (price minus refining charges). Total 

royalty payment over the LOM is estimated at $95M. 

 Taxes 

Tax was estimated on a simplified basis, appropriate for a PEA-level evaluation. Taxes modelled 

were Ontario Mining Tax (OMT), Ontario Provincial Corporate Tax and Federal Corporate Tax. 

Depreciation 

Simplified depreciation schedules were estimated based on capital investment. A depletion method 

was applied as a proxy for more complex depreciation schedules that are likely to be used in 

practice. In SRK's experience, depletion methods tend to be slightly conservative when compared to 

more complex methods and result in earlier tax payments modelled earlier than is typically 

acievable. Losses associated with post closure expenditure were carried back for a maximum of 

three years. 

Pre-esisting depreciation allowances associated with prior expenditure of $45m were modelled on 

advice from the client. These amounts are not material in the context of a PEA-level evaluation and 

were not audited by SRK.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Ontario Mining Tax 

The assumption was made that the mine was "remote" for the purposes of OMT caluations and 

accordingly a rate of 5% was applied. Royalties were included in the basis of calculation for this tax. 

Ontario Provincial Corporate Tax 

A rate of 10% was applied to taxable income. 

Federal Corporate Tax 

A rate of 15% was applied to taxable income. Note the provicnical and federal taxes are applied to 

the same basis. Neither is deductible for estimation of the other. 

21.9 Working Capital 

A high level estimation of working capital has been incorporated into the cashflow. This comprises 

estimates of accounts receivable terms, accounts payable terms and stores stock levels. 

21.10 Base Case Valuations 

 Important Notice 

The Economic Analysis that forms part of this preliminary economic assessment (PEA) report is 

intended to provide an initial review of the Gold Canyon Resources Inc. Springpole Gold Project's 

potential and is preliminary in nature. The economic analysis incuded in this PEA includes 

consideration of inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have 

the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral 

reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA based on these mineral resources will be realized. 

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

 Results 

The primary economic evaluation measures used were total LOM cashflow, NPV of this cashflow at 

a 5% discount rate, the internal rate of return of the project cashflows, and the payback period on a 

non-discounted basis. Table 21.9 summarizes the high level economic outputs from the modelling. 

Note that payback is quoted from the commencement of production.

21.12 Conclusions and Recommendations 

 Important Notice 

The Economic Analysis that forms part of this preliminary economic assessment (PEA) report is 

intended to provide an initial review of the Gold Canyon Resources Inc. Springpole Gold Project's 

potential and is preliminary in nature. The economic analysis incuded in this PEA includes 

consideration of inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have 

the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral 

reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA based on these mineral resources will be realized. 

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

 Conclusions and Recommendations 

The economic analysis of the PEA indicates that a conventional open-pit mining and milling 

operation has reasonable prospect of being an economic exploitation strategy. On the basis of the 

assumptions used in the this PEA, the a base case post-tax NPV5% of $388M (pre-tax NPV: $579M) 

and an IRR of 14% (pre-tax IRR: 25%) on an initial investment of $438M is estimated. 

The need for lake drainage is a significant cost to the project and is subject to a higher level of 

uncertainty in terms of cost and schedule. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis inidcates that, at base 

case metal price assumptions, the project may be able to absorb significant escalation in capital and 

operating costs and potentially remain a viable economic proposition.

24 Interpretation and Conclusions 

Industry standard mining, process design, construction methods, and economic evaluation practices 

were used to assess the Springpole Gold Project. Based on current knowledge and assumptions, 

the results of this study indicate that the project may have positive economics within the very 

preliminary parameters of a PEA. and should be advanced to the next level of study - either 

preliminary feasibility or feasibility. 

The preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature; it includes inferred mineral resources 

that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to 

them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that 

the preliminary economic assessment will be realized. 

While a significant amount of information is still required to do a complete assessment, at this point 

there do not appear to be any fatal flaws for the project. The study achieved its original objective of 

providing a preliminary review of the potential economic viability of the Springpole Gold Project. 

24.1 Geology 

The quality assurance/quality control program instituted by Gold Canyon and conducted by SGS is 

of a standard generally consistent with current industry practice. SRK acknowledges that the QA/QC 

procedures have evolved rather recently and much of what is presented above is "catch up" work. In 

that respect Gold Canyon have done well to bring the database, at least from 2007 onward up to an 

acceptable industry standard. The principal exceptions lie with: 

 Lack of documentation on QA/QC procedures for drilling prior to 2003; 

 Blank analyses suggest intermittent contamination introduced at some stage of material storage 

or processing; and 

 The lack of standard reference materials for silver. 

The analysis for gold and silver confirms an acceptable degree of reproducibility of samples for gold 

and a very good reproducibility for silver.  

There is no evidence of bias in either gold or silver as a function of grade but the company needs to 

implement written QA/QC procedures for deciding which assay batches are acceptable or not and 

which samples need to be re-assayed because of failed QA. 

The drill hole database from 2003 through 2012 is of a standard acceptable for public reporting of 

resources according to NI 43-101 guidelines. 

24.2 Mineral Processing and Metallurgy 

The investigations to date on Springpole mineralized material have allowed the following conclusions 

to be reached: 

 The presence of coarse gold in higher grade portions of the East Extension and Camp zones 

suggests that gravity concentration should be included in the comminution circuit. 



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 165 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 Cyanidation of a finely milled product looks promising. 

 Flotation is an option that requires further investigation. 

 Heap leaching does not appear attractive. 

To further develop the likely process routes, further mineralogical, and metallurgical investigations 

are recommended.  

This PEA is based on a design plant capacity of 20,000  t/d. 

Based on the testwork results to date, a recommended flowsheet of whole feed leaching after 

grinding to a P80 size of 70 µm is proposed. A gravity circuit can be included for higher grade feed 

material. Cyanide leach extractions of 80% for gold and 85% for silver are expected at this grind 

size. Product from the process plant will be doré bullion. 

 Risks 

While considerable metallurgical testwork has been completed to date in three programs on different 

samples, additional testwork is warranted to better define the plant design criteria and more 

confidently predict expected performance. 

To date, a relatively small number of composite samples have been used for flowsheet development. 

Additional samples should be collected for variability testing. These samples should each come from 

a small area of the deposit (e.g., a single drill hole interval or series of intervals from nearby holes). 

Each sample should be tested on the expected flowsheet to quantify variability in performance for 

different parts of the deposit. These samples also should be hardness tested using a number of 

methods to determine their resistance to SAG milling, ball milling and possibly fine grinding. 

Additional testwork needs to be done to confirm cyanide detoxification can be completed 

successfully and within normal reagent cost levels. Thickening and filtering characteristics should be 

confirmed so that unexpected dewatering costs are not needed. For whole feed leaching, the plant 

tailings will likely be acid generating and the associated costs with treatment/handling of this material 

need to be estimated. 

Future testwork can consider concentrating the sulphides via flotation or classification into a smaller 

mass so that it can be stored separately from the remainder of the tailings. For example, dry stack or 

subaqueous deposition in the tailings pond to minimise the potential for acid generation. 

 Opportunities 

The testwork conducted to date has identified a number of options that should be considered in 

trade-off studies; namely the effect of primary grind size on whole feed leach extraction. With a finer 

grind, it appears that gold recoveries up to 90% are achievable, but at the expense of higher grinding 

power, media wear and in particular, use of specialised grinding equipment for target P80 grind sizes 

below 40 µm. In addition, with a whole feed leaching flowsheet, grinding all the feed finer will lead to 

issues of detoxifying and handling the very fine leach residues.

Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 166 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

The option of concentrating the gold and sulphides with flotation should continue to be investigated 

in future testwork. However, it is recommended that a more thorough mineralogical investigation of 

the flotation concentrate be conducted prior to any leach testing. The grain size and association of 

gold particles should reveal why the flotation concentrate is somewhat resistant to cyanidation at the 

same grind sizes. Such information was not possible through the diagnostic leach tests previously 

conducted. 

24.3 Mineral Resource Estimate 

Review of the pre-2003 data lead to some drill hole data for Portage zone, East Extension, and 

Camp zones being excluded from the mineral resource estimate. A systematic re-sampling of the 

available drill core stored on-site at the Springpole Gold Project would enable the reclassification of 

the East Extension zone into indicated resource category without the need to carry out an additional, 

extensive drilling campaign. This re-sampling exercise would involve ground survey of drill collar 

locations in respect of historic records as well as the inclusion of a systematic program of certified 

blanks, certified gold and silver standards, and field and pulp duplicates where sufficient drill core 

remains.  

The same is not true of pre-2003 drill cores from Portage zone—the inability to accurately verify the 

original drill collar locations by any means in respect of surveyed UTM or mining grid locations 

combined with the paucity of material due to initially very low core recovery excludes this data set for 

resource estimation. 

The current mineral resources for the Springpole Gold Project prepared by SRK consider 512 core 

boreholes drilled by Gold Canyon and previous owners of the property during the period of 2003 to 

2012. The resource estimation work was completed by Dr. Gilles Arseneau, PGeo (APEGBC 

#23474), an appropriate independent qualified person as this term is defined in NI 43-101. The 

effective date of the resource statement is October 17, 2012. 

In the opinion of SRK, the resource evaluation reported herein is a reasonable representation of the 

global gold and silver resources found in the Springpole Gold Project at the current level of sampling. 

The mineral resources have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM Estimation of 

Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices guidelines and are reported in accordance 

with the Canadian Securities Administrators' NI 43-101 and at a 0.4 g/t gold cut-off include 128.2 Mt 

grading 1.07 g/t gold classified as indicated mineral resource and 25.7 Mt grading 0.83 g/t gold 

classified as inferred mineral resource.  

The revised mineral resource estimate (October 17, 2012) was based on a gold price of $1,400/oz 

and a silver price of $15/oz. These are considered reasonable economic assumptions by SRK. To 

establish a reasonable prospect of economic extraction in an open pit context, the resources were 

defined within an optimized pit shell with pit walls set at 45° . Assumed processing recoveries of 80% 

for gold and 60% for silver were used. Mining costs were estimated at $2/t of total material, 

processing costs estimated at $12/t and G&A costs estimated at $2/t. A COG of 0.4 g/t gold was 

calculated and is considered to be an economically reasonable value corresponding with breakeven 

mining costs. Approximately 90% of the revenue for the proposed project is derived from gold and 

10% from silver.

Note: For the mine development (Whittle optimization) and economic analysis in this PEA, updated 

input parameters were used. 

Industry standard mining, process design, construction methods and economic evaluation practices 

were used to assess the Springpole Gold Project. In SRK's opinion, there is adequate geological and 

other pertinent data available to generate a PEA. 

Based on current knowledge and assumptions, the results of this study show that the project has the 

potential for positive economics (within the very preliminary parameters of a PEA) and should be 

advanced to the next level of study; a preliminary feasibility study. 

As with almost all mining ventures, there are a large number of risks and opportunities that can 

influence the outcome of the Springpole Gold Project. Most of these risks and opportunities are 

based on a lack of scientific information (test results, drill results, etc.) or the lack of control over 

external drivers (metal price, exchange rates, etc.). The following section identifies the most 

significant potential risks and opportunities currently identified for the project, almost all of which are 

common to mining projects at this early stage of project development.  

Subsequent higher-level engineering studies would need to further refine these risks and 

opportunities, identify new ones, and define mitigation or opportunity implementation plans. 

While a significant amount of information is still required to do a complete assessment, at this point 

there do not appear to be any fatal flaws for the project. 

The study achieved its original objective of providing a preliminary review of the potential economic 

viability of the Springpole Gold Project. 

24.4 Mining 

It is proposed that the Springpole deposit is amenable to be developed as an open pit mine. Mining 

of the deposit is planned to produce a total of 72 Mt of processing plant feed and 121 Mt of waste 

(1.7:1 overall strip ratio) over an eleven year mine production life. 

 Risks 

The current understanding of the project is based upon limited and time sensitive information. 

Changes in the understanding of the project, the ability to convert resources to reserves and market 

conditions could affect the project's economic viability. 

 Opportunities 

With additional data, the project should be subjected to a series of strategic option reviews aimed at 

determining the most valuable strategy for exploiting the resource including the LOM schedule. 

Planning and executing the project at the correct scale, with the optimum mine design and 

processing systems will result in the maximum possible value to shareholders and other economic 

stakeholders.  



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 168 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Pit optimization work has identified larger pit shells which are economic with current input 

parameters with the Whittle software identified a number of potential pit shells (or phases) and the 

selected pit shell provides higher grades, lower strip ratio, and reduced capital and operating 

expense. 

If conditions change such that a larger pit shell is selected to recover more resources, infrastructure 

such as the proposed cofferdam should not be impacted. Consideration in the location and design of 

the cofferdam took this possibility into consideration. 

24.5 Geotechnical 

There is possibly an up-side improvement in slope design-angles if a significant increase in the 

confidence of the geotechnical data (and model) can be achieved. What may ultimately control 

achievable slope angles (apart from hydrogeological constraints) is the Weak to Intermediate-

domain spatial arrangement, and anisotropy in the host rock in the Strong-domain. To achieve a pre-

feasibility level of confidence for the slope design input parameters:     

 Design and implement an oriented-core geotechnical drill program to log the rock mass and 

acquire intact rock and joint samples. 

 Do laboratory and field tests to adequately characterize the intact rock strength and joint 

properties of the main rock types. 

 Map and describe all major faults, as viewed in drill core and rock outcrop within 200 m of the pit 

crest and integrate them with the regional structural interpretation. 

 Produce robust 3-D digital wireframe models of lithology, alteration with intensity, and structures. 

Characterize the rock mass using an appropriate rock mass rating system (for example RMR89), and 

map the geotechnical domains within a 3-D model. 

24.6 Hydrogeology 

Hydrogeological data are limited for the Springpole site. Based on experience from other northern 

mining operations in Canada, the following conclusions have been developed for the Springpole 

Gold Project: 

 Management of groundwater within the pit may be required through conventional methods such 

as dewatering wells and sumps to reduce mine trafficability issues, although this should be 

within reasonable mining costs. 

 Elevated pore pressures may develop during excavation of the pit in both overburden and 

bedrock. Without adequate hydrogeological data collection, the assumption for the PEA is that 

water and potential excess pressures can be managed and will not impact the slope design. 

 Groundwater quality is unknown. Groundwater will likely be used in the mine water supply and 

excess is typically sent to the mill pond if its quality is below groundwater discharge guideline 

limits. 

Recommendations for pre-feasibility level studies are provided in the following section. 



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 169 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 Risks 

In general, hydrogeological uncertainties for the Springpole property include: 

 The mine will be located within the existing (dewatered) lake footprint. The hydrogeology of the 

project area has not been fully characterised with respect to groundwater flow directions, 

transmissive features, and the potential for hydraulic connection to the surrounding lake. 

Seepage may be anticipated through and beneath the coffer dams. 

 Limited understanding of the geological and structural models will result in low confidence of the 

distribution of hydraulic conductivity within—and in the vicinity of—the proposed pit, resulting in 

uncertainty relating to the magnitude of possible groundwater inflows to the pit. 

 No information on baseline groundwater quality. 

These uncertainties correspond to the following potential risks: 

 Higher than anticipated groundwater flow. Resulting from highly transmissive features such 

as structures or highly permeable horizons, or weathered/altered zones, there is a risk of higher 

than anticipated inflows to the pit, resulting in high pumping requirements / management costs. 

Geological and structural models to be developed further to increase confidence in the 

conceptual hydrogeological model. Seepage through coffer dams has not been assessed and 

may result in unanticipated seepage rates leading to high water management/ treatment costs. 

 Elevated pore pressures. In low hydraulic conductivity bedrock, drainage of groundwater may 

not be able to keep up with the excavation of the pit, resulting in a buildup of pore pressures in 

the pit walls that may lead to geotechnical instability if not accounted for or mitigated. 

Hydrogeological investigations of the lithological units will identify areas within the vicinity of the 

proposed pits that may require management, with respect to depressurisation. 

 High inflow rates and groundwater compartmentalization. Uncertainty in the structural model 

may result in potentially high hydraulic conductivity zones (faults) in connection with lakes that 

may result in significantly high pit inflows. If not anticipated, such features can cause instability in 

lower slopes or lead to problematic inflows that require management. Low permeability structural 

features (relative to the surrounding bedrock) can result in compartmentalization of remnant 

pressures (in overburden and bedrock) within the excavated slopes that may also create 

unstable conditions. Structures on a concession scale require study to understand the degree of 

groundwater flow anisotropy. 

 Trafficability issues. The mineralized zone consists of highly altered rock that may require 

focussed water management in high seepage areas to avoid poor working conditions.  

 Groundwater may have to be treated prior to discharge. Quality of groundwater into the open 

pit may not be suitable for discharge without treatment. Water treatment may be required.  

24.7 Hydrology 

Stream flows, annual average precipitation and evaporation were estimated for the Springpole site 

based on nearby gauging and weather stations. This information was used in the preliminary design 

of the surface water management.

Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 170 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 Risks 

No borrow source investigations have been performed therefore it is recommended that an 

investigation be performed to confirm the availability of suitable construction materials within the 

assumed haul distances. If borrow material is not available that could increase the capital costs 

associated with surface water management. 

 Opportunities 

Additional geochemical testing of waste rock may indicate that lined pollution control ponds are 

not required; this could reduce the water management infrastructure costs. 

24.8 Tailings Management Facility 

The TMF is designed to contain centrally discharged paste tailings, and soft lakebed sediments from 

lake dewatering. The paste tailings will slope from the center at 4% and be contained by a ring dam. 

Due to the requirement to store soft lake bed sediments the dam will be constructed to final height 

before the start of mining. 

 Risks 

The following should be considered as potential risks to the project outcome given the current state 

of understanding: 

 It has not been confirmed whether lining of the TMF would be required given subsurface 

conditions, tailings geochemistry or environmental regulations. Should lining be required, it 

would result in an increase in both initial and sustaining capital. 

 No geotechnical or hydrogeological investigations have been carried out at the TMF; therefore, it 

cannot be confirmed whether the allowances for foundation seepage control are adequate. 

Complex foundation conditions would result in increased CAPEX. 

 No borrow source investigations have been carried out to confirm availability of suitable 

construction materials within the assumed haul distances. Should the assumptions prove to not 

be valid, CAPEX and sustaining capital will increase. 

 No physical characterization of the tailings has been done to confirm whether the material would 

be amenable to thickened tailings as proposed, specifically attaining of a 4% beach angle. 

Should this not be possible, the TMF design concept would not be viable and the costs as 

presented would increase due to increased containment requirements. 

 Several small ponds exist within the tailings footprint. These may result in permitting challenges. 

 Opportunities 

Potential opportunities that have been identified at this time include: 

 Borrow source investigations may reveal that sufficient quantities of low permeability material for 

core construction may be available on-site. This would result in a reduced CAPEX.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 Geotechnical investigations may indicate that bedrock is located at a shallower depth than 

assumed in the cost estimate. This would result in a reduced CAPEX. 

 Alternative sediment storage options outside the TMF should be evaluated to conserve capacity 

and to make the sediment available for rehabilitation at closure.

Three dewatering dikes will be required to allow for the dewatering of a portion of Springpole lake to 

allow for open pit mining. These dikes will be constructed under wet conditions with a rockfill shell 

and concrete slurry cut-off wall. Dewatering of the lake is projected to take 1 year assuming 

continuous pumping at a rate of 0.6 m3/s. 

 Risks 

Potential risks associated with the preliminary dewatering dike designs include: 

 Limited geotechnical and no hydrogeological investigations have been carried out at the 

dewatering dike foundation; therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether the allowances for 

foundation seepage control are adequate. Complex foundation conditions would result in 

increased CAPEX. 

 The assessment of the downstream effect of discharging 0.6 m3/s of water during lake 

dewatering into Springpole Lake was a very high level assessment. A more detailed assessment 

may indicate that a lower discharge rate, and consequently a longer discharge period, may be 

required to dewater the lake. 

 Opportunities 

Potential opportunities that have been identified at this time include: 

 Lake dewatering could occur at a faster rate if the water was discharged into several different 

lakes. Faster dewatering could improve the overall project economics. 

 A sheet pile cut-off wall through the dewatering dike may reduce CAPEX; however, it could 

result in additional pumping costs. This should be assessed in more detail in future work. 

 Geotechnical investigations may indicate that bedrock is located at a shallower depth than 

assumed in the preliminary design and cost estimate. This would result in a reduced CAPEX. 

24.10 Project Infrastructure 

The two lane Access Corridor Road and all single lane access roads will be constructed using 

conventional cut and fill techniques prior to placing of an approximately 0.5 m thick compacted sub-

base layer sourced from locally developed and approved borrow sources. Routine surface water 

management along all roads will be achieved by ensuring the roads are graded with a crown. Eleven 

locations along the Access Corridor Road will have corrugate steel culverts installed to allow surface 

water to pass while no culverts have been identified for the single lane access roads.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Two major stream crossings will be required along the Access Corridor Road. An arched culvert will 

be constructed at the Deaddog Stream Crossing while a pre-fabricated bridge will be constructed at 

the Birch River Crossing. 

Surface infrastructure earthworks will use also conventional cut and fill techniques to provide suitably 

graded areas to place the buildings and allow for surface drainage. The buildings will be of modular 

design or consist of fully contained prefabricated components. These structures will require minimal 

on-site construction, plumbing, and electrical work. 

The Fuel Tank Farm should be located on a blasted bedrock foundation. Compacted engineered 

backfill will be used to bring up to the appropriate grades and provide suitable bedding material for 

the lined containment facility as well as be used for pedestal supports for the fuel tanks. 

 Risks 

The following should be considered as potential risks to the project outcome given the current state 

of understanding: 

 No geotechnical or hydrogeological investigations have been carried out along the road 

alignments or within the surface infrastructure footprint; therefore, it cannot be confirmed 

whether complex foundation conditions are required which would result in increased CAPEX. 

 No borrow source investigations have been carried out to confirm availability of suitable 

construction materials within the assumed haul distances. Should the assumptions prove to not 

be valid, CAPEX will increase. 

 The surface infrastructure component sizes have not been finalized. Increasing building sizes or 

the number of buildings will increase CAPEX costs. 

 Opportunities 

Potential opportunities that have been identified at this time include: 

 Given the location and climate, it is possible that road maintenance may be less than currently 

allowed for in the cost estimate. 

24.11 Environmental Studies and Permitting 

The potential impacts the project may have on Springpole and/or Birch Lake are considered to be 

the more environmentally and socially sensitive components of the project. Gold Canyon is 

cognizant of these sensitivities and has taken steps to design the project with these sensitivities in 

mind. To that end, the project is designed to avoid direct interaction with the Birch Lake watershed, 

and all baseline studies carried out to date are structured to identify areas of risk so they can be 

protected to minimize impact during the development of the project or totally avoided. 

The development of the open pit into Springpole Lake will require the isolation of a portion of the lake 

throughout the 11 year mine life of the project and for a number of years following depletion of all 

mineralized material before the coffer dams can be breached or removed. Fish habitat compensation 

will be required as a result of this advancement into the lake. However, following decommissioning

Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 173 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

and closure of the mine the coffer dams would be breached and the pit would be reunited to the lake. 

The potential exists for Gold Canyon to incorporate significant aquatic habitat enhancement to 

Springpole Lake through the re-introduction of the pit area to the lake proper.  

The management of the mine waste (tailings and waste rock) also represents a longer term 

environmental concern. The tailings management facility and waste rock repository will likely 

assimilate fish bearing ponds and doing so will likely involve additional fish habitat compensation as 

well as an amendment to Schedule II of the metal mining effluent regulations. The next phase of 

engineering for the project will further evaluate alternative mine waste management areas to avoid 

impacting water bodies and, therefore, the need for a Schedule II amendment. Tailings and waste 

rock management are covered in more detail under separate sections of this study. The 

environmental risks associated with these facilities following operations will be addressed as part of 

the project's detailed closure plan.  

All potential environmental impacts associated with the project can be mitigated through the 

implementation of accepted engineering practices currently employed throughout Canada's mining 

industry. A detailed monitoring plan will also be developed to ensure environmental compliance of all 

components of the mine throughout its construction, operation, closure, and post-closure activities. 

24.12 Economic Analysis 

The Economic Analysis that forms part of this preliminary economic assessment (PEA) report is 

intended to provide an initial review of the Gold Canyon Resources Inc. Springpole Gold Project's 

potential and is preliminary in nature. The economic analysis incuded in this PEA includes 

consideration of inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have 

the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral 

reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA based on these mineral resources will be realized. 

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

The base case economic analysis results indicate a post-tax NPV of $388M at a 5% discount rate 

(pre-tax NPV: $579M) with an IRR of 14% (pre-tax IRR: 25%). Payback (post-tax, non-discounted) 

will be in Year 3 of production in a projected 11 year LOM production period. The economics are 

based on a base case of $1,300/oz long-term gold price, $25/oz long-term silver price, and 

production rate of 20,000 TPD over 365 d/yr. Direct operating costs are estimated at $636/oz of 

AuEq. Total capital costs are estimated at $544M, consisting of initial capital costs of $438M, and 

ongoing sustaining capital of $106M.  

Sensitivity analysis inidcates that, at base case metal price assumptions, the project can absorb 

significant escalation in capital and operating costs and remain a potentially economic proposition. 

24.13 Summary of Risks and Opportunities 

 Project Risks 

As with almost all mining ventures, there are a large number of risks and opportunities that can affect 

the outcome of the project. Most of these risks and opportunities are based on uncertainty, such as 

lack of scientific information (test results, drill results, etc.) or the lack of control over external factors 

(metal price, exchange rates, etc.). 



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 174 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

Subsequent higher-level engineering studies would be required to further refine these risks and 

opportunities, identify new risks and opportunities, and define strategies for risk mitigation or 

opportunity implementation. 

The principal risks identified for the Springpole Gold Project are summarized as follows: 

 Geological interpretation and mineral resource classification (10% of the resources used in the 

mine plan are Inferred); 

 Due to a relatively small number of metallurgical samples tested, larger variations in mineralogy 

and metal recovery may exist than have been observed to date; 

 Geotechnical and hydrogeological considerations; 

 No information on baseline groundwater quality; 

 No physical characterization of the tailings material has been done; 

 Construction management and cost containment during development of the project; 

 The permitting period associated with the project could be significantly longer than assumed in 

this study; 

 Increased OPEX and/or CAPEX; and 

 Reduced metal prices. 

 Project Opportunities 

The following opportunities may improve the project economics: 

 Metallurgical testwork has indicated that gold recoveries up to 90% are possible with a finer 

grind. Trade-off studies should be carried out to determine whether it's feasible to incorporate a 

finer grind process into the flowsheet; 

 Pit optimization work with the Whittle software identified a number of larger potential pit shells (or 

phases) and the selected pit shell provides higher grades, lower strip ratio, and reduced capital 

and operating expense; 

 Recently completed geotechnical drilling for pit slope stability analysis may increase pit slopes 

angles over those used in this PEA; 

 There are other geophysical targets around the current resource, particularly to the southwest of 

the current resource. Additional drilling has the potential to add resources; 

 Investigations may reveal that sufficient quantities of low permeability material for core 

construction may be available on-site and bedrock may be located at a shallower depth than 

assumed in the cost estimate; 

 Lake dewatering could occur at a faster rate if the water was discharged into several different 

lakes; 

 The potential to upgrade the mineral resource classification of the deposit; and 

 Improved metal prices.

25 Recommendations 

SRK recommends the following next phase work program for the Springpole Gold Project. 

25.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Program 

SRK recommends a remedial program of re-sampling of the core for the pre-2007 drilling with focus 

on the mineralized intervals, to replace the missing field and pulp duplicate information and including 

appropriate insertion of blanks and standards that would demonstrate compliance with current NI 43-

101 standards. The drill hole density in these areas is more than adequate for generating resource 

categories above inferred; all that is missing is adequate demonstration of reproducibility of results.  

SRK recommends that a silver standard be introduced as a regular routine with all new assay 

batches sent to the laboratory for analysis. SRK recommends that Gold Canyon consider re-

assaying some of the available pulps with a silver standard to assure the robustness of the silver 

data in the Springpole database.  

SRK recommends that Gold Canyon implements a written protocol for QA/QC data review so that 

quick action can be taken if sample batches fall outside of the acceptable QA/QC acceptance 

guidelines.  

25.2 Mineral Resource 

SRK recommends dedicated program of s.g. measurement on core sufficient to establish 

volumetrically representative values for s.g. 

25.3 Resource Development Program 

SRK recommends a work program for the Springpole Gold Project including incremental step-out 

and infill drilling adjacent to the Portage zone, especially to the southeast and southwest to expand 

the resource and better define the extent of mineralization. This drilling will use the established drill 

section spacing of 50 m with infill between sections where deemed necessary. Assuming a total of 

38 holes with an average hole length of 400 m, this comes to 15,200 m. This drilling could be 

accomplished within a 12-month period. Drilling can be undertaken from the ice during the winter 

and utilizing Gold Canyon's four drill barges during spring, summer and fall. In addition to drilling in 

and around the Portage zone, an additional 5,000 m of drilling should be allocated to testing new 

exploration targets, especially ones proximal to the existing deposits. 

The recommended work program is expected to cost approximately $11.5M as outlined in Table 

25.1.

25.4 Metallurgical Testwork Program 

Additional testwork needs to be done to confirm cyanide detoxification can be completed 

successfully and within normal reagent cost levels. Thickening and filtering characteristics should be 

confirmed so that unexpected dewatering costs are not needed. For whole feed leaching, the plant 

tailings will likely be acid generating and the associated costs with treatment/handling of this material 

need to be estimated. 

Future testwork can consider concentrating the sulphides via flotation or classification into a smaller 

mass so that it can be stored separately from the remainder of the tailings. For example, dry stack or 

subaqueous deposition in the tailings pond to minimise the potential for acid generation. 

A well-defined metallurgical testwork program can address these items and determine if there are 

any issues that may impact the overall economics. It is expected that such a program will cost 

between $250,000 and $500,000, depending on the number of samples included. 

25.5 Hydrogeological Characterization 

The following site investigation recommendations are standard scope items for a pre-feasibility 

study: 

 Hydraulic testing is recommended in the area between the lakes and the proposed pit, with the 

main objective to identify and focus testwork on larger scale geological features with the 

potential to act as hydraulically transmissive conduits for groundwater inflows. This work should 

be done in conjunction with a concession scale structural assessment and any geophysical 

surveys that are available. 

  



2CG026.000 – Gold Canyon 
Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Springpole Gold Project, Canada Page 177 

 

 

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

 Secondary objectives would be to characterise the hydrogeological properties of the bedrock, 

which will be used to constrain estimates of groundwater inflow. This work should continue the 

PFS data collection for the geotechnical program, which consisted of packer testing within the pit 

area. Drill holes for testing should be located during site investigation programs for the TMF and 

waste rock dumps. The testing program should consider: 

 Short-duration tests within all geotechnical drill holes (e.g., packer testing). 

 Short-duration tests within at least two hydrogeological drill holes targeting areas outside of 

open pit area.  

 Contingency should be included for longer-term testing (e.g., airlift testing) with observation 

wells if preliminary analyses indicate that there are areas with relatively high permeability. 

Final design of this program will not be possible until the structural review is completed. 

SRK estimates the cost of this hydrogeological characterization program to be $60,000 assuming 

that a drilling rig is on site and a five hole program will take six weeks to complete. This cost does 

not include long-term test pumping. 

 Groundwater monitoring. Groundwater monitoring wells to be sited and installed with well 

screens to isolate key aquifer horizons. The construction of the wells should take into 

consideration any overburden and geology that is encountered. Multi-depth wells should be 

considered in key areas to monitor water levels in significant overburden and bedrock lithology. 

Locations of the wells should be up-gradient and down-gradient of any mine infrastructure. Wells 

should be constructed to best practise guidelines to ensure that sampling, hydraulic testing and 

groundwater measurements are representative of the zone they are in. A water level monitoring 

database should be established with regular measurements taken on a weekly basis. This can 

either be done manually with a water level meter, or automatically by installing pressure 

transducers with integrated dataloggers into selected boreholes. A combination of these 

methods is recommended to ensure calibration against logger readings. 

 Groundwater quality Groundwater quality should be characterized to establish baseline 

conditions using the monitoring wells described in the preceding paragraph, and should consider 

shallow (within overburden) and deep (base of pit) groundwater regimes. This work is typically 

undertaken as part of the environmental baseline study. Water quality data will be used in the 

load balance, and in cost estimates for potential treatment options. This work should be initiated 

as soon as possible to ensure seasonal groundwater data are captured. 

A site water balance is recommended to be developed at an early stage so that all aspects of 

groundwater, surface water and process water around the project site are quantified.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

25.6 Hydrological Monitoring 

It is recommended that the following be installed at the Springpole site to obtain a better 

understanding of the site hydrology and to help define the specific site water management 

requirements in the future phases of the project: 

 Gauging stations at the outflows from Springpole Lake 

 Meteorological station 

This monitoring will also be required for baseline studies to support the environmental assessment. 

SRK's estimate for the cost of these two automated level sensors is approximately $100,000. 

25.7 Tailings Management Facility 

It is recommended that the following studies be undertaken to confirm the tailings management plan 

design: 

 Complete a detailed geotechnical/geohydrological investigation of the tailings management 

facility including boreholes and test pits. Packer testing, and in situ characterization is required, 

as well as sampling and submitting of samples to geotechnical testing laboratories for 

engineering property classification. It is estimated that the cost of this program is likely to be 

$200,000 to $300,000. 

 Carry out detailed physical and rheological testing on representative tailings samples to confirm 

the thickening characteristics of the tailings and the ultimate beach angle. The cost of this 

program is estimated to be $30,000 to $60,000. 

 Carry out a preliminary borrow source characterization study to identify candidate construction 

materials (including for the dewatering dike and main access road route). This should include an 

initial air photo interpretation, followed up by preliminary ground reconnaissance. This study is 

estimated to cost between $50,000 and $100,000. 

25.8 Dewatering Dike 

A comprehensive geotechnical investigation must be carried out at the proposed dike locations to 

confirm foundation conditions. The investigation method must be capable of determining the in-situ 

geotechnical properties of the lake bed sediments and other overburden. Samples must be retrieved 

for laboratory testing. The cost of this program is estimated between $180,000 and $280,000. 

25.9 Infrastructure 

A reconnaissance survey of the road and power line routes need to be carried out to confirm the 

general ground conditions at these sites. The cost of this is estimated to be $10,000 to $25,000 

depending on how much helicopter support would be required. In addition, a geotechnical 

investigation needs to be carried out at the two major river crossing sites to confirm foundation 

conditions. The cost of this investigation is estimated to be $75,000 to $150,000.

AD/NW 2CG026 000_Springpole_PEA_TechnicalReport_20161014_FNL October 7, 2016 

25.10 Environmental Studies 

In support of the exploration activities and to support future EA processes and permits, Gold Canyon 

has initiated a variety of environmental studies to collect environmental data to characterize both the 

physical and biological environments. The studies include the following areas: meteorology, air 

quality, noise, hydrology, hydrogeology, geochemistry, terrestrial resources, fisheries resources, 

socio-economic, archaeology, and sediment, benthos and surface water quality. 

25.11 Economic Evalutation Recommendations 

For future studies, as the input data become more precise and accurate, SRK recommends that a 

correct practice of modelling tax depreciation, working capital, VAT and any cash flows involving the 

carry forward or carry back of balances is undertaken in nominal terms using a reasonable forecast 

of currency inflation. 

25.12 Estimated Total Cost of Recommendations

25.13 Closure 

SRK believes the project should be taken to the next level of engineering study and economic 

assessment, typically a pre-feasibility study. It is estimated that a pre-feasibility, along with all of the 

accompanying engineering work would cost approximately $3.5M (exclusive of the 

recommendations listed above and the additional geology and drilling program required). Some of 

the activities involved to advance the project include: 

 Initiate project permitting; 

 Consummate agreements with First Nations groups; and 

 Convert remaining inferred resources to indicated resources.

Dear Sirs/Mesdames:

Re: Gold Canyon Resources Inc. - Short Form Prospectus Offering

We have acted as local counsel in the Province of Ontario for Gold Canyon
Resources Inc. (the "Corporation") in connection with certain searches and investigations of
title to:

1. certain patented lands, listed in Appendix A of this letter, in which we are advised
the Corporation has an interest (collectively, the "Patented Lands"), which
interest is registered or unregistered, as set forth below; and

2. certain unpatented mining claims registered in the name of the Corporation, listed
in Appendix B of this letter (the "Unpatented Claims").

We have subsearched title to the Patented Lands and have reviewed uncertified
copies of the Mining Recorder's electronic registers for the Unpatented Claims (the "Ontario
Mine Claim Database") developed and maintained by the Mines and Mineral Division of the
Ministry of Northern Development, Mines and Forestry (the "Ministry") and have relied upon
the instruments of record available for public examination in the Land Registry Office of the
Land Titles Division of Kenora. In addition, we have searched for executions outstanding



 
 

MBDOCS_5999845.4 

against the registered owners of the Patented Lands with the Sheriff for the Judicial District of 
Kenora as of June 29, 2012.   

As instructed, we have made no other searches, investigations or inquires with 
respect to the opinions expressed herein including, without limitation, any inquiries as to access 
and inquires of authorities regarding realty taxes, provincial land taxes, mining taxes, fees 
exigible as expressed on the Crown grant such as assurance fees, building and zoning 
compliance, utilities, unregistered easements, conservation or environmental matters.  In 
addition, we have not examined any surveys of the Patented Lands or the Unpatented Claims for 
the purposes of this opinion and have not reviewed any of the encumbrances outstanding against 
the Patented Lands or the Unpatented Claims.  In particular, we have not made any searches of 
adjoining lands to the Patented Lands to confirm compliance with the Planning Act (Ontario). 

In conducting the searches and giving the opinions contained herein, we have 
assumed: 

1. The authenticity of all documents that were submitted to us as originals; 

2. The conformity with originals of all documents submitted or presented to us as 
certified or notarial copies; 

3. The identity and capacity of all individuals acting or purporting to act as public 
officials; 

4. The genuineness and authenticity of all signatures on all documents submitted or 
presented to us;  and 

5. The accuracy and completeness of the records maintained by any office of public 
record.   

For greater clarity, our opinion is an independent opinion of our firm, however, to 
the extent that the uncertified copies of the Unpatented Claims posted in the Ontario Mine Claim 
Database developed and maintained by the Ministry are based on any assumptions or are subject 
to any limitations, qualifications or exceptions, our opinion given in reliance thereon is also 
based on each assumption and our opinion is made subject to each such limitation, qualification 
or exception. Further information regarding the Mining Claims Database developed and 
maintained by the Ministry can be found on the Ministry's website. 

We are solicitors qualified in the Province of Ontario, Canada and accordingly no 
opinion is expressed herein as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than Ontario and the laws of 
Canada applicable thereto. 

Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications noted below and 
expressed in the schedules attached, we are of the opinion that: 

1. As of June 28, 2012 (being the date of our searches), the registered owners of the 
Patented Lands are as indicated in Appendix A under the subheading 'Springpole 



mcmman
combining Ling Michrnci h ^ ' d n d McMilirin i

Group' subject to the General Permitted Encumbrances and the specific
encumbrances listed in Appendix A;

2. As of June 28, 2012 (being the date of our searches), the registered owners of the
Patented Lands are as indicated in Appendix A under the subheadings 'Frahm
Group' and 'Gold Canyon Group', subject to the General Permitted
Encumbrances and the specific encumbrances listed in Appendix A; and

3. As of June 28, 2012 (being the date of our searches), the Corporation is listed as
the registered owner of the Unpatented Claims, in the proportions listed in
Appendix B, subject to the encumbrances, work required and due dates listed in
Appendix B.

Qualifications

The opinions expressed above are subject to the following qualifications:

1. We make reference to an Option Agreement dated September 9, 2004 between the
Corporation, Everett Williams, Patricia Williams, Douglas Hamblin, Lilian
Hamblin, Neil Gaarder, Walter Howard, Dorothy Howard, Tim Howard, Suzanne
Howard and The Springpole Company (the "Springpole Option Agreement").
There are certain discrepancies between the registered owners of the properties
listed in Schedule "B" to the Springpole Option Agreement and registered owners
disclosed by our searches. Further detail is provided in the exhibits attached
hereto. We provide no opinion with respect to the discrepancy and have reported
herein on the basis of registered ownership.

This opinion is for the use of the addressee only in connection with the
qualification for sale to the public of 1,950,000 common shares of the Corporation, 7,150,000
flow-through shares of the Corporation together with an over-allotment option to issue and sell
up to an additional 1,331,000 flow-through shares of the Corporation pursuant to an underwriting
agreement dated effective June 15. 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the
Corporation and a syndicate of underwriters co-led by CIBC World Markets Inc. and Eraser
Mackenzie Limited, and including Dundee Securities Ltd., Haywood Securities Inc. and
Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC (collectively, the "Underwriters") and may not be relied upon
by or shown to any other party for any purpose without our prior written consent.

This opinion is provided at the request of the Underwriters pursuant to subsection
6.1(k)(v) of the Underwriting Agreement.

Yours truly,
