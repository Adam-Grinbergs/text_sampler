B2Gold's operations; anticipated cash flows from the Otjikoto Mine and related liquidity 
requirements; the anticipated effect of external factors on revenue, such as commodity prices, 
estimation of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, mine life projections, reclamation 
costs, economic outlook, government regulation of mining operations; expectations regarding 
community relations and social licence to operate; and any other forward-looking statements 
identified in Sections 1.11, 1.13, 1.14, 1.17, 1.20, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 25, and 26 of this 
Technical Report, as well as the tables included thereunder.  All statements in this Technical 
Report that address events or developments that B2Gold expects to occur in the future are 
forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical 
facts and are generally, although not always, identified by words such as "expect", "plan", 
"anticipate", "project", "target", "potential", "schedule", "forecast", "budget", "estimate", "intend" 
or "believe" and similar expressions or their negative connotations, or that events or conditions 
"will", "would", "may", "could", "should" or "might" occur.  All such forward-looking statements 
are based on the opinions and estimates of B2Gold's management as of the date such 
statements are made.  All of the forward-looking statements in this Technical Report are 
qualified by this cautionary note. 
 
Forward-looking statements are not, and cannot be, a guarantee of future results or events.  
Forward-looking statements are based on, among other things, opinions, assumptions, 
estimates and analyses that, while considered reasonable at the date the forward-looking 
statements is provided, inherently are subject to significant risks, uncertainties, contingencies 
and other factors that may cause actual results and events to be materially different from those 
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  The material factors or assumptions 
that B2Gold identified and were applied by B2Gold in drawing conclusions or making forecasts 
or projections set out in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the 
factors identified in Sections 1.10, 1.11, 14 and 25 (and the tables identified thereunder) of this 
Technical Report, which may affect the Mineral Resource estimate; the forward-looking 
statements and factors identified in Sections 1.12, 1.13, 15 and 25 (and the tables identified 
thereunder) of this Technical Report which may affect the Mineral Reserve estimate; the 
metallurgical recovery assumptions identified in Section 13 of this Technical Report; the 
assumptions identified in Table 14-4 of this Technical Report as being used in evaluating 
prospects for eventual economic extraction; the assumptions identified in Section 15.3 of this 
Technical Report as forming the basis for converting Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves, 
as well as the assumptions identified in Section 15.5; the design and equipment assumptions 
identified in Table or Figure 17-1 and 17-2 of this Technical Report; the general assumptions 
identified in Sections 1.14, 1.16, 1.19, 16, 21 and 25 of this Technical Report, as well as the 
tables included therein; dilution and mining recovery assumptions; assumptions regarding 
stockpiles; the success of mining, processing, exploration and development activities; the 
accuracy of geological, mining and metallurgical estimates; anticipated metals prices and the 
costs of production; no significant unanticipated operational or technical difficulties; the 



execution of B2Gold's business and growth strategies, including the success of B2Gold's 
strategic investments and initiatives; the availability of additional financing, if needed; the 
availability of personnel for exploration, development, and operational projects and ongoing 
employee relations; maintaining good relations with the communities surrounding the Otjikoto 
Mine; no significant unanticipated events or changes relating to regulatory, environmental, 
health and safety matters; no contests over title to B2Gold's properties; no significant 
unanticipated litigation; certain tax matters; and no significant and continuing adverse changes 
in general economic conditions or conditions in the financial markets (including commodity 
prices and foreign exchange rates). 
 
The risks, uncertainties, contingencies and other factors that may cause actual results to differ 
materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements may include, but 
are not limited to, risks generally associated with the mining industry, such as economic factors 
(including future commodity prices, currency fluctuations, energy prices and general cost 
escalation), uncertainties related to the continued development and operation of the Otjikoto 
Mine, dependence on key personnel and employee relations; risks related to political or social 
unrest or change; operational risks and hazards, including unanticipated environmental, 
industrial and geological events and developments and the inability to insure against all risks; 
failure of plant, equipment, processes, transportation and other infrastructure to operate as 
anticipated; compliance with government and environmental regulations, including permitting 
requirements and anti-bribery legislation; depletion of Mineral Reserves; volatile financial 
markets that may affect B2Gold's ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms; the 
failure to obtain required approvals or clearances from government authorities on a timely 
basis; uncertainties related to the geology, continuity, grade and estimates of Mineral Reserves 
and Mineral Resources, and the potential for variations in grade and recovery rates; uncertain 
costs of reclamation activities, and the final outcome thereof; tax refunds; hedging transactions; 
as well as other factors identified and as described in more detail under the heading "Risk 
Factors" in B2Gold's most recent Annual Information Form and B2Gold's other filings with 
Canadian securities regulators and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which may 
be viewed at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov, respectively.   
 
The list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect B2Gold's forward-looking statements.  
There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, and actual results, 
performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, 
these forward-looking statements.  Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any events 
anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do, what 
benefits or liabilities B2Gold will derive therefrom.  B2Gold's forward looking statements reflect 
current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of 
the date hereof and B2Gold does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking 
statements if circumstances or management's beliefs, expectations or opinions should change 
other than as required by applicable law.  For the reasons set forth above, undue reliance 
should not be placed on forward-looking statements.

1.0 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 

Mr. Tom Garagan, P.Geo., Mr. Peter Montano, P.E., Mr. John Rajala, P.Eng. and Mr. 
Ken Jones, P.Eng., collectively the Qualified Persons (QPs) prepared a Technical 
Report (the Report) using Form 43-101F1 on the Otjikoto Gold Operation (Otjikoto 
Mine or the Project) for B2Gold Corp. (B2Gold).  The Otjikoto Mine is located near 
Otjiwarongo in the Republic of Namibia. 

B2Gold Namibia (Proprietary) Limited is the Namibian 100% indirectly-owned B2Gold 
operating subsidiary.  B2Gold holds a 90% attributable Project interest; the remaining 
10% interest is held by EVI Mining (Proprietary) Ltd. (EVI), a Namibian empowerment 
company.  B2Gold is operator. 

1.2 Terms of Reference 

This Report provides updated information on the operation of the Otjikoto Mine, 
including an updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimate.  The 
information will be used to support disclosures in B2Gold's Annual Information Form 
(AIF). 

Units used in the report are metric units unless otherwise noted.  Monetary units are in 
United States dollars (US$) unless otherwise stated.  Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves are classified using the 2014 edition of the Canadian Institute of Mining and 
Metallurgy (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
(the 2014 CIM Definition Standards).   

1.3 Project Setting 

The Otjikoto Mine is located 300 km north of Windhoek, the country's capital, 
approximately 70 km from the town of Otjiwarongo, and 50 km from the town of Otavi 
within the Province of Otjozondjupa in the north–central part of the Republic of 
Namibia.  The Project is centred on the Felsenquelle, Gerhardshausen, Otjikoto, 
Wolfshag, and Erhardshof farms. 

Mine-related traffic travels from both the Otavi and Otjiwarongo directions on a daily 
basis with all traffic using the B1 National Road to access the property.  Internal 
access to the mine area is via a well-maintained network of secondary roads and farm 
tracks.  Given the generally arid climate of the area, these roads are typically 
trafficable year-round.  

The area is characterized by low rainfall with extreme temperature ranges typical of an 
arid environment.  Open pit mining operations are conducted year-round, as are

exploration programs.  Isolated heavy rainfall events may cause temporary halts in 
activity. 

The mine site is located at an elevation of 1,500–1,510 masl.  The greater part of the 
Project area falls within the tree and shrub savannah zone, which is listed as the 
dominant vegetation type in central Namibia.  The mine site is situated just north of a 
local surface water divide.  However, there are no well-defined surface water drainage 
features on the site and no major surface water flows or defined channel flows have 
occurred, or are expected other than local events after heavy rainfall.   

There is sufficient surface area for the open pits, waste rock storage facilities 
(WRSFs), plant, tailings storage facilities (TSFs), associated infrastructure and other 
operational requirements for the planned life-of-mine (LOM) and mine plan (LOMP) 
discussed in this Report. 

1.4 Mineral Tenure, Surface Rights, Water Rights, Royalties and Agreements 

The four exclusive prospecting licences (EPLs) and one mining licence (ML) that make 
collectively form the Otjikoto Mine cover an area of approximately 254,442 ha. 

Maintaining mining lease ML169 requires annual fee payments and filing of bi-annual 
environmental reports with the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET), 
development of a work program, environmental compliance, commitment to seek local 
suppliers for fuel and lubricants, approval of the product take-off agreement, and 
payment of taxes by permanent employees in Namibia.  Maintaining the EPLs requires 
annual fee payments and submission of quarterly exploration activity reports. 

B2Gold owns the surface rights of the five farms in the vicinity of the mining 
operations.  Annual land taxes are payable on the farms.  Where exploration activities 
are conducted on ground where the surface rights are held by third parties, B2Gold 
typically enters into compensation agreements for any land disturbance with the 
surface rights owner. 

A water permit, (#10971) which allowed a maximum abstraction of 1.4 Mm3 per annum 
from selected groundwater wells, was granted in 2013 for clearing and construction 
purposes.  In May, 2018, a revised #10971 permit was granted, allowing for 4.4 Mm3 
per annum water extraction from selected groundwater wells subject to certain 
monitoring and reporting conditions.  This permit is current for two years, expiring in 
2020, and providing all conditions are met, can be renewed. 

The Namibian Minerals Act levies a royalty of 3% on the net sales of gold and silver.  
There is also a 1% export levy on gross gold revenue.  The Otjikoto Project is not 
subject to any other back-in rights payments, agreements or encumbrances.

To the extent known, there are no other significant factors and risks that may affect 
access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the Project that have not been 
discussed in this Report. 

1.5 Geology and Mineralization 

The Otjikoto and Wolfshag deposits are considered to be examples of orogenic-style 
gold deposits. 

The major regional structure is the Damara Mobile Belt, which can be divided into a 
number of sub-parallel tectonostratigraphic zones, separated by regional lineaments.  
The Otjikoto Mine area is primarily within the Damara sequence tectonostratigraphic 
zone referred to as the Northern Zone.  The Otjikoto area is predominantly underlain 
by lithologies belonging to the Neoproterozoic Swakop Group, which has been divided 
into three sub-groups, the Ugab, Usakos, and Navachab Subgroups.  The Okonguarri 
Formation within the Usakos Subgroup hosts the gold mineralization and is overlain 
and underlain by distinctive glacial diamictite horizons of the Ghaub (Navachab 
Subgroup and Chuos (Usakos Subgroup) Formations, respectively.  Unconformably 
overlying the Damara sequence are basin-fill lithologies of the late Carboniferous to 
middle Jurassic Karoo Supergroup.  The Karoo Group rocks are in turn unconformably 
overlain by Cenozoic Kalahari sands, and isolated undifferentiated recent sediments 
(sand, calcrete, gravel and alluvial deposits. 

The Okonguarri Formation is regionally metamorphosed to greenschist facies, and can 
locally be thermally metamorphosed to mid-amphibolite facies where granitic bodies 
have intruded the unit.  In the mine area, the metamorphic grade reaches middle 
amphibolite-facies, associated with hydrothermal fluid flow. 

B2Gold geological staff have identified a number of intrusions from geophysical data.  
These intrusions are tentatively ascribed to the Otjiwarongo Batholith, a poorly-
documented assemblage of granites (quartz monzonite, biotite granite), alkali granite, 
pegmatite, quartz syenite and minor granodiorite.  The known granite intrusions are 
situated south of EPL4309, and have not been observed within the general mine area. 

Three structural regimes are recognized:  recumbent folding (D1), a series of major 
doubly-plunging anticlines and synclines (D2), and a doming event (D3). Most of the 
Damara faults mapped in the Otjiwarongo-Otavi Region appear to be related to the D2 
deformational event.  The main structural control on the Otjikoto–Wolfshag 
mineralization is interpreted to be parasitic fold hinges between bedding parallel 
thrusts.   

Alteration styles recognized include albitization and amphibole-style, as well as late-
stage carbonate.

Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report

Surficial deposits of leached accumulations of calcium carbonate and calcrete occur 
over all of the deposit area and range in depth from 2–15 m.  The oxidation depth 
commonly ranges from 20–40 m with an average of about 35 m.  The transition to 
fresh rock is generally fairly rapid, within 1–4 m.  There can be instances of deeper 
oxidation in association with fracture and/or fault zones. 

The Otjikoto deposit has a strike extent of 2.6 km and has been drill tested to 475 m 
depth below surface.  Most of the gold is hosted by a north–northeast striking, thin 
(<10 cm) sheeted sulphide (+ magnetite)–quartz + carbonate vein system developed 
in schist (variably albitised) and granofels of the Upper and Middle Okonguarri 
Formation.  High-grade ore shoots occur on the short limbs and within the hinges of 
intrafolial folds between planar beds.  The folded veins and related high-grade gold 
mineralization occur in a series of distinct en-echelon zones oriented at approximately 
010° to 020° north–northeast and plunging at 10–15° (average 12°) to the south–
southwest.  Gold occurs within the vein system as coarse native gold with a size 
variation from 5 µm to 400 µm, with the median at about 100 µm.  In the shallower and 
northern portions of the deposit, the veins are pyrite-rich, while in the southern and 
deeper levels of the deposit the veins are pyrrhotite-dominant. 

The Wolfshag deposit has a strike extent of 2.1 km and has been drill tested to 700 m 
depth below surface.  The deposit consists of a series of fold-duplicated mineralized 
zones hosted in west–northwest or east–southeast-verging fold closure zones.  High-
grade shoots within the mineralised zones are associated with parasitic folds occurring 
within the larger fold structure.  Gold mineralization can be vein-hosted, or represent 
replacement or disseminated styles.  Vein-hosted mineralization consists of pyrite–
calcite + magnetite veins.  Locally the veins are folded which is related to higher gold 
grades.  Shear veining usually contains a mix of both replacement and vein style 
mineralization with both brittle (brecciation) and ductile deformation textures.  The 
replacement style mineralization ranges from moderate, disseminated, to massive 
pyrite and/or magnetite replacement of calcareous bands and/or marbles.  
Replacement mineralization tends to be lower grade and is commonly gradational with 
the shear vein style.  Disseminated mineralization tends to be lower grade with fine- to 
medium-grained magnetite more dominant than fine-grained pyrite. 

1.6 History 

The first regional gold-focused exploration activity commenced in 1995.  Work 
completed by Avdale Namibia (Pty) Ltd. (Avdale), Rio Algom, Teal Exploration and 
Mining (Teal), EVI, Vale, African Rainbow Minerals (ARM), Tova Ventures Inc., and 
Auryx Gold Corp. (Auryx) included geological reconnaissance, airborne magnetic 
surveys, ground magnetic, electromagnetic and induced polarization surveys, rotary 
air-blast (RAB), reverse circulation (RC) and core drilling, and Mineral Resource 
estimation.  



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report

B2Gold acquired a 100% interest in Auryx in 2011.  Since acquisition, B2Gold has 
completed additional drilling, a feasibility study in 2012, and has updated Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates.  Commercial production was declared in 
2015.  Mining is currently conducted from the Otjikoto and Wolfshag pits. 

1.7 Drilling and Sampling 

Drilling comprises a total of 2,998 holes (325,984 m), consisting of 1,256 core holes 
(260,436 m), 473 RC holes (40,851 m) and 1,206 RAB holes (23,370 m).  Of these 
totals, 242,014 m of core and RC drill data support the Mineral Resource estimate at 
Otjikoto and 122,884 m of core and RC drill data support the Mineral Resource 
estimate at Wolfshag.  No RAB drilling is used in estimation.   

Core sizes include HQ (63.5 mm core diameter, NQ (47.6 mm), TNW (60.8 mm) and 
PQ (85 mm).  Sieved RAB samples, RC chips, and core are geologically logged.  Data 
recorded for RC and core include lithology, texture, structure, alteration, oxidation 
state, and veining and mineralisation.  Geotechnical information such as total core 
recovered (TCR), rock quality designation (RQD), joint count, and rock strength is also 
recorded for core holes.  Core is photographed.  Drilling quality for both RC and 
diamond drilling is generally very good.   

Upon completion of a set of drill holes, the holes are surveyed by either a contract 
professional land surveyor or the Otjikoto mine surveyor using Total Station differential 
global positioning system (DGPS) survey instruments.  All drill holes are surveyed 
using either a single or multi-shot down hole survey instrument (e.g. Reflex Ez-shot) 
which record the azimuth (magnetic) and dip.   

Grade control drilling is undertaken in two 12-hour shifts, using contractor-operated 
127 mm diameter RC rigs.  Drill spacing varies between the two deposits.  At Otjikoto, 
a 6 m x 12 m drill spacing with a hole dip of -60º and azimuth of 302° is used.  The 
Wolfshag grade control uses an 8 x 10 m drill spacing, -60º dip and 350º azimuth.   

Drill section orientation (305° azimuth) for the Otjikoto deposit was originally set up 
perpendicular to the geophysical targets and structural fabric of the area.  The 
mineralization shoot direction was recognized at a much later stage and therefore the 
drilling sections are slightly oblique to the shoots, but not to the overall trend of the 
deposit.  The shallower portions of the deposit were drilled on a 25 m x 25 m drill grid 
and the deeper levels at 25 m x 50 m and 50 m x 100 m drill hole spacing.  Drilling on 
the Wolfshag zone used the Otjikoto grid and therefore the Wolfshag drill sections are 
also slightly oblique to the main trend of the zone.  Drill spacing at Wolfshag is 
generally 25 m x 55 m for most of the deposit with an area of 25 m x 30 m and some 
12.5 m infill on select lines targeting the nose of the upper fold.  For both deposits, 
drilling is generally perpendicular to the mineralization, and drilled thicknesses 
approximate true thicknesses.

In the opinion of the QP, the quantity and quality of the logged geological data, and the 
collar, and downhole survey data collected in the exploration and infill drill programs 
completed, are sufficient to support Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation 
and mine planning. 

RAB and RC samples are collected on 1 m intervals.  RC grade control samples are 
collected at 2 m intervals.  The majority of the core sampling on the project was done 
at 1 m sample intervals.  The minimum sample length was 30 cm for HQ- and 40 cm 
for NQ-sized core.  Three to five metres of material is sampled above and below the 
mineralized zones, and the zones are sampled continuously, without sample gaps.  
However, in narrow mineralized zones that are separated by more than 3 m, a gap in 
the sampling is allowed.   

Laboratories used over the Project history include:  Anglo American Research 
Laboratories, Johannesburg, South Africa; Chemex Laboratories, Toronto, Canada 
(now ALS Chemex); SGS Lakefield Research Africa (Pty) Ltd, Pretoria, South Africa; 
Moruo Analytical Services; Intertek Genalysis in Perth, Australia, Walvis Bay, Namibia 
and Johannesburg; ALS Global in Swakopmund, Namibia, and Johannesburg; Bureau 
Veritas, Walvis Bay; ALS Minerals, Vancouver, Canada; and the Otjikoto mine 
laboratory.  All laboratories hold ISO/IEC 17025, except for the Otjikoto mine 
laboratory, Intertek Genalysis Walvis Bay and ALS Global Swakopmund which are not 
accredited.  The accreditations for Chemex Laboratories at the time are not known.  All 
laboratories other than the Otjikoto mine laboratory are independent of B2Gold.  
Currently, sample preparation is performed at ALS Global, Swakopmund, and primary 
analysis is undertaken by ALS Global, Johannesburg.  The Otjikoto mine laboratory is 
used as an umpire (reference) laboratory. 

Sample preparation in early programs crushed to -2 mm and following pulverization, 
was screened at 106 μm.  Current protocols, in place since 2012, require crushing to 
-2 mm, then screening using a plastic screen to obtain the +106 and -106 size 
fractions.  The +106 size fraction is packaged with the plastic mesh for fire assay, as 
this step mitigates the possibility of coarse gold becoming stuck in a regular mesh 
screen.  The -106 size fraction is riffle split and packaged for shipping to the analytical 
laboratory.   

Gold grades were determined using a standard fire assay methodology with either an 
atomic absorption (AA) for samples that assayed ≤10 g/t Au or were reassayed with a 
gravimetric finish if the sample assayed ≥10 g/t Au.  Core and RC samples were sent 
for multi-element analysis.  The most frequently used methods include inductively-
coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), inductively-coupled plasma-atomic 
emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for the determination 
of precious metal, base metals and multi-element content.  Typically, the analytical 
packages include the following elements: Au, Pd, Pt, Ag, Al, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, K, Mg, 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report

Mo, Ni, P, S, Sb, Sn, Te, V, W, Zn and Zr.  Sulphur analysis was performed on select 
groups of samples using either a LECO or similar carbon and sulphur analyzer.   

As of 7 September, 2018, there were 25,633 specific gravity (SG) measurements 
available.  Methodologies used to collect the data include pycnometer laboratory 
determinations on RC and drill core pulp samples (5,168 determinations) and the 
water immersion (Archimedes) method on whole or half core.  All of the density 
determinations used in estimation are from water immersion testwork programs. 

QA/QC procedures have been in place since the start of the Project and are 
documented through procedure manuals.  Samples used include blanks, certified 
reference materials (CRMs) and duplicates.  Blanks are inserted at 1:20 rate.  The 
CRM insertion rate was based on the fusion oven charge and was 1:20 at Intertek 
Genalysis and 1:38 at ALS Minerals.  Field duplicate samples were collected at a 
frequency of 1:20.  In addition to QA/QC insertion by B2Gold and predecessors, the 
analytical laboratories also provide QA/QC data with the sample analytical certificates.  
Each sample analytical certificate was vetted by the database manager and failures 
were recorded in a table of failures.  This table lists the results of the QA/QC, any 
follow up action and final decision to include or not include the sample analytical 
certificate results in resource estimation.  All sample analytical certificate results are 
retained in the database; however, not all sample analytical certificate results can 
support Mineral Resource estimates.  Laboratories are requested to review and/or re-
run submittals until the submittal passes QA/QC.  Monthly QA/QC reports are 
prepared documenting the laboratory performance.  Current quarterly check assay 
programs include both coarse reject and minus fraction sample umpires and reject and 
pulp granulometry evaluation. 

A review of sample preparation procedures over time that was completed in 2016 
indicated that in some sample batches, coarse material was being left in the minus-
fraction submitted for assay.  As a result, in late 2016 and early 2017, a re-sampling 
and re-assaying program was undertaken, consisting of about 14,000 remnant half-
core samples.  The re-assay data replaced the original analyses in the database. 

Only authorized drill and B2Gold or predecessor personnel were allowed at the drilling 
sites.  Core was transported directly to the Otjiwarongo core yard by B2Gold or 
predecessor personnel.  The Otjiwarongo core yard is surrounded by a security fence 
with the office and complex alarmed and monitored by a local independent security 
firm.  Sample shipments are currently controlled by B2Gold exploration operations and 
database managers.  Transportation to the laboratory is done by an independent 
bonded courier company (ACT Logistics) with appropriate sign-off documentation 
accompanying each shipment at both shipping and receiving. 

Reference RC chip samples and split rejects are retained in a secure storage facility in 
Otjiwarongo or at the Otjikoto mine site.  Additional laboratory coarse rejects are 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 1-8 

 
 

retained in secure storage facilities in Johannesburg and Walvis Bay.  All logged and 
sampled drill core is kept in the core yard or secure storage facilities in Otjiwarongo or 
at the Otjikoto mine site.  Representative core intervals may be missing for portions of 
drill holes used for metallurgical and geotechnical testing.   

In the opinion of the QP, sample preparation, security, analytical procedures, QA/QC 
insertion rates, data validation steps, and core and sample storage meet or exceed 
accepted industry standards.  The data are acceptable to support Mineral Resource 
and Mineral Reserve estimates and can be used in mine planning. 

1.8 Data Verification 

Laboratory visits by B2Gold staff for the preparation laboratory are done unannounced 
on a monthly basis.  For the analytical laboratory, an independent consultant is also 
contracted to do unannounced monthly visits.  Monthly QA/QC reports are prepared by 
designated database managers.  Prior to conducting Mineral Resource estimates, the 
modellers and estimators also undertake verification checks. 

A number of independent technical reports were prepared on the Project, prior to 
B2Gold obtaining an interest in the Project.  No material issues with the data were 
identified in these reports. B2Gold prepared a technical report in 2013, detailing the 
results of a completed 2012 feasibility study.  Investigations and data validation in 
support of the feasibility study identified no material issues with the information 
available at the time. 

As part of site visits from 2011–2018, the QP has personally verified a portion of the 
data supporting the estimates, including:  RC drilling and sampling procedures at the 
rig during drilling; core drilling at various drills and the core retrieval and handling 
procedures; core logging and markup procedures and protocols; core photography 
procedures and quality; core cutting and sampling procedures; core storage and 
security; SG measurement and SG QA/QC procedures; sample shipping and chain of 
custody procedures; data entry and data verification procedures; and accuracy of 
geological interpretations and grade interpretations on section and plan, and in 
geological models.  

The QP is of the opinion that the data are considered acceptable to support Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, and can be used for mine planning 
purposes. 

1.9 Metallurgical Testwork 

Metallurgical testwork was carried out in support of plant design to treat material from 
the Otjikoto deposit.  Additional testwork conducted on mineralization from the 
Wolfshag deposit indicated that no major plant design changes were warranted to 
allow for treatment of this ore. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 1-9 

 
 

Testwork completed has included: bottle roll tests; comminution (JKTech drop weight, 
SMC, Bond ball, Bond rod, Bond low-energy impact, Bond abrasion, unconfined 
compressive strength); grind circuit modelling; bulk mineralogy (X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electron microscopy 
(QEMSCAN)); gold deportment (mineral speciation, grain size, liberation, and 
association); extended-gravity recoverable gold; gravity separation and leaching; 
cyanide destruction; rheology; and tailings characterization.  Laboratories performing 
with the testwork have included ALS Minerals, SGS Lakefield, and FLSmidth. 

Samples selected for metallurgical testing were representative of the various types and 
styles of mineralization within the different zones.  Samples were selected from a 
range of locations within the deposit zones.  Sufficient samples were taken so that 
tests were performed on sufficient sample mass. 

Average life-of-mine gold recoveries were estimated to be 95.6%.  During operations, 
the process plant has been optimized, and is reliably achieving 98% recoveries.  

There are no deleterious elements known that would affect process activities or 
metallurgical recoveries. 

1.10 Mineral Resource Estimation 

Mineral Resource estimates are reported from two block models, the combined 
Otjikoto and Wolfshag open pit model and the Wolfshag underground model.  The 
Otjikoto and Wolfshag open pit models were built in 2015 and 2018, respectively, and 
combined into one model for Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve pit shell runs and 
reporting.  Core and RC data are used to support the Mineral Resource estimates.   

For the Otjikoto deposit, mineralized zones were created using lithology, vein percent, 
sulphide abundance and gold grade at a nominal 0.3 g/t Au cut-off.  Mineralized zone 
wireframes were identified by the thrust block in which they occur.  Using logged rock 
type and oxidation from exploration drill holes, surfaces were created for the base of 
calcrete, transition, oxide and mixed.  The bottom of calcrete surface was used as a 
top to the thrust and mineralized zone wireframes.  Metallurgical domains are defined 
by oxidation state and dominant sulphide composition (pyrite/pyrrhotite).   

For the Wolfshag deposit, two nested shells were created based on a combination of 
grade and vein intensity.  These were a low grade (LG) domain at a nominal 
0.2 g/t Au, and a high grade (HG) domain at a nominal 1 g/t Au.  For the open pit 
model, only the LG domain was used as a boundary in the gold grade estimate.  A 
stratigraphic/structural model was created based on all available geological data.  
Within each of the modeled stratigraphic units, lithology was assigned by interpolating 
indicators for each major rock type.  Weathering and oxidation surfaces were created 
from simplified drill logs.  Metallurgical domains are defined by oxidation state and 
dominant sulphide composition.   



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 1-10 

 
 

Bulk densities applied to the Otjikoto block model vary by lithology, mineralization, and 
oxidation state, ranging from 2.43 in hardpan to 2.84 in sulphide-mineralized albitite.  
For Wolfshag, densities were interpolated where sufficient data was available. 
Densities range from 1.9 in soil to 2.98 in some of the Wolfshag high-grade zones. 
Capping levels were selected based on decile analysis, lognormal probability plots and 
spatial review of high grades.  Capping was applied to assays prior to down-hole 
compositing.  For Otjikoto low grade domains, capping ranged from 4–6 g/t Au and for 
high grade domains capping ranged from 5–40 g/t Au.  For Wolfshag, capping values 
ranged from 0–1 g/t Au in marble/waste, and 2–50 g/t Au in high-grade zones. 

Down-hole composites were set at 2 m lengths.  Variograms (correlograms) were run 
using spherical models.   

Otjikoto gold grade estimates are based on a combination of ordinary kriging (OK) of 
an indicator (at 0.8–0.9 g/t Au) and OK of the high- and low-grade components of the 
indicator.  Wolfshag grades for the open pit model were estimated using OK.  Model 
validation included visual comparison of composites to the block model on screen and 
paper plots (sections and long sections), comparison of nearest neighbor and block 
model statistics at zero cut-off, comparison of interpolation methods by easting, 
northing and elevation on "swath" plots, change of support checks and reconciliation to 
grade control models.   

No Measured Mineral Resources were classified.  Indicated and Inferred Mineral 
Resources were classified based on drill spacing.  Any blocks not classified as 
Indicated or Inferred were reset to a grade of 0.03 g/t Au (mean and median of waste 
assays) prior to pit optimization and mine planning. 

The Otjikoto and Wolfshag open pit sub-cell models were combined into one large 
sub-celled model in Datamine.  The combined model was converted to a whole-block 
(single grade per block) regularized model to the parent block size of 6 x 12 x 3.33 m.  
The average gold grade and the density for each whole block were calculated based 
on the volume-weighted average of all sub-cells within the parent cell.  Categorical 
codes such as lithology, resource classification, and metallurgical domains were 
applied to the whole block model based on the dominant code inside the parent block.  
Due to a combination of the modeling methodology (~0.2 g/t Au shells, and no HG), 
block size and cut-off grades (operational cut-off of 0.25 g/t Au), most dilution is built 
into the resource model.  Diluting tonnes are offset by grade loss due to grade 
reduction (e.g. if the pre-diluted grade was above a grade threshold (cut-off), the 
diluted grade would be below that grade threshold). 

The down-plunge extension of Wolfshag mineralization is considered an underground 
mining target.  The model uses the same construction approach as recorded for the 
Wolfshag open pit; however, high-grade zones were used in the underground model.  
Gold grades were estimated using inverse distance weighting to the third power (ID3).  



 Otjikoto Gold Mine

Model checks included a visual review of block model grades relative to composite 
grades, comparison of nearest neighbor and block model statistics at zero cut-off and 
comparison of interpolation methods by easting, northing and elevation on "swath" 
plots .  No Measured Mineral Resources are reported.  Indicated and Inferred Mineral 
Resources were classified based on drill spacing.   

Mineral Resources considered potentially amenable to open pit mining methods were 
constrained within a conceptual pit shell. Mineral Resources potentially amenable to 
open pit mining are stated above a cut-off of 0.4 g/t Au. 

Mineral Resources considered amenable to underground mining methods are reported 
outside the conceptual pit shell used for reporting Mineral Resources and above a cut-
off of 2.6 g/t Au.   

1.11 Mineral Resource Statement 

Indicated Mineral Resources are reported in Table 1-1, inclusive of those Indicated 
Mineral Resources converted to Probable Mineral Reserves.  Mineral Resources that 
are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

Inferred Mineral Resources are provided in Table 1-2. 

The QP for the resource estimate is Mr. Tom Garagan, P.Geo., Senior Vice President, 
Exploration, who is an employee of B2Gold.  The Qualified Person for the stockpiles 
estimate is Mr. Peter Montano, P.E., Project Director, who is also an employee of 
B2Gold.  The stockpiles reported include the run-of-mine (ROM) and low-grade (LG) 
stockpiles. 

Factors that may affect the estimates include metal price and exchange rate 
assumptions; changes to the assumptions used to generate the gold grade cut-off 
grade; changes in local interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of 
mineralized zones; changes to density and domain assignments; changes to 
geological and mineralization shape and geological and grade continuity assumptions; 
geometallurgical and oxidation assumptions; changes to geotechnical, mining and 
metallurgical recovery assumptions; change to the input and design parameter 
assumptions that pertain to the conceptual pit and stope designs constraining the 
estimates; and assumptions as to the continued ability to access the site, retain 
mineral and surface rights titles, maintain environment and other regulatory permits, 
and maintain the social license to operate.

1.12 Mineral Reserve Estimation 

Mineral Reserve estimates assume open pit mining methods.  Indicated Mineral 
Resources within the final pit design limits were converted to Probable Mineral 
Reserves. 

B2Gold developed the parameters used in the Mineral Reserve estimation from 
operating experience at Otjikoto.  Cost estimates and other parameters are based on 
the LOMP which uses 2018 contract labour rates that were ratified in the second 
quarter (Q2) of 2018.  Process recoveries used in the estimate are based on historical 
production.  Export levies and royalties are based on current Namibian laws and 
agreements.  The merged Otjikoto and Wolfshag block model from August 2018 was 
the basis for the tonnage and grade estimates.  

Pit optimization was performed using the Lerchs–Grossmann (L–G) algorithm in 
Whittle software, at a base case gold price of US$1,250/oz Au.  Optimization 
parameters reflect the Mineral Reserve price, an export levy (1%) and Government of 
Namibia royalty (3%), and the LOMP operating and sustaining capital costs.  
Sustaining capital costs were defined as the capital costs required to stay in business, 
including rebuilding and replacing equipment as necessary, and were included in the 
validation optimization.  

The Mineral Reserve estimate is based on applying a 0.45 g/t Au mill cut-off grade to 
the LOM production schedule.  B2Gold defines the mill cut-off as the gold grade 
required to cover non-mining costs after process recoveries, selling costs, royalties 
and export levies are applied.  Non-mining costs were defined as stockpile re-handle, 
processing and G&A operating and plant and facilities sustaining capital costs.   

The LOM schedule includes stockpiling low-grade material to be processed at the end 
of the project and that will be processed as needed to maintain processing throughput 
rates.  Part of this material is not included in the Mineral Reserve estimate because the 
grade is below the mill cut-off.  However, the material was included in the LOMP to 
provide operational flexibility in a higher gold price environment.  Processing of this 
material will be based on the economics at the time. 

1.13 Mineral Reserve Statement 

Mineral Reserves are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.  The QP for 
the estimate is Mr. Peter Montano, P.E., Project Director, a B2Gold employee.  Mineral 
Reserves are reported with an effective date of 31 December, 2018 in Table 1-3, using 
a gold cut-off grade of 0.45 g/t Au.

1. The Qualified Person for the estimate is Mr. Peter Montano, P.E., who is B2Gold's Project Director.   

2. Mineral Reserves are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards. 

3. Mineral Reserves have an effective date of 31 December, 2018, and are reported on a 100% basis.  B2Gold holds 
a 90% attributable interest and EVI holds a 10% attributable interest. 

4. Mineral Reserves are based on a conventional open pit mining method, gold price of US$1,250/oz, metallurgical 
recovery of 98%, selling costs of $51.44/oz including royalties and levies, average mining cost of $2.29/t mined, 
average processing cost of $12.99/t processed, and site general costs of $3.25/t processed.  Reserve model 
dilution and ore loss was applied through whole block averaging such that at a 0.45 g/t cut-off there is a 2.3% 
decrease in tonnes, a 2.2% reduction in grade, and 4.4% reduction in ounces when compared to the Mineral 
Resource model.  Mineral Reserves are reported above a cut-off grade of 0.45 g/t Au.  

5. Tonnes and grade are reported as-delivered to the mill, including mining dilution and losses.  Dilution and loss are 
accounted for in the block model at the selective mining unit (SMU) size of 6 m E x 12 m N x 3.33 m RL.   

6. All tonnage, grade and contained metal content estimates have been rounded; rounding may result in apparent 
summation differences between tonnes, grade, and contained metal content. 

 

Factors that may affect the estimates include:  changes to the gold price assumptions; 
changes to pit slope and geotechnical assumptions; unforeseen dilution; changes to 
hydrogeological and pit dewatering assumptions; stockpiling assumptions as to the 
amount and grade of stockpile material required to maintain operations during the wet 
season; assumptions used when evaluating the potential economics of Phases 3 
and 4 of each of the pits; changes to inputs to capital and operating cost estimates; 
changes to modifying factor assumptions, including environmental, permitting and 
social licence to operate. 

1.14 Mining Methods 

The mining operations use conventional open pit mining methods and equipment.  
Mining is based on a phased approach with stockpiling to bring high-grade forward and 
provide operational flexibility. 

Ten geotechnical domains have been defined in two oxidation domains (calcrete and 
oxidized; fresh rock), and pit slope angles vary by geotechnical domain.  Inter-berm 
angles range from 30–60º.  Beginning at the 1465 RL, 15 m wide geotechnical berms

Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 1-15 

 

 

are included in the design on 60 m intervals.  These criteria were the basis for the OSA 
applied in the optimization analysis. 

Groundwater is actively extracted ahead of mining from a single dewatering borehole 
situated between the Otjikoto and Wolfshag pits.  Excess water that accumulates in 
the pit due to groundwater seepage and rainwater accumulation is collected in sumps 
located in low spots in each pit and pumped to the return water dam. 

A phased development strategy was applied in the LOM to smooth the mine 
production schedule by deferring waste stripping, and to bring high-grade material 
forward.  Tabulations were developed for each of the phases based on the Mineral 
Reserve gold cut-off grade of 0.45 g/t.  The mineralization was then subdivided based 
on the stockpiling strategy of delaying the processing of most of the low-grade material 
until the end of the mine life.  Development is based on the Otjikoto and Wolfshag 
deposits each being mined in four phases for a total of eight phases.  Phase 1 has 
already been completed for both deposits.  Wolfshag Phase 4 represents the final 
expansion to the ultimate pit.  The current LOM plan assumes processing of 
approximately 5.5 Mt from the Mineral Resource low-grade stockpile when higher-
grade feed is not available.  Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not 
have demonstrated economic viability.  The stockpile has an average grade of 
0.43 g/t Au, which is similar to the break-even processing cut-off grade, so processing 
of this stockpile will be determined when processing capacity is available.   

Where possible, ramps were located in the east wall of both pits to mitigate potential 
geotechnical hazards associated with planar and wedge-forming structures present in 
footwall structures along the west wall.  A nominal ramp and road width of 27 m, 
including drainage and safety berms, was used for dual lane truck operation.  Ramp 
widths were reduced to 20 m in the lower levels of the phase designs to allow for 
single lane haulage on the final benches.  Ramp grades were designed to a maximum 
of 10%.  Temporary ramps will be used, as needed, for initial access to stages.   

Ore is hauled by truck from the pit to a stockpile, the ROM pad or direct-tipped into the 
crusher.  The highest-grade material is direct-tipped or placed on the ROM pad 
depending on the plant feed requirements.  Production drilling and blasting is done on 
10 m benches with patterns and powder factors varying by material type and 
geological conditions.   

Mining operations are scheduled for 365 days per year with a 15% decrease in the 
production rate during the rainy season, December through March.  Vertical advance 
is limited to two operating benches per pit phase.  This will involve the movement of an 
average of 38.5 Mt/a of material to sustain processing of 3.5 Mt/a.  Mine and mill 
production are scheduled for eight years with the mining rate dropping the last two 
years with material from the low-grade stockpiles supplementing the process feed.

Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report

Haul truck numbers will increase from the current 23 to 26 as the haul distances 
increase due to the deepening of the pits and distances from the pits to the WRSF.  
Two Caterpillar 6018 shovels are generally operating on 10 m benches to remove 
waste.  Ore is selectively mined with Liebherr 984 excavators using three flitches of 
3.33 m each.  These excavators are also used to mine difficult areas.  The two R9250 
excavators alternate between ore and waste, as needed.  Caterpillar 992 and 990 
wheel loaders offer flexibility and are used to supplement the mine production and for 
stockpile reclaim. 

1.15 Recovery Methods 

The metallurgical testwork results and information in the 2012 feasibility study provided 
the data to finalize the process design criteria and the Otjikoto mill flowsheet.  The 
process recovery uses conventional designs and equipment.   

The original design of the Otjikoto mill was based on a gravity/whole ore leach flow 
sheet with a nominal treatment rate of 2.5 Mt/a and a plant availability of 94%.  A 25% 
design factor was included for sizing the primary crusher, conveyors, ball mill, 
thickeners, cyanide destruction circuit, reagent systems and mainstream pumps which 
would facilitate a future expansion.  A pebble crusher was installed in the SAG mill 
circuit and two leach tanks were added to the leach circuit in the second half of 2015 to 
expand the mill capacity from 2.5 to 3.1 Mt/a.  

Gold is recovered by gravity concentration/intensive leaching and by a cyanide 
leach/CIP process for treatment of gravity tailings.  The Otjikoto mill design is robust 
and able to process the three major ore types (XR1 – oxide, XR2 – pyrite-dominant, 
XR3 – pyrrhotite-dominant) and now Wolfshag over the range of ore grades mined, 
and with variable materials handling and metallurgical characteristics.  

The process flow sheet consists of the following:  crushing; grinding; gravity 
concentration and intensive cyanidation; cyanide leaching of gravity tailings; carbon-in-
pulp (CIP); cyanide destruction; tailings disposal; acid wash and elution; electrowinning 
and gold room; carbon regeneration; reagents make-up and distribution; air services 
and plant water service. 

The mill fresh water consumption was 1 Mm3/a at the mill design throughput of 
2.5 Mt/a.  Fresh water consumption is now permitted for 2 Mm3/a with the expanded 
mill throughput.  Fresh water is supplied from wells for both potable and process 
needs.  Average overall plant power consumption during steady state mill operation is 
approximately 25–26 kWh/t of ore processed.  Electrical power is generated on site 
using heavy fuel oil generators, and by a new solar power plant that was 
commissioned in 2018.  Reagents are conventional for gold operations, and reagent 
consumptions for Wolfshag ore are similar to Otjikoto ore.

1.16 Project Infrastructure 

Surface infrastructure to support operations is in place, and includes:  two open pits; 
processing facilities (grinding and leaching facilities, along with management and 
engineering offices, change house, workshop, warehouse, and assay laboratory 
facilities); mine facilities (management and engineering offices, change house, EMV 
and light vehicle workshops, wash bay, warehouse, explosives magazine, crusher, 
mine access gate house, return water pump house); administration buildings (facilities 
for overall site management, safety inductions, and general and administrative 
functions); accommodation camp; WRSFs; TSF; water management facilities 
(stormwater and water storage dams, diversions, culverts); landfill facility; power 
generation facility; and fuel storage facilities (heavy fuel oil (HFO) and diesel). 

The TSF was constructed using upstream construction techniques, based on a design 
by Epoch Resources Pty Ltd (Epoch).  A penstock system was constructed in the 
centre of the paddock to direct return water to the return water pond as quickly as 
possible.  The return water dam was constructed within the larger storm water dam, 
which was designed with a runoff system to contain a 50-year storm event.  The TSF 
was designed to contain 36 Mt at a deposition rate of 3.0 Mt/a.  Review of the as-built 
and operating parameters of the TSF by Epoch has increased the ultimate capacity to 
50 Mt at a deposition rate of 3.5 Mt/a, pending continued annual site visits and 
analysis. The TSF and ponds are fully lined with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) 
liner.  Monitoring wells and liner under drains are installed and regularly sampled. 

Hydraulic designs and water management plans focus on isolating the storm water 
from the process water and minimizing water use.  Storm water and any other non-
contact water that flows outside of the disturbed areas is diverted around the facilities 
with a system of storm water ponds, diversion, and culverts.  This system directs the 
flow to the existing channels and culverts associated with the B1 highway.  All water 
falling directly on the industrial areas (contacted water) or otherwise contacted (fissure 
water from the mine pit, return and storm water from the tailings facility) is stored and 
used in the mining and processing facilities. 

The power plant was constructed with 24 MW of installed generating capacity, and a 
7 MW solar plant was commissioned in 2018.   

1.17 Environmental, Permitting and Social Considerations 

An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), complete with an Environmental 
Management Plan (EMP) and Mine Closure Framework (MCF), was originally 
completed for the Otjikoto Gold Mine in June 2012 (2012 EIA).  The 2012 EIA updated 
an earlier impact assessment (completed in September 2011) to include design criteria 
for the mine, milling circuit, tailings management design and infrastructure.  



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 1-18 

 

 

The 2012 EIA included extensive public consultation and was approved (received 
Environmental Clearance Certificate (2012 ECC)) by the Ministry of Environment and 
Tourism (MET), Department of Environmental Affairs in August 2012.  The 2012 ECC 
was incorporated into the Mining Lease Amplification Application approved by the 
Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) in December 2012. 

A second EIA was completed in 2013 (2013 EIA) for the inclusion of the on-site heavy 
fuel oil (HFO) power plant and landfill facility to cater for non-hazardous waste disposal 
(SLR 2013).  The Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) for the 2013 ESIA was 
issued by MET in October 2013 (2013 ECC). 

An EIA Scoping Report (including an assessment of impacts) was completed in 2014 
that included the Wolfshag pit, ancillary infrastructure and an expanded plant capacity 
(2014 EIA Scoping Report).  The EMP was updated to reflect updates to the Project 
and subsequent environmental mitigation and management measures.  A 
corresponding ECC was issued by the MET in January 2015 (this 2015 ECC 
superseded previous ECCs).  ECCs are valid for a three-year period and so the 2015 
ECC was subsequently renewed in 2018 (ECC granted in August 2018).  The EMP is 
currently being updated (2018 EMP) for submittal and approval by the MET.  This 
2018 EMP will reflect the current status (i.e., include changes to the Project and 
updates to its environmental mitigation and management measures) of the Project and 
will be submitted to the MET upon completion. 

1.17.1 Environmental Considerations 

The various EIA, EIA Scoping Reports or other key environmental assessments have 
been supported by and/or incorporate the following: 

 Numerous baseline studies, including: 

 Air quality; 
 Visual landscape; 
 Groundwater and surface water; 
 Biodiversity; 
 Noise; 
 Archaeology/cultural heritage; 

 The process design considerations critical to community health and safety, 
environment, and social issues; 

 The impact of the Project on the environment, proposes monitoring programs for 
all phases of project development; 

 Mitigation strategies to reduce potential project impacts on the receiving 
environment. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 1-19 

 

 

In addition to these key environmental studies, the Otjikoto Mine employs an 
Environmental Department which is located at the mine site and is responsible for 
compliance monitoring, administering environmental permits, interfacing with 
regulators, and maintaining an environmental management system that is in alignment 
with ISO 14001 requirements. 

The Project's environmental management system consists of an overall Environmental 
Management Plan supported by a number of component management plans and 
supporting procedures.  The EMP and its supporting individual Management Plan's 
(MP) are "living documents" which will continue to be amended periodically throughout 
the life of the Project to reflect changes in procedures, practices, Project phase, etc. 

In managing environmental risk at the Project, many environmental aspects have been 
studied in addition to those outlined above.  There are no environmental 
considerations that are known and not discussed in this Report that could materially 
impact B2Gold's ability to extract the Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves.  

1.17.2 Closure and Reclamation Planning 

As part of granting approval for a project under the Environmental Management Act, 7 
of 2007, (EMA), a draft closure and rehabilitation plan is required.  The Otjikoto project 
was approved with a mine closure framework (MCF) in 2012 to satisfy the requirement 
of the EMA.  A mine closure and rehabilitation plan has been developed in 2018 for the 
Otjikoto project and it is in the process of submission to the MET for approval. 

The B2Gold annually updates the estimate of its environmental reclamation and 
closure liabilities.  The estimated environmental liabilities as of December 31, 2018 are 
approximately US$24.8 million. 

1.17.3 Permitting Considerations 

B2Gold holds all permits required for compliant operations.  Permits are renewed as 
required, if the permits were not granted for the full LOM. 

1.17.4 Social Considerations 

The Otjikoto Mine operations and activities associated with the mine have 
socioeconomic impacts on the surrounding communities.  A Social Investment 
Strategy has been developed with the input from key local, regional and national 
stakeholders to enhance the positive impacts and minimize negative impacts of the 
mine.  A Social Investment Board has been created composed of a majority of external 
stakeholders, which oversees the development and implementation of annual social 
investment plans and budgets.  Social investment focuses on four key areas: 
livelihood, education, conservation and health. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 1-20 

 

 

The Otjikoto Mine regularly engages stakeholders (e.g., surrounding communities, 
neighboring landowners/farmers, regulatory authorities) to provide them with 
information regarding the environmental and social performance of the mine, and to 
address any issues that are raised.  A Community Grievance Mechanism is in place to 
address any complaints from external stakeholders. B2Gold investigates all grievances 
and provides a formal response to the complainant. In general, relations with external 
stakeholders are good and stakeholder grievances have been limited. 

1.18 Markets and Contracts 

1.18.1 Markets 

Otjikoto is an operating mine producing a readily-saleable commodity in the form of 
doré.  Doré produced by B2Gold typically contains approximately 92% Au and 3% Ag.  
The doré is exported to the Rand Refinery in South Africa.   

1.18.2 Commodity Prices and Contracts 

Commodity prices used in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates are set by 
B2Gold corporately.  The current gold price provided for Mineral Reserve estimation is 
$1,250/oz, and $1,400/oz for Mineral Resource estimation. 

Major contracts include fuel supply, blasting explosives and accessories, and grade 
control drilling.  Contracts are negotiated and renewed as needed.  Contract terms are 
typical of similar contracts in Namibia. 

The QP has reviewed commodity pricing assumptions, marketing assumptions and the 
current major contract areas, and considers the information acceptable for use in 
estimating Mineral Reserves and in economic analysis. 

1.19 Capital Cost Estimates 

As the Otjikoto is a steady state operation capital costs are largely comprised of mobile 
equipment costs (replace and rebuild).  An allowance for miscellaneous tools and 
equipment, small projects, and other minor capital costs has been included for mining, 
processing, and site general.  All capital costs are assumed to be sustaining capital, as 
the current life of mine plan assumes no expansions to processing or mining capacity. 

The capital cost estimate for the LOMP is included as Table 1-4. 

1.20 Operating Cost Estimates 

Operating costs are based on recent actual costs, projected through the current 
Mineral Reserve based life of mine plan and supported by recent actual costs including 
2018 labour rates and fuel prices.  The operating cost estimate for the LOMP is 
included as Table 1-5.

1.21 Economic Analysis 

B2Gold is using the provision for producing issuers, whereby producing issuers may 
exclude the information required under Item 22 for technical reports on properties 
currently in production and where no material production expansion is planned.   

Mineral Reserve declaration is supported by a positive cash flow.  

1.22 Interpretation and Conclusions 

Under the assumptions presented in this Report, the Project has a positive cash flow, 
and Mineral Reserve estimates can be supported. 

1.23 Recommendations 

The work programs recommended focus on evaluation of the potential for underground 
operations, and on mine design improvements (phase 1) and additional drilling around 
a possible future underground mining (phase 2) that is contingent completion of, and 
positive results from, the first phase of work. 

The first phase of work consists of drilling and mine improvement studies, and is 
budgeted at about $2.6 million.  The second phase, if undertaken, is estimated at 
about $4–$6 million.

 Northing:  7788742; 
 Elevation: 1506; 

 Wolfshag: 

 Easting:  720955; 
 Northing:  7789658; 
 Elevation: 1502. 

4.2 Property and Title in Namibia 

Information in this subsection is summarized from the Ministry of Mines and Energy 
(2018), Namibia Chamber of Mines (2018), and KPMG (2014). 

4.2.1 Mineral Title 

All mining-related activities in Namibia are regulated by the Minerals (Prospecting and 
Mining) Act of 1992.  The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) is the agency 
responsible for preparing policy, strategies and legislative framework, implementing 
government policies, and granting and monitoring of mineral titles. 

Three main types of title can be granted to mining and exploration companies: 

 Reconnaissance Licence (RL):  Designed for regional, mainly remotely sensing 
exploration, a reconnaissance licence is valid for six months on a non-renewable 
basis; 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 4-2 

 

 

 Exclusive Prospecting Licences (EPL):  This three-year licence allows systematic 
prospecting in areas of up to 1,000 km.  It gives exclusive exploration rights to the 
land and may be extended twice for two-year periods if demonstrable progress is 
shown.  Renewals beyond seven years require special approval from the Minister.  
It is possible that two or more EPLs can be granted for more than one mineral in 
the same area.  A geological evaluation and work plan are pre-requisites prior to 
issuing of the EPL; 

 Mining Licences (ML):  This gives the holder the exclusive mining right in the 
licence area for a maximum period of up to 25 years.  Renewals can be granted for 
additional 15-year periods.  The holder is required to demonstrate the financial and 
technical ability to develop and operate a mine. 

In 2011, the Namibian Government declared gold, copper, rare earth metals, 
diamonds, uranium and coal to be "strategic metals".  Licences can only be issued for 
these materials to State-owned companies (e.g. the Epangelo Mining Company (Pty) 
Ltd (Epangelo)); however, the State-owned companies can enter into joint ventures 
(JVs) for exploration and development.  The decision was not retroactive, and existing 
licences were not affected.  However, if a company applied for a new prospecting or 
mining licence covering a strategic mineral, the licence could be granted on condition 
that the licence holders gave first right of refusal to the Namibian Government before 
approaching any other party.  

4.2.2 Surface Rights 

Surface rights are separate rights to mineral rights. 

4.2.3 Royalties 

Royalties levied on mining companies, as per the 1981 Minerals (Prospecting and 
Mining) Act, range from 2–10% of the market value of the commodity extracted.  
Currently, the royalty for gold, copper, zinc and other base metals is 3%. 

The 1981 Minerals Act includes provision for a penalty royalty (failure to beneficiate 
minerals in Namibia, if such beneficiation is possible; transfer pricing arrangements; 
and excessive brokerage fees) as well as for a windfall royalty. 

There is also a levy imposed as part of the 2016 Export Levy Act on the export of gold, 
which is currently set at 1% of gross gold revenue.  

4.2.4 Environmental 

The Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) is the agency with responsibility for 
environmental governance.  The Department of Environmental Affairs includes an 
environmental impact assessment (EIA) unit that assesses EIA reports and provides 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 4-3 

 

 

clearance to mining and non-mining projects.  It also is tasked with environmental 
compliance oversight. 

The Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act 33 of 1992 as amended, under section 128 
states that the Minister can direct the person who was the holder of a non-exclusive 
prospecting licence or mineral licence 'to take all such steps as may be necessary to 
remedy to the satisfaction of the Minister any damage caused by any prospecting 
operations and mining operations carried on by such holder to the surface of, and the 
environment in, such area'.  

Section 130 'Liability of holders of licences or mining claims for pollution of 
environment or other damages or losses caused' requires the holder of the licence or 
mining claim to report any spillage of minerals to the Minister and are held liable to 
remedy the damage done to the area. 

The Environmental Management Act 7 of 2007 requires the issuance of environmental 
permits and licenses for a range of activities which would have an impact on the 
environment.  This includes mining operations. 

Prior to mining licenses being issued, all applicants are required to complete an 
environmental contract with the MET.  Environmental impact assessments must 
include considerations such as air pollution, dust generation, water supply, 
drainage/waste water disposal, land disturbance and protection of flora and fauna. 

4.2.5 Water 

For protection of water resources, the government of Namibia has formulated the 
Water Resource Management Act, 2013, which stipulates that a person shall require a 
licence to extract and use water for commercial use, which can also be combined with 
a licence to discharge effluents. Under Section 61 of the Act, a borehole licence is 
issued for the purpose of exploring or extracting minerals which require deepening or 
enlarging of an existing borehole that may be below the water table. Such a licence 
can only be issued with a condition that the licence holder has to ensure conservation 
and protection of water resource. Further, wastage of groundwater in boreholes, wells, 
shafts, mines or other excavations is prohibited under Section 63 of the Act. A 
requirement of a licence is prerequisite to dispose of groundwater extracted from a 
mine or any underground work which has also been mandated under Section 
109(1)(d) of the Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act. 

4.2.6 Fraser Institute Survey 

B2Gold has used the Investment Attractiveness Index from the 2017 Fraser Institute 
Annual Survey of Mining Companies report (the Fraser Institute survey) as a credible 
source for the assessment of the overall political risk facing an exploration or mining 
project in Namibia. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 4-4 

 

 

B2Gold has relied on the Fraser Institute survey because it is globally regarded as an 
independent report-card style assessment to governments on how attractive their 
policies are from the point of view of an exploration manager or mining company, and 
forms a proxy for the assessment by industry of political risk in Namibia from the 
mining perspective. 

The Fraser Institute annual survey is an attempt to assess how mineral endowments 
and public policy factors such as taxation and regulatory uncertainty affect exploration 
investment. 

Overall, Namibia ranked 54 out of 91 jurisdictions in the attractiveness index survey in 
2017; 39 out of 91 in the policy perception index; and 60 out of 91 in the best practices 
mineral potential index.  

4.3 Project Ownership 

Mineral tenure is held in the name of B2Gold Namibia Pty Ltd. (B2Gold Namibia).  
B2Gold Namibia is indirectly owned by B2Gold (90%), and EVI Mining (Proprietary) 
Ltd., (EVI), a Namibian empowerment company (10%). 

4.4 Mineral Tenure 

The four EPL licences and one mining licence that make collectively form the Otjikoto 
Mine cover an area of approximately 254,442 ha.   

Table 4-1 summarizes the current tenure holdings within the defined Project area, and 
Table 4-2 outlines the reporting and other obligations that must be met to retain the 
mineral title in good standing.  The tenure locations are shown in Figure 4-1.   

Maintaining ML169 requires annual fee payments and filing of bi-annual environmental 
reports with the MET, development of a work program, environmental compliance, 
commitment to seek local suppliers for fuel and lubricants, approval of the product 
take-off agreement, and payment of taxes by permanent employees in Namibia.   

Applications for renewal for EPLs 4309 and 2410 have been lodged.  Maintaining the 
EPLs requires annual fee payments, submission of quarterly exploration activity 
reports to the MME, and submission of bi-annual environmental reports with the MET.   

Exploration on EPL4309 is conducted under the terms of an Environmental Clearance 
Certificate (ECC) issued by the MET on August 4, 2016; this ECC remains in good 
standing for a period of three years.  The ECCs for EPLs 6219 and 6228 have yet to 
be issued by the MET.

4.5 Surface Rights 

B2Gold's surface rights holdings consist of five farms: 

 Felsenquelle; 

 Gerhardshausen; 

 Otjikoto; 

 Wolfshag; 

 Erhardshof. 

Land taxes are due on the farms.  The 1995 Agricultural and Commercial Land Reform 
Act levies a land tax; the rates of such land taxes are determinable on nationality, size 
of the farm, activities and number of farms held by a particular owner as determined by 
the Ministry of Land Reform. 

Where exploration activities are conducted on ground where the surface rights are 
held by third parties, B2Gold typically enters into compensation agreements for any 
land disturbance with the surface rights owner.   

4.6 Water Rights 

A water permit, (#10971) which allowed a maximum abstraction of 1.4 Mm3 per annum 
from selected groundwater wells, was granted in 2013 for clearing and construction 
purposes.  In May, 2018, a revised #10971 permit was granted, allowing for 4.4 Mm3 
per annum water extraction from selected groundwater wells subject to certain 
monitoring and reporting conditions.  This permit is current for two years, expiring in 
2020, and providing all conditions are met, can be renewed. 

4.7 Royalties and Encumbrances 

The Namibian Minerals Act levies a royalty of 3% on the net sales of gold and silver.  
There is also a 1% export levy on gross gold revenue.  

The Otjikoto Project is not subject to any other back-in rights payments, agreements or 
encumbrances.   

4.8 Permitting Considerations 

Permitting considerations for operations are discussed in Section 20.  

4.9 Environmental Considerations 

Environmental considerations for operations are discussed in Section 20.

4.10 Social License Considerations 

Social licence considerations for operations are discussed in Section 20.  

4.11 Comment on Property Description and Location 

To the extent known, there are no other significant factors and risks that may affect 
access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the Project that have not been 
discussed in this Report.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 

The Otjikoto Mine area can be reached from the capital city, Windhoek, some 300 km 
to the south, along the B1 National Road, which is a surfaced road in excellent 
condition.  Windhoek is connected by direct commercial air travel from several 
European countries, South Africa and other African countries.  

The large regional town of Tsumeb, a mining centre in its own right, is located some 
110 km north of the Project area, also along the B1 National Road.  A domestic airport 
is located at Tsumeb, currently with both scheduled and charter flights connecting with 
Windhoek.  

The smaller town of Otavi lies some 50 km north from the Otjikoto Mine area near the 
cross roads of the main north–south B1 National Road, the road to Grootfontein and 
the road to Outjo.  Otjiwarongo is the nearest town to the site and is approximately 
70 km away.  

Mine-related traffic travels from both the Otavi and Otjiwarongo directions on a daily 
basis with all traffic using the B1 National Road to access the property.   

Internal access to the mine area is via a well-maintained network of secondary roads 
and farm tracks.  Given the generally arid climate of the area, these roads are typically 
trafficable year-round.  

5.2 Climate 

The area is characterized by low rainfall with extreme temperature ranges typical of an 
arid environment.   

Annual rainfall trends from the onsite weather station (SLR, 2018) indicate summer 
rainfall (December to March) and dry winter months (June to August).  The highest 
annual rainfall recorded was 789.2 mm in the 2013–2014 hydrological year (starting on 
October 1); the lowest was 318.2 mm in 2009. 

Temperatures recorded from the on-site weather station varied from -5ºC (in winter) to 
37.9ºC (in summer).  The coldest months are June, July and August; the warmest 
months are October, November and December. 

The prevailing wind field is from the east and east–southeast and stronger winds are 
experienced during August, September and October.   

The annual evaporation rate is in excess of 2,500 mm. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 5-2 

 

 

Mining and exploration activities are typically conducted on a year-round basis.  
Isolated heavy rainfall events may cause temporary halts in activity. 

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Permanent employees live either in Otavi or Otjiwarongo.   

Namibia has established mining and construction industries; however, training 
programs are in place to ensure sufficient trained personnel for mine operations. 

A discussion on the infrastructure for the mining operation is included in Section 18.  

5.4 Physiography 

The mine site is located at an elevation of 1,500–1,510 masl.  

The greater part of the Project area falls within the tree and shrub savannah zone, 
which is listed as the dominant vegetation type in central Namibia.   

The mine site is situated just north of a local surface water divide.  However, there are 
no well-defined surface water drainage features on the site and no major surface water 
flows or defined channel flows have occurred, or are expected other than local events 
after heavy rainfall.   

5.5 Seismicity 

The seismicity of Namibia is considered moderate with earthquakes concentrated 
along the coastal escarpment and topographically high zones of the Namaqua and 
Damara Orogenic belts.  Other earthquakes are mainly associated with major fault 
systems in the country (Mine Technics, 2018).   

During an assessment of the seismic risk to mining operations conducted in 2018, 
Mine Technics (2018) noted that:   

"Most of Namibia, including the central-north and north-eastern regions, fall in a 
seismic hazard rating where the probability is only 10% that peak ground acceleration 
g (gravity acceleration, m/s2) will exceed 0.2 m/s2 in 50 years.  This probability number 
varies with time; i.e. it is lower for shorter periods and higher for longer periods.  The 
probability that ground acceleration will exceed 0.2 m/s2 in a mine or open pit 
operating life of 10 to 15 years will be substantially lower than 10%".  

Low-level earthquake activity has been recorded regionally.  The highest intensity 
event recorded in the Project vicinity is a magnitude 4.8 event in 1980, centred about 
25–30 km to the north of the mining operation.

5.6 Sufficiency of Surface Rights 

There is sufficient surface area for the open pits, waste rock storage facilities, plant, 
tailings storage facilities, associated infrastructure and other operational requirements 
for the planned life-of-mine and mine plan discussed in this Report.

6.0 HISTORY 

6.1 Exploration History 

A summary of the exploration history is provided in Table 6-1.  Early exploration efforts 
reported in previous technical reports focused on base metals and those areas are 
outside the current Project holdings.  The first regional gold-focused exploration 
activity commenced in 1995.   

Avdale Namibia (Pty) Ltd. (Avdale), a subsidiary of Anglovaal Mining Ltd (Anglovaal), 
identified 12 "high-priority" gold target areas in 1998.  The Otjikoto deposit was "Area 
9".   

Several small-scale amethyst quarries are present on the Project, but are not in the 
immediate deposit areas. 

6.2 Production 

There is no known commercial production from the Otjikoto area prior to B2Gold.   

B2Gold declared commercial production from the Otjikoto open pit on 15 February, 
2015.  Production to 31 December, 2018 is summarized in Table 6-2.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The major regional structure is the Damara Mobile Belt, part of a network of orogenic 
Neoproterozoic (1,000–542 Ma) mobile belts in Africa that represent suture zones 
between continental fragments.  The Damara Orogeny (~850–460 Ma) developed as a 
result of successive phases of spreading, rifting, subduction and continental collision 
between the Kalahari, Congo and Río de la Plata Cratons. 

The Damara Mobile Belt can be divided into a number of sub-parallel 
tectonostratigraphic zones, separated by regional lineaments.  The Otjikoto Mine area 
is primarily within the tectonostratigraphic zone referred to as the Northern Zone 
(Figure 7-1).  Figure 7-2 is a stratigraphic summary of the key units within the 
Damaran stratigraphy of the Northern Zone. 

The basal unit is the Palaeoproterozoic Huab Metamorphic Complex, which consists of 
a lower metasedimentary sequence and an upper metavolcaniclastic sequence.  
These sequences were intruded by mafic sills and dykes and granitic material, forming 
mega-sills and plutons, which were transformed by later metamorphism into 
amphibolite (mafic rocks) and quartz–feldspar–biotite gneiss and felsic orthogneiss 
(felsic rocks), respectively (Jelsma et al., 2018). 

This basement is unconformably overlain by rocks of the Nosib Group.  The Nosib 
Group consists of arkosic quartzite west and north of Otjiwarongo, possibly the 
volcanic rocks of the Naauwpoort Formation, and gneissic arkosic quartzite and 
amphibolite containing garnet and cordierite of the Tsaun Formations. 

Overlying the Nosib Group with an angular unconformity are rocks of the 
Neoproterozoic Swakop Group, further subdivided from lowermost to uppermost as 
follows: 

 Ugab Subgroup:  Askevold, Okotjize, and Orosewa Formations.  Consists of a 
marine, shallow-water, mixed carbonate-clastic sequence, which grades from on-
shore facies in the north to off-shore facies in the south: 

 Askevold Formation:  agglomerate with lesser amounts of schistose lithologies, 
basic lava and chloritised schist; 

 Okotjize Formation:  iron formation intercalated with dolostone and ferruginous 
quartzite; 

 Orosewa Formation (uppermost unit):  schists overlain by quartzites; 
conformably overlies Okotjize Formation;

 Usakos Subgroup:  Chuos, Rasthof, and Okonguarri Formations: 

 Chuos Formation:  forms a sharp erosional contact with the underlying 
lithologies.  Consists of a matrix-supported glacial diamictite containing clasts 
of amphibolite, Naauwpoort Formation ignimbrite, gneiss, granite, schist and 
carbonate and iron formations.  Much of the Chuos Formation is highly 
ferruginous; 

 Rasthof Formation:  carbonate cap sequence;   
 Okonguarri Formation (uppermost unit):  interbedded succession of siliciclastic 

and mixed siliciclastic, calcareous and dolomitic turbidites, quartz–biotite schist, 
and pelite.  Typically wedged between Chuos and Ghaub Formation 
diamictites; 

 Navachab Subgroup: Ghaub, Karibib, and Kuiseb Formations: 

 Ghaub Formation:  carbonate-clast diamictite, overlain by dropstone-bearing, 
bedded shale and siltstone; 

 Karibib Formation:  thick sequence of dolomitic limestone with subordinate 
marble, dolostone and metapelite; 

 Kuiseb Formation (uppermost unit):  metagreywacke, marly metapelite and 
quartzite. 

Unconformably overlying the Damara sequence are basin-fill lithologies of the late 
Carboniferous to middle Jurassic Karoo Supergroup.  In Namibia, these units are 
preserved, from south to north, in the Karaburg, Aranos, Waterberg, Huab and 
Owambo subsidiary basins (Figure 7-3).  Four of the five main stratigraphic groups 
which comprise the Karoo of South Africa are typically recognised in Namibia: the 
Dwyka, Ecca, "Stormberg" and Drakensberg Groups (Pickford, 1995).  The Waterberg 
sub-basin may contain correlatives of the Beaufort Group (Catuneanu et al., 2005).   

The major units within the Karoo basins, summarized from Catuneanu et al., (2005), 
include: 

 Dwyka Group and equivalents:  silt-dominated marine diamictites with dropstones, 
turbidite and debris flows, tillites, sandstone and conglomerate, glacial or 
periglacial lacustrine sediments; 

 Ecca Group and equivalents:  mixed clastic sediments (sandstones, siltstones, 
mudstones, carbonaceous mudstones) with rare minor carbonates; 

 Beaufort Group equivalents:  argillaceous sediments, sandstones, playa lake 
sediments;

Note:  Figure from Catuneanu et al., 2005.  Map north is to top of figure. 

 

 Stormberg Series (Molteno, Elliot and Clarens Formation equivalents):  fluvial 
conglomerates and sandstones, overlain by aeolian sediments and red-beds; 

 Drakensberg Group equivalents:  flood basalts. 

The Karoo Group rocks are in turn unconformably overlain by Cenozoic Kalahari 
sands, and isolated undifferentiated recent sediments (sand, calcrete, gravel and 
alluvial deposits; Schreiber, 2012).

7.2 Project Geology 

7.2.1 Lithologies 

Overview 

The Otjikoto area is predominantly underlain by lithologies belonging to the Swakop 
Group.  The Okonguarri Formation hosts the gold mineralization and is overlain and 
underlain by the distinctive glacial diamictite horizons of the Ghaub and Chuos 
Formations, respectively.   

Outcrop in the Project area is limited to Karibib Formation marbles, with most of the 
region covered by a thick layer of calcrete, transported Kalahari Group sands, and soil. 

The geological knowledge of the area has been principally interpreted from a 
combination of geophysical work and drilling.  Review of the airborne electromagnetic 
SPECTREM geophysical survey, in particular, mapped out the non-conductive marble 
of the Karibib Formation and the marble units hosted within the Okonguarri Formation.  
High resolution airborne magnetics and ground surveys have provided additional 
details on distribution of the main stratigraphic units.  

Project Geology 

Table 7-1 summarizes the geology of the general Project area.  A stratigraphic column 
is included as Figure 7-4 and a geology plan as Figure 7-5.   

B2Gold geological staff have identified a number of intrusions from geophysical data 
as shown in Figure 7-5; these are in addition to intrusions mapped by the Geological 
Survey of Namibia, or recognised by AVMIN and Anglo Vaal staff as documented in 
Sanz (2005).  These intrusions are tentatively ascribed to the Otjiwarongo Batholith, a 
poorly-documented assemblage of granites (quartz monzonite, biotite granite), alkali 
granite, pegmatite, quartz syenite and minor granodiorite (Sanz, 2005).  A pegmatite 
sample assumed to be part of this suite in the Otjikoto region returned an age date of 
~550 Ma.  There is also a possibility that some of the intrusive bodies may be part of 
the Mesozoic Damaraland Intrusive Suite, which forms a broad swath of anorogenic 
ring complexes, stocks, plugs and diatremes in northern Namibia. 

Figure 7-5 also includes an informal unit that is locally termed the Tirol marble.  This 
unit may either underlie the Chuos Formation, or alternatively, overlie it and the 
Rasthof Formation and form the base of the Okonguarri Formation in the Otjikoto mine 
area.

Table 7-1: Project Geology 

Unit Description 

Soil  Present as a relatively thin 10 to 20 cm veneer over the deposit, but commonly ranges to 
a maximum depth of 2 m.  The soil horizon is poorly developed and commonly organic 
rich and/or mixed with the transported sediments 

Kalahari Group aeolian 
soils and sands 

Aeolian soils and sands have been transported into the area and generally fill local 
depressions. 

Calcium carbonate and 
calcrete 

Surficial deposits of leached accumulations of calcium carbonate and calcrete occur over 
all of the deposit area and range in depth from 2–15 m with thicker development in local 
topographic depressions and fault zones.   

Calcrete varies from hardpan to powdered calcrete.  Hardpan calcrete is hard and 
commonly has a conglomeratic appearance with rounded to angular fragments of 
partially to completely calcretized bedrock fragments within a calcrete matrix.  Powdery 
calcrete consists of zones of powdery calcite/clay and is normally found in discontinuous 
lenses and/or as lining in dissolution cavities within the hardpan calcrete. 

Karibib Formation Marbles occur as ridge-forming areas of outcrop in the eastern and northern portion of 
the property.  The marbles commonly are white to light grey, medium to coarse grained, 
massive to banded and predominantly composed of calcite. Locally they are intercalated 
with biotite schist bands towards the base of the Karibib Formation.  The Karibib marbles 
in the region have thicknesses of 50 to >100 m.  

Karibib schist units of variable thickness have been intersected below the marble, 
principally to the west and south of the main deposit. The schist is commonly dark grey, 
fine grained, massive to weakly foliated metagreywacke biotite schist 

Ghaub Formation  The Cap dolomite is intersected above the Ghaub diamictite and is a thin (10 cm to 1 m), 
commonly cream colored and well laminated unit. 

The Ghaub diamictite is intersected to west the west, east and south of the main deposit 
and ranges in thickness from 10–25 m.  The unit is light grey colored and readily 
identifiable by the presence of elongated clasts of variable composition ranging in size 
from <1–+5 cm.  The clasts represent glacial derived drop stones and thus the unit is a 
diamictite.  The Ghaub Formation is strongly sheared to the west of the Otjikoto deposit.   

A dark grey to black, sometimes graphitic, shale/schist unit underlies the Ghaub 
Formation.  West of the Otjikoto deposit this unit contains disseminations and lenses of 
vuggy fine-grained pyrite. 

Okonguarri Formation Schist units that are variably composed of a mix of biotite and feldspar (plagioclase 
dominant) with lesser quartz, dolomite, calcite and garnet. They have poor to well-
developed schistosity with foliation commonly parallel or sub-parallel to primary bedding 
or metamorphic banding.  Graded bedding is preserved in some of the schist. The schist 
units are derived from semi-pelitic, pelitic, marl and psammitic units in a turbiditic 
sedimentary package. The schist tends to be quite competent but of variable hardness, 
usually directly related to the biotite content and/or degree of schistosity. Three main 
marble bands (hanging wall, OTB and footwall) occur in the Okonguarri Formation. The 
hanging wall marble is a discontinuous coarse-grained marble horizon(s) which is 
believed to have been boudinaged during folding or thrusting. The OTB marble forms the 
structural footwall of the main mineralized zone and represents the most important, and 
distinctive, marker horizon in the deposit area.  Most drill holes within the Otjikoto deposit 
bottomed in the OTB marble. The OTB consists of weakly banded, white to light grey, 
medium to coarse grained calcite crystals.  The thickness of the OTB is relatively uniform

(averaging 10 m) throughout the Otjikoto deposit area. It forms an essentially flat tabular 
unit dipping at approximately 25º to the east–southeast (125° azimuth).  The footwall 
marble is located approximately 20–30 m below the OTB marble in the Otjikoto deposit 
area.  The footwall marble is similar in appearance to the OTB but tends to have more 
biotite crystals present, forming weak banding.  It is commonly 15–20 m thick.  

Middle Okonguarri 
Formation 

Biotite and biotite-garnet schist units occur below the footwall marble.

7.2.2 Weathering 

Surficial deposits of leached accumulations of calcium carbonate and calcrete occur 
over the deposit area and range in depth from 2–15 m with thicker development in 
local topographic depressions and fault zones.  The calcrete varies from hardpan to 
powdered calcrete.  The former is hard, and commonly has a conglomeratic 
appearance with rounded to angular fragments of partially to completely calcretized 
bedrock fragments within a calcrete matrix.  The latter represents zones of powdery 
calcite/clay and is normally found in discontinuous lenses and/or as lining in dissolution 
cavities within the hardpan calcrete.  

The oxidation depth commonly ranges from 20–40 m with an average of about 35 m.  
The transition to fresh rock is typically rapid, within 1–4 m.  There can be instances of 
deeper oxidation in association with fracture and/or fault zones. 

7.2.3 Structure 

Overview 

Three structural regimes are recognized: 

 D1:  recumbent folding 

 D2:  a series of major doubly-plunging anticlines and synclines.  The folds vary in 
closure from open to tight and in attitude from upright to overturned, occasionally 
recumbent.  A fairly abrupt swing in axial trend of D2 folds from northeast–
southwest to more or less east–west has regional significance within the 
Otjiwarongo–Otavi area.  The major D2 folds are internally quite complex 
structures with numerous parasitic folds on the flanks of the major structures 

 D3:  doming event.  Disrupts and refolds D2 fold structures, particularly in the area 
south of Otjikoto.  Several Nosib Group-cored domes or relatively short, northeast-
trending, doubly-plunging anticlinal structures can probably be ascribed to this 
event. However, several domal structures in the Otjikoto area have been 
investigated and found to be related to the intrusion of circular granitic bodies. 

Most of the Damara faults mapped in the Otjiwarongo-Otavi Region appear to be 
related to the D2 deformational event.  A number of closely spaced strike-slip faults 
are interpreted from photo geology and geophysics.  These are probably related to the 
earlier phase of the D2 event.  Late brittle faults, particularly of northwest and east–
west orientation, are interpreted to be late, possibly of Karoo age (Permian to 
Jurassic). Some of these faults remain seismically active.

Project Structure 

Faults 

Thrust faults and related horse duplex complexes are interpreted for Otjikoto and 
Wolfshag zones (Figure 7-6).  An overall cartoon schematic showing the interpreted 
structural setting is included as Figure 7-7.  The complex folding discussed in the next 
sub-section is interpreted to in part reflect drag folding related to the thrusts.   

The Wolfshag zone is interpreted to be the multiple recumbently folded OTA zone 
between the OTB and Footwall marbles. The PT marble is within the OTA. Within the 
deposit area the Okonguarri Formation is divided into the OTC (host to Otjikoto 
mineralization) and the OTD horizons with inferred thrusts separating the horizons, the 
structural top of the OTB marble, and the Middle Okonguarri Formation (refer to  
Figure 7-6). 

The main structural control on the Otjikoto–Wolfshag mineralization is interpreted to be 
parasitic fold hinges between bedding parallel thrusts with the lower-most thrust called 
the Wolfshag Thrust (WT).  The thrusting had left-lateral transpressional movement 
(i.e. southeast over northwest) during the main Damaran regional deformation and 
metamorphic event.  Sodic metasomatism was related to this event and resulted in 
widespread albitization.  The mineralized shoots follow the fold hinges which on 
average plunge 10–15° to the southwest at azimuth 190° to 200°direction, and the dip 
of the mineralized shoots follows the fold hinges.   

Several generations of late brittle faults cross cut the Project area.  The fault locations 
are mostly based on a combination of photo-geological interpretation, topography, drill 
core logging and geophysical interpretation.  Two of the steep east–west-oriented 
haematitic brittle fault gouge zones have been confirmed in the Wolfshag pit.  The 
mineralized zones do not appear to be significantly displaced by these structures.  The 
north–northwest-oriented brittle faults are commonly steeply westerly-dipping and 
show minimal displacement. 

Distinctive chalky-altered albitite, characterized by white, very fine-grained albite, 
calcite and swelling-clay minerals occur within the Wolfshag zone.  Medium- to coarse-
grained euhedral pyrite is a common accessory mineral in these zones, particularly in 
the deeper levels of the Wolfshag zone.  The chalky zones can be as thick as several 
metres width but are most commonly <5 cm wide in core.  These zones are believed to 
be dissolution zones associated with groundwater.

Note:  Figure prepared by B2Gold, 2018. 

 

Tension gash veins occur nearly orthogonal to the main veins (including folded veins) 
and compositional banding is commonly steeply-dipping, and east–west oriented. 

They occur as discrete veins and in association with the brittle and shear veins.  The 
gashes are predominantly filled with pyrite and/or magnetite with low amounts of 
calcite or iron carbonate present and are more abundant in Wolfshag than in Otjikoto. 

Folding 

A broad open synform occurs east of the deposit, defined by the Karibib Formation 
marble cored by Kuiseb Formation schist.  West of the synform the Okonguarri 
Formation is partially sheared and with tight isoclinal, recumbent fold geometries.  A 
recumbent antiform with parasitic folding on the limbs defines the hanging wall (east) 
of the Otjikoto deposit.  Further to the west, the Ghaub and Karibib Formations are 
repeated in a tight, attenuated, recumbent synform (termed locally the "Karibib hook").   

Detailed structural studies of the Otjikoto deposit by Dr. Karl Kasch and John 
Fedorowich, during the exploration phase, and later by David Rhys, support the 
current interpretations. 

Sedimentary Layering 

Primary sedimentary layering is often well preserved, with graded bedding on the 
millimetre- and centimetre-scale.  The stratigraphy is generally the right way up in the 
OTC-hosted Otjikoto deposit.  Multiple grading reversals are evident in the Wolfshag 
zone, indicating complex folding.  



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report

Foliations and Lineations 

The dominant fabric (S1) in the deposit area is parallel to sub-parallel to bedding (S0) 
and strike 035° with dip at 25° to the southeast. A second set of foliations (S3) is rarely 
developed, but where present, is usually in association with folds.  

Rotation of garnets and other local shear fabrics indicate the presence of high strain 
zones within the deposit area.  The orientation of the high strain zones appears to be 
bedding parallel, and believed to be of Damara age.  

Pesce et al. (2010) defined a mineral lineation with average trend of 010° and plunge 
of 11° degrees to the southwest. In some cases, it was observed that the sulphides 
follow the same lineation direction. This lineation is believed to be parallel to the 
plunge of fold hinges and associated high-grade ore shoots  

7.2.4 Metamorphism 

Overview 

The Okonguarri Formation is regionally metamorphosed to greenschist facies, and can 
locally be thermally metamorphosed to mid-amphibolite facies where granitic bodies 
have intruded the unit.  The known granite intrusions are situated south of EPL4309, 
and have not been observed within the Project area.  

Project Metamorphism 

In the Project area, the metamorphic grade is middle amphibolite-facies, associated 
with hydrothermal fluid flow.  The local presence of kyanite and sillimanite suggests 
relatively high pressures and moderate temperatures.  

Negonga (2018) calculated a 534–555°C temperature for the Otjikoto vein formation 
from fluid inclusion measurements. 

7.2.5 Alteration 

Overview 

Albitization of all the lithologies in the Otjikoto area is widespread.  Chlorite, amphibole, 
carbonate and biotite alteration are also common.  Depending on the intensity and 
type of alteration and original host rock composition, the following alteration 
"lithologies" have been systematically logged: albitite, albite–biotite schist, garnet–
albite–biotite schist, amphibole-bearing albitite, garnet–amphibole metasediment and 
banded biotite–amphibole metasediment.  Calcareous biotite schist is also present, 
with much of the carbonate believed to be introduced. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 7-15 

 

 

The albitization throughout the sedimentary sequence indicates widespread sodium 
metasomatism.  The intense albitization of the granofels and schist observed at 
Otjikoto is unusual in the Northern Zone of the Damara Orogen.  The albitization may 
have occurred relatively early in the tectonothermal history and may be unrelated to 
the gold-mineralizing event.  However, albitization probably changed the rheology of 
the host rocks and made them prone to fracturing during deformation.  

Project Alteration 

The amphibole-bearing units have been grouped together at Otjikoto into a HORN unit 
and the albite-altered beds/bands into an ALB unit.  Both the HORN and ALB units are 
more competent and harder than the SCHIST unit.  Where garnets are present, the 
schist lithologies are also abrasive.   

Amphibole-style (HORN) alteration is absent in the Wolfshag zone, and albitization 
tends to be much stronger than at Otjikoto.  There is a late carbonate (calcite + 
dolomite) alteration which overprints the albitization as both a pervasive texture, and 
as "crackle" fracture fill.  The crackle fill is often associated with fine-grained, 
disseminated magnetite and/or pyrite. 

7.3 Deposit Descriptions 

The general geology of the Otjikoto and Wolfshag areas is provided in Figure 7-8. 

7.3.1 Otjikoto 

The deposit has a strike extent of 2.6 km and has been drill tested to 475 m depth 
below surface. 

Most of the gold is hosted by a north–northeast striking sheeted vein system that is 
more than 40 m wide.  Individual veins are thin (<10 cm) and consist of sulphide (+ 
magnetite)–quartz + carbonate veins developed in schist (variably albitised) and 
granofels of the Upper and Middle Okonguarri Formation.  High-grade mineralized 
shoots occur on the short limbs and within the hinges of intrafolial folds between planar 
beds.

The major lithologies are (Figure 7-9; Figure 7-10):  

 OTD biotite schist: hosts minor bedding-parallel veins with irregularly distributed 
gold values; Upper Okonguarri Formation; 

 OTC albitite–hornfels unit:  hosts most of the mineralized vein system; basal unit of 
the Upper Okonguarri Formation; 

 OTB calcitic marble:  unmineralized, 6–10 m thick; Middle Okonguarri Formation; 

 OTA albite biotite schist–albitite: hosts minor bedding-parallel veins with irregularly 
distributed gold values; 20–30 m thick; Middle Okonguarri Formation; 

 Footwall calcitic marble: unmineralised, 15–25 m thick; Middle Okonguarri 
Formation; 

 Footwall biotite schist: unmineralised; Middle Okonguarri Formation. 

The sheeted vein swarm lies at an angle of 20° to 30° to a set of north–northeast-
trending linear structures, and the majority of the veins lie parallel to an S0/S1 
transposition foliation which approximates bedding.  The folded veins and related high-
grade gold mineralization occur in a series of distinct en-echelon zones oriented at 
approximately 010° to 020° north–northeast and plunging at 10–15° (average 12°) to 
the south–southwest.   

Vein concentrations range from one to 30 veins per metre, with a higher vein 
concentration within the Central and West shoots.  Vein contacts are commonly 
irregular.  Brecciation within and adjacent to the veins is common. 

In the shallower and northern portions of the deposit, the veins are pyrite-rich, while in 
the southern and deeper levels of the deposit the veins are pyrrhotite-dominant.  Veins 
proximal to the OTB marble, the bottom or footwall veins tend to be carbonate-rich 
while those in the rest of the deposit contain a mix of quartz–calcite and iron 
carbonate.  Pyrite within the pyrite-dominant veins tends to have a vuggy texture. 

Chalcopyrite is rare, and small (<10 µm) grains of maldonite (Au2Bi) were observed 
during metallurgical testwork on the pyrite-dominant veins.  Marcasite is also present 
in the shallower, pyrite-dominant vein systems.   

Magnetite represents an important constituent of the veins, ranging from trace 
amounts to 100% of individual veins.  Granular to massive magnetite is more common 
than bladed "feathery" magnetite.  The granular magnetite veins are commonly hosted 
by the intensively albitized metasediments.

Within the oxide zone the sulphides commonly weather to hematite and/or limonite. 

Quartz, calcite, dolomite, siderite, biotite and ankerite are the main gangue minerals.  
Other important gangue minerals in the veins include garnet, amphibole and to a 
lesser extent chlorite and muscovite/sericite.   

Silicate + sulphide vein assemblages show very variable proportions of the constituent 
minerals.  Garnets within and on the haloes of veins tend to be larger than the host 
rock garnets.   

Gold occurs within the vein system as coarse native gold with a size variation from 
5 µm to 400 µm, with the median at about 100 µm.  No specific location for gold has 
been noted.  It has been observed adjacent to and within sulphides, along fractures, 
adjacent to and within garnets, within magnetite, on the edges of amphiboles and 
chlorite, and as free gold in quartz and carbonate. 

7.3.2 Wolfshag 

The deposit has a strike extent of 2.1 km and has been drill tested to 700 m depth 
below surface. 

The Wolfshag deposit is hosted within the fold duplicated OTA horizon enveloped 
between the Footwall (west) and OTB (east) marbles, and stratigraphically below the 
Otjikoto OTC zone.  Albitite is the major lithology within the zone (Figure 7-11), with 
minor albite–biotite schist and marble bands in places. 

The deposit consists of a series of fold-duplicated mineralized zones alphabetically 
subdivided from WA to WE into either west–northwest or east–southeast-verging fold 
closure zones (Figure 7-12).  The zones steepen and narrow to the south.  High-grade 
shoots within the mineralised zones are associated with parasitic folds occurring within 
the larger fold structure.  The shoots plunge at 15° to 20° to the south–southwest, sub-
parallel to the Otjikoto deposit shoots.  The dip of the shoots is parallel to the axial 
planes of the folds (5 to 20°) to the east–southeast.

The mineralized shoots include: 

 WA:  West–northwest-verging fold closure.  Ranges in width from 160–215 m and 
can be as much as 40 m thick.  Higher gold grades occur on the upper, downward-
facing limb, nearer to the western fold nose; 

 WB:  East–southeast-verging fold closure connected to WA by a low-grade, 
upward facing inverted limb.  Ranges in width from 75–135 m, and can be as much 
as 30 m thick.  The higher gold grades occur in the lower downward-facing limb; 

 WC:  Inverted limb between WB and WE.  Ranges in width from 95–115 m and 
can be as much as 25 m thick.  Higher gold grades occur near the east-verging 
fold closure adjacent to WE, but are less continuous than those of the WA and WB 
zones; 

 WE:  West–northwest-verging fold closure.  Ranges in width from 65–110 m and 
can be as much as 35 m thick.  Higher gold grades occur on either limb nearer to 
the west-verging fold nose. 

Gold mineralization can be vein-hosted, or represent replacement or disseminated 
styles.   

Vein-hosted mineralization consists of pyrite–calcite + magnetite veins.  These shear 
which tend to be brittle fracture-fill-related, with ragged edges, and most commonly 
parallel to subparallel to the compositional banding.  Locally the veins are folded which 
is related to higher gold grades.  Shear veining usually contains a mix of both 
replacement and vein style mineralization with both brittle (brecciation) and ductile 
deformation textures. 

The replacement style mineralization ranges from moderate, disseminated, to massive 
pyrite and/or magnetite replacement of calcareous bands and/or marbles.  
Replacement mineralization tends to be lower grade and is commonly gradational with 
the shear vein style.   

Disseminated mineralization tends to be lower grade with fine- to medium-grained 
magnetite more dominant than fine-grained pyrite.   

7.4 Prospects/Exploration Targets 

Prospects are discussed in Section 9.  

7.5 Comments on Geological Setting and Mineralization 

The understanding of the Project geology and mineralization is sufficient to support 
Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation and mine planning.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

8.1 Deposit Model 

No definitive deposit model has been accepted for the Otjikoto and Wolfshag deposits, 
and the deposit genesis is still debated.  Models that have been suggested include: 

 Orogenic lode gold deposits:  based on the fact that the systems are open to depth 
and show both lateral and vertical continuity down plunge on shoots, which is 
typical of Archean and Neoproterozoic orogenic systems 

 Structurally-controlled end member of an iron oxide–copper–gold (IOCG) system:  
based on the presence of high concentrations of magnetite at Otjikoto coupled with 
the low concentrations of quartz, both of which are uncommon in orogenic 
deposits. 

This Report considers the Otjikoto and Wolfshag deposits to be part of a group of 
Namibian deposits, including Navachab, that have more similarities to each other than 
to the above suggested models, based on current knowledge.   

The features of the well-studied Navachab deposit include: 

 Sediment-hosted; rock types include marbles, biotite schists and calc-silicates; 

 Amphibolite to granulite metamorphic facies; 

 Two distinct mineralization styles: 

 Main "high grade" shoot is a semi-massive sulphide replacement body, the MC 
skarn.  The MC skarn shoot has a pipe-like geometry that plunges at 020° 
azimuth to the north–northeast, and is at least 2,000 m.  A second, similar, 
shoot sits structurally above and to the northeast of the MC skarn; 

 Strong sheeted quartz-sulphide vein system.  The sheeted vein zone is a large, 
lower grade, shear derived, extensional vein array; 

 Skarn assemblages: garnet ± tremolite/actinolite ± clinopyroxene + K-feldspar + 
quartz depending on host lithology; 

 The main sulphide mineral is pyrrhotite, with minor chalcopyrite, sphalerite, pyrite, 
arsenopyrite and maldonite; 

 Gold is most commonly free, with lower amounts locked within maldonite; 

 Deposit is cut by lamprophyre, aplite and pegmatite dykes; 

 Damara-age, structurally-controlled mineralization related to a combination of 
doming, dextral shearing and thrusts;  



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 8-2 

 

 

 Low magmatic component to hydrothermal fluids but possible high heat flow due to 
intrusions. 

Similarities between Navachab, and Otjikoto and Wolfshag include: 

 Nearly identical relative stratigraphic position; 

 Similar ore shoot direction and shallow plunge but different plunge direction (south 
versus north); 

 Gold is free; 

 Pyrrhotite dominant in deeper levels;  

 En-echelon vein systems and shoots extending to depth. 

Deposit differences include: 

 Otjikoto 

 Lack of direct intrusive association (no pegmatites); 
 High magnetite content of veins; 
 Low quartz but high sulphide veins; 
 No direct skarn or calc-silicate association; 
 Strong sodic enrichment in alteration (which may in part have played a role in 

creating a more brittle host rock); 
 Very low bismuth and low arsenic; 
 Generally higher free gold content (more nuggety) 
 Zonation from pyrite- to pyrrhotite-dominant domains 

 Wolfshag 

 Calcite rich and quartz poor veins; 
 Coarse blotchy pyrite in veins; 
 Replacement zones magnetite-pyrite rich and lack skarn assemblages; 
 Shear veins more prevalent than brittle veins; 
 Intense albitization and carbonate alteration. 

8.2 Comments on Deposit Types 

The local setting of the Otjikoto and Wolfshag deposits is reasonably well understood.   

An exploration model that uses the common features of the Navachab, Otjikoto and 
Wolfshag deposits would be acceptable as a regional targeting tool.

9.0 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Introduction 

The bedrock geology within the deposit area is covered by 10–15 m of calcrete, with 
only sporadic outcrops of Karibib Marble.  The exploration program therefore had to 
rely on a combination of airborne and ground geophysical surveys to map bedrock 
geology and identify exploration targets for drill testing.  Systematic drilling of the 
geophysical anomalies led to the discovery of the Otjikoto gold deposit.  

9.2 Grids and Surveys 

The pre-mining topography was established from a LiDAR survey completed by 
Southern Mapping Company on behalf of Teal Mining in 2008.  Pixel resolution was 
0.15 m, and topographic contours were provided at 0.5, 2 and 5 m contour intervals.   

9.3 Geochemistry 

Avdale completed an initial orientation survey over the Otjikoto deposit in 2001 which 
found the -180 fraction collected at the calcrete soil interface was the best medium to 
sample.  In general, the soil horizon is poorly developed, and the coarse gold which is 
characteristic of the deposit makes it difficult to get a representative sample at any 
sample site.  The initial soil survey thus identified spot anomalies of gold but no well-
defined anomaly over the mineralization at either deposit. 

Soil sampling was conducted from 2012 to 2014 over selected areas within EPL2410 
and EPL4309, with 10,114 samples collected.  Samples were typically spaced at 20 m 
intervals.  During 2014, an enzyme leach sampling program was completed within 
EPL2410, totalling 225 samples.  Samples were collected at 20 m station spacings. In 
2015–2016, an ionic leach program was completed on selected areas within EPL2410 
and EPL4309.  Station spacing was 40 m, and a total of 6,994 samples were collected. 

Sample locations are shown in Figure 9-1.

9.4 Geophysics 

9.4.1 Airborne Geophysical Surveys  

Airborne geophysical surveys completed to date are summarized in Table 9-1.  These 
datasets were merged and interpreted by Corner Geophysics and EarthMaps (Klauss 
Knupp). 

The Otjikoto deposit is indicated by a distinct magnetic high in the analytical signal of 
the processed high resolution airborne magnetic data covering the Otjikoto area 
(Figure 9-2) and is probably related to the magnetite and pyrrhotite content of the 
mineralization. 

The Wolfshag shoots are situated under the Otjikoto deposit and while the OTC 
mineralization is weaker, the presence of the overlying pyrrhotite and magnetite-
bearing sheeted veining, in particular the East 1 and Mag 2 shoots, effectively masks 
the underlying Wolfshag shoots (Figure 9-3).   

Where the Wolfshag zone contacts the base of the calcrete layer, it has a moderate 
magnetic and low electromagnetic response. 

9.4.2 Ground Geophysical Surveys 

Various ground geophysical surveys were conducted over the Otjikoto deposit area to 
follow-up airborne geophysical anomalies.  Ground geophysical surveys were done at 
grid line spacing ranging from 50–200 m.   

Magnetics 

A total of 468.7 line km of ground magnetic surveys has been conducted. 

Previous operators found detailed ground magnetics surveys to be a useful tool to aid 
in defining the mineralized zones; however, shallow, magnetite rich bands, particularly 
in the southern and eastern portions of the deposit, partially mask the more important 
pyrrhotite-rich sheeted vein mineralization.   

B2Gold uses the 2011 and 2013 NRG airborne magnetic survey data in preference to 
ground magnetic survey results.

Induced Polarization 

A total of 286.7 line km of induced polarization (IP) surveys has been conducted. 

In 2005 the Otjikoto grid was surveyed at 100 m line spacing with an IP gradient array 
(a = 50 m) using a number of electrode setups.  

The Wolfshag zone is not evident in the chargeability response in this survey with the 
zone flanked by stronger responses.  There is a weak resistivity response over the 
zone but this is secondary relative to the adjacent areas.   

As part of a 2012 condemnation program select lines were resurveyed using an IP 
pole–dipole array.  A weak resistivity low was visible, but no chargeability high over the 
Wolfshag zone was observed. 

Ground Electromagnetics, NSAMT and CSAMT 

A total of 96.7 line km of Max-Min electromagnetic surveys has been completed. 

Previous operators conducted a number of fixed horizontal loop frequency domain 
Max-Min electromagnetic (EM-34) surveys, with a strong emphasis in the area of good 
magnetic/IP responses.  In most instances, relatively good conductors were located at 
fairly shallow depths, except in the southern portion of the Otjikoto farm where depths 
in excess of 200 m were interpreted.  It is worth noting the decrease in conductivity in 
both the northern and southern portions of the survey area despite the presence of 
good chargeable material.  This indicates a change in the nature of the mineralization 
away from the main magnetic responses. 

Natural source audio-frequency magnetotellurics (NSAMT; 18 line km) and controlled-
source audio-frequency magnetotellurics (CSAMT; a single 4 km line) were tested at 
Otjikoto by previous operators.   

B2Gold has found that the Spectrum AEM data provides similar or better results. 

9.5 Petrology, Mineralogy, and Research Studies

mineralogical studies, in support of exploration vectoring, deposit understanding, and 
metallurgical designs.

9.6 Exploration Potential 

Exploration at Otjikoto remains focused on testing targets proximal to the current mine 
operations.  The highest-priority targets are the continued testing of the down plunge 
continuation of the Otjikoto and Wolfshag shoots below the current pit limits.  In 
addition to these targets, Figure 9-4 outlines several other areas that are considered 
prospective.  

Regional exploration work is ongoing with geophysics used as the principal tool to 
define targets under the extensive calcrete cover.  These programs are focusing on 
the Okonguarri Formation, where it is situated between the Footwall Marble and 
Karibib Formation marble.   

9.7 Comments on Exploration 

Exploration programs to date have identified the Otjikoto and Wolfshag deposits.  
Exploration targets remain to be investigated at depth, down-plunge of the current 
open pits, and in the vicinity of the deposits.

10.0 DRILLING 

10.1 Introduction 

Drilling completed to date includes rotary air blast (RAB), RC, and core drilling. 

Table 10-1 summarizes the drilling to 31 December, 2018 on a Project-wide basis, 
excluding grade control drilling.  Drill hole collars are shown in Figure 10-1 by drill type 
for the Project as a whole.  Of this drilling 242,014 m of core and RC drilling supports 
the Mineral Resource estimate at Otjikoto and 122,884 m of core and RC drilling 
supports the Mineral Resource estimate at Wolfshag.  Table 10-2 and Table 10-3 
show the drilling used for Mineral Resource estimation by drill type, and collar 
locations are shown for each deposit area in Figure 10-2 and Figure 10-3.  No RAB 
drilling is used in estimation.   

10.2 Drill Methods 

Drillcon Africa (Pty) Ltd, Ferrodrill Namibia (Pty), Xplor Drilling (Pty) Ltd and Eben 
Rautenbach have been employed to carry out the RAB and RC drilling.  RC drilling 
used a 4¾ inch (~120 mm) bit while later phases of RC drilling used 5½ inch 
(138 mm).  RAB drilling used a 4¾ inch (~120 mm) bit. 

Core drilling contractors have included Drillcon Africa (Pty) Ltd, Ferrodrill Namibia (Pty) 
Ltd, JGM Drilling and Exploration CC and Günzel Drilling using UDR2000DLS drill rigs, 
Atlas Copco C8C, C6C and CS14 rigs and a Christensen CS14 drill rig.  Core sizes 
include HQ (63.5 mm core diameter), NQ (47.6 mm), TNW (60.8 mm) and PQ 
(85 mm). 

Core was obtained using wire-line methods and unloaded from the core barrel, as 
drilled, into a 3 m "V" groove core stand, washed and fitted together.  Each run was 
measured and recoveries calculated.  Core was systematically placed into wooden, 
aluminium, or plastic core trays in the same orientation as it came out of the core 
barrel. 

Blocks were placed after each core run, indicating depth and recoveries for the run.  A 
written record of each run was maintained by the drilling contractor.  Core boxes were 
marked with the drill hole identity number, the intersection interval (start and final 
depths in that box), an arrow indicating which side is down-the-hole, and the box 
number.  The driller, drilling supervisors and drill geologist ensured the correct 
placement of the drill core in the core boxes. 

Core boxes were collected in the field by B2Gold staff and delivered to the B2Gold 
core logging and storage facility in Otjiwarongo.

10.3 Logging Procedures 

Sieved RAB samples are logged at the drill site. 

All RC drill holes were logged at the drill site during drilling with logging based on 
examination of a representative sample of washed chips collected from the sample 
split. RC geological logs capture the following: 

 Unit code: a summarized geological classification of the depth of oxidation and 
major identifiable units; 

 Rock type: an observation of the predominant rock type in each metre sample; 

 Vein (RC): a visual estimate of the total percentage of vein material per metre 
sample and the relative proportion of important economic and gangue minerals. 

Historically the core logging was conducted by recording information in two log types 
for each borehole: 

 Geological log of main units and rock; and 

 Vein log including each individual vein and its mineralogy. 

In 2012, the core logging format was changed to allow for capture of all crucial 
geological data on a single form.  In addition, the change in format allowed for the 
entry of alteration information and structural data, which had previously not been 
captured. 

Current core logging practices capture:  

 Unit code: summarized geological classification of major identifiable rock units; 

 Oxidation state: an observation of the state of oxidation of the major units; 

 Texture: a classification of the arrangement of the constituent grains or crystals in 
the major rock units; 

 Structure type: identification of the type of structures and all major lithological 
contacts and their measurements; 

 Alteration: an observation of the type of alteration within a rock unit and an 
estimate of its relative intensity; 

 Veining and mineralisation: a visual estimate of the total vein percentage within a 
unit or sample and the relative composition of important economic and gangue 
minerals within the veins; 

 Total core recovered (TCR): a measure of the total length of core within the run, 
including any broken material; 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 10-8 

 

 

 Rock quality designation (RQD): a measure of the sum of lengths of complete 
cylindrical core that is greater than 10 cm; 

 Joint count: a visual estimate of the number of joint sets present, based on the joint 
sets identified; 

 Rock strength: a classification of rock strength into weak or strong using the 
International Society for Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering (ISRM) table. 

Core is photographed both wet and dry, after logging and sample markup but before 
cutting. 

10.4 Recovery 

Drilling quality for both RC and diamond drilling is generally very good.  The recovered 
sample masses are recorded on appropriate field logging sheets by the field geologist.  

The overall average RC mass recovery was 87.45%.  The average RC recovery within 
the mineralized zones above 40 m elevation was 80.85% and the average recovery 
below 40 m elevation was 89.72%.  The relatively lower percentage recovery above 40 
m is related to the oxidized nature of both host rock and mineralization. 

Core recovery is documented at the drill by the drilling contractor and again during the 
geotechnical logging and for every sample during detailed logging.   

At Otjikoto, apart from the very weathered near-surface, the diamond core recoveries 
were very good, averaging 99.88% within the mineralized zone. 

Core recoveries at Wolfshag are for the most part very good with limited core loss 
associated with the near-surface core, 'chalky' shears, fault zones, and in fault related 
dissolution zones in the marbles.  Overall core recoveries in the mineralized zone 
average 99.40% to 99.52% in the low- and high-grade zones respectively. 

10.5 Collar Surveys 

Drill holes were initially spotted on cut grid lines, with stations and lines based on a 
combination of theodolite and measuring tape.  For angled holes, the set-ups made 
use of siting pickets for drill orientation line up.  The line-up was checked with compass 
and head inclination set with Brunton compass or degree rule device. 

Upon completion of a set of drill holes, the holes were surveyed by a contract 
professional land surveyor or the Otjikoto mine surveyor using Total Station differential 
global positioning system (DGPS) survey instruments.

10.6 Downhole Surveys 

All drill holes were surveyed using either a single or multi-shot down hole survey 
instrument (e.g. Reflex Ez-shot) which recorded the azimuth (magnetic) and dip.   

Prior to 2012, downhole survey measurements were taken at 50–100 m intervals, and 
in 2012 at 25 m intervals at Otjikoto deposit.   

From 2013 onwards, the down-hole survey was completed at 6 m (multi-shot) or 25 m 
intervals depending on the drilling contractor.  Multishot readings were downloaded 
directly from the Reflex instrument into Reflex data capture software.   

Corrections to the magnetic azimuth were made in accordance to the magnetic field 
declination in the area. 

10.7 Geotechnical and Hydrological Drilling 

Eight holes (1,303 m) were drilled in 2012 for Otjikoto open-pit stability studies.  The 
detailed geotechnical logging and sampling of these holes was completed by 
personnel from SRK Consulting Inc., Johannesburg, South Africa.  A series of 44 
shallow drill holes (1,021 m total) were drilled in 2012–2013 for civil studies of the 
proposed process plant and crusher sites.  An additional 12 Otjikoto geotechnical 
holes (2,269 m) were drilled in 2018.  Between 2014 and 2018, 41 Wolfshag 
geotechnical drill holes (8,088 m) were completed. 

A total of 19 hydrogeological (water monitoring/supply) holes (2,398 m) have been 
drilled. 

Figure 10-4 and Figure 10-5 show the locations of the geotechnical and hydrological 
drill holes.  

10.8 Metallurgical Drilling 

To provide sample material for testing of the different mineralization types within the 
Otjikoto deposit, 38 new metallurgical test sample drill holes (2,664 m) were drilled in 
2012 and an additional 27 "historic" holes were sampled.  All 2012 metallurgical holes 
were twins of previous RC and/or diamond drill holes. 

Six Wolfshag metallurgical test holes (806 m) were completed in 2014.  

Figure 10-4 and Figure 10-5 include the drill hole collars of the metallurgical drill holes.

10.9 Condemnation 

A total of 49 holes were drilled in 2012 as condemnation of the proposed infrastructure 
locations.  An additional seven condemnation holes (1,198 m) were drilled between 
2013 and 2016.  No significant zones of mineralization were intersected under the 
areas that were planned to host infrastructure. 

Figure 10-4 and Figure 10-5 show the collar locations of the condemnation drill holes. 

10.10 Grade Control 

Grade control drilling is undertaken in two 12-hour shifts, using contractor-operated 
127 mm diameter RC rigs.  Drill spacing varies between the two deposits.  At Otjikoto, 
a 6 m x 12 m drill spacing with a hole dip of -60º and azimuth of 302º is used.  
Wolfshag grade control uses an 8 x 10 m drill spacing, -60º dip and 350º azimuth.   

Drill holes are typically 26 m in depth to provide 20 m of coverage (i.e. two 10 m bench 
heights) and a 2 m subdrill to the third bench to provide sample overlap.  Preliminary 
and final grade control models are produced from the assay data, whereby the 
preliminary model is produced from the 50% coverage on the second bench, and the 
final grade control model is produced for the upper bench with 100% coverage. 

Quality assurance and quality control measures consist of whole sample recovery 
testwork performed by weighing the total material recovered per sample interval and 
comparing the value with theoretical expected weight per interval.  Density is 
measured for selected samples. 

10.11 Sample Length/True Thickness 

10.11.1 Otjikoto 

Initial exploration holes at Otjikoto were angled (10 holes), but owing to the relatively 
shallow dip of the mineralization and structural fabric it was decided that the deposit 
could be delineated with vertical holes. All of the RC holes were drilled vertically. 
Condemnation and geotechnical holes were drilled as angled holes during the 
prefeasibility and feasibility drilling. 

The orientation of drill sections (305° azimuth) was originally set up perpendicular to 
the geophysical targets and structural fabric of the area.  The mineralization shoot 
direction was recognized at a much later stage and therefore the drilling sections are 
slightly oblique to the shoots, but not to the overall trend of the deposit.  The 
mineralization shoot direction was recognized at a much later stage and therefore the 
drilling sections are slightly oblique to the shoots, but not to the overall trend of the 
deposit. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 10-13 

 

 

The shallower portions of the deposit were drilled on a 25 m x 25 m drill grid and the 
deeper levels at 25 m x 50 m and 50 m x 100 m drill hole spacing.  Infill holes were 
usually stopped just before or within the OTB marble marker horizon. 

Drilling is generally perpendicular to the mineralization, and drilled thicknesses 
approximate true thicknesses. 

10.11.2 Wolfshag 

Drilling on the Wolfshag zone used the Otjikoto grid and therefore the Wolfshag drill 
sections are also slightly oblique to the main trend of the zone.   

Drill spacing at Wolfshag is generally spaced at 25 x 55 m for most of the deposit with 
an area of 25 x 30 m and some 12.5 m infill on select lines targeting the nose of the 
upper fold (formerly WA). 

Drill holes were usually stopped within the footwall "blotchy" schist or the footwall 
marble to the west of Wolfshag mineralization. 

Drilling is generally perpendicular to the mineralization, and drilled thicknesses 
approximate true thicknesses. 

10.12 Comments on Drilling 

In the opinion of the QP, the quantity and quality of the logged geological data, collar, 
and downhole survey data collected in the exploration and infill drill programs are 
sufficient to support Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation and mine 
planning as follows: 

 Core and RC logging meets industry standards for gold exploration; 

 Collar surveys have been performed using industry standard instrumentation; 

 Downhole surveys were performed using industry standard instrumentation; 

 Recovery data from core and RC drill programs are acceptable; 

 Drill orientations are generally appropriate for the mineralization style and the 
orientation of mineralization for the bulk of the deposit area (refer to drill sections in 
Section 7); 

 Drilling has generally been done at regularly-spaced intervals and is considered 
representative of the deposit.  Drilling was not specifically targeted to the high-
grade portions of the deposit, rather, a relatively consistent drill spacing was 
completed.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 

11.1 Sampling Methods 

11.1.1 RAB 

RAB samples are collected on 1 m intervals, at a sample weight of about 25–30 kg.  
Samples are split using a riffle splitter into left (L1) and right (R1) samples.  The R1 
sample is split in half in a three-stage process until approximately 3 kg samples (L3 
and R3) are obtained.  The R3 sample is placed in a clearly-labelled A4 plastic bag 
and sent to the laboratory for analysis. 

The L3 sample is also placed in a clearly-labeled A4 plastic bag and transported to the 
core yard to be kept as a reference sample.  In the field, the L1 sample is dry screened 
using a 500 µm sieve and a representative portion of the +500 µm sample is placed in 
a clearly-labelled chip tray which is transported to the core yard for logging. 

11.1.2 RC 

RC samples were collected on 1 m intervals and split using a riffle splitter into left (L) 
and right (R) samples.  The sampling procedure is outlined in Figure 11-1. 

The L2 sample was dry screened using a 2 mm sieve and the +2 mm sample placed in 
a clearly labelled 500 mL plastic bottle, which was transported to the core yard for 
additional detailed geological logging or retained as a reference sample.  In the field, 
the R2 sample was wet screened using a 2 mm sieve and the +2 mm fraction logged 
for drilling control and geological information. 

11.1.3 Core 

The core was oriented, and a low point-line placed on the maximum dip of the 
prevalent dip of the fabric.  A second reference line was also placed down the entire 
length of the core to ensure that a standard half (the top half) of the core is always 
sampled.  Metre depth marks were placed on the core.  The core was then 
geologically logged.  The minimum sample length was 30 cm for HQ- and 40 cm for 
NQ-sized core. 

The core was split in half along the low point line with a core cutting saw.  Fresh water 
was used at all times while cutting and the diamond saw blades were cleaned with a 
blank medium (such as concrete) on a regular basis to prevent possible contamination.  
A quarter split of core was taken as a field duplicate.

The majority of the sampling on the project was done at 1 m sample intervals.  Three 
to five metres of material was sampled above and below the mineralized zones, and 
the zones were sampled continuously, without sample gaps.  In narrow mineralized 
zones that are separated by more than 3 m, a gap in the sampling was allowed.   

Early-stage sampling had samples labeled by hole number and end-of-sample depth.  
In 2012, the protocols were revised with sampling done on geology and introduction of 
a numeric sample tag system with information on each sample marked in the detailed 
logs, in the sample tag books, and on the core and boxes, as a further check on 
sampling. 

Samples were organized into shipments and QA/QC samples inserted in the sample 
stream. 

11.1.4 Grade Control 

RC grade control samples are collected at 2 m intervals and split using an inline cone 
splitter with a catch and dump box arrangement.  The first sample is discarded (0–2 m) 
if there is sufficient sub-drill from the bench above, due to generally poor recovery and 
possible contamination by mining of the bench above.  The "A" sample (7–10 kg) is 
bagged for transport to the onsite laboratory for screen fire assay. The laboratory 
sample is identified with pre-printed heat-resistant barcode tags, one inside the bag 
and one attached to the neck of the bag.  The "B" sample is sieved (>2 mm) and the 
coarse chippings are put in labelled bags for later chip logging.   

The splitter and catch box are cleaned with compressed air between each drill hole. 

11.2 Density Determinations 

As of 7 September, 2018, there were 25,633 specific gravity (SG) measurements 
available.  Methodologies used to collect the data include: 

 Pycnometer laboratory determinations on RC and drill core pulp samples (5,168 
determinations); 

 Water immersion (Archimedes) methodology on whole or half core.  Core samples 
could be unwaxed or waxed (3,063 unwaxed collected prior to 2008, and 17,402 
waxed collected since 2003; after 2008, all density samples were waxed). 

Initial comparisons between the pycnometer and water immersion methodologies 
indicated that results were quite similar (Wilton, 2006) so a program of systematic 
pycnometer determinations was initiated.  In 2012, however, a review of the 
pycnometer data versus the Archimedes data found that the pycnometer on pulp data 
over-estimated the SG in the oxide zone by 6–12 % and was 2.5% high in the 
mineralized fresh rock.  As a result, current estimates are based on Archimedes 
method sampling using waxed core. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 11-4 

 

 

SG samples subject to the Archimedes method were collected for the complete drill 
hole for numerous holes.  In 2012, a program of systematic sampling was undertaken 
whereby representative samples were taken of all lithologies, and at regular intervals 
(every 25 m), from a series of core holes scattered throughout the deposit.  
"Composite" samples were also collected, consisting of the measurement of all cores 
within the 1–2 m mineralized zones. 

All samples were air dried, weighed dry, then coated with several thin layers of paraffin 
wax.  Air bubbles were purged, and the core resealed with wax as needed.  Samples 
were allowed to cool for approximately 30 min prior to weighing again dry and then 
within a water bath using a suspended basket balance set up.  The SG calculations for 
each sample were completed via a set of automatic formulas using an Excel 
spreadsheet.  Unusual SG values were rechecked. 

11.3 Analytical and Test Laboratories 

The laboratories used for sample preparation and analysis over the Project history are 
summarized in Table 11-1. 

Currently, sample preparation is performed at ALS Global, Swakopmund, Namibia.  
Primary analysis is undertaken by ALS Global, Johannesburg, RSA.  The Otjikoto 
mine laboratory or ALS Chemex in Vancouver, Canada, are used as umpire 
(reference) laboratories. 

11.4 Sample Preparation and Analysis 

11.4.1 Sample Preparation 

Sample preparation for gold and multielement analysis in the early programs consisted 
of: 

 Crush complete sample to -2 mm; 

 Pulverize entire sample (3 minutes in LM5 "ring and puck" mill); 

 Screen with 106 μm sieve; 

 Accurate weight determined for both fractions (after pulverizing mass);

Later, the preparation method for gold and multielement analysis was modified such 
that: 

 Each sample is dried and crushed to -2 mm;  

 A maximum of 1.2 kg sample is riffle split and pulverized in an LM2 JC2000 bowl.  

 The prepared pulp sample is then screened using a plastic screen to obtain the 
+106 and -106 size fractions;   

 The +106 size fraction is packaged with the plastic mesh for fire assay, as this step 
mitigates the possibility of coarse gold becoming stuck in a regular mesh screen; 

 250 g of the -106 size fraction is riffle split and packaged for shipping to the 
analytical laboratory. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine

Sample preparation for LECO analysis consisted of the following.  The pulped sample 
was weighed out and placed in a ceramic dish or boat.  An accelerant was added to 
act as a flux and improve fluidity and oxidation of the carbon and sulphur. Heating was 
accomplished in a high frequency induction furnace as this provides both speed and 
accuracy.  Any sulphur or carbon was converted to SO2 or CO2, respectively.  These 
gases absorb infrared radiation at specific wavelengths which is proportional to the 
concentration of the carbon or sulphur in the sample.  Any water in the sample was 
removed by passing the gases produced through magnesium perchlorate as water 
interferes with the analysis.  Standards of known carbon or sulphur concentration were 
used for calibration. 

11.4.2 Gold Analyses 

Metallic Versus Fire Assay Comparisons 

During the initial phase of exploration of the Otjikoto deposit, the presence of coarse 
particulate gold was noted.  In order to resolve the high nugget effect within the 
sampling results, discussions were held with numerous analytical laboratories 
regarding the optimal assay procedure to accurately establish the gold content of the 
sample material.  Samples from inside and outside the mineralized zone were selected 
and an orientation screen fire assay program at SGS Lakefield (referred to as 'pulps' 
and 'metallics') was undertaken in 2011.  

An orientation batch of 128 RC samples was submitted to confirm the applicability of 
this method.  The results of the orientation samples found that 39.4% of the gold 
occurs in the +106 μm and 60.6% in the -106 μm size fraction (Avdale, 2004) and that 
one screen fire assay is equivalent to 14 individual fire assays (Lytle, et al., 2013).   

This confirmed that significant coarse gold is present in the deposit and the screen fire 
assay methodology provides a more representative analysis of the gold content of the 
samples.   

In 2012, a separate internal study was completed to look into the viability 
(operationally) of using a straight fire assay versus the screen fire methodology.  
Screen fire assays consistently reported higher grade in the 0.4–3.5 g/t gold range but 
fire assays are similar, to slightly higher, in the >3.5 g/t gold range.  This had 
implications for defining ore-waste boundaries around the cut-off range.   

In 2013, a similar study was conducted based on duplicate fire and metallic screen 
assays for the majority of the Wolfshag samples submitted for analysis in 2013.  The 
study concluded that <9 g/t gold fire assay underreports the gold in a sample relative 
to the metallic screen assay procedure, except in the 1.5–3.0 g/t range.

Analytical Methods 

The analytical method consisted of: 

 +106 μm size fraction assayed (fire assay) to completion (typically 10–50 g); 

 -106 μm size fraction initially split with a rotary splitter; a riffle splitter is currently 
used; 

 Two -106 μm size fraction sub-samples are fire assayed (50 g); 

 Resultant gold grades combined using weighted (mass) calculation. 

Gold grades were determined using a standard fire assay methodology with either 
atomic absorption (AA) for samples that assayed ≤10 g/t Au or were reassayed with a 
gravimetric finish if the sample assayed ≥10 g/t Au.  Assay method codes for each 
certificate of analysis are preserved in the database. 

Sample material submitted to Intertek Genalysis and ALS Minerals closely followed 
this method, except that two 25 g aliquots (GEN1 and GEN2) from the -106 μm 
fraction were combined for each sample to determine the gold grade of the -106 μm 
fraction.  The equation is: 

Au (g/t) = (Au (g/t) +106 μm x weight of +106μm) + (weighted average of two Au (g/t) -106 μm x weight of 
-

106 μm)   

    total weight of sample after pulverizing 

11.4.3 Multi-Element Analyses 

Core and RC samples were sent for multi-element analysis.  The most frequently used 
methods include inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectroscopy (ICP-MS), 
inductively-coupled-plasma atomic-emission-spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and X-ray 
fluorescence (XRF) for the determination of precious metal, base metals and multi-
element content. 

Typically, the analytical packages include the following elements: Au, Pd, Pt, Ag, Al, 
Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, K, Mg, Mo, Ni, P, S, Sb, Sn, Te, V, W, Zn and Zr.  

The analyses were completed at Intertek Genalysis in Perth and ALS Minerals in 
Vancouver. 

11.4.4 LECO Analyses 

Sulphur analysis was performed on select groups of samples using either a LECO or 
similar carbon and sulphur analyzer.   

The LECO and carbon and sulphur analyses were completed at Intertek Genalysis in 
Perth and ALS Minerals in Vancouver.

11.5 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

11.5.1 Density 

A QA/QC program for the SG measurements was initiated in 2012 with the use of 
borosilicate glass cylinders of known SG as reference standards and the monitoring 
and control of the immersion bath temperature.  The bath temperature was kept at 
approximately 22°C, as per ASTM C97-96 and ASTM C914-95.  The standards were 
measured every ~20 samples.  The SG of the standards was plotted regularly as a 
check on the quality of the overall testing procedures. 

11.5.2 Analytical QA/QC 

Introduction 

QA/QC procedures have been in place since the start of the Project and are 
documented through procedure manuals.  Samples used include blanks, certified 
reference materials (CRMs) and duplicates.  In addition to QA/QC insertion by B2Gold 
and predecessors, the analytical laboratories also provide QA/QC data with the 
sample analytical certificates. 

Each sample analytical certificate was vetted by the database manager and failures 
were recorded in a table of failures.  This table lists the results of the QA/QC, any 
follow-up action and the final decision to include or not include the sample analytical 
certificate results in resource estimation.  All sample analytical certificate results are 
retained in the database; however, not all sample analytical certificate results can 
support Mineral Resource estimates.  Laboratories are requested to review and/or re-
run submittals until the submittal passes QA/QC. 

Monthly QA/QC reports are prepared documenting the laboratory performance 

Blanks 

Dolomite aggregate (50 mm fragments) from a local source in Otjiwarongo has been 
used as the blank material for the Project.  Blanks are inserted at 1:20 rate.   

The failure threshold is deemed to be 10 x the detection limit, i.e. >100 ppb.  To date, 
the contamination rate is not an issue with any of the primary analytical laboratories. 

Initial blank failures mostly correlate with blank "wash" samples inserted after samples 
with visible gold to minimize the potential carry-over of gold into the next samples.  In 
some cases, the failure pertained to a sample mix up, in which case the error was 
examined and rectified.

Certified Reference Materials 

Three CRM standard groups, low-, medium- and high-grade, are used to monitor 
laboratory precision and accuracy.  The standards were purchased from OREAS, 
Australia, and CDN Resource Laboratories, Canada. 

The CRM insertion rate was based on the fusion oven charge: 

 Intertek Genalysis:  1:20; 

 ALS Minerals:  1:38. 

Prior to 2012, the failure rate was based on + 20% of the expected mean value (EV) of 
the CRM and warning at 10% of EV.  In 2012, this was changed to the greater of 
+10% or + 3 standard deviations (3SD) of the CRM mean.  Warning limits were set at 
+2SD, with failure based on two or three consecutive 2SD CRM warnings falling on the 
same side of the warning limit, interpreted to indicated that a laboratory bias may be 
present. 

Duplicates 

Field duplicate samples were collected at a frequency of 1:20.   

Commencing in 2012, in addition to the field duplicates, preparation and pulp 
duplicates were requested to ensure precision was monitored after all preparation 
phases.   

The overall precision of the various laboratories is poor, about 20% for pulp duplicates.  
This is due to the high nugget component of the gold mineralization.   

11.5.3 Resampling  

A review of sample preparation procedures over time that was completed in 2016 
indicated that in some sample batches, coarse material was being left in the minus-
fraction submitted for assay.  As a result, in late 2016 and early 2017, a re-sampling 
and re-assaying program was undertaken, consisting of about 14,000 remnant half-
core samples.  The re-assay data replaced the original analyses in the database.  

11.5.4 Check Assays 

Current quarterly check assay programs include both coarse reject and minus fraction 
sample umpires and reject and pulp granulometry evaluation.

11.6 Databases 

11.6.1 History 

Prior to 2004, the database and QA/QC management was performed by an external 
consulting group.   

From 2004 to 2012 the database management was under the supervision of Dr. 
Stephen Frindt.  The database in use was the Standardized Approach Borehole Log 
Evaluation (Sable).  Dr. Frindt was in direct consultation with the Sable software 
developers.  The Sable database provided an export format which could be directly 
exported to resource modelling software. 

During 2012, all Sable data were moved over to a Microsoft Access database.  The 
Access database was checked against the Sable database for errors in conversion.  
The original Sable database was preserved for reference and all original Sable tables 
were retained in the Access database. 

11.6.2 Data Upload 

Logs 

Prior to 2012, all logged data was captured on paper and entered by the geologist 
and/or the database personnel into the Sable Sputnik remote data entry module.  
Once entered into Sputnik, the field data was checked and verified by the logging 
geologist and signed-off on prior to entry into the database by the database manager. 
Within Sable, a series of checks/data verifications were performed which examined the 
data for issues such as overlapping samples.  A report was produced by Sable and 
any errors were identified, addressed and corrected in the original data and the final 
database. 

From 2012–2018, all logged data have been entered into Excel templates by data 
entry personnel.  Inputs in various Excel columns are locked in a "data validation" 
format which only allowed correct coding to be entered within the Excel spreadsheet.  
The entered data are then printed out and a 100% check is done against the original 
logged data or other original information (e.g. downhole survey data).  A further check 
is completed by the logging geologist prior to the data being entered into the Access 
database by the database manager. 

Downhole Survey Data 

Downhole survey data were received as hand-written pieces of paper from the drill 
foremen, or as a digital download from the Reflex Ez-Shot instrument.  In the case of 
the hand-written information these data were manually entered into an Excel file and 
checked.  As a further verification, the data were occasionally checked against the 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 11-11 

 

 

actual instrument data in the field and downloaded from the instrument (Reflex Ez-
shot) and checked against the written information.  Data downloaded from the survey 
instrument were loaded directly into the database.  Obvious errors in drill hole 
downhole survey data were flagged as do-not-use, "N", in the database.  As an 
additional check, a plot was completed of drill holes and any sudden jogs in the drill 
hole traces were reviewed for validity. 

Collar Survey Data  

Collar survey data received from the professional surveyors were loaded directly into 
the database and the original copies retained and kept with each drill hole file.  
Temporary field GPS drill collar coordinate data were removed from the database and 
replaced with the final survey data. 

Assay Data 

Prior to 2012, all assay data were received from the laboratories in the form of csv files 
and directly imported into the Sable database.  

From 2012–2018, csv files received from the laboratories required a reformat prior to 
importation into Access.  The reformatting is completed by a macro(s), reducing the 
chance of human error.  The original analytical information is not tampered with and 
the raw data are imported into the database.  The original and digital assay certificates 
are retained in separate files for reference and for verification against the database 
information.   

As a quick review for obvious errors, a visual check of each certificate of analysis is 
completed prior to importing any assay data into the database.   

In all cases of data falling below the detection limit, the values are reported as half the 
detection limit (e.g. for gold <0.01 g/t is reported as 0.005). 

11.6.3 Backups 

A master of the databases is maintained by the database manager. The database is 
copied and backed up on the B2Gold servers in Otjiwarongo and Vancouver, Canada 
on a regular basis. 

Original data are very well organized with all original documentation kept in individual 
drill hole files, which include all logged information, original assay certificates, and 
survey information. 

11.7 Sample Security 

Only authorized drill and B2Gold or predecessor personnel were allowed at the drilling 
sites. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 11-12 

 

 

The Otjiwarongo core yard is surrounded by a security fence with the office and 
complex alarmed and monitored by a local independent security firm. 

Unloading of the core tube was controlled by the driller and site geologists.  Checks 
were done at site to ensure all core was placed in the boxes correctly prior to transport 
to the logging facility.  The drill geologist and senior personnel signed-off on the 
detailed daily drill reports at site and took possession of the core at that time.  

Core was transported directly to the Otjiwarongo core yard by B2Gold or predecessor 
personnel.   

Sample shipments are currently controlled by B2Gold exploration operations and 
database managers.  Transportation to the laboratory is done by an independent 
bonded courier company (ACT Logistics) with appropriate sign-off documentation 
accompanying each shipment at both shipping and receiving.  Sample shipment 
damage, if any, was noted by the laboratory upon receipt, and B2Gold personnel were 
immediately notified.  Additionally, the laboratory immediately notifies B2Gold of any 
discrepancies between sample submittal information, shipment weights and samples 
received by the laboratory.  Any issues are addressed before preparation of the 
samples commences. 

11.8 Sample Storage 

Reference RC chip samples and split rejects are retained in a secure storage facility in 
Otjiwarongo or at the Otjikoto mine site.  Additional laboratory coarse rejects are 
retained in secure storage facilities in Johannesburg, South Africa and Walvis Bay, 
Namibia. 

All logged and sampled drill core is kept in the core yard or secure storage facilities in 
Otjiwarongo or at the Otjikoto mine site.  Representative core intervals may be missing 
for portions of drill holes used for metallurgical and geotechnical testing.   

11.9 Comments on Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

In the opinion of the QP, sample preparation, security, analytical procedures, QA/QC 
insertion rates, data validation steps, and core and sample storage meet or exceed 
industry standards.  The data are acceptable to support Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve estimates and can be used in mine planning.

12.2 External Data Verification 

A number of independent technical reports were prepared on the Project, prior to 
B2Gold obtaining an interest in the Project.  These are listed in Section 2.7.  No 
material issues with the data were identified in these reports. 

B2Gold prepared a technical report using Form 43-101F1 in 2013, detailing the results 
of a completed 2012 feasibility study.  Investigations and data validation in support of 
the feasibility study identified no material issues with the information available at the 
time. 

12.3 Comments on Data Verification 

The checks performed by B2Gold staff, including the continuous QA/QC checks 
conducted by the database administrator and Project geologists on the assay data and 
geological data, plus the unannounced visits to the preparation and assay laboratories 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 12-3 

 

 

are in line with or above industry standards for data verification.  These checks have 
identified no material issues with the data or the Project database.   

The 2013 technical report included a review of data verification.  No material issues 
with the data or the Project database were identified at that time.  

As part of site visits from 2011–2018, the QP has personally verified a portion of the 
data supporting the estimates, including:  RC drilling and sampling procedures at the 
rig during drilling; core drilling at various drills and the core retrieval and handling 
procedures; core logging and markup procedures and protocols; core photography 
procedures and quality; core cutting and sampling procedures; core storage and 
security; SG measurement and SG QA/QC procedures; sample shipping and chain of 
custody procedures; data entry and data verification procedures; and accuracy of 
geological interpretations and grade interpretations on section and plan, and in 
geological models.    

As a result of the data verification, the QP concludes that the Project data and 
database are acceptable for use in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation, 
and can be used to support mine planning.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Introduction 

Metallurgical testwork was carried out in support of plant design to treat material from 
the Otjikoto deposit.  Additional testwork conducted on mineralization from the 
Wolfshag deposit indicated that no major plant design changes were warranted to 
allow for treatment of this ore.  The following subsections provide a summary of the 
metallurgical testwork performed and the projected recovery estimates.  

13.2 Metallurgical Testwork 

13.2.1 Testwork Completed on Otjikoto Deposit 

Testwork completed on the Otjikoto deposit is summarized in Table 13-1.  The four 
composite types tested were: 

 XR1:  oxide; 

 XR2:  pyrite + marcasite-dominant mineralization; 

 XR3:  pyrrhotite-dominant mineralization; 

 XR4:  mixture of XR2 and XR3 sulphide mineralization. 

13.2.2 Testwork Completed on Wolfshag Deposit 

Testwork performed on samples from the Wolfshag deposit is summarized in  
Table 13-2.  Initial work in 2012 consisted of bottle roll tests.  A more comprehensive 
testwork program was conducted in 2014.  

Wolfshag Samples 

In 2014, composites were generated from drill core for the following metallurgical tests: 

 Comminution; 

 Metallurgical recovery; 

 Recovery variability. 

The majority of test samples were collected from within the revised March 2014 
proposed 'optimum' pit shell; not the highest NPV pit shell.

A total of 2,258 kg of Wolfshag zone composite test samples were shipped to SGS 
Lakefield in Ontario, Canada, for testing. 

Master metallurgical composites "WA composite" and "WB composite" were collected 
to provide representative samples of the Wolfshag WA and WB shoots respectively.  a 
third master composite, "M2", was assembled from half-core, but as a combined WA 
and WB shoot sample rather than an individual Wolfshag shoot.  The composite 
contained more WA than WB samples since WA is the dominant shoot in the resource. 

Sixteen recovery variability samples were compiled to provide test material 
representing different gold grade ranges, shoots, mineralization and geographic 
distribution.  Hanging wall and footwall dilution was commonly added to most of the 
composite samples.  Two oxidized mineralized shoot samples, OX1 and OX2, were 
collected from the north end of the zone.  These are lower grade, reflecting the lower 
overall gold content in the lower shoots in the northern part of the zone.  Samples with 
minor oxide component were included in several variability composites and in the 
master composites to reflect presence of oxidized fault zones and their area of 
influence within the zone.  One sample, "Clay 1", provided a test sample with high clay 
content.  The sample represents an upper end member for clay content with the clay a 
combination of clay gouge and chalky (clay-calcite) shears. 

Six holes were drilled to provide material for comminution testwork.  The holes were 
drilled as intermediate (12.5 m centres) holes rather than twins in order to provide 
additional geological information for the resource model. 

Two "bulk" commination PQ whole core samples were compiled, and the core shipped 
intact in core boxes to SGS Lakefield.  The first sample was considered to be 
representative of the average mineralization in the WA shoot, while the second

composite was albitite dominant and considered more representative of a lower-grade 
interval of the WA shoot. 

Comminution variability composites were selected from the drilled HQ core intervals 
and the whole core shipped to SGS Lakefield in plastic pails.  Four composite samples 
were collected from the HQ core to provide a range of characteristics to test for 
comminution variability over a limited geographic distribution.  These composites were 
collected from the WA shoot.  Overall the samples represent visually moderate and 
lower-grade portions of the WA shoot.  A fifth sample was added of "high-grade" 
material from a combination of the WA and WB shoot. All samples contain internal and 
0.5 to 1 m of hanging wall and footwall dilution, commonly consisting of either albitite 
or marble. 

Comminution 

JKTech and SMC Testing 

JK drop-weight tests were performed on the two PQ core comminution composites.  
The data was interpreted by Contract Support Services, the North American agent for 
JKTech. 

In addition to the JK drop-weight test, an SMC test was performed on the two PQ core 
comminution composites, as well as on the five variability samples.  The SMC test is 
an abbreviated version of the standard JK drop-weight test performed on rocks from a 
single size fraction (-31.5/+26.5 mm in this case).   

The Comm-1 sample was characterized as soft with respect to both resistance to 
impact (A × b) and abrasion breakage (ta), while sample Comm-2 was categorized as 
medium for these two parameters.  The A x b from the variability samples ranged from 
48.4 to 92.9, which placed the samples in the soft to medium range of hardness.  The 
relative specific gravity varied from 2.66 to 2.83. 

Bond Tests 

The Bond low-energy impact test determines the Bond crusher work index (CWI), used 
to calculate power requirements for crusher sizing.  The test was performed on the two 
PQ core comminution composites.  Between 19 to 20 rock specimens in the 
-75/+50 mm size fraction were shipped to FLSmidth for the completion of the Bond 
low-energy impact test.  With a CWI value of 6.3 and 9.1 kWh/t, the Comm-1 and 
Comm-2 composites were categorized as soft and medium, respectively, which is 
coherent with the drop-weight test results. 

All seven comminution samples were submitted for the Bond rod mill test at 14 mesh 
(1,180 µm).  All the samples were characterized as very soft, with the exception of 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 13-5 

 

 

samples Comm-2 and Comm-VAR 1, which fell in the soft category with RWI's of 11.7 
and 11.6 kWh/t, respectively. 

Bond ball mill grindability tests were performed at 150 mesh of grind (106 µm) on all 
seven comminution samples, plus the Main Composite.  All the samples were 
characterized as very soft, with the exception of samples Comm-2 and Comm-VAR 1, 
which fell in the soft category with Ball mill Work Indices (BWI) of 10.8 and 11.7 kWh/t, 
respectively. 

All seven comminution samples were submitted for Bond abrasion testing.  The 
abrasion indices (Ai) ranged from 0.149 g up to 0.239 g for all samples tested, which 
placed the Wolfshag samples in the medium range of abrasiveness. 

Unconfined Compressive Strength Test 

Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) testing was performed on the two 
comminution composites.  For each composite, between four to five full core pieces 
were submitted for testing.  The testwork was completed at the SGS Beckley site, 
located in West Virginia, United States.  During the tests, axial force, axial deformation, 
and circumferential deformation variables were recorded to generate UCS along with 
Young's Modulus.  The UCS averaged 78.4 and 60.1 MPa, for samples Comm-1 and 
Comm-2, respectively.  The two samples were categorized as soft with respect to 
UCS. 

Grinding Circuit Design 

A simulation program was completed by SGS Lakefield to estimate the throughput rate 
of the Wolfshag samples using the grinding circuit designed for the Otjikoto deposit. 

It was requested to perform the simulations in both SAB (semi-autogenous grind 
(SAG) mill followed by a ball mill) and SABC (SAB with a pebble crusher) 
configurations with a SAG mill feed F80 of 150 mm.  The product size target was a P80 
of 74 µm for both grinding circuit configurations. 

The simulations were performed on the average and 85th percentile results from the 
Otjikoto deposit, as well as on the seven individual samples from the Wolfshag 
deposit, along with its average.  An average CWI of 7.7 kWh/t was assumed for the 
five Wolfshag variability samples based on results of the crushing work indices for the 
two Wolfshag PQ core composites. 

Modelling assumed that the SAG mill would be equipped with a trommel and the 
trommel undersize would feed a vibratory screen, while the trommel oversize would 
feed the pebble crusher.  The classification screen oversize would be returned to the 
SAG mill while the screen undersize would feed the ball mill circuit.  A trommel 
aperture of 13 mm was used for the simulations and aperture of 4 mm was simulated 
for the classification screen.

The evaluation was carried out using the JKSimMet software, along with Bond's third 
theory of comminution.  All the simulations were performed with a SAG mill charge 
level of about 25%, which is the average in the JKSimMet model database, and is 
considered optimal for throughput.  The power requirement to the ball mill circuit was 
calculated using the RWI, BWI, and the third theory of comminution, after correction for 
the fines in the SAG product with the phantom cyclone technique.  The operating 
power requirement for the pebble crusher was calculated using the CWI and the third 
theory of comminution. 

The ball mill power requirements were reported at the motor input.  The average 
crusher power requirements, calculated using the Bond crushing work index, were 
reported at the motor input.  Bond's equation reports the crusher power at the motor 
output, and thus a correction factor of 0.95 was applied for drive losses.  The total 
gross power was obtained by adding the power requirements for the pebble crushing, 
SAG milling and ball milling.  The total specific power requirement was calculated by 
dividing the gross power requirement by the total feed rate. 

For the variability simulations, a constant ball charge of 12% was assumed in the SAG 
mill and the SAG mill speed was varied to maximize the throughput rate.  B2Gold 
indicated that the SAG mill speed can be varied from 50% to 82% of its critical speed.  
The ball mill power requirement was adjusted by varying the mill load to achieve a P80 
of 74 µm. 

The throughput rate was maximized by increasing the SAG mill speed up to 82% of 
the critical speed.  The SAG ball charge was fixed at 12%.  The maximum throughput 
rate was limited to 381 t/h (3.0 Mt/a), or 25% above the original plant design target 
(2.4 Mt/a).  The final grind P80 was fixed at 74 µm and the ball mill power allowed to 
vary since the ball mill power requirement would be much lower in a SAB configuration 
compared to SABC configuration (finer T80 and lower throughput rate).  The maximum 
throughput rate of 381 t/h was achieved for all the samples simulated.  The average 
ball mill power draw to achieve a P80 of 74 µm was 1,941 kW, at a throughput rate of 
381 t/h.   

An additional SAB simulation was done at the request of B2Gold using the hardest 
sample from the Wolfshag deposit (Comm-VAR 1).  The simulation was performed 
with a SAG ball charge of 15% and a speed of 78% of the critical speed, without 
throughput limitation.  A maximum theoretical throughput rate of 428 t/h (3.4 Mt/a) was 
reached and 3,370 kW were required at the ball mill to achieve the target grind size. 

The same exercise was performed with the SABC circuit.  The throughput rate was 
maximized by increasing the SAG mill speed up to 82% of the critical speed.  The SAG 
ball charge was fixed at 12%.  The maximum throughput rate was limited to 475 t/h 
(3.7 Mt/a), or 25% above the target (3.0 Mt/a).  The final grind P80 was fixed at 74 µm 
and the ball mill power requirement was calculated.

As for the SAB simulations, the maximum throughput rate of 475 t/h was achieved for 
all the samples.  The average ball mill power draw to achieve a P80 of 74 µm was 
2,574 kW.   

An additional SAB simulation was done using sample Comm-VAR 1.  The simulation 
was performed with a SAG ball charge of 15% and a mill speed of 78% of the critical 
speed, without throughput limitation.  A maximum theoretical throughput rate of 507 t/h 
(4.0 Mt/a) was achieved.  The circuit was ball mill limited and a final P80 of 77 µm could 
only be achieved.   

The SAG-specific power requirements ranged from 8.1 to 9.5 kWh/t for the SAB, and 
from 6.7 to 7.8 kWh/t for the SABC configuration.  The ball mill specific power 
requirements for a P80 of 74 µm ranged from 3.5 to 7.6 kWh/t for the SAB, and 3.8 to 
8.0 kWh/t for the SABC configuration.  The overall specific power requirements ranged 
from 12.0 to 16.8 kWh/t for the SAB, and 10.9 to 15.6 kWh/t for the SABC 
configuration.   

Mineralogy 

August 2014 

One sample, identified as Main Comp, was submitted for mineralogical examination by 
SGS Lakefield, which included bulk mineralogy, and gold deportment (mineral 
speciation, grain size, liberation, and association). 

The sample was dominantly composed of plagioclase (38%), with moderate ankerite 
(19%), calcite (18%), and quartz (14%), with minor amounts of pyrite (4%), Fe-oxides 
(2%), and trace amounts (<2%) of chlorites/clays and other minerals.  

The sample was preconcentrated by heavy liquid separation (HLS) at an SG of 3.1 to 
obtain a sink and float fraction.  The sink fraction and a ~60 g aliquot of HLS float, 
were submitted for superpanning (SP) to obtain several SP fractions.  Gold was 
concentrated in the HLS sink fractions, accounting for 96% of the total gold assay, with 
7% of the total sample mass, respectively.  The majority of gold in the HLS sink 
fraction was further concentrated in the SP tip and SP sulphides fractions, which 
account for 71% of the total gold assay, with 3% of the total sample mass, indicating a 
highly-efficient gravity recovery. 

Gold and silver minerals were identified using an optical microscope and scanning 
electron microprobe energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis.  The major 
gold mineral is native gold (Au >75%, Ag <25%), with few silver/antimony (allargentum 
[Ag1-xSbx]), and silver/tellurium (hessite [Ag2Te] and stutzite [Ag5Te3]) minerals.  
Unknown alloys of Ag–Pb–Te, Ag–Te, and Ag–Te–Cu were also identified. 

A total of 108 gold grains were identified using optical microscopy and SEM-EDS on 
polished sections of the SP product, including 47 liberated (with an average size of

27.3 μm), 20 exposed (with an average size of 4.6 μm), and 41 locked (with an 
average size of 8.5 μm). 

By frequency, 78% of all gold grains are ≤10 μm in size, 13% are between 10 and 
30 μm, and 9% are >30 μm, while by surface area, these account for 0.7%, 2.6%, and 
97%, respectively.  Of the >30 μm gold grains, the coarsest grains (over 100 μm) 
account for only 3.7% by frequency, but >85% by surface area. 

October 2014 

A total of 19 samples were examined by SGS Lakefield; 16 were recovery variability 
samples and three were metallurgical composites; Main composite, WA composite and 
WB composite.   

Head analysis, of all the samples, performed in triplicate, showed the averages of the 
three determinations ranged from 2.54 g/t Au (WB Composite) to 6.46 g/t Au (WA 
Composite). The Main composite head grade was 3.75 g/t Au.  The recovery variability 
samples head grades ranged from 0.61 g/t Au (WB2) to 12.3 g/t Au (WA8).  The 
metallurgical composites prepared under the first phase of the project head grades 
were generally lower; they ranged from 1.64 g/t Au (XR1) to 1.75 g/t Au (XR3). The 
variability samples from this phase ranged from 0.31 g/t Au to 9.8 g/t Au. 

The sulphide content varied significantly in the recovery variability samples, from 
<0.05% in OX2 to 3% in WB8.  The sulphide content of the Main composite, WA 
composite and WB composite were 2.22%, 1.80% and 1.69% respectively. 

A deportment study on the Main composite confirmed that greater than 85% of the 
gold grains (based on surface area) are coarser than 100 μm.  The major gold mineral 
was native gold. 

An extended-gravity recoverable gold (E-GRG) test was performed on each of the 
metallurgical composites.  Over 80% of the gold was found to be gravity recoverable, 
at a grind size of 80% passing 83 μm to 93 μm. 

All of the samples were subjected to gravity separation at a grind size of 80% passing 
74 μm.  The gravity concentrates were intensively leached, and the tailings were 
leached under standard conditions.  The overall gold recovery and extraction for the 
metallurgical recovery composites was very similar, the lowest value was 98.7% and 
the highest 99.0%.  The range of recovery variability results was slightly larger; the 
lowest value was 96.5% and the highest 99.3%.  

Cyanide destruction testwork was also undertaken on a sample of Main Composite. 
Using the SO2/air process, it was determined that the pulp tested was amenable to 
cyanide destruction.  Low levels of SO2, i.e. equivalent to 3 g SO2 per g of weak acid 
dissociable cyanide (CNWAD) or 0.18 g SO2 per litre of feed pulp and no additional

Namibia

March 2019 Page 13-9 

 

 

copper reduced the CNWAD in the pulp to 0.1 mg/L.  This level was significantly less 
than the 10 mg/L target. 

Two samples were submitted for rheology testwork, one was a leached pulp containing 
clay (Clay 1) and the other was a sample of the Main Composite that had been 
subjected to cyanide destruction (CND).  The critical solids density (CSD) is the solids 
density value range above which a small increase of the solids density causes a 
significant decrease of the flowability of the slurry.  The CSD value range is also 
predictive of the maximum underflow solids density achievable in a commercial 
thickener.  Practically, the CSD delineates the underflow density and pumpability 
ranges achievable in practice, with reasonable friction pressure losses for 
economically-feasible operation. 

The CSD of Clay 1 CN 42 Pulp thickened sample was approximately 54% w/w solids, 
displaying a yield stress of 42 Pa under unsheared flow conditions and 10 Pa under 
sheared (i.e. post constant shearing) conditions.  Based on the yield stress responses, 
the "CIP/CIL pre-optimized feed solids density" was ~47% w/w solids which displayed 
~10 Pa yield stress; the CIP/CIL pre-optimized feed solids density is the probable 
target solids density for CIP/CIL feed pulps that results in a yield stress that is less 
than 10 Pa.  The 10 Pa yield stress is considered as an acceptable upper-limit for 
efficient mass transfer in the leaching and adsorption process. 

It was recommended that the gold adsorption kinetics and equilibrium testing (followed 
by subsequent modelling) should be conducted at ~47.0% and 42.5% w/w solids, 
which corresponded to approximately 10 and 4 Pa yield stress cut-off values. 

Results 

Overall, the metallurgical testwork results indicated that the Wolfshag deposit had 
similar metallurgical characteristics to Otjikoto.  

13.3 Recovery Estimates 

13.3.1 Otjikoto 

Average life-of-mine gold recoveries were estimated to be 95.6% based on the initial 
testwork.  The contribution of the total GRG recovery (gravity and intensive dissolution) 
and leach recovery to the overall recovery is shown in Figure 13-1. 

Figure 13-2 shows the relationships between sample head grade and GRG recovery.  
It is clear that a lot of scatter or variability exists, and that poor correlations are 
observed, as reflected in the R2 of the correlations. It therefore does not seem prudent 
to link gravity recovery estimates to feed grade, given that the average GRG 
contribution is 75%, and that a poor fit is observed between gravity recovery and feed 
grade.

In order to provide an estimation of plant recovery based on the variability samples 
and testing that was performed at SGS Lakefield, a statistical analysis of the testwork 
results was conducted. 

Statistical Analysis of Variability Test Work Recovery Using Monte Carlo 

Monte Carlo probability distributions (derived from variability test results) for the overall 
recovery achieved in the variability tests were prepared.  This analysis has only been 
performed for the XR1, XR2 and XR3 test results as the three tests conducted on the 
XR2-3 (XR4) ore samples does not provide sufficient data to provide any meaningful 
results from a statistical analysis.  Figure 13-3 to Figure 13-5 show the probability 
distributions for the XR1, XR2 and XR3 test results.  Figure 13-6 is the resulting 
estimated full-scale plant recovery distribution. 

At the request of Mr. J. Rajala of B2Gold, empirical models (based on mean 
correlations) were used for estimating plant recovery, mine cut-off grade and for the 
purpose of financial modelling. These recovery estimates were for full scale plant 
operations based on the mine production schedule and planned mill feed grade. The 
grade/recovery curves and empirical equations were used to estimate gold recovery as 
function of head grade particularly for gold grades near cut-off. 

The empirical correlations presented in Figure 13-7 to Figure 13-9 provide a 
logarithmic data fit to the laboratory recoveries as determined from the test work 
carried out on the variability composite samples using the optimized leach conditions. 
These model-predicted recoveries were then further discounted by 1.5% in order to 
obtain an estimate of the plant recovery based on the mill feed grade and mine 
production schedule. 

The discounted calculated recoveries from the empirical models presented in  
Figure 13-7 to Figure 13-9 are shown relative to the discounted expected recovery 
ranges for the 95% confidence intervals as detailed in Figure 13-6.  It should be noted 
that the recovery estimate for the XR2-3 (XR4) ore type was determined based on the 
averaged results for XR2 and XR3 as there was not enough available information from 
test work to provide a more accurate recovery estimate for this ore type.  

Figure 13-10 to Figure 13-13 show that based on mill feed grades as presented in the 
mine production schedule, the discounted calculated plant recovery estimates fall 
within the 90% recovery confidence interval as determined from the Monte Carlo 
analysis and presented in Figure 13-6.

13.3.2 Wolfshag 

Wolfshag laboratory gravity/leach gold recoveries from the SGS Lakefield test work 
were very similar to the Otjikoto feasibility study recoveries, so plant recoveries were 
also be predicted to be very similar for Wolfshag ores. 

13.3.3 Results 

Metallurgical recoveries over the production period to date were included in Table 6-2.  
The average life-of-mine (LOM) gold recovery forecast for the plant is 98%, based on 
operational data and optimization since plant start-up.   

13.4 Metallurgical Variability 

Samples selected for metallurgical testing were representative of the various types and 
styles of mineralization within the different zones.  Samples were selected from a 
range of locations within the deposit zones.  Sufficient samples were taken so that 
tests were performed on sufficient sample mass. 

13.5 Deleterious Elements 

No deleterious elements are known from the processing perspective.

13.6 Comments on Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

The Wolfshag and Otjikoto ores are expected to support average LOM gold 
metallurgical recoveries of 98%.  There are no deleterious elements known that would 
affect process activities or metallurgical recoveries.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Introduction 

Mineral Resource estimates are reported from two block models, the combined 
Otjikoto and Wolfshag open pit model and the Wolfshag underground model.  The 
Otjikoto and Wolfshag open pit models were built in 2015 and 2018, respectively, and 
combined into one model for Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve pit shell runs and 
reporting. 

Core and RC data are used to support the Mineral Resource estimates.  The cut-off 
dates for the databases used in estimation were: 

 Otjikoto open pit:  June 22, 2015.  Based on 1,426 core and RC holes (242,014 m).  
A portion of the holes have lithology information only; 

 Wolfshag open pit and underground:  July 7, 2018.  Based on 471 core and RC 
drill holes (122,844 m). 

Figure 14-1 shows the extents of the models used in estimating Mineral Resources.  In 
this figure, the Otjikoto model extent is shown in green, and the Wolfshag model in tan.  

14.2 Otjikoto Open Pit 

14.2.1 Geological Models 

Lithology and mineralization zone models were built using the commercially-available 
Leapfrog Geo software. 

Thrust Block Domains 

Site staff interpreted a full set of sections containing thrust block boundaries.  The 
sections were geo-referenced and digitized in Leapfrog. Intervals were selected, then 
modifications to the interpretations were made to reconcile between sections.  Thrust 
block boundaries were generally selected at contacts of major lithological changes.   

The Otjikoto thrust model consists of nine, approximately sub-parallel, blocks.

Mineralized Domains 

Mineralized zones were created using lithology, vein percent, sulphide abundance and 
gold grade at a nominal 0.3 g/t Au cut-off.  Grades slightly below 0.3 g/t Au were 
included along the margins of zones or along strike/dip for the sake of continuity.  The 
0.3 g/t Au threshold was chosen due to the proximity to a natural break that 
distinguishes mineralized from non-mineralized material at approximately 0.25–0.35 
g/t Au.  In addition, the value is below the resource reporting cut-off of 0.4 g/t.  The 
thrust block model was used to limit the mineralized zoned wireframes.  Individual 
mineralized zones do not cross thrusts (although sometimes there is mineralization on 
either side of a thrust). 

Mineralized zone wireframes were identified by the thrust block in which they occur.  
Illustrative figures showing the geology and mineralization were included in Section 7. 

Oxidation and Weathering Domains 

Surfaces were created for the base of calcrete, transition, oxide and mixed.  These 
surfaces were based on logged rock type and oxidation from exploration drill holes.   

The bottom of calcrete surface was used as a top to the thrust and mineralized zone 
wireframes.  Statistics indicated mineralization does not occur within calcrete and the 
base of calcrete should be used as a hard boundary for grade estimation.   

Metallurgical Domains 

Metallurgical domains are defined by oxidation state and dominant sulphide 
composition.  The domains modeled include oxide (Metdomain = 1), pyrite-dominant 
(Metdomain = 2), pyrrhotite-dominant (Metdomain = 3), pyrite–pyrrhotite mixed 
(Metdomain = 4) and Wolfshag pyrite-dominant (Metdomain = 5).  

The average pyrite-to-pyrrhotite ratio across Otjikoto shows a zonation of sulphide 
species with some internal variability.  A polygon "cookie-cutter" was used to tag the 
block model with these domains.   

14.2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis 

A comparison of gold grades relative to various logged geological parameters and 
intensities indicated that lithology and vein percent are the only useful logging 
parameters for modeling.  The majority of ore-grade material occurs in hornfels or 
(what is logged as) albitite with >2% veining.  Logged pyrite and pyrrhotite abundances 
also show weak correlations with gold grades.

14.2.3 Density Assignment 

Bulk densities applied to the block model vary by lithology, mineralization, and 
oxidation state, ranging from 2.43 in hardpan to 2.84 in sulphide-mineralized albitite.    

14.2.4 Grade Capping/Outlier Restrictions 

Capping levels were selected based on decile analysis, lognormal probability plots and 
spatial review of high grades.  Capping was applied to assays prior to down-hole 
compositing.  For low grade domains, capping ranged from 4–6 g/t Au and for high 
grade domains capping ranged from 5–40 g/t Au. 

14.2.5 Composites 

A new composite was started at grade zone and structural domain contacts.  
Composite length varies a little to avoid small residuals at the end of intervals.  The 
down-hole composite length for Otjikoto is 2 m. 

14.2.6 Variography 

Variograms (correlograms) were run for the indicator, low-grade, high-grade and all 
grades (for direct ordinary kriging (OK) estimates).  All variograms were modeled with 
spherical models.  The Otjikoto grade variograms for the most important domains in 
terms of ore production have a nugget effect around 0.4 with the first structure at about 
80% of the sill at 25–30 m and the second structure having down dip ranges of 45–
50 m, and down plunge (strike) ranges of 90 m. 

14.2.7 Estimation/Interpolation Methods 

The model is rotated 32° clockwise about the Z-axis, and a parent block size of 6 m x 
12 m x 3.3 m was used, with sub-celling to 3 m x 3 m x 0.11 m.  The estimate was 
completed using commercially-available Datamine software. 

An indicator was created that identified zones above a nominal 0.8–0.9 g/t Au cut-off.  
This threshold corresponded to a modest natural break in grade distribution.  High-
grade indicator values (1) were assigned to intervals of contiguous zones above or 
near the chosen threshold.  Spatially-isolated assays above 0.8 g/t Au were not 
designated as high grade.  Some consideration was given to adjacent drill holes while 
assigning the indicator, so marginal material may have been designated as "high-
grade" for continuity's sake even though the material did not strictly meet the 0.8 g/t Au 
cut-off.  Given the grade variability and relatively high nugget effect, this definition is 
considered reasonable.  The indicator was interpolated into the block model using 
ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 14-5 

 

 

High- and low-grade values (components of the indicator) were also estimated using 
OK.  The high and low grades were combined into a single block grade using a 20/80 
rule.  For interpolated indicator values less than 0.2, the block was assigned the low-
grade value, for indicator values between 0.2 and 0.8, the indicator was used to 
calculate the weighted average of high- and low-grade values.  For indicators greater 
than 0.8, the block was assigned the high-grade value. 

Hard boundaries were applied between mineralized zones of different 
structural/stratigraphic groups (STRTGRP) and between mineralization and waste. 

Search Parameters 

Search parameters were set up to ensure that blocks would be informed by, on 
average, 5–6 drill holes in the core of the deposit. Search ellipse parameters and 
search criteria are provided in Table 14-1.   

Average rotation of the search ellipse was 44o clockwise looking down the positive Z-
axis, 24o counter-clockwise looking down the positive Y-axis, and 34o counter-
clockwise looking down the positive Z-axis. For all interpolation runs, model variogram 
and search orientations were controlled by Datamine's dynamic anisotropy.  Using this 
method, orientations were assigned within specified limits to each block based on the 
local wireframe/interpretations. 

14.2.8 Block Model Validation 

The block models were validated using the following methods: 

 Visual comparison of composites to the block model on screen and paper plots 
(sections and long sections).  The indicator adequately creates zones for high-
grade/low-grade domaining and is representative of the volume of each material.  
Although some local over- and under-estimates were observed, they are minor in 
extent and common to this type of estimate.  Final grades are representative of the 
drill hole data; 

 Comparison of nearest-neighbor (NN) and block model statistics at zero cut-off are 
within 5% for indicated and 10% for inferred blocks, which is considered an 
acceptable difference; 

 Comparison of interpolation methods by easting, northing and elevation on "swath" 
plots show the final model reasonably tracks the declustered composites (NN) but 
is very slightly lower on all plots, suggesting a level of conservatism; 

 Change of support checks are within reasonable levels of the final estimated block 
grades at the resource cut-off grade.

14.3 Wolfshag Open Pit 

The Wolfshag open pit model was updated in 2018 following initial mining at Wolfshag 
open pit.  Interpretations and models for lithology, structural, mineralized zone and 
grade models were part of the update.  Geotechnical, metallurgical, and acid rock 
drainage (ARD) models were not updated and the 2015 model is the current model for 
those parameters.  Grade control data were not used directly for solid modeling or 
grade estimation but were used as an overall guide to the interpretations, and for 
validation of the open model.  

14.3.1 Geological Models 

Mineralized Domains 

Two nested shells were created based on a combination of grade and vein intensity: 

 Low-grade (LG) domain at a nominal 0.2 g/t Au threshold was chosen as the 
contact between mineralized material with anomalous gold values.  The threshold 
is somewhat flexible depending on the geological description (vein %), and grades 
in adjacent samples and adjacent drill holes; 

 High-grade (HG) domain is at a nominal 1 g/t Au threshold and was selected to 
separate contiguous high-grade (generally >5 g/t Au) from low grade material.  
High-grade material generally coincides with increased veining intensity which was 
used to decide the boundary in marginal cases.  Lithology was also used in 
marginal cases where dramatic grade changes occurred at changes in lithology 
(especially at marble contacts). 

The mineralized domain wireframes were created in Datamine by linking 25–50 m 
spaced vertical cross section interpretations that were reconciled in three-dimensions

(section, level and long section).  Illustrative figures showing the geology and 
mineralization were included in Section 7. 

For the open pit model, only the low-grade domain was used as a boundary in the gold 
grade estimate. Preliminary models using the high-grade boundary as a hard or semi-
soft boundary did not reconcile well with mine production data.  The high-grade 
domain was used for setting capping levels in the open pit model. 

Stratigraphic/Structural Model 

A stratigraphic/structural model was created based on all available geological data. 
The stratigraphic model wireframes were created in Datamine using the same 
methodology as used for the mineralized domains.  The units modeled include the 
East (OTB) Marble, PT marble (located within the OTA stratigraphic sequence) or FW 
marbles) and west (FW) marble in addition to the WH thrust (located at the base of the 
Wolfshag zone and the FW marble).  Figure 7-6 is a cross-section showing the 
stratigraphy, lithology and structure. 

Lithology Model 

Within each of the modeled stratigraphic units, lithology was assigned by interpolating 
indicators for each major rock type: fine-grained biotite–(albite) schist (Albbio), 
amphibole (BbandAmp), hornfels, marble, schist, hardpan and fault.  The dominant 
rock type was applied to the block/sub-block. 

Oxidation and Weathering 

Weathering and oxidation surfaces were created from simplified drill logs using 
Leapfrog.  The surfaces created include bases of soil, hardpan, transition, oxide and 
mixed. 

Metallurgical Domains  

The metallurgical domains were described in Section 14.2.1.  Unlike Otjikoto, which 
shows a zonation of sulphide species with some internal variability, Wolfshag is pyrite-
dominant.  

14.3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis 

Analysis of gold grades by logged geology completed earlier show similar results to 
the work done on Otjikoto only.  Higher-grade material occurs in what is logged as 
albitite with higher vein percentages.

14.3.3 Density Assignment 

Bulk density was estimated within stratigraphic/structural domains using inverse-
distance squared (ID2) interpolation.   

Blocks that are further from drilling were assigned the mean bulk density values from 
measurements based on domain, oxidation and mineralization state.  Where 
insufficient measurements were available, bulk densities were based on factored 
values from domains where data were available.  Bulk density assignments range from 
1.9 in soil to 2.98 in the Wolfshag A lower high-grade zone. 

14.3.4 Grade Capping/Outlier Restrictions 

Assays were capped prior to compositing.  Two capping levels for each domain/sub-
domain (AUC1/AUC2) were determined, based on probability plots, deciles and the 
location of outlier samples.  Both capping levels were estimated into the block model 
and combined to produce the final grade model.  The range of capping values for the 
two capping levels included:  

 High-grade mineralized zones: Low-cap values range from 12–50 g/t Au and high-
cap values range from 12–80 g/t Au; 

 Low-grade mineralized zones: low-cap values range from 1–20 g/t Au and high-
cap values range from 1–30 g/t Au; 

 Marbles/waste:  low-cap values range from 0.4–1 g/t Au and high-cap values range 
from 1–2 g/t Au.  

14.3.5 Composites 

Two-metre downhole composites were created with breaks at each mineralization 
domain contact; however, high-grade contacts were ignored.  Widths were varied if 
necessary, to avoid residuals at the end of intervals. 

To mitigate the problem of hinge composites (wide and many composites) 
overpowering limb composites (thin and few composites), any interval composed of 
only one composite was divided into two.  For example, if an entire intersection was 
2 m wide (so one composite), it would be divided into two 1 m composites effectively 
doubling the weight of that intersections. 

14.3.6 Variography 

Variograms (correlograms) were run on 2 m capped composites for each interpolation 
domain.  The data were not normalized prior to use.  Some individual domains were 
grouped where insufficient data existed for useful variography on an individual basis.

14.3.7 Estimation/Interpolation Methods 

The block model is rotated 32o clockwise about the Z-axis.  This is the same block 
model layout used for the main Otjikoto deposit.  Grades for the open pit model were 
estimated using OK into parent blocks of 6 m x 12 m x 3.3333 m by domain.  A NN 
model and an ID2 model were also created for comparison and validation.  Sub-cells 
were created at wireframe boundaries down to a dimension of 3 m in the X and Y 
directions and to 0.11111 m in the Z dimension. 

Hard boundaries were used at the low-grade/waste contact, so only composites within 
the low-grade domain were used to estimate grades of blocks in that domain.  In the 
final estimate, block grades were estimated using 3 x 4 x 2 discretization points. 

Search Parameters 

The default rotation of the search ellipse was 50o clockwise looking down the positive 
Z-axis, 20o counter-clockwise looking down the positive Y-axis, and 35o counter-
clockwise looking down the positive Z-axis.  This is the average orientation of the 
Wolfshag ore shoots.  For all interpolation runs, search orientations were controlled by 
Datamine's dynamic anisotropy. 

Search parameters are summarized in Table 14-2. 

Final Block Grades 

Three capping levels for each interpolation run were completed, termed the high-cap, 
low-cap and no-cap runs.  Final block grades were calculated by combining high-cap 
and low-cap estimates.  Any block within 27 x 49 x 7 m (0.7 of an ellipse with 
dimensions of 38 x 70 x 10 m) of a high-capped composite were assigned grades 
estimated using the higher-capped composites (AUC1).  All other blocks were 
assigned grades estimated using the lower-capped values (AUC2).   

This method was used to constrain the very high grades in the top hinge area (formerly 
WA) from overpowering narrower, lower-grade data in the limbs, while still assigning 
high grades where data supported such assignments. 

The ID2 model was used for small discontinuous zones, since no meaningful 
variography was available for these domains.

14.3.8 Block Model Validation 

Cross sections and levels for comparing the block model to composite grades were 
reviewed in detail.  Overall block grades are a good representation of composites with 
a reasonable level of smoothing.  Over-projections of low and high grades were local 
and were most apparent in very narrow zones. 

The difference between the mean grade of the NN and OK models at a zero cut-off are 
within 5% for all major domains.  Larger differences were seen in individual 
discontinuous, lower tonnage, zones but were still within 10%. 

Swath plots for the major domains show that the OK model tracks the NN model quite 
well, with no apparent biases.  Minor exceptions occur at the ends of domains where 
the estimated tonnage is quite small. 

14.4 Combined Otjikoto and Wolfshag Open Pit Model 

The Otjikoto and Wolfshag open pit subcell models were combined into one large 
subcelled model in Datamine.  The combined model was converted to a whole-block 
(single grade per block) regularized model to the parent block size of 6 x 12 x 3.33 m.  

The average gold grade and the density for each whole block were calculated based 
on the volume-weighted average of all sub-cells within the parent cell.  Categorical 
codes such as lithology, resource classification, and metallurgical domains were 
applied to the whole block model based on the dominant code inside the parent block.   

Due to a combination of the modeling methodology (~0.2 g/t Au shells, and no HG), 
block size and cut-off grades (operational cut-off of 0.25 g/t Au), most dilution is built 
into the resource model.  Diluting tonnes are offset by grade loss due to grade 
reduction (e.g. if the pre-diluted grade was above a grade threshold (cut-off), the 
diluted grade would be below that grade threshold). 

The re-blocked model was used for Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource pit shell 
runs.  The Mineral Resource is reported from the subcell model.

14.5 Wolfshag Underground 

The down-plunge extension of Wolfshag mineralization is considered an underground 
mining target.  Sections 14.3.1, 14.3.2, 14.3.3, 14.3.4, and 14.3.5 regarding the 
Wolfshag open pit model also apply to the Wolfshag underground model.   

14.5.1 Estimation/Interpolation Methods 

The Wolfshag underground block model used the same model layout as the open pit 
model (refer to Section 14.3.7).  Gold grades were estimated using inverse distance 
weighting to the third power (ID3) into the parent block size of 3 x 6 x 3.33 m.  This 
estimation technique was used to reduce over-smoothing the gold grade estimates.   

Hard boundaries were used at the high-grade/low-grade domain contact and the low-
grade/waste contact (only composites within a domain were used to estimate the 
domain).  

Search ellipse orientations for the underground model and how grade capping was 
handled were implemented the same way as the open pit model estimates (refer to 
Section 14.3.7).  Search parameters are provided in Table 14-3.   

14.5.2 Model Validation 

The visual review of block model grades relative to composite grades shows block 
model grades reasonably match the drill hole composite grades and the high- and low-
grade domains are honoured in the estimates. The ID3 and NN estimates at zero cut-
off, and swath plots of ID3, NN and raw data compare well with no apparent biases. 

14.6 Classification of Mineral Resources 

14.6.1 Otjikoto Open Pit  

Mineral Resources potentially amenable to open pit mining methods were classified as 
follows:  

 No Measured Mineral Resources were classified;   

 Indicated Mineral Resources required a drill spacing of at least 25 m x 50 m; 

 Inferred Mineral Resources required a drill spacing of at least 100 m x 100 m. 

Polygons were drawn around the areas that met the above drill spacing criteria.  Some 
less continuous zones were reclassified from Indicated to Inferred based on poor 
grade or geological continuity.  Any blocks not classified as Indicated or Inferred were 
reset to a grade of 0.03 g/t Au.

14.6.2 Wolfshag Open Pit  

Mineral Resources potentially amenable to open pit mining methods were classified as 
Indicated and Inferred using the following criteria: 

 Indicated:  Upper portions of the main Wolfshag folds that are drilled to 25 x 25 m 
drill spacing or 25 x 50 m with some infill drill holes;   

 Inferred:  Areas of 25 x 50 m in lower folds at Wolfshag or in areas of 25 x 50 m 
with gaps in the upper zones to a maximum of 50 x 100 m.  Isolated zones were 
categorized as Inferred despite meeting the spacing requirement. 

No Measured Mineral Resources were classified. 

14.6.3 Wolfshag Underground  

Mineral Resources amenable to underground mining are classified as follows: 

 No Measured Mineral Resources are reported; 

 Indicated Mineral Resources are drilled to approximately 25 x 25 m spacing; 

 Inferred Mineral Resources are drilled to approximately 50 x 100 m spacing. 

14.7 Reasonable Prospects of Eventual Economic Extraction 

14.7.1 Open Pit  

Mineral Resources considered potentially amenable to open pit mining methods were 
constrained within a conceptual pit shell that used the parameters in Table 14-4.  
Based on these costs and assumptions, the break-even cut-off grade is 0.35 g/t Au.  
Mineral Resources potentially amenable to open pit mining are stated above a cut-off 
of 0.4 g/t Au.

14.7.2 Underground 

Mineral Resources considered amenable to underground mining methods are reported 
outside the conceptual pit shell used for reporting Mineral Resources and above a cut-
off of 2.6 g/t Au.  This cut-off is based on conceptual underground engineering and 
cost studies performed internally by B2Gold.   

Blocks outside the main folded Wolfshag zone but above 2.6 g/t Au, were not reported 
since these are generally small and discontinuous and are therefore unlikely to be 
mined.

14.8 Mineral Resource Statement 

Indicated Mineral Resources are reported in Table 14-5 inclusive of those Indicated 
Mineral Resources converted to Probable Mineral Reserves.  Mineral Resources that 
are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

Inferred Mineral Resources are provided in Table 14-6. 

The QP for the resource estimate is Mr. Tom Garagan, Senior Vice President of 
Exploration and an employee of B2Gold.  The Qualified Person for the stockpiles 
estimate is Mr. Peter Montano, P.E., Project Director, who is also an employee of 
B2Gold. 

14.9 Factors That May Affect the Mineral Resource Estimate 

Factors that may affect the Mineral Resource estimates include: 

 Metal price and exchange rate assumptions; 

 Changes to the assumptions used to generate the gold grade cut-off grade; 

 Changes in local interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of 
mineralized zones; 

 Changes to geological and mineralization shape and geological and grade 
continuity assumptions 

 Density and domain assignments; 

 Geometallurgical and oxidation assumptions; 

 Changes to geotechnical, mining and metallurgical recovery assumptions; 

 Change to the input and design parameter assumptions that pertain to the 
conceptual pit and stope designs constraining the estimates;  

 Assumptions as to the continued ability to access the site, retain mineral and 
surface rights titles, maintain environment and other regulatory permits, and 
maintain the social license to operate. 

There are no other known environmental, legal, title, taxation, socioeconomic, 
marketing, political or other relevant factors that would materially affect the estimation 
of Mineral Resources that are not discussed in this Report.

15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

15.1 Introduction 

Mineral Reserves are estimated using open pit mining methods.   

B2Gold developed the parameters used in the Mineral Reserve estimation from 
operating experience at Otjikoto.  Cost estimates and other parameters are based on 
the life-of-mine (LOM) plan (LOMP) which uses 2018 contract labour rates that were 
ratified in the second quarter (Q2) of 2018.  Process recoveries used in the estimate 
are based on historical production.  Export levies and royalties are based on current 
Namibian laws and agreements.  The merged Otjikoto and Wolfshag block model from 
August 2018 was the basis for the tonnage and grade estimates. 

Indicated Mineral Resources within the final pit design limits were converted to 
Probable Mineral Reserves.  There are no Measured Mineral Resources in the block 
model. 

15.2 Mineral Reserves Statement 

Mineral Reserves are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.  The 
Qualified Person for the estimate is Mr. Peter Montano, P.E., Project Director, a 
B2Gold employee.  Mineral Reserves are reported effective 31 December, 2018 in 
Table 15-1, using a gold cut-off grade of 0.45 g/t Au. 

15.3 Factors that May Affect the Mineral Reserves 

Factors that may affect the Mineral Reserve estimates include: 

 Changes to the gold price assumptions; 

 Changes to pit slope and geotechnical assumptions; 

 Unforeseen dilution; 

 Changes to hydrogeological and pit dewatering assumptions; 

 Stockpiling assumptions as to the amount and grade of stockpile material required 
to maintain operations during the wet season; 

 Assumptions used when evaluating the potential economics Phases 3 and 4 of 
each of the pits; 

 Changes to inputs to capital and operating cost estimates; 

 Changes to modifying factor assumptions, including environmental, permitting and 
social licence to operate.

2. Mineral Reserves are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards. 

3. Mineral Reserves have an effective date of 31 December, 2018, and are reported on a 100% basis.  B2Gold holds 
a 90% attributable interest and EVI holds a 10% attributable interest. 

4. Mineral Reserves are based on a conventional open pit mining method, gold price of US$1,250/oz, metallurgical 
recovery of 98%, selling costs of $51.44/oz including royalties and levies, average mining cost of $2.29/t mined, 
average processing cost of $12.99/t processed, and site general costs of $3.25/t processed.  Reserve model 
dilution and ore loss was applied through whole block averaging such that at a 0.45 g/t cut-off there is a 2.3% 
decrease in tonnes, a 2.2% reduction in grade, and 4.4% reduction in ounces when compared to the Mineral 
Resource model.  Mineral Reserves are reported above a cut-off grade of 0.45 g/t Au. 

5. Tonnes and grade are reported as-delivered to the mill, including mining dilution and losses. Dilution and loss are 
accounted for in the block model at the selective mining unit (SMU) size of 6 m E x 12 m N x 3.33 m RL.   

6. All tonnage, grade and contained metal content estimates have been rounded; rounding may result in apparent 
summation differences between tonnes, grade, and contained metal content. 

 

15.4 Pit Optimization 

Whittle optimization analyses were conducted as part of the 2018 LOMP process.  The 
objective was to confirm that the ultimate pit design is valid and determine where 
upside potential and risks might exist in the design. 

Phases have been included in the mine design and production schedule to bring 
ounces forward where possible, which benefits the cash flow, and to smooth 
production. 

Parameters used in the validation optimization are shown in Table 15-2.  These reflect 
the gold price for Mineral Reserves, changes in the application of the export levy and 
Namibian royalty and the LOMP operating and sustaining capital costs.  Sustaining 
capital costs were defined as the capital costs required to stay in business, including 
rebuilding and replacing equipment as necessary, and were included in the validation 
optimization.

An export levy of 1%, and a 3% royalty payment to the Namibian Government were 
applied to net and gross revenue, respectively.  The application of these to the Mineral 
Reserve gold price of US$1,250/oz, results in a net gold price of US$1,199/oz.  

Overall slope angles (OSA) were applied in Whittle based on the geotechnical 
recommendations made by MineTechnics (refer to discussion in Section 16.1).  OSA 
were applied to each of the nine geotechnical zones define around the pit, and account 
for the inclusion of roads and ramps. 

Results from the analysis confirmed that the LOM ultimate pit design is valid.  These 
analyses also showed that Wolfshag phase 4 has a high incremental strip ratio and as 
a result is sensitive to changes in mining costs.   

The US$1,250/oz Au price shell was selected as the basis for validation of the ultimate 
pit.  This shell was selected because it maximizes the mine life and ounce production 
while producing a positive cash flow, based on current assumptions.  Sensitivity 
analysis on the selected pit indicated that changes in gold price had the greatest 
impact because the metal price is a factor in the cut-off grade, which controls the 
conversion of low-grade material between ore and waste within shells, and in defining 
the pit depth, as the revenue has to cover the mining costs. 

Additional information on the pit designs is included in Section 16.

15.5 Basis of Mineral Reserve Estimate 

Mineral Reserve estimation was based on the LOMP pit and WRSF designs and mine 
and mill production schedules.  Figure 15-1 shows the overall mine layout. 

Mine and mill production scheduling was based on a stockpiling strategy whereby the 
highest grades were sent to the process plant as they were mined, and the remaining 
lower-grade material was sent to an appropriate grade-based stockpile. 

The Mineral Reserve estimate assumes a 0.45 g/t Au cut-off grade, which is slightly 
higher than the calculated mill cut-off of 0.43 g/t Au.  B2Gold defines the mill cut-off as 
the gold grade required to cover non-mining costs after process recoveries, selling 
costs, royalties and export levies are applied.  Non-mining costs were defined as 
stockpile re-handle, processing and G&A operating and plant and facilities sustaining 
capital costs.  Table 15-3 contains the parameters used to define the gold cut-off grade 
on a $/t processed basis. 

Average mining costs are US$2.01/t mined and mine sustaining capital costs average 
$0.28/t mined; however, these are not included in the cut-off grade calculation 
because they are a sunk cost. 

Dilution and loss are accounted for in the block model at the selective mining unit 
(SMU) size of 6 m E x 12 m N x 3.33 m RL so additional mining dilution and loss 
factors were not applied in the Mineral Reserve estimation.  The dilution approach 
used in the block model is discussed in Section 14.4. 

The derivation of the cut-off grade is discussed in Section 16.4.1. 

15.6 Comments on Section 15 

Mineral Reserves are reported in accordance with the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.

16.0 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Overview 

The mining operations use conventional open pit mining methods and equipment.  
Mining is based on a phased approach with stockpiling to bring high-grade forward and 
provide operational flexibility.  Phase 1 of each of the Otjikoto and Wolfshag pits has 
been completed leaving three phases to be mined in each pit.   

Mine production will be 38.5 Mt/a for better utilization of the mining equipment over the 
life and this results in an anticipated eight-year mine life.   

16.2 Geotechnical Considerations 

Pit slope domains and other parameters used in the design are detailed in Table 16-1.  
The locations of the zones outlined in Table 16-1 are shown schematically in  
Figure 16-1.   

Beginning at the 1465 RL, 15 m wide geotechnical berms are included in the design on 
60 m intervals.  These criteria were the basis for the OSA applied in the optimization 
analysis.   

16.3 Hydrogeological Considerations 

The general climate is arid; however, there are intense short duration rainfall events 
during the rainy season.  To deal with the runoff from these events, a diversion 
channel was incorporated into the mine design to divert surface water away from the 
active mining area to a settling pond adjacent to the northern limit of the Wolfshag pit.  

Water is pumped from the settling pond to be used for dust suppression on haul roads. 

Groundwater is actively extracted ahead of mining from a single dewatering borehole 
situated between the Otjikoto and Wolfshag pits.  Excess water that accumulates in 
the pit due to groundwater seepage and rainwater accumulation is collected in sumps 
located in low spots in each pit and pumped to the return water dam. 

16.4 Open Pit Design 

Pit optimization assumptions were provided in Section 15.1. 

A phased development strategy was applied in the LOM to smooth the mine 
production schedule by deferring waste stripping, and to bring high-grade material 
forward.  Tabulations were developed for each of the phases based on the Mineral 
Reserve gold cut-off grade of 0.45 g/t.  The mineralization was then subdivided based 
on the stockpiling strategy of delaying the processing of most of the low-grade material 
until the end of the mine life.

Development is based on the Otjikoto and Wolfshag deposits each being mined in four 
phases for a total of eight phases.  Phase 1 has already been completed for both 
deposits.  Wolfshag Phase 4 represents the final expansion to the ultimate pit shown in 
Figure 16-2.  Otjikoto and Wolfshag phase designs are shown in Figure 16-3 and 
Figure 16-4, respectively. 

Phase development will also mitigate the geological, geotechnical and economic risks 
for the Project, considering the ultimate pit is 2.8 km in length and has separate pit 
bottoms for the Otjikoto and Wolfshag deposits.  Additionally, it allows for phase 
designs to be modified as mining progresses based on operational experience, 
exposed ground conditions, and changes in economic conditions.  This is particularly 
beneficial for Phases 3 and 4 at both deposits, since these phases have higher 
production costs per ounce due to higher strip ratios and the greater depth to reach 
high-grade ore. 

Where possible, ramps were located in the east wall of both pits to mitigate potential 
geotechnical hazards associated with planar and wedge-forming structures present in 
footwall structures along the west wall.  A nominal ramp and road width of 27 m, 
including drainage and safety berms, was used for dual lane truck operation.  Ramp 
widths were reduced to 20 m in the lower levels of the phase designs to allow for 
single lane haulage on the final benches.  Ramp grades were designed to a maximum 
of 10%. 

Temporary ramps will be used, as needed, for initial access to stages.  Most of these 
will be mined out as successive phases are mined at different levels.  Where these 
ramps are left, they will act as geotechnical berms to limit the inter-ramp slope angle. 

16.5 Operational Cut-off Grades 

A mill gold cut-off grade of 0.45 g/t was calculated based on the parameters in  
Table 16-2.  This is defined as the gold grade required to cover non-mining costs after 
process recoveries, selling costs, royalties and export levies are applied.  Non-mining 
costs were defined as stockpile re-handle, processing and G&A operating and plant 
and facilities sustaining capital costs.  Mining costs were considered a sunk cost and 
were not included. 

For mill production scheduling a stockpiling strategy was developed based on bringing 
high-grade ounces forward thus delaying the processing of low-grade.  This strategy 
was based on processing the highest grades as they were mined and stockpiling the 
remaining ore in the appropriate grade-based stockpile.

 Mineralization >1.0 g/t Au was classified as high grade (HG), and fed directly into 
the crusher or placed on the run-of-mine (ROM) pad; 

 Mineralization between 0.8–1.0 g/t Au was classified as medium–high grade 
(MHG) for processing as necessary, with surplus quantities used to maintain ROM 
inventories for blending; 

 Mineralization between 0.6–0.8 g/t Au was classified as medium grade (MG) for 
processing as necessary, with surplus quantities stockpiled for future use; 

 Mineralization between 0.25–0.6 g/t Au was classified as low-grade (LG) for 
stockpiling and processing at the end of the mine life or to meet processing feed 
tonnage requirements when higher-grade mineralization is unavailable.   

16.6 Production Schedule 

Mine and mill production scheduling was done on an annual basis for the LOM.  A 
summary of the LOM mine and mill production schedules are presented in  
Figure 16-5 and Figure 16-6, respectively.

Mining operations are scheduled for 365 days per year with a 15% decrease in the 
production rate during the rainy season, December through March.  With the de-rate in 
production, this equivalent to operating 348 days per year.  Other than planned 
maintenances periods the plant is scheduled to operate 24 hours a day.  Mill feed will 
be provided from the ROM stockpiles or grade bin stockpiles when the mine is not 
producing ore. 

Mine and mill production are scheduled for eight years with the mining rate dropping 
the last two years with material from the low-grade stockpiles supplementing the 
process feed.  Production is based on mining the Otjikoto and Wolfshag deposits 
through a sequence of three remaining phases each.  Vertical advance is limited to 
two operating benches per pit phase.  This will involve the movement of an average of 
38.5 Mt/a of material to sustain processing of 3.5 Mt/a.  Gold grade range stockpiles 
have been incorporated into the production schedule to bring ounces forward by 
delaying the processing of low-grade material (<0.6 g/t Au), until later in the mine life. 

Otjikoto and Wolfshag will be mined simultaneously to expose sufficient ore to sustain 
the plant feed, at the highest grade possible, throughout the mine life.  Anywhere from 
one to three phases will be mined simultaneously within each deposit.  Generally, ore 
will be sourced at depth from the most advanced phases where grades are usually the 
highest. 

In the current LOM plan approximately 5.5 Mt of Indicated Mineral Resources from the 
low-grade stockpile are processed when Mineral Reserves are not available.  Mineral 
Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic 
viability.  The average grade of the low-grade stockpile is 0.43 g/t Au, similar to the 
breakeven processing cut-off grade but lower than the Mineral Reserve cut-off grade 
(0.45 g/t Au).  Processing of this stockpile will be determined when processing 
capacity is available.   

16.7 Operations 

Ore is hauled by truck from the pit to a stockpile, the ROM pad or direct-tipped into the 
crusher.  The highest-grade material is direct-tipped or placed on the ROM pad 
depending on the plant feed requirements.  Over the Project life it is assumed that 
75% of the ore will be stockpiled and re-handled.  Up to one week's supply of ore can 
be placed on the ROM pad. 

Material from the ROM pad is directly loaded into the crusher by a CAT 990 wheeled 
loader.  Stockpiled ore is reclaimed using the same loader and direct-tipping where 
possible.  However, for longer distances, CAT 777 trucks are used to transport the ore 
and dump it into the crusher. 

Mining operations are scheduled 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Three daily 
shifts of eight hours each are completed by mine operations personnel.

16.8 Blasting and Explosives 

Production drilling and blasting is done on 10 m benches with patterns and powder 
factors varying by material type and geological conditions.  Production blast holes are 
generally 165 mm in diameter.  Pre-split and trim blast holes along the final pit walls 
are generally 127 mm in diameter.  Pre-split holes are generally spaced 1.5 m apart. 

Bulk emulsion is loaded into both production and buffer holes, with a minimum 
stemming length of 3.3 m.  However, stemming length varies according to rock type 
and other geologic conditions.  Cartridge explosives are used for pre-split holes.   

16.9 Grade Control 

Production experience has shown that selective mining can be maintained on the 
benches to allow for the proper classification of material by grade range.  The RC 
grade control drilling is conducted in campaigns targeted to stay two benches ahead of 
mining.  Blast hole samples are then used in conjunction with the grade-control model 
to delineate the ore and waste zones for mine production. 

Drill hole patterns and length as well as sampling interval vary by material type: 

 Ore and select waste:  typically, a 6 m x 12 m pattern; 

 Waste:  typically, a 100 m x 100 m pattern. 

16.10 Mining Equipment 

Table 16-3 lists the current and peak mining equipment requirements for the remaining 
mine life.   

This fleet provides the flexibility to allow for the simultaneous mining of multiple phases 
and deposits. 

Haul truck numbers will increase from the current 23 to 26 as the haul distances 
increase due to the deepening of the pits and distances from the pits to the WRSF.   

Two Caterpillar 6018 shovels are generally operating on 10 m benches to remove 
waste.  Ore is selectively mined with Liebherr 984 excavators using three flitches of 
3.33 m each.  These excavators are also used to mine difficult areas.  The two R9250 
excavators alternate between ore and waste, as needed.  Caterpillar 992 and 990 
wheel loaders offer flexibility and are used to supplement the mine production and for 
stockpile reclaim.

16.11 Comments on Section 16 

The mining operations use conventional open pit mining methods and equipment.  
Four pit phases are planned for each of the Otjikoto and Wolfshag pits.  Phase 1 of 
each pit is complete.   

There is upside potential for the estimates if mineralization that is currently classified 
as Mineral Resources potentially amenable to underground mining methods can be 
converted to Mineral Reserves following appropriate technical studies.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Process Flowsheet 

The metallurgical testing presented in Section 13 and information in the 2012 feasibility 
study provided the data to finalize the process design criteria and the Otjikoto mill 
flowsheet.  The final overall flowsheet is provided in Figure 17-1. 

17.2 Plant Design 

The original design of the Otjikoto mill was based on a gravity/whole ore leach flow 
sheet with a nominal treatment rate of 2.5 Mt/a and a plant availability of 94%.  A 25% 
design factor was included for sizing the primary crusher, conveyors, ball mill, 
thickeners, cyanide destruction circuit, reagent systems and mainstream pumps which 
would facilitate a future expansion.  A pebble crusher was installed in the SAG mill 
circuit and two leach tanks were added to the leach circuit in the second half of 2015 to 
expand the mill capacity from 2.5 to 3.1 Mt/a.  

Gold is recovered by gravity concentration/intensive leaching and by a cyanide 
leach/CIP process for treatment of gravity tailings.  The Otjikoto mill design is robust 
and able to process the three major ore types (XR1 – oxide, XR2 – pyrite-dominant, 
XR3 – pyrrhotite-dominant) and now Wolfshag over the range of ore grades mined, 
and with variable materials handling and metallurgical characteristics.  

The process flow sheet consists of the following:   

 Crushing; 

 Grinding; 

 Gravity concentration and intensive cyanidation; 

 Cyanide leaching of gravity tailings; 

 Carbon-in-pulp (CIP); 

 Cyanide destruction; 

 Tailings disposal; 

 Acid wash and elution; 

 Electrowinning and gold room; 

 Carbon regeneration; 

 Reagents make-up and distribution; 

 Air services and plant water service.

The major process design criteria are presented in Table 17-1.   

The mill flow sheet consists of the following unit operations. 

17.2.1 Ore Receiving and Crushing  

The crushing circuit has a 42 in x 65 in (1,067 mm x 1,651 mm) gyratory crusher, with 
a nominal throughput rate of 440 t/h.  Run-of-mine ore from the open pit operations is 
delivered by 100 t trucks to the crusher.  The crushed product at a P80 of 150 mm, is 
conveyed to a 7,000 t (live capacity) mill feed stockpile. 

17.2.2 Grinding Circuit 

The grinding circuit consists of a 24 ft diameter (∅) x 14.5 ft effective grinding length 
(EGL) (7.11 m ∅ x 4.42 m EGL) SAG mill operated in closed circuit with a trommel for 
pebble screening on the mill discharge and a vibrating screen to produce ball mill 
circuit feed.  The SAG mill product is combined with tailings from the gravity 
concentration circuit before being pumped to a classification cyclone cluster.  Cyclone 
underflow is fed to a 16.5 ft diameter x 28 ft EGL (5.03 m ∅ x 8.53 m EGL) ball mill and 
the entire ball mill discharge is fed to a gravity concentration circuit for recovery of 
coarse free gold.   

Both grinding mills are powered with 4,000 kW (5,364 HP) synchronous motors.  The 
circuit is designed to produce an 80% passing product size (P80) of 75 µm.   

A pebble crusher was added to the SAG mill circuit for the plant expansion to 3 Mt/a. 

17.2.3 Gravity Concentration and Intensive Leaching 

The gravity concentration circuit consists of four Knelson 48-inch (1,219 mm) 
concentrator units, which are operated in parallel.  The gravity concentrate collected 
from the Knelson units is stored and then processed by intensive cyanide leaching in a 
ConSep CS8000 Acacia Reactor on a batch basis.  The design allows for processing 
of batches on either a 24 hour or a 48-hour basis.

17.2.4 Cyanide Leach Circuit 

Cyclone overflow from the grinding circuit is thickened in a pre-leach thickener (20 m 
diameter x 3 m sidewall) to achieve a solids content of 45% in the underflow product 
prior to cyanidation. The leach circuit comprises one pre-aeration tank (15.8 m 
diameter x 18.0 m high) and seven original leach tanks (each 15.8 m diameter x 18.0 
m high) plus two tanks added in the plant expansion (also 15.8 m diameter x 18.0 m 
high) to maintain the design leach residence time of 48 hours. 

17.2.5 Carbon-in-Pulp Circuit 

The CIP circuit consists of six CIP tanks (9.3 m diameter x 9.8 m high) in series with a 
design residence time of one hour per tank at 3.1 Mt/a throughput.  The circuit is 
designed for carbon concentrations in the range 15–25 g/L with loaded carbon batch 
transfers of 5 t every 24-hour cycle.

17.2.6 Cyanide Destruction  

The Otjikoto cyanide destruction circuit is based on the SO2/Air process and consists 
of a single tank (10.8 m diameter x 11.2 m high) with a design residence time of one 
hour.  The circuit is designed to reduce weak acid dissociable cyanide (CNwad) 
concentrations to less than 10 ppm. 

17.2.7 Tailings Thickening and Disposal 

Product slurry from the cyanide destruction circuit is thickened in a tailings thickener 
(20 m diameter x 5 m sidewall) to achieve an underflow density of 55–65% solids.  
Thickened tailings are pumped to a tailings impoundment and water reclamation 
facility situated approximately 3 km from the mill. 

17.2.8 Acid Wash, Elution and Carbon Regeneration 

Loaded carbon is processed in 5 t batches on a 24-hour cycle for recovery of gold.  
The loaded carbon is treated in an acid wash followed by elution and regeneration of 
barren carbon in a rotary kiln.  The design of the elution circuit is based on the 
pressure-split Anglo-American Research Laboratories process (pressure-split AARL) 
with a 5 t strip column capacity.  Gold is recovered in the eluate stream during the 
elution process. 

17.2.9 Electrowinning and Gold Room 

The electrowinning circuit treats eluate from the carbon elution circuit and pregnant 
solution from the Acacia Reactor on a batch basis for the recovery of gold from 
solution, using atmospheric sludging electrowinning cells.  Electrowinning sludge is 
fluxed and smelted in an induction furnace to produce gold bars for shipment to a 
refinery.

18.2 Road and Logistics 

The Otjikoto Mine area can be reached from the capital city, Windhoek, some 300 km 
to the south along the B1 national road, which is a surfaced road in excellent condition.  
Windhoek is connected by direct commercial air travel from several European 
countries, South Africa and other African countries.  

The large regional town of Tsumeb, a mining centre in its own right, is located some 
110 km north of the project area, also along the B1 road.  A domestic airport is located 
at Tsumeb, currently with both scheduled and charter flights connecting with 
Windhoek.  

The smaller town of Otavi lies some 50 km north from the Otjikoto Mine area near the 
cross roads of the main north–south National Road B1, the road to Grootfontein and 
the road to Outjo.  Otjiwarongo is the nearest town to the site and is approximately 
70 km away. 

Mine access is from the B1 national highway directly to the administration area via a 
dedicated, private mine access road.   

All roads near and connecting the administration, processing and mine facilities are 
appropriately sized for two-way traffic and constructed using locally-available gravel.  
Remote roads such as pipeline and borehole access are single lane with pull-outs. 

Large equipment, construction materials, diesel fuel, HFO, process reagents and other 
bulk supplies are trucked to the mine site from the port at Walvis Bay.   

18.3 Stockpiles 

Stockpiles include low grade, medium grade, and active ROM stockpiles.  The low-
grade stockpiles are located southeast of the ROM pad and to the west of the WRSFs 
(refer to Figure 15-1).  The stockpiles have sufficient LOMP storage capacity; however, 
they could be expanded vertically and horizontally as needed.   

A medium grade stockpile is located to the north of the ROM pad.  Active stockpiles 
(medium and high grade) are located on the ROM pad.  

18.4 Waste Storage Facilities 

Waste rock storage facilities are located to the west of the ultimate pit (refer to  
Figure 15-1).  An OSA of 18° was used in the design of the WRSFs with 15 m wide 
berms developed at 10 m vertical intervals.  The remaining WRSF capacity is about 
250 Mt, and there is sufficient footprint area available to add capacity if needed.

18.5 Tailings Storage Facilities 

The TSF was constructed using upstream construction techniques, based on a design 
by Epoch Resources Pty Ltd (Epoch).  A penstock system was constructed in the 
centre of the paddock to direct return water to the return water pond as quickly as 
possible.  The return water dam was constructed within the larger storm water dam, 
which was designed with a runoff system to contain a 50-year storm event. 

The TSF was designed to contain 36 Mt at a deposition rate of 3.0 Mt/a.  Review of the 
as-built and operating parameters of the TSF by Epoch has increased the ultimate 
capacity to 50 Mt at a deposition rate of 3.5 Mt/a, pending continued annual site visits 
and analysis. 

The TSF and ponds are fully lined with HDPE liner.  Monitoring wells and liner under 
drains are installed and regularly sampled. 

A layout plan for the TSF is included as Figure 18-2.  Additional facility information is 
provided in Section 20.2. 

18.6 Water Management 

The Otjikoto Mine is in an arid location with rainfall occurring only during the rainy 
season, most significantly December through March.  Hydraulic designs and water 
management plans focus on isolating the storm water from the process water and 
minimizing water use.  There are no permanent or seasonal waterways on the site, but 
sheet flows and small channel flows can occur during high intensity/short duration 
storms. 

Storm water and any other non-contact water that flows outside of the disturbed areas 
is diverted around the facilities with a system of storm water ponds, diversion, and 
culverts.  This system directs the flow to the existing channels and culverts associated 
with the B1 highway. 

All water falling directly on the industrial areas (contacted water) or otherwise 
contacted (fissure water from the mine pit, return and storm water from the tailings 
facility) is stored and used in the mining and processing facilities. 

The largest stormwater dam is designed with a capacity of 14,000 m3 to contain all 
water falling on the processing facility terrace during a 1:50 year rainfall event.  The 
smaller storm water dam provides capacity of 4,000 m3 and is sited to contain all runoff 
from the mining facilities.  Both storm water dams include spillways and silt traps.

The reclaim process water dam receives water from the tailings storage facility and is 
capable of storing 4,000 m3 in an HDPE-lined pond.  Water pumps supply water from 
the dam to the processing plant.  The second water storage dam is the pit dewatering 
dam.  Pit water is pumped from the in-pit sump and dewatering bore holes to the pond 
near the southeast pit crest.  The dam provides water for dust suppression and mineral 
processing. 

18.7 Camps and Accommodation 

B2Gold employees live in the surrounding communities.  A small onsite contractor 
camp can be used if required. 

18.8 Power and Electrical 

Generators supply power to the plant at 6.6 kV to permit a bypass facility around the 
SAG mill variable speed drive and to dispense with the otherwise needed 11/6.6 kV 
transformers to supply the mills.  The power plant was constructed with 24 MW of 
installed generating capacity.  A 7 MW solar plant was commissioned in 2018.   

The generators are fuelled with HFO, transported to the mine site from Walvis Bay.   

18.9 Fuel 

A storage facility with minimum 10 days fuel supply supports the generators.   

18.10 Water Supply 

Potable water is supplied from bore holes. 

Process water is sourced from the reclaim process water dam and supplemented with 
water from the pit dewatering dam as required. Water for dust suppression and other 
mining-related requirements is also sourced from the pit dewatering dam. 

18.11 Comments on Section 18 

Infrastructure required to support the LOMP is in place.

19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

19.1 Market Studies 

No market studies are currently relevant as Otjikoto is an operating mine producing a 
readily-saleable commodity in the form of doré.  Doré produced by B2Gold typically 
contains approximately 92% Au and 3% Ag.  The doré is exported to the Rand 
Refinery in South Africa. 

19.2 Commodity Price Projections 

Commodity prices used in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates are set by 
B2Gold corporately.  The current gold price provided for Mineral Reserve estimation is 
$1,250/oz, and $1,400/oz for Mineral Resource estimation. 

19.3 Contracts 

Major contracts include fuel supply, blasting explosives and accessories, and grade 
control drilling.  Contracts are negotiated and renewed as needed.  Contract terms are 
typical of similar contracts in Namibia that B2Gold is familiar with. 

19.4 Comments on Section 19 

The doré produced by the mine is readily marketable.  Metal prices are set corporately 
for Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation, and the gold price used for 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in this Report was $1,400/oz and $1,250/oz 
respectively. 

The QP has reviewed commodity pricing assumptions, marketing assumptions and the 
current major contract areas, and considers the information acceptable for use in 
estimating Mineral Reserves and in the economic analysis that supports the Mineral 
Reserves.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

20.1 Environmental Studies and Considerations 

An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), complete with an Environmental 
Management Plan (EMP) and Mine Closure Framework (MCF), was originally 
completed for the Otjikoto Gold Mine in June 2012 (2012 EIA; SLR 2012).  The 2012 
EIA updated an earlier impact assessment (completed in September 2011) to include 
design criteria for the mine, milling circuit, tailings management design and 
infrastructure.  The 2012 EIA details: 

 The EIA process followed (including legal requirements); 

 The baseline studies completed, including: 

 Air quality; 
 Visual landscape; 
 Groundwater and surface water; 
 Biodiversity; 
 Noise; 
 Archaeology/cultural heritage; 

 The process design considerations critical to community health and safety, 
environment, and social issues; 

 The impact of the Project on the environment, proposes monitoring programs for 
all phases of project development;  

 Mitigation strategies to reduce potential project impacts on the receiving 
environment. 

The 2012 EIA included extensive public consultation and was approved (received 
Environmental Clearance Certificate (2012 ECC)) by the Ministry of Environment and 
Tourism (MET), Department of Environmental Affairs in August 2012.  The 2012 ECC 
was incorporated into the Mining Lease Amplification Application approved by the 
Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) in December 2012. 

A second EIA was completed in 2013 (2013 EIA) for the inclusion of the on-site heavy 
fuel oil (HFO) power plant and landfill facility to cater for non-hazardous waste disposal 
(SLR 2013).  The Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) for the 2013 ESIA was 
issued by MET in October 2013 (2013 ECC).  

An EIA Scoping Report (including an assessment of impacts) was completed in 2014 
that included the Wolfshag pit, ancillary infrastructure and an expanded plant capacity 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 20-3 

 

 

(2014 EIA Scoping Report). At this time the EMP was updated to reflect updates to the 
Project and subsequent environmental mitigation and management measures.  A 
corresponding ECC was issued by the MET in January 2015 (this 2015 ECC 
superseded previous ECCs).  ECCs are valid for a three-year period and so the 2015 
ECC was subsequently renewed in 2018 (ECC granted in August 2018).  

The EMP is currently being updated (2018 EMP) for submittal and approval by the 
MET.  This 2018 EMP will reflect the current status (i.e., include changes to the Project 
and updates to its environmental mitigation and management measures) of the Project 
and will be submitted to the MET upon completion.  Table 20-1 presents a summary of 
some of the key environmental considerations of the Otjikoto Mine operation. 

The EMP and its supporting individual Management Plan's (MP) are "living 
documents" which will continue to be amended periodically throughout the life of the 
Project to reflect changes in procedures, practices, Project phase, etc. 

In addition to these key environmental studies, the Otjikoto Mine employs an 
Environmental Department which is located at the mine site and is responsible for 
compliance monitoring, administering environmental permits, interfacing with 
regulators, and maintaining an environmental management system that is in alignment 
with ISO 14001 requirements.  In carrying out these tasks, many environmental 
aspects have been studied in addition to those outlined above.  There are no 
environmental considerations that are known and not discussed in this Report that 
could materially impact B2Gold's ability to extract the Mineral Resources or Mineral 
Reserves. 

20.2 Tailings and Waste Disposal 

20.2.1 Tailings Disposal 

The tailings storage facility (TSF) is situated on relatively level ground (elevation 
1,493.5 mamsl) to the south of the processing mill.  The TSF is constructed as a ring 
embankment structure with a compacted, earthen fill starter embankment and cyclone 
sand embankment raises above the starter embankment.  The TSF collects all mill 
tailings discharge (supernatant and slurry), the only other inflow to the TSF is direct 
precipitation on the tailings surface.  Surface water is decanted through a penstock 
decant structure to a return water dam for recycle to the process mill.  The TSF and 
return water dam are constructed with an HDPE liner and seepage collection system 
to eliminate seepage from the facility to the receiving environment.

Table 20-1: Environmental Considerations 

Area Comment 

Air quality 

Otjikoto Mine operations generate dust from activities such as drilling, blasting, hauling, loading, stockpiling, crushing, screening, conveying 
and driving.  B2Gold committed to prevent and mitigate adverse potential impacts to air quality from its operational activities.  The objective is 
to prevent unacceptable air quality related pollution impacts.  Operational controls to reduce potential air quality pollution impacts are in 
place, and a program is implemented to monitor ambient dust, particulate, matter (PM10), and fugitive emissions of nitrogen dioxides and 
sulphur dioxides from the operation of fuel combustion mobile machinery and equipment.  Performance is measured and evaluated against 
the best practice standards, the South African National Air Quality standards (SANAS). 

Surface 
water/storm 
water 

There are no rivers, or major drainage channels within the mining license area.  The topography is mainly flat with washes which carry 
surface/storm water run-off in a southwesterly direction during heavy rain events.  

B2Gold committed to minimize mixing of clean and contact water systems, and to prevent pollution of surface water run-off due to industrial 
effluent, domestic effluent and spillages.  Surface run-off mainly occurs during the rainfall season only.  Surface run-off and stormwater 
around the mining area, pits and haul roads has been diverted away from the mine pits and facilities via a stormwater channel, and around 
haul roads by a drainage system leading towards the northwest. Surface run-off through the processing plant is diverted into a stormwater 
pond.  A TSF diversion/stormwater channel is in place. 

B2Gold has a wastewater disposal exemption permit (no. 666) which obligates the operations from discharging wastewater and effluents into 
the environment. A surface/storm water and wastewater/effluent sampling program is in place to monitor, manage and mitigate any potential 
impacts. Surface/storm water is sampled for potential contamination that could extend beyond the mining area. 

Groundwater 

The Otjikoto water management standard and groundwater monitoring programs guide the management of groundwater extraction, use and 
potential risks and impacts. An annual groundwater report on the status of the groundwater is submitted to the Department of Water Affairs 
(DWA) as a requirement of the abstraction permit.  The water used is recycled for reuse in the process plant.  About 40% is recycled each 
year.  

Groundwater levels are measured to understand and manage the potential loss of groundwater.  The groundwater levels around the Otjikoto 
Mine have not changed significantly since pre-mining conditions.  Seasonal fluctuation is observed in several boreholes during the dry winter 
months.  Groundwater levels within the mine area have remained constant with the exception of the boreholes closest to the Otjikoto and 
Wolfshag open pits which have declined by up to 30 m due to the pit dewatering activities that are required for safe operations. 

The quality of groundwater is monitored to ensure that any changes to the quality can be resolved as quickly as possible.  The water quality 
monitoring results to date confirm that the groundwater quality both within the mine area and regionally is of excellent quality (Group A) and 
is characterized by neutral pH (around 7) and low total dissolved salts (EC <150 mS/m).  There is no indication of groundwater contamination 
since operations started. 

Biodiversity 

Managing biodiversity involves a process of land clearing/disturbance application before any area is disturbed.  Field assessments are 
conducted on the area to be affected prior to clearing, these include recording and mapping of significant fauna and flora observed in a 
particular area.  The Department of Forestry is consulted, as appropriate, and permits are acquired for the destruction of protected trees 
whenever necessary. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 20-5 

 

 

Area Comment 

The operations are adjacent to a game farm where wildlife could escape into the ML area.  Potential risks to fauna are mitigated through 
barriers to prevent access into mine facilities by wildlife.  The mine site boundary is fenced, berms are in place, and high-risk facilities have a 
secondary fence or barrier. 

Topsoil 
Topsoil has been stockpiled since the project construction phase.  A total of about 2 Mm3 of topsoil has been stockpiled for rehabilitation.  
Several topsoil stockpiles store topsoil.  A portion has been used for progressive rehabilitation since 2015, and it is planned that much of the 
remaining material will be used as a growth media in the rehabilitation of the WRSF. 

Waste 

Waste is managed through the process of routine monitoring and inspection of waste areas, maintenance of resources, continuous 
awareness training of employees and contractors on waste practices, safe storage and transportation of waste and maintenance of waste-
related records.  Waste management is guided by the process of recovering as much reusable and recyclable waste materials as possible, 
treating and disposing the rest of the waste material which cannot be reused or recycled. The EMP commitment is to ensure proper storage, 
recycling, reusing, removal, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous solid waste and hazardous solid waste including medical waste.   

Heritage 

The few heritage finds in the Otjikoto Mine area were identified during EIA studies and have been registered with the National Heritage 
Council.  Archeological sites of significance identified during the EIA studies have been preserved to prevent any potential disturbances to 
these sites.  There have been no new archaeological finds since operations commenced.  A chance find process procedure is in place to 
inform and provide awareness to field employees and contractors. 

Noise 
Noise and vibration monitoring occur within a 15 km radius of the blasting zone to measure air-blast and vibration and evaluate potential 
impacts.  The monitoring threshold used is the recommended best practice guidelines of 135 dB as per the United States Bureau of Mines.  
An ambient noise monitoring program commenced in November 2017. 

Visual 

B2Gold will continue to minimize visual impacts as a result of mining activity.  Steps that have been taken to date include progressive 
rehabilitation to vegetate areas such as the WRSFs and the TSF wall; use of non-reflective materials in building construction; ensuring the 
colour of buildings and facilities blends in with the surrounding environment; and use of localized lighting that is directed to specific site areas 
and as much as practicable does not emit light beyond the work task or security area. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 20-6 

 

 

The current crest elevations of the TSF embankment is 1,508.5 mamsl, the starter 
embankment crest elevation is 1,505 mamsl. and the cyclone sands embankment 
extends an additional 3.5 m above the starter embankment.  The embankment is 
planned to be raised to a final elevation of 1,538 m (for a total TSF embankment height 
of 44.5 m) at a future rate of rise over the life of the mine between 2.5 and 3.1 metres 
per year.   

The current tailings surface pond holds a maximum of 323,000 Mm3 of water.  The 
surface pond water volume is minimized to the extent practical, with excess water 
decanted from the facility to be returned to the processing mill.  The surface pond 
volume fluctuates seasonally with the wet season and larger pond volumes occurring 
typically from December to March; in 2018 the maximum surface pond volume was 
estimated at approximately 285,000 Mm3. 

As of December 2018, the TSF contained approximately 13.4 Mt of tailings.  The 
current mine plan projects the total tailings to the end of mine life at approximately 
50 Mt. 

20.2.2 Waste Disposal 

The waste rock storage facility (WRSF) is situated on relatively level ground north of 
the processing mill and west of the open mine pits.  A relatively small proportion 
(approximately 2.5%) of the waste rock is potentially acid generating, but the 
considerably larger proportion of waste rock with excess neutralisation potential can be 
used to mitigate the risk of acid rock drainage. In addition, portions of the WRSF are 
constructed with a 5 m base layer of calcrete to provide neutralizing capacity for any 
seepage that may leave the facility. 

The WRSF design consists of 10 m benches, with a current facility height of 
approximately 15 m and a final design height of 30 m.  Waste rock is deposited by end 
tipping within the WRSF and tip faces are pushed down to a final slope angle of 
approximately 18 degrees (1V:3H) in preparation for rehabilitation.  

As of December 2018, the WRSF contained approximately 78.5 Mt of waste rock. 

20.3 Water Management 

As the Otjikoto Mine is located in an arid environment, with minimal annual 
precipitation, effective water management is an important aspect to the Otjikoto 
operation.   Our water resource management efforts are focused on keeping clean 
water clean and minimizing the amount of water impacted by mining activities.    

A principal diversion channel is used to intercept storm water run-off from the east 
before it enters the operations, diverting water to the north and west around the open 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 20-7 

 

 

pits and waste rock dump. Smaller diversion channels also direct water to the west 
around the TSF and around the mill and processing infrastructure. 

Water is recycled at the operation to the greatest extent practical; management of the 
TSF water inventory requires that recycling of water to the mill is maximized.  A portion 
of pit borehole dewatering water is re-injected to the groundwater aquifer to minimize 
groundwater abstraction.  Water is treated in two processes on site.  Two small 
sewage treatment plant treats site domestic waste water to acceptable discharge limits 
and this effluent is discharged to lined ponds and is evaporated.  The site does not 
discharge water to surface water or groundwater receptors. 

20.4 Site Monitoring 

The Otjikoto Mine employs an Environmental Department which is located at the mine 
site and is responsible for compliance monitoring, administering environmental 
permits, interfacing with regulators, and maintaining an environmental management 
system that is in alignment with ISO 14001 requirements. 

The Project's environmental management system consists of an overall Environmental 
Management Plan supported by a number of component management plans and 
supporting procedures.  These plans and procedures outline the management and 
mitigation measures that are implemented at the site to manage and reduce potential 
environmental impacts to acceptable levels.  The Environmental Management Plan 
was in the process of being updated in 2018 to reflect the current status of the Project 
and once completed will be submitted to the MET for approval. 

Specific component plans in place include: 

 Stakeholder Consultation/Communication Management Plan; 

 Safety and Security Management Plan; 

 Surface Water/Storm Water Management Plan; 

 Groundwater Management Plan; 

 Air Quality Management Plan; 

 Noise & Vibrations Management Plan; 

 Biodiversity Management Plan; 

 Visual Management Plan; 

 Archaeology Management Plan; 

 Traffic Management Plan; 

 Socio-Economic Management Plan; 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 20-8 

 

 

 Resource Management Plan; 

 Soil Management Plan; 

 Waste Management Plan.  

Performance on these EMP management plans is reported on a bi-annual basis within 
the three years of the valid ECC and a three-year performance report is required for a 
renewal of the ECC.  The EMP and its supporting individual Management Plans (MP) 
are "living documents" which will continue to be amended periodically throughout the 
life of the Project to reflect changes in procedures, practices, Project phase, etc. 

20.5 Permitting 

Various permits and authorizations are required for the Otjikoto Gold Mine.  B2Gold 
currently holds all environmental permits required for operations.   

20.5.1 Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) 

The 2015 ECC for the Otjikoto operations was renewed in 2018.  The Otjikoto Mine 
received approval to continue with operations, with the issue of the August, 2018 ECC. 
The 2018 ECC requires that the Otjikoto Mine operations continue with the monitoring 
and evaluation of environmental performance with established targets for 
improvements as per the 2018 EMP.  The 2018 approval was granted based on the 
performance of the Otjikoto project against its initial EMP over the Project's first three 
years of operations.  The ECC is valid for three years, requiring renewal in 2021.  

20.5.2 Mining Licence 

ML 169 for the Otjikoto Mine Project was granted to Auryx Gold Namibia (Pty) Ltd in 
December 2012, and the licence holder/company name was changed to B2Gold 
Namibia (Pty) Ltd in July 2013.  The mining licence is issued in respect of base and 
rare metals and industrial minerals and precious metals with conditions on 
environmental protection (Part 3).   

20.5.3 Approval of Mine Closure and Rehabilitation Plan 

As part of granting approval for a project under the Environmental Management Act 7 
of 2007, (EMA), a draft closure and rehabilitation plan is required.  The Otjikoto project 
was approved with a mine closure framework (MCF) in 2012 to satisfy the requirement 
of the EMA.  A mine closure and rehabilitation plan has been developed in 2018 for the 
Otjikoto project and it is in the process of submission to the MET for approval.  The 
closure and rehabilitation plan will be reviewed every two years to reflect the current 
closure and rehabilitation developments of the project.

20.5.4 Additional Permits and Authorizations 

Several additional permits and authorizations are required for the Project.  B2Gold 
holds all environmental permits required for operations.  Key environmental permits 
granted since 2015 are summarized in Table 20-2.  Permits marked as "in progress" 
are currently in the process of being renewed. 

Other than as outlined in this Report section, B2Gold is not aware of any significant 
permits or environmental factors that may affect the right or ability to continue 
operations.  Additionally, B2Gold is not aware of any reasons why all additional 
environmental operational permits will not be granted. 

20.6 Mine Reclamation and Closure Considerations 

Namibian legislation requires that a draft mine closure and rehabilitation plan is 
developed at the early phase of a project (EMA, 2017) and that mines decommission 
and clean up at closure (Minerals Act, 1991).  

The initial, approved Mine Closure Framework (2015) was updated by an SLR Group 
company (SLR) in April 2018.  As detailed in this 2018 Rehabilitation and Closure 
Plan, the mine area will be restored to a functioning post-mining land use.  The initial 
proposed post-mining land use includes game farming and nature conservancy, 
however, determination and agreement (with surrounding communities, regulatory 
authorities and other relevant stakeholders) of final post-mining land use requires 
additional closure-specific consultation with stakeholders.   

Closure objectives were developed taking into account the local environmental context 
of the existing mining operation, regulatory and corporate requirements, perceived 
stakeholder expectations (informed by stakeholder consultation undertaken as part of 
environmental assessment processes) and Industry Best Practice considerations.  Key 
objectives include: 

 Comply with Namibian legal requirements; 

 Comply with B2Gold's legally binding commitments and conform to B2Gold's 
internal and Corporate requirements; 

 Reduce or eliminate adverse environmental effects once the mine ceases 
operations; 

 Protect the environment by using safe and responsible closure practices;

 Establish conditions which are consistent with the predetermined end use 
objectives; i.e., re-establish a landscape that can over time regenerate sustainable 
endemic vegetation communities and ensure that an ecologically functioning 
(fauna and flora) environment is left behind; 

 Reduce the need for long-term monitoring and maintenance by establishing 
effective physical, chemical and ecological stability of disturbed areas. 

B2Gold has made decommissioning and closure-related commitments in EIA and EMP 
documents, covering aspects such as stakeholder communication; third-party safety 
and security; biodiversity; surface water and groundwater; effluent and spillages waste 
management; air quality; heritage; rehabilitation; waste management and socio-
economics. 

The concepts for reclamation and closure of the main Otjikoto Mine facilities includes: 

 Mine pits:  Final pit voids will be left open and will be provided with perimeter 
berms and security fencing to restrict access to humans and wildlife. Preliminary 
assessments indicate that long-term water management of pit water flows (surface 
water and groundwater) will not be necessary; 

 Tailings storage facility:  The tailings impoundment will be provided with an 
engineered cover system designed to reduce infiltration of surface water into the 
underlying tailings to convey surface water runoff off of the facility.  Once tailings 
deposition has ceased, the phreatic surface within the deposited tailings will 
gradually reduce as part of the natural drawdown process. Drawdown will result in 
ongoing seepage from the toe and blanket drains that are present above the TSF 
lining system. This seepage will be collected in the solution trench around the TSF 
and will be directed to the lined return water dam. Once the drawdown process is 
complete, seepage will reduce to de minimis volumes and no further active 
management is anticipated. Thereafter, the remaining infrastructure (e.g., return 
water dam) will be decommissioned and removed/disposed of appropriately;  

 Waste rock storage facility: The waste rock storage facility will be capped with an 
engineered cover system designed to reduce infiltration of surface water into the 
underlying waste rock and to convey surface water runoff off of the facility.  The 
slopes of the facility will be rehabilitated to reduce long-term erosion and minimize 
long-term maintenance; 

 Onsite infrastructure: All infrastructure not needed for the post-closure 
requirements will be decommissioned.  Hazardous material and high value 
components will be removed and the remainder of the facilities demolished and 
removed/disposed of in accordance with regulatory requirements.  Disturbed land 
will be landscaped into a natural form to blend with the surrounding topography, 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 20-12 

 

 

and rehabilitated to form stable landforms.  Rehabilitation will be in accordance 
with the approved post-mining land use. 

The rehabilitation and closure plans include a combination of progressive rehabilitation 
in addition to final closure planning.  Progressive rehabilitation has taken place on the 
initial, completed benches of the WRSF, on the TSF starter wall embankments and 
along sections of roads no longer needed for the mining operations. 

Rehabilitated areas will require aftercare and maintenance to ensure closure success. 
These activities will typically include erosion control and slope repair; fertilising of 
struggling rehabilitated areas; monitoring of groundwater quality; monitoring of 
vegetation composition and diversity; control and eradication of alien plants; and 
monitoring air quality (i.e., dust fallout). 

An eight-year post-closure period for maintenance and aftercare has been 
provisionally allowed for. It is currently anticipated that most of the maintenance and 
aftercare activities will be undertaken in the first three years following closure (the 
active maintenance period), and thereafter the frequency of activities is expected to 
stop (in areas where vegetation is considered self-sustaining) and/or decline (passive 
maintenance period).  The passive maintenance period is anticipated to be a further 
five years of maintenance and monitoring at a reduced frequency. 

The Otjikoto Mine updates on an annual basis the estimate of its environmental 
reclamation and closure liabilities.  The Otjikoto Mine's environmental liabilities as of 
December 31, 2018 are estimated at approximately US$24.8 million. 

20.7 Social and Community Considerations 

The Otjikoto Mine operations and activities associated with the mine have 
socioeconomic impacts on the surrounding communities.  

 Economic: Major positive direct and indirect impacts due to procurement of goods 
and services, the creation of jobs and attendant training and skills-building of 
employees. Procurement and human resource activities prioritize local people as 
well as historically disadvantaged people in accordance with Namibian regulation. 
The potential negative economic impacts of mine closure will be managed by the 
mine closure plan; 

 Neighbouring farms: There have been minimal impacts on neighbouring farms as 
the B2Gold and contractor workforce lives in established nearby communities and 
strict environmental management plans are in place. B2Gold maintains regular 
engagement to share environmental monitoring data and address any issues that 
arise;  

 In-migration and resulting health, safety and security issues in nearby towns: 
B2Gold encourages workers to settle in nearby towns, which have established 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 20-13 

 

 

social infrastructure and are large enough to adapt to in-migration. Regular 
engagement is conducted with nearby towns to identify social issues which can be 
addressed through community investment activities. B2Gold also conducts 
ongoing training and wellness programs for its workforce to reduce the potential 
social risks due to in-migration.  

A Social Investment Strategy has been developed with the input from key local, 
regional and national stakeholders to enhance the positive impacts and minimize 
negative impacts of the mine. A Social Investment Board has been created composed 
of a majority of external stakeholders, which oversees the development and 
implementation of annual social investment plans and budgets.  Social investment 
focuses on four key areas: livelihood, education, conservation and health.   

The first priority for implementation of community development initiatives and projects 
are the nearby communities (e.g., Otjiwarongo and Otavi) and within the Otjozondjupa 
region, however, the Otjikoto mine also supports community development projects 
throughout Namibia. 

Examples of measures implemented to minimize social and economic impacts include:  

 Regional small and medium enterprise projects;  

 Funding of school projects in Otavi and Otjiwarongo;  

 Support of regional activities (e.g. science fair, Otavi Expo, Otjiwarongo 
showgrounds); 

 Early childhood education projects. 

The Stakeholder Engagement Plan is developed that identifies stakeholders impacted 
by or interested in B2Gold's activities and relevant engagement activities. The Otjikoto 
Mine regularly engages stakeholders (e.g., surrounding communities, neighboring 
landowners/farmers, regulatory authorities) to provide them with information regarding 
the environmental and social performance of the mine, and to address any issues that 
are raised.  

Activities include:  

 Consultations and engagements with the communities; neighbouring farmers, 
Otjiwarongo and Otavi town councils and the public;  

 Consultations with key government stakeholders on environmental issues; 
reporting, permit applications, amendments etc. and general consultations;  

 Site visits by MET, Ministry of Health and social and other services; 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 20-14 

 

 

 Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including the University of Namibia 
students and Namibia University of Science and Technology, for educational and 
research purposes;  

 Business partners, investors and interested parties on business opportunities, 
concerns, and improvements. 

A Community Grievance Mechanism is in place to address any complaints from 
external stakeholders.  B2Gold investigates all grievances and provides a formal 
response to the complainant.  In general, relations with external stakeholders are good 
and stakeholder grievances have been limited.

21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

21.1 Introduction 

Cost estimates are based on the Otjikoto 2018 LOMP, which is based on mining and 
processing existing Mineral Reserves and approximately 5.5 Mt from the indicated 
Mineral Resource low-grade stockpile when higher grade feed is not available.  
Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic 
viability. 

The life of mine plan assumes Owner-operated mining with mining and processing 
extending through 2026 (eight years including 2019).   

As Otjikoto is an operating project, the costs are primarily based on actual operating 
and capital costs. 

21.2 Capital Cost Estimates 

21.2.1 Basis of Estimate 

As the Otjikoto Mine is a steady state operation, capital costs largely comprise mobile 
equipment costs (replace and rebuild).  An allowance for miscellaneous tools and 
equipment, small projects, and other minor capital costs has been included for mining, 
processing, and site general.  All capital costs are assumed to be sustaining capital, as 
the current life of mine plan assumes no expansions to processing or mining capacity. 

21.2.2 Labour Assumptions 

External labour costs are assumed to be included in the purchase price for plant and 
equipment.  Owner labour to support rebuilds is included in operating costs, and is 
excluded from capital costs. 

21.2.3 Contingency 

As the capital costs are based on actual recent prices, an allowance for contingency 
has not been included. 

21.2.4 Mine Capital Costs 

Mining capital costs are based on continuing with Owner-operator mining.  These 
costs are based on recent actual costs and current maintenance practices for 
scheduling of rebuilds and equipment replacements.  Prestripping costs are not 
included in mining capital costs as they are included in the operating cost calculation. 

Additional trucks are scheduled to be added to the fleet in 2020 and 2021 to maintain 
production levels as the increase in pit depths results in longer haulage cycle times. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 21-2 

 

 

21.2.5 Process Capital Costs 

Process capital costs have been estimated to average $300,000 per year, for a total of 
$2.4 million over the remaining life of mine. 

21.2.6 General and Administrative Capital Costs 

Site G&A capital costs have been estimated to average $360,000 per year, for a total 
of $2.9 million over the remaining life of mine. 

21.2.7 Infrastructure Capital Costs 

The site power plant requires rebuild and replacement costs totalling $13.1 M over the 
remaining life of mine. 

21.2.8 Capital Cost Summary 

The overall capital cost estimate is summarized in Table 21-1. 

21.3 Operating Cost Estimates 

21.3.1 Basis of Estimate 

Operating costs are based on recent actual costs, projected through the current 
Mineral Reserve based life of mine plan and supported by recent actual costs including 
2018 labour rates and fuel prices. 

21.3.2 Mine Operating Costs 

Table 21-2 contains a summary of the mine operating costs by area based on mining 
up to 39 Mt/a and processing 3.5 Mt/a.  Stockpile and re-handle costs are not included 
since these are associated with processing. 

21.3.3 Process Operating Costs 

Table 21-3 contains a summary of the process operating costs by area based on 
processing 3.5 Mt/a.  Stockpile and re-handle costs are included since these are not 
included in mining operating costs. 

21.3.4 Infrastructure Operating Costs 

Infrastructure and other distributable costs (power, light vehicles, equipment 
maintenance) are included in the mining and processing operating costs.

21.3.5 General and Administrative Operating Costs 

General and Administrative operating costs are budgeted at $3.31/t in 2019, and 
average $3.04/t for the remaining life of mine (excluding 2019). 

21.3.6 Operating Cost Summary 

The projected LOMP operating costs are summarized in Table 21-4.   

21.4 Comments on Section 21 

The capital and operating costs for the Project are based on recent actual costs and 
the Mineral Reserve-based LOMP.  The costs indicate operating and total costs below 
the Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource cost bases ($1,250/oz Au and 
$1,400/oz Au, respectively).  Cost reduction strategies including mining bulk waste 
with a mining contractor are being considered. 

LOMP capital cost estimates total $126.5 million. 

LOMP operating cost estimates total $831.57/oz Au produced, or $31.30/t processed. 

There is Project upside potential if economics can support a mining contractor to mine 
a portion of the bulk waste or underground mining is proven to be more cost effective 
than open pit mining in phase four of the Wolfshag open pit.

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 Economic Analysis 

B2Gold is using the provision for producing issuers, whereby producing issuers may 
exclude the information required under Item 22 for technical reports on properties 
currently in production and where no material production expansion is planned.   

Mineral Reserve declaration is supported by a positive cash flow.  

22.2 Comments on Section 22 

An economic analysis was performed in support of estimation of the Mineral Reserves; 
this indicated a positive cash flow using the assumptions detailed in this Report.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

25.1 Introduction 

The QPs note the following interpretations and conclusions in their respective areas of 
expertise, based on the review of data available for this Report. 

25.2 Mineral Tenure, Surface Rights, Water Rights, Royalties and Agreements 

Information obtained from B2Gold experts supports that the support that the mineral 
tenure held is valid, and the granted mining lease is sufficient to support a declaration 
of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 

Surface rights, in the form of five B2Gold-owned farms, is sufficient to allow mining 
operations. 

Where exploration activities are conducted on ground where the surface rights are 
held by third parties, B2Gold typically enters into compensation agreements for any 
land disturbance with the surface rights owner. 

Water rights are granted, and sufficient to support mining operations.  The current 
permit, which expires in 2020, can be renewed providing all conditions are met. 

The Namibian Minerals Act levies a royalty of 3% on the net sales of gold and silver.  
There is a 1% export levy on gross gold revenue.  

The Otjikoto Project is not subject to any other back-in rights payments, agreements or 
encumbrances. 

To the extent known, there are no other significant factors and risks that may affect 
access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the Project that have not been 
discussed in this Report. 

25.3 Geology and Mineralization 

The Otjikoto and Wolfshag deposits are interpreted to be examples of orogenic gold 
deposits. 

The geological understanding of the settings, lithologies, and structural and alteration 
controls on mineralization in the different zones is sufficient to support estimation of 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.  The geological knowledge of the area is 
also considered sufficiently acceptable to reliably inform mine planning. 

The mineralization style and setting are well understood and can support declaration of 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 

Exploration at Otjikoto remains focused on testing targets proximal to the current mine 
operations.  The highest-priority targets are the continued testing of the down plunge

Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report

continuation of the Otjikoto and Wolfshag shoots below the current pit limits and areas 
within proximity of the pits.  Regional exploration work is ongoing with geophysics used 
as the principal tool to define targets under the extensive calcrete cover.  These 
programs are focusing on the Okonguarri Formation, where it is situated between the 
Footwall Marble and Karibib Formation marble. 

25.4 Exploration, Drilling and Analytical Data Collection in Support of Mineral 
Resource Estimation 

The exploration programs completed to date are appropriate for the style of the 
deposits on the Project. 

Sampling methods are acceptable for Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
estimation. 

Sample preparation, analysis and security are generally performed in accordance with 
exploration best practices and industry standards. 

The quantity and quality of the lithological, geotechnical, collar and down-hole survey 
data collected during the exploration and delineation drilling programs are sufficient to 
support Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation.  The collected sample data 
adequately reflect deposit dimensions, true widths of mineralization, and the style of 
the deposits.  Sampling is representative of the gold grades in the deposits, reflecting 
areas of higher and lower grades. 

The QA/QC programs adequately address issues of precision, accuracy and 
contamination.  Drilling programs typically included blanks, duplicates and CRM 
samples.  QA/QC submission rates meet industry-accepted standards.   

A review of sample preparation procedures over time that was completed in 2016 
indicated that in some sample batches, coarse material was being left in the minus-
fraction submitted for assay.  As a result, in late 2016 and early 2017, a re-sampling 
and re-assaying program was undertaken, consisting of about 14,000 remnant half-
core samples.  The re-assay data replaced the original analyses in the database. 

The data verification programs concluded that the data collected from the Project 
adequately support the geological interpretations and constitute a database of 
sufficient quality to support the use of the data in Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve estimation. 

25.5 Metallurgical Testwork 

Metallurgical testwork and associated analytical procedures were appropriate to the 
mineralization type, appropriate to establish the optimal processing routes, and were 
performed using samples that are typical of the mineralization styles found within the 
Project. 



 Otjikoto Gold Mine 
Namibia 

NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

March 2019 Page 25-3 

 

 

Samples selected for testing were representative of the various types and styles of 
mineralization.  Samples were selected from a range of depths within the deposits. 
Sufficient samples were taken so that tests were performed on sufficient sample mass. 

Recovery factors estimated are based on appropriate metallurgical testwork, and are 
appropriate to the mineralization types and the selected process routes.  The LOM 
recovery forecast is 98%. 

There are no deleterious elements known that would affect process activities or 
metallurgical recoveries 

25.6 Mineral Resource Estimates 

Mineral Resources are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards, and assume 
both open pit and underground mining methods. 

Factors that may affect the estimates include metal price and exchange rate 
assumptions; changes to the assumptions used to generate the gold grade cut-off 
grade; changes in local interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of 
mineralized zones; changes to geological and mineralization shape and geological and 
grade continuity assumptions; variations in density and domain assignments; 
geometallurgical and oxidation assumptions; changes to geotechnical, mining and 
metallurgical recovery assumptions; change to the input and design parameter 
assumptions that pertain to the conceptual pit and stope designs constraining the 
estimates; and assumptions as to the continued ability to access the site, retain 
mineral and surface rights titles, maintain environment and other regulatory permits, 
and maintain the social license to operate. 

There is upside potential for the estimates if mineralization that is currently classified 
as Inferred can be upgraded to higher-confidence Mineral Resource categories. 

25.7 Mineral Reserve Estimates 

Mineral Reserves are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards and are based 
on open pit mining methods. 

Factors that may affect the estimate include changes to the following assumptions:  
metal prices; pit slope and geotechnical; unforeseen dilution; hydrogeological and pit 
dewatering; assumptions used when evaluating the potential economics of Phases 3 
and 4 of each of the pits; the amount and grade of stockpile material required to 
maintain operations during the wet season; capital and operating cost inputs; and 
modifying factors, in particular social, permitting and environmental considerations. 

There is upside potential for the estimates if mineralization that is currently classified 
as Mineral Resources potentially amenable to underground mining methods can be 
converted to Mineral Reserves following appropriate technical studies.

25.8 Mine Plan 

The mining operations use conventional open pit mining methods and equipment.   

Mining is based on a phased approach with stockpiling to bring high-grade forward and 
provide operational flexibility.  

Four pit phases are planned for each of the Otjikoto and Wolfshag pits.  Phase 1 of 
each pit is complete.   

Mine and mill production are scheduled for eight years with the mining rate dropping 
the last two years with material from the low-grade stockpiles supplementing the 
process feed.  

25.9 Recovery Plan 

The process methods are conventional to the industry.  The comminution and recovery 
processes are widely used in the industry with no significant elements of technological 
innovation. 

The process plant flowsheet design was based on testwork results, previous study 
designs and industry standard practices.  

The process facilities in use are appropriate to the mineralization styles.   

The plant will produce variations in recovery due to the day-to-day changes in ore type 
or combinations of ore type being processed.  These variations are expected to trend 
to the forecast recovery value for monthly or longer reporting periods. 

25.10 Infrastructure 

All key infrastructure is built for the Otjikoto operations, and mill feed is sourced from 
two open pits.   

Mine access is from the B1 national highway directly to the administration area via a 
dedicated, private mine access road.  All roads near and connecting the 
administration, processing and mine facilities are appropriately sized for two-way 
traffic. 

The tailings storage facility was constructed using upstream construction techniques, 
and is conventional for the industry.  There is sufficient storage capacity for the 
planned LOM. 

Hydraulic designs and water management plans focus on isolating the storm water 
from the process water and minimizing water use.  All water falling directly on the 
industrial areas (contacted water) or otherwise contacted (fissure water from the mine 
pit, return and storm water from the tailings facility) is stored and used in the mining 
and processing facilities.

The power plant was constructed with 24 MW of installed generating capacity.  In 2018 
a 7 MW solar plant was installed.  The on-site generation system can produce 
sufficient power to meet LOMP requirements.  

Low-level earthquake activity has been recorded regionally.  The highest intensity 
event recorded in the Project vicinity is a magnitude 4.8 event in 1980, centred about 
25–30 km to the north of the mining operation. 

25.11 Environmental, Permitting and Social Considerations 

B2Gold conducts ongoing monitoring and annual reporting under the terms of its 
permits and approvals.   

The EMP is currently being updated for submittal and approval by the MET.  This 2018 
EMP will reflect the current status (i.e., include changes to the Project and updates to 
its environmental mitigation and management measures) of the Project and will be 
submitted to the MET upon completion. 

The Otjikoto Mine updates on an annual basis the estimate of its environmental 
reclamation and closure liabilities.  The Otjikoto Mine's environmental liabilities as of 
December 31, 2018 are estimated at approximately US$24.8 million. 

B2Gold holds all permits required for compliant operations.  Permits that are not 
granted for the life of operations are renewed as required. 

A Social Investment Strategy has been developed with the input from key local, 
regional and national stakeholders.  A Social Investment Board has been created 
composed of a majority of external stakeholders.  A Stakeholder Engagement Plan is 
developed that identifies stakeholders impacted by or interested in B2Gold's activities 
and relevant engagement activities.  A Community Grievance Mechanism is in place to 
address any complaints from external stakeholders.    

25.12 Markets and Contracts 

Doré from the mine is readily marketable, and contracts are in place for doré sales.  

Commodity prices used in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates are set by 
B2Gold corporately.  The current gold price provided for Mineral Reserve estimation is 
$1,250/oz, and $1,400/oz for Mineral Resource estimation. 

Major contracts include fuel supply, blasting explosives and accessories, and grade 
control drilling.  Contracts are negotiated and renewed as needed.  Contract terms are 
typical of similar contracts in Namibia.

25.13 Capital Cost Estimates 

As the Otjikoto is a steady state operation capital costs are largely comprised of mobile 
equipment costs (replace and rebuild).  An allowance for miscellaneous tools and 
equipment, small projects, and other minor capital costs has been included for mining, 
processing, and site general.  All capital costs are assumed to be sustaining capital, as 
the current life of mine plan assumes no expansions to processing or mining capacity. 

Capital cost estimates are acceptable to support declaration of Mineral Reserves.  The 
LOMP estimated total capital cost is $126.5 million. 

25.14 Operating Cost Estimates 

Operating costs are based on recent actual costs, projected through the current 
Mineral Reserve based life of mine plan and supported by recent actual costs including 
2018 labour rates and fuel prices. 

Operating cost estimates are acceptable to support declaration of Mineral Reserves. 

LOMP operating cost estimates total $831.57/oz Au produced, or $31.30/t processed. 

25.15 Economic Analysis Supporting Mineral Reserve Declaration 

B2Gold is using the provision for producing issuers, whereby producing issuers may 
exclude the information required under Item 22 for technical reports on properties 
currently in production and where no material expansion of current production is 
planned. 

An economic analysis to support presentation of Mineral Reserves was conducted.  
Under the assumptions presented in this Report, the operations show a positive cash 
flow, and can support Mineral Reserve estimation.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

26.1 Introduction 

The work programs recommended focus on evaluation of the potential for underground 
operations, and on mine design improvements (phase 1) and additional drilling around 
a possible future underground mining (phase 2) that is contingent completion of, and 
positive results from, the first phase of work. 

The first phase of work consists of drilling and mine improvement studies, and is 
budgeted at about $2.6 million.  The second phase, if undertaken, is estimated at 
about $4–$6 million.  

26.2 Phase 1 

26.2.1 Exploration Drilling 

Drilling will initially focus on the down plunge extension of Otjikoto and Wolfshag 
deposits with a budgetary cost of approximately $2.5 million.  This cost is inclusive of 
drilling, mobilization, assay and labour.  

26.2.2 Mine Design 

Mining cost optimisation should be conducted to identify cost savings measures to 
reduce the LOM operating and sustaining capital costs.  This analysis should consider 
a trade-off study between owner and contractor mining, based on the current LOM 
plan.  This step is estimated at about $10,000 to $20,000.  The planned work 
programs would be performed internally by B2Gold personnel.  

Due to the high strip ratio at Wolfshag Phase 4, a scoping-level mining method trade-
off study should be conducted to determine which mining method is more cost 
effective, open pit or underground.  This study should also evaluate Owner and 
contract mining options for underground.  The study is estimated to cost about 
$20,000–$25,000.  The planned work programs would be performed internally by 
B2Gold personnel.  

The LOM design should be reviewed and revised as-needed based on the findings of 
the on-going geotechnical evaluation of the pit slopes.  No budget allocation is 
included for this recommendation, as the expectation is that the work would be 
performed as part of B2Gold's normal planning cycle. 

The overall cost estimate for the mine design improvements recommendations is 
$30,000 to $45,000.

26.3 Phase 2 

Depending on the outcome of the trade-off study to evaluate mining the area of 
Wolfshag Phase 4 pit from underground or open pit, additional infill drilling may be 
completed.  The additional drilling could include exploration, metallurgical, 
hydrogeological, and geotechnical drill holes.   

A trade-off study to determine whether such drilling should be conducted from surface 
or a decline will also be considered.   

Completion of this second work phase is dependent on the results of the down-plunge 
extension drilling, and the underground/open pit mining evaluation.  The additional 
drilling may cost in the order of $4–$6 million, using the same all-in drilling costs as 
noted for the phase 1 drill program.
