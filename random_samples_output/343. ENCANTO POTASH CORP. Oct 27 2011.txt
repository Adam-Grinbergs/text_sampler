Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment

The project is located on the Muskowekwan Indian Reserve 85 (IR85, INAC Permit 
Number 368519) which is situated in south-eastern Saskatchewan approximately 
100 kilometers north-northeast of Regina.  The project area is approximately 100 
kilometers south-east of BHP Billiton's Jansen Project and approximately 125 
kilometres north-east of Mosaic's Belle Plaine Mine.  The project area includes 
16,831 acres of land that belongs to the Muskowekwan First Nations IR85. 

In 2010, Encanto Potash Corp. formed a formal Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) with 
the Muskowekwan First Nations and Muskowekwan Resources Limited Partnership 
(MRL).  The purpose of the JVA is to progressively develop plans to delineate a 
potash resource substantial enough to support a potential mining operation on the 
Muskowekwan First Nations' land. 

1 . 2  R E S O U R C E  E S T I M A T E  

The Mineral Resource is based on the assumption that the recovery of the potash 
will be by either solution mining or conventional underground mining methods as they 
exist today.  The depth to the potential mineable formations is shallower and at lower 
formation temperatures than operating Saskatchewan solution mining potash mines 
but deeper than operating Saskatchewan potash conventional mines therefore 
requiring further investigation into suitable extraction ratios.   As a result of the depth 
and yet to be determined economic factors, this report will present both a 
conventional and solution mining Resource.  The factors used to select the intervals 
for each Resource type scenario are presented below. 

The reader is cautioned that the two mining scenarios presented below should 
be treated as separate mineral resource calculations and should NOT be added 
together. The solution mining scenario was prepared as the base case with the 
conventional resource provided as an alternative case until additional 
engineering studies were completed.

Based on the solution mining methodology described in Hardy et al. (2010), the 
'solution interval' is defined as the entire Patience Lake Member, the salt interbed 
and the entire Belle Plaine Member.  It includes all barren interbed halite as well as 
insoluble rich layers.  An 'economic cutoff grade' for the top and bottom of the 
resource interval was assumed to be where K2O values were greater than 10% (15%

KCL) and where average 'mineable grade' was greater than 15% (23% KCL) (Hardy, 
Halabura, & Shewfelt, 2010).  The Esterhazy was not included in the calculation as it 
has an average carnallite grade of 7.57% (2.59% MgCl2) and the grade was lower 
than the economic threshold cutoff.

In determining the Resource for the conventional mining scenario a "Geological 
Interval" was chosen to calculate the Resource and was selected based on clay 
seam stratigraphy and nomenclature outlined by Phillips (1982).  The "Geological 
Interval" is defined as those intervals which include the uppermost bounding "marker" 
clay seams and the highest K2O values from assays. The intervals were also verified 
with wireline logs using consistent inflection points off of the gamma ray log.  The 
reader is cautioned that the thickness calculated in Table 1.2 is not a 'mining cut' and 
will likely be reduced if a conventional mining method is determined feasible.  Thick 
stable roof 'salt back' is necessary when mining potash conventionally.   The 
tonnages presented for the Lower Patience Lake and Upper Belle Plaine must not be 
added together as current mining practices dictate that only one mining horizon is 
extracted. Studies of bi-level mining may be conducted in the future. 

Current Saskatchewan operating mines prefer to have at minimum of seven meters 
of stable salt back.  Due to this criterion the Upper Patience Lake was not used in 
this calculation and drill holes 02-09 and 07-02 were removed from the Lower 
Patience Lake calculation.

Inferred and Indicated Resources are based on the distance from the cored and 
assayed drill holes on the property.  Various 43-101's were reviewed to determine an 
appropriate distance for the buffer radii and based on the interpreted geological 
constraints in the area the following maximum Resource radii were employed:  
Indicated 0 to 2.0 kilometers and Inferred 2.0 to 5.0 kilometers.  A summary of 
Inferred and Indicated Resources for the 'solution mining' scenario is presented in 
Tables 1-3a and 1.3b.  The resources for the 'conventional mining scenario' are 
presented in Table 1-4a and 1-4b.

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

1 . 6  E C O N O M I C  A N A L Y S I S  

Preliminary economic analysis of the options indicate the conventional mine would 
have a IRR of 20.9% and the solution mine a 23.6% IRR. These are based on AACE 
Class 5 capital estimate, OPEX of equivalent accuracy and a base potash price of 
$450/t FOB site.  Further details are given in Sections 20 and 21. 

1 . 7  M A J O R  R I S K S  

The major risks identified at this time include: 

 Permitting and licensing issues – affects both project schedule and cost 

 Organizational capacity to manage large capital projects – affects both 
project schedule and cost  

 The financial security of project execution – cash flow can affect project 
schedule especially at peak purchasing and construction phases 

 Availability of manpower – both for construction and operations can affect 
cost and schedule  

 Water supplies unidentified – can affect project cost and schedule 

 Limited conventional mine resources – affects mine life   

 Conventional mine depth – could affect mine productivity and life (cost) 

1 . 8  C O N C L U S I O N S  A N D  R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S  

Both mining methods have positive and negative attributes, but we believe that the 
solution mine is the stronger option and should be the basis of all further 
investigations. The pros and cons of solution mining include: 

 Longer mine life 

 Lower man power requirements  

 Lower CAPEX/tonne 

 Higher IRR 

 Greater water usage  



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 6 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

It will require approximately six (6) years for the solution mine to be brought into 
production. This includes further investigation plans, environmental licensing, 
preliminary design, detailed design and construction. 

Our main recommendations at this time include: 

 An additional well in the north east portion of the home reserve and another 
on the TLE lands once designated  

o Estimated cost: $2,000,000 

 Evaluation of the potential resource in the Esterhazy 

o Estimated cost: $100,000  

 Complete environmental licensing work (EIS submission) 

o Estimated cost: $2,000,000 

 Complete a pre-feasibility study of the solution mining option compete with 
various trade off studies 

o Estimated cost: $7,000,000

This report is a result of a collaborated effort by three consulting firms for Encanto 
Potash Company (Encanto).  Encanto commissioned a NI 43-101 compliant report 
covering potash mineral resource estimates, review of conventional and solution 
mining options, and a preliminary economic assessment based on AACE Class 5 
CAPEX and OPEX estimates. The project area is  located on the Muskowekwan First 
Nations land in south-eastern Saskatchewan.  North Rim Exploration Ltd. (North 
Rim) contributed the resource analysis and related report sections. NOVOPRO 
Project Development and Management (NOVOPRO) contributed the solution mine 
option analysis and related report sections. Tetra Tech Wardrop (Wardrop) provided 
overall coordination and contributed various report sections. 

The resource information upon which this report is based was obtained from five test 
holes drilled by Encanto as well as limited public record sources including other 
technical reports, geological reports, and potash geochemical assay analyses.  
Public records pertaining to recent and historical exploration activities within the area 
of interest were also referenced for the purposes of this report.  Core from the five 
test holes completed on the Project Area and which are referenced in this report are 
all available for inspection.  The core from these five test holes has been personally 
inspected by Tabetha A. Stirrett, P.Geo., to verify their contents.   

Throughout this report potash grades will be presented in percent K2O followed by 
the equivelent KCI value.  For example, 20% K2O will be shown as 20% (31.66%). 

For this report, North Rim performed the following scope of work: 
 Review of core and generation of new geological descriptions of the core 

from the 2009 and 2010 exploration programs run by Encanto and Barlon 
Engineering; 

 Plan and assist Barlon Engineering Group Ltd. (Barlon Engineering) to 
execute the 2010 exploration drill program; 

 Compilation and interpretation of regional and local geology; 

 Core analysis, geochemical assays, and summary of analytical 2010 results; 

 Review of RPS Boyd PetroSearch's 2D and 3D seismic reports; 

 Calculate Inferred and Indicated Resources; and 

 Mineral Resource estimate based on NI-43-101 compliance requirements.

As required by National Instrument (NI) 43-101, a site visit was made by North Rim 
QP Tabetha Stirrett on October 25, 2010.  The site visit consisted of location 
reconnaissance of each of the five drill holes as well as investigation of the local 
infrastructure within the project area.   

On June 22, 2011 a site visit was made by Wardrop QP's Stan Kotowski, John 
Cairns, Doug Ramsey, and Vern Funk to visually access the project location.  The 
site has not been visited to date by Wardrop QP's Al Johnson and Troy Meyers, 
North Rim's Earl Gebhardt, and NOVOPRO's QP Mike Hardy.  It was not deemed 
necessary, at this stage in the project development, for these individuals to visit the 
site. 

September 27, 2011 is the effective report.  The seismic survey data presented in 
this report is effective as of February, 2011.  Sample assay data received from the 
Saskatchewan Resource Council (SRC) is effective as of December, 2010.

In the preparation of this report, North Rim has acquired and employed information 
from publically available technical sources which are based upon the results of 
previous potash exploration activities carried out in the general Lestock, 
Saskatchewan area.  These sources are filed through the Saskatchewan 
Government Ministry of Energy and Resources and contain opinions and statements 
that were not prepared under North Rim's supervision; therefore, North Rim does not 
take responsibility for the accuracy of this historical data and these items will 
hereinafter be referred to as "third-party-reports" or "historical information."  It is not 
known if the personnel, facilities, or analytical procedures used by previous 
evaluators were independent, as well as if the authors of those reports were 
considered Qualified Persons as defined by NI 43-101. 

As with other Saskatchewan potash deposits, the Mineral Resource may be affected 
by subsurface geological phenomenon with adverse effects such as "salt collapses", 
"leach anomalies", and "washout anomalies."  This study estimates the extent of 
such anomalous ground.  Halabura et al. (2005) has identified that the Upper Belle 
Plaine Sub-member is currently not being exploited by conventional underground 
mining operations in Saskatchewan, nor has any attempt to do so been carried out in 
the past. 

The Phanerozoic stratigraphy in the Project Area and the processes of evaporate 
precipitation, diagenesis, dissolution, and preservation are topics of both historical 
and on-going research by numerous industry, academic, and government bodies.  
The detailed stratigraphic picks and correlations herein are based upon these 
reports; however, they have been modified as to the author's personal experience 
with the potash deposits of Saskatchewan.  Drill core examination and 
documentation for the 2010 drilling program was performed under the direct 
supervision of Mrs. Tabetha Stirrett, P.Geo.  Mineral Resource estimate calculations 
are based upon review of available technical sources and were completed under the 
direct supervision of Mr. Earl Gebhardt, P.Eng. 

North Rim has held internal discussions with company management as well as other 
several external experts in the industry who have been involved with the Encanto 
Potash Project.  The authors have relied upon the following experts for technical 
information: 

 Roger Edgecombe and Larry Herd of RPS Boyd PetroSearch for 2D and 3D 
seismic interpretations used in calculating the Mineral Resource (Section 9.2 
of this report). 

 The SRC for sample assays (Section 11.0 of this report).

The following section is a summary of setting information for the Project Area located 
in Saskatchewan, Canada. 

The Project Area is located on Indian Reserve 85 (IR85) and consists of Indian 
Mineral Title Lands owned by the Muskowekwan First Nations (Band Number 392).  
The lands are situated in southeastern Saskatchewan, immediately west of the town 
of Lestock and approximately 100.0 km north-northeast of Regina, Saskatchewan.  A 
regional location map outlining the Muskowekwan First Nations Indian Reserve 
Lands is shown in Figure 4.1 displaying the location relative to urban centers, 
Saskatchewan Potash Crown Reserve (CR) 837, and other First Nations lands. 

The Project Area is centrally located on IR85 and comprises a portion of the 
Muskowekwan First Nations Lands encompassing just under 26 sections of land and 
contains just over 16,831 acres including roads (Data Source for Project Boundary: 
Sask Cadastral Dataset from ISC).  The Project Area spans a total land base 
incorporating much of Township 27 and the southern half of Ranges 15 and 16 West 
of the Second Meridian.  A detailed project location map is shown in Figure 4.2 and 
includes township boundaries, infrastructure, surrounding Subsurface Mineral Permit 
boundaries, and Treaty Land Entitlement (TLE) Lands that Encanto is currently 
awaiting the ratifying vote from the Muskowekwan First Nations to gain access to.  
This report presents a Mineral Resource estimate for the Project Area only, and does 
not factor the remaining Muskowekwan Indian Reserve TLE lands into the 
calculation.

In Saskatchewan, surface rights are subject to separate ownership and title from the 
subsurface (i.e. mineral rights); therefore, the securing of mineral rights does not 
secure the surface rights, unless on Indian Reserve Land.  The surface and mineral 
rights of interest belong to the Muskowekwan First Nations.  Indian Mineral Lands 
were granted to the First Nations of Saskatchewan by virtue of the treaties signed 
during the 19th Century.  When the First Nations were given their original reserves, 
the title gave them ownership of both the surface and sub-surface minerals. 

In Accordance with the Indian Oil and Gas Act (1974-1976), "Indian lands, means 
lands reserved for the Indians, including any interests therein, surrendered in 
accordance with the Indian Act and includes any lands or interests in lands described 
in any grant, lease, permit, license or other disposition…" 

The Encanto Potash Corp. and the Muskowekwan First Nation Surface and 
Subsurface Agreement issued by the Indian and Northern Affairs of Canada (INAC) 
can be found in Appendix A (Note: INAC is now called the Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development Canada AANDC). 

In Saskatchewan, mineral tenure is regulated and governed by both the Subsurface 
Mineral Regulations (1960) and the Crown Minerals Act (1984-85-86).  Modified 
excerpts from Halabura et al. (2005) can be found below.  Four main types of 
subsurface mineral rights are identified in Saskatchewan and consist of: 

1. Crown Mineral Rights; 

2. Freehold Mineral Rights;  

3. Indian Mineral Rights; and 

4. "Split" Mineral Rights.   

Subsurface mineral rights are defined by the Subsurface Mineral Regulations (1960) 
to include all natural mineral salts of boron, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, 
sodium, bromine, chlorine, fluorine, iodine, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulphur.  
These rights include their compounds, occurring greater than 60.0 m (200.0 ft) below 
ground level as well as any other mineral substance declared a "subsurface mineral" 
by the Lieutenant Government in Council. 

Crown Mineral Rights are mineral titles that are owned by the Saskatchewan 
Provincial Government and in some instances the federal government as in the case 
of national parks or Indian reservations. 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 14   1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

The subsurface mineral rights could have originally been acquired in one of two 
ways: 

 In 1930 from the Government of Canada, when ownership of Crown mineral 
titles held since 1870 were transferred to Saskatchewan; or  

 Where mineral titles were acquired by the Government of Saskatchewan 
from Freehold owners, usually due to non-payment of mineral or other forms 
of taxes.  The "Mineral Taxation Act" became law on January 1, 1945 where 
individuals are taxed only on mineral rights in excess of 3,200 acres. 

Today provincially held mineral rights are administered by the Saskatchewan 
Government Ministry of Energy and Mines.  Roughly four-fifths of mineral rights are 
held by the Crown under the jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Government and the 
other fifth is freehold. 

Freehold Subsurface Mineral Rights are mineral titles which are owned by 
companies or by private individuals and can be disposed of under any terms and 
conditions the owner chooses.  Any homestead grants issued after the late 1800's 
were for surface rights only and the mineral rights remained the property of the 
Crown.  In some cases both the surface and mineral rights could be obtained when 
Saskatchewan settlers purchased land from private holding companies or railways.  
Over the years most Freehold titles have passed through several owners and in 
some instances the mineral rights have been separated from the surface title.  

After the formal Canadian Government was in place, the Indian Act of 1876 was 
formed in order to attempt to solve the problem of European and other settlers 
occupying land initially inhabited by First Nations peoples.  Indian Mineral Rights 
describe lands that were granted to the Saskatchewan First Nations by virtue of the 
Treaties signed during the 1870's.  Original reserve titles given to the First Nations 
gave them ownership of both the surface and mineral rights. 

Split Mineral Rights are mineral titles where the ownership is split between two 
separate parties which could include the Saskatchewan Government or private 
owners.  This situation initially arose in the 1940's as a factor of the initial petroleum 
boom.

The terms of the Subsurface Minerals agreement is between Her Majesty the Queen 
(represented by the Minister of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development) (Her Majesty) and the Muskowekwan Resources Limited Partnership 
(MRL).   

A Permit agreement between Her Majesty and MRL was signed on November 9th, 
2009.  Below is a summary of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern

The responsibility for managing mineral resources has historically been placed onto 
the respective provincial governments with the exception of Nunavut and The 
Northwest Territories and Indian Reserve land where the Canadian Federal 
Government acts through AANDC (was INAC).  AANDC is a federally regulated body 
that acts in the best interests of First Nations and as an intermediary between parties 
(Mineral Exploration Webpage, 2010). 

INAC has regulations that vary by province/territory and Indian Reserve that regulate 
mineral claims, map staking, exploration, mining, mine closure and other mining 
related activities.  The Canadian Federal Government, through INAC, legislates land 
use and disposition in Nunavut, The Northwest Territories, and Canadian Indian 
Reserves.  Exploration is allowed on all Crown land except for land protected from 
mining activities.  Access to Aboriginal lands or Indian Reserves is prohibited unless 
consent and compensation is given to the surface rights holders (Mineral Exploration 
Webpage, 2010). 

A number of exploration permits are required prior to the commencement of 
exploration activities.  These include land surveys, well license applications, 
environmental and heritage approval, tree cutting, temporary work camp 
construction, drilling programs, road access, and fuel storage permits, among others 
(Mineral Exploration Webpage, 2010).

Encanto will pay the royalty required by MRL to the Crown under the Regulations 
and Leases as well as the Development Fee pursuant to the Development Fee 
Agreement.  Under the terms of the agreement, Encanto is required to pay to MRL a 
3% Gross Overriding Royalty.  The authors are unaware of any other royalties, back-
in rights, payments, or other agreements and encumbrances to which the property is 
subject, other than the work commitments, fees, and rentals as described in the 
preceding paragraphs.

The authors are unaware of any environmental liabilities to which the property is 
subject, other than the normal licensing and permitting requirements that must be 
made prior to undertaking certain operations and those environmental restrictions as 
set forth in Provincial Acts and Regulations.

Best efforts to avoid adverse environmental effects and maintain the original state of 
the land should be carried out by Encanto, by taking reasonable measures to reduce 
the environmental 'footprint' from the construction and operation of the project.

In 2010, Encanto formed a formal Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) with the 
Muskowekwan First Nations and MRL, the purpose of which is to progressively 
develop plans to establish a potash resource on the Muskowekwan First Nations' 
land.  As their contribution to the JVA, Encanto agreed to construct and operate the 
project and pay all monies, as well as assume the responsibilities of obligations and 
liabilities in connection with the study.  Pursuant to Encanto's agreement, they are 
entitled to receive all benefits and revenues of the JVA.  MRL will receive shares as 
well as royalty payments upon production, while the Muskowekwan First Nations will 
receive milestone payments.  Community involvement including training and job 
placement will be provided by Encanto.  The JVA between Encanto and the 
Muskowekwan First Nations follows a unique set of provisions and regulations for 
surface and subsurface access.  Encanto, the Muskowekwan First Nations and MRL 
with the involvement of the Crown have entered into an Exploration Participation 
Agreement supported by a Band Council Resolution and an Exploration Participation 
Agreement both dated July 31, 2009.  MRL has been granted the right to explore and 
develop potash resources within the designated lands under the Indian Mining 
Regulations of Canada.

The Muskowekwan First Nation is located 17-27-15 W2, about 40 km east of 
Highway 6 and 4 km south of Highway 15, between the towns of Lestock and 
Punnichy.  No other towns or villages are located within the bounds of the Project 
Area.  The entire Permit is accessible by a network of "grid" section gravel and paved 
roads, including a major paved highway.  Highway 15 connects to Melville in the east 
and Highway 6 in the west, which runs south to the major urban center of Regina.  
Highway 15 is bounding the northern portion of the Project Area.  Both paved and 
gravel road access is available through the Project Area, in part due to the 
inhabitation of the land by a combination of mixed farms.  An abandoned Canadian 
Pacific Railway line crosses through the reserve nearly paralleling Highway 15 
through Lestock and Punnichy. 

Major populated Saskatchewan urban centers, including Regina, Melville, and 
Yorkton, and the surrounding rural communities such as Raymore, Wynyard and Fort 
Qu'Appelle may offer skilled professional, technical, and trades persons for project 
construction and operation.  Saskatchewan is experiencing strong economic growth 
in both the construction and mining industries and this may result in a shortage of 
experienced and skilled trades and technical personnel.  The Saskatchewan Mining 
Association predicts that an additional 18,000 workers will be required over the next 
ten years (Saskatchewan Mining Association, 2010).  Encanto has stated that they 
are committed to providing jobs to qualified Muskowekwan persons, whenever 
possible, throughout the duration of the project.  These positions include 
management and supervisory positions.  Encanto is dedicated to the hiring and 
training of the Muskowekwan First Nations personnel.  Qualified Muskowekwan 
businesses will also be given preference to act as suppliers for goods and services 
that may be required throughout the projects duration.

The climate in the Lestock area is typical of the Saskatchewan prairies.  It consists of 
a winter period (November to March) of snow and temperatures below zero degrees 
Celsius.  The spring (April to May) and fall (September to October) are cooler, with 
greater rates of precipitation, either in the form of snow or rain.  The summer period 
(June to August) is typically warm and dry, with a low average rate of precipitation.  
The seasonal climate can play a role in accessibility, particularly in the spring and

fall, when freezing and thawing ground conditions prevents mobilization of heavy 
equipment into the area.  Spring road restrictions are issued by the Saskatchewan 
Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure typically beginning the first three weeks in 
March, dependent on the weather, and can last up to six weeks.  Heavy equipment 
normally does not move during this time.  Access during the winter and summer 
months is largely restricted only by local weather, such as precipitation and 
environmentally sensitive ground conditions.

The following resource constraints have been identified: 

Fresh Water Supply:  Dependent on the type of mining decided upon, water 
requirements will range from 2 to 8 Mm3/year.  In solution mining, much of the water 
can be poor quality or even "brackish".  The source of water has not been 
determined and requires additional investigations.  A capital allowance of $200 
million has been included in the capital expenditure (CAPEX) for water supply.  In the 
case that local aquifer water can be used, capital expenditure may be reduced. 

Electrical Supply Power:  Generally available in the area through SaskPower 
facilities.  Utility work and power lines to substation(s) will be negotiated by Encanto.   

Natural Gas Supply:  As with the electrical power supply, natural gas does not 
appear to be an issue, but details during the pre-feasibility stage would have to be 
worked out with TransGas Limited (TransGas). 

Railways:  Canadian National Railway (CN Rail) has rail lines crossing the area.  
There is a railroad track running westward from Lestock.  Details of costs for

installation of rail line to the project site would be worked out with the rail line 
company during the pre-feasibility stage. 

Manpower:  With the strong economy of Saskatchewan, skilled trades people and 
technical personnel are becoming less abundant.  It is understood that Encanto is 
intending to use local resources as much as possible  At present, it is felt that the 
manpower supply could be found in the surrounding areas but that could change 
quickly and may require additional costs to attract and train the workforce.  These 
costs have not been included in the estimate.  Since the solution mine option 
involves skilled underground mining skill sets and requires less overall manpower, 
this option will be less costly to train and staff.

The property is characterized by gently rolling grassland with local poplar bluffs (see 
Figure 5.1).  Some of the land is unbroken grassland and is used as pasture or 
grazing land for livestock.  There are a number of small swamps and low lying 
wetland areas that play host to a number of wildlife species.  The elevation of the 
area is variable, but generally sits at a mean elevation of 673.0 m above sea level.

The author is not aware of any previous exploration work done on the Project Area.  
Chief Bellerose of the Muskowekwan First Nation stated "For on-reserve mineral 
development there's no template."  Encanto has stated that they believe that this 
project will pave the way for First Nation partnerships and the method in which First 
Nations land may be used for future development of potash in Saskatchewan.

The Saskatchewan Industry and Resources regional subsurface stratigraphic 
correlation chart is shown in Figure 7.1.  Modified excerpts from Halabura et al. 
(2005) and Halabura and Hardy (2007) can be found below.  The subsurface 
stratigraphic column of Saskatchewan's Phanerozoic cover may be subdivided into 
three broad geologic intervals (depths are based on the examination of wells from 
within the project area): 

1. An uppermost overburden sequence comprised of Cenozoic glacial tills, 
gravels, and clays.  This sequence extends from surface to depths of 
approximately 150.0 to 200.0 m and contains fresh water aquifers; 

2. A medial sequence of Mesozoic shales, siltstones, and sandstones 
containing limited aquifers of brackish water extending from the base of the 
glacial sediments to an approximate depth of 650.0 m to 685.0 m; and 

3. A lowermost package of Paleozoic strata which extends from the 
Paleozoic/Mesozoic Unconformity to more than 2,000.0 m below surface and 
is comprised predominantly of thick successions of carbonate and evaporite 
rocks punctuated by shales and sandstones. 

The above listed sedimentary packages comprise the Phanerozoic stratigraphic 
sequence in Saskatchewan and are underlain by Precambrian aged rocks. 

Saskatchewan potash resources occur within Middle Devonian Elk Point Group 
strata as relatively flat-lying and laterally extensive bedded deposits comprised of 
halite, sylvite, and local carnallite.  The Elk Point Group was deposited within a wide 
intracratonic depositional corridor known as the "Elk Point Seaway", which extends 
from its southern extremities in North Dakota and northeastern Montana up through 
southern and central Saskatchewan into northeastern Alberta.  The potash deposits 
are found at surface outcroppings in northwestern Manitoba and can be traced down 
the regional dip to subsurface depths of up to 2,750.0 m in southern Saskatchewan. 

The deposits occur within the uppermost strata of a relatively thick evaporite 
succession known as the "Prairie Evaporite Formation."  The Prairie Evaporite 
Formation is present within the lowermost Phanerozoic sequence and reaches 
thicknesses of up to 200.0 m within the study area.  The Prairie Evaporite Formation 
is bound at its top by locally disconformable Middle Devonian Dawson Bay Formation

carbonate deposits and bound unconformably at its base by Silurian to Middle 
Devonian (Givetian) carbonate deposits.  The basal depositional contact is marked 
by a sharp transition from Prairie Evaporite halite to an assortment of Winnipegosis 
Formation dolostones, limestones, and anhydrite interbeds.

The Winnipegosis Formation forms broad, flat-lying regional basin and platform 
carbonate deposits locally occupied by limestone and dolomite "reef" systems.  The 
"Second Red Beds" consisting of shale and locally silty regolith, mark the upper 
contact of the Prairie Evaporite with the overlying Dawson Bay Formation. 

According to Fuzesy (1982), three evaporitic sequences occurred during the Middle 
Devonian in Saskatchewan.  The first is marked by the Elk Point Group and consists 
of the Ashern, Winnipegosis, and Prairie Evaporite Formations; the second by the 
Dawson Bay Formation; and the third by the Souris River Formation.  Together, the 
Dawson Bay Formation and the Souris River Formation comprise the "Manitoba 
Group" which directly overlies the Elk Point Group.  Two halite beds are incorporated 
into the Manitoba Group: 

1. The "Hubbard Salt," present as the uppermost bed in the Dawson Bay 
Formation; and  

2. The "Davidson Evaporite" composed of two halite beds separated by 
anhydrite occurring within the lower Souris River Formation. 

These halite beds are important from a mining viewpoint as they provide an aquitard 
or a physical barrier between the Prairie Evaporite and potential water and brine 
aquifers common in the overlying Mesozoic sands. 

Dissolution and removal of the Hubbard and Davidson halite beds is considered an 
indication of potential difficulties for conventional room and pillar mining methods as 
formation fluids capable of halite dissolution were at one time present and may have 
potentially infiltrated the mining horizons.  Dissolution of any salt in the stratigraphic 
column highlights the possibility of a higher risk for inflow problems in underground 
conventional systems; therefore, such areas are commonly avoided by current 
potash mine operators in Saskatchewan.  Regarding solution mining scenarios, the 
absence of these halite beds is often considered irrelevant other than in the 
identification of possible dissolution zones (Earl Gebhardt, personal experience).  
During exploration, drill stem tests (DSTs) are frequently used to help identify 
aquifers and problematic areas directly overlying the Prairie Evaporite by testing for 
formation fluids and pressures. 

Figure 7.2 shows a regional cross section of the Prairie Evaporite Formation and its 
potash-bearing Members in Saskatchewan, with the stratigraphic nomenclature 
taken from Holter (1969).  A map indicating the position of the Project Area in relation 
to the section is also included in Figure 7.2.  The figure demonstrates that the 
consistent correlation of the potash-bearing Members is possible over hundreds of 
kilometres across the province from Saskatoon to just north of the Project Area and 
into southeastern Saskatchewan. 

The Prairie Evaporite Formation is divided into a lowermost "Lower Prairie 
Sequence" and an overlying "Upper Prairie Sequence" unit containing three potash-
bearing Members and several "marker beds".  In ascending stratigraphic order they

are; the Esterhazy Member, the White Bear Marker Beds, the Belle Plaine Member, 
and the Patience Lake Member.  These beds are generally flat lying and are formed 
of interbedded sylvite, halite, carnallite, clays, and minor amounts of anhydrite.

The detailed stratigraphy of the Project Area is summarized in Figure 7.5.  The figure 
shows the local geological marker beds as identified by the geophysical well logs and 
drill cuttings taken from the 2009 and 2010 exploration programs.   

The three major potash-bearing members are present in the Project Area and are, in 
ascending stratigraphic order, the Esterhazy, Belle Plaine, and the Patience Lake 
Members.  These Members occur as discreet stratiform evaporite deposits in the 
uppermost Prairie Evaporite Formation and are comprised of halite, sylvite, and 
carnallite of variable mineral proportions and crystal size.  Between each Member 
are sequences of bedded salts comprised predominantly of halite and clay.  A thin 
distinct package of bedded clay, halite, and sylvinite termed the Whitebear Marker 
Bed is absent in the Project Area, but is normally situated between the Esterhazy 
and Belle Plaine Members.  

Figure 7.6 is a detailed correlation of the Prairie Evaporite Formation lithology to 
geophysical wireline log signatures as present in Encanto Lestock well 15-16-027-
15W2.  The Member tops were chosen using the gamma ray, neutron porosity and 
density porosity wireline log signatures.  The tops as depicted in Figure 7.6 are 
consistent lithology picks throughout the Project Area. 

The following is a summary of the key stratigraphic boundaries determined for the 
Project Area.  Quoted depths are specific to the Project Area and are identified from 
the well log signatures of the five project wells: 

1. Patience Lake Member –  The uppermost potash bearing Member within the 
Prairie Evaporite Formation, the Patience Lake Member is conventionally 
mined in the Saskatoon area.  The Member is subdivided into the Upper 
Patience Lake and Lower Patience Lake Potash Sub-members and is 
separated by a thin barren medial interbed halite.    

The upper boundary of the Patience Lake Member is marked by the 
presence of the first sylvinite bed as indicated from the drill core and 
interpreted wireline.  The salt back, comprised predominantly of halite and 
interstitial clay and occurring between the base of the Second Red Beds and 
the top of the Upper Patience Lake Sub-member, ranges from 0.0 m to 3.18 
m.  The base of the Patience Lake Member is placed at the bottom of the last 
occurring sylvinitic bed, but is often chosen at the base of a commonly 
present clay seam.  It was chosen slightly differently within the Project Area, 
as sylvinite was still present below this clay seam.  

The depth to the top of the Patience Lake Member ranges between 1,177.0 
m to 1,191.0 m in the eastern portion of the Project Area and increases to 
1,213.0 m in the west.  The Patience Lake Member averages 7.16 m in 
vertical thickness, with the Upper Patience Lake averaging 3.83 m and the 
Lower Patience Lake averaging 3.30 m in thickness.  Including the 0.57 m to 
1.38 m thick medial salt between the Upper and Lower intervals, the Patience 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 33 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

Lake Member is thickest in the west; up to 8.96 m in 15-16-027-15W2 and 
thins to the southeast to 3.75 m in 07-02-027-15W2.   

2. Belle Plaine Member –  Stratigraphically underlies the Patience Lake 
Member and is present in all five wells drilled in the Project Area.  The Belle 
Plaine Member is currently solution mined at the Mosaic Belle Plaine Potash 
Mine west of Regina.  The upper boundary of the Member is picked at the top 
of a thin clay-rich bed present between the overlying barren halite interbed 
and the underlying Belle Plaine sylvinite beds.  The lowermost sylvinite bed 
marks the base of the Belle Plaine Member, which typically has a persistent 
clay bed, separating the Belle Plaine Member from the underlying barren 
halite interbed.  Similar to the Patience Lake Member, the Belle Plaine can 
be subdivided into Upper and Lower Potash Sub-Members divided by a bed 
of low-grade clay-rich sylvinite. 

The depth to the top of the Belle Plaine Member ranges from 1,190.0 m in 
the east to 1,228.0 m in the west, exhibiting a fairly uniform thickness across 
the property averaging 8.4  m.  The Upper Sub-member averages a 
thickness of 5.17 m and the Lower Sub-Member averages a thickness of 
1.30 m. 

The Belle Plaine Member contains relatively less clay insolubles than the 
Patience Lake Member.  Insolubles in the Upper Belle Plaine Sub-Member 
average 5.79% and average 1.72% in the Lower Belle Plaine Sub-member.  

Sylvite crystals are generally cloudy white and subhedral in form, ranging 
from <5.0 mm to 15.0 mm and locally up to 30.0 mm in diameter.  Halite 
crystals also range from <5.0 mm to 15.0 mm in diameter locally exceeding 
30.0 mm.  Carnallite is generally trace to locally minor with an average 
calculated equivalent assay grade of 0.60% (0.21% MgCl2). 

3. Esterhazy Member- The lowermost stratigraphic potash-bearing member is 
present in all five wells drilled in the Project Area.  It is separated from the 
Lower Belle Plain Sub-member by a relatively thick sequence of barren 
interbed salt averaging 23.58 m.  The Esterhazy Member is conventionally 
mined at the Mosaic Esterhazy and Potash Corp. Rocanville mines, as well 
as solution mined at Mosaic's Belle Plaine mine. 

The upper boundary of the Esterhazy is placed at the top of the first sylvinite bed and 
the lower boundary at the base of the lowermost sylvinite bed.  In both cases the 
boundaries are relatively sharp with an abrupt change in crystal size and sylvite 
mineralization.

Figure 7.7 shows the local thickness for the Upper Patience Lake sub-member as a 
structure map exhibiting the apparent southeastward thinning of the sub-member, 
interpreted as an effect of post-depositional erosion.  From the collected seismic 
data, RPS Boyd Petrosearch has identified a "salt edge" related to a large collapse or 
dissolution feature to the south-east of the project area. 

The Upper Patience Lake sub-member is completely eroded away in well 07-02-027-
15W2 and partially eroded in well 02-09-27-15W2.  The Lower Patience Lake sub-
member was encountered in all holes drilled.  

Mineralogically the Patience Lake Member is recognized for its clay-rich character, 
with several laterally extensive interbedded clay seams and zones of high interstitial 
insolubles.  Assay results within the Project Area indicate an average insoluble 
content 9.34%.  Sylvite crystals are generally cloudy white and subhedral in form, 
ranging in diameter from <5.0 mm to 10.0 mm and locally reaching up to 29.0 mm.  
Oxidized reddish-orange insolubles commonly rim the sylvite crystals.  Halite crystals 
also range from <5.0 mm to 10.0 mm, reaching a maximum diameter of 22.0 mm.  
Halite crystals are typically subhedral and vary in color from white, to pale orange, to 
moderate brown.  Carnallite is generally found in trace amounts with the average 
equivalent content of 0.46% (0.16% MgCl2). 

The depth to the top of the Esterhazy Member ranges from 1,231.0 m in the east to 
1,262.0 m in the west, averaging 8.20 m in vertical thickness.  Sylvite crystals are 
cloudy white and subhedral in crystal form, and coarser grained than the overlying 
members.  Sylvite crystals range in diameter from 5.0 mm to 20.0 mm on average, to 
41.0 mm locally.  Halite crystals also range in diameter from 5.0 mm to 20.0 mm on 
average, locally exceeding 40.0 mm in size.  In general, throughout the five wells 
drilled in the Project Area, sylvinite beds within the Esterhazy are of substantially 
lower grade than those of the Patience Lake and Belle Plaine Members.  The 
Esterhazy Member in the Project Area is considered carnallitic with carnallite 
occurring as reddish-orange amorphous interstitial masses and stringers surrounding 
the sylvite/halite groundmass.  Carnallite averages a calculated equivalent grade 
content of 7.57% (2.59% MgCl2). 

Table 7-1 shows the geological intervals of the five wells drilled and the 
corresponding K2O grade, total carnallite and insoluble percentages.

The structural and stratigraphic relations of the Prairie Evaporite Formation shown on 
section A-A' illustrate the regional southwest dip of the potash-bearing members.  
Towards the east, the upper potash beds of the Patience Lake Member are gradually 
truncated along a disconformable surface with the Upper Patience Lake Sub-
member absent in well 07-02-027-15W2.  This observation is consistent with Fuzesy 
(1982) who noted bevelling of potash beds by pre-Dawson Bay erosion, particularly 
within the Patience Lake Member. 

The uppermost Member of the Dawson Bay Formation, the Hubbard Evaporite, is 
present in all five wells.  The Hubbard Evaporite is comprised of an upper halite unit 
overlying a basal argillaceous anhydrite.  In general, the Hubbard Evaporite thins 
westward across the Project Area, pinching out west of 11-18-027-15W2 such that 
only the basal argillaceous anhydrite of the Hubbard Evaporite is preserved in 15-14-
027-16W2.

A disturbance that affects the normal characteristics of the potash-bearing beds of 
the Prairie Evaporite Formation is considered to be an "anomaly" and thereby 
represents an area which is generally not suitable for mining.  Potash Members of 
the Prairie Evaporite Formation can be affected by three general types of anomalies: 

 Washout anomaly; 

 Leach Anomaly; and 

 Dissolution or collapse anomaly 

Modified excerpts from Halabura et al. (2005) describing these anomalies are found 
below.  These anomalies range from localized features less than a square kilometer 
in extent to regional disturbances affecting several square kilometers.  Figure 7.9, 
taken from Halabura and Hardy (2007), illustrates the three types of disturbances 
known to create anomalous zones within the main sylvinite-bearing beds in 
Saskatchewan

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

A "washout anomaly" occurs where the sylvinite bed has been replaced or altered to 
a halite mass that consists of medium to large (0.5 to 1.0 cm) euhedral to subhedral 
halite crystals within a groundmass of smaller intermixed halite and clay insolubles.  
Clay intraclasts up to 1.0 cm long may be present, typically with a concentration of 
clay at the top and base of the altered zone.  This type of disturbance is interpreted 
to be penecontemporaneous (i.e. occurring at the same time as deposition of the 
primary sylvinite, or shortly thereafter) and are thus local in nature.  An example is 
provided by Mackintosh & McVittie (1983) who describes these disturbances as 
"…salt-filled V- or U-shaped structures which transect the normal bedded sequence 
and obliterate the stratigraphy." 

A "leach anomaly" occurs where the sylvinite bed has been altered such that the 
sylvite mineral has been removed and replaced by euhedral to subhedral halite.  
Such anomalies are also colloquially termed "salt horses" or "salt horsts" by mine 
operators.  If the altered zone crosses any stratigraphic boundaries, these 
boundaries are commonly unaltered.  Workers in the field interpret this type of 
disturbance as being post-depositional (i.e. after deposition of the primary sylvinite).  
These anomalies are commonly associated with underlying Winnipegosis reefs, 
suggesting that the reefs may have some formative influence upon the anomaly, as 
described by Mackintosh and McVittie (1983).  At Agrium Inc.'s Vanscoy potash mine 
southwest of Saskatoon, workers describe such a disturbance as the "partial or 
complete absence of sylvite in what is otherwise a normal, continuous stratigraphic 
sequence.  Thinning is proportional to sylvite deficiency."  Mackintosh describes 
these anomalies as being local in extent in that "they range in diameter from a few 
meters to as much as 400.0 m, but a few are linear, being up to 20.0 m wide and 
greater than 1,600.0 m long." 

The third type of anomaly is a "dissolution and collapse anomaly" formed where the 
Prairie Evaporite has been removed by dissolution of salt and the resulting void is in-
filled by material caved from above.  This type of disturbance may be local (i.e. less 
than a square kilometer) or it may be regional (i.e. extending over a number of 
square kilometers) and may affect the entire thickness of the Prairie Evaporite 
Formation.  An example of an unusual and severe case of this type of anomaly was 
encountered at Potash Corp's Lanigan potash mining operation and is described in 
detail by Danyluk et al 1999.  The anomaly was encountered when a mining machine 
cut through a collapse anomaly and into down-dropped limestone blocks of the 
overlying Dawson Bay Formation. 

All three types of anomalies are commonly encountered in underground 
Saskatchewan potash deposits.  Such anomalies impact mining operations in the 
sense that the grade of the potash ore sent to the mill decreases as anomalous 
ground is encountered, or that a portion of the potash ore or halite is left in the 
ground as these areas are not mined conventionally for safety reasons.  Mining 
operations will abandon the anomalous ground and the safety pillar surrounding it.  
Generally, a combination of surface reflection seismic studies, both 2D and 3D, and 
careful examination of surface drill holes, underground ("in-seam") geophysics, and 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 43 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

geological observations of mining rooms is sufficient to identify potentially anomalous 
ground. 

An important aspect of estimating the potash potential of an area is to identify 
portions of the ground that may contain disturbances which affect the Prairie 
Evaporite Formation.  If a drill hole penetrates a disturbance, it may offer a vertical 
profile of an anomaly, but will not provide any information as to its lateral extent.  
Reflection seismic surveys offer the possibility to map the lateral extent of anomalies 
related to large-scale alteration of the Prairie Evaporite Formation.  The dissolution of 
the main mass of Prairie Evaporite with subsequent collapse of the overlying beds 
into the dissolution cavern may be captured in seismic; however, seismic may not 
necessarily define the lateral extent of more subtle anomalies such as washout or 
leach anomalies.  Seismic is able to detect various sized anomalies to a minimum of 
15.0 m on 2D seismic and 20.0 m on 3D seismic and may not accurately depict 
anomalies below that cutoff (Edgecombe, personal communication, 2011).  

Within the Project Area the 3D seismic, which was completed during 2009, identified 
anomalous features both within the Prairie Evaporite Formation and the overlaying 
Manitoba Group carbonates.  Seismic interpretations are provided by RPS Boyd 
Petroseach and are presented in Appendix B of the 2011 Encanto Technical Report 
(Stirrett & Gebhardt, 2011).  From the interpretations significant anomalous features 
have been identified and deducted from the Mineral Resource Calculation with the 
utilization of buffers to provide a safety factor, dependent upon the severity of the 
feature.  This process is described in more detail in Section 14.3. 

Further deductions to the Mineral Resource have been made for unknown anomalies 
such as steep dip angle, high carnallite, or low grade beds not detectable by seismic.  
These deductions are also described in more detail in Section 14.

7.5.1 PROPERTY MINERALIZATION 

Potash mineralization showing economic potential was identified from drill hole data 
within the Project Area and consists of two principle Sub-members: 

1. Lower Patience Lake Sub-member, and 

2. Upper Belle Plaine Sub-member. 

For the purposes of calculating Mineral Resource grade and tonnage, the top of the 
Lower Patience Lake Sub-member was placed at the top of the lowermost sylvinite 
bed of the Patience Lake Member, and the lower boundary was placed at the base of 
the same sylvinite bed.  The top of the Upper Belle Plaine Sub-member was placed 
at the top of the sylvinite-bearing horizon occurring approximately 6.0 m below the 
base of the Patience Lake Member.  The base of the Upper Belle Plaine Sub-
member was placed at the base of this same bed.  These Sub-members were 
identified by the authors based on data collected from geochemical assays, core 
descriptions, seismic studies, and wireline log interpretation.  The relationships 
between these Sub-members are shown on Figure 7.6 (Cross Section A – A'). 

7.5.2 FAVOURABLE CONVENTIONAL MIN ING CONDITIONS 

Favorable criteria for conventional mining present within the Lower Patience Lake 
and Upper Belle Plaine Sub-members in the Project Area includes: 

 The presence of the basal anhydrite of the Hubbard Evaporite in all but one 
well.  The Hubbard Evaporite is generally regarded as an effective water-
barrier formation in preventing communication between the Prairie Evaporite 
and overlying brackish aquifers, and ideally includes both a halite and an 
anhydrite component.  The Hubbard Halite is a desirable geological indicator 
as it suggests the absence of fresh water fluids which would be capable of 
dissolving the salts of the Prairie Evaporite Formation.  The Hubbard Halite is 
present in all but the westernmost well (15-14-027-16W2). 

 DST results (see appendix C-2 from (Stirrett & Gebhardt, 2011)) suggest the 
Dawson Bay Formation is tight in all wells except 11-18, which produced 135 
meters of formation fluid.  Additional DST work is deemed necessary to 
sufficiently evaluate the area for inflow potential. 

 The gentle dip of the Sub-members and their broad areal extent and 
mineralization continuity over the study area.  The interpretation of the 3D 
seismic data by Boyd PetroSearch suggests the Sub-member bedding 
disruption and anomalous collapse features are minimal and only affect 
approximately 17.0% of the Project Area.

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

 Sub-member thickness and consistency in K2O grade across the study area.  
K2O grades within the Lower Patience Lake Sub-member average 24.0% 
(38%) and within the Upper Belle Plaine Sub-member 22.0% (35%) over the 
mineralized interval. 

 The absence of carnallite throughout both target Sub-members and their 
respective salt backs and floor sequences.  Calculated equivalent carnallite 
grades average 0.55% (0.18% MgCl2) within the Lower Patience Lake Sub-
member.  Calculated equivalent carnallite grades average 0.60% (0.21% 
MgCl2) within the Upper Belle Plaine Sub-member.  Examination of assays 
and core suggests that the sylvite mineralization in each Sub-member is 
present essentially as one complete zone or "bed" with only thin interbeds of 
poorly mineralized sylvinite, barren halite, and marker clay seams. 

 The presence of a salt back equal to or greater than 7.0 m directly overlying 
the Lower Patience Lake Sub-member in the three northernmost wells.  Pre-
Dawson Bay Formation erosional activity appears to have reduced the 
thickness of the Lower Patience Lake salt back to 4.40 m and 0.73 m in wells 
02-09-027-15W2 and 07-02-027-15W2, respectively. 

 The presence of a salt back greater than 7.0 m directly overlying the Upper 
Belle Plaine Sub-member.

At this point it is not possible to determine a precise mining cut (i.e. whether all or 
some of the upper bounding "marker" clay seams must be removed).  For this 
reason, a "Geological Interval" was chosen to calculate the Mineral Resource and 
was selected based on clay seam stratigraphy and nomenclature outlined by Phillips 
(1982), where potash beds were assigned alphabetical labels and clay seams 
numerical values as shown below in Figure 7.8.  The "Geological Interval" is defined 
as those intervals which include the uppermost bounding "marker" clay seams and 
K2O values greater than 10% (16%).  The Lower Patience Lake Interval is picked 
between clay seams 406 at the top and at clay seam 401 at the base.  The Upper 
Belle Plaine is commonly bounded by clay seam 307 at the top and clay seam 303 at 
the base; however, if the K2O grade increased or decreased around the basal clay 
seam the interval was adjusted to accommodate the grade change.  The intervals 
were verified using wireline logs by selecting consistent inflection points identified on 
the gamma ray track.

the Selection of the Geological Interval (Phillips, October 9, 1982) 

 
 

7.5.3 FAVOURABLE SOLUTION MIN ING CONDIT IONS 

Halabura and Hardy (2007) describe the key features used to evaluate potential 
solution mining areas: 

 Thickness of mineralization to efficiently allow for the selective removal of the 
mineralized members; 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 48 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

 Grade of the potash bed will control the concentration of the product liquor 
(Halabura and Hardy, 2007) the rate of solution mining and the effectiveness 
of the secondary mining; 

 Depth to burial of the mineralized intervals will determine the formation 
temperature and higher temperatures increase the efficiency of the solution 
mining process; 

 Increased carnallite content will decrease the efficiency of the cavern 
dissolution and ultimately the potash recovery; 

 Presence of anomalies may reduce the thickness, grade and continuity of the 
mineralized zones; 

 Dip of the potash beds must be relatively low as increased dip may reduce 
the size of a cavern and therefore the resource recovery; and 

 Presence of clay layers in the immediate roof can lead to premature failure of 
the roof and can limit the size of the cavern. 

Based on the above described solution mining criteria, a 'solution interval' is defined 
in the Project Area as the entire Patience Lake Member, the salt interbed and the 
entire Belle Plaine Member.  It includes all barren interbed salt as well as insoluble 
rich layers.  An 'economic cutoff grade' for the roof and floor picks was assumed to 
be where K2O values were greater than 10.0% (16%) and where average 'mineable 
grade' was greater than 15.0% (24%) (Hardy, Halabura, & Shewfelt, 2010).  The 
Esterhazy Member was not included in the calculation as it has an average 
equivalent carnallite content of 7.57% (2.59% MgCl2) and the grade was lower than 
the economic threshold cutoff.  

The potash thicknesses, grades and carnallite content for the two members and the 
interbed salt are shown in Table 7-3.  

The borehole temperature in the Project Area is the temperature recorded by the 
wireline tools in the geological formations during the logging operation.  The bottom 
hole temperature is the deepest temperature reading collected by the wireline tool, 
typically near the bottom of the borehole.  This bottom hole temperature (BHT) 
ranges between 33° and 38° Celsius in the Project Area.  Weatherford, the company 
who conducted the wireline survey, has stated that the accuracy of the temperature 
reading from the wireline tools is ±2° Celsius.  The BHT readings may also be lower 
due to cooler drilling mud being circulated into the well and the temperature may not 
have had time to stabilize by the time the reading was taken.

7 .5.4 CARNALITE DISTRIBUTION 

Examination of drill core and the geochemical assays for the five wells completed 
during the 2009-2010 potash exploration programs shows that carnallite 
mineralization is essentially restricted to the Esterhazy Member and its immediate 
underlying halite interbeds.  Carnallite mineralization may persist up to 10.0 m past 
the base of the Esterhazy into the underlying halite.  Throughout the Esterhazy, 
carnallite mineralization occurs as interstitial reddish-orange amorphous crystal 
masses commonly rimming sylvinite.  Above the Esterhazy Member the total average 
carnallite grade, as calculated from drill core assays, is less than 1.0% equivalent 
carnallite over the Upper Patience Lake, Lower Patience Lake, and Upper Belle 
Plaine Sub-Members.  The summarized assay results for each well are shown in 
Appendix C-1 of the 2011 Encanto Technical Report (Stirrett & Gebhardt, 2011), 
which presents the tabulated weighted average for carnallite over each potash Sub-
member.

The following statement by Phillips (2003) summarizes the requirements when 
defining a potash resource in Saskatchewan; "the potash deposits that are located in 
Saskatchewan, Canada are characterized by their remarkable consistency of grade 
and thickness over many tens of kilometers.  It is therefore possible to characterize a 
deposit with a relatively few drill holes, supplemented by sufficient seismic coverage 
to establish continuity between holes." 

The seismic survey results confirmed the presence of the Prairie Evaporite 
Sequence on the property.  For potash to be exploited there are several conditions 
other than grade that have to be met such as: 

 For conventional mines a thick salt back is required and it is defined as the 
predominantly halite rich beds of salt that are found above a potash-bearing 
unit.  A salt back of over seven meters is desirable depending on the quality 
and competency of the bedded salts and the clay content and distribution. 

 Low carnallite.  If the carnallite content of the ore is over 2-3% it can present 
problems for mining and ore processing.  Carnallite is deliquescent meaning 
that it absorbs moisture from the surrounding air and can then release the 
water into the surrounding area as it is exposed.  Carnallite is processed in 
many deposits around the world but requires different mining (solution 
mining) and processing methods than conventional potash techniques used 
in Saskatchewan. 

 For conventional mines clay or insolubles content below 7 or 8% is required 
because they represent hazards to the mining if found in flat, thick layers that 
could contribute to planes of weakness and lead to roof collapse during 
mining and can also interfere with processing of the ore in the mill.

 Continuity of the potash members with few or no disruptions to the 
stratigraphy are essential since mechanized continuous mining methods are 
used in potash mines and selective mining or mining small areas is not ideal. 

Core from hole 16-23-17-04 was inspected by John D. Cairns, P.Eng. and Gordon D. 
Phillips, P.Eng. of Tetra Tech Engineering Inc. (Tetra Tech) accompanied by 
Ms.Tabetha Stirrett, P.Geo. of North Rim at the North Rim Core Lab facility in 
Saskatoon on Monday, May 30, 2011.  The core as observed did not cause concern 
relating to potash or clay content and there was nothing to indicate the likelihood of 
mining difficulties.

Elemental potassium (K) is relatively abundant in crustal occurrence, comprising 
approximately 2.58% of the Earth's crust, and is one of the most common rock-
forming elements.  It is most commonly incorporated into the atomic structure of 
relatively strongly-bound silicate minerals such as feldspars and micas and is difficult 
to extract with economically viable large-scale metallurgical methods.  Potash is 
desirable as a source for potassium as the potassium cation is much more easily 
liberated from the crystal lattice of the water-soluble halide mineral, sylvite (KCl). 

Potash ore has historically been used in the manufacturing of many industrial and 
commercial products including soaps, glass, and textiles.  The most common use for 
potash, however, is as a primary ingredient in the production of crop fertilizers.  
Modified excerpts from Halabura and Hardy (2007) have been incorporated into this 
section and can be found below. 

The term "potash" is a colloquial term that is contraction of "muriate of potash" which 
is expressed by the chemical formula "KCI" or "potassium choloride".  The terms 
"muriate of potash" and the formula KCI are commonly used in the Saskatchewan 
potash industry to refer to the sales product resulting from the mining and milling of 
form of potassium choloide, (KCI), which is the most common source of potassium in 
Saskatchewan potash mining.  The product mined and sold is potassium choloirde, 
KCI.  One tonne of chemically pure KCI contains an equivelant of 0.63 tonnes of K2O 
which permits compairison of the nutrien levels in various forms of potash such as 
potassium sulphate and carnallite.  K2O is the highly reacitve compound used to 
assay the percent compostion of postash in ore fertilizer.  

In this report, the term "sylvinite" is used to describe the mineralogical character of a 
potash-bearing rock, that is, the rock is predominantly comprised of the minerals 
sylvite and halite (NaCl).  The sylvinite may also contain variable concentrations of 
"impurities" such as anhydrite and dolomite crystals and clay minerals that are 
collectively identified in chemical assay reports as "water insolubles."  Other 
substances regarded as "impurities" that are commonly found in sylvinite include the 
magnesium-bearing minerals carnallite (KMgCl3•6H2O) and kieserite (MgSO4•H2O).  
The presence of magnesium (Mg) is unfavorable in conventional floatation potash 
plants as concentrations over 0.25% Mg can have a negative impact on plant 
performance as additional non-standard processing is required for its removal.  
Carnallite is particularly unfavorable in conventional underground mine workings due 
to its highly deliquescent nature, which in high concentrations can pose risks to mine 
integrity.  The potash industry threshold for magnesium in a solution mining scenario 
is 0.25% Mg, or 2.91% carnallite (1% MgCl2).  Currently, Saskatchewan processing 
plants can handle up to 0.51% Mg, or 5.84% carnallite (2% MgCl2), in the mill feed.  



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 53 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

Conventional mines operating in Saskatchewan will avoid areas that have higher 
than 10.0% carnallite (3.43% MgCl2) due to mining instability issues. 

Chemical assay records report the Mg concentration as weight percent (wt. %) 
magnesium oxide (MgO).  "Carnallite" is a calculated equivalent value based on the 
present MgO content rather than a direct laboratory chemical analysis.  As the 
amount of soluble Mg present in a Saskatchewan potash sample is directly attributed 
to its original mineralogical character (i.e. carnallite concentration), one can calculate 
the equivalent carnallite content as 6.8943 times the MgO content.  This calculation 
factor is derived by comparison of the molar mass for each compound.  Likewise the 
equivalent magnesium chloride (MgCl2) content can be described as 2.3623 times 
the MgO content.  Throughout this report the magnesium content is reported both as 
equivalent carnallite (KMgCl3•6H2O) and equivalent magnesium chloride (MgCl2). 

The geology of the potash-bearing beds of the Middle Devonian Prairie Evaporite 
Formation has been well documented (Fuzesy, 1982 and Holter, 1969).  The 
following commentary is derived in large part from both above mentioned sources as 
well as the observations and research of the authors.  Overall, the potash-bearing 
evaporite beds of the Elk Point Group are bedded sedimentary rocks, deposited 
within the Middle Devonian Elk Point Seaway.  According to Phillips (1982) these 
beds are remarkably consistent and laterally extensive across Saskatchewan and 
portions of Manitoba, North Dakota, and northeast Montana with individual clay beds 
and sylvinite-bearing intervals correlatable over great distances. 

The lateral continuity and expansive nature of these mineralized sub-members as 
well as the correlatable nature of the sylvite bearing horizons results in highly 
mechanized conventional underground mining operations.  In areas suitable for 
solution mining, boreholes drilled to establish a mining cavern can be moved 
laterally, should the grade or thickness encountered within the borehole be deemed 
insufficient for mining purposes.  It is not recommended that conventional mining and 
solution mining be conducted in the same areas concurrently due to the potential for 
the introduction of hazardous conditions to the underground mine.

No potash has been previously produced on the Project Area.  Encanto, in 
conjunction with the Muskowekwan First Nations, is drilling exploration wells and 
carrying out seismic studies over the Project Area as an exploratory strategy. 

Exploration activities were initiated in 2009 following the agreement between the 
Muskowekwan First Nation and Encanto Potash Corp.  Table 9.1 summarizes the 
Exploration Programs for 2009 and 2010, including the drilling program which will be 
discussed in further detail in Section 10.

A 2D seismic program was conducted in 2009 by Kinetix Corporation of Calgary, 
Alberta between April and June.  It covered the Muskowekwan First Nations Project 
Area and extended north into the Daystar First Nations property.  The program was 
designed as a tool for regional evaluation of geological structures including faults and 
Winnipegosis carbonate mounds, but focused on salt dissolution features to 
determine the potential for laterally continuous potash mineralization sufficient to 
potentially support a mining operation.  The seismic was tied to two deep historical 
wells in the area.  These two wells were Canadian Reserve Punnichy 6-13-28-17W2 
(1968) and Atlantic Raymore 16-6-29-15W2 (1966).  Considering only the structure 
of the Prairie Evaporite Formation, a brief interpretation of the seismic was 
conducted, which led to the drilling of the Lestock well 02-09-27-15W2.  Based on 
the results from 02-09-27-15W2 and the favorable geological structure of the area, a 
3D seismic program was completed to examine the geological continuity in the area.  

North Rim was not involved in the supervision of the coring or core retrieval of well 
02-09-027-15W2, nor did they have any input in the 2009 seismic program.

RPS Boyd PetroSearch of Calgary, Alberta was contracted by Encanto to interpret 
the results of the 2009 2D and 2010 3D seismic survey.  2D and 3D seismic surveys 
are highly effective subsurface analytical tools for potash exploration used in the 
identification and estimation of the degree of salt loss, salt dissolution-induced 
collapse structures, and the identification of other geological elements.  The results 
of the 2D and 3D surveys were used in the design of drill holes to avoid potentially 
anomalous ground.

The following discussion is based on RPS Boyd PetroSearch's report entitled, 
"Encanto Potash Corp. 2010 Muskowekwan 3D Final Depth Interpretation".  Prior to 
the commencement of the 2010 drilling program, the 3D seismic was reviewed for 
evidence of geological anomalies that could potentially affect potash mineralization 
within the Prairie Evaporite Formation.   

Figure 9.1, modified from RPS Boyd Petrosearch's 2010 Muskowekwan 3D report 
illustrates the Second Red Bed structure map.  This map suggests that the 
subsurface to the top of the Second Red Beds is, in general, relatively free of any 
high amplitude undulating disconformities and indicates a relatively continuous and 
uniform Prairie Evaporite Formation.  A large linear salt-dissolution or collapse 
feature is identified in the southeastern portion of the survey, however, and appears 
to greatly affect the overlying sedimentary packages. 

Figure 9-2 illustrates the anomalous areas identified by the 3D survey.  These 
anomalies are subdivided into: 

1. Class 1, 2 and 3 collapses; 

2. Potential disturbances in the Devonian carbonates directly overlaying the 
Prairie Evaporite (Illustrated as Souris River Anomaly); and 

3. Probable carnallite zones. 

Furthermore: 

 Class 1 collapses show a high degree of salt removal within the Upper Prairie 
Evaporite Formation and exhibit vertically extensive compensatory down-
warping of the overlying strata.  The seismic shows that Class 1 collapses 
extend up into the Paleozoic strata, suggesting extensive fracturing of the 
Dawson Bay Formation. 

 Class 2 collapses show a moderate amount of salt loss.  The Class 2 
collapses show a break in the Second Red Beds and indications of fracturing 
within the Dawson Bay Formation.

 Class 3 collapses show a low degree of salt loss, a break in the Second Red 
Beds, and may have minor associated fracturing of the Dawson Bay 
Formation.   

 Class 4 collapses do not show any salt loss and little disturbance of the 
sedimentary strata overlying the Prairie Evaporite Formation.  Class 4 
collapses do not effect resource estimates and are not considered further in 
this report.

One hole, 02-09-27-15W2, was drilled on the Muskowekwan First Nation Home 
Reservation between November and December 2009.  Barlon Engineering of 
Calgary, Alberta, was contracted to provide overall drilling management and 
supervision of the drill hole.  North Rim did not provide onsite supervision or onsite 
technical assistance for 02-09-27-15W2. 

The 2009 drill hole location was identified from seismic interpretation and selected 
based on the following parameters: 

 The presence of laterally continuous potash-bearing strata; and 

 The absence of subsurface collapse structures and salt dissolution features.

Coring and core retrieval was completed by Baker Hughes of Calgary, Alberta.  
Coring was completed from the top of the Dawson Bay Second Red Bed Member 
through to the Lower Salt of the Prairie Evaporite Formation and the systematic 
retrieval of core was carried out.  Ross Moulton of Encanto commented that a routine 
set of procedures were strictly followed to ensure that the in situ stratigraphic position 
of the core was maintained and to prevent loss of material.  Involved in the core 
retrieval process were several coring personnel, the drill supervisor, and the onsite 
geologist.  

The core was shipped to Core Laboratories Canada Inc. in Estevan, Saskatchewan 
where the core was analyzed by Total Gamma Ray Core Logger.  The gamma ray 
core logger matched in depth and sequence with the open hole wireline logs.  In 
December of 2009, Encanto commissioned North Rim to take possession of and 
process the 02-09-27-15W2 core.  The core was shipped to North Rim's core facility 
located at 2834 Millar Avenue in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

The 2010 drilling program began in early October and concluded in mid-November 
and included the completion of four stratigraphic test holes:  

 Encanto Lestock 07-02-27-15W2; 

 Encanto Lestock 11-18-27-18W2;  

 Encanto Lestock 15-16-27-15W2; and  

 Encanto Punnichy 15-14-27-16W2.   

Barlon Engineering of Calgary, Alberta, was contracted to complete the program 
utilizing oilfield drilling equipment capable of drilling to depths beyond that of the 
Prairie Evaporite Formation.  A photograph of the drilling equipment is shown in 
Figure 10.1. 

The drill holes were designed to further evaluate the potash mineral potential of the 
Prairie Evaporite Formation on the Project Area and were spaced with consideration 
to specific mineral resource buffers.  All holes during the 2010 drilling program were 
vertical and drilled to penetrate the Prairie Evaporite Formation.  All holes were 
drillstem tested, and cores were collected through the potash-bearing zones.   

The objective of the drilling program was to define, within the Project Area, a 
geological dataset suitable for the development of a robust Mineral Resource.  Drill 
hole locations were selected upon the following parameters: 

 The presence of laterally continuous potash-bearing strata (avoiding 
anomalous ground); 

 Positive results arising from RPS Boyd PetroSearch's seismic interpretation 
and recommendations; 

 A drill hole spacing sufficient to allow for a representative evaluation of the 
Dawson Bay Formation; 

 A strategic plan incorporating the future acquisition of lands to the north of 
the Project Area; and 

 The availability of drill hole data suitable for the documentation of an NI 43-
101 compliant potash Mineral Resource.

Coring and core retrieval was completed by Blackie's Coring Services Ltd. of 
Estevan, Saskatchewan and Superior Coring Systems of Calgary, Alberta (see 
Figure 10.2).  Blackie's Coring Services Ltd. completed the coring of wells 07-02-27-
15W2 and 11-18-27-15W2.  Superior Coring Systems completed the coring of wells 
15-16-27-15W2 and 15-14-27-16W2.  Upon completion of coring from the base of 
the Souris River (i.e. approximately 1127.0 mKB) through to the Lower Salt of the 
Prairie Evaporite Formation, the retrieval of core from the core barrel was carried out.  
A routine set of procedures were strictly followed by onsite personnel to ensure the in 
situ stratigraphy of the Prairie Evaporite Formation was maintained and to prevent 
loss of materials.  In addition to several coring personnel, the drill supervisor and 
wellsite geologist, and one or two North Rim geologists supervised the core handling 
for the 2010 drill holes.   

North Rim developed core handling protocol and the procedure is listed below: 

1. A safety meeting was held prior to the recovery of each core.  At this time, all 
safety issues were discussed along with proper core handling procedures. 

2. Two core supervisors were on the drill while the core was being recovered 
from the barrel.  The North Rim Core Supervisor oversaw the core retrieval 
on the floor while the Well Site Geologist supervised the core as it was laid 
down on the catwalk to ensure that the core was in proper sequence. 

3. The procedures that were followed for the core retrieval were explained prior 
to each core retrieval to ensure that the core hands and rig team understood 
the importance of the process, including:

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

a. The brake was first bolted on to the coring barrel.  A core hand would 
run the brake and let the first piece of core out of the barrel while the 
other core hand broke the core into approximately 0.5 m pieces. The 
core was then wiped off and labelled with a grease marker on the 
bottom of core to indicate which end was the bottom; and 

b. The lead core hand stopped the core retrieval process to show the rig 
hands how to properly handle and place (most important) the core on 
the catwalk. 

4. With a clearly marked core bottom, the core was placed on the catwalk with 
the bottom of the core starting at the far left corner of the core holders on the 
catwalk (Figure 10.2). 
 

Figure 10.2  Blackie's Coring Services Performing Core Retrieval 

 
 

5. The core was marked and placed on the catwalk using the methods 
described above.  At the end of each 18.0 m core a core chaser or "rabbit" 
was run through the barrel to ensure no core was remaining inside the barrel.  
Once the core was laid out on the floor the well site geologist and North Rim 
Core Supervisor examined the core to ensure that the in-situ Prairie 
Evaporite stratigraphy was maintained.  The core was fitted together and the 
drill fluid was cleaned by using Varsol or Citrusol (Figure 10.3).  A straight 
black line was drawn along the core axis with arrows pointing up hole to 
ensure that the core direction was maintained.

6. The core boxes were clearly labelled with the location, unique well ID, 
interval cut, meters recovered and total number of boxes in the core run.  The 
boxes were brought to the catwalk in ascending order starting at number one. 

7. The core was boxed, starting at the top of the cored interval and continuing 
towards the base of the interval.  The core was gently broken with a hammer, 
when required, and was placed in the correct boxes under the supervision of 
the North Rim Core supervisor (Figure 10.4).  After the core was boxed, it 
was carried to the core trailer where it was properly wrapped and stored.  All 
core was kept out of the rain to avoid pitting. 

8. If the core contained carnallite, it was bagged and sealed inside the core 
trailer to preserve the carnallite.  A small amount of rice was poured inside 
the bags to absorb excess moisture.

Each drill hole was logged with geophysical wireline tools from Total Depth (TD) to 
surface casing by Weatherford Wireline of Calgary, Alberta.  The wireline logs 
provide geophysical information that can be used to cross-reference lithology, 
mineralogy, and geochemical assay data.  The 2010 wireline program is summarized 
in Table 10.1. 

The geophysical parameters measured with the wireline tools include the natural 
gamma, density, neutron and photoelectric effect and were referenced while 
completing the detailed core descriptions and depth corrections.  The gamma log 
provides a depth-recorded dataset of the natural formation radioactivity and is 
displayed in American Petroleum Institute (API) units.  As isotopic potassium 
undergoes radioactive decay which is read by the wireline gamma tool, the natural 
gamma log is then proportional to the sylvite concentration of the Prairie Evaporite 
Formation.  Therefore the natural gamma log can be used to provide an estimate of 
the potash grade.  The density, neutron, and photoelectric logs are useful tools for 
assessing the mineralogy of the Prairie Evaporite Formation and the presence of 
impurities such as clay, carnallite, and anhydrite.

All geochemical sampling activities were carried out at North Rim's Core Lab facilities 
located at 2834 Millar Avenue in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (refer to Figure 11.1).  
Prior to sampling the following steps were systematically carried out: 

1. Upon arrival at the lab, the core boxes were carefully unloaded from the 
transport vehicle and laid out in sequential order onto the examining tables. 

2. Core box lids were removed and the core bags remained sealed until 
sampling procedures or logging processes commenced.  If carnallite was 
present the plastic bags were replaced when the core was not being 
examined to minimize exposure to the atmosphere. 

3. Using a cloth wetted with a saturated brine solution, the core was cleaned 
thoroughly by wiping mud and debris from the surface in order to identify the 
potash beds, clay seams, and mineralogical changes within the core.

The following points summarize the steps taken by the laboratory staff during the 
geochemical sampling of potash core from the Project Area: 

1. Selection of the correct assay intervals was conducted by North Rim 
geologists.  Geochemical assay sampling was separated into two separate 
intervals.  The first began at the top of the Patience Lake Member to the base 
of the Belle Plaine Member.   The second interval included the entire 
Esterhazy Member.  The salt interbed between the Belle Plaine and the 
Esterhazy Members was not sampled.  The formation contacts were chosen 
from the geophysical logs as the tops were occasionally ambiguous in the 
core making them difficult to identify.  The first and last samples taken over 
the two separate potash intervals were intended to capture the initial and final 
presence of sylvite, but often two to three samples were taken to ensure all 
sylvite was sampled.  

In drill hole 15-16-027-15W2, a small interval was sampled below the base of 
the Esterhazy to test for a slight gamma ray signature from 1,230.74 m – 
1,238.84 m.  Assays returned low sylvite (2.01-6.25% K2O or 3.18-9.89 KCI)) 
and moderate carnallite values (4.27-11.35 % carnallite) over this interval.  
Similar gamma kicks are shown beneath the Esterhazy Member in the other 
drill holes, but were not sampled (See Figure 7.6). 

2. Once the sample intervals were determined the core was slabbed lengthwise 
into halves by laboratory assistants with a dry, two-horsepower band saw 
equipped with a dust collection system (see Figure 11.2).  Once slabbed, the 
two core halves were placed back into their respective box in proper 
stratigraphic order, with both cut surfaces facing up.  The cutting process was 
supervised at all times by a North Rim geologist.  Saw blades were replaced 
frequently when any breach of core integrity was noted (i.e. crystal fracturing 
or splintering of core). 

3. The upper core half was divided into individual samples by drawing straight 
lines across the core diameter in permanent black marker, utilizing natural 
core breaks where possible.  The determination of individual samples is 
based on several parameters outlined in Section 11.3. 

4. The core is then depth corrected by matching intervals of core to their 
corresponding intervals on the geophysical wireline logs which were collected 
at the well site.  Once the entire assay interval was slabbed, the cut surfaces 
were wiped down with a damp cloth to remove any rock powder generated by 
cutting; 

5. As the samples were chosen they were labeled using a numbering scheme 
that incorporated both the drill hole number and a sample number (i.e. 07-02-
S001).

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

6. The sample number was written on the top piece of the upper core half in 
permanent black marker.  A sample tag bearing this number was prepared to 
be used for identification in the core photo.  Figure 11.3 illustrates an 
example of the core photography and sampled core. 

7. Once samples were peer reviewed, the core was photographed with a high 
resolution digital camera attached to an extendable arm on a tripod.  The 
core was moistening with a damp cloth to enhance the photographic quality 
of the photos.

8. Each sample within the assay interval was carefully measured to the nearest 
centimeter and the sample length recorded into the appropriate assay and 
logging spreadsheets.  The sample intervals and ID's were then transposed 
onto the cut surface of the underlying second half of the core in the box (see 
Figure 11.3). 

9. The upper core half was cross-cut into the designated sample intervals with 
the band saw by the lab assistant(s) under the direct supervision of the 
geologist.  Each sample and its corresponding sample tag were placed into a 
waterproof, plastic sample bag and stapled to enclose the sample within the 
bag.  The sample ID was written on the sample bag in permanent black 
marker. 

10. Samples were placed into plastic pails and sealed with lids. The well ID, 
sample interval, and pail number were labelled on the lids and the side of the 
pails.  Shipping sheets were completed that included well information, pail 
numbers, sample numbers, and contact information and accompanied the 
samples to the SRC. 

The core recovery was excellent for all wells and the cutting and slabbing of 
the drill core did not result in any notable material loss.  The accuracy and 
reliability of the assay samples was not compromised during the sampling 
procedure. It is the opinion of the authors that the samples chosen for 
geochemical analyses are representative of the selected intervals based on 
the above discussed parameters and guidelines.

North Rim geologists delivered the samples to SRC Geoanalytical 
Laboratories at 125 – 15 Innovation Boulevard in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan 
for analysis.  There, the samples were crushed, split and analyzed according 
to the parameters stated in SRC's basic potash analysis package.  Quality 
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) measures were strictly adhered to, 
including the use of standards, blanks and duplicates throughout the analysis 
period.  North Rim was not involved in procedures performed at SRC once 
the samples were delivered, nor was North Rim there to supervise the 
analysis process.  Assay results generated are reviewed and approved by 
SRC prior to release.

The determination of individual samples within an assayed interval was based on the 
following geological parameters: 

1. Changes in lithology, mineralogy, K2O grade, crystal size, or insoluble 
content warranted a new sample.  Clay seams were broken out as individual 
samples, with approximately 1.0 cm of overlap on either side of the seam. 

2. Samples did not span geological contacts including the upper and lower 
boundaries of the potash members.  When possible, existing breaks within 
the core were used.  Samples did not exceed 30.0 cm in length. 

Visual inspection of the core in conjunction with consultation of the respective 
gamma, density, and photoelectric curves for the drill holes provided North Rim 
Geologists with sufficient information to accurately assess changes in mineralogy, 
lithology, and grade.  Within mineralized zones, new sampling intervals were 
established where changes in grade occurred; low-grade, moderate-grade and high-
grade mineralized zones are set at K2O percentages of >10% (16%) >20% (32%) 
and >30% (47%) respectively, estimated from the gamma curves.  These K2O 
percentages correlate to approximately 140, 270, and 390 API units.

The following procedures were closely followed to ensure that the core was under 
the supervision of qualified personnel at all times: 

1. From the retrieval of the core at the drill site to the shipment of the core to the 
North Rim Exploration Core Lab in Saskatoon, the core was under the care 
and supervision of the Drilling Supervisor, Wellsite Geologist or North Rim's 
Core Supervisor. 

2. Following the core retrieval, the core was wrapped in plastic, boxed and 
secured on site.  Immediately following the completion of coring, a hotshot 
courier from the coring company delivered the locked core trailer to North 
Rim's Core facility in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

3. As soon as the core arrived at the core laboratory, North Rim core lab staff 
inspected the shipment and unloaded the core onto the tables in stratigraphic 
order.  From this point forward, North Rim Geologists were responsible for 
the supervision of the core.  The North Rim Core Lab is equipped with an 
alarm system to ensure the security and integrity of the core when the lab is 
not under direct surveillance.  North Rim's core lab is temperature and 
humidity controlled to prevent rapid deterioration of the core.  All samples 
were selected, cut, and packaged as quickly as possible under the 
supervision of a North Rim Geologist. 

4. Samples collected for geochemical assay sampling were secured in plastic 
bags to ensure they were not exposed to moisture.  To preserve sample 
identification, the sample number was written on the sample in permanent 
ink, on a sample tag placed inside the bag, and on the bag the core was 
placed in.  The sample bags were sealed and packed into labeled pails and 
remained sealed until they were opened for processing at the SRC Lab.   

5. Samples were delivered by North Rim staff to the SRC Laboratories at 125 
15 Innovation Boulevard in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, for analysis.  SRC is 
an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) accredited to 17025.  
Information sent along with the sample shipment included the client name, 
address, distribution email list, type of geochemical analyses required, and a 
sample list clearly explaining which samples were stored in each pail. 

6. When SRC received the core samples at the lab, they signed, dated and 
returned the North Rim Packing Slip to the North Rim employee who 
delivered them.  After confirming that the sample list matched the samples in 
the pails, a Sample Receipt Report was e mailed to a pre-determined 
distribution list.  

The following sample preparation procedures were carried out by SRC employees 
(Modified from the SRC Geoanalytical Laboratories Sample Report outlining work 
carried out on samples submitted by North Rim): 

a. Prepared an in-house sample list and group number for the shipment. 

b. Labelled sample vials with the appropriate sample numbers. 

c. Individually crushed all samples in the group. 

d. Evenly distributed each sample in the splitter to avoid sample bias.  Cleaned 
the crusher and splitter equipment between each sample using compressed 
air.   

e. Split the crushed sample and inserted one portion into the appropriate 
sample vial.

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

f. All material that did not get analyzed ("reject") was resealed in original 
labelled plastic bags and stored in plastic pails with appropriate group 
number marked on the pail.  

g. Sent vials of material for grinding.  The material was placed in a pot, ground 
for one minute then returned to the vial.  Vials were visually inspected to 
ensure fineness of material.  Grinding pots were cleaned with compressed air 
between each sample and cleaned with silica sand and rinsed with water 
between each group. 

h. The pulverized samples were placed in a tray and sample paperwork was 
submitted to the Main Office.  Worksheets were created detailing the 
samples to be analyzed, the type of analyses requested as well as the 
standards, blanks and split replicates to be completed. 

i. The samples and paperwork were sent to the Geochemical Laboratory and 
samples were analyzed using SRC's Basic Potash Package (Soluble 
Inductively Coupled Plasma [ICP], % Insolubles and % Moisture). 

j. With each set of 40 samples, two potash standards, one quartz blank, and 
one sample pulp replicate analysis was completed.  After processing the 
entire group of samples, a split sample replicate was completed.  After 
receiving all results from the Geoanalytical Lab, the QA/QC department 
completed checks to ensure accuracy. 

k. Upon completion of the assaying and QA/QC procedures, the geochemical 
results were e-mailed to the Encanto contact list in a password-protected zip 
file.   

According to the SRC Geoanalytical Laboratories Customer Quality Control policy 
the sample preparation and analytical procedures are of the highest quality and are 
NI 43-101-compliant.

The authors are able to provide verification of the Encanto 2009–2010 exploration 
program and all associated geochemical data as they were involved in all aspects of 
the sampling process and carried out measures to ensure the security and integrity 
of the core.  The sampling and assaying procedures detailed in Section 12 of this 
report were of the highest quality and are compatible with procedures typically 
undertaken in industry.  Tabetha Stirrett, P.Geo., a co-author and Qualified Person, 
has verified the data relied upon for all aspects of the Mineral Resource calculation.

The assay-derived % K2O data and the associated gamma curves have been 
correlated for each hole of the 2009–2010 drilling program.  The purpose of this 
study was to cross-reference the two data sets as a data verification procedure.  The 
two data sets were plotted on the same graph for each hole, with potash grade along 
the x-axis and depth along the y-axis.  The depths recorded by the gamma wireline 
curve were taken as true depths and the assay sample intervals were adjusted to 
these curves using a best-fit approach.  These adjustments were completed on an 
individual core run scale over the sampled intervals for each drill hole.  An overall 
correlation between the assay and gamma data of 97% was obtained over all drill 
holes (see Table 12.1).   

The following table summarizes how closely the assayed values correlated to the 
estimated %K2O based on the Gamma-ray Estimation Correlation (GREC) 
developed by Bannatyne in his 1983 publication (Bannatyne, 1983). This is 
completed by comparing the assayed values with the estimated values obtained from 
the gamma ray log. For each potash member, a weighted %K2O was calculated from 
both the assay and the GREC over the same interval.  The following formula was 
used to compare these values: 

%	  

Where A = %K2O from Assay, G = %K2O from GREC and (A-G)/(A+G) is the 
absolute value.

typically of higher grade relative to the corresponding assay interval.  

The plot in Figure 12-1 below shows the correlation of the estimated %K2O values 
from the Bannatyne estimation compared to the actual assayed values received from 
SRC for drill hole 15-14-27-16W2.  The plot shows both the red and blue lines 
trending similarly, confirming the results of the assay are correct.

One previous hole, Encanto Lestock 02-09-027-15W2, was drilled in November and 
December of 2009 by Encanto Potash.  Drill hole 02-09-027-15W2 intercepted the 
Patience Lake, Belle Plaine and Esterhazy Potash members.  The Lower Patience 
Lake and Upper Belle Plaine units had grades of 24.10% K2O (38.15 KCI) over 3.90 
m and 21.85% K2O (34.59 KCI) over 4.55 m respectively. 

North Rim was contracted in December of 2009 to complete geological descriptions 
and the assay sample selection for drill hole 02-09-027-15W2.  Tabetha Stirrett, 
P.Geo., completed the logging and sampling of this well and it was completed using 
the same sampling and handling procedures as outlined for the 2010 wells. 

There are two wells drilled in 1954 and 1955 located to the Southwest of the Project 
Area in township 26, ranges 16 and 17.  These two holes are Pyramid Gordon No 1 
(03-28-026-16W2) and IMP TW Gordon (07-14-026-17W2).  Both holes are still on 
the Project Area, but targeted oil bearing formations.  B.A. Swenson 3-36, located at 
03-36-026-14W2 to the east of the property, has a well log which shows the 
intersection of the potash members with the top of the Prairie Evaporite at 1,189.9 m.  
The authors were unable to estimate a grade from the log because it was in Ra-
eq/ton, versus the standard API units that can be easily correlated to %K2O. 

There has been little exploration activity in this region prior to 2009 when Encanto 
began exploration in the area.  Due to the lack of exploration prior to 2009 and the 
relative location of the historical data with respect to the Project Area, North Rim 
cannot say with certainty that the historical data is accurate or in what manner it may 
correlate to the Project Area.  There is not a high degree of confidence in the 
historical data present in this region.

For the purpose of this report the Mineral Resource is based on the assumption that 
the recovery of the potash will be by either solution mining or conventional 
underground mining methods as they exist today.  This report does not address 
which method will be utilized as the depth to the potential minable formations is 
greater than operating Saskatchewan conventional potash mines and shallower than 
typical operating Saskatchewan potash solution mines.  As a result of the depth and 
yet to be determined economic factors, this report will present both a conventional 
and solution mining resource.  

The reader is cautioned that the two mining scenarios presented below should 
be treated as separate Mineral Resource calculations and should NOT be 
added together.  The solution mining scenario was prepared as the base case 
with the conventional resource provided as an alternative case until additional 
engineering studies are completed.  Engineering factors that are yet to be 
determined to assess the economic viability may be, but are not limited to: 

 Study of the geothermal gradient to determine the energy inputs 
required (solution mining scenario). 

 Study of potential engineering challenges to determine suitable pillar 
sizes and extraction ratios (conventional mining scenario). 

The Mineral Resources derived herein were estimated by Qualified Persons Ms. 
Tabetha Stirrett, P. Geo. and Mr. Earl Gebhardt, P.Eng., with the assistance of Mr. 
Brett Dueck, EIT (Engineer in Training) of North Rim.

The Project Area consists of 16,831 acres of Indian Reserve home reserve and is 
situated approximately 100.0 km north of the city of Regina, Saskatchewan.  The 
permit spans a region encompassing Township 27, Range 15 and 16 West of the 
Second Meridian.

The following principles of exploration techniques and sampling methods commonly 
employed by other Saskatchewan potash mine operators were used in determining 
the potential extent, quality, and volume of the potash Mineral Resource:

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

1. The primary method employed to determine thickness and concentration of 
potash mineralization was the 2009 and 2010 drill core.   

2. The extent of potash mineralization and continuity between drill holes (i.e., 
areal extent of potash beds) is determined by subsurface mapping as well as 
maps compiled from the 3D seismic survey as interpreted by Boyd 
PetroSearch.  The limiting factors are property boundaries and structural 
disturbances related to dissolution of the Prairie Evaporite Formation and 
subsequent collapse of overlying beds. 

3. For estimation of the Mineral Resource the areal extent surrounding a drill 
hole for which it is reasonable to infer geological continuity is termed the 
"radius of influence" (ROI).  This is estimated at the hole centre to 2.0 km for 
an Indicated Resource and 2.0 km to 5.0 km for an Inferred resource.  A 5.0 
km Inferred ROI was selected as it covers the area of the 3D seismic survey 
and hole spacing sufficiently to provide confidence in the continuity of the 
geology in the Project Area. 

4. Based on review of the 3D seismic survey conducted by RPS Boyd 
PetroSearch, it is possible to divide the Project Area into three areas for the 
purpose of estimating the presence of a Mineral Resource as follows: 

a) Areas that are judged from seismic data to be potentially affected by 
the processes of subsurface dissolution and removal of the Prairie 
Evaporite; this would include the Class 1-3 collapse areas. 

b) Areas that are anomalous to the regional geology and require 
additional geological or geophysical information before validating a 
continuous Mineral Resource.  This includes the Souris River Low 
Velocity Layer as identified on seismic.  This area was not deducted 
from the Resource calculation, but should be investigated further.   

RPS Boyd PetroSearch has interpreted there to be a high probability 
of carnallite in portions of the Belle Plaine Member.  Where 
interpreted by RPS Boyd PetroSearch these areas have been 
removed from the calculation. 

The Esterhazy Member did not demonstrate consistent K2O grade 
and was of higher carnallite grade.  It was not used in either the 
solution or conventional mining scenarios.  Future studies should 
include a more detailed review of the potential of the Esterhazy 
should a solution mining method be selected. 

c) Areas that are judged to have continuous geology with no 
subsurface dissolution or alteration of the Prairie Evaporite as 
determined from review of the seismic data.

Based on the author's previous experience, publically available data and the amount 
of disturbance detected in the upper stratigraphic sequences by 3D seismic, the 
following distance buffers were used around the various types of anomalies for the 
different mining scenarios:

Note: The areas used are from the Belle Plaine Member as it was most affected 
by anomalies.  Refer to Figure 14.1 and Figure 14.2 for the Patience Lake 
Member areas 

 

All known Class 1-3 collapse anomalies, including buffers, and high probability 
carnallite areas as identified by 3D seismic have been excluded from the Resource 
calculation.  The interpreted high probability carnallite was only removed from the 
affected sub-unit, the Belle Plaine Member. 

In addition, allowance has been made for those features not detectable by seismic.  
These can include areas of significant dip, carnallite content, low grade or thin beds.  
Personal communication of the author and publically available data (Hardy, 
Halabura, & Shewfelt, 2010) concerning both solution and conventional mining 
resource calculations, indicates that a total of 10.0% is typical for unknown 
detectable anomalies.  Due to this, an additional 10.0% has been deducted from the 
Resource area calculation for unknown anomalies.  Areas deemed to have 
anomalies based on review of the 3D seismic study conducted by Boyd PetroSearch 
are presented for the solution mining scenario in Figure 14.1 and for the conventional 
mining scenario in Figure 14.2.

The following definitions in sections on the Mineral Resource definitions can be found 
in the November 22, 2005 Canadian Institute of Mining (CIM) Definition Standards 
document prepared for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 

14.4.1 INFERRED MINERAL RESOURCE 

"An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity 
and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited 
sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  
The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes." 

"Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot 
be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to 
an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration.  
Confidence in the estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of 
technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability 
worthy of public disclosure.  Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from 
estimates forming the basis of feasibility or other economic studies." 

14.4.2 INDICATED MINERAL RESOURCE 

"An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be 
estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of 
technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced 
closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed." 

"Mineralization may be classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource by the Qualified 
Person when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such as to allow 
confident interpretation of the geological framework and to reasonably assume the 
continuity of mineralization.  The Qualified Person must recognize the importance of 
the Indicated Mineral Resource category to the advancement of the feasibility of the 
project.  An Indicated Mineral Resource estimate is of sufficient quality to support a 
Preliminary Feasibility Study which can serve as the basis for major development 
decisions."

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

14.4.3 MEASURED MINERAL RESOURCE 

"A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 
grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well 
established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the 
appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production 
planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is 
based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered 
through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological 
and grade continuity." 

"Mineralization or other natural material of economic interest may be classified as a 
Measured Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the nature, quality, 
quantity and distribution of data are such that the tonnage and grade of the 
mineralization can be estimated to within close limits and that variation from the 
estimate would not significantly affect potential economic viability.  This category 
requires a high level of confidence in, and understanding of, the geology and controls 
of the mineral deposit." 

1 4 . 5  P O T E N T I A L  S O L U T I O N  M I N I N G  I N T E R V A L S  ( B A S E  C A S E )  

The term "Mineral Resource" covers mineralization and natural material of intrinsic 
economic interest which has been identified and estimated through exploration and 
sampling, and within which mineral resources may subsequently be defined by the 
consideration and application of technical, economic, legal, environmental, socio-
economic and governmental factors. 

The drill holes used in the solution mining scenario resource estimate are shown in 
Figure 14.1.  

The mineral resource is present over most of the Project Area, supported by 
consistent thicknesses and grades and as demonstrated by the permit core holes, 
regional drill holes, and 2D and 3D seismic surveys. 

The Indicated or Inferred Resources in this section were estimated based on solution 
mining from the bottom of the Belle Plaine to the top of the Patience Lake Member. 

Hardy, Halabura, & Shewfelt (2010) describe that solution mining is accomplished by 
undercutting the mineralized zone by dissolving the initial cavern below the zone of 
interest in the halite.  This process involves: 

 The assumption that potash will be liberated via dissolution similar to those 
processes currently used at Saskatchewan Mosaic's Belle Plaine mine.  Solution 
mining involves the dissolution of a selected bed with removal of all of the soluble 
material including non-potassium rich minerals;  



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 87 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

 Dissolving the evaporite rock upwards through the mineralized beds while 
maintaining a cap of oil or gas which inhibits the vertical growth of the cavern; 

 The oil or gas cap prohibits the vertical growth of the cavern until a large area is 
undermined; and 

 The cavern is expanded upwards by raising the cap and dissolving mineralized 
portions of the roof. 

Based on the above described solution mining methodology the 'solution interval' is 
defined as the entire Patience Lake Member, the salt interbed and the entire Belle 
Plaine Member.  It includes all barren interbed halite as well as insoluble rich layers.  
An 'economic cut-off grade' for the roof and floor picks was assumed to be where 
equivalent carnallite was less than 2.91% (1% MgCl2), K2O values were greater than 
10% (15.8%) and where average 'mineable grade' was greater than 15% (27.9%).  
The Esterhazy was not included in the calculation as it has an average equivalent 
carnallite content of 7.57% (2.59% MgCl2) and the grade was lower than the 
economic threshold cut-off.  

Table 14.3 shows a summary of the tonnages calculated for the solution mining 
resource scenario.  The grade and thicknesses used from the individual holes in the 
Project Area can be found in Appendix D-1 (Stirrett & Gebhardt, 2011). 

1 4 . 6  P O T E N T I A L  C O N V E N T I O N A L  M I N I N G  I N T E R V A L S  ( A L T E R N A T I V E  
C A S E )  

In determining the resource for the conventional mining scenario a "Geological 
Interval" was chosen to calculate the Resource and was selected based on clay 
seam stratigraphy and nomenclature outlined by Phillips (1982).  The "Geological 
Interval" is defined as those intervals which include the uppermost bounding "marker" 
clay seams and the highest K2O values from assays.  The intervals were also verified 
with wireline logs using consistent inflection points off of the gamma ray log.  The 
reader is cautioned that the thicknesses used for this calculation are not a 'mining 
cut' and will likely be reduced if a conventional mining method is determined feasible.  
Thick stable roof 'salt back' is necessary when mining potash conventionally.  
Current Saskatchewan operating mines prefer to have at minimum of 7 m of stable 
salt back.  Due to this criterion, the Upper Patience Lake was not used in this 
calculation and drill holes 02-09 and 07-02 were removed from the Lower Patience 
Lake calculation.  Note that only one sub member can be mined at one time (ie. 
Lower Patience Lake or Upper Belle Plaine).  

Table 14.4 shows a summary of the tonnages calculated for the conventional mining 
resource scenario.  The grade and thicknesses used from the individual holes in the 
Project area can be found in Appendix D-2 (Stirrett & Gebhardt, 2011).

16.1.1 ORE BODY ACCESS 

PRODUCTION SHAFT 

Genera l  

Considerations when determining shaft sizes, shape, and furnishings for the 
production and service shaft included: 

 Strata Conditions:  Shaft sinking in the Saskatchewan potash areas is 
challenging.  The first problem encountered is the lack of bedrock to mount 
headframe and hoist foundations on.  Because it is approximately 100 m 
from surface to the bedrock interface it is necessary to have load distributing 
foundations for the headframe to ensure there is no tilting or sinking.  It is 
normal practice to freeze the strata from surface to below the bottom of the 
Blairmore formation (construction of near surface ventilation tunnels in 
saturated till can also be very problematic if it isn't frozen).  It is then the 
practice to drill off, grout and sink through a number of grout covers prior to 
reaching the first potash beds.  The Blairmore formation is well known 
because of the history of difficulties associated with sinking through this 
formation.  However, the strata below the Blairmore are waterbearing and 
extremely difficult to grout as for instance even very fine ground cement is 
difficult to inject at pressures as high as 4,000 psi.  Time required for sinking 
a shaft in Saskatchewan for the purpose of starting a potash mine has 
ranged from 17 months (Potash Corporation of America #2 shaft - there were 
no unusual shaft sinking problems) to five years (International Minerals and 
Chemicals K1 shaft - mainly due to ground freezing problems in the 
Blairmore formation). 

 Ventilation requirements:  The mine is expected to require ventilation 
capacity of 325,000 cfm of ventilating air.  This will be done via shafts large 
enough not to require a lot of ventilating pressure and without air velocities 
that are uncomfortable for personnel or potentially able to cause conveyance 
movement.  There has also been a tendency among regulating bodies 
worldwide for increased air volumes to be required particularly where there is 
diesel equipment underground.  The production shaft will be the upcast shaft. 

 A 5.46 m (18 ft) diameter production shaft has been estimated.

Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

 The Encanto production hoisting system as envisaged will be capable of 
handling 21,275 t/a per day of ore hoisted in skips 35 tonnes capacity.  This 
would permit ship cycle times of 106.6 seconds with scheduled hoisting times 
of 18 h/d (75% utilization).  In general, hoisting systems are found to be more 
satisfactory when larger skips moving at lower speed are selected compared 
with smaller skips hoisting at higher speeds.  The 75% utilization is 
considered to be a reasonable factor to allow for maintenance, testing and 
shift changes. 

SHAFT DESIGN 

Shaf t  Shape 

All of the shafts in Saskatchewan potash mines have been circular, or nearly circular.  
In New Mexico potash mines some square or rectangular shafts have been used.  
Because of the need to employ ground freezing in Saskatchewan, plus high water 
pressure in the strata circular, near circular or elliptical shafts are the practical 
choices. 

Shaf t  Depth 

The lower limit of the potash bearing horizon in the vicinity of both the production and 
service shafts has been found from drill holes to be 1,197 m (3,927 ft) below surface. 

The exhaust air will be travelling up the production shaft.  The loading pocket will be 
located below the floor of the shaft station.  Ore conveyed to the shaft area will go 
into a 300 t capacity surge bin located between the potash level and the loading 
pocket access drift.  Ore from the surge bin will be delivered onto a 137 cm (54") 
conveyor belt by a pan feeder and these units will fill the loading pocket measuring 
bins as required. 

With either friction hoists or double drum hoists it is necessary to provide additional 
shaft depth below the loading pocket or shaft station to allow for accidental 
overwinds and to provide space for skip/cage emergency retarding equipment plus 
pumps and tanks on the shaft bottom.  In the case of the production shaft the depth 
below the loading pocket is likely to be of the order of 39 m (approximately 120 ft). 
There will be an access ramp driven to the bottom of the production shaft to facilitate 
clean-up.  A ramp to the bottom of the service shaft will not be required. 

Headframes 

A number of headframe designs have been used in the Saskatchewan potash 
industry.  Until recently all headframes were constructed out of steel with tower 
mounted Koepe hoists being preferred. 

Recently four concrete slip formed headframes have been constructed.  
Saskatchewan is an area with considerable expertise in slip forming concrete as 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 95 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

numerous grain elevators have been constructed using this method.  Once pouring 
has started the height of the structure increases by one foot per hour on average so 
pouring is a rapid process. 

All Saskatchewan potash headframes have been constructed on load spreading 
foundations due to the lack of hard rock for foundations.  Another consideration is 
that headframe foundations have to be protected from frost heave which may result 
from ground freezing required during the shaft sinking. 

Both headframes proposed for the Muskowekwan site are expected to be slip 
formed.  The shaft houses will be heated and large enough to permit shaft 
conveyance replacement as well as providing an area where equipment can be 
taken apart for lowering.  The production headframe will also house a 175 t capacity 
raw ore receiving bin and a pan feeder for delivering ore onto the belt feeding the 
mill. 

In both headframes there will be 50 t travelling cranes mounted with tracks supported 
by the top of the concrete headframe walls.  Steelwork will rise above the crane to 
support hoist room walls and the headframe roof.  There will also be travelling cranes 
in both shaft houses used during conveyance changes and for lifting heavy 
equipment. 

There will be elevators in both headframes plus fire code compliant stairways 
providing access to the skip dump area, retarding equipment, suspension decks, 
hoist floors and headframe roofs. 

16.1.2 SERVICE SHAFT 

GENERAL 

The service shaft station will have a hoist with 20 t lifting capacity and the 
cage/bail/shaft station/headframe will be able to accommodate equipment 12.2 m x 
2.29 m x 3.66 m (40' x 7.5' x 12') for lowering. 

Both shafts will be 5.49 m (18 ft) diameter. In the service shaft this will provide space 
for a large cage with counterweight.  The cage as envisaged will fit into a "bail" for 
easy removal and will have a hinged roof and upper deck floor to permit long items to 
be carried.  There will be an inspection canopy with protective railings on the top of 
the cage so shaft inspections and shaft maintenance work can be carried out. 

A bridge crane will be installed on the service shaft station to permit assembly of the 
first mining machine prior to carrying out initial underground development. 

A hoisting speed of 336 metres/minute (1,100 ft per minute) is envisaged.  Like the 
production shaft a slip formed concrete headframe with a tower mounted friction hoist 
will be used. 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 96 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

A concrete ventilation tunnel will enter the shaft just below the collar to provide 
downcast air access. 

16.1.3 SHAFT SINKING 

The service shaft will be sunk by an experienced contractor.  Due to the shaft depth 
newer methods such as blind boring cannot be used. 

The first step in the shaft design process is to drill a pilot hole from surface through 
the Prairie Evaporite in the centre of each proposed shaft (note: one mine drilled a 
single hole halfway between two shafts and the information obtained was of little use 
for either shaft).  These holes will be cored, logged and thoroughly tested.  Each hole 
will then be filled with grout to a level approximately fifteen meters below the 
Blairmore.  This will allow the holes to be used for freeze wall monitoring while not 
permitting large inflows from deeper waterbearing strata.  The two shafts will be 
approximately 180 m apart. 

The shaft locations have been selected after consideration of the location of 
Winnipegosis Mounds below the Prairie Evaporite.  Saskatchewan potash mines 
have experienced an increase in ground support problems in areas where the potash 
is being mined above the edges of these mounds.  There are several Winnipegosis 
mounds in the northern part of the project area. 

The pilot holes will provide detailed geological, geophysical, structural and 
hydrological data.  In each case the entire hole will be cored and logged.  The cores 
will be photographed and collected for further mechanical studies, as well as porosity 
and permeability determinations.  A DST will be required for all permeable zones.  
The DST will determine formation fluid pressures and flow rates and is valuable for 
determining the type of grouting which should be used, what the duration of the 
grouting campaign is likely to be and the anticipated cost. 

A full suite of geophysical logs will be required to gain further information on the 
stratigraphy, mechanical rock properties and hydrology of the sedimentary sequence.  
Surveys will include electrical resistivity, bulk density, neutron, sonic, gamma ray and 
caliper logs, and salinity tests.  Information from these studies will provide inputs into 
the shaft sinking techniques as well as the shaft lining design. 

During the shaft site selection process it will be necessary to locate an 
environmentally acceptable location for placing the waste rock, water and salt from 
the shaft sinking (and from any shaft pillar area development done in salt).  While the 
broken rock will not be acid generating it will contain chemical remnants from 
explosive use, water and a considerable quantity of salt.  Similarly, the shaft sinking 
head frames should incorporate floor drains to dispose of any water leaking from 
dump trucks under the rock chutes. 

A location for a concrete batch plant will also be required.  This concrete plant will 
require capability to heat all concrete components. 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 97 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

At the time of freeze hole drilling, availability of drill rigs will be an important issue.  If 
it is possible to obtain two rigs to operate on each shaft location the drilling will be 
expedited. 

Experience in previous Saskatchewan shaft sinking projects has found ground 
freezing to be effective in consolidating the weak water bearing formations during 
sinking and construction.  The ground freezing technique requires drilling freeze 
holes outside the perimeter of the shaft location and circulating cold (typically 
Calcium Chloride) brine.  The freeze holes are drilled by oil field rigs and use 
standard practices.  Up to four months are required to complete drilling and prepare 
for freezing.  A high degree of drilling accuracy (less than 50 cm tolerance) is 
required to ensure a uniform ice wall is constructed.  Each freeze hole is lined with a 
pressure tested steel casing, and a liner is installed to create a brine circulation 
system.  The freeze pipes are manifolded and connected to a refrigeration plant.  
Typically four 82 ton freeze units would be used for each shaft and one advantage of 
having the shafts located fairly close together (say 180 m) is all freeze units can be 
located in one building requiring fewer operators and providing more operating 
flexibility, particularly if a breakdown occurs or more freezing capacity is required in 
one shaft.  

All Saskatchewan potash mines (except the former Potash Company of America 
production shaft) have elected to freeze only to slightly deeper than the bottom of the 
Blairmore.  Approximately 35 freeze holes will be required around each shaft and 
they will be arranged in a circular pattern approximately 11 m in diameter. 

Once the ground has been frozen (freezing requires approximately four months), 
shaft sinking can begin.  At the beginning of the sinking a crane will be used to move 
material out of the shaft until sufficient room has been made for installation of the 
Galloway stage. 

For loading broken rock into sinking buckets the traditional method used in 
Saskatchewan involves Cryderman muckers suspended from the Galloway stage.  
Clamshell type mucking units move broken material faster but are not favoured 
because a lot of shaft bottom labour is required cleaning the bottom prior to drilling 
the next round. 

The shafts will be sunk using conventional drill and blast methods.  Several of the 
earlier potash shafts in Saskatchewan were sunk to below the bottom of the 
Blairmore using hand-held pneumatic pavement breakers only.  Some explosives are 
now being used.  The concern is to avoid damage to the freeze pipes by blasting. 

A decision will be required prior to sinking as to what type of lining will be used 
through the Blairmore formation.  For this assessment it has been assumed cast iron 
tubbing of the "German Tubbing" type using bolt together segments, lead gaskets 
and lead washers will be used in the service shaft and a composite liner installed in 
the production shaft. 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 98 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

Because tubbing installation is faster than installation of the welded composite liner it 
is likely the service shaft will be equipped in this way.  This will permit the shafts to 
be linked up underground sooner. 

Double steel welded liners with concrete in between is the favoured Saskatchewan 
shaft lining method for preventing water inflow from the Blairmore at present.  While 
this type of lining provides most effective sealing against water inflow and requires 
less maintenance, it does cost more initially.  Several shafts have been sunk using 
the composite liners and the design of each liner has tended to differ from site to site 
as experience with the methodology has increased. 

In the case of both cast iron tubbing and double steel welded liners a watertight seal 
is required both above and below the Blairmore (or other waterbearing formation).  In 
tubbing equipped shafts a layer of competent rock is selected for the seal location 
and the wall is smoothed off.  A tubbing wedge ring known as a keilkranz is then 
installed and, in the case of a 5.5 m (18 ft) diameter shaft, approximately 18,000 
square section Honduras Pitch Pine wedges of decreasing lengths and cross-
sections are hammered into the annular space between the cast iron keilkranz and 
the rock wall.  Wedges continue to be hammered in until a steel spike of 
approximately one-quarter invh diameter refuses to penetrate.  This is known as a 
pikotage. 

An alternative to the pikotage is the use of Dowell Chemical Sealant developed in the 
1960s which does an excellent job (the upper seal in the PCS Lanigan shaft is 
comprised of this swelling sealant, while generally satisfactory some grouting was 
required during the thawing process). 

A Galloway stage will be used in each shaft and a concrete lining will be installed as 
sinking progresses.  It is normal in Saskatchewan for concrete linings to gradually 
increase in thickness as the depth increases.  It is expected that a number of grout 
covers will need to be drilled and grouted off in the strata below the Blairmore.   

Grouting can be expensive and time consuming.  Some shafts have required 
grouting programs taking up to 200 days.  In those sections of the shafts where the 
concrete lining is subject to chloride attack the concrete should be chloride resistant 
with high fly-ash content.  Some of the older shafts only used sulphate resistant 
cement which deteriorated due to chloride attack. 

It is normal in Saskatchewan potash shafts where tubbing is used, for some water 
leakage to be experienced.  This water is mainly collected in "water-rings" which 
have been cast into the shaft lining and the water rings are linked to the shaft piping 
system and conducted to the main underground pump station.  Water which falls 
down the shaft and not collected in the water-rings will be collected in shaft bottom 
tanks and sump pumps will then pump the water to the main pump station. 

Saskatchewan potash mine shafts which initially had tubbing installed through the 
Blairmore Formation have in several cases required tubbing installation through 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 99 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

some of the waterbearing Devonian horizons as well.  Encanto should consider 
installing this extra tubbing as part of the initial shaft sinking. 

Shaft sinking practice has changed considerably since the initial potash shafts were 
sunk in Saskatchewan.  To reduce costs, fewer personnel are used in the shafts 
particularly for bench drilling where miners using pluggers have tended to be 
replaced by hydraulic drill jumbos.  The net effect is that shaft sinking has tended to 
take longer. 

The shafts will be equipped with rope guides (slippers at each corner of the skip and 
cage to avoid conveyance rotation) and the production shaft skips will be arranged 
north-south (to negate Coriolis effects).  There is significant space in the production 
shaft for the skips so chances of skip collisions are remote.  There will be room in the 
shaft for a number of pipe ranges should they be required for mill tailings or to deal 
with unplanned water inflows. 

16.1.4 PRODUCTION HOIST 

At peak hoisting times there is expected to be a hoisting capability requirement of 
1182 t/h.  This is a cycle time of 106.6 seconds using 35 t capacity skips.  Hoist 
operating hours are planned to be 18 hours per day.  This provides sufficient time to 
deal with shaft inspections, shaft and hoist maintenance and to handle situations 
where the mine has full bins underground while the mill is short of ore. 

For this study the cost of a new multi-rope friction hoist has been estimated.  It is 
recognized that at the time of equipment procurement there may be suitable friction 
or clutched double drum hoists available on the used market and the shaft sinking 
contractor may also have a suitable hoist available. 

Because the skips will not use all of the available area in the 5.5 m (18 ft) diameter 
production shaft, there will be space available in the shaft to accommodate a "Mary 
Ann" cage.  There will be inspection canopies fitted to the top of the skips to permit 
the shaft crew to do shaft maintenance. 

PRODUCTION SHAFT SURFACE VENTILATION TUNNEL 

There will be a short ventilation tunnel coming off the production shaft and reaching 
surface outside the headframe.  Two exhaust fans will be located there and these 
fans will be selected with a capacity sufficient to move upcast shaft air from the shaft 
without sucking air and dust out of the headframe.  The fan housing will be insulated 
to protect the fan blades from icing. 

16.1.5 SERVICE SHAFT,  HEADFRAME AND HOIST 

The service shaft will have a tower mounted Koepe hoist with 15 t usable lifting 
capacity. The cage/bail/shaft station/headframe will be able to accommodate 
equipment 12.2 m x 2.29 m x 3.66 m (40' x 7.5' x 12') for lowering. 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 100 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

A 5.49 m (18 ft) diameter shaft has been costed.  This will provide space for a large 
cage (suitable for vehicles to drive through to pick up or put down loads) with 
counterweight.  The cage as envisaged will fit into a "bail" for easy removal and will 
have a hinged roof to permit long items to be carried.  There will be an inspection 
canopy with protective railings on the top of the cage so shaft inspections and shaft 
maintenance work can be carried out. 

A 20 t bridge crane will be installed on the service shaft station to permit assembly of 
the first mining machine prior to carrying out initial underground development. 

Like the production shaft a slip formed concrete headframe with a tower mounted 
friction hoist will be used.   The hoist room will have a 50 t crane to be used for hoist 
installation. 

The service shaft house will be equipped with a 20 t crane for heavy items requiring 
lifting in the headframe such as the cage. 

There will be an elevator in the headframe as well as stairways providing access to 
the retarding gear, suspension deck, hoist floor and roof. 

A concrete ventilation tunnel will enter the shaft just below the collar to provide 
downcast air access. 

The service shaft will be equipped with a 1,650 kW AC hoist with a low voltage 
induction motor driving through a gearbox.  The mechanical specifications will be 
identical to the production hoist.  The service shaft will utilize a large two deck cage 
which vehicles can easily drive through to deliver and pick up loads and the cage will 
operate in balance with a counterweight.

16.2.1 IN IT IAL  DEVELOPMENT 

MINE DESIGN 

The Muskowekwan Mine will be the deepest conventional underground potash mine 
in Saskatchewan.  In addition, mining will be carried out in a potash bed which hasn't 
been mined by conventional methods.  Because of these factors preliminary mine 
design has incorporated the following: 

 When the PCS Allan production shaft was sunk the back over the potash 
level station failed within two months.  To avoid this type of problem both the 
Encanto Muskowekwan shafts will have their main shaft stations excavated 
in salt below the Belle Plaine horizon; 

 In order to avoid ground support difficulties in the shaft pillar area the shaft 
locations have been selected near an area where there is believed to be 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 101 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

carnallite in the Belle Plaine formation.  All shaft pillar area facilities will be 
excavated in an 11 m (36 ft) thick salt layer which is located below the Belle 
Plaine potash member; consideration will need to be given to a salt storage 
location to contain the salt produced during the early development. 

 All main development will be carried out as stress relieved four entry 
systems.  It is likely that mine operators will use the #307 Clay seam as a 
guide and normally cut ore to approximately ten centimeters above this 
marker horizon.  

Note: Clay seams are common and used as markers in all conventional 
Saskatchewan potash mines other than those mining the Esterhazy formation. These 
clay seams have all been identified over a wide geographic area and numbered. 
Mines cutting ore from the Esterhazy formation don't use clay seams as a mining 
guide because clay seams are rarely found (they use a colour change to identify the 
ore). A disadvantage of mining in areas where there are clay seams is they tend to 
act as zones of weakness so mines operating in the Esterhazy formation are able to 
mine much wider rooms than can be safely achieved in mines where clay seams are 
common.  

 Room widths and pillar dimensions will be finalised by experimentation and 
instrumentation after commencement of mining.  Room width is typically a 
multiple of the cutting width the mining machine has been designed for.  The 
actual cutting height will be determined by the clay seam locations as mining 
too close to a clay seam under the floor is likely to result in troublesome floor 
heave and having too thin a salt beam above the mining horizon is also likely 
to result in failure or a requirement for support such as rockbolting. 

 All production mining panels will be designed to incorporate stress relief and 
panel lengths will be limited to 915 m (3,000 ft).  Similarly, the wings of panel 
chevrons will initially be limited to a maximum of 92 m (300 ft) in length.  The 
intent is to complete panel mining and remove the equipment from the mining 
panel before back failure occurs. 

MINING EQUIPMENT 

It is assumed the service shaft will be sunk by conventional methods and can be 
completed several months prior to the production shaft being ready for hoisting.  
There will then be an opportunity to cut a connecting entry from the service shaft 
station across to the production shaft station.  This is important as greatly improved 
ventilation results from the link. 

In order to cut the entry linking the shafts it will first be necessary to assemble a 20 t 
capacity bridge crane on the service shaft potash level station.  Components of the 
first mining machine will then be lowered in appropriate sequence so the machine 
can be assembled on the shaft station.  The service shaft will be complete by this 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 102 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

time and will have a main electric feeder cable installed.  Suitable transformers and 
switchgear to power the mining machine will be installed on the shaft station. 

In order to move the potash ore cut by the mining machine two multi-purpose 
vehicles should be purchased capable of picking up, putting down and transporting 
open top containers.  Several underground vehicle manufacturers build multi-
purpose vehicles but not all of them operate the same way.  A manufacturer building 
vehicles which can pick-up or put down 7.5 t capacity ore hauling containers in 20 
seconds without the operator leaving his seat is the South African firm Bird Machines 
(Pty) Ltd. 

METHODOLOGY 

The proposed methodology for moving the salt is as follows: 

• The mining machine cuts the salt and its conveyor loads the 7.5 t container 
which is being carried by the multi-purpose vehicle (MPV). 

• The MPV then takes the container to the service shaft and deposits the full 
container on the cage floor. 

• The cage is then hoisted to surface. 

• A second MPV on surface then picks up the full salt container and moves the 
salt to a location where the salt will be stockpiled. 

• A crane empties the container and the MPV takes it back to the shaft.  Four ore 
containers would be required and containers could be transported on both cage 
decks. 

The service shaft station should be extended approximately 10 m (32.8 ft) on the 
opposite side of the shaft from the crane bay.  This will permit the MPV to be parked 
there prior to the lowering and assembly of the first mining machine.  The MPV will 
be able to drive right through the cage when moving empty containers to the mining 
machine and moving filled containers from the mining machine into the cage for 
hoisting.  

When cutting the initial entry it will first be cut one cutting drum width (i.e. 4.57 m or 
15 ft wide) and no higher than is necessary to get the equipment through.  This will 
permit improved ventilation and also provide a second mine access.  After the link is 
made to the production shaft station the mining machine will be used to cut the entry 
from the shaft to the base of the future surge bin followed by the ramp up into the ore 
zone.  After the main shaft pillar development has been completed a ramp will be cut 
to the production shaft bottom (note: while many skip designers and manufacturers 
claim their skips will not spill, the potash loading process results in dust discharge 
from the skip which must be handled at the shaft bottom).   The second mining 
machine will be lowered and assembled as soon as space is available underground 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 103 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

and used to widen the link between the shafts to double pass width (9.14 m or 30 ft) 
and cut the floor to finished height. 

An average mining rate of over 100 tonnes per shift should be obtainable.  After the 
shafts are connected the MPV units can be used for underground purposes such as 
personnel transportation or carrying any of the 30+ types of modules available for 
these types of machines. 

If the production shaft is ready to hoist ore when the two shafts have been linked a 
Stamler feeder could be set up to deliver salt or potash into the loading pocket bins. 
Mining of the shaft pillar area development will then be able to proceed at a daily rate 
close to the full capability of one mining machine. 

SURGE BIN DEVELOPMENT 

The top of the surge bin will be in ore.  After the shaft pillar area development has 
been completed a ramp up into the Belle Plaine formation will be driven and the 
surge bin area will then be accessed.  The contractor's crew will drill cut holes from 
the potash level elevation down to the loading pocket conveyor entry using the same 
type of longhole drill used for shaft grouting and then blasting a raise through which 
surge bin excavation material can be dropped.  Several bins have recently been 
excavated at Mosaic Potash Colonsay using a small excavator with a cutting head.  
This may be a method which can be used at Muskowekwan.  The writer has 
experience of surge bin excavation in which the shaft crew used shaft sinking 
pluggers to drill benches surrounding the pilot raise and blasting them.  The 
installation of the surge bin steelwork, pan feeder, loading pocket belt conveyor and 
loading pocket steelwork will then be carried out.  Note: Examination of seismic data 
indicates the presence of carnallite in one of the salt beds through which the surge 
bin will be excavated.  This will require design consideration. 

After completion of production shaft sinking a large concrete plug will be poured at 
the shaft bottom. The shaft steel work will be installed from the shaft bottom up to the 
shaft station including the loading pocket.  The shaft guide ropes will then be 
installed. These ropes are hung from the headframe suspension deck and have 
stacks of steel cheese weights at the bottom to maintain tension.  The production 
headframe will be complete by this time and the hoist will be ready for operation. 
After the guide ropes have been installed the sinking hoist will be used to lower the 
bail for one of the skips to the loading pocket prior to installing the hoist ropes. 

After the surge bin has been completed, the conveyor to the loading pocket will be 
installed.  A Stamler feeder breaker will then be located at the top of the surge bin 
ready to handle the first development ore. 

16.2.2 MINING EQUIPMENT 

Most of the potash ore mined in Saskatchewan has been cut using borer type mining 
machines.  The suppliers of the original borers were Goodman Manufacturing

Service Company who built their Models Marietta 780, 780AW-4, 911, and 1012 
units. 

Both National Mine Service Company and Goodman are now out of business but 
Prairie Machine & Parts of Saskatoon and Sandvik in Austria are now building 
borers. 

Sandvik produces their model 460 Borer which is able to cut 4.92 m (15 ft) high. 

Several mines purchased Jeffrey HR120 Heliminers during the 1970s but these 
models did not become popular. 

During the past decade Joy Manufacturing Company have had great success 
manufacturing drum type mining machines for use in mining coal, potash, trona, salt 
and other minerals.  They have great manufacturing capability and are also in many 
cases able to offer local service and rebuild facilities. 

For the Encanto project the options are briefly as follows: 

BORERS 

Borers offer long machine life, high tonnages cut between major overhauls.  Borers 
are also long delivery items with high capital cost (nearly double the cost of typical 
drum miners).  Borers are relatively inflexible in cutting height – if the ore zone 
exceeds the machine height the operator is forced to take a second cut or lose the 
additional ore.  It can sometimes be extremely difficult to move borers out of mining 
panels due to closure and moving the machines from one part of the mine to another 
can be difficult.  Main gearcases on borers are extremely heavy making it difficult to 
remove them from the mine for overhaul.  In the case of Joy drum miners it is very 
common for mines to have spare cutting assemblies, gearcases, etc. which are 
overhauled at Joy facilities. 

DRUM MINERS 

Drum miners have a wide range of cutting height.  Drum miners cut vertical walls 
(this is not always an advantage because the walls can slab).  Drum miners are often 
used in New Mexico Potash mines and at Cleveland Potash in the UK. 

The highest producing mining machines in potash mines are all borers.  A lot 
depends on the type of mining panel where the unit is operating – borer equipped 
mining units produce between 500,000 tonnes per year and 1.8 million tonnes per 
year.  However, the author is very familiar with a South African coal operation which 
operates a fleet of Joy drum miners which have approached 100,000 tonnes per 
month cut each in hard coal for the past ten years.  New Mexico drum miners in 
potash appear to average 60,000 tonnes cut per month. 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 105 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

For the Encanto Project twelve Joy Model 12HM36 drum miners have been selected 
for development and panel mining use.  These machines have a cutting height range 
of 4.615 m (15 ft, 2 in) down to 2.095 m (6 ft, 10 in).  Drum miners can be operated 
by remote control and can be equipped with computer systems for providing machine 
maintenance diagnostics and operating data to control centers in other parts of the 
mine or on surface. 

It is contemplated that eight of the Joy Model 12HM36 drum miners will be used in 
mining panels, two will be working in development headings and the remaining 
machines will either be getting overhauled or on standby. 

Cutting data for the Joy 12HM36 drum miners are: 

 Cutting drum width 4.11 m (13.5 feet) 

 Maximum cutting height 4.61 m (15.1 feet) 

 Minimum cutting height 2.1 m (6.9 feet) 

It is expected most mine entries will be cut two cutting drum widths wide (i.e. 
approximately 8.22 m or 27 ft wide). 

A new mining machine has recently started production and should be evaluated.  
This is the Sandvik MC470, a 115 t machine which is heavier than the Joy models 
and quieter.  This machine can cut while the cutting head is moving upwards – drum 
miners usually only cut while the cutting head is moving down.  The Sandvik MC470 
is radio remote controlled and has low cutting head rotation speed to reduce dust.  

Cutting data for the MC470 are: 

 Cutting drum width 3.76 m (12.33 feet) 

 Machine chassis width 3.36 m (11.02 feet) 

 Maximum cutting height 5 m (16.4 feet) 

 Minimum cutting height 2.4 m (7.87 feet) 

These machines can be fitted with Sandvik Mobile Bolter units which may be an 
asset in the Encanto situation.  Sandvik make three other models known as the 
Sandvik Bolter Miner MB700 series which are heavier, wider machines equipped with 
rock bolting machines on both sides. 

For roadway and sidewall maintenance in travel ways and conveyor entries two Joy 
Model 14CM9C machines have been included.  These machines are low enough to 
be able to operate underneath roof suspended conveyors to cut out heaved floor. 

Cutting data for the Joy 14CM9C drum miners are: 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 106 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

 Cutting drum width 3.3 ms (10.9 ft) 

 Maximum cutting height 3.1 m (10.1 ft) 

 Minimum cutting height 0.98 m (3.1 ft) 

All main conveyors will use roof suspended conveyor structure and sufficient units 
have been included in the estimate to permit 5,000 ft to be the design maximum 
length for each conveyor (belt joint problems tend to increase when conveyors longer 
than this are operated).  The main underground conveyor will use 137 cm (54") 
belting, all main branch conveyors will use 122 cm (48") belting and all panel 
conveyors will use low-profile floor mounted conveyors with 107 cm (42") belting. 

Every mining unit will be equipped with a Stamler breaker feeder to ensure even 
conveyor loading.  

Battery powered Joy ore-haulers complete with three 240 volt batteries per hauler 
and charging stations have been included for use with development mining 
machines.  Batteries can be changed by the car operator without assistance and it is 
normal for ore haulers to operate for a whole shift using only one battery. 

Robo-trams made by Prairie Machine (300 ft long trains) have been included for use 
in each mining panel.  The Robo-tram trains can be made longer by purchasing 
additional sections but rock mechanics considerations may limit the width of chevron 
panels. 

OTHER EQUIPMENT 

The following equipment will also be required for mine operation: 

 Two roadheader-type mining machines (e.g.  Sandvik MR300 or larger) 

 Road grader 

 Personnel carriers, typically 12 Kubotas or Toyota Landcruiser 

 LHD units typically 3 x 6 yd3, 2 x 3 yd3. 

 Mobile crane 

 Rough terrain forklifts, one per mining unit. 

 Lube truck, welder's truck, mechanic's truck, roadway watering truck 

 First Aid vehicle for carrying stretchers 

 Rock bolters, four

Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

 Multipurpose Vehicles have previously been mentioned – special purpose 
cassettes for use with these vehicles (examples would be belt winding 
cassettes; personnel carrying modules; toilet modules etc. can be purchased 
for lower cost than buying dedicated vehicles). 

16.2.3 UNDERGROUND ORE STORAGE 

It is customary in Saskatchewan potash mines to provide approximately eight hours 
hoisting capacity in raw ore storage.  In the Muskowekwan case it is recommended 
that 8,000 t of raw ore capacity be provided.  There are several types of storage in 
use and for estimating purposes it has been assumed four 2,000 t capacity circular 
bins will be constructed.  Unfortunately underground raw ore storage bins in 
Saskatchewan potash mines have a history of being problematic and very few have 
lasted more than twenty years.  Apart from circular bins there have been slot type 
bins and in drift raw ore storage facilities.  Because there is a competent salt beam 
over the top of the Lower Patience Lake potash bed this will make a suitable upper 
horizon for construction of an in drift ore storage.  The floor of the ore storage area 
could be the normal mining floor when mining in the Belle Plaine formation. The main 
underground raw ore storage will not be required immediately.  It can be excavated 
and prepared during the first six months of production. 

16.2.4 MINE VENTILATION 

MAIN UNDERGROUND FANS 

Two fans will be located near the bottom of the production shaft forcing return air up 
the shaft.  Two identical fans will be installed near the bottom of the service shaft 
forcing intake air into the workings. 

Note: Only one intake and one return air fan will need to be installed initially.  They 
will produce adequate ventilation for perhaps eight years at which time the remaining 
fans will be installed. 

MINE AIR HEAT 

Two 19 million BTU direct fired natural gas mine air heaters will be installed at the 
entrance to the intake ventilation tunnel outside the service headframe.  This unit will 
incorporate fans to draw the air past the burners.  If the mine start-up coincides with 
cold weather it will be necessary to commission the mine air heaters immediately.  
The two shafts are linked underground.  It will not be necessary to operate both mine 
air heaters during the first two winters of operation as the ventilating air quantities will 
be within the capabilities of one unit. 

Note: Mine air heat in potash mines is mainly intended to keep the tubbing in the 
shaft at a near steady temperature as this prevents leaks.  The mine workings 
underground are warm enough even in extreme winter temperatures. 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 108 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

MINE SURFACE FANS 

At the top of the ventilation tunnel coming out of the production shaft there will be two 
(2) axial flow fans of the same capacity as the main underground units. 

Note: The steelwork around the fan perimeter housing should be insulated as ice on 
fan blades has been known to result in fan blade failure. 

The main surface fans and the main underground fans will have the design capability 
to use several sizes of electric motor together with a range of drive pulley sizes.  
Fans selected will have adjustable blades to provide a range of duty capability. 

SERVICE HEADFRAME ACCESS TUNNELS 

In order to permit workers and staff to move freely between the mine offices, dry, first 
aid and mine rescue facilities and the service headframe service tunnels will be 
constructed. 

16.2.5 MINE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL 

The Encanto Project as envisaged will operate with four production crews and nine 
mining machines will be operated each eight hour shift.  The mine and mill will be 
down for eight hours on dayshift Wednesdays and there will be no production crews 
on site during that shift.  The Wednesday dayshift will be used for essential process 
plant maintenance.  The construction crew in the mine will carry out conveyor 
extensions, conveyor idler and belt joint replacement plus other essential work which 
cannot be done during operations. 

Each shift crew will be supervised by a Mine Captain who reports to the General 
Mine Foreman and through him to the Mine Superintendent.  Three shift bosses will 
report to each Mine Captain.  Each shift boss will supervise the crews on three 
mining machines.  Total mine department manpower 224 comprises of 47 salaried 
staff, 173 hourly paid production employees including shift mechanics and 
electricians on shift work.  There will be 49 maintenance and construction employees 
working dayshift only. 

Note: Productivity measured as tonnes mined per manshift will not be as high as is 
experienced in mines where the equipment is able to cut continuously without the 
need to back up as is required when cutting chevron type panels.  Similarly mines 
operating in the Esterhazy formation are able to mine very wide rooms, which is 
conducive to high productivity.  There will also be higher labour requirements 
because of the need to do more floor and back rehabilitation because of the mine 
depth.

Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

16.2.6 SHAFT PILLAR FACIL IT IES 

MAIN MECHANICAL WORKSHOP 

The main mechanical workshop will be at least 100 m long and incorporate a 20 t 
travelling crane.  There will be welding areas and offices for foremen and 
maintenance planners. 

DIESEL WORKSHOP 

A diesel workshop large enough to accommodate approximately twelve (12) diesel 
powered units (up to LHD size) for maintenance will be excavated. 

ELECTRICAL WORKSHOP 

An electrical workshop large enough to accommodate the largest power sleds used 
in the mine will be required.  Space will also be required for cable storage and repair. 

UNDERGROUND WAREHOUSE 

An underground parts warehouse with computer links to the surface warehouse will 
be required.  The warehouse will have its own forklift. 

UNDERGROUND LUBE STATION 

An underground lube station will be required.  It will be located so that if there is a fire 
the products of combustion are not taken into the mine workings.  The lube station 
will be equipped with automatic self-closing doors, open-door alarms, foam fire 
suppression system, spill collection. 

The lube station will have capacity for three days' supply of hydraulic oil, gear oil and 
diesel fuel. 

Diesel fuel, hydraulic oil and gear oil will be transported from the surface tank farm to 
the underground lube station in 2,000 L tank trailers.  Grease will be transported in 
kegs. 

UNDERGROUND MAIN PUMP STATION 

The main pump station will be designed with the objective of capturing all spillage 
and leakage from pipe joints. 

Three storage and collection tanks will be installed with the objective of settling 
coarse material.  The tanks will be designed for easy cleaning. 

Two oilfield type triplex pumps will be installed.  The intention will be to have 
sufficient capacity that only one pump would normally be required to operate for a 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 110 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment   
 

limited number of hours each day.  The second pump would be standby and for use 
when the other pump required maintenance. 

Fibreglass piping will be used in the shaft water discharge line as it has been found 
to be longer lasting and easier to install than steel pipe.  The manufacturer has 
developed the capability to manufacture this pipe in 6" diameter and it now has an 
adequate pressure rating to permit single stage pumping. 

There will be small pumps at the bottom of each shaft to pump water which has fallen 
down the shaft to the main pump station. 

UNDERGROUND OFFICES,  TRAIN ING ROOMS 

Underground offices, training rooms, computer and communication facilities will be 
required. 

Saskatchewan potash mines are equipped with comprehensive computer, control 
and communication systems.  The Muskowekwan project should be designed along 
similar lines. 

Air conditioning is considered normal in underground offices. 

UNDERGROUND REFUGE STATION 

An underground refuge station will be established in the shaft pillar area. This station 
will be air- tight to prevent smoke entry and will be equipped with communications 
equipment, drinking water, lighting, toilet facilities, basic furnishings and blankets and 
first aid equipment to permit personnel to take shelter in the event of a fire 
underground.  The refuge station will be established in an area normally ventilated by 
intake air and have an emergency air supply. 

Several more refuge stations will be required several years after mine start-up.

16.3.2 ASSUMPTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS 

GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS 

The following assumptions are derived from general accepted solution mining 
parameters based on the local geology, adjusted to this project for the deposit 
characteristics of temperature, KCl content, and bed thickness. These parameters 
will require verification in the subsequent phases though detailed test work and 
analysis. 

Table 16.1 lists all the general assumptions that have been used in preparing this 
Section.

AVERAGE GRADE AND THICKNESS 

North Rim`s NI 43-101 Technical Report is the basis for the assumed grade and 
thickness for the solution mining scoping study.  Table 16.2 shows the average 
thickness and grade for the Indicated Resource.  The average K2O grade between 
the base of the Belle Plaine Member (BP) and top of the Patience Lake Member (PL)

is low at 13.5%.  That is because there is an unusually large barren zone between 
the BP and the PL.  Further studies may result in adopting a solution mining 
procedure that drops the 5 to 6 m of low-grade inter-burden and, thereby, mines only 
the BP and PL.  If there is a mud layer at the base of the PL this may work, otherwise 
getting a fracture to occur at the bottom of the PL may be difficult.  Figure 16.1 shows 
the KCl grade and MgO profiles from the five exploration wells.

CAVERN TEMPERATURE 

There is little data available regarding cavern temperature at this time.  In the future, 
drilling temperature logs will be included in one or more holes after a delay from 
drilling of 12 to 24 hours.  At the moment, it is assumed that the formation 
temperature is 38°C.  The injection temperature will be at least 75°C or higher so that 
the produced brine can be assumed to be close to 65°C during primary mining.  
During secondary mining, the cavern temperature may decline because the flow to 
the cavern is lower and this may have an effect on the production rate during 
secondary mining. Studies will need to be conducted in this area including heating 
and recirculation during secondary mining. 

MINING METHOD AND HORIZONS 

The mining horizons will be Belle Plaine and Patience Lake.  The Esterhazy is 
containing carnallite, which will hamper its use for potash production.  The big 
question will be if the inter-burden between the BP and the PL is mined. As noted 
above, the inter-burden is thick and of low grade, so mining it will reduce the brine 
feed grade for the plant feed.  Three alternatives exist: (a) hyrofrac, (b) developing a 
sump under the PL would be very time-consuming but that would be the backup 
strategy, or (c) mine the inter burden but waste the brine to the disposal wells. 

RESOURCE 

The resources as stated by North Rim will be the basis for design.  They have a 
conservative position with buffers around the anomalies and townships.  In later 
design phases, areas where the dip of the Second Red Bed is over a cut-off value, 
say 3% to 6%, would be excluded; this might result in an increase in resource.  There 
is sufficient resource identified by the five drill holes to justify moving forward. 

16.3.3 PROCESS DESCRIPTION 

The following is a description of the infrastructure and equipment required at the site 
and within the brine field to support the solution mining portion of the project.   

INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN  PLANT LIMITS 

All storage tanks and pumps required for the operation of the brine field will be 
located within a designated tank farm area that will be developed within the limits of 
the processing facility site.  

The infrastructure and equipment required at the plant site would consist of: 

 Cold solvent (water) storage tanks 

 Hot solvent (water) storage tanks 



  

 Encanto Potash Corporation 115 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

 Production brine tanks 

 Waste brine tanks 

 Blanket oil storage tanks 

 Cold water transfer pumps 

 Primary mining hot solvent pumps 

 Cavern development pumps 

 Secondary mining brine pumps 

 Blanket oil distribution pumps 

 Waste brine injection pumps 

 Heat recovery exchanger (depending upon final design) 

 Hot solvent heater 

The cold water tank will store all water required to supply the solution mining 
operations. Sources of the water would be industrial water provided by Saskwater, 
recovered rain water, process condensate, cooling tower blow down, and possibly 
weak return brine from underperforming caverns.  

The cold water transfer pumps will take water from this tank and direct it through a 
heat recovery heat exchanger (depending upon the process), then on to the steam 
heater to bring the water up to the temperature required up to the design point 
required for solution mining.  From the heater, the water is directed to four multi-
stage centrifugal injection pumps for primary mining, with three pumps in operation, 
and one acting as a stand-by. 

The pumps for cavern development will also be connected to the cold solvent tanks, 
where two multi-stage centrifugal injection pumps will be installed, each at 
approximately 60% of the required capacity.  In the event of a pump failure, the 
cavern development can be reduced or even stopped for a short time without 
impacting the overall cavern development schedule 

The oil blanket storage tank and pumps will be located within the diked berm of the 
plant diesel oil storage tank. The oil is supplied to the wells though a piping network 
in order to control the upward development of the caverns during their development 
and operation.  

NaCl saturated brine recovered from the crystallization pond will be stored in the 
saturated brine tank, and pumped by three multi-stage centrifugal injection pumps 



  

 Encanto Potash Corporation 116 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

(two in operation, one back-up) to the caverns that are designated to undergo 
secondary mining after the primary mining of these caverns has been completed.  

From the brine field, the returning production brine will pass through an oil separator 
to remove any blanket oil that may have returned with the brine to avoid fouling of the 
heat exchange surfaces within the crystallization plant.  From the oil separator, the 
brine is discharged into the production brine storage tank. 

The waste brine returning from the brine field will be accumulated in a dedicated 
buffer storage tank, and re-injected into the deadwood aquifer. 

BRINE FIELD 

An estimated 3.6 km main piping network will be routed from the plant through the 
brine field to service the first 45 caverns to be developed.  The pipeline will consist of 
seven pipes buried at a depth of 2.5 m, and will comprise of the following: 

Table 16.3  Main Pipeline Header Details 

Fluid Function Pipe Details 

Hot solvent Primary mining 20" lined carbon steel 

Cold solvent Cavern development 14" lined carbon steel 

NaCl saturated brine Secondary Mining 16" lined carbon steel 

Production brine   Directed to production storage tank 20" lined carbon steel 

Secondary brine Directed to the crystallization ponds 16" lined carbon steel 

Disposal brine Directed to the re-injection wells 14" lined carbon steel 

Blanket oil Control development of cavern 2" stainless steel 

 
It should be noted that although the estimate is based on a buried main pipeline, a 
study needs to be conducted to evaluate the alternative of having the header run on 
the surface using heat tracing.  
 
The initial brine field will consist of five well operating platforms, each featuring 18 
wells that are to be directionally drilled from the platform, creating nine caverns each.  
The main pipeline will be routed equidistant between the groups of nine caverns in 
order to rationalize the piping requirements between the main pipeline header and 
the caverns. 
 
In order to minimize the piping requirements, and centralize the cavern operations, 
each set of nine operating caverns will feature a valve station building of 
approximately 8 m x 40 m located in proximity to each well platform.  All valves and 
instrumentation associated with each wellhead pad will be located within the 
buildings, and allow for the operations group to adjust flows rates, perform reverse 
flushing or isolate caverns from one location.  From the valve station building, two 4" 
carbon steel lines will be routed to the inner and outer leach string connections on 
the wellhead, and a 1" stainless oil line for the oil blanket.

16.3.4 BRINE COMPOSIT ION 

The following section has been prepared in conjunction with Agapito and associates 
and Norbert Gruschow of NG consulting based on pertinent and applicable 
experience in this field.    

CAVERN TEMPERATURE 

Cavern temperatures will be maintained at 65°C for the scoping study.  Preliminary 
calculations indicate the cavern temperature can be maintained at 65°C, with fluids 
injected into the cavern at a rate of approximately 40 m3/hr at a temperature of 75°C.  
The return temperature and brine composition from each cavern will be monitored to 
ensure that the returning brine as a whole meets the needs of the processing plant. 

KCI/NACI  CONTENT 

Average brine grades should be maintainable at 75% of saturation in KCl and 100% 
in NaCl at 65°C.  This is approximately 155 g/l KCl and 240 g/l for NaCl.  This is an 
estimated average after the start of mining and does not consider the impact of the 
low-grade inter burden between the BP and Pl.  This low grade zone is mitigated by 
the installation of spare caverns, as this will allow at any time during operation to 
reduce the brine flow for a certain number of caverns, when mining in such zones.  
This turn down on spare low performing caverns allows the brine from these to be 
blended with the other richer caverns, making the overall brine grade and volume 
remain within specification, even if some are mining the inter-burden. 

MAXIMUM SIZE OF CAVERN 

The maximum size of the caverns will be designed after some creep and 
geotechnical test data becomes available.  For the scoping study, a cavern shape 
and size has been selected similar to that adopted by other current projects and 
operations in the vicinity of this project.  

The differences are minor where Encanto is at a shallower depth, lower overall 
cavern height, and lower temperature.  The geotechnical data such as the creep 
rates of the salt and potash are unknown and the condition of the Second Red Bed is 
unknown; these parameters impact the maximum cavern dimensions.  The cavern 
size for the scoping study is shown in Figure 16.2, with spacing between wells of 80 
m and a cavern radius from each well of 75 m for a cavern area of approximately 
29,000 m2.  This may be expanded later after further studies.

Figure 16.2  Cavern Configuration 

 
 

PILLAR SIZ ING 

The pillar sizes also are influenced by the depth, creep properties, in-situ 
temperature and cavern height; these aspects are favorable for Encanto.  The 
dimensions selected for Encanto are 80 m resulting in a uniform extraction ratio of 
approximately 40%. 

The completion details for the production wells are shown in Figure 16.3.  Figure 
16.4 shows the arrangement of nine caverns drilled from a single pad.  Each well will 
be directionally drilled as per the illustration in Figure 16.4.  The well is simple and 
assumes that the well can be drilled blind after placement of the surface casing.  If 
ground conditions are unfavourable, then an additional casing may be required, in 
which case larger surface casing would also be required so the final casing placed to 
the base of the BP Member is 7".

BRINE FIELD LAYOUT 

The brine field layout consists of roads and pipelines to each of the pads.  The main 
pipeline header would be 3.6 km long, with 375 m branch line from the main headers 
to the individual wellhead valve station buildings.

16.3.5 UTIL IT IES AND WASTE GENERATION 

ESTIMATED WATER CONSUMPTION 

Tables 16.3 and 16.4 list primary and secondary mining parameters for wellfield 
production.  The total number of wells to produce 2 million tonnes of K60 (60% K2O 
or 95% KCl) is approximately 45 caverns in operation.  The water consumption 
during mining is approximately 450 m3/hr with injection rate of 2,000 m3/hr, and 
production rate of 1,550 m3/hr.  This does not account for water losses in the plant or 
in the cracking pond.  Secondary mining concentrations may not be as high as 
primary mining because of cooling in the cavern if the flow is reduced.  One option if 
this occurs is to re-circulate the product from one cavern back into the cavern or 
another after reheating the brine back to 75°C.

The energy requirements for solvent heating for the solution mining operation are

 Secondary mining  GJ/hr 270 

ESTIMATED WASTE BRINE PRODUCTION 

Waste brine is produced during sump development.  Approximately 100,000 tonnes 
of salt is produced to develop the sump, to connect the wells, and to develop the 
cavern roof before potash mining begins.  An injection rate of approximately 1,400 
m3/hr is required to develop the 45 caverns in the year before production begins.  At 
a steady state when 20 or so wells need to be developed per year, a total injection 
rate of 1,200 m3/hr is required in the wellfield. 

ESTIMATED NACI WASTE GENERATION AND BACKFILL  STRATEGY 

The total salt produced during primary mining is expected to be 2.9 million tonnes per 
year.  This does not include the salt produced during sump development as all that 



  

 Encanto Potash Corporation 125 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

salt will remain as brine and will be disposed of by injection into the saline aquifers.  
If the inter-burden between the BP and Pl is mined, the overall ratio of KCl to NaCl in 
the brine will decline and more NaCl will be produced.  All attempts should be made 
to avoid mining the inter-burden between BP and PL.  Backfilling is a problem with 
solution mining because of the flat nature of the caverns and the timing of any 
potential backfill.  Backfilling would best be placed after completion of secondary 
mining, and that may be many years after completion of primary mining.  The salt 
must be stored on surface and by the time secondary mining is complete, the 
caverns may have converged or collapsed.  For preliminary planning such as in this 
scoping study, no backfilling is assumed. 

16.3.6 CAPITAL  COST ESTIMATE 

BASIS  OF ESTIMATE 

The capital estimate presented here is pertaining to direct costs and include all 
materials and labour needed to purchase and install the required equipment, piping, 
electrical and controls for this area.  The estimate is therefore not including the 
following indirect costs: 

 EPCM costs 

 Owner's costs 

 Start-up costs 

 Contingency 

 Escalation and risk 

All costs presented are plant sub area based and include all disciplines required.   

PLANT SITE 

It is estimated that the installed cost of the pumps located at the plant site to support 
the solution mining operations is in the order of $21,200,000.  This would include all 
electrical connections and controls, the equipment bases and the building shelters to 
house the pumps. 

Approximately 1,000 m of each size of pipe would be required for the piping 
interconnections within the plant, and to get to the fence limits of the brine field.  The 
cost of this piping would be in the order of $14,000,000. 

DRILL ING PADS 

The five drilling and operating pads will cost approximately $560,000 each, and 
would accommodate 18 wells, resulting in a cost per well of approximately $31,000.  



  

 Encanto Potash Corporation 126 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

The pads would consist of a concrete base adequate to support the work over rigs, 
with all piping from the valve buildings to the wellheads routed under the slab, and 
coming up through the slab in proximity to the wellhead in order to keep the area 
clear for work-overs. 

DRILL ING 

Drilling costs will be in the $1.1 to 1.2 million range per well.  This accounts for 
directional drilling, and includes the cost of conductor pipes, cemented casings and 
leach strings.  This cost would not include the overhead expenses of operations 
management and geologist's supervision. 

PIPELINES 

The main pipeline header will be installed underground at approximately 2.5 m deep. 
The length of the main pipeline header is 3.6 km, and includes. 

Table 16.7  Main Pipeline Header Details 

Fluid Function Pipe Details 

Hot solvent Primary mining 20"  lined carbon steel 

Cold solvent Cavern development 14"  lined carbon steel 

NaCl saturated brine Secondary Mining 16"  lined carbon steel 

Production brine   Directed to production storage tank 20"  lined carbon steel 

Secondary brine Directed to the crystallization ponds 16"  lined carbon steel 

Disposal brine Directed to the re-injection wells 14"  lined carbon steel 

Blanket oil Control development of cavern 2" stainless steel 

 
It is estimated that the pipeline header would be approximately $7,200,000 per km, 
including all earthworks, trenching and adjoining road network. 

BRANCH LINE PIP ING 

The branch line piping from the main pipeline to the valve station building would 
consist of the same seven pipes that are on the main pipeline header, and would be 
sized to accommodate the flows required for the group of caverns.  The pipes are to 
be buried at 2.5 m deep, with the distance from the main pipeline to the valve station 
building in the order of 345 m.  From the valve station building to the individual 
wellheads, 4" carbon steel lines will be routed to connect the inner and outer leach 
strings connections on the wellhead, as well as a 1" stainless oil line for the oil 
blanket.   

It is estimated that the branch line piping will cost in the order of $5,400,000 per 
group of nine caverns. 



  

 Encanto Potash Corporation 127 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

VALVE ARRANGEMENT 

The wellhead valve station building will consist of a closed, insulated and heated 
structure that will shelter the valve headers and controls associated with each of the 
nine caverns.  The approximate cost of the building would be in the order of 
$900,000 each, including all civil, structural, and electrical work for the building.  

The cost estimate of the valve trees for each cavern, and the piping headers would 
be in the order of $7,000,000 for each group, and would include all pipes, supports, 
valves, instrumentation and controls. 

WELL HEADS 

Well heads are estimated at $13,000 each, and are supplied with connections to the 
inner and outer leach strings, and the oil blanket system.  The unit will come with a 
'pup' piece to attach to the 9-5/8" cemented casing, and allow for the proper height 
for the work over rig.  

The injection pressure at the wellhead should be at least 3 MegaPascals (MPa) to 
provide the pressure to lift the product to the surface with a pressure of 0.5 MPa at 
the surface of the production well. 

DISPOSAL WELLS 

In the vicinity of this area in Saskatchewan, two wells drilled into the Deadwood 
Formation are normally sufficient for early brine disposal.  Additional research is 
required to confirm that the Deadwood Formation exists in this exact area, and that it 
is thick and has the same characteristics as in the western areas.  These wells are 
deeper and larger than the solution mining wells and cost approximately $2 million 
each.

16.3.7 OPERATING COST ESTIMATE 

DRILL ING AND WORK OVER 

The average annual wellfield operating cost will ramp up from the start-up year until 
year three. Here, it will remain steady as the major cost associated with the brine 
field is the drilling of replacement wells.  Caverns will only be abandoned after 
primary and secondary mining has been completed roughly after about four years.   

The brine field labour force is responsible for planning, managing, and operating the 
wellfield.  Operational duties would include heavy construction associated with 
production facilities (roads, pads, and pipelines), operating solution wells (installing 
well heads, changing downhole tubulars, regulating oil caps, monitoring), and system 
maintenance (pumps, valves, power lines, roads, pipelines).  The operating cost 
assumes that replacement wells will be drilled by contractors with a separate well 
drilling labor force, which is included in the replacement well cost.   

The labor force will consist of: 

 A 12-person salaried employee dedicated to the wellfield operations and 
includes a wellfield manager, foremen, geologist, well engineer, 
environmental coordinator, surveyors, and technicians.  General 
administrative staff and plant personnel are not included in the wellfield 
operating cost; 



  

 Encanto Potash Corporation 129 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

 A 52-person hourly wellfield labor force including well tenders, work-over rig 
operators, heavy equipment operators, pump operators, electricians, 
mechanics, and general laborers.  This labor force will include operational 
and maintenance activities for the area.  

The Operating Cost Estimate (OPEX) projected from year 1 going forward is detailed 
below. 

Table 16.9  Wellfield Annual Operating Cost Summary 

Description Cost 

Replacement wells (20 per year) $ 24,000,000 

Maintenance materials (2% of the capital) $ 5,130,000 

Salary $1,238,000  

Labor $3,000,000  

Utilities (not included here as it is supplied by the main plant) -- 

Cavern rehabilitation $ 1,000,000 

Total  $34,368,000 

 

BRINE FIELD REHABIL ITATION 

After the plant has been in operation for 7 to10 years, caverns will start to be 
abandoned.  After all caverns associated with a group of caverns have been mined 
out, the area surrounding the drill pad will be rehabilitated, and a cavern monitoring 
program implemented.  The rehabilitation will consist of cementing and capping the 
well, removal of the drill pad and the valve station building, as well as the associated 
underground piping and road network. Any contaminated soil would be remediated, 
and vegetation planted. 

16.3.8 SOLUTION MIN ING SCHEDULE 

The brine field development would start with the preparation of the road network 
within the brine field, and the completion of the drilling platforms.  

The drilling of a typical well is expected to take approximately 15 days each, so one 
drill rig would complete a group of 18 well in about ten (10) months.  At the present 
time, the schedule shows two drill rigs operating for a period of approximately 20 
months to complete the first four cavern groups of 36 caverns.  

The water supply pipeline to the plant, the plant site infrastructure of tanks pumps 
etc, and the pipelines and valve stations to the wells must be complete in parallel to 
the drilling in order to commence the cavern development as soon the drilling has 
been completed.  The cavern development would take approximately one year to 
complete the undercut leaching, join the wells, and expose an area large enough for 
solution mining purposes.  



  

 Encanto Potash Corporation 130 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

After cavern development is complete, it will take approximately one month of hot 
solvent injection prior to heating up the cavern adequately to produce a production 
brine that is acceptable to be directed to the crystallization plant.  During this period, 
the brine will be re-circulated to the heater, and back to the caverns. 

The total duration of the schedule for the brine field is approximately three years.    

In order to accelerate the schedule, three rigs could be mobilized to drill the 
production wells in parallel. 

The table below will provide an estimate of the required capital expenditure in terms 
of capital and operating costs, starting at the start of the project, and going into the 
operation.  The capital cost has been estimated at being expended during the first 
two years of the project, as the caverns are required to be initiated (developed) one 
year before the plant start-up.  The OPEX is estimated to be minimal during cavern 
development and, and then increases as the work force is expanded.  Drilling costs 
are only being incurred on year 3 and thereafter, the OPEX will remain at the nominal 
value of $34,368,000. 

Table 16.10 below provides the capital and operating cost ramp up as the project 
status into the implementation phase (year -3) and moves into start-up at year 0, and 
thereafter.

16.3.9 SCOPE OF WORK FOR THE NEXT PHASE 

The following activities are recommended to be completed within a pre-feasibility 
study phase if the option for solution mining is selected for further development. 

TRADE-OFF STUDIES 

The following trade-off studies are recommended to be carried out within the scope 
of the pre-feasibility study: 

Solut ion Min ing 

 Cavern temperature and brine grade increase from 50°C to 70°C; 

 Resource versus brine grade. This trade-off looks at making selective cuts of 
higher grade resource, leaving marginal areas behind versus taking larger 
cuts maximizing resource; 



  

 Encanto Potash Corporation 131 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

 Mining sequence and its effect on work-over plan; 

 Primary versus secondary mining, timeline, and capacity; 

 Waste brine disposal study. 

Crysta l l iza t ion 

 Crystallization trade off, including multi affect evaporator versus mechanical 
vapour recompression and hybrid systems.  

 Integration of solution mining with crystallizers, including trade off of brine 
temperature input and its effect of evaporation rate 

Other  P lant  Areas 

 Power generation versus power purchase; 

 Combined cycle plant, HRSG, or separate stream and power generation. 

 Water supply study 

 Product grade (standard versus granulated) 

 Logistics and transport study 

 Port storage study 

Test  Work 

After having cores available from exploration drilling, rock mechanical test work will 
need to be performed in order to provide a basis to design the maximum dimensions 
as well as pillar sizes.  

A second set of cores will also be required for dissolution test work to provide the 
project with the estimated brine grade, cavern production flow, and temperature. 

Other  Tasks 

Design work in all areas of the plant will then commence to provide for the data 
required to prepare a Class 4 AACE capital cost estimate.

17.1.1 CRUSHING 

Potash ore will be crushed to an acceptable size for release of insoluble material in 
the first stage of attrition scrubbing. 

Potash ore enters the crushing circuit, having been reclaimed or supplied from ore 
storage.  Size reduction takes place in a closed circuit, two stage screening, 
consisting of scalping screens for initial screening, sizing screens for further sizing, 
impactors and roll crushers utilized for size reduction of oversize material from both 
screening stages.  Impactor discharge and screen undersize material from sizing 
screens are fed to a fine ore bin acting as feed capacitor to mill feed. 

Typical Major Equipment Anticipated: 

 Impact Crushers (Hammer Mills) 

 Coarse Single Deck Screens 

 Roll Crushers 

 Sizing Multi-Deck Screens 

 Bucket Elevators 

 Drag Conveyors 

 Vibratory Feeders 

 Bins 

 Dust Abatement Systems 

In the next project stages, core samples must be obtained and utilized to determine 
the most effective crushers to be incorporated in the mill.  Appropriate reduction 
ratios for each type of crusher needs to be determined to maximize efficiency in the 
subsequent wet milling circuits.  Optimum sizing and style of crushers need to be 
determined considering expected mine supplied size distribution, characteristics of 
the ore/crystal reduction techniques, and experience of crusher suppliers in Potash 
service.  Maximizing the on-size material and limiting over/under sizes will minimize 



        

 Encanto Potash Corporation 133 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

the equipment and energy requirements of the crushing plant while maximizing 
recovery in downstream wet milling. 

17.1.2 SCRUBBING AND DESLIMING 

Attrition scrubbing and desliming are required to liberate insoluble clay from potash 
ore, which will affect the consumption of reagents and ore recovery if not effectively 
removed.  The circuit consists of attrition scrubbers, screens and hydro cyclones. 
Fine ore is conveyed from the fine ore bin to a tank where it is slurried with addition 
of saturated KCl process brine.  Slurry is pumped from the tank to first stage attrition 
scrubbers for removal of insoluble clay from potash ore.  Clay is removed by intense 
scrubbing.  The scrubbed ore is pumped to wet screens oversize returned to first 
stage attrition scrubber undersize to the desliming hydrocyclones for initial slimes 
removal.  The cyclone splits are underflow to secondary attrition scrubbing, overflow 
to slimes thickening.  Slurry from second stage attrition scrubbing is pumped to multi-
deck, wet, desliming screens, oversize to coarse conditioning drum, undersize 
pumped to desliming hydro cyclones.  The cyclones remove the bulk of the slimes 
present through the overflow stream which is then pumped slimes thickening, the 
cyclone underflow (U/F) is fed to fines conditioning launder. 

Typical Major Equipment Anticipated: 

 Attrition Scrubbers 

 Hydro Cyclones 

 Wet Screens 

 Centrifugal Slurry Pumps 

 Pump Boxes 

 Rotary Drum Conditioners 

 Distribution Boxes 

 Knife Gate Valves 

 "Tech Taylor" Valves 

In the next project stages, lab testing utilizing material from crushing tests of core 
samples should be used to determine optimum sizing of the attrition scrubbers and 
hydrocyclone and screen separation cut sizes.  Optimum sizing of this equipment will 
maximize insoluble release resulting in reduced equipment and energy requirements 
in the concentrating process and minimizing reagent costs/consumption.

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

17.1.3 CONCENTRATION 

Concentration of the potash ore involves separating of KCl from salt and then 
upgrading through multiple stages of flotation to an almost production grade. 

Feed from the coarse conditioning drum and the fines launder are collected in a 
pump box, diluted with process brine and frothing agent added.  The slurry is 
pumped to the first stage flotation cells, concentrate from this flotation flows to sieve 
bend screens, oversize reporting to concentrate leach, undersize to column flotation.  
Concentrate from columns flotation reports to concentrate leaching tanks, tails to 
cyclone tailings pump box.  

Tailings material from first stage flotation contains a coarse size fraction of KCl 
crystals locked to salt particles, requiring further liberation. 

The tailings reports to multi-deck, wet screens, as part the regrind stage of 
concentration.  Screen oversize material is crushed in wet cage mills then pumped to 
regrind cyclones; undersize is sent to tailing cyclones pump box.  Regrind cyclone 
under flow is directed to flotation cells, overflow is directed to salt tailings.  
Concentrate from regrind flotation is directed to a second stage of screening with 
multi-deck, wet screens.  The screen oversize material reports to concentrate leach 
tank, undersize materials reports to flotation column cells.  Tailings from first stage of 
regrind flotation are returned to regrind screen feed or tailings cyclones. 

Concentrate from regrind flotation columns is transferred to concentrate leach tanks, 
tailing are pumped tailings cyclone collection box. 

Typical Major Equipment Anticipated: 

 Flotation Machines and Tanks 

 Column Flotation Cells 

 Hydro Cyclones 

 Wet Screens 

 Centrifugal Slurry Pumps 

 Pumpboxes 

 Tanks 

 Wet Crushers (Cage Mills) 

In the upcoming project phase, lab testing is necessary to evaluate the configuration 
and capacity requirements for rougher, scavenger, and cleaner flotation equipment.  



        

 Encanto Potash Corporation 135 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

This evaluation will indicate the style of flotation equipment (column cells or flotation 
machines) to be used at each stage in the circuit, and which reagents are necessary. 

Dense media separation has not been considered and may be considered for a 
trade-off evaluation if ore crystal size is large. 

17.1.4 DEWATERING AND DRYING 

Flotation concentrates will be leached and centrifuged to separate concentrate from 
brine.  The drying stage will dry the centrifuged concentrate. 

Combined concentrates from flotation will be mixed with KCl rich brine in a leach 
circuit to reduce the level of NaCl in the final concentrate. 

The leached concentrates will be pumped to centrifuge feed tank that feeds four 
screen bowl centrifuges.  De-brined concentrate is discharged from centrifuges and 
is collected on drag conveyors.  Liquid from centrifuging is returned to flotation and 
concentrate leach circuit. 

Debrined product from the centrifuge is fed to two fluid bed dryers.  The dryer 
discharge is fed through a lump impactor to crush any lumps that are created during 
drying.  Exhaust from the dryer is handled by cyclones and product dryer quench 
scrubbers.   

Typical Major Equipment Anticipated: 

 Flotation Machines 

 Centrifugal Slurry Pumps 

 Pump Boxes 

 Hydro Cyclones 

 Screen Bowl Centrifuges 

 Drag Conveyors 

 Burners 

 Fluid Bed Dryers 

 Fans

 Tanks 

 Centrifugal Pumps 

Lab testing will allow for sizing and selection of flotation equipment in the leach 
circuit.  Sizing and selection of centrifuges, hydrocyclones, and dryers are not critical 
in the immediate next phases or project development.  Trade-off studies should be 
considered for alternative equipment such as: 

 Dryer flue gas heat recovery equipment 

 Baghouses versus Emission Scrubbers 

 Alternative dewatering equipment (drum filters, pressure filters, etc.) 

17.1.5 THICKENING 

The two waste streams from potash processing are thickened before disposal in 
tailing management area.  

The insoluble clays removed during the desliming and scavenging stages are 
thickened in the slimes thickener before deposit in fine tailings.  The O/F streams 
from desliming and scavenging cyclones are collected in slimes thickener feed tank, 
where they are further diluted with process water and flocculants added.  The 
thickener underflow is pumped to fine tailings, overflow is returned to process water. 

The salt streams from concentration (regrind screens undersize and regrind flotation 
tails) are collected in cyclone tailing pump box, pumped to tails cyclone under flow to 
salt tails pump box, overflow to salt thickener.  Regrinds cyclone O/F and scavenger 
column flotation underflow streams are also directed to salt thickener.  The thickener 
underflow stream is pumped to the salt tails pump box where the tails cyclone 
underflow is also collected, make up water added from many return water streams 
from the process. The slurry from the pump box is pumped to the salt tailings for 
disposal.  The overflow from the thickener is returned to flotation process brine tank. 

Typical Major Equipment Anticipated: 

 Centrifugal Slurry Pumps 

 Pumpboxes 

 Thickeners (Bridge/Rake/Tank) 

 Centrifugal Brine and Water Pumps 

 Tanks 



        

 Encanto Potash Corporation 137 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

In the upcoming project phases alternative technologies such as Inclined Plate 
(Lamella) thickeners should be investigated in comparison with conventional 
thickeners to reduce plant footprint and associated costs. 

Additionally, Evaporator/Crystallizer/Cooling Pond circuits should be investigated as 
a trade-off for increased product recovery against increased capital and operating 
costs (particularly energy costs). 

17.1.6 SCREENING AND COMPACTION 

Dried product from the production dryers is available for additional sizing and 
upgrading for market.  Product leaves the dryers hot and is a distributed size from 
fines to the largest size particle that can be floated (typically, 2 mm).  Product 
contains some residual clays and as such, is intended primarily for fertilizer.  The 
fertilizer industry prefers larger coarse particle sizes. 

Product leaving the driers is screened to a saleable – typically standard size 
(depends on the marketing strategy).  Fines and overs not achieving this size are 
upgraded to a premium coarse grade through compaction. 

Product from the dryers is elevated by bucket elevators to drag conveyors which 
distribute product to multi-deck screens.  On-spec product is collected by drag-
conveyor and transferred to a belt transferring standard size material to load out and 
storage. Dryer lumps are separated by grizzly screens, crushed and returned to the 
bucket elevators for re-screening.  

Oversize and fines particles are transferred by drag conveyor to the compaction plant 
for further upgrading to a premium product. 

Fresh feed from the screening circuit plus recycle from compaction fines are 
combined and elevated by bucket elevator to feed compactors.  Compactors force 
the loose product into a uniform sheet called flake which is then re-crushed and 
screened in a closed circuit.  Pn-spec screened premium granular product leaves the 
compaction recirculation circuit and is further upgraded in an annealing circuit.  The 
sharp edged friable product is slightly wetted and abraded then dried and further 
screened to produce a harder more durable product favorable for shipping and 
packaging.  Annealed product is then transferred by belt to loadout and storage. 

Typical Major Equipment: 

 Drag Conveyors 

 Bucket Elevators 

 Compactors with Force Feeders 

 Multi-Deck Screens 



        

 Encanto Potash Corporation 138 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

 Bins 

 Crushers 

 Fans 

 Burners 

 Fluid Bed Dryers 

 Fugitive Emission Scrubbers 

 Tanks 

 Centrifugal Pumps 

 Belt Conveyors 

Trade-off studies should be considered for the size of compactors used (for example, 
24X24" rolls versus 40X40" rolls), number of stages and style of crushers, heat 
recovery on dryer flues, baghouse versus scrubbers, and product cooling prior to 
transfer to loadout and storage. 

17.1.7 REAGENTS 

Reagents that will be utilized in process are listed below: 

COLLECTOR 

The collector (amine) coats the potash particles making it hydrophobic.  This allows 
air bubbles to attach to the potash particles aiding in separation from halite during 
flotation. 

PROCESS OIL 

Process oil is utilized to extend the hydrophobic properties of amine on potash 
particles. 

FROTHER 

Frother allows for reduction of surface tension of froth at the surface of flotation cells.  
Lowering the surface tension ensures the froth will not break up and drop out the 
floated potash particles. 



        

 Encanto Potash Corporation 139 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

DEPRESSANT 

The depressant reduces the ability of the clay material to absorb the reagents 
(collector and process oil) utilized in flotation.  If depressant is not utilized the clay 
material would float with potash particles and reduce concentrate grade. 

DISPERSANT 

Dispersant prevents fine particles from binding together during hydro classification so 
the particles remain in the fine stream. 

FLOCCULENT 

Flocculent is added during thickening to agglomerate small particles, improving 
clarification. 

ANTICAKING 

Anticake agent is added to final product to prevent caking during storage and 
handling by making particles water repellent. 

DUST CONTROL OIL 

Dust control oil is added to final to prevent dust release. 

17.1.8 LOADOUT AND STORAGE 

Final Product leaving the screening and compaction areas are dispatched by belt to 
large storage facilities and a loadout facility. 

Product can be direct fed to the loadout facility for immediate transport or bypassed 
to storage when shipping unit trains are un-available. 

Product bypassed to the storage area is treated with an amine/oil mixture to reduce 
clumping from ambient humidity while stored for extended periods.  Belt conveyors 
and trippers fill large product storage warehouses usually bee-hives or glulam 
horizontal structures.  Floor openings with grizzlies/hoppers feed to belt feeders, and 
a reclaim belt returns product from the warehouse to the loadout facility.  Large front 
bucket loaders are used to move remaining material to the grizzlies/hoppers. 

The loadout facility incorporates surge bins along with a final screening circuit to 
ensure on-spec loaded product.  Lump crushing is used to break any clumps from 
storage.   

Fines from product degradation and area are dust collection returned to the 
compaction circuit for product upgrading or dissolved and used in the wet milling 
system. 



        

 Encanto Potash Corporation 140 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

Immediately prior to rail car loading, material is treated with an amine/oil mixture to 
avoid clumping in rail/ship transport, and material is bulk weighed. 

Typical Major Equipment: 

 Belt Conveyors 

 Multi-Deck Screens 

 Crushers 

 Belt Feeders 

 Bulk weighing and hi-capacity loadout system 

 Track Scales 

 Cyclones 

 Baghouse 

 Bucket Elevators 

 Tanks 

 Gear Pumps 

 Oil Heaters 

 Bins 

 Bin Discharge Feeders 

In the next project phases, trade-off studies should be considered for the style and 
size of warehousing, and the style of bulk weighing and high speed loading 
equipment to be used. 

Of importance is the marketing of product and availability of railcar transport for your 
product to determine configuration of the loading and storage facilities. 

Selection of amine/oil chemicals should be analyzed for effect on compaction of 
material (resident on returned fines).

Crushing, desliming and concentration are not part of the solution mine process.  
Thickening, Dewatering and Drying Compaction and Product Handling will be the 
same as the conventional Mine process. 

17.2.1 EVAPORATION AND CRYSTALL IZATION 

Brine from primary mining is pumped to a series of evaporators and further to a 
series of crystallizers, major components of the solution mine processing plant. 

Brine is boiled in a series of multiple effect evaporators.  The brine enters the last 
stage evaporator, flowing counter current to evaporator steam. The NaCl is 
precipitated in the evaporators, clarified and then centrifuged to remove brine salt 
then sent to salt tailings. 

The high temperature overflow brine from the evaporators is sent to a KCI 
crystallization circuit. 

Crystallization of potassium chloride occurs in draft tube crystallizers.  The NaCl 
clarifier overflow is fed to first of multiple stages of crystallizers.  The flow feeds from 
one crystallizer to the next until the final stage.  Final product from the last crystallizer 
is sent to the dewatering and drying stage of process, brine from last stage is 
recycled to evaporator feed or cooling pond. 

Typical Major Equipment Anticipated: 

 Evaporator Condenser  

 Crystallizers 

 Heat Exchangers 

 Pumps 

 Thickener

17.3.1 WATER 

Water usage for conventional potash mines is generally around 1 m3/t of product. 
Solution Mining requires approximately 3 m3/t of product, but it does not have to be 
all fresh water.  Fresh water use includes: 

 Make up for floatation circuits 



        

 Encanto Potash Corporation 142 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

 Concentrate washing 

 General plant site use (lunch rooms, wash rooms, showers, etc.) 

 Boiler makeup 

 Miscellaneous Other 

SaskWater has been contacted and informed of the volume but they cannot confirm 
water source or costs at this time.  SaskWater would supply the water rights and 
install the supply line to the site.  Encanto would pay for the capital upgrades and a 
monthly user fee.  In the next project phase, SaskWater should be commissioned to 
study this issue and confirm the supply point, quality and cost.  A CAPEX allowance 
of $200 million has been included to cover this issue. 

17.3.2 NATURAL GAS 

An average yearly gas consumption of approximately 56,000,000 m3 of natural gas is 
required for the conventional mine and mill.  The solution mine and related mill would 
consume approximately 300,000,000 m3 of Natural Gas.  The natural gas will be 
supplied by Transgas. 

SaskEnergy has been contacted and has identified the nearest supply point.  A new 
150 mm line will feed the mine from Leross approximately 20 km away.  The existing 
Leross supply line will have to be looped by adding 80 km of 200 mm line back to a 
tie in point near Melville.  A 50 m2 parcel of land will be required onsite for the 
Transgas station.  The gas pressure at the station will be a minimum of 412 kpa.

to 4,160V for the ventilation fans.  This substation is complete with a dry type 
transformer and a solid state soft starter for the ventilation fan motors. 

1 8 . 2  R O A D S  A N D  D R A I N A G E  

The mine site is located in the typical Saskatchewan pothole landscape.  Rainfall 
runoff does not move by way of channels and streams.  Rainfall runoff simply travels 
down slopes to wet lands where the water either evaporates or seeps into the soil.  
Depending on the rainfall per year, the size of the wet lands varies significantly.  The 
mill site varies from elevation 670 m to 677 m.  The location of the mill will be in a 
relatively high area and runoff will flow to the North West towards a small pond lake 
between the reserve road and the CN rail. 

18.2.1 ACCESS HIGHWAYS 

All the main highways near the site are primary highways except for the 40 km 
portion of Highway 15 from Highway 6 to the mine site, which is a secondary 
highway.  The Highway 6 connects south to Regina and the Trans-Canada highway 
which connects all the main Canadian cities of Calgary, Regina, Winnipeg, etc.  



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 146 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

Highway 6 also connects north to Highway 16 which is a primary highway to connect 
the main northern Canadian prairie cities of Saskatoon and Edmonton.  A secondary 
highway allows the trucks to carry 20% less total load on their axial then does a 
primary highway. 

The secondary highway, Highway 15, is deteriorated significantly since little public 
dollars are allocated to fixing this highway since it currently has a small amount of 
traffic volume.  The highway is currently designated as a granular surface, which is 
topped with a graded seal aggregate with emulsion.  The actual surface of the 
highway is asphalt which has deteriorated asphalt and rough sub-surface every 
couple of kilometres and vehicles require to slow down to 30 or 50 km/hr.  The 
ministry of highways and infrastructure of Saskatchewan cannot say at this time what 
percentage of the entire cost of upgrading to highway surface to asphalt or upgrade 
the highway to a primary highway they will pay.  The ministry of highways and 
infrastructure of Saskatchewan estimates that the total cost of upgrading the highway 
surface to asphalt (the highway remains as a secondary highway) is approximately 
$300,000 to $350,000/km.  Upgrading the highway to a primary highway will 
approximately cost $400,000 to $450,000/km. 

18.2.2 SITE AND ACCESS ROADS 

The site access road will be 7.4 m wide and will be paved to connect Highway 15 to 
the mill.  Approximately 4 km of the site access road will be an upgrade of existing 
gravel roads and the last 1.8 km leading to the mill will be a completely new road.  
The parking staff and visitor parking lot will be paved with an area of approximately 
100 m by 60 m.  All other site roads will be unpaved 7.4 m wide.  There is 
approximately 2 km of site roads.  

The estimate includes an allowance for the upgrade of roads to the site from 
Highway 15 and building new roads to the site and on site.  It is based on a 
substructure of 250 mm granular material and 150 mm of asphalt. 

18.2.3 SITE DRAINAGE 

The proposed mill site slopes mainly to the north-west.  A drainage pond will be 
located in this corner. All site runoff will be directed to this pond. 

This storm water retention pond will be designed for 1 in 100 year return rain based 
on 15 minute duration.  The pond will act as a surge pond and excess water will be 
pumped to the tailings brine pond. The pumping capacity will be designed for 6,000 
m3/hr.  The excess runoff over the 1 in 100 year return will be discharge to the north 
west of the mill site.

An existing CN rail line passes approximately 400 m north of the proposed mill site.  
This track extends from Saskatoon in the west to Melville in the east.  A spur is 
required at Section 17 and 16 to access the load-out facilities of the mill.  

The capacity of the mill track is designed to accommodate the capacity of three 170-
unit trains.  There is approximately 18,000 m of new track.

18.5.1 SITE CONDIT IONS 

GENERAL 

The Muskowekwan Prospect lands are situated in southeastern Saskatchewan, 
immediately west of the town of Lestock and approximately 100.0 km north-northeast 
of Regina, Saskatchewan.  The Project Area is located on Indian Reserve 85 (IR85) 
and consists of Indian Mineral Title Lands owned by the Muskowekwan First Nations 
(Band Number 392).  The Project Area is centrally located on IR85 and comprises a 
portion of the Muskowekwan First Nations Lands encompassing just under 26 
sections of land and contains just over 16,831 acres including roads. 

The property is characterized by gently rolling grassland with local poplar bluffs.  
Some of the land is unbroken grassland and is used as pasture or grazing land for 
livestock.  There are a number of small swamps and low lying wetland areas that 
play host to a number of wildlife species.  The elevation of the area is variable, but 
generally sits at a mean elevation of 673.0 m above sea level. 

The Muskowekwan First Nation is located near Highway 15, between the towns of 
Lestock and Punnichy.  No other towns or villages are located within the bounds of 
the Project Area.  The entire site is accessible by a network of "grid" section gravel 
and paved roads, including a major paved highway.  Highway #15 connects to 
Melville in the east and to the west it connects to Highway 6 which runs south to the 
major urban center of Regina. 

GEOLOGIC  SETTING 

The Muskowekwan Prospect is located in the heart of Saskatchewan's potash 
district, as seen on the regional geologic map from the Geologic Atlas of 
Saskatchewan published on the Government of Saskatchewan's website 
(www.infomaps.gov.sk.ca) and presented in Figure 18.1.  The operating potash 
mines are also shown on the map.  The surfacial geology for the same map extents 
is presented as Figure 18.2.

This portion of Saskatchewan has been experienced several glacial cycles that have 
resulted in various moraine and glacial out wash geologic regimes.  At the 
Muskowekwan site the surfacial geology is undulating and hummocky moraine 
deposits.  The parent rock for these deposits was the Athabasca Sandstone, the 
grinding effects of the glacial movement has resulted in a clay rich environment.  The 
surface topography and hydrology demonstrates this fact with the presence of the 
numerous lakes and ponds that exist atop mounded surfaces.  If the surfacial soils 
were more granular and more permeable the ponds would drain to the valley floor.   

METEOROLOGY 

The climate in the Lestock area is typical of the Saskatchewan prairies. It consists of 
a winter period (November – March) of snow and temperatures below zero degrees 
Celsius. The spring (April – May) and fall (September – October) are cooler, with 
greater rates of precipitation, either in the form of snow or rain. The summer period 
(June to August) is typically warm and dry, with a low average rate of precipitation.  

Weather data collected at Kelliher Station (about 25 km southeast of the Project 
Area) from 1971 to 2000 indicates that January is the coldest month of the year with 
a daily temperature averaging -17.2°C; extremes range from +9.0°C to -46.7°C.  July 
is the warmest month of the year with daily temperature averaging +17.5°C and 
extremes ranging from +37.2°C to 0°C.   

Total annual precipitation is 465.1 mm comprising 128.5 mm of snow and 336.4 mm 
of rain with over 64% of the total precipitation occurring in the five months from May 
to September.  Monthly evaporation data from the Wynyard Station from 1965 to 
2008 indicates annual gross evaporation of 828mm.   

The 100 year-24 hour rainfall storm event is estimated to be 114.5 mm for the site.  
The PMP 24-hour precipitation value generally accepted for this region is 300 mm.  
The average precipitation for the 20-year wet trending year is 537.3 mm based on 
analysis of the Kelliher Station data from 1953 through 2010. 

SEISMIC ITY 

Canada (NBCC, 2005), which provides uniform hazard spectra for design of 
buildings, and requires a 1 in 2475 year ground motion (0.00404 probability of 
exceedence per annum) to be considered in design.  Seismic design of earthworks 
structures is not governed by NBCC (2005), but appropriate design motions may be 
selected or inferred from the same source. 

Median seismic hazard values recommended for building design at the site are 
presented in Table 17.1.  These motions are calculated as median hazard values for 
a return period of 2475 years (i.e. 2% probability of exceedence in 50 years, or 
0.00404 annual probability of exceedence).

A mass balance spreadsheet model was prepared to determine the Tailing 
Management Facility (TMF) dimensions and resulting brine re-injection rate on an 
annual basis over an estimated mine life of 25 years.  Table 18.3 presents inputs, 
design criteria, and assumptions were used to develop the mass balance model. 

It should be noted that although the mass balance model allows tracking of coarse 
and fine tailings flows separately, the currently envisioned operation would combine 
these two waste streams for deposition followed by separation of coarse and fine 
tailings solids at the TMF.   

The primary goal of the model was to determine the flows and general dimensions of 
the TMF which is anticipated to include the following components: 

 Coarse tailings pile – typical operations involve rotational spigoting of tailings 
and working deposited tailings with equipment to form a wedge shaped pile 
with a shallow down-gradient angle to carry the insoluble fine tailings in 
suspension to the settling pond. 

 Fine tailing settling pond – typical operations involve development of a 
settling pond adjacent to the coarse tailings pile to clarify the brine prior to

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

flowing to the brine pond.  The settling pond is contained by berms and 
incorporates decant structures to facilitate controlled sub-aqueous fine 
tailings deposition and supernatant brine flow.  

 Brine pond – sized to maintain a minimum operational depth for pumping 
excess brine to the re-injection wells and to contain runoff due to extreme 
precipitation events from the TMF and plant areas.     

 Brine injection wells – sized to dispose excess brine under 20-year wet year 
precipitation conditions with excess capacity to dispose runoff volume 
generated by the extreme precipitation event within a reasonable time frame.

MASS BALANCE RESULTS 

The mass balance spreadsheet model was executed on a yearly time step.  It was 
assumed that the coarse tailings disposal area would be initially constructed to 
accommodate five years of operations, followed by expansion every five years, as 
needed.  It was also assumed that the initial coarse tailings lift would be completed 
prior to starting the upper lift.  A 75% injection well efficiency was assumed for

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

Results of the mass balance model are summarized in Table 18.4.  It should be 
noted that the average brine injection rates determined for normal climatic conditions 
are not used to size the brine injection system.  Based on calculated injection rates 
required to accommodate 20-year wet year conditions, two 454 m3/hr injection wells 
are required and will provide excess capacity for disposal of runoff volumes from 
extreme precipitation events.   

The brine pond area required is approximately 40ha assuming a 5 m operational 
depth.  An additional 3.5 m freeboard is required to accommodate runoff generated 
from the 24 hour PMP event, including a minimum residual freeboard of 0.5 m.

The TMF consists of three tailings confinement structures to direct the flow of the 
tailings based on their size distribution.  The tailings will be pumped from the plant 
and discharged at the top of the coarse tailings pile.  The salt will precipitate forming 
a mound and beach geometry.  The undersize material will flow by gravity to the fine 
tailings settling pond.  As the fine particles settle; confinement berms, constructed 
with suitable coarse tailings will be raised over the life of the project.  The brine 
decanted from this settling area will flow by gravity to the brine pond, from there the 
brine will be injected to abandoned areas of the deposit.  At this time the brine pond 
has been laid out in a low lying area east of the plant.  The embankment is laid out to 
contain 3.2 million cubic meters of brine and storm water.  The water balance and 
brine pond sizing assumes storm water runoff from the surrounding areas can be 
diverted around the facility.  The brine pond location and layout results in a shallow 
pond which is larger than the 5m deep, 40ha pond determined by the water balance.  
Future studies will optimize the facility location layout with respect to terrain, geologic 
conditions, and mass/water balance.  

As discussed in the surfacial geology section, at this time Tetra Tech believes the 
native soils will provide adequate containment without the need for geo-synthetic 
liners.  The actual permeability of the soils must be determined in the next phase of 
investigations.  

The general layout of the TMF is shown in Figure 18.3.  The topography was 
generated from Google Earth data; TetraTech believes the surface is a reasonable 
representation of the actual.  However, detailed mapping will be required to 
determine the extent of grading required to construct the containment berms and 
embankments. Figure 18.3 present a schematic cross-section of the TMF.

The Muskowekwan Project is located in southeastern Saskatchewan approximately 
100 km north/northeast of Regina and west of Lestock.  The Project area is dissected 
by Saskatchewan Highway 15 with majority of the site located mostly west of 
Highway 15 and a portion located on the east side of the Highway.  Current access 
to the site is via Highway 15, country roads, and air.  The project will be located 
entirely upon reserve lands of the Muskowekwan First Nation, Indian Reserve 85, 
which encompasses Township 27 and southern half of Ranges 15 and 16 (North Rim 
2011). 

2 0 . 2  E N V I R O N M E N T A L  A P P R O V A L  R E Q U I R E M E N T S  

The location of the project on Indian reserve lands is a trigger under the Indian Act 
for an Environmental Assessment (EA) under the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act (CEAA).  The project will require a comprehensive study level of 
environmental review in consideration of the proposed annual production rate of 
2,000,000+ tonnes.  The CEAA comprehensive study requirement for a potash mine 
is triggered by a production rate of 1,000,000 tonnes per annum.  At this stage in 
project planning it is not known if approvals will be required under the Fisheries Act 
or the Navigable Waters Protection Act but the CEAA comprehensive study will 
satisfy the environmental review requirements for these approvals in the event they 
are required.  

At the provincial level, the primary enabling step in the environmental approval 
process for a potash mine in Saskatchewan is the preparation, submission and 
acceptance by the Minister of an environmental impact assessment (EIA).  No other 
environment-related licences or permits that allow for the construction or operation of 
the project may be obtained until the environmental assessment has been 
completed.  

The Saskatchewan Environmental Assessment Act requires a proponent of a 
development to assess its environmental impact and report to the Minister whether 
the proposed project is likely to have a significant effect on the biophysical 
environment or related socio-economic structure.  The need for a TMF, or salt pile 
and brine ponds, places the project in the category of a "development" and thereby 
requires an environmental assessment.  



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 163 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

The federal and provincial environmental assessments will be managed in 
accordance with the Canada-Saskatchewan Agreement on Environmental 
Assessment Coordination so that the requirements of both processes can be 
satisfied within a single environmental assessment, administered by both 
governments but with the primary point of contact being the provincial environmental 
assessment agency. 

This project would be the first mine in Saskatchewan to be located on reserve lands 
and the specific details of the environmental assessment process and coordination of 
the assessment between the federal and provincial governments remains to be 
detailed.  The Department of Aboriginal and Northern Affairs (AAND) will be the 
Responsible Authority on the federal aside and will either coordinate the assessment 
directly with Saskatchewan Environment or through the Major Projects Management 
Office (MPMO) of Natural Resources Canada.  The environmental assessment and 
review process is expected to generally follow the sequence outlined below.   

20.2.1 SUBMIT  A  PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

The project description needs to provide sufficient information for the regulator to 
understand the project and how it will interact with the natural and human 
environment.  The project description forms the basis for the development of project 
specific guidelines for the preparation of the Environmental Assessment and 
therefore needs to be as complete as possible.  The project description is submitted 
to Saskatchewan Environment and is circulated to key provincial and federal 
agencies for review and comment. 

20.2.2 DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECT GUIDELINES 

The Project Specific Guidelines (PSGs) are essentially terms of reference which will 
provide Encanto with guidance on the scope of the impact assessment that should 
be undertaken.  Once the list of PSGs is drafted it is released to the public for review 
for 30 days.  At the end of the 30 day period, the EA Branch considers any 
comments received and develops a final list of PSGs.   

20.2.3 ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE STUDY 

The environmental baseline study (EBS) is carried out by Encanto to provide pre-
development environmental and socio-economic data.  The baseline study typically 
involves the collection of site specific field data pertaining to environmental 
components such as vegetation and soils, wildlife and birds, fish and fish habitat, 
hydrogeology, climate, air quality and geology.  Information regarding the social 
structure of communities that may be affected by the development is also collected.  
This work often begins before the PSGs are finalized in order to ensure that critical 
seasons can be covered without causing undue delays.  Adjustments to the baseline 
study plan can be made once the PSGs have been established. 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 164 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

20.2.4 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT 

The EIA takes into account information gathered in the environmental baseline study 
and examines the potential project-environment interactions to determine the 
potential impacts the development may have on the natural and human environment.  
Both adverse and beneficial impacts are discussed, as well as preventive and 
mitigative measures that will be employed to minimize any adverse impacts. 

20.2.5 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT 

The environmental impact statement (EIS) contains the environmental baseline study 
and the environmental impact assessment.  The EIS includes a detailed project 
description, which builds on the initial project description on which the PSGs were 
based (Stage 1).  The EIS also incorporates the comments and findings of the 
public/Aboriginal consultation process, which is normally conducted by the proponent 
as the EIS is being developed and throughout EA process. 

20.2.6 TECHNICAL AND PUBLIC  REVIEW 

Once the EIS is submitted to Saskatchewan Environment a technical review is 
carried out to determine if there are any deficiencies in the EIS in comparison to the 
PSGs, which is normally completed within 60 days.  If there are any deficiencies in 
the EIS, a deficiency statement will be issued to the proponent.  The proponent must 
then submit the additional information requested for review.  Once the EA Branch is 
satisfied with the content of the EIS, technical review comments are drafted and both 
the comments and EIS document are released for public review (minimum 30 days). 

20.2.7 EIS APPROVAL 

Once the public review has ended the EA Branch submits the EIS, technical review 
comments, public comments and recommendations to the Minister.  If the Minister 
approves the development the proponent may proceed with acquiring the permits, 
leases or licenses necessary for project implementation. 

20.2.8 REQUIREMENT FOR PUBLIC  CONSULTATION AND PARTIC IPATION 

Public participation is an important and required component of the EA process.  The 
proponent of the development is expected to engage the public at an early stage in 
the impact assessment.  This allows for open two-way communication between the 
local communities and the proponent, and may form the basis of positive and long-
term relationships between the two parties.  Effective public involvement enables the 
proponent to identify issues early in the process, assess their significance and plan 
mitigation/enhancement measures.  

The public consultation process should involve any interested parties, including 
Aboriginal and Metis peoples.  However, it is typical for Aboriginal and Metis people 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 165 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

to request consultation separate from the general public.  For any type of 
consultation, communication should be documented and included in the EIS. 

20.2.9 TIMELINE FOR APPROVAL 

The preparation, regulatory review, and approval of an EIS under the provincial 
process typically takes about one year.  The requirement for a CEAA comprehensive 
study can be expected to extend the review and approval process to approximately 
18 months.  It should be noted that this is the timeline after the PSGs and EBS have 
been completed, which could take a year or more before development of the EIS 
begins.  This process can be shortened if the "Substitution" process can be agreed 
upon by Federal and Provincial Agencies.  Discussions are underway by Encanto. 

Therefore, it should be considered a two to three year process from the initiation of 
baseline study and PSG development.

20.5.2 TERRESTRIAL  RESOURCES 

The Project area consists of plains with undrained depressions.  The topography is 
generally flat with some short, steep slopes in some areas (Thompson and Hansen 
2001). 

This project area falls within the Moist Mixed Grassland Ecoregion of the Prairies 
Ecozone, which in its native state is characterized by non-arable pasture lands along 
with deciduous trees and shrubs.  Typical species include speargrasses, 
wheatgrasses, snowberry, rose, chokecherry, and wolf willow (Sask CDC 2011a, 
2011c).  Small aspen groves surrounding undrained depressions are characteristic of 
the ecozone. (Sask CDC 2011c, Thompson and Hansen 2001). 

The project area is primarily used for agricultural production, with both cultivated and 
pasture lands.  The location of the plant site is currently in pasture and has been for 
approximately 50 years.  Prior to that time the land was in cultivation (need name of 
First nation councilor on site visit).  Crops in the area are majorly cereals.  Other 
crops in the area include feed grains, forage crops and oilseeds (Sask CDC 2011c, 
Thompson and Hansen 2001). 

Numerous undrained depressions (sloughs) occur in the project area and provide 
habitat for ducks and other waterfowl.  Other birds common to the area include 
Western Meadowlark, Eastern Kingbird, Yellow-Headed Blackbird, Sharp-Tailed 
Grouse and Franklin's Gull (Sask CDC 2011b, 2011c).  Piping Plover are known to

occur in the ecoregion (Sask CDC 2011b, 2011c).  No studies of avian occurrence or 
habitat use on or adjacent to the project area have been conducted to date. 

Common mammals in the area include Mule deer, White-tailed deer, Coyote, Red 
fox, Badger, Richardson's ground squirrel and Jack rabbit (Sask CDC 2011b, 2011c).  
No studies of mammal occurrence or habitat use on or adjacent to the project area 
have been conducted to date. 

20.5.3 AQUATIC  RESOURCES 

Several named lakes (Torchwood, Pinacie, and Reserve lakes) occur in the project 
area west of the planned plant site along with numerous unnamed sloughs and 
ponds.  The area of the proposed plant site is distinguished by fewer ponds/sloughs 
than in the surrounding areas. No studies of water quality or other aquatic resource 
values of these waterbodies have been conducted to date.  

Planning of utilities corridors will need to accommodate these waterbodies as will the 
layout of well-fields in the event that solution mining is selected as the mining method 
for the project.   

20.5.4 SPECIES AT RISK 

A list of at risk animal and plant species known to occur in the ecoregion are listed in 
Table 20.2.  These species were identified based on desktop review of habitat within 
the area, habitat affinity of the species, and known species distributions.  Additional 
species of concern may occur in the area. Field verification will be required to confirm 
the presence of species.

21.1.1 INTRODUCTION 

This PEA is intended for Concept Screening based on the AACE classification 
system, Recommended Practice No. 18R-97, June 15, 1998 (See Appendix H). 

End Usage:  Class 5 estimates are prepared for any number of strategic business 
planning purposes, such as, but not limited to, market studies, assessment of initial 
viability, evaluation of alternate schemes, project screening, project location studies, 
evaluation of resource needs and budgeting, long-range capital planning, etc. 

Expected Accuracy Range:  An accuracy assessment of the cost estimate as part of 
this study and is in the overall order of ±35%. 

The project consists of developing a new mine at the Encanto Muskowekwan 
property.  The conventional mine has been sized for a maximum capacity of 
2,000,000 tonnes/year of finished product mined and milled.  The solution mine field 
has been sized to supply enough ore for 2,000,000 tonnes/year using primary 
solution mining.  However, after four to six years of production, caverns will be 
available for secondary mining.  This will increase ore production enough to support 
approximately 2,500,000 tonnes/year of product.  Secondary mining is very 
economical, therefore the capital costs for the solution mine mill and support 
infrastructure have been estimated to support the 2,500,000 tonnes/year production 
rate.  The Encanto mine will be a green field construction site. 

21.1.2 COST SUMMARY 

A detailed Capital Cost Estimate (CAPEX) has been included in Appendix G.  A 
summary of the costs are included in Table 21.1 below.

 The Mine Site Project is "Green Field" 

 All equipment and materials will be new 

 Concrete batching capabilities are available 

 Construction camp will be required 

 Labour and contractors are available 

 CN rail line will own and operate the ore trains 

 Costs are in 2011 Canadian Dollars 

The following are not included in this estimate:

2 1 . 2  O P E R A T I N G  C O S T  E S T I M A T E  

Solution mines typically have greater operational cost than conventional mines. 
Although conventional mines have almost twice the manpower requirements this is 
out weighted by other factors.  The main additional operating costs of a solution mine 
include:  

 Greater natural gas costs due to evaporators 

 Increased electrical costs to the well field pumps 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 174 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

 On going well field replacement 

Energy reduction options should be carefully studied (in future project phase) and 
compared to capital costs in order to determine the economics of each option and 
the opportunity to reduce overall operating costs.

The cash flow model was created using CAPEX and OPEX estimated based on a 23 
year period for conventional and 30 year period for solution.  Amortization and 
depreciation are based on CCA standards.  Royalties and taxes were estimated 
based on publicly available information.  Accuracy of this estimate was aimed to be 
within overall accuracy of this study. 

Sustaining CAPEX was assumed to be consistent over the study period. 

Evaluations were performed for both Conventional and Solution mine methods. 
Conventional production rate was indicated at 2.0 Mt/a.  Solution mining was 
indicated at 2.5 Mt/a. (Due to secondary mining). 

Results of the analysis can be found in Appendix F. 

2 2 . 2  M A R K E T  S T U D Y  

No formal market study was performed for the purpose of this study. Potash pricing 
is based on prevailing market conditions and set at $450/t FOB site. 

Sensitivity on pricing was performed from $375/t to $525/t. 

2 2 . 3  E C O N O M I C  A N A L Y S I S  

Economic analysis was performed using the discounted cash flow methodology. The 
following measures were calculated using project parameters as identified in this 
study. 

 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) (using various Potash pricing scenarios) 

 Net Present Value (NPV) (at various discounted rates and Potash prices) 

Two separate analyses were performed for both conventional and solution mining 
scenarios.  Funding was assumed at 100% equity funding.  Copies of the analysis 
are located in Appendix I.

The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan operates the Lanigan underground potash 
mine approximately 88.0 km northwest of the north-western boundary of the Project 
Area.  The Lanigan mine functions as a conventional mine producing standard, 
granular and suspension grade potash sold for use as a fertilizer and agricultural 
product as per their website.  The Mosaic Belle Plaine Solution Mine operated by 
The Mosaic Company is present approximately 116.0 km southwest of the southwest 
edge of the Project Area and produces a variety of potash products.  Adjacent 
Subsurface Mineral Permits (refer to Figure 2 ) belong to Saskatchewan Ltd.; a 
Saskatoon based Potash Company and is a subsidiary of Joint Stock Company 
Accron.  Both BHP Billiton and Karnalyte Resources hold land due north of the 
Project Area.  Karnalyte Resources is an exploration company focussed on 
developing potash and magnesium products.  They are currently focussing on KP360 
where they intend to develop carnallite using solution mining methods.  The authors 
are unaware of any other advanced exploration activities on any other nearby 
Permits.

24.1.1 SOLUTION VS CONVENTIONAL MIN ING 

Some of the main differences between the solution and conventional mining options 
include: 

 Capacity – The conventional mine has been sized for 2,000,000 tonnes/year 
of product.  The solution mine will have a 2,500,000 tonnes/year using 
secondary mining. 

 Mine Life – Based on industrial resources, the conventional mine has a 23 
year mine life versus 30 years for a solution mine. 

 Water Usage – The solution mine uses the same amount of fresh water (per 
tonne of product) but approximately five times the overall water volume. 

 CAPEX – The CAPEX is approximately the same for both options but the 
solution mine has the higher output capacity (2.5 Mt/a versus 2.0 Mt/a). 

 OPEX – The solution mine OPEX is $68/t versus $55/t for the conventional 
mine. 

 Manpower – The solution mine will require approximately 320 personnel 
versus approximately 480 personnel for the conventional mine. 

 Natural Gas Usage – the solution mine uses over four times the natural gas 
volume. 

24.1.2 PRELIMINARY PROJECT EXECUTION PLAN 

GENERAL 

The Preliminary Project Execution Plan is based on following assumptions: 

 Project is economically valid 

 Project is to be implemented 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 185 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

 Project is to be completed in the shortest possible time 

 Time required for internal reviews and passing interim approval gates will to 
be minimal 

Primary drivers for program execution timing and sequencing are: 

 Saskatchewan Provincial and Federal permitting requirements 

 Technical conditions related to developing new conventional potash mine 
and related ancillary facilities 

Based on above listed assumptions a Preliminary Project Execution Schedule 
(PPES) was developed.  PPES is included in Appendix J. 

For the planning purposes the program is divided into two main phases: 

 Phase 1 – Meeting Provincial and Federal permitting and licensing 
requirements 

 Phase 2 – Develop of mine, process plant and ancillary facilities and 
including commissioning and production ramp up. 

It will take about 21-28 months (2 years) to complete Phase 1 and another 66 
months (5 ½ years) to complete Phase 2. 

PHASE I  –  MEETING SASKATCHEWAN AND CANADA FEDERAL PERMITT ING 
REQUIREMENTS 

This phase will involve concentrating on obtaining various permits and licenses from 
different permitting and licensing bodies.  A list of these permits and licenses is 
included in this report (Table 14.1). 

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT – EIS 

The key permit and key milestone in the project development is obtaining approval 
by the Province of Saskatchewan for the Environmental Impact Statement.  

Approval of EIS is a pre-condition to other agencies for the issuance of other permits 
and licenses required to proceed with on-site mine development.  Sequencing and 
duration of activities leading to obtaining the EIS is driven by number of provincial 
and federally legislated requirements.  PPES include the following major activities.  

Project Description - this is a base document prepared by project proponent 
submitted to Ministry of Environment describing major parameters of the proposed 
development in detail sufficient to formulate permitting requirements.

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

Project Specific Guidelines (PSG) – this document specifies permitting requirements 
which proponent must meet in order to obtain permit to develop project.  

Environmental Baseline Studies (EBS).  The first step in this process will be initiation 
of these studies which are required to cover all four seasons and will last one year.  

Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS).  Main objective of PFS is to bring the engineering design 
development to the level sufficient to meet criteria specified in PSG. PFS level of 
engineering development is approximately 10% and should start at the same time as 
the EBS. 

Based on information acquired in the EBS and PFS the Environmental Impact 
Statement (EIS) can be completed. Estimated time for completion of the EIS is one-
half year.  Government review will take between 6 month to 12 months depending on 
the quality and completeness of EIS submission.  

Activities leading to obtaining the EIS approval will last approximately two-and-half 
years from initiating the EBS. 

FEASIB IL ITY STUDY 

The main objective of the Feasibility Study (FS) is to develop the project technical 
definition to the level satisfying requirements of financial institutions to finance 
project.  The FS customarily brings the level of project definition to 25% of detailed 
engineering design.   

The FS will cover any gaps in the PFS and should start immediately following 
completion of the PFS. 

PHASE I I  –  MINE AND SURFACE FACIL IT IES DEVELOPMENT 

Activities directly related to the Mine and Surface Facilities Development can take 
place once all permitting conditions are complied with.  This is illustrated as PPES 
milestone – Site Mobilization. 

A number of activities related to preparing for construction, such as detailed 
engineering and procurement, should start at least six month in advance. 

The mine development sequence, rationale and assumptions are described in more 
detail in Section 16.0.  The PPES is based on these assumptions and provides an 
illustrative timeline presentation that indicates: 

 Shafts and Mine development will take approximately 42 months.  

 Engineering, Procurement, Construction for surface facilities development 
will take approximately 36 months.

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

RECOMMENDATION FOR FURTHER WORK 

The PPES lists a number of interim steps to be taken in specific sequence.  In order 
to protect the schedule, the most urgent action item is to start the Environmental 
Baseline Studies (EBS).   

The Pre-Feasibility Study should be executed at the same time as EBS.   

Feasibility Study (FS) should provide information sufficient for: 

 financial arrangements related to finance project  

 define scope of work and performance requirements for  Contractor 

 set project target budget   

Completion of Feasibility Study (BFS) will allow making final decision on the project 
implementation strategy.  Options taken into consideration should include: 

 Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) 

 Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) 

 Design-Build (DB) 

 Turn Key (TK) 

Depending on the ownership structure of project at that point of time all of the above 
options have its pros and cons.

Potash mineralization is projected to be present under the property outline.  All five 
wells penetrated potash-bearing beds and have sufficient assayed core to allow the 
calculation of potash thickness and grade.  The beds considered to have economical 
potential for solution mining are the Patience Lake and the Belle Plaine Member.  
The beds considered to have economical potential for conventional mining are the 
Lower Patience Lake and the Upper Belle Plaine Member.  The Esterhazy Member 
has not been included in the Resource estimates as it has not been demonstrated as 
being consistent in grade and thickness and is carnallitic in locations.

Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources have been estimated based on the volume 
of potash in a cylinder centered on the available cored and assayed drill holes with 
an ROI based on best practices similar to current operating producers in 
Saskatchewan.  The ROI selected were established due to the availability of 3D 
seismic data and continuity of grade and thickness demonstrated in the borehole 
cores.  The 3D seismic identified areas of anomalies and these have been removed 
from the resource calculations presented below. 

25.1.1 POTENTIAL  SOLUTION MIN ING RESOURCE SUMMARIES 

The Indicated Mineral Resources for the potential solution mining interval is 1596 
MMT of sylvinite (including the interbed salt).  The Indicated Resource contains the 
following estimated tonnages:  

 Patience Lake Member: 24.36 MMT of K2O grading 19.69% (31.17% KCI) 

 Interbed Salt: 4.29 MMT of K2O grading 3.96% (6.27% KCI) 

 Belle Plaine Member: 25.61 MMT of K2O grading 17.41% (27.56% KCI) 

 Patience Lake and Belle Plaine Members including interbeds:  54.26 MMT of 
K2O grading 13.65% (21.61% KCI) 

 Patience Lake and Belle Plaine Members excluding interbeds: 49.97 MMT of 
K2O grading 18.57% (18.57% KCI) 

The Inferred Mineral Resources for the potential solution mining intervals is 1207 
MMT of sylvinite (including the interbed salt).  The Inferred Resource contains the 
following estimated tonnages: 

 Patience Lake Member: 18.64  MMT of K2O grading 19.85% (31.42% KCI) 

 Interbed Salt: 3.25 MMT of K2O grading 4.01% (6.35% KCI) 

 Belle Plaine Member: 19.60 MMT of K2O grading 17.63% (27.91% KCI) 

 Patience Lake and Belle Plaine Members including interbeds:  41.49 MMT of 
K2O grading 13.80% (21.84% KCI) 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 190 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

 Patience Lake and Belle Plaine Members excluding interbeds: 38.24 MMT of 
K2O grading 18.75% (29.68% KCI) 

No Measured Mineral Resource has been estimated because engineering studies 
have not been completed to establish specific mining horizons, resource recovery, 
process selection, and preliminary operating and capital costs.  

The reader must note that these two resource case values are not to be added 
together. 

25.1.2 POTENTIAL  CONVENTIONAL MINING RESOURCE SUMMARIES 

The Indicated Mineral Resource for the potential conventional mining interval of the 
Lower Patience Lake Sub-member is 117 MMT of sylvinite and contains the following 
estimated tonnages: 

 Indicated Tonnage of the Lower Patience Lake Sub-member: 7.91  MMT of K2O 
grading 24.36% (38.56% KCI) 

The Inferred Mineral Resource for the Lower Patience Lake Sub-member is 89 MMT 
of sylvinite and contains the following estimated tonnages: 

 Inferred Tonnage of the Lower Patience Lake Sub-member: 5.93  MMT of K2O 
grading 24.14% (38.21% KCI) 

The Indicated Mineral Resource for the potential conventional mining interval of the 
Upper Belle Plaine Sub-member is 344 MMT of sylvinite and contains the following 
estimated tonnages: 

 Indicated Tonnage of the Upper Belle Plaine Member:  21.06 MMT of K2O 
grading 22.09% (34.97%) 

The Inferred Mineral Resource for the potential conventional mining interval of the 
Upper Belle Plaine Sub-member is 239 MMT of sylvinite and contains the following 
estimated tonnages: 

 Inferred Tonnage of the Upper Belle Plaine Member:  14.74 MMt of K2O grading 
22.28% (35.27% KCI) 

The conventional mining tonnages presented above for the Lower Patience Lake and 
Upper Belle Plaine must not be added together as current mining practices dictate 
that only one mining horizon is extracted. Studies of bi-level mining may be 
conducted in the future. 

No Measured Mineral Resource has been estimated because engineering studies 
have not been completed to establish specific mining horizons, resource recovery, 
process selection, and preliminary operating and capital costs.  



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 191 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

It is the opinion of the authors that there is a sufficient resource base potential to 
support further studies to assess the feasibility of evaluating the economics of a 
selected mining method. 

2 5 . 2  E C O N O M I C  A N A L Y S I S  

Preliminary economic analysis of the options indicate the conventional mine would 
have a IRR of 20.9% and the solution mine a 23.6% IRR. These are based on AACE 
Class 5 capital estimate, OPEX of equivalent occurrence at a base potash price of 
$450/t FOB site.  Further details are given in Sections 21 and 22.   

2 5 . 3  M A J O R  R I S K  A N D  M I T I G A T I O N S  

25.3.1 RISKS 

Several risks and related mitigation options have been identified and include: 

1) Permitting and licensing issues:  The Preliminary Project Execution Schedule 
(PPES) is based on the assumption that nominal dates for obtaining 
numerous permits and licenses will be not exceeded.  Mitigation measures 
related to obtaining various permits and licenses should include: 

a. Prepare detailed licensing and permitting requirements plan  

b. Pay utmost attention to fulfill all requirements set by licensing and 
permitting bodies  

c. Secure corporate approval for obtaining permits and licenses along 
with funds 

d. Retain reputable organization to manage the whole permitting 
process with single point of responsibility. 

2) The organizational capacity to manage large capital projects:  The 
Muskowekwan Project development is a multi-year major capital project 
totalling approximately $2.5 B.  We understand this size of projects has not 
been executed by the Encanto Potash before.  Development of in house 
capacity is lengthy and rarely successful.  Mitigation measures should 
include: 

a. Delegate most of work to specialized organization and retain control 
on strategic objectives.  

b. Avoid splitting the program into a number of small projects and 
managing them internally by part-time staff. 

c. Establish a separate internal Project Implementation Unit (PIU) 
dedicated to the Muskowekwan program only. 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 192 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

d. PIU should be sufficiently staffed and empowered to manage the 
program in an efficient manner. 

e. Retain an organization with "EPCM" or "Turn Key" capacity to 
execute whole program under Owner's PIU supervision. 

3) The financial security of project execution:  Cash flow forecast indicate that 
major expenditures will occur during the second phase when construction 
activates will begin and long lead procurement items will require financial 
commitments.  Mitigation measures should include: 

a. Setting tight financial plan and focusing on strategic objectives only.  
These should include: obtaining EIS approval and completion of FS.  

b. Field work is to be limited to minimum credible scope necessary to 
attain strategic objectives. 

4) Availability of manpower: Over 1000 construction workers will be required at 
peak times and during production 300 to 500 operating personnel will be 
required.  The local population is small with limited technical experience and 
the future Saskatchewan job market is expected to continue to be strong.  
Mitigation efforts should include: 

a. Effectively utilize available local resources 

b. Work with local communities 

c. Work with various institutions to provide training 

d. Efforts should begin early in the project life 

e. Investigate mining and milling options 

5) Water supply is unidentified: Both mine options will require approximately 1 
m3/t of fresh water.  The solution mine option will also require an addition 4 to 
5 m3/t of low quality water.  The source and cost of this water has not been 
confirmed.  Mitigation efforts should include: 

a. SaskWater should be contacted to review options, estimate supply 
costs and confirm water rights. 

b. Further investigation to be conducted to determine possible use of 
water from local aquifer. 

6) Limited conventional mine resources:  Based on indicated resources, the 
conventional mine has a 23 year life which is minimal for a potash mine.  If 
the conventional mine option is selected, mitigation options should include: 

a. Investigate the inferred resources  

b. Confirm rights to additional land and investigate resources. 



 
 

 Encanto Potash Corporation 193 1191790100-REP-G0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment   
 

c. Investigate the option of mining multiple zones. 

7) Conventional mine depth:  The potash beds are located deeper than any 
previous Saskatchewan Potash Mine using conventional mining methods (by 
approximately 200m).  However, Cleveland Potash, in the UK, has been 
operating at greater depths than this for some forty years.  If a conventional 
mine method is chosen, mitigation efforts should include ongoing additional 
analysis to identify and avoid localized risks. 

8) Shaft sinking in Saskatchewan involves dealing with water bearing members.  
Shaft sinking can be delayed by ground freezing and/or grouting difficulties.  

2 5 . 4  M I N I N G  C O N C L U S I O N S  

Both mining options appear viable but have different strengths and weaknesses, 
including: 

 The solution mine has the longest life (30+ years verses 23 years based on 
indicated resources) 

 The solution mine has a lower CAPEX/Tonne 

 The solution mine has lower manpower requirements (approximately 320 
versus 480 personnel) 

 The solution mine has a higher internal rate of return (IRR) 

 The solution mine requires more water (5-6 m3/tonne versus 1m3/tonne) 

It will require approximately seven (7) years for conventional mine and six (6) years 
for solution mine to bring to production.  This includes further investigation phases, 
environmental licensing, preliminary design, detailed design and construction. 

Based on the discussion above we recommended that only the solution mining 
option will be further investigated.

1. INTRODUCTION 
NOVOPRO/ENCANTO asked NGConsulting (NGC) to carry out a preliminary estimate of the 
KCl brine grade at deposit temperature and at higher one than deposit temperature based 
on geophysical data supplied by the client. 

The estimate was carried out considering dissolution test data on similar Sylvinite cores from 
other deposits.  

The work undertaken by NGConsulting comprises in general: 

• Evaluation of the geophysical and geological data set of exploration drill holes 

• Generation of a theoretical relation between KCl content and dissolution rate 

• Generation of a theoretical relation between KCl content and KCl brine grade 

• prediction of the KCl brine grade for a full scale Sylvinite cavern. 

The preliminary estimate of the KCl brine grade considers the amount of insoluble's in each 
potash layer as an average number of 5%.  

The occurrence of MgCl2 bearing minerals like Carnallite was noted but not specified in more 
detail due to the low values at Patience lake and Belle Plaine. Due to the significant amount 
of Carnallite at the Esterhazy potash member it is recommended to exclude this layer from 
solution mining at least for this early stage investigations.

2. ESTIMATE OF DISSOLUTION RATES AND KCL BRINE GRADE 
In order to evaluated the potential of a potash deposit for KCl production using solution 
mining the knowledge of the most probable KCl brine grade withdrawal from future solution 
miming wells is crucial. 

Usually at the beginning dissolution test work on original potash cores is carried out. In a 
later project stage full scale pilot tests are also common.  

Based on a large number of dissolution test work and operating experience in potash 
solution mining NGConsulting developed a procedure and empirical equations to estimate 
the KCl Brine grade based on geophysical borehole data (Gamma Log). 

The following sections provides a brief description of this procedure and the results for the 
drill holes 

• Lestock 02‐09 

• Lestock 07‐02 

• Lestock 11‐18 

• Punnichy 15‐14 

• Lestock 15‐16 

Prior to the estimate of the KCl brine grade the influencing parameters on the dissolution 
rate and subsequently on the KCl brine grade are described.  

 

2.1. Goals of dissolution test work 

The goals of performing dissolution tests on salt (Sylvinite) samples are  

• the measurements of the dissolution rates and  

• providing data for an estimate of the brine concentration 

in order to generate a broader data base for the design of the Sylvinite solution mining and 
brine processing operation.  

The measurement of the dissolution rates has to consider the following influencing 
parameters: 

• Mineral ore parameter 

o type of ore such as high grade Sylvinite, low grade Sylvinite, Halite, Anhydrite, 
clay, shale and other insoluble or very soluble minerals, 

o crystal size, crystal matrix, distribution and layering of the Sylvinite ore 
o content of insoluble's or minerals with very low solubility 

• Temperature 

o deposit temperature

5 of 19 

• Solvent Concentration 

o water 
o low KCl brine 

• Flow pattern 

o free convection 
o forced convection 

• Blocking and masking of the dissolution surface due to 

o dissolution residues 
o blanket or occurring gas/oil inclusions insider the mineral ore  
o recrystallisation of Halite 
o crystallization of KCl due to temperature drop 

In addition to the measurement of the dissolution rate which summarizes all kinetic aspects 
of a dissolution process the measurements of the  

• dissolution path determined by the phase chemistry  

is required. 

A dissolution test cannot replace solution mining pilot testing but the information received 
from dissolution test work can cover a wider range of situations inside the cavern. However 
a cavern is 100 m and more meter wide compared to 10 cm of a core.  

That means the cavern geometry determined by the injection and production point, the 
blanket level as well as the geological structures will also have an impact on the brine grade.  

Therefore the dissolution test work will provide significant support to optimize the solution 
mining  parameters what finally should lead to higher KCl brine grades in a commercial 
cavern. 

2.2. Estimate of dissolution rates 

The evaluation of the data received from the dissolution test measurements comprises the 
following steps: 

1. Calculation of the dissolution surface 

2. Calculation of the measured weight loss 

3. Smoothening of the measured brine density curve 

4. Calculation of dissolution rate versus time 

5. Calculation of dissolution rate versus brine density 

6. Comparison of the dissolution rate with data from previous measurements 
and/or literature data 

7. Calculation of the dissolution rate versus temperature

8. Calculation of the dissolution rate versus dissolution residues 

9. Calculation of the dissolution rate versus the KCl content of the salt core sample 

10. Dissolution rate over the height of the potash layer (dissolution rate log) 

The following preliminary estimate of the dissolution rate leaves behind steps 1 to 8 and 
starts at step 9 using relations between the dissolution rate versus the KCl content of the salt 
core sample found at dissolution test work on potash especially Sylvinite samples from all 
over the world.  

The measured test data from a number of different Sylvinite deposits were converted into 
empirical equations using also a theoretical approach developed by NGConsulting. 

Figure 1 provides the dissolution rate versus the KCl content of the Sylvinite ore for different 
temperatures.

Based on the gamma log received from each well after drilling and the relation between 
dissolution rate and  KCl content found at the dissolution tests a "dissolution rate log " can 
be generated for each future well which indicates fast growing and slow growing areas 
inside the cavern. 

Figures 2a to 2 e illustrate the dissolution rate over the height of the potash layers 
(dissolution rate log) for the wells Lestock 02‐09, Lestock 07‐02, Lestock 11‐18, Punnichy 15‐
14 and Lestock 15‐16.

Figure 2e:  Dissolution rate log for well Lestock 15‐16 

 

The dissolution rate log has been generated using the measured gamma profile of the 
relevant potash layers of the wells.  The Gamma values (API) has been converted into 
Potassium (K2O) and further into KCl values for intervals between 10 and 30 cm.  

Using the empirical equations illustrated in Figure 1 the dissolution rate for the intervals was 
calculated.  

The dissolution rate log provides in an early stage an indication about the future cavern 
shape development and allows a more precise determination of the mining cuts at the 
potash bearing member Patience lake, Belle Plaine and Esterhazy. 

 

2.3. Estimate of KCl brine grade  

The evaluation of the data received from brine sampling during the dissolution test run 
comprises the following steps: 

1. Selection of the valid phase diagram and of the relevant equilibrium system, 

2. Correction of brine sample to NaCl saturation level, 

3. Import/plot of the chemical brine samples  into the phase diagram and visualizing the 
dissolution path of each Sylvinite sample in the phase diagram 

4. Import/plot of the KCl max. brine sample and NaCl corrected KCl max. brine sample 
into the phase diagram to mark an area of a most likely brine composition,

10 of 19 

5. Verification of the KCl max. brine data and NaCl corrected brine data with theoretical 
data and if available pilot test data (or in a later stage full size cavern operating data) 

6. Generation of a relation between the KCl content of the ore and the expected KCl 
brine grade 

7. Generation of a KCl brine grade log over the height of the potash layer based on the 
gamma log  

The following preliminary estimate of the KCl brine grade leaves behind steps 1 to 5 and 
starts at step 6 using relations between the KCl brine grade versus the KCl content of the salt

Figure 3:  KCl brine grade  versus the KCl content of the Sylvinite 

Prior to the estimate of the KCl brine grade for each well some general remarks are required, 
the theoretical background of the phase chemistry and the relation to the dissolution 
kinetics has to be explained. 

2.3.1. General remarks 

Solution mining of Sylvinite for potash production on a commercial scale takes currently 
place worldwide at two potash operations only! The by far largest one is located at Moose 
Jaw, Saskatchewan operated by Mosaic. The depth of the deposit varies at 1 500m and the

ore bed compile 15m of Sylvinite. The operation uses S‐shape vertical wells and non‐
selective/selective leaching in a dual well cavern system.  

At Moab, Utah Intrepid Potash is running a selective leaching multiple well horizontal cavern 
system in a 0,5 to 2 meter thin Sylvinite layer at approximately 1 200m depth. 

Further experiences with pilot test work or planned Sylvinite solution mining projects are 
known from several locations in Canadians, Russia (former Soviet Union) and also from pilot 
tests in Argentina, Mendoza. In contrast to the solution mining of other mineral salts, in 
particular rock salt, there is only a limited experience base available on solution mining of 
Sylvinite and/or confidentiality restriction apply.  

It is therefore essential when undertaking the conceptual design for solution mining of 
Sylvinite to consider experience and know‐how gained at other comparable mining 
operations for mineral salts and to transfer these to the deposit situation. Up scaling of the 
results of the lab test to the production brine concentration for primary and secondary 
mining of a large cavern is feasible but of course in a certain range only.  

 

2.3.2. Phase chemistry 

The conceptual design of solution mining Sylvinite has to consider the equilibrium system 
depending on the composition of the Sylvinite ore itself or accompanying layers of other 
minerals. For Sylvinite the simple ternary equilibrium system NaCl‐KCl‐H2O can be used due 
to the low content of Magnesium salts and/or Sulfates as water soluble minerals.

The knowledge and the careful application of the boundary conditions imposed by the 
relevant equilibrium system are crucial for each Sylvinite solution mining operation. 

The phase chemistry for solution mining of Sylvinite deposit allows the following general 
conclusions: 

(1) The non‐selective process route of solution mining depends on the ratio between 
NaCl and KCl in the Sylvinite ore ‐"Theoretical Dissolution Path"‐ and will always 
finally end up (t  ∞) on the equilibrium line between the KCl and NaCl field at the 
given temperature. 

(2) In case the Sylvinite ore is low in KCl and rich in NaCl a deviation from the theoretical 
dissolution path to more NaCl dissolution ‐"NaCl route"‐ can be observed. This is 
caused by the larger dissolution surface of NaCl compared to KCl in low grade 
Sylvinite.  This behavior is a disadvantage because NaCl tends to super saturation as 
long as KCl is not saturated. In order to reach the equilibrium KCl has to force NaCl 
out of the brine initiating re‐crystallization of NaCl which is a long lasting process and 
covers the dissolution surface. Consequently the brine withdrawal from the cavern is 
under saturated in KCl. Only after technically extremely long residence times KCl will 
reach the equilibrium concentration. Therefore a high virgin rock temperature is 
beneficial because it allows larger residence times (secondary mining) compared to 
cavern which has to be heated up.  

(3) In case the Sylvinite ore is high in KCl and poor in NaCl a deviation from the 
theoretical dissolution path to more KCl dissolution ‐"KCl route"‐ will be observed. 
This is an advantage because no NaCl super saturation will occur. Consequently the 
brine withdrawal from such potash seam is closer to the equilibrium concentration of 
KCl. 

(4) According to the phase diagram the discussed two dissolution scenarios will happen if 
the KCl grade of the Sylvinite ore is lower or higher than approx. 35% at 20 °C, 44% at 
50 °C, 47% at 60°C and 51% at 75 °C. 

(5) As already pointed out, higher cavern temperatures will be beneficial but especially if 
they are close to the virgin rock temperature. Considering a dissolution heat loss of 
approx. 8°C at Sylvinite dissolution at cavern/brine injection temperature of approx. 
10°C above deposit temperature is optimal. Cavern temperatures above deposit 
temperature are possible but require optimization of the overall energy balance vs. 
the benefit of a higher KCl brine grade. 

(6) For the given geological situation at Encanto with alternating layers of rich and poor 
Sylvinite ore variation of the KCl brine grade must be expected. Therefore the 
solution mining operation has to be designed in a way to minimize the negative 
impact from the low grade Sylvinite or Halite layers.  

(7) Furthermore it should be born in mind that the full scale cavern data are a mixture 
from different brine grades from different Sylvinite/Halite zones and also reflecting 
the temperature at the wall (!) of the full size cavern during dissolution, which is 
lower as measured in the center of the cavern.

2.3.3. KCl brine grade over the height of the potash layers  (KCl brine grade log) 

Based on operating experiences from full size Sylvinite caverns it can be assumed that: 

• super‐saturation of NaCl and under‐saturation of KCl and vice versa will occur, 

• brine from low grade Sylvinite zones will be mixed with brine from medium to high 
grade Sylvinite zones and 

• areas with higher dissolution rates will add more KCl value to the brine during the 
leaching process in a full scale cavern compared to areas with low dissolution rates. 

Therefore an adjustments with the dissolution rate and a correlation with the KCl content 
measured at the wells by geophysics (Gamma Log) is recommended in order to improve the 
accuracy of KCl brine grade estimation. 

Following this  approach the KCl brine grade versus the KCl content of the Sylvinite ore as 
shown in Figure 3 was adjusted with the dissolution rates for different KCl contents of the 
Sylvinite  as illustrated in Figure 1.  Figure 4 shows the result of the adjustment.

Figures 6a to 6e illustrating the difference between a cavern temperature of 40°C versus 
60°C. As conservative approach 40°C should be used. 

Operating at 60°C cavern temperature requires at least 90°C hot solvent and will be an 
optimistic scenario. Please note that the shown average data for the KCl brine grade will 
change depending on the solution mining cut height and position. Therefore the estimated 
of the KCl brine grade estimate should be revised accordingly. 

Assuming certain average data for the KCl content of the Sylvinite layer(s) and using the 
empirical expression illustrated in Figure 5 the KCl brine grade can be estimated  for 
different temperature levels as listed in Table 1.

The gain of additional 7 to 10  g/l KCl per 10°C increase of cavern temperature  should be 
compared with the additional energy consumption for heating up the cavern. 

Having in mind the average KCl Content of the Sylvinite ore between 26% and 30% and 
assuming an averaged solution mining operation 140 g/l  to 149 g/l KCl is reachable at 40°C 
and 157 g/l to 170 g/l KCl can be produced at 60 °C cavern temperature.  

It should be noted for future detailing of the KCl brine grade per dual well cavern or for each 
mining cut, that the dissolution rate and KCl grade log was done for a single well only and 
should be combined for a dual well cavern with the second well. The results of both wells 
together will provide an estimate about the KCl brine grade from a specific cavern or from a 
specific mining cut. 

Please note that the KCl brine grade calculated for the average of all three potash layers 
(Patience lake, Belle Plaine and Esterhazy) should be revised during fine tuning of the 
solution mining concept for each dual well cavern. It is obvious that the position of the 
mining cut (blanket level, Injection and production tubing level) will have a significant impact 
on the KCl brine grade at least for the primary mining phase.  

The   KCl brine grade for secondary mining will be close to the maximum KCl brine grade 
found at primary mining but decreasing with masking of the dissolution surface due to 
secondary NaCl crystallization.

3. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 

3.1. Dissolution Kinetics 

The estimates can be summarized regarding the dissolution kinetics as follows: 

• The preliminary  estimate used a  empirical relation between dissolution rate and KCl 
content of the Sylvinite ore for temperatures between 40°C and 80°C.  

• The relation found for the temperatures must be verified by a larger number of 
dissolution tests before it can be used at each future well! 

• The dissolution rate log will allow a better planning of the mining cuts and cavern 
shape development.  

3.2. Phase Chemistry 

The estimates can be summarized regarding the phase chemistry as follows: 

• The data covered a wide range of dissolution paths between 0,0% KCl and 80,0% KCl 
at 40°C to 80°C. 

• The dissolution path of all Sylvinite and Halite samples was assumed as a more or less 
a straight  line following the KCl content of the Sylvinite sample. 

• Deviations of the KCl brine grade due to high contents of insoluble's are considered 
as average values only. 

• The impact of MgCl2 bearing minerals like Carnallite was not considered. 

• The preliminary  estimate of the KCl brine grade used a  empirical relation between 
KCl brine grade and the KCl content of the Sylvinite ore for temperatures between 
40°C and 80°C.  

• Adjusted by the dissolution rate log the KCl brine grade log provides an preliminary 
estimate of KCl brine grade between 40 °C and 80°C over the height of the potash 
layer for the different potash members Patience Lake, Belle Plain and Esterhazy.  

• If the data set will be verified by a larger number of Sylvinite samples, an 
optimization of the mining cuts and prediction of the KCl brine grade for each well 
future (dual well cavern) and for each mining cut is possible. 

• Having in mind the average KCl Content of the Sylvinite ore between 26% and 30% 
and assuming an averaged solution mining operation 140 g/l  to 149 g/l KCl is 
reachable at 40°C and 157 g/l to 170 g/l KCl can be produced at 60 °C cavern 
temperature.  

• The gain of additional 7 to 10  g/l KCl per 10°C increase of cavern temperature  
should be compared with the additional energy consumption for heating up the 
cavern. 

• Running the caverns at 60°C will be an optimistic assumption having in mind the 
deposit temperature of 33 to 38°C

3.3. General Remarks 

Beside the results of the preliminary estimate of the KCl brine grade some general remarks 
are required in order to relativist the results of the dissolution test but also to use these 
results for the planned commercial operation :  

• Considering the geometry of a Sylvinite cavern and during the initial leaching (sump 
leaching) , undercut leaching (roof development) and successive mining cut (primary 
mining) phase it can be assumed that any change of the size and shape of the 
dissolution surface inside the cavern will have an impact on the optimal flow rate and 
subsequently on the KCl brine grade.  

• The radial cavern growth of a cavern can also change if short circuiting occurs in the 
cavern and subsequently the average  withdrawal brine is lower in concentration 
than the brine at the walls of the caverns.  

• The excessive use of a cavern roof protective blanket will have also  an impact on the 
dissolution surface and subsequently on the KCl brine grade. 

• It is crucial to note that, at the start of the non‐selective solution mining operation 
and over longer idle periods of the dissolution process, the concentration of the 
production brine will show deviations when compared with the values from a 
continuous operation. 

• Although it is possible to estimate the expected KCl brine  parameters for a non‐
selective solution mining operation within reasonably limits based on the measured 
dissolution rates and brine sampling,  it is still necessary to verify the parameters by 
the data from a commercial operation. 

• In general sophisticated cavern modeling is recommended in order to get a better 
understanding of the complex interactions between dissolution rate, brine grade, 
dissolution surface and flow rate and radial cavity growth.  

• Pilot test work will provide more accurate data and can confirm the estimates from 
the dissolution test work. But only after a certain time of operation, sufficient 
knowledge will be available to have a better understanding for the estimate of the 
brine grade and the relation to optimal operating parameter.

This document provides a dictionary for the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) 

proposed to be used for planning, scheduling and control of the Muskowekwan Project 

of Encanto Potash Corporation. 

 

The WBS is the framework to be used for planning and scheduling the project by 

identifying and defining work packages, each with a discrete scope of work.  As defined 

by the earned value methodology the WBS is organized into four levels: work areas, 

work packages, tasks, and activities. 

 

Work areas are defined as physical locations where the work will be performed.  The 

seven work areas that have been defined for the Muskowekwan Project are outlined 

below: 

 

• Site General – Area 10 
• Mining Area – 11 
• Milling – Area 30 
• Product handling – Area 31 
• Tailings – Area 50 
• Infrastructure Facilities – Area 60 
• Environmental – Area 70 

 

The following subjects are covered: 

 

For conventional mining: 

• Muskowekwan Project Management 
• Property Infrastructure 
• Production Shaft, Hoists, Headframe 
• Service Shaft, Hoist, Headframe 
• Underground Development and Equipment 
• Shafts Pillar Area 
• Underground Services 
• Surface Buildings related to the mining activity

1191790100-REP-G0004-00 ii 

A solution mining option is also being considered so these items are included: 

• Mine General 
• Wells 
• Well field pumps and piping 
• U/G Controls 
• Mine Dry and Warehouse 
• Mine Offices 
• General 
• Brine storage 
• Evaporation and crystallization 
• Dewatering and Drying 
• Screening and Compaction 
• Fine Solids Handling 

 

There are many common areas and activities which will be required for construction of 

either a conventional mine or a solution mine. In these cases the WBS codes will be the 

same for either situation. In cases where the cost codes cannot be applied to both 

situations the appropriate codes have been identified. 

 

The work areas are broken down into discrete work packages.  Work packages are 

distinguishable high level work elements to be performed in the work area.  Each work 

package is further subdivided into tasks then activities where the work is performed.   

 

The work breakdown structure is the foundation which the Muskowekwan Project 

schedule, plan, cost breakdown, and cost monitoring will be built upon.  It is probably 

the most critical first step to ensure the success of the entire project. 

 

The WBS is broken down into major areas identified by a two digit code; the 

intermediate area identified by a three digit code; a sub area identified by a five digit 

code.

COST ESTIMATE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM – AS APPLIED IN
ENGINEERING, PROCUREMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION FOR

THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES

Recommended Practice No. 18R-97
Cost Estimate Classification System – As Applied in Engineering,
Procurement, and Construction for the Process Industries

June 15, 1998

PURPOSE

As a recommended practice of AACE International, the Cost Estimate Classification System provides
guidelines for applying the general principles of estimate classification to project cost estimates (i.e., cost
estimates that are used to evaluate, approve, and/or fund projects). The Cost Estimate Classification
System maps the phases and stages of project cost estimating together with a generic maturity and
quality matrix, which can be applied across a wide variety of industries.

This addendum to the generic recommended practice provides guidelines for applying the principles
of estimate classification specifically to project estimates for engineering, procurement, and construction
(EPC) work for the process industries. This addendum supplements the generic recommended practice
(17R-97) by providing:

• a section that further defines classification concepts as they apply to the process industries;
• charts that compare existing estimate classification practices in the process industry; and
• a chart that maps the extent and maturity of estimate input information (project definition deliverables)

against the class of estimate.

As with the generic standard, an intent of this addendum is to improve communications among all of
the stakeholders involved with preparing, evaluating, and using project cost estimates specifically for the
process industries.

It is understood that each enterprise may have its own project and estimating processes and
terminology, and may classify estimates in particular ways. This guideline provides a generic and
generally acceptable classification system for process industries that can be used as a basis to compare
against. It is hoped that this addendum will allow each user to better assess, define, and communicate
their own processes and standards in the light of generally-accepted cost engineering practice.

INTRODUCTION

For the purposes of this addendum, the term process industries is assumed to include firms involved
with the manufacturing and production of chemicals, petrochemicals, and hydrocarbon
processing. The common thread among these industries (for the purpose of estimate classification) is
their reliance on process flow diagrams (PFDs) and piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs) as primary
scope defining documents. These documents are key deliverables in determining the level of project
definition, and thus the extent and maturity of estimate input
information.

Estimates for process facilities center on mechanical and chemical process equipment, and they have
significant amounts of piping, instrumentation, and process controls involved. As such, this addendum
may apply to portions of other industries, such as pharmaceutical, utility, metallurgical, converting, and
similar industries. Specific addendums addressing these industries may be developed over time.

This addendum specifically does not address cost estimate classification in nonprocess industries
such as commercial building construction, environmental remediation, transportation infrastructure, "dry"
processes such as assembly and manufacturing, "soft asset" production such as software development,
and similar industries. It also does not specifically address estimates for the exploration, production, or
transportation of mining or hydrocarbon materials, although it may apply to some of the intermediate
processing steps in these systems.

The cost estimates covered by this addendum are for engineering, procurement, and construction
(EPC) work only. It does not cover estimates for the products manufactured by the process facilities, or
for research and development work in support of the process industries. This guideline does not cover the
significant building construction that may be a part of process plants. Building construction will be covered
in a separate addendum.

This guideline reflects generally-accepted cost engineering practices. This addendum was based
upon the practices of a wide range of companies in the process industries from around the world, as well
as published references and standards. Company and public standards were solicited and reviewed by
the AACE International Cost Estimating Committee. The practices were found to have significant
commonalities that are conveyed in this addendum.

COST ESTIMATE CLASSIFICATION MATRIX FOR THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES

The five estimate classes are presented in figure 1 in relationship to the identified characteristics.
Only the level of project definition determines the estimate class. The other four characteristics are
secondary characteristics that are generally correlated with the level of project definition, as discussed in
the generic standard. The characteristics are typical for the process industries but may vary from
application to application.

This matrix and guideline provide an estimate classification system that is specific to the process
industries. Refer to the generic standard for a general matrix that is nonindustry specific, or to other
addendums for guidelines that will provide more detailed information for application in other specific
industries. These will typically provide additional information, such as input deliverable checklists to allow
meaningful categorization in those particular industries.

Notes: [a] The state of process technology and availability of applicable reference cost data affect the range markedly.
The +/- value represents typical percentage variation of actual costs from the cost estimate after application of
contingency (typically at a 50% level of confidence) for given scope.

[b] If the range index value of "1" represents 0.005% of project costs, then an index value of 100 represents 0.5%.
Estimate preparation effort is highly dependent upon the size of the project and the quality of estimating data and
tools.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ESTIMATE CLASSES

The following charts (figures 2a through 2e) provide detailed descriptions of the five estimate
classifications as applied in the process industries. They are presented in the order of least-defined
estimates to the most-defined estimates. These descriptions include brief discussions of each of the
estimate characteristics that define an estimate class.

For each chart, the following information is provided.

• ANSI Standard Reference (1972) Name: this is a reference to the equivalent estimate class in the
existing ANSI standards.

• Alternate Estimate Names, Terms, Expressions, Synonyms: this section provides other
commonly used names that an estimate of this class might be known by. These alternate names are
not endorsed by this Recommended Practice. The user is cautioned that an alternative name may not
always be correlated with the class of estimate as identified in the chart.

• Description: a short description of the class of estimate, including a brief listing of the expected
estimate inputs based on the level of project definition.

• Level of Project Definition Required: expressed as a percent of full definition. For the process
industries, this correlates with the percent of engineering and design complete.

• End Usage: a short discussion of the possible end usage of this class of estimate.
• Estimating Methods Used: a listing of the possible estimating methods that may be employed to

develop an estimate of this class.
• Expected Accuracy Range: typical variation in low and high ranges after the application of

contingency (determined at a 50% level of confidence). Typically, this results in a 90% confidence
that the actual cost will fall within the bounds of the low and high ranges.

• Effort to Prepare: this section provides a typical level of effort (in hours) to produce a complete
estimate for a US$20,000,000 plant. Estimate preparation effort is highly dependent on project size,
project complexity, estimator skills and knowledge, and on the availability of appropriate estimating
cost data and tools.

CLASS 5 ESTIMATE
ANSI Standard Reference Z94.2-1989 Name:
Order of magnitude estimate (typically -30% to +50%).

Alternate Estimate Names, Terms, Expressions,
Synonyms:
Ratio, ballpark, blue sky, seat-of-pants, ROM, idea study,
prospect estimate, concession license estimate,
guesstimate, rule-of-thumb.

Description:
Class 5 estimates are generally prepared based on very
limited information, and subsequently have wide accuracy
ranges. As such, some companies and organizations have
elected to determine that due to the inherent inaccuracies,
such estimates cannot be classified in a conventional and
systemic manner. Class 5 estimates, due to the
requirements of end use, may be prepared within a very
limited amount of time and with little effort expended—
sometimes requiring less than an hour to prepare. Often,
little more than proposed plant type, location, and capacity
are known at the time of estimate preparation.

Level of Project Definition Required:
0% to 2% of full project definition.

End Usage:
Class 5 estimates are prepared for any number of strategic
business planning purposes, such as but not limited to
market studies, assessment of initial viability, evaluation of
alternate schemes, project screening, project location
studies, evaluation of resource needs and budgeting, long-
range capital planning, etc.

Estimating Methods Used:
Class 5 estimates virtually always use stochastic
estimating methods such as cost/capacity curves and
factors, scale of operations factors, Lang factors, Hand
factors, Chilton factors, Peters-Timmerhaus factors,
Guthrie factors, and other parametric and modeling
techniques.

Expected Accuracy Range:
Typical accuracy ranges for Class 5 estimates are - 20% to
-50% on the low side, and +30% to +100% on the high
side, depending on the technological complexity of the
project, appropriate reference information, and the
inclusion of an appropriate contingency determination.
Ranges could exceed those shown in unusual
circumstances.

Effort to Prepare (for US$20MM project):
As little as 1 hour or less to perhaps more than 200 hours,
depending on the project and the estimating methodology
used.

CLASS 4 ESTIMATE
ANSI Standard Reference Z94.2-1989 Name:
Budget estimate (typically -15% to + 30%).

Alternate Estimate Names, Terms, Expressions,
Synonyms:
Screening, top-down, feasibility, authorization, factored,
pre-design, pre-study.

Description:
Class 4 estimates are generally prepared based on limited
information and subsequently have fairly wide accuracy
ranges. They are typically used for project screening,
determination of feasibility, concept evaluation, and
preliminary budget approval. Typically, engineering is from
1% to 5% complete, and would comprise at a minimum the
following: plant capacity, block schematics, indicated
layout, process flow diagrams (PFDs) for main process
systems, and
preliminary engineered process and utility equipment lists.

Level of Project Definition Required:
1% to 15% of full project definition.

End Usage:
Class 4 estimates are prepared for a number of purposes,
such as but not limited to, detailed strategic planning,
business development, project screening at more
developed stages, alternative scheme analysis,
confirmation of economic and/or technical feasibility, and
preliminary budget approval or approval to proceed to next
stage.

Estimating Methods Used:
Class 4 estimates virtually always use stochastic
estimating methods such as equipment factors, Lang
factors, Hand factors, Chilton factors, Peters-Timmerhaus
factors, Guthrie factors, the Miller method, gross unit
costs/ratios, and other parametric and modeling
techniques.

Expected Accuracy Range:
Typical accuracy ranges for Class 4 estimates are -15% to
-30% on the low side, and +20% to +50% on the high side,
depending on the technological complexity of the project,
appropriate reference information, and the inclusion of an
appropriate contingency determination. Ranges could
exceed those shown in unusual circumstances.

Effort to Prepare (for US$20MM project):
Typically, as little as 20 hours or less to perhaps more than
300 hours, depending on the project and the estimating
methodology used.

Figure 2b. – Class 4 Estimate

CLASS 3 ESTIMATE
ANSI Standard Reference Z94.2-1989 Name:
Budget estimate (typically -15% to + 30%).

Alternate Estimate Names, Terms, Expressions,
Synonyms:
Budget, scope, sanction, semi-detailed, authorization,
preliminary control, concept study, development, basic
engineering phase estimate, target estimate.

Description:
Class 3 estimates are generally prepared to form the basis
for budget authorization, appropriation, and/or funding. As
such, they typically form the initial control estimate against
which all actual costs and resources will be monitored.
Typically, engineering is from 10% to 40% complete, and
would comprise at a minimum the following: process flow
diagrams, utility flow
diagrams, preliminary piping and instrument diagrams, plot
plan, developed layout drawings, and essentially complete
engineered process and utility equipment lists.

Level of Project Definition Required:
10% to 40% of full project definition.

End Usage:
Class 3 estimates are typically prepared to support full
project funding requests, and become the first of the
project phase "control estimates" against which all actual
costs and resources will be monitored for variations to the
budget. They are used as the project budget until replaced
by more detailed estimates. In many owner organizations,
a Class 3 estimate may be the last estimate required and
could well form the only basis for cost/schedule control.

Estimating Methods Used:
Class 3 estimates usually involve more deterministic
estimating methods than stochastic methods. They usually
involve a high degree of unit cost line items, although these
may be at an assembly level of detail rather than individual
components. Factoring and other stochastic methods may
be used to estimate less-significant areas of the project.

Expected Accuracy Range:
Typical accuracy ranges for Class 3 estimates are -10% to
-20% on the low side, and +10% to +30% on the high side,
depending on the technological complexity of the project,
appropriate reference information, and the inclusion of an
appropriate contingency determination. Ranges could
exceed those shown in unusual circumstances.

Effort to Prepare (for US$20MM project):
Typically, as little as 150 hours or less to perhaps more
than 1,500 hours, depending on the project and the
estimating methodology used.

CLASS 2 ESTIMATE
ANSI Standard Reference Z94.2-1989 Name:
Definitive estimate (typically -5% to + 15%).

Alternate Estimate Names, Terms, Expressions,
Synonyms:
Detailed control, forced detail, execution phase, master
control, engineering, bid, tender, change order estimate.

Description:
Class 2 estimates are generally prepared to form a detailed
control baseline against which all project  work is monitored
in terms of cost and progress control. For contractors, this
class of estimate is often used as the "bid" estimate to
establish contract value. Typically, engineering is from 30%
to 70% complete, and would comprise at a minimum the
following: process flow diagrams, utility flow diagrams,
piping and instrument diagrams, heat and material
balances, final plot plan, final layout drawings, complete
engineered process and utility equipment lists, single line
diagrams for electrical, electrical equipment and motor
schedules, vendor quotations, detailed project execution
plans, resourcing and work force plans, etc.

Level of Project Definition Required:
30% to 70% of full project definition.

End Usage:
Class 2 estimates are typically prepared as the detailed
control baseline against which all actual costs and
resources will now be monitored for variations to the
budget, and form a part of the change/variation control
program.

Estimating Methods Used:
Class 2 estimates always involve a high degree of
deterministic estimating methods. Class 2 estimates are
prepared in great detail, and often involve tens of
thousands of unit cost line items. For those areas of the
project still undefined, an assumed level of detail takeoff
(forced detail) may be developed to use as line items in the
estimate instead of relying on factoring methods.

Expected Accuracy Range:
Typical accuracy ranges for Class 2 estimates are -5% to
-15% on the low side, and +5% to +20% on the high side,
depending on the technological complexity of the project,
appropriate reference information, and the inclusion of an
appropriate contingency determination. Ranges could
exceed those shown in unusual circumstances.

Effort to Prepare (for US$20MM project):
Typically, as little as 300 hours or less to perhaps more
than 3,000 hours, depending on the project and the
estimating methodology used. Bid estimates typically
require more effort than estimates used for funding or
control purposes.

Figure 2d. – Class 2 Estimate

CLASS 1 ESTIMATE
ANSI Standard Reference Z94.2 Name:
Definitive estimate (typically -5% to + 15%).

Alternate Estimate Names, Terms, Expressions,
Synonyms:
Full detail, release, fall-out, tender, firm price, bottoms-up,
final, detailed control, forced detail, execution phase,
master control, fair price, definitive, change order estimate.

Description:
Class 1 estimates are generally prepared for discrete parts
or sections of the total project rather than generating this
level of detail for the entire project. The parts of the project
estimated at this level of detail will typically be used by
subcontractors for bids, or by owners for check estimates.
The updated estimate is often referred to as the current
control estimate and becomes the new baseline for
cost/schedule control of the project. Class 1 estimates may
be prepared for parts of the project to comprise a fair price
estimate or bid check estimate to compare against a
contractor's bid estimate, or to evaluate/dispute claims.
Typically, engineering is from 50% to 100% complete, and
would comprise virtually all engineering and design
documentation of the project, and complete project
execution and commissioning plans.

Level of Project Definition Required:
50% to 100% of full project definition.

End Usage:
Class 1 estimates are typically prepared to form a current
control estimate to be used as the final control baseline
against which all actual costs and resources will now be
monitored for variations to the budget, and form a part of
the change/variation control program. They may be used to
evaluate bid checking, to support vendor/contractor
negotiations, or for claim evaluations and dispute
resolution.

Estimating Methods Used:
Class 1 estimates involve the highest degree of
deterministic estimating methods, and require a great
amount of effort. Class 1 estimates are prepared in great
detail, and thus are usually performed on only the most
important or critical areas of the project. All items in the
estimate are usually unit cost line items based on actual
design quantities.

Expected Accuracy Range:
Typical accuracy ranges for Class 1 estimates are -3% to
-10% on the low side, and +3% to +15% on the high side,
depending on the technological complexity of the project,
appropriate reference information, and the inclusion of an
appropriate contingency determination. Ranges could
exceed those shown in unusual circumstances.

Effort to Prepare (for US$20MM project):
Class 1 estimates require the most effort to create, and as
such are generally developed for only selected areas of the
project, or for bidding purposes. A complete Class 1
estimate may involve as little as 600 hours or less, to
perhaps more than 6,000 hours, depending on the project
and the estimating methodology used. Bid estimates
typically require more effort than estimates used for funding
or control purposes.

ESTIMATE INPUT CHECKLIST AND MATURITY MATRIX

Figure 4 maps the extent and maturity of estimate input information (deliverables) against the five
estimate classification levels. This is a checklist of basic deliverables found in common practice in the
process industries. The maturity level is an approximation of the degree of completion of the deliverable.
The degree of completion is indicated by the following letters.

• None (blank): development of the deliverable has not begun.
• Started (S): work on the deliverable has begun. Development is typically limited to sketches, rough

outlines, or similar levels of early completion.
• Preliminary (P): work on the deliverable is advanced. Interim, cross-functional reviews have usually

been conducted. Development may be near completion except for final reviews and approvals.
• Complete (C): the deliverable has been reviewed and approved as appropriate.
