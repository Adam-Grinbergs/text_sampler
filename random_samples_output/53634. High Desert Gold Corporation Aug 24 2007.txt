1.0 SUMMARY 

High Desert Gold Corporation (the "Company") has acquired the Canasta Dorada gold 
asset through its wholly owned subsidiary, General Minerals Corporation, a Delaware 
company. The Company plans on advancing the property through continued geologic and 
geophysical work during the coming year which will include a drill program to test the 
targets which have been defined through the exploration of the property. 

The Canasta Dorada project lies within the newly discovered gold belt in northern 
Sonora, Mexico.  Exploration of this property is currently in the initial stages, and the 
results from geologic mapping and geochemical sampling suggest that there is potential 
for significant gold mineralization in several areas on the Property. These include: the 
Big Pit area where Jurassic sedimentary rock units are mineralized along low angle 
structures, and in the Pique Viejo and Placer areas where high-angle faults and shear 
zones with stockwork veining cut sedimentary and intrusive rock units and a newly 
discovered area on the Canasta concession. This latter area returned gold values of up to 
24.1 grams per ton ("gpt") from an old prospect pit on a quartz vein, 9.07 gpt from a 0.4 
metres ('m") wide vein and 7.05 gpt from a 0.8 m wide vein.  Sampling in the primary 
target area, the Big Pit area, has resulted in 143 rock chip samples that average 1.2 gpt 
gold in sheared and mineralized Jurassic sediments and dikes.  The geologic setting, 
structures and host lithologies are similar to other nearby deposits, including Chanate, 
which is currently being developed 25 kilometres to the southeast of Canasta Dorada.  

The total property position controlled by the Company is approximately 448 square 
kilometres. The land is held as concessions and the Company has also secured surface 
use agreements from the local ranchers in the area of the Basurero concessions 
surrounding  the Big Pit area. 

Gold prospects are scattered across northwest Sonora, and were historically prospected 
for high-grade ores on a small scale from as early as the 1700's to present day (Martinez, 
1998).  In the last two decades, following modifications in the Mexican "Reglamentary 
Law of Article 27", modern exploration has focused mainly on bulk tonnage targets, and 
have produced a number of significant discoveries of economic importance (Silberman, 
et al., 1988; Jacques and Clark, 1998).  A few of these deposits have already been mined 
out (Summers and Hufford, 1998), one is in development stage (Clarke, 2006) and 
another has been increasingly productive for several years (la Garza, Noguez, et al., 
1998).  Examples of the gold deposits along this trend include Mesquite and Picacho in 
the Yuma area of extreme southwestern Arizona, and La Choya, La Herradura and 
Chanate in the Caborca region of northwest Sonora, Mexico (Figure 1).  Mesquite and 
Picacho were the first modern mines in the Northern Sonoran Gold Belt to open and 
produce gold during the 1980's.  They were soon followed by Hecla's La Choya deposit 
in the 1994.  Soon thereafter, a Newmont-Penoles joint venture announced the discovery 
of La Herradura in a remote, sand-covered desert near the Gulf of California.  Penoles 
became the mine operator; and, from what was initially considered to be of a minimal 
size, low-grade deposit, La Herradura has grown into a multi-million ounce operation 
with ever increasing "total" gold reserves.  Chanate, located a few kilometres east of 
Caborca, is currently in mine development by Capital Gold Corporation and has many 



 

2 

similarities to the Canasta Dorada project, and has a resource approaching a million 
ounces (Clarke, 2006) with indicated potential for an additional 500,000 ounces of 
possible production at current elevated gold prices.  Therefore, the Company's Canasta 
Dorada property lies within a known auriferous region where significant new discoveries 
are still being found.  Preliminary geological and geochemical data at Canasta Dorada 
suggest there is potential for gold mineralization similar to that currently being developed 
at nearby Chanate. 
 
Detailed geological mapping and sampling by the Company has focused on the northern 
portion of the Basurero claim group, primarily in the vicinity of the Big Pit area, with 
reconnaissance work in the Placer area, and to the south and southwest in the Pique Viejo 
area (see Figure 10 and 11).  Mineralization exposed in the Big Pit consists of a series of 
trenches that were excavated by the claimant during the 1980's to expose a flat-lying 
mineralized zone and provides a window into the complex geology that lies beneath the 
pediment cover.  These trenches provide the best vertical exposure of the sedimentary 
units and low-angle structures on the Property, which is hidden beneath Quaternary 
alluvial material. 
 
At Canasta Dorada, gold mineralization has been identified in three primary areas to date, 
including the Big Pit, Pique Viejo and Placer areas as well as within  an area in the 
northeast corner of the newly located Canasta concession (Figure 10, and 11). 
 
Big Pit area:  The Big Pit area consists of a series of north-south trenches that expose 
Jurassic sedimentary rocks that have been intensely sheared, folded, cleaved, intruded, 
altered and mineralized along a brittle-ductile thrust fault zone.  The mineralized zone is 
exposed for a thickness of 60 m and appears to be open at depth and characterized by 
intense deformation, anastamosing shears and slip surfaces that appear to strike roughly 
north-south and dips very shallowly to the west, almost conformable with the attitude of 
the overlying sediments.  These are overlying units that have been silicified, brecciated 
and are crosscut by quartz veins.  
 
Pique Viejo area: Pique Viejo area is located along the southern portion of the claim 
block, where northwest-striking shear zones and veins have been mined by numerous 
prospect pits and shafts.  The most significant structures in this area are several west-
northwest-striking faults (Figure 8).  Prospects and shafts along and adjacent to these 
structures exploit dilational quartz veins that strike northwest, west-northwest, and to the 
north-northeast.   
 
Placer area: The Placer area is located to the east in an area that is currently being worked 
for placer gold (see Figure 6). In the area of dry placer workings, a major west-northwest-
striking mineralized structure is present, largely covered by alluvium.  The fault zone cuts 
off and displaces a tabular granodiorite body that crops out just north of the placers.  A 
wide (50 to 100 m) zone of alteration and brecciation host quartz veining and orange-
brown iron oxide staining along the fault zone where they are exposed in the base of the 
placers.  Many minor shears and fractures host limonite and quartz veinlets striking west-
northwest to northwest.  Brecciation and indications of shear are noted on many of these 



 

3 

surfaces.  The mineralization occurs in both the Jurassic sedimentary rocks and in 
hornblende granodiorite that are cut by these structures.  This structural zone with its 
mineralization appears to be the source for the gold in the dry placer workings, and may 
extend beneath alluvium to the east of these workings.   
 
The initial exploration program has identified several high priority target areas for gold 
mineralization. The presence of alluvial cover prevents a complete investigation without 
a trenching or drilling program to investigate the vertical and lateral dimensions of the 
areas of known mineralization. 
 
Additional surface work is recommended for the Canasta Dorada property, which would 
focus on collecting additional detailed geologic information from mapping, additional 
geochemical sampling, trenching where feasible, and a Phase One 13,000 m drill 
program. This work has the potential to outline a significant zone of gold mineralization 
in the Big Pit area and the placer area, and may identify additional high-priority targets 
within the property.  The Company has developed plans for a trenching and initial drill 
program that would test the thickness, extent and grade in the Big Pit area, as well as  
some of the stockwork targets in the Placer area. A Phase One drill program, which 
would consist of 13,000 m of core, and would be followed by a second phase pending 
analysis of the results.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

2.1 Terms of Reference 

Kurt T. Katsura, Registered Professional Geologist ("RPG"), a Qualified Person defined 
under National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"), was retained by the Company to 
prepare a Technical Report on the Canasta Dorada property (the "Property") located in 
the State of Sonora, Mexico. The Company believes that the success of its exploration 
program in 2006 on the Property has resulted in material changes that warrant the 
preparation of a Technical Report meeting the requirements of NI 43-101.  The Company 
has engaged the writer, Kurt T. Katsura, RPG, to undertake an independent, technical 
review of the Property, which is documented in this report. This Technical Report is 
based on observations made and samples taken during my visit to Canasta Dorada from 
November 7, 2006 through November 8, 2006. Geologic and land status maps, assay 
certificates from geochemical sampling, and geophysical results were supplied by the 
Company.  I have also made use of information from other sources generated by other 
geoscientists and have listed the sources in the report as references.  

2.2 Purpose of Report 

The purpose of this review is to provide the Company and its investors with a summary 
of the Canasta Dorada property, including an independent opinion as to the technical 
merits of the project and the appropriate manner of conducting the continuing 
exploration. It is intended that this report may be submitted to those Canadian stock 
exchanges and regulatory agencies that may require it. It is further intended that the 
Company may use the report for any lawful purpose to which it is suited.  

2.3 Sources of Information 

The technical information was generated by the Company during the fall of 2006. 
Geologic maps, results from geochemical sampling and geophysical results were supplied 
by the Company.  I verified interpretations and results in the field during a visit to the 
Property. 

2.4 Scope of Personal Inspection of the Property 

I conducted a site visit in November 2006 to review the surface sampling and mapping 
program on the Property, and to directly examine the geological units, style of 
mineralization, and to conduct limited independent sampling.  This information was 
utilized in compiling this report. 

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

I have visited the Property, collected samples from outcrops and reviewed and verified 
previous geologic interpretations of the data. In preparation of this report, I have relied on 
technical reports and data prepared by geologists of the Company.  To the best of my 



 

5 

knowledge, it is my understanding that this work was carried out in accordance with 
former National Policy 2-A, and would have been carried out by or under the direction of 
a qualified person given the current definition under NI 43-101.  However, I have not 
determined if the providers of information are "Qualified Persons" as defined in NI 43-
101. 

4.0 PROPERTY LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION 

4.1 Property Location 

The Canasta Dorada property is located in the northwest corner of the State of Sonora, 
Mexico, in the Municipality of Caborca.  The  primary target area on the property is 
approximately 28 kilometres ("km") north of Caborca, approximately 285 km north of 
Hermosillo, and is 190 km southwest of Tucson, Arizona, at UTM NAD 27 Mexico 
E387,000, N3,418,800.  Caborca is the nearest town with a population of approximately 
70,000 and is located along Highway 2, the major two-lane highway across northern 
Mexico (Figure 1).  Access to the Property is via improved dirt roads north from 
Caborca, past the city landfill, for 4 km and then northwest along improved ranch roads 
for an additional 18 km to the Property.  The total property position controlled by the 
Company consists of approximately 44,819 hectares ("ha"). The land is held as 
concessions and through an option agreement and the Company has also secured surface 
use agreements from ranches in the concession areas.

4.2 Property Description 

The Canasta Dorada gold property consists of a total of seven concessions which 
includes, El Basurero, El Basurero No. 2 and El Basurero No. 3, Batamote and Batamote 
1, Canasta and Canasta 1 covering 448 square kilometres, as shown in Figure 3. The 
Company has entered a purchase agreement for the El Basurero, El Basurero No. 2, and 
El Basurero No. 3 concessions with the underlying owner David Figueroa Coronado. The 
three concessions cover an area totalling 159 ha and require payments of US$3,054.97 in 
2007 to the Mexican Government to maintain them in good standing.  

Under Mexican regulations, the concessions (claims) are staked by erecting (or utilizing 
existing) surveyed monuments from which the corners of the claim are defined by written 
description. The actual location of the claim is determined from the point of location of 
the mineral monument in the field. Title to the claim is by a normal license ("Titulo de 
Concesion Minera de Exploracion") registered with the Mines Division of the Mexican 
Government (Secretaria de Economia, Coordinacion General de Mineria, Direcion 
General de Minas) and is considered secure. The title for the El Basurero, El Basurero 
No. 2 and El Basurero No. 3 are registered in the name of David Figueroa Coronado.  

Mining and mineral exploration by foreign companies is welcome and encouraged by the 
government of Mexico. 

Semi-annual surface taxes and annual exploration expenditures are required to maintain 
the claims in good standing indefinitely.

The Company has entered into surface use agreements with the ranchers who control the 
surface rights within the concession area. The agreements will allow for access, 
exploration and development of the lands under claim as well as a Right of First Refusal 
for the purchase of the Property. The agreements have terms of five years and require 
annual payments of US$5,000 and US$8,000, respectively. 

In January of 2007 Genminmex located and staked two concessions, one in the area of 
the Basurero agreement, (Canasta concession) and the other just to the west of the El 
Chanate mine, (Canasta 1). 

Effective June 1, 2007, Genminmex entered into an agreement with Vancouver-based 
TUMI Resources Limited ("TUMI") and its Mexican subsidiary, TMXI Resources S.A., 
("TMXI") whereby Genminmex can earn up to a 70% interest in the 35,180 ha Batamote 
concessions staked and controlled by TMXI (the "Batamote Agreement").  The TMXI 
mineral concessions surround the Company's Canasta Dorada gold property and adjoins 
the Canasta and Canasta 1 concessions.  To earn an initial 60% interest in the TMXI 
concessions under the Batamote Agreement, Genminmex must incur expenditures on the 
property of US$2,000,000 in the first five years, with minimum annual expenditure 
amounts of US$100,000 in the first year, an aggregate of US$350,000 by the end of the 
second year and aggregate of $700,000 by the end of the third year.  If Genminmex does 
not incur the full US$100,000 of expenditures by the end of the first year, it must pay to 
TMXI the difference between US$100,000 and the amount of actual expenditures 
incurred on the TMXI concessions during the year.  Once Genminmex has earned the 
60% interest, it may increase its interest to 70% by incurring an additional US$3,000,000 
of expenditures or by completing a final feasibility study on the TMXI concessions by 
June 1, 2014.  With the addition of the TMXI concessions, the Company's total land 
package in this area is 448 square kilometres, as shown in Figure 3.

During the time spent on the Property for the purpose of this investigation, there were no 
obvious environmental liabilities identified.  No tailings ponds or waste piles were noted.  
There are several old cuts which do not appear to pose a safety hazard or liability. 

Prior to initiating a drill program, a proposed Plan of Operations must be registered with 
NORMA 120 ECOL, which is the Mexican federal environmental oversight agency. 

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Access 

Access to the Property is gained overland from Caborca, which lies along Highway 2, the 
major two-lane highway across northern Mexico.  A graded gravel road extends for 8 km 
north from Caborca, which passes the landfill on the north side of town, and thence 
follows improved dirt ranch roads for 20 km to the Property.  The Company has entered 



 

9 

into surface use agreements with the local ranch owners for access, exploration and 
development of the lands under claim as well as a Right of First Refusal for the purchase 
of the Property. 

5.2 Climate 

Climate is typical for the Sonoran Desert, with relatively dry, cool to moderate winters 
with temperatures ranging from -2-10oC, and hot summers with temperatures that average 
40-45oC.  Rainfall is heaviest during the summer monsoon season and from Pacific storm 
systems which generally last from June through early September.  Average annual 
precipitation is 259 mm, as recorded at nearby Pitiquito station, which is located 
approximately 30 km southeast of the Property. 

5.3 Local Resources 

The Property is readily accessible from Caborca, which has a population of 
approximately 70,000, where there is a capable supply of any labor, equipment or service 
requirements for conducting exploration or mining related activities.  Caborca is located 
along Highway 2 and there is ready access to Hermosillo, Tucson and other major supply 
centers.  The Property is easily accessible from the paved highway via approximately 8 
km of improved dirt access roads and then 20 km of dirt ranch roads which cross low 
hills with a gently undulating topography. 

5.4 Infrastructure 

Currently there is little infrastructure at Canasta Dorada. However, improved gravel roads 
and power lines do cross southern portions of the Property or are in close proximity.  The 
status of available water is unknown, but several of the prospect shafts contained water 
during November 2006.  Caborca is currently the closest source for electricity and a 
reliable water source.   

5.5 Physiography 

The Property has sufficient area and the gently rolling topography is such that the 
Property could be developed by typical open-pit or underground mining methods. It 
should be noted that this is an exploration property in the early stages of investigation and 
no detailed studies have been conducted for a mine plan and layout, which would include 
the location of storage, waste disposal, and processing areas.  

The Canasta Dorada property is located in the northwest corner of the state of Sonora, 
within the Altar desert, which is a subset of the Sonoran desert, at an elevation of 850 m 
and is bordered on the north by Cerro Basura and the Sierra la Gloria.  These are NW-SE 
oriented mountain ranges that are typical Basin and Range fault blocks.  The Property lies 
in the dissected undulating hills that slope gently to the south, which are covered by 
alluvial and pediment veneer and are to the south of the ranges.  The hills within the 
Property are incised by drainages that locally follow traces of underlying bedrock 
structures and expose low-angle thrust faults, a possible detachment fault and several NW 
striking, high-angle structures.  The entire property area is vegetated and covered by a 



 

10 

moderate density of cacti, creosote, and sparse grasses.  The surface in the Property is 
currently utilized for grazing cattle.  

6.0 HISTORY 

Very little is known about the early prospecting in the project area.  Historical workings 
are scattered across the claims in several distinct areas, that include: shallow trenches and 
pits that exploited alluvial deposits directly overlying an area of NW-striking stockwork 
veins in the "Placer Area"; shafts and pits that explore steeply dipping NW-striking veins 
and sheared structures in the "Pique Viejo area"; and the mineralized low-angle structures 
and faults in the "Big Pit area", which has been the focus of the Company's exploration 
work.  Based on local sources and historical evidence, it appears that the "Pique Viejo 
area" was possibly worked during the late 1800's through early 1900's.  In the Placer 
area, there is evidence of old pits and trenches and dry wash equipment indicating that the 
area is still being used by locals to recover gold on a seasonal basis, possibly during the 
monsoon season when there is available water in the draws.

trenching, Sierra La Gloria in the background. 

The Big Pit area consists of a number of trenches and open cuts that were exploited 
during the 1980's and were probably developed around earlier working similar to those in 
the "Pique Viejo area".

The Company has entered a purchase agreement for the El Basurero, El Basurero No. 2, 
and El Basurero No. 3 concessions with the underlying owner David Figueroa Coronado. 
The three concessions cover an area totalling 159 ha and require payments of 
US$3,054.97 to the Mexican Government in 2007 to maintain them in good standing. 

In January of 2007 Genminmex located two concessions, one in the area of the Basurero 
agreement, (Canasta concession) and the other just to the west of the El Chanate mine, 
(Canasta 1). These concessions cover 9,639 ha within the Sonoran Gold belt. 

Effective June 1, 2007, Genminmex entered into an agreement with Vancouver-based 
TUMI Resources Limited ("TUMI") and its Mexican subsidiary, TMXI Resources S.A., 
("TMXI") whereby Genminmex can earn up to a 70% interest in the 35,180 ha Batamote 
concessions staked and controlled by TMXI (the "Batamote Agreement").  The TMXI 
mineral concessions surround the Company's Canasta Dorada gold property and adjoins 
the Canasta and Canasta 1 concessions.  To earn an initial 60% interest in the TMXI 
concessions under the Batamote Agreement, Genminmex must incur expenditures on the 
property of US$2,000,000 in the first five years, with minimum annual expenditure 
amounts of US$100,000 in the first year, an aggregate of US$350,000 by the end of the 
second year and aggregate of $700,000 by the end of the third year.  If Genminmex does 
not incur the full US$100,000 of expenditures by the end of the first year, it must pay to 



 

12 

TMXI the difference between US$100,000 and the amount of actual expenditures 
incurred on the TMXI concessions during the year.  Once Genminmex has earned the 
60% interest, it may increase its interest to 70% by incurring an additional US$3,000,000 
of expenditures or by completing a final feasibility study on the TMXI concessions by 
June 1, 2014.  With the addition of the TMXI concessions, the Company's total land 
package in this area is 448 square kilometres. 

Mining on the concession was conducted by the underlying owner in 1980 and lasted 
only a few months. Material was excavated by open cut, crushed and run through a 
gravity circuit to recover the coarse gold. The remaining material was subjected to 
cyanide leaching in an offsite location to recover the remaining gold. The operation was 
terminated due to declining prices and lack of permits for the cyanidation process. Total 
material removed during the open cut production was less then 5,000 tons. There is 
evidence of older dry wash placer operations on portions of the Property, but there are no 
records documenting the time or extent of this production.  There is also evidence of

1990's.

7.0 GEOLOGIC SETTING 

7.1 Regional Overview 

The geology of northwest Sonora is complex and records the early development along the 
edge of the North American craton, with a possible accreted Jurassic volcanic arc terrane, 
regional metamorphism is associated with the emplacement of intrusions and orogenic 



 

13 

episodes, followed by Basin and Range-style rifting.  A prominent structural zone, the 
Mohave-Sonora megashear, strikes northwest through the region and has played an 
important role in the formation of mineral deposits in the region (Campbell, et al., 1998; 
Jacques and Clark, 1998). 

The oldest rocks in the region occur in the Caborca terrane, where Precambrian 
lithologies consisting of an assemblage of schist, gneiss, amphibolite and quartzite are 
often cut by slightly younger intrusions of latite and diorite (Anderson and Silver, 1979).  
These rocks have been correlated with slaty and greenschist-grade metamorphic rocks 
found in portions of northeast Sonora and adjacent parts of Arizona where have been 
correlated with the Pinal schist (Jacques and Clark, 1998).  Overlying sedimentary rocks 
of Late Proterozoic age consist of shallow marine clastic and carbonate units that 
unconformably overlie the schist and other crystalline rocks along the margins of the 
North American craton, and include a number locally named individual formations.  
Sedimentation continued through much of the Paleozoic across northwestern and eastern 
Sonora, with several recognizable breaks and units that have been correlated with the 
Paleozoic sediments of the Colorado Plateau (Jacques and Clark, 1998).  Crustal 
shortening in Late Mississippian and Late Permian-Early Triassic along the craton 
margin juxtapose deeper water sediments with shallow water and clastic sediments.  In 
eastern Sonora, continental sediments were deposited during the Triassic, in contrast to 
the marine deposits that accumulated in northwestern Sonora (Jacques and Clark, 1998).  
Volcanic arc magmatism became active during the Jurassic, and these rocks are common 
along the northern segment of the Sonora gold belt as well as in the Caborca terrane 
(Merriam and Eells, 1979; Molina, et al., 1998).   

The Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks include the Bisbee Group, which 
is widespread throughout southern Arizona and northern Sonora.  The Bisbee Group 
rocks consist of the Glance Conglomerate, Morita Formation, the Mural Limestone and 
the Cintura Formation (Jacques, 1995).  These units were deposited in a coastal to 
shallow marine environment, with some deep-water facies identified in eastern Sonora.  
The El Chanate Group, of Late Cretaceous age, unconformably overlie the Bisbee Group 
and consist of continental sediments with some intercalated volcanic rocks (Jacques, et 
al., 1990).  The type section for the El Chanate Group is in the Sierra El Chanate, 
approximately 10 km northeast of the Canasta Dorada property, where it ranges from 750 
m to more than 2800 m thick (Jacques, 1993).  In the type section, the El Chanate Group 
has been subdivided into the Pozo Duro, Anita, and Escalante formations, from oldest to 
youngest.  The Pozo Duro Formation consists of red mudstone and shale with intercalated 
tan sandstone and conglomerates.  The Anita Formation consists of andesite breccias, 
fluvial conglomerates, sandstones and mudstones, and an upper unit that contains tan 
shales and gray limestone.  Recent workers have suggested that the El Chanate Group 
may in fact underlie the Bisbee Group (Nourse, 2001), and be Jurassic in age.  The Late 
Cretaceous Tarahumara Formation consists of andesite breccias, flows and tuffs that are 
equivalent to the El Charro volcanic complex (Jacques, 1993) and unconformably overlie 
the older rock units. 

Tertiary volcanic units are relatively uncommon in northwestern Sonora, and are more 
common to the east near Cananea, where they are the equivalent of the plateau-forming 



 

14 

sequences in the Sierra Madre Occidental, and consist of rhyodacite to rhyolite flows, 
tuffs and breccias intercalated with basalts and andesites (Roldan and Clark, 1992).  
Upper Tertiary sediments accumulated in some of the extensional basins that developed 
in the Parallel Ranges and the Buried Ranges, west of Caborca.  Some of these contain 
borate deposits and are intercalated with Late Tertiary volcanic flows and breccias 
(Miranda et al., 1998).  Late Tertiary volcanic rocks consist of thin basalt flows, cinder 
cones and tuffs, particularly in the Pinacate volcanic field (Gutman and Sheridan, 1978). 

Quaternary alluvial, eolian and talus deposits cover much of the region, and commonly 
form a pediment cover that obscures the bedrock.  The depth to bedrock is not well 
known and ranges from a few m to over 200 m near Caborca and up to 1,100 m deep 
along the coastal plain west of Hermosillo (Verdugo, 1983).    

Intrusive rocks include anorogenic granites of 1,460-1,410 Ma that are found within the 
Precambrian terranes, and the Abio granite found in the Caborca terrane (Jacques and 
Clark, 1998).  Several plutons and hypabyssal phases occur within the Jurassic volcanic 
arc sequence, and include calc-alkaline batholithic phases emplaced during the 90-40 Ma 
interval (Damon, et al., 1983).  Two mica granites were emplaced in the 40-36 Ma 
interval, and are spatially associated with part of the Ancochi Batholith, and are present at 
the La Colorada mine (Zawada, 1998). 

The tectonic development of northern Sonora include thrusting of Paleozoic sedimentary 
rocks in the late Mississippian and Late Permian to Early Triassic, left-lateral 
displacement along the Mohave-Sonora megashear in the middle to Late Juarassic, 
Sevier-style thrusting in the Early to Late Cretaceous, and Late Cretaceous Laramide-
style thrusting with vergence to the northeast (Jacques and Clark, 1998).  The Cenozoic 
tectonic events are characterized by the development of core complexes and low-angle 
detachment faults in the mid-Tertiary (Nourse, et al., 1994; Nourse, 1995), and younger 
Basin and Range normal faulting and the formation of the Gulf of California in the Late 
Miocene to Pliocene (Sedlock, et al., 1993).  Pleistocene and Quaternary erosion and 
alluvial sedimentation have formed vast pediment cover and veneers throughout the 
region, including extensive fill among the Buried Ranges. 

Exploration and discoveries of gold mineralization throughout northwestern Sonora, has 
increased since 1990.  Many of the new deposits currently being mined exploit low-grade 
(1-2 gpt gold), micron size, disseminated mineralization along a northwest-trending zone 
characterized traces of the Mojave-Sonora megashear, a broad NW-striking structural 
zone, and northeast regional thrusts and associated tear faults in the northwestern portion 
of the zone (Silver and Anderson, 1974; Jacques and Clark, 1998). Deposit types include 
veins and breccias, discontinuous quartz veins, a carbonate sedimentary-hosted deposit 
and several structurally controlled deposits. Mineralization is hosted by a wide range of 
rock units, including Proterozoic gneiss, Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, Late Jurassic 
granitic rocks and Cretaceous clastic and carbonate units (Jacques and Clark, 1998). 
Recent erosion of pre-existing terrains and alluvial deposits have resulted in locally 
extensive Late Tertiary placer gold deposits near Caborca (Jacques and Clark, 1998; 
Southworth, J.R., 1998). 



 

15 

The gold deposits in northwestern Sonora are found along or adjacent to the Mohave-
Sonora megashear, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 7, including several mines that are 
located along projections of this trend in the United States, including Picacho, Mesquite 
and Cargo Muchacho.  At Picacho, the gold deposit is related to Mid-Tertiary age 
mineralization in a detachment fault setting, with mineralization hosted by brecciated 
upper-plate rocks and faults associated with a low-angle normal fault.  Red-coloured 
Tertiary conglomerate and volcanics formed the upper-plate host rocks and chloritic 
breccias and gneissic or crystalline rocks constitute the lower plate lithologies. 

Mineralization at Mesquite has been interpreted to be a "detachment" type with a 
possible genetic affiliation with a two-mica granite.  Gold mineralization occurs in quartz 
veins that are spatially associated with granitic dikes and lenses emplaced within a 
complex metamorphic host of high-grade gneissic rocks.  Mineralization at La Herradura 
occurs in mylonitic and sheared gneiss and schist along high-angle structures, similar to 
those described at Mesquite (la Garza, et al., 1998).

Gold mineralization appears to be similar at La Choya, Chanate and the Canasta Dorada 
property, where it is primarily controlled by shear zones and intersections with shallow-
dipping faults and mylonitic zones associated with regional deformation.  At La Choya, 
the mineralization occurs in potassic altered, biotite granite and sediments adjacent to a 
thrust fault (Summers and Hufford, 1998), in low-angle anastamosing and stacked shears 
and sub-conformable quartz-carbonate veins and lenses.  Ductile to semi-brittle 
deformation was observed along the principal thrust faults and the overall sulfide content 
to the ore zone is quite low (Thoms, 1998).  

The Chanate, gold deposit is currently under development and is located approximately 
15 km southeast of the Canasta Dorada project area.  Mineralization is controlled by a 
regional high-angle strike-slip fault of N65W strike (San Jose fault) and intersects with 
one or more gently dipping thrust zones.  Both structures are mineralized; however, 
nearby low-angle Mid-Tertiary detachment faults and related breccias are often not 
mineralized.  The principal low-angle structure that controls mineralization at Chanate is 
under alluivial cover and does not outcrop, but is identified from drill data.  Subsidiary or 
higher-level thrusts of varying sizes are seen at the surface, and confirm that sheared and 
semi-brecciated structures were important for ground preparation prior to gold deposition 
(Clarke, 2005).  

At Chanate it appears that the WNW-striking San Jose fault is the primary vertical 
conduit for mineralization and is characterized by abundant quartz veining parallel to its 
strike and in tensional quartz veins that strike to the northwest.  In addition, there are 
erratically distributed arrays of high-angle quartz veins and sulfide hydrofractures that 
strike ENE to EW within this zone.  The direction of these features and compressional 
character to mineralized structures suggests a late Mesozoic or Laramide age to 
mineralization.  The presence of light-coloured dikes intruding the San Jose fault zone, 
several km to the southeast, suggest a possible genetic relationship between these 
intrusives and mineralization.  The dikes are cut by gold-bearing quartz veins and appear 
to be auto-altered, resulting in a crumbly, sugary textured mass of granulated quartz.  
Where these dikes are relatively fresh, they are distinguishable as a feldspar porphyry 
with rare visible white quartz grains (Clarke, 2005).    

Many of the prospects and gold mines in the vicinity of the Canasta Dorada property are 
associated with low-angle faults and mylonitic zones, high-angle sheared fault zones and 
exhibit felsic dikes that appear to be genetically associated with mineralization.  The vein 
mineral assemblage and fluid inclusion data from some of these deposits suggest that 
they are mesothermal systems (Albinson, 1989; Zawada, 1998).  Deposits such as La 
Herradura, Mesquite, San Francisco and Chanate and the Property are characterized as 
"gold only deposits", and lack any strong trace element signatures as is commonly 
associated with base metal or epithermal systems (la Garza, et al., 1998).  The age of 
mineralization appears to be late Mesozoic or Laramide (Jacques and Clark, 1998). 

7.2 Local Geologic Setting 

The Canasta Dorada project is in an early stage of exploration, and the geology and 
understanding of mineralization is evolving.  The current understanding is based on very 



 

17 

poor outcrop exposures across much of the Property, which have a thin veneer of alluvial 
and pediment cover.  The majority of the following section describing the project geology 
and mineralization is based on the field work and notes of William Rehrig, Ph.D., during 
the 2006 field season for the Company.   

Detailed geological mapping and sampling by the Company has focused on the northern 
portion of the Basurera claim group, primarily in the vicinity of the Big Pit area, with 
reconnaissance work in the Placer area, and to the south and southwest in the Pique Viejo 
area.  Mineralization exposed in the Big Pit consists of a series of trenches that were 
excavated by the claimant during the 1980's to expose a flat-lying mineralized zone and 
provides a window into the complex geology that lies beneath the pediment cover.  These 
trenches provide the best vertical exposure of the sedimentary units and low-angle 
structures on the Property, which is hidden beneath Quaternary alluvial material. 

7.3 Rock Units 

The majority of the sedimentary rocks in the project area consist of "dirty" sandstones, 
arkosic sandstones and interbedded dark-grey-coloured shales and slates that are 
tentatively correlated with the Altar Formation which has been mapped nearby by Nourse 
(2001), although the distinctive conglomeratic member is absent from the exposed 
stratigraphic section on the Property.   The majority of the exposed stratigraphic section 
consists of thin-bedded, fissile, shale or slate of dark color with minor sandstone lenses.  
The rocks of the Altar Formation are in thrust contact with an overlying package of 
Jurassic siltstones and shales that appear relatively unaltered.  

Numerous intrusive rock units occur within the sedimentary section and are found 
conformable to bedding as sills and cross-cutting as dikes and small stocks.   

To the north and northwest of the Property, the Sierra Basura and Sierra la Gloria rise as 
fault-bound ranges, blocky debris and fanglomerate aprons cover the lower slopes, and 
are commonly cemented by caliche, these are shown in Figure 6 as Plesitocene 
Fanglomerate ("Pf").  The majority of the Property is covered by a thin veneer of alluvial 
material and pediment, even on the highest hills. 

Two intrusive rock units are observed in the Big Pit area, a hornblende monzonite or 
granodiorite with characterized by abundant thin needles of amphibole occurs as sills 
intruding the dark-coloured slates at the northern end of the trenches and is quite similar 
to larger bodies mapped toward the southern end of the claim block, this is shown as Unit 
Mi in Figure 8.  The other intrusive unit is a brown-weathered, crumbly, granodiorite 
characterized by abundant chloritized biotite and hornblende.  A third intrusive unit has 
been mapped that is tan-coloured fine-grained to porphyritic and occurs as dikes and sills. 
 
Near the southern boundary of the claims, reddish-brown to maroon-coloured sandstones 
and conglomerates contain clasts of limestone and are believed to be of Mid-Tertiary age 
and unconformably overlie the Jurassic rock units.  However, regional mapping by 
Nourse (2001) suggests that this may be a detachment fault contact.

7.4 Mineralization 

At Canasta Dorada, gold mineralization has been identified in four areas to date, 
including the Big Pit, Placer and Pique Viejo areas and within an area in the northeast 
corner of the newly located Canasta concession (Figure 10, and 11).  These are each 
described separately below. 

Big Pit area:  The Big Pit area consists of a series of N-S trenches that expose Jurassic 
sedimentary rocks that have been intensely sheared, folded, cleaved, intruded, altered and 
mineralized along a brittle-ductile thrust fault zone.  The mineralized zone is exposed for 
a thickness of 60 m and appears to be open at depth and characterized by intense 
deformation, anastamosing shears and slip surfaces that appear to strike roughly N-S and 
dips very shallowly to the west, almost conformable with the attitude of the overlying 
sediments.  These are overlying units that have been silicified, brecciated and are crosscut 
by quartz veins.  An unusual feature observed are thin and often discontinuous sills of a 
light tan argillic altered feldspar "porphyry" that is spatially associated with the better 
gold values.  These sills and thin dikes are generally concordant with bedding and along 
sub-horizontal shear zones, have minor iron oxides on fractures are remarkably similar to 
fault-controlled sills and dikes observed in the nearby Chanate gold deposit (Rehrig, 



 

19 

2006, field notes).  These sills appear to be syn-deformational within the fault zone and 
are intensely sheared and pulled into boudins within the deformed package of 
sedimentary rocks.  Kinematic data within the thrust zone indicate that the top is to the 
west-southwest. 

 

Figure 9: Altered felsic porphyry with stockwork quartz veining. 

Overlying the main structural zone of the thrust, the Jurassic sediments exposed in the 
Big Pit are pervasively altered and mineralized along bedding-parallel lenses and layers 
referred to as a "silica breccia".  The siltstones and shales are silicified and locally 
preserve the original layered texture with alternating dark and lighter bands ranging from 
tan to dark gray.  The rocks are locally bleached and iron-stained due to oxidation of fine 
disseminated sulfides.  Near the lowest levels of exposure and within the thrust zone, 
areas of dark-coloured, massive (not layered) silica-sulfide breccia have been observed 
that carry elevated gold values.  In general, the sulfide content observed at Canasta 
Dorada is very low (<1%). 

The section containing gold mineralization in the Big Pit area has an uninterrupted 
minimum thickness of approximately 60 vertical m, extends from the drainage on the 
west and is covered by a veneer of Pleistocene fanglomerate on the west.  Along the 
southern boundary of the Big Pit, the mineralized zone is abruptly truncated by a fault 
(Figure 8) that strikes N75W and dips 20-30 degrees to the south.  This is interpreted to 
be a low-angle normal or listric structure of Tertiary age and exposes extremely 
brecciated Jurassic sediments along the lower part of the upper plate.  Two very key 
relationships were observed in this structure: (1) the fault and upper-plate Jurassic rocks 
cover the major zone of gold mineralization; and (2) isolated structures and areas of gold 
mineralization and alteration in the feldspar "porphyry" are observed in the upper plate.  
This suggests that the mineralized zone extends beneath the upper plate of the normal 



 

20 

fault to the west and south and that leakage from underlying mineralization penetrates the 
upper plate.  
 
To the north, the limit of gold mineralization is poorly understood at this time.  A detailed 
study of the transition from the silica breccias and thrust fault exposed in the trenches to 
relatively unaltered slates, shales and intrusive sills to the north is obscure without any 
well-defined major truncating structure.  There appears to be an abrupt decrease in gold 
values at a point where there is an increase in the volume of intrusive sills injected into 
the sedimentary section.  These sills are generally porphyritic hornblende 
monzonite/granodiorite and granodiorite and are exposed along the north end of the 
trenches.  In addition, to the north unaltered thin-bedded, dark-coloured phyllitic shale-
slate-siltstones are intercalated with the intrusive rocks.  In the Big Pit area, the contact 
between mineralized and barren rocks is observed in only one trench and at this location, 
mineralized strata and layers overlie the barren phyllitic slates.  The controls on 
mineralization appear to be very complex, with possible lithologic and structural 
boundaries to mineralization.  It is possible that mineralization in the Big Pit area is 
related to a high-angle shear or structure, like that observed at Chanate, and the 
mineralization extends outward along the thrust fault for some distance in reactive or 
structurally prepared rock units.  The presence of the numerous granodiorite sills and 
dikes to the north of the Big Pit may have inflated the section and acted as a barrier to 
mineralization. 
 
A common feature observed throughout the Big Pit area are multiple slip surfaces with 
slickensides indicating post-mineral shear.  These slickensides and mullions consistently 
strike N60-70E and dip 10-20 degrees to the west and are slightly discordant to the east-
dipping sedimentary units.  Kinematic features indicate a low-angle normal displacement.     
 
Pique Viejo area: Pique Viejo area is located along the southern portion of the claim 
block, where NW-striking shear zones and veins have been mined by numerous prospect 
pits and shafts.  The most significant structures in this area are several WNW-striking 
faults (Figure 8).  Prospects and shafts along and adjacent to these structures exploit 
dilational quartz veins that strike northwest, west-northwest (paralleling the main fault), 
and to the north-northeast.  It appears that the main WNW-fault is exposed along a 
section of a draw, where orange-brown limonite stained, quartz veins and stringers occur 
across a zone several meters wide.  Another subparallel structure is exposed along a drill 
road cut a short distance to the east which contains quartz veining.  Adjacent to each of 
these exposures, are well-developed low-angle shear zones that also contain quartz and 
iron oxides.  Further to the south sills and dikes intrude Jurassic sediments and a NNE-
striking quartz veins have been mined to some depth (>20 m) by several vertical shafts.  
There are other veins and shear zones in this area that remain to be explored.  

To the northwest several hundred metres (Figure 8) another west-northwest-trending 
mineralized fault vein has been worked by early miners.  Several shafts and cuts expose a 
shear zone and quartz vein that is 1 to 3 m wide and is stained with iron oxides.  The 
latest slip appears to be high-angle oblique, and there is evidence of earlier, sub-
horizontal sense of shear with quartz veinlets and stringers splaying off in a northwest 
direction.  Another WNW-trending fault zone occurs to the east along a narrow ridge 



 

21 

where there is a prominent N-NW-striking quartz vein, 1 to 2 m wide, has been 
extensively mined by shafts and cuts.  The structure swings from north-south to N30W, 
and dips steep to the west.  Quartz and limited iron oxides occur in veins up to 10 to 15 
cm wide and in numerous adjacent stringers.  Dikes are common within this zone and cut 
a hornblende monzonite to granodiorite intrusive (Figure 8) that is altered and cut by 
subparallel sets of limonite-coated and minor quartz-filled joints and hydrofractures, 
many of which strike west-northwest to northwest within this zone.  One possibility is 
that the gold mineralization, may have a genetic association with this porphyritic 
granodiorite.   

Placer area: The Placer area is located to the east in an area that is currently being worked 
for placer gold (see Figure 6). In the area of dry placer workings, a major WNW-striking 
mineralized structure is present, largely covered by alluvium.  The fault zone cuts off and 
displaces a tabular granodiorite body that crops out just north of the placers.  A wide (50 
to 100 m) zone of alteration and brecciation host quartz veining and orange-brown iron 
oxide staining along the fault zone where they are exposed in the base of the placers.  
Many minor shears and fractures host limonite and quartz veinlets striking west-
northwest to northwest.  Brecciation and indications of shear are noted on many of these 
surfaces.  The mineralization occurs in both the Jurassic sedimentary rocks and in 
hornblende granodiorite that are cut by these structures.  This structural zone with its 
mineralization appears to be the source for the gold in the dry placer workings, and may 
extend beneath alluvium to the east of these workings.  To the W-NW, these structures 
becomes obscure, however, they project towards a point west of the Big Pit area (Figure 
6).  

Northeast Canasta area: The Company has conducted a preliminary investigation of the 
northeast portion of the Canasta concession, which is southeast of the Big Pit area. This 
effort was initiated to determine if the low-angle regional structures projected through 
this area. Initial results from this investigation have determined that there are very large 
(+50 m thick) low-angle structures in the area that locally contain up to 0.29 gpt Au from 
the initial sampling. In addition, this work has identified high-angle structures with 
significant gold mineralization.  This area returned gold values of up to 24.1 gpt from an 
old prospect pit on a quartz vein, 9.07 gpt form a 0.4m wide vein and 7.05 gpt from a 
0.8m wide vein.  This data greatly expands the potential for additional targets on the 
current property.

7.5 Structure 

The Property lies within the Mojave-Sonora megashear, which is a significant regional 
control observed at other bulk mineable gold deposits in northwestern Sonora. The 
primary controlling structures at Canasta Dorada are low angle thrust faults which are 
parallel to sub-parallel to bedding. Exposures in the area prevent a detailed understanding 
of the structural setting outside of the hillside cut area. Here the low angle structural 
fabric appears to control the mineralization with introduced silica and iron showing some 
association with the gold mineralization. This exposed area of gold mineralization is 
down dropped to the north by a high-angle east-west striking normal fault with 
movement of less than 60 to 70 m. To the south, the gold system and the thrust fault are 
displaced by what appears to be a low angle detachment structure striking east-west and 
dipping south at approximately 20 degrees.   



 

24 

Indications of mineralization in the shear zone consist of pods, lenses and sill-like masses 
of quartz, brecciated quartz and spatially associated but weak iron oxides after pyrite.  
The overall pyrite content appears fairly low (<1%).  Some sedimentary layers have been 
completely silificifed, in the lowest trenches exposures, and thin discontinuous sills and 
dikes of a light-colored, felsic intrusive have been argilically altered and appears to be 
associated with quartz veining, pyrite and higher gold values.  These altered dikes and 
sills are almost identical to those described in the nearby Chanate gold deposit (Clarke, 
2005).   

In the Big Pit area, all of the altered intrusive sills appear to be the low-angle sedimentary 
and shear fabrics.  Only in one small location were high-angle quartz-sulfide veinlets 
observed that strike N70E and are parallel to the slickensides.  At Canasta Dorada, it is 
likely that mineralization is syn-tectonic along a thrust fault zone of probable Laramide 
age, with a overprint of Mid-Tertiary extension or low-angle normal faulting along the 
thrust, as evidenced by many irregular, jagged curviplanar tension fractures oriented 
normal to the slickensides, and appears to be post-mineral.   

 

Figure 12: Sheared structures with felsic sill in the Big Pit area. 

In the Big Pit area, near the top of the hill on the east, there are outcrops and subcrop of a 
silica breccia unit similar to that observed in the bottom of the pit.  This silicified zone 
appears to be conformable with bedding, and displays multiple periods of silicification 
and quartz veining and varying amounts of iron oxide likely derived from pyrite.  
Samples collected from this unit have values ranging from 0.094 gpt to 2.75 gpt gold.  
Fourteen samples each collected over an area of 3 m by 3 m averaged 0.78 gpt gold from 
this unit. 

Currently there is no known drilling completed on the system so the lateral extent of the 
low-angle structure (and the gold system) has not been defined. There is no evidence that 



 

25 

the gold system and the thrust fault will be truncated by the structures to the north and 
south. It is assumed that while there is some lateral displacement the system will continue 
at a deeper level as displaced by these structures. 

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The primary exploration target at Canasta Dorada is a low-angle structurally controlled 
gold deposit. The style of mineralization is likely comparable to that currently being 
developed at the Chanate gold deposit, approximately 25 km to the east-southeast, where 
mineralization is controlled by a regional high-angle strike-slip fault of N65W strike (San 
Jose zone) and it intersects with one or more gently dipping thrust zones (Clarke, 2005). 
Similar structural settings are also seen at La Choya, 40 km to the northwest, where thrust 
faulting is a key structural control and dictates the position of the ore body (Thoms, 
1998). 

9.0 MINERALIZATION 

The Company has collected 283 rock chip samples in an effort to characterize the 
mineralization and develop targets at Canasta Dorada, which were initially focused on the 
Big Pit area. The combination of geochemical sampling and geologic mapping have 
identified an area containing potentially ore-grade gold mineralization  with values 
ranging up to 8.95 gpt gold. There are 63 samples collected with values greater than 1 
ppm gold, and the average of all 283 samples taken is 0.94 ppm and includes 185 samples 
with values greater then 0.10 ppm gold.  The geochemical results from Canasta Dorada 
are of a similar order of magnitude to those initially found at Chanate, La Choya and La 
Herradura deposits during early exploration at those properties. 

The geochemical sampling has focused on the exposed mineralization in the Big Pit area 
(Figure 10 and 11) and generally consists of chip and channel samples over lengths of 1 
to 5 m, as determined by the geologist. In addition, samples have been collected in areas 
of outcrop, where individual samples were collected from a panel of 3 m by 3 m area. 
Results to date have shown that the mineralization is generally gold only with no distinct 
pathfinder or associated elements observed. A summary of the sampling includes the 
following results:

In the Big Pit area, significant gold mineralization has been defined by sampling in an 
area measuring approximately 200 by 375 m. The average gold grade of the 143 samples 
collected from this area is 1.20 gpt gold. The mineralized zone is exposed over a vertical 
thickness of approximately 50 m within the 200 by 375 m area.  

A sample taken by the Author (506425 in Table D below), in the Big Pit area included a 
sample from an altered felsic dike across a 3 m horizontal distance that that assayed 8.96 
gpt gold, this compares to some of the high-grades that were found during the initial 
discovery at La Choya and Chanate, and demonstrates that within the Big Pit area there is 
potential for higher-grade gold mineralization.

* The 34.8 m is made up of 11 vertical chip samples, with lengths ranging from 1.2 to 2.4 m (average length 
was 2.1 m) that were collected along a 34.8 meter-long bench in the old-mine cut.

Mineralization is thought to extend beyond the exposures in the Big Pit trenches and may 
extend both laterally beneath the fault to the south and vertically. Initial mapping 
suggests that the mineralized zone is open in all directions under alluvial gravels or 
within down dropped structural blocks. 

The results of the geochemical sampling conducted to date at Canasta Dorada has 
outlined a large area of potentially ore grade mineralization. Sampling has concentrated 
on collecting chip samples over lengths ranging from 1 to 5 m from the old-mine cut, 
which was the site of limited mining activity in 1980. A second area of mineralization has 
been identified 850 m south-southeast of the Big Pit area in the Placer area, which shows 
evidence of dry-wash placer mining where rock chip samples have returned values as 
high as 0.58 gpt Au. 

10.0 EXPLORATION 

Exploration work on the Property has consisted of geologic mapping, rock chip and silt 
geochemical sampling, and some limited Self Potential ("SP") geophysical surveys. This 
work was completed between September 2006 and the date of this report by Randall L. 
Moore, the Company's Vice President of Exploration WA. RPG # 1390, Dr. Jacob J. 
Skokan, the Company's Chief Geophysicist , and Dr. William Rehrig, the Company's 
Manager of Mexico Exploration.  The objective of this exploration program was to define 
controls for the mineralization and to evaluate the extent of the gold zones at the 
Property, and to develop targets for future exploration efforts. The exploration work was 
planned and executed to conform to industry standards and methods.  

Geologic mapping, geochemical sampling and geophysical surveying have identified the 
Big Pit area as the primary focus of exploration by the Company.  Structures exposed in 
the trenches show mineralization along low angle and structurally sheared rocks similar 
to that currently being developed at Chanate, which has a resource approaching a million 
oz located 25 km southeast of Canasta Dorada. Rock chip sampling has identified an area 
of exposed gold mineralization covering an area roughly 200 m by 375 m in size. Within 
this exposure the Company has collected a total of 143 samples in the form of continuous 
chips of lengths varying from one to five m and as area samples covering three by three 
m. The average of all samples collected from the exposed zone average 1.20 gpt with a 
high of 8.95 gpt over 4.6 m. 

In addition, two other areas have been identified on the Property that have potential to 
host gold mineralization these are the Placer and the Pique Viejo areas, as described 
above.   

Sample results should be considered reliable and representative of the mineralization 
exposed on surface. To obtain an accurate determination of potential lateral and depth 
extensions of mineralization, trenching and drilling will be required.  

All geological samples were analyzed at ALS Chemex, Sparks, Nevada, USA.  The 
subsequent results were then imported into a geographical information system ("GIS") 
program for evaluation and analysis.

10.1 Geophysical Surveys 

The Company has conducted 35 km of SP surveys over a portion of the Property, and this 
data is currently being analysed and interpreted. 

10.2 Geochemical Sampling 

Geochemical sampling completed at the Property consists of the collection of a total of 
283 rock chip samples that were primarily collected in trench exposures in the Big Pit 
area and 160 silt samples over areas on the Basurero and Canasta concessions.  
Additional sampling was conducted in the Pique Viejo and Placer areas.  Results of the 
geochemical sampling are attached in Appendix 1. 

The objective of the sampling was to establish the presence of gold mineralization in a 
geologic context that could support a significant ore deposit.  This first pass of sampling 
is typical in early stage exploration projects and was designed to develop targets that 
would warrant further examination.  While selected samples were taken to determine if 
high grade gold mineralization was present, all such samples were noted and described as 
select samples.  The sampling conducted by the Company shows that significant gold 
mineralization is present in the Big Pit area, and it is similar to that described from early 
stages of discovery at the nearby deposits at La Choya (Thoms, 1998) and Chanate 
(Clarke, 2005), including select high-grade samples of up to 8.96 gpt gold.  

10.3 Targets 

The primary target identified at Canasta Dorada is in the Big Pit area, where trenches 
have exposed a low angle structural zone that hosts significant gold mineralization, at ore 
grade levels, averaging nearly 1.2 gpt gold over an area 200 m by 375 m.  Beyond the 
Big Pit area, mineralization is covered by alluvium and to the south is thought to be in 
fault contact with overlying barren rocks.  The preliminary sampling and geologic 
mapping suggest that a system comparable to that being developed at Chanate or the 
deposit at La Choya may be present at Canasta Dorada.  The lateral extent and continuity 
of mineralization in the Big Pit area are unknown; however, trenching and drilling will be 
required to make these determinations. The Company has developed plans for a trenching 
and initial drill program that would test the thickness, extent and grade of this system, as 
well as explore some of the stockwork targets in the Placer area.  Initially a 13,000 m 
drill program is recommended with a follow-up program should results be encouraging.  
Continued geologic mapping and sampling will be an important part of developing an 
understanding of the complex geology and structures at Canasta Dorada.  

11.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

Geochemical sampling completed at the Property consists of the collection of a total of 
283 rock samples and 160 silt samples. Results of this work are shown in Appendix 1.  
Rock chip samples were collected as continuous chip, grab and select samples. 



 

30 

The continuous chip samples were designed to define mineral distribution and 
approximate overall grades within areas of known mineralization. They were collected 
perpendicular to the structure where possible and were cut across the full width of 
observable mineralization. Within the trench exposures, samples were cut vertically to 
cross the stratigraphy, as shown in Figure 13.  Sample density within the trench was not 
at systematic intervals, but generally conformed to a spacing of 10 m or less.  Grab 
samples were collected to help define background geochemical levels within the various 
rock units and to evaluate metallic ion distribution and chemical zonation across the 
Property.  Select samples were collected to determine if there were any specific 
geochemical signatures and to characterize the ability of the system to generate high-
grade ore.  This type of first pass sampling is typical in early stage exploration projects. 
This sampling provides a good overall representation of the mineralization and is 
designed to develop targets for follow-up investigation. Sample distribution and the areas 
covered in the program to date are show in Figure 11.  The quality of the sampling 
appears to be good, with results from different rounds of sampling showing a good 
consistency of results within similar geologic settings. While selected samples were taken 
to determine if there were high grade gold mineralization, all such samples were noted 
and described as "select" in the database in order to avoid any confusion or sample 
biases. In addition, the Company had several samples re-assayed using a bottle roll test to 
determine if there was any potential for "nugget" effect from a coarse gold factor in the 
sampling, particularly since there are dry placers immediately above mineralized bedrock 
in the Placer area, suggesting that any local sources for the placers contain coarse gold. 

Geochemically gold appears to be the only element significantly enriched within the 
Canasta Dorada mineralized system. There is a slight elevation in silver values which 
show some correlation with gold, but not to any economic levels. Using the gold results 
from all of the samples collected from the Property, 67% are greater then 0.10 gpt, 39% 
are greater then 0.50 gpt and 25% are greater then 1.00 gpt. Silver values range from 
below detection levels of 0.2 gpt to a high of 219 gpt. 

The results from the geochemical sampling program conducted by the Company is 
presented in Appendix 1. 

12.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

Assays were performed by fire assay on a 50 g sample by ALS Chemex in Vancouver, 
B.C.   The ALS Chemex laboratories in North America are all registered to ISO 
9001:2000 for the "provision of assay and geochemical analytical services" by QMI 
Quality Registrars.  In addition to this ISO registration, ALS Chemex's Vancouver 
laboratory has received ISO 17025 accreditation from the Standards Council of Canada.  

All samples were collected by, or under the direct supervision of, a Qualified Person 
("QP").  The Qualified Person on the project is Randall L. Moore, the Company Vice-
President – Exploration, North America. Emphasis was placed on quality control and the 
proper handling and numbering of all samples. No sample preparation was conducted 
prior to the material being shipped to the laboratory and no sample preparation was 
conducted by an employee, officer, director or associate of the Company. The samples 



 

31 

were transported by trusted Company personnel and shipped to ALS Chemex in Sparks, 
Nevada via standard freight transporters or delivered to ALS Chemex in Hermosillo, 
Sonora by trusted Company personnel.  No persons outside of trusted Company 
personnel had access to any of the samples from the time of collection to delivery to the 
freight office or the lab facility.  Under controlled laboratory conditions, the samples 
were crushed, split, ground and analyzed for the desired elements by standard Inductively 
Coupled Plasma ("ICP") methods. All samples with geochemical content greater then the 
detection limits for ICP methodology were re-analyzed using standard assay methods. 
Initial analytical results were checked by re-analysis of 3% of the total samples by ALS 
Chemex.  These facilities are an ISO 9001:2000 certified laboratory which insert a total 
of 8% blank and standard samples into each analyzed sample batch to ensure precision 
and accuracy. When analytical results were received, they were checked against their 
geological context and, subsequently, the field locations and sample descriptions were 
cross-referenced with the results and sample numbers to ensure accuracy.   

As part of the target development on the Property and to gain a better understanding of 
the mineralization, continued surface rock chip sampling will be required. This should be 
followed by surface trenching and drill testing to test lateral and vertical continuity of the 
mineralization.  In my opinion, all sample handling, preparation, security and analytical 
procedures conform to industry standards.   

13.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

All data have been reviewed and verified by the Author. Analytical precision and 
accuracy was checked by analyzing standard and blank samples, and by re-analyses of 
certain samples.  When analytical results were received, they were checked against their 
geological context and, subsequently, the field locations and sample descriptions were 
cross-referenced with the results and sample numbers to ensure accuracy. This 
combination of various analytical checks and field verification ensures proper data 
integrity.   

13.1 Check Sampling 

Several of the initial chip samples at Canasta Dorada were resampled by the Company to 
determine the repeatability of the geochemistry and determine if there were any potential 
issues with a coarse gold factor. All samples were collected as continuous chips over 
lengths from 1 to 4 m from the trench exposures in the Big Pit area.  The following table 
summarizes the results and, while the initial results are confirmed, there is some 
significant variation within some of the duplicate samples. Overall the results are similar 
with the average of the 14 samples being 1.92 gpt in the original samples and 1.76 gpt in 
the re-samples.

In general, it appears that the highest-grade samples have the greatest variability for both 
the re-sampling and the fire assay versus bottle roll analysis. This suggests that there may 
be a coarse gold component within these samples. Additional testing and checks are 
recommended.  

Of the 185 rock chip samples collected, eight were collected by the Author as check 
samples in the preparation of this report, the geochemical analysis of these samples are 
shown below in Table D.

The results of the sampling by the Author confirmed the presence of mineralization and 
in the relative value ranges that have been reported by the Company.  Although there are 
some variations in the geochemical data for the check samples, this is considered by the 
Author as being within an acceptable range considering that the samples taken were not 
completely identical to the Company's samples. 

14.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

No mineral properties are immediately adjacent to the Canasta Dorada property. 

15.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Gold prospects are scattered across northwest Sonora and were historically prospected for 
high-grade ores on a small scale from as early as the 1700's to present day (Martinez, 
1998).  In the last two decades, following modifications in the Mexican "Reglamentary 
Law of Article 27", modern exploration has focused mainly on bulk tonnage targets, and 
have produced a number of significant discoveries of economic importance (Clark, 
1998).  A few have already been mined out (Summers and Hufford, 1998), one is in 
development stage (Clarke, 2006) and another has been increasingly productive for 
several years (la Garza, Noguez, et al., 1998).  Examples of the gold deposits along this 
trend include Mesquite and Picacho in the Yuma area of extreme southwestern Arizona, 
and La Choya, La Herradura and Chanate in the Caborca region of northwest Sonora, 
Mexico (Figure 1).  Mesquite and Picacho were the first modern mines in the Northern 
Sonoran Gold Belt to open and produce gold during the 1980's.  They were soon 
followed by Hecla's La Choya deposit in the 1994.  Soon thereafter, a Newmont-Penoles 
joint venture announced the discovery of La Herradura in a remote, sand-covered desert 
near the Gulf of California.  Penoles became the mine operator and, from what was 
initially considered to be of a minimal size, low-grade deposit, La Herradura has grown 
into a multi-million ounce operation with ever increasing "total" gold reserves (currently 
reported at 6,000,000 oz gold).  Chanate, located a few km east of Caborca, is currently 
in mine development by Capital Gold Corporation, has many similarities to the Canasta 
Dorada project and has a resource approaching a million ounces (Clarke, 2006) with 
indicated potential for an additional 500,000 ounces of possible production at current 



 

35 

elevated gold prices. Therefore, the Company's Canasta Dorada property lies within a 
known auriferous region where significant new discoveries are still being found.  
Preliminary geological and geochemical data at Canasta Dorada suggest there is potential 
for gold mineralization similar to that currently being developed at nearby Chanate. 

The exposed mineralization at Canasta Dorada has been sampled over an area of 200 m 
by 375 m with 185 continuous chip samples measuring 1 to 5 m in length. This number 
of samples giving an average grade of 1.20 gpt represents a very significant gold 
occurrence. The extensions of mineralization are interpreted to extend beneath a normal 
contact on the south and below alluvial cover to the east and west of exposures in the Big 
Pit area.  The mineralization at Canasta Dorada is comparable to those found at nearby 
gold mines within the Sonora gold belt, including the following:  

La Herradura   1.11 gpt 

La Colorado   1.27 gpt 

La Choya   0.99 gpt 

San Francisco   1.05 gpt 

Chanate  0.812 gpt 

Canasta Dorada  1.2 gpt (based on average of 143 samples in the Big Pit area) 

The geological investigation at the Canasta Dorada property is in an early stage, and the 
initial geological and geochemical results generated by the Company support the concept 
that Canasta Dorada may represent a significant new gold discovery.   

Review of the data collected suggests that additional detailed geologic mapping and 
geochemical sampling would be required to complete a comprehensive review of the 
entire land position.  Several high-priority anomalies have been identified by the 
exploration completed to date, which met the Company's initial objectives for the 
Property.  There are additional areas on the Property which have seen little or no 
geochemical sampling or geologic mapping, and they will require additional exploration 
work to determine if any mineral potential exists in these areas, particularly in the Placer, 
Pique Viejo, and northeast Canasta areas. Data generated by the initial exploration has 
been adequate in helping to develop several high-priority anomalies and target areas, and 
a review of this data shows that it is reliable and accurate.  Additional work will also be 
required to develop other anomalous areas or targets on the Property.  This work will 
ultimately require extensive drilling and feasibility analysis to accurately answer the size 
and grade uncertainties which exist at this early stage of exploration.  

The purpose of this review was to provide the Company and its investors with a summary 
of the Property and the technical merits of the project and to present the appropriate 
manner of conducting continuing exploration. That objective has been met within this 
document, as all information related to the initial exploration phase has been reviewed 
and analyzed. 



 

36 

16.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Additional surface work is recommended for the Canasta Dorada property, which would 
focus on collecting additional detailed geologic information from mapping, additional 
geochemical sampling, trenching where feasible, followed by a Phase I drill program. 
This work has the potential to identify additional high-priority targets within the Property 
and land position which would require a follow-up drill program.  It is estimated that this 
continuing exploration of the Canasta Dorada property will require an expenditure of 
US$3,000,000.  A phase one drill program, which would include initial drill testing of the 
gold target identified by the work to date, would consist of 13,000 m of core. This first 
drill program would be followed by a second phase once results are received and 
analyzed. The second phase would be contingent on the results from the phase one 
program and would be designed to test additional target areas and as infilling in areas of 
confirmed mineralization based on the initial program. 

The following is a summary of costs related to the two proposed programs, which include 
the initial metallurgical testing and the drilling of 13,000 m of core at Canasta Dorada: 

Budget US$(000) 
  

Geological activities/Management 850 
Geochemistry/assaying/geophysics 425 
Drilling activities 2,000 
Land costs 425 
Trenching/road building 80 
Metallurgy 180 
Office support 120 
Contingency/other costs 250 
Scoping/Environmental 70 
  
Total 4,400
