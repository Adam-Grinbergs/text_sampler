3.  SUMMARY 
 
The Sagar Property (the "Property") in the Territory of Nunavik, Québec is under option 
to Yukon Resources Corp. (YUKR.OB - OTC BB, and YE5 – FWB; "Yukon") through 
an agreement made with Virginia Mines Inc. (TSX-VGQ; "Virginia," formerly known as 
Virginia Gold Mines Inc.), to quote: "Under the terms of the agreement, Yukon has the option 
to earn a 75% interest in the property by issuing to Virginia 2,000,000 shares and 2,000,000 
purchase warrants of Yukon, exercisable at US$1.00 for a 3-year period, and by incurring total 
exploration expenditures of $2,000,000 on the property by August 2008. […] Virginia has the 
option at anytime to sell its remaining 25% participating interest into the Sagar property in 
consideration of 1,000,000 shares and 1,000,000 purchase warrants of Yukon." The property has 
no known mineral reserves of any kind and is exploratory in nature. 
 
The Property occurs in the Romanet Horst, a NW cross-cutting fault-bounded structural 
feature astride the Early Proterozoic Labrador Trough – a supracrustal thrust-fold belt at 
the eastern margin of the Archean Superior Province of the Canadian Shield.  Several 
kinds of mineralization have been found in the Romanet Horst characterized by an 
impressive number of mineral showings. The Horst is an unusual structure and the 
presence of abundant mineral showings within it may suggest a genetic link to its 
formation. Such a scenario would explain the presence of both lithophile and chalcophile 
mineralization created during active deformation of the Trough, along with crustal 
dewatering of the supracrustal pile, and the probability of magmatic-hydrothermal foci in 
the crustal blocks comprising the horst and adjacent graben. 
 
Targets of highest interest include U, U-Au, Cu-Au, and Cu mineralization types. In 
1962, Delhi-Pacific found extensive Cu mineralization in shears, and low grade Cu-in-
dolomite-argillite stratabound discoveries were made to the SE. A particularly interesting 
discovery occurs as mineralized boulders in a ~500 x 200 m area (the Miskamisk a.k.a. 
Clandestine boulder field), with 31 boulder samples averaging 50.7 g/t Au and 0.3% U 
(Lulin, 2002). The boulder source represents a high-priority exploration target.  
 
Several genetic models for known mineralization are proposed, including leakage from a 
sandstone-uranium model (Setterfield, 2006), a reaction bed replacement model (a 
stratabound Cu model), an albitization Cu-Au-U model, and an iron oxide Cu-Au (±U, 
"IOCG") model (Corriveau, 2005). At the Viking Showing, U-Au mineralization has 
aspects suggesting a reaction bed-replacement model. Albitites associated with gold and 
copper mineralization are typical of other Proterozoic mesothermal-gold discoveries (e.g., 
in the Southern Province of Ontario). An association of copper in shears at the Delhi-
Pacific Showing, and U-Au veins at the Kish and Eagle Showings suggest significant 
structural control on much of the Property's mineralization. 
 
An exploration program for the summer of 2006 and specific methodologies are proposed 
based on a complete reevaluation of data sets collected during previous exploration 
campaigns, and information from a GIS stack created by GeoVector Management of 
Nepean, Ontario. The cost of this program is estimated to be $700,000, and a budget 
(Phase 1) has been prepared. A further contingency budget of $250,000 (Phase 2) has 
been added for 2006, if the initial exploration program proves positive.

4.  INTRODUCTION  
 
This report is designed to comply with the guidelines seen in National Instrument 43-101, 
and was prepared following the updated "Item" list in Form 43-101F1 (updated list and 
guidelines to be used as of December 30, 2005; Anonymous 2005).  
 
We were retained by Yukon Resources Corp. to assess available technical data as well as 
review and design work proposals for the Sagar Property, in the light of our specialized 
geological experience in Proterozoic ore types as it applies to the particular exploration 
techniques suited to the local mineralized environment. Information for the creation of 
this report was derived from a number of sources, including published literature, 
geological maps and open-file reports, geophysical plans, site visits, drill core, diamond 
drill logs and assay certificates. The most recent property visit was on July 03, 2006 by 
Craig S. Scherba to examine outcrops of mineralization, and determine parameters for 
this summer's exploration campaign (Figure 1). The property has no mineral reserves of 
any kind and is an exploration property. 
 
5.  RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
5.1 Expert Information 
 
Most of the Sagar Property data being used in this report was collected by provincial and 
federal government employees; public companies, their representatives and technical 
(geological and geophysical) contractors (for details, see Item 23, "References"), as well 
as professional experts known to us. A GIS stack was prepared by consultants at 
GeoVector Management Inc., 10 Green Street, Suite 312, Nepean, Ontario, Canada, 
K2J3Z6: Telephone (613) 843-8109. 
 
For technical data on the property's various diamond drilling campaigns as well as other 
past exploration work of various kinds, and the assay techniques used by laboratories, 
secure steps were taken where possible to confirm the data sources. Most of the 
geological, geophysical and drilling reports were written by professional geologists and 
geophysicists, and we have no reason to doubt their veracity. By reviewing drill log data 
and assay certificates issued during the various exploration campaigns, there appears to 
be a clear internal consistency to the results – that is to say, there are no compelling 
reasons to single out any particular exploration campaign as having unusual results 
outside the range of previous or subsequent surveys. Assays seen are not outside the 
range of normal variation seen for mineralization of these kinds. Boulders in the 
Mistamisk radioactive boulder field were checked with a scintillometer and gave readings 
up to 900 counts per second. 
 
Regions like the Romanet Horst that have an extensive but sporadic exploration history 
often contain older information as summaries without the original data sets and, by 
definition, this material has an uncertain compliance with modern CIM and NI43-101 
industry guidelines and practice. Nonetheless, most of this material is contextually 
valuable in mineral exploration since it often has a reliable provenance.

6.  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION  
 
6.1 Description and Location 
 
The Property comprises blocks of claims in the Territory of Nunavik, Province of 
Québec, Canada.  The approximate center of exploration activity is circa 56°22' N 
latitude and circa 68° 00' W longitude (Figure 2). Details on the individual claims are 
given in Table 1 below, based on information available on-line at the Government of 
Québec's Ministère des ressources naturelles, de la faune et des parcs GESTIM website 
(https://gestim.mines.gouv.qc.ca/MRN_GestimP_Presentation/ODM02201_menu_base.aspx; the 
Property claim data were acquired on June 10, 2006, and have not changed).

The area of these claims is ~6,580 hectares.  Due dates are shown on Table 1 above, and 
Yukon's tenure arrangement is described in the section below. In this part of the Province 
of Québec, claim outlines are predetermined by "map staking." Former staked claims are 
superimposed upon by the map-staking grid, giving some of the small parcels shown in 
the table above. There are no carried environmental liabilities on the Property. All surface 
work requires Provincial government permits including camp construction permits. A 
former base campsite (Figure 1) is to be revived.  

6.2 Terms of Option Agreement on the Sagar Property  

Yukon Resources Corp. has entered into a joint venture agreement on the Sagar Property 
with Virginia Mines Inc. (TSX-VGQ, formerly Virginia Gold Mines Inc., or Mines d'Or 
Virginia Inc.) From a Virginia Mines Inc. News Release dated May 2, 2006, quote: 

"Virginia Mines Inc. ("Virginia") and Yukon Resources Corporation ("Yukon") are pleased to 
announce the signing of a binding agreement whereas Yukon has the option to acquire an 
undivided 75% participating interest in 200 claims constituting the Sagar property, located in the 
Labrador Trough in Northern Quebec."  "Under the terms of the agreement, Yukon has the option 
to earn a 75% interest in the property by issuing to Virginia 2,000,000 shares and 2,000,000 
purchase warrants of Yukon, exercisable at US$1.00 for a 3-year period, and by incurring total 
exploration expenditures of $2,000,000 on the property by August 2008. Furthermore Virginia has 
the option at anytime to sell its remaining 25% participating interest into the Sagar property in 
consideration of 1,000,000 shares and 1,000,000 purchase warrants of Yukon. The share 
purchase warrants shall be exercisable at a price equal to the 20-trading day weighted average 
closing price preceding the selling date and shall be valid for a 2-year period from the date of 
issuance." "Once Yukon will have earned a 100% interest in the property, Virginia shall retain a 
1.5% royalty (NSR). Virginia also keeps a 51% back-in right in any gold discovery with a 43-101 
indicated resource of no less than 500,000 ounces by issuing a cash payment or a share 
certificate equivalent to an amount equal to 2.5 times the expenditures incurred by Yukon at such 
date. Virginia would then become the operator." "The Sagar property is the host to a very unusual 
boulder field which contains 150 boulders that have an average grade of 0.3% U and 50.7 g/t Au. 
Several other uranium-gold showings have been defined on the property, the most significant 
being the Viking (grab samples as high as 223 g/t Au and 0.1% U) and the Eagle (grab sample as 
high as 5.4 g/t Au and 1% U) showings. That information is confirmed by Paul Archer, Geological 
Engineer and qualified person (as defined by National Instrument 43-101). M. Archer has more 
than 25 years of experience in exploration."

7.  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES AND 
 PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
7.1 Accessibility 
 
The Sagar Property lies ~200 km south of Kuujjuaq, Territory of Nunavik, Québec, and 
180 km NW of  Schefferville (Sketch 1, Figure 3).1 Defined as being north of the 55th 
parallel, Nunavik comprises the northern third of the Province of Québec covering an 
area of approximately 507,000 square km. The 11,000 inhabitants of the region (~90% 
Inuit) live in 14 villages along the coastline. The Cree village of Whapmagoostui occurs 
to the west. The Property is accessible by float plane or helicopter during the short 
summer, but only by helicopter during break-up and freeze-up. During the winter, access 
can be made by prepared ski-plane airstrips on ice-covered lakes.

7.2 Climate  
 
The Sagar Property lies within the Subarctic to near-Arctic transition zone near the 
boundary of the Canadian "Middle North – Far North" (using Hamelin's "Nordicity" 
classification, 1979). Weather conditions across Nunavik are controlled by large-scale 

                                                 
1 In the local dialect of Inuktitut, Nunavik means "place to live".  The Inuit here call themselves 
Nunavimmiut. Until 1912, the region was part of the Northwest Territories (District of Ungava).

prevailing and synoptic winds crossing Hudson Bay to the west, Ungava Bay to the north 
and the Labrador Sea to the east. Sea ice usually develops on Ungava Bay in late October 
to early November and the sea may remain covered in pack ice until late July. Hudson 
Bay usually starts to freeze in late December.  
 
Even during the present warming trend of mildly variable Holocene climate, true winter 
conditions here are long and cold, really extending from October to June. Locally, break-
up in the main rivers occurs in mid June, and freeze-up usually starts in September. The 
frost-free season is very brief, and is occasioned by clouds of very vigorous biting 
insects. First snow usually falls near the end of August. Strong "southerly" winds (20-30 
knots) prevail during the frost-free season bringing in warm air masses. Lee wave 
turbulence and lenticular clouds can be observed in the atmosphere during this time. NW 
winds bring cold weather, and north and NE winds bring cold stormy weather off the 
Labrador Sea (winds in excess of 30 knots).2 Winter whiteout conditions can develop 
without warning and may last for several days.  A low ceiling of stratus clouds makes 
whiteout conditions general, and movement across the ground then becomes difficult. 
 
7.3 Local Resources  
 
The limited land resources initially supported a transient hunting and gathering economy 
mostly near the coastline. This was followed by the Hudson Bay Company's commercial 
exploitation of the fur trade – Fort Mackenzie to the north (Sketch 1 above) was an 
interior Hudson Bay post. More recent provincial furbearer management strategies were 
created for desired economic sustainability, but have had a mixed success for isolated 
northern economies due to competition from artificial-fur alternatives as well as popular 
external "eco" causes quite unrelated to the realities of the region.  

There are no true timber resources on the Sagar Property. Hill tops comprise barren 
Tundra with lichens, mosses, sedges, perennial forbs, and dwarfed shrubs. Tundra 
vegetation is typically ground-hugging warmth-preserving forms including tussocky 
graminoids, mats or cushion plants, evergreen members of the heath family, and rosettes. 
Some dwarf shrubs are deciduous in habit. Trees occupy valleys and bowls. Spruce 
(Picea glauca) and tamarack (Larix laricana) are the most common trees, while poplar 

                                                 
2 Temperature and precipitation are the dominant elements of the Subarctic environment, 
affecting mechanical weathering, hydrology, soil development, and human activity. The warmest 
and coldest days are characterized by mean temperatures of >25°C and <-30°C. Mean annual 
precipitation in the Subarctic is <0.45 m, which would normally classify the area as semi-arid, but 
the effects of low evaporation result in an abundance of surface water. Major deviations from this 
general climatic regime are the result of maritime influences. The frost-free period is short, 
typically 40 to 60 days. Most precipitation falls in the form of snow. Much of the area has snow 
cover for over 200 days. Snow cover duration is a function not only of mean temperature but of 
snow depth, which typically reaches between 0.50 to 0.75 m within discrete regional sub-zones 
such as open Taiga woods, Tundra hills, and lakes. The wind redistributes the snow. In 
combination with its density, hardness, and other attributes, snow surface conditions vary (e.g., 
there are light deep snows in patches of protected forest; dense wind-blown sastrugi covering 
lakes; deep, dense drifted snow in open woodland patches; granular shallow snow at the ground 
surface; and the soft water-saturated snows of "late Spring."  



 13

(Populus tremuloides and P. balsamifera) and birch (Betula papyrifera) occupy some 
sheltered spots. Alder (Alnus sp.) and willow thickets (Salix sp.) are common. 

Most hunting and fishing is for local consumption, and restricted mainly to navigable 
rivers. The local fauna of note comprises caribou, bears, hares, wolves and waterfowl of 
various types, the latter especially in the short "summer" season.  
 
7.4 Infrastructure and Physiography 
 
No settlements are found within the vicinity. Exploration and mining experts have to be 
contracted from outside the region. Mineral exploration campaigns, an important 
potential source for local income, have been quite sporadic due to the nature of the 
business and the high-cost high-risk nature of exploring remote regions.  All field camps 
have to be self-contained and all supplies have to be flown in by float or ski-plane. 
Communication is facilitated by satellite telephone. Lakes provide drinking water and 
float-plane access. Summer drainage may cause lake surfaces to drop from 0.5 to 1 m. 
 
The Property occurs in the Romanet Horst which, because of differential weathering, 
forms the Mistamisk Valley (Figure 4). Valley bottom elevation varies from 275 m (NW) 
and up to 360 m (SE).  A "ribbed" plateau to the north has elevations around 440-480 m, 
and a similar "ribbed" plateau to the south has elevations around 440-560 m with tops 
~680 m. Topographic ribbing on the plateaux is caused by volcanic and sedimentary 
stratigraphy as broad folds clearly visible on drainage maps and satellite images. The 
Romanet River (Rivière Romanet) occupies the valley and drains NW into the 
Caniapiscau River (Rivière Caniapiscau) which then turns NW to join the Larch River 
(Rivière aux Mélèzes), both rivers becoming the Koksoak River draining past Kuujjuaq 
into Ungava Bay (Sketch 1 above). The landscape was carved by Pleistocene icesheets.

8.  HISTORY 
 
8.1 Regional History 
 
The interior of the Ungava Plateau contained one of the last remnants of the Laurentide 
Icesheet, possibly with remains as late as 6,500 14C years before present – an icecap that 
persisted for several thousand years after settled agriculture was developed in west Asia.3 
Transient Neolithic hunter-gatherer populations arrived late in Recent history, moving 
along coast lines and up some navigable rivers using canoes. The climate of the interior 
of Ungava is really too severe for permanent villages. Mining and hydroelectric resources 
are the only real means for creating any kind of local and modern economy. 
 
In the 1870s, Jesuit missionary Louis Babel found iron deposits in western Labrador 
(south of the Sagar Property). Eminent Canadian geologist Albert Peter Low mapped 
parts of the Labrador Trough between 1892 and 1896. Indeed, Low's expeditions covered 
more than 12,000 km of Labrador (not then part of Canada) and Ungava (then part of the 
Northwest Territories) before the 20th Century began.  
 
In 1936 a major body of banded iron formation ("BIF") was mapped at Carol Lake and 
Little Wabush Lake. Through the 1930s and 1940s, further iron deposits were discovered 
by Joseph Retty in the southern part of the Trough leading to the creation of the Iron Ore 
Company of Canada which completed the Québec North Shore and Labrador Railway to 
ship iron ore from Schefferville, Quebec to Sept Îles on the north shore of the St. 
Lawrence River. The main line is 573 km long, and a 58 km spur line was built from 
Ross Bay Junction to Labrador City. The railway was inaugurated in 1954, after 3 years 
of construction that required one of the largest civilian airlifts in history. The spur line to 
Labrador City was opened in 1960.  
 
8.2 Property History 
 
No mine production has occurred on the Property, or anywhere within 150 km. There are, 
therefore, no carried mining environmental liabilities. Previous assessment work reports 
are confined mostly to the Romanet Horst and its immediate margins (Figure 5, map 
derived after Govt. of Québec, GESTIM website; also, assessment work reports filed in 
Québec City; reports from Virginia; see also Item 23,  "References").  
 
Regional geological mapping and descriptions of units in the Labrador Trough have been 
conducted from the 1960's to the 1980s (e.g., Baragar, 1960; Dimroth, 1964, 1969a, 
1969b, 1970, 1978; Dressler, 1979); and geochemical investigations, including 
radioactivity, were conducted in the early 1980s (Kish et al. 1978, 1979; Kish and Cuney, 
1981).  Other reports on uranium showings were made about the same time (e.g., Masse, 
1974; Ruzicka and Littlejohn, 1981). The area was mapped by Clark (1986) at a scale of 

                                                 
3 14C years are based on the decay constant or "half life" of the isotope. They diverge from real 
years since the rate of production of 14C by cosmic rays in the atmosphere is not linear and is 
difficult to calibrate - for instance, by measuring 14C in counted (annual growth) tree rings. 



 15

1:20,000 (for the Province of Québec), and metallogenic and geochemical studies were 
also carried out (Poisson, 1992). 
 
Regional reconnaissance exploration really commenced in the Labrador Trough from 
1929 to the late 1940's. The Romanet Horst was covered by intense exploration in the 
period 1961 to 1966 leading to the discovery of Cu mineralization by Delhi-Pacific (with 
12 diamond drill holes). The Taché Lake showing in the eastern portion of the Sagar 
Property was drilled by Riocanex in 1962 (5 diamond drill holes). Saucon Development 
Corp. examined the area between Eagle Lake and Lake Mistamisk in 1962. Bornite 
Copper Corp. examined ground west of Lac Du Chambon in 1962, and Conwest (St. Joe 
Syndicate) examined the area around Lac Plisse in 1963 (Béland, 1976). 
 
During 1975, Canada Tungsten Mining Corp. reexamined gold-bearing radioactive 
albitite veins at the "Kish" showing (a.k.a "Eagle" or "Béland"). However, as shown in 
Figure 17, the Kish showing is separate from the Eagle Showing. Track-etch and 
emanometer surveys were carried out over a circa 1 square km grid, and 20 diamond drill 
holes totaling 2,907 m were completed with limited results. During 1978, Leslie Kish 
found another showing located about 1 km SE of the previous discovery – a showing 
comprised of Au-U-bearing albitite veins. In 1979, Soquem optioned the property from 
Canada Tungsten, mapped radioactive boulders, made detailed geological maps and 
conducted an emanometer survey as extensions of the previous Canada Tungsten surveys. 
In 1983, Saarberg-Interplan (afterwards called Interuranium) identified the Mistamisk 
boulder field (a.k.a. "Clandestine") by ground follow-up of an airborne scintillometer 
survey. At that time, the boulder field was on the Canada Tungsten-Soquem ground so no 
work could be done (hence the name "Clandestine"). 
 
In 1986, La Fosse Platinum Group Inc. ("La Fosse") carried out preliminary sampling of 
all known showings, and 41 diamond drill holes for 1,585m (5,200 feet) were completed. 
The Mistamisk (Clandestine) radioactive boulder field was relocated and a limited drill 
program (21 drill holes totaling 1,636m or 5,367 feet) did not find the bedrock source. 
Further work narrowed targets down to 4 emanometer anomalies which were diamond 
drilled in 1990 (25 holes for a total of 1,117m or 3.664 feet), but again failed to trace the 
source of the mineralization. An unmineralized mudstone similar in appearance to the 
host of the radioactive boulders was intersected "up-ice" but yielded no mineralization 
results of note. Gamma ray logs were conducted down the drill holes.  
 
In the winter of 1993, Virginia drilled 15 diamond holes for a total of 1,111.82 m with 
little success (Poisson, 1994a). In 1994 also, Hemlo Gold Inc. drilled 6 diamond drill 
holes for 1,081.9 m. Best results were 0.5% Cu over 0.5 m in hole SA-94-1, and 0.7% Cu 
over 2.9 m in hole SA-94-6 including 2.9% Cu over 0.5 m (Gariépy, 1994). In 1994, 
Kennecott Canada flew an airborne radiometric, electromagnetic and magnetic survey 
(Figure 6). In 1995, Kennecott drilled 7 holes for 1,390 m, but had limited results. 
Virginia renamed the Clandestine boulder field the Mistamisk boulder field. In 1997, 
Inmet drilled 6 diamond drill holes for 1,790 m, and the best assay was 0.5% Cu and 0.3 
g/t Au over 1.5 m in hole SGR-02 (Tremblay and Gagnon, 1998). In 1998, Inmet drilled 
21 diamond drill holes for a total of 6,074 m (Gagnon, 1998). Best intersections in the 



 16

1998 campaign were 3.31 g/t Au and 0.11% U over 0.6 m in hole SGR-09; 3.33 g/t Au 
and 0.15% U over 0.61 m in hole SGR-09 as well as 31.2 g/t Ag over 1.5 m.  As in other 
drilling campaigns many small intervals with 0.1% to 0.4% Cu were also found.

9.  GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
9.1 Regional Geological Setting 
 
Most of the surface of the Sagar Property is covered by unconsolidated material – the 
remains and reworked remains of Pleistocene till sheets. Poisson (1992b) estimates the 



 17

area to have around 1% outcrop mainly on the slopes bordering the Mistamisk Valley.  
Beneath the unconsolidated material, the claim groups are underlain by supracrustal units 
of the Labrador Trough (a.k.a. New Quebec Orogen), an Early Proterozoic continental 
margin sequence with remnants of large igneous provinces ("LIPs") back-thrust onto its 
former depositional basement (the Early Proterozoic-peneplained Superior Province).  
 
Kearey (1976) observed that the Labrador Trough was a linear fold-belt partly marking 
the junction of the Superior and Churchill provinces - a NNW-SSE trending belt roughly 
160 km wide by 1,200 km long (Figure 7). Gravity profiles show gently decreasing 
anomalies over the Superior Province to the west reaching a minimum beneath the 
Trough, and thence increasing abruptly over the Churchill Province to the east (~15 mGal 
higher). Superimposed on this pattern are several broad gravity maxima parallel to the 
Trough, one corresponding to a zone of migmatites. Kearey interpreted this geophysical 
pattern in terms of a relatively elevated Conrad discontinuity beneath the eastern 
Churchill Province that was isostatically compensated by a thickened lower crust. The 
model is consistent with basement reactivation following the collision of the Superior and 
Churchill provinces which resulted in crustal thickening by ductile flow in the upper 
mantle and partial melting in the lower crust leading to a double-layered Churchillian 
crust (refractory lower portion and a more K-rich upper portion). 
 

Sketch 3 – Cross-section of Churchillian; modified after Wardle et al. (1990). 
 

 
 
In more detail, Goulet (2001) analyzed the timing of superimposed deformation in 
Ungava and observed both thin and thick-skinned tectonics in the Northern Labrador 
Trough ("N.L.T."). He noted that imbricated thrust slices, above a major decollement 
between the Trough's supracrustal sequences and underlying Archean gneisses of the 
Superior Province, were part of a D1 nappe structure, that was transported more or less 
SE. Mylonitic schist developed above the basement and Archean gneisses were thrust 
over the supracrustals. Strong tectonite fabrics, oriented NNW-SSE, are pervasive to the 
east. Metamorphic facies vary between lower greenschist and middle amphibolite. 
Folding of the D1 nappe during a D2 event was oriented NE-SW and produced klippe at 
its northern end. A final D3 event produced open upright folds with plunges to the SE. To 
the east, strike-slip faults, oriented parallel to the Trough, have dextral and oblique SW-
reverse movements associated with the late D3 folds.  
 
9.2 Labrador Trough Stratigraphy 
 
The Labrador Trough, the Torngat orogen and the Cape Smith belt are composed of Early 
Proterozoic units, occupying a significant portion of Nunavik and Labrador. Between the 



 18

Torngat orogen and the Labrador Trough lies a common hinterland called the "Core 
Zone" of the southeastern Churchill Province.4 The Core Zone contains a significant 
Archean protolith and has also been called the Rae Province (James et al., 1996; Wardle 
et al., 2002).  
 
The Trough comprises folded (SW-verging), faulted (strike-slip and/or thrust faults), and 
metamorphosed sedimentary and igneous supracrustal units belonging to the Kaniapiskau 
Supergroup. The Kaniapiskau has been subdivided into three cycles separated by 
erosional unconformities (Clark, 1994).5  Lateral variations occur from west to east 
across the Trough. Zones to the west can consist of platform and marine basin sediments 
as well as fluviatile sediments. In the centre, zones may consist of volcanics and 
turbidites; to the east, zones comprise gneiss and schist.

4 Radiometric dating indicates that the Core Zone consists of reworked Archean gneisses 
subdivided into litho-tectonic domains separated by major shears. Northern Core Zone consists in 
part of amphibolite-grade pelitic gneiss, quartzite, and marble. The SE part contains high-grade, 
meta-plutonic and meta-volcanic sequences (Wardle et al., 2002). The western edge of the Core 
Zone contains the De Pas and Kuujjuaq batholiths (1.81 to 1.84 Ga) and the Kuujjuaq terrane 
(supracrustals, and tonalitic and granitic gneiss). The eastern part comprises several granulite 
domains, and the center consists of mafic to intermediate volcanics and intrusives, ultramafics, 
volcaniclastics, paragneisses, and leucogranites. The Torngat orogen farther east is bounded by 
Archean rocks of the Nain Province – a unit, itself subdivided by shear zones. Aswal et al. (1986) 
studied Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes of middle Proterozoic (1.4 to 1.65 Ga) magmas cutting Grenville, 
Churchillian and Archean units in Labrador, and argued that they were isotopically similar to the 
early Archean (>3.6 Ga) Uivak gneisses of Labrador or the Amitsoq gneisses of west Greenland."  
Such information may determine whether the crustal column beneath properties forms part of, or 
is separated from, adjacent metallogenic provinces - in this case, a metallogenic relationship to 
the uranium occurrences in the Central Labrador Mineral Belt ~300 km to the SE. 
  
5 In the southern Trough, the first cycle has conglomerates and red sandstones at its base 
(Chakonipau Formation) with intercalated (somewhat alkaline) lavas; succeeded by platformal 
dolomites, arenites, turbidites and tholeiitic basalts. The second cycle consists of basal quartz 
arenites overlain by cherts, pelitic units and iron formation capped by turbidites and tholeiitic 
basalts. The third cycle is marked by fluviatile sandstones and polymictic conglomerates.

9.3 Description of Supracrustal Lithologies 
 
Geological mapping in the Romanet Horst by Dimroth (1970), Chevé (1985) and Clark 
(1986) established the various units of Trough stratigraphy (Table 3). The Montagnais 
Group gabbros on the table are not necessarily age-correlatives. Based on detailed 
mapping, Archer (Virginia internal report) believes that age correlation among the 
various gabbro sills in the Horst is inappropriate. At the present time, Montagnais 
magmatism has been dated in the interval 1.88-1.66 Ga, and is thought by some to belong 
to the Trough's second depositional cycle. From top to bottom, a summary of the various 
stratigraphic formations in the Romanet Horst is as follows:  
 

a) Mistamisk and Bacchus Formations:  These units are quite similar and comprise 
massive and pillowed basaltic flows (from 10 to 20 m thick) interbedded with 
graphitic shale and gabbro sills. The Mistamisk Fm also contains tuffs. These 
units are present on the sides of the Horst. 

b) Romanet Formation: This unit consists of distal grey to black graphitic slates 
along with pyritic greywacke, sandstone, pillowed basalt and conglomerate. 

c) Du Chambon Formation:  The unit occurs throughout the central part of the Horst. 
It consists mainly of grey to black shale that is frequently pyritiferous. Where it 
comes into contact with the Uvé Fm stratigraphically beneath, it is characterized 
by interbedded slates, dolomites and chert. Dimroth (1978) suggested that this 
unit was a facies correlative of the Romanet Fm. The Du Chambon Fm was the 
focus of local strain, and exhibits both strong folding and good cleavage. 

d) Uvé Formation:  Occurring throughout the central part of the Horst, around 60 m 
of non-stromatolitic dolomite is underlain by a similar thickness of interbedded 
mudstone, siltstone and dolomite. 

e) Alder Formation: This unit also occurs in the central part of the Horst and consists 
of grey to white quartzitic sandstones, grey calc-arenites, calcareous siltstones, 
massive and stromatolitic dolomites, sandy dolomites, and dolomitic sandstones. 

f) Lace Lake Formation:  Occurring on the NW part of the Sagar Property, it is 
distinguished from the similar looking Dunphy Fm by the presence of ~50% 
mudstone. The mudstones are variegated purple, green, grey, black, and 
occasionally yellow and are laminated at the millimeter scale. North of Lac 
Romanet, greenish schists of possible volcanic origin are interbedded with the 
mudstones. Some sandstones and dolomite beds are also present.  

g) Dunphy Formation:  This unit comprises dolomite that is often laminated but 
rarely stromatolitic along with interbeds of laminated purple, green and grey 
mudstone – the mudstone content increases towards the top of the column. 

h) Chaponikau Formation: Present throughout the Horst, it consists of conglomerate, 
sandstone, mudstone and basalt. A red conglomerate with arkosic sandstone 
interbeds occurs at the base, overlain by grey arkosic sandstones, arkoses, and 
black, grey, green and purple mudstones, as well as an upper massive grey or 
grayish green magnetic basalt unit. 

 
Kuznetsov et al. (2003) note that dolomites of the Dunphy, Portage, Alder, and Uvé 
formations have the petrographic character of original limy units that were dolomitized 



 20

immediately after the formation of early diagenetic calcite in unconsolidated units. Rb-Sr 
isotopic systematics suggest partial de-dolomitisation during regional metamorphism. 
Such features might be used to determine whether Cu mineralization in dolomite in the 
SE part of the Property had a "syngenetic" or "epigenetic" origin.  
 
9.4 Intrusions in the Romanet Horst 
 
Outcropping intrusions are not common within the Horst, but some pegmatite dykes and 
rare granite dykes have been found. Small gabbro bodies have been mapped, most 
commonly to the SE (Gagnon, 1998). These gabbros are thought to be older than the 
Montagnais gabbros. Granite cobbles are abundant in the till to the N, but the source of 
the granite is not known. The abundance and uniformity of the cobbles lead Charbonneau 
(1996b, 1997) to postulate that the granite was derived from within the horst, as opposed 
to outside Archean terrains. A simplified structural cross-section is shown in Figure 8.  
 
9.5 Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) 
 
From time to time, Earth history is punctuated by periods when large volumes of mafic 
magma are erupted. These magmas are not generated at "normal" spreading ridges or 
above "normal" subduction zones and are termed Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs). In the 
Archean and Lower Proterozoic, komatiites (ultramafic lavas and sills) are common LIP 
units. Belts of LIP mafic-ultramafics surround the Superior Province including sequences 
in the Labrador Trough, the Cape Smith belt (northern Ungava), eastern Hudson Bay 
(Belcher Islands), the Thompson and Fox River belts (Manitoba and Ontario), and the 
Marquette Range Supergroup (USA). These belts represent a metallotect because of two 
major Ni mining districts, the Thompson and the Raglan Nickel Belts.  
 
During the period 2.19-2.17 Ga, the Payne River diabase dyke swarm cut northern 
Ungava (in the Cape Smith Belt), and the Cramolet Lake sills (as part of a Cycle 1 
magmatic event) are found in the Labrador Trough. In the time interval 1.88 to 1.90 Ga, 
further LIPs are found surrounding the Archean Superior Province. This magmatism is 
present in the Labrador Trough (including the Montagnais sills belonging to a magmatic 
Cycle 2), and has been linked to rifting and possible separation of a micro-continent (St-
Onge et al., 2000) in the NE-sector of the Superior Province.6 Ni-Cu-PGE deposits are 
commonly associated with LIPs. Notable examples include the Siberian Traps and the 

                                                 
6 Baragar (1960) summarized geochemical data on one section of the Labrador Trough LIPs as 
follows, quote, "Basalts and sedimentary rocks in the eastern half of the Labrador Trough are 
profusely intruded by gabbro sills. In the Ahr Lake area, Quebec, where the igneous rocks were 
studied in detail, the gabbros are divided into normal gabbros, leopard rocks, and metagabbros. 
Metagabbros, which are confined to the eastern part of the area, are equivalent to normal 
gabbros except for two unusual varieties, leuco- and melano-metagabbros. Normal gabbro sills 
have differentiated into olivine-bearing lower and pegmatitic upper, portions. The pegmatite of 
one sill (albite gabbro pegmatite) has sodic plagioclase in contrast with andesine in other 
pegmatites and a mesostasis interpreted as devitrified glass. […] Normal gabbros are tholeiites 
which show an iron-rich trend similar to the Skaergaard trend but with negligible alkali 
enrichment. Basalts of the area are equivalent to the parent magma of the normal gabbros, and 
differentiation was in situ. Low K and Sr are characteristic of the province." 



 21

Duluth Complex (Naldrett, 1999). Such deposits, however, are not expected to be found 
on the Sagar Property although small deposits of this type have been found in the 
Labrador Trough elsewhere (Clark, 2005).  
 
LIP units on and beside the Property may explain the Cu-rich character of some drill 
intersections (e.g., Delhi-Pacific drill holes discussed below), since Cu deposits can occur 
in association with LIPs (e.g., on the Michigan Peninsula, and the Coppermine volcanics 
north of Yellowknife). Hydrothermal circulation of crustal fluids through the LIP basalts 
beside the Romanet Horst may have contributed Cu directly to the mineralization. 
 
10. DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
10.1 Labrador Trough Deposit Types 
 
Explorationists were drawn to the Labrador Trough by large iron formations that have 
been mined since 1954. Direct shipping iron ores were mined at Schefferville from 1954 
to 1982. Iron concentrate production began in 1961 in the SW Trough, and in 2000, three 
mines were producing concentrate and pellets at a rate of 35 Mt per year (Neal, 2000). 
West and north of Schefferville, several billion metric tonnes have been outlined as fine-
grained, cherty magnetite iron formation. Such targets do not exist in the Romanet Horst. 
 
According to Quebec's 2003 exploration overview, the economic potential of the Trough 
lies mainly in lithologies that host exhalative massive sulphides with Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au, 
sediment-hosted stratiform Cu deposits, magmatic Cu-Ni-PGE deposits in picritic flows 
and sills, and lode Au deposits. According to this review, the Lac Romanet area 
constitutes a highly prospective area, especially in the Dunphy Formation, and offers 
promising potential for sedimentary Cu. Several Zn-Cu-Au-Ag sulphide deposits are 
known in sandy-pelitic units of the Trough's second cycle. Showings appear to be similar 
to Besshi VMS deposits but are not being targeted specifically on the Sagar Property.  
 
10.2 Deposit Types Considered 
 
The presence of uranium and gold along with chalcophile elements such as Cu and Co 
and even trace Ni-sulphosalts is fairly common, in various ore deposit models.7 Models 
considered for the Sagar Property include the following: 

a) Sandstone Uranium Model: Setterfield (2006) suggested that the Central Labrador 
Trough type U-Cu-Au deposits may have features similar to the Athabasca Basin-
type of Saskatchawan. Also known as unconformity-related uranium deposits, 
such ores consist of massive pods, veins and/or disseminations of uraninite 

                                                 

7 Fe, Cu, Mo, Co and Ni are commonly found in both hydrothermal vein systems and in stratiform 
sedimentary layers (e.g., sedex deposits in the Congo, China and the Yukon).

associated with an unconformity between fluviatile Proterozoic sandstone basins 
and underlying basement metamorphics.8 The basins are unmetamorphosed, flat-
lying, and late Lower Proterozoic to Middle Proterozoic in age. Basement 
comprises shear-zone-separated blocks of Lower Proterozoic meta-sedimentary 
belts and Archean to Proterozoic granitoids. Along with the uraninite 
mineralization (usually as pitchblende), there are variable amounts of Ni, Co, As 
and traces of Au, Pt and Cu. Half graben are found to the west of the Labrador 
Trough, and at Dieter Lake about 180 km WSW of the Property, there are 
stratabound uranium deposits (Clark, 2005) hosted in Lower Proterozoic Sakami 
formation sediments believed to be age equivalents of Trough units. 

b) Albitization Gold-Uranium Model: In the Early Proterozoic Huronian Gold Belt 
of Ontario, an initial pulse of albitization occurred through the rock types that host 
ore (Gates, 1991). Albitization in and along the boundaries of massive units 
occurred during prograde metamorphism and regional deformation. Albitization 
zones up to several hundred meters long were then followed by silica flooding, 
and carbonate veins and breccias (dolomite and ankerite). These alteration 
packages stiffened the hydrothermal-metamorphic alteration package allowed 
further brittle deformation, and the gold episode arrived along with sulphidization 
and the infilling of fissures by chlorite, carbonate and silica, with pyrite and/or 
arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and native gold. During the waning phases, narrow 
quartz veins cut the alteration packages, and gold can be found along the margins 
of some quartz veins along with chalcopyrite, pyrite and some cobalt sulpho-salts. 
Albitization is a common feature in Romanet Horst mineralization. 

c) Reaction Bed Replacement Model: Stratabound copper-gold breccias may occur 
adjacent to crustal-scale faults in actively deforming fold belts. Focused 
hydrothermal discharge into reactive beds such as dolomite can precipitate copper 
and associated chalcophile elements forming replacement breccia deposits (e.g., 
Cloncurry mineral field in Queensland; Blake et al., 1991). If intrusions exploit 
the same dilatent zones as the hydrothermal fluids, lithophile-element packages 
including U, W and Mo may be compressed into the same area as the zone of 
chalcophile precipitation. The Viking Au-U Showing has aspects suggesting a 
reaction bed replacement model (stratabound). Depending on the location of 
strong redox boundaries in the mineralized system, such deposits might be seen to 
be reduced equivalents of the IOCG model discussed below. 

d) Iron-Oxide Copper Gold (IOCG) Model: According to Corriveau (2005) who 
wrote the IOCG deposit model for the GSC's "Mineral Deposits of Canada" 
website, the Romanet Horst may be prospective for such deposit types.  Deposits 
of this kind do not have unique lithological hosts or ages. Alteration zones 
associated with these deposits, however, have a primary Ca-Na regional alteration 
that is superimposed upon by focused potassic and FeO alteration. The deposits 
form at shallow to mid-crustal depths in extensional continental settings, and in 
the case of Olympic Dam in South Australia, at the junction of continental-scale 
lineaments (Reeve et al., 1990). In 1996, geologists working for Western Mining 
Corp. examined data on the Sagar Property, and speculated that the mineralization 
might be explained in terms of an iron oxide-copper-gold vein-breccia type model 

                                                 
8 Uraninite is ideally UO2 but commonly occurs as pitchblende (U2O5.UO3 = U3O8).

(Setterfield and Tykajlo, 2000). A hematite breccia has been found on an island in 
Mistamisk Lake, but its context has not yet been determined. 

11.  MINERALIZATION 
 
11.1 Delhi-Pacific and Taché Lake Cu-Au Showings 
 
The Delhi-Pacific showings occur on the cliff north of the Romanet River near the border 
shears and faults of the Romanet Horst (Figure 9). Mineralization consists of pyrite cubes 
with some chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite hosted in various silicified and albitized and/or 
carbonatized shear zones. Host rocks include sheared and altered basalts and gabbros; 
unfoliated albitites; albitite breccias composed of ~10 cm albitite fragments in a chlorite 
and/or albitite and/or carbonate matrix; and black translucent "cherts."  Most units could 
be described as hydrothermally altered mylonites. The quantity of sulphides seems to 
increase with degree of deformation and alteration, and locally massive sulphides have 
been seen. Delhi-Pacific drilled 12 holes in 1962 (for 1,546 m). 
 
Taché Lake was similar to the Delhi-Pacific discovery but of smaller extent. La Fosse 
also found other showings on the north side of the Romanet Horst outside the Sagar 
Property including the GM, Dillman and Cobalt Bloom discoveries.  
 
11.2 Albitite Gold-Uranium Mineralization 
 
The Kish and Eagle pegmatitic uranium-gold vein discoveries made by La Fosse strike 
N120-150°E. They comprise vertical albitite veins hosted by a massive green mudstone 
at the base of the Lace Lake formation, and appear to be in the axial plane and flanks of a 
recumbent isoclinal synform. Veins are from 1 to 50 cm thick and up to 80 m long. They 
also crosscut foliation and generally stop at dolomite bed contacts within the green 
mudstone – that is, the veins appear to be post-intense deformation. The veins themselves 
consist of albite and quartz with patches of pitchblende, uraninite crystals, yellow 
uranium oxides, Pb and Ni tellurides and visible gold. Disseminated pyrite and 
chalcopyrite is common in the host mudstone. Samples collected in 1988 recorded values 
of 12 g/t Au over 0.2 m and 21.2 g/t Au over 0.1 m (Fournier, 1988). Inmet reported 
values of 0.8% U and 5.4 g/t Au over 0.3 m at the Eagle showing, and 1% U and 1.0 g/t 
Au at the Kish Showing (Archer, internal Virginia report). 
 
Of particular interest is the recently discovered Viking showing located on the north bank 
of the Romanet River roughly halfway between the Kish and Eagle Showings. According 
to Archer (internal Virginia report), quote,  
 
"[Where exposed]… the outcrop is approximately 150 metres long. Almost continuously along its 
length, a gold-uranium enriched sandy dolomitic unit horizon was located consistently between 
two argillic units. The horizon is 0.1 to 0.7 metre thick. Mineralization is characterized by the 
presence of hematite and malachite and is associated with sericite-albite alteration. Grab 
samples have returned up to 223 g/t Au and 0.1% U. Locally albitized and hematized, 
crosscutting and parallel centrimetric structures have been noted underneath the Viking horizon."

11.3 Mistamisk (Clandestine) Boulder Field 
 
In 1988, 157 radioactive boulders were mapped on a grid in an area ~500 x 200 m (long 
axis N-S). The boulder mineralization appears to be hosted by a "replaced" albitized 
sediments showing evidence of structural control such as fracturing and brecciation. 
Mineralization consists of pitchblende, other uraniferous minerals, Pb and Ni tellurides 
and gold (Figure 10). The average grade from 31 assayed boulders was 50.7 g/t Au and 
0.3% U (Lulin, 2002). 
 
To test this boulder field, a program of Quaternary geological mapping using boulder size 
and other features was conducted to find drill targets (Thomas, 1993; Charbonneau, 
1996a, 1996b, 1997; Figure 11). Glaciation appears to have proceeded from south to 
north, and the mineralized boulders were thought to occur in an ablation till above a basal 
till. A VLF survey was undertaken, and an IP survey found an 800 m long anomaly. A 
Powell tube Radon gas survey on 50 m lines at intervals of 12.5 m was also conducted 
suggesting that the source of the boulders was not close. 
 
12.  EXPLORATION 
 
12.1 Exploration to date 
 
Previous exploration on the Property is described in Item 8.2, Table 2, Items 11.1, 11.2 
and 11.3, Table 3 above; and in Items13.1, Table 4 and Items 13.2, 13.3 and 13.4 below.  
 
12.2 Preparation for the Summer of 2006 
 
We have thoroughly reviewed a recommended exploration program by Geovector 
Management Inc. (Setterfield, 2006), to quote: "GeoVector contracted aspects of the 
planning/targeting to three outside consultants […] a geochemist […] examined the available 
government lake sediment and stream sediment data, and also submitted a proposal to 
undertake a water survey over the property. […] a structural geologist […] was engaged to 
conduct a structural study of the Sagar Property and recommend appropriate targets. […] a 
Quaternary geologist […] briefly reviewed the Quaternary information […]."  
 
GeoVector also reviewed and reprocessed geophysical information, examined previous 
work reports, and created a GIS compilation. Targets were recommended based on this 
GIS combination-compilation. Tykajlo (2006, internal Geovector report) reprocessed 
Kennecott airborne magnetic-EM-radiometric data (1994) as well as Inmet gravity data 
(1997) and added a geo-registered Landsat image. Geophysical GIS layers included:  
 

a) Total magnetic intensity, vertical gradient, first vertical derivative and tilt 
derivative layers produced from the magnetic data. 

b) Equivalent uranium (eU), eU/eTh, and a ternary eU/eTh/eK layers produced from 
the radiometric data.  

c) Residual Bouguer gravity map. 
d) Calculated depth to basement.  



 25

This information was then provided to an outside consultant for a structural study (see 
below), and forms part of the updated GeoVector GIS project. Tykajlo also inferred a 
number of faults from his data analysis. 
 

12.3 Geochemical Compilation 
 
Jackson (2006, internal Geovector report) examined public-domain data on lake and 
stream sediments (he also procured public-domain rock geochemical data). As is 
common, public-domain lake sediment samples are generally too widely spaced to be 
useful for finding direct mineral targets. Water pH was in the range 5.1 to 7.7, which 
Jackson considered favorable for both U and base metal solubility, and this suggests that 
surface water geochemistry may be a valuable exploration tool in this particular case. 
Based on his analysis, Jackson suggests that the elements Co, Cu, Hg, Mo, Pb, U and Zn 
assayed in stream sediment samples may reflect the known mineralization types on the 
Property. By identifying statistical thresholds and cut-off points for data display of the 
elements listed above, Jackson then created broad-brush geochemical maps to be 
compared with an initial target assessment made by GeoVector geologists based on an 
examination of previous exploration data and ideas.  
 
Of particular interest, Jackson observed that the area of the Mistamisk boulder field 
(GeoVector Area 3) and a NW-trending fault interpreted to control the location of the 
Eagle, Viking and Kish showings (GeoVector Area 1) contain few stream geochemical 
anomalies, due to the fact that most of the known occurrences are along the main river in 
areas of outcrop, and an area not sampled during the stream sediment program. 
GeoVector areas 2 and 5 (the west and east horst-bounding faults respectively) display 
abundant geochemical anomalies, and confirm both the methodology and the targets. 
Area 4 (a GeoVector conceptual target) shows up as a multi-element stream sediment 
anomaly (U-Mo-Cu-Hg-Co) which is of considerable extent. He recommended extending 
the test area at least 1 km to the west from the previously defined area. There are also U-
Cu-Hg anomalies along the eastern margin of the Horst, to the NW of the boulder field, 
and Jackson also recommended defining a new target area there. 
 
12.4 Geochemical Field Program Summer of 2006 
 
Jackson believes that the stream sediment data, though sparse, has been useful in 
reinforcing defined target areas and possibly defining another. His recommendations 
include a detailed water sampling program within the target areas to provide more 
focused targets for follow-up investigation. There are numerous collection sites in the 
streams and ponds on the Property. To gain property-wide coverage, six samples should 
be collected per sq km, for a total of ~350 samples, but ten to twelve samples per sq km 
would be more appropriate within designated target areas. In short, to cover both the 
Property and detail areas would require approximately 600 samples including control 
samples. This program is estimated to cost $50,000 (not including helicopter and man-
power support). It is recommended that this program be undertaken, and its timing would 
be best during the early phase of field work.

12.5 Structural Study 
 
McNeill (2006, internal GeoVector report) reviewed the GIS compilation data and ideas 
presented by GeoVector. McNeill recognized a large-scale fold within the Romanet 
Horst, that was best shown as curvilinear shapes in resistivity data (Figure 13), but was 
also supported by magnetic, gravity, radiometric, digital elevation modeling ("DEM," 
Figure 14) and satellite imagery. A major ENE-striking fault hosting a main GeoVector 
target seems to coincide with the fold's hinge zone – a common focus for hydrothermal 
mineralization in many deposit types. McNeill postulates that complex folding caused 
repetition of stratigraphy within the Horst, and also postulates that apparent magnetite 
addition/destruction reaction features recognized by GeoVector along the ENE-fault are 
likely to be associated with the large fold structure – a feature that can be traced to the SE 
for ~15 km. McNeill also interpreted a number of other faults.  
 
McNeill's analysis generated five targets based on the interpreted structural patterns, 
suggesting possible zones of alteration (which have not yet been field-confirmed), the 
distribution of known mineral occurrences, and a large-scale, apparently subtly "folded" 
equivalent uranium anomaly. His highest priority target confirms a GeoVector target. A 
horst-bounding fault (GeoVector Area 5) was regarded as noteworthy.  
 
12.6 Targets for the Summer of 2006 
 
The targets generated by GeoVector, Jackson and McNeill are summarized as follows: 
 

a) Target 1, contains the Mistamisk (Clandestine) boulder field, and the Eagle, Kish 
and Viking showings: One possible focus for this target area is an unconformity-
related U-Au deposit at or just above the unconformity between the Archean 
basement and the Proterozic sediments of the Romanet Horst. Under this scenario, 
the Au-U mineralization and alteration found to date may represent leakage from 
an underlying, larger deposit (Setterfield, 2006). Indeed, unconformity-related U 
deposits do have a significant leakage zone above them (Figure 12). 

b) Target 2: Unconformity-related U-Au near the fault which bounds the Romanet 
Horst to the SW.  An alternate mineralization style for this target would be a vein-
breccia-replacenent model. 

c) Target 3, Mistamisk (Clandestine) boulder field: The Mistamisk boulder field has 
been sporadically investigated, and the immediate area has had circa 50 drill 
holes. Additional investigation is considered to be justified in the light of the GIS 
compilation. A Quaternary specialist will re-examine the surficial geology and 
will undertake till sampling, pebble counting and studies of gold grain 
morphology in order to determine whether the boulders are associated with a 
locally derived till or have traveled some distance.  

d) Target 4: This target was developed in 2000 by GeoVector personnel, and occurs 
along the major ENE-trending fault that appears on magnetic data to have 
undergone hydrothermal alteration, at its intersection with a WNW structural 
corridor. The target sits at the head of a radioactive dispersion fan inferred from 
radiometric data (Figures 15 and 16) – possibly including the Mistamisk boulder 



 27

field. No drilling has been conducted within this target area. Quaternary 
stratigraphic data, prospecting and bedrock geology are planned. 

e) Target 5, boundary fault-hosted discoveries: Along the NE margin of the Horst, 
the Delhi Pacific and Taché showings were drilled in 1962, but have received 
little attention since. A uranium showing (Simon a.k.a. Polar Ice) has not been 
examined in any detail, and radioactive boulders occur in the NW corner of the 
target area. McNeill has interpreted a folded stratigraphic unit showing variable 
magnetite to hematite alteration passing through this target, and Jackson has 
identified a number of Cu-in-stream anomalies and one U anomaly.  

f) Target 6, NE margin of Horst: Jackson identified a new target on the edge of the 
Horst, immediately north of the Mistamisk boulder field. This target has two 
stream sediment Cu anomalies and one U geochemical anomaly. 

g) Target 7, ENE-trending structure: A major ENE structure breaks the resistivity 
pattern (Figure 13) and is interpreted to be a faulted fold hinge line. The feature is 
also present on magnetic images and residual gravity images.  

h) Target 8, sedimentary copper (± Zn ± U) on the SE Sagar Claims: The SE part of 
the Horst contains Cu in the Dunphy Fm. (seven Inch, Lac Ronsin), the Lace Lake 
Fm (Eagle Copper) or the Alder Fm (Deadbeat). According to Clark (2005), in a 
report for the Government of Québec, a "resource" of 20 million tons grading 
0.02% to1.5% Cu was outlined. This figure is not NI43-101 compliant, is not in 
accordance with section 2.4 of the Instrument, and is not in accordance with the 
categories set out in sections 1.2 and 1.3 of the Instrument. Fieldwork is required 
to determine the geological parameters of these discoveries.   

 
There are other locations worthy of geological investigation including: Hematite breccia 
on an island in Mistamisk Lake;  Au-in-soil anomalies SW of Mistamisk Lake; 
radioactive boulders outside the main Mistamisk boulder field; radioactive boulders near 
the Simon showing NW of the Taché Lake showing; the Lomer showing (Cu showing to 
the NW); sample RR-94-01 (5.6% Cu/360 ppb Au) to the NW of Goose Lake; 
Kennecott's SR-33 anomaly, with hematized, albitized boulders and up to 170 ppm U; a 
residual gravity anomaly immediately NE of the horst.  
 
13.  DRILLING 
 
13.1 Delhi-Pacific and Taché Lake Showings 
 
In 1962, Delhi-Pacific drilled a total of 12 holes for 5,072 feet (1,546 m) on this Cu-Au 
discovery.  Concerning the issue of "resource" at this showing, Fournier (1989) came to 
the following conclusions, edited quote:  
 
"[…] showings  [at] Delhi Pacific and Taché Lake [...] consist of disseminated pyrite, pyrrhotite 
and chalcopyrite in sheared basalts and/or gabbros and various facies of albitites interpreted as 
hydrothermalized mylonites. Best values are 4.5 g/t Au and 0.75% Cu over 1.2 m at Delhi-Pacific 
and 3.5 g/t Au over 1 m at Tache Lake. These 2 showings which have been thoroughly sampled 
and are fairly well explored […and] do not present any potential for the development of economic 
mineralization."

Delhi-Pacific drilling results that can be recovered are outlined in Table 4, on a grid 
parallel to the northern horst fault. Surface sampling (trenching) by La Fosse in 1988 
resulted in 4.5 g/t Au and 0.75% Cu in "Trench D;" 1.1 g/t Au over 3.6 m in "Trench B;" 
3.4 g/t Au over 0.5 m in "Trench A;" and 1.7 g/t Au over 2m in "Trench G." The Taché 
Lake showing was drilled by Riocanex in 1962 (5 holes for 292.9 feet, or 89 m) – assay

data are unavailable. Hole TA-01 reported 8.4 ft of green to black medium-grained 
chloritic rock with sulphide bands (massive pyrrhotite with blebs of pyrite and 
chalcopyrite). Hole TA-02 encountered a 2.3 ft section described as disseminated blebs to 
massive sulphide with pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. 
 
13.2 Kish and Eagle Albitite Au-U Showings 
 
In 1975, Canada Tungsten Mining Corp reexamined gold-bearing radioactive albitite 
veins at the "Kish" and Eagle Showings. Track-etch and emanometer surveys were 
carried out over a circa 1 square km grid, and 20 diamond drill holes totaling 2,907 m 
were completed with poor results (best result 0.02% U3O8). 
 
La Fosse Platinum drilled 41 short holes (total of 1,585 m) testing the albitite uranium-
gold mineralization at the Kish and Eagle Showings. Best intersections returned 1.3 g/t 
Au over 0.7 m in Hole No. 6; 1.17 g/t Au over 0.4 m in Hole No. 10; 1.4 g/t Au over 0.5 
m in hole No. 21 (Fournier, 1988).  There was difficulty in establishing a relationship 
between U and Au grades, likely due to the fact that the mineralization is a combination 
of chalcophile and lithophile elements, deposited in changing redox boundary conditions. 
The paragenetic mineral sequence should be established. 
 
13.3 Mistamisk (Clandestine) Boulder Field 
 
Finding the source of the boulders has been difficult. Drilling by La Fosse (21 holes for 
1,636 m on their 1988 grid) returned poor results. A 3 cm thick radioactive veinlet in 
Hole No. 57 returned an assay of 0.58% tungsten.  An unmineralized mudstone similar in 
appearance to the host of the boulders was intersected "up-ice" but yielded no results. 
Gamma ray logs were conducted down these drill holes. On-going work in 1990 
narrowed targets down to four emanometer anomalies which were then diamond drilled 
(25 holes for a total of 1,117 m) but this program also failed to trace the boulder source. It 
was considered possible that the emanometer anomalies were caused by buried 
radioactive boulders up-ice from the boulder field (Fournier, 1990).  
 
During the winter of 1993, Virginia drilled 15 diamond holes for a total of 1,111.82 m 
and met with little success (Poisson, 1994b). In 1994 also, Hemlo Gold Inc. drilled 6 
diamond drill holes for a total of  1,081.9 m. Best obtained results were 0.5% Cu over 0.5 
m in hole SA-94-1, and 0.7% Cu over 2.9 m in hole SA-94-6 including 2.9% Cu over 0.5 
m (Gariépy, 1994).  
 
The rationale of subsequent drilling was to test the Lace Lake Fm., host to the Viking 
Showing and a possible source of the Mistamisk boulder field. In 1997, therefore, Inmet 
drilled 6 diamond drill holes for 1790 m, and the best assay was 0.5% Cu and 0.3 g/t Au 
over 1.5 m in hole SGR-02 (Tremblay and Gagnon, 1998). In 1998, Inmet drilled 21 
diamond drill holes for a total of 6,074 m (Gagnon, 1998). Best intersections in the 1998 
campaign were 3.31 g/t Au and 0.11% U over 0.6 m in hole SGR-09; 3.33 g/t Au and 
0.15% U over 0.61 m in hole SGR-09 as well as 31.2 g/t Ag over 1.5 m. Many small 
intervals with 0.1% to 0.4% Cu were also found.

14. SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH   
 
Previous sampling included the splitting of diamond drill core in half over obviously 
mineralized intervals.  This procedure is standard practice in mineral exploration and 
would be continued in any future drilling program. Half core is retained for future 
examination and evaluation in a secure location. Due diligence would be followed once a 
sampling campaign is commenced, whether the campaign be soil samples, grab samples, 
the cutting of diamond drill cores with a diamond saw, or surface channel samples. All 
sampling must be supervised by a "qualified person" as defined under the current CIM 
and NI43-101 guidelines.  
 
15. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

A qualified person would supervise future sample collection, and the samples themselves 
would be secured directly from the site to an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited laboratory, and 
prepared at the laboratory. Drill core and assay certificates would be stored at a secure 
location. Laboratories to be used will have internal standard checks and upgrades to 
ensure quality and security following the latest industry standards and practice. For 
instance, uranium assays could be performed by an ISO/IEC 17025-compliant laboratory 
using x-ray fluorescence spectrometry on a pressed powder pellet or a borate fusion disc. 
Quality control procedures would follow industry-standard protocols and include the use 
of blind control samples. 

For uranium mineralization, it is common practice to base grades on down-hole gamma 
ray logging tools. Commonly, there is a dispersion of results among the logs and 
chemical (fluorometric) analyses of drill core, and direct neutron logging. An important 
consideration in uranium mineralization is the recoverable uranium content. "Refractory" 
uranium minerals may give good radiometric or fluorometric assay results, but may not 
be recovered in significant amounts by some production processes. If the uranium 
mineralization is not in equilibrium with its radioactive daughter elements, radiometric 
assays may not reflect recoverable uranium values. 

The definitive document on radiation protection requirements for incidentally exposed 
workers such as field personnel is the Canadian Guidelines for the Management of 
Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) published by Health Canada at 
http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewhsemt/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/pubs/contaminants/radiation/normmrn/00ehd245.pdf. This 
document was developed by the Federal Provincial Territorial Radiation Protection 
Committee and has been endorsed by federal, provincial and territorial governments. 

16. DATA VERIFICATION 
 
None of assays seen in the various reports seemed to be outside the norm for 
mineralization of this type with their visible mineral contents.  Assay value ranges from 
different company exploration campaigns compare favorably with previous assays from 
the same location. There is no need to resample multiply sampled mineral occurrences.

17.  ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
Mineralization outside the Sagar claim blocks is of similar kind to that seen within the 
claim blocks – a feature of the Romanet Horst environment. The general location of 
mineral discoveries in the NW part of the Romanet Horst is shown in Figure 17.  At the 
present time, claim ownership and targeted claim acquisition by various entities is 
confined to the Romanet Horst. Current discoveries, based on previous exploration 
campaigns, are also confined to the Horst.

21.  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
21.1 Interpretation 
 
The Property occurs in the Romanet Horst, a NW cross-cutting fault-bounded structural 
feature astride the Early Proterozoic Labrador Trough – a supracrustal thrust-fold belt in 
Labrador-Nunavik.  Several kinds of mineralization have been found on the Property 
characterized by an impressive number of U, Au, Cu, Zn and Pb showings of several 
different kinds.  
 
One discovery occurs as scattered boulders in a ~500 x 200 m area (the Miskamisk a.k.a. 
Clandestine boulder field), with 31 boulders grading an average of 50.7 g/t Au and 0.3% 
U (Lulin, 2002). The source of the boulders is an important target. In 1962, Delhi-Pacific 
found extensive Cu mineralization in shears, and low grade Cu-in-dolomite-argillite 
stratabound discoveries were made on the Property to the SE.  
 
Albitites associated with gold mineralization are typical of other Proterozoic 
mesothermal-gold discoveries, and an association of copper in shears of the Delhi-Pacific 
showing on the Property suggests significant structural control on mineralization. The 
Horst is a crustal-scale structural feature and the presence of abundant mineral showings 
within it suggests a structural focus. Such a scenario would explain the presence of both 
lithophile and chalcophile mineralization created during active deformation, along with 
crustal dewatering of the supracrustal pile, and the probability of magmatic-hydrothermal 
foci in the crustal blocks comprising the horst and adjacent graben.  



 32

21.2 Conclusions 
 
Several genetic models including a sandstone-uranium model, an albitization Cu-Au 
model, a reaction bed replacement model, and an iron oxide Cu-Au (±U) model, are 
being used for exploration on the Sagar Property. 
 
We conclude that showings found to date are evidence that the Property is worthy of 
further exploration since:  
 

a) The widely scattered mineralization found on the Property so far contains high-
grades of U, Au, and Cu.  

b) New exploration models developed by GeoVector are worthy of testing. 
c) New methodologies, such as water sampling and new Quaternary studies of gold 

grain morphology, will aid in interpretation and narrow the exploration focus. 
d) The GIS stacks have and will create new targets. 

 
22. RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
22.1 Budget Preamble 
 
The proposed exploration work program for a summer of 2006 includes the obtaining of 
property-wide geochemical water sampling (Items 12.3, 12.4); maintaining and 
upgrading the new GIS database; new Quaternary stratigraphic investigations to trace 
boulder sources (Item 12.6); and further prospecting/reconnaissance geology. GeoVector 
is working with Expedition Helicopters, who have responsibility for refurbishing the 
original base camp and providing a helicopter for the program. Yukon has obtained 
permits for exploration and camp construction.  
 
The water sampling survey will comprise collection from small streams and ponds at a 
density of 10 to 12 per sq km in designated target areas, and 5 to 6 samples per sq km 
over the rest of the Property (looking for anomalies that reflect a proximal source). This 
survey is regarded as critical, in the sense that it will provide a new layer of potential 
targeting information. The Quaternary geology is to be re-evaluated, with emphasis on 
assessing targets 3 and 4. Prospecting and reconnaissance geology will be carried out to 
further evaluate the differing targets.  
 
The budget presented below is estimated based on recent cost breakdowns experienced in 
recent exploration campaigns. GeoVector has enough experience in remote camp settings 
to provide realistic estimates of the expected costs. The budget is also based on having an 
operational camp in the period July 20 to August 25, 2006 and calls for eight technical 
personnel to occupy the camp for three weeks starting on July 20 and seven technical 
people to move into the camp starting on August 4. The budget also assumes that the 
contract helicopter is used for an average of 4 hours a day, and that each man-day in 
camp costs ~$100 which includes the cook's time, groceries, supply-flight costs, and 
other general costs (Setterfield, report prepared for Yukon, dated June 30, 2006) .

25.  ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS  
ON DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION 
PROPERTIES 
 
This Item does not apply to the Sagar Property at this time. The property has no known 
reserves and is exploratory in nature.

Figure 7 – Outline of Labrador Trough thrust packages: Sketch modified after Clark 
(2005). The Archean Superior Province to the west still acts as a basement to Trough 
supracrustals unconformably overlying its complex gneissic packages. As one proceeds 
east, Trough units are successively detached from their basement. Large-igneous-
province units have been emphasized on the figure as well.

Figure 8 – Gravity profile across the Romanet Horst; modified after Hubert, (1994). 
Several profiles were plotted and interpreted by Hubert. The profile shown here may be 
compared with a generalized cross-section of the Romanet Horst prepared by Clark 
(2005). Clark also has two suggested intrusive types intersecting the Horst. Folding and 
faulting in the central Horst stratigraphy is far more intense than that seen on Clark's 
figure summarized below.

air photograph showing oxidized stain; 2) view from below; 3) scree slope of oxidized 
mineralization boulders below outcrop; 4) view of oxidized mineralization.

Figure 10 – Photographs of Mistamisk uraniferous boulders, June 3, 2006; 1) dolomite 
with albite-rich pod showing black pitchblende and light green bloom; 2) Albitite with 
black pitchblende, autunite and torbernite with yellow to light green bloom.

Figure 11 – Quaternary program Mistamisk boulder field (Charbonneau, 1996b, 1997). 
The Mistamisk (a.k.a. Clandestine) radioactive boulder field has had several bedrock 
drilling campaigns in an attempt to find the source of the mineralization.  Efforts using 
Quaternary mapping have also failed to determine the most likely direction of the boulder 
source, and a new campaign will be undertaken in the summer of 2006 using different 
methodologies (gold grain wear in fines, etc.) to see if the source is likely to be proximal 
or distal to the boulder field (see also Item 12.6, part c).

Curvilinear fold shapes in the plateaux on either side of the Mistamisk Valley are clearly 
visible due to differential weathering, as well as a number of brittle linear faults.
