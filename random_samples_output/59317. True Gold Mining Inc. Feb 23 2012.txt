1.0 SUMMARY 
 
This  report  titled,  "Technical  Report  and  Resource  Estimate  on  the  Karma  Project,  Burkina  Faso,  
West  Africa"  (the  "Technical  Report")  dated  effective  January 1, 2012, was prepared to provide 
a NI 43-101 compliant technical report and updated resource estimate of the Au mineralization at 
the   Karma   Project,   Burkina   Faso,   West   Africa   (the   "Property"   or   the   "Karma   Project").  
Riverstone   Resources   Inc.,   ("Riverstone"   or   the   "Company")   has a 100% outright interest in 
three of the six concessions forming part of the Karma Project and a 90% interest in the other 
three.  
 
This Technical Report has been prepared in compliance with the requirements of Canadian 
National   Instrument   ("NI")   43-101 and in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian 
Institute   of  Mining,  Metallurgy   and   Petroleum   ("CIM")   Standards   on  Mineral   Resources   and  
Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve 
Definitions and adopted by CIM Council November 27, 2010.  
 
This Technical Report was prepared by  P&E Mining  Consultants  Inc.,  ("P&E")  at  the  request  of  
Mr. Dwayne L. Melrose, Director, President and Chief Operating Officer, of Riverstone, which 
is a Vancouver based company trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) under the 
symbol  of  "RVX",  and  the  Frankfurt  Stock  Exchange  under  the  symbol  "3RV". 
 
Mr. Antoine Yassa, P. Geo. a 'qualified person' under the terms of NI 43-101, conducted a site 
visit to the Karma Property from October 31 to November 3, 2011. An independent verification 
sampling program was conducted by Mr. Yassa at that time. 
 
1.1 KARMA PROJECT AREA 
 
The Karma Project lies on the African continent, in north-central Burkina Faso, near the town of 
Ouahigouya, approximately 185 km north-west of the capital city, Ouagadougou and is 
accessible from Ouagadougou via paved National Route 2 (N2), for approximately 185 km to the 
city of Ouahigouya, and thereafter via unpaved roads for another 20 km. 
 
The capital city of Ouagadougou is connected to Europe (daily flights with Air France, twice 
weekly with Air Burkina to Paris, three times per week to Brussels with Brussels Airlines), East 
Africa (twice weekly with Kenya Airways to Nairobi and Ethiopian Airways to Addis Ababa) 
and frequent flights within the West African region. 
 
The Karma Project includes six concession areas. The five Resource Estimates disclosed in this 
Technical Report are located on three of the concessions; Goulagou (GGI and GGII), Kao, and 
Rambo (Rambo and Nami). 
 
Burkina Faso's 15.3 million people belong to two major West African cultural groups—the 
Voltaic and the Mande (whose common language is Dioula). The Voltaic Mossi make up about 
one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day 
Burkina Faso from Ghana and established an empire that lasted more than 800 years. 
Predominantly farmers, the Mossi kingdom is still led by the Mogho Naba, whose court is in 
Ouagadougou. 
 
Burkina Faso is an ethnically integrated, secular state. Most of Burkina's people are concentrated 
in the south and center of the country, sometimes exceeding 48 per square km (125/sq. miles). 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. ii  
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

Hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe annually migrate to Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, many for 
seasonal agricultural work.  
 
Burkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, 
the country receives between 600 and 900 millimeters (23.6 and 35.4 inches) of rainfall; in the 
dry season, a hot, dry wind from the Sahara, called the harmattan, blows. The rainy season lasts 
approximately four months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country.  
 
The town of Ouahigouya is the main regional centre, with basic supplies and infrastructure for 
mining and exploration. Small villages are present in all the concession areas. The principal 
activity near the villages is agrarian; herding livestock (goats, sheep and cattle) and growing 
millet. The larger city of Ouagadougou has most of the services necessary for mining and 
exploration, including certified analytical laboratories.  
 
Burkina Faso's natural resources include manganese, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt 
and Au. 
 
The topography is dominated by very subdued terrain. Low rolling plateaus are cut by weakly 
incised drainage channels. Major features are long ridges capped by hard iron-rich laterite 
("cuirasse"). Vegetation is scrub woodland and savannah grassland. 
 
Water is in relatively short supply, but for drilling purposes can be obtained from seasonal 
reservoirs or from wells. 
 
The Karma Project began with the acquisition of the Rambo concession in 2003. This was the 
Company's  first  project  in  Burkina  Faso,  and  was  acquired  on  the  basis  of  examination  of  data  
from earlier work on the Rambo Main deposit by Incanore Gold Mines   Ltd.   ("Incanore"),  
including a substantial drilling program in 1997. Subsequently, the Kao concession was acquired 
by the Company in 2004, and a regional exploration program initiated. Following this, the 
Goulagou, Youba and Rounga concessions were optioned from Golden Star Resources Ltd. 
("Golden Star")  by  way  of  an  "Option  to  Purchase"  agreement  (the  "Goulagou  Agreement")  in  
2007. Finally, the Tougou concession was optioned from Golden Star in 2011, by inclusion in 
the Goulagou Agreement. Subsequently, Riverstone exercised its option under the Goulagou 
Agreement in early 2012 and acquired its 90% interest in the Goulagou, Youba, Rounga and 
Tougou concessions. 
 
1.2 GEOLOGY 
 
The geology of West and Central Africa is dominated by Precambrian shields or cratons of 
Archaean and Lower Proterozoic age, Pan-African mobile zones of Upper Proterozoic age and 
intracratonic sedimentary basins ranging from the Proterozoic to the Quaternary.  
 
The Precambrian history of this part of Africa is commonly described as a process of progressive 
accretion of a series of successively younger mobile or orogenic zones or belts to the old crustal 
nuclei of early Archaean age. Occasionally, subsequent orogenic belts developed inside existing 
cratons, but more commonly they added to the size of older cratons by the addition of new 
crustal material along their margins.  
 
Most of the cratonic nuclei in the area under discussion stabilized during the Archaean after the 
accretion of Archaean mobile zones subsequent to earlier orogenic events. The North Gabon 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. iii  
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

Archaean nucleus for example stabilized around 2.7 Ga. An exception is the West African 
craton, which stabilized much later at about 1.99 Ga after the accretion of vast areas of Lower 
Proterozoic (or Birimian) formations at the end of the Eburnean orogenic event. This fact has led 
to much confusion as to the use of the word craton in regard to West Africa in recent years.  
 
The Man Craton is considered to be a remnant of a much larger craton that included the present 
day Guyana Craton of South America. This former craton was split by continental breakup in the 
Jurassic and the two segments have since drifted apart.  
 
The Lower Archaean-Proterozoic shields consist essentially of granitic-gneissic terrains and of 
isoclinally folded volcano-sedimentary and sedimentary greenstone belts, which can be of either 
Lower Archaean or Proterozoic age. Both ages of greenstone belts are host to significant 
precious metal, base metal and bulk mineral deposits in Africa and world-wide. Archaean 
greenstone belts exist within the Man Craton and host banded iron formation ("BIF") deposits, 
Archaean mafic cumulate deposits and Mesozoic supergene nickel deposits and so are 
compositionally different from their later equivalents.  
 
The Proterozoic greenstone belts of West Africa are also known as Birimian greenstone belts, 
named after the Birim River Valley in Ghana, where both Au and diamonds occur. They 
encompass a vast area of approximately 350,000 km  covering parts of Niger, Burkina Faso, 
Benin, Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea, Liberia and Sénégal. In general the Birimian 
rocks lie outside of the cratonic Archaean areas and are sometimes thought of as mobile belts. 
 
The Proterozoic Birimian greenstone rocks have undergone orogeny in Eburnean times, which 
dates roughly from 1.99 to 2.19 Ga. The last orogenic event in West and Central Africa was the 
Pan-African of Upper Proterozoic to Lower Paleozoic age (600-450 Ma). This event completed 
the addition of new crustal material to the older shield areas composed of Archaean cratons and 
Proterozoic mobile belts. 
 
The Pan-African also overprinted and partially obliterated older pre-existing sequences of 
Archaean to Proterozoic age. Pan-African mobile belts rim the western margins of the West 
African and Congo shields: Mauritanides, Rokelides and West Congo fold belt. The Pan-African 
belt of Central Africa (also known as the Trans-Saharan mobile belt) occupies a vast area along 
the eastern margin of the West African and the north-western margin of the Congo Craton. This 
zone, which is thought to have resulted from the collision between the West African Craton and 
an ill-defined continent to the east, comprises the Adrar des Iforas and Aïr stockworks in Mali 
and Niger and large parts of Benin, Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon. 
 
The Karma Project area is contained within a large, irregularly shaped greenstone belt. Within 
the belt, local areas are underlain by generally intermediate to felsic rocks, as dykes, sills and 
irregular masses, but the majority of the rock units are mixed volcanic and sedimentary units. 
Substantial areas are covered by lateritic units, dominantly gravels and massive shields 
(cuirasse), and other areas have extensive aeolian deposits.  
 
The Goulagou deposits lie within a zone of mixed clastic sedimentary rocks, generally argillic 
siltstone and argillite with local intercalations of graphitic and chloritic schist and small irregular 
intrusive units, generally diorite to granodiorite with some more felsic units in places. Chert has 
been reported at GGII. 
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. iv  
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

The Kao deposit as currently delineated lies almost completely within an intermediate to felsic 
intrusive rock complex. There is little quartz veining, and local areas of silicification. Au 
mineralization appears to be roughly correlated with increased sulphide content, but the 
correspondence is by no means perfect, and it is not possible to define Au zones on the basis of 
visual examination. There is local laterite cover, usually less than three or four m thick.  
 
The Rambo Main deposit lies near the contact of mixed volcano-sedimentary rocks and a later 
intermediate to felsic intrusive body. The mineralized body, however, locally transgresses this 
contact. Quartz veining and silicification are common within the zone of Au mineralization, and 
the zone is well defined, with relatively sharp boundaries. There is some evidence of likely later 
cross-cutting mineralized structures. 
 
The Nami deposit is located entirely within a granodiorite, which contains a penetrative S1 
foliation. This foliation can be completely transposed by later deformation. Sulphides 
arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and pyrite are spatially associated with S2 shear zones. Arsenopyrite is 
a strong indication of higher Au content. Breccias of granodiorite (and more rarely meta-
sedimentary rocks) are observed in areas of adjacent well developed S2 strain, and north striking 
fractures are observed as a dominant fracture trend in the breccias. Breccia textures range from 
crackle breccia to mosaic breccias with minimal clast rotation, to full transported breccias with 
finer grained matrix. The breccias are typically strongly silicified. 
 
1.3 PETROGRAPHIC STUDY 
 
In September 2011, a petrographic examination and report was mandated to P.C. Le Couteur, 
("Le   Couteur") of Micron Geological Ltd. The main objective of the examination was to 
determine the occurrence of Au, i.e as native Au, in other Au-bearing minerals, or as inclusions 
or substitution in pyrite or arsenopyrite, or some combination of all of these. A previous 
mineralogical study had been completed earlier in 2011, however samples were from the Rambo 
and GGII Deposits only. The results of the previous study were reported on in the NI 43-101 
technical report authored by Dr. Giles R. Peatfield, Ph.D., P.Eng. and John A. Zbeetnoff, P.Geo. 
titled,   "Technical   Report   on   the   Karma   Project,   Burkina   Faso,  West   Africa"   dated April 14, 
2011  (the  "April  2011  Technical  Report"). 
 
Thirty-five potential samples from four Au-bearing zones were selected. The list deliberately 
included alternative samples from similar intervals in case one was not available. A final 
15 samples were selected.  
 
Five sample were selected from Kao, five samples selected from GGII, one from Rambo and 
four from GGI.  
 
The principal purpose of the petrographic study was to locate Au, however it was noted only in 
samples 2 (GGI) and 15 (Rambo). 
 
In sample 2 native Au was observed in dolomite and quartz, and as an inclusion in pyrite. In 
sample 15 Au was encountered in albite-quartz-muscovite-dolomite. Au grains ranged in size 
from a low of 5 microns to a high of 53 microns. In the five Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyzer 
("EDX")  analyses   run  on   the  Au grains, purity ranged from pure (100%) Au, to between 86% 
and 91% Au, with the remainder being Ag.  
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. v  
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

Rock types that host the Au mineralization in the four zones include fine-grained sediments and 
medium-grained feldspathic intrusives, although the identification of some of the latter is 
tentative in many cases since the deformation, metamorphism, replacement and veining that have 
affected all samples obscure the original textures to a greater or lesser extent. 
 
1.4 DEPOSIT MODEL 
 
Generally speaking, the deposits of the Karma Project are typical shear-zone hosted Au-bearing 
zones, with generally steep dips and elongate, braided character. The zones tend to pinch and 
swell,   and   locally   contain  higher   grade  "shoots"  with   steep  plunges. The deposits as such, are 
within the class of deposits known as orogenic Au, also known as quartz-carbonate vein Au. The 
Karma deposits fit the genetic model types for hosting large scale Au deposits. 
 
The classification of Au deposits as proposed by Francois Robert in 1997 was updated in 
2007 by Robert et al. for the Fifth Decennial International Conference on Mineral Exploration. 
The authors believe that the Karma Deposits are best described by the Orogenic Deposits taken 
from this paper. 
 
Orogenic Deposits include Greenstone, and Turbidite & BIF deposits, and the term orogenic is 
restricted to deposits composed of quartz-carbonate veins and associated wall rock replacement, 
associated with compressional or transpressional geological structures such as reverse faults and 
folds. Three main types of orogenic deposits are distinguished based on their host-rock 
environment: greenstone-hosted, turbidite-hosted, and BIF-hosted. 
 
Greenstone-hosted orogenic deposits are the most important of the clan and the best represented 
type among the >10 Moz deposits. The quartz-carbonate veins in these deposits typically 
combine laminated veins in moderately to steeply dipping reverse shear zones with arrays of 
shallow-dipping extensional veins in adjacent competent and lower strain rocks. The reverse 
character of the shear-zone hosted veins and shallow-dips of extensional veins attest to their 
formation during crustal shortening (Sibson et al., 1988; Robert and Poulsen 2001). 
 
In greenstone belts the significant vein deposits are typically distributed along specific regional 
compressions to transpressional structures. By virtue of their association with regional structures, 
these camps are also located at the boundaries between contrasted lithologic or age domains 
within the belt. Along these structures, the deposits commonly cluster in specific camps, 
localized at bends or major splay intersections, and where deposits typically occur in associated 
higher-order structures (Aufarb et al., 2005; Robert et al., 2005). The larger camps and deposits 
are commonly spatially associated with conglomeratic sequences as exemplified by the 
Timiskaming polymict conglomerates in the Abitibi greenstone belt and the Tarkwaian quartz 
pebble conglomerates in the Birimian shield. These deposits occur in any type of supracrustal 
rocks within a greenstone belt and cover stratigraphic positions from lower mafic-ultramafic 
volcanic to upper clastic sedimentary stratigraphic levels.  
 
At the local scale, favourable settings for these deposits represent a combination of structural and 
lithologic factors (Groves et al., 1990; Robert, 2004b). Favourable structural settings are linked 
mainly to rheologic heterogeneities in the host sequences. Shear zones and faults, universally 
present in these deposits, are developed along lithologic contacts between units of contrasting 
competencies and along thin incompetent lithologic units. Along these contacts and along 
incompetent rocks, deposits will preferentially develop at bends, and structural intersections. 
Competent rock units enclosed in less competent favour fracturing and veining. Common

lithologic associations include Fe-rich rocks such as tholeiitic basalts, differentiated dolerite sills 
and  BIF's,  and  with  competent  porphyry  stocks  of   intermediate   to   felsic  composition,  whether  
they intrude mafic-ultramafic volcanic or clastic sedimentary rocks. 
 
1.5 DRILLING 
 
The April 2011 Technical Report details all drilling up to and including part of 2011. Since the 
release of the April 2011 Technical Report, 293 holes have been completed for a total of 
46,669 m. These totals include all drilling for which assays were available at the time that the 
resource models were constructed. Approximately 41,000 metres of the total involved drilling for 
which the results were included in the models; the additional drilling was on peripheral zones not 
yet well enough defined to be modelled for resource estimation. 
 
1.6 METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
In April, 2011 the laboratory facility of Kappes, Cassiday & Associates ("KCA") received nine 
(9) plastic drums containing RC drill cuttings and split core from the Karma Project. The 
samples were prepared and utilized for metallurgical test work including rock density, cyanide 
leach and gravity concentration testing. 
 
The received material consisted of thirty-seven (37) individually numbered bags of material, 
described by zone in the provided documentation as GOULAGOU I (GGI), GOULAGOU II 
(GGII) and Kao. Each zone contained three (3) material types: oxide, transition and sulphide, as 
described in the documentation. Upon receipt, the samples were logged and assigned unique 
sample numbers. Portions of the individual samples were combined to generate Master 
composite samples to represent each type of material in each zone. 
 
Prior to crushing the split core samples, suitable specimens were selected and utilized for rock 
density testing. The rock densities of the suitable samples ranged from 1.82 to 2.80 g/cm3 with 
an overall average of 2.45 g/cm3. 
 
Portions of the Master composites were submitted to Phillips Enterprises, Inc. for Bond Ball Mill 
Work index testing. 
 
Portions from the Master composites as well as select individual samples were assayed for Au 
and Ag contents. The samples were also assayed semi-quantitatively for arsenic, copper and iron 
and quantitatively for carbon and sulphur. 
 
The carbon-in-leach,  ("CIL")  bottle  roll  tests  on  the  portions  of  head  material  indicated  the  oxide  
material leached most readily with Au extractions ranging from 87% to 98%. The transition 
material Au extractions ranged from 70% to 94%. The sulphide samples were the least amenable 
to cyanide leaching, extracting only 13% to 38% of the Au. 
 
In the gravity recoverable Au,   ("GRG")   testing,   the   oxide   samples   extracted   the   least   to   the  
concentrates, 5.7% to 11.7% of the Au. Likewise, the transition samples showed low overall Au 
extractions, 10.6% to 16.0%. The sulphide samples showed notable improvement over the oxide 
and transition samples though still not exceptional performance, extracting 29.1% to 42.3% of 
the Au to the concentrates. 
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. vii  
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

The leach tests on the GRG tails followed the same trend as the leach tests on the head material, 
oxide samples showing the highest Au extraction percentages (92% to 96%) followed by the 
transition samples (71% to 95%) and then the sulphide samples (24% to 51%). 
 
The overall cumulative extractions for the gravity/leach program may be calculated for 
estimation purposes. After combining the Au extracted in the gravity stage and the Au extracted 
in the leach stage, the overall cumulative extractions ranged from 56% to 96%. This, however, 
presumes that all of the Au contained in the gravity concentrate would be extracted through 
further processing. 
 
The overall extraction results are summarized in Table 1.1. For comparison purposes, the 
average head assays, CIL calculated head grades and GRG calculated head grades are presented 
in Table 1.2.

1.7 2012 P&E RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
The Mineral Resources of five Karma Project Deposits named Kao, Goulagou I, Goulagou II 
Rambo and Nami were updated in compliance with NI 43-101 and CIM standards. These 
resource estimates were undertaken by Eugene Puritch, P.Eng. and Antoine Yassa, P.Geo. of 
P&E Mining Consultants Inc. of Brampton Ontario. The effective date of these resource 
estimates is January 1, 2012. 
 
The Karma Project Resource Estimates were derived from applying Au cut-off grades to the 
block model and reporting the resulting tonnes and grade for potentially mineable areas. The 
tonnage of any known artisanal workings was removed from the resource estimates. The Au cut-
off grade calculations for resource reporting of the open pit potentially economic portions of the 
mineralization were derived from operating costs for projects similar to the Karma Project.  
 
The five Karma Project open pit resource models were further investigated with Whittle pit 
optimizations to ensure a reasonable stripping ratio was applied and a reasonable assumption of 
potential economic extraction could be made. The resource "in-pit"  estimate  is  presented  in  Table 
1.3 and the global mineralization estimate in Table 1.4.

Notes: 
1.) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate 

of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
political, marketing, or other relevant issues. 

2.) The quantity and grade of reported inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there 
has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral 
resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured 
mineral resource category. 

3.) The mineral resources in this report were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared 
by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council.

1.8 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY 
 
Riverstone   retained   the   services   of   the   Bureau   d'Etudes   des   Geosciences,   des   Energies   et   de  
l'Environnement,   ("BEGE")   a   local  Burkina Faso environmental consultancy company, for an 
Environmental Study of the area within the Karma Project. The study was completed by BEGE 
in December 2011 and covered: 
 

 The initial status of air quality, groundwater, ecology, soil and land use and the 
social and economic characterization; 

 The identification and analysis of the Karma Project impacts and the estimation of 
the global compensation costs related to these impacts.  

 
A summary of the findings of the study stated that: 
 

 Riverstone   adheres   to   the   norms   and   policies   of   the   "SFI"   a   subsidiary of the 
World Bank;  

 The area located some 20 km east of the town of Ouahigouya, is sparsely 
populated with habitation centered in several small villages throughout the Karma 
Project area; 

 Subsistence farming and cattle grazing appear to be the main industry, although 
artisanal mining is reported at several locations, mostly situated along the known 
outcrops of the various mineralized zones;  

 Riverstone has established a community relations program and has maintained 
good relations with local inhabitants and with influent people who have control on 
the artisanal miners, including the fair treatment of these miners if their relocation 
to another mining area is required, and compensation for crops in new mining 
areas;  

 Artisanal  miners  ("orpailleurs")  are both local villagers and itinerants who tend to 
move throughout West Africa in search of rich near surface Au deposits. The 
majority of orpailleurs within the Karma Project area are outsiders with no roots 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. xii

in the community. They understand most of their activities are illegal and are 
prepared to move and have moved when Riverstone has requested access; 

 In 2010, Riverstone moved a considerable number of artisanal operators at the 
Nami and Rambo Main Deposits for safety reasons in order to facilitate the in-fill 
drilling program. The moves were completed without any problem;  

 The area covered by the resource estimate does not contain any legal human 
settlement and is mainly used for cattle grazing and farming of annual crops, such 
as maize, and millet. This includes the other areas of possible economic interest, 
which are also free from legal human settlement; 

 Throughout  the  local  community,  Riverstone's  Karma  Project  is  well  known  and  
supported. Both community and local leadership look forward to employment 
creation and the increase of commercial activity in the area. 

 
1.9 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The resource estimates as declared in this Technical Report have demonstrated an increase of 
42% or approximately 800,000 oz Au for the global mineral inventory compared to the resource 
estimate as set out in the April 2011 Technical Report. The current estimates were completed on 
the Goulagou I, Goulagou II, Kao, Rambo and Nami Deposits, which are all in close proximity 
to each other. 
 
The resources are contained within five Whittle open pit shells. The following highlights of the 
2012 resource estimates for the Karma Project are as follows: 
 

 Global Mineral Inventory (inside and outside of Whittle pit shells) consists of an 
Indicated Resource totalling 1,773,000 ounces of Au in 54.1 Mt at an average 
grade of 1.02 g/t Au and an Inferred Resource totalling 959,000 ounces of Au in 
37.4 Mt at an average grade of 0.8 g/t Au; 

 A significant portion of the Au resources are at shallows depth (less than 200 m 
vertical depth) and over 80% of the global mineral inventory is contained with the 
five Whittle pit shells; 

 Total Indicated Au resources within the five Whittle pits are 1,634,000 ounces of 
Au in 47.34 Mt at an average grade of 1.07 g/t Au;  

 Total Inferred Au resources within the five Whittle pits are 566,000 ounces of Au 
in 18.93 Mt at an average grade of 0.93 g/t Au;  

 74% of the resources within the Whittle pit shells are classified as Indicated Au 
resources.  

 Mineralization remains open at depth and along strike in at least one direction for 
all deposits.  

 
It   is   recommended   that  Riverstone  proceed  with  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment   ("PEA")  
on the Karma Project. Drilling is currently on-going with four drills at the Property, with the goal 
of converting the Inferred Resources to Indicated, and to determine along strike and at depth 
extensions of the deposits.  
 
The PEA can be based on Measured, Indicated, or Inferred Mineral Resources, or a combination 
of any of these. The PEA should include disclosure of forecast mine production rates that might 
contain capital costs to develop and sustain the mining operation, operating costs, and projected 
cash flows. 
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. xiii  
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

The budget for the necessary drilling and the completion of the PEA is estimated at $US 15 
million. This involves drilling subsequent to that included in the present resource estimate, and to 
the estimated completion date of the PEA. Of the total, approximately $US 8 million has already 
been spent, leaving about $US 7 million to be spent to the completion of the PEA.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, PHYSIOGRAPHY &
 INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
5.1 ACCESSIBILITY 
 
The Karma Project lies on the African continent, in north-central Burkina Faso, near the town of 
Ouahigouya, approximately 185 km north-west of the capital city, Ouagadougou and is 
accessible from Ouagadougou via paved National Route 2 (N2), for approximately 185 km to the 
city of Ouahigouya, and thereafter via unpaved roads for another 20 km. 
 
The capital city of Ouagadougou is connected to Europe (daily flights with Air France, twice 
weekly with Air Burkina to Paris, three times per week to Brussels with Brussels Airlines), East 
Africa (twice weekly with Kenya Airways to Nairobi and Ethiopian Airways to Addis Ababa) 
and frequent flights within the West African region. 
 
5.2 CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
5.2.1 Climate 
 
Burkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, 
the country receives between 600 and 900 millimeters (23.6 and 35.4 inches) of rainfall; in the 
dry season, there is a hot, dry wind from the Sahara, called the harmattan.  
 
The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the 
north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the 
Sudan-Guinea. The Sahel in the north typically receives less than 600 mm (23.6 in) of rainfall 
per year and has high temperatures, 25–47 degrees C.  
 
A relatively dry tropical savannah, the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from 
the Horn of Africa to the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the Sahara to its north and the fertile 
region of the Sudan to the South. Situated between 11°3' and 13°5' north latitude, the Sudan-
Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, 
the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than 900 mm (35.4 in) of rain each year and has cooler 
average temperatures. 
 
5.2.2 Local Resources 
 
The town of Ouahigouya is the main regional centre, with basic supplies and infrastructure for 
exploration and mining. Small villages are present in all the concession areas. The principal 
activity near the villages is agrarian; herding livestock (goats, sheep and cattle) and growing 
millet. The larger city of Ouagadougou has most of the services necessary for mining and 
exploration, including certified analytical laboratories.  
 
Burkina Faso's natural resources include manganese, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt 
and Au. 
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 10 of 167 
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

5.2.3 Physiography 
 
The topography is dominated by very subdued terrain. Low rolling plateaus are cut by weakly 
incised drainage channels. Major features are long ridges capped by hard iron-rich laterite 
("cuirasse"). Vegetation is scrub woodland and savannah grassland. 
 
Water is in relatively short supply, but for drilling purposes can be obtained from seasonal 
reservoirs or from wells.

6.0 HISTORY AND PREVIOUS EXPLORATION  
 
6.1 HISTORY 
 
This account of the history of the Karma Project is presented in the April 2011 Technical Report 
authored by Peatfield and Zbeetnoff, and is reproduced here for completeness. 
 
The Karma Project began with the acquisition of the Rambo concession in 2003. This was the 
Company's  first  project  in  Burkina  Faso,  and  was  acquired  on  the  basis  of  examination  of  data  
from earlier work on   the   Rambo   Main   deposit   by   Incanore   Gold   Mines   Ltd.   ("Incanore"),  
including a substantial drilling program in 1997. Subsequently, the Kao concession was acquired 
by the Company in 2004, and a regional exploration program initiated. Following this, the 
Goulagou, Youba and Rounga concessions were optioned from Golden Star Resources Ltd. 
("Golden  Star")  by  way  of  an  "Option  to  Purchase"  agreement  (the  "Goulagou  Agreement")  in  
2007. Finally, the Tougou concession was optioned from Golden Star in 2011, by inclusion in 
the Goulagou Agreement. Subsequently, Riverstone exercised its option under the Goulagou 
Agreement in early 2012 and acquired its 90% interest in the Goulagou, Youba, Rounga and 
Tougou concessions. 
 
6.2 RAMBO MAIN DEPOSIT 
 
During 1997, Incanore drilled several core holes on the Rambo Main zone, centered on an 
artisanal  mining  site  (the  "Rambo  Pit"). Subsequent work has shown that the holes were less than 
optimally oriented, and no clear picture of a mineralized zone emerged from the work. Incanore 
allowed the concession to lapse, and it was acquired by two individuals at that time, who 
optioned it to Riverstone in 2003. Since that time, Riverstone has completed a substantial amount 
of drilling. An initial NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was completed by Arseneau for 
Wardrop and set out in a report titled, Technical Report on the Karma Property, dated June 30, 
2009   (the   "June 2009   Technical   Report")   and   subsequently   updated   in   in   the   April   2011  
Technical Report. These resource estimates are presented in Section 6.6. 
 
6.3 KAO DEPOSIT 
 
Very  minor  work  was  undertaken  by  various  parties   in   the  1980's  and  1990's,  and   the  ground  
was allowed to lapse. Riverstone obtained the concession and commenced work in 2004 with a 
program of widely-spaced soil geochemical sampling and geological mapping. This work lead to 
the discovery of a geochemical anomaly in the north-east sector of the concession, leading in 
turn to a program of tighter spaced soil sampling, in the course of which a large (approximately 
2,000 by 2,000 m) anomaly was defined. This anomaly was tested initially with a reverse air 
blast  drilling  ("RAB")  program,  followed  immediately  by  a  regular  pattern  of  reverse  circulation  
("RC")  drilling. This work led to the discovery of the Kao Deposit. 
 
An initial NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was reported on in the June 2009 Technical 
Report and subsequently updated in in the April 2011 Technical Report. These resource 
estimates are presented in Section 6.6. 
 
Recent core and RC drilling campaigns were completed in 2011 and are detailed in Section 10 of 
this report.  
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 12 of 167 
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

6.4 GOULAGOU DEPOSITS 
 
The history of the Goulagou Deposit has been well summarized in the June 2009 Technical 
Report. In   the   simplest   of   terms,   Channel   Resources   Ltd.   ("Channel")   explored   the   original 
concession between 1994 and 1997, which lead to the discovery of the GGI and GGII Deposits. 
Channel optioned the concession to  Placer  Dome  Inc.  ("Placer"),  who  did  a  modest  program  of  
RC drilling, with the majority of holes on the GGII Deposit. 
 
The concession was then returned to its owner, who subsequently allowed it to lapse. The 
previous owner then acquired a smaller concession, and this was optioned by St. Jude Resources 
Ltd.   ("St.   Jude")   in   2002. From 2002 through 2005, St. Jude undertook major core drilling 
campaigns, mostly on GGII. St. Jude was acquired by Golden Star in late 2005, who did some 
concession-wide exploration before signing the Goulagou Agreement with Riverstone in 2007. 
Riverstone has been active on the concession since that time. 
 
In 2007, SRK Consulting UK Ltd., ("SRK")  prepared a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate 
for the combined GGI and GGII Deposits for Golden Star (Arthur, 2007). In 2009, Wardrop 
updated this Resource Estimate and in 2011 the resources were again updated by Peatfield and 
Zbeetnoff. Results of these resource estimates are presented in Section 6.6. 
 
6.5 NAMI ARTISINAL SITE 
 
The Nami Artisanal Site, now referred to as the Nami Deposit, lies about 4 km north-east of the 
Rambo Main Deposit,  and  came  to  Riverstone's  attention in early 2009. The Nami Deposit site 
grew rapidly from a site with a few tens of people to a village of many thousands, with literally 
hundreds of shallow shafts sunk on Au-bearing quartz veins. Riverstone began serious 
exploration in late 2009, commencing with surface mapping and sampling of material from the 
shafts. This led to programs of RC and core drilling. There have been no previous resource 
estimates for the Nami Deposit.  
 
6.6 PREVIOUS RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
From 2007 to 2011 there were several NI 43-101 compliant Resource Estimates completed for 
various deposits on the Karma Project. The Resource Estimates for 2007 and 2009 are presented 
in Table 6.1. Table 6.2 presents the Resource Estimates from the April 2011 Technical Report.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
The geology of West and Central Africa is dominated by Precambrian shields or cratons of 
Archaean and Lower Proterozoic age, Pan-African mobile zones of Upper Proterozoic age and 
intracratonic sedimentary basins ranging from the Proterozoic to the Quaternary, Figure 7.1.  
 
The Precambrian history of this part of Africa is commonly described as a process of progressive 
accretion of a series of successively younger mobile or orogenic zones or belts to the old crustal 
nuclei of early Archaean age. Occasionally, subsequent orogenic belts developed inside existing 
cratons, but more commonly they added to the size of older cratons by the addition of new 
crustal material along their margins.  
 
Most of the cratonic nuclei in the area under discussion stabilized during the Archaean after the 
accretion of Archaean mobile zones subsequent to earlier orogenic events. The North Gabon 
Archaean nucleus for example stabilized around 2.7 Ga. An exception is the West African 
craton, which stabilized much later at about 1.99 Ga after the accretion of vast areas of Lower 
Proterozoic (or Birimian) formations at the end of the Eburnean orogenic event. This fact has led 
to much confusion as to the use of the word craton in regard to West Africa in recent years.  
 
The Man Craton is considered to be a remnant of a much larger craton that included the present 
day Guyana Craton of South America. This former craton was split by continental breakup in the 
Jurassic and the two segments have since drifted apart.  
 
The Lower Archaean-Proterozoic shields consist essentially of granitic-gneissic terrains and of 
isoclinally folded volcano-sedimentary and sedimentary greenstone belts, which can be of either 
Lower Archaean or Proterozoic age. Both ages of greenstone belts are host to significant 
precious metal, base metal and bulk mineral deposits in Africa and world-wide. Archaean 
greenstone belts exist within the Man Craton and host banded iron formation ("BIF") deposits, 
Archaean mafic cumulate deposits and Mesozoic supergene nickel deposits and so are 
compositionally different from their later equivalents.  
 
The Proterozoic greenstone belts of West Africa are also known as Birimian greenstone belts, 
named after the Birim River Valley in Ghana, where both Au and diamonds occur. They 
encompass a vast area of approximately 350,000 km  covering parts of Niger, Burkina Faso, 
Benin, Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea, Liberia and Sénégal. In general the Birimian 
rocks lie outside of the cratonic Archaean areas and are sometimes thought of as mobile belts. 
  
The Proterozoic Birimian greenstone rocks have undergone orogeny in Eburnean times, which 
dates roughly from 1.99 to 2.19 Ga. The last orogenic event in West and Central Africa was the 
Pan-African of Upper Proterozoic to Lower Paleozoic age (600-450 Ma). This event completed 
the addition of new crustal material to the older shield areas composed of Archaean cratons and 
Proterozoic mobile belts. 
 
The Pan-African also overprinted and partially obliterated older pre-existing sequences of 
Archaean to Proterozoic age. Pan-African mobile belts rim the western margins of the West 
African and Congo shields: Mauritanides, Rokelides and West Congo fold belt. The Pan-African 
belt of Central Africa (also known as the Trans-Saharan mobile belt) occupies a vast area along 
the eastern margin of the West African and the north-western margin of the Congo Craton. This

zone, which is thought to have resulted from the collision between the West African Craton and 
an ill-defined continent to the east, comprises the Adrar des Iforas and Aïr stockworks in Mali 
and Niger and large parts of Benin, Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon. 
 
Figure 7.1 Regional Geology of West Africa 
 

 
 
7.2 PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
 
The Karma Project area is contained within a large, irregularly shaped greenstone belt. Within 
the belt, local areas are underlain by generally intermediate to felsic rocks, as dykes, sills and 
irregular masses, but the majority of the rock units are mixed volcanic and sedimentary units. 
Substantial areas are covered by lateritic units, dominantly gravels and massive shields

(cuirasse). Other areas have extensive aeolian deposits, which make surface exploration such as 
soil geochemistry problematic.  
 
7.3 KAO DEPOSIT 
 
The Kao Deposit, as currently delineated, lies almost completely within an intermediate to felsic 
intrusive rock complex, which is in proximity to the metasediments/metavolcanics, Figure 7.2 
and Figure 7.3. There is no apparent shearing. Gold zones at Kao are very visually distinct, and 
marked by a slight increase in foliation, higher silica, hematite, sericite, carbonate and by pyrite-
arsenopyrite. Higher arsenopyrite and the presence of quartz veining generally means higher 
gold tenor. There is local laterite cover, usually less than three or four m thick. Immediately 
north of the Deposit is an area of deep surficial sediments, which precludes the use of surface 
geochemistry. The Kao Deposit is open along strike to the north and south, and down the shallow 
dip to the east.

7.4 GGI & GGII DEPOSITS 
 
The Goulagou Deposits lie within a steeply oriented shear zone of mixed clastic sedimentary 
rocks, generally argillic siltstone and argillite with local intercalations of graphitic and chloritic 
schist and small irregular intrusive units, generally diorite to granodiorite with some more felsic 
units in places, Figure 7.4 to Figure 7.7. Alteration minerals include silica, hematite, sericite, 
carbonate and pyrite-arsenopyrite. Chert has been reported at GGII. 
 
The GGI Deposit is open to the east and west on strike, and down dip. The GGII Deposit is open 
to the east and west on strike, and down dip.

7.5 RAMBO MAIN DEPOSIT 
 
The Rambo Main Deposit lies in a steeply oriented shear zone, near the contact of mixed 
volcano-sedimentary rocks and a later intermediate to felsic intrusive body, Figure 7.8 and 
Figure 7.9. The mineralized body, however, locally transgresses this contact. Alteration minerals 
include silica, hematite, sericite, carbonate and pyrite-arsenopyrite. The Rambo Deposit contains 
distinct breccia zones, in which the grade increases. Quartz veining and silicification are 
common within the zone of Au mineralization, and the zone is well defined, with relatively sharp 
boundaries. There is some evidence of likely later cross-cutting mineralized structures, but these 
have not yet been fully delineated. The Rambo Deposit is open along strike to the east and down 
dip.

7.6 NAMI DEPOSIT 
 
This description of the Nami deposit is taken from the SRK structural report. 
 
The Nami Deposit is located entirely within a granodiorite, which contains a penetrative S1 
foliation, Figure 7.10 and Figure 7.11. This foliation can be completely transposed by later 
deformation. Sulphides arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and pyrite are spatially associated with S2 
shear zones. Breccias of granodiorite (and more rarely meta-sedimentary rocks) are observed in 
areas of adjacent well developed S2 strain, and north striking fractures are observed as a 
dominant fracture trend in the breccias. Breccia textures range from crackle breccia to mosaic 
breccias with minimal clast rotation, to full transported breccias with finer grained matrix. The 
breccias are typically strongly silicified. The Nami Deposit remains open to the west, north and 
south.

7.7 MINERALIZATION 
 
7.7.1 Kao Mineralization 
 
The Kao Deposit as presently known extends about 900 m north-south and 1,000 m down-dip to 
the east. It is open to the north and south, and down dip to the east. There are as many as eight 
parallel, shallowly dipping sheets, ranging from 3 to 50 m thick. Most of the sheets are 
continuous from their westward extent where they reach surface to the edge of the presently 
delineated deposit to the east. Figure 7.2 is a typical cross section and Figure 7.3 shows the 
layout of drilling to date and the general outline of the surface projection of the Kao Deposit as 
presently known.  
 
7.7.2 GGI & GGII Deposits Mineralization 
 
The GGI Deposit shows continuous elongate lenses of mineralized rock over a presently defined 
strike length of 2,000 m, and is open in both directions on strike, and down dip. It consists of up 
to 10 separate continuous sheets, ranging from 5 to 40 m thick, dipping vertically plus or minus a 
few degrees. The deposit is open below the level of present drilling, which is generally to about 
150 m vertical. Figure 7.6 shows the general outline of the GGI Deposit with the drilling 
completed to date.  
 
GGII is similar, over a strike length of 2,400 m and open in both directions and down dip. Here 
there are 3 to 5 sheets, again steeply dipping, with widths ranging from 5 to 30 m. The Deposit is 
open below about 150 m, and contains some higher grade shoots that plunge steeply and are 
targets for deeper drilling. The central portion of the Deposit   is   thickened   in   a   "Z"   fold  
configuration. Figure 7.7 shows the general outline of the GGII Deposit with the drilling 
completed to date.  
 
 
7.7.3 Rambo Main Deposit Mineralization 
 
The Rambo Main Deposit as presently known is a small mineralized lens containing a steeply 
plunging shoot. The strike length of the Deposit is approximately 400 m, with a down-plunge 
extension of 230 m, and a thickness of the mineralized zone ranging from about 2.5 to 25 m. The 
shoot is open to the east and down dip, and within it the mineralization exhibits good continuity. 
The full lateral extent of the Rambo Main Deposit has not yet been delineated. Smaller Hanging 
wall and Footwall zones are present and account for approximately half the volume of the total 
modeled mineralization. Figure 7.9 shows the Rambo Deposit drill plan. 
 
7.7.4 Nami Deposit Mineralization 
 
The Nami Deposit is presently composed of 2 to 3 small mineralized lenses with shallow dips of 
20 to 25° toward the west-south-west. The strike of the Nami Deposit is about 550 m, with a 
down-plunge extension of 225 m, and a thickness of the mineralized zone ranging from about 2.5 
to 30 m. The shoot is open to the west, north and south, and within it the mineralization exhibits 
good continuity. Figure 7.11 presents the Nami Deposit drill plan. 
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 27 of 167 
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

In February 2011, SRK conducted a site visit to the Karma Property with the specific mandate to 
review the oriented drill core at the Nami Deposit and formulate a model to explain: 
 

 The geological history of structural deformation recorded in the rocks, integrated 
with the known regional tectonics;  

 Possible Au mineralizing events; and  
 The controlling structural geometries on the mineralization. 

 
SRK conducted the site visit and core logging. All observations, interpretations and 
recommendations were provided in a report in fulfillment of the scope of work.  
 
SRK concluded that Au mineralization at the Nami Deposit is associated with a shallow 
southwest-dipping D1b zone of brecciation and silicification. Further Au mineralization is 
spatially located within the cross-cutting, southwest-striking D2 brittle-ductile shear zones and 
associated breccias. Three dimensional wireframe geometries were constructed to aid with drill 
targeting. The Nami Deposit is still considered open, and possible drilling target areas were 
suggested in the report that could increase the extents of known Au mineralization.  
 
7.8 PETROGRAPHIC STUDY 
 
In September 2011, a petrographic examination and report was mandated to P.C. Le Couteur, 
("Le   Couteur") of Micron Geological Ltd. The main objective of the examination was to 
determine the occurrence of Au, i.e as native Au, in other Au-bearing minerals, or as inclusions 
or substitution in pyrite or arsenopyrite, or some combination of all of these. A previous 
mineralogical study had been completed earlier in 2011, however samples were from the Rambo 
Deposit only. Results of the previous study were presented in the NI 43-101 Technical Report 
authored by Dr. Giles R. Peatfield, Ph.D., P.Eng. and John A. Zbeetnoff, P.Geo. titled, 
"Technical  Report  on  the  Karma  Project,  Burkina  Faso,  West  Africa"  dated April 14, 2011 (the 
"April  2011  Technical  Report"). 
 
G.R Peatfield, a consultant to Riverstone, selected 35 potential samples from four Au-bearing 
zones, with instructions to the field geologists to take quarter core samples 8 to 10 cm long that 
had a high content of sulphides, preferably both disseminated and in veinlets, and including 
pyrite and arsenopyrite if possible. Of the 35 samples selected, only 30 were available. The list 
deliberately included alternative samples from similar intervals in case one was not available and 
to avoid duplication Le Couteur therefore selected only 15 of the 30 samples.  
 
Five sample were selected from Kao, five from GGII, one from Rambo and four from GGI.  
 
The principal purpose of the petrographic study was to locate Au, however it was noted only in 
samples 2 (GGI) and 15 (Rambo). 
 
In sample 2 native Au was observed in dolomite and quartz, and as an inclusion in pyrite. In 
sample 15 Au was encountered in albite-quartz-muscovite-dolomite. Au grains ranged in size 
from a low of 5 microns to a high of 53 microns. In the five Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyzer 
("EDX")  analyses   run  on   the  Au grains, purity ranged from pure (100%) Au, to between 86% 
and 91% Au, with the remainder being Ag.  
 
Rock types that host the Au mineralization in the four zones include fine-grained sediments and 
medium-grained feldspathic intrusives, although the identification of some of the latter is

tentative in many cases since the deformation, metamorphism, replacement and veining that have 
affected all samples obscure the original textures to a greater or lesser extent. 
 
The following sections describing the mineralogy of each deposit were derived from two reports, 
2011a and 2011b completed by Kappes, Cassiday and Associates,  ("KCA").  These  sections  are  
reproduced from the April 2011 Technical Report.  
 
7.8.1 Kao Deposit Mineralogy 
 
The information available to date for the Kao Deposit suggests that the dominant sulphide 
species are arsenopyrite and pyrite, both disseminated and on fractures. Visible Au has been 
noted in RC chips, but is not common. There is some quartz veining noted in core drilling.  
 
7.8.2 Rambo Main Mineralogy 
 
The KCA report (2011a) described the mineralogy of three composite samples taken for 
metallurgical testing. The minerals of interest include free Au, arsenopyrite, pyrite, and minor 
amounts of covellite and chalcopyrite, with traces of bornite, chalcocite and sphalerite. Au 
occurs dominantly as free grains ranging in size from 15 to 300 microns, with an average Ag 
content of about 20 percent. The Au grains studied are fine, with in excess of 90 percent being 
less than 50 microns. A small percentage of the Au grains are attached to or within sulphide or 
gangue grains. Gangue minerals of interest include clays, feldspars, quartz, dolomite, and 
hematite and goethite in the oxide and transition material. There is some carbon, at least a 
portion of which is organic. 
 
7.8.3 GGI & GGII Deposits Mineralogy 
 
The KCA report (2011b) described the mineralogy of three samples of material derived from 
diamond drill core from the GGII Deposit. The minerals of interest include free Au, pyrite, 
arsenopyrite, and minor amounts of chalcopyrite and covellite, with traces of bornite and 
chalcocite. Au occurs dominantly as small grains tied to silicate or sulphide grains; Au grains are 
generally less than 35 microns in size, with a very low (about 1.5 weight percent) Ag content. 
The proportion of free Au grains in the oxide material is about 19 percent; the proportions are 
very much lower in the transition and sulphide material. Gangue minerals of interest include 
clay, feldspar, quartz, dolomite, and hematite and goethite in the oxide and transition material. 
There is some carbon.  
 
7.8.4 Nami Deposit Mineralogy 
 
There is no detailed information available regarding mineralogy in the Nami Deposit. Data from 
drill logs and field observations suggest that the mineralization is very similar to that at other 
deposits in the Karma Project area. Of interest is the fact that there is a greater tendency toward 
discrete quartz veining, and visible free Au is common in material derived from the artisanal 
shafts. Free Au has been observed in quartz veins in core drilling. Tourmaline is common in 
quartz veins, and there are numerous references to graphite stringers.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
  
Generally speaking, the deposits of the Karma Project are typical shear-zone hosted Au-bearing 
zones, with generally steep dips and elongate, braided character. The zones tend to pinch and 
swell,   and   locally   contain  higher   grade  "shoots"  with   steep  plunges. The deposits as such, are 
within   the   class   of   deposits   known   as   "Orogenic"  Au, also previously referred to as quartz-
carbonate vein Au.  
 
The classification of Au deposits as proposed by Francois Robert in 1997 was updated in 2007 
by Robert et al. for the Fifth Decennial International Conference on Mineral Exploration. The 
following section is the description for Orogenic Deposits taken from this paper. 
 
Orogenic deposits include Greenstone, and Turbidite & BIF deposits, and the term orogenic is 
restricted to deposits composed of quartz-carbonate veins and associated wall rock replacement, 
associated with compressional or transpressional geological structures such as reverse faults and 
folds. Three main types of orogenic deposits are distinguished based on their host-rock 
environment: greenstone-hosted, turbidite-hosted, and BIF-hosted. 
 
The three types of orogenic deposits share a number of additional characteristics. They consist of 
variably complex arrays of quartz-carbonate veins that display significant vertical continuity, 
commonly in excess of 1 km, without any significant vertical zoning. The ores are enriched in 
Ag-As+/-W and have Au:Ag ratios >5. Other commonly enriched elements include B, Te, Bi, 
and Mo. The dominant sulphide mineral is pyrite at greenschist grade and pyrrhotite at 
amphibolite grade. Arsenopyrite is the dominant sulphide in many clastic-sediment-hosted ores 
at greenschist grade and loellingite (FeAs2) is also present at amphibolite grade. Orebodies are 
surrounded by carbonate-sericite-pyrite alteration halos that are variably developed depending on 
host rock composition. At the regional scale a majority of deposits are spatially associated with 
regional shear zones and occur in greenschist-grade rocks, consistent with the overall brittle-
ductile nature of their host structures. 
 
8.1 GREENSTONE-HOSTED DEPOSITS 
 
Greenstone-hosted orogenic deposits are the most important of the clan and the best represented 
type among the >10 Moz deposits. The quartz-carbonate veins in these deposits typically 
combine laminated veins in moderately to steeply dipping reverse shear zones with arrays of 
shallow-dipping extensional veins in adjacent competent and lower strain rocks. The reverse 
character of the shear-zone hosted veins and shallow-dips of extensional veins attest to their 
formation during crustal shortening (Sibson et al., 1988; Robert and Poulsen 2001). 
 
In greenstone belts the significant vein deposits are typically distributed along specific regional 
compressional to transpressional structures. By virtue of their association with regional 
structures, these camps are also located at the boundaries between contrasted lithologic or age 
domains within the belt. Along these structures, the deposits commonly cluster in specific camps, 
localized at bends or major splay intersections, and where deposits typically occur in associated 
higher-order structures (Goldfarb et al., 2005; Robert et al., 2005). The larger camps and deposits 
are commonly spatially associated with conglomeratic sequences as exemplified by the 
Timiskaming polymict conglomerates in the Abitibi greenstone belt and the Tarkwaian quartz 
pebble conglomerates in the Birimian shield. These deposits occur in any type of supracrustal 
rocks within a greenstone belt and covering stratigraphic positions from lower mafic-ultramafic 
volcanic to upper clastic sedimentary stratigraphic levels.  



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 30 of 167 
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

 
At the local scale, favourable settings for these deposits represent a combination of structural and 
lithologic factors (Groves et al., 1990; Robert, 2004b). Favourable structural settings are linked 
mainly to rheologic heterogeneities in the host sequences. Shear zones and faults, universally 
present in these deposits, are developed along lithologic contacts between units of contrasting 
competencies and along thin incompetent lithologic units. Along these contacts and along 
incompetent rocks, deposits will preferentially develop at bends, and structural intersections. 
Competent rock units enclosed in less competent favour fracturing and veining. Common 
lithologic associations include Fe-rich rocks such as tholeiitic basalts, differentiated dolerite sills 
and  BIF's,  and  with  competent  porphyry  stocks  of   intermediate   to   felsic composition, whether 
they intrude mafic-ultramafic volcanic or clastic sedimentary rocks.

10.0 DRILLING 
 
The April 2011 Technical Report details all drilling up to and including part of 2011. Since the 
release of that technical report, 293 holes have been completed for a total of 46,669 m. These 
totals include all drilling for which assays were available at the time that the resource models 
were constructed. Approximately 41,000 m of the total involved drilling for which the results 
were included in the models; the additional drilling was on peripheral zones not yet well enough 
defined to be modelled for resource estimation.  
 
The breakdown of drill holes per deposit is presented in Table 10.1, (the Rambo Deposit has not 
been drilled since the previous resource estimate). Results of the 2010 and 2011 drilling are 
presented by zone in Appendix-VIII.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
Sampling on the Karma Project to date involves either RC chips or diamond drill core. The 
following   sections   detail   the   Company's   drilling   procedures, which were implemented in 
2009 and continued throughout the latest round of drilling in 2011. 
 
For the RC drilling, the drilling was and continues to be dominantly dry, although some holes do 
reach the water table. Samples are collected at the drill stem, using a splitter device, directly into 
numbered sample bags for shipment to the laboratory. A small representative sample of coarser 
chips is collected, washed, logged and archived in a plastic chip tray with a receptacle for each 
two metre interval. "Rig duplicate"   samples   are collected at regular intervals. All samples are 
analysed. Rig reject samples are collected for each one metre interval and archived for further 
sampling or other test work.  
 
In the case of diamond drilling, core recovered is HQ size (63.5 millimetres nominal diameter) in 
the upper saprolitic material, reducing to NQ size (47.6 millimetres nominal diameter) in the 
harder rock at depth. Core is placed in metal boxes and transported to the logging facility. Once 
there, it is photographed,  logged  for  rock  quality  ("RQD")  and  various  structural  parameters,  and  
for lithologies and evidence of mineralization, and marked for sampling. It is then cut with a 
diamond saw. At   regular   intervals   (generally   every   80   regular   samples)   a   "core   duplicate"   is  
collected by sacrificing the second half of the core. Holes are surveyed on completion using an 
electronic down-hole surveying device. All drill core is routinely sampled and assayed. 
 
All in-field sample handling and treatment is by local individuals employed by Riverstone. 
Following splitting (or sawing), bagging and numbering, samples are delivered to the ALS 
Minerals,  ("ALS")  laboratory  in  Ouagadougou  by  Company  personnel. 
 
A comprehensive   Quality   Assurance/Quality   Control,   ("QA/QC"   or   "QC")   program   was  
established for the Karma Project. The program was designed and has been overseen by G. R. 
Peatfield, P.Eng. Appropriate standards (purchased from CDN Resource Laboratories) and 
coarse blanks are inserted into the assay stream at regular intervals. Rig, reject and assay 
duplicate samples are submitted at regular intervals. The results of the controls are monitored by 
Peatfield on a regular basis, before assays are entered into the master assay databases. 
 
Samples for the Project were and continue to be prepared by ALS in Ouagadougou and assayed 
for Au at their facility there. ALS is an international firm, ISO 9001: 2000 registered in North 
America. Assaying for Au is by fire assay/atomic absorption   ("FA/AA"),   and   for   all   samples  
grading in excess of 1 gram Au per   tonne,   by   fire   assay  with   gravimetric   finish   ("FA/grav.")  
Gravimetric assay values are used in preference to FA/AA numbers.  
 
In  P&E's  opinion,  the  procedures  adopted  by  the  Company for sample handling and preparation, 
security and analyses are appropriate for the Karma Project.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
12.1 SITE VISIT AND INDEPENDENT SAMPLING 
 
Mr. Antoine Yassa, P.Geo., visited the Karma Project from October 31 to November 3, 2011 for 
the purpose of doing the site visit and completing an independent verification sampling program. 
Twelve diamond drill core samples were collected from six diamond drill holes by taking a 
quarter split of the half core remaining in the box. Thirty-three samples were collected from the 
coarse rejects of 11 RC holes. An effort was made to sample a range of grades.  
 
At no time were any employees of Riverstone advised as to the identification of the samples to 
be chosen during the visit.  
 
The samples were selected by Mr. Yassa, and placed into sample bags, which were sealed with 
tape and placed in a larger bag with a serial marked tie-wrap.  
 
The samples were brought by Mr. Yassa to ALS in Ouagadougou for preparation and from there 
the pulps were sent by ALS to their Vancouver, BC, Canada laboratory for analysis. 
 
ALS has developed and implemented at each of its locations a Quality Management System 
("QMS")  designed  to  ensure  the  production  of  consistently  reliable  data.  The  system  covers  all  
laboratory activities and takes into consideration the requirements of ISO standards. 
 
ALS maintains ISO registrations and accreditations. ISO registration and accreditation provides 
independent verification that a QMS is in operation at the location in question. Most ALS 
laboratories are registered or are pending registration to ISO 9001:2008, and a number of 
analytical facilities have received ISO 17025 accreditations for specific laboratory procedures. 
 
Samples were analysed for Au using lead-collection fire assay with an AAS finish. 
 
A comparison of the results is presented in Figure 12.1 and Figure 12.2.

drilling in 2011. Descriptions of the procedures are drawn heavily upon the previous Technical 
Report. 
 
Quality control monitoring during 2011 continued from the program that was implemented in 
2009 and carried out through 2010. The QC program involved routine insertion of standard and 
blank samples, as well as assaying of regularly selected: core (or RC rig) and preparation 
duplicates. Every eleventh sample position represented a control sample of some type, in a 
regular rotation. Details of this rotation have varied over time, but in essence this is the protocol 
followed.  
 
No effort was made to "randomize"   the   insertion  of  controls,  on   the  dual  argument   that   this   is  
likely to lead to confusion in the sampling procedure, and that the chosen insertion technique is 
in fact random relative to the sampled population. P&E agrees with this philosophy.  
 
Standard samples were purchased from CDN Resource Laboratories and inserted by Riverstone 
personnel in the field. Several standards of varying expected grades were employed in the course 
of the program. In general, standards included those with several grades, including one near or 
slightly above a possible cut-off grade, one at the expected resource grade, and two at higher 
grades to check the performance of the laboratory on outliers. 
 
Standards assays by FA/AA were plotted on charts as the assay reports were received, and any 
values that fell outside the accepted values were flagged for further examination. In the case of 
assays in excess of 1,000 ppb (or previously 5,000 ppb), the FA/gravimetric results are plotted on 
a second chart. These are then compared to the FA/AA results.  
 
12.2.1 Performance of Certified Reference Materials 
 
P&E reviewed the results for all five deposits for both core and RC drilling. There were a minor 
number of misallocations; i.e. the incorrect standard was inserted. In the case of the relatively 
few standard assays falling outside the accepted limits, they were examined on a case by case 
basis. Nothing was deemed to have any impact on the resource estimates. 
 
The overall passing rate of the certified reference materials was 95%. 
 
12.2.2 Performance of ½ Core and Coarse Reject Duplicates  
 
Duplicate assays were plotted on X-Y correlation plots by the Company as reports were 
received. There are three kinds of duplicates; rig duplicates and preparation duplicates are 
inserted by the Company; assay duplicates are performed by the laboratory on a random basis. 
 
In general, the results of this work are satisfactory, with the precision increasing as one would 
expect through the process. There is little evidence of bias, and the correlation coefficients are 
generally high – in the case of assay duplicates often reaching in excess of 99%. Rig duplicates 
demonstrate less precision, which is expected, and completely normal due to the inherent 
geologic variability and relatively large grain size (i.e. inhomogeneity).  
 
12.2.3 Performance of Blank Material 
 
Coarse   "blank"   material   is   inserted   into   the   sample   stream   on   a   regular   basis. Results were 
examined  for   the  two  types  of  drilling  for  all  deposits.  Apart  from  the  occasional  "high"  value  



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 37 of 167 
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

generally between 25 and 40 ppb Au, results were at or below detection limit. There was one 
rogue value at 120 ppb Au. None of these high values has any impact on the resource database. 
 
P&E declares the data acquired and analyzed by Riverstone to be satisfactory for use in a 
resource estimate.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
The following sections are excerpts from the metallurgical test work reports for the work 
completed after the April 2011 Technical Report. All previous metallurgical testing is discussed 
in the April 2011 Technical Report.  
 
13.1 SUMMARY OF METALLURGICAL TEST WORK 
 
On April 20, 2011 the laboratory facility at KCA received nine (9) plastic drums containing RC 
drill cuttings and split core from the Karma Project. The samples were prepared and utilized for 
metallurgical test work including rock density, cyanide leach and gravity concentration testing. 
 
13.1.1 Sample Receipt and Preparation 
 
The received material consisted of thirty-seven (37) individually numbered bags of material, 
described by zone in the provided documentation as GOULAGOU I (GGI), GOULAGOU II 
(GGII) and Kao. Each zone contained three (3) material types: oxide, transition and sulphide, as 
described in the documentation. Upon receipt, the samples were logged and assigned unique 
sample numbers. Portions of the individual samples were combined to generate Master 
composite samples to represent each type of material in each zone. 
 
13.1.2 Rock Density, Comminution and Head Analyses 
 
Prior to crushing the split core samples, suitable specimens were selected and utilized for rock 
density testing. The rock densities of the suitable samples ranged from 1.82 to 2.80 grams per 
cubic centimeter with an overall average of 2.45. 
 
Portions of the Master composites were submitted to Phillips Enterprises, Inc. for Bond Ball Mill 
Work index testing. 
 
Portions from the Master composites as well as select individual samples were assayed for Au 
and silver contents. The samples were also assayed semi-quantitatively for arsenic, copper and 
iron and quantitatively for carbon and sulphur. 
 
13.1.3 Bottle Roll Leach Test Work 
 
Portions of the Master composites as well as portions from select individual samples were 
utilized  for  carbon  in  leach  ("CIL")  bottle  roll  tests  at  a  target  grind  size  of  80%  passing  0.075  
millimeters. The samples  were  leached  in  the  presence  of  granular  activated  carbon  ("GAC"). 
 
In the leach tests, the Au extractions ranged from 13% to 98% with an average of 66% based on 
calculated heads, which ranged from 0.339 to 3.906 grams of Au per metric tonne with an 
average of 1.206. Sodium cyanide consumptions ranged from 1.24 to 2.77 kilograms per metric 
tonne and hydrated lime additions ranged from 1.00 to 4.50 kilograms per metric tonne. The 
results of the CIL tests are summarized in Table 13.1. 
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 39 of 167 
Riverstone Resources Inc. Karma Project Report No. 233 

13.1.4 Gravity Test Work 
 
A total of nine (9) Knelson gravity concentration tests were conducted utilizing the nine (9) 
Master composite samples. For each gravity recoverable Au ("GRG")  test, a 10 kilogram portion 
of material was subjected to three (3) sequential liberation and gravity recovery stages. 
 
In the nine (9) GRG tests between 5.7% and 42.3% of the Au was collected in the concentrate 
and middlings portions over the three (3) stages with weight pulls of 1.9% to 2.8% of the original 
sample weight. 
 
A portion of the tailings from each GRG test was utilized for a CIL bottle roll test. The Au 
extractions from the leach tests on the GRG tails ranged from 24% to 96% with an average of 
72% based on calculated head grades (GRG tail grades) ranging from 0.529 to 2.145 grams of 
Au per metric tonne with an average of 0.947. The sodium cyanide consumptions ranged from 
1.28 to 2.83 kilograms per metric tonne. 
 
The results of the GRG and tail leach tests are summarized in Table 13.2 and Table 13.3, 
respectively.

13.2 DISCUSSION 
 
The CIL bottle roll tests on the portions of head material indicated that the oxide material 
leached most readily with Au extractions ranging from 87% to 98%. The transition material Au 
extractions ranged from 70% to 94%. The sulphide samples were the least amenable to cyanide 
leaching, extracting only 13% to 38% of the Au. 
 
In the GRG testing, the oxide samples extracted the least to the concentrates, 5.7% to 11.7% of 
the Au. Likewise, the transition samples showed low overall Au extractions, 10.6% to 16.0%. 
The sulphide samples showed notable improvement over the oxide and transition samples though 
still not exceptional performance, extracting 29.1% to 42.3% of the Au to the concentrates. 
 
The leach tests on the GRG tails followed the same trend as the leach tests on the head material, 
oxide samples showing the highest Au extraction percentages (92% to 96%) followed by the 
transition samples (71% to 95%) and then the sulphide samples (24% to 51%). 
 
The overall cumulative extractions for the gravity/leach program may be calculated for 
estimation purposes. After combining the Au extracted in the gravity stage and the Au extracted 
in the leach stage, the overall cumulative extractions ranged from 56% to 96%. This, however, 
presumes that all of the Au contained in the gravity concentrate would be extracted through 
further processing. 
 
The overall extraction results are summarized in Table 13.4. For comparison purposes, the 
average head assays, CIL calculated head grades and GRG calculated head grades are presented 
in Table 13.5.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
The purpose of this section of the Technical Report is to update the Mineral Resources of five 
Karma Project deposits named Kao, Goulagou I, Goulagou II, Rambo and Nami. 
 
All resources herein are in compliance with NI 43-101 and CIM standards. These resource 
estimates were undertaken by Eugene Puritch, P.Eng. and Antoine Yassa, P.Geo. of P&E Mining 
Consultants Inc. of Brampton Ontario. The effective date of these resource estimates is January 
1, 2012. 
 
14.1 DATABASES 
 
All drilling data were provided by Riverstone in the form of Excel or text file databases. The 
following Table 14.1 summarizes data for drillholes and vertical cross-sections utilized in the 
resource estimates

14.3 DOMAIN INTERPRETATION 
 
The five Karma Project deposit domain boundaries were determined from lithology, structure 
and grade boundary interpretation from visual inspection of drill hole sections. These domains 
were created with computer screen digitizing on drill hole sections in Gemcom by the authors of 
this Section. The outlines were influenced by the selection of mineralized material above 0.3 g/t 
Au that demonstrated a lithological and structural zonal continuity along strike and down dip. In 
some cases mineralization below 0.3 g/t Au was included for the purpose of maintaining zonal 
continuity. Smoothing was utilized to remove obvious jogs and dips in the domains and 
incorporated a minor addition of Inferred mineralization. This exercise allowed for easier domain 
creation without triangulation errors from solids validation. 
 
On each section, polyline interpretations were digitized from drill hole to drill hole but not 
typically extended more than 50 m into untested territory. Minimum constrained true width for 
interpretation was 2 m.   The   interpreted   polylines   from   each   section   were   "wireframed"   in  
Gemcom into 3-dimensional domains. The resulting solids (domains) were used for statistical 
analysis, grade interpolation, rock coding and resource reporting purposes. See Appendix-II. 
 
14.3.1 Rock Code Determination 
 
The rock codes used for the five resource models were derived from the mineralized domain 
solid names. The list of rock codes used is as follows:

14.3.2 Composites 
 
Length weighted composites were generated for the drill hole data that fell within the constraints 
of the above-mentioned domains. These composites were calculated for Au over 2 m lengths 
starting at the first point of intersection between assay data hole and hanging wall of the 3-D 
zonal constraint. The compositing process was halted upon exit from the footwall of the 
aforementioned constraint. Un-assayed intervals were set to ½ assay detection limit values. Any 
composites that were less than 0.50 metre in length were discarded so as not to introduce any 
short sample bias in the interpolation process. The constrained composite data were transferred 
to Gemcom extraction files for the grade interpolation as X, Y, Z, Au, files. 
 
14.3.3 Grade Capping 
 
Grade capping was investigated on the raw assay values in the databases within the constraining 
domains to ensure that the possible influence of erratic high values did not bias the database. 
Extraction files were created for the constrained Au data. From these extraction files, log-normal 
histograms were generated. See graphs in Appendix-III.

14.4 VARIOGRAPHY 
 
Variography was attempted on the domain composites of the five Karma Project deposits with 
variable success. Reasonable directional variograms were attained for the Goulagou I and 
Goulagou II Deposits. The Rambo, Nami and Kao Deposits yielded reasonable omnivariograms. 
In all cases the composites of all domains for each of the five deposits were combined prior to 
attempting variography. See variograms in Appendix-IV. 
 
14.5 BULK DENSITY 
 
The data used for the creation of density block models were provided by Riverstone (69 samples 
by KCA) and also from site visit samples taken by Antoine Yassa, P.Geo. (9 samples analyzed at 
ALS, Ouagadougou). The resulting bulk density values were as follows: 2.2 t/m3 for Oxide 
Rock, 2.4 t/m3 for Transition Rock and 2.8 t/m3 for Sulphide Rock. 
 
14.6 BLOCK MODELING 
 
The Karma Project Deposits resource models were divided into a block model framework 
containing the following parameters as shown in Table 14.1. 
 

TABLE 14.4 
BLOCK MODEL PARAMETERS 

Deposit Number of Blocks 
Block Size 
(X,Y,Z) m

Goulagou II 7,293,000 5 x 5 x 5 520-187-75 0o 

 
Separate block models were created for rock type, density, percent, class and Au. 
 
The percent block model was set up to accurately represent the volume and subsequent tonnage 
that was occupied by each block inside the constraining domain. As a result, the domain 
boundary was properly represented by the percent model ability to measure infinitely variable 
inclusion percentages within that domain. The Au composites were extracted from the Microsoft 
Access database composite table into separate files. Inverse distance cubed (1/d3) grade 
interpolation was utilized. 
 
The first interpolation pass was utilized for the Indicated classification and the second for 
Inferred. The resulting Au grade blocks can be seen on the block model cross-sections in 
Appendix-V. Grade blocks were interpolated using the parameters in Table 14.5. 
 
14.7 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
 
All resource classifications were determined from the Indicated and Inferred search ellipsoid 
parameters indicated in Table 14.5. The resulting classification blocks can be seen on the block 
model cross-sections in Appendix-VI.

14.8 RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
The Karma Project deposit resource estimates were derived from applying Au cut-off grades to 
the block model and reporting the resulting tonnes and grade for potentially mineable areas. The 
tonnage of any known artisanal workings was removed from the resource estimates. The Au cut-
off grade calculations for resource reporting of the open pit potentially economic portions of the 
mineralization were derived from operating costs for projects similar to the Karma Project as 
follows: 
 
Oxide Cut-Off Grade Calculation US$ 
 
Au Price US$1,250/oz. (36 month approx trailing 

average price Dec 31, 2011) 
Au Recovery 90% 
Process Cost (6,000tpd) $8/tonne milled 
General & Administration $3/tonne mined 
Operating costs per ore tonne = ($8 + $3) = $11/tonne 
($11)/[($1,250/oz/31.1035 x 90% Recovery)] = 0.30 g/t 
 
Transition Cut-Off Grade Calculation US$ 
 
Au Price US$1,250/oz. (36 month approx trailing 

average price Dec 31, 2011) 
Au Recovery 75%

Notes: 
1.) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate 

of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 
sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues. 

2.) The quantity and grade of reported inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there 
has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral 
resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured 
mineral resource category. 

3.) The mineral resources in this report were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared 
by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council.

14.9 CONFIRMATION OF ESTIMATE 
 
As a test of the reasonableness of the resource estimates, the block models were queried at a 
0.01g/t Au cut-off grade with blocks in all classifications summed and their grades weight 
averaged. This average is the average grade of all blocks within the mineralized domain. The 
values of the interpolated grades for the block model were compared to the length weighted 
capped average grades and average grade of composites of all samples from within the model. 
See Table 14.8. 
 

 
The comparison above for the Nami, Kao and Goulagou I Deposits shows the average grade of 
all the Au blocks in the constraining domains to be similar to the weighted average of all capped 
assays and composites used for grade estimation. The Rambo and Goulagou II Deposits have a 
lower block model average grade compared to the weighted average of all capped assays and 
composites due to localized clustering. In this case, the block model grade will be more spatially 
representative. In addition, a volumetric comparison was performed with the block model 
volumes of each model versus the geometric calculated volume of the domain solids. See Table 
14.9.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR
 COMMUNITY IMPACT 
 
Riverstone   retained   the   services   of   the   Bureau   d'Etudes   des   Geosciences,   des   Energies   et   de  
l'Environnement,   ("BEGE"),  a   local  Burkina Faso environmental consultancy company, for an 
Environmental Study of the area within the Karma Project. The study was completed by BEGE 
in December 2011 and covered: 
 

1) The initial status of air quality, groundwater, ecology, soil and land use and the 
social and economic characterization; 

2) The identification and analysis of the Project impacts and the estimation of the 
global compensation costs related to these impacts.  

 
The study concluded that: 
 

 Riverstone   adheres   to   the   norms   and   policies   of   the   "SFI"   a   subsidiary   of   the  
World Bank;  

 The area located some 20 km east of the town of Ouahigouya, is sparsely 
populated with habitation centered in several small villages throughout the Project 
area; 

 Subsistence farming and cattle grazing appear to be the main industry, although 
artisanal mining is reported at several locations, mostly situated along the known 
outcrops of the various mineralized zones;  

 Riverstone has established a community relations program and has maintained 
good relations with local inhabitants and with influent people who have control on 
the artisanal miners, including the fair treatment of these miners if their relocation 
to another mining area is required, and compensation for crops in new mining 
areas;  

 Artisanal  miners  ("orpailleurs")  are  both  local  villagers  and  itinerants  who  tend  to  
move throughout West Africa in search of rich near surface Au deposits. The 
majority of orpailleurs within the project area are outsiders with no roots in the 
community. They understand most of their activities are illegal and are prepared 
to move and have moved when Riverstone has requested access;  

 In 2010, Riverstone moved a considerable number of artisanal operators at the 
Nami and Rambo Main Deposits for safety reasons in order to facilitate the in-fill 
drilling program. The moves were completed without any problem;  

 The area covered by the resource estimate does not contain any legal human 
settlement and is mainly used for cattle grazing and farming of annual crops, such 
as maize, and millet. This includes the other areas of possible economic interest, 
which are also free from legal human settlement; 

 Throughout the local community,  Riverstone's  Karma  Project  is  well  known  and  
supported. Both community and local leadership look forward to employment 
creation and the increase of commercial activity in the area.

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
There are six producing mines in Burkina Faso, as well as many advanced stage exploration 
projects, (The Northern Miner, February 2012). Au production in the country is estimated to be 
in the order of 1 million ounces in 2011. 
 
Figure 23.1 shows the locations of the producing mines and advanced exploration projects in 
Burkina Faso. The Goulagou Deposits are marked on the map along with the previous (2011) 
resource estimate. 
 
Figure 23.1 Location of Producing Mines and Exploration Projects Burkina Faso

The six producing mines are Essakane (Iamgold), Mana (Semafo), Inata (Avocet Mining), 
Youga (Endeavour Mining), Taparko-Bourom (High River Gold Mines) and Kalsaka (Cluff 
Gold).  
 
Regarding the advanced exploration projects, the Kiaka Project (Volta Resources) is slated for a 
feasibility study in 2012, and Volta also plans on advancing its other projects in the country. 
 
Avion Gold Corporation's  Hounde Project is slated for a PEA in 2012. 
 
Orezone Gold's  Bombore  Project  is  at  a  very  advanced  stage,  and  a  full  feasibility  is  projected  
for year-end 2012.

High  River  Gold  Mine's  Bissa  group of exploration permits comprise seven contiguous permits: 
Zandkom, Bissa, Raka, Tosse, Tema, Gargo and Namtenga. High River owns 100% of the 
permits except for Zandkom and Bissa (147 sq km) where the Company owns a 90% interest. In 
June 2009 High River reported the results of a revised Mineral Resource evaluation completed 
by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. ("SRK"). The revised Mineral Resource estimate was prepared 
following the National Instrument 43-101 guidelines and incorporated new assay results from 
drilling and trenching performed by High River during 2007 and 2008. It was prepared to 
support conceptual mine design work currently being completed by engineering consultants 
GENIVAR ("GENIVAR") to evaluate the feasibility of an open pit mining and processing 
operation at Bissa. The effective date of the Mineral Resource Statement was April 23, 2009. 
The Mineral Resource Statement was contained within a Technical Report prepared by SRK 
dated June 18, 2009.

Work at Bissa West is on-going. 
 
Boss Resources of Australia has three projects ongoing; Golden Hill, Tenkodogo and Gourma. 
These projects are at relatively early stages.  
 
Ampella Mining Ltd. holds the five Batie West tenements covering an area of 811 square km and 
occupying a 110 km long gold-bearing shear zone that occurs along the southwest margin of the 
Boromo Greenstone Belt. 
 
Gryphon Minerals Ltd. holds the Banfora Project. The project area contains six exploration 
licenses covering a total of 1,200 square km and encapsulates the entire   'Loumana'   Birimian  
greenstone belt within Burkina Faso. The project area is easily accessible by road and in close 
proximity to the town of Banfora.  
 
Since Gryphon commenced exploration at the Banfora Gold Project drilling has focused in and 
around the large granodiorite intrusion known as the Nogbele (Nog-bee-lee) and Fourkoura 
(Four-core-a) targets. In January of 2011 drilling targets were stepped out to the Samavogo 
(Sam-a-vo-go) target area and a maiden Inferred Resource Estimate of 520,000 oz of gold was 
delineated at the deposit within one year from initial discovery.  
 
Coronation International Mining Corp. holds the Tambao manganese Project. The deposit is an 
advanced project subject to earlier feasibility studies based on the mining of manganese ore 
without beneficiation. The studies established a proven reserve of 4.6 million tonnes at 56.8% 
manganese. This reserve has been audited by the Mineral Corporation, a Johannesburg-based

mineral consulting group. Previous exploration has identified a geological resource of 14 to 17 
million tonnes at a grade of approximately 51.5% manganese. 
 
The pre-feasibility study will be undertaken by Titaco Projects (Pty) Limited, part of the 
Bateman Group of process engineering consultants.  
 
Blackthorn Resources holds the Perkoa Zinc Mine. The Perkoa Zinc mine is located in the 
Sanguie Province of Burkina Faso, 120 km west of the capital Ouagadougou. The Perkoa Zinc 
Mine will be the largest zinc mine development undertaken in the country to date. The Perkoa 
deposit is a classic VMS deposit hosted by the Lower Proterozoic Birimian Belt. Perkoa has a 
JORC code compliant probable ore reserve of 6.3 million tonnes at a mine head grade of 13.9% 
zinc (at a 9% Zn cut off), equating to 873,400 tonnes of contained zinc metal. 
 
Cluff Gold's   Kalsaka   Mine   is   approximately   50   km   south-east of the Karma Project. As at 
December 31 2010, Kalsaka had an estimated 186,000 ounces of Au in Proven and Probable 
reserves, at an average grade of 1.7 g/t Au. Inclusive of the mineral reserves, it hosted 402,000 
ounces of Au in the Measured and Indicated categories, at an average grade of 1.6 g/t Au, with 
an additional 157,000 ounces of Au in the Inferred category. 
 
On February 3, 2012, Orezone Resources sold their Sega project to Cluff Gold. Sega currently 
hosts NI 43-101 compliant Indicated Au resources of 450,366 oz (8.3Mt at 1.69 g/t) and Inferred 
Au resources of 147,344 oz (2.9Mt at 1.58g/t). Sega  is  located  adjacent  to  Cluff's  Kalsaka  mine,

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Since the release of the previous resource estimates for the Karma Project in April 2011, 
41,000 m of drilling has been completed, and resources have been defined for a fifth zone (the 
Nami Deposit).  
 
The resource estimates as declared in this Technical Report have demonstrated an increase of 
42%, or approximately 800,000 oz Au for the global mineral inventory compared to the 2011 
resource estimates. The current estimate was completed on the Goulagou I, Goulagou II, Kao, 
Rambo and Nami Deposits, which are all in close proximity to each other. 
 
The resources are contained within five Whittle open pit shells. The following highlights of the 
2012 resource estimates for the Karma Project are as follows: 
 

 Global Mineral Inventory (inside and outside of Whittle pit shells) consists of an 
Indicated Resource totalling 1,773,000 ounces of Au in 54.1 Mt at an average 
grade of 1.02 g/t Au and an Inferred Resource totalling 959,000 ounces of Au in 
37.4 Mt at an average grade of 0.8 g/t Au; 

 A significant portion of the Au resources are at shallows depth (less than 200 m 
vertical depth) and over 80% of the global mineral inventory is contained with the 
five Whittle pit shells; 

 Total Indicated Au resources within the five Whittle pits are 1,634,000 ounces of 
Au in 47.34 Mt at an average grade of 1.07 g/t Au;  

 Total Inferred Au resources within the five Whittle pits are 566,000 ounces of Au 
in 18.93 Mt at an average grade of 0.93 g/t Au;  

 74% of the resources within the Whittle pit shells are classified as Indicated Au 
resources.  

 Mineralization remains open at depth and along strike in at least one direction for 
all deposits.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
It   is   recommended   that  Riverstone  proceed  with  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment   ("PEA")  
on the Karma Project. Drilling is currently on-going with four drills on the Project, with the goal 
of converting the Inferred Resources to Indicated, and to determine along strike and at depth 
extensions of the deposits.  
 
The PEA can be based on Measured, Indicated, or Inferred Mineral Resources, or a combination 
of any of these. The PEA should include disclosure of forecast mine production rates that might 
contain capital costs to develop and sustain the mining operation, operating costs, and projected 
cash flows. 
 
The budget for the necessary drilling and the completion of the PEA is estimated at 
$US 15 million. This involves drilling subsequent to that included in the present resource 
estimate, and to the estimated completion date of the PEA. Of the total, approximately 
$US 8 million has already been spent, leaving about $US 7 million to be spent to the completion 
of the PEA.
