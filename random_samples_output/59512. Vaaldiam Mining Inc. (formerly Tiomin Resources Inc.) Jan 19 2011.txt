1.0 1.0 Summary 

Introduction 

 

At the request of Mr. Kenneth Johnson, Vice President and COO  of Vaaldiam Mining Inc. ("Vaaldiam"), 

A.C.A. Howe International Limited ("Howe") has completed an independent technical report ("Report") 

specific to the standards dictated by National Instrument 43-101 in respect to the Braúna Kimberlite 

Diamond Project ("Braúna Kimberlite" or "Property) situated in Bahia State, Brazil.  The purpose of this 

report is to complete a mineral (diamond) resource estimate on the Braúna 3 ("B3") kimberlite.  The 

Mineral Resource Estimate has been completed in accordance with the CIM Mineral Resource and 

Mineral Reserve definitions referenced in NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  This 

Mineral Resource Estimate represents the first reporting of mineral resources from the Braúna Kimberlite 

Property. 

 

Vaaldiam, previously Tiomin Resources Inc. (Tiomin) is a publicly held company incorporated under the 

Canada Business Corporations Act and listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  Tiomin acquired Vaaldiam 

Resources Limited in March of 2010, thus changing its name as a result of the acquisition.  Vaaldiam is 

engaged in the exploration and development of mineral properties and diamond mining in Brazil.  The 

corporate office is located at 55 University Avenue, Suite 1105, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5J 2H7. 

 

The B3 kimberlite is one of twenty-two kimberlitic occurrences that are found within the Braúna 

Property.  The kimberlite occurrences have been mapped along a 15 km long northwest-southeast 

trending fissure system originally discovered by De Beers Brasil Ltda (De Beers), during an extensive 

exploration campaign that began in 1980.   

 

Majescor Resources Inc. ("Majescor") acquired the minerals exploration licenses and data bank for the 

Property from De Beers in 2004.  In August of 2005 Vaaldiam acquired a 60% interest in the Property 

from Majescor and began an evaluation program by November of the same year.  In March of 2007, 

Vaaldiam secured 100% interest in the Braúna Property, and was actively evaluating and exploring the 

mineral exploration claims from 2005 to 2008.  Exploration culminated with a mini bulk sampling 

program that tested nine surface kimberlite occurrences, with results reported in late 2008.  In May 2009, 

during the global economic crisis, Vaaldiam announced the sale of 80% equity interest in the Property to 

Lipari Mineração Ltda ("Lipari"), a Brazilian-registered private group.  Vaaldiam holds a 20% interest in 

the Braúna diamond project through Lipari which holds the mineral rights to the Property. Vaaldiam 

holds 100% of the rights relating to the gold potential of the Property, with the exception of any 

by‐product gold produced as a result of diamond mining activities.  
 

 

Property Location and Site Description 

 

The Braúna Property is centred approximately at latitude 10º55' south and longitude 39º25' west and is 

located approximately 7 km south of the town of Nordestina in the State of Bahia, Brazil.  Salvador, the 

state capital of Bahia, is approximately 330 km southeast of the Property.  

 

The Braúna Property consists of ten active, contiguous exploration permits encompassing approximately 

12,130 ha.  Two additional claims (Umba: 872.996/05 and Aroeira: 872.997/05) are located 12 km west-

northwest and 50 km west-southwest of Nordestina, respectively adding an additional 2,800 ha to the 

Property area.

Geology and Mineralization 

 

The Property is located in the Serrinha Block of the northern portion of the São Francisco Craton.  The 

Craton is bounded by Neoproterozoic Brasiliano orogenic belts and is partially covered by 

Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic basins. Its Archaean¬Paleoproterozoic basement is well exposed in 

Minas Gerais State, in the south, but it is in Bahia State that the largest and most continuous exposures are 

found.  In Bahia State, the basement has been grouped into three Archean blocks: Gavião, Jequié and 

Serrinha.  The blocks are bounded by the Paleoproterozoic Contendas-Jacobina basins and the Itabuna-

Salvador-Curaçá Orogen (Barbosa and Sabaté, 2004). These blocks are composed of gneisses and 

migmatites, granites and volcano-sedimentary sequences. The Serrinha block forms a mega-ellipsoidal 

structure (> 21.000 km
2
) that has remained relatively rigid during the Paleoproterozoic Transamazonian 

collisional/reworking event. During this event the structural framework of the Itabuna-Salvador¬ Curaçá 

orogen, to the west, was formed. In the east, the Serrinha block is covered by Neoproterozoic and 

Phanerozoic age sediments. 

 

The lithostratigraphic succession of the Serrinha block consists dominantly of: (i) an Archean basement of 

migmatitic gneisses and calc-alkaline to tonalite-trondhjemite¬granodiorite (TTG) plutons, mostly 

granodiorite with N-S foliation; (ii) volcano-sedimentary sequences of the Paleoproterozoic Rio Itapicuru 

Greenstone Belt ("RIGB") and the Rio Capim Group; and (iii) Paleoproterozoic granitic intrusions (Silva 

et al., 2001; Oliveira et al., 2004; Mello et al., 2006).  Syenites make up a distinct but volumetrically 

minor rock assemblage in the western part of Serrinha block; they postdate the major volcanic-plutonic 

cycles and much of the early deformation (Rios et al., 2007). Previous studies divided the greenstone belt 

supracrustal rocks from bottom to top as a tholeiitic basalt unit with an age of 2,209 Ma, a calc-alkaline 

felsic volcanic unit with an age of about 2,170 Ma (Silva et al., 2001) and a chemical and clastic 

sedimentary unit. Several granitic batholiths and stocks intruded these units during two major episodes; 

the older is dominated by trondhjemitic plutons between the ages of 2.152 Ma and 2.163 Ma, and the 

younger by calc¬ alkaline plutons, lamproites and syenites between the ages of 2,080 Ma and 2,130 Ma 

respectively (Oliveira et al., 2004; Rios et al., 2005, 2007; Mello et al., 2006).  

 

The Braúna kimberlite field consists of twenty-two kimberlite "occurrences", defined as kimberlite rock 

that has been discovered at or near surface.  The kimberlite occurrences occur as elongated dykes or 

larger blows that are emplaced along an elongated northwest-southeast fissure system.  The larger 

expressions of kimberlite can be up to 2 hectares; however, substantial internal dilution of country rock 

material may be included in the interpreted extent of individual occurrences.  The geology of the 

kimberlite is complex, and is characterized by kimberlitic dykes and wider blows with multiple irregular 

petrographic facies that have intruded the Nordestina Batholith.  

 

 

Exploration History 

 

Prior to the 1980's, the primary exploration activities to take place on the Braúna Property were artisanal 

gold and diamond mining that took place from 1927 to 1953.  The majority of the mining activities took 

place along the Itapicuru River where more than 5,000 garimperos were looking for gold and diamonds.  

Some 5,000 stones in the Itapicuru River (the largest stone reported was 10.5 carats) were reported to 

have been recovered. 

 

The following is a summary of exploration and artisanal activities from the 1980's onward that took place 

on the Braúna Property by previous operators and Vaaldiam from 1980 to 2008.

1980-1998 

Modern systematic exploration for diamonds in the area was initiated in 1980 by De Beers Brasil Ltda. 

The target area within the Braúna project area was chosen based on historical recovery of diamonds by 

garimpeiros in the Itapicuru River Basin, as well as the interpretation of local tectonic features.  The 

initial area of mineral interest was located south of the city of Nordestina and within the Itapicuru River 

Basin. 

 

The initial phase of prospecting by De Beers was restricted to a regional stream sediment sampling 

program.  This program returned negative results.  In 1989 and 1990 a detailed stream sediment sampling 

program was carried out by De Beers.  This survey identified a kimberlite indicator mineral (KIM) 

anomaly: garnets and Cr-spinels that were obtained in samples from the Riacho Grande Creek in the 

Itapicuru River basin.  Follow-up work, including systematic stream and soil sampling, led to the 

discovery of Braúna 1 (B1) and Braúna 2 (B2) dykes and the Braúna 3 kimberlite which at the time was 

interpreted as a blow.  KIM mineral chemistry results from these kimberlitic occurrences were 

characteristic of diamondiferous kimberlite, for which was confirmed by microdiamond analysis.   

 

A limited surface sampling program that was carried out in the mid-1990s by De Beers demonstrated that 

the kimberlitic occurrences on the Property contained macrodiamonds.  The sample volumes were less 

than 5 m
3
 and the largest stones recovered were 0.50 and 0.31 carats.   

 

Detailed soil sampling and ground magnetic surveys were also carried out over the Braúna discovery area.  

The soil sampling survey defined 12 additional dyke-shaped occurrences.  A regional airborne magnetic 

survey was flown at a line spacing of 250 m, covering an area ≈7,600 km
2
, however, no additional 

kimberlitic occurrences were discovered from the follow-up of this airborne survey. 

 

Based on the near surface sample test results which comprised of micro and macrodiamond recovery, 

kimberlite petrography, and KIM geochemistry, the Braúna kimberlite occurrences were deemed to be 

small in size and potential diamond grades to be insufficient to support the development of an economic 

mine based on De Beers threshold criteria at that time.  These poor indications caused De Beers to 

suspend work in this area in 1998, but held the mineral licences until 2004. 

 

2000-2004 

Extensive artisanal mining activity was conducted by Mr. Nélio Amambahy on his farm near the vicinity 

of the B3 kimberlite.  Informal production records from the manual mining operation indicated that 

during 2000 and 2001, a total of 250 diamonds with a total weight of 372.9 carats were recovered from 

colluvial gravels and soils that were excavated immediately downslope from B3.  Individual diamonds 

reportedly ranged in size from 0.20 carats to 15.5 carats, with a significant portion of the stones falling in 

the 1 to 3 carat range, with an average stone size of 1.49 carats.  The 1.5-2 m thick calcrete cap appeared 

to have prohibited mining of the kimberlite itself. However, a small 8 m deep pit that was excavated 

through the calcrete and into the kimberlite reportedly recovered a 3.55 carat diamond from the pit. 

 

2004 

De Beers signed an agreement with Majescor in December 2004, transferring their 100% interest in the 

Property, which at the time comprised three mineral claims totaling 49 km
2
.  As part of the agreement, De 

Beers provided to Majescor a full data set package (sample results, aeromagnetic surveys, etc.) for the 

claims and additional data covering an Area of Interest of 7.612 km
2
.  The data included airborne 

geophysics flown over the Property, as well as information pertaining to 9,259 samples that were 

collected.  Detailed mineral chemistry results for 22,106 grains recovered from these samples were also 

made available to Majescor.  The Majescor – De Beers agreement provided for an outright purchase of a 

100% interest in the Braúna Property from De Beers for two cash payments totaling $500,000.

2005-2008 

In 2005, Vaaldiam acquired a 60% interest in the Property under the terms of a purchase agreement with 

Majescor, whereby Vaaldiam paid De Beers the sum of $300,000 on behalf of Majescor which 

represented the balance owed by Majescor to De Beers (under the terms of a purchase agreement outlined 

above). In addition, Vaaldiam issued a total of 150,000 common shares to Majescor. 

 

Vaaldiam was designated as the operator of the project and in November 2005, began work on the 

Property.  Work consisted of a detailed review and compilation of all the historic exploration, drilling, 

geophysical survey data, and sample test data completed by De Beers on the Property.  In addition, 

remote sensing data including aerial photographs and satellite images were analyzed and interpreted using 

geological and geophysical maps of different scales.  These preliminary maps were used by Vaaldiam to 

guide planning of the initial field activities, prioritizing known kimberlite bodies and potential kimberlitic 

exploration targets for detailed follow-up exploration work in 2006.  

 

Stream sediment samples were collected by Vaaldiam for KIM analysis on selected small drainage basins 

near known kimberlitic occurrences followed by line cutting and ground magnetic and EM surveys over 

B3, B4 and B7.  Soil samples were collected along the cut grid lines and KIMs were picked from the 

heavy mineral concentrates.   

 

Vaaldiam also carried out a rotary auger hole drilling program to delineate the extent of several kimberlite 

bodies and trenching was used to a limited extent on B8, B18, B19 and B21 to determine the width of the 

kimberlitic occurrences.  Vaaldiam's exploration work yielded seven new kimberlitic occurences. 

 

From 2005-2008, a core drilling program was conducted in two Phases: Phase I from November 2005 to 

August 2006 on B3, B4, B7 and B16 and Phase II from July to December of 2007 on B3, B8 and B21.  

Microdiamond analysis was conducted on drill core composite samples from B3 and B7. 

 

In March 2007, Vaaldiam acquired Majescor's remaining 40% interest in the Property; increasing its 

ownership to 100%.  Under the terms of the agreement, Majescor received a $2,250,000 cash payment, 

$1,500,000 paid in common shares of Vaaldiam, and a 1% Gross Sales Royalty on diamond production 

from the Braúna Property. 

 

Following the March 2007 agreement with Majescor, Vaaldiam began a mini bulk sampling program.  

Kimberlites targeted included B3, B4, B7, B8, B11, B12, B18, B19 and B21.  Surface shafts were 

excavated to depths of 17 m from surface. 

 

 

2010 Vaaldiam Bulk Sampling Program 

 

From June to October 2010, a total of two individual surface bulk samples were collected by Vaaldiam 

from the South lobe (Samples 1 and 2) and North lobe (Sample #3) at B3 respectively in order to obtain a 

macrodiamond parcel for diamond grade and valuation purposes.  Upon the completion of Sample 1, 

Sample 2 was taken below Sample 1 within the same bulk sample pit perimeter.   

 

Each surveyed sample pit perimeter measured a nominal 30 m by 40 m with variable depths (from 3m to 

5m per bulk sample).  Upon completion, each sample pit was surveyed in order to obtain volumes 

excavated (with bulk density samples collected for dry tonnage estimates).  All kimberlite material from 

each sample trench was stockpiled separately prior to processing. 



 

5 

 

In order to process a significant amount of kimberlite, Vaaldiam purchased and commissioned a bulk 

sampling process plant in order to recover diamonds from large-scale surface bulk samples.  The process 

plant (and subsequent results) was designed to simulate a commercial kimberlite ore treatment plant.   

 

Vaaldiam's DMS and Recovery circuits were designed and constructed by ADP Projects Limited (ADP) 

of South Africa.  ADP is one of many engineering companies involved in the design, construction and 

commissioning of modular diamond process plants around the world.  The front-end portion of the 

process plant (feed bin, vibrating grizzly, scrubber, crushing and screening circuit) was sourced and 

fabricated in Brazil by Simplex Equipamentos Ltda.   

 

Vaaldiam's process plant consists of the following circuits: 

 

1. A 20 tph capacity feed bin - scrubber - crushing circuit; 

2. A 10 tph DMS circuit which consists of a 250mm separating cyclone; and, 

3. A recovery circuit consisting of a vibrating screen, one Flowsort® XR2/19DW X-Ray diamond 

sorting machine ("Sortex"), a grease table and a diamond sorting house equipped with a glove 

box and safe facility. 

 

A total of 1,057.39 carats were recovered from a total of 4,909.3 dry tonnes of +1.0mm kimberlite 

material processed through Vaaldiam's bulk sampling DMS process plant.  The production and sampling 

results per individual bulk sample is listed in Table 1 below..

During the bulk sample processing program, Howe was involved in providing technical assistance (by 

electronic or telephone correspondence) to Vaaldiam's on-site staff regarding the review of process plant 

production data, operational QA/QC, process plant troubleshooting, chain of custody and sample integrity 

of the bulk sample processing program.  During this period Howe believes that the quality of the diamond 

processing data is reliable and that the sample preparation, analysis and security were carried out in 

accordance with exploration best practices and industry standards. 

 

 

Diamond Valuation 

 

At the completion of the bulk sampling program, Vaaldiam commissioned two independent groups of 

diamond valuators based in Antwerp, Belgium and in Canada to carry out a valuation on an initial 

1,048.49 carat diamond parcel recovered from the B3 bulk sampling program.  The 1,048.49 carat 

diamond parcel was examined by: 

 

1. Diamond Counsellor International (DCI); and,

2. International Economic Strategy (IES) 

 

The diamond valuation was completed on November 1, 2010 whereby an average value of US$338 per 

carat was obtained from independent valuation of this parcel.  Table 2 summarizes the diamond valuation 

statistics from each of the diamond valuators.

Mineral Resource Estimate 

 

The mineral resource estimate presented herein for the B3 kimberlite is reported in accordance with the 

Canadian Securities Administrator's National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) and has been estimated in 

conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best 

Practices" guidelines including the "Guidelines for Reporting of Diamond Exploration Results".  Mineral 

Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  There is no 

guarantee that all or any part of the Mineral Resource will be converted into a Mineral Reserve.  The 

quantity and grade of the reported Inferred Resources in this resource statement are conceptual in nature. 

The mineral resource estimate of the B3 kimberlite was carried out using a local block estimation method 

and cross-validated by a global resource estimation method.  Both resource estimation methods consisted 

of data / information derived from the following: 

 

 Revision and re-interpretation of the 2007 3D volumetric model that was constructed by Wardrop 
Engineering Inc. (Wardrop) based on re-surveyed drillhole collar data; 

 Construction of a density block model; 

 Completed diamond size frequency distribution analysis of the diamonds obtained from both the 
drillcore microdiamond (MiDa) and the 2010 bulk sample; 

 Internal dilution estimates study based on drillhole database. 
 

For the entire B3 kimberlite, a "3D volumetric" model was constructed in which internal geological units 

were not modelled separately.  As such, any variation in diamond grades for this mineral resource 

estimate is considered low since the resource estimate is based on two sample points and that the weakly 

to moderately saprolitized kimberlitic material that the bulk samples were derived from did not undergo a 

volume reduction due to the chemical weathering of the original fresh kimberlite.  In using the carats per 

tonne grade obtained from the individual bulk samples for the mineral resource estimate, Howe has 

assumed that there was little or no volumetric reduction of the original fresh kimberlite thus no change in 

the concentration of diamonds (i.e number of stones contained) recovered from the individual bulk 

samples.   

 



 

7 

 

Composited micro-diamond data were plotted with that obtained from the bulk samples to confirm that 

the diamond sample grades obtained from the surface bulk samples can be used for estimating both a 

local block estimate and a global / zonal grade (overall average grade assigned to all blocks) at depth for 

the B3 pipe.  This resource estimate is in effect a "point" sample resource estimate (i.e. surface sample 

points only) as it does not represent a three dimensional spatial grade estimate at depth if sample grade 

data were available.   

 

To a depth of 50m (235mRL) the bulk sample grade data are reasonable and geological drillholes are at 

roughly 50 m grid spacing and to a depth averaging 200m with one drillhole at 250m depth.  Although 

variograms indicating grade continuity and predictability could not be determined due to a lack of sample 

grade data at depth for both kimberlite lobes, grade interpolation ranges were defined by Howe for both 

the Indicated and Inferred Resource categories to be used for the local block resource estimate method.  

Similar methods were applied for estimating the global resource estimation method but with geological 

input defining the boundaries for both the Indicated / Inferred Resources depth limit and for dividing the 

kimberlite body into two distinct lobes for volume, tonnage and grade estimation purposes.  This 

geological input was a factor in estimating a higher percentage of Indicated Resources and carats 

contained as oppose to the results obtained from the local block estimation method.   

 

As a result, the global resource estimation grade model is considered reliable of the resource estimate for 

B3.  As such, the North and South lobes are considered an Indicated Mineral Resource to a depth of 50 m 

(235 mRL) and an Inferred Mineral Resource thereafter to an average depth of 205 m (80 mRL) below 

surface.   

 

Based on the global estimate method, the mineralization of the B3 kimberlite as of December 2010 is 

classified as Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources.

Interpretations and Conclusions 

 

Based on the interpretations and conclusions that have been identified from the diamond resource 

estimate of the B3 kimberlite is as follows: 

 



 

8 

 

1. Based on the deep core drilling that was undertaken pre-2007, the geological extent of the B3 
kimberlite as been defined to a maximum depth of 250m, thus identifying the potential for 

additional Mineral Resources at depth; 

 

2. The B3 south lobe contain diamond concentrations that have the potential to be economic, 
whereas the B3 north lobe contain diamond concentrations that are low due to the dilutional 

effect of the granodiorite contained within that lobe; 

 

3. The results of the 2010 large-scale surface bulk sampling program of the B3 provided a 
representative sample on the diamond grade, diamond distribution and diamond quality for 

the South lobe; 

 

4. The results of the 2010 large-scale surface bulk sampling program of the B3 North lobe did 
not provide a representative sample on the diamond grade, diamond distribution and diamond 

quality, however the result is possibly representative of the potential recovered diamond grade 

that could be expected if the lobe was to be mined; 

 

5. The results of the latest revised Mineral Resource estimate are tabulated in Table 15.5 and 
Table 15.6.  The Mineral Resource estimate of the B3 kimberlite is based on the geological 

continuity of the kimberlite contained within each lobe at surface and at depth, and the 

diamond grades obtained from the recently completed surface bulk sample program.  This 

Mineral Resource is considered to be a "point" sample resource since the sample grade 

density is low; 

 

6. There is additional potential for the B3 whereby the Inferred Mineral Resource at depth could 
be extended beyond the 250m level.  The potential quantity and grade of any potential 

Mineral Resources beyond the 250mRL is conceptual in nature as there is insufficient 

exploration to define a Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in 

the target being delineated as a Mineral Resource. 

 

7. The completed 2010 bulk sample work program has met the original objective of obtaining 
diamond data (grade, diamond valuation) in order to carry out the Mineral Resource for the 

B3 kimberlite. 

 

 

Recommendations and Proposed 2011 Work Program 

 

Vaaldiam's advanced exploration program budget for the Braúna Kimberlite project work program for 

2011 is estimated at $200,000 dollars.  The 2011 exploration work programs consist of additional infill 

core drilling, completion of additional surface bulk sampling.  Based on the technical data and 

encouraging diamond results obtained to date from its large-scale surface kimberlite bulk sampling 

program and diamond valuation, it is Howe's opinion, that the B3 Kimberlite warrants additional work, 

and Howe fully concurs with the 2011 work program that Vaaldiam plans to execute in order to complete 

a preliminary economic assessment ("PEA") of the B3 kimberlite. 

 

Vaaldiam is currently carrying-out the PEA on the B3 Kimberlite in order to collect the necessary data to 

determine the project's viability under current economic conditions.  Vaaldiam anticipates that the PEA 

will be completed by Q2 2011.  Based on favourable results from the PEA, a pre-feasibility or a full 

bankable feasibility study could be started by Q3 2011.   

 



 

9 

 

The pre-feasibility study ("PFS") work program will entail the collection of additional exploration 

information, such as geological, geotechnical, geometallurgical and other relevant information to 

delineate and define the B3 Kimberlite, with a sufficient level of confidence, to estimate a revised Mineral 

Resource in accordance to National Instrument 43-101 and Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 

Petroleum ("CIM") standards.  The data collection, interpretation, modelling and estimation will be done 

in a phased manner and will be continuously reviewed on an ongoing basis as new information comes to 

light. 

 

In order to estimate the revised Mineral Resource from the kimberlite lobes, a surface diamond core 

drilling ("SDCD") and/or large diameter drilling (17.5 inch or 24 inch diameter) reverse circulation 

program ("LDD") and additional surface bulk sampling will be undertaken by Vaaldiam.  The surface 

core drilling is planned on a grid pattern to further delineate and define the kimberlite / country rock 

contacts at depth in three dimensions, to establish the geological continuity at depth as well as to obtain 

geotechnical information. 

 

The overall objective of both the SCDC the LDD campaign is to establish the kimberlite grade in a 3-D 

spatial fashion.  If an LDD drilling rig cannot be obtained to do the work, it is recommended that large 

core diameter drilling (PQ size – 85 mm diameter) be carried out in order to obtain macro diamond grade 

data at depth.  A series of PQ drill holes sites are to be drilled in an area so that sufficient amount of drill 

core can be obtained for sample processing.  These PQ drill cores can either be processed through 

Vaaldiam's mini bulk sampling plant whereby the bottom screen to be used is 1mm or the samples are 

sent to a 3
rd

 party laboratory for macro and MiDa recovery by caustic fusion. 

 

Additional core drilling is also planned for the collection of metallurgical samples for ore dressing test 

work. 

 

Once the revised Mineral Resource has been estimated, qualifying factors such as the proposed mining 

method, metallurgy, geotechnical, hydrological, environmental, location, marketing, legal, revenue, costs, 

capital and social, will be used to convert the economically mineable part of the Indicated (or Measured) 

Mineral Resource to a Mineral Reserve as part of the PFS. 

 

The PFS will include a financial and risk analysis, a desktop engineering study and data from an 

environmental baseline study to commence in Q4 2011.

2.0 2.0 Introduction 

2.1 General 

 

At the request of Mr. Kenneth Johnson, Vice President and COO of Vaaldiam Vaaldiam Mining Inc. 

("Vaaldiam"), A.C.A. Howe International Limited ("Howe") has completed an independent technical 

report ("Report") specific to the standards dictated by National Instrument 43-101 in respect to the 

Braúna Kimberlite Diamond Project ("Braúna Kimberlite" or "Property) situated in Bahia State, Brazil..  

The purpose of this report is to complete a mineral (diamond) resource estimate on the Braúna 3 ("B3") 

kimberlite.  The Mineral Resource Estimate has been completed in accordance with the CIM Mineral 

Resource and Mineral Reserve definitions referenced in NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 

Projects.  This Mineral Resource Estimate represents the first reporting of mineral resources from the 

Braúna Kimberlite Property. 

 

Vaaldiam, previously Tiomin Resources Inc. ("Tiomin") is a publicly held company incorporated under 

the Canada Business Corporations Act listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  Tiomin acquired Vaaldiam 

Resources Ltd in March of 2010, thus changing its name as a result of the acquisition.  Vaaldiam is 

engaged in the exploration and development of mineral proprieties and diamond mining in Brazil.  The 

corporate office is located at 55 University Avenue, Suite 1105, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5J 2H7. 

 

The B3 kimberlite is one of twenty-two kimberlite occurrences that are found within the Braúna Property.  

The known kimberlite occurrences have been mapped along a 15 km long northwest-southeast trending 

fissure system originally discovered by De Beers Brazil Ltda. (De Beers) during an extensive exploration 

campaign that began in 1980.   

 

Majescor Resources Inc. ("Majescor") acquired the mineral exploration licenses and data bank for the 

Property from De Beers in 2004 and in August of 2005 Vaaldiam acquired a 60% interest in the Property 

from Majescor and began an evaluation program by November of the same year.  In March of 2007, 

Vaaldiam secured 100% interest in the Braúna Property, and was actively evaluating and exploring the 

mineral exploration claims from 2005 to 2008.  Exploration culminated with a mini bulk sampling 

program that tested nine surface kimberlite occurrences, with results reported in late 2008.  In May 2009, 

during the global economic crisis, Vaaldiam announced the sale of 80% equity interest in the Property to 

Lipari Mineração Ltda.("Lipari"), a Brazilian-registered private group.  Vaaldiam holds a 20% interest in 

the Braúna diamond project through Lipari which holds the mineral rights to the Property. Vaaldiam 

holds 100% of the rights relating to the gold potential of the Property, with the exception of any 

by‐product gold produced as a result of diamond mining activities.

In preparing this report Howe reviewed geological reports, maps, miscellaneous technical papers, 

company letters and memoranda, and other public and private information as listed in Section 19.0 of this 

Report, "Sources of References".  Howe have assumed that all of the information and technical 

documents reviewed and listed in the "References" are accurate and complete in all material aspects.  

While Howe carefully reviewed all of this information, Howe has not conducted an independent 

investigation to verify its accuracy and completeness, unless otherwise stated in this Report.  While 

exercising all reasonable diligence in checking, confirming and testing, Howe has relied upon the data 

presented by Vaaldiam, its consultants and any previous operators of the project in formulating its 

opinions. 

 

Howe has only reviewed the land tenure in a preliminary fashion, and has not independently verified the 

legal status or ownership of the Property or the underlying agreements.  Howe has relied on mineral land 

title information as provided by Vaaldiam.  However, Howe is not qualified to provide legal title opinion 

on the property.   

 

In addition, Howe carried out discussions with the local management, consultants and technical personnel 

of Vaaldiam, in particular, Mr. Kenneth Johnson and Mr. Christian Schobbenhaus, Vaaldiam's Braúna 

Project Geologist.  Howe's extensive experience in kimberlite diamond deposits was also drawn upon.  

 

The description of the property has been provided by Vaaldiam.  Vaaldiam informs Howe that there have 

been no material changes as of the effective date of this Report.   

 

Those portions of the Report that relate to the location, property description, infrastructure, history, 

deposit types, exploration, drilling and adjacent properties (Sections 2.0 to 6.0) are taken, at least in part 

from Maunula (2006).  For this report, Leroux assumes primary responsibility for all sections of the 

Report as well as those that relate to aspects of history, geology, sampling, geoscientific database and 

QA/QC protocols used during the Vaaldiam exploration programs, including the independent data 

verification, the mineral resource estimate and the remainder of the interpretations, conclusions and 

recommendations (see Sections 15.0 15.0 17.0 17.0 and 18.0 18.0 ).  For this report, Mr. Roy assumes co-

responsibility for the mineral resource estimate section (see Section 15). 

 

Howe has relied on Diamond Counsellor International ("DCI") and International Economic Strategy 

("IES") for diamond valuation.  Howe believes that it is reasonable to rely on their estimates of diamond 

values.   

 

Vaaldiam has warranted that a full disclosure of all material information in their possession or control has 

been made to Howe, and that it is complete, accurate, true and not misleading. Vaaldiam has provided 

Howe with an indemnity in relation to information provided by them, since Howe have relied on 

Vaaldiam's information when preparing the Report.  Vaaldiam has agreed that neither they nor their 

associates will make any claim against Howe and Howe to recover any loss or damages suffered as a 

result of their reliance upon that information in the preparation of its Report.  Vaaldiam has also 

indemnified Howe and Howe against any claim arising out of the assignment to prepare this Report, 

except where the claim arises as a result of any proven willful misconduct or negligence on their part.  

This indemnity is also applied to any consequential extension of work through queries, questions, public 

hearings or additional work required arising out of the engagement. 

 

Vaaldiam has reviewed draft copies of the Report for factual errors.  Any changes made as a result of 

these reviews did not involve any alteration to the conclusions made. Hence, the statement and opinions 



 

13 

 

expressed in this document are given in good faith and in the belief that such statements and opinions are 

not false and misleading at the date of this Report. 

 

Howe reserves the right, but will not be obligated to revise this Report and conclusions if additional 

information becomes known to subsequent to the date of this report.

3.0 3.0 Property Description and Location 

3.1 Property Location 

 

The Braúna Property is centred approximately at latitude 10º55' south and longitude 39º25' west (Figure 

3.1). It is located approximately 7 km south of the town of Nordestina in the State of Bahia, Brazil 

(Figure 3.2Figure 3.2). Salvador, the state capital of Bahia, is located approximately 330 km southeast of 

the Property (Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2Figure 3.2).

access roads to the Property. 

 

3.2 Property Description 

 

The Braúna Property consists of ten active, contiguous exploration permits (Figure 3.3) encompassing 

approximately 12,130 ha (Table 3.1).   

 

Two additional claims (Umba: 872.996/05 and Aroeira: 872.997/05) are located 12 km west-northwest 

and 50 km west-southwest of Nordestina, respectively (see inset in Figure 3.3), adding an additional 

2,800 ha to the Property area. 

3.3 Land Tenure 

 

Vaaldiam acquired the 60% interest in the Property under the terms of a purchase agreement with 

Majescor, whereby Vaaldiam paid De Beers the sum of $300,000 on behalf of Majescor (representing the 

balance owed by Majescor under the terms of a purchase agreement involving the Property). In addition, 

Vaaldiam issued a total of 150,000 common shares to Majescor. The original JV agreement (dated 

October 31, 2005) provided that Vaaldiam's Brazilian subsidiary Mineracão Paraguaçu Industriar 

Comercio Ltda owned 60% of the Property, with Majescor through their subsidiary Majescor Brasil 

Mineracão Ltda owning 40%.  Under this agreement Vaaldiam was appointed as manager of operations.  

In March 2007, Vaaldiam acquired Majescor's 40% interest in Braúna Property, taking 100% ownership.  

All claims and permits were transferred to Vaaldiam in 2007.

hachured polygon.  Inset map shows the Umba and Aroeira claim locations with respect to 

the Braúna claim block.  Red diamonds are kimberlite: only mini bulk sampled occurrences 

are labelled. 

 

In May 2009, during the global economic crisis, Vaaldiam announced the sale of 80% equity interest in 

the Property to Lipari for total consideration of $5 million.  Vaaldiam holds a 20% interest in the Braúna 

diamond project through Lipari which holds the mineral rights to the Property. Vaaldiam remained 

operator of the new joint venture.  Vaaldiam can increase its interest in the project to 49% following the 

completion of the next phase of development (estimated completion by year end 2010) by reimbursing the 

private group 100% of their costs incurred to that date. 

 

Vaaldiam holds 100% of the rights relating to the gold potential of the Property, with the exception of any 

by‐product gold produced as a result of diamond mining activities.

*Application for Title transfer from MMC to Lipari submitted to DNPM. 

 

The current title and status of the mineral licence that comprise the Property is summarized in Table 3.1.  

B3 occurs on DNPM No. 870.908/1999 and at the time of this Report legal title of the exploration licence 

is registered to Mineração Montes Claros Ltda. ("MMC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Vaaldiam in 

Brazil.   

 

The Exploration Licenses are granted by the Brazilian government ("DNPM") for mineral exploration 

rights.  Surface rights are retained by the landowner (and access is negotiated directly with the 

landowners), but the Exploration License entitles its holder, to the exclusion of all others, to explore for 



 

18 

 

minerals, but not to conduct commercial mining.  They are valid for a maximum period of three years and 

can be extended for no more than a further three year term.   

 

In order to obtain a mining concession, a report must be filed and accepted by the DNPM (usually at the 

end of the second term) proving the existence of a mineable deposit.  If no mineable deposit is 

demonstrated, the claim is terminated.  For the purpose of establishing resources/reserves prior to the 

application for a mining concession, an experimental mining authorization (Guia de Utilizacao or GU) 

can be obtained.   

 

Vaaldiam submitted a final report to the DNPM on the B3 exploration licence (870.908/1999) in late 

2008.  The report was approved in 2009 and was followed by the issuance of a GU Permit from the 

DNPM on June 2
nd

, 2010 (see Appendix A).  The GU allows Vaaldiam to extract 3,000 carats of diamond 

on the mineral licence prior to expiry on December 30
th
, 2011.   

 

In April of 2010, Vaaldiam was granted an ordinance to mineral claim 870.908/199 from the IMA (Bahia 

State environmental agency) allowing the bulk sampling of the B3 kimberlite and the construction of an 

on-site plant (DMS) for processing the material.  The ordinance to the exploration permit is valid for two 

years and is subject to sixteen conditions (see Appendix A), including the size of area disturbed and a 

plan for reclamation.  

 

Howe has not confirmed the status of these exploration licences.  All necessary filings and registrations 

have been made by Vaaldiam with the DNPM and other applicable agencies.  The Property is in good 

standing and clear of liens, charges and encumbrances.   

 

Howe is not aware of any environmental liabilities to which the Property is subject.  However, all 

environmental conditions imposed and outlined in Appendix A (Braúna 3 Project Permits) must be 

observed.

4.0 4.0 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 

4.1 Accessibility 

 

The Property is accessible by road along highway BA-120, a paved road that extends 330 km northwest 

from Salvador, the state capital.  Salvador is serviced daily by major airlines operating in Brazil and has 

excellent connections to larger cities such as Brasilia, Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte.  Road access to the 

Property is provided from the Town of Nordestina.  The roads are relatively well maintained dirt and 

gravel roads, which traverse the Property and provide good access throughout.   

 

4.2 Climate 
 

The climate is semi-arid, typically hot and dry with a low temperature variation and low levels of rain.  

Dry season occurs from May to October and wet season from November to April. The average annual 

temperature varies between 24 ° and 26 ° C, with July and August the coldest months, and January and 

February the hottest months.  The average annual rainfall is 457 mm. 

 

4.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

 

Electrical power is available on the Project, as most of the farms that are situated on the Property are 

connected to the national grid. The Town of Nordestina is a small farming and mining centre with a 

population of 12,670 (IBGE, 2009). The town has all of the necessary services and suppliers that are 

typically required to operate an exploration program, including skilled and semi-skilled labour, an 

adequate supply of fuel, food supplies, construction materials and manufacturing shops. 

 

4.4 Physiography 

 

The Property is predominantly cultivated farmland, the area having been populated during the past three 

centuries as a result of a migration of the population away from the coast.  Topography varies at 

elevations around 300 m above sea level, with the relief of the land being controlled by the underlying 

geology, which is marked by flat areas due to the high level of erosion over basement rocks. Drainage is 

controlled by north-south faults and fractures that drain from west to east along the Itapicuru River.

5.0 5.0 History 

 

Vaaldiam began work on the Braúna Property in November 2005, completing prospecting, site 

assessment, geophysical surveys and delineation programs on the known kimberlite pipes.   

 

5.1  Overview of Major Exploration Programs 

 

1927-1953 

Azevedo (1965) described the artisanal gold and diamond mining activities ("garimpos") developed by 

Mr. Mário Santana within the Itapicuru River and its tributaries.  Azevedo (1965)  reported that intensive 

"garimpeiros" mining mainly in a locality called "Bastião" (inside of the Property) had taken place. As 

well, Azevado (1965) reported that more than 5,000 garimpeiros looking for gold and diamonds 

recovered some 5,000 stones in the Itapicuru River (the largest stone reported was 10.5 carats). 

 

1980-1998 

Modern systematic exploration for diamonds in the area was initiated in 1980 by De Beers Brasil Ltda. 

The target area within the Braúna project area was chosen based on historical recovery of diamonds by 

garimpeiros in the Itapicuru River Basin, as well as the interpretation of local tectonic features.  The 

initial area of mineral interest was located south of the city of Nordestina and within the Itapicuru River 

Basin. 

 

The initial phase of prospecting by De Beers was restricted to a regional stream sediment sampling 

program.  This program returned negative results.  In 1989 and 1990 a detailed stream sediment sampling 

program was carried out by De Beers.  This survey identified a kimberlite indicator mineral (KIM) 

anomaly: garnets and Cr-spinels that were obtained in samples from the Riacho Grande Creek in the 

Itapicuru River basin.  Follow-up work, including systematic stream and soil sampling, led to the 

discovery of Braúna 1 (B1) and Braúna 2 (B2) dykes and the Braúna 3 kimberlite which at the time was 

interpreted as a blow.  KIM mineral chemistry results from these kimberlitic occurrences were 

characteristic of diamondiferous kimberlite, for which was confirmed by microdiamond analysis.   

 

A limited surface sampling program that was carried out in the mid-1990s by De Beers demonstrated that 

the kimberlitic occurrences on the Property contained macrodiamonds.  The sample volumes were less 

than 5 m
3
 and the largest stones recovered were 0.50 and 0.31 carats.   

 

Detailed soil sampling and ground magnetic surveys were also carried out over the Braúna discovery area.  

The soil sampling survey defined 12 additional dyke-shaped occurrences.  A regional airborne magnetic 

survey was flown at a line spacing of 250 m, covering an area ≈7,600 km
2
, however, no additional 

kimberlitic occurrences were discovered from the follow-up of this airborne survey. 

 

Based on the near surface sample test results which comprised of micro and macrodiamond recovery, 

kimberlite petrography, and KIM geochemistry, the Braúna kimberlite occurrences were deemed to be 

small in size and potential diamond grades to be insufficient to support the development of an economic 

mine based on De Beers threshold criteria at that time.  These poor indications caused De Beers to 

suspend work in this area in 1998, but held the mineral licences until 2004. 

 

2000-2004 

Extensive artisanal mining activity was conducted by Mr. Nélio Amambahy on his farm near the vicinity 

of the B3 kimberlite.  Informal production records from the manual mining operation indicated that 



 

21 

 

during 2000 and 2001, a total of 250 diamonds with a total weight of 372.9 carats were recovered from 

colluvial gravels and soils that were excavated immediately downslope from B3.  Individual diamonds 

reportedly ranged in size from 0.20 carats to 15.5 carats, with a significant portion of the stones falling in 

the 1 to 3 carat range, with an average stone size of 1.49 carats.  The 1.5-2 m thick calcrete cap appeared 

to have prohibited mining of the kimberlite itself. However, a small 8 m deep pit that was excavated 

through the calcrete and into the kimberlite reportedly recovered a 3.55 carat diamond from the pit. 

 

2004 

De Beers signed an agreement with Majescor in December 2004, transferring their 100% interest in the 

Property, which at the time comprised three mineral claims totaling 49 km
2
.  As part of the agreement, De 

Beers provided to Majescor a full data set package (sample results, aeromagnetic surveys, etc.) for the 

claims and additional data covering an Area of Interest of 7.612 km
2
.  The data included airborne 

geophysics flown over the Property, as well as information pertaining to 9,259 samples that were 

collected.  Detailed mineral chemistry results for 22,106 grains recovered from these samples were also 

made available to Majescor.  The Majescor – De Beers agreement provided for an outright purchase of a 

100% interest in the Braúna Property from De Beers for two cash payments totaling $500,000. 

 

2005-2008 

In 2005, Vaaldiam acquired a 60% interest in the Property under the terms of a purchase agreement with 

Majescor, whereby Vaaldiam paid De Beers the sum of $300,000 on behalf of Majescor which 

represented the balance owed by Majescor to De Beers (under the terms of a purchase agreement outlined 

above). In addition, Vaaldiam issued a total of 150,000 common shares to Majescor. 

 

Vaaldiam was designated as the operator of the project and in November 2005, began work on the 

Property.  Work consisted of a detailed review and compilation of all the historic exploration, drilling, 

geophysical survey data, and sample test data completed by De Beers on the Property.  In addition, 

remote sensing data including aerial photographs and satellite images were analyzed and interpreted using 

geological and geophysical maps of different scales.  These preliminary maps were used by Vaaldiam to 

guide planning of the initial field activities, prioritizing known kimberlite bodies and potential kimberlitic 

exploration targets for detailed follow-up exploration work in 2006.  

 

Stream sediment samples were collected by Vaaldiam for KIM analysis on selected small drainage basins 

near known kimberlitic occurrences followed by line cutting and ground magnetic and EM surveys over 

B3, B4 and B7.  Soil samples were collected along the cut grid lines and KIMs were picked from the 

heavy mineral concentrates.   

 

Vaaldiam also carried out a rotary auger hole drilling program to delineate the extent of several kimberlite 

bodies and trenching was used to a limited extent on B8, B18, B19 and B21 to determine the width of the 

kimberlitic occurrences.  Vaaldiam's exploration work yielded seven new kimberlitic occurences. 

 

From 2005-2008, a core drilling program was conducted in two Phases: Phase I from November 2005 to 

August 2006 on B3, B4, B7 and B16 and Phase II from July to December of 2007 on B3, B8 and B21.  

Microdiamond analysis was conducted on drill core composite samples from B3 and B7. 

 

In March 2007, Vaaldiam acquired Majescor's remaining 40% interest in the Property; increasing its 

ownership to 100%.  Under the terms of the agreement, Majescor received a $2,250,000 cash payment, 

$1,500,000 paid in common shares of Vaaldiam, and a 1% Gross Sales Royalty on diamond production 

from the Braúna Property. 

 



 

22 

 

Following the March 2007 agreement with Majescor, Vaaldiam began a mini bulk sampling program.  

Kimberlites targeted included B3, B4, B7, B8, B11, B12, B18, B19 and B21.  Surface shafts were 

excavated to depths of 17 m from surface.

6.0 6.0 Geological Setting 

6.1 Regional Geology 

 

The Property is located in the Serrinha Block of the northern portion of the São Francisco Craton.  The 

Craton is bounded by Neoproterozoic Brasiliano orogenic belts and is partially covered by 

Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic basins (Figure 6.1Figure 6.1). Its Archaean¬Paleoproterozoic 

basement is well exposed in Minas Gerais State, in the south, but it is in Bahia State that the largest and 

most continuous exposures are found.  In Bahia State, the basement has been grouped into three Archean 

blocks: Gavião, Jequié and Serrinha.  The blocks are bounded by the Paleoproterozoic Contendas-

Jacobina basins and the Itabuna-Salvador-Curaçá Orogen (Barbosa and Sabaté, 2004). These blocks are 

composed of gneisses and migmatites, granites and volcano-sedimentary sequences. The Serrinha block 

(see Figure 6.1Figure 6.1) forms a mega-ellipsoidal structure (> 21.000 km
2
) that has remained relatively 

rigid during the Paleoproterozoic Transamazonian collisional/reworking event. During this event the 

structural framework of the Itabuna-Salvador¬ Curaçá orogen, to the west, was formed. In the east, the 

Serrinha block is covered by Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic age sediments. 

 

The lithostratigraphic succession of the Serrinha block consists dominantly of: (i) an Archean basement of 

migmatitic gneisses and calc-alkaline to tonalite-trondhjemite¬granodiorite (TTG) plutons, mostly 

granodiorite with N-S foliation; (ii) volcano-sedimentary sequences of the Paleoproterozoic Rio Itapicuru 

Greenstone Belt ("RIGB") and the Rio Capim Group; and (iii) Paleoproterozoic granitic intrusions (Silva 

et al., 2001; Oliveira et al., 2004; Mello et al., 2006).  Syenites make up a distinct but volumetrically 

minor rock assemblage in the western part of Serrinha block; they postdate the major volcanic-plutonic 

cycles and much of the early deformation (Rios et al., 2007). Previous studies divided the greenstone belt 

supracrustal rocks from bottom to top as a tholeiitic basalt unit with an age of 2,209 Ma, a calc-alkaline 

felsic volcanic unit with an age of about 2,170 Ma (Silva et al., 2001) and a chemical and clastic 

sedimentary unit. Several granitic batholiths and stocks intruded these units during two major episodes; 

the older is dominated by trondhjemitic plutons between the ages of 2.152 Ma and 2.163 Ma, and the 

younger by calc¬ alkaline plutons, lamproites and syenites between the ages of 2,080 Ma and 2,130 Ma 

respectively (Oliveira et al., 2004; Rios et al., 2005, 2007; Mello et al., 2006).

Souza et al., 2003); S=Serrinha, J=Jequié, G=Gavião blocks.  The Serrinha Block and the 

RIGB are shown as an inset (after Oliveira et al., 2004) with the location of the Braúna 

kimberlites within the Nordestina batholith. 

 

The Rio Itapicuru Greenstone Belt ("RIGB"), located in northeastern Brazil, is an important gold 

producing region.  It hosts two important gold mining districts, the Fazenda Brasileiro and the Fazenda 

Maria Preta, owned by Yamana Gold Inc. ("Yamana"), plus a number of gold occurrences that are 

associated with hydrothermal alteration along shear zones. According to Rios et al. (2000), the volcano-

sedimentary sequences of the RIGB and Capim Group ("CG") overlie these Archean age basement 

terrains. The RIGB is interpreted as having been formed in a back-arc basin related to plate collision. The 

majority of the lithostratigraphic units were metamorphosed under greenschist facies conditions during 

the Transamazonic tectono-thermal event with amphibolite facies metamorphism developed only in the 

contact aureoles around granitic intrusions.  

6.2 Property Geology 

 

The Braúna kimberlites are intruded into the Nordestina Batholith a syntectonic granite emplacement 

during the Trans-Amazonian orogeny (see inset in Figure 6.1Figure 6.1).  The batholith (Rios et al, 2000; 



 

25 

 

Cruz Filho et al, 2003) is located in the south-central section of the Serrinha block at the interface 

between migmatitic, gneissic Archean and Paleoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary units of the RIGB in 

eastern Bahia State.  The Nordestina Batholith is a zoned intrusion: foliated and inequigranular, with 

gneissic borders containing schlieren, pegmatites and a porphyritic core. 

 

Twenty-two kimberlitic occurrences have been discovered to date on the Property.  The kimberlitic 

bodies represent a deeply eroded, root zone, with a hypabyssal en echelon dyke system (typically 0.5 to 5 

m in width), with several blows (widening of the dyke perpendicular to strike that are from 0.4 to 1.8 ha) 

identified along the northwest-southeast fissure.  Owing to tropical weathering, exposure of the 

kimberlitic bodies is poor.

7.0 7.0 Deposit Type Models 

7.1 Overview on Primary Diamond Deposits: An Introduction 

 

Diamonds are found in two main deposit types: 1) mantle-derived igneous rocks such as kimberlites and 

lamproites and 2) secondary diamond deposits such as recent to ancient placer deposits. Although 

diamondiferous kimberlite/lamproite makes up most of the economic primary diamond deposits, other 

diamond-bearing rocks have also been discovered and are the subject of numerous academic papers.  

Such diamond-bearing rocks include ultramafic lamprophyres (aillikites) in Canada and volcaniclastic 

komatiites in French Guiana (Capdevila et al., 1999).  It has been established by the scientific community 

that diamond are not genetically related to kimberlite or lamproite but that kimberlite and lamproite serve 

as a transport mechanism for bringing diamonds to surface (Kirkley et.al., 1991).   

 

Clifford (1966) and Janse (1993) have stated that a majority of economic diamondiferous kimberlites 

occur in stable Archean age cratonic material that has not undergone any thermal or deformational event 

since 2.5 Ga (Figure 7.1).  Such Archean age cratons include the Kaapvaal, Congo and West African 

Cratons in Africa, Superior and Slave Provinces in Canada, East European Craton (Russia, Finland, etc.), 

and the West, North and South Australia Cratons.  The only exceptions to date are the Argyle and 

Ellendale Mines of Australia since they occur in Proterozoic age remobilized cratonic material. 

 

Globally, there are more than 6,000 known kimberlite and lamproite occurrences, of which over 1,000 are 

diamondiferous.  Some of the well-known diamondiferous kimberlite/lamproite mines currently being 

mined include are Argyle (lamproite) in Australia, Orapa and Jwaneng (kimberlite) in Botswana, Jubilee, 

Udachnaya and Mir (kimberlites) in Russia, Venetia (kimberlite) in South Africa, and Ekati (kimberlite) 

and Diavik (kimberlite) in Canada.  

 

Economic diamond kimberlite and/or lamproite pipes range from less than 0.4 ha in size to 146 ha with 

the maximum size being +200 ha (i.e.; Fort à la Corne, Saskatchewan Canada).  Diamond grades can 

range from 3.5 carats per 100 tonnes (cpht) to 600 cpht.

7.2 Kimberlite 

 

The following discussion of kimberlite types and deposits is taken directly from a publication on ore 

deposit models by Mitchell (1991). 

 

Kimberlites remain the principal source of primary diamond despite the discovery of high grade deposits 

in lamproites.  Recent mineralogical and Nd-Sr isotopic studies have shown that two varieties of 

kimberlite exist: 

 

 Group 1 or olivine rich monticellite serpentine calcite kimberlites; 

 Group 2 or micaceous kimberlites. 
 

7.2.1 Group 1 Kimberlites 

 

"Group 1 kimberlites are complex hybrid rocks consisting of minerals that may be derived from (1) the 

fragmentation of upper mantle xenoliths (including diamond), (2) the megacryst or discrete nodule suite, 

and (3) the primary phenocrysts and groundmass minerals.  The contribution to the overall mineralogy 

from each source varies widely and significantly influences the petrographic character of the rocks.  

Consequently, Group 1 kimberlites comprise a petrological clan of rocks that exhibit wide differences in 

appearance and mineralogy as a consequence of the above variation, coupled with differentiation and 

diverse styles of emplacement of the magma" (Mitchell, 1991).

Figure 7.2Figure 7.2 illustrates an idealized kimberlite magmatic system, showing the relationships 

between effusive rocks, diatremes and hypabyssal rocks.  Currently, three textural-genetic groups of 

kimberlite are recognized, each being associated with a particular style of magmatic activity in such a 

system.  These are: (1) crater facies, (2) diatreme facies and, (3) hypabyssal facies.  Rocks belonging to 

each facies differ in their petrology and primary mineralogy, but may contain similar xenocrystal and 

megacrystal assemblages (Mitchell, 1991) (Figure 7.2Figure 7.2). 

 

With a few exceptions such as the Finsch Kimberlite Mine in RSA and the Dokolwayo Kimberlite Mine 

in Swaziland, most of the well-known diamondiferous kimberlite in South Africa and elsewhere are 

Group 1 kimberlites.

7.2.2 Mineralogy of Kimberlites 
 

Diamonds occur as rare xenoliths in kimberlite.  In early stages of exploration and evaluation when only 

samples of limited size can be collected, the mineral chemistry of other more commonly occurring mantle 

minerals (KIMs) are regularly used as proxies to evaluate the diamond potential of a host rock.   

 



 

29 

 

The presence and geochemistry of KIMs can be used to assess the potential presence and abundance of 

diamonds: KIM geochemistry is an important guide to the kimberlite's economic potential. However, 

there are numerous kimberlites with excellent geochemistry that do not have diamonds and conversely, 

there are examples of economic kimberlites that lack favourable KIM geochemistry. 

 

Favourable characteristics of KIMs for potential economic concentrations of diamonds within a 

kimberlite are as follows: 

 

 Garnet:  Peridotitic paragenesis based upon position in diamond stability field.  G10 (85% 
or Gurney line) from garnet harzburgite source, high Cr2O3 low CaO G9 from lherzolitic 

garnet rocks.  Eclogitic paragenesis generally defined as less than 1wt.% Cr2O3, some use 2 

wt.% as guide. G10 classification is less definitive than for peridotitic paragenesis. 

Secondary indicator sodium (Na) required for favourability for diamonds, enrichment in 

Na (>0.06-0.07 wt.% Na2O). 

 Chromite: From chromite harzburgite. Average Cr content >60 wt.% Cr2O3 with moderate 
to high levels of magnesium (12-16 wt.% MgO). Characterized by very low TiO2 (<0.3 

wt.%), but 0.6 wt.% TiO2 may be definitive in rare cases. 

 Cr-Diopside: This clinopyroxene is characterized by its distinctive bright green colour. 
Generally Cr-diopside do not survive extensive transport, thus can be very distinctive in 

regional or local sampling of glacial or fluvial regimes. They exhibit a wide range of 

compositions even within diamondiferous samples. 

 Picro ilmenite: Mg-rich ilmenites, generally with >4 wt.% MgO and <1% Cr2O3. When 
wt.% of  Al2O3 and FeO are <1.2 wt.% and 30 wt.%, respectively, it is an indication of low 

levels of oxidation and a possible indicator of diamond preservation.  This, however, may 

not work well in all environments (i.e., works well in South African Kaapvaal Craton, but 

not in Slave Province of the Canadian Shield). 

 Olivine: Mineral chemistry not diagnostic, however size and abundance is often correlated 
to that of diamond, when it is present.   

 

Although the interpretation of mineral chemistry can be misleading for determining the diamond potential 

on a per kimberlite or kimberlite field basis, kimberlite indicator mineral geochemistry is a proven global 

diamond exploration tool. 

 

7.2.3 Braúna Kimberlite Geology 
 

The Braúna kimberlite field consists of twenty-two kimberlite "occurrences", defined as kimberlite rock 

that has been discovered at or near surface.  The kimberlite occurrences occur as elongated dykes or 

larger blows that are emplaced along an elongated northwest-southeast fissure system.  The larger 

expressions of kimberlite can be up to 2 hectares; however, substantial internal dilution of country rock 

material may be included in the interpreted extent of individual occurrences.  The geology of the 

kimberlite is complex, and is characterized by kimberlitic dykes and wider blows with multiple irregular 

petrographic facies that have intruded the Nordestina Batholith (Figure 7.3)  



 

30 

 

 

Figure 7.3. Location of the Braúna kimberlite occurrences.  The intrusions are tabular dykes up to 

300 m along strike or elliptical blows up to 2 ha in size (i.e., B3). 

 

 

Other kimberlite bodies which have had additional systematic exploration work carried out by Vaaldiam 

(core drilling and mini bulk sampling) include the Braúna 4, (B4), Braúna 7 (B7), Braúna 8 (B8) and 

Braúna 21 (B21).  All of these particular kimberlite bodies range in size from a few metres in width (B8 

and B21) to larger blows along fissure / dike systems (B4 and B7 are ≈0.5 and 2.5 ha in area).  
 

Petrologically, the Braúna kimberlites are classified as hypabyssal macrocrystic phlogopite kimberlite.  

Macrocrysts of phlogopite, diopside, garnet, Cr-spinel and minor ilmenite occur in varying amounts, with 

abundant groundmass phlogopite ± apatite, ilmenite and perovskite.  The matrix varies from uniform to 
segregation-textured and is comprised of calcite and serpentine, with minor chlorite (Pisani et al., 2001; 

Donatti Filho et. al., 2008). The kimberlites are iron-rich with Mg # of 85.6 - 89.1, and have geochemical 

characteristics transitional between Group II kimberlites and olivine lamproite (Donatti Filho et. al., 

2008).   

 

Kimberlite morphology for the majority of the kimberlitic bodies based on geophysical data and limited 

drilling are generally complex, however, the B3 kimberlite morphologyis well defined based on core 

drilling data.  The majority of the kimberlite bodies exhibit irregular shapes and complex contacts and 

associations with the country rock (when observed in drillcore).  As well, the kimberlite bodies are 

considered to be the root zones of deeply eroded kimberlite pipes and that the kimberlite emplacement 

was structurally controlled by the country rock.  It can be expected that the walls of the kimberlite dykes 

and blows are not smooth regular surfaces (like kimberlite pipes), but may have numerous morphological 

irregularities such as an embayment, outwardly dipping contacts, overhangs and irregular splitting or 



 

31 

 

appendages.  For some of the kimberlite bodies, there can be a large amount of local internal dilution, and 

often it is not clear whether country rock is in situ wall rock or xenolithic material.  Autoliths of earlier 

crystallized kimberlitic material are not uncommon; indicating that the kimberlite magma was emplaced 

over a period of time.  The texture of the kimberlite can vary greatly such as seen from the flow 

differentiation results in sorting and alignment of fragments creating both gradational or sharp, but 

irregular contacts within the kimberlite. 

 

Geochronologically, a 682 ± 20 Ma Rb-Sr age was obtained on phlogopite for B3 and Ar-Ar in garnet for 

B7 yielded 736 ± 14 Ma (Pisani et al. 2001).  An Ar-Ar age of 1,279 ± 127 Ma has been reported for B8, 

however this age is unsourced and cannot be confirmed, but it would suggest at least two phases of 

kimberlite emplacement may have occurred within the Braúna Field: an earlier Mesoproterozoic event 

followed by a mid-Neoproterozoic activity.  The earlier kimberlite event would represent one of the oldest 

known diamondiferous kimberlite events.   

 

7.2.3.1 Geology of B3 
 

The B3 kimberlite is the largest of the kimberlitic bodies on the Property and has been the focus of 

extensive core drilling and mini bulk sampling by Vaaldiam.  Information derived from the core drilling 

and mini bulk sampling programs indicates that the shape of the B3 kimberlite is irregular and elliptical in 

plan view and elongated in a NW-SE direction.   

 

B3 is comprised of 2 lobes: North and South with a separate interconnecting central lobe that is 

interpreted to be dike-like in shape (see Figure 9.7).  In plan view, both are similar in gross surface area, 

but the North lobe contains significantly more country rock, both as internal dilution and as in situ wall 

rock (Maunula, 2006).

B3 is overlain by <5 m of overburden, which is comprised of soil, calcrete and broken rock (saprolitic 

kimberlite and granite).  The B3 kimberlite is weathered at surface and the saprolitic horizon can extend 

beyond 15 m at depth.  Beneath the saprolite horizon, the unweathered kimberlite is weakly altered as no 

primary olivine grains remain in the kimberlite matris.  However, the kimberlite matrix is very competent 

and dense (bulk densities of ≈2.65-2.7 g/cm
3
 versus <1.4-1.9 g/cm

3
 in the saprolitic horizon). 

 

7.2.3.2 Petrography of the Braúna Kimberlites 
 

In general, the Braúna kimberlites are described as macrocrystal hypabyssal phlogopite kimberlites that 

are also termed "breccias" when the content of crustal xenoliths exceeds 15% of volume of the rock. The 

close association of the B3 kimberlite with the granitic country rock is exhibited by the presence of 

abundant xenoliths, in situ, blocks and intercalations of the country rock within the kimberlite. 

 

Each kimberlite occurrence is comprised of numerous and highly complex textures typical of hypabyssal 

kimberlites.  These include flow textureswhereby the alignment and sorting of olivine macrocrysts are 

commonly observed at the contacts in the B3 kimberlite (Figure 7.5Figure 7.5). The individual kimberlitic 

units are often crosscut by carbonate veins, lesser serpentine, and a rare blue form of amphibole.  Angular 

fragments of country rock also comprise a minor component to kimberlitic autoliths that are often coarser 

grained than their host, are common (Figure 7.6Figure 7.6).  The country rock xenoliths are usually 

altered to varying degrees whereas the smaller fragments may be entirely "kimberlitized". 

 

Macrocrystic olivine and lesser megacrystic olivine comprise 10-20% of the B3 and B7 kimberlites.  

Typically, the macrocrystic olivine iscompletely altered, but the serpentinized pseudomorphs after olivine 

clearly preserve the original macrocryst content.  Alteration of olivine is common in hypabyssal 

kimberlites; gases cannot escape from the kimberlite and hence, react with the kimberlite.  

 

The groundmass of the kimberlite bodies is typically fine grained to well crystallized, but invariably 

micaceous (phlogopite).  Segregation textures are not atypical, especially in the South lobe of B3.  There 

are several types of segregations, including the segregation or coarse phlogopite and carbonate crystals 

(and lesser serpentine). 

 

Other important constituents of the Braúna kimberlites include mantle xenoliths and xenocrysts.  

Individual fragments can range up to 8 cm in size, but typically are <1cm and comprise less than 1% of 

the volume of the B3 kimberlite (local variability).  The abundance and grain size of mantle material 

appear to have a close positive correlation with the abundance and grain size of the olivine 

macrocrysts/megacrysts present. Mantle xenoliths are typically partially to completely altered and are 

often identified by the presence of altered garnet, the most common mantle xenocryst.  In B3, the 

population of garnet xenocrysts includes orange eclogitic garnet, various-coloured peridotitic (pink, red 

and burgundy) garnet, and lesser purplish-coloured harzburgitic garnets (Figure 7.7).  

 

Other mantle xenocrysts/macrocrysts include large phlogopite macrocrysts/megacrysts (up to several 

centimetres in size), black spinel, and magnetite/chromite.  Ilmenite has not been observed in any of the 

core samples. Rare apple-green chrome diopside only occurs as inclusions in olivine megacrysts (see 

Figure 7.9), and discrete grains have not been observed.

7.2.3.3 B3 Kimberlite Units 

 

The following is a summary of the main kimberlite units of B3: 

 

1. MHPK: Macrocrystic hypabyssal phlogopite kimberlite.  The most common unit.  An 
inequigranular texture composed of 15-25% of rounded olivine pseudomorphs and irregular 

phlogopite grains. Olivine typically is serpentinized; however, some fresh olivine occurrences 

locally. 

 

2. MHK:  Macrocrystic hypabyssal kimberlite.  Inequigranular texture composed of 15-25% of 
rounded olivine pseudomorphs and irregular phlogopite grains. Olivine typically is 

serpentinized; however, some fresh olivine occurrences locally.  Howe is of the opinion that 

this unit is also a phlogopite kimberlite with a finer groundmass than MHPK 

 

3. SHK: Segregation-textured hypabyssal kimberlite.  Heterogeneous; has less olivine (10-15%) 
compared to the other units and the matrix is segregation-textured.  Subspherical and tabular 

carbonate laths typical of a late crystallizing phase are macroscopically observable within the 

oxide-poor segregations. 

 



 

36 

 

Petrographic gradation exists between these end members and as such, the classification is largely 

subjective.  In addition to these main units, the following sub-units have also been described: 

 

1. MGHPK: Megacrystic hypabyssal phlogopite kimberlite (Figure 7.8). 
 

2. HPK: Hypabyssal phlogopite kimberlite.  Unit is differentiated from MHK or MHPK by 
an aphanitic texture, i.e., <5% olivine macrocrysts.   

 

If any of the above units contain >15 vol. % country rock material, the unit is described as a breccia, i.e., 

MHPKB (macrocrystic hypabyssal kimberlite breccia).  Xenoliths of granitic country rock comprise >15 

vol. % of the intersection.  The granitic xenoliths are commonly rounded and altered (typical of hot 

hypabyssal kimberlite magma).  MHPKB has also been described as containing more common mantle 

material than the other kimberlite units. 

 

The main variations between the different kimberlitic units include the size and abundance olivine 

macrocrysts, the visual abundance of groundmass phlogopite, and the texture of the matrix (uniform to 

segregationary, see Figure 7.12).  A greater amount of groundmass phlogopite has been typically 

described in breccia units. 

 

Textures typical of the three main units observed in B3 are shown in Figure 7.10.  Other characteristic 

textures are shown in Figure 7.11Figure 7.11.

7.2.4 Mineralogy of the Braúna Kimberlites (B3, B4, and B7) 
 

In limited cases, heavy mineral concentrates from either rock or loam samples were submitted by 

Vaaldiam for microprobe analysis.  A limited suite of garnet, ilmenite, chromite, and Cr-diopside oxide 

data for B3, B4 and B7 were available to plot on standard geochemical diagrams for analysis purposes.  

Visual interpretation of the scatter plots is a useful aid to determining the diamond potential of the source 

rock.   

 

 
 

Figure 7.13. Braúna Eclogite Garnet Ti-Na Scatter plot. 

 

The garnet Ca-Cr scatter plot (Figure 7.13Figure 7.13) shows that the garnet population from the Braúna 

kimberlites are dominantly lherzolitic (G9) although a few plot (B3 and B4) within the harzburgite (G10) 

field.   

 

Most of the Cr-diopside from the B3, B7 and B4 kimberlite bodies plot within the defined diamond 

inclusion field (Figure 7.14).  In comparison, only a small proportion of the chromite grains from each 

kimberlite body plot within the corresponding diamond inclusion field.

Figure 7.14. Braúna kimberlite Cr-diopside Ca-Cr scatter plot. 

 

 

Figure 7.15. Braúna kimberlite chromite Cr-Mg Scatter plot. 

 

Minor concentrations of ilmenite are present in the Braúna kimberlites.  Evaluation of the mantle 

oxidation state and thus "diamond preservation potential" is shown by plotting a Cr2O3 vs. MgO scatter 

plot (Haggerty, 1975) in Figure 7.16Figure 7.16.  A majority of the ilmenite from B3 have a mineral 

chemistry consistent with a more "reducing" environment, indicative of higher diamond preservation 

potential.  B7 contains ilmenite from both "reducing" and "oxidizing" environments, whilst too few 

ilmenites were recovered from B4 to draw any meaningful interpretation / conclusion.   

 



 

43 

 

 

Figure 7.16. Braúna kimberlite ilmenite Cr-Mg scatter plot. 

 

 

Figure 7.17. Braúna eclogitic garnet scatter plot. 

 

The eclogitic garnet scatter plot shows that the B3, B4 and B7 kimberlites have a component of eclogite 

that was derived under mantle conditions conducive to development of diamonds.  Eclogitic nodules 

(mantle xenoliths), and by extension eclogitic diamond sources, have been observed to have very high 

diamond grades in some kimberlites worldwide. 

 

 



 

44 

 

 

Figure 7.18. Braúna eclogite garnet Ti-Na scatter plot. 

 

Th kimberlitic indicator mineral geochemistry results suggests that the Braúna kimberlites, and in 

particular the B3 and Braúna 4 pipes, have excellent potential for favourable diamond grades and larger 

stones due to the entrainment of diamondiferous eclogitic and peridotitic mantle rock.  Some of the most 

prolific and high quality diamond mines in the world have come from kimberlites having a mixed 

peridotitic and eclogitic source including Jwaneng in Botswana, Premier in South Africa, and Letseng La 

Terae in Lesotho. 

 

7.2.5 Geochemistry 
 

Whole rock geochemistry data for a sample from B3 are shown in Table 7.1 and Table 7.2.  Compared to 

the average major element compositions of other kimberlites, the sample from the B3 kimberlite is 

characterized by elevated values of SiO2, Al2O and K2O.  The B3 sample also has high concentrations of 

Ni and Cr (1316 ppm and 1096 ppm, respectively).  Trace element (TE) abundances normalized to the 

primitive mantle values show extreme LREE enrichment and depletion in HREEs, coupled with negative 

anomalies at K, Pb, Sr and Zr (Figure 7.19).

According to Tainton (1993), the incompatible element (IE) geochemistry confirms the Group I 

kimberlite character of the incompatible element geochemistry of unaltered samples from the B3 

kimberlite. The sample from B3 consistently plots in the Group I kimberlite field on standard 

geochemical discrimination plots.

7.3 Diamonds 

 

Once discovered, determination of grade and quality of the diamonds present becomes a sampling 

exercise.  Initial sampling of kimberlite is commonly completed through dissolution via caustic fusion of 

kimberlite, commonly drill core, generally in 20 to 50 kg samples. This allows the recovery of all 

diamonds, micro and macro, and the normalization of these samples to an acceptable standard (~50 kg) 

which gives a positive indication of whether or not further work is warranted. Comparison with other 

deposits will determine the need for subsequent sampling and treatment through a laboratory or pilot-

scale treatment plant. The objective is to recover sufficient diamonds (3,000 to 5,000 carats) so that both 

the stones' quality and value can be estimated. 

 

In regions where a caustic fusion laboratory is unavailable, it is also possible to take mini bulk samples of 

50 to 100 tonnes to give a good determination of the macrodiamond (>1mm) content of a kimberlite with 

favourable indicator mineral geochemistry. Processing is commonly completed through the use of a jig or 

other type of gravity separation plant. This method can be used to prioritize and test targets. Economic 

kimberlite pipes range in size and grades. Grades vary within each facies and grades of kimberlites can 



 

47 

 

also be quite variable. Grades of economic kimberlites range from 3 carats per hundred tonnes at Frank 

Smith in South Africa to an average mine grade of 3.9 carats per tonne for the four kimberlite pipes at the 

Diavik mine in Canada (Rio Tinto, 2002).  By contrast, the Argyle lamproite in Australia has historically 

had a diamond grade of approximately 6 carats per tonne and the average carat values were low (<US$10 

per carat).   

 

Diamond grade can be affected by many factors depending on the mantle-source and subsequent 

processes that affect the kimberlite melt. Resorption will commence during magma production and ascent 

if conditions move outside the diamond stability field (Moore and Gurney, 1989; Ramsay, 1992). 

Additionally, dilution of diamonds by contamination of the host melt with country rocks may occur 

during emplacement (Jaques et al., 1986). After emplacement, enrichment of diamonds at the surface 

occurs by leaching of more mobile components during weathering of the host intrusion, leaving a residue 

of higher-density resistate minerals within the soil profile (Jaques et al., 1986). 

 

In the commercial assessment of a kimberlitic rock, determination of diamond grade is difficult and 

expensive due to the high costs of processing large (1,000-10,000t) samples to reliably recover relatively 

low concentrations of diamonds (Smith et al., 1991). In contrast, indicator mineral analysis, which 

provides an indication of potentially diamondiferous source regions and diamond preservation potential 

(Moore and Gurney, 1989; Smith et al., 1991), is more cost-effective. In addition, the effects of country 

rock dilution and surface enrichment can be determined at low cost by petrological and bulk-rock 

geochemical analysis (Jaques et al., 1986). 

 

World diamond production is in the order of 100 million carats per year. In 1997, the Argyle deposits of 

Western Australia (the world's largest producer) produced 40.2 million carats from ore grading 3.7 carats 

per tonne. Highly variable grades can make the value of ore in US dollars per carat quite unpredictable. 

Diamonds fall into one of four categories. They are, in order of decreasing value: gem, near-gem, 

industrial and boart. Individual diamonds are measured in carats (1 carat equals 0.2 grams), whereas the 

grade of diamondiferous rock is expressed in carats per tonne (or carats per 100 tonnes). 

 

The quality of the diamonds is extremely important for a kimberlite deposit.  Average diamond prices can 

vary from an average of US$9 per carat at Mbuji Mayi in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 

several hundred dollars per carat at a kimberlite with high quality large stones (Jennings, 1995).

9.0 9.0 Exploration 

9.1 Overview 
 

The initial phase of prospecting on the Property was completed by De Beers in 1980 and it consisted of a 

regional low density and low volume stream sampling program.  No KIMs were recovered from this 

program. 

 

In 1989 and 1990, a new stream sediment sampling program was carried out by De Beers whereby a 

higher stream sediment sample density produced a garnet and Cr-spinels anomaly in the Itapicuru River 

basin.  Follow up stream and soil sampling led to the discovery of the B1 and B2 kimberlite bodies which 

are both narrow kimberlite dykes and the B3 blow, all distinguished by mineral chemistry characteristic 

of diamondiferous kimberlites (see Section 7.2.2).  This association was confirmed through 

microdiamond ("MiDa") analysis.  Further soil sampling and ground magnetic ("mag") surveys were 

targeted over the B1 and B2 kimberlite discovery area.  As illustrated in Figure 9.1, soil sampling by De 

Beers helped define an additional 12 kimberlite anomalies on the Property for follow-up work. 

 

 
 

Figure 9.1. Kimberlite soil anomalies identified by garnet grain counts by  

De Beers 

  

A regional airborne magnetic survey was commissioned by De Beers whereby an area of 7,600 km
2
 at a 

line spacing of 250 m was flown. The airborne survey failed to identify any additional kimberlite 

anomalies. 



 

50 

 

 

Upon completion of the the JV agreement with Majescor in 2006, Vaaldiam immediately started a 

Property assessment and delineation program on the most prospective kimberlite occurrences on the 

Property. 

 

The following sections provide an overview of the exploration activities carried out on the Property by 

Vaaldiam.  More detailed descriptions and results are provided for work targeting the B3 kimberlite.  

 

 

9.2 Soil Sampling 
 

In 2005 as a follow up to historical alluvial or stream sediment sampling, Vaaldiam conducted a limited 

soil and stream sampling program to follow up historical alluvial and stream sediment anomalies near 

known kimberlite occurrences.  This work did not result in further kimberlitic discoveries, but did support 

the earlier results reported by De Beers. 

 

Since soil sampling was a useful tool in recovering KIMs in heavy mineral concentrates from samples 

collected over or very near to a known kimberlite, Vaaldiam collected soil samples along the cut lines of 

several geophysical grids (see Section 9.3).  The samples were panned, sieved, and cleaned in the field, 

yielding a heavy mineral concentrate.   

 

In 2008, Vaaldiam completed a detailed grid soil sampling program over a vegetation anomaly near B3.  

Garnets were recovered at several sample sites and trencheswere excavated.  However, hard ground 

precluded deep excavation, the trenching program was abandoned without reaching kimberlite (fresh or 

unweathered).   

 

9.3 Ground Geophysics 

 

In October 2005, Vaaldiam mobilized an exploration crew to the Property in order to complete a detailed 

ground magnetic and EM survey.  Kimberlites targeted for delineation core drilling and surface sampling 

were targeted as follows B3, B4 and B7. The geophysical surveys were carried out in three stages: line 

cutting, ground magnetic surveys and electromagnetic surveys in three different small blocks (mini blocks 

B3, B4 and B7).  A total of 40.7 line km of reference grid was established over the three blocks (Table 

9.1; Figure 9.2)

the three main grids.  Line spacings were at 25 m.  The magnetic maps shows analytical 

signal processed from total field magnetics. 

 

The following summarizes the field work done on each mini block: 

 

1. The centre point of the anomaly was located with GPS coordinates obtained from the 

aeromagnetic maps.  

2. Stations were measured every 25 m along cut lines and a crew with 2 operators collected 

data with magnetometers. 

3. Soil and stream sediment samples were collected following the grid. 



 

52 

 

4. Collected data was corrected for diurnal variation in this region that was obtained from a 

stationary base station and magnetic intensity maps were plotted 

5. The ground magnetic data was processed by Reconsult Geofisica (Reconsult). Magnetic 

maps are shown in Figure 9.2.

Property showing the structurally controlled magnetic highs representing the Braúna 

kimberlite pipes and dykes.  The survey led to the discovery of B16, B18 and B19. 

 



 

53 

 

In December 2005, Vaaldiam extended the grid to 4,000 x 5,000 m, which covered much of licences 

870.908/1999 and 870.909/1999.  The objective of an expanded magnetic survey was to identify 

additional kimberlitic occurrences around B3, B4 and B7.  A total of 186 line-km of data was collected at 

50 m line spacing, with readings taken at 25 m station intervals.  Numerous ground magnetic anomalies 

were identified of which many were related to known kimberlitic occurrences (Figure 9.3Figure 9.3).  

New ground magnetic anomalies were tested by trenching and auger drilling, eventually leading to the 

discovery of Braúna 16 (B16), Braúna 18 (B18) and Braúna 19 (B19) kimberlite bodies.   

 

In early 2006, the previous ground magnetic surveys over B3, B4 and B7 were re-surveyed at 25 m line 

spacings and data were collected at 10 m station intervals.  The same lines were used to complete a 

MaxMin survey, but readings were spaced at 50 m line spacing and 25 m station intervals (Figure 

9.4Figure 9.4).  Each survey collected 75.9 line-km of additional data.  Data were processed by Reconsult 

and the results were used to define the extent of the individual kimberlite bodies and to plan a delineation 

drill program.   

 

 

 

Figure 9.4. 2006 ground EM surveys.  Vaaldiam collected data at 25 m station intervals along 50 m 

line spacing.  EM conductors are evident on all three frequencies for each kimberlite 

occurrence. 

 

In October 2007, Vaaldiam cut a 40.9 line-km grid over an area covering B1, B2 and B8.  Field data was 

collected by Vaaldiam and the geophysical data obtained was interpreted by Reconsult.  As with the 

previous ground magnetic surveys, the objective was to identify additional kimberlitic occurrences by 

collecting detailed ground magnetic data and soil prospecting for KIMs.  This work led to the discovery 

of the Braúna 21 (B21) kimberlite.

9.4 Auger Drilling and Trenching 
 

De Beers utilized trenching for verification of kimberlites and to collect small mini bulk samples from 

surface.  Few complete records exist on this work and Howe has made no attempt to verify the data 

collected. 

 

Vaaldiam completed a manual rotary auger drilling on the Property, mainly targeting B8 and B21.  

Trenching was also carried out on B8, B18, B19 and B21 to confirm the presence of kimberlite and 

delineate the width of each occurrence.  However, no material collected from auger drilling or surface 

trenching was tested for diamonds or KIMs. 

 

9.5 Core Drilling 

 

Vaaldiam mobilized three drill rigs to the Property in late 2005, marking the beginning of core drilling, 

which was to continue into 2007.  Drilling was divided into two Phases in order to test six kimberlites 

(see Table 9.3Table 9.3).  The drilling program focused on delineating B3, but also including B4, B7, B8, 

B16 and B21.  A total of 105 NQ-sized holes, totaling 14,510.3 m of core were completed on the 

Property. Eighty-five of the drill holes intersected kimberlite.  Holes ranged in depth from 50 to 230 m.   

 



 

55 

 

The Phase I drill program was conducted between November 2005 and August 2006, where a total of 

5,516.05 m of core was drilled on the B3, B4, B7, and B16 kimberlite bodies.  Phase II commenced in 

July of 2007 and was completed in December 2008.  A total of 8,994.25 m of core was drilled at the B3, 

B8 and B21 kimberlite bodies.  Vaaldiam completed the core logging and summarized the summarized 

the results of the Phase I and II drill program in an internal report (Donatti, 2008).  Table 9.3Table 9.3 

shows a breakdown of drilling in each of the two phases.  

 

9.6 B3 Core Drilling 

 

A total of 74 NQ cored holes were completed on B3: 53 vertical and 21 holes inclined at -45°, totaling 

10,896.1 m.  Hole depths ranged from 50 to 230 m.  Table 9.2Table 9.2 summarizes the drilling statistics 

for B3.

Figure 9.7 

Figure 9.7 shows the drill hole traces and simplified lithology of the B3 kimberlite in plan and in cross-

section (looking from northwest to southeast).  The surface area of the kimberlite is estimated to be 2 ha, 

and kimberlite has been intersected to depths >200 m in the South lobe (intersection open at depth).  The 

cross-section clearly shows that the South lobe has less internal dilution, particularly below ≈60m, 
whereas drill holes in the North lobe intersected a great deal of granitic country rock as both internal 

dilution and wall rock.  The B3 North lobe has been interpreted by Vaaldiam as being dike-like shape.  

The soil depth is typically <3 m (but can be absent), whereas kimberlite has been weathered to saprolite to 



 

58 

 

depths of 15 m.  On average, B3 is covered by 1.5 m of overburden that comprises soil, broken rock and 

calcrete or saprolite from kimberlite or granite.

9.8 Core Logging and Data Collection 
 

9.8.1 Core Logging  
 

Geological and geotechnical core logs were compiled for each drill hole.  The data collected were 

appropriate for this phase of exploration.  The geological core log included a general description of the 

intersection more detailed observation with respect to texture, macrocryst, xenocryst (mantle/crustal), 

xenoliths (mantle/crustal) and alteration.  Geotechnical data collected included magnetic susceptibility, 

density (field data) and core recovery.  Each core box was photographed and representative samples were 

then collected for storage.  In addition, each drill hole has a location coordinate (x, y and z), an azimuth 

and date drilled.   

 

Logged intervals were assigned a kimberlite unit (see Section 7.2.3.3) based on dominate features 

observed.  Howe is of the opinion that the units described in an individual occurrence do not represent 

separate phases of kimberlite magma, but are a result of emplacement processes.  However, no 

geochemical or mineralogical data has been collected to support or refute this assertion.   

 

9.8.2 Photography  
 

Photographs of the core were taken with a 4.4 megapixel Canon Powershot A520.  Three types of photos 

were taken: core box photographs, representative sequence photographs, and detailed photographs.  

 

9.9 Kimberlite Density 
 

The density of the kimberlite was determined by calculating the measured weight (mass) versus volume 

of each core sample using a water displacement method.  Pieces of whole, competent, unweathered 

kimberlite core ranging in size from 5 to 30 cm long were selected every 10 m, or at least one from every 

lithological interval when less than 10 m. A total of 1,318 density measurements were collected from drill 

core during the Phase I and II drilling programs.  Values for kimberlite range from 2.65 g/cm
3
 to 2.94 

g/cm
3
.  In general, density measurements were higher for core having more visible phlogopite.  

 

In December of 2009, an additional 13 density measurements were obtained from saprolitic and 

calcretized kimberlite grab samples of broken material from surface material collected at the B3 South 

lobe.  The results ranged from 1.62 g/cm
3
 to 2.33 g/cm

3
, indicating that the overlying weathered 

kimberlite has a substantially lower density.  Data collection was far from ideal; the rock was friable and 

usually quite irregular in shape.  Although a water displacement method was used, the core had to be 

wrapped tightly with plastic and tape to minimize water absorption into pore spaces.  The density values 

for the saprolitic material are considered gross approximations; however, they were taken to demonstrate 

that weathered kimberlite is significantly less dense. 

 

9.10 Magnetic Susceptibility 
 

Magnetic susceptibility measurements were taken using an Exploranium KT-9 Kappameter Susceptibility 

Meter along the entire length of each drill hole for both the Phase I and II drill programs. Three 

measurements were taken per 1 m of core, and averaged to provide a single measurement per metre (10
-3

 

SI units). Each magnetic susceptibility measurement could vary significantly within a short distance.  Due 

to this variation and the overall low magnetic susceptibility of the kimberlite, anomalous values were re-

measured to remove erratic "spikes" from the data.  Negative values were recorded as zero.

9.11 Microdiamond Analysis 
 

Ten drill holes from the Phase I drill program were selected for MiDa processing by caustic fusion.  

Twelve samples were prepared and processed; 10 at SGS Canada Inc. in Lakefield, Ontario and 2 at 

RTDM Ltda's laboratory in Brasilia ("Rio Tinto").  Each kimberlite interval was cut longitudinally; half 

was retained in the core box, the other added to the MiDa sample.  The samples submitted to Rio Tinto 

were duplicate samples.  Each sample was a composite of the drill hole, i.e., kimberlite was collected 

from each kimberlite intersection throughout the hole and not by depth.   DNPM representatives visited 

the Property in October of 2006 to seal and release the drums, following DNPM requirements for 

diamond sample collection in the presence of Vaaldiam staff in accordance with DNPM 

kimberlite/diamond sample shipment.  All samples and drums were inspected, documented and secured.  

Vaaldiam also maintained a well-documented chain of custody for the MiDa samples. 

 

Rio Tinto employed caustic fusion to produce a resistate concentrate that was then picked.  Material 

preparation for the core samples were prepared for processing by first being pulverized to <5 mm in a jaw 

crusher followed by secondary crushing through a rolls crusher, then washed in a scrubber.  The material 

was de-watered and sized over a 0.125 mm screen to remove fines and then dried.  Dissolution of the 

fines in caustic soda was the final processing step.  Rio Tinto had a QA/QC system in place in which each 

sample was spiked with 30 synthetic diamonds of varying size.  All were recovered during the picking.  

Recovered natural diamonds were weighed, photographed, and described. 

 

SGS's MiDa analysis procedure (certified to ISO 17025) varied slightly to Rio Tinto's, starting with the 

division of each sample's sized charges of <8 kg.  Sample fragments larger than 8 cm were either broken, 

crushed or attrition milled to reduce particle size.  After caustic dissolution, the samples were poured onto 

a 0.105 mm screen.  The NaOH was dissolved and washed; the +0.105 mm concentrate was dried and 

screened on a Tyler #6 mesh screen to remove undigested material.  If a significant amount of +6 mesh 

material remained, or if the material contained possible diamondiferous rock fragments, the material was 

reprocessed.  Otherwise, the residue was magnetically separated and the non-magnetic residue was picked 

twice by different pickers. 

 

SGS had a QA/QC program in place and reported results of 89% recovery of fine synthetic diamonds and 

89% of courser synthetics.  Results were reported in a Certificate of Analysis and included a description, 

size and weight (mg and carats) of the diamonds.  The MiDa results are summarized in Table 9.5and 

duplicates in Table 9.6Table 9.6.  

 

Results of duplicate analysis are inconclusive.  It is not a statistically representative test.  Moreover, the 

nature of diamond mineralization (extreme nugget effect) casts doubt on any small-scale duplicate sample 

data analysis.

9.12 Mini Bulk Sampling 
 

A mini bulk sampling program was carried out by Vaaldiam on the Property, targeting 9 kimberlite 

occurrences with 22 individual shafts.  The results provided Vaaldiam with an initial macrodiamond 

grade assessment to direct further exploration and evaluation on the Property. 

 

Each shaft had a diameter of approximately 1.6 m and was excavated from surface using electric 

hammers, shovels and an electric hoisting system.  Depths ranged from 7 to 17 m, however, shaft wall 

collapse, shallow water table, or the presence of excessive granodiorite limited sample size and depth at 

most locations.  Where necessary to support surficial soils and the upper few metres of the shaft collar, 

the walls were supported by box-work wooden frames.  

 

9.12.1 Shaft Excavation and Sample Collection 

 

The excavation of the shafts was initially completed by a contracting firm, using a pneumatic hammer. 

Midway through the program, Vaaldiam took over the shaft excavation program to reduce costs and to 

provide better control over sampling.  Vaaldiam used an electric breaker hammer as oppose to a 

pneumatic hammer to complete the shaft excavations.  The shafts were accessible to workers by an 



 

64 

 

electric winch (500 kg capacity), which also was used for hoisting the sample material from the shaft.  All 

sampling operations were overseen by Vaaldiam's Project Geologist/Manager.   

 

Shaft excavation and sample collection is summarized as follows: 

 

 Ground cover of variably thick soil, calcrete, and granodiorite detritus was broken, 

collected, and discarded (Figure 9.10Figure 9.10).  Sample collection started from the top 

of the recognizable saprolitic kimberlite. 

 Material was broken into large pieces by jack hammer and then loaded into a steel bucket 

for transport to surface (Figure 9.10). 

 On surface, the kimberlite sample was transferred to woven double-stitched polyethylene 

mini bulk bags with a weight capacity of 800 kg (Figure 9.11). 

 Each filled bag was tied off, zip-tied, and then sealed with a numbered seal and then 

recorded on a chain of custody form noting the depth range/interval of the sample and brief 

description of the material. 

 At the end of each day, all filled mini bulk bags were transported by truck, accompanied by 

the Project Manager, to a secure storage facility with 24 hour video surveillance at the 

Vaaldiam diamond recovery plant located in Nordestina (Figure 9.11).  Samples were 

accompanied and escorted by Vaaldiam staff at all times during transportation.

When the sampling was completed, the surface of the shaft and surrounding area was stabilized with a 

cover of thick concrete leaving an access hole covered by a padlocked steel lid.  All of the shafts were 

sealed.  However the shafts remain accessible for future access if required (Figure 9.12Figure 9.12) with 

the exception of shafts within the bulk sample trenches excavated during the 2010 sampling program 

which have been destroyed during the excavation process.

9.12.2 Mini Bulk Sampling Results 
 

The mini-bulk sampling program resulted in the collection of 409.859 dry tonnes of kimberlite (Table 

9.7) of which 111.938 dry tonnes was processed from 7 shafts at B3 (Figure 9.14). All overburden 

material overlying the upper contact of the saprolitic kimberlite was discarded.

9.12.3 Sample Processing and Diamond Recovery  
 

In order to process the mini-bulk samples, Vaaldiam assembled a secure diamond recovery facility in the 

town of Nordestina.  A one tonne per hour (tph) DMS plant was coupled with a trommel washer/sizer and 

a jaw crusher for material preparation at the front end.  The DMS concentrate was run through a jig and/or 

grease table for final diamond recovery.  A schematic flow sheet of the process plant is shown in Figure 

9.14. 

 

The mini bulk sampling program consisted of 233 plant runs (i.e. individual samples).  Tracers were 

added to each run to maintain DMS plant consistency and monitor diamond recovery efficiency.  If tracer 

recoveries fell below an acceptable threshold, the plant operator would take immediate steps to rectify any 

problems.  Typically, if the tracer recovery percentage falls below a minimum threshold, the entire sample 

was re-run QA/QC purposes. 

 

Sample tailings composed of rejects from the DMS unit, jigs, and grease table were collected and stored.  

The tailings were reprocessed to assess diamond recovery efficiencies and plant operation. 

 

9.12.3.1 Sample Processing and Treatment 

 

Just prior to processing, each mini bulk sample was weighed and a 1 litre aliquot of material taken for 

measurement of moisture content.  The sample processing included a primary trommel/scrubber used to 

clean and initially size the sample particles (see Figure (9.14).  Sieve openings on the trommel screen 



 

68 

 

separated the over-size material (+15 mm) and diverted it to a crushing circuit for right-sizing and re-

introduction to the trommel.   

 

 

Figure 9.14. Processing plant flow sheet for the Braúna mini bulk program. 

 

All material less than -15 mm in size was pumped to a shaker table (vibrating screen) to further classify 

the two fractions and to discard -0.85 mm fines.  The -15/+6 mm fraction was directed to a set of Pleitz 

jigs to produce a jig concentrate that was then hand picked for diamonds.  Once the diamond picking was 

completed, the jig concentrate tailings was then introduced to a roller mill to crush to the material to less 

than 6 mm, were then re-run through the scrubber and DMS plant in order to recover any locked 

diamonds.   

 

In parallel, the -6 mm/+0.85 mm fraction was mixed with a density regulated suspension of water and 

FeSi prior to DMS separation.  This rock/media mixture was passed through a cyclone separating heavy 

(concentrate) and light fractions (tailings).  Tailings were washed to recover the FeSi, bagged and stored.  

The DMS concentrate was cleaned on a vibrating screen and passed over a grease table.  The grease was 

melted, sieved and the material recovered picked for diamonds.  The grease table tailings were then 

processed through the Pleitz jigs and repicked as a final check for diamonds. 

 

9.12.3.2 Sample and Plant Security 

 

Outdoor sample storage was in a fenced compound protected by locking gate, barbed wire, and video 

surveillance (Figure 9.15).  Twenty-four hour video surveillance was also maintained in key areas of the 



 

69 

 

processing plant and final diamond recovery area.  Diamond handling operations were not hands-free.  

Therefore, security measures were established that included: 

 

 Diamond recovery room controlled by key card access that recorded entry and exit 

 Two people had to be present during final diamond recovery; 

 Diamonds were individually weighed, described, and packaged in a lock box;   

 The lock box was kept was kept in a 2 tonne safe with limited access; 

 Diamond parcels were periodically moved to secure storage in Salvador by an armored 

carrier; 

 Access to both the plant and the storage compound was limited to plant staff, although 

visitor tours were permitted upon arrangement; and,  

 Access to the high-security final diamond recovery area was off limits to non-Vaaldiam 

visitors and unauthorized plant personnel during active operations.

9.12.4 QA/QC Protocols 

 

9.12.4.1 Documentation 

 

Chain of custody from the storage area to the tailings storage facility, plant operations parameters, and 

sample processing and diamond recovery was documented on specific forms for each sample.  This 

information was transferred to digital forms and spreadsheets.  Although data entry verification was not 

strictly enforced, diamond recovery data (weights and descriptions) was always reviewed by a second 

person. 



 

70 

 

 

9.12.4.2 Diamond Recovery Efficiency Using DMS Tracers 

 

Epoxy cubes (tracers) of different densities were used to monitor the DMS process.  Monitoring tracer 

recoveries allows the potential diamond loss to be assessed and the "cut-point" that separates heavies 

from lights (tailings) during the DMS process. The balance and sharpness of the cut-point is a function of 

the density of the FeSi slurry and the flow rate of material through the cyclone.  The cut-point utilized for 

this DMS plant was 2.8 g/cm
3
and the efficiency was monitor with daily tracer testing.  Daily testing 

consisted of adding four sizes of density tracers (2, 4, 6 and 8 mm cubes) at two densities: 3.2 and 3.53 

g/cm
3
.  Tracers were counted at the end of the cycle and their recovery calculated.  The target recovery 

for 3.53 g/cm
3
 tracers was 95%; all sample recoveries exceeded this standard.   

 

9.12.4.3 Reprocessing of DMS Tailings 

 

DMS tailings were reprocessed routinely so that diamond recovery and plant efficiency could be 

monitored per sample. Prior to reprocessing, tailings were milled in a rotating cement mixer (to reduce 

particle size to ≈3 mm) to which water and ceramic balls where added.  Howe has been unable to confirm 

whether all of the tailings samples where milled prior to reprocessing.  As a result, larger diamonds may 

not have been liberated during this procedure.  

 

Nineteen stones weighing 1.19 carats and an average stone size of 0.06 carats were recovered from the 

reprocessed DMS tailings.  The diamond weights were then added to the appropriate sample number that 

they were recovered from (see Section 9.12.6, Table 9.8).  A final audit of tailings from a mixture of 

material from B3 and B7 produced 0.24 carats.  These diamonds were not allocated back to a sample and 

were not included in the results.   

 

Given the size and objectives of the mini bulk program, Howe considers Vaaldiam's QA/QC protocols 

and results thereof acceptable and within industry standards.    

 

9.12.5 Determining Moisture Content 
 

To calculate the dry weight of kimberlite processed, the moisture content was estimated by following 

these steps: 

 

 Each mini bulk bag was weighed before starting the treatment process;   

 One litre aliquots were weighed, then dried and weighed again;   

 The difference between wet and dry weights was then multiplied by 100 and the result 

divided by the starting wet weight, to give a percentage of moisture, or moisture factor for 

each sample bag; and,   

 The wet weight of the mini bulk bags were then adjusted using the percent moisture 

content to give a dry sample weight. 

 

 

9.12.6 Results of the Mini Bulk Sampling Program 
 

A total of 435 diamonds were recovered down to a size of 0.85 mm (cut off screen was 0.85 mm) from 

409.859 dry tonnes of kimberlite.  The combined weight of the stones was 47.39 carats.  Results are 



 

71 

 

shown in Table 9.8.  Grade and average stone size results shown in the table are averages weighted by dry 

weight tonnages. Weighted average grades ranged from 0.8 cpht for B4 to 42.4 cpht for B8, which 

included a large stone weighing 7.96 carats in sample BR08-B.

10.0 10.0 Sampling Method and Approach 

10.1 Heavy Mineral Sampling 

 

Heavy mineral sampling of surface and stream sediments was undertaken as part of the initial exploration 

programs.  Sampling is discussed in an earlier technical report (Maunula, 2006) and as such, is not 

included in this report. 

 

10.2 Caustic Fusion Sampling 
 

Caustic fusion is used to evaluate, characterize and correlate the diamond potential of individual 

kimberlite lithologies and provide data to facilitate the grade estimation.  Kimberlite from B3 and B7 was 

collected from 10 individual drill holes.  Sawn half core material from each drill hole was composited into 

a single sample with no depth or lithological correlation.  In Howe's opinion, the composited caustic 

fusion results cannot be used as sample grade data collected at depth for resource estimation purposes and 

therefore, are not used for the mineral resource estimation of the B3 kimberlite.   

 

10.3 Mini Bulk Sampling 
 

Although there is no formal industry accepted definition of a mini bulk sample, most would agree that the 

term is generally used to refer to the processing of kimberlite material up to several 10s of tonnes.  This 

material may be derived from drill core, RC chips, outcrop, subcrop, boulders, trenches or underground 

workings.  Mini bulk samples are usually processed from DMS equipment that depend on the diamond 

recovery objectives of a particular program, and in the Braúna mini bulk sampling program, was 

configured to recover diamonds greater than 0.85 mm on a square aperture mesh screen.   

 

Vaaldiam's mini bulk sampling program sampled saprolitic kimberlite that was excavated from shallow 

shafts measuring 1.6 m in diametre and treated at Vaaldiam's DMS plant facility located in Nordestina.  

At each sample (shaft) location, kimberlite material was broken into large pieces by jack hammer and 

then loaded into a steel bucket for transport to surface and transferred to woven double-stitched 

polyethylene mini bulk bags.  Each filled bag was tied off, zip-tied and sealed with a numbered seal.  A 

chain of custody form was completed with a brief description of the material and depth range. At the end 

of each day each filled mini bulk bag was transported by truck to the DMS facility to a secure storage 

with 24 hour video surveillance and entered into the processing stream.  The sample was always 

accompanied by a Vaaldiam representative.   

 

 

10.4 Large-Scale Bulk Sampling Program 
 

Although there is no formal industry accepted definition of a bulk sample, most would agree that the term 

is generally used to refer to the processing of kimberlite material that is several 100s of tonnes and can be 

derived from drillcore, RC chips, boulders, subcrop, outcrop, trenches or underground workings.  Bulk 

samples are usually processed through DMS equipment configured to recover commercial sized 

diamonds.    

 

The bulk sample should be large enough to obtain a diamond parcel that has economic meaning, i.e., 

allows a reasonably accurate estimate of the average commercial value.  As such, Vaaldiam aimed to 

collect 1,000 carats from the B3 bulk sample, with a target size of 5,000 tonnes.  The material was 

collected from two surface trenches into saprolitic kimberlite, mined by an excavator, trucked to a secure 



 

73 

 

storage site and subsequently processed through on site DMS plant configured to recover diamonds > 1 

mm (on a square mesh screen).   

 

To maintain the integrity of the bulk samples, a sampling protocol was established before excavation 

began to ensure a chain of custody is established and final diamond recovery data can be linked to the 

correct kimberlite sample and trench.   

 

A total of two individual surface bulk sample pit/trench areas were collected from the South lobe 

(Samples 1 and 2) and North lobe (Sample #3) at B3 respectively in order to obtain a macrodiamond 

parcel for diamond grade and valuation purposes.  Upon the completion of Sample 1, Sample 2 was taken 

below Sample within the same bulk sample pit perimeter.   

 

Each surveyed sample pit perimeter measured a nominal 30 m by 40 m with variable depths (from 3m to 

5m per bulk sample).  Upon completion, each sample pit was surveyed in order to obtain volumes 

excavated (with bulk density samples collected for dry tonnage estimates).  All kimberlite material from 

each sample trench was stockpiled separately prior to processing. 

 

The following summarizes the procedure followed for bulk sample transport, stockpiling and processing 

plant feeding: 

 

 

1. All bulk sample material for a particular sample site were loaded and transported to the secure 
stockpiling area via dump truck for processing.  Vaaldiam personnel supervised the removal and 

transport of the bulk sample material so that it was stockpiled according to sample number. 

 

2. Each bulk sample was identified with a sign denoting what bulk sample (number and trench) it 
was derived from.  The kimberlite muck for each bulk sample was piled on top of a sand/clay rich 

base. 

 

3. Wet tonnages were determined by a load cell fitted onto the front-end loader.  All weights were 
recorded by the front-end loader operator.  Moisture content samples were collected off of the 

primary feed bin every 2 hours during steady state operation for overall bulk sample batch dry 

tonnage determinations. 

 

4. All kimberlite material was fed into the primary static screen feed bin where the oversize reported 
to the side and the undersized material reported to a vibrating grizzly feeder for additional sizing 

before it entered the scrubber-trommel unit.  Collection and retreatment of +400mm grizzly 

oversize and spillage was carried out periodically during processing and during the final clean-up 

for the bulk sample.

Figure 10.1. B3 South Lobe Sample 1 bulk sample. 

 

A 24 hour per day independent security force was on site, the area was fenced, gated and locked and 

CCTV surveillance was implemented in several strategic locations. 

 

10.5 Bulk Density Determinations 
 

The dry bulk density database for B3 comprises 737 discrete measurements obtained for unweathered 

kimberlite drillcore.  Measurements were taken in the field using the procedure outlined in Section 9.9.  

During the bulk sampling program, seven grab samples of saprolitic kimberlite were taken from the south 

trench (Samples 1 and 2) and an additional four from the north trench (Sample 3).  These samples were 

submitted to SGS Geosol Laboratórios Ltda. ("SGS Geosol") in Minas Gerais for bulk density 

determination.  As well, Vaaldiam and previous operators collected 526 bulk density measurements of 

drill core within the country rock (granite).  No country rock bulk density measurements were carried out 

during the bulk sampling program.   

 

Bulk density measurements for unweathered kimberlite from drillcore ranged from 2.4 to 3.15 g/cm
3
, 

with an average bulk density of 2.7 g/cm
3
.  Values for country ranged from 2.16 to 2.89 g/cm

3
, with an 

average bulk density of 2.6 g/cm
3
.  Saprolitic grab samples bulk density results from SGS Geosol for the 

South trench returned values ranging from 1.45 to 1.89 g/cm
3 
(averaging 1.65 g/cm

3
) and the North trench 

ranging from 1.10 to 1.44 g/cm
3 
(averaging 1.24 g/cm

3
). 

 

 

 

 

 



 

75 

 

10.6 Moisture Content 
 

For the bulk samples, the moisture samples were taken from the feed bin at the start of the processing 

circuit at least once every 2 hours during normal production (i.e., if the plant was not running, no samples 

were taken).  Once a sample was collected, the wet weight was recorded.  The sample was then dried in 

an oven overnight (12 hours) at approximately 110° and reweighed.  Thes dry weight was recorded and 

then used to calculate the % moisture of that particular sample.  The results were recorded and the 

average moisture values were obtained per day and applied to each sample.  The average moisture content 

for Sample 1 and 2 (South trench) was 11.2 % and 8.5% respectively and Sample 3 (North trench) was 

8.2%.  The difference in the average moisture content sample values between Sample 1 and 2 was largely 

due as a result of the high amount of rain at the project site during the excavation and processing of 

Sample 1.   

 

10.7  Internal Dilution Estimates 

 

During the excavation of the bulk sample trenches, Vaaldiam's geological staff was required to 

empirically determine the percentage of granodiorite / crustal xenoliths > 10cm that occur within each 

sample trench.  This was carried out on a daily basis or as per the advancement of the trench excavation 

and was a part of the geological data being collected during the mapping of the trench.  The dilution data 

collection procedure is as follows: 

 

Internal dilution per sample trench were calculated as follows: 

 

1. Geological mapping of a pit wall was carried out whereby a level line was established at the 

mid-point height of the trench wall; 

2. The length of the level line was recorded onto the data sheet; 

3. All crustal xenoliths > 10cm that occur along the level line were then measured individually 

and recorded onto the data sheet; 

4. The following equation was then used to determine the dilution estimate: 

 

Internal Dilution = 
  

                                                      

                                                                     
        

 

The internal dilution results obtained by Vaaldiam for each of the bulk sample trenches are listed in Table 

10.1 below:

11.0 11.0 Sampling Preparation, Mineral Processing, Analyses and Security 

11.1 Laboratories 
 

During the B3 mini-bulk sampling program, a 1 tph DMS process facility was used as the primary 

macrodiamond extraction laboratory.  In 2010, Vaaldiam purchased a 10 tph facility located on site 

(owned and operated by the JV).  Both facilities are not accredited to ISO/IEC 17025 as a testing 

laboratory, but were subjected to ongoing internal QA/QC testing (see Section 12.2.1).  

 

During the Braúna exploration programs, macrodiamonds were extracted during the mini bulk sampling 

program using a 1 tph DMS plant that was located in the town of Nordestina, approximately 7 km from 

the Property.  Microdiamonds were extracted by two external facilities: RTDM in Brasilia (a non-

accredited laboratory run by Rio Tinto) and SGS Lakefield Research Ltd. in Lakefield, ON.  Lakefield is 

accredited by the Standards Council of Canada to ISO/IEC 17025 for the specific test.  However, neither 

the mini bulk nor the caustic fusion results on the drillcore was used for the mineral resource estimate.   

 

11.1.1 Drill Core 
 

The following is a list of procedures used during drill core logging to ensure consistency and integrity: 

 

 Use of defined and documented geological and geotechnical core logging procedures; 

 Use of standardized forms for recording data and information; 

 Overlap of personnel engaged in the core logging to maintain an adequate level of 

consistency in the use of technical terms and observations; and, 

 Second person review of core log identifier information, core descriptions, lithological 

contacts, and geotechnical data. 

 

11.1.2 Caustic Fusion Sampling 
 

The following is a list of procedures used during the drill core logging program to ensure integrity and 

security: 

 

 Use of a sampling approach that minimizes bias in sample selection; 

 

 Restricted access to core logging area and open core; 

 

 Use of DNPM procedures and inspectors to prepare samples for shipment; use of tamper-

proof drums and third party seals; 

 

 Use of well-known and reputable laboratories for analyses; 

 

 Use of duplicate, or near-duplicate, samples to assess recovery efficiency in different 

laboratories; blank samples are rarely used unless assuredly barren material is available, 

and standards are not utilized in analytical diamond recovery due to extreme nugget-effect; 

concentrates or residuals may be submitted to other labs to ensure quality of hand-picking, 

but this was not utilized by Vaaldiam (notably, tailings and concentrates were to be shipped 



 

77 

 

to Vaaldiam's Chapada Diamond Mine for a recovery audit utilizing the production plant, 

but this was not completed because the mine was placed under care and maintenance status 

due to limited company finances during the global financial crisis in the second half of 

2008); 

 

 Use of synthetic diamonds to monitor diamond recovery efficiency; 

 

 Routine checking of magnetic concentrates; and, 

 

 Routine re-picking of residual concentrates by the primary picker and by additional 

technicians 

 

 

11.1.3 DMS Separation: Mini bulk sampling 
 

During the mini bulk sampling program, the following summarizes the procedures used to ensure sample 

integrity and security of the samples:  

 

 Supervision of mini bulk sample collection from excavated shafts and transportation to the 

plant was supervised by the Project Geologist or Manager; 

 Use of standardized forms and log books for recording data and information for plant 

operations, material flow, and diamond recovery; 

 Routine purging and thorough clean-up of material preparation modules, the DMS plant, 

and the final recovery area between batches to minimize potential contamination of results 

due to grain "memory" in the system; 

 Routine measuring of FeSi (dense media) density to maintain an optimal cut-point during 

operations; 

 Use of density tracers to assess operation of the DMS plant and to monitor diamond 

recovery efficiency during final diamond recovery operations (jigs and grease table); 

 Re-process grease table rejects through the Pleitz jig to assess grease table operation and 

efficiency; 

 Routine re-processing of tailings on a per batch basis to assess plant operations and 

diamond recovery efficiency; 

 Secure sample storage onsite with 24 hour video surveillance; 

 Video surveillance of plant operations and final diamond recovery area; 

 Access to final diamond recovery area restricted to authorized personnel, except for pre-

approved visitors under close supervision; 

 Key card access and entry recording to the final diamond recovery area; 

 Two key lock system for diamond storage in lock box and in 2 tonne safe; 

 Two person rule for handling diamonds during weighing, characterization, and 

photography 

 Fully documented diamond recoveries; and, 



 

78 

 

 Periodic armed/armored transport of diamond inventory to secure off-site storage by 

bonded and reputable security service. 

 

 

11.1.4 Large Scale Bulk Sampling Program 

 

11.1.4.1 Mineral Processing and Recovery of Diamonds from the Process Plant 

 

In order to process a significant amount of kimberlite, Vaaldiam purchased and commissioned a 10tph 

DMS bulk sampling plant (Figure 11.1Figure 11.1) to process and recover diamonds from large-scale 

surface bulk samples.  The process plant (and subsequent results) is designed to simulate a commercial 

kimberlite ore treatment plant.   

 

 

Figure 11.1. Vaaldiam bulk sampling plant 

 

Vaaldiam's DMS and Recovery circuits were designed and constructed by ADP Projects Limited (ADP) 

of South Africa.  ADP is one of many engineering companies involved in the design, construction and 

commissioning of modular diamond process plants around the world.  The front-end portion of the 

process plant (feed bin, vibrating grizzly, scrubber, crushing and screening circuit) was sourced and 

fabricated in Brazil by Simplex Equipementos Ltda of Belo Horizonte Brazil.   

 

Vaaldiam's process plant consists of the following circuits: 

 

4. A 20 tph capacity feed bin - scrubber - crushing circuit; 



 

79 

 

5. A 10 tph DMS circuit which consists of a 250mm separating cyclone; and, 

6. A recovery circuit consisting of a vibrating screen, one Flowsort® XR2/19DW X-Ray diamond 

sorting machine ("Sortex"), a grease table and a diamond sorting house equipped with a glove 

box and safe facility. 

 

11.1.4.2 Vaaldiam's Sample Processing Plant 

 

The following section is a detailed description of Vaaldiam's Processing and Diamond Recovery Circuits.   

Figure 11.2 

Figure 11.2 shows a schematic flowsheet.for the processing of kimberlite samples for the large-scale 

surface bulk samples carried out at the Braúna Project. 

 

Process Plant – Front-End Crushing, Scrubbing and Screening Circuit 

 

Kimberlitic material (stored as individual batches or piles) to be processed were hauled by a large 

capacity (2 m
3
) front-end loader fitted with a load cell from the storage facility area to the primary feed 

bin.  The wet weight of the kimberlite material being fed to the process plant was recorded by the 

operator.  Thekimberlitic material was then dumped into a primary feed bin fitted with a 400 mm square 

aperture static screen located at the top of the bin.  All -400 mm sized kimberlite material reported 

directly below to a vibrating grizzly fitted with 120 mm spaced bars whereas the +400 mm sized material 

was removed from the top screen and broken up mechanically.  All of the -120 mm sized material 

reported directly to a scrubber-trommel unit whereas all of the +120 mm kimberlite material reported 

directly to the side of the plant.  The +120 mm oversize material was collected periodically by Vaaldiam 

personnel to be re-inserted back into the plant via the primary feed bin. 

 

All material (-120 mm) reporting to the scrubber - trommel screen unit was subject to attrition and 

washing.  The -120mm material from the scrubber then discharged onto the trommel screen which was 

fitted with a 30mm square aperture screen.  All of the +30 mm material reported to the jaw crusher 

whereby it was crushed to -20 mm.  The -30 mm material reports directly to the plant's primary screening 

circuit for de-watering, de-sliming and sizing via jet pump. 

 

At the primary screening circuit, the following is sized sorted: 

 

 Primary feed material (+1 mm to -16 mm).   

o The +1mm to -16 mm sized fractions was washed and then pumped to the DMS 

circuit's feed preparation screen via jet pump. All the primary feed +16 mm 

material reported to a secondary cone crusher for size reduction to -13 mm). 

 Oversize float tailings for re-crushing (+6 mm to -16 mm).   

o This material was re-inserted back through the plant for tertiary crushing through 

the secondary cone crusher at a closed set spacing of 6 mm. 

 Slimes from the scrubber-trommel unit (-1 mm) 

o The slimes material passed through the 1mm bottom screen underpan and was then 

pumped directly to the settling pond for disposal. 

 

 



 

80 

 

 

DMS Circuit  

 

All of the -16 mm to +1 mm product reporting from the primary screening unit was thenpumped from the 

DMS feed pump to the Feed Prep screen where it was dewatered prior to reporting to a mixing box.  At 

the mixing box, the kimberlite material was mixed with a dense circulating medium (CM) consisting of 

FeSi and water. Both the kimberlitic material and CM was then pumped at a constant cyclone inlet 

velocity pressure to the 250 mm diameter cyclone mounted atop the DMS circuit.  Separation of the 

heavy and light particles (i.e. product) was achieved on the basis of the specific gravity of the minerals. 

 

Both the heavy and light products exiting the DMS cyclone are screened and then washed to recover the 

FeSi.  The diluted CM recovered from the floats screen reported to the magnetic separator for FeSi 

removal and densification prior to being re-inserted into the CM tank.  The diluted CM from the sinks 

screen reported directly into the CM tank.  The densifier was used to remove excess water from the CM 

so that an operating CM density can be achieved and maintained when the DMS circuit was in operation. 

 

The heavy mineral underflow product (i.e. DMS concentrate) reported to the sinks screen for FeSi 

removal and dewatering and then reported to a dedicated and secure DMS concentrate underpan for 

storage prior to being jet pumped to the Recovery Plant circuit. 

 

The light mineral fraction i.e. DMS float tailings reported to a 1.0 mm slotted screen for FeSi removal and 

washing.  The product was then discharged to a conveyor belt where the material was then piled up for 

removal by the front-end loader. 

 

The specific gravity (SG) of the CM was monitored electronically and in real time with a DebTech® 

dense medium controller system and manually checked periodically with a densitometer scale.  DMS 

QA/QC tests such as density tracer tests were carried out daily prior to the processing of the bulk sample 

material and at bulk sample changes.  The density tracer tests are carried out with the use of cube shaped 

epoxy tracers with specific gravities ranging from 2.70 to 3.53 and sizes from 4 mm and 6 mm 

respectively.  Density tracer tests were carried out prior to processing in order to monitor the separating 

effectiveness of the DMS cyclone.  The density tracers that report to the floats or sinks screen are counted 

separately and a Tromp curve was plotted in order to obtain the percentage of density tracers versus 

particle specific gravity.  An estimate of the effective separation of light and heavy fractions, including 

diamond, can be determined from the shape and slope of the Tromp (or partition) curve.  The separating 

specific gravity (or cut point) was determined as the point where the curve has a value of 50%. 

 

The DMS flowsheet is illustrated below in Figure 11.2.

Figure 11.2. Bulk sample process plant schematic flowsheet. 

 

 

Secondary (Recrush) Processing 

 

As indicated above, the DMS's +6 mm oversize light fraction product from the floats screen then reported 

by conveyor to a dedicated pile for re-crush processing.  Once the primary material for the bulk sample 

has been fed into the process plant, this re-crush material was then re-inserted into the process plant via 

the primary static feed bin.  The weight of the re-crush material was then measured by the same load cell 

fitted onto the front-end loader and was recorded by the operator.  From the primary feed bin, the re-crush 

material reported directly to the scrubber/trommel unit for attrition.  From the scrubber-trommel unit, the 

re-crush material passes through the trommel screen and reported to the primary screening unit fitted with 

a 6 mm square aperture top screen.  Since all of the re-crush material was +6 mm to -16 mm in size, the 

material reported directly to the secondary cone crusher where it was wet crushed to -6 mm.  The wet 

crushed product reported back to the primary screening circuit via jet pump where it was then re-sized 

and jet pumped directly to the DMS circuit for reprocessing to recover possible locked diamonds.  All of 

the -1 mm sized slimes generated by the recrush material reported directly to the settling pond.  Any 

remaining +6 mm recrush material was returned to the secondary cone crusher until all material passes 

through the primary screening circuit's +6 mm square mesh top screen. 

 

 

DMS Concentrate Handling Procedures 

 

All DMS concentrate obtained from the sinks screen reported directly to the recovery plant's dewatering 

and sizing screen/trommel unit where it was sized and stored into separate underpan storage bins 

according to the following size fractions: 



 

82 

 

 

 +1 to -2.4 mm 

 +2.4 to -6 mm 

 +6 to -16 mm 

 

The wet weight for each size fraction was collected by Vaaldiam's recovery plant manager.  Each of the 

size fractions was then individually processed through the Recovery circuit's Flowsort® diamond sorting 

machine for diamond recovery.   

 

Slimes Tailings and Settling Pond 

 

The -1.0 mm slimes material from the primary screening unit was then pumped out directly to the 

dedicated slimes disposal area located behind the plant facility.   

 

Diamond Recovery Plant Sample Handling and Processing Procedures 

 

Each DMS concentrate size fraction was collected in its own screen underpan, from where it was then fed 

to the Flowsort® model XR2/19DW X-ray diamond machine.  The x-ray tailings from the Flowsort® 

reported to a grease table for recovery of possible low luminescent diamonds.   

 

All of the wet diamond-bearing X-ray concentrates reported directly to a concentrate drying pan feeder 

for drying and then reporting to a secure glove box.  Within the glove box, Vaaldiam personnel then hand 

sort the diamond concentrate to remove all diamonds present.   

 

The final recovery plant grease table tailings were bagged, weighed, labelled and securely stored plastic 

canisters/drums with security cinch strap.  Each canister/drum was the weighed, transported and stored in 

a secure dedicated facility for future plant audit purposes.   

 

11.1.4.3 Chain of Custody and Security Protocols 

 

During the processing plant commissioning period of the bulk sample processing program, Vaaldiam and 

Howe developed security protocols that were designed to enhance the chain of custody and ultimately, the 

sample integrity of the bulk sample program as a whole from the extraction of kimberlite from the 

individual bulk sample trenches to the storage and shipment of diamonds from the project site.  

Vaaldiam's chain of custody and security protocols were designed around a two-lock system such that 

two individuals must simultaneously carry out the removal, transport and escort of all concentrate (DMS, 

x-ray diamond concentrate) at all times under the surveillance of Vaaldiam's security personnel.  A 

CCTV video surveillance camera system was installed at the process plant whereby the video cameras 

were set up in a manner to follow the movement, storage and processing of DMS concentrate from the 

DMS circuit to the Recovery Plant area.  As well, the CCTV video surveillance system alse served to 

monitor the processing of concentrate through both the DMS and the recovery plants.  The CCTV video 

surveillance system was monitored 24/7 by Vaaldiam's plant security officers.  All security images were 

backed up for potential security reviews by a third party security auditor.  Access to the recovery plant 

area was restricted to Vaaldiam recovery operators, recovery technicians, security officers and 

Vaaldiam's on-site project management.  Access to the process plant was managed with an access card 

security system. 

 



 

83 

 

A number of Security System enhancements were implemented prior to the commencement of sample 

processing in order to heighten the overall site and Process/Recovery Plant security measures.  The 

enhancements to the Security Systems included the building of a security entrance building on the east 

side of the Process/Recovery Plant.  The attached Plant Security Entrance building allowed for the 

monitoring of persons entering the Process/Recovery Plant and a more effective search out capability of 

those persons leaving the plant.  All plant employees and authorized visitors were required to sign in and 

be searched before entering the Process/Recovery facilities.  The Plant Security entrance also housed the 

security control area which allows for a secure environment for the security officers, to monitor all high 

risk areas, utilizing the CCTV and door accesses recorded on the Security Management System.   

 

Enhanced security protocols have also been implemented within the Process/Recovery Plant operations 

area.  These protocols define the role of security officers working within the plant areas and ensured that 

Security maintains the integrity of all personnel and protects Vaaldiam's company assets by monitoring 

and recording the work being performed.  Dual accountability, which must include a Vaaldiam Security 

Officer, was maintained at all times when employees may come in contact with any material in the 

processing stream.  

 

With the advent of Security Cameras in the Recovery Plant glove box area, proper three person 

accountability was maintained with the presence of the Recovery Plant manager or technicians, 

Vaaldiam's Project Manager and one Vaaldiam security officer on entrance to the Recovery glove box 

area and continual focused video monitoring by a second security officer from the Security Control room.  

All persons, including dates and times, entering the Recovery Plant Area and/or the Recovery glove box 

area were recorded on the Security Management System via the access card readers.  All recorded 

security video from the Process/Recovery Plant were backed up and secured for reviews by a third party 

security auditor.

12.0 12.0 Data Verification 

12.1 Introduction 
 

A quality assurance and quality control program (QA/QC) covering the database management of 

Vaaldiam's bulk sample processing program was administered and monitored on a number of levels 

throughout the program.  In Howe's opinion, the sample processing procedures and QA/QC program for 

the diamond processing program was well documented by Vaaldiam. 

 

A strict adherence to the data management procedures and geological administrative framework facilitates 

Vaaldiam's internal due diligence program.  The aims of the review procedures of data collection, input 

and ultimately data validation seek to illustrate the quality of data handling achieved on the Braúna 

Project.  Where errors were identified in the database, Vaaldiam's site staff would receive the erroneous 

information, verify the hardcopy records and digital data files and make the amendments if the data was 

incorrect. 

 

During the large-scale bulk sampling program, Howe provided third-party supervisory and monitoring 

technical services to Vaaldiam's on site staff in the sample processing, chain of custody and sample 

integrity of Vaaldiam's bulk sample and sample processing program.  Howe believes that the quality of 

the diamond processing data is reliable and that the sample preparation, analysis and security were carried 

out in accordance with exploration best practices and industry standards.  

 

Prior to the commencement of the large-scale bulk sampling program, Howe assisted Vaaldiam in 

developing and implementing operating process plant QA/QC protocols to monitor and quantify the 

efficiency and recovery of the process plant and these are discussed below: 

 

12.2 Process Plant 
 

The following QA/QC operating protocols were established by Howe for the efficient operation of the 

DMS and recovery circuits by Vaaldiam personnel. 

 

12.2.1 DMS QA/QC Operating Protocols 
 

During the operation of the DMS circuit, the following operating parameters are strictly monitored by 

Vaaldiam's personnel in order to achieve proper kimberlite material separation: 

 

 The specific gravity (SG) of the circulating medium (CM) is to be measured manually 

every 15 minutes with a densitometer and in real time with a DebTech® dense medium 

controller system.  Since the commissioning of the DMS circuit, the operating range, 

determined by numerous density tracer tests over several CM SG values is between SG 

2.60 and SG 2.70; 

 CM specific gravity readings of both the DMS cyclone overflow and underflow to be 

collected periodically; 

 The operating range of the cyclone inlet velocity pressure is to be maintained at a constant 

pressure and that the inlet velocity pressure remains constant (i.e. no surging); 



 

85 

 

 It is ensured that the volumetric ratio between kimberlite material feed and CM fed to the 

mixing box is such that the loss of diamonds to the floats screen (due to the overfeeding of 

material through the cyclone) is negligible; 

 Periodic wet screening checks of the CM for fines from the kimberlitic material are carried 

out in order to verify for the presence, quantity and size of non-magnetic contaminants that 

can increase the viscosity of the CM; 

 Periodic dry screening checks of the CM particle size analysis are carried out in order to 

determine the coarsening of the CM due to a reduction of fine ferrosilicon particles; 

 Periodic checks of the +1 to -6mm (2.5mm) float material exiting the process plant for any 

>1mm sized KIMs such as pyrope garnet (SG 3.50), eclogitic garnet (SG 3.50) and Cr-

diopside (SG 3.20); and, 

 Density tracer tests are carried out on a daily basis to monitor the separating effectiveness 

of the DMS cyclone. 

 

12.2.2 Flowsort X-Ray QA/QA Operating Protocols 
 

During the commissioning and operation of the Flowsort X-ray sorter, the following test work was carried 

out daily by Vaaldiam's recovery plant personnel: 

 

 Calibration tests: Before any DMS concentrate was processed, the X-ray sorter was 

calibrated as per manufacturer's specification.  This is usually carried out with the use of 

fluorescent tracers.  Depending on the tracer recovery rate, adjustments to the X-ray 

sorter's photo-multiplier tubes sensitivities can be carried out if required; 

 Daily tracer tests with Flowsort® fluorescent tracers:  These tests were carried out every 

morning before production commences.  They were inserted into the X-ray sorter for check 

purposes (i.e. recovery efficiency, check the operation of the x-ray sorter); 

 Inspection of the vibrating sizing screen, under pans, etc. to see if any areas may be prone 

to material hang-up; 

 If the tracer recoveries are not obtained, then adjustments to the photo-multiplier tube 

sensitivities (channels) must be carried out and the tracer test re-run prior to processing 

DMS concentrate; and, 

 A preventive maintenance schedule for the Flowsort® X-ray sorting units was strictly 

followed on a regular basis. 

 

 

12.2.3 Diamond Picking and Sorting Procedures  
 

12.2.3.1 DMS Concentrate Standard Operating Procedures – DMS Concentrate Processing and 
Diamond Sorting 

 

The following bulk sampling Standard Operating Procedures were implemented in the Vaaldiam glove 

box area for processing and sorting of diamond from each of the large-scale bulk samples DMS 



 

86 

 

concentrate.  During the sorting work, Vaaldiam's recovery plant manager and project manager were 

present at all times to monitor the procedures/process, documentation and ensure sample integrity.  The 

process consisted of the following steps: 

 

1. Weighing and description of +2 carat diamonds and documentation of all diamonds from initial 

cursory sort; 

2. Sieving of dried DMS concentrates with a 12 mm, 6mm, 3 mm square aperture screens (with 

catch pan) sieve nest and weighing of size fractions; 

3. Labelling of all fractions of the bulk sample DMS sample; 

4. Hand sorting of each sample fraction by Vaaldiam diamond pickers; 

5. Each fraction was sorted twice by two different sorters; 

6. Verification of all selected diamonds; 

7. DTC sieving of all diamonds in sample, and weighing of each sieve fraction; 

8. Weight and description of each diamond; 

9. Data recorded and entered into Vaaldiam's diamond report; and, 

10. Diamonds were packaged and labelled in heavy plastic ziplock bags, then heat sealed and stored 

in a dedicated diamond safe located within the sorting room.  A dual custody system of two 

security locks placed on the diamond safe whereby the locks can only be opened simultaneously 

by the Vaaldiam recovery plant manager and Vaaldiam's project manager. 

 

The diamond report completed by Vaaldiam's recovery plant manager conforms to the CIM guidelines 

for the reporting of diamond exploration results (CIM, 2003).  The diamond report contained the 

following sample result information: 
 

 Diamond count: Total number of diamonds recovered on a per sieve size (mm square mesh 

and/or DTC) (for diamonds over 0.66 carats in weight); and, 

 Diamond weight: Total weight of diamonds recovered on a per sieve size (mm square mesh 

and/or DTC) basis; and, 

 

All of the original sample information was collected by hand and were then electronically entered into a 

pre-designed spreadsheet.  The diamond report accompanies the bulk sample diamond parcels when 

expedited from the project site for valuation purposes. 

 

12.2.4 Process Plant - Prevention of Sample Contamination 
 

Contamination of samples by diamonds from previously run samples can adversely affect sample results 

and subsequent economic decisions.  Therefore, strict guidelines are followed by Vaaldiam to prevent 

batch sample cross-contamination.  Prior to processing a new sample batch, the plant equipment 

(conveyors, crushers, hoppers, chutes, scrubber, sumps and pump boxes) is thoroughly cleaned inside and 

out.  All screens are scrubbed and flushed.  The DMS circuit is run empty until all material trapped in the 

system was flushed out.  The plant floor, which consists of both a cement and sand base, was periodically 

raked and swept.  All sumps are cleaned and hosed off prior to processing the next bulk sample. 

 

 

 



 

87 

 

12.3 Independent Laboratory Audits 
 

No independent audits such as third party diamond picking of the diamond concentrate tailings or grease 

table tailings were carried out by Vaaldiam during the bulk sampling program.  All diamond concentrate 

tailings and grease table tailings audits were carried out by Vaaldiam and the results are discussed in the 

subsequent section.   

 

12.4 Comments on Process Plant and QA/QC 
 

Overall, Howe's review of Vaaldiam's technical data (production, diamond data, etc.) suggests a well 

operated and documented operation of the treatment of the individual bulk samples.  There were no issues 

of sample integrity.  The -6mm float tail audit results indicate a high efficiency of diamond recovery.  The 

bulk sampling plant facilities established and operated by Vaaldiam conform to industry standards.   

 

Approximately 600kg of Flowsort® and grease table tailings were recrushed and reprocessed for audit 

purposes.  There were no diamonds recovered from the 600 kg of material.  The glove box rejects were 

repicked by Vaaldiam staff for each bulk sample separately.  Forty-two stones weighing 2.34 carats, 76 

stones, weighing 4.55 carats and six (6) stones totalling 0.18 cts were recovered from Samples 1, 2 and 3 

respectively.  An audit of approximately 10% of the -6mm DMS float tails was completed at the end of 

the program by Vaaldiam.  A total of 103.8 tonnes of -6mm float tails were processed in two separate 

batches whereby a total of six stones were recovered with a total weight of 0.67 carats. 

 

Howe considers the Vaaldiam audit results on the grease table tailings and glove box rejects are 

satisfactory and the recovery plant data are accepted with no problems.  The audits on the float tailings 

and glove box rejects indicate that the recovery plant circuit operated normally.  This is also confirmed by 

the review of the daily density tracer tests of the DMS cyclone plus the review of additional operational 

QA/QC results collected during the sample processing program.  

 

Howe considers that the QA/QC program and results obtained from the Vaaldiam audits are adequate to 

ensure quality data to support mineral resource estimation work.

As well, the following process and recovery plant production statistics were recorded daily and 

summarized on a per bulk sample basis.  They are: 

 

1. Wet weight of kimberlite material processed bulk sample basis; 

2. DMS concentrate wet weight (in kg) for three size fractions; 

3. Diamond concentrate (Sortex) weight in grams (dry);  

4. Recovery plant tailings weight (in wet kg) in secured plastic drums; 

5. The -6 mm float tailings (in wet tonnes); 

6. +6 mm oversize re-crush material for re-processing; 

7. Coarse kimberlite reject material (i.e. float tailings in tonnes); and, 

8. Moisture content determinations of the kimberlitic material 

 

During the bulk sample processing program, Howe was involved in providing technical assistance (by 

electronic or telephone correspondence) to Vaaldiam's on-site staff regarding the review of process plant 

production data, operational QA/QC, process plant troubleshooting, chain of custody and sample integrity 

of the bulk sample processing program.  During this period Howe believes that the quality of the diamond 

processing data is reliable and that the sample preparation, analysis and security were carried out in 

accordance with exploration best practices and industry standards. 

 

 

13.2 Diamond Valuation 
 

At the completion of the bulk sampling program, Vaaldiam commissioned two independent groups of 

diamond valuators based in Antwerp, Belgium and in Canada to carry out a valuation on an initial 

1,048.49 carat diamond parcel recovered from the B3 bulk sampling program.  The 1,048.49 carat 

diamond parcel was examined by: 

 

1. Diamond Counsellor International (DCI); and, 

2. International Economic Strategy (IES) 

 



 

89 

 

The diamond valuation was completed on November 1, 2010 whereby an average value of US$338 per 

carat was obtained from independent valuation of this parcel.  Table 13.2 summarizes the diamond 

valuation statistics from each of the diamond valuators.

13.3  Discussion of the Bulk Sample Results 

13.3.1  Internal Dilution 

 

The low diamond grade result obtained for the North Lobe bulk sample is primarily attributed to the 

amount of granodiorite within the North Lobe (which is not diamondiferous) that was contained within 

the North Lobe bulk sample i.e. internal dilution.  Vaaldiam have estimated that 41% of the volume and 

tonnage of Sample 3 consisted of internal dilution. 

 

Although Sample 3 contains > 40% crustal xenoliths, it is Howe's opinion that the bulk sample result for 

Sample 3 is an underestimation of the diamond grade for the North lobe; however, it may be 

representative of the possible recovered diamond grade to be expected during a mining operation.  

However, it is strongly recommended that a future bulk sample be collected for both diamond grade and 

valuation purposes.

14.0 14.0 Adjacent Properties 

14.1 Diamond 
 

Two additional, noncontiguous licences are located 12 km WNW (Umbu) and 50 km WSW (Aroeira) of 

Nordestina (see Section 3.0  and Figure 3.3Figure 3.3).  Vaaldiam acquired the licences in 2006 and each 

licence hosts a known kimberlite occurrence discovered in the early 1990's by De Beers.  Vaaldiam 

obtained De Beer's exploration dataset for these areas (≈165,000 ha), which included results from 645 

soil and stream sediment samples and two small (≈1 m
3
) surface samples from each kimberlite.  The 

Aroeira sample returned nine diamonds with a total weight of 0.11 carats compared to five diamonds with 

a total weight of 0.08 carats from the Umbu sample.  

 

No exploration work has been initiated by Vaaldiam on either licence. 

 

These claims are part of the Braúna Property and are subject to the JV agreement outlined in Section 3.3.  

Title to the mineral licence is held by Lipari. 

 

14.2 Gold 
 

The RIGB (see Section 6.1) is an important gold producing region and Yamana Gold Inc. ("Yamana") 

have two projects, the Encantado and Sapateira, located immediately east and southeast of the Braúna 

Property and a third, Serra Branca which is located ≈25 km to the southeast (Figure 14.1).   

 

Yamana's C1 Santa Luz gold project is only 10 km to east-southeast and the Fazenda Brasileiro Gold 

Mine is located <75 km southeast of the Property (Figure 14.1).  According to Yamana, the C1 has 

received the preliminary environmental permit and construction is on track to begin in 2010 with 

production startup expected in 2012 (Yamana website). 

 

In 2009, visible gold in a quartz vein was identified by Vaaldiam during prospecting near the Braúna 17 

(B17) kimberlite occurrence.  Two grab samples were collected from the vein that returned values of 5.91 

and 21.15 grams per tonne.  Gold also occurs associated with the same structure which is interpreted to be 

on strike to Yamana's Encantado project. The quartz vein varies in width from 1-5m in thickness with 

various artisanal shafts located in the main gold-quartz zone to depths of 20 to 30 m.  The strike length of 

the quartz vein has not been defined as yet by Vaaldiam as very limited exploration work has been carried 

out on the occurrence such as geological mapping of the quartz veins (completed in 2009) along with a 

limited soil sampling program (66 samples collected) and minor surface trenching.

15.0 15.0 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 

15.1 Introduction 
 

The mineral resource estimate presented herein for the B3 kimberlite is reported in accordance with the 

Canadian Securities Administrator's National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) and has been estimated in 

conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best 

Practices" guidelines including the "Guidelines for Reporting of Diamond Exploration Results".  Mineral 

Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  There is no 

guarantee that all or any part of the Mineral Resource will be converted into a Mineral Reserve.  The 

quantity and grade of the reported Inferred Resources in this resource statement are conceptual in nature. 

 

All Mineral Resource estimation work reported in this technical report (volumetric modelling, etc.) was 

done by Doug Roy, M.A.Sc, Associate Mining Engineer with Howe.  All of the Mineral Resource 

estimation work was supervised and reviewed by Daniel C. Leroux, B.Sc., P.Geo. of Howe.  All data was 

supplied by Vaaldiam and reviewed by Howe.   

 

Mineral Resource modeling and estimation were carried out using the commercially available Micromine 

(v.12.0.1) mining software program.  In this report, all units are expressed in the metric system, and 

diamond grades are given as either cpt or cpht values.   

 

15.2 Previous Estimates 
 

There are no previous mineral resource estimates completed neither for B3 nor for any other kimberlites 

that are known to exist on the project.  However, a 3D volume and tonnage model was constructed in 

2007 for Vaaldiam by Wardrop. 

 

15.3 Database 
 

Three sources of data were supplied to Howe by Vaaldiam for the Mineral Resource estimation work.   

 

 The 2007 Wardrop 3D volumetric model that was based on 78 drillholes drilled on the B3 

kimberlite by both De Beers and Vaaldiam respectively; 

 The primary spatial data for grade estimation are the three recently completed surface bulk 

samples as there are no available macro diamond grade data at depth.  The bulk samples 

were also carried out to obtain a diamond valuation in order to complete in-house revenue 

and size frequency distribution analysis.  The diamond recoveries and hence diamond 

grade are quoted at a 1.0 mm bottom screen cut off; and, 

 The bulk density data are obtained from drill core.   

 

 

In order to complete the data validation and modifications to Wardrop's 3D volumetric model, the 

following digital data files were provided to Howe are listed below:  

 

 bulk density data in Excel format files;  

 diamond drilling logs as Excel format files; and; 

 Wardrop's 2007 geological/volumetric wireframes as Gemcom format BT2 files.

II core drilling and proposed delineation drill holes (see Section 18.0 - Recommendations). 

 

15.4 Volumetric Model 
 

As stated in section 17.3, the 2007 Wardrop 3D volumetric model of the B3 kimberlite was supplied to 

Howe by Vaaldiam.  Howe carried out a number of checks and reconciliations on the 3D volumetric 

model and incorporated new mini bulk collar survey data obtained by Vaaldiam to the database.  From the 

review of the Vaaldiam drill hole collar data file, several mini bulk collars were not accurately located 

when the 2007 Wardrop volumetric model was constructed.  As such, with the revised drill collar 

database obtained from Vaaldiam, the 2007 Wardrop volumetric model was modified where required by 

Howe to obtain a more accurate representation of the 3D volumetric model for the B3 kimberlite.   

 

Since the kimberlite matrix of the B3 kimberlite is considered homogenous for this resource estimate, 

there are no internal geological divisions within the 3D volumetric model.  Due to the complexity of 

modelling internal dilution from drill core, the internal crustal dilution contained in the North Lobe of the 



 

94 

 

B3 kimberlite was not modelled or separated out within the 3D volumetric model of the North Lobe.  As 

a result, the volume estimate obtained for the North Lobe represents both kimberlite and internal dilution 

for this resource estimate. 

 

Based on the drillhole intercepts of crustal xenoliths for drillholes contained within the North Lobe 3D 

volumetric model, an estimated average internal dilution of 36% was determined by Howe (Table 15.1).    

Table 15.1. B3: North Lobe Dilution Estimates 

Drillhole ID Dilution % 

BR03-DH48 18 

BR03-DH51 31 

BR03-DH52 48 

BR03-DH55 49 

Average 36 

 

Dilution estimates per drillhole were calculated as follows: 

 

Dilution = 
  
                            

  
                                          

 
       

 

The dilution estimate obtained from the North Lobe drill data of 36% compares well to Vaaldiam's 

estimate of the internal dilution of 41% within the Sample 3 (North Lobe) trench.  As such, it's assumed 

that the internal dilution of the North Lobe is consistent throughout and that no adjustment to the average 

diamond grade of Sample 3 was carried out for this resource estimate. 

 

The modifications to the 3D volumetric model have increased the total volume for the B3 kimberlite by 

3% to 2.256 million m
3
 whereby the increase in volume was primarily located in the South lobe (Figure 

15.2).  The highest point in elevation of the 3D volumetric model is 285m above sea level (asl) and the 

lowest is at 80m asl.

volumetric model; brown are the adjusted areas based on Vaaldiam's revised drillhole 

collar locations. 

 

 

15.5 Compositing 
 

Due to the lack of sample grade data points at depth (i.e. number of samples collected) for the B3 

kimberlite, sample composites were not calculated for this resource estimate.  Since the sample data 

points consist of the 3 individual bulk samples, two of which (Samples 1 and 2 from the South Lobe) 

overlie one another and are treated as sub-samples for this resource estimate), the diamond grade (diluted) 

obtained for the South Lobe trench sample location were arithmetically averaged (24.58 cpht) in order to 

consider it as one sample point for this resource estimate.   

 

15.6 Spatial Data Analysis 
 

Due to a lack of sample grade data in both a horizontal plane and at depth, computer generated 

variograms could not be determined / calculated for this resource estimate.  In order to determine what 

appropriate "ranges" are to be used, Howe relied on the geological continuity of the kimberlite in both 

horizontal and vertical directions.  This was done by reviewing the nomimal 25 m spacing between 

individual drillholes across the two kimberlite lobes.  Since the geological continuity of the kimberlite is 

well defined horizontally, a range of 50m x 50 m was assigned by Howe.  While the geological continuity 

of the kimberlite is well defined at depth, the macro diamond grade at depth is not well established due to 

a lack of sampling.  As such, Howe assigned a maximum vertical range of 40m for the Indicated Resource 

for this resource estimate  

 

The following ranges were defined for local block resource estimation.

15.7 Specific Gravity – Bulk Density 
 

The specific gravity data utilized for the resource model (see Section 9.99.9), was collected from 1,318 

bulk density determinations measurements obtained by Vaaldiam.  Of the 1,318 bulk density 

measurements, no bulk density measurements were collected in the weathered/saprolitic portion of the B3 

kimberlite.  As such, the average bulk density value obtained from grab samples collected from the bulk 

sample pits were used to define the density of the saprolite for the density block model. 

 

These bulk density measurements were then interpreted and interpolated by Micromine to create a density 

block model for each of the saprolitic and primary portions of the each kimberlite lobe.  This method of 

bulk density determination was deemed to be the most representative and "quantifiable" way to introduce 

bulk density data into the block modeling process, as opposed to using an overall average bulk density 

measurement for each of the saprolitic and primary zones of the B3 kimberlite for resource estimation 

purposes.   

 

Table 15.1 summarizes the average bulk density values obtained from the Micromine density block model 

for each of the kimberlite lobes.

15.8 Diamond Statistics –Bulk Sampling Program 
 

Vaaldiam completed a diamond statistical study of the B3 kimberlite and the end of the bulk sampling 

program.  Vaaldiam compiled all diamond data from drill core MiDa analysis, mini bulk sampling and 

bulk sampling to plot a diamond Size Frequency Distribution curve ("SFD"). 

 

Based on the diamond data, Vaaldiam's bulk sampling diamond data shows that the grades and the mean 

diamond size distribution for the South lobe has a similar slope to the microdiamond derived curve 

(Figure 15.3).  However, Vaaldiam's bulk sampling diamond data for the North lobe shows that the 

grades and the mean diamond size distribution has a similar slope to the microdiamond derived curve for 

the North but it indicates that it underestimates the lack of large stones'recovered and its effect on the 

diamond grade (see Figure 15.3).  The lack of recovering larger stones is primarily due to the small 



 

97 

 

diamond sample size obtained from the bulk sample.  Also of note is that the difference in height between 

both curves may imply that both kimberlite lobes have a different diamond population.   

 

Howe is of the opinion that the diamond statistics obtained from the North Lobe bulk sample is too small 

(35.42 carats) and that the results from the stone frequency distribution study suggest that the sample may 

not be representative of the North Lobe diamond distribution and concentration.  

 

However, based on the similarity of the SFD curve for both the North and South lobes, the diamond grade 

obtained from the bulk samples for each kimberlite lobe was used as the grade variable for determining 

the Inferred Resource estimate at depth.

15.9 Local Block Estimation 
 

The local estimation of grade was carried out on a per kimberlite lobe basis.  Where possible hard 

boundaries were applied in the estimation, that is, only sample data from a kimberlite lobe is used to 

estimate that lobe.  The geological connotation of this approach is that contacts are non-gradational and 

transition zones between lobes and within each lobe are at a scale less than the block estimate (50 m). 

 

The local block estimation approach was as follows: 

 

1. Once the 3D volumetric model was completed, a bulk density model was created and used to 
apply a bulk density value (by Inverse Distance square algorithm  "ID2") to each 25m x 25m x 



 

98 

 

10m block volume populating each lobe (and domain – saprolite and fresh kimberlite) to obtain 

an estimated tonnage value per block and per kimberlite lobe;  

 

2. Once a tonnage value was obtained, the defined search ellipsoids utilized by Howe for estimating 
both the Indicated and Inferred Resource category ranges was then carried out to determine the 

number of blocks and tonnage that occur within each resource category. The resource output 

provided a volume, tonnage and the calculated average bulk density obtained for each mineral 

resource category. Sub-blocking was also used to accurately define volumes and tonnages for the 

saprolite / fresh kimberlite boundary for both lobes.  

 

3. The average bulk sample diamond grade per lobe (in carats per tonne) was then used to estimate 
the total carats for each resource category on a per lobe basis.  

 

 

The search ellipses for each Mineral Resource category were determined based on pre-determined ranges 

stated in Section 15.615.6.  The block interpolation parameters per kimberlite lobe are shown in Table 

15.3.  To categorize all Inferred category resource blocks within the 3D volumetric model, it was 

necessary to carry out a second pass of block interpolation with a larger search ellipse to populate 

uninformed blocks at depth from the original point sample at surface.  The hard boundary constraint was 

maintained for the second pass estimation procedures by containing the blocks within the 3D volumetric 

model.  A block model size of 25 m x 25 m x 10 m was selected for modelling based on drillhole spacing. 

 

The assumption of a single stone size per kimberlite lobe from the surface bulk samples assumes that the 

diamond liberation rate from mining and processing kimberlitic material from the saprolitic horizon is 

consistent with depth.  However, it is Howe's opinion that due to the lack of granulometry, or particle size 

distribution data from the fresh kimberlite at depth, it is not known if the single stone size will be similar 

to the surface bulk samples or lower since diamond liberation rates are lower in fresh kimberlite.  As such 

Howe has assumed that the stone size (and thus grade) will remain constant for this resource estimate.

15.10 Resource Inventory – Local Block Estimation Method 
 

With the application of the average diamond grade sample per kimberlite lobe and determination of the 

diamond grade with respect to fresh versus weathered kimberlite, it is possible to compile a carat resource 

inventory.  The resource inventory based on the local block estimation method is summarised below:

comprise 1,172,000 carats in 6.2 Mt at an average grade of 19 cpht at a 1.0 mm bottom cut off.  

 

15.11 Cross Validation 

 

In order to verify the validity of the results obtained from the local block estimation method, a global 

resource estimate was carried out by Howe for cross validation / check purposes.  The global resource 

estimate was carried out in the following manner: 

 

Dividing the individual kimberlite lobes into 2 separate sections to a depth of 235 mRL (the "vertical 

extent" of the Indicated Resource) with a dividing line placed vertically through the central part of the 3D 

volumetric model to separate the North and South lobes; 

 

 Obtaining the volumes for each section of each kimberlite lobe; 

 Calculate the tonnage for each lobe and section using an average SG of 2.70; 

 Calculating the total carats by multiplying the tonnage x grade (diluted and undiluted) for 

each pipe.  These grades are considered as zonal grades for the purpose of this resource 

estimate. 

 

The global resource inventory using both a diluted and undiluted bulk sample diamond grade is 

summarized below:

15.11.1 Comparison of Results - Reconciliation 

 

The results obtained from both the local block resource estimate and the global/zonal resource estimate 

compare favourably with respect to the estimated total carats contained with the B3 pipe.  The local block 

resource estimate in terms of total carats is higher but compares very well (< 1% difference) with the 

result obtained from the diluted grade global/zonal resource estimate (see Tables 15.5. and 15.6).  The 

main difference between the local block and global resource estimation methods is the higher amount of 

Indicated Resources (~ 50% increase) allocated to both the North and South lobes via the global resource 

estimate.  This increase is due to the fixed depth height set for determining the Indicated Resource in the 

global estimate method as oppose to using a defined search ellipse and density block model estimates for 



 

101 

 

calculating the number of carats contained per defined resource block (25 m x 25m x 10m per block) for 

the local block estimate.   

 

15.12  Mineral Resource Classification 

15.12.1 Classification Parameters 

 

In classifying the Mineral Resource, qualitative levels of confidence in the volumetric model and the 

resource estimates made up of volume, grade, density and diamond valuation were assessed.  The 

assessment also considered data integrity, resource calculation methodology and adherence to procedures.  

The results of the classification are summarized in Table 15.7 below:

North Lobe Indicated Indicated Indicated Inferred Inferred 

South Lobe Indicated Indicated Indicated Inferred Inferred 

 

 

15.12.2 Resource Classification Risk Factors - Discussion  

 

The resource estimate risk for the North Lobe is the amount and distribution of internal crustal dilution 

within the lobe, plus the small size and irregular "root zone" nature of the body that may impact volume 

estimates and edge dilution.   

 

For the entire B3 kimberlite, a "3D volumetric" model was constructed in which internal geological units 

were not modelled separately.  As such, any variation in diamond grades for this mineral resource 

estimate is considered low since the resource estimate is based on two sample points and that the weakly 

to moderately saprolitized kimberlitic material that the bulk samples were derived from did not undergo a 

volume reduction due to the chemical weathering of the original fresh kimberlite.  In using the carats per 

tonne grade obtained from the individual bulk samples for the mineral resource estimate, Howe has 

assumed that there was little or no volumetric reduction of the original fresh kimberlite thus no change in 

the concentration of diamonds (i.e number of stones contained) recovered from the individual bulk 

samples.   

 

Composited micro-diamond data were plotted with that obtained from the bulk samples to confirm that 

the diamond sample grades obtained from the surface bulk samples can be used for estimating both a 

local block estimate and a global / zonal grade (overall average grade assigned to all blocks) at depth for 

the B3 pipe.  This resource estimate is in effect a "point" sample resource estimate (i.e. surface sample 

points only) as it does not represent a three dimensional spatial grade estimate at depth if sample grade 

data were available.   

 

To a depth of 50m (235mRL) the bulk sample grade data are reasonable and geological drillholes are at 

roughly 50 m grid spacing and to a depth averaging 200m with one drillhole at 250m depth.  Although 

variograms indicating grade continuity and predictability could not be determined due to a lack of sample 

grade data at depth for both kimberlite lobes, grade interpolation ranges were defined by Howe for both 



 

102 

 

the Indicated and Inferred Resource categories to be used for the local block resource estimate method.  

Similar methods were applied for estimating the global resource estimation method but with geological 

input defining the boundaries for both the Indicated / Inferred Resources depth limit and for dividing the 

kimberlite body into two distinct lobes for volume, tonnage and grade estimation purposes.  This 

geological input was a factor in estimating a higher percentage of Indicated Resources and carats 

contained as oppose to the results obtained from the local block estimation method.   

 

As a result, the global resource estimation grade model is considered reliable of the resource estimate for 

B3.  As such, the North and South lobes are considered an Indicated Mineral Resource to a depth of 50 m 

(235 mRL) and an Inferred Mineral Resource thereafter to an average depth of 205 m (80 mRL) below 

surface.

17.0 17.0 Interpretation and Conclusions 

Based on the interpretations and conclusions that have been identified from the diamond resource 

estimate of the B3 kimberlite is as follows: 

 

1. Based on the deep core drilling that was undertaken pre-2007, the geological extent of the B3 
kimberlite as been defined to a maximum depth of 250m, thus identifying the potential for 

additional Mineral Resources at depth; 

 

2. The B3 south lobe contain diamond concentrations that have the potential to be economic, 
whereas the B3 north lobe contain diamond concentrations that are low due to the dilutional 

effect of the granodiorite contained within that lobe; 

 

3. The results of the 2010 large-scale surface bulk sampling program of the B3 provided a 
representative sample on the diamond grade, diamond distribution and diamond quality for the 

South lobe; 

 

4. The results of the 2010 large-scale surface bulk sampling program of the B3 North lobe did not 
provide a representative sample on the diamond grade, diamond distribution and diamond quality, 

however the result is possibly representative of the potential recovered diamond grade that could 

be expected if the lobe was to be mined; 

 

5. The results of the latest revised Mineral Resource estimate are tabulated in Table 15.5 and Table 
15.6.  The Mineral Resource estimate of the B3 kimberlite is based on the geological continuity 

of the kimberlite contained within each lobe at surface and at depth, and the diamond grades 

obtained from the recently completed surface bulk sample program.  This Mineral Resource is 

considered to be a "point" sample resource since the sample grade density is low; 

 

6. There is additional potential for the B3 whereby the Inferred Mineral Resource at depth could be 
extended beyond the 250m level.  The potential quantity and grade of any potential Mineral 

Resources beyond the 250mRL is conceptual in nature as there is insufficient exploration to 

define a Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being 

delineated as a Mineral Resource. 

 

7. The completed 2010 bulk sample work program has met the original objective of obtaining 
diamond data (grade, diamond valuation) in order to carry out the Mineral Resource for the B3 

kimberlite.

18.0 18.0 Recommendations and Proposed Work Program 

Vaaldiam's advanced exploration program budget for the Braúna Kimberlite project work program for 

2011 is estimated at $200,000 dollars.  The 2011 exploration work programs consist of additional infill 

core drilling, completion of additional surface bulk sampling.  Based on the technical data and 

encouraging diamond results obtained to date from its large-scale surface kimberlite bulk sampling 

program and diamond valuation, it is Howe's opinion, that the B3 Kimberlite warrants additional work, 

and Howe fully concurs with the 2011 work program that Vaaldiam plans to execute in order to complete 

a preliminary economic assessment ("PEA") of the B3 kimberlite. 

 

Vaaldiam is currently carrying-out the PEA on the B3 Kimberlite in order to collect the necessary data to 

determine the project's viability under current economic conditions.  Vaaldiam anticipates that the PEA 

will be completed by Q2 2011.  Based on favourable results from the PEA, a pre-feasibility or a full 

bankable feasibility study could be started by Q3 2011.   

 

The pre-feasibility study ("PFS") work program will entail the collection of additional exploration 

information, such as geological, geotechnical, geometallurgical and other relevant information to 

delineate and define the B3 Kimberlite, with a sufficient level of confidence, to estimate a revised Mineral 

Resource in accordance to National Instrument 43-101 and Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 

Petroleum ("CIM") standards.  The data collection, interpretation, modelling and estimation will be done 

in a phased manner and will be continuously reviewed on an ongoing basis as new information comes to 

light. 

 

In order to estimate the revised Mineral Resource from the kimberlite lobes, a surface diamond core 

drilling ("SDCD") and/or large diameter drilling (17.5 inch or 24 inch diameter) reverse circulation 

program ("LDD") and additional surface bulk sampling will be undertaken by Vaaldiam.  The surface 

core drilling is planned on a grid pattern to further delineate and define the kimberlite / country rock 

contacts at depth in three dimensions, to establish the geological continuity at depth as well as to obtain 

geotechnical information. 

 

The overall objective of both the SCDC the LDD campaign is to establish the kimberlite grade in a 3-D 

spatial fashion.  If an LDD drilling rig cannot be obtained to do the work, it is recommended that large 

core diameter drilling (PQ size – 85 mm diameter) be carried out in order to obtain macro diamond grade 

data at depth.  A series of PQ drill holes sites are to be drilled in an area so that sufficient amount of drill 

core can be obtained for sample processing.  These PQ drill cores can either be processed through 

Vaaldiam's mini bulk sampling plant whereby the bottom screen to be used is 1mm or the samples are 

sent to a 3
rd

 party laboratory for macro and MiDa recovery by caustic fusion. 

 

Additional core drilling is also planned for the collection of metallurgical samples for ore dressing test 

work. 

 

Once the revised Mineral Resource has been estimated, qualifying factors such as the proposed mining 

method, metallurgy, geotechnical, hydrological, environmental, location, marketing, legal, revenue, costs, 

capital and social, will be used to convert the economically mineable part of the Indicated (or Measured) 

Mineral Resource to a Mineral Reserve as part of the PFS. 

 

The PFS will include a financial and risk analysis, a desktop engineering study and data from an 

environmental baseline study to commence in Q4 2011.
