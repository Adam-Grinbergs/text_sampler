1.0 SUMMARY 

Ronacher McKenzie Geoscience ("Ronacher McKenzie") of Sudbury, Ontario, Canada was contracted by 

Northstar Gold Corp. ("Northstar") to review the Miller Gold Property (the "Property") located in the 

Catharine, Pacaud, Boston and McElroy Townships in northeastern Ontario and prepare an Independent 

Technical Report (the "Report"). The Report was prepared in accordance with the National Instrument 43-

101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101").  

The Property is located in the Larder Lake Mining Division of Northeastern Ontario, 18 km south of 

Kirkland Lake and 5 km east of the village of Boston Creek within the Catharine, Pacaud, Boston and 

McElroy Townships. The Property consists of 84 contiguous, unpatented claim cells covering 

approximately 1,100 ha in the Larder Lake Mining Division.  All claims are 100% owned by Northstar.  In 

addition, Northstar also holds two Freehold Patents L17916 and L17917 with both mining and surface 

rights in the northwest corner of Catharine Township, which are contiguous with the rest of the Property. 

Each patent has an area of 15.83 ha for a total of 31.67 ha. Surface rights for the mining claims are 

owned by the Crown, except for 11 SRO patents which are held by third parties.   

The Miller Gold Property is located within the Archean volcano sedimentary assemblage of rocks of the 

Western Abitibi Subprovince in the Superior Province. Metavolcanic rocks in the Property area of known 

age fall in the range of 2750 - 2700 Ma and are cut by an Algoman age granitic intrusion. Most of the 

metavolcanics are of the Catharine Assemblage, which consists of mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks, 

subordinate pyroxene komatiite and minor felsic metavolcanic rocks. Ultramafic and mafic to intermediate 

intrusive rocks occur as stocks and sills emplaced into the metavolcanic rocks. Relatively undeformed, 

younger alkaline to calc-alkaline felsic intrusive rocks were emplaced into the metavolcanic rocks as 

irregular stocks and dykes, which include the Allied, West Allied, Planet, and Meilleur syenite intrusions.  

These named 'Syenite' intrusions were U/Pb on zircon dated at 2662+- 18 Ma and are highly altered from the leaching of quartz 

and addition of Na.   These intrusions are an important spatial component of the Miller Gold Property geology 

and the location of the gold mineralization.   Lamprophyre dykes cut all other units.  

Numerous faults transect the predominately pillow, tholeiitic, mafic metavolcanic and supracrustal rocks. 

The most important faults are the north-west striking Pacaud Fault, Catharine Fault and east-northeast 

striking secondary faults, all of which displace the Assemblage units.  

The Miller Gold Property hosts a large scale hydrothermal system with indications of multi-stage and long-

lived magmatic gold deposition associated with large scale intense metasomatism and pervasive 

alteration. Geochronological Re/Os and U/Pb age dating has found the mineralization is associated with

the Temiskaming magmatic event (2680 to 2660 Ma) contemporaneously with the age of gold deposits 

along the Kirkland Lake Main Break. This is consistent with the Au-Ag-Bi-Cu-Mo-Te signature of the gold 

mineralization on the Property similar to that of some gold deposits in Kirkland Lake Camp.  Evidence 

indicates that the Miller gold deposits and the Kirkland Lake gold deposits were formed 

contemporaneously and derived from a common gold enriched magmatic hydrothermal reservoir at 

depth.  The Catharine Fault Zone which crosscuts the Miller Gold Property is interpreted as a broad 

composite "first order structure" capable of channelling deep seated exsolved magmatic hydrothermal 

fluids into favourable sites of gold deposition, namely intrusive contacts and cross cutting second order 

structures. The gold on the Property is known to be situated within both shallowly dipping and northeast 

striking, sub-vertical quartz veins along with northwest trending porphyritic dikes and syenite stocks 

hosted within the mafic volcanic rocks.  Gold mineralization in the area commonly has a nuggety 

character and coarse texture occurring in native form or as tellurides and may or may not be associated 

with disseminated pyrite.  There is potential for the discovery and outline of a large gold resource on the 

Property beyond the scope of the high grade, but narrow, shallowly dipping quartz vein mineralization 

historically exploited to-date.  

The mining history of the Miller Gold Property dates to the early 1900s with the discovery of gold and 

development of the Miller – Independence Mine.  Official reported production is 58.5 ounces Au and 70 

ounces Ag from a 31 ton bulk sample of recovery grade of 1.89 oz/ton Au; however, based upon the mine 

workings and amount of what appears to be waste rock identified throughout the Property the true 

production may have been considerably higher.  A shaft was built near the original discovery.  A flat, 

faulted vein estimated to contain 1,800 tons of mineralized material was discovered during that period.  

Besides the original development work, the only other significant exploration completed was during 1987-

88 in which Nortek Exploration completed 37 diamond drill holes and estimated a grade and tonnage for 

the Miller-Independence deposit.  

During the summer of 2014 Northstar Gold completed a diamond drill program to follow-up on positive 

historic drilling and previous ground Induced Polarization (IP) survey results completed on the Property in 

early 2014.  The drilling, completed from June 4 - 27, 2014, comprised of 15 NQ holes totaling 1,778.5 

metres. In addition, 773 surface samples were obtained and analyzed during the summers of 2012-2016. 

The most encouraging results from this drill program came from drill testing the Allied Syenite intrusion, in 

holes MG14-03, MG14-07, and MG14-09 to MG14-12 located in the northern central part of the Property 

in northeastern Pacaud Township.  The 2014 summer drill program established that the Allied Syenite is 

part of a large-scale gold-enriched intrusive system that hosts widespread stringers and historically mined 

veins both within the intrusive and the surrounding basaltic rocks on the Miller Gold Property.

Exploration during 2015, conducted by Northstar's joint venture partner Oban Mining Corporation 

("Oban"), was focused on determining the potential economics for gold mineralization in the Allied, Planet, 

and Meilleur syenites which have geological characteristics and an observed style of mineralization 

commonly found within syenite-associated disseminated gold deposits – an atypical form of the 

greenstone-hosted orogenic lode gold style of mineralization. The gold mineralization in the area of the 

historic Miller Independence Mine, south of the Allied Syenite, has many of the characteristics of 

greenstone-hosted quartz-carbonate vein deposits type, but was not drill-tested in 2015.  In 2015, Oban 

performed surface mapping, bedrock sampling, and drilled 12 diamond drill holes totaling 4,067 m. This 

work tested the gold mineralization in the area of these 3 intrusions and in the adjacent metavolcanic 

rocks with the results suggesting that mineralization both within and adjacent to the intrusions is 

controlled by the related structures. 

The 2014 and 2015 drill programs established that the Allied, Planet and Meilleur syenites are central to a 

large-scale gold-enriched intrusive system that hosts widespread stringers and historically mined veins.  

Determining a final size and gold grade for the mineralized alkaline intrusive hosted system will require a 

major drilling program. 

Northstar collected a 932 tonne bulk sample from the high-grade gold quartz No. 1 Vein in 2016. The bulk 

sampling program was undertaken to follow-up positive diamond drilling and surface sampling results 

obtained in 2014 and 2015.  The objectives of the 2016 bulk sampling program were two-fold; first to 

obtain a sizable bulk sample to assess the gold grade, dilution and mineability of the stripped surface 

exposures; and second to explore the cleaned blasted areas by conducting channel sampling to assess 

continuity of the gold mineralization along strike and down-dip, to aid in planning follow-up bulk sampling 

and drill testing exploration. In general, bulk sample mineralized material was obtained from surface 

quartz vein exposures (or very near surface extensions) including approximately 0.5 m widths of 

bounding altered basalt wall rock carrying lower gold values. 

The 932 tonne bulk sample was collected using an excavator during the period October 28 to November 

18, 2016 and was processed at the Camflo Mill operated by Richmond Mines Inc. near Malartic, Quebec.  

The bulk sampling program entailed the stripping of areas of 4 trenches, subsequent blasting and 

excavating of Trenches 1 to 3 and mining.  Approximately 850 tonnes of the 932 tonne bulk sample were 

mined from Trench 1 plus 82 tonnes from Trench 3.  During the bulk sampling program 241 trench 

evaluation and bulk in-situ field samples were gathered and assayed for gold content for comparison 

purposes.  These samples included mineralized material from cut channels in bedrock and blasted rock 

pieces predominantly from the 4 trenches. The bulk sampling program was generally successful in its 

objectives, more specifically in demonstrating the presence of high-grade, continuous, mineralized gold

zones over albeit narrow widths for the main No. 1 Vein and other veins on the Property. The bulk sample 

program allowed Northstar to project the probable trend and down-dip attitude of the No.1 Vein zone for 

follow-up exploration and additional bulk sampling.   

Trevor Boyd, P.Geo., visited the Property in November and December of 2016, designed and monitored 

Northstar's bulk sampling  Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QA/QC) program, choose samples for 

geochemical analysis and reviewed Northstar's ground and drilling exploration work conducted since it 

acquired the Property in 2012.  QA/QC support was also provided in the delivery and mill head sampling 

of the bulk sample for contract gold milling at the Camflo Gold Mill in northeastern Quebec.  Elisabeth 

Ronacher, P.Geo., visited the Property on June 7, 2018. Ms. Ronacher reviewed the 2015 drill core and 

collected drill core and grab check samples. 

The authors of this Report conclude that based upon new exploration results and concepts, past 

exploration, development and gold production, the encouraging positive results from the bulk and surface 

sampling program and recent drilling by Northstar and Oban; a systematic exploration program is 

warranted to qualify and expand historic mineral resources known to occur on the Property and define 

new mineralized zones, with the goal of defining a NI 43-101 mineral resource on the Property.  This 

systematic program would involve an initial phase of drill hole and sampling data verification, digitizing of 

results, and 3D geological and geophysical modeling to establish diamond drill targets.  A critical review 

of past sample preparation, analytical procedures and QA/QC should be conducted prior to any additional 

drilling on the Property.  This would entail the selective resampling of drill core, sample pulps and rejects 

from previous drilling with the purpose of confirming that the amount of gold in the samples is not being 

under-reported and accurately being measured.   

A follow-up program of extended IP/resistivity surveying, shallow closely-spaced oriented-core diamond 

drilling, additional stripping, trenching, and bulk sampling is recommended for the Property.  This should 

be followed by detailed modelling of the results in preparation for a resource estimation following the 

standards of the NI 43-101 to be completed for both the near surface No. 1 Vein, D vein, Allied and 

Planet syentites mineralized areas.  It is also recommended that Northstar make a concerted effort to 

further consolidate and expand the Miller Gold Property through the acquisition of adjacent and proximal 

mineral claims with historic gold workings and mineralized prospects.

2.0 INTRODUCTION  

Ronacher McKenzie Geoscience Inc. ("Ronacher McKenzie") of Sudbury, Ontario, Canada was 

contracted by Northstar Gold Corp. ("Northstar") of New Liskeard, Ontario, Canada to complete an 

Independent 43-101 Technical Report ("Report") on the Miller Gold Property (the "Property") during the 

spring of 2018. The report was prepared in accordance with the National Instrument 43-101 – Standards 

of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101"). 

The purpose of the Report is to support Northstar in a Qualifying Transaction (QT) to go public. Another 

purpose is to summarize the exploration completed on the Property to date and to provide 

recommendations to advance the Property so that Northstar and potential investors can make informed 

decisions. The focus of the Report is on the diamond drilling and bulk sampling undertaken on the 

Property since the summer of 2014.  

The sources of information for this Report include exploration and tenure data provided by Northstar, 

Northstar's joint-venture partner in 2015, Oban Mining Corporation ("Oban"; now Osisko Mining Inc.), 

publicly available data, information collected during the site visits and references cited in section 19.0. In 

particular, this Report draws upon 3 Technical Reports completed since 2015: Boyd and Selway (2015; 

"Independent Technical Report Miller Gold Property Kirkland Lake Ontario" on behalf of Oban Mining 

Corporation and Northstar), Hart (2015; "Technical Report on the Miller Property, Boston, Pacaud, 

McElroy and Catherine townships Ontario" for Oban Mining Corporation) and Boyd (2017; "Technical 

Report Miller Gold Property Kirkland Lake Ontario" prepared for Northstar).   

The first named report was filed and is available on SEDAR for Oban Mining Corporation dated April 17, 

2015.  A site visit was conducted by Trevor Boyd, P.Geo., an Independent Qualified Person in 

accordance with the NI 43-101, on March 27, 2015 with the purpose of checking locations of claim posts 

using GPS, focusing on the newly staked claims in January 2015 and choosing independent site-visit drill 

core samples to be analyzed at a third laboratory. 

Another site visit was completed to the Miller Gold Property by Trevor Boyd from October 28 to November 

18, 2016, to referee, monitor and aid in guiding the surface and bulk sampling program on the Property.  

Trevor Boyd, the author of this Report, visited the Camflo Mill to monitor and sample the delivered bulk 

sample during December 1 to 3.  The process and results of the bulk sampling program were reviewed in 

a Technical Report (Boyd 2017).

Another site visit was completed by Elisabeth Ronacher, P.Geo., an Independent Qualified Person in 

accordance with the NI 43-101, on June 7, 2018. Ms. Ronacher reviewed several drill holes from the 

2015 drilling program, collected check samples from the 2015 drill core, visited the areas of the Planet 

and Allied Syenites and the trenches completed in 2016 and collected grab samples from the trenches. 

The assay results of the drill core samples generally correspond with the original values considering the 

nuggety nature of the mineralization. The grab sample results indicate that gold occurs in the area of the 

Planet Syenite and in the area of the trenches. 

2.1 Terminology 

Activation Laboratories Inc. ("Actlabs"): Analytical laboratory firm with multiple locations including 

Thunder Bay and Ancaster, Ontario 

AGAT Laboratories Inc. ("AGAT"):  Analytical laboratory firm with multiple locations including 

Mississauga, Ontario. 

Fire Assay:  Fire assay is the method of choice for gold analysis. The procedure involves mixing an 

aliquot of the sample (e.g., 30 g or 50 g) with a flux agent (e.g., sodium borate, PbO) and a "collector" 

such as silver. The mixture is heated to ~1150 °C. The lead and silver settle to the bottom of the melt and 

the silver scavenges gold as it sinks. The lead and silver button are cupelled at 950 °C. The silver bead 

(which also contains gold) is dissolved and analyzed by atomic absorption or other techniques 

(http://actlabs.com). 

Inquartation:  Process whereupon the bead of silver or gold obtained by cupellation is squeezed 

between pliers, or flattened by a hammer on a clean anvil, to loosen the bone ash adhering to its lower 

surface, and is then cleaned by a brush of wires or stiff bristles 

ICP-MS: Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometer: An instrument capable of determining the 

concentrations of 70+ elements simultaneously by measuring the mass of ions generated by an argon 

gas plasma heated to 10,000°K and passing through a magnetic quadrupole to the detector. Capable of 

ultra-low detection limits (ppb to ppt) with very wide linear ranges (up to 7 orders of magnitude) (Acme 

Analytical Laboratories Ltd: www.acmelab.com). 

LIDAR:   Airborne to Satellite based surveying method that measures distance to a target by illuminating 

the target with pulsed laser light and measuring the reflected pulses with a sensor. Differences in laser 

return times and wavelengths can then be used to make digital 3-D representations of the target.

Merrill-Crowe Gold Mill ("Merrill-Crowe"): The Merrill–Crowe Process is a gold milling technique for 

removing gold from a cyanide solution. The solution is separated from the ore by methods such as 

filtration (clarification) and decantation. Oxygen is then removed by passing the solution through a 

vacuum de-aeration column. Zinc dust is added to the clarified, de-aerated solution which precipitates the 

gold; zinc having a higher affinity or the cyanide ion than gold. The gold precipitate (mixed with zinc dust) 

is then filtered out of the solution, and the zinc dust and gold are mixed with sulfuric acid to dissolve the 

zinc. The solution is filtered, and the remaining solids are smelted to a gold doré bar. The basic process 

was discovered and patented by Charles Washington Merrill around 1900, and later refined by Thomas B. 

Crowe, working for the Merrill Company.  

Metallic Screen Analysis:  A representative split of the sample (i.e. 250 to 2,000 g) is sieved at 100 

mesh (149 am) with fire assays performed on the entire +100 mesh and 2 splits on the -100 mesh 

fraction.  The total amount of sample and the +100 mesh and -100 mesh fraction is weighed for assay 

reconciliation.

4.3 Oban-Northstar Option 

On February 22, 2015, a joint venture agreement (Agreement) was signed between Oban and Northstar 

which allowed Oban to acquire up to 70% interest on the Property from Northstar.  Under the terms of the 

Agreement, the Company could earn up to a 51% interest in the Property by subscribing for $300,000 in 

common shares of Northstar at $0.10 per share and making payments and incurring expenditures of $3 

million over three years. Oban could earn a further 9% interest by making payments and incurring 

expenditures equal to $2 million by the fifth anniversary, and a further 10% by the sixth anniversary for 

payments and expenditures equal to a further $3.3 million or, at the option of Oban, $2 million and a 

commitment to fund the Property through to completion of a pre-feasibility study.  The Joint venture 

agreement was terminated in December 2015 and Oban earned no interest in the Property. 

4.4 Obligations 

As part of Ontario's work to modernize the Mining Act, a transition has been completed to a 24/7 Mining 

Lands Administration System (MLAS) and to online mining claim registration and recording which requires 

the adjustment of administrative fees related to registering new cell claims as well as other associated 

mining lands transactions.  New and adjusted fees were introduced on April 10th, 2018 concurrent with 

the launch of MLAS. Key among these is the establishment of a new fee required to register cell claims in 

MLAS.  In the new system, registering a mining claim will be completed by on-line payment of a single 

registration fee of $50 per cell claim unit.    

In Ontario to retain a mining claim, companies must still submit an assessment work file to the Ontario 

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines (MNDM) Geoscience Assessment Office.  For 

MLAS annual assessment work requirements will remain largely unchanged, despite new cell sizes being 

11 to 50 per cent larger than the size of current claim units.  Assessment work requirements are $400 per 

cell claim and $200 per boundary claim or any claim that is encumbered.  Unlike some other jurisdictions, 

there will be no other fee requirement such as an annual claim renewal fee, or a graduated system for 

rising fees and assessment work.   

Property tax is required to be paid to the Ontario Ministry of Finance on each patent. In 2018, the property 

tax for Northstar's L17917 (Parcel 322 SST) was $63.33. The property tax for L17916 (Parcel 323 SST) 

was also $63.33. The property taxes were paid and are in good standing. 

The Miller Gold Property is subject to 3 royalties:

1. Ashley Gold Mines Royalty: There is a 0.25% Net Smelter Return (NSR) with an option to buy out 

for $250,000 owed to Ashley Gold Mines on the Com Copper mine which represents 16 hectares 

covering the original legacy claim (4246848) in Pacaud Township. The remaining original claims 

representing 240 hectares (legacy claims 4201240, 4224525, 4201239, 4217728) in Catherine township 

also carry a 2% NSR owed to Ashley Gold Mines with a 1% buy back for $1,000,000 and a right of first 

refusal on the remaining 1% NSR. 

2. Franco-Nevada Corporation Royalty: There is a 3% NSR belonging to Franco-Nevada 

Corporation carried over in the deal on the 32 hectare Campbell Property in the northeast corner of 

Catherine township (patents L17916 and L17917). 

3. Lake Shore Gold Royalty: There is a 2% NSR owed to Lake Shore Gold on the Shoebox Property 

(legacy claim 4215970 with 6 units) representing 96 hectares with a 1% buy back for $1,000,000 and a 

right of first refusal on the remaining 1% NSR. Other than the above royalties, there are no other 

agreements on the Miller Gold Property. 

In order to undertake certain exploration activities on mining claims, leases or licenses of occupation, it is 

required to submit to the MNDM an Exploration Plan and Permit application.  These exploration activities 

include ground geophysical surveys, mechanized drilling, surface stripping, line cutting and pitting and 

trenching.   Northstar currently holds an exploration permit for stripping and trenching (PR-16-10887) 

valid until July 19, 2019.  The Company presently does not hold an Exploration Permit for diamond 

drilling.  

Surface rights owners must be notified when applying for an exploration permit.  Aboriginal communities 

potentially affected by the exploration permit activities will be consulted and have an opportunity to 

provide comments and feedback before a decision is made on the permit approval. 

There are no environmental liabilities on the mineral claims as the environmental liability of mineral claims 

is the responsibility of the crown.  In the future, if the mineral claims are converted to leases all historic 

shafts on the Property should be capped. Currently, 2 historic shafts near the main road have been 

capped.  Even though the Property is a brownfields site, there are no visible tailings on the surface. The 

Qualified Person is not aware of any royalties, back-in rights, payments, or other agreements and 

encumbrances to which the property is subject other than the ones listed above. To the best of Author's 

knowledge, there are no significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to 

perform work on the property.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Access 

The most convenient access to the Miller Gold Property is from Kirkland Lake via Highway 66, then south 

on Highway 112, then turning east on local road 564 to Boston Creek, then further east along a logging 

road for about 4 km to the property. Depending upon the weather the logging road may be at times be 

only 4-wheel drivable and have load restrictions on heavy vehicles. During the winter the road is ploughed 

only to Boston Creek. 

5.2 Climate and Vegetation 

The climate normal for 1971-2000 from Environment Canada for Kirkland Lake (closest weather station to 

the Property) indicate that the daily average temperature ranges from -18ºC in January to 17ºC in July. 

The average monthly accumulation of rain is around 95 mm from June to September. The average 

monthly accumulation of snow is 65 cm from December to January. 

Drilling can be conducted year round except for spring thaw from mid-March to May. Geological mapping 

and outcrop sampling can be conducted from May to November when there is no snow on the ground. 

Vegetation varies from black spruce and alders to jack pine, black spruce, birch, and poplar in well 

drained areas. Wildlife on the property may consist of moose, black bear, beaver, rabbit and spruce 

grouse. 

5.3 Physiography  

The topography of the Property consists of moderate to low relief with elevations ranging from 300 to 330 

metres above sea level. Most of the Property is wooded with a number of creeks and swampy areas 

throughout. 

5.4 Infrastructure and Local Resources 

The population of the nearest town, Kirkland Lake, is 8,483 people (Statistics Canada, 

www.statcan.gc.ca). Kirkland Lake is an economically vibrant mining town and a good source for labour, 

exploration supplies and general services. The area is well serviced by highways, a railway line and

hydro-electric power lines which extend to within 4 kilometres of the Property at Boston Creek. Figure 5-1 

shows the location of the Miller Gold Property with respect to local infrastructure.  

The Miller Gold Property is in the exploration stage and does not yet hold a resource/reserve estimate or 

a prefeasibility study; therefore, discussion on the sufficiency of surface rights for mining operations, 

potential tailings storage areas, potential waste disposal areas, heap pad leach pad areas and potential 

processing tailings storage area for mining operations is not relevant.

6.0 HISTORY 

The mining history of the Miller Gold Property dates to the early 1900s with the discovery of gold and 

development of the Miller – Independence Mine (French 1988).  Official reported production is 58.5 

ounces Au and 70 ounces Ag from a 31 ton bulk sample of recovery grade of 1.89 oz/ton Au; however,

based upon the mine workings and amount of what appears to be waste rock identified throughout the 

Property the true production may have been considerably higher.    

Besides the original development work, the only other significant exploration completed was during 1987-

88 in which Nortek Exploration completed 37 diamond drill holes and estimated a grade and tonnage for 

the Miller-Independence deposit at 808,000 tons at 0.335 oz/ton Au.  This number is a historical 

estimate, not compliant to 43-101 guidelines, provided for information only and is not to be relied 

upon.  The relevance of this historical estimate is as a rough guideline of possible resource on the 

Property. The key assumptions, parameters and methods to prepare this historical estimate are not 

known. The historical estimate does not use categories set out in sections 1.2 and 1.3 NI 43-101. A full 

assessment report is filed with MNDM by G.B. French (1988) in which this number is reported. This 

historical estimate can be updated to a current mineral resource by additional drilling. The Qualified 

Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resource and the 

issuer is not treating this historical estimate as a current mineral resource. 

The recorded exploration and development history based upon publication and assessment report review 

is listed in Table 6-1.

A total of 6 shafts were sunk on the property. Shaft A was 515 feet and 
did not cut any vein. Shaft B cut a vein at 21 feet (vertical depth). A 174 
foot drift was developed south of the vein. The Incline Shaft was 141 
feet with east and west drifts constructed. Shaft C was a total of 110 
feet. It crosscut a vein and a 30 inch wide mud seam at 44 and 62 feet, 
respectively. Shaft D had a total depth of 500 feet and crosscut Vein D. 
North of Vein D are 4 parallel fractures carrying gold grades. At the 
500-foot level, several iron and copper sulphides rich stringers were 
cut. The Jumbo Shaft was a 14 foot deep pit, which followed a 30 inch 
wide vein. The Jumbo Vein is 400 feet south of Vein D. Both Vein D 
and Jumbo Vein dip south and strike about 30 degrees north of east. In 
1918, 58.0 oz Au and 70.0 oz Ag from a 31 ton bulk sample of 1.89 
oz/ton Au recovery grade was produced.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Miller Gold Property is located within the Archean volcano-sedimentary assemblage of rocks of the 

Western Abitibi Subprovince in the Superior Province.  Description of the Abitibi greenstone belt is from 

Ayer et al. (2005) and geological description of the Property area and information on geological figures is 

mostly from Jackson (1994) and French (1988).   

The Abitibi greenstone belt is composed of east-trending synclines of mainly volcanic rocks and 

intervening domes cored by syn-volcanic and/or syn-tectonic plutonic rocks (gabbro-diorite, tonalite, and 

granite) alternating with east-trending bands of turbiditic wackes.  Most volcanic and sedimentary rocks 

dip vertically and are generally separated by east-trending faults with variable dips.   

Metavolcanic rocks in the Kirkland Lake area are the 2723-2720 Ma Stoughton-Roquemaure 

Assemblage, characterized by broad regions of tholeiitic basalts, komatiitic basalts, and komatiites with 

several relatively minor felsic volcanic centers. The volcanic assemblage is located on the northeast flank 

of the Round Lake Batholith located in the southwest part of Pacaud Township. The upper part of the 

Assemblage in this area, formerly referred to as the Catherine Group, is cut by Algoman Age granitic 

intrusions and is overlain by felsic volcanic rocks of the Skead Group, which is part of the Upper Blake 

River Assemblage (Figure 7-1).  Intermittent small pyritic sulphide zones occur in the metavolcanic rocks.  

Early Proterozoic diabase dykes crosscut the Archean rocks.  The regional metamorphic grade is 

greenschist facies.

7.2 Local and Property Geology  

The Miller Gold Property is underlain by northwest-trending ultramafic and mafic to intermediate 

metavolcanic rocks of the Pacaud Assemblage and the Catharine Group with the Stoughton-

Roquemaure Assemblage, to the southwest and intermediate to felsic metavolcanic rocks of the Skead 

Group, Blake River Assemblage to the northeast. Occasional ultramafic and mafic to intermediate 

intrusive rocks occur as stocks and sills emplaced into the metavolcanic rocks. Relatively undeformed, 

alkaline to calc-alkaline felsic intrusive rocks were emplaced into the metavolcanic rocks as irregular 

stocks and dykes, which include the Allied, West Allied, Planet, and Meilleur syenite intrusions. 

Lamprophyre dykes cut all other units. Felsic intrusive rocks of the Round Lake Batholith bound the 

metavolcanic rocks to the west.  Occasional north- to northwest-trending diabase dykes of the 

Matachewan dyke swarm cut all older units. The most prominent structures are a series of northwest-

trending faults and include the Pacaud and Catharine faults. The Catharine Fault was interpreted to be 

a first-order structure by Arteaga (2018). There is also a series of lesser northeast-trending faults and 

shears. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz+/-carbonate veining best developed in, or 

adjacent to, the Allied, Planet and Meilleur syenites. 

Most of the Property is underlain by mafic to intermediate rocks with lesser ultramafic metavolcanic rocks. 

The mafic metavolcanic rocks are comprised of massive flows, pillowed flows, and lesser volcaniclastic 

rocks.  Metamorphic grade and deformation increase towards the Round Lake Batholith to the 

southwest and most of the massive flows on the Property contain medium- to coarse-grained amphibole. 

The presence of coarse-grained amphibole means that it can be difficult to distinguish between coarse-

grained flows and gabbro sills.  The intermediate metavolcanic rocks are subordinate units occurring as 

occasional flows and volcaniclastic rock interbedded with the mafic metavolcanic rocks. Ultramafic 

metavolcanic rocks rarely outcrop and are generally intensely altered but are thought to be spinifex 

textured flows. 

The northeast portion of the Property, north of the Catharine Fault, is underlain by predominantly 

intermediate to felsic metavolcanic rocks that are dominantly volcaniclastic with lesser flows. Occasional 

mafic volcaniclastic units are inter-bedded with the intermediate volcaniclastic rocks closer to the 

Catharine Fault. 

Intrusive rocks range from syn-volcanic to syn-tectonic in age with the syn-volcanic rocks being dominated 

by mafic to intermediate compositions and syn-tectonic rocks that are generally intermediate to felsic in 

composition. Syn-volcanic intrusions are generally medium- to coarse-grained gabbro to diorite that may 

form sills or composite sills tens of metres in thickness. Felsic to intermediate intrusive rocks of the Round 

Lake Batholith represent an early syn-tectonic igneous event. Late, syn-tectonic intrusions are dominantly 

medium- to coarse-grained, massive, syenite with lesser granodiorite and feldspar+/-quartz porphyritic 

dykes and sills.  These intrusions may form large irregular stocks of predominantly syenite composition that 

appear to be a composite of multiple intrusive phases of dyke and sill emplacement.  Lamprophyre dykes 

are rarely exposed but are intersected by drilling and are interpreted to be a late phase of the syn-

tectonic alkaline intrusive event as they cut all older units. 

Numerous faults transect the predominately pillow, tholeiitic, mafic metavolcanic, supracrustal rocks 

(Figure 7-2). The most important are the north-west striking Pacaud Fault and Catharine Fault which trend 

sub-parallel to the strike of the lithologies.  A series of less prominent northeast-trending fault and 

shears are oriented 050-070°, dipping 50-60°
 
southeast or northwest.  The largest intrusive body in the 

area is the tonalite dominated Round Lake Batholith located in the southwest part of Pacaud Township. In

7.3 Mineralization and Alteration 

There are 3 categories of veins identified on the Property, laminated fault-fill, extensional veins and vein 

arrays, and stockwork / fault breccia.  Laminated fault-fill veins are northwest-trending, steeply dipping, 

low angle to parallel to foliation and form in shear zones or faults.  

Extensional veins and vein arrays are northeast- to east-trending, shallow dipping, at high angles to the 

foliation, and form both within and outside of the shear zones. The extensional veins include the planar 

shallowly dipping veins formed at a moderate angle to shear zones in both intrusive stocks and volcanic 

country rocks, as well as arrays of planar to sigmoidal veins at high angle to the foliation that are 

generally found within the shear zones. Mineralized, northeast-trending, northwest-dipping extensional 

veins are present in all 3 intrusions. Mineralized quartz-carbonate extensional veining is observed in the 

western portion of the Property associated with faulting which has a 25° dip to the north.  The third set of 

veins is the brittle stockwork and fault breccia veins observed at both the Planet and Allied syenite 

intrusions. A high intensity of stockwork quartz veining is observed in the Planet Syenite associated with 

oblique to orthogonal vein sets. 

Gold mineralization on the Property is known to be situated within both shallowly dipping and sub-vertical 

quartz veins and syenite stocks hosted within the mafic volcanic rocks.  Gold mineralization in the area 

commonly has a nuggety character and coarse texture occurring in native form or as tellurides and may 

or may not be associated with disseminated pyrite.  Presently, the most economically interesting veins are 

in the northeastern Pacaud Township, within in the centre of the Property on cells 185339 and 311795.   

Historically the main target of exploration has been the shallowly north-dipping, white quartz No. 1 Vein 

that hosts free gold, tellurides, minor pyrite, chalcopyrite, tourmaline and galena. This vein is located 

approximately 400 m south of the Allied Syenite. Traced for about 600 feet along a west-trend, the vein 

averages about a foot in width (where identified on surface but may expand down dip) and has a shallow, 

20° or less, north dip. Mineralization is often concentrated along the country rock contacts and consists of 

native gold, frequently with telluride, in a net-like arrangement in the quartz along the contact.  Accessory 

mineral phases consist of chalcopyrite, pyrite, specular hematite and galena.  Telluride phases include 

multiple varieties of gold tellurides but mainly calaverite (AuTe2), a bismuth telluride, and petzite 

(Ag3AuTe2). The country rock is primarily mafic metavolcanic cut by north-trending feldspar porphyritic 

dykes.

Located about 300 m southwest of the Allied Syenite and 300 m northwest of the No. 1 Vein, the 

Independence, or "D", vein strikes 245° and dips 45° southeast with the best mineralization between 30 ft 

and 160 ft in depth along the inclined "D" shaft.  

Au-Bi-Te mineralization was identified in drill hole MG-14-12, sample 14624 at 54.6 m (Figure 7-3). This 

sample was logged as a quartz vein with visible gold, tellurides and chalcopyrite. The quartz vein intrudes 

the Allied Syenite. Assay results show that this sample has 12.2 g/t Au by metallic screen analysis, 1,260 

ppm Bi, 359 ppm Cu, 296 ppm Pb and 79.4 ppm Te. 

Alkaline intrusives named the Allied Syenite in Pacaud Township and Planet Syenite and Meilleur Syenite 

in Boston Township plus a number of northwest trending sinuous feldspar porphyry bodies are noted 

north of the No. 1 Vein and may have a genetic relationship to the gold mineralization (Figure 7-2). The 

syenite in places exhibits a more granitic appearance and composition but this is believed to be a function 

of introduced quartz in the form of veins and silicification in the matrix.  Research by Arteaga (2016, 2018) 

U/Pb on zircon dated the intrusions at 2662 +- 18 Ma and has identified that these "syenites" have undergone 

specialized alteration named episyenitization in the form of de-silicification and K depletion accompanied 

by Na metasomaltism resulting in the replacement in the intrusives of the potassium by albite feldspars. 

The Allied Syenite is part of an arc of alkaline magmatism that extends for 3,000 metres to the north and 

may be connected to the Planet Syenite. 

Arteaga (2018) dated the mineralization by analyzing molybdenite from drill holes from the Property using 

the Re-Os technique. The average age of molybdenite is 2680 ± 8 Ma.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The Property lies in the Kirkland Lake Mining District of northeast Ontario in which historically gold has 

been mined as typical mesothermal, replacement type, high-grade, quartz veins found along or close to a 

major east-west trending Archean deformation/structural feature named the Kirkland Lake Main Break 

within the Larder Lake - Cadillac Deformation Zone. Gold production since 1915 from 7 gold mines 

amounts to more than 24 million ounces of gold. (Clark 2013). 

More recently identified gold deposits in the camp such as the Upper Beaver deposit held by Agnico 

Eagle Mines Limited consists of disseminated to quartz filled fractures, stockworks, breccias, and pyritic 

zones associated with igneous intrusives commonly of syenite composition (Agnico Eagle Mines website: 

http://www.agnicoeagle.com/). At the Macassa Mine presently operated by Kirkland Lake Gold Inc., 

higher grade shoots containing tellurides and native gold constitute about 30% of the overall gold

mineralized structures cutting the syenites.  The following description of the Larder Lake Break gold 

mineralization is taken from Ispolatov et al. (2005). 

Gold mineralization at the Anoki and McBean properties is similar to the above- described 

gold deposits of McVittie and McGarry townships. In particular, the replacement-style, 

pyrite-rich Anoki Main zone shares strong analogies with the Kerr Addison-Chesterville flow 

ore, and replacement ores of Cheminis and Omega mines. Gold-bearing quartz stockworks 

in carbonate-fuchsite schists explored at depth at the McBean deposit and within the Anoki 

Deep zone are similar to the "green carbonate" ore at Kerr Addison-Chesterville. 

Mineralized aphyric dikes of the McBean ore zone strongly resemble the albitite ore of the 

Kerr Addison Mine described by Smith et al. (1993). Mineralization of the Anoki South zone 

that is hosted by a graphitic exhalite horizon may correlate to the graphite ore of the Kerr 

Addison-Chesterville Mine. Similarities in mineralization styles as well as analogous 

structural setting within the Larder Lake–Cadillac deformation zone suggest that gold-

bearing zones of the Anoki and McBean properties are likely related to mineralization of 

Kerr Addison-Chesterville, Cheminis, and Omega mines. All these occurrences of gold 

mineralization are parts of a single regional hydrothermal system. The most characteristic 

features of this system are summarized below: 

      1.  Gold mineralization is localized within a first-order structure, that is, the Larder Lake–

Cadillac deformation zone (Smith et al. 1993), and (as far as we are aware) there is no 

tendency for preferential occurrence of larger deposits in second- and third-order 

structures; 

2. Mineralization is commonly associated with gentle S-shaped bends along the Larder Lake 

Cadillac deformation zone (Anoki, McBean, Omega, and Cheminis); 

3. On the scale of the host deformation zone, mineralization tends to form linear shoots (strike 

length<dip length) that plunge roughly parallel to the regional stretching lineation (L2): e.g., 

40-50° east at McBean (this study); approximately 70º east Kerr Addison-Chesterville 

(Smith et al. 1993, p. 30); near vertical at Cheminis (longitudinal section in Clark and 

Bonnar 1987; structural data in Wilkinson 1993, p.142). 

4. At least some mineralized zones are centered on relatively competent lava flow units (e.g., 

Omega, Cheminis, possibly Kerr Addison) that are flanked by rheological weak and

probably impermeable ultramafic talc-chlorite schists (e.g., Thomson 1941; Smith et al. 

1993). 

5. There are 2 principal types of gold mineralization: a) the economically most important style 

is the pyritic replacement ore where gold is present largely as submicroscopic particles in 

pyrite (accounts for about 65% of gold at Kerr Addison- Chesterville, most gold at Cheminis 

and Omega, and Anoki Main zone), and b) the second in importance are quartz stockworks 

and veins in carbonate-fuchsite-altered ultramafic rocks, where coarser gold is present 

principally in quartz. The two mineralization types coexist within individual deposits and are 

probably related to the same hydrothermal episode (e.g., Smith et al. 1993). Localization 

and shape of individual replacement ore bodies is typically defined by primary or structurally 

modified geometry of geochemically and rheological favourable units (Smith et al. 1993; 

present study of the Anoki Main zone). Volcanic rocks of the Larder Lake Group constitute 

the most common protolith for replacement ores. Volcanic protoliths of the Anoki Main zone 

and Kerr Addison-Chesterville flow ore (Warwick 1981; Kishida and Kerrich 1987) are Fe-

tholeiites. Carbonate is the major component in both mineralization types, which indicates 

that ore was generated by carbonic, CO2 – rich fluids (e.g., Kishida and Kerrich 1987). 

Sulphidation of the Fe-rich, high Fe/Mg tholeiitic rocks must have constituted the main gold 

deposition mechanism for pyritic replacement mineralization (Böhlke 1988; Phillips et al. 

1984; Smith et al. 1993), whereas relatively coarse gold in quartz veins enclosed in 

carbonate-fuchsite alteration was most likely deposited through phase separations (e.g., 

Smith et al. 1993). The latter mechanism agrees well with the rather irregular distribution of 

gold in "green carbonate ore" (Smith et al. 1993) and occurrence of gold-barren quartz 

stockworks in carbonate-fuchsite schists. Both types of mineralization most probably belong 

to the syn-deformation greenstone-hosted quartz-carbonate vein (mesothermal-orogenic) 

deposit class. 

6. Syn-mineralization hydrothermal alteration likely increased competency of host rocks; 

ultramafic talc-chlorite schists were modified into carbonate-fuchsite rocks with abundant 

quartz veining, the largely chloritic flow unit of the Anoki zone was replaced by albite-rich 

aggregate. In both cases, hydrothermal products are more rigid than the protolith, and are 

likely to respond more brittle-like to continuing deformation and maintain or even enhance 

permeability. 

Occurrence of mesothermal gold mineralization in the first order deformation zone is 

unusual. Within the most economically significant gold camps, the largest gold deposits are

typically found in subsidiary second- and third-order structures (e.g., Eisenlohr et al. 1989; 

Robert 1990; McCuaig and Kerrich 1998). This atypical localization pattern may be due to 

the nature of the Larder Lake–Cadillac deformation zone in the Larder Lake area. 

Lithological assemblage of the Larder Lake–Cadillac deformation zone includes competent 

mafic volcanic units intermingled with or enveloped by incompetent and impermeable 

ultramafic talc- chlorite schists (Thomson 1941). This combination probably constituted 

favourable ground for maintaining isolated discrete permeable fluid conduits within the 

deformation zone. Competent tholeiitic volcanic units responded more brittle, thus 

enhancing their overall permeability. Rheological weak talc-chlorite schists enveloped these 

permeable zones, preventing fluid dispersal and maintaining high fluid/rock ratios within 

fluid pathways. Some of these competent units were also geochemically favourable for 

sulphidation (e.g., Fe-tholeiitic, high Fe/Mg rocks), and gold deposition occurred. 

The location of gold deposits in the Larder Lake–Cadillac deformation zone may (at least in 

part) reflect biases in exploration strategies, that is, the "Larder Lake Break" has for almost 

100 years attracted the most attention from geologists and prospectors alike, and 

potentially gold-bearing subsidiary structures may have been overlooked. There is no 

geological factor precluding the occurrence of gold mineralization along subsidiary faults or 

shear zones that were hydraulically connected to the Larder Lake–Cadillac deformation 

zone during a regional hydrothermal mineralizing event. The presence of Fe-tholeiites in the 

Kinojevis assemblage and Larder Lake Group (north and south of the Larder Lake– 

Cadillac deformation zone) supports the possibility for formation of replacement-style gold 

mineralization along subsidiary splays of the Larder Lake–Cadillac deformation zone." 

Ispolatov (2005) also mentioned: 

"Kirkland Lake gold mineralization has a distinct metal signature (Te>Au, Mo, Pb, Ag, high 

Au/Ag, low As) and is probably unrelated to mineralization along the Larder Lake–Cadillac 

deformation zone and its splays. The gold-bearing veins of the Kirkland Lake deposit could 

have formed during D4, synchronously with reverse-dextral movement along the Main 

Break, as hydrothermal fluids associated with deep alkaline magmatism migrated to 

shallow crustal levels." 

A more detailed and alternative discussion of the mineral deposit types in the Kirkland Lake Camp and on 

the Property can also be found in the Technical Report by Hart (2015).

9.1.1 2012 - 2016 Northstar Prospecting, Sampling and Locating Drill holes 

From the acquisition of the Property in 2012 through to 2014 and in 2016, a series of a prospecting and 

sampling programs were undertaken by Northstar in order to confirm and define the extent of gold 

mineralization in trenches, exposed adit openings and scattered outcrop exposures.  A total of 137 grab, 

composite grab, and single chip samples were obtained by George Pollock and geological technician 

Marc Cardinal, both of Northstar, during the summer of 2012, 327 grab, composite grab and single chip 

samples during the summer of 2013, 169 grab and chip samples during the summer of 2014 and 139 

grab samples in 2016.  Analytical results were highly variable and biased by the high grade grab samples 

as summarized in Table 9-1. Most of the samples were collected from cells 185339 and 311795 covering 

the area of the majority of historic workings in Northeast Pacaud Township on the Property.

It is noted these results are from prospecting surface samples collected over a non-systematic, highly 

variable spacing throughout the property and thus should not be treated in a "material" representative 

fashion with respect to the overall grade of the mineralized zone on the surface. They are presented and 

discussed here in a limited fashion for information only for that reason. 

In general, higher grade surface samples were reported to commonly contain significant visible gold and 

telluride mineralization associated with quartz veins cutting meta-volcanic and intrusive rocks. 

 

In the area where No. 1 Vein is projected to trend to the surface south of hole MG14-15 and in the vicinity 

of the Miller-Independence Mine historic workings, sampling of exposed quartz veins has returned high

grade Au assays.  The quartz veins were found to contain less sulphides and tellurides in comparison to 

those observed in the drill core but host multiple occurrences of visible coarse gold associated with black 

tourmaline.  The highest grade surface samples are clustered around the No. 1 Vein, D vein exposures 

and the contact zone around the Allied Syenite near the eastern syenite contact.  

 

The locations of historical diamond drill holes from previous work were found to be distributed throughout 

the Property on cells 185339, 311795 and 335177 and on the adjacent patented land Lot 12 Con 6 in 

Catharine Township south of 335177 and 203783. Those identified in the field were surveyed by 

handheld GPS while the remainder are estimated from historical property maps and reports of work, 

predominantly French (1988), and their locations have not been verified in the field.  The details of this 

program are described in Boyd and Selway 2015.  

9.1.2 Oban Mining 2015 Mapping and Sampling 

During May and June 2015, Northstar's joint venture partner at that time, Oban Mining Corp., performed 

geological mapping and sampling to identify controls on mineralization and map out the distribution of 

syenite intrusions on the Miller Gold Property.  All the Northstar and Oban surface sampling between 

2012 -2016 is plotted on Figure 9-1.

The focus of the field mapping was the Allied, Planet and Meilleur syenites which were mapped at 1:500. 

The areas between these intrusions were mapped at 1:1,000.  Based on the 2015 mapping and sampling 

and results of previous drill programs, drill targets were chosen for the 2015 drill program.  The reported 

descriptions and results below are taken from Hart (2015). 

Allied Syenite  

The Allied Syenite is an approximately 280 m by 80 m, northwest-trending, vertical intrusive body that is 

hosted in massive to pillowed mafic volcanic rocks. Within the Allied Syenite there are 2 sets of quartz 

veins, flat extensional cm-scale quartz veins and younger shear veins. These veins were rarely observed 

in outcrop and have been characterised by the 2015 drill program. The Allied Syenite is bounded by 

northwest-trending faults which were interpreted from drilling, geophysics, LIDAR, and mapping data. 

Mapping the Allied Syenite described in Hart (2015) was difficult due to limited outcrop exposure with the 

majority of the intrusion located in a topographic low filled with sand and swamps. Outcrops of syenite 

were visible at the outer contacts and the interpreted extent of the syenite was determined using 

outcrops, drill hole data and geophysics, as the Allied Syenite forms a magnetic low.  Exposure of 

mineralization in outcrop is rare, and less than 50 samples were collected from the Allied Syenite, with 

many of the samples being rubble from historical pits and trenches.  

Only 7 samples returned gold values >1.0 g/t Au, with the best being 11.85 g/t Au in sample 29661 taken 

in the northwest portion of the Allied Syenite and comprised of an equigranular syenite with chlorite and 

quartz veins. Two samples from the west side of the intrusion returned 2.30 g/t Au and 2.77 g/t Au 

respectively. These samples were mainly rubble material and returned values of up to 212.0 g/t Au and 

16.1 g/t Au. Along the eastern contact of the Syenite there are 3 historic pits and this area has been 

heavily sampled from 2012 to 2014; therefore, few samples were taken from this area during the 2015 

program. Most of the samples are associated with a breccia zone related to the northwest-trending fault 

and the best sample returned 212 g/t Au, which was hosted in a boulder of quartz with abundant visible 

gold and tellurides (Table 9-2). 

East and southeast of the Allied Syenite is a series of north- and east-trending trenches in sheared, 

variably silicified, and carbonate altered mafic volcanic which appear to be related to structures that host 

the No. 1 Vein.  The best sample from this area returned 52.5 g/t Au hosted in a shallow dipping, 10 cm 

wide quartz vein with disseminated pyrite in a carbonatized mafic metavolcanic. Other high gold values in 

this area were taken from rubble at the edge of the historic pits with the best sample returning 23.3 g/t Au.

West Allied Syenite 

Hart (2015) identified 2 felsic dykes during the 2015 mapping program in the area to the west-northwest 

of the Allied Syenite. One of the dykes of interest in this area is 250 m long by 15 m wide, is northwest-

trending, and is located approximately 185 m west-northwest of the Allied Syenite. The other dyke of 

interest is 130 m long by 5-20 m wide west-northwest-trending dyke located approximately 400 m west of 

the Allied Syenite. The dykes are composed of massive, medium- to coarse-grained equigranular syenite 

cut by infrequent aplite dykes, hosting occasional quartz veins. The veins may be bounded by a reddish 

potassic alteration and host up to 2% disseminated pyrite. Although there was no indication that these 

dykes formed part of the Allied Syenite, the area was referred to as the West Allied. There were no 

anomalous gold values returned for the field samples collected on these dykes. 

Planet Syenite 

The Planet Syenite is an irregularly shaped body with surface dimensions of approximately 150 m west 

by 200 m north, located about 925 m north of the Allied Syenite. This intrusion is predominately 

equigranular syenite (Sy1) with sporadic aplite dykes. The Planet Syenite contains visible quartz grains 

therefore it is more likely a quartz syenite (Hart, 2015). 

As described in Hart (2015), the historic trench in the Planet Syenite was hand stripped at the beginning 

of the program to better understand the geology and mineralization. The stripped area was mapped at 

1:100 and Oban also completed a channel sampling program to test the mineralization potential of the 

various vein sets observed during the mapping of the stripped area.  

The following observations were based on the 1:100 mapping of the Planet Syenite trench.  A high 

intensity of stockwork quartz veining is observed in the Planet Syenite stripped outcrop with 3 oblique to 

orthogonal vein sets, the widths of which range from less than 1 cm to over 15 cm. The primary vein set is 

composed of northwest-trending, steeply dipping veins. However, there are also north-northwest trending 

veins that are vertical to steeply dipping. This vein set is concentrated at the western portion of the Plant 

Syenite trench forming strong quartz stockwork. A set of west-southwest-trending veins dipping between 

25° and 40° to the northwest seem to be the youngest vein set, but there are conflicting crosscutting 

relationships as these veins are sometimes cut by northwest-trending veins (Hart, 2015). 

Most of the sampling on the Planet Syenite was with a part of the channel sampling program; 20 samples 

were collected from the remainder of the intrusion. A total of 84 channel samples were taken, with 2 

samples returning over 1 g/t Au (Table 9-3).  One sample returned 1.645 g/t Au from a 0.75 m long

channel comprised of massive syenite with 2-1 mm vertical quartz veins and 1 shallow 3 mm quartz vein 

hosting trace to 1% fine-grained pyrite. Another returned 1.19 g/t Au from a 0.65 m long channel 

consisting of massive syenite with trace to 1% disseminated pyrite and 2-1 cm shallow quartz veins. The 

common feature observed between the 2 samples was a pink alteration halo along the shallowly north-

dipping veins that contain up to 1% pyrite. There are similar shallowly north-dipping veins with alteration 

haloes in other samples that did not return anomalous gold values, however based on the more detailed 

work completed in the Allied Syenite it is interpreted that all of the shallowly dipping veins are of the same 

generation and the difference in assay results is due to a nugget effect as observed elsewhere on the 

Property. Three samples of the other 21 samples returned >1.0 g/t Au, with values between 1.045 and 

1.94 g/t Au; 1 of these samples is located 100 m south of the channel samples returned 1.83 g/t Au from 

rubble associated with a historical trench. 

Immediately north of the Planet Syenite, there is a narrow, linear, moderate to strong northeast-trending 

shear zone striking between 050° and 070° and dipping between 50° and 60° to the southeast. This zone 

is approximately 400 m long and locally up to 30 m wide and exhibits associated iron-carbonate alteration 

and disseminated pyrite. Approximately 58 samples were collected in the northern Planet area with 4 

samples collected from the shear returning >1.0 g/t Au and the best sample returning 4.29 g/t Au.  

A northwest-trending structure located west of the Planet Syenite has been tentatively correlated with the 

structure bounding the east side of the Allied Syenite. A total of 76 samples were collected in this area, 

with many of the samples taken from rubble associated with historical pits and trenches. This material 

consisted of variably carbonate-altered and sheared mafic metavolcanics with quartz veins and veinlets 

that contain disseminated pyrite and minor chalcopyrite. Twelve samples returned greater than 1.0 g/t Au, 

with the best sample returning 43.7 g/t Au.

Meilleur Syenite 

The Meilleur Syenite is an irregularly shaped, dyke-like body with surface dimensions of approximately 

110 m west by 650 m north, located about 1,500 m north of the Allied and 800 m northeast of the Planet 

Syenite. Located north of the Catharine Fault, the Meilleur I is hosted by intermediate metavolcanic rocks 

of the Skead Group in contrast to the mafic metavolcanic rocks of the Catharine Group which host the 

other 2 intrusions. The intrusion is composed of a massive, red to pink equigranular syenite cut by white 

quartz veins up to 10 cm wide, with a variety of orientations. The Meilleur Syenite is bounded by 2 north-

northwest-trending shear zones interpreted based on LIDAR and geophysics. There are 2 vein sets in the 

intrusion, a northeast-trending shallowly dipping set and a northeast-trending vertical set. The primary

vein set is the northeast-trending, 25° northwest dipping set. Both vein sets host 0.5% to 1% molybdenite, 

pyrite and occasional tourmaline (Hart, 2015). 

As was reported in Hart (2015), mapping in the area of the Meilleur Syenite suggests that the intrusion is 

approximately 60 m wider than outlined by previous mapping. This interpretation is supported by 3 holes 

completed in 1996 which intersected syenite in an area of limited outcrop. Mapping indicated that the 

intrusion extended further north than previously shown by about 85 m but overall the current interpretation 

is a similar dyke-like body.  

A total of 28 samples were collected in and around the Meilleur Syenite, and most of the samples 

returned less than 1 g/t Au. Three of the 4 samples that returned >1.0 g/t Au were located in the northern 

portion of the intrusion (Table 9-4). Another sample returned 1.135 g/t Au and is in a 140 m by 30 m 

northeast-trending syenite dyke parallel to the Meilleur Syenite which had not been previously mapped.

Other Areas 

Oban collected approximately 100 samples in the area peripheral to the syenite intrusions and identified 2 

areas hosting gold mineralization that appear to be unrelated to the intrusions or the historical Miller 

Independence Mine. The first area is located approximately 1.2 km east of the Allied Syenite, and the 

second is located about 420 m west of the Allied area and south of the West Allied area. The eastern 

area is hosted by variable altered mafic metavolcanic rock cut by quartz veins and hosting minor 

disseminated pyrite. Of the 10 samples in this area, 2 samples from separate locations returned 2.210 g/t 

and 1.445 g/t Au. The western area is also hosted in altered mafic metavolcanics with up to 12 cm quartz 

veins, containing up to 3% disseminated pyrite.  A total of 8 samples were collected in this area and 4 

samples returned >0.9 g/t Au with the best sample returning 3.27 g/t Au.

9.2.1  2013 Ground Magnetic Survey 

During 2013, an approximately 11 km ground magnetic survey was completed on a 50 metres spaced 

north-south cut grid covering the central portion of the Miller Gold Property in northeastern Pacaud 

Township and northwestern Catharine Township. The dominant feature identified from the magnetic 

survey is the main northwest trending lineament defining the Catharine Fault trending through 

northwestern Catharine Township as well as the general northwestern trend of the geological terrain.  The 

Allied Syenite appears as a magnetic low. 

9.2.2 2014 Ground Resistivity and IP Survey 

During the winter of 2014, Abitibi Geophysics completed an 11.3 km ground time domain 3D IP (IPower 

3D on five simultaneous lines) chargeability and resistivity survey on the same grid. The data values were 

inverted using computer software calculating 3 dimensional patterns of resistivity and chargeability of the 

subsurface that best explain the values recorded at surface. The depth and quality of the survey results 

are variable and limited by the character of the bedrock, however, plans at 50, 75, and 100 metres depths 

were provided by the geophysical contractor as shown in Figure 9-2. Abitibi Geophysics identified 9 

geophysical anomalies that were interpreted to be sub horizontal.

The survey interpretation presented in the Abitibi Geophysics report (Loader 2014) outlined a resistive 

layer, dipping slightly to the north, immediately overlying a highly conductive layer which correlated well 

with the mineralized, shallowly north dipping quartz No. 1 Vein located south of the Allied Syenite. The 

vein is underlain by a zone of clays, fault gouge and broken rock which is likely responsible for the 

conductive zone that underlies the resistive zone. The Catharine fault zone is clearly visible in the IP 

inversion results. The resistivity inversion sections in the eastern portion of the grid indicate a conductive 

zone dipping at about -45 degrees to the south. The porphyry dykes of the Allied Syenite do not show a 

strong IP response.  The Abitibi Geophysics report recommended diamond drilling for the distinctive

chargeability anomalies, 7 of which are associated with the No. 1 Vein Zone.  The drill targets chosen in 

the 2014 program were consistent with these recommendations.  

9.2.3 2015 Airborne Magnetic-VLF Survey 

As discussed in Hart (2015), K8aranda Geophysics Ltd. was commissioned by Oban to fly a helicopter-

borne gradient magnetic and very flow frequency (VLF) EM survey over the entire Miller Gold Property 

during March-April 2015 (Figure 9-3).  A total of 960.8 line km was flown with a flight line spacing of 50 m.  

The magnetic survey highlighted the regional northwest-trending mafic to intermediate metavolcanic 

rocks and gabbro sill located to the southwest of the Catharine fault zone, in the area of the Allied and 

Planet syenites. The intermediate metavolcanic rocks to the northeast of the Fault have a lower magnetic 

response, including the area around the Meilleur Syenite. The Allied and Planet syenites have low 

magnetic responses compared to the surrounding mafic to intermediate metavolcanics while the Meilleur 

is a relatively high compared to the surrounding intermediate metavolcanics. The Allied and Planet 

syenites are identified magnetic low features on the calculated first vertical derivative of the total magnetic 

field. The VLF results over the intrusions did not result in a distinctive response. 

9.2.1 LIDAR Survey 

In May 2015, Oban contracted KBM Resources Group to conduct a LIDAR and ortho-image survey over 

the entire Miller Gold Property as reported in Hart (2015). The LIDAR survey was useful in the 

identification of geological features, including lineaments and faults, and for historical workings, including 

pits, trenches, and trails. Identification of these features aided in the planning of the 2015 field work and 

was also helpful in the field as a reference while mapping. This data was also useful during the 

interpretation of the geology for the Property. 

 

9.3 Bulk Sampling 

9.3.1 2013 Mini-Bulk Sample 

During late 2013, to confirm historic and initial high grade prospecting results from the area, Northstar 

Gold collected an approximately 15 tonne hand-cobbed mini-bulk sample from 2 main exposures where 

No.1 Vein comes to the surface in the areas of Trench 1 and 3 discussed in Section 9.4.  The mini-bulk 

sample material was described as containing >90% quartz suggesting minimal basalt wall rock dilution.  

The material was stored at the Northstar secured warehouse facility to be processed at a local mill

taken to mining lease.   

During April 2016, 59 samples were collected from 27 approximately half tonne bags from this mini-bulk 

sample and sent to Actlabs Sudbury in order to obtain an estimate of their grade for analysis.  The results 

of these analyses averaged 26.8 g/t Au, however, check samples completed and submitted for analyses 

at a different laboratory during the Author's site visit in November 2016 indicated that the true average 

grade was around half this value.  These results and their verification process are discussed in detail in

9.3.2 2016 Bulk Sample 

The objectives for the 2016 bulk sampling program completed by Northstar Gold were two-fold; first to 

obtain a sizable bulk sample to assess the gold grade, dilution and mineability of the stripped surface 

exposures; and second to explore the cleaned blasted areas by conducting channel sampling so as to 

assess the continuity of the gold mineralization along strike and down-dip to aid in planning follow-up 

larger tonnage bulk sampling and drill testing exploration.   In general, collected bulk sample mineralized 

material was taken from surface exposures (or very near surface extensions) of the high gold grade 

quartz No. 1 Vein including approximately 0.5 m widths of bounding altered basalt wall rock carrying 

lower values, as described in earlier check sampling discussed in the 2015 43-101 Technical Report on 

the property (Boyd and Selway 2015).   The 2016 bulk sampling program and results are detailed in a 

Technical Report prepared by Boyd (2017). 

The bulk sampling, totaling approximately 932 tonnes, was completed from October 28 to November 13, 

2016. The program entailed the stripping of areas of 4 trenches, the subsequent blasting and excavating 

of Trenches 1 to 3, and the mining of the bulk sample in which approximately 850 tonnes was mined from 

Trench 1 and the remainder from Trench 3.  Between November 14 and 18th, the bulk sample was 

trucked to the Richmont Mines Inc. Camflo Mill located in Malartic, Quebec, situated about 20 km west of 

Val d'Or.  The Camflo Mill has a capacity of 1,200 short tons per day and uses a Merrill-Crowe 

conventional type process with gold cyanidation and precipitation using zinc powder.  It operates circuits 

for jaw crushing and ball mill grinding passing material 75% at 200 mesh (75 μm).  Currently, Mill 

Superintendent is Billy Lamothe on behalf of Richmont Mines; the mill processes ore from Richmont's 

Beaufor Mine but also custom mills on a contract basis.  The Camflo Mill documents were provided from 

Richmont Mines to Northstar which included a tabulated sample list, daily reports, inventory documents, 

assay results and certificates.  Richmont sold the Beaufor Mine and Camflo Mill to Monarques Gold in 

2017. 

During the bulk sampling program 241 trench evaluation and bulk in-situ field samples were gathered 

which included mineralized material from cut channels in bedrock and blasted rock pieces predominantly 

from the four trenches. The program was generally successful in its objectives, more specifically in 

demonstrating, for the main No. 1 Vein  and other veins on the Property, the presence of high-grade, 

continuous, mineralized gold zones over albeit narrow widths. It was found that 80 of the collected field 

samples reported greater than 5 g/t Au.  The program allowed Northstar to project the probable trend and 

down-dip attitude of these zones for follow-up exploration and bulk sampling.

The bulk sample was processed at the Camflo Mill operated by Richmond Mines Inc. near Malartic, 

Quebec. Based upon Northstar sampling of the Camflo mill feed of the delivered bulk sample, the 

weighted average head grade of 5.06 g/t for the delivered bulk sample is significantly lower than the 

estimated weighted average grades of 10.9 and 3.1 g/t Au obtained from Trenches 1 and 3, respectively, 

from the analysis of 90 in-situ broken rock samples gathered over the bulk sampling areas. This indicates 

that the delivered bulk sample included significant wall rock dilution, however, the in-situ field analytical 

results are largely consistent with the results of previous exploration and sampling over 2 trenched areas 

during 2013 - 2015.   

The work completed on the Miller Gold Property by Northstar Gold during 2016 follows up on extensive 

prospecting and surface sampling, ground geophysical surveys, and diamond drilling undertaken since its 

staking by the company in 2012.  This work is described in detail in 2 reports Boyd and Selway (2015) 

and Hart (2015).   

This trenching and bulk sampling work program entailed the stripping of overburden at the 4 areas on 

claim 4267277 where gold mineralized quartz veins were exposed by an excavator followed by a series of 

surface blasts using drilled 4 to 10 foot vertical holes to create deeper trenches at 3 of the 4 areas.  The 

blasted rock was visually assessed as either mineralized bulk sample material or waste at the trench sites 

with the former loaded onto a 15 tonne articulated dump truck to be carried and stockpiled by the 

entrance road to the property.  The stockpiled mineralized material was then loaded onto 35 tonne 

highway trucks to be shipped for custom processing at the Camflo gold mill in Malartic, Quebec, operated 

by Richmont Mines Inc.  The waste rock was piled by the side of trench sites to be used as fill as part of 

their remediation upon completion of the work.   

In order to monitor the trenching and bulk sampling process and results, a total of 241 surface monitoring 

field samples were gathered from the 4 trenches, including 72 cut channel samples, 113 blasted rock 

samples obtained from the trenches, and 19 metallurgical test samples.  116 of these samples covered 

areas of blasted rock and channel cut areas over the areas of the bulk samples taken from Trenches 1 

and 3; and 99 were evaluation (mostly cut channel) type samples from Trenches 1, 2, 3, and 4 with the 

decision to recommend additional follow-up bulk sampling and continued exploration dependent upon 

their analytical results.  

During this program, approximately 202 kg and 122 kg of gold mineralized predominately quartz samples 

were obtained for metallurgical testing from each of Trenches 3 and 4 with weighted average grades of 

3.7 and 36.1 g/t Au, respectively.  No work yet has commenced for these samples.

Trench 1 

Trench 1 is located near the southeast corner of cell 311795 (legacy claim 4267277) and covers an area 

where the main No. 1 Vein was historically identified and re-discovered by Northstar to reach the surface, 

striking east-west in a shallow northerly dip over an exposed area of approximately 25 square metres.  In 

2014, a series of chip samples and a 13 tonne mini-bulk sample had been collected by Northstar on the 

surface over this area (also named Trench 1 at the time) based upon the discovery of numerous 

occurrences of free gold, and gold and bismuth telluride minerals from prospecting the previous year 

(Boyd and Selway, 2015; Steyn, 2013).  Samples gathered from the mini-bulk sample were analyzed in 

April 2016 and in the fall of 2016; the QA/QC results are discussed in Section 12.  Repeated high-grade 

gold values in outcrop were identified over the area justifying this extensive stripping, blasting and the 

scaled up follow-up bulk sampling program along this extended strike length where the vein was identified 

to reach the surface.  

For this program, an enlarged east southeast to west northwest trending area named Trench 1 was 

stripped and partially blasted exposing the vein over a strike length of approximately 60 metres and 

length down-dip of 5 to 12 metres.  The No. 1 Vein at this exposure is a quartz-dominant, roughly tabular 

body striking west northwest and dipping approximately 10° to the north northeast. The cross-cut mafic 

volcanic host rocks are northwest striking, chloritized, pillow basalts steeply dipping to the northeast.  

Foliations in the basalt range from 280-300° with some small joints or shears trending 320-330°. Upon 

closer examination, the vein has an undulating to ragged appearance, pinching and swelling, in thickness 

from 15 to 35 cm, and appears to be dipping towards a more north northwest fashion at the north 

northwest extension of the exposure.  In places, there are 10-50 cm sized satellite quartz clots and 

narrow stringers projecting at high angles from the main vein.  The quartz contains <2% sulfides made up 

of scattered pyrite and rare chalcopyrite in association with the persistent identification of multiple 

occurrences of free gold and gold-bismuth telluride minerals.  The host basalt wall rock possesses a local 

and variable up to 1 metre wide alteration halo from the contact with the quartz in the form of moderate to 

pervasively intense silicification, quartz stringers, lesser sericitization, and 2-10% disseminated pyrite. 

The altered basalt reports low gold values which appear to roughly correlate in grade both with the 

degree of its pyritization, quartz stringers, and proximity to the vein contact.  Gold analyses of samples 

from the Trench 1 area are reported from previous reports such as in Boyd (2014) and Boyd and Selway 

(2015) prior to its enlargement.  

Approximately 850 tonnes of the total bulk sample material was excavated from Trench 1 and obtained 

from about a 45  10 metre blasted portion of the stripped outcrop where the vein dips from the surface to 

about 2.5 metres vertical depth. The sampling focused on gathering high-grade gold mineralization from

the quartz vein material with minimal dilution from the adjacent rock such that a layer of the overlying 

basalt cap was removed as waste to be returned to the trench as fill during remediation. The ratio of 

quartz to basalt material is estimated to be variable depending upon where in the trench it was removed, 

ranging from 20 to 50% so the ultimate grade of the bulk sample was found to be dependent upon the 

grade of the quartz vein material, grade of the adjacent basalt wall rock, and the proportion of each rock 

type.   

In order to assess an estimated grade of the Trench 1 bulk sample material, 72 approximately 10 

kilogram samples of the in-situ broken blast material were gathered over 8 traverses across the pile which 

were located by NAD 83 UTM coordinates as listed with the analytical results in Table 9-6. Sampling of 

partially diluted blasted and broken No. 1 Vein Zone material from 7 parallel 5 metre spaced traverses 

across Trench 1 plus 1 traverse along the length of Trench 1 produced a weighted average grade of 14.7 

g/t Au.  When excluding the highest grade sample of 284 g/t Au in sample 15294 from the calculations, 

the weighted average grade is reduced to 10.9 g/t Au.  In addition, where access was possible, 9 sets of 

1 metre cut channel samples totaling 29 samples were cut across the exposed vein and basalt wall rock 

listed in Table 9-5 and Figure 9-5.  Seven of the channel cuts at 2 bench depths from the Trench 1 on the 

No 1 Vein Zone averaging 20.1 g/t Au over 2.14 m (estimated average true width of 0.37 m including the 

high grade quartz vein and immediate mineralized wall rock).

Trench 2 

In this program, Trench 2 is located on cell 311795 (legacy claim 4267277), 60 metres north of Trench 1 

in the vicinity of where the No. 1 Vein is intersected by diamond drill hole MG-14-14 drilled in 2014 (Boyd, 

2014) at a depth of 2 metres.  The drill site is covered mostly by piled broken waste rock from historic 

work completed during the 1920s.  A 20  15 metre area was stripped of overburden in an attempt to 

reach bedrock, which was only partially achieved.  The main No. 1 Vein quartz rock was not definitively 

identified among the uncovered outcrop, however, a 2-3 cm thick flat pyrite-telluride bearing quartz vein 

hosted in rusty silicified, pyritized, sub-vertical basalt was identified associated with localized sub-vertical 

shears and multiple quartz stringers trending 320 – 330°.  A set of 6-1 metre channel samples returned 

values of 5.9 g/t Au over 5.0m in a channel cut, including 17.4 g/t Au over 1m from this exposure as listed 

in Table 9-7 and Figure 9-6.   

Subsequent blasting of this and adjacent outcrops was unsuccessful in defining No. 1 Vein at this locality 

because of flooding of the created pits by an adjacent beaver pond, however, excavation of the broken 

rock into piles revealed the accumulation of voluminous amounts of similarly altered, pyritized rock

kilogram broken rock samples in 3 traverses, similar to that in Trench 1, as listed in Table 9-8 and shown 

in Figure 9-6, were gathered for gold analysis returning values as high as 14.6 g/t Au, but none of this

paucity of visual information to make an estimate of its gold grade.

Trench 3 

Trench 3, located on cell 311795 (legacy claim 4267277), covers an area 100 metres west of Trench 1 

where there is a flooded historic ramp which was historically used to explore and test mine No. 1 Vein.  In 

2014, a series of chip samples had been gathered by Northstar on the surface over an area (named 

Trench 2 at the time) to the west of the ramp entrance where No.1 Vein  appears to reach the surface 

(Boyd and Selway 2015).  In April 2016, check samples were gathered from the bags of the 2013 mini-

bulk sample, which partially originated from the Trench 3 area for which the QC results are discussed in

Section 12.  In general, moderately high gold values were found over the area from previous work 

justifying the stripping, blasting and additional bulk sampling program.  

For this program, a small 10  10 metre area, 20 metres west of the ramp was stripped and blasted to 

facilitate the removal of the basalt cap to better access the quartz vein material.  No. 1 Vein at this 

exposure appears to be thinner (10-20 cm wide) and possesses a lower grade in comparison to that in 

Trench 1 based upon the previous sampling by Northstar.  The surface exposure of the Vein here allows 

one to appreciate its undulating to sinuous nature and associated measured shearing trending 220 - 230° 

on outcrop.  The Vein's overall east-west strike remains like that found at Trench 1 although it appears to 

steepen in its northerly dip to approximately 20°.  Gold analyses of samples from the area are reported 

from previous reports as Trench 2 such as in Boyd (2014) and Boyd and Selway (2015) prior to its 

enlargement when it was named Trench 3 in this Technical Report.  

Approximately 82 tonnes of the total bulk sample were taken from Trench 3.  Some of this sample was 

supplemented by the gathering of historic piled quartz boulders adjacent to the trench.  The sampling 

again focused on gathering high-grade gold mineralization from the quartz vein material with minimal 

dilution from the basalt.  The percentage of quartz (to basalt) in the sample here is higher than at Trench 

1 ranging from 50 to 70%.  In order to assess an estimated grade of the Trench 3 bulk sample, 7- 10 

kilogram samples of the in-situ broken blast material were gathered in 1 traverse across the pile as shown 

in  

Table 9-10 which were located by NAD 83 UTM coordinates.  In addition, where access was possible, 3 

sets of 1 metre channel samples totaling 23 samples were cut across the exposed vein and basalt wall 

rock listed in Table 9-9 and shown Figure 9-7.  One of these sample sets was across the quartz vein 

exposure which was subsequently blasted to create the trench.  For each sample an estimate was made 

of its basalt and quartz composition.  Best results of 3 channel cuts were 5.02 g/t Au over 2.0m, including 

7.96 g/t Au over 1m.  An additional 200 kg sample of the quartz vein material was obtained from the site 

to be used for metallurgical testing.  Sampling of 287 kg of blasted and broken material overall reported a 

weighted average grade of 3.1 g/t Au. 

The results in these tables can be compared to both the original gold values in Boyd and Selway (2015), 

the mini-bulk sampling results, and the reconciled grade of mill head feed samples for the bulk sample 

reported from the Camflo Mill.

Trench 4 

Trench 4 is located towards the northwest part of cell 311795 (legacy claim 4267277) and covers an area 

300 metres northwest of Trench 1 where there is a known historic gold showing named the D-Vein 

associated with a buried shallow shaft and trench.  Previous grab samples obtained in 2013 and 2014 

returned multiple high-grade gold values justifying a stripping and more systematic sampling program at 

the showing (Boyd 2014).  For this program, a 5 by 20 metre area covered mostly by thick bush was 

stripped to expose the northeast trending structure.   

The D-Vein at this exposure appears to be highly variable in width from 5 to 30 cm with a strike and dip 

ranging 245 - 255° azimuth dipping 40 - 45°SE, which can be followed for 10 metres after which it may 

change strike or shrink into a 2 cm thick stringer within a steeply dipping shear zone trending 265°.  It is

uncertain whether this observed change is a geological feature, perhaps trending obliquely to the 

shearing in an easterly fashion under overburden, or whether parts of the structure were mined out.  The 

D-Vein is comprised of iron oxide stained quartz with 3-5% disseminated pyrite, trace chalcopyrite and 

multiple occurrences of visible gold, and exhibits a 0.3 to 1 metre alteration halo into the basaltic wall rock 

in the form hematization, silicification, 2-5% pyritization, and intermittent quartz stringers.   

In this program, no blasting or bulk sampling was completed but in order to assess an estimated grade of 

the vein and basaltic wall rock at this site, 14 1 metre cut channel samples were taken across its strike as 

shown in Table 9-11 and Figure 9-8. The best results of the 4 channel cuts were 27.8 g/t Au over 1 metre 

and 34.8 g/t Au over 1 metre with an approximate 0.5m true width of the D-Vein system.  An additional 

122 kg sample of the vein material was obtained at the site for metallurgical testing and reported a 

weighted average grade of 36.1 g/t Au.

10.0   DRILLING 

10.1 Northstar Gold 2014 Drilling 

Northstar conducted its 2014 diamond drilling program in order to: 

• Validate the results of the historical drilling focusing on following up predominately on the results 

of the 1986-87 Nortek work program on the Property and; 

• Test drill targets within chargeability and resistivity anomalies generated from the ground 

IP/resistivity survey conducted by the company early in 2014 in advance of the drilling program. 

The 2014 diamond drill holes are located on cells 311795, 185339, 335177 and 173038 (legacy claims 

4267277, 4267276, and 4215970) listed in Table 10-1. The drilling program consisted of 15 (MG14-01 to 

15) NQ holes totaling 1,778.5 m.  All the holes were drilled vertically with the exception of holes MG14-04, 

06 and 12.  

Forage Asinii of Notre-Dame du Nord was the diamond drilling contractor and the program was 

supervised in the field by George Pollock while geologists Trevor Boyd and Elisabeth Ronacher logged 

the core and monitored QA/QC for the program. A Reflex down-hole survey was performed at 

approximately 50 m intervals. The drill casing was kept in the holes. GPS coordinates of all collar 

locations were recorded and at the end of the drill program all the holes were surveyed using Trimble 

DGPS. The overburden depths were between 2 - 5 m.  The samples were gathered as NQ core with 

recoveries of over 95 per cent.   The core was photographed and logged for RQD, lithology, 

mineralization and alteration prior to sampling and stored at Northstar's secure warehouse at Earlton, 

Ontario.

During the drill program, a total of 1,111 core samples were obtained from the drilling most of which were 

1 metre in length but ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 metres. All the samples were analyzed for gold and 51 

were also analyzed for multi-elements. The analyzed samples covered approximately 61% of the core 

obtained from drilling. All the assays highlights are listed in Table 10-2. Mineralized intervals reported are 

core lengths and their true widths at this stage are unknown.  There are no drilling, sampling or recovery 

issues known by the author that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the results.  

10.1.1  Discussion of 2014 Results 

The program was successful in confirming the trend of the shallowly dipping No. 1 Vein Zone in holes 

MG14-02, 3, 7, 9, 12 and 13. In addition, a bulk tonnage, near surface gold target was discovered within 

the Allied Syenite with 6 drill holes (MG14-03, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12) intersecting gold zone(s) between 20m 

and 120m vertical depth within the intrusive body. Drill hole spacing in the vicinity of the Allied Syenite 

was between 30 and 50m for the 6 holes.  Best results of the drilling came from holes MG14-02, 07, 09 

and 12.  Specific drilling highlights are detailed in Table 10-2.

In summary, gold mineralization in the No. 1 Vein Zone is characterized by widely distributed coarse 

native gold and gold tellurides hosted by quartz veins, disseminated pyrite, intense chlorite alteration and 

rare chalcopyrite stringers. Fine gold is associated with heavy disseminated pyrite mineralization. 

Diamond drilling confirmed the presence of No. 1 Vein hosting gold mineralization in the area of the 

Miller–Independence historic mine workings at shallow depths. The program also showed No. 1 Vein dips 

shallowly to the north towards the Allied Syenite where the vein system may widen and become 

incorporated into the Allied Syenite as multiple sub-horizontal narrow veins in a fingering manner 

suggestive of a genetic relationship in the gold mineralization. 

Gold is very widely distributed throughout Allied Syenite from 20 to 120 metres vertical depth with the 

majority of samples showing anomalous results. Gold mineralization in the intrusive is commonly 

associated with intense silicification, hematization, pyritization, black chlorite, and quartz and jasper 

veining of the syenite but is also found in spatially associated mafic volcanic and feldspar porphyry rocks, 

and within parts of the syenite exhibiting apparent lesser alteration such as within hole MG14-09. Within 

these less altered host rocks the gold mineralization, however, still appears to be associated with 

distinctive speckled grains of black chlorite of likely iron rich composition and secondary origin.  

At this early stage of exploration, the orientation of the mineralized zone is not well defined and sample 

lengths do not reflect the true lengths or widths of the mineralized zone although based upon drill core 

logging in vertical holes many veins intersected in the Allied Syenite were observed to be at a normal 

angle to the core axis. 

10.2 2015 Oban Mining Drilling 

In July and August 2015, Oban Mining Corp. contracted Forthright Drilling, based out of Timiskaming 

Shores, ON to complete 12 NQ diamond drill holes on the Allied, West Allied, Meilleur and Planet

syenites totaling 4,067 m (Table 10-3, Figure 10-1). The rig and equipment sloop were moved between 

drill sites by a skidder. The drill sites are accessible by truck along a network of bush roads. 

The diamond drill program was designed to test the extent of the Allied Syenite due to limited exposure. 

The drill holes in the Allied Syenite were spaced on 100 m sections and were drilled with an azimuth of 

either 065° or 245° to intersect the structures interpreted to control the auriferous veins at an optimal 

angle.  This drilling pattern produced four sections through the Allied Syenite. 

For the West Allied, Planet and Meilleur syenites, the drill program was planned to test the character and 

distribution of the gold mineralization at depth and to determine the size of these intrusions. The West 

Allied Syenite has no recorded historical drilling while the Meilleur and Planet syenites have been 

sparsely drill-tested with 3 holes and 6 holes respectively. The drill holes were planned to intersect the 

mineralized quartz veins and structures at an optimal angle based on the results of the 2015 field 

mapping program. 

The azimuth and inclination of all drill holes were measured using a Reflex multi-shot downhole survey 

instrument. Measurements were made 15 m below casing, at 50 m downhole, and at subsequent 50 m 

intervals. The Reflex survey data is summarized in the header section on each of the drill hole logs. The 

location of each drill hole was recorded by an averaged GPS reading. Based on this control, accuracy of 

hole positioning is estimated to be less than 5 m.  

The drill core was logged and photographed, 4 boxes at a time. The logs recorded the different 

lithologies, alteration types, mineralization, position and orientations of veins, fractures, RQD and other 

structures. The rock quality designation (RQD), and level of core recovery for the 2015 drill holes was 

recorded prior to the lithologic logging. Core recovery was generally > 95% with the exception of a few 

highly fractured zones.  The photos of the un-split core agree well with the stated core recovery of > 95%.

Of the 4,066 m drilled, 183.7 m of core was not sampled. The unsampled intervals were in MG15-21 and 

MG15-24. MG15-21 failed to intersect the Allied Syenite therefore the majority of the hole was hosted in 

slightly altered to unaltered mafic volcanic. Unaltered mafic volcanic rocks with no mineralization or 

veining were not sampled. MG15-24 was planned to be drilled to a depth of 370 m to intersect a 

mineralized quartz vein observed on surface. This vein was not intersected in the drill hole, and over the 

140 m of mafic volcanic rocks intersected in the hole only intervals with alteration, mineralization or quartz 

veining, were sampled. 

10.2.1 Discussion of Oban 2015 Results 

Of the 12 holes drilled, all holes except for MG15-22 and MG15-23 returned assays above 1 g/t.  Table 

10-4 lists highlights of the drilling program. The drill program was successful in demonstrating the 

presence of gold mineralization in the Allied, Planet, and Meilleur syenites and indicates that there is little 

chance of gold mineralization being found within the West Allied Syenite.

The 5 holes in the Allied Syenite intersected a series of quartz veins. Gold mineralization is sporadic, with 

the majority of the high grade intervals hosted in the shallowly dipping first generation quartz veins with 

associated tellurides and rare visible gold.  Within the 5 holes that intersected the main body of the 

intrusion there were 23 intervals that returned >1.0 g/t Au. The best interval was intersected in MG15-20 

which returned 40.5 g/t Au over 1.0 m from 311.85 to 312.85 m, included in a graded interval of 14.1 g/t 

Au over 3.05 m from 311.85 to 314.9 m (see Table 10-4 and Figure 10-3).  Drilling from the southwest 

side of the intrusion towards MG15-20, M15-18 intersected 4.2 g/t Au over 3.0 m from 374.75 to 376.25m 

including 5.96 g/t Au over 0.75 m and 6.27 g/t Au over 0.75 m.  

Two holes were drilled into the Planet Syenite with MG15-24 collared near the northeast contact and 

MG15-25 collared approximately 110 m east of MG15-24 and was drilled to be parallel to MG15-24. 

MG15-24 intersected a series of 5 syenite dykes between 45.45 and 229.47 m which range from 2.5 to 

57.2 m in width which are separated by fine-grained mafic metavolcanic rocks. The syenite and 

metavolcanic rocks host numerous centimetre-scale quartz veins containing pyrite with lesser 

chalcopyrite, molybdenite, tellurides and rare visible gold.   

Two holes were collared to intersect the north end of the Meilleur Syenite (MG15-26 and MG15-27). Hole 

MG15-26 intersected a red, medium-grained syenite between 89.64 m and 316.06 m with a satellite dyke 

between 332.06 m and 335.73 m. The syenite hosts centimetre- to a few tens of centimetre-scale quartz 

veins containing pyrite, 0.5% to 1% molybdenite and rare tellurides. The best assay returned 20.8 g/t Au 

from 86.55 m to 87.5 m in a faulted, bleached mafic metavolcanic unit.  

The sample lengths do not represent the true thickness of the mineralization. The orientation of the 

mineralization is unknown at this stage. The Qualified Person is not aware of any drilling, sampling, or 

recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the results.

11.1 2014 Northstar Gold Drill and Field program 

The drill core was placed in wooden core trays at the drill site, labelled with the hole ID and box number 

and transported to the core logging facility in Earlton, Ontario. At the core logging facility, the core boxes 

were labelled with aluminum tag indicating the hole number and the core interval stored in each box. The 

core is stored in core racks inside the core logging facility or staked in its yard.  The core storage facility is 

locked, and the property is fenced with a locked gate.

During this program, Northstar Gold implemented an industry standard QA/QC program that included 

insertion of blanks, blind commercial standards and duplicate quarter core samples in order to ensure 

best practice in sampling and analysis. During the logging the NQ drill core was laid out on racks at 

Northstar's Earlton warehouse facility with a Northstar technician measuring recoveries and RQD and 

taking photographs while the geologist described the core. The geologist then assessed the intervals of 

mineralization for sampling and placed sample tags accordingly. The core was then ready for cutting.  

The selected drill core samples ranged from 0.25 to 2.0 metres in length, but mostly were 1 metre. The 

samples were prepared from core cut in half using a diamond saw, sealed in secure packages with a 

sample tag, and shipped by either company personnel or bonded carrier to either the Swastika 

Laboratories facility in Kirkland Lake, Ontario or the Activation Laboratories accredited facility (ISO/IEC 

17025:2005) in Ancaster, Ontario for preparation and analysis. Swastika Laboratories was not accredited 

at the time of the analyses. One tag was left remaining in the core box stapled at the beginning of each 

sample interval for future reference. 

Field outcrop grab samples collected in 2014 for analyses have a sample description and the site 

location, obtained from a handheld GPS, noted on a pre-numbered sampling booklet. Samples were 

submitted for analyses similar as with the core samples, however no standards or blanks were included 

with the submitted batches.  No QA/QC monitoring of sample collection or analyses was done for grab 

samples except where specifically mentioned in Boyd and Selway (2015).  

Once the samples arrived in the laboratory, as a routine practice with rock and core at both facilities, the 

entire sample was crushed up to 90% passing 2 mm, mechanically split (250 g) and then pulverized to 

95% passing 150 mesh (105 μm).The prepared sample pulps were analyzed by fire assay for gold on a 

30 gram split with either AAS or ICP Finish, and in some cases by either 45 multi-element analysis with 

Aqua Regia Digest and ICP-OAS and ICP-MS method finishes or by 35 elements using Instrumental 

Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) at Activation Laboratories. Samples at both laboratories reporting 

greater than 3 g/t gold were check assayed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish. 

Selected drill core samples were analyzed using the metallic screen technique by Activation Laboratories. 

The metallic screen procedure is described in detail in Section 11.2 and involves the collection of a 500g 

or 1000g split, which is taken and sieved at 100 mesh (0.149 mm); the entire +100 mesh fraction is fired 

and two 30g samples collected from the -100 mesh are fired in duplicate. Both Swastika Laboratories and 

Activation Laboratories fulfill standard quality assurance/quality control protocols except where 

specifically noted.

In greater detail, the following is a discussion of how the sample preparation and analytical procedures 

changed during the program. Initially, during the program 355 drill core samples were sent to Swastika 

Laboratories for gold analysis by fire assay. Based upon the discovery of telluride minerals in the core it 

was believed that the assays were significantly under-reporting the amount of gold in the core. Selected 

sample rejects and pulps were sent to Activation Laboratories for check analyses by fire assay with ICP 

finish, INAA, and fire assay metallic screen analysis. It was discovered during the sample preparation at 

the Activation Laboratories facility that the Swastika preparation of its samples was inadequate, allowing 

only approximately 50% of sample through 2 mm, much lower than the minimum acceptable level of 80%. 

The result was the reporting of significantly less representative and more erratic gold from the Swastika 

facility, which was supported by the results from selected samples being analyzed using metallic screen 

methodology at the Activations Laboratories facility, although this was not a consistent pattern. INAA 

successfully detected all the gold in sample aliquot but the reporting of meaningful results was hampered 

by a failed internal standard and its small sample aliquot size (<25 g) per analysis in samples commonly 

weighing 3-4 kg in size and possessing a heterogeneous distribution of gold and telluride grains. 

Based upon these findings, the remaining 756 core samples were analyzed by fire assay with ICP finish 

at Activation Laboratories. In summary, 84 and 24 samples also underwent metallic screen and INAA 

analyses, respectively. Generally, the metallic screen analytical results were considered more credible 

than standard fire assay methods because it analyzed more sample material, and in cases of samples 

undergoing multiple analyses, they were chosen as the accepted value despite, in many cases, the 

results being lower than those obtained from the standard fire assay techniques. 

In the author's opinion, the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures follow industry 

standards and are suitable for the purpose of identifying mineralization in drill core. There is no 

relationship between Northstar and Actlabs or Swastika other than that Northstar engaged these 

laboratories to assay drill core. 

11.2 2015 Oban Mining Field Sampling Program 

Field samples collected for analyses have a sample description and the site location, obtained from a 

handheld GPS, noted on a pre-numbered sampling booklet. Sample descriptions include lithology, 

structural measurements, mineralization and alteration. The sample descriptions and locations were also 

entered a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for plotting maps using ArcView GIS software. The samples were 

placed into a numbered bag with the sample tag.  The sampling site was flagged and marked with the 

sample number and tagged with an aluminum tag inscribed with the sample number for future 

identification.

All rock and core samples from the 2015 field and diamond drilling program were submitted to ALS 

Minerals for analysis. Samples were prepared using the PREP-33D method and analyzed using the AU- 

ICP22 and ME-MS41 methods. If a sample assayed >10 g/t Au, the pulp was re-assayed using the 

gravimetric finish method, AU-GRA22, as well as Screen Metallics Gold Method, AU-SCR-21. The screen 

metallic analyses were then considered to be the final gold value. The following descriptions were 

supplied by ALS-Chemex.  

Sample preparation was performed at the ALS Sudbury facility. Samples were dried as required and 

crushed to 90% less than 2 mm or better using a jaw and/or roller crusher. The crushed sample was split 

using a riffle splitter and an approximately 1,000 g split was pulverized to 95% less than 106 microns or 

better using a ring and puck grinding mill. The pulverized splits of the samples were transported by ALS- 

Chemex to their facility in North Vancouver for analyses. Analysis for gold used a fire assay – inductively 

coupled plasma – atomic emission spectrometry (ICP- AES) method, Au-ICP22. The upper and lower 

limits for gold by this method are 10.0 and 0.001 ppm respectively. 

Any samples that exceeded the upper limits of the AU-IC22 method for the gold analyses were re-

analysed using a gravimetric finish, Au-GRA22 method and screen metallics gold method, AU-SCR-21. 

The upper and lower limits for gold detection by this method are 1,000 and .05 ppm respectively.  The 

sample preparation, security and analytical procedure were adequate for the purpose of this report. 

11.3 2015 Oban Mining Drill Program 

The sampling protocol was based on representative sample widths of the mineralogy, lithology, vein, 

structure, or alteration zone within the limits of a maximum sample length of 1.5 m and a minimum sample 

length of 0.3 m. Samples did not cross lithological contacts, changes in structural style, veins/vein sets, or 

strong alteration zones unless the lithology, structure, vein or alteration was less than 0.3 m in width, and 

then only to meet the 0.3 m minimum. 

A removable portion of the sample tag was stapled into the core box at the beginning of the sample 

interval. The core cutter removed half the tag and placed it into a sample bag inscribed with that number. 

The beginning and end of each sample interval was marked on the core with a china marker. The core 

was sawn in half with a core saw using a diamond blade; subsequently, half of the core was placed into a 

numbered bag with the sample tag, and the remaining half of the core was placed in the core box. 

Sample numbers and corresponding intervals were recorded in the drill log. The drill core is currently 

stored at Northstar's secure core shack in Earlton, Ontario.

Core samples were placed in polypropylene rice bags and were securely closed with zip lock ties. The 

bags were individually labeled for shipping and stored at the core cutting facility until shipped. The 

samples were transported from Earlton to the ALS-Chemex laboratory in Sudbury, Ontario for sample 

preparation by Northstar representatives.  The samples were prepared as described previously in Section 

11.2 and then transported by ALS-Chemex to their facility in North Vancouver for analyses. 

A total of 3,359 samples were analyzed for gold by fire assay with an atomic absorption spectroscopy 

finish completed by ALS-Chemex. Analyses for gold used the fire assay method, Au-ICP23 and analyses 

for trace elements used the multi-element ME-MS41 method.  Any samples that returned greater than the 

upper limit for gold were re-analyzed using the methods described in section 11.2.  All samples were also 

analyzed by a multi-element ICP-aqua regia digestion package which included Te, Ag, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. 

Information concerning the lithology, structure, alteration and mineralization was logged and entered into 

an excel spreadsheet. All intervals of core were digitally photographed.  The sample preparation, security 

and analytical procedure were adequate for the purpose of this report. 

11.4 Northstar Gold Bulk 2016 Sampling Program 

Northstar Gold implemented an industry standard QA/QC program under the supervision of the author 

that includes insertion of 7 blanks and 7 blind commercial standards with the 241 field samples in order to 

ensure best practice in sampling and analysis.  During the field sampling program on the Miller Gold 

Property cut channel outcrop or blasted rock samples were taken at systematic intervals on the surface 

by the author or by Northstar technician Marc Cardinal with UTM NAD 83 GPS coordinates recorded in 

the field at the ends of each traverse line.  

The collected surface samples ranged in weight from 5 to 20 kg, predominantly approximately 10 kg.  

Larger than usual samples were gathered to ensure their being representative, bearing in mind the 

nuggety nature of the gold distribution within the mineralized areas on the property as discussed in Boyd 

and Selway (2015).  The samples were zip-lock sealed in secure packages with a sample tag and 

shipped by either company personnel or bonded carrier to the Activation Laboratories accredited facilities 

(ISO/IEC 17025:2005) in Sudbury, Ancaster, and Thunder Bay, Ontario for preparation and analysis.  

One tag was left remaining in the sample book for future reference.  A blank and high-grade gold 

standard OREAS-62E (certified values 9.13 ppm Au, 9.86 ppm Ag) were inserted by Northstar for 

approximately every 30 samples with the batch shipment.  

Once the field samples arrived in the laboratory, the entire sample was crushed with 90% passing 2 mm; 

a 1,000 gram sample pulp was pulverized to 95% passing 149 μm screen (100 Mesh size) and prepared

to be analyzed by fire assay for gold on a 50 g split with an ICP finish, and in most cases an additional 45 

multi-element analysis with ICP-MS method finish was completed.  Samples reporting greater than 2 g/t 

gold were check assayed by metallic screen technique (Actlabs Code 1A4). The metallic screen 

procedure involves the preparation of the 1,000 gram pulp, which is sieved at 100 mesh; the entire +100 

mesh fraction is fired, and two 30 g samples collected from the -100 Mesh fraction were fired in duplicate.  

Activation Laboratories fulfill standard quality assurance/quality control protocols.   

The Camflo Mill head feed sample splits provided for Northstar Gold were sealed in zip-lock secure 

packages by a mill technician and then double packaged by the author at the mill site with sample tags 

added to the outer bags without breaking the secure lock of the inner packages.  These samples and the 

Northstar mill solution sample splits were then driven and submitted to the Activation Laboratories facility 

in Sudbury directly under the custody of the author. The Camflo mill head feed samples and a composite 

mill head sample were also analyzed by metallic screen except that 2,000 gram sample pulps were 

prepared to 90-95% passing 149 μm (100 mesh).  This is similar to the analytical procedure implemented 

for the aforementioned mini bulk sample collected in 2013 from the area of Trenches 1 and 3 and 

discussed in Section 9.  

In general, sample size, preparation and analytical procedures have changed on the Miller Gold Property 

since its acquisition by Northstar Gold. This is outlined in previous technical reports for the Property (Boyd 

and Selway 2015, Hart 2015).  Based upon the discovery of telluride minerals and highly nuggety coarse 

native gold in mineralized samples, it was believed that the assays were initially significantly under-

reporting the amount of gold when using standard sample preparation techniques and 30 gram fire assay 

with Atomic Absorption methodologies. The result was the implementation of an improved sample 

preparation procedure of crushing the entire sample, increasing the level of sample material passing 

through 2 mm screen from 80 to 90%, and the increase in the size the sample pulps to at least 1,000 g 

from the standard 250 g.  

The analytical procedure was further refined during this work program with the preparation of at least 

1,000 g pulps for the metallic screen analysis to make them more representative of the sample. Specific 

instructions were provided to the laboratory with respect to minimizing gold losses in the coarse fraction 

and avoidance of over grinding to reduce breakdown and smearing of tellurides so that greater than 90% 

but less than 95% of the material passes through the 100 mesh screen.  

Concern was raised with respect to the variance of results discovered between the metallic screen gold 

analyses at the Sudbury Activation Laboratories facility and the company's other 2 facilities in Ancaster 

and Thunder Bay. Specifically, 10 reject duplicates and a composite of the Camflo mill feed samples

reviewed and analyzed at the other 2 facilities reported significant and consistent lower gold values in 

comparison to those results reported from the Sudbury facility.  It was unclear if these differences were 

due to minor variations in sample preparations among the facilities or more serious issues at the Sudbury 

facility. Based upon this information and sample material availability, reject duplicates from mill feed and 

field sample batches and from the original 2016 mini-bulk sample batch were sent to AGAT Laboratories 

in Mississauga for independent third party laboratory check analyses using similar preparation and 

methodologies as applied at the Actlabs facilities.   

The results of these check analyses and comparisons with the Actlabs results are presented and 

discussed in Section 12.4.  The sample preparation, security and analytical procedure were adequate for 

the purpose of this report. 

11.5 Northstar 2016 Sampling 

Grab samples collected in 2016 were stored in plastic samples bags with pre-numbered sample tags. The 

samples were transported to Swastika Laboratories, Swastika, ON, by Northstar personnel. The samples 

were crushed up to 80% passing 1.7 mm using low-chrome steel jaw plates, mechanically split (250 g) 

using a rotary splitter and then pulverized to 90% passing 150 mesh (105 μm) using a low-chrome steel 

bowl set. The prepared sample pulps were analyzed by fire assay for gold on a 50 gram split with either 

AAS finish.  

At the time of the analysis of the 2016 grab samples, Swastika was accredited for fire assay analysis 

(ISO/IEC 17025:2005). There is no relationship between Swastika and Northstar other than that Northstar 

commissioned Swastika to analyze samples. 

Northstar added 10 blanks and 9 standards to the samples.  The sample preparation, security and 

analytical procedure were adequate for the purpose of this report. 

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Northstar Grab samples 

No standards or blanks were used during the Northstar 2012-2014 grab sampling.  

A total of 10 blanks were inserted into the sample stream during the 2016 grab sampling. Three blanks 

failed; 2 of the failed blanks were analyzed immediately after samples with high gold grades, which 

indicates that the laboratory may not have cleaned the crusher properly.

A total of 9 standards were included into the sample stream: 6 OREAS 62e standards with certified 

values of 2.47 g/t Au and 3 OREAS 60c standards with certified values of 9.13 g/t Au. All standards 

passed. 

In the context that these were field grab samples obtained for prospecting purposes, the sample data are 

adequate for identifying the presence of gold mineralization and for the purpose of this report. 

12.2 Northstar Gold 2014 Drilling Quality Control 

During the 2014 drill program Northstar submitted with the core samples a total of 130 blind gold standard 

samples and coarse granite or marble blanks at an average rate of one standard and one blank for every 

17 samples which was originally reviewed and reported by Boyd and Selway (2105).  A summary of the

A total of 16 analyses of high grade Oreas 19a with a certified value of 5.49 g/t Au were inserted into the 

sample stream with drill holes MG-14-07, 09, 10 and 11 and submitted to Actlabs (Figure 12-6). All the 

standards passed, but they are slightly bias high as several of the analyses are above the certified value. 

Sample 14420 from drill hole MG-14-11 originally was labelled as Oreas 19a, but it had 13 ppb Au and is 

actually drill core. Sample 14419 was originally labelled as drill core, but it Oreas 19a with 5.7 g/t Au. The 

sample numbers were likely switched in the lab, as the standards were bagged, and the sample tags 

were removed from the sample tag book in the core shack before any drill core was cut.

A total of 41 core duplicates from drill holes MG-14-07 to 15 were analyzed by fire assay by Actlabs. A 

total of 8 of the 41 core duplicates failed for a failure rate of 19.5% (Figure 12-11). This is a high failure 

rate, but note the failed duplicates had 1 sample with > 0.2 g/t Au. The core duplicates that passed had 1 

or both samples with < 0.2 g/t Au. It appears that the high failure rate for core duplicates is more likely 

due to the nugget effect at higher grades than an issue with the analytical method

Six core duplicate pairs from drill holes MG-14-03, 09, 11 and 12 were analyzed for Au by Actlabs by 

metallic screen. The total Au value was plotted for the primary vs. secondary samples and most of the 

samples do not plot along the ideal 1:1 regression line as shown in Figure 12-12. For 3 samples, the 

difference between the primary and secondary samples is significant due to the heterogeneous 

distribution of Au in the drill core.

A plot of the fine fraction vs. the coarse fraction of the same core duplicate samples analyzed by Actlabs 

by metallic screen in Figure 12-13 shows that for the low grade samples the fine and coarse fraction give a 

similar result, but for high grade samples > 3 g/t Au the coarse fraction is significantly higher grade than 

the fine fraction. This is further evidence of the gold nugget effect in the drill core. For example, sample 

14624 from MG-14-12 from 54.0 to 55.0 m has an average of 7.135 g/t Au in the fine fraction and 231 g/t 

Au in the coarse fraction for a total gold value of 12.2 g/t. Sample 14143 from MG-14-09 from 101.0 to 

102.0 m has an average of 14.35 g/t Au in the fine fraction and 214 g/t Au in the coarse fraction for a total 

gold value of 24.9 g/t Au. Sample 14443 from MG-14-11 from 43.5 to 44.50 m has an average of 10.155 

g/t Au in the fine fraction and 74.3 g/t Au in the coarse fraction for a total gold value of 12.7 g/t Au. The 

relationship between sample length and true thickness of the mineralization is not yet known.

purpose of identifying mineralization at depth in drill core. Core duplicates indicate that the coarse-grain 

size of the gold in both its native and telluride forms results a strong nugget effect for the assays. 

12.3 Oban Mining 2015 Drilling Quality Control 

In order to test for contamination, accuracy and precision during the analytical process, quality assurance 

and quality control (QAQC) samples were added to the sample stream every 10 samples for QAQC 

purposes. During the mapping program 18 blanks, 21 standards and 11 duplicates were submitted. 

During the drill program 120 blanks, 109 standards and 111 duplicates were submitted. All the assays 

were imported into a password protected Microsoft Excel database and a QAQC report was generated. 

The review, tables and figures for this drill program were originally reported in Hart (2015).   

A fine silica blank certified by Analytical Solutions Ltd (ASL) was chosen to check for cross-sample 

contamination at the laboratory. This blank had a certified Au value of 0.02 ppm. Blanks were inserted 

every 30th sample, or immediately after a sample that contained visible gold. A value for gold of less than 

0.02 ppm was passed and analysis above that limit was considered a failure. Any result that fell below the 

detection limits of <0.001 were divided by two in order to create a value that can be graphed. 

For the field program, the first 4 blanks were taken from a local limestone aggregate source containing 

little to no Au until the certified fine silica blank arrived on-site. All 18 blanks fell below the accepted value 

indicating that there were no cross-sample contamination problems. 

In the drill program, blanks were inserted every 30th sample in a series of 100 which meant samples 

ending in _10, _40 and _70 were always a blank. In addition, blanks were inserted immediately after 

samples containing visible gold as a way to check for contamination. All 120 blanks fell below the 

maximum certified value of 0.02 ppm.  Additionally, 11 blanks were sent in for inclusion in two analytical 

batches that required re-analysis due to failures of the standards. These 11 blanks also fell below the 

maximum certified value. 

Five certified standards were used in the Miller field and drilling programs. Three certified standards from 

CDN Resources Laboratories Ltd., CDN-GS-2K (low grade), CDN-GS-10D (high grade), and CDN-CM- 

38 were used briefly at the beginning of the Miller field program.  CDN-CM-38 was also used in the 2015 

drill program as a standard for Ag, Cu and Mo. For general use, these standards were replaced with 

certified OREAS standards OREAS 60C (lower grade) and OREAS 62E (higher grade) for both the field 

and drilling programs. These standards, from Ore Research and Exploration P/L, came in a 60 g foil 

packet and had specific values and ranges for Au and Ag (Table 12-2). A standard was inserted every 

30th sample. The label was scratched off the packet so that the laboratory would not know which

standard was being analyzed. A failure limit of +/- 2 absolute standard deviations from the certified value 

was set as the failure limit. If a standard fell outside of this range, the laboratory was requested to re-run 

the batch. 

For the field program, there were no batch failures that required re-analysis although one standard 

(R333450, OREAS 62E) from batch SD15085705 failed for Ag. Considering that the objective of this 

program was the gold analyses, and that R333450 failed for Ag, the failure was documented but no re- 

analysis was requested.  There were several QAQC failures regarding standards during the drilling 

program, see Figure 12-14, Figure 12-15 and Figure 12-16. Out of the 109 standards, 9 failed for gold, 

representing 8% of the total analyses and 7 failed for silver, representing 6%. The majority of these 

failures occurred in two batches (SD15122210 and SD15126103) which affected 298 samples in drill 

holes MG15-17 and MG15-18. These entire two batches were re-analyzed. Due to the small sample 

weight of the standard and blanks, new standard and blank packets were sent to the laboratory to be 

inserted in place of the originals. The laboratory determined that flux had not been properly adjusted to 

accommodate the silica rich nature of the standards. This lack of adjustment was of concern to Oban as 

the targeted mineralization is silica-rich. However, the other 100 standards returned gold values within the 

expected limits suggesting if there was a flux problem it must have been only with these two batches. As 

well, there does not appear to be much difference between the gold concentrations comparing original 

analytical results to the results of the re-analyses. To provide an additional check on these batches, 11 

samples were selected from the two failed batches, along with 5 standards for submission as "check 

assays" at Bureau Veritas Laboratories located in the Vancouver area. The results of the check assays 

were comparable to the results from ALS.

Figure 12-16 CDN-CM-3860C Standard Results from 2015 Miller Gold Property Drilling Program, red line represents 
the certified Au value and the orange lines represent 2 standard deviations from Hart (2015). 

 

One final QA/QC issue was with regard to the use of multi-element standard CDN-CM-38 with certified 

values for Au, Ag, Cu and Mo. The results for Mo consistently fell below the 2 standard deviation limit. 

The Mo value for this standard is certified but there is a note on the certificate that 3 laboratories failed to 

provide Mo analyses by an aqua regia method during the round robin. It should also be noted that ALS 

states for the ME-MS41 method that some refractory minerals and elements such as molybdenum are not 

brought into solution in aqua regia. In these cases, it was suggested that fire assay may be used in 

combination with ME- MS41, or a 4 acid digestion may be preferable.   Although noted in past exploration 

program, it was determined that Mo is not an element of potential economic importance on this property 

and these analytical problems were not considered to be an issue. 

A pulp duplicate was inserted every 30th sample to test for precision. The laboratory was instructed to 

separate the pulp of the selected sample into 2 parts and analyze these parts separately. The results of 

the sample and its duplicate were then compared by calculating its mean, absolute difference and percent 

relative difference. A sample was flagged for failure if the relative percent difference of the sample and 

duplicate exceeded 100%. The calculation for relative percent difference is (A - B) / ((A + B)/2) X 100

where "A" is the original Au value in ppm and "B" is the duplicate Au value in ppm. Any result which fell 

below detection limits (<0.001) was divided by 2 to create a value for graphing and calculations. 

Due to the nuggety nature of the Au mineralization encountered in this project, duplicate repeatability was 

expected to be difficult to measure. However, the results for the duplicate analyses compared better than 

expected. In total, 111 duplicate samples were taken during the drill program. Only 6 samples failed with 

a greater than 100% relative difference. Although these failures were flagged in the database, no action 

was required by the laboratory. A total of 55 duplicates failed with >25% relative difference, 47 of these 

samples had assay results <0.1 g/t Au. There are 57 samples with <25% relative difference that have 

assay results<0.1 g/t Au so these differences are probably not related to an analytical problem on 

samples with low gold values. It may be that these differences are the result of an accessory mineral 

phase, and there are very fine-grained gold telluride minerals identified in the veins on the property. 

As part of the QAQC program, 11 rejects from MG15-17 and MG15-18 and 4 standards were sent to 

Bureau Veritas Mineral Laboratories (ACME) for check assay. The check assay samples were chosen so 

there were low, medium and high grade samples. 

All the standards returned analyses within the accepted limits for this program. As the samples selected 

as duplicates were shipped directly from ALS to ACME, it was not known in advance that sample 

R330459 did not have enough material remaining to analyze. The percentage difference between the 

ALS and ACME samples varied from 3% to 197% (Table 12-3). This variation is comparable to the 

percentage difference from the duplicates.  Due to the coarse-grained, nuggety nature of the Au 

mineralization encountered in this project, duplicate repeatability was expected to be difficult to measure.

12.4 2016 - 17 Bulk Sampling and Milling Quality Control Analysis 

As a consequence of the initially returned discrepancies between the results of the Camflo Mill and the 

initial Northstar Activation Laboratories Sudbury facility mill feed splits, which reported weighted averages 

of 5.13 g/t vs.11.2 g/t Au, respectively, ten reject duplicates of the Northstar splits were sent for check 

analyses at the Activation Laboratories Ancaster and Thunder Bay facilities. The results indicated a major 

decrease in the amount of gold reported in comparison to the Actlabs Sudbury results even though similar 

metallic screen methodologies as described in Section 11.4 were utilized.   

Earlier in 2016, the 59 samples that had been collected from the mini-bulk sample discussed in Section 

9.3 had also been analyzed at Actlabs Sudbury in April 2016 for Northstar and were now in question.  

During the visit for the November 2016 bulk sampling program, the author obtained and submitted for 

analysis referee samples (15419, 15421 and 15422) from 3 of the mini-bulk sample bags. These samples 

returned much lower gold contents from the Actlabs Ancaster facility in comparison to the initial April 2016 

analyses.  Based upon the discovered Au analytical differences between the Actlabs Sudbury and 

Thunder Bay / Ancaster facilities for the Camflo Mill splits and mini-bulk samples, it was concluded that an 

expanded program of Quality Control Analysis required the sending of multiple additional reject duplicates 

from all of Northstar's 2016 batches submitted for analysis for metallic screen gold analysis to a third 

party independent accredited analytical facility for check analyses to assess the extent of analytical 

failure. 

In summary, 18 remaining reject samples from the Camflo Mill feed batch, 6 reject samples from the April 

2016 mini-bulk batch, and 16 reject samples from this program's on-site exploration and bulk sampling 

batch all were sent to the AGAT Laboratories analytical facility in Mississauga, Ontario for metallic screen

The reject duplicate analyses for the in-situ field samples between the AGAT Laboratories, Mississauga 

and Activation Laboratories, Ancaster facilities showed great variation due to the erratic and nuggety 

nature of the gold mineralization but overall there was reasonably good agreement between them, within 

5% when comparing their average values. The reject duplicate and referee sample analyses for the mini-

bulk samples, however, showed that the Mississauga and Ancaster combined average value is 49% 

lower in comparison to the initial reported April 2016 Actlabs Sudbury facility average Au value.  In 

addition, the reject duplicate analyses for the mill feed samples show the Mississauga and combined 

Ancaster / Thunder Bay average values are respectively 54% and 47% lower than the initial Sudbury Au 

results.  There was no significant difference found in the Au analytical results between the Ancaster and 

Thunder Bay laboratories. 

Based upon these results it can be concluded that there is a systematic gold by metallic screen analytical 

difference at the Sudbury facility even though the reported analyses passed Actlabs' internal QA/QC 

checks. The reason for this discrepancy remains unknown. The Actlabs Sudbury lab was closed 

permanently in January 2017.  Northstar is planning to re-analyse where possible the remaining 52 mini-

bulk sample rejects from the April 2016 analyses as a result of these findings. 

For the samples sent to Activation Laboratories, a total of 7 each of silica sand blanks and high-grade 

Oreas 62e gold standards with certified value of 9.13 ppm Au for fire assay were inserted with the 241 

field samples sent for analysis including those covering the bulk sample.  Three each of the blanks and 

Oreas 62e standards were inserted with the 58 samples collected from the previous mini-bulk sample.  

Confidence limits at 95% were 8.97 - 9.30 ppm.  For the reject duplicates sent to AGAT Laboratories a 

total of 5 Oreas 206 Au standards with certified value of 2.197 ppm Au and 95% confidence limits of

12.5 Miller Gold Project Site Visits 

12.5.1 2014-15 Site Visits 

Multiple site visits have been completed by the authors and Qualified Persons. The first visit was 

conducted by Trevor Boyd and Elisabeth Ronacher, both "independent qualified persons" in accordance 

with National Instrument 43-101, from June 2 – 27, 2014 to log and sample the drill core, inspect the drill, 

conduct independent surface sampling at the Property and monitor the QA/QC during the drill program.  

The second visit was conducted by Trevor Boyd on March 27, 2015 with the purpose of checking 

locations of claim posts using GPS focusing on the newly staked claims in January 2015 and choosing 

independent drill core samples to be analyzed at a third laboratory. These site visits were in context of the 

completion of the 2015 Miller Gold Property 43-101 Technical Report (Boyd and Selway 2015).  

During the period of the first site visit, Trevor Boyd, collected a series of check samples from 2 main re-

discovered surface exposures of visible gold mineralization overlying areas of where No. 1 Vein is 

projected to trend towards the surface in the vicinity of drill holes MG14-14 and 15.  The first outcrop Area 

1 was approximately over the exposure to be covered by Trench 1 in the 2016 program.  Six composite 

grab samples consisting of mixed quartz vein and wall rock material were obtained over an exposed 

mineralized zone approximately 2 metres wide and 25 metres long cut-off along strike by swamp and 

overburden. The 6 samples totaling 51.5 kg returned a weight averaged grade of 10.7 g/t Au. The second 

area (Area 2) of mixed quartz veins and wall rock was over the exposure to be covered by Trench 3 in the 

2016 program.  Five composite grab samples totaling 40 kg obtained over an approximate 20 by 2 metre 

mineralized exposure adjacent to a historic adit portal and returned a weight averaged grade of 4.2 g/t 

Au. The results are tabulated in Table 12-6.

submitted for metallurgical testing and assayed 51.1 g/t Au (Section 13.0). 

During the second site visit, access to the Property was made by 4-wheel truck and snow-tracked ATV 

whereupon property claim posts were located by GPS cords and photographed as shown in Figure 12-17.  

An attempt was made to reach bedrock but due to the thickness of the snow cover at this time of the year

In addition, during the second trip Northstar's secured core storage facility in Earlton was visited (Figure 

12-18) in which 8 quarter core samples from the 2014 drill program plus a gold standard and blank were 

chosen, bagged, and submitted to the AGAT Laboratories preparation facility in Sudbury. 

The submitted samples were prepared by crush to 90% passing 2mm, split to 250 g and pulverize to 85% 

passing 75um. The laboratory was notified of the possible presence of tellurides and nuggety nature of 

the gold distribution within the samples. The samples were analyzed for gold at the AGAT Laboratories 

facility at Mississauga by method code 202-552, Au by fire assay, ICP-OES Finish, 50g with a range 

0.001 – 10 ppm with the results presented in Table 12-7.

Despite the high variability of the analytical results in comparison to the original sample assays, they are 

generally positive in context of the nuggety character of the gold mineralization. 

12.5.2 2016-2018 Site Visits 

From November 2 to 11, 2016, Trevor Boyd, P.Geo. of Ronacher McKenzie visited the Miller Gold 

Property to referee and aid the mining and stockpile of the bulk sample by Northstar Gold. as well as the 

gathering of the trench evaluation and bulk sample monitor samples.  During the program the author 

monitored the stripping of the areas of all the 4 trenches, the blasting and excavating of Trenches 1 to 3, 

and the mining of the bulk sample from Trenches 1 and 3.  During the site visit, the author supervised the 

gathering of the cut channel and blasted rock samples in the areas of the 4 trenches and the insertion of 

blanks and gold standards prior to shipping them to Activation Laboratories facility in Sudbury for 

analyses.  

Since the author was involved in monitoring the sampling program directly, no separate check samples 

were taken concurrently by the author during this program on the Miller Gold Property or at the Camflo 

Mill except for three referee sample gathered from the bags containing the mini-bulk sample which had 

been collected and analyzed earlier in 2016.  The 3 referee samples were collected before the mini-bulk 

sample material was added to the main bulk sample batch in this program since the author had neither 

been contracted to referee nor reviewed the original gathering and analysis of the mini-bulk material in 

April 2016.   

On December 1 and 2
nd

, the author visited the Camflo Mill on behalf of Northstar to observe with George 

Pollock, Northstar's President, the contract processing of the bulk sample, which recorded at the mill site 

a measured total of 1,005 humid or 932 dry metric tonnes.  Procedures by the mill for monitoring the gold 

inventory before, during and after the processing of the samples are outlined in detail in the Camflo Mill 

Gold Inventory document (Richmont Mines Inc. 2015) and include the measurement of ore levels in 

primary and secondary bins and the sampling of gold concentrations in leaching solution tanks, agitator 

slurry tanks, and gold solution tanks.  During processing, crushed head feed samples for gold analysis 

were gathered every 15 minutes, composited and split every hour with 1 split each provided to Camflo 

and Northstar.  Monitoring and sampling of the gold inventory and processing containers was completed 

with Vickie Cyr, Mill Metallurgist in the presence of the author or George Pollock with check samples 

gathered from the 3 leaching solution tanks, 6 agitator slurry tanks, and gold riche, gold pauvre and 

storage solution containers on December 1 and 4th immediately before and after the processing of 

Northstar's material.  The samples were split into 3 parts, 1 each for the Camflo Mill, Northstar, and a third

referee sample stored at the mill site.  The details of the monitoring process and results are outlined in 

Boyd (2017). 

The milling process used for the Beaufor Mine ore was somewhat adjusted for the Northstar bulk sample 

due to its range of characteristics within its mineralized material, consisting largely of gold tellurides, 

coarse free gold plus lesser gold associated with the 3-5% disseminated pyrite based upon findings from 

field and metallurgical work to-date on the Miller Gold Property (Boyd 2014, Boyd and Selway 2015, 

Steyn, 2016).  The coarser gold tellurides are slower to dissolve in comparison to the fine gold in the 

Beaufor ore requiring higher levels of cyanide and lead nitrite to be added to the leach tanks as well as 

additional lime added to the agitator tanks to raise the pH to 12.  The leaching process was also extended 

to 71 hours from the standard 48 hours to promote gold dissolution until December 4 after which the 

process was terminated due to the reduction of flow through the filter press.  Some soil contamination in 

the bulk sample caused frothing in the agitator tanks which may have hampered gold precipitation and 

caused the flow reduction. 

According to the Camflo Mill Daily Report, the average measured head grade of the fire assay with atomic 

absorption finish analyses of the Camflo Mill splits of the 23 head feed samples was 5.13 g/t gold; the 

recovered gold grade was calculated to be approximately 4.0 g/t with a stated mill recovery for the 

Northstar bulk sample from December 1
st
 and 4

th
 of 95.75%.  This is comparable to the average weighted 

grade of 19 mill feed samples for the Northstar splits of 5.06 g/t Au.  Initially, however, the first set of 

analyses of the Northstar splits completed at the Actlabs Sudbury laboratory returned a reported weighted 

average of 11.2 g/t Au suggesting a major discrepancy with the Camflo Mill splits average head grade 

which was discussed in detail in Section 12.3. 

The Camflo Gold Inventory document reported 187.643 troy ounces of raw bullion, including 172.52 troy 

ounces in a gold bar shipped to the Royal Canadian Mint and 15.123 ounces of scrap gold in the furnace 

were recovered of which 71.935 ounces belong to Camflo Mill based upon the differences in measured 

gold amounts in the leach, agitator and solution tanks on December 1
st
 and 4

th
 for a total adjusted net 

recovery of bullion doré of 115.695 ounces from 932 tonnes of feed. The overall estimated mill return is 

65.75% based on the net return of 100.542 ounces to Northstar on a measured head grade of 5.1 g/t Au 

representing 152.9 ounces of gold at the mill head, considering total gold losses in the grinding circuit, 

tailings, furnace room and refinery.  The Camflo Mill credited 100.542 ounces to Northstar with no clear 

explanation based upon the Camflo inventory.  The difference between the Camflo Mill measured head 

grade and calculated recovered grade for the bulk sample may be attributed to gold losses in mill grinding 

but this is difficult to verify.

The Camflo Mill reported measured and calculated head grade was initially thought to be significantly 

more different from the reported Northstar head grade based upon the reported analyses of the 23 

Northstar splits of the original mill feed samples completed at the Activation Laboratories Sudbury facility, 

described in Section 11.4.  However, analyses of 10 duplicates of these samples sent to Actlabs' Thunder 

Bay and Ancaster facilities reported considerably lower grades, which were similar to the Camflo Mill 

measured results.   As a result of the discrepancies in reported results between the different Actlabs 

facilities, 18 reject duplicates of the remaining mill feed sample material were sent to AGAT Laboratories 

for independent third party check analyses with the results presented and discussed in Quality Control 

Analysis Section 12.3. 

Another site visit was completed by Elisabeth Ronacher, P.Geo., on June 7, 2018. Dr. Ronacher visited 

Northstar's secure drill core facility (Figure 12-19) reviewed selected drill holes from the 2015 drilling 

program and collected check samples from holes MG-15-18 and MG-15-24. The intervals reviewed in drill 

hole MG-15-24 were pink intrusive rock with ~5-10% quartz veins. Visible gold and tellurides were 

observed at 53.85 m (sample E5518314). The interval reviewed in hole MG-15-18 consisted also of a 

pink intrusive with quartz veins. Tellurides were in a quartz observed between 255. 00 and 255.8 m 

(sample E5518319). Visible gold was observed in sample E558320. Table 12-8.

The results of check samples generally correspond with the original samples if the nuggety nature of the 

mineralization is considered. The results indicated that gold is present in the 2015 drill core. 

Dr. Ronacher also collected grab samples on the property during the personal inspection. The first area 

inspected was the area of the Planet Syenite; the locations of 2015 channel sampling were visited (Figure 

12-20). One grab sample of a quartz vein with molybdenite was collected in the Planet Syenite area 

(Table 12-9). The collar location of drill hole MG-15-24 was also visited (Figure 12-21). In addition, 

several historic pits were observed in this area. 

The area of Trenches 1 to 4 was also visited (Figure 12-22) and two samples were collected from Trench 

1 and 1 sample from Trench 4 (Table 12-9). At Trench 4, visible gold was observed in the volcanic host 

rock. The assay results show that gold is present in the samples from the area of the Planet Syenite and 

from the trenches. 

The area of the Allied Syenite was also visited; historic pits from which grab samples collected by 

Northstar were observed.  Quartz veins with tellurides were noticed at the historic pits

13.0   MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 2013 - 14 Gold Metallurgical Test Programs 

A 30 kg sub-sample obtained from the 2013 13 tonne bulk sample discussed in Section 9.3 consisting of 

quartz veined material hosting visible gold was submitted by Northstar for gravity recoverable gold (GRG) 

bench testing in September 2013 at the Activation Laboratories Ltd. Metallurgy Department using a 

Knelson Concentrator in a gold recovery circuit (Steyn 2013). The sample was crushed to 100% -850 μm 

for the 1st pass through the Knelson Concentrator, with the tailings from the 1st pass milled 42% -75 μm 

for the 2nd pass, and 83% -75 μm for the 3rd pass through the concentrator.  The sample head grade 

was 51.1 g/t Au with a 94.2% gold recovery using gravity concentration and the final tails from the test 

had 2.93 g/t of gold remaining. 

Four pails of material were sent to SMC (Canada) Ltd. for testing with results being described by Smirle 

(2013). Two of the pails contained white to rusty quartz plus small amounts of metallic luster while the 

second 2 pails contained quartz and small amounts of metallic oxidation therefore pails containing similar 

material were processed together.  Each batch of material was mixed then split, fed through a Bico 

pulveriser, passed through a 60 mesh screen and then sent to the gravity separator except for a small 

portion separated for assay.  A gravity concentrate was recovered with the remainder, except for a small 

portion removed for assay, and was passed through a rolling mill and then screened at 200 mesh with 

another assay sample removed. The remainder was fed to a Denver float cell with a Dow frother plus 

xanthate producing a concentrate.  Overall the reported recoveries were 92.3% and 96.2% for the two 

sets of material. It was noted that no visible gold was observed in the sample material and that this may 

be due to the gold presenting itself as a telluride.  

13.2 2016 - 17 Gold Metallurgical Test Programs   

In early 2016, 2 hand cobbed samples, one each of high and low gold grade, originally obtained in 2014 

from the area of Trench 1 where Vein #1 reaches the surface in the same location as the aforementioned 

mini-bulk sample, were submitted to Actlabs in Thunder Bay for a series of bench metallurgical tests.  The 

purpose of the testing was to determine the gold recovery using a combination of gravity concentration, 

flotation, and cyanidation. The flotation and gravity products were analyzed to determine ARD 

characteristics and deleterious element compositions.  The results of the flotation tests were variable but 

showed the amenability of the use of a gravity circuit for this mineralized material for the successful 

recovery of gold and for the planning of the milling flow chart.  Details of the tests completed, and their 

results are reported in Steyn (2016).  It is noted in the report that a mineralogical study of the gravity

concentrate indicated that the gold occurs as gold bismuth tellurides, native gold, electrum, and gold and 

silver tellurides (Steyn 2013).  The gold or gold containing mineral grain size in the concentrate was on 

average 20 - 60 μm whereas the grains in the tailings were <3 μm. 

During the 2016 - 17 bulk sampling program, discussed in Section 9.3, a composite sample taken from 

the rejects of the 23 Northstar splits samples from the Camflo Mill feed material was prepared for 

metallurgical testing at Actlabs in Thunder Bay.  A test metallurgical program for this sample that mimics 

the grinding and cyanidation processes at the Camflo Mill was undertaken.  In addition, the composite 

sample underwent a series of gravity concentration plus grinding and preparation tests at different mesh 

sizes in order to further assess the most beneficial means minimizing the loss of gold during preparation 

for analysis and recovery.   

Initial results from 2 cyanide leach tests using 2,000 g composite mill head samples under the same 

conditions as were present in the Camflo mill reported 96.1% and 97.7% overall gold dissolution in 72 

hours. Gold dissolution at 45 hours was 95.5% and 97.3%. These results represent a marked 

improvement over previous leach tests and demonstrate that high gold recoveries are possible when 

using a higher solution pH of 11.9 to 12.1 and maintaining moderate cyanide concentrations in the range 

of 650 to 700 ppm NaCN to assist in the dissolution of gold tellurides (Steyn 2017).  

For the gravity recoverable gold tests using the composite mill head samples, 70% to 75% of the total 

gold was recovered in a single pass at a coarse 1 mm feed size. Overall gravity recoveries using a 

Knelson concentrator and Wilfley table were 87.8% and 80.3% respectively. While the reported recovery 

is encouraging from a metallurgical standpoint it nevertheless makes avoiding gold losses in communition 

of sample material from the property more challenging as the majority of the gold is being liberated at 

coarse +1 mm crush sizes.  During the preparation of Northstar's exploration samples some gold losses 

were experienced in crushing and grinding due to coarse nuggety gold getting trapped within and soft 

gold bismuth tellurides smearing out on the steel equipment.  

The results of 7 x 1000 g flotation tests of 30 minutes duration on both composite head samples and the 

Wilfley table tailings were reasonable with a range of gold recoveries between 39.2% and 95.2%. The 

best recovery of 95.2% on the composite mill head sample was achieved using a combination of Cytec's 

AEROPHINE 3418A and AERO 6697 collectors along with a standard MIBC frother. Recoveries on the 

gravity tailings were lower with the Cytec's AERO 407 promoter achieving the best result of 67%, 

although the combination of AEROPHINE 3418A and AERO 6697 produced the highest grade 

concentrate (Steyn 2017).

The bulk sample mill head mineralized material utilized for the 2016-17 metallurgical programs is 

considered to be representative of the mineralized body on the Property because the sample was 

extracted from the narrow high grade quartz vein considerably diluted by low grade mafic wall rock. This 

contrasts with the material utilized for the 2013-14 metallurgical programs which were completed on the 

quartz vein material only.  

The results indicate that high recoveries are possible from the mineralized material using a combination 

of gravity, cyanide leach and flotation metallurgical methods but considerable additional testing is 

required the define a flow chart for economic appraisal due to the variety of settings and textures of the 

gold mineralization in native, telluride and sulphide-hosted forms.   

13.3 Mineralogical Testing 

Two drill core samples from MG-14-09 were submitted to Actlabs for modal mineralogy late in 2014: 

• Sample 14143 from 101.0 to 102.0 m with 24.9 g/t Au determined by metallic screen 

• Sample 14149 from 106.0 to 107.0 m with 10.7 g/t Au determined by metallic screen 

Both samples were logged as being syenite with intense chlorite alteration with disseminated pyrite. 

One polished section from each sample was prepared for analysis with carbon coating (Bindi, 2014). The 

polished sections were analyzed for modal mineralogy on a Quanta 600F scanning electron microscope 

(SEM). By a combination of image analysis employing atomic number contrast imaging (from back- 

scattered electron – or BSE- signal intensity) and Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) using Bruker 

5010 SDD detectors, minerals and other attributes are directly measured on the SEM Mineral Liberation 

Analyzer ("MLA"). BSE signal intensity is proportional to the mean atomic number of minerals. The Field 

Emission Gun was used at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a spot size of 5 and a working distance 

of 12.5 mm. 

The modal mineralogy of the entire samples confirmed the logged lithology of syenite (high albite, low 

quartz and K-feldspar content) and the presence of strong chlorite alteration and disseminated pyrite 

(Table 13-1). 

Four gold grains were identified in sample 14149 which were both liberated and locked, ranging in size 

from 5-75 μm and associated with tsumoite (BiTe). The gold grains were Au-Ag alloys of variable 

composition.

These results were useful for mineralogically characterizing typical gold bearing mineralized material 

hosted in the Allied Syenite.  

Two gravity concentrates and tailings from a sub-sample of the 2013 bulk sample (section 9.3 and 13.1) 

were also analyzed by MLA. The concentrates consisted dominantly of pyrite (67.88 wt.%) and quartz 

(21.78 wt.%); a third tailings sample consisted dominantly of quartz. Gold and silver occurred in the form 

of native gold, electrum and as gold and silver tellurides and sulfides. Gold and silver-bearing minerals 

comprise 1.36 wt. % of the concentrate. Bismuth and lead tellurides and their oxidation products are also 

found in trace amounts (1.21 wt. % in the concentrate). In the concentrate, most of the native gold and 

electrum occur as free grains (80 % and 72 %, respectively).  Some of the gold is locked in pyrite. Gold 

can also be found as small disseminated grains in iron oxides and Bi telluride.

15.0   ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The Property is surrounded by mineral claims belonging to Orefinders Resources Inc. bounding on its 

north and east side in Boston and McElroy townships, Barry-Hollinger Gold Mines Ltd. to the immediate 

northwest in Boston Township, and Les Entreprises Ogima Inc. bounding on the south side in Pacaud 

and Catherine townships.   In general, patent land holdings are scattered throughout the area, the most 

significant being the 160 acre Searles Patented holding in Lot 12, Con 6 of Catherine Township bounding 

to the immediate southeast of the main Property workings. This holding is included in the discussion of 

the 1987 Miller-Independence exploration work report (French 1988).  

There are 4 deposits with gold mineralization in the area that have either had past production or report 

resources. These deposits are, in order of increasing distance from the Property; the Barry-Hollinger, 

Terry Zone (Teck), Gold Hill, and Cathroy-Larder (Mirado). The Barry- Hollinger, Gold Hill, and Cathroy-

Larder are past producers and much of the production was completed more than 60 years ago. 

1. The Barry Hollinger deposit is approximately 2 km northwest of the Allied and 1.5 km west of the 

Planet syenites. The deposit consists of 12 veins although only the No.7 vein had any development. 

The No.7 vein is 8 ft. wide, 057° dipping 70° to the south, and consists of parallel veinlets or irregular 

lenses of quartz hosted by green schist. Gold is associated with quartz and chalcopyrite. 

Development consisted of a 2 compartment shaft to 1,000 ft with a winze from 1,000 to 2,250 ft, and 

a 150 ton mill. A total of 69,891 oz Au from 267,741 tons for a 0.26 oz/t recover grade was reported 

by Gordon et al. (1979). 

2. The Terry Zone is located about 2 km southwest of the Allied Syenite across the trend of the 

regional strike. Gold mineralization is hosted by quartz containing 5-10% pyrite hosted by 

metavolcanic rocks and to a lesser extent quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes (Théberge, 2009).  Most of 

the mineralization is contained in a 180 m by 300 m area with a thickness of several centimetres to 

4.5 m. 

3. The Gold Hill mine is located about 3.3 km to the southeast of the Allied Syenite along the trend 

of the regional strike. Mineralization consists of lenses and veins of interbanded quartz and sulphide, 

with the sulphide consisting of pyrite with minor chalcopyrite, molybdenite and galena. The 

mineralization can be traced for 1,100 feet on surface and underground channel sampling returned 

up to 5.6 oz Au over 1.7 ft. A 1,200 foot shaft and 6,000 ft of lateral development were completed in 

the late 1920s. A total of 660 oz Au were produced from 4,616 tons for a recovery grade of 0.14 oz/t 

Au (Gordon et al. 1979).

4. The most advanced and presently active gold project is The Cathroy-Larder, or Mirado, mine 

located approximately 4.5 km east of the Allied and 5.0 km east of the Planet syenites in the 

southeast portion of McElroy Township.   An open pit was in operation in 1987, producing 7,200 oz 

Au from 67,500 tons at a grade of 0.107 oz/t Au and leaving 3 stockpiles of material (Reddick and 

Lavigne, 2012).  A report by SRK Canada Inc. (Weiershäuser et al, 2013) reported a total inferred 

mineral resource of 442,000 ounces grading 1.29 g/t Au with the distribution of the resource shown 

in Table 15-1; the cut-off grades assumed a gold price of US$1,400 per ounce and metallurgical 

recovery was assumed to be 95%.

In January 2018, Orefinders Resources Inc. announced the results of its Preliminary Economic 

Assessment for the South Zone Open Pit part of the Mirado Gold Mine.  The PEA considered only 

production from a specific area which encompasses approximately 5% of Orefinders' Mirado Project. The 

Mineral Resource estimated within the PEA for mining is within the South Zone's open pit, and is near 

surface mineralization, which can be economically mined within a relatively short time frame and without 

the use of an on-site processing or tailings facility

16.0  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

No additional information or explanation is necessary to make this technical report more understandable. 

17.0  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Historical exploration on the Miller Gold Property has been sporadic and not always well-focused as the 

Property was often subdivided into a series of smaller separately owned claims or properties. 

Consolidation of the smaller properties by Northstar has allowed for a more systematic examination of the 

potential of the Miller Gold Property to host economic gold mineralization.   

17.1 Diamond Drilling 

Encouraging diamond drilling results from the initial 2014 program, primarily testing the historically known 

No. 1 Vein Zone in holes MG14-02, MG14-03, MG14-07, MG14-09 and MG14-12, suggest this 

mineralized zone extends to the north, incorporates into the Allied Syenite, and remains open continuing 

further along down dip to the north as reported in Boyd and Selway (2015).  Further to the south this vein 

system trends up dip to shallow depths and in places becomes exposed on the surface about 30 and 60 

metres south of hole MG14-15, but the outcropping of auriferous veining is scattered and difficult to 

delineate. This may be because of the tree cover and paucity of detailed surface exploration and 

sampling on the Property for the past 80 years. 

North of hole MG14-01, the demonstration of the relationship of the gold mineralization between No. 1 

Vein and the Allied Syenite and the knowledge that the intrusive is part of a continuous arc of alkaline 

magmatism that extends for 3,000 metres to the north suggests that the gold potential for the property is 

more extensive than historically believed. 

The target of the 2015 Oban diamond drilling program was a syenite-associated disseminated gold 

deposit style of mineralization in the Allied, Planet and Meilleur syenites. The work completed in 2015, as 

reported in Hart (2015), provided a better understanding of the gold mineralization in the Allied Syenite 

and was also successful in identifying additional gold mineralization in the Planet and Meilleur syenites. 

The results of the drill program were better than the surface sampling for the Allied, Planet and Meilleur 

syenites suggesting and the full potential of these intrusions to host economic gold mineralization has not 

been fully tested.  A better understanding of the controls on the quartz veining is needed to assess if 

there is a potential for additional mineralization at depth. It is noted by Hart (2015) that historical work has

concentrated on the southern portion of the Meilleur Syenite where the gold mineralization appears to be 

lower grade.  The 2015 exploration program suggests that the north portion of the intrusion is larger than 

exposed on surface and hosts better gold mineralization in core than on surface. 

17.2 Bulk Sampling and Surface Sampling 

Northstar's dual purpose for 2016-17 bulk sampling program was to obtain a sizable bulk sample to 

assess the gold grade, dilution and mine-ability of the stripped surface exposures; and to explore the 

stripped areas to assess the continuing continuity of the gold mineralization along strike and down-dip.  

The program was successful in demonstrating, for No. 1 Vein and other veins on the Property, the 

presence and continuity of high grade, mineralized gold mineralization, over albeit narrow and variable 

widths, hosted by the veins and immediate wall rock. The results allow Northstar to project the probable 

trend and attitude of these zones for follow-up exploration.      

The reported average Camflo Mill head grade of 5.13 g/t for the dry 932 tonne bulk sample is reasonably 

comparable to the combined weighted average grade of 8.77 g/t Au obtained from the analysis the 90 in-

situ comparable channel and broken rock samples gathered over the bulk sampling areas of Trenches 1 

and 3, bearing in mind the effect of increased dilution of up to 70% basalt in the delivered bulk sample.  It 

is noted that this average grade is reported based upon the removal of the reported highest grade blasted 

rock sample (284 g/t Au); when this sample is included the average grade increases to 11.2 g/t Au.   

These in-situ field sample results provide only a general grade guideline in supporting the mill head 

grades because the Au contents of both the basalt wall-rock (approximately 100 ppb to 2 g/t Au) and 

quartz vein (approximately 4–284 g/t Au) are highly variable, more variable than the estimated wall rock 

dilution or the weights of the individual samples. These reported average grades, however, are supported 

by the results of previous exploration and sampling in the 2 trenches areas.  As previously reported, the 

author had earlier collected a series of composite grab surface samples from trenches 1 and 3 reporting 

weighted average grades of 10.7 and 4.2 g/t Au, respectively, as reported in Boyd and Selway (2015). 

A working analytical methodology to produce accurate and repeatable gold analyses of the mineralized 

material on the Property is continuing to be developed by Northstar during this program as outlined in 

Section 11.  Analytical challenges exist for the mineralized samples because much of the gold appears to 

occur as gold-bismuth tellurides, which are difficult to analyze.  The gold analysis is further complicated 

by the coarse texture and soft character of the gold-bismuth tellurides in comparison to other gold 

telluride mines in the Kirkland Lake Camp.  Gold losses during sample preparation can occur when 

samples undergo over-grinding resulting in smearing of gold telluride onto grinding equipment.  In

addition, some coarse gold appears to be lost in grinding when sample material is over-pulverized. The 

results of this program suggest that a minor change in the analytical procedure for gold mineralized 

samples may result in a wide variation in reported results. 

In terms of the evaluative sampling purpose of the Project, all 4 of the stripped and/or blasted areas were 

identified as indicating open continuity in their gold zones.  After the bulk sample was gathered, additional 

chip sampling in Trench 1 exposures at 2 to 3 metres depth demonstrated that the narrow but high-grade 

No. 1 Vein remains open both down dip (Traverses 13 to 17) to the north and along strike to the east 

(Traverse 1) and west (Traverses 3 & 4) as shown in Table 9-5.   

Within the Trench 2 exposures, No. 1 Vein was not successfully exposed by blasting, however, in the 

area of the channel sampling (Traverse 2, Table 9-7), stringer veining and high grade samples in the 

hanging wall rocks suggested the mineralized system remains open and continues at shallow depths to 

the northwest beyond the stripped area.   

Within Trench 3, gold grades from sampling report more erratic and lower grade values in comparison to 

Trenches 1 and 2, however, the channel sampling in Traverse 8 listed in Table 9-9 indicates that good 

gold grades in veining continues down-dip to the northeast in the vicinity of the main ramp and is worthy 

of continued investigation.   

Sampling results from Trench 4 (D-Vein) found that the auriferous vein system is different from No. 1 

Vein, dipping at approximately 40-45° to the south southeast, and possibly cut-off along strike to the east 

northeast; but reported high-grade gold values in Traverses 9 and 10 in Table 9-11 show it remains open 

down-dip and along strike to the west southwest where the vein system becomes covered by overburden 

and swamp.   

The open vein systems within the 4 trenches represent excellent exploration targets for defining additional 

near surface gold mineralized material to be tested by additional trenching and drilling as outlined and 

recommended in Section 18.  

It should be noted that in drill hole MG14-14 collared 15 m north of Trench 2, the Vein #1 zone was 

logged between 2.57 m and 3.80 m vertical depth and reported an intersection of 8.3 g/t Au over 1.0 m 

between 3.0 m and 4.0 m. This shallow intercept along with intercepts reported in drill hole MG14-02 of 

5.26 g/t Au over 7.95 m between 49.70 m and 57.65 m is strongly suggestive that the Vein #1 zone 

thickens down dip to the north where it is laterally extensive and remains open in all directions.  This is 

consistent with the positive results from the sampling of the hanging wall mineralization in Trench 2.

It is also noted that from the 2015 mapping program and sampling of pits and trenches, it is suggested 

that there is a similar potential for the discovery of additional shallow quartz-carbonate vein mineralization 

to the north and west of the Planet Syenite which are associated with northwest and northeast-trending 

structures in that area.  A series of historical pits and trenches along a northeast-trending shear/fault on 

the north side of the Planet Syenite were sampled and most samples returned >0.1 g/t Au with a high of 

4.29 g/t Au.   This shear/fault structures appear to be part of the same structural event that produced the 

east- and northeast-trending structures that host the gold mineralized veins south of the Allied Syenite. 

There are also a series of historical trenches and pits along the northwest-trending structure located west 

of the Planet Syenite, and about half of the samples from this structure returned >0.1 g/t Au with the best 

sample returning 43.7 g/t Au. There is no indication that either of these structures have been tested by 

diamond drilling. 

17.3 Conclusions 

The suggestion in this and previous reports (Boyd and Selway 2015, Hart 2015, Boyd 2017) that the 

Miller Gold Property hosts a large scale hydrothermal gold system is supported from research findings 

presented in the MSc Thesis of Luis Arteaga (Arteaga 2018) which outlines indications of multi-stage and 

long-lived magmatic gold deposition associated with large scale intense metasomatism, pervasive 

alteration and episyenitization of the named syenite intrusions.  Geochronological Re/Os and U/Pb age 

dating has found the mineralization is associated with the Temiskaming magmatic event (2680 to 2660 

Ma) contemporaneously with the age of gold deposits along the Kirkland Lake Main Break. This is 

consistent with the Au-Ag-Bi-Cu-Mo-Te signature of the gold mineralization on the Property similar to that 

of some gold deposits in Kirkland Lake Camp. Evidence indicates that the Miller gold deposits and the 

Kirkland Lake gold deposits were formed contemporaneously and derived from a common gold enriched 

magmatic hydrothermal reservoir at depth.  The Catharine Fault Zone which crosscuts the Miller Gold 

Property is interpreted as a broad composite "first order structure" capable of channelling deep seated 

exsolved magmatic hydrothermal fluids into favourable sites of gold deposition, namely intrusive contacts 

and cross cutting second order structures.  In conclusion, there is potential for the discovery and outline 

of a large gold resource on the Property beyond the scope of the high grade, but narrow quartz vein 

mineralization historically exploited to-date.  

In general, the exploration of the Miller Gold Property has been conducted in accordance with best 

practices with NI 43-101 with no material errors in procedures on the part of Northstar Gold or Oban 

Mining or significant deficiencies in the integrity of the results. The results from the 2014 and 2015 drill 

programs are of good quality and adequate for the purpose of their utilization in any subsequent resource 

estimations.  It is cautioned that the gold distribution in the mineralized zones is highly erratic due to its

nuggety character, coarse texture, and variable mineralogy occurring commonly as native gold and 

tellurides.  This has resulted to-date in analytical problems that are described in this Report.  It is the 

opinion of the authors of this Technical Report that the work completed to-date by Northstar has returned 

sufficient positive results to justify an enlarged follow-up exploration program consisting mostly of 

diamond drilling with the purpose of defining a mineral resource. The Qualified Person is not aware of 

significant risks and uncertainties that could reasonably be expected to affect the reliability or confidence 

in the exploration information other than the one stated above. These risks can be managed and may not 

have an impact on the project's potential economic viability. 

18.0  RECOMMENDATIONS 

Based upon exploration results to-date, follow-up exploration of the Property is strongly recommended.  

The encouragingly positive results from the bulk and surface sampling program support a follow-up 

program of core and reject re-sampling and analysis, drill hole modelling, extension of the 2014 IP / 

resistivity survey and closely-spaced shallow diamond drilling.  Additional stripping, trenching, detailed 

surface mapping and bulk sampling is also recommended for the Miller Gold Property.   

Phase 1 

• In the short term, the purpose of the recommended program is to aid in identifying additional 

promising areas where quartz veining shallows or flares up "blow outs" to the near or at surface 

similar to Trench 1.  Three-dimensional exploration geology modeling of the central mineralized area 

including the Allied Syenite and southward to the Trench 1 area should be completed.  Follow-up 

exploration priority should be directed in the vicinity of the Trenches 1 to 4 extending northwards 

towards the Allied Syenite focusing on the delineation of open volumes of near surface vein-hosted, 

high-grade, gold mineralization preferably accessible by open pit mining techniques.   

• As an immediate priority, it is important that drill logs and core from the drilling programs of 2014 

and 2015 be re-examined, and selected core samples be re-sampled and re-analyzed using a similar 

methodology as outlined in Section 11 prior to choosing targets for follow-up diamond drilling, 

trenching and surface sampling, and modelling work.  Attention should be paid to those samples 

from previous drill core sections that were logged as appearing to be situated within interpreted 

mineralized zones, where values of <10 g/t Au where reported, and that did not undergo metallic 

screen analysis from at least a 1,000 g prepared pulp sample.  Based upon the results in this 

program, it is believed the erratic reported gold results from previous exploration of the property and

difficulties in consistently following mineralized zones may be at least partially due to the failure of 

previous analyses to consistently account for the all the coarse gold in the samples. 

• A program of shallow exploratory diamond drilling, trenching and channel sampling should be 

completed on the Allied, Planet and Meilleur syenites to better expose the intrusive bodies and 

auriferous quartz veins. This program should include locations within the intrusions and across the 

regional structures that host gold mineralization, including the northwest-trending zone along the 

east side of the Allied Syenite and the northeast-trending zone along the north side of the Planet 

Syenite, to better assess the relationship between the intrusions and the structures which appear to 

control the auriferous quartz veins. This drilling, trenching and channel sampling program should 

also examine the mineralized quartz veins located to the south of the Allied Syenite hosted by a 

similar set of structures associated with those in the intrusion. 

• Integrative with the drill core re-evaluation, the author recommends the re-evaluation and 

possible re-processing of the 2014 IP survey data combined with additional deposit modelling based 

upon the improved geological understanding gained from the 2014 and 2015 drilling programs and 

exploration with the purpose of identifying additional near-surface high resistivity and chargeability 

targets and more specifically to better define the trend and depth of the No. 1 Vein north of Trench 1.  

It is also recommended to expand the 3D IP coverage to the west of the D Zone and to the north half 

of the Miller Gold Property. The geophysical data should be interpreted in a geological context such 

that drill targets can be generated. The gold bearing structures identified in surface mapping need to 

be included in the geological / geophysical model.   

• Attention should be paid to the structural geology of selected locations over the Allied, Planet and 

Meilleur syenites in follow-up to both historic and 2014 and 2015 drilling with a focus on assessing 

northeast and west northwest trending shear structures along the north contact and centre of the 

Planet Syenite.  It is recommended that attention also be paid to the east side of the Allied and west 

side of the Planet syenites at the projected intersection of these shear structures, and at depth where 

possible intersections, bends, fault jogs or intrusive contacts of No. 1 Vein and D-Vein may result in 

thickening of the high grade Au zones.  

Phase 2 

• It is recommended that Northstar, based upon the findings from the aforementioned 

recommendations and contingent on positive results from Phase 1 exploration, follow with a tightly 

spaced definition drilling program on the No. 1 Vein, Allied Syenite and D zones. The focus of the

program will be on target areas generated from the interpretation of the aforementioned IP work and 

drill core and surface re-evaluation including where the No. 1 Vein Zone attains a minimum width of 

1.0 m as observed in drill holes MG14-02 and MG14-14 and MG14-07 (3.25 g/t Au over 14.03 m 

from 105.47 to 119.5 m) and MG14-12 (11.62 g/t Au over 3.95 m from 138.05 to 142.0 m) in the 

vicinity of the Allied Syenite.  Follow up drilling is also recommended on the new discovery in drill 

holes MG15-18 (19.25 g/t Au over 0.3 m from 255.7 m to 256.0 m) and MG15-20 (14.1 g/t Au over 

3.05 m from 311.85 to 314.9 m) which may represent a parallel gold bearing structure 100 m below 

the Vein 1 zone.   It is recommended that during the next drill program Specific Gravity 

measurements be completed on every 10
th
 sample chosen for analysis. 

• This fieldwork should be followed by detailed deposit modelling of the results in preparation for a 

resource estimation that follows the standards of the National Instrument 43-101.  

The results of the drilling and re-evaluation work programs should also aid Northstar Gold to choose 

prospective surface locations for additional enlarged bulk sampling.   A proposed budget for exploration 

and development is outlined in Table 18-1.
