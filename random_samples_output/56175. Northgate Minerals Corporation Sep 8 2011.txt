1 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 

This report provides a preliminary economic assessment of the Kemess Underground Project (the 
"Project"). The report is intended to enable Northgate Minerals Corporation ("Northgate") owners 
of the property, to make decisions relating to the need for and the nature of further work on the 
Project. 

The Project envisages mining the Kemess underground mineral resource (part of the Kemess 
North deposit) by a block/panel caving method. 

The mineral resource lies approximately 5 km to the north of the existing Kemess South open pit 
and mill complex. Mining of the South pit is now complete and activities at the site are currently 
focused on remediation and reclamation work. Should the Project proceed, it is envisaged that the 
existing mill and site infrastructure will be retained on care and maintenance for later use as part 
of the Project. 

All monetary values shown in the report are Canadian Dollars unless otherwise stated. 

1.2 Mineral Resources 

The Kemess underground mineral resource estimate is shown in Table 1.1. The mineral 
resources are contained within a portion of the resource block model judged to be potentially 
minable by block caving.

1.3 Mine Design 

The mine design prepared for the preliminary appraisal envisages an eight million tonne per 
annum, highly automated, trackless, block caving operation similar to Northparkes and Ridgeway 
mines in Australia, the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, and the Palabora mine in South Africa.  

Based on an analysis of the geometry and grade distribution in the deposit, a single extraction 
level with a footprint of approximately 125,000 m2 has been selected for the preliminary 
evaluation. The footprint has been selected by comparing the value of the resource overlying the 
footprint with the cost of developing the necessary drawpoints and undercut. The process 
identified a total minable tonnage of approximately 88 Mt above a Net Smelter Return ("NSR") 
shut-off value of $14.00. The minable tonnage originates almost entirely from Indicated Mineral 
Resources. 

Analysis of the geotechnical data obtained during a drilling program carried out in 2010 indicates 
that the rock mass is likely to cave when the hydraulic radius of the undercut approaches 39 m. 
This is significantly less than the hydraulic radius of the undercut design (89 m). 

Preliminary assessment indicates that initially, fragmentation will be coarse, with some 48% of 
rock produced having a size greater than 2 m3 (the common measure used to assess block cave 
fragmentation). Fragmentation will become finer as the cave matures. Practical and efficient 
methods of secondary breaking in drawpoints and grizzlies will be required. By comparison, 
fragmentation estimates made at the feasibility study stage for the Palabora mine, where coarse 
fragmentation has been recognized as presenting production challenges, were over 75% greater 
than 2 m3. 

The mine design envisages ore from drawpoints being transferred to ore passes using electric 
powered scoops. Diesel powered trucks operating on a transfer level below the extraction level 
will transfer ore to a primary crusher. Crushed ore will then be conveyed out of the mine to the 
surface portal in a single lift and then transferred to an overland conveyor system for delivery to 
the existing crushed ore stockpile ahead of the Kemess South mill. 

Access to the mine will be via a drift driven at a gradient of approximately 1 in 9 running parallel to 
the conveyor drift. The twin drifts will be used as intake and return airways. Intake and return 
ventilation shafts positioned close to the deposit will provide additional airflow to the mine 
workings. 

1.4 Mineral Processing 

Metallurgical test-work is currently being carried out on samples from drill core recovered during 
the 2010 drilling program. The preliminary results from this work combined with the results of a 
significant body of work carried out during the previous feasibility study on the Kemess North 
open pit project indicate the ability to produce a saleable copper concentrate similar to that 
previously produced from the Kemess South mine. The test-work indicates the ability to achieve 
copper and gold recoveries of 91% and 72% respectively at a concentrate grade of 22% copper. 

The Kemess South mill had a capacity of approximately 52,000 t/d using twin milling and flotation 
circuits. It is envisaged that only one circuit will be required to process ore from the Project, and 
that only minor modifications and upgrades to the circuit and the existing infrastructure will be 
required.

1.6 Conclusions and Recommendations 

The preliminary economic assessment indicates that the Project has the potential to be developed 
into an economically viable mining and processing operation. However, the success of the Project 
will depend heavily on realizable copper and gold prices. 

Block/panel caving is the only underground mining method with the potential to economically mine 
the deposit. Although there is a higher grade zone within the deposit, the tonnage and grade of 
this zone is insufficient to cover the higher mining, processing, and overhead costs associated 
with more selective mining methods.

The mining outline prepared for this preliminary economic assessment is based on a selection of 
block cave draw columns that return a positive value net of all costs. Higher metal prices than 
those used in the study would result in the mining outline expanding to the south and east into 
areas of lower grade mineralization. The potential to enlarge the mining outline and increase the 
minable tonnage could extend the life of the Project, albeit at declining ore grades. 

The general location of the proposed portal, main access drifts, and surface conveyor alignment 
results in less environmental impact than alternative locations considered. Despite the longer 
decline length required to access the deposit, the vertical lift is less, as is the overland conveyor 
length compared to other options. In AMC's opinion the proposed portal location and ore 
transportation system provide the most suitable arrangements for the Project. 

In AMC's opinion further work is justified to advance the Project to pre-feasibility and feasibility 
stages. In any new block caving operation there is uncertainty regarding the rate and uniformity of 
cave progression, fragmentation, the effects of stress redistribution on development, and the 
mechanisms of material mixing in the cave. These uncertainties can be reduced, but not 
eliminated, by further pre-development investigation and analysis. In new block cave mines, a 
decision to develop the Project, or not, inevitably needs to be made while significant technical 
uncertainties remain.

2 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

2.1 Purpose of this Report 

The purpose of this report is to provide Northgate Minerals Corporation ("Northgate") with a 
preliminary economic assessment of the Project. The report is intended to enable Northgate to 
make decisions relating to the need for and the nature of further work on the Project. 

2.2 Terms of Reference 

Northgate has commissioned AMC Mining Consultants (Canada) Pty Ltd ("AMC") to carry out a 
study on the Project as a basis for a Technical Report complying with Canadian National 
Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") and Form 43-101F1. 

AMC's study includes: 

• An analysis of geotechnical data collected from drill hole logs.  

• Mine design work based on a mineral resource model and geological information prepared 
by Northgate. The study focuses on the selection and concept design of a preferred mining 
method. 

• Various engineering studies relating to materials handling, mineral processing and project 
infrastructure. These studies focus on identifying the most suitable method of transferring 
ore from the deposit to the existing Kemess mill and the modifications to the mill necessary 
to treat ore from the deposit. 

• Estimation of the expenditure required to develop and mine the deposit, and the revenue 
generated by the Project.  

• The assimilation and presentation of other information relevant to the economic 
assessment of the Project and the requirements of NI 43-101.  

AMC worked closely with Northgate personnel during the study to make best use of their 
accumulated experience and knowledge of the deposit and the existing Kemess South operation. 
AMC also worked closely with a number of subconsultants who have been involved in previous 
studies related to the Kemess property. 

The economic model prepared for the preliminary economic assessment is based on metal prices 
and off-site cost assumptions advised by Northgate. AMC has reviewed these prices and 
assumptions, and is satisfied as to their reasonableness. The accuracy of the study estimates and 
the inputs to the preliminary economic assessment are consistent with a study to be used as a 
basis for making a commitment for funding further exploration and evaluation studies, where the 
investment risk is relatively small.

Figure 4.1 Location of the Kemess Property 

 



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 11 

4.3 Description 

The property is host to the Kemess South (mined out) and the Kemess North deposits. The 
Kemess Underground deposit is a higher grade portion of the Kemess North deposit that lies 
towards the base and to the east of the main body of mineralization. 

The Kemess South deposit has been mined by a large open pit feeding copper-gold ore to a  
52,000 t/day concentrator. Open pit mining ceased in February 2011 on depletion of the mineral 
reserves. The concentrator, fixed plant and other equipment that may potentially be used to 
support a mining operation at Kemess Underground or at other deposits in the area is currently on 
care and maintenance. 

4.4 Mining Lease 

The Kemess property includes one active mining lease (354991) covering the Kemess South 
deposit, one mining lease (524240) covering the tailings dam infrastructure, and two inactive 
mining leases (410732 and 410741). The mining leases are surrounded by 206 contiguous 
mineral claims. 

Legal surveys have been completed for mining leases 354991, 410732 and 410741, of which the 
latter two cover the Kemess North deposit. The location of Kemess deposits and the existing 
concentrator within the Mining Leases is shown in Figure 4.2.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Access 

All season road access to the Kemess property is via the Omineca resource access road from 
either the town of Mackenzie, or from Fort St James. Operations at Kemess South were serviced 
by scheduled year-round flights from surrounding communities and Vancouver. 

The Kemess Underground deposit lies approximately 5 km to the north of the existing Kemess 
concentrator and accommodation camp. The deposit is located beneath two north facing alpine 
cirques with ground surface elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 m, all above tree line. A 
natural rock glacier is evident in the western cirque. Access to the area overlying the deposit is 
currently limited to summer months only, although helicopter access is possible during winter. The 
processing plant and accommodation camp are located at an elevation of approximately 1,200 m 
and are accessible all year round. 

Below the tree line, broad, open, drift and moraine covered valleys characterizes the area. These 
areas are moderately vegetated with spruce-willow-birch forest, while poorly drained areas form 
peat bogs populated by alder brush, willow, and stunted spruce trees. 

5.2 Climate 

The climate is generally moderate, although snow can occur during any month. Temperatures 
range from -35°C to 30°C and average annual precipitation amounts to 890 mm. Extreme 
weather conditions are possible at the higher elevations.  

5.3 Infrastructure 

Existing onsite infrastructure consists of offices, maintenance facilities, a 400-person 
accommodation camp, mill, crushers and raw ore stockpile areas, access and service roads, 
airstrip, explosives depot, and tailings storage facilities. 

The Kemess South mine operated on a fly-in fly-out basis with the majority of employees working 
two-weeks-on, two-weeks-off cycles, commuting from regional centres and Vancouver.  
The airstrip can accommodate most STOL aircraft types. Hercules aircraft have occasionally used 
the airstrip for heavy lifts.  

A privately owned, 380 km power line originating in Mackenzie, provides power to the mine area 
via the BC Hydro grid. 

Process water is reclaimed from the tailings facility and from the Kemess South open pit.  
Potable water is sourced from permitted wells and treated through an onsite water treatment 
plant.  

Northgate currently proposes to maintain the mill and infrastructure facilities on care and 
maintenance pending decisions regarding the Kemess Underground deposit and other potential 
projects in the area.

6 HISTORY 

6.1 Kemess South 

History records earlier discoveries in the Kemess North area. However, the first exploitable open 
pit deposit was outlined for the Kemess South deposit. Royal Oak Mines Inc. ("Royal Oak") then 
owners of the property, commenced operations from the Kemess South deposit in 1998. The 
operation went into receivership in 1999 and in 2000 Northgate Exploration bought the property 
out of receivership. 

Historical production from Kemess South since the original start-up is shown in Table 6.1. 
Production has ceased and work is now focused on reclamation and site rehabilitation.

Authorities that included a mineral resource statement for the deposit. 

 



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 16 

In June 2004, following further drilling, Northgate published a revised mineral resource estimate, 
which formed the basis of a pre-feasibility study. 

In January 2005, Northgate completed the Kemess North Feasibility Study together with updated 
mineral reserve and resource estimates. The feasibility study envisaged a large open pit mining 
operation with tailings from an expanded milling operation deposited in the nearby Amazay Lake 
(Duncan Lake). The project involved mining and milling approximately 424 Mt of ore and stripping 
approximately 318 Mt of waste. 

In May 2005 Northgate filed a NI 43-101 Technical Report titled "Revised Mineral Reserve and 
Resource Kemess North Project". However, Northgate subsequently was unable to obtain 
regulatory approval to develop the deposit in the manner envisaged in the feasibility study and the 
deposit remains undeveloped. 

In May 2010, AMC completed a review of the deposit. The review concluded that despite the 
need for more reliable base data, there is clearly a high-grade zone in the eastern part of the 
Kemess North deposit (Kemess Underground) that has the potential to be mined by block caving 
methods. The study considered that an annual production rate of approximately 8 Mtpa should be 
possible. Ore would be conveyed out of the mine via an inclined drift and then transferred to the 
existing Kemess concentrator by either truck haulage or conveyor. 

Following the review, Northgate completed an infill drilling program during the summer of 2010 
targeting the potential mining area. Results from the 2010 drilling program, together with the 
results from earlier drilling, provided input to a mineral resource estimate released by Northgate in 
February 2011.  

The 2010 drilling program included a number of holes drilled specifically to gather geotechnical 
data. All drill core recovered from the drilling program was subjected to detailed geotechnical 
logging. The 2010 drilling program also provided samples for a metallurgical test-work program.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 Regional Geology 

Kemess occurs at the southern end of the Toodoggone mining camp, which describes a collection 
of occurrences and deposits found in Mesozoic volcanic rocks. The area is known for its  
Cu-Au porphyry deposits and low sulphidation epithermal Au-Ag vein deposits. 

The oldest rocks in the belt are Permian marine and volcanic rocks, which are disconformably 
overlain by basalt dominated volcanic rocks of the middle Triassic Takla Group, which are in turn 
unconformably overlain by lower-middle Jurassic Hazelton Group volcanic rocks.  

Intrusive rocks are prevalent in the area and have been categorized as late Triassic Alaskan-type 
ultramafics such as pyroxene diorite, hornblende gabbro and pyroxenite. Economically more 
significant are the early Jurassic intrusives of the Black Lake suite, which are granodiorite, 
hornblende diorite, pyroxene quartz-diorite, quartz-monzonite and quartz monzodiorite. 

7.2 Structural Setting 

The Mesozoic volcanic assemblages form upright, shallowly dipping to flat-lying sequences 
crosscut by high angle north to northwest trending faults. Significant dextral strike-slip features 
bound the eastern margin of the belt. 

More local to Kemess North are north-northwest normal block fault structures. Thrust faulting is 
present in the district and is interpreted as Eocene or younger. 

The district represents the results of three superimposed volcanic arc building stages that began 
in the upper Paleozoic. Marine volcanic and sedimentary successions dominated until the  
lower-middle Jurassic, when continental, quartz-normative volcanism began with the deposition of 
the Hazelton Group-Toodoggone Formation sequences. The plutonic rocks of the Black Lake 
suite are coeval with the Toodoggone sequence and are likely co-magmatic. Block faulting has 
juxtaposed panels of varying depth into the magmatic and volcanic systems. 

The Kemess North area is underlain by upper Triassic (Takla Group) andesite/basaltic volcanics 
and to a lesser extent lower Jurassic (Toodoggone Formation) dacitic fragmental volcanics.  
Stocks, dykes and possible sills of quartz monzonite/quartz diorite composition have intruded the 
Takla succession and are also lower Jurassic in age. The deposit area is transected by steeply 
dipping north to northwest trending normal faults. A laterally extensive, shallow dipping to flat 
lying, highly fractured and altered broken zone occurs at or close to surface in the area of the 
deposit. Figure 7.1 shows the district geology, major intrusive masses, and disposition of the 
district's deposits.

7.3 Property Geology 

The property is predominantly underlain by a thick (>1,000 m) succession of andesitic flows 
(Takla Group). The Takla volcanic rocks host a significant portion of the copper-gold 
mineralization and display phyllic alteration at Kemess North. On surface is a distinctive feldspar 
porphyritic unit ("bladed feldpsar porphyry – BFP). Mantling the northern and eastern limits of the 
Kemess North area is the Hazelton Group-Toodoggone Formation. The structurally controlled 
phyllic sections of this polylithic fragmental dacite in the south-eastern area of the deposit can 
carry anomalous gold concentrations. The evidence suggests that basement structures and 
conduits that allowed extrusion of the local Toodoggone volcanic assemblage underlie the 
Kemess North area. 

The Kemess North pluton beneath East Cirque hosts the bulk of the copper-gold mineralization 
for the Kemess Underground Project. To remain consistent with earlier work, the field-term 
monzodiorite and quartz monzonite has been retained; however petrographic work shows that the 
mineralized granitoid underlying East Cirque is more correctly classified as a quartz diorite due to 
the paucity (< 5% to absent) of alkali feldspars. 

In the 2010 drilling another phase of the Black Lake intrusive suite was identified in the Kemess 
North area. Pre-mineral sills and dykes of hornblende porphyritic diorite are prevalent in the 
altered Takla volcanic rocks that overlie the Kemess North pluton.  

Post-mineral dykes, including feldspar porphyry and minor mafic varieties, crosscut the Takla 
volcanics and outcrop locally in cirque highwalls and along ridges. The feldspar porphyry dykes 
also crosscut the Jurassic-Toodoggone fragmental unit. Due to the pink colour of the feldspars, 
these dykes take the field term syenite and are generally barren and unaltered.  

7.4 Faults 

The most prominent structure traversing the Kemess Underground Project area is the Kemess 
North ("KN") Fault, an east-west trending south dipping reverse fault that truncates the Kemess 
North pluton and associated mineralization at depth. The KN Fault is complex in that there is a 
related north dipping secondary structure that demonstrates apparent normal offset with at least 
1,000 m of southside up apparent displacement. At least three steeply dipping, northwest trending 
normal faults have been inferred from surface mapping and drilling to transect the Kemess North 
property. Fault spacing ranges from 500 to 1,500 m. 

7.5 Alteration 

A near surface flat-lying zone of intensely broken rock and rubble, historically referred to as the 
Broken Zone, occurs above the deposit. This zone is better described as the Sulfate Leach Zone, 
which more accurately describes the mineral transitions that have occurred, resulting in poor 
drilling conditions. The zone averages about 80 m from surface to competent bedrock and is 
comprised of clay, multiple gouge zones and a pyritic-argillic (clay) alteration component. 

The key difference between this alteration unit and those beneath is that there is a distinct ICP 
detectable calcium depletion which is directly related to the complete absence of any sulfate 
minerals (gypsum) above this interface. The interface between the Sulfate Leach Zone and the 
underlying competent Phyllic alteration is generally sharp. The post-mineral porphyritic feldspar 
dykes remain unaltered and competent within the Sulfate Leach Zone, indicating that it is a 
feature related to a Jurassic weathering process as opposed to a present day feature. 

The Phyllic Zone underlies the Sulfate Leach Zone and is dominated by very fine grained  
quartz-sericite-chlorite-pyrite alteration, which is usually pervasive in the upper sector and 



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project

accompanied by abundant gypsum-pyrite veins. Pyrite contents rise with depth, peaking in the 12 
– 15% range and then reducing to 3 – 4%. The base of the Phyllic Zone is easily defined as the 
area where quartz replaces sulfate as the main vein component in the porphyry mineralization.  

The Potassic Zone encompasses the deeper volume of rock mantling the Kemess North pluton.  

7.6 Mineralization 

Gold-copper mineralization forms an inclined tabular zone that is centred on the East Cirque 
porphyritic monzodiorite, which from structural contours, strikes east-west and dips 20° to the 
south. The quartz diorite/quartz monzonite intrusive exhibits an irregular upper contact with 
various peaks and troughs. The general east west strike and shallow south dip geometry is 
consistent for over 400 m (10660E to 10180E). Between 10260E and 10160E the tabular 
morphology disappears and the monzonite occurs as wide dykes (10 m to 100 m) within Takla 
volcanics. The change in geometry for the monzonite could be due to the effects of cross-faulting 
that have down-dropped the tabular upper contact present in East Cirque, or the rheologic 
conditions during intrusion changed going towards the west whereby steep fracture infilling was 
preferred over stopping. 

Alteration and mineralization is associated with, and zoned both vertically and laterally from the 
quartz diorite/quartz monzonite intrusive and its associated dykes intersected at depth beneath 
the Central and East Cirques. Figure 7.2 shows mapping of surface alteration in the deposit area. 

The highest-grade copper-gold zones occur focused on the quartz monzonite – Takla volcanic 
contact associated with quartz-magnetite veining and overprinting pyrite-chalcopyrite veining.  
The zone comprises 50 – 60% fine-grained quartz, 20 – 30% magnetite, 5 – 10% pyrite, 1% 
chalcopyrite, with accessory hematite and gypsum occurring over widths from less than 10 m to 
greater than 150 m. Styles of quartz infill range from high-density parallel quartz veining to 
pervasive silicification with magnetite. This zone occurs mostly within the quartz monzonite stock 
and to a lesser extent within the andesite adjacent to the intrusive stock. The protolith is 
commonly completely replaced. The quartz monzonite/quartz diorite stock and associated quartz-
magnetite zone is interpreted as the heat source driving the porphyry copper-gold system at 
Kemess North. 

Grading outwards from the East Cirque stock into the Takla volcanics, silicification decreases 
gradually to fine-grained assemblages of chlorite-biotite-sericite, which volumetrically constitutes 
the bulk of the mineralization. This assemblage of chlorite-biotite+k-feldspar forms the Potassic 
Zone described earlier. 

Sericitization commonly from the destruction of matrix and phenocryst plagioclase and mafic 
minerals is pervasive in the upper Takla volcanic rocks. Accompanying sericitization are 
assemblages of quartz-gypsum-carbonate-magnetite veinlets with disseminated pyrite-
chalcopyrite mineralization. This alteration assemblage is interpreted as the Phyllic Zone.

Figure 7.2 Surface Alteration Mapping at Kemess North by McKinley 2006  

 

The Sulfate Leach Zone, which consists mostly of iron oxides, sericite-chlorite-quartz-pyrite forms 
an extensive broken zone beneath bright orange-red outcrops at surface (hematite-limonite; 
McKinley 2006). Pyrite is common throughout (5 – 7%) as both disseminated and within vuggy 
quartz veining. This alteration zone is mostly barren of any significant copper and will often show 
a slight increase in Au with depth. The zone is a result of dissolution of the sulfate and carbonate 
minerals by highly acidic ground waters present currently and probably during the Jurassic. 

Present over the entire area in all rock units except the late mafic dykes are barren pinkish 
zeolite-carbonate veins, which post-date and crosscut the above vein types and rock units. The 
zeolite-carbonate veinlets are low temperature phenomena. McKinley in 2006 completed a useful 
paragenetic study of the vein-types which is summarized Figure 7.3. This scheme was adopted 
for the 2010 logging program.

Figure 7.3 Vein Paragenisis at Kemess North (McKinley 2006) 

 

Overall, sulphide mineralization throughout the deposit consists of 2 – 3% pyrite, with lesser 
amounts of chalcopyrite and traces of molybdenum. Pyrite occurs as disseminations, fracture 
fillings, and veins up to a few centimetres wide generally associated with quartz-gypsum-
magnetite veins and zones of quartz-magnetite replacement. The mode of occurrence of 
chalcopyrite is similar except that veinlets are rare and significant disseminations occur in zones 
of stronger quartz-magnetite stock work and quartz-magnetite replacements. Gold and copper 
grades variably diminish outward into the hanging wall and footwall. Total sulphide content in the 
core of the deposit averages 3 – 5%, rising to 10 – 12% in the phyllic halo. 

Petrography shows a varying degree of accessory minerals throughout all rock types and 
alteration zones including; rutile, leucoxene, sphene, anhydrite, gypsum, epidote, zeolite, alunite, 
molybdenite, phlogopite, prehnite, apatite.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

8.1 Deposit Type 

Kemess North is a large copper-gold porphyry deposit and is typical of calc-alkaline porphyry 
copper-gold deposits in the western cordillera. The deposit has a low-grade ore zone at a depth of 
150 m below the surface on its western flank and a higher grade zone 300 m to 550 m below 
surface on the eastern side, which forms the Kemess Underground Project. Kemess North is 
hosted by potassic-altered Takla Group volcanic rocks and Black Lake plutonic rocks. The deposit 
is centered on a mineralized porphyritic monzodiorite/diorite pluton and associated WSW trending 
dykes, which extend to the south-west. Higher-grade copper-gold mineralization is characterized 
by secondary biotite in volcanic and the eastern plutonic host rocks. 

Porphyry style copper-gold mineralization occurs within the Takla volcanic rocks and intermediate 
intrusive rocks associated with weak to pervasive propyllitic, phyllic, and potassic (biotitic) 
alteration assemblages. The latter is associated with better copper and gold grades. Alteration of 
Toodoggone assemblages ranges from fresh to weak propyllitic and is generally barren of 
significant sulphides and ore grade mineralization.

9 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Exploration 

The Kemess North property represents an advanced project that has previously been through 
feasibility studies during its consideration as an open pit project, it was only in 2010, that detailed 
review as an underground project began.  

The early exploration work in the area identified a porphyry target, but it wasn't until deep drilling 
in 2001 that significant gold and copper grades were located. Since 2001, exploration has been 
directed at expanding the resource base in what was historically viewed as an open pit project. 
Table 9.1 outlines the number of holes drilled in the greater Kemess North area since 2001. 

Table 9.1 Drill Campaign Statistics at Kemess North

1975 5 589 2002 59 33,338 
1976 8 1,477 2003 53 20,479 
1989 5 732 2004 23 7,125

1991 27 7,059 2006 17 8,632 
1992 25 4,520 2007 27 17,713 
2000 12 4,269 2010 30 16,439 
2001 16 8,386 Total 331 140,933 

Because the target is deep, geological mapping and geochemical techniques add little value. 
Likewise, surface and airborne geophysical exploration have contributed little. Since the last work 
by El Condor in 1992, there has been no surface soil or rock sampling or trenching at Kemess 
North. Surface work has been confined to access road and drill site construction. A regional 
airborne geophysical program completed in 2003 added to the understanding of the volcanic and 
intrusive events in the area. The program had little impact on the resource estimate for the 
Kemess North Project. 

The procedures followed in the field and through the interpretation stage of exploration have been 
professional. Various crews under the supervision of professional geologists carried out the 
exploration work (see Table 9.2). From 2001 to the present day, there has been continuity in 
personnel both in the field, in the laboratories and with the data interpretation.

10 DRILLING 

10.1 Drilling 

Since May 2000, there have been nine summer drill programs completed in the Kemess North 
area. Various diamond drilling contractors based out of Smithers, BC completed this work.  
At peak activity up to four drill rigs were used on the property, three on skids and one helicopter 
portable. Two Driftwood diamond drills completed the most recent program in 2010 which 
accounted for 30 drill holes and 16,439 m. 

The Kemess Underground Project area is approximately 1,050 m in an east-west direction and  
610 m north-south and over 600 m vertical. For the most part, the drill hole spacing is less than 
100 m and now well covered with the additional 2010 holes. 

The current database contains 146 drill holes for a total of 67,157 m and an average length of  
460 m, with the majority in the 200 m to 600 m range. There are a few short holes less than 100 
m, while the deepest hole is 1,206 m. 

The "Broken Zone", which presents challenging drilling conditions, covers much of the property. 
Historically, drilling an HQ diameter hole (64 mm core) to act as casing for NQ (48 mm core), 
which usually was used to complete the hole, solved the problem. In rare instances reduction to  
BQ (37 mm core) was necessary to reach target depth. The core recovery is very high with an 
average of ~70% in the Broken Zone and approximately 100% in the remainder. 

In 2004, a test was conducted to compare assay results from holes with steep angles to holes 
with shallow angles. At that time, 29 holes were drilled at shallow angles (less than minus 60º) so 
that oriented core could be obtained to assist with the geotechnical program. It was found that 
there is no significant grade variation between the two data sets. Because the shallow angle holes 
tested various different directions, it appears likely that there is no preferred vein orientation in the 
deposit that could be missed with steep drilling. 

10.2 Procedures 

The procedures used to locate exploration drill holes are as follows: the proposed drill site is 
located in the field by a geologist using a hand-held GPS unit, the site is built using an excavator 
and the drill rig is pulled onto the site by a bulldozer and a sump for cuttings is dug. The 
orientation of the drill hole is set by the geologist with a set of pickets to provide the azimuth and 
specify the inclination of the hole. Because of the depth of the mineralization, most of the drill 
holes have been drilled at steep angles, approaching vertical. Exceptions to this rule are holes 
drilled for geotechnical studies. The majority of the 2010 program was drilled on a 255o azimuth 
inclined at 65o. There are 123 holes drilled at dips between 45º and 75º, with various azimuth 
orientations. The remaining 207 holes have been drilled at steep angles, greater than 75º. 

All of the drilling on the property has been continuous core diamond drilling. Because of the 
broken zone at surface, drilling procedures include setting surface casing then drilling with large 
diameter HQ core. Once through the broken zone and into more solid rock, the drillers generally 
reduced to NQ core to complete the hole. Upon completion of the hole, all of the drill pipe is 
removed from the hole, though the surface casing is left to mark the hole location. 

During the 2010 campaign most of the holes were either cemented with coaxial cable along their 
entire length for a cavity monitoring system, or they were cased with plastic pipe to facilitate future 
televiewing systems once underground mining becomes operational. To facilitate the installation 
of both these systems, the HQ drill pipe was left in the ground.

10.2.1 Sample Length/True Thickness 

Sample length was determined by the geology of the deposit and an attempt was made not to 
allow samples to cross lithological boundaries. With NQ size drill core, sample lengths were 
generally  
2 m, while with HQ core, sample lengths were reduced to 1.5 m. The majority of the assay 
intervals, approximately 66%, are 2 m in length, with the remainder mostly less than 2 m.  
The average assay interval is 1.92 m. 

The term "true thickness" is not generally applicable to porphyry deposits as the entire rock mass 
is potentially ore grade material and there is no readily apparent preferred orientation to the 
mineralization. Because of the potential for ore grade material through the entire length of the 
hole, sampling was generally continuous from the top to the bottom. The mineralization is 
generally confined to three main lithologies, hypogene Black Lake pre-mineral monzonite, Takla 
BFP (bladed feldspar porphyry) and Takla volcanics. These lithologies form large massive bodies 
underlying the central and eastern cirques. The mineralization is generally flat lying within the 
various lithologies. The mineralized Takla volcanic and western Black Lake intrusive rocks show 
generally vertical contacts. The higher-grade Kemess North pluton in the East Cirque appears to 
be an inclined tabular body, dipping 20º to the south and truncated to the north by a south dipping 
fault. 

10.2.2 Collar Survey 

Survey control for the drill hole collars was by GPS using a base station that provided real-time 
correction, such that subcentimeter accuracy was achieved. 

10.2.3 Down-Hole Survey 

Differentially corrected GPS has provided survey control for all collars, while a variety of down-
hole survey techniques have been used to estimate the subsurface trajectory of the drill holes.  
The 2010 program relied upon non-magnetic methods such as Flex-It electronic gyro and Deviflex 
to survey the down-hole traces. All 2010 drill holes showed a consistent deviation to the right with 
minor steepening. This result confirmed observations made from high resolution corrected 
magnetic instruments, such as the Flex-It, which was in use from 2003 through to 2008. Pre-2003 
programs were surveyed using Sperry-Sun magnetic based instruments, and many of these holes 
showed anomalous hole traces sometimes increasingly deviating to the left with depth. A total of 
34 holes have been identified with anomalous hole traces, including seven from the post-2002 
period, which are listed in Table 10.1. 

It is considered highly unlikely that the holes had subterranean trajectories that differed 
significantly from the 2010 experience, as people, machinery and equipment specifications are 
very similar to those in use in 2000.

showing the drill hole collars and traces in the Kemess Underground area is shown in Figure 10.1.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Sample Preparation 

Pre-2001 drilling was not deep enough to test the higher-grade zones. Consequently, drilling 
since 2001 is the most important exploration activity carried out at Kemess North, and forms the 
basis of the mineral resource. More that 75% of the assays have been completed since 2001.  

Samples from the Kemess North Project are totally drill core based; there are no trench or grab 
samples in the database. 

Pincock Allan Holt's Vancouver based consulting group developed a sampling program for the 
project prior to the 2002 exploration season. The same program was carried forward to the 2003 
and 2004 seasons and continued into the 2010 program. The QA/QC program established in 
2002 and continued in subsequent seasons included blind duplicate, blank, and standard 
samples. 

Sample intervals were determined by a geologist according to lithology, and ranged from 0.3 to 
2.0 m, with the average length of samples being 1.92 m. Core was split using a diamond saw or a 
hydraulic splitter. Because of the low-grade nature of the mineralization and difficulty determining 
potential ore from non-ore material, the entire drill hole is sampled. Once in a uniform rock type, 
the sample spacing was generally 2.0 m. The maximum 2 m sample length was chosen so that 
more detail could be gained concerning the distribution of grade. As well, the 2 m core length 
provides a representative sample weight for NQ core. For HQ core, a maximum sample length of 
1.5 m was applied. 

Drill core was logged by a small team of geologists and split using a rock saw or hydraulic splitter. 
Samples were then passed through a primary crusher. During the 2002 program, a portable 
sample preparation lab was leased from ALS Chemex. For the 2003 program, a sample-bucking 
facility was built near the camp area and then used during the subsequent programs. 

Crushed core samples were dried, then further crushed to 80% passing 10 mesh at the mine site. 
Each sample was riffled twice with one split being retained at the mine, and a 250 g sample sent 
to the lab. The remainder of the sample was discarded. In 2008 a pulverizer was added to the 
preparation process at Kemess and pulps were submitted for analysis for both 2008 and 2010 
programs. 

11.2 Security 

The portion of sample retained at the mine site was kept in a plastic bag with a sample tag and 
stored in a plastic pail. The portion of the sample sent to the laboratory was placed in a plastic 
bag with a sample tag, shipped in a plastic pail with two security tags and the pail top was sealed 
and taped. A submission sheet was sent along with each pail of samples that included the name 
of the sample preparation person, the date, the sample numbers, the number of samples, and the 
numbers of the security tags. 

The core storage site near Kemess Lake is a well organized facility. The remaining half cores are 
still in core boxes and are available for geology reviews as well as check assays. 

Work completed by Kemess employees included core logging, sample layout, sample splitting 
and preliminary sample preparation. A professional geologist oversaw all of the work from core 
logging to sample splitting, while the Chief Assayer at the mine oversaw the preliminary sample 
preparation and shipping.

11.3 Analysis 

ALS-Chemex Laboratory carried out more than 76% of the total assays for this project. The 
laboratory is widely used by the mining and exploration industry and carries the highest 
certification as registered assayers, including ISO 9002, ISO:9001:2008, and a number of 
facilities have achieved ISO 17025 accreditation for specific procedures. 

Blind duplicate samples were used to monitor and measure precision as well as bias. Blank 
samples represent material with very low concentrations of copper and gold, and were used to 
test for contamination of the samples. Standard samples and assay checks were used to test the 
degree of accuracy. In total, 1,408 samples were sent for quality control purposes as blind 
duplicates, blanks or standards; representing approximately one in every 26 samples, or 3.9% of 
the samples collected between 2002 and 2010. 

It was concluded that results reported by Chemex Labs were within acceptable error limits with 
respect to accuracy. The testing of precision in 2010 results show up to 5% variation for gold and 
2.6% variation for copper; both values indicating precise results. The amount of contamination 
was deemed to be minimal. 

In total, excluding quality control samples, 32,506 samples comprise the entire Kemess 
Underground database. Since 2000, 28,498 samples have been submitted to Chemex for copper 
and gold analyses which represent more than 87% of all the analyses. The copper analyses were 
completed by AAS, following a triple acid digestion. Gold analyses were completed by standard 
one assay ton fire assay (i.e. each sample weighs approximately 30g) with AAS finish. Since 
2003, silver has been analysed for by Chemex's multi-element ICP package. There are 16,016 
silver assays in the Kemess Underground database. 

The remaining 12% of the assay work was carried out by various other labs for the earlier 
exploration companies including Kennco, Getty, Shell Oil, and El Condor. Historical records of the 
sampling, analysis, and security of this earlier work are not available. Most of this work is for 
shallow drilling and is not particularly relevant to the Kemess Underground Project. 

Evaluation of 2002 – 2010 quality control samples indicates that the copper and gold assay 
results for the Kemess North drilling programs are sound and accurate and in the author's opinion 
are therefore suitable for use in resource and reserve estimations.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Introduction 

In late June 2011 Northgate Exploration Group completed a 5% audit of the Kemess 
Underground resource database to verify that analytical results have been entered correctly into 
the drill hole database used to prepare the February 2011 Mineral Resource Estimate. The audit 
process and results are summarized in the following sections. 

12.2 Methods 

Samples were selected for verification by first identifying those samples within the 2011 resource 
solid, and then by flagging 1 in 20 of those analyses for cross reference against their assay 
certificates via sample number. In total, 493 analyses were verified; with 490 analyses verified 
against the original assay certificates and three analyses dating from the 1992 drilling compared 
against the original databases. 

12.3 Results 

With the exception of the following data verification issues copper, gold and silver results have 
been correctly entered. In one instance it was noted that copper analysis below detection limit for 
2001 drilling had a default value that was incorrect (0.002% should have been 0.001% – KN-01-
07 595.6 to 597.6 m) in post-mineral dyke material. The corresponding gold value had been 
entered correctly. 

Further verification shows that many of the 2001 analyses lacked tag numbers in the database, 
resulting from a choice by the project managers at the time. This has been known since 2002, 
and protocol is that when tag information is discovered it is entered and the database updated.  
Investigation of the detection limit issue provided more information regarding the missing tags.  
Importing the remaining tag numbers and comparing against the 2011 resource database yielded 
the following minor items with only two real errors where metal is concerned: 

• One key punch error in drill hole KN-01-10 at 272.28m to 274.00m, sample #13210, 0.182 
should be 0.155% Cu and 0.254 should be 0.215 gpt Au. This error was caused by a carry 
down of the results for #13209 when updating re-logged diorite intervals. The error was 
corrected and is not considered material. 

• There is an interval error in drill hole KN-01-13 at 586.4 m which caused a shuffling down 
by one record (2 m) of nine samples. It appears to have been a compositing artifact or error 
that has escaped detection previously. An artificial, but invalid interval was created resulting 
in moving values a further 2 m down the hole. The error was corrected with no material 
impact as it lies below the mineral resource boundary. 

• Four copper detection limit issues were identified, all in hole KN-01-07, 0.002 corrected to 
0.001 (an additional nine 2001 below detection limit 0.002's in KN-01-07; now corrected). 

• Six gold detection limit differences in hole KN-01-04, 0.003 vs 0.0025 (database is correct). 

• Eleven gold detection limit differences in KN-01-06, 0.003 vs 0.0025 (database is correct). 

12.4 Summary of Verification 

The 5% audit showed no significant errors from the resource area regarding the recording of 
tabulated analytical data. The analytical database for the 2011 resource has been verified and 
can be relied upon for resource estimation.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 History of Metallurgical Investigations on the Kemess North Deposit 

Between June 2001 and May 2003 various metallurgical reports were prepared on the Kemess 
North deposit by Amtel Ltd. In May 2003 a metallurgy report for the Kemess North deposit was 
prepared by Northgate. The report was based on laboratory results reported by Lakefield 
Research Ltd over the period January to May 2003. This report, plus the preceding reports, 
formed the basis of the 2005 Kemess North Feasibility Study. 

In early 2011 Northgate initiated further metallurgical test-work specifically focused on the 
Kemess Underground deposit. The test-work has been carried out at G&T Metallurgical Services 
("G&T"), located in Kamloops, BC and is continuing in parallel with the project evaluation. A 
review of the results from the G&T rougher flotation tests are consistent with the earlier test-work 
and have been included in this review. 

13.2 Metallurgical Samples 

For the 2003 metallurgical test-work program 1,737 samples, considered representative of the 
open pitable portion of the Kemess North deposit, were selected from diamond drill cores. These 
were classified by depth and future mining area and then grouped into four domains. The samples 
from each domain were grouped into "super composites", seven in total. The samples were 
received at Lakefield Research Ltd in December 2002. 

For the 2011 program, which focused on the part of the Kemess North deposit considered 
suitable for underground mining, five mineral types were identified; and the samples were 
collected and composited as shown in Table 13.1.

13.3 Mineralogical Characteristics of the Kemess North Deposit 

The following mineralogical characteristics of the Kemess North deposit were determined during 
the 2003 test-work program. Preliminary results from the 2011 program generally confirm that the 
characteristics also apply to the Kemess Underground mineral resource. The characteristics are 
summarized as follows: 

• The host rock shows some clay and anhydrite formation in the near surface zone, followed 
by chlorite and sericite alteration. With increasing depth, silicification, and the presence of 
quartz predominate. Hematite/magnetite has also been encountered. The ball mill work 
index for the deposit is low compared to the majority of porphyry deposits.

• Pyrite in the deposit is coarse grained and can be liberated by grinding to a P80 of 
150 micron. The pyrite is "clean", i.e. not activated, and can be rejected by conventional 
flotation techniques. Concentration of impurity elements is extremely low. 

• The principal copper mineral, chalcopyrite, occurs in intimate association with pyrite and 
fine rougher concentrate regrinding to ≤ 15 µm is required to produce acceptable liberation 
of chalcopyrite from pyrite. Secondary copper minerals, bornite and chalcocite, occur as 
trace minerals and are not of economic significance. 

• Gold occurs as native gold and electrum. The silver content of electrum ranges from 10% 
to 20%. Approximately 30% of the contained gold with a particle size distribution of 3 to 25 
µm can be liberated by fine grinding. Approximately 30% of the contained gold is contained 
in chalcopyrite. The remaining gold occurs as fine inclusions in pyrite, with a minor fraction 
(10%) embedded in the host rock. 

• The pyrite content of the samples tested averaged 4% compared to 1% for the Kemess 
South ore. Consequently pyrite rejection carries a larger portion of gold to tailings than is 
the case with ore from Kemess South.  

13.4 Ball Mill Work Indices and Specific Gravity Measurements 

The Bond ball mill work index of the composites tested in 2003 averaged 13.8 kWh/t. 

An analysis of the actual mill operating data when processing different ore types from Kemess 
South indicates that the specific grinding energy has increased as the pit has deepened. 

Based on the results of the 2003 test-work and actual measurements of the work index for the 
lower and middle ore zones at Kemess South, the Bond ball mill work index for Kemess 
Underground Project is estimated at 14.2 kWh/t. 

Specific gravity measurements of representative samples from Kemess North deposit averaged 
2.78 t/m3. 

13.5 Fineness of Grind in Primary and Regrind Circuits 

Primary grinding to a P80 of 150 μm has been found to adequately liberate sulphides to a rougher 
concentrate. This is consistent with experience with ore from Kemess South where the plant 
primary grind size has ranged from a P80 of 130 μm to 180 μm. 

Regrinding of the rougher concentrate is required to adequately separate chalcopyrite and gold 
from pyrite to produce a copper concentrate of acceptable grade. Results from the 2003 test-work 
program indicate that concentrate grades rise as grind size reduces, while metal losses in cleaner 
flotation worsen only slightly within the range of the re-grinds tested. Copper concentrate grades 
increased in similar proportion for all samples tested with fine grinding of rougher concentrates. 
Typical results from the test-work are shown in Table 13.2.

For the purpose of the preliminary economic assessment it has been assumed, based on the test-
work results, that regrinding to a P80 within the range 12 to 15 µm will be required. 

13.6 Flotation Test-Work Results 

Locked cycle tests carried out in 2003 on the seven super composites from Kemess North 
resulted in the metal recovery and concentrate grade estimates shown in Table 13.3. The 
estimates for the Lower Zone Ore are considered more relevant to the Kemess Underground 
deposit.

Preliminary results from 34 flotation tests completed in the ongoing 2011 test-work indicate 
recoveries to rougher concentrate of 93.8% for copper and 90.2% for gold. These results are 
similar to the rougher results observed in the 2003 test program. Results from the cleaner flotation 
tests were dependent on feed grade and ore zone.

A program of locked cycle flotation tests has recently been carried out by G&T. Table 13.5 shows 
the test results from this program compared to the results from the 2003 test-work. The 2003 
samples represented are the deep level Kemess North open pit ore. The G&T test-work has been 
carried out on a blended sample considered representative of the first five years production from 
the underground block cave project. The blended sample on which LCT1 and LCT2 tests were 
carried out was made up of 25% CP5, 25% CP3, 35% CP2 and 15% CP1.

13.7 Metal Recovery and Concentrate Grade 

Metal recovery and concentrate grade estimates for use in the preliminary economic assessment, 
are based on the locked cycle test results from the 2003 program, the more recent supporting 
work in 2011, and the grade of the samples relative to the expected feed grade for the project. 
The key test-work results considered are summarized in Table 13.6.

In recognition that further test-work will need to be carried out to improve confidence in forecast 
metallurgical performance, including locked cycle testing of individual ore types, the following 
recovery estimates have been used in the preliminary economic assessment: 

• Copper recovery 91% 

• Gold recovery 72% 

• Silver 53% 

13.8 Concentrate Quality 

The copper concentrate is expected to be of high quality with grades in the range from  
22% to 23% copper, 25 to 35 g/t gold, and 75 to 100 g/t silver. All impurities are expected to be 
below penalty limits: Typically As ≤50 ppm, Bi ≤80 ppm, Ca ≈ 0.7%, Se ≤100 ppm, Hg ≤1 ppm, Pb 
trace, Zn also trace. 

A concentrate grade of 22% copper has been assumed in the preliminary economic assessment.

13.9 Tailings Characteristics 

The ultimate settling density of Kemess North tailings has been determined for three tailings 
samples of different super composites at 66%, 69% and 72% solids. Corresponding pulp 
densities were 1.737, 1.797, and 1.825 t/m3. The Net Neutralization Potential for Kemess North 
tailings will be negative at -50 t CaCO3/1,000 t of tailings. Tailings will need to be stored under 
water cover to avoid pond acidification.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Background 

The 2011 Kemess Underground Mineral Resource Estimate ("2011 Resource Estimate") has 
been prepared by Northgate under the direction of Mr Carl Edmunds who is the Qualified Person 
responsible for the estimates. 

The 2011 Resource Estimate is based on all drilling completed to November 2010, comprising a 
total of 146 drill holes. Preparation of the estimate follows on from the completion of a 30-hole 
infill diamond drill program at Kemess Underground in 2010. The program was designed and 
executed to increase confidence in the grade distribution, location and geotechnical 
characteristics of a target zone of mineralization that has been identified as potentially minable 
using underground mining methods.  

14.2 Geologic Model and Domains 

A lithologic model was generated for the Kemess North region. Three alteration zones were also 
generated, the Sulfate Leach zone, the Phyllic zone, and the Potassic zone (in descending order). 
The Kemess North Fault was constructed by merging north dipping and south dipping fault 
surfaces. The fault is a reverse fault with the older Takla formation thrust over the younger 
Hazelton formation. 

The domains used for resource estimation include both the lithological contacts formed by the 
post mineral intrusive dykes and the Hazelton formation volcanic, and by the alteration 
boundaries. The Sulfate Leach zone has been identified as a broken rock and rubble zone within 
the pre-mineral Takla Formation. This zone has been domained separately as there are 
significantly lower gold and copper values caused by leaching, and lower core recovery. 

Porphyry copper deposits are characterized by large volumes of continuous grade over large 
distances, radially distributed around and within the source intrusion. Within and near the 
monzonite intrusion the grade is higher and decreases with distance. 

To ensure metal is not smeared, a contact analysis process was used to assess if high and low 
grade domains could be defined. The process assesses the average grade with respect to 
distance from lithologic and alteration contacts.Table 14.1 lists the contacts used in the analysis 
and if a gradational or sharp boundary was observed.

The domains used for estimation are listed in Table 14.2 and illustrated in Figure 14.1. Each of 
the domains was estimated using hard boundaries where a block estimate only uses samples 
from within that domain (refer to Table 14.2). Coding of the drill holes has been carried out using 
these domain solids. The coding of each domain was visually validated in cross-section.

14.3 Data Analysis 

• Raw sample data have been composited to 6 m intervals using the MineSight compositing 
procedures, with an allowable minimum composite of 3 m. The mean sample length is 
approximately 2 m for each domain. Compositing to 6 m allows three composites per block. 
The compositing process creates 6 m composites of the primary assay intervals in a down-
hole direction honouring the coded geological domains. The correlation between the 
various metals is as follows: Gold and copper ranges from 0.699 to 0.845. 

• Gold and silver ranges from 0.406 to 0.622 

• Copper and silver ranged from 0.463 to 0.799 

Trend plots were generated for each of the domains to assess the assumption of stationarity for 
easting, northing and elevation. No significant trends were interpreted for Domains 3 or 4. 
Domain 1 shows a decrease in grade in the north east portion of the domain for gold and copper. 
This is also evident for Domain 2 for gold (easting) and copper (easting and elevation). It is 
recommended that this area be assessed for further domaining.

There were no outliers in the data set for individual domains, so no top cuts were applied. 

Specific Gravity ("SG") data was collected by analysis of a 10 – 15 cm length of core; the value 
was assigned to the corresponding down-hole sample length used for assaying. The number of  
SG values per hole varies; pre-2006 drill holes have sparse data compared to the 2006 and 2010 
drill campaigns. For 2000, 2002, and 2003 SG data was provided by wax immersion analysis from 
109 whole core samples. The results from this method compared favourably against on-site air 
and water submersion methods. After 2004 all drilling was followed by air/water SG 
determination, which continued until 2010. 4,539 determinations were made using this method. In 
total, there are 4,648 SG determinations in the Kemess Underground resource area used for 
resource estimation purposes. 

Drill holes were composited to 6 m lengths. The length-weighted average SGs were compared by 
domain before and after compositing and there was insignificant change. The same domain 
codes were used for flagging the SG data as for the assayed variables. A default of 2.59 g/cm3 
was set for the syenite dykes (Domain 6). 

14.4 Variography 

Traditional variograms were generated using composited data for gold and SG. Significantly less 
input data was available for silver for each of the domains, resulting in erratic directional 
variograms. The high correlation between copper and silver allowed the two variables to be 
analysed together in an experimental cross-variogram. 

Down-hole variograms with a 6 m lag were generated for each of the variables per domain. This 
assisted to define the nugget when modelling the directional variograms. The major direction of 
continuity for gold, copper, silver and SG, for Halo zone (Domain 2), Low grade and High grade 
domains (Domain 3 and Domain 4 respectively) was E – W with a 35° southerly dip. No rotation 
was applied to the Sulfate Leach zone (Domain 1) for gold, copper, silver or SG; or SG for the 
Hazelton Formation (Domain 7). 

Experimental variograms were modelled using two nested spherical models and a nugget effect. 
An example of the modelled and experimental variogram for gold within the High grade domain is 
illustrated in Figure 14.2. An example of the modelled and experimental cross variogram for 
copper and silver for Domain 4 is shown in Figure 14.3.

14.5 De-Clustering 

De-clustering test-work using a series of moving windows on a range of grid dimensions was 
undertaken to select a block size for estimation. Table 14.5 illustrates an example of the variation 
in the mean grade and standard deviation of the samples inside the range of block sizes for 
Domain 4. The drill holes generally are of even spacing, although there is closer spaced drilling in 
the north-east quadrant in the higher grade portion of the deposit and Domain 4 encompasses 
this portion. 

De-clustering does not have a large effect until the block size increases significantly. 
30 mE x 20 mN x 20 mRL was chosen for the estimation block size.

Table 14.5 De-Clustering Statistics for Cu and Au for Domain 4 

 

14.6 Block Model Parameters 

A block model was built in MineSight software and imported into Isatis software. The model 
parameters are shown in Table 14.6. 

Table 14.6 Model Limits (Local Mine Grid) 

Local Mine Grid Min Max Cell Size No. Cells 
East 9800 11360 30 52 
North 15500 16700 20 60 
RL 800 1900 20 55 

The block model was coded with the same wireframes used to code the drill holes.  
MineSight software does not subcell the parent block; it applies a percentage fill per block. A 
domain code and percent exists in each individual block. Where two or more domains are 
present, the block will be coded with all domains. The block percentage will not exceed 100%. 
The blocks for each domain were visually checked using MineSight software to ensure they were

14.7 Block Model Estimation Parameters 

A neighborhoods optimization study was carried out to determine the appropriate search 
dimensions and minimum/maximum number of samples for interpolation. The test-work was 
carried out on the gold values for each domain separately. The change in slope of regression, 
standard deviation, mean value and mean sum of positive weights was assessed for a range of 
sample numbers. A maximum sample value of 20 was used for the estimation. The variation 
between the number of samples for the slope of regression decreases approaching 20 samples. 
Negative kriging weights increase as the maximum number of samples is increased from 20. 

An anisotropic search was used, and the estimation search parameters are listed in Table 14.8. 
The rotations used for the search ellipses are the same as the respective variogram model 
rotation for each variable in each domain. 

Table 14.8 List of Search Parameters for Au, Cu and Ag 

 

The estimation was generated using Isatis software. Ordinary Kriging was used for gold and SG 
and Co-Kriging for copper and silver for the four domains. SG was also Ordinary Kriged for the 
Hazelton domain. Default grade values were set to the Hazelton Formation volcanics (Domain 7), 
Sufate Leach Zone outside the subdomain (Domain 1), and Halo zone outside the subdomain 
(Domain 2). Table 14.9 summarizes the number of blocks estimated and the total number of 
blocks per domain.

The Sulfate Leach zone and the Halo zone were subdomained and the areas outside the 
subdomains were not estimated. Default values were set to these blocks. The grade of the post 
mineral intrusive dykes (Domain 6) was set to the mean grade of the variables. Due to the limited 
data set for silver not all blocks for Domains 1, 2 and 3 were estimated. These blocks were set to 
a default silver value of 0.1g/t. Discretization was set to 5x, 4y, 4z for all estimations. 

14.8 Model Validation 

The block model was imported into MineSight and initially validated visually by comparing block 
grades against drill hole data in cross-section and plan view for the individual domains. Global 
comparisons of the mean grade of the blocks against the mean grade of the undeclustered and 
declustered drill hole composites are within acceptable limits for each of the domains. 

Locally, the estimations were reviewed by graphing the mean grade of the variable against the 
easting, northing and elevation for each of the domains. In general, the mean grade of the 
composited samples is more variable than the mean grade of the blocks, which are smoothed by 
Kriging. The block averages, in general, bisect the sample plot, indicating no bias between the 
model estimate and the samples. Larger variation between the means can be correlated with a 
reduction in the number of samples. 

14.9 Resource Classification 

The classification of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources is based on geological confidence, 
drill hole spacing and quality of the estimates. Porphyry copper deposits are characterized by 
large volumes of continuous grade over large distances radially distributed around and within the 
source intrusion. Post mineral modification has offset the mineralization, ie. Kemess North Fault 
and dykes have removed mineralized volumes. Confidence in the estimation domains supports an 
indicated classification. This classification has been based on the estimation of Au and Cu. Silver 
has fewer data available for estimation and is of a lower confidence. The Sulfate Leach zone of 
the Talka Formation has 83 intervals of lost core and has been classified as Inferred.  

The drill hole spacing of the Indicated Mineral Resource is predominantly 80 m x 80 m between 
drill holes, with a small area to the north-east of approximately 50 m x 50 m spacing. Occasionally 
there is 100 m x 120 m spacing between drill holes at lower elevations due to down-hole 
deviation. The spatial continuity is reasonable for each of the four domains (variogram ranges are 
greater than the drill spacing). The Inferred Mineral Resource classification has drill hole spacing 
ranging from 50 m x 100 m to 110 m x 130 m. 

Block classification has been based on a block in block out approach. If 50% of the block is inside 
the classification solid, the entire block will be classified into that particular category. Blocks with 
greater than 50% Hazelton (north of the Kemess North Fault) were classified as waste. 

14.10 Mineral Resources Tonnage Grade Curves 

The mineral contents of the Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource wireframes at a series of 
gold only cut-off grades are shown in Table 14.10. Grade tonnage curves are illustrated in Figure 
14.4 and Figure 14.5 for gold and copper respectively. These tonnages may not all be classified 
as Indicated and Inferred as this is reliant on the economic cut-offs chosen. At higher cut-off the 
uncertainty increases.

14.11 Kemess Underground Mineral Resource Estimate 

The 2011 Mineral Resource Estimate has been prepared by identifying the portion of the resource 
model that could potentially be mined using block cave mining methods. The potentially minable 
portion was determined by carrying out a preliminary block cave mining study using a model 
prepared prior to the 2010 drilling program. The study identified a volume potentially suitable for 
block caving at a Net Smelter Return ("NSR") cut-off value of $13/t. The wireframe encapsulating 
the volume was then expanded by 60 m along the western margin and 30 m elsewhere. The 
resulting wireframe1 (the "2011 Resource Outline") has a volume of approximately 71.483 Mm3. 

Initial estimates for underground bulk mining costs, combined with milling and general and 
administrative ("G&A") costs consistent with the size of operation envisioned for the Kemess 
underground, indicate that a mine could be economically viable with a NSR cut-off in the range of 
$13 – $15 per tonne of ore. 

Table 14.11 shows the 2011 Mineral Resource Estimate for the Kemess Underground deposit for 
NSR cut-offs of $15 and $13 per tonne. The table also shows the tonnage and grade of all 
material within the 2011 Resource Outline "All blocks". The estimate was announced by 
Northgate on 15 February 2011.

15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

The study supporting this preliminary economic assessment has not been carried out to a level of 
detail usually associated with a pre-feasibility study. Consequently no mineral Reserve estimate

16 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Introduction 

The main focus of the mining study is to cost and evaluate a practical block caving mining method 
for the Kemess Underground Project. However, the study also considers the potential for other 
bulk mining methods, including sublevel caving ("SLC") and open stoping. 

16.2 Geotechnical Investigations 

A detailed understanding of the physical properties of the rock mass hosting the deposit is critical 
to determining the practicality and design of the block caving method. Consequently significant 
work has been carried out during the study to analyze and interpret geotechnical information 
collected during the 2010 drilling program. The focus of the geotechnical study has been to: 

• Characterize rock mass conditions in the vicinity of the conceptual block cave 

• Conduct preliminary assessments of caveability and fragmentation 

• Identify further data collection and analysis requirements 

 The geotechnical study represents a first-pass assessment of the geotechnical data collected 
from the 2010 drilling program. Significant additional analysis is required to better understand the 
structural and rock mass data, to allow better definition of input parameters for both caveability 
and fragmentation assessments. Recommendations relating to further work required are included 
in Section 26 of this report. 

16.2.1 Geotechnical Data Review and Analysis 

Geotechnical data collected during the 2010 Kemess Underground drilling program formed the 
basis for this study. Data collected for the 2004 Kemess North Open Pit Feasibility Study was not 
considered. 

The 2010 geotechnical data collection program was conducted by Northgate personnel on drill 
core from 29 drill holes, using logging systems implemented by AMC. The logging captured 
interval data (generally based on drilling runs) relating to the rock mass conditions, and structural 
data, including orientation data (alpha and beta angles). 

AMC integrated the logging data with lithology data from geological logging and the interpreted 
alteration surfaces, to allow analysis of the geotechnical data based on lithology groups and 
alteration domains. Distribution plots of the logging data were compiled for each geotechnical 
domain, which then formed the basis for determining input parameters for caveability and 
fragmentation assessments. 

The distribution plots for 'all rock mass' data are shown in Figure 16.1.

Figure 16.1 Distribution Plots of Geotechnical Parameters for All Rock Mass Data 

 

Laboratory testing of rock properties of select core samples was conducted, including Unconfined 
Compressive Strength ("UCS"), Triaxial Strength, and Indirect Tensile Strength. This data was 
used in conjunction with the logging data to determine rock mass strength parameters for input 
into the caveability and fragmentation assessments.

16.2.2 Structural Analysis 

Analysis of structural orientation data was undertaken using the 'Dips' software (from Rocscience 
Inc). The structural data was plotted on stereographic projections to identify the dominant 
structural orientations. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 16.1 for the three 
dominant lithology groups: Black Lake Intrusives, Takla Group, and Hazelton Group. 

For each lithology group, there were generally two or three major sets and additional minor sets 
identified. There is general agreement between the orientations of each of the major sets 
identified in the Black Lake Intrusives and Takla Group. 

From the assessment it was evident that there is significant scatter in the data, even when 
analyzing only structures identified as being reliably oriented. In addition, a significant proportion 
of randomly oriented structures were identified, particularly within Hazelton Group. It is also 
evident that the majority of sets identified are moderate dipping (i.e. between 30° and 60°). 

It is unclear if the high proportion of random jointing, minor-joint sets, and prevalence of moderate 
dipping sets is due to unreliable drill core orientation, or is a true indication of a highly random 
fracture pattern.

Others Minor – 9.0% 
Random – – 58.2% 

For each structural set identified, apparent and true spacing of structures was determined. 
Understanding set spacing is critical to the caveability and fragmentation assessments. Set 
spacings for these analyses were based on 'open' structures only.

16.2.3 Characterization of Rock Mass Conditions 

The rock mass conditions were characterized for four geotechnical domains based on lithology 
group, but with consideration of alteration type. Each geotechnical domain is described below. 
The relative location of these domains and the potential block cave outline is illustrated in Figure 
16.2. Shown in   



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 54 

Figure 16.3 are representative lengths of drill core for each of the geotechnical domains.  

Black Lake Intrusives 
Black Lake Intrusives form the highest grade portion of mineralization and consist predominantly 
of quartz monzonite ("QMZ") lithology. The rock mass is predominantly potassic altered, 
characterized by biotite-chlorite alteration minerals. RQD values typically range from 75% to 
100%, and the rock mass quality is typically 'Good' with RMR2 = 78 for median rock mass 
conditions. 

Takla Group – Andesite 

The Takla Group overlies the Black Lake Intrusives and consists of andesite augite porphyry 
(AAP), basalt (BAS), and bladed feldspar porphyry (BFP) lithologies. The majority of the rock 
mass is phyllic altered with a zone of potassic alteration associated with the contact with Black 
Lake Intrusives. Phyllic alteration is characterized by quartz-sericite-chlorite alteration. RQD 
values typically range from 90% to 100% and the rock mass quality is typically 'Good', also with 
RMR = 78 for median rock mass conditions. 

Takla Group – Sulfate Leach Zone 

The Takla Group – Sulfate Leach zone overlies the Takla Group, and extends from surface to 
depths ranging from 50 m to 120 m. The zone consists of similar lithologies to the underlying 
Takla Group, but is typically highly fractured due possibly to the dissolution of sulfate minerals 
(including gypsum) from the rock mass by acid ground water. RQD values range from 0% to 
100%, with a median value of approximately 30%. Rock mass quality is typically 'Poor' to 'Fair' 
with RMR = 45 for median rock mass conditions. 

Hazelton Group 

The Hazelton Group consists of post mineralization volcanics. Occurring on the northern side of 
the proposed block cave, the Hazelton Group forms a moderate to steep dipping, east-west 
striking contact with the Takla Group and underlying Black Lake Intrusives. The contact consists 
of variable quality rock mass with a wide range of RQD values recorded, generally ranging from 
40% to 100%, but with narrow zones of intensely fractured rock mass with RQD values ranging 
from 0% to 40%. Core photos indicate that the Hazelton Group is typically intensely veined within 
the vicinity of the contact, resulting in increased fracture frequency and reduced RQD relative to 
the Takla Group and Black Lake Intrusives. Rock mass quality is typically 'Fair' to 'Good' with 
RMR = 61 for median rock mass conditions.

16.2.4 Caveability Assessment 

The caveability of a deposit defines the ability of the orebody and overlying rock mass to cave 
freely and spontaneously, once undercut to sufficient dimensions. The purpose of the caveability 
assessment is to estimate the required undercut dimensions to achieve caving. 

AMC's preliminary assessment of caveability was undertaken using an empirical approach 
developed by Laubscher (1990). The method involves the determination of a 'Mining Rock Mass 
Rating' ("MRMR") which considers rock mass quality, with some adjustments made for particular 
factors that impact caveability. MRMR values are then plotted on Laubscher's caving chart (after 
Bartlett, 1994) to estimate the Hydraulic Radius ("HR") at which caving may occur.

AMC conducted the caveability assessment for each geotechnical domain for both median and 
upper 80th percentile rock mass conditions. For the purposes of this study, a conservative 
approach was taken to estimating the adjustment factors. The adjustment factors used are 
summarized in Table 16.2. 

The assessment indicates that for each geotechnical domain, the rock mass is forecast to cave at 
undercut Hydraulic Radii significantly less than that of the conceptual cave undercut for both 
median and upper 80th percentile rock mass conditions. The maximum upper-bound Equivalent 
Square Dimension of 156 m x 156 m forecast for Black Lake Intrusives, is less than the minimum 
conceptual cave dimension of 220 m (the length of the east wall of the cave).  

The results of the caveability assessment are summarized in Table 16.3.

16.2.5 Fragmentation Assessment 

AMC's preliminary assessment of fragmentation was undertaken using BCFv3.04 software 
(copyright G.S. Esterhuizen). The software is based on the rock mass properties and expert 
knowledge of caving fragmentation processes. 

The fragmentation assessment involves the assessment of 'primary' fragmentation and 
'secondary' fragmentation. Primary fragmentation is essentially the distribution of fragment sizes 
as they are released from the caving face, and is largely dependent upon in situ fracturing of the 
rock mass, in situ stress and the cave geometry. Secondary fragmentation analysis uses the 
output of the primary fragmentation analysis and determines additional fragmentation, which 
occurs as the caved material moves down the draw column. 

The fragmentation assessment was conducted for each geotechnical domain for median rock 
mass conditions, and using the structural data sets and spacing determined in AMC's assessment 
of the structural data.

The primary fragmentation analysis was run assuming a cave face dip direction of 225°  
(i.e. towards the south-west), and cave face dip angles of 30°, 45° and 60°. 

 

The results of the primary fragmentation analysis indicated that primary fragmentation was not 
particularly sensitive to varying cave face dip angles. As such, the secondary fragmentation 
analysis was run using primary results for only the 45° cave face dip scenario. The secondary 
fragmentation analysis was run for varying draw heights (50 m, 150 m, 250 m, 350 m and 450 m) 
and varying draw rates (8 cm/day, 12 cm/day and 20 cm/day). 

The primary and secondary fragmentation results for each domain at different draw heights are 
summarized in Table 16.4. The results assume a 45° cave face dip angle and column draw-down 
rates of 20 cm/day. 

Note: The table shows the percentage of material in drawpoints less that 2m3 in size. The remaining material therefore 
has a size greater than 2m3. 

Figure 16.4 and Figure 16.5 show the fragmentation size distribution plots, expressed in terms of 
'percentage passing', for Black Lake Intrusives for the primary and secondary fragmentation.  

The forecast fragmentation of the Takla Group – Sulfate Leach Zone and Hazelton Group is 
significantly finer than for the Black Lake Intrusives and the Takla Group. As a result there may be 
potential for the preferential draw of these materials through the cave. The Hazelton Group is 
encountered on the extraction level, and therefore the average draw heights for the Hazelton 
Group should be lower, thus minimizing the potential for secondary break. The Takla Group 
– Sulfate Leach Zone rock mass overlies the mineralized zone, and therefore would be drawn-
down the full column height, resulting in maximum secondary fragmentation and generation of 
fines. 

It should be noted that this assessment is a preliminary first-pass estimation of fragmentation, so 
should be considered indicative only. Further work is required to understand the structural 
spacing data and rock mass properties used as inputs for the assessment, and the sensitivity of 
the results to variations in the input parameters. 

Despite the preliminary nature of the assessment, it is clear that the primary fragmentation for the 
Black Lake Intrusives and the Takla Group (approximately 48% greater than 2m3) indicate that 
practical and efficient methods of secondary breaking in drawpoints and grizzlies will be required. 
By comparison, estimates of primary fragmentation made at the feasibility study stage for the 
Palabora mine, where coarse fragmentation has been recognized as presenting production 
challenges3, were 75% greater than 2 m3.

16.3 Review of Underground Mining Options 

The geological interpretation and mineral resource block model prepared by Northgate and 
described in Section 14, forms the basis for mining studies. Prior to commencing the mining 
studies the mineral resource model was first modified to facilitate data manipulation during the 
study. The modified model ("the Mining Block Model") was reduced in size by including only those 
blocks with centroid coordinates between 9,890 and 11,000 in the 'X' direction (east-west) 
between 15,790 and 16,520 in the 'Y' (north-south) direction and above 900 m in the 'Z' direction4. 
In addition, fields not required for the mining study were removed and separate fields identifying 
individual domains were coded into a single field. Blocks sharing multiple domains were coded 
according to the dominant domain. The following codes were used:  

• Type 0 = No defined rock type 

• Type 1 = Sulfate Leach Zone 

• Type 2 = Halo Zone 

• Type 3 = Low grade Zone 

• Type 4 = High grade Zone 

 

                                                      

4  Coordinates (X, Y, and Z) refer to the Kemess Mine Grid. The datum for the Z coordinate is mean sea level.

• Type 6 = Syenite dykes. 

• Type 7 = Hazelton volcanics. 

The resource model includes a field reflecting the Net Smelter Return ("NSR") values of the 
mineralization. The NSR values are expressed in Canadian Dollars and reflect the estimated 
value of the mineralization to Northgate before deducting mining, ore processing and site 
overhead costs. The values reflect recovery losses in both the on-site mill and off-site smelter, but 
do not reflect the impact of mining dilution and recovery. The values are based on the metal 
prices, mill performance, and smelter terms shown in Table 16.5. The values have been 
calculated by applying the following formula to the copper and gold grades in the model. 

NSR = (40.86 x %Cu) + (23.36 x g/tAu). 

The use of NSR values assists in assessing the relative value of the mineralized blocks within the 
resource model and enables a single value to be used when determining cut-off limits. The use of 
NSR values is usual in deposits containing more than one recoverable metal.

The distribution of mineral resources within the Mining Block Model is shown in a series of images 
in Figure 16.6. The images show horizontal slices through the deposit at 40 m intervals 
commencing at 1,140 mRL (top left hand image) followed by 1,180 mRL (top right hand image). A 
number of north-south cross sections are also shown in Figure 16.7. The blocks are coloured 
according to the NSR value per tonne in $5 increments with purple blocks having values greater 
than $40 per tonne. The block sizes are 30 m east-west by 20 m north-south.

16.3.1 Preliminary Assessment of Mining Methods 

A graph of the tonnage above a range of NSR cut-off values is shown in Figure 16.8. Indicative 
mining cost ranges for each of the mining methods are superimposed on the graph. The costs 
reflect the total site costs (mining, processing, and site overheads) and are based on AMC's 
experience of mines operating at the production rates envisaged for each method and the 
expected mining conditions at Kemess. 

Open stoping is expected to have combined mining, processing, and site overhead costs greater 
that $40/t at best. The portion of the resource lying above this cut-off value is about 13.5 Mt at an 
average NSR value of $52/t. In AMC's opinion the total operating margin of $162 M (13.5 Mt x 
$12/t) would be insufficient to cover the mine development capital. A project developed on this 
basis would be extremely vulnerable to the risk of increased operating costs, or lower metal prices 
fully eroding the operating margin. 

Figure 16.8 Expected Cost Ranges for Different Mining Methods 

 

SLC mining is expected to have an operating cost of approximately $25/t. The portion of the 
mineral resource above this cut-off value is approximately 44 Mt at an average NSR value of 
$37/t. This resource base would be sufficient to support a production rate of 4–5 Mtpa. The total 
operating margin would be in the order of $550 M, which may be sufficient to cover the mine 
development cost.  

Block caving is expected to have a total site operating cost of about $14/t based on a production 
rate of 8 Mtpa. The portion of the mineral resource above a $15/t cut-off value is approximately 
225 Mt at an average NSR value of $22/t. The resource base would be sufficient to support a 
production rate, possibly in excess of 8 Mtpa. The total operating margin would be in the order of 
$1,600 M. 



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 65 

The simple analysis above ignores the effects of mining recovery and dilution and the inevitability 
that that it will be impractical to recover all of the resources above the cut-off value. Despite this, 
the analysis is sufficient to indicate that open stoping is very unlikely to be a viable method; and 
that block caving has the most significant potential. For completeness, further comments on the 
open stoping and SLC methods are included in the following sections. The block caving method, 
which forms the basis of the preliminary economic assessment, is described more fully in the 
remainder of the report. 

16.3.2 Open Stoping Methods 

Analysis of the geotechnical data indicates that opens stopes with plan dimensions of 
approximately 20 m by 20 m over vertical heights of up to 120 m would be stable with some cable 
bolting of the stope walls and back. The higher grade zone has plan dimensions in the order of 
330 m by 140 m and vertical heights varying from 80 m to 120 m. Stopes would need to be laid 
out in a checkerboard arrangement to extract the deposit. 

Three open stoping methods are conceivable; open stoping with cemented fill, open stoping with 
uncemented fill (or no fill) and open stoping with pillar extraction. Open stoping without cemented 
fill will require substantial pillars to contain the fill and support the mining area. In a checkerboard 
configuration recovery could be expected to be in the order of 50% as shown in Figure 16.9. The 
use of cemented fill would enable much higher recovery, in the order of 90%, but at extra cost. 

Open stoping with pillar extraction would involve mining two or more stopes followed by removal 
of the supporting pillars in a mass blast. After removing sufficient pillars the overlying strata would 
be allowed to collapse. This method is rarely used in a checkerboard configuration because of the 
relatively small percentage of ore that can be extracted cleanly during the open stoping, stage 
and the challenges of successfully and safely drilling and blasting multiple pillars. 

Figure 16.9 Plan View of Open Stoping Layout with Pillars  

 



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 66 

All open stoping approaches require a complex series of separate mining activities and inflexible 
extraction sequences. These factors lead to higher costs and lower production rates for a given 
size orebody than is the case with either the SLC or block caving methods. In AMC's opinion 
open stoping is not a commercially viable method for the Kemess Underground deposit.  

16.3.3 SLC Mining Method 

To better assess the potential of the SLC method, mining outlines and a development layout have 
been prepared. The design assumes a highly mechanized SLC operation with ore delivered from 
SLC crosscuts to a lateral transfer level via a number of ore passes. On the transfer level, ore 
would be transferred using underground trucks from chutes at the base of the ore passes to a 
gyratory crusher. Crushed ore would be conveyed to surface and then transferred to the Kemess 
mill via an overland conveyor. 

The SLC design includes seven SLC levels spaced at 25 m vertical intervals, with the uppermost 
level positioned at 1315 mRL. Crosscuts are spaced at 15 m centres. 

Recovery and dilution have been estimated using a series of algorithms developed by AMC. Rock 
overlying the uppermost SLC level contains significant metal values, thus reducing the diluting 
effect from this material entering the SLC draw. The concept design prepared to evaluate the SLC 
option is shown in Figure 16.10.  

Figure 16.10 SLC Design Concept 

 

The production and grade estimates resulting from the SLC design are summarized in  
Table 16.7.

The total length of excavations included in the concept SLC design along with the estimated 
development cost is shown in Table 16.8. An estimate of the mine operating cost is shown in  
Table 16.9. The average NSR value of the diluted material recovered by SLC mining ($34/t) 
would barely cover the operating cost of $32/t and would not cover the mine capital development 
cost.

16.4.1 Block Cave Footprint Selection 

AMC initially investigated four possible block cave extraction level elevations (1,100, 1,140, 1,180 
and 1,220 mRL) to identify the most suitable position for the base of the cave. This work was 
carried out using an earlier version of the Kemess North resource model. The work indicated that 
a single extraction level on, or about 1,140 mRL would provide the best economic return. A review 
of the grade distribution of the Mining Block Model indicated little change in the metal distribution 
from the earlier model. Consequently, 1,140 mRL was selected as the extraction level for the 
preliminary economic assessment.  

Using this elevation, AMC identified a suitable block cave footprint using a block cave modelling 
program. The assumptions used to identify the footprint are shown in Figure 16.11. The program 
used to model material flow considered only vertical mixing of rock within the draw column.  



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 69 

Figure 16.11 Draw Parameter Input Assumptions 

 

When selecting the block cave footprint, the total NSR value recovered by mining each draw 
column was compared with an initial estimate of the construction cost of the portion of the 
extraction level and undercut level associated with each draw column ($376,000). The 
comparison was carried out after deducting an initial estimate of the site operating cost ($14.30/t). 
A practical block cave footprint was drawn around those columns that generated a positive net 
margin. 

While satisfying the initial economic selection criteria, a significant number of draw columns to the 
south and east of the footprint appeared only marginally economic. These were excluded from the 
footprint on the assumption that, in total, they would generate insufficient revenue to cover costs 
of the mine infrastructure required to access them, or would not produce a practical footprint. 

A total of 234 draw bells (468 drawpoints) were included in the outline. The selected footprint and 
the net margin generated by each draw bell (NSR value of material drawn less the site operating 
cost and the drawpoint establishment cost) are shown in Figure 16.12.

The selected footprint has nominal dimensions of 540 m east-west and 230 m north-south. The 
area is approximately 125,000 m2 and has a hydraulic radius of 81 m. Heights of the columns 
varied from 160 m to 400 m. The typical range of column heights is shown in Figure 16.13. 
Individual blocks in the model have east-west, north-south, and height dimensions of 30 m, 18 m 
and 20 m respectively. Each column of blocks represents two draw columns.

16.4.2 Ore Flow Modelling 

The process used for footprint selection provided an initial estimate of the mineable tonnage and 
grade of material that could be recovered from the cave. This estimate is shown in Table 16.10.

Following this initial estimate of block cave output, a cellular automata model, which uses material 
and probabilistic properties of individual particles to generate flow profiles, was used to provide a 
better assessment of the possible material movement in the cave; and to provide a production 
schedule as a basis for economic modelling. The modelling was carried out on AMC's behalf by 
PGCA (Power Geotechnical Cellular Automata).

The parameters used in the modelling are summarized as follows: 

• An offset herringbone layout was used with crosscuts and drawpoints spaced at 30 m and 
18 m respectively.  

• Flow modelling assumed no asymmetric or time dependent cave back propagation. 

• Various draw column widths were modelled; 15 m, 17.5 m and 20 m; with the latter 
reflecting full interaction between draw columns. 

Figure 16.14 shows a long section and two cross sections through the flow model with the draw 
column width set at 17.5 m. The image shows the residual grade distribution at the end of draw 
($14/t shut-off). The white points within the image indicate the original position of material that has 
been removed by mining. The image indicates that the draw columns are somewhat isolated 
across the major apex, but are effectively merged across the minor apex. 

The summary tonnages and grades recovered for each draw width modelled is shown in Table 
16.11.  

Based on the primary and secondary fragmentation estimates in Section 16.2.5 and the ability to 
reduce the drawpoint spacing from the 18 m assumed in this study should further studies indicate 
the need to do so, AMC is of the opinion that modelling using 17.5 m draw widths is a reasonable 
assumption for evaluation of the project at this stage.

16.4.3 Block Cave Design 

Based on the block cave outline described above, AMC has prepared a conceptual mine design 
with the extraction level on 1,140 elevation. The design envisages a mechanised, highly 
automated trackless block caving operation, similar to Northparkes and Ridgeway mines in 
Australia, the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, and the Palabora mine in South Africa. A low height 
undercut, and an offset herring bone layout for the extraction level, have been assumed. The 
dimensions of the extraction level development would be approximately 4.5 m wide by 4.0 m high. 

An undercut level has been designed 18 m above the extraction level (floor to floor). A low height 
crinkle-cut design has been assumed. It has been assumed that drawbells would be constructed 
using similar techniques to those used in other modern block cave mines. 

It has been assumed that fibrecrete and rockbolts would be used for ground support with steel 
arches used to support drawpoint brows. It is envisaged that the floors of the extraction level 
crosscuts and drawpoints would be concreted to facilitate efficient scoop operation.

16.4.4 Ore Handling 

The design assumes direct transfer of ore using 14 t capacity scoops from drawpoints to ore 
passes located at the entrance to each production crosscut. Each ore pass will serve two 
crosscuts. This arrangement is well suited to efficient use of tethered, electrically powered 
scoops. The ore passes lead to truck loading chutes located on an ore transfer level 50 m below 
the extraction level. It is envisaged that ore from the chutes will be transferred by diesel powered 
road trains to a single gyratory crusher. It is envisaged that the road trains will operate on one 
way circuits with each train comprising twin side tipping bins with a combined capacity of 80 t. 

Ore will be crushed to minus 200 mm prior to transfer via a 150 t capacity bin. Crushed ore drawn 
from the bin will be fed directly to the main drift conveyor leading to the surface portal. The key 
design specifications of the main drift conveyor are shown in Table 16.12.

Lift (m) 350 
Belt Width (mm) 1,370 
Belt Speed (m/s) 2.0 
Installed Power (kW) 2,500 

At the surface portal, ore will be transferred from the main drift belt to an overland conveyor, then 
to a stacker conveyor at the Kemess South concentrator. The surface conveyor will be covered 
over its entire length and have a horizontal curve to remove the need for multiple conveyors and 
transfer points. No significant elevated structures are envisaged. The key design specifications of 
the surface conveyor are shown in Table 16.13.

Lift (m) -150 
Belt Width (mm) 1,370 
Belt Speed (m/s) 2.0 
Installed Power (kW) 1,000 

16.4.5 Waste Handling 

It is envisaged that the main conveyor system to the mill will be installed as soon as possible 
during mine development phase, to enable development waste, or waste from drawbell 
development to the north of the Kemess North Fault, to be transferred to existing waste dumps 
near the mill. As the belt system will be lightly used during the development and early production 
ramp-up period, waste will be batched through the system. Waste will be discharged from the 
overland conveyor to a waste stacker conveyor near the mill. Waste from the stockpile beneath 
the stacker will be recovered by front-end loader and trucked to the existing waste disposal areas.

16.4.6 Mine Access 

Access to the mine will be via twin portals and access drifts driven from surface to the base of the 
crusher installation. One drift will be used as an exhaust airway and will house the main drift 
conveyor. The parallel drift will be used as the main access for personnel, equipment and 
materials. The drifts have a design cross section of 6 m by 6 m, and a gradient of approximately 
minus 1 in 9.2 (6.2º). The conveyor drift has a length of 3,240 m.   

16.4.7 Portal Positions 

A number of options have been considered for the location of the access portals. The proposed 
location, while further from the deposit than other potential sites resulting in longer decline 
lengths, is closest to the mill and has an easier surface conveyor route. The location in not in the 
catchment of Amazay (Duncan) lake and also avoids the need for the surface conveyor and 
access road to cross Kemess Creek. The portal positions and alignment of the drift and surface 
conveyors is shown in Figure 16.15. The figure shows Portal Option 2 and Option 3 (the selected 
portal position). Option 1 is not shown and was rejected because of its proximity to Amazay Lake.  

Figure 16.15 Portal and Surface Conveyor Location Options 

 

16.4.8 Mine Ventilation 

The ventilating airflow for the mine has been estimated using benchmark data from other modern 
block cave mines and from a simple analysis of the mining activities that need to be ventilated. 
Figure 16.16 shows a graph of airflow quantities versus annual production rate for a number of 
existing and planned block cave mines. Based on this graph and the relative simplicity of the 
Kemess Underground design, it is anticipated that the airflow requirement for Kemess will be 
between 450 and 500 m3/s. 



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 76 

Figure 16.16 Ventilating Airflow Quantities vs Block Cave Production Rate 

 

In block cave mines, improvements in ventilation monitoring and control systems are increasingly 
enabling air to be directed to areas where mining activities are actually taking place, rather than 
ventilating all potential working areas. Table 16.14 shows a simple analysis of likely airflow 
distribution. It is envisaged that production crosscuts where electric scoops are working will 
require an airflow of approximately 10 m3/s. In crosscuts under development where diesel scoops 
will work, higher airflows up to 15 m3/s, will be required. It is envisaged that airflow through 
inactive production crosscuts will be restricted to leakage airflows only.

Workshop  40 
Pump Station 15 
Truck Loading Loop 100 
Undercut Development 80 
Extraction Level Production 180 
Losses 25 
Total 480 

The proposed primary ventilation circuit is shown in Figure 16.17. One of the twin access drifts 
will be used as a main intake and one as a main return. The main conveyor belt would be 
installed in the return air drift, while the intake drift will be used for equipment, personnel, and 
materials access. It is envisaged that two shafts, each having a nominal diameter of 4.5 m, will be 
raise-bored from the extraction level to surface, one acting as an intake and one as a return. 



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 77 

The main exhaust fan will be installed on the surface near the conveyor drift portal. To balance 
airflow through the shafts and main drifts, and because of the difficulty in providing all weather 
access to the collars of the two ventilation shafts except by helicopter, it is proposed to install 
underground booster fans in the intake and exhaust crosscuts to the ventilation shafts. 

It is anticipated that air entering the access drift portal will need to be heated when air 
temperatures at the portal drop significantly below freezing.

Table 16.15 Total Development Required for Block Cave Mine 

16.4.10 Production Scheduling 

Annual production rates from block cave operations are generally related to the size (area) of the 
footprint from which ore is being drawn (the active footprint). Figure 16.21 shows the relationship 
between the nominal annual production rate and the active footprint for a number of block cave 
mines. 

The overall footprint selected for the preliminary economic assessment has an area of 
approximately 125,000 m2, but it is likely that the active footprint will be somewhat less than this 
over most of the mine life. Using the benchmark data as a guide and considering the proposed 
layout of the extraction level, an annual production rate of 8 Mtpa (approximately 22,500 t/d) has 
been determined as a reasonable basis for the preliminary economic assessment.

It is possible that detailed scheduling and materials handlings simulation will determine that a 
higher production rate is possible. To assess the sensitivity of the project economics to the 
achievement of a higher production rate, AMC has also prepared a production schedule based on 
an annual production rate of 9 Mt (25,000 t/d). 

Figure 16.21 Relationship Between Production Rate and Active Footprint Area  

 
Based on the following operating mines and feasibility studies: North Parkes Lift 1, North Parkes Lift 2, North Parkes 
E48, Finsch (Block 4), Freeport IOZ, Palabora A, Palabora B, and Henderson. Cadia East PC1-S1, Cadia East PC1-
S1 (after eastern shutdown), Afton B1/B2, Ridgeway Deeps, Argyle, Bingham Canyon (SE Cave). 

The following scheduling parameters were used to prepare development and production 
schedules for the Project. The parameters have been applied to both the 8 Mtpa and 9 Mtpa 
production scenarios:  

• Maximum single heading face advance rate averaging 140 m/month 

• Maximum total development advance rate of 960 m/month 

• Cave growth rates progressively increasing to a maximum rate of 170 mm/day 

• Drawpoint construction averaging six per month 

• Ramp-up to full production over three years 

The scheduling parameters result in the development and production schedule for the 8 Mtpa 
scenario shown in Figure 16.22. The tonnages shown include ore from mine development and 
production drawpoints.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Ore Processing in the Kemess South Concentrator 

The preliminary economic assessment envisages that ore from the Kemess Underground deposit 
will be processed through the existing concentrator at a rate of approximately 22,500 tpd (less 
than half the original design capacity of the plant). One of the existing two SAG mill/ball mill 
grinding lines will be removed from the milling circuit as one line has sufficient capacity to treat the 
required throughput. Product from the milling circuit, will pass to the existing flotation, regrind and 
concentrate handling circuits. A copper concentrate containing gold and silver values will be 
produced for transport and sale to customers. 

The concentrator is currently configured, and until recently has been operated, to maximize 
performance when treating ore from the Kemess South open pit. Although the mineral processing 
properties of the two deposits are similar, the differences will require some adjustments to the 
configuration and operation of the plant. The typical differences in ore grades and processing 
characteristics of the two deposits are summarized in Table 17.1.

The differences will result in the following key effects on the operation of the plant: 

• As a result of the higher pyrite content of Kemess Underground (4%) compared to the 
Kemess South Hypogene ores (1%), the volume of rougher concentrate is expected to 
double, resulting in a rougher concentrate mass pull estimated at 20%. Three cleaner 
flotation steps will be required with pyrite depression at increasing lime adjusted pH. 
Despite the increased cleaning requirement, the existing cleaner capacity within the plant is 
considered sufficient.  

• Regrind mill unit power input will be greater than when treating Kemess South ore because 
of the finer grind requirement. Steel consumption and power demand will increase 
proportionally. Despite this, the existing regrind mill has sufficient capacity to meet the 
increased duty. 

• Sufficient concentrate capacity exists in the existing thickeners and pressure filters. 

17.2 Process Design Criteria 

The process design criteria are based on metallurgical test-work, information from the existing 
operation, vendor information, and reference to similar operations previously evaluated. A 
description of the process facilities has been presented below.

17.3 Process Flowheet 

A simplified flowsheet designed to utilize as much of the existing equipment as possible and 
minimize capital expenditures is shown Figure 17.1. 

Details of the transfer arrangements from the mine portal to the Kemess South concentrator and 
the ore processing system are described in the subsequent Sections. 

Figure 17.1 Kemess North and South Simplified Concentrator Flowsheet 

 

17.4 Primary Stockpile 

Ore will be transferred from the overland conveyor to the north-east corner of the existing plant 
site where ore will be transferred to a new conveyor feeding the existing crushed ore stockpile. 
The stockpile currently has two reclaim tunnels and conveyor systems of which only one will be 
used. The stockpile will have a total capacity of approximately 74,000 t of which 15,000 t will be 
live.  

Ore will be reclaimed from the stockpile by three, existing apron feeders delivering ore to the mill 
feed conveyor.  

17.5 Grinding 

The grinding circuit will utilize the existing 10.36 m x 4.65 m, SAG mill driven by twin, 4,475 kW 
motors. The SAG mill is a fixed speed mill. The SAG mill will be operated in series with the 
existing 6.71 m diameter x 10.82 m ball mill, driven by twin 4,475kW motors. Slurry discharges 
from the SAG mill (screen undersize) and ball mill will be collected in the cyclone feed pump box 
and pumped to the ball mill cyclopac for closed circuit ball mill operation. The grinding circuit will 
have a nominal capacity of 24,000 t/day. 

The existing cyclopac in the grinding circuit had been retrofitted with gMAX cyclones. The 
cyclopac consists of twelve cyclones, nine operating. It is not expected that any changes to the 
existing cyclone pumps or cyclopacs will be required.  



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 86 

17.6 Flotation 

The cyclone overflow from the grinding circuit will be processed in 32 existing Wemco 127 m3 
rougher flotation cells. The circuit layout will have two lines comprising two parallel rows, each 
containing eight flotation cells. When processing ore from Kemess South some of the Wemco 
flotation cells were refurbished with new Outokumpu mechanisms. The refurbishment included 
the installation of flotation blowers. A new distributor will be required to permit operation of each 
rougher flotation bank independently. No additional rougher flotation modifications are envisioned 
for processing ore from the Kemess Underground deposit. 

Rougher concentrate will be pumped to the concentrate regrind circuit to produce an 80% passing 
15 µm product for final cleaning.  

Regrind cyclone overflow will be pumped to the first cleaner mechanical flotation cells. These 
cells were retrofitted into the original concentrator and will need to be rebuilt for the Kemess 
Underground Project. The concentrate will then be pumped to the two existing 3.4 m diameter by 
12.2 m high column cells arranged in series. Column cell final concentrate will be pumped to the 
concentrate thickener. Column cell tailings will be delivered to one line of existing column 
scavenger cells. The line contains eight Denver 17 m3 cells that will need to be rebuilt. First 
cleaner tailings will flow to the cleaner scavenger flotation cells from which the concentrate will be 
pumped back to regrind and the tails sent to the final tailings system.  

17.7 Concentrate Dewatering 

Final copper concentrate will be pumped to an existing 18.3 m diameter hi-capacity Westech 
thickener circuit where it will be thickened to 70% solids. The original 10.8 m diameter thickener 
acts as a clarifier for the concentrate thickener overflow solution before being returned to the 
process. Thickened concentrate will be stored in the two 4.88 m diameter x 4 m high agitated 
stock tanks prior to being pumped to the filter presses.  

Two existing Baker Hughes plate and frame filters each containing 135 m2 of filter area will 
dewater the concentrate to 8% moisture. The filtered concentrate will be conveyed to the existing 
concentrate storage area before being loaded onto trucks via front-end loader. 

A new overhead crane and sump pump dedicated to the dewatering area will be required. 

17.8 Tailings Management 

Tailings and waste dump facilities are located at the Kemess South pit. The arrangements 
required for tailings to be discharged to the pit were completed during the later years of Kemess 
South operation. The tailings and some of the mine waste rock will be potentially acid generating 
("PAG"). It is planned that these materials will be deposited sub-aqueously in the pit. Any non-acid 
generating ("NAG") rock will be used for construction fill or deposited in the Kemess South pit 
area on existing waste dumps. 

The tailings storage capacity of the pit has been estimated at approximately 55 Mm3, equivalent to 
approximately 77 Mt of settled tailings. The capacity of the pit can be increased to approximately 
92 Mt by constructing relatively small dams across two low area of the pit rim, one on the south-
west side of the pit (the South-West Dam) and one on the east side (the East Dam). The dams 
would enable the surface elevation of the storage area to be increased to 1275 mRL. Further 
raising of the dam walls to provide storage capacity up to approximately 108 Mt of settled tailings 
is possible.  



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 87 

Based on production schedule prepared for this preliminary economic assessment it is estimated 
that approximately 87 Mt of tailings will need to be stored in the pit. Therefore the South-West 
Dam and East Dam construction will be required later in the mine life.  

Process water will ultimately be reclaimed from the Kemess South pit. Based on 23,800 t/day 
instantaneous tonnage throughput, water requirements for the mill will be 8,450 m3/h respectively.  

The reclaim pumping system from the Kemess South pit will use the existing vertical turbine 
pumps, and the reclaim water will be delivered to the mill process water pond.

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

It is envisaged that the existing infrastructure used for the Kemess South operation will be used 
for the Kemess Underground Project. The facilities are generally in good condition and with minor 
upgrades to parts of the camp, waste disposal systems, and some other facilities will be suitable 
for the Project. 

It is envisaged that the Project will operate using similar fly-in, fly-out commute cycles to those 
used for Kemess South. 

A new access road will be required linking the concentrator to the portal. To minimize land 
disturbance, it is envisaged that the access road will run alongside the overland conveyor. 

Upgrades will be required to some parts of existing exploration tracks that access the collars of 
the proposed ventilation shafts. It is not envisaged that these tracks will need to provide all 
weather access to the shafts. 

An overhead power line will be required from the existing network at the plant site to the portal 
where a main substation will be installed. The portal substation will provide power to the drift 
conveyor drive head and to the underground workings. 

Process and potable water will be supplied from the plant site, with pipe-work routed along the 
overland conveyor and access road.  

Communication facilities, including fibre optic cable, will be installed between the plant site, portal, 
and underground workings.  

It is envisaged that facilities located at the portal will be limited to temporary construction facilities 
required for initial mine development. The facilities will include a temporary workshop for 
underground equipment, fuel bay, offices, parking and lay-down areas for construction equipment 
and materials. Wherever practical, existing facilities at the plant site, including offices, main 
workshops, and change house facilities will be used. 

Employees will travel approximately 4.5 km from the plant site to the portal by bus and light 
vehicles.

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

No marketing studies have yet been carried out for the Kemess Underground Project and no 
concentrate sales contracts are in place. However, it is envisaged that concentrate from the 
Kemess Underground operation would be similar in quality to that previously produced from the 
Kemess South deposit. Concentrate is expected to grade between 22 and 23% copper with gold 
grades in the range of 25 to 35 g/t. Silver grades are expected to range between 75 and 100 g/t. 
Impurities are expected to be below penalty limits. 

Concentrate from Kemess South has typically been trucked a distance of approximately 400 km 
to a storage and rail load-out facility owned by Northgate at Mackenzie, then railed to customers 
in eastern Canada and the USA. Some concentrate has also been exported to overseas 
customers via Vancouver. It is envisaged that concentrate from Kemess Underground will be 
transported and sold in a similar manner.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 

20.1 Background 

Environmental base line data has been collected in the local Kemess North area since 1991. The 
early programs focused on surface water quality in the Amazay (Duncan) Lake and Attycelley 
Creek drainage. The area of interest included the two cirques (central and east) that drain off the 
Kemess North area into Amazay (Duncan) Lake and Attycelley Creek. Attycelley Creek flows 
westerly into the Finlay River, see Figure 20.1. 

Figure 20.1 Kemess – Local Drainage System  

 

Later environmental programs for the Kemess South Mine (1994 and ongoing) focused on the 
Kemess Creek watershed and Attichika Creek watershed. Kemess Creek flows into Attichika 
Creek which in turn flows into Thutade Lake. Thutade Lake is the headwater of the Finlay River 
which flows northward into the Mackenzie River Basin. The Kemess South environmental data 
base includes the following monitoring programs: surface and groundwater, fish resources, 
aquatic resources, climatic data (wind, total precipitation, and air temperature), stream hydrology, 
environmental effects, and limited wildlife data. 

In 2003 environmental programs were initiated to support the Kemess North Project and focused 
on the Amazay Lake and Attycelley Creek drainage. The programs included the following; fish 
resources, aquatic resources, wildlife resources, terrestrial resources, surface and groundwater, 
stream hydrology, meteorology (wind, total precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, 
evaporation), air quality, archaeology, and terrain mapping. 

A number of these environmental programs are applicable to the Kemess Underground Project. In 
particular, the surface water and ground water programs, stream hydrology, meteorology, wildlife, 
fish and aquatic resources, archaeology, and terrain mapping.

The selection of the portal location and the connecting corridor to the existing Kemess mill will 
determine the applicability of the available data and identify the environmental programs 
necessary to complement and complete the environmental characterization. It will be reasonable 
to assume that the environmental programs will focus on the following key areas:  

• Portal location. 

• Cone of depression expressed at the surface. 

• Groundwater at the underground site. 

• Local surface water. 

• Connecting road corridor from the Portal location to the existing Kemess mill. 

Notwithstanding the final selection of portal and connecting corridor, it is reasonable to assume 
the following additional work will be necessary: 

• Terrain mapping, including vegetation, soils and slope stability. 

• Further groundwater analysis to facilitate a detailed water quality model. 

• Archaeology. 

• Metal leaching and acid rock drainage evaluation of portal and decline route. 

• Wildlife and wildlife habitat mapping (i.e., presence, seasonal use and mitigating 
strategies). 

• Continuation of the Kemess South surface and groundwater quality programs.  

• Continuation of the Kemess South fish and aquatic resources and surface hydrology 
(dependent upon connecting road corridor route). 

In consideration of the current mine development concept, whereby the ore is transported to the 
existing Kemess mill, and tailings and waste rock disposed of into the exhausted Kemess South 
pit, there are no apparent environmental issues that would pose a major obstacle to approval of a 
mine development certificate. The two areas that require additional consideration are the 
groundwater quality resulting from the new development and the connecting road corridor. 

The resulting underground water quality and its potential impact upon down gradient surface 
water receivers, does require additional analysis and modelling for development of a long-term 
management strategy. However, it would not appear to pose an insurmountable challenge that 
could not be managed to meet the expectations of the BC government. 

The road corridor should not pose any challenges that good construction, operational and closure 
management strategies could not adequately address. 

20.2 Site Monitoring 

It is envisaged that monitoring during the construction and operation of the Project will include the 
following: 

• Groundwater and surface water. 

• Waste rock, underground rock and tailings characterization (metal leaching and acid rock 
drainage potential). 

• Erosion control and surface water runoff management. 



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 92 

• Air quality. 

• Wildlife presence and utilization. 

• Fish and aquatic resources (scope dependent upon portal & road corridor location). 

• Environmental effects (scope dependent upon portal & road corridor location). 

20.3 Water Management – Operational and Post Mine Closure 

It is anticipated that milling and tailings disposal will operate as a closed system. The tailings will 
be delivered to the open pit storage facility as slurry, containing tailings sand and mill process 
water. The process water that accumulates within the pit will be recycled back to the mill for 
continued use. The tailings storage facility will operate as a closed system and no water 
discharge to the receiving environment will occur during the operating mine life. Upon mine 
closure, when the pit water is of acceptable water quality, it will be discharged to Waste Rock 
Creek via a constructed spillway. 

The management of water generated from the underground development will be determined 
based upon the water quality. Two general concepts are envisaged; delivery of this water to the 
open pit for use as mill process water, or discharge to the local receiving environment. The water 
quality will be influenced by the following: 

• Initial water quality as influenced by the host rock. 

• Potential changes in water quality over time due the underground development that will 
affect water contact with the host rock. 

• Sediment generated from mining activity.  

• Other constituents from the mining activity, i.e. oil and grease, explosive residue, etc. 

Upon mine closure the underground workings will be allowed to flood. Dependent upon the water 
quality, this water will be returned to its pre-development flow routes or a collection management 
strategy will be developed as necessary. 

The water management associated with the connecting road corridor will include implementation 
of road runoff and erosion control standards as per the existing procedures for the Kemess South 
Mine. This will include proper road surface maintenance and slope grading and associated 
sediment control ponds along the route. The sediment control ponds will be positioned as 
necessary and with capacity to provide appropriate retention time and proper outlet discharge to 
the local receiving environment to minimize potential sediment load. Upon mine closure the 
connecting road corridor will be decommissioned and the local natural drainage patterns will be  
re-established. 

The water management strategy for the mill complex, service complex and accommodation camp 
will consist of continuation of the established system presently in place and operational. This 
includes a network of ditches and sediment control ponds. Upon closure the drainage will be 
managed as per the existing 2010 Kemess South Mine Reclamation and Closure Plan. 

20.4 Project Permitting Requirements 

The permitting process to advance the Project can proceed under two scenarios; an Advanced 
Mineral Exploration Permit followed by application for a Development Permit, or proceed directly 
to a Development Permit (Amendment to the existing Kemess Mine Permit M206). At this time it 
appears that an Advanced Mineral Exploration Permit provides the best opportunity to advance 
the Project in 2011, whereby earthworks can begin (i.e. portal collaring and decline development). 



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 93 

A Notice of Work is required to start the governmental process of granting the Advanced Mineral 
Exploration Permit. The information required is currently being compiled and communication with 
the regulatory body is ongoing. 

The Advanced Mineral Exploration Permit will require an associated Reclamation Bond. The 
amount of the Bond will be determined by the amount of work proposed and the associated 
ground disturbance. 

20.5 Social and Community Communication Requirements 

To a large extent, the necessity of social and community communication requirements is dictated 
by the scope of the Project. As the current development plan requires minimal new site 
disturbance and utilizes the existing infrastructure, the overall impact of the project is relatively 
minor. As such, the Project will be viewed as a continuation of the previous thirteen years of 
Kemess South Mine operations. Therefore, communication with the broader community is not 
expected to be extensive. 

However, consultation with the First Nations, in whose traditional territory the Project is located 
was initiated in 2010 and is ongoing. There are three First Nations collectively call Tsay Keh Nay 
(which includes Takla Lake, Tsay Key Dene, and Kwadacha) that have been involved in the initial 
and ongoing consultations with Northgate regarding the Project. Communication with the Tsay 
Keh Nay has centred on the conceptual development of the Project, providing an opportunity for 
their respective communities input, and discussions regarding the economic opportunities. A 
fourth First Nation (Gitxsan) has been provided with general project information in accordance 
with their request. 

In addition, the current Kemess South Mine development permit has a number of commitments 
regarding communication and compensation expectations with several groups. The groups 
include a Licensed Trapline Holder, and two Guide Outfitter Licenses. These groups are currently 
operating under signed Kemess South Mine Agreements and it is reasonable to assume that 
these agreements will continue with the approval of the Project either in their present state or 
renegotiated to reflect the Project. 

20.6 Mine Closure (Remediation and Reclamation) 

The submission of a Mine Development Permit Application will require the development of a 
Reclamation and Closure Plan. The plan will include a cost section that will detail the task to be 
undertaken and the cost of each task.  

The preparation and development of the plan will take place at a later date when it is deemed 
appropriate. However the general requirements will include the following: 

• Decommissioning of the underground workings. 

• Decommissioning of the connecting corridor. 

• Decommissioning of the open pit tailings facility, including construction of the water 
spillway. 

• Decommissioning of the Kemess Mine infrastructure including: 

- Mill complex. 

- Service complex. 

- Camp and accommodation complex. 



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 94 

- Mine-site roads.  

- Airstrip. 

The majority of the above listed items have already been addressed in the 2010 Kemess South 
Mine Reclamation and Closure Plan. This plan provides detailed prescriptions to complete all 
closure tasks for the Kemess South Mine. The notable exceptions are the decommissioning of the 
underground workings and the connecting road corridor.

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

21.1 Project Capital Cost 

Mine development costs have been estimated from quantity take-offs from the mine design, 
multiplied by unit costs derived from first principals in some cases and from benchmark 
information in others. It has been assumed that all mine development will be carried out by an 
experienced mining contractor. The contractor's overhead costs have been included in the 
estimate.  

The cost of mobile equipment, crushers, conveyors and other mine equipment has been 
estimated from a range of sources, including recent supplier's quotations and from benchmark 
costs where supplier's quotes are unavailable. 

An allowance of $4 M has been included to cover the cost of the modifications and upgrades 
required to the mill and site infrastructure. 

Estimates have been made of the cost of engineering, procurement and construction 
management ("EPCM"). The estimates are based on the nature and complexity of the engineering 
and construction work required. 

Allowances have been included for the cost of care and maintenance, and other costs that would 
be incurred by Northgate during project construction ("Owners Costs"). 

Contingency amounts have been estimated based on the nature of the underlying estimates. 

The following tables show the project capital (capital expenditure prior to the commencement of 
mill operations) and sustaining capital (capital expenditure after mill start-up). All activities 
associated with development of the block cave have been capitalized and are covered in either 
project or sustaining capital. 

The capital expenditure profile combined with the operating cost profile is shown in Figure 21.1.

21.2 Operating Costs 

Mine operating costs have been based on estimates of the fixed and variable costs developed 
from first principals for some activities and from benchmark estimates for others. 

A power cost of $40.50/MWh has been used based on an estimate of 2010 power costs at 
Kemess South. 

Mine labour costs are based on an estimate of employee numbers multiplied by annualized 
employment costs for various categories of employees. Annualized employment costs are based 
on current Kemess costs adjusted to include an allowance for underground work. Salaries for 
mine management, technical services, and supervisor are based on AMC's experience of other 
mining operations in the Province. 

Milling, infrastructure and site administration ("G&A") costs have been based on actual cost for 
the Kemess South operation during 2010. The costs were analyzed and adjusted to reflect the 
reduced scale of the operation (throughput reduced from 18 Mtpa to 8 Mtpa). 

The unit costs and the total life-of-mine operating costs are summarized in Table 21.4.

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 Economic Model 

AMC has prepared a cash flow model to analyse and assess the economic potential of the project 
Northgate has advised that no royalties are payable on minerals extracted from the Kemess 
Underground deposit. The analysis excludes Provincial and Federal taxes. 

As the physical disturbance caused by the underground mine will not significantly add to the 
existing requirement for site rehabilitation, the analysis assumes that the disposal of saleable 
assets at the end of the project life will cover site rehabilitation costs.  

22.2 Metal Prices 

The following metal prices, exchange rates, and concentrate treatment terms have been assumed 
in the economic evaluation of the project.

Payable copper 96.5% or 1% deduction from concentrate grade 
Payable gold 97.5% 
Gold refining charge US$4.25/oz 
Silver refining charge US$0.50/oz 

22.3 Concentrate Production and Off-Site Costs 

Over the project life the estimated concentrate transport and treatment costs (Off-Site Costs) total 
$319 M, comprising transport costs totalling $210 M and smelting and refining charges of $109 M.  

22.4 Economic Assessment  

A summary of the key physical and economic parameters for the Project is shown in Table 22.2. 
The estimated production tonnage originates almost entirely from Indicated Mineral Resources.

Based on the metal prices used in the economic analysis the Project has an Internal Rate of 
Return ("IRR") of approximately 10%. The undiscounted cash flow generated by the Project is 
shown in Figure 22.1. 

The sensitivity of the Project to changes in metal prices and costs is shown in Figure 22.2. The 
Project has a similar sensitivity to changes in metal prices as to changes in operating costs.

NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 103 

In addition to the sensitivities shown in Figure 22.2 the sensitivity of the Project to an increase in 
the mining and milling rate from 8 Mtpa to 9 Mtpa was also assessed. The higher production rate 
scenario has been modelled on the assumption that there would be no change in the unit mining 
costs ($4.85/t), but that unit costs for milling and G&A would reduce as a result of the higher 
throughput rate. The increased rate also assumes that no additional capital expenditure is 
required. Using the same metal prices and concentrate smelting term as for the 8 Mtpa scenario 
(as shown in Table 22.1) the Project generates an IRR of 11% and an NPV at a 5% discount rate 
of $155M. 

The NPV and IRR of the Project to a range of specific metal prices more aligned to current prices 
have also been modelled. The results of these upside sensitivities are summarized in Table 22.3. 
In each scenario a US$ to CAD$ exchange rate of 1:1 has been assumed.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The preliminary economic assessment of the Kemess Underground Project indicates that the 
Project has the potential to be developed into an economically viable mining and processing 
operation. However, the success of the Project will depend heavily on realizable copper and gold 
prices. 

Block/panel caving is the only underground mining method with the potential to economically mine 
the deposit. Although there is a higher grade zone within the deposit, the tonnage and grade of 
this zone is insufficient to cover the higher mining, processing, and overhead costs associated 
with more selective mining methods. 

The mining outline prepared for this preliminary economic assessment is based on a selection of 
block cave draw columns that return a positive value net of all costs. Higher metal prices than 
those used in the study would result in the mining outline expanding to the south and east into 
areas of lower grade mineralization. The potential to enlarge the mining outline and increase the 
minable tonnage could extend the life of the Project, albeit at declining ore grades. 

The general location of the proposed portal, main access drifts, and surface conveyor alignment 
results in less environmental impact than the alternative locations considered. Despite the longer 
decline length required to access the deposit, the vertical lift is less, as is the surface conveyor 
length compared to other options. In AMC's opinion the proposed portal location and ore 
transportation arrangements provide the most suitable arrangements for the Project. 

In AMC's opinion further work is justified to advance the Project to a pre-feasibility and feasibility 
stage. In any new block caving operation there is uncertainty regarding the rate and uniformity of 
cave progression, fragmentation, the effects of stress redistribution on development, and the 
mechanisms of material mixing in the cave. These uncertainties can be reduced, but not 
eliminated, by further pre-development investigations and analysis. In new block cave mines, a 
decision to develop the Project, or not, inevitably needs to be made while significant technical 
uncertainties remain.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 

26.1 Recommendations Relating to Mineral Resource Estimation 

• The grade shells used to constrain the assay data have been developed manually and they 
appear to be appropriate. However, it is recommended that a model be developed using 
Indicator Kriging as the guide to the development of the shells. 

• There appears to be material differences in the metallurgical recovery from different rock 
types and alteration zones within the deposit. It is recommended that investigations be 
carried out with the objective of coding blocks in the mineral resource model according to 
their likely metallurgical characteristics. 

26.2 Recommendations Relating to Metallurgical Test-Work 

• It is recommended that further locked cycle testing of the different rock types in the 
proposed mining area be carried out, to increase metallurgical understanding and increase 
confidence in the estimates of metallurgical recovery. 

• It is recommended that further investigations be carried out to improve gold recovery and to 
optimize the relationship between concentrate copper grade and gold recovery.  

26.3 Recommendations Relating to Geotechnical Investigations 

AMC recommends the following activities be carried out to improve the understanding of 
structural and rock mass data so as to better define input parameters for both caveability and 
fragmentation assessments:  

• Further investigation of the spatial variation of rock mass conditions within each domain, 
with the purpose of identifying specific zones in which rock mass conditions differ 
significantly from those that are typical for that domain. 

• Better identification and characterization of faults and major structures, in particular the 
contact between the Takla Group and underlying Black Lake Intrusives, with the Hazelton 
Group. 

• Further analysis of structural orientation data to confirm major structural orientations, and 
spatial variation in orientations 

• Further analysis of structural set spacing data to incorporate fracture zones, randomly 
oriented structural data and minor joint sets. This may require check logging from core 
photographs. 

• Development of a block model of rock mass quality 

• Further analysis of laboratory test results to develop a better understanding of rock mass 
strength 

AMC recommends that the following additional work, which was not addressed as part of the 
current study, is undertaken to advance the Project to a pre-feasibility or feasibility study level. 

• Investigation of rock mass conditions on the southern cave margin and below the extraction 
level, to allow design of excavations for underground infrastructure (including the crusher 
chamber) and determination of ground support requirements. This will require in the order 
of four additional geotechnical drill holes. 

• Analysis of ground support requirements for mine development, particularly for the 
extraction level drawpoints. 



NORTHGATE MINERALS CORPORATION 
Kemess Underground Project  

AMC 711006 Kemess U/G PEA 108 

• Investigation of rock mass conditions along the proposed access decline route and portal 
areas, and determination of ground support requirements. This will require four or five 
geotechnical drill holes. The specific details for this drilling should be developed in 
consultation with Northgate. 

• Investigation of possible locations for ventilation raises/shafts. 

• Investigation of in situ stresses within the block cave rock mass to allow determination of 
optimum development and extraction sequence and orientation of cave layout. This would 
initially involve detailed examination of previous in situ stress measurements from Kemess 
South Pit and may include the requirement for additional measurements. 

• More detailed assessment of fragmentation and caveability, possibly using numerical 
modelling methods. 

• Assessment of caving induced subsidence zone, possibly using numerical modelling 
methods. 

• Investigation and analysis of ground water flows within the block cave zone. Much of the 
relevant data may have been collected as part of the Kemess North Open Pit Feasibility 
Study. It is recommended that the existing information is reviewed and a field program for 
additional data collection be developed (if necessary). This work should be undertaken by a 
specialist hydrogeologist. 

• A risk assessment of mud rush potential within the block cave. 

26.4 Recommendations Relating to Mine Design Studies 

It is expected that all aspects of the mine design would be critically reviewed and optimized in 
subsequent pre-feasibility and feasibility studies; in particular the following work is recommended: 

• Further analysis of the optimum footprint size and location, considering a range of metal 
price scenarios 

• Investigation of design options and identification of the preferred design for the extraction 
and undercut levels. The design options should include providing flexibility for expansion of 
the footprint to the south and east should future metal prices justify this. 

• More detailed cave flow modelling taking into account estimates of cave front propagation 
angles and fragmentation 

• Investigation and selection of the preferred angle of undercut advance and drawpoint 
construction sequencing
