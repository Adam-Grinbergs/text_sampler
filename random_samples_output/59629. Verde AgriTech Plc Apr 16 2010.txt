1 SUMMARY 

Coffey Mining Pty Ltd (Coffey Mining) has been commissioned by Amazon Mining Holding Plc (Amazon 

Mining) to complete a resource estimate for the Cerrado Verde Potash Project in Brazil. 

This report is prepared to comply with reporting requirements set forth in the Canadian National 

Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101). 

The Cerrado Verde Potash Project is located in the Alto Paranaíba region of Minas Gerais State, Brazil.  

The Patos de Minas village can be reached by vehicle from Belo Horizonte in 3 hours (300km), via a 

good quality sealed road.  From Patos de Minas village the project is accessed via a number of 

secondary gravel roads that connect the farming region.  The local vegetation shows relicts of the 

primitive savanna ("cerrado") amid the extensive farming area which includes soya and coffee, and 

industrial forests of eucalyptus and pine trees. 

The Cerrado Verde Potash Project comprises 96 tenements, covering an aggregate area of 1,468km2.  

25 of them (total area of 331Km2) are currently available into the DNPM (Brazilian National Mining 

Department) but were requested by FVS Mineração Ltda.. The others 71 tenements (total area of 

1,137Km2) are owned 100% by FVS Mineração Ltda., that is a subsidiary of Amazon Mining and no 

associated royalties and agreements are in place. 

The Verdete Slate is located on top of the Serra da Saudade Formation and underlies the Areado 

sandstones.  Its apparent thickness varies from approximately 20m in the southernmost domain to over 

50m in the northern half of the Serra da Saudade.  The units are oriented along a north south to north 

northeast direction and are continuously exposed for over 120km within the Amazon Mining permits.  

The Potash mineralization is associated with the Glauconite mineral which gives the Verdete Slate its 

distinctive green colour.  Grab samples along the entire strike length range from 5% to 12% K2O.  The 

potential tonnage is therefore very large. 

A Reverse Circulation (RC) drilling program comprising 19 holes for a total of 997m was undertaken in 

early 2010 by Amazon Mining and has targeted only a select portion of the regional Verdete Slate within 

the Amazon tenements.  All holes were successful in intersecting the Verdete Slate. 

Coffey Mining has estimated the Preliminary Mineral Resource for the Cerrado Verde Potash Project as 

at 27 February 2010.  All grade estimations were completed using Ordinary Kriging ('OK') for Potash.  

This estimation approach was considered appropriate based on review of a number of factors, including 

the quantity and spacing of available data, the interpreted controls on mineralization, and the style of 

mineralization.  The estimation was constrained with mineralization interpretations. 

A total inferred resource of 160M t at 8.75% K2O has been determined (No cut-off applied) as shown in 

the table below.

Coffey Mining considers the Amazon Mining permits have demonstrated the potential to host a very 

large tonnage of the glauconitic Verdete Slate unit, as demonstrated by the preliminary resource drilling 

program and regional mapping and grab sampling. 

Coffey Mining recommends that a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) be undertaken on the 

Cerrado Verde Project prior to undertaking any additional resource definition.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 

AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Project Access 

Patos de Minas village can be reached by vehicle from Belo Horizonte in 3 hours, via a good 

quality sealed road (BR-262).  From Patos de Minas village the project is accessed via a 

number of secondary gravel roads that connect the farming region. 

5.2 Physiography and Climate 

Annual rainfall in the area averages between 1,300mm and 1,800mm, 84% of which falls 

during the rainy season between October and March. December and January present the 

most intense precipitation.  The annual average temperature is slightly above 20ºC. 

The local vegetation shows relicts of the primitive savanna ("cerrado") amid the farming area 

which includes soya and coffee, and industrial forests of eucalyptus and pine trees. The farms 

are mainly confined to the fertile soil of the Mata da Corda Formation that underlines the flat 

tops of the mountain range with altitude levels between 1,000m to 2,000m. 

5.3 Local Infrastructure and Services  

Belo Horizonte is the capital and also the largest city in the state, with a population in excess 

of four (4) million.  It is the major centre for the Brazilian mining industry. A large commercial 

airport with domestic and international flights services Belo Horizonte, which hosts several 

state and federal government agencies and private businesses that provide services to the 

mining industry. Skilled labour is readily available in Belo Horizonte and the local village of 

Patos de Minas.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 Regional Setting 

The regional geology is mainly underlain by Neoproterozoic and Cretaceous rock units, 
which are partly covered by Cenozoic sandstones, lateritic sediments and soils.  The 
oldest rocks, occurring in the southwestern portion of the region, are represented by 
calcoschists and diamictites of the Ibiá Formation (Araxá Group) surrounded by the 
Canastra Group (quartzites, phyllites and micaschists).   

The sequence is followed by the Bambui Group, which comprises the marine deposits of 
the Paraopeba Formation, the Santa Helena Formation and the Serra da Saudade 
Formation, which is the host to the Verdete Slate unit.

7.2 Project Geology 

The Verdete Slate is located on top of the Serra da Saudade Formation and underlies the 
Areado sandstones.  Its apparent thickness varies from approximately 20m in the 
southernmost domain to over 50m in the northern half of the Serra da Saudade and up to 
80m at the northern end where it is covered by younger sediments.  

The units are oriented along a north south to north northeast strike and are continuously 
exposed for over 120km within the Amazon Mining permits.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

Normally, Glauconite is considered a diagnostic element indicative of continental shelf 
marine depositional environments with slow rates of accumulation.  It develops as a 
consequence of diagenetic alteration of sedimentary deposits, bio-chemical reduction and 
subsequent mineralogical changes affecting iron-bearing micas such as biotite, and is 
also influenced by the decaying process of organic matter degraded by bacteria in marine 
animal shells.  Glauconite forms under reducing conditions in sediments. 

 



Coffey Mining Pty Ltd 

Cerrado Verde Potash Project, Brazil – 360908 Page:  22 

9 MINERALIZATION 

The Potash mineralization is associated with the Glauconite mineral which gives the Verdete 

Slate its distinctive green colour.  Glauconite is an iron potassium phyllosilicate (mica group) 

mineral of characteristic green colour with very low weathering resistance. 

The Verdete slate held within the Amazon tenements can be traced for the entire 120km strike 

length with a potential width up to 500m wide.  Grab samples along the entire strike length 

range from 5% to 12% K2O.  The potential tonnage is therefore very large, could reach the 

magnitude of Billons of tons.

10 EXPLORATION 

Amazon Mining has completed remote sensing targeting exercise followed by regional 

mapping and grab samples.  In addition, Amazon completed a preliminary survey using an 

Innov-X portable XRF unit.  The portable XRF unit was then correlated to pulp standards and 

showed good precision although returned a positive bias in the order of <1% K. 

The Verdete Slate is distinctively green in colour and as such is very easy to identify in the 

field and can be visually estimated based on green colour which represents the glauconitic 

content. 

A drilling program was undertaken in early 2010 and has targeted only a select portion of the 

regional Verdete Slate within the Amazon tenements as shown in Figure 10_1 below.  Figure 

10_2 shows the location of the drillholes completed by Amazon.  All holes were successful in 

intersecting the Verdete Slate.

11 DRILLING 

11.1 Introduction 

The principal methods used for exploration drilling at Cerrado Verde have been reverse 

circulation drilling (RC).   

 
 

Figure 11.1_1 

RC Drill Rig 

  

  

 
 

Table 11.1_1 summarises pertinent drilling statistics.  The main zone has been drilled at a 

nominal spacing of 100m to 400m.

All drillholes have been drilled vertical to an average of 52m deep.  No downhole surveys 

have been completed due to the short vertical holes and scale of mineralization.  



Coffey Mining Pty Ltd 

Cerrado Verde Potash Project, Brazil – 360908 Page:  26 

Drillhole collars were surveyed by Amazon Mining surveyors using a portable GPS with 

accuracy of +/-5m. 

Accuracy of the survey measurements (downhole and surface) meets acceptable industry 

standards for the style of mineralization.

Cerrado Verde Potash Project, Brazil – 360908 Page:  27 

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

12.1 Reverse Circulation (RC) Sampling 

The samples were taken on 2m intervals and riffle split down to 3kg samples.  Sample 

weights were not recorded but recoveries were reported as good. 

12.2 Logging 

Drill samples were sieved during drilling and a small sample of the chips was stored in chip 

trays for future reference. 

Basic weathering and lithologies were recorded by the geologists and entered into a digital 

database. 

12.3 Bulk Density 

Amazon utilised a consulting group, ConcreSolo, to undertake Bulk Density measurements. 

Coffey Mining has reviewed the methodology used by the company ConcreSolo, and noted 

that the 22 samples measured the saturated Bulk Density of grab samples collected from 

surface.   

Coffey Mining considers that given the apparent leached zone in the first 10m of drilling that 

down hole samples should be undertaken, to determine if there is any change in density with 

depth. 

Coffey Mining also considers that saturated bulk density measurements are not appropriate 

for resource estimation.  Dry bulk density should be determined.

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

13.1 Sample Security 

All samples following drilling were sent via an Amazon Mining vehicle to the Bureau Veritas 

laboratory in Belo Horizonte for analysis.  All sample reject, pulps and chip trays are stored at 

the Amazon Mining base in Belo Horizonte 

13.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis 

All samples have been prepared and analysed by Bureau Veritas in Belo Horizonte. 

• The samples were received then dried, crushed to 2mm and riffle split 

• Samples were analysed by XRF for Fe2O3, SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO, MnO, TiO2, Na2O, 

K2O, BaO, P2O5, Cr2O3, SrO and LOI. 

Bureau Veritas insert duplicates, blanks and certified standards at a rate of 5% to maintain 

their quality control. 

13.3 Adequacy of Procedures

14.4 Adequacy of Procedures 

No Quality control data has been supplied by Amazon Mining.  Coffey Mining recommends 

that Amazon Mining adopt a similar QAQC program as utilised by Bureau Veritas, which 

includes the use of certified standards, blanks and pulp duplicates.  In addition Coffey Mining 

would recommend that field duplicates which would require the resplitting of the reverse 

Circulation field reject sample to be submitted at a rate of 5%. 

The Bureau Veritas QAQC data shows good precision and accuracy.

17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

17.1 Introduction 

Coffey Mining has estimated the Preliminary Mineral Resource for the Cerrado Verde Potash 

Project as at 27 February 2010.  All grade estimation was completed using Ordinary Kriging 

('OK') for Potash.  This estimation approach was considered appropriate based on review of a 

number of factors, including the quantity and spacing of available data, the interpreted 

controls on mineralization, and the style of mineralization.  The estimation was constrained 

with mineralization interpretations. 

17.2 Geological Modeling 

Based on grade information and geological observations from Coffey Mining and site based 

Amazon geologists, 1 high grade domain and 1 low grade domain have been interpreted 

using E-W oriented vertical sections. 

Interpretation and digitising of all constraining boundaries has been undertaken on cross 

sections orientated at 90º (drill line orientation).  The interpretation was completed using 

8 vertical sections.  Figure 17.2_1 shows the vertical sections location.  The resultant digitised 

boundaries have been used to construct wireframe defining the three-dimensional geometry 

of each interpreted feature.  The interpretation and wireframe models have been developed 

using the Gemcom Surpac mine planning software package. 

As the drill holes collars were surveyed using a portable GPS the RL values of each one were 

defined by Coffey draping those collars to the 3D topography surface.

For the purpose of the resource estimation, 2 mineralized domains were interpreted and 

modelled to the Verdete slate which is characterised by the green glauconitic mineralization..  

Cross section examples are shown in the figures below.

17.3 Block Model Development 

A three-dimensional block model was constructed for the Cerrado Verde deposit, covering all 

the interpreted mineralization zones and including suitable additional waste material to allow 

later pit optimisation studies.  The block model has been developed using Gemcom Surpac 

Mine planning software. 

A parent block size of 100mE x 100mN x 10mRL has been used for all materials with sub-

blocking to 50mE x 50mN x 5mRL to allow adequate volume resolution.  To obtain a robust 

flagging of the wireframe in the block model, a percent model technique was used which 

calculates the percentage of the block inside the high grade wireframe.  This provides a more 

accurate volume estimate.  Bulk density has been coded to the block model based on the 

defined density values provided by Amazon. 

The Table 17.3_1 below shows the summary of the block model created.

17.4 Statistical Analysis 

The drillhole database was composited to a 2m down hole composite intervals, recording.  The 

2m composites were used for all statistical, geostatistical and grade estimation studies.  The 

decision to use 2m composites was based the raw sample lengths of sampled intervals (Figure 

17.4_1).

17.5 Variography 

17.5.1 Introduction 

Variography is used to describe the spatial variability or correlation of an attribute.  The spatial 

variability is traditionally measured by means of a variogram, which is generated by 

determining the averaged squared difference of data points at a nominated distance (h), or lag 

(Srivastava and Isaacs, 1989).  The averaged squared difference (variogram or γ(h)) for each 

lag distance is plotted on a bivariate plot, where the X-axis is the lag distance and the Y-axis 

represents the average squared differences (γ(h)) for the nominated lag distance. 

Several types of variogram calculations are employed to determine the directions of the 

continuity of the mineralization: 

� Traditional variograms are calculated from the raw assay values. 

� Log-transformed variography involves a logarithmic transformation of the assay data. 

� Gausssian variograms are based on the results after declustering and a transformation to 

a Normal distribution. 

� Pairwise-relative variograms attempt to 'normalise' the variogram by dividing the 

variogram value for each pair by their squared mean value. 

� Correlograms are 'standardized' by the variance calculated from the sample values that 

contribute to each lag. 

Fan variography involves the graphical representation of spatial trends by calculating a range 

of variograms in a selected plane and contouring the variogram values.  The result is a 

contour map of the grade continuity within the domain. 

The variography was calculated and modelled in the mining planning software, Gemcom Surpac 

Software.  The rotations are tabulated as input into Gemcom Surpac Software (geological 

convention), with X representing the bearing, Y representing dip and Z representing plunge.  Dip 

and dip direction of major, semi-major and minor axes of continuity are also referred to in the 

text. 

Grade variography was generated to enable grade estimation via OK.  Interpreted anisotropy 

directions correspond well with the modelled geology and overall geometry of the interpreted 

domain. The results are show in Table 17.5.2_1.

17.6 Grade Estimation 

Resource estimation for the 

Kriging (OK) within the low grade 

OK is the most commonly used type of kriging.  It assumes a constant but unknown mean.

Typical ordinary kriging assumptions

The typical assumptions for the practical application of

• Intrinsic stationarity or wide sense stationarity of the field 

• Enough observations to estimate the variogram. 

The mathematical condition for applicability of ordinary kriging is:

• The mean E[Z(x)] = 

• The variogram γ(x,y) = E[(Z(x) 

Ordinary Kriging equation

The kriging weights of ordinary kriging fulfill the unbiasedness condition

 

and are given by the ordinary kriging equation system:

The kriging error is given by:

Properties of kriging (Cressie 1993, Chiles&Delfiner 1999, Wackernagel 1995)

• The kriging estimation is unbiased: 

• The kriging estimation honors the actually observed value: 

• The kriging estimation 

assumptions hold. However (e.g. Cressie 1993): 

• As with any method: If the assumptions do not hold, kriging might be bad. 

• There might be better nonlinear and/or biased methods. 

• No properties are guaranteed, when the wrong variogram is used. However typically 

still a 'good' interpolation is achieved. 

• Best is not necessarily good: e.g. In case of no spatial dependence the kriging 

interpolation is only as good as the arithmetic mean. 

• Kriging provides 

correctness of the variogram.

Additional to the drilling samples, channel composites samples, from complementary 

sampling campaign  were used, after a test of adequacy of support.

17.7.1 Validation 

Validation of the grade estimate was completed with a comparative Nearest Neighbor 

estimation.  Validation consists of a comparative statistical analysis over inferred results for 

low grade and high grade mineralized intervals. In addition an interactive visual validation 

utilizing the drill holes and the block model was completed in plan and cross section (Figures 

17.7.1_1 to 17.7.1_2).  The visual validation of the OK model shows a good correlation, 

considering the inferred level of resource classification, between the blocks estimated and the 

original samples.

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The pertinent observations and interpretations which have been developed in producing this 

report are detailed in the sections above. 

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Coffey Mining recommends that a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) be undertaken on 

the Cerrado Verde Project prior to undertaking any additional resource definition. 

The current resource estimate confidence can be improved by  

� Undertaking additional Bulk Density measurements on diamond core downhole. 

� Improve the current surface topography 

� Improve current internal quality control procedures 

20.1 Budget and Schedule 

The studies including predominantly metallurgical test work are budgeted at $1M in 2010 and 

$1.5M in 2011.  This budget will allow Amazon to complete a Preliminary Economic 

Assessment in 2010 and assuming positive results, progress to a Pre-feasibility Study by the 

end of year 2010.
