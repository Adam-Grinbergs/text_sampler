SECTION 1 - SUMMARY  
 
This Technical Report concerns the Palmarejo silver and gold project located in the Sierra Madre 
mountain range in the western portion of the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. The data presented in this 
report are related to the Palmarejo, Guadalupe, and La Patria deposits and their Mineral Resource and 
Reserve estimates.  The information in this Technical Report is effective as of January 1, 2011, unless 
otherwise stated. 
 
 1.1 Property Description and Location 
 
The Palmarejo Project is located about 420 kilometers by road southwest of the city of Chihuahua in 
the state of Chihuahua in northern Mexico and on the western edge of the Sierra Madre Occidental in 
the Témoris mining district (Figure 1.1). The Guadalupe deposit is located about 7 kilometers 
southeast of the Palmarejo Mine.  The La Patria deposit is located southwest of Guadalupe (Figure 
1.2).  The terms "Palmarejo Project" or "Palmarejo District" used in this document refer to all three of 
the above mentioned deposits and consist of approximately 12,158 hectares covered by mining 
concessions.  Coeur Mexicana owns or controls a 100% interest in 12,109 hectares, a 50% interest in 
one concession of 43.77 hectares and 60% interest in two concessions totaling 5 additional hectares.  
Subject to the description of agreements in Section 4 of this report, there are no known title concerns 
that would affect the continued development or operation of the mine.

1.2 Exploration 
 
Current exploration planning at the Palmarejo mine is to continue infill drilling in order to aid in 
optimizing the open pit and underground mine design and also to elevate Inferred Resources to 
Measured and Indicated status.  Current exploration at Guadalupe has been designed to Inferred 
Resources to Measured and Indicated status and to expand known mineralization along strike to the 
northwest and at depth.  There will also be continued infill diamond core drilling at both sites in order 
to aid in optimizing the underground mine design.  Other targets are being evaluated throughout the 
tenement block.  
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 12 of 245 

1.3 Status of Development and Mine Operations 
 
The Palmarejo Mine experienced its first complete year of operation in 2010 and recovered over 5.9 
million ounces of silver and 102,000 ounces of gold.   The final tailings dam began receiving tails 
during 2010 and continues to be constructed to the final design crest elevation over the next three 
years.   
 
Ore is mined by both conventional open pit techniques and by longhole underground techniques.  Open 
pit mining operations are at full capacity.  Haulage access to the process plant run-of-mine (ROM) 
stockpile and all waste dump areas are complete. Underground operation began stoping in mid-2010 
with both transverse and longitudinal stopes.  During 2010 the Cement Rock Fill (CRF) backfill plant 
was completed and will be in full operation in the first quarter of 2011. 
 
Current Mineral Reserves at the Palmarejo Mine include  the "Rosario", "Tucson", and "Chapotillo" 
areas, mined by open pit methods and the "Rosario", "76" and "108" areas, mined by underground 
methods (see Figure 7.2 in Section 7 of this report). 
 
The Guadalupe mine operation will operate as a satellite to the Palmarejo Mine, with production 
scheduled to begin in 2012.  The Palmarejo Mine will provide processing, tailings and administrative 
support for the Guadalupe Mine.  Ore will be mined by longhole underground techniques and 
potentially by conventional open pit techniques during the life of the project (see Section 22).  The 
current plan has ore material mined from Guadalupe to be hauled to the Palmarejo Mine site for 
processing at the existing Palmarejo mill. 
 
1.4 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 
 
The silver and gold mineral deposits in the Palmarejo district are zoned epithermal occurrences hosted 
in quartz veins and quartz-rich breccias within a package of volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks 
known to host similar occurrences in the Sierra Madre Occidental of northern Mexico.  The style of 
mineralization is typical of other epithermal precious metal deposits in the range as well as other parts 
of the world. Three deposits comprise the Mineral Resources and Reserves cited in this report – 
Palmarejo, Guadalupe and La Patria (there are other mineralized targets on the property).  The 
locations of mineralized structures are shown in red on the map below (Figure 1.3).  The Palmarejo 
deposit includes the La Blanca and La Prieta veins that form a wishbone shown to the north.  The 
Guadalupe and La Patria structures are shown to the south of the Palmarejo project.

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 14 of 245 

The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves for the Palmarejo District stated below are effective 
January 1, 2011, and include the Palmarejo, Guadalupe, and La Patria silver and gold deposits.  
Palmarejo Mineral Resources are comprised of open pit resources above a cutoff grade of 1.01 g/t 
AuEq within a Whittle™ optimized pit at metal prices of US$1,300/oz gold and US$20.00/oz silver 
and underground resources above a cutoff grade of 2.08 g/t AuEq. Guadalupe Mineral Resources are 
comprised of resources above a cutoff grade of 1.80 g/t AuEq.  For the Guadalupe and Palmarejo 
deposit resource estimates, the cutoff grade calculation was done using metals prices of US$1,300/oz 
gold and US$20.00/oz silver, and an Au equivalent factor of 75.75 (see Section 17 for a detailed 
explanation of the AuEq factor). The La Patria Mineral Resource, effective September 17, 2007, used a 
cut-off of 0.80 g/t AuEq (using a price of $600/oz Au and $11/oz Ag).  Due to rounding, there may be 
some minor variations in tonnes, grades or contained ounces.  Total Mineral Resources for the 
Palmarejo District, inclusive of Mineral Reserves, are stated in Table 1.1.

The Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, effective January 1, 2011, are based on Measured and 
Indicated Mineral Resources only (Table 1.2).  The total Mineral Reserves for the Palmarejo District 
include the Palmarejo and Guadalupe deposits only.  There are no Mineral Reserves defined for the La 
Patria deposit.  The separate Mineral Reserves for each deposit are detailed in Section 17 of this report.  
Each ore body has been evaluated using the appropriate mining method and corresponding cut-off 
grades using metal prices of US$16.25/ oz silver and US$1,025/ oz gold.  Palmarejo Deposit Mineral 
Reserves were calculated using an open pit cutoff grade of 1.27 g/t AuEq and an underground cutoff 
grade of 2.64 g/t AuEq.   Guadalupe Mineral Reserves were calculated using a cutoff grade of 2.29 g/t 
AuEq (there are no open pit Reserves at Guadalupe).

1 The royalty agreement provides for a minimum obligation to be paid in monthly payments on a total of 400,000 ounces of 
gold over an initial eight year period.   After payments have been made on a total of 400,000 ounces of gold, the royalty 
obligation is payable in the amount of 50% of actual gold production per month multiplied by the excess of the monthly 
average market price of gold above $400 per ounce, adjusted for inflation.  Payments made during the minimum obligation 
period will result in a reduction to the remaining minimum obligation.  Payments made beyond the minimum obligation 
period will be recognized as other cash operating expenses and result in an increase to Coeur Mexicana's reported cash cost 
per ounce of silver. 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 18 of 245 

 
As of January 1, 2011, the Mineral Reserves are estimated to generate a pre-tax net cash flow of 
$323.3 million based on future capital expenditure of $195.9 million as illustrated in Table 1.6 above.  
The stated Mineral Reserves yield an estimated mine life of approximately eight years.   
 
1.6 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
The Mineral Reserves demonstrate the economic viability of the Palmarejo and Guadalupe deposits as 
combined open pit and underground mine operations delivering ores to the flotation/cyanidation mill to 
recover gold and silver.  Coeur has completed prefeasibility level work at Guadalupe including ore 
reserve estimation, mine planning, capital and operating cost estimates, and cash flow projections.  
Further work on Guadalupe will focus on optimization of mine designs and plans to maximize 
economic benefit of this addition to Palmarejo.   
 
It is recommended, based on the Guadalupe engineering studies completed to date, that Coeur continue 
to advance the Guadalupe project to the construction phase.  The Qualified Persons have visited the 
project sites and have reviewed all information regarding their relevant scopes of work (see Section 2). 
Data and assumptions used in the estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves summarized 
in this report have also been reviewed by the Qualified Persons and they believe that the data are an 
accurate and reasonable representation of the Palmarejo silver-gold project.  
 
It is the opinion of the Qualified Persons for this report that the Mineral Resource and Reserve 
estimates are based on valid data and are reasonably estimated using standard engineering practices. 
There are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-economic, marketing, or political 
issues that could materially affect the Palmarejo and Guadalupe Mineral Reserves.

The Palmarejo mine area consists of approximately 12,158 hectares covered by mining concessions 
(Figure 4.2).  The Guadalupe project area is located entirely within this area of mining concessions and 
is contained within the San Carlos concession which consists of 160.0 hectares and is 100% owned by 
Coeur Mexicana.  
 
Concessions totaling 29 and consisting of 12,109.62 hectares are 100% owned and registered by Coeur 
Mexicana (formerly Planet Gold) are listed in Table 4.1 and include: 
 
 (1) 3,852.51 hectares in the Trogan and Trogan Fracción concessions, the first tenements staked by 
Planet Gold to envelope all of the existing concessions in the immediate project area (the "original 
Trogan licenses");  
 
(2) the Ampliación Trogan, Ampliación Trogan Oeste, Trogan Norte 1, Trogan Norte 2, and Trogan 
Oeste licenses concessions totaling 7,145.51 hectares that are contiguous to the original Trogan 
licenses on the north, northeast, and west; 
 
(3) the La Buena Fe Norte mining license concession covers approximately 98.09 hectares and was 
acquired by means of a lottery when the prior tenement holder defaulted on payment of taxes; and  
 
(4) 1,013.51 hectares in 21 concessions purchased by Planet Gold within the original Trogan licenses 
that include the Palmarejo Resources described in following sections.   
 
As shown in Table 4.2, three concessions are partially owned by Coeur Mexicana (formerly Planet 
Gold), including 50% of the Camila claim of 43.77 hectares, and 60% of the Carrizo claims.

Aldo Arturo Aguayo Dozal Agreement  
 
On July 7, 2003, an application for the Trogan concession was filed with the Chihuahua Informe 
Pericial.  This application was configured to surround the Palmarejo District area and other properties 
of interest along major northwest- and west-northwest-trending structures; the initial application 
covered about 16km in a northwest-southeast direction and three to five kilometers in a northeast-
southwest direction.  From the application, the Trogan and Trogan Fraccion mining concessions (Table 
4.1) were granted in the name of Aldo Arturo Aguayo Dozal, a Mexican employee of Planet Gold, on 
February 19, 2004. On October 15, 2004, Aldo Arturo Aguayo Dozal transferred all rights to the 
Trogan and Trogan Fraccion mining concessions to Planet Gold for a nominal sum.  
 
Carmen Breach Valenzuela Agreement  
 
A lease and option to purchase agreement between Planet Gold and Carmen Breach Russo Viuda de 
Valenzuela ("Mrs. Breach Valenzuela"), the heir of the late Sr. Francisco Jacobo Valenzuela ("Mr. 
Valenzuela Breach"), for concessions totaling 31.23 hectares (Table 4.4) was signed on October 9, 
2003. The concessions lie in three discrete areas within the broader project region.  The agreement, 
which could have been terminated with 30 days notice by Planet Gold, granted Planet Gold an 
exclusive four-year exploration right over the project in exchange for cash payments, including 
$25,000 on signing and seven escalating semi-annual payments totaling $205,000. When these 
obligations were fulfilled, Planet Gold could acquire a 100% interest in the concessions by making a 
payment of $70,000 by the end of four years from the effective date of the agreement.    
 
All contractual obligations and cash payments have been completed and the transfer of rights to Coeur 
Mexicana for tenements Patria, Nueva Patria, Maclovia and San Juan de Dios has been accomplished.

any areas of active exploration and operations being conducted by Coeur Mexicana.  The remaining 
50% is owned by Mr. Simon Trejo Rascon. 
 
4.4 Title Opinion  
 
Garcia-Jimenez (2006b) provided an opinion as to the title and status of the concessions listed in 
Tables 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6. This opinion updated the previous title opinion (Garcia-Jimenez, 
2006a). Garcia-Jimenez (2006b) found that the concessions "(a) are valid, enforceable and in good 
standing; and (b) such mining concessions and the rights derived there under are free and clear of all 
liens, mortgages, claims, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature" with the provisos 
that:  
 
(1) registration corrections to the  Carrizo and Carrizo Anexas concessions are needed, as discussed 
above; and  
 
(2) surface tax payments were not verified.  
 
Garcia-Jimenez (2006b) also noted that, "the Mexican Mining Law was amended by a Congress 
Decree dated February 22, 2005, published at the Official Daily of the Federation on April 28, 2005 
and according to said amendment now there exist only mining concessions valid for a period of fifty 
years. All existing exploration and exploitation concessions have been converted into mining 
concessions expiring fifty years from the date they were originally granted. The information (type of 
concession and expiry dates) mentioned in this legal opinion reflects the amended Mexican Mining 
Law." This report has been updated to reflect this change to the Mining Law of Mexico.  
 
4.5 Ejido Agreements  
 
In addition to the lease and option to purchase agreements described above, Coeur Mexicana obtained 
initial exploration agreements that allow surface disturbance for the purpose of conducting exploration 
activities from four ejidos, or surface-owner councils, that covered the Planet Gold land holdings.  The 
project area is under the jurisdiction of each of these four councils, which include the Palmarejo, 
Guazapares, Guerra al Tirano, and Agua Salada ejidos.  Agreements with the Palmarejo, Guazapares, 
and Guerra al Tirano ejidos were effective through November 2009, while the Agua Salada, agreement 
is effective through September 2010. These agreements allowed Coeur Mexicana to carry out 
exploration on the ejido ground in exchange for paying nominal sums determined by the areas of 
disturbance associated with the construction of new roads, drill pads, etc. As part of their public 
relations program with the local inhabitants, Coeur Mexicana has also granted certain specific requests 
by the ejidos.   
 
Subsequent to the exploration agreements described above, Coeur Mexicana executed agreements with 
the Palmarejo, Agua Salada and Guazapares ejidos covering surface activities involved with the 
exploration, exploitation, and processing of mineral deposits, the construction of all necessary mining 
and processing facilities, and the undertaking of mining operations, in return for annual rental 
payments.  The annual rental payment to the Guazapares ejido is $17,500 and annual rent to the 
Palmarejo ejido is $25,000.  The agreements were signed on October 16, 2005 and October 30, 2005, 
respectively, and are effective for 15 years with a company option to extend the terms for an additional 
15 years. Signed copies of these agreements were reviewed by MDA and concluded that in respect of 
the agreements, the terms and conditions reported herein accurately reflect the executed documents 
reviewed.  



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 29 of 245 

 
Planet Gold also negotiated a similar agreement with the Agua Salada ejido on November 20, 2005, in 
return for annual rent of $3,560.  
 
The Palmarejo ejido agreement was modified in 2010 to include additional right of way authorizations. 
As a result, the annual rent was increased to about $45,000. 
 
These agreements have already been registered with the Agrarian National Registry, and there are no 
known title concerns that would affect the development or operation of the mine. 
 
In October 2008, Planet Gold entered into an agreement with Guazaparez ejido for land use in the 
Guadalupe/Los Bancos area.  An annual rent of $50,000 is paid to the ejido for the use of 372.8 
hectares during a renewable 4-year term.  In 2009 a contract modification with the Guazapares ejido 
was finalized assuring Coeur Mexicana the use of 643.7 hectares for the planned mining activities at 
Guadalupe as outlined in this report.  This mining agreement has a six year term and is renewable, and 
raised the annual rent to $85,000.  The company has also obtained complete control of part of the 
rented area by paying compensation to some land-holding ejidatarios.   
 
On August 16, 2010, Coeur Mexicana signed with the Guerra al Tirano ejido a 4-year exploration 
agreement on 69.7 hectares covering the La Patria project. 
 
4.6 Property Rights Summary Statement  
 
All mineral and surface rights required to operate the Palmarejo Mine as presented in this Technical 
Report have been secured, subject to the conditions described above. This includes rights to property 
that encompass all Mineral Resources and Reserves discussed in this report, and all present and 
planned mine workings and related facilities, including mine workings, tailings storage facility, water 
impoundments, mined rock storage facilities, ore processing and tailings storage facilities, and 
ancillary site facilities for the Palmarejo mine site. 
 
There are no other royalties, rights, payments, encumbrances or obligations affecting the project other 
than those presented in this report. There are no known environmental issues relevant to the project 
other than those discussed in Section 22 of this report. 
 
4.7 Environmental Considerations and Status of Regulatory and Permits  
 
Palmarejo Mine permits have already been granted authorizing open pit gold and silver mining within 
the area depicted in the EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment).  With the addition of underground 
mining and other changes, a permit modification was required. Coeur requested the corresponding 
authorization for the EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) modification from SEMARNAT 
(Secretary of the Environment and Natural Resources, Mexico), and received confirmation that no 
further environmental analysis was required on March 28, 2008 and the changes were approved. All 
other permits and authorizations required for construction and operation of the Palmarejo Mine have 
been obtained.  At the end of 2010, Coeur Mexicana requested to expand the environmental 
disturbance surface for the Palmarejo project, and it received authorization from SEMARNAT on 
December 7, 2010.  The authorization to change the soil use in 290.3 hectares was awarded on 
November 3, 2010. 
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 30 of 245 

Guadalupe is fully permitted for land disturbance related to open pit and underground mine activities 
and related disturbance.  This project received its authorization for environmental disturbance on 
September 24, 2010, and its initial authorization for change of soil use on November 26, 2010. 
 
Coeur conducts an annual review of its potential reclamation responsibilities company wide.  The year 
end 2010 preliminary assessment for final reclamation at the Palmarejo mine is estimated to be $17.3 
million and for Guadalupe is estimated to be $2.1 million.

SECTION 5 - ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY  
 
5.1 Accessibility   
  
Access to Palmarejo from Chihuahua is via paved Highways 16 and 127 to the town of San Rafael, 
Highways 16 and 127 have four and two-lanes respectively. From San Rafael travel is by gravel road 
to Témoris, and finally to Palmarejo.  Approximate total driving time is 7 hours from Chihuahua.  The 
Chihuahua-Pacifico rail service operates between Chihuahua and Los Mochis on the southwest coast 
of Mexico. Two passenger trains and one freight train operate daily from Chihuahua. Access from the 
rail station at the town of Témoris to Palmarejo is along 35 km of government-maintained gravel road, 
an extension of Highway 127, that continues on through to Chinipas (Gustin and Prenn, 2007). 
 
5.2 Climate 
 
The climate of the area is moderate. Average maximum temperature is about 34°C, with an average 
minimum temperature of about 5°C. Rainfall occurs mainly in the summer months, with an average 
annual precipitation of about 800 mm (Gustin and Prenn, 2007). All anticipated exploration and 
operations activities can be conducted year round.  
 
5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
  
The Palmarejo area has moderately well developed infrastructure and a local work force familiar with 
mining operations.  Approximately four to five thousand inhabitants reside within a one-hour drive of 
the project (Skeet, 2004a). Chinipas and Temoris are the two nearest towns, both with an estimated 
population of approximately 1,600 inhabitants (according to 2005 census data). The small village of 
Palmarejo lies immediately northwest of the Palmarejo District area and, according to the 2010 census, 
has a population of about 430.  
  
The Chihuahua-Pacifico railway connects Chihuahua with Los Mochis, located on Mexico's western 
coast in the state of Sinaloa.  Passenger and freight trains pass along this railway daily. The rail station 
at Témoris is 35 km from Palmarejo by gravel road.  Light aircraft airstrips are located in both Témoris 
and Chinipas. 
 
The Palmarejo Mine site was serviced with a 33,000-volt power line supplied by the Comisión Federal 
Electricidad (CFE), the Mexican federal power authority. An additional 115kva high voltage line was 
constructed from the Divisadero substation to the Palmarejo Mine site during 2009, and the Palmarejo 
mine, plant and all other electrical load is now connected to this line.  The same 115kva high voltage 
line is within 7 kilometers of the Guadalupe project and excess capacity exists on this line to supply the 
estimated 2.5 MW of power needed for Guadalupe. 
                                                                                
The state road between San Rafael and Palmarejo was initially upgraded in late 2007 for the 
mobilization of equipment and construction materials. This is an on-going activity as Coeur has 
permanent maintenance crews working on the road. 
  
Water for the Palmarejo mine is sourced from a variety of sources.  As of 2011 the primary water for 
milling is recycled from the tailings dam and from the Fresh Water Diversion Dam (FWDD).  
Occasionally, additional make up water, when needed, is pumped from the Chinipas river infiltration 
gallery and piped to site via a 17 km pipeline.  Water for domestic use is also obtained from the 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 32 of 245 

Chinipas River infiltration gallery and hauled to site by truck load (10,000 L tanks on flatbed trucks) 
Water from the FWDD which is located on the mine site is pumped to the underground mine for 
drilling and dust suppression, or to the plant for makeup water.  
 
Fresh water for the Guadalupe Mine is planned to come from a combination of sources which includes 
surface water in nearby arroyos and the FWDD.  Water will also be collected in sumps constructed in 
the underground mines and clarified for recycling in the underground system. 
 
The infrastructure for the Palmarejo mine is complete and the mine is operating and processing ore 24 
hours per day 7 days per week.  The Guadalupe project will be run as a satellite operation of the 
Palmarejo mine and much of the existing infrastructure at Palmarejo will support the Guadalupe mine 
and material processing. 
 
The Palmarejo Final Tailings Dam is currently (2010) completed to the 790 elevation and has been 
accepting tailings since the fourth quarter of 2010.  The FTD dam crest will be continued to be built up 
over a three year period to the final design crest elevation 825 meters above sea level in 2014. The 
construction of the Environmental Control Dam (ECD) which is directly below the FTD and the 
construction of the FWDD were completed in 2009 and are currently in use. 
   
5.4 Physiography and Vegetation 
 
The Palmarejo District is located on the western flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental, a mountain 
range that comprises the central spine of northern Mexico. The Sierra Madre Occidental trends north-
northwest and is composed of a relatively flat-lying sequence of Tertiary volcanic rocks that forms a 
volcanic plateau. This volcanic plateau is deeply incised in the Palmarejo-Trogan project area, locally 
forming steep-walled canyons. The Sierra Madre Occidental gives way in the west to an extensional 
terrain that represents the southward continuation of the Basin and Range Province of the western 
United States, and then to the coastal plain of western Mexico. The property lies at the boundary of the 
volcanic plateau and Mexican Basin and Range Province (Gustin and Prenn, 2007).

The elevation of Palmarejo is about 1,150m above sea level, and the project area is hilly to 
mountainous (Figure 5.1), with densely vegetated, steep-sided slopes with local stands of cacti. 
Conifers occur at high elevations, while oak trees, cacti, and thorny shrubs dominate the vegetation at 
low elevations. Local ranchers and farmers graze cattle and grow corn and other vegetables on small-
scale plots.

SECTION 6 - HISTORY 
 
6.1 Pre-Planet Gold (Coeur) Exploration and Mining History 
 
The Palmarejo District area lies within the Témoris Mining District. The district is reported to have 
had large but poorly documented quantities of silver and gold production dating from Spanish colonial 
exploitation in the 1620's and continuing for approximately 70 years. Although local miners claim that 
mines such as Todos Santos, La Patria, Carmelite, and Guadalupe have been worked for over 100 
years, there are no known detailed records of their past production, and they are now abandoned. Many 
small adits and superficial workings along the district's two main mineralized structural trends, the 
Virginia and Guadalupe trends, attest to past mining activity.  
 
Spaniards may have mined high-grade near-surface ores at Palmarejo in the 1600s, although written 
reports state that the deposit was discovered in 1818. Small-scale production is reported intermittently 
through 1881, when a stamp mill was constructed at the mine site. The mine was purchased by the 
British company Palmarejo Mining Co. in 1886; the company was later renamed Palmarejo and 
Mexican GoldFields, Ltd. ("PMG"). From 1890 to 1892, PMG constructed a mill located two miles 
east of Chinipas, an aqueduct for power, and a railroad from the mine site to the mill. PMG operated 
the Palmarejo mine through 1910. 
 
There are no production records for the early period of mining at Palmarejo prior to 1909. McCarthy, a 
mining engineer hired by PMG to examine the mine in some detail and evaluate its future prospects, 
provides an "approximate estimate of the ore that has been taken out and milled in the past history of 
the mine" (McCarthy, 1909). He further notes that, "[t]his necessarily must be but an approximation 
owing to the want of proper records and plans, but which I believe to be correct within reasonable 
limits." McCarthy estimated the cumulative strike length of the old stopes and multiplied it by average 
dip lengths and widths of the stopes at La Prieta and La Blanca. These crude calculations resulted in an 
estimate of 562,000 short tons mined from the La Prieta vein and 175,000 short tons from the La 
Blanca structure up to 1909 (McCarthy, 1909). Converting these into metric tonnes using densities 
applied to the resource modeling discussed in Section 17 (McCarthy applied a lower density than used 
in the MDA model), these equate to 611,000 metric tonnes from La Prieta and 178,000 tonnes from La 
Blanca, for a total of 789,000 tonnes of production through 1909. 
 
Following recommendations outlined by McCarthy (1909), production from Palmarejo was halted, 
extensive developmental work was completed to ready the mine for renewed production, and a new 
mill was emplaced. PMG never resumed production due to the onset of the Mexican Revolution. The 
exact tonnage removed from Palmarejo as part of the development recommended by McCarthy is not 
known. McCarthy recommended 4,444m of development work, which is reported to have been 
completed. Assuming average dimensions of this development of 2m x 2m, which is consistent with 
information supplied by Jorge Cordoba (General Director of Operations at Palmarejo for Minas 
Huruapa, S.A. de C.V.; pers. comm. to Stuart Mathews, Coeur General Manager and Vice President, 
2007), McCarthy's recommendations would entail mining a total of about 46,000 tonnes. While this 
tonnage was mined for developmental reasons, essentially all of it is within modeled mineralization. 
 
Production at Palmarejo was resumed by Minas Huruapa, S.A. de C.V. (Huruapa) during the period 
from 1979 to 1992. Huruapa mined ore previously developed according to McCarthy's 
recommendations. Records newly provided by Jorge Cordoba, General Director of Operations for 
Huruapa at Palmarejo, indicate that Huruapa mined 168,352 tonnes of ore grading 297 g Ag/t and 1.37 
g Au/t (Table 6.1).

Planet Gold created a computer model of the mine workings at the Guadalupe mine, which is located 
within the Guadalupe Mineral Resources discussed in Section 17, based on historic plan maps. Historic 
reports suggest that approximately 3,700 tonnes of material grading 458 g Ag/t were mined at the 
Guadalupe mine, while the Planet Gold model suggests that about 5,900 tonnes were mined, including 
the developmental workings. 
 
Planet Gold also created a model of the La Patria mine workings, located within the La Patria Resource 
model (Section 17). Historic data, as well as visual inspection of accessible portions of the workings, 
suggest that the La Patria mine consisted of three levels. Accessible portions of the lowermost level 
have been surveyed by Planet Gold, and these data have been combined with historic maps to create 
the three-dimensional computer model. Old workings are also present at the La Virginia and Maclovia 
prospects. Accessible portions of these workings were surveyed by Planet Gold. 
 
The La Currita mine, located in the Guadalupe area, produced at a rate of about 100 tons per day from 
1985 to 1998. The silver-gold ore from the mine was processed at a 150-tons-per-day flotation mill 
that also received ore from other area mines (Laurent, 2004); production ceased at La Currita due to 
low metals prices. According to Laurent (2004), Kalahari Resources undertook exploration drilling at 
La Currita in 1991, while Silver Standard Resources Inc. completed additional drilling in 1998.   
 
High-grade gold-silver shoots at the Guerra-al-Tirano, La Virginia, and San Juan de Dios prospects 
were being mined intermittently by local miners until quite recently. These small underground mines 
did not use modern mining practices, with little grade control or constant production rates (Laurent, 
2004). Ore was trucked to a mill near the town of Los Llanos for flotation, with the concentrate sent 
for refining in Torreon, Coahuila. 
 
Other than the drilling at the La Currita mine mentioned above, the only other drilling known to have 
been completed within the Palmarejo property prior to that of Planet Gold is referred to by McCarthy 
(1909). McCarthy refers to five diamond-drill core ("core") holes drilled from stations in the 
underground workings at Palmarejo.

6.2 Planet Gold Exploration History 
 
Exploration undertaken by Planet Gold is summarized in Sections 9, 10, and 11. 
 
6.3 Historic Resource Estimates 
 
Several estimates in respect to mineralization at the Palmarejo mine were completed between 1909 and 
1996. There are insufficient details available on the procedures used in these estimates to permit Coeur 
to determine that any of the estimates meet modern regulatory standards, and none of the estimates are 
classified. Accordingly, these resource figures are presented here merely as an item of historical 
interest with respect to the exploration target and should not be construed as being representative of 
actual Mineral Reserves reported herein. 
 
Table 6.2 shows mineral inventory estimates, consisting of mineralized material lying between 
workings existing at the time, prepared by or for some of the companies who have been involved with 
the Palmarejo mine from 1909 to 1996. No drilling data are known to have been used for any of these 
calculations. The use of the term "reserve" in Table 6.2 is not consistent nor necessarily compliant with 
SEC Guide 7, Canadian National Instrument 43-101, nor JORC guidelines. They are included herein as 
a matter of historical reference only and have no bearing on the Mineral Reserves stated herein. 
 

Table 6.2: Pre-Planet Gold Estimates of "Reserves" for the Palmarejo Mine 
 

 
 
Prior NI 43-101 Compliant Mineral Resource Estimates 
 
NI 43-101-compliant resources for the Palmarejo project, using data from 106 reverse circulation 
("RC"), 11 core holes, and underground channel samples, were reported in the original Palmarejo 
technical report (Gustin, 2004; Table 6.3). As part of the site visit in 2004, MDA inspected numerous 
sites where the underground channel samples were collected. In most cases, the line of sample 
chipping could be discerned on the walls and backs of the workings. These samples were taken at high 
angles to the controlling mineralized structures, where practical.  The resource estimate shown in Table 
6.3 below was completed by MDA for Bonita Capital in December 2004.

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 38 of 245 

The Palmarejo resources were updated in October, 2005 using a database comprised of 291 RC holes, 
21 core holes, and 40 core continuations of RC holes (Gustin, 2005; Table 6.4).

recovery factor applied. 
 
The Palmarejo resources were updated again in May, 2006 using 527 RC holes, 117 core holes, and 88 
core continuations of RC holes, for a total of over 126,000m (Gustin, 2006; Table 6.5).

The first Mineral Resources for Guadalupe were also reported in October 2006 (Gustin, 2006; Table 
6.7) using the data from 17,487m of drilling, including 44 RC holes (7,954m) and 47 core holes 
(9,533m; includes 6 core continuations of RC holes).  Guadalupe Resources were updated in 
September 2007 (Gustin and Prenn, 2007; Table 6.8a and b) using the data from 17,487m of drilling, 
including 62 RC holes (7,954m) and 75 core holes (9,533m; includes 6 core continuations of RC 
holes).

The first Mineral Resources for La Patria were reported in September, 2007 (Table 6.9).  Gold and 
silver mineralization at La Patria was modeled by MDA in September 2007 using data generated by 
Planet Gold through late September 2006, including geologic mapping and RC and core drilling 
results. The resource calculation was done from 51,778 meters of drilling, including 81 RC holes 
(18,120m) and 100 core holes (33,658m).

SECTION 7 - GEOLOGIC SETTING 
 
7.1 Regional Geology 
 
The Palmarejo District lies near the western edge of the Sierra Madre Occidental, a north, northwest-
trending volcanic plateau that separates the southward extension of the Basin and Range Province of 
the southwestern United States into two parts; Sedlock et al. (1993) suggested calling these two areas 
of extension the Eastern and Western Mexican Basin and Range provinces. Palmarejo is near the 
boundary between the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Western Mexican Basin and Range Province. 
 
Basement rocks in the Sierra Madre Occidental are obscured by Cenozoic-aged volcanic flows, tuffs, 
and related intrusions but are inferred to include Proterozoic basement rocks, overlying Paleozoic shelf 
and eugeosynclinal sedimentary rocks, possibly scattered Triassic-Jurassic clastic rocks, and Mesozoic 
intrusions (Sedlock et al., 1993; Salas, 1991). The Palmarejo District area lies southwest of the west-
northwest- to northwest-trending Mojave-Sonora Megashear, along which an estimated 700 to 800km 
of left-lateral slip are thought to have occurred during the Jurassic (Silver and Anderson, 1974 and 
1983, and Anderson and Silver, 1979, cited by Sedlock et al., 1993). 
 
Cenozoic magmatic rocks in northern Mexico, including the Sierra Madre Occidental, are generally 
thought to reflect subduction-related continental arc magmatism that slowly migrated eastward during 
the early Tertiary and then retreated westward more quickly, reaching the western margin of the 
continent by the end of the Oligocene (Sedlock et al., 1993). The eastward migration is represented in 
the Sierra Madre Occidental by the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene Lower Volcanic Series (LVS), or 
Nacozari Group, of calc-alkaline composition. Over 2,000m of predominantly andesitic volcanic rocks, 
with some interlayered ash flows and associated intrusions, comprise the LVS. Rhyolitic ignimbrites 
and flows, with subordinate andesite, dacite, and basalt, formed during Eocene and Oligocene caldera 
eruptions. These volcanic rocks form a one-kilometer-thick unit that unconformably overlies the lower 
volcanic series andesitic rocks and constitutes the Upper Volcanic Supergroup of the Sierra Madre 
Occidental (Sedlock et al., 1993). The Upper Volcanic Supergroup is also commonly referred to as the 
"Upper Volcanic Series" (UVS), or Yecora Group. The ignimbrites are gently dipping to flat lying. As 
the magmatic arc retreated to the western edge of the continent, becoming inactive by the end of 
middle Miocene time, late Oligocene to Miocene (24-17 Ma) basaltic andesites were erupted in a back-
arc basin in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Still younger alkalic basalts related to Basin and Range 
extension are found in and east of the range. Although there appears to have been little late Cenozoic 
extension in the Sierra Madre Occidental itself, extensional Basin and Range-type structures and 
ranges formed to the east and west. 
 
In the Témoris mining district, the lowest exposed unit of the LVS consists of rhyolitic flows, 
volcaniclastic units, and related shallow intrusions. These are overlain by andesitic flows and epiclastic 
rocks with related andesitic porphyry intrusions. Local pillow lavas and limestone within the andesitic 
sequence attest to their deposition in a subaqueous environment (Corbett, 2004). Dacitic and rhyolitic 
intrusions, which in some areas are altered and appear to be closely associated with mineralization, are 
interpreted to be contemporaneous with the LVS. Cliff-forming rhyolitic ignimbrites of the Upper 
Volcanic Series are well exposed in the eastern and southern parts of the project area. 
 
Mineralization in the district, which is hosted in the LVS, may be synchronous with the upper dacite 
and rhyolite intrusions (Laurent, 2004). Mineralized veins are commonly within 500m of the 
unconformity with the Upper Volcanic Series (Masterman et al., 2005). The LVS exhibits regional 
propylitic alteration. 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 46 of 245 

 
Structural extension in the district takes the form of what are interpreted to be listric normal faults 
striking north-south to north-northwest, with west-northwest-trending flexures, as well as dilation of 
west-northwest-trending fractures, caused by strike-slip faulting (Corbett, 2004). 
 
A gold-silver metallogenic province that hosts low-sulfidation epithermal polymetallic gold-silver 
deposits lies along the western margin of the Sierra Madre Occidental (Figure 7.1). This province 
appears to exhibit a regional zonation of silver-rich deposits (Au:Ag ratios of 1:150) to the west and 
gold-rich deposits (Au:Ag of 1:40) to the east (Laurent, 2004). Palmarejo, a silver-rich deposit, lies in 
the western part of this province. 
 
The LVS is exposed in the central portions of the Palmarejo project, and the UVS is exposed in the 
northern, northeastern, and southwestern limits of the property (Figure 7.1).

7.2 Palmarejo Area 
 
The Palmarejo zone ore bodies are hosted in northwest striking and west dipping structures that cut 
through a volcano-sedimentary sequence of re-sedimented volcaniclastic, coherent and pyroclastic 
deposits.  The volcaniclastic rocks include ash-rich mudstones and sandstones.  The coherent rocks 
include microcrystalline massive basalt, fine grained massive andesite and plagioclase crystal rich 
massive andesite.  The pyroclastic unit includes tuffaceous sandstone, lapillistone tuff and breccias 
(Galvan, 2007). 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 48 of 245 

 
The Palmarejo Mineral Resources, described in Section 17, lie within and adjacent to the La Prieta and 
La Blanca structures (Figure 7.2). The La Prieta structure extends for at least two kilometers, has a 
variable strike that averages about 115°, and dips to the southwest at 35° to 85°.  
 
The La Blanca structure strikes about 160°, has an average dip of about 50° to the southwest, and is 
thought to be a listric normal fault (Corbett, 2004) that parallels the trend of the regional faults in the 
Sierra Madre Occidental. Masterman et al. (2005) estimated up to 300m of throw on the La Blanca 
fault. Faults with similar orientations are the most commonly mineralized structures in the Temoris 
district. 
 
A broad zone of mineralized quartz stockwork formed at the intersection of the La Blanca and La 
Prieta structures. North-trending splays from other north-northwest-striking structures at Palmarejo 
may offset both the La Blanca and La Prieta faults (Beckton, 2004).   
 

Figure 7.2: Geologic Map of the Palmarejo Area 
 

 
 
 
7.3 Guadalupe Area 
 
The Guadalupe zone is about seven kilometers southeast of Palmarejo and includes the Guadalupe 
Norte, Guadalupe, El Salto, and Las Animas prospects (Figure 7.3). It is located along the major 
northwest-trending (330°) structure that can be traced for approximately 3,000m along strike and has 
an average dip of approximately 55° to the northeast. Mapping by Stewart (2005) indicates both 
normal and strike-slip offset across the fault, with vertical displacement estimated to be at least a few 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 49 of 245 

hundred meters (Davies, 2007). Secondary west-northwest- and north-northeast-trending structures 
have been identified by surface mapping in the Guadalupe area (Laurent, 2004; Davies, 2007). 
 

Figure 7.3: Geologic Map of the Guadalupe Area 
 

 
 

The Guadalupe zone comprises silver- and gold-bearing quartz-carbonate veins hosted in a volcanic-
sedimentary package that is intruded by shallow andesitic porphyries and a felsic dome complex 
(Figure 7.4). The stratigraphic sequence of the volcanic-sedimentary package at Guadalupe is similar 
to that at Palmarejo with the exception of more abundant rhyolitic dikes, sills and domes. The 
Guadalupe hanging-wall block consists of predominantly flat-lying volcaniclastic sandstones, and 
conglomerates as well as andesite tuff that are locally underlain by amygdaloidal basaltic andesite. The 
footwall block comprises the lower thin-layered and fine grained volcaniclastic units and basaltic-
andesitic lavas. The felsic-dome complex intrudes both volcaniclastic blocks and the andesite 
porphyries and is characterized by flow-banded and porphyritic rhyolite dikes and domes. Contact 
breccias are locally developed along the margins of the dome. Talus deposits containing fragments of 
flow-banded and porphyritic rhyolite partially overlies the structure between Guadalupe and Las 
Animas.

Figure 7.4: Cross Section of the Guadalupe Structure  
(showing the relative position of the different lithologic units in relation to the vein) 

 
7.4 La Patria Area 
 
The La Patria zone is located about seven kilometers south-southeast of Palmarejo (Figure 7.1) and 
includes the La Patria, La Virginia, and Maclovia prospects (Figure 7.5). It is located within the 
northwest-trending La Patria – Todos Santos structure that can be traced for over 4,000m along strike. 
 
Prospects at the La Patria zone have a combined strike length of 1,700m and are spatially associated 
with sub parallel faults that strike predominantly northwest (335°) and dip approximately 45° to the 
northeast. Mapping suggests dominant displacement along the structure includes both normal and 
strike-slip movement (Davies, 2006). Several prospects, including Santa Ursula and Todos Santos, are 
located over several kilometers along strike to the northwest of the La Patria. 
 
The La Patria zone comprises gold- and silver-bearing quartz-carbonate veins hosted in a volcanic-
sedimentary package that is intruded by felsic dikes. The hanging-wall block consists of interlayered 
flat-lying amygdaloidal basalt, andesite porphyry, sandstones, mudstones, and conglomerates. The 
footwall block comprises porphyritic granodiorite, welded rhyolite ignimbrite, conglomerates, and the 
interlayered volcanic-sedimentary package. Felsic dikes with flow-banded and porphyritic textures 
intrude both the footwall and hanging-wall blocks.

SECTION 8 - DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
Mineralization in the Palmarejo district consists of epithermal, low-sulfidation, silver-gold carbonate 
vein and vein-breccia deposits with strong vertical zoning that occur within north-northwest-striking 
and west-northwest-striking structures. Early quartz-carbonate veins are locally overprinted by high-
level, high-grade silver-gold quartz veins.  This deposit type is common within the gold-silver 
metallogenic province of the Sierra Madre Occidental and accounts for much of the historic silver and 
gold production from the province. The silver and gold deposits are characterized by pervasive 
silicification, quartz-fill expansion breccias, and sheeted veins. Multiple stages of mineralization 
produced several phases of silica, ranging from chalcedony to comb quartz, and two periods of silver-
gold mineralization (Corbett, 2007). 
 
Low-sulfidation polymetallic silver-gold mineralization dominates the Palmarejo district (Figure 8.1, 
Corbett, 2005). This strongly zoned mineralization is characterized by pyrite, sphalerite, galena, and 
argentite (acanthite) deposited within the quartz vein/breccias at lower elevations and higher-grade 
precious-metals mineralization with fine-grained, black, silver-rich sulfide bands or breccia-infill in the 
upper portions of the structures. Much of the silver and gold mineralization is succeeded by the bulk of 
the quartz-vein material, which is weakly mineralized and tends to lie in the interior portion of the 
veins in the mineralized shoots.  Silicic, argillic, chloritic, and hematitic alteration were noted during 
underground and surface mapping throughout the district (Laurent, 2004). Gold is present as native 
gold and electrum, while silver occurs as acanthite, electrum/argentian gold, native silver, (Skeet, 
2004a, Townend and Associates, 2004,).  In 2009, additional petrographic work by Panterra 
Geoservices Inc. identified abundant copper-silver sulfides such as mckinstryite, jalpaite, stromeyerite 
and pearcite. (Ross, 2009)

Figure 8.1: Low Sulfidation Polymetallic Silver-Gold Mineralization   
 

 
 
The above figure shows spatial relationships to varying alteration and mineralization in low sulfidation 
systems such as Palmarejo and Guadalupe.  The Palmarejo and Guadalupe zones currently identified 
would fall within the Epithermal Quartz Au-Ag level, according to Corbett (2005).  
 



Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011 Page 54 of 245 
 

SECTION 9 - MINERALIZATION 
 
The Mineral Resources that are the focus of this report are located at Palmarejo, Guadalupe, and La 
Patria. The mineralization found in these areas is described first, followed by brief descriptions of 
mineralization located elsewhere in the Palmarejo District area. 
 
Host rocks are an important influence on vein formation at Palmarejo, especially competent brittle 
hosts that allow development of through-going fractures. Silicified laminated sandstones are 
particularly favorable hosts (examples of this include the 76, 108, Chapotillo, and parts of the Rosario 
clavos).  
 
Dilational portions of fault zones, such as flexures, link veins in fault jogs, or stockwork tension veins, 
favor development of mineralized shoots or clavos. Throughout the Palmarejo area, left-stepping 
(west-northwest) bends in the generally northwest-trending structures are particularly favorable sites 
for clavo development. Increased normal fault displacement also appears to be important, and 
structures such as Tres Cruces that have little normal fault displacement tend not to be well 
mineralized (Corbett, 2006). 
 
9.1 Palmarejo Area 
 
Gold-silver veins and vein/breccias occur within, and at the intersection of, the west-northwest-striking 
La Prieta structure and the north-northwest-striking La Blanca structure. Multiple stages of 
hydrothermal activity and mineralization filled these structures with quartz veins and formed quartz 
stockwork mineralization within the wedge of rock formed by the intersection of the structures. Both 
the La Prieta and La Blanca veins have polymetallic silver-gold vein/breccias with an epithermal 
silver-gold overprint that forms high-grade shoots in the steeper-dipping portions of the listric normal 
faults (Corbett, 2004). Early mining focused on the La Prieta vein, where high-grade silver 
mineralization was present as bands of fine-grained acanthite and galena within the vein. 
 
The Palmarejo mineralization can be divided into three domains: the La Prieta and La Blanca vein 
domains and the footwall and hanging-wall stockwork domain developed along each of the two vein 
domains.  The La Prieta vein domain consists of the La Prieta vein/breccia that dominated the historic 
production from the area. The La Prieta footwall domain encompasses quartz stockwork mineralization 
and silicification within epiclastic rocks and andesitic tuffs. The La Prieta hanging-wall domain 
consists of extensive sheeted-quartz-stockwork mineralization that is well exposed in the underground 
workings. The predominant geologic unit within this domain is the amygdaloidal andesite that lies 
between the La Prieta and La Blanca vein domains.  The La Blanca vein domain consists of the La 
Blanca vein/breccia, which lies between porphyritic andesite on the hanging wall and amygdaloidal 
andesite and andesitic tuffs on the footwall. The La Blanca hanging-wall domain includes quartz-
stockwork mineralization within the porphyritic andesite. 
 
Steeply plunging, high-grade clavos have been identified in each of the vein structures. The Rosario 
and 76 clavos contain the bulk of the mineralization at Palmarejo. The Rosario clavo lies at the 
intersection of the La Blanca and La Prieta veins and is up to 30m wide. The 76 clavo is a subvertically 
plunging shoot located at an inflection in the strike of the La Blanca structure. It terminates at depth as 
the structure flattens. The 108 clavo, also located on the La Blanca structure at its contact with 
silicified sandstone, is a gold-rich shoot. The Tucson and Chapotillo clavos lie within the La Prieta 
structure.

At Palmarejo, four tectonic-hydrothermal breccias have been identified that make up the main 
mineralized veins (Figure 9.1).  The breccias include (pictured below); a jigsaw-fit monomictic 
breccia, a massive cement-supported polymictic breccia, a massive, cemented, rotated lithic and vein 
fragment breccia and a matrix supported, chaotic polymictic breccia (Galvan, 2007).

Drilling by Planet Gold along the La Prieta vein structure has tested approximately 3.5km of strike 
length and has penetrated the structure over an elevation range of about 900 to 1250m.  
 
The Palmarejo silver and gold Resources discussed in Section 17 remain open for possible expansion 
in several areas. Drilling has tested the intersection zone of the La Prieta and La Blanca structures, 
referred to as the Rosario clavo, below the deepest mineralization intercepted in either of the principal 
structures. The presence of significant mineralization in the deep Rosario target has been demonstrated 
by hole PMDH522D, which returned 24.4m (true width of approximately 13m) grading 2.30 g Au/t 
and 196 g Ag/t in stockwork mineralization in the hanging wall of the La Blanca structure more than 
200 meters down plunge from the previously deepest intercept in the Rosario clavo.  
 
9.2 Guadalupe Area  
 
The Guadalupe project is located along a northeast-plunging structure that hosts the Guadalupe Norte, 
Guadalupe, and Las Animas Clavos (refer to Figure 7.3). These prospects with old mines and prospects 
occur over a four-kilometer strike length of the Guadalupe structure. 
 
The silver-gold (±base metals) mineralization at Guadalupe occurs predominantly within northwest-
trending quartz-carbonate breccia veins enveloped by variably developed quartz hydrothermal breccias 
and quartz-stockwork zones. The multiphase quartz-carbonate breccia veins have an average dip of 55° 
to the northeast and range in thickness from less than a meter to at least 20 meters (true width). 
Subparallel veins, vein splays and sigmodial loops of varying thicknesses are hosted in both the 
hanging-wall and footwall blocks.  Quartz-stockwork zones are typically developed in the hanging-
wall blocks or between closely-spaced subparallel quartz-carbonate-bearing structures.  
 
The quartz-carbonate breccia veins at Guadalupe are hosted in both the volcanic-sedimentary package 
as well as in the andesitic porphyries and the felsic-dome complex. Outcrop expressions of the 
structure are dominantly characterized by moderately to pervasively clay-altered wall rocks and 
laterally discontinuous quartz veins with thicknesses ranging from millimeters to a few meters. The 
clay-rich fault trace is best preserved at Guadalupe Norte (Figure 9.2). Beneath the clay-rich upper 
zone, the quartz-carbonate breccia vein swells up to 15m true width and is spatially associated with 
quartz-carbonate-pyrite-sericite-clay-epidote-chlorite alteration in the wall rock.

Figure 9.2: Photo Showing the Guadalupe Norte Clay Alteration 
 

 
 
Precious and base-metal mineral assemblages are dominated by fine-grained pyrite, argentite 
(acanthite), sphalerite, galena, and electrum. Free gold was found in some specimens that contain 
narrow semi-massive sulfide mineralization (Figure 9.3), hypogene hematite-siderite, or have been 
altered by supergene processes (Corbett, 2006).  
 

Figure 9.3: Photo Showing Sulfide Mineralization 
 (NQ core sample from hole TGDH 055 at 368 m, assaying 186 ppm Au and 3720 ppm Ag) 

 

 
 
Hypogene mineralization typically occurs as bands and disseminations in veins and, to a lesser extent, 
as 2 to 4cm wide semi-massive sulfide vein infill (Corbett, 2007). Clay-rich fault zones in the upper 
portion of the deposit are barren to poorly mineralized (Figure 9.6). Results from the drilling indicate 
that shallow levels of the structure are characterized by silver mineralization, while significant gold 
values are encountered at depths of about 200m vertical or greater (generally below 1300m elevation). 
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 58 of 245 

Figure 9.4: Photo Showing Mineralized Rhodochrosite 
(NQ core sample from hole TGDH 115 at 365 m, assaying 8 ppm Au and 410 ppm Ag) 

 

 
 
Corbett (2007) suggests multiphase silver-gold (± base metal) mineralization at Guadalupe comprises 
three main temporal and spatial styles, including: early gold-rich quartz-sulfide style mineralization 
typically developed at deeper levels; polymetallic silver-rich mineralization at intermediate levels 
characterized by pyrite-argentite (acanthite)-sphalerite-galena and minor chalcopyrite in the presence 
of several carbonate species (Figures 9.4 and 9.5) and hypogene hematite; and polymetallic silver-rich 
mineralization at shallow levels in the presence of abundant argentite (acanthite) and local electrum 
and free gold in association with white sphalerite and pyrite. 
 

Figure 9.5: Photo Showing Late-Deposited Carbonates 
(NQ core sample from hole TGDH 091 at 358.4 m) 

 

 
 
A barren clay-rich zone overlies silver-dominant mineralization in Guadalupe (Figure 9.6), and 
suggests a setting similar to that at the 76 clavo at Palmarejo.  Masterman (2006) noted early drilling 
by Planet Gold intersected well-mineralized, silver-dominated quartz-carbonate breccia veins between 
the clay alteration zone and the 1,300m elevation. Deep drilling down-dip of the silver-rich portion of 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 59 of 245 

the system has delineated several wide zones with strongly mineralized gold-silver breccia veins 
located predominantly between the 1,300 and 1,100 m elevation levels. These results, in addition to 
surface geological interpretations, suggest that Guadalupe target represents the highest levels of a fully 
preserved epithermal system. 
 

Figure 9.6: Poorly Mineralized Structure at Surface and Clay Alteration at Guadalupe Norte. 
 

 
 
9.3 La Patria 
 
Prospects at the La Patria zone have a combined strike length of 1,700m and are spatially associated 
with subparallel faults that strike predominantly northwest (335°) and dip approximately 45° to the 
northeast. Mapping suggests dominant displacement along the structure includes both normal and 
strike-slip movement (Davies, 2006).  
 
The mineralization is hosted in a quart-vein breccia unit with enriched proximal dense stockwork. Well 
formed pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite is found within the darker grey (high temperature) 
quartz veining. Visible gold is present in many samples observed as native gold and electrum. 
Oxidation is prevalent with goethite/limonite developed in pyrite pseudomorphs. 
 
The Quartz-vein Breccia unit lies within a typical normal extension fault with apparent preferential 
mineralization at the intersection lineation between the NW (335°/58°) east dipping regional structure 
and the WNW (300°/75°) cross structures. 
 
There is up to 800m of strike traceable on surface from Virginia to the south through to La Patria to the 
north. The average width of the Quartz-vein breccia is 4m wide.  The degree of oxidation is important 
and may increase the potential for oxide-ore, open-cut mining. 
 
Maclovia is located ~500m south-southeast of La Patria and immediately northeast of and beneath the 
1600m high Cerro Guerra al Tirano.  The prospects are located on both sides of a 200m deep steeply 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 60 of 245 

incised valley, elevations are between 1100 & 1300m.  The series of structures that make up Maclovia 
have been intermittently worked, possibly as early as the days of the Spanish Conquistadors and more 
recently in the middle of the 20th century.   
 
At Maclovia the main north-northwest trending structure which also hosts the Virginia, La Patria, 
Santa Ursula and Todos Santos prospects to the north bifurcates into 6 or 7 narrow, high-grade, 
structures.  The individual structures are between 0.1 and 2.5m wide, nominally <1.0m, and are 
vertically continuous for more than 100m. The strike varies from northwest to almost north – south and 
the dips range from 50°SW to 80°E.   
 
Typically the structures are characterized by intensely silicified and brecciated colloform banded 
quartz veins hosted in silicified andesite; pyrite is common often up to 5mm and was observed at most 
locations.  Alteration of the host rock adjacent to the veining/structure is silicic and includes minor 
pyrite.  More distal, >2m, the andesitic rocks are strongly argillized with rare quartz veinlets and minor 
(absent) silicification, no economic gold or silver grades were recorded from the host. 
 
9.4 Other Areas of Mineralization 
 
Palmarejo Norte 
Six RC holes, for a total of 791m, were drilled along the northwest extension of the La Blanca 
structure approximately one-kilometer northwest of the limit of the Palmarejo Resources at the 
intersection of the La Blanca and La Prieta structures. The holes did not encounter significant 
mineralization. 
 
Los Bancos 
Los Bancos is an argillic bloom located 1 km north of Guadalupe Norte and 1 km southeast of San 
Juan de Dios. Alteration is similar to that found above Guadalupe Norte and the 76 Clavo in Palmarejo 
which suggests the presence of blind mineralization. In 2007, 26 "wildcat" RC holes were drilled 
totalizing 7,568.19 m, four of these holes hit vein presumably tracing a northwest-trending plane. 
Grades and thickness clearly increase with depth. An intercept from hole LBDH-25 returned 30.48 m 
(not true thickness) grading 1.55 g Au/t and 259 g Ag/t, including 1.52 m grading 18.15 g Au/t and 
1,680 g Ag/t. 
 
Follow up diamond core drilling in 2009 confirmed the existence of a mineralized vein at Los Bancos.  
During 2009, five diamond core holes were drilled for a total of 1,762 meters.  All holes intercepted 
mineralized quartz vein structures ranging from a true thickness of 0.8 to 2.8 meters.  The highest 
grade intercept was a true thickness of 1.4 meters at 9.64 grams per tonne gold and 1,090.0 grams per 
tonne silver. 
 
Field reconnaissance work in the area has led to the identification of several veins whose width ranges 
from 0.5 to 2.0 m with grades up to 1.5 g Au/t and 150 g Ag/t at low elevations, and up to 10 m 
stockwork zones in the surface projection of the Los Bancos vein with no significant grades. 
Suggesting the presence of a well preserved epithermal system with no mineralization exposed at the 
surface, similar to Guadalupe Norte and the 76 Clavo.  Due to the preservation of the epithermal 
system surface exposures only contain minor mineralization but metal grades dramatically increase 
with depth. 
  



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 61 of 245 

 
San Juan de Dios 
The San Juan Area is located 2.3 km due SE from Palmarejo.  A set of veins in this area had been 
identified by field reconnaissance where mapping and sampling geologic programs were developed.  
The San Juan structure trends N40°W; dips are variable from 54° to 74° to the SW.  The mineralization 
in San Juan is represented by a set of veins up to 2.5 m thick in exposures, but dominant thicknesses 
are in the range of less than 1 m as observed in the old mine workings. 
 
The results obtained from the surface sampling of vein outcrops in the area show grades of up to 3.1 g/t 
Au and 287 g/t Ag, containing anomalous copper, lead and zinc values.  Several old shafts and adits 
were developed by earlier gambusinos, the deepest, called San Juan and El  Zapote, were built as deep 
as 60 m . Drill-holes at this location intercepted a mineralized zone, 7.2 m in width, which is composed 
of thin veins ranging in thickness from 0.30 to 1.1 m; gangue minerals include quartz-carbonates.  The 
veins are associated at least in space to earlier rhyolitic dikes that crosscut the KTAL lithological unit.  
It is inferred that the rhyolitic dikes pre-date the vein mineralization, since crosscutting relationships of 
quartz and visible sulphides show that mineralization is hosted in the vein itself, as well as in the 
Kaolin-altered rhyolitic intrusives as disseminations. 
 
During the 2010 drilling campaign, fifteen holes were executed in the San Juan area.  Diamond core 
drilling was conducted to investigate 1,100 m of vein strike length, from San Juan to El Rincón zone.

SECTION 10 - EXPLORATION 
 
10.1 Planet Gold Exploration, 2003-2007 
 
In January and February of 2003, Hall Stewart conducted a reconnaissance study on behalf of Planet 
Gold (Coeur's operating company) in the Palmarejo-Trogan area. Stewart's work led to Planet Gold's 
submission of the Trogan application and the initiation of negotiations on internal claims. Detailed 
field investigations by Planet Gold began immediately following the signing of the Corporación 
Minera de Palmarejo (Ruben Rodriguez Villegas) agreement in June 2003. 
 
Reconnaissance surface mapping, trenching, and underground sampling and mapping on known 
prospects within the project area led to the identification of significant precious metal anomalies in the 
Palmarejo area (Beckton, 2004). A more focused trenching and underground sampling effort was then 
undertaken at Palmarejo, and drill testing commenced in November 2003 with a single reverse-
circulation rig. 
 
A total of 286 underground channel samples from the 6, 7, and 8 levels of the La Prieta workings were 
collected by Planet Gold through September 2004 (Table 10.1). Mapping of the stratigraphy, structure, 
and alteration in these levels was also completed. Surveying of the Palmarejo underground workings 
commenced in October 2004. Planet Gold collected 79 channel samples from underground workings in 
nine prospect areas in other portions of the project through September 2004 (Laurent, 2004).

Sixty-eight surface trenches, for a total of about 1500m, were excavated and sampled by Planet Gold 
as part of the reconnaissance of the Trogan area through June 2005 (G. Masterman, pers. comm., 2005; 
Beckton, 2004a; Laurent, 2004). These trenches varied in length from one to 116m. An additional 43 
trenches were completed at Palmarejo for a total of 927m. The trenches were completed with picks and 
shovels to a depth of up to one meter, with samples typically chipped over three-meter intervals. The 
trenches were mapped for lithology, alteration, structural controls of mineralization, oxidation, and 
stratigraphy. The results from the trench sampling were not used in the Resource estimations. 
Additional rock chip, mine dump, and select geochemical samples from various parts of the project 
area were also collected and assayed (Laurent, 2004).  
 
Drilling by Planet Gold on the Palmarejo-Trogan project was initiated in November 2003 at Palmarejo. 
The La Prieta vein structure was drill tested first, as the most extensive historic mining occurred within 
this structure. Drilling then progressed to testing both the La Prieta and La Blanca structures, with 
focused drilling undertaken in the areas of the Rosario, Tucson, Chapotillo, 76 and 108 mineralized 
shoots. Additional details of the Palmarejo drilling program are discussed in Section 11. 
 
Planet Gold collected almost 2,200 shortwave infrared ("SWIR") spectral measurements from drill 
samples from holes on a series of sections across the La Blanca and La Prieta structures using an ASD 
Terraspec instrument. An additional 500 SWIR spectra were measured as part of a regional alteration-



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 63 of 245 

mapping program on the Trogan project. A new exploration model using structural and stratigraphic 
targets, high-level clay mineralogy, and the silver-gold and pathfinder-element geochemistry was 
developed from these data and is being applied throughout the Palmarejo-Trogan exploration 
programs. 
 
Four hundred forty drill samples from Guadalupe were analyzed for a 50-element suite by combination 
ICP-MS and ICP-AES. The goal of these geochemical analyses was to evaluate vertical and lateral 
zoning of major and trace elements in the mineralized shoots at Guadalupe. 
 
One hundred and eighty-six Palmarejo drill samples and 282 trench-sample pulps were analyzed for a 
50-element suite by combination ICP-MS and ICP-AES. A further 440 drill samples from Guadalupe 
were similarly analyzed. The goal of these geochemical analyses was to evaluate vertical and lateral 
zoning of major and trace elements in the mineralized shoots at Palmarejo and Guadalupe. 
 
Planet Gold completed geological mapping and 30m of trenching in 2005 at Guadalupe, which 
identified a series of structural drill targets. Since that time, 229 holes have been drilled at Guadalupe, 
for a total of 70,331.55 m. This drilling has defined the structure for over two kilometers along strike 
and an elevation range of 1420 to 950 m. 
 
Preliminary surface and underground chip sampling of the quartz vein/breccia at La Patria returned 1 
to 5 g Au/t and 20 to 100 g Ag/t. Based on this initial regional evaluation and encouraging trench-
sample results, Planet Gold originally assigned a higher priority to the La Patria-Virginia structure than 
to Palmarejo. Since 2004, Planet Gold has completed geological mapping, rock-chip sampling, and 
179.5m of trenching (both surface and underground) from which a series of structural-geochemical 
drill targets were identified. Following this work, Planet Gold began drill testing the La Patria target 
area in November 2005. A total of 121 holes (25,867m) have been drilled at the La Patria project. This 
drilling has tested and defined the structure for approximately 1,700m along strike and an elevation 
range of 1464 to 1020m. 
 
Results of Planet Gold's exploration programs outside of the Palmarejo, Guadalupe, and La Patria 
project areas, including the drilling undertaken at La Finca, San Juan de Dios, Todos Santos – 
Canadensia, Cerro de Los Hilos, Cerro de Los Hilos SE, Guerra al Tirano, and Los Bancos are 
summarized in Section 9.  The Palmarejo, Guadalupe, and La Patria Resources are discussed in Section 
17. 
 
As of December 2007, Planet Gold had completed 180 trenches, for a total of 3,960m, and 1,135 drill 
holes, for a total of 246,830.9 m, within the Palmarejo-Trogan property. A total of 1,429 samples were 
collected from the trenches, and 800m of underground channel sampling was completed (365 
samples).  A total of 1,135 holes, for 246,830.9 m, had been drilled in the various target areas of the 
project, including 27 geotechnical holes (494m) drilled at Palmarejo. 
 
10.2 Coeur Exploration 2008-Present 
 
Since January 2008, Coeur Exploration has continued to conduct exploration drilling at Guadalupe. 
Table 10.2 summarizes drilling and sampling activities at Guadalupe from January 2008 to December 
2010. 
 
Exploration and development drilling at Palmarejo in 2008, 2009 and 2010 was done by Coeur 
Mexicana Operations and is summarized in Section 11 and in Table 10.2.  Coeur Mexicana Operations

has also continued channel sampling at Palmarejo in 2008, 2009 and 2010 in conjunction with daily 
operations.  RC drilling was conducted as part of the open pit ore control program and condemnation 
drilling, with a few infill (Category 3) holes.  The Palmarejo deposit resource estimate was updated in 
2010 using data collected from 2003 to 2010 (see Section 17).  The Guadalupe Resource reported 
herein has utilized data from 2005 to 2010 (see Section 17 and Table 11.7).

11.4 Core Drilling and Logging 
 
 
Diamond core drilling was carried out by Layne, Major, and Perforaciones Godbe de Mexico, S.A. de 
C.V. ("Godbe").   Layne used a CS-1000 skid-mounted wireline rig, while Godbe used a truck-
mounted Longyear Super 38 Sidewinder wireline rig. The CS-1000 was set up to drill HQ-diameter 
core with the ability to reduce to NQ if necessary (MDA, 2007). 
 
Major initially sent a Boyles 20 (B-20) skid-mounted wireline core-rig to Palmarejo in September 
2005. This rig could drill HQ-diameter core with the ability to reduce to NQ if necessary. The depth 
capability of the rig was restricted, however, and it was subsequently replaced by a skid-mounted 
wireline Longyear 44 core rig ("LY-44") in December 2005. The LY-44 has a capacity of drilling PQ 
to depths of 230m before needing to reduce to HQ. Major also sent a Universal Directional Rig 200 
("UDR-200") skid-mounted wireline core-rig to Palmarejo in January 2006. Like the LY-44, this rig 
has a capacity of drilling PQ to depths of 230m before reducing to HQ. In August 2006, both the LY44 
and UDR-200 were sent to Guadalupe (MDA, 2007).  
 
In June 2005, Major sent a Boart Longyear ("BLY-38") skid-mounted wireline core rig to Guadalupe, 
this drill is able to drill HQ-diameter core with the ability to reduce to NQ. In June 2006, The BLY-38 
was sent to the La Patria area (MDA, 2007). 
 
Major also sent two Major 50 track-mounted wireline core rigs to Guadalupe, one in April and the 
other in July 2007. Both Major 50 rigs have a capacity of drilling PQ to depths of 280m before needing 
to reduce to HQ.   Major's annual contract was not renewed in January 2008 and Major completed its 
contract drilling in March 2008.  
 
A new contract was signed in January 2008 with G4 Forage Drilling, headquartered in Val-d'Or, 
Quebec, Canada in May of 2008, and an additional contract was signed with Landdrill International 
Mexico from Hermosillo, Mexico in July of 2008.  During 2008, two to three diamond core rigs of G4 
Forage were drilling at Guadalupe or Palmarejo and one diamond core rig of Landdrill was drilling at 
Guadalupe.  Landrill International continued drilling in the first quarter of 2009 and then demmobilzed 
when their contract was completed.  G4 Forage continued to drill at Guadalupe and other district 
exploration targets in 2009 and 2010. The rig used was a wireline skid mounted-type Forage-G-
Drilling, model HTM 2500. During 2010 GDA Servicios Mineros SA de CV, a Chilean drilling 
company, was contracted to perform the drilling at the Palmarejo Mine site.   



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 68 of 245 

 
Water for the Palmarejo core drilling is supplied by water truck from Palmarejo Creek and/or pump 
and water line running from the creek. Water at Guadalupe is supplied by water truck from the old mill 
at Arroyo Blanco and from a creek at Los Llanos. 
 
The core holes that were collared at the surface recovered HQ or PQ core, unless the intersection of 
voids or down-hole drilling problems were encountered, in which case the drillers reduced to NQ or 
HQ, respectively. The core tails, which were drilled when RC holes were terminated prematurely due 
to encountering groundwater and/or down-hole problems, recovered NQ or HQ core (MDA, 2007). 
 
Diamond-core holes were logged for geotechnical data and geology, including rock type, alteration, 
mineralization assemblages, vein-quartz percentage, and oxidation. Graphic logs were also created for 
stratigraphy, vein orientation, and visual identification of mineralized zones. Digital photographs of 
wetted core were taken and initially archived at the field offices. Holes were re-logged by a second 
geologist following receipt of assay results to validate data. 
 
A new descriptive system of logging volcanic lithologies and breccia textures and mineralization from 
CODES (Centre of Excellence in Ore Deposits, Tasmania) and MDRU (Mineral Deposit Research 
Unit, British Columbia) has been adopted by Coeur.  The system allows for more consistent logging of 
geology and is entered into an AcQuire database for documentation.  The data is also exported into 
three-dimensional modeling software for further understanding of the geology and mineral controls. 
 
All core at Palmarejo was moved to the new Guadalupe exploration area during 2008.  The facility 
consists of a covered and secured storage building, a covered logging and sampling area, two enclosed 
core cutting saws and a three room office building with a room for the resident watchman. All core is 
photographed and photos are available and well organized at the Chihuahua office for exploration core 
and at the mine site for operations core.   
 
As part of the mine construction a new core logging and geologic office facility was built at the 
Palmarejo mine site.  This facility consists of fully enclosed logging, cutting and sampling areas and 
geologic offices. 
 
11.5 Reverse Circulation Drilling and Logging 
 
MDA (Gustin and Prenn, 2007) stated that RC drilling was carried out by Layne de Mexico, S.A. de 
C.V. (Layne), Dateline, S.A. de C.V. (Dateline), and Major Drilling, S.A. de C.V. (Major). Layne used 
two rigs at Palmarejo, a Drill Systems W-750 buggy-mounted all-terrain rig and a Drill Systems track 
drill MPD-1500 all-terrain drill. The W-750 buggy rig is equipped with an air compressor delivering 
900 cubic feet per minute (CFM) free air at 350 pounds per square inch (PSI), a RC system for drilling 
with dual-tube drill pipe, and a hydraulically controlled water-injection system. The MPD-1500 track 
rig is equipped with an air compressor delivering 750 CFM free air at 350 PSI, a reverse circulation 
system for drilling with 3 3/4 inch outside diameter by two-inch inside diameter dual-tube drill pipe, 
and a hydraulically controlled water-injection system. The MPD-1500 was only used for six months 
due to frequent mechanical failures. 
 
MDA (Gustin and Prenn, 2007) stated that the Dateline rigs began drilling on the Palmarejo District in 
late 2004. Both Dateline drill rigs were equipped with 350-PSI 750/900-CFM Sullair compressors, 
cyclone assemblies, and at least 250 m of drill pipe. Major used three rigs, a track-mounted Schramm-
685 all-terrain rig, a Prospector buggy-mounted all-terrain drill, and an Explorer track-mounted all-



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 69 of 245 

terrain drill. These rigs were brought into the project due to their capacity for relatively deep drilling 
while maintaining sample quality. The Explorer rig drilled at Palmarejo between February and August 
2007. 
 
During 2008-2010, no exploration RC drilling was conducted (see Section 12.3 for RC drilling 
conducted).  Previous RC drilling on the project used center-return hammer bits. If dictated by the 
geologic or groundwater conditions, an interchange hammer, full-bore tricone, or button bit was used. 
The water table in the project area is variable due to the topographic relief. RC holes were terminated if 
the sample exiting the cyclone became wet due to ground water, and the holes were completed with a 
core tail where applicable or twinned by a diamond core rig. 
 
The RC drill chips were logged for stratigraphy, alteration, weathering degree, quartz percent, and 
metallic minerals to aid in geological and sectional interpretation. Representative RC drill chips were 
collected in chip trays and stored at Palmarejo office or the Arroyo Blanco storage (now stored at the 
Guadalupe core storage facility) for geologic logging. Holes were re-logged by a second geologist 
following receipt of assay results to validate the original logged data (MDA, 2007).  
 
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 70 of 245 

SECTION 12 - SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
12.1 Summary 
 
The core in the Palmarejo district is being sampled only in the intervals suspected to contain metal 
mineralization. Where the rock displays minor alteration and/or quartz-carbonate veinlets, the standard 
sample interval is one meter.  In a section where the core has intersected a strongly mineralized 
structure, sampling is reduced to a nominal 0.5 meter interval but can vary depending on the 
mineralogical changes.  When structure is clearly broken into different veins or domains, it is sampled 
separately at contacts and sample intervals may be less than 0.5 meters. 
 
Reverse circulation (RVC or RC) holes used the Palmarejo resource model were sampled every five 
feet (1.52 m) down the hole.  Holes that were drilled in a new area were sampled along the entire 
length of the hole.  In-fill or close-spaced holes were sampled at 5 foot intervals through zones of 
suspected mineralization.  As a standard procedure, only material from dry drilling was being sampled 
and once the water table was intersected the RVC hole was stopped and usually continued with core. 
 
12.2 Diamond Drilling 
 
The core is removed from the core barrel and placed into wooden boxes in the case of PQ core and 
plastic boxes for HQ and NQ core. All breaks of the core made by the drillers are marked in order to 
assist in the differentiation of natural vs. manmade fractures. On selected Palmarejo holes, the core 
driller marked an orientation at the top of the core run prior to retrieving the core barrel with a spear-
system that is sent by wireline. The core barrel is then retrieved and placed into core boxes. 
 
At the core shed, the core was first pieced together by a geologist or technician, with the orientation 
mark facing up (if applicable). Cut lines were then traced along the core axis when HQ diameter 
surafeces drill cores were logged, sample intervals were marked on the core, and the intervals were 
assigned sample numbers. The sample lengths for wall rock average 1.5 m at Palmarejo and 
Guadalupe. Suspected mineralized zones were sampled at intervals averaging about 0.5 m. at all 
projects before Coeur's acquisition.  Since Coeur performed exploration at Guadalupe suspected 
mineralized zones were sampled at intervals averaging about 0.75 m.  Sample lengths were variably 
adjusted by the supervising geologist to avoid sampling across geological contacts. Digital 
photographs of wetted core were taken and the core was then sawed into two halves along the cut lines. 
The half of the core to the right of the orientation line was chosen for assaying and placed in a 
numbered bag along with a sample tag. A duplicate tag was kept in the sample-tag book and archived 
at the Palmarejo field office. The left side of the core was retained in the core boxes on site. 
 
During 2010, the selected diameter for sampling was HQ for surface drilling and NQ for underground 
drilling. The sample length for mineralized zones ranges from 0.30m to 1m at Palmarejo. Underground 
drilling included production ore control and definition drilling as well as infill holes to bring inferred 
resources to indicated or measured status.  For surface drilling, HQ diameter core samples were saw-
split. Half of the sample was bagged and tagged, the remaining half of the core was returned to the 
wooden box for storage.  Underground NQ diameter core samples were bagged in their entirety in 
order to reduce sample variability due to the small sample provided by NQ diameter cores.  
 
Exploration and infill drilling at Guadalupe and other exploration targets during 2010 was conducted 
using HQ diameter core.  The core was laid out and logged under a shed facility on wooden tables. The 
selected core samples, which vary from 0.4m to 1.5m, were saw-split, and half of the sample was 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 71 of 245 

bagged and tagged; the remaining half of the core was returned to the plastic box for storage.  All 
remaining core is organized in metallic racks inside a fully-covered warehouse.  QAQC samples 
standards, blanks and duplicates are inserted and bagged and tagged by the geologist in charge. 
 
12.3 Reverse Circulation Drilling 
 
RC chips were recovered up through the center of the double-wall pipe, and the sample was discharged 
at the surface via a cyclone directly onto a contractor-supplied three-tiered Jones splitter. If 
groundwater caused the sample exiting the cyclone to be wet, and the hole could not be dried with the 
addition of a compressed air booster, the sampling was halted, the RC portion of the hole was 
terminated, and any continuation of the hole was completed by coring. The depth at which 
groundwater water was encountered was logged by the supervising geologist. 
 
Each entire 1.52 m sample was collected into a cyclone and then released into a hopper into a Gilson, 
riffle-type splitter. The sample was initially split so that half of the material was discarded. The 
remaining half was split in half again, and each of these quarter splits were poured directly from the 
splitter pans into buckets containing sample bags. The sample numbers were recorded as the drilling 
progressed by a geologist that supervised the RC drilling. One quarter split was used as the sample for 
assaying and the other was stored as an archive duplicate. Once bagged, the samples were placed in 
order on the ground near the drill. All samples to be submitted for analyses were placed at a collection 
point on the drill pad for the weekly pickup by a sample truck sent by the assay lab. 
 
Past studies of core and RC twin holes at Palmarejo have suggested a low bias (-30%) to the core 
samples because of local poor recovery in faulted/crumbly and oxidized mineralized zones, most 
notably in the Rosario area at the intersection of the La Blanca and La Prieta vein structures.  AMEC 
(2008) analyzed the assay results of both core and RC samples and has concluded that there are no 
obvious deficiencies with the Ag and Au assay data.  The Qualified Persons have reviewed the AMEC 
results and are in agreement with AMEC that the data are sufficiently accurate for resource estimation 
and classification purposes. 
 
During the 2008-2010 mine operations, RC drilling has been conducted at the Palmarejo Mine for ore 
control purposes only, with the exception of condemnation drilling in 2008 and some infill exploration 
holes.  The drilling and sampling procedure described above was used, with sampling at 1.52 m  
intervals.  The RC drilling is conducted on a 10 meter grid in pit areas. Areas evaluated with RC 
drilling include Rosario, Tucson and Chapotillo. The rig performing the drilling at Palmarejo is a 
Company-owned Atlas Copco, model Rock L-8.  The rock chips are recovered up through the center of 
the double-wall pipe, and the sample is discharged at the surface via a cyclone directly, then bagged 
and tagged.  During 2010, 2,004 RC ore control holes were completed at the Palmarejo Mine, and 
35,703 samples were submitted to the Palmarejo site lab run by SGS.

SECTION 13 - SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS, AND SECURITY  
 
13.1 Historic QA/QC and Third Party Reviews 
 
The results of all pre-Coeur QA/QC programs on drilling conducted by Bolnisi and Planet Gold have 
been reviewed by independent third parties, whose findings are summarized in this section.  
 
Keith Blair of Applied Geoscience LLC, studied the results of the quality assurance/quality control 
("QA/QC") program implemented by Planet Gold for the Palmarejo, Guadalupe, and La Patria projects 
(Blair, 2005; Blair, 2006; Blair, 2007) and the quality assurance/quality control ("QA/QC") program at 
the Guadalupe project for data collected from July, 2005 to March, 2008. The data reviewed by Mr. 
Blair includes reference sample results, duplicate sample and duplicate assay results, and second-
laboratory check assays. The main goal of Blair's studies is to assess and comment on the quality of the 
assay data for the projects. 
 
The data and discussions presented in this section are quoted directly or derived entirely from MDA's 
2007 Palmarejo Technical Report that summarizes Blair's study of the Palmarejo project (Blair, 2006), 
and the Guadalupe (Blair, 2008) and La Patria projects (Blair, 2007), unless otherwise noted. The Blair 
2006 report is an update to a review he completed previously for the Palmarejo project (Blair, 2005). 
Blair's review for Guadalupe reviews information for the drilling conducted from July, 2005 up to 
March, 2008.   Blair's 2007 report presents the first QA/QC review of the La Patria project. Mr. Blair 
is a Qualified Person under Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101, and he is 
independent of Coeur, Planet Gold, Palmarejo Silver and Gold, and Bolnisi. 
 
As part of the MDA (Gustin, 2004) technical review of the Palmarejo project in 2004, 21 samples from 
two RC holes were selected and splits of the original sample were sent to Chemex for analysis using 
the preparation and assay protocol used by the project. MDA concluded that the results for both metals 
show good agreement; there is no apparent bias to either metal.  
 
AMEC Mining and Metals also conducted a review of Palmarejo data during 2008, which is 
summarized in this section.  
 
13.1.1 Historic Palmarejo QA/QC Program Review by Applied Geoscience, LLC. 
 
A total of 557 Chemex assay reports for Palmarejo, covering the period of December 4, 2003 to 
September 12, 2006, were reviewed by Keith Blair of Applied Geoscience LLC (2006).  The following 
is a summary of the Palmarejo QA/QC review taken from the MDA Technical Report (2007).  For 
more information, please see Section 21. 
 
Review of Blank Analyses 
Blank-sample results were mostly acceptable for gold, with only 10 of the 999 blank assays containing 
detectable metal greater than 3 times the detection limit for the analytical method and 4 instances being 
greater than 5 times the detection limit. Blank sample results for silver show 8 of 999 instances with 
detectable metal greater than 3 times the detection limit for the analytical method and 5 of 999 
instances being greater than 5 times the detection limit. The field blank material used during the period 
had not been characterized, so it is likely that the material contained minor mineralized material. 
 
  



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 73 of 245 

Review of Standards Analyses 
Nine analytical standards were used to evaluate the analytical accuracy of the assay laboratory: one 
blank composed of core from non-mineralized drill intervals from the project, 4 standards from Ore 
Research (including 2 chip standards), three standards from Rocklabs, one custom standard of 
mineralized material from Palmarejo (PJO1), and one internal standard from ALS-Chemex.  All but 
the two chip standards had certified gold and silver values. 
 
A low bias was apparent in the 2 chip standards, which could be due to the high level of other metals in 
the material. These reference samples have anomalous arsenic (1000-2000 ppm) and antimony (120-
160 ppm) that could be suppressing gold during fire assaying. Use of the chip standards was 
discontinued in late 2005.    Standard OREAS-33 was used only during Feburary and March 2005.  
Use of OREAS-33 was discontinued due to the inappropriate high base metal content matrix.  
Analytical standards were used to evaluate the analytical accuracy of the assay laboratory.  A low bias 
was apparent in chip standards, which could be due to the high level of other metals in the material. 
These reference samples have anomalous arsenic (1000-2000 ppm) and antimony (120160 ppm) that 
could be suppressing gold during fire assay.  Other standards showed some scatter but no systematic 
bias, with the exception of two: PJO1 and BPL-4.  Standard PJO1, a custom standard with the highest 
silver grade of all the project standards, 258 g/t Ag, showed a slight low bias in Ag analyses, with four 
reports outside the -2 standard-deviation limit.  Standard BPL-04 is an internal standard to ALS-
Chemex with high expected values for both gold (47 g Au/t) and silver (682 g Ag/t). Gold results are 
variable but show no systematic bias at the mean. The calculated mean for silver shows a slight low 
bias, but is within accepted limits. Most of the anomalous silver instances are below the -2 standard-
deviation limit and give an overall low sense to the data set. 
 
Review of Duplicate Samples 
Duplicate samples can be used to evaluate the grade variance introduced by inherent geologic 
variability, sample size, or introduced sampling biases.  For 2003-2006, the Palmarejo project had a 
large data set of gold and silver analyses of duplicate samples. Duplicate samples were collected at the 
drill during RC drilling; these are referred to as rig-resplit duplicates. The rig resplit duplicates were 
collected using a 1:100 sample ratio while drilling.  Duplicate samples from core were collected as 
splits from the coarse preparation rejects of Chemex.  
 
For the different duplicate sample and assay groups, metal statistics are influenced by a large number 
of below detection limit results. Below detection results were set to one-half of the detection limit or 
0.025 g Au/t for gold and 2.5 g Ag/t for silver. 
 
The data showed very good agreement for both gold and silver, but with some scatter in the lower 
portions of each distribution. The agreement between the duplicate assays is very good within the 
grade range of interest (> 1g Au/t gold and >30 g Ag/t silver).  Rig-resplit duplicates show fair 
agreement but with some scatter in the lower portions of the distributions. 
 
Part of the internal QA/QC program at Chemex is random check assaying of samples in each assay job.  
Results showed good agreement with a few outliers noted for silver. The scatter in the lower portions 
of the data reflect the low resolution of the assay method at levels slightly above the detection limit to 
approximately 3 to 5 times the detection limit for both metals. The method variance at these levels is 
important when evaluating reference-sample results with expected values in this range. Most of the 
silver standards used by the project are in this three to five times the detection-limit range. Thus, the 
variable results for the reference sample are expected. 
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 74 of 245 

Review of Check Assays 
Similar to analytical standards, check assays by an independent laboratory on pulps from the primary 
assay lab are used to evaluate the analytical accuracy of the primary lab. In contrast, check assays by 
the primary laboratory on its own pulps can be used to examine the analytical precision of the primary 
lab. 
 
The initial batch of check assaying was performed in 2005 and was made up of 17 samples from drill 
hole PMDH - 109. The check assay laboratory was BSI Inspectorate ("BSI") in Reno, Nevada. 
Analysis for both metals was by fire assay with gravimetric finish on a 1 assay-ton sample charge. The 
BSI results showed good agreement for gold, but very poor agreement for silver. BSI silver results are 
systematically lower than the original assay by approximately 40%. These silver check assay data were 
considered suspect.  
 
During the period from July 2005 to November 2005, an additional 920 pulp samples were submitted 
to ACME laboratories of Vancouver, B.C.  for check analysis. Analysis for both metals was by fire 
assay with gravimetric finish on a 1 assay-ton sample charge. These samples are from across the 
deposit and from assay reports over the life of the project. Gold results from ACME agree well with 
the original Chemex results and show slightly higher grades (+5%) at the median and upper quantile. 
For silver, ACME is systematically higher than Chemex by 5% to 10% between 50 g Au/t and 1500 g 
Au/t. Below 50 g Ag/t there is much more scatter. Above 1500 g Ag/t silver, the assays agree well. 
Additional check analyses from the 2006 assaying program are recommended for a more conclusive 
statement of quality for this part of the assay database. 
 
 
13.1.2 AMEC's Review of Palmarejo QA/QC 
 
During a site visit in 2008 to Palmarejo, AMEC Mining and Metals (AMEC), an independent 
consultant to Coeur, acquired QA/QC assay data supplied by Bolnisi (AMEC, 2008).  AMEC 
evaluated the twin and duplicate samples according to the hyperbolic method. The Ag failure rates 
were within acceptable limits (less than 10%), but the Au failure rates are slightly above the acceptable 
limits. However, considering that most of the failures lie very close to the failure lines, AMEC is of the 
opinion that the sampling and analytical precisions are acceptable. 

 
AMEC also evaluated Certified Reference Materials (CRMs, certified Standard samples). In total, 
1,040 samples corresponding to four commercial CRMs and one in-house CRM were assayed. Most 
CRMs were characterized by relatively large proportions of outliers, particularly for Ag (4.1% to 
7.5%), regardless of the Ag grade. However, the Ag accuracy was appropriate (-3.6% to 1.2% bias). 
The only exception was CRM SG14, with -6.4% bias, but with a very low value (11 ppm). The Au 
assays also had relatively large proportions of outliers (0.6% to 5.9%), but the Au accuracy was within 
acceptable limits (-0.8% to 1.2% bias). 
 
AMEC also reviewed the assays of 1,240 coarse blanks inserted in the batches. The threshold value 
was considered as five times the detection limit. Only two samples for Ag and five samples for Au 
displayed values above the threshold value. AMEC is of the opinion that significant Ag and Au cross-
contamination did not occur.

13.1.3 Guadalupe Project Historic QA/QC and Third Party Reviews 
 
Applied Geoscience, LLC's review of the Guadalupe QA/QC data did not encounter significant 
problems or biases for the period studied (data collected from July, 2005-March, 2008), and the assay 
database was found to be of acceptable quality for resource modeling. 
 
Reference-sample statistics and control charts showed acceptable results for the gold fire assays. Silver 
assays from the project standards with expected values of less than approximately 50 g Ag/t showed 
scatter outside the tolerance limits. The variance in the silver results is likely due to analytical method 
variance and low resolution of the assay method at the lower-grade levels. Most of the silver standards 
used by the project are three to five times the detection-limit range, thus the variable results for the 
reference sample are expected. Some of the higher-grade silver standards showed a systematic low bias 
(Chemex results are biased low in comparison to the expected value of the standard). This condition 
may be due to silver volatilization during fire-assay cupellation. Check analyses on pulps have 
confirmed the silver assays from selected mineralized zones at Guadalupe. 
 
Duplicate-sample analyses showed acceptable reproducibility for both silver and gold, and check 
analyses agreed well with the original assays. Check analyses for Guadalupe agreed well with the 
original assays for the assay reports to March, 2007.  Check analyses for the remaining 2007 and 2008 
data showed satisfactory agreement with the original assay, but with some complication given 
mishandling of samples from two sample batches at one or both of the assay labs. 
 
13.1.4 La Patria Project QA/QC Review 
 
A total of 119 assay reports from February 10, 2006 to April 20, 2007 were included in Blair's review 
of the La Patria QA/QC data (2007).  The La Patria resource estimation has not been updated since the 
data review.  The following discussion is summarized from MDA's 2007 Technical Report (Gustin, 
2007).  For more information, see Section 21.   
 
Blair's review of the quality assurance and quality-control information for the La Patria projects did not 
encounter significant problems or biases within the assay database for the period studied, and the assay 
database is of acceptable quality for preliminary resource modeling. Check analyses are required for 
final approval of the La Patria assay database.  
 
Reference-sample statistics and control charts show acceptable results for the gold fire assays. Silver 
assays of the project standards show scatter outside the tolerance limits for some standards with 
expected values of less than approximately 50 g Ag/t. This variance in the silver results is likely due to 
analytical method variance and low resolution at the lower-grade levels for the assay method. Some of 
the silver standards results show a systematic low bias at higher concentrations. This condition may be 
due to silver volatilization during fire assay cupellation, although this does not appear to be the case 
with the Chemex internal reference-sample assays. 
 
Duplicate sample and internal laboratory check analyses show acceptable reproducibility for both 
metals. 
 
A monthly QC report is done so that "problem" reports can be quickly identified and action taken by 
project personnel in a timely fashion. Regular submission of samples for check analyses will also 
provide a more current and efficient QC monitoring program. During the initial review of QC data for 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 76 of 245 

La Patria, minor database problems were recognized. All have been discussed with exploration 
personnel, and action has been taken. 
  
13.1.5 Third Party Reviews of Historic QA/QC- Discussion and Recommendations 
 
The third party reviews of the historic QA/QC data summarized above did not encounter significant 
problems or biases within the Palmarejo, Guadalupe, or La Patria assay data. Based on these reviews, 
the Palmarejo 2003-2007 assay data is of acceptable quality for resource modeling, although additional 
checking and verification is needed. 
 
Reference sample statistics and control charts show acceptable results for the gold fire assays. Silver 
assays for the project standards show scatter outside the tolerance limits for the standards, with 
expected values of less than approximately 30 g Ag/t. The variance in the silver results is likely due to 
analytical method variance and lower resolution at the low-grade levels. 
 
Duplicate-sample analyses show acceptable reproducibility for both metals. Check analyses at 
secondary laboratories agree well with the original assays.  
 
All data collected from 2003-2007 and used for resource estimation for the Palmarejo and La Patria 
deposits. All data collected from inception in 2005 to 14th March, 2008 and used in the Guadalupe 
deposit resource estimation have been reviewed by AMEC, MDA and/or Applied Geoscience, LLC 
and was considered of acceptable quality for resource modeling (see Section 21 for a list of 
references).  
  
The Qualified Persons have reviewed the assay data and the third party reviews of the Palmarejo and 
Guadalupe databases and QA/QC programs done by AMEC (2008), MDA (2004, 2006) and Keith 
Blair (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008) and are in agreement with the conclusion of these reports that the data 
collected by Bolnisi and Planet Gold is suitable for resource modeling and that there are no known 
factors that could materially affect the sample results.  
 
13.2 Coeur QA/QC Programs 
 
The Palmarejo Project QA/QC program for gold and silver assays has changed from when work began 
in 2003. Initially the project inserted reference samples into the sample stream at a 1:200 ratio, 
whereby one reference sample was inserted for every 200 drill samples. Starting in mid-2005, the 
proportion was increased to approximately 1:25 to ensure that every fire-assay furnace lot contained 
reference samples.  When Coeur assumed control of the project in late 2007 the following protocols 
were implemented for exploration and development drilling; one reference standard inserted for every 
20 field samples, one blank sample inserted for every 20 field samples and one field duplicate is 
collected for every 20 field samples.  Additionally, 5% of the sample pulps are sent to a different lab 
for check analysis.  
 
Coeur utilizes the acQuire Technology data management system to store and analyze QA/QC results as 
they are made available.  Results are not released until QC has been completed on each assay 
certificate.  
 
QC results are examined for each batch of assays received from the laboratory.  Significant failure of 
standard samples requires re-submitting the pulps (the failed standard plus a minimum of 5 samples 
either side of the failure) for re-analysis.  The results of the re-analysis will either trigger acceptance of 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 77 of 245 

the original batch or re-run of the entire batch with rejection of the original results.  All sample re-runs 
are given precedence over the original results.   Results are also reviewed quarterly and elements of the 
QC program are adjusted as necessary. 
 
13.2.1 Coeur QA/QC Summary - Palmarejo Deposit 
 
Samples collected during Category 3 (infill) exploration core drilling and underground development 
drilling are sent to SGS Laboratory, Durango, Mexico for preparation and analysis using industry 
standard methods. SGS Durango is an accredited laboratory conforming with requirements of CAN-P-
1579, CAN-P-4E (ISO/IEC 17025:2005)).   
 
Samples are prepared by SGS preparation method PRP89.  Samples are dried and pulverized to >85% 
passing a 75 micron screen. A 30 gram charge is used for all analytical methods.  Gold is first analyzed 
by method FAA313, a fire assay with atomic absorption finish.  Gold samples that are above the upper 
detection limit for this method are re-analyzed by method FAG303, a fire assay with gravimetric 
finish.  Silver is analyzed with SGS method AAS21E with a 3 acid digestion.  Silver samples that are 
greater than the upper detection limit of this method are re-analyzed with method FAG313, a fire assay 
with gravimetric finish.   
 
All pulps are returned to the Palmarejo mine to be stored for a minimum of 6 months.  A minimum of 
5% of the pulps are to be sent to ALS Chemex, Chihuahua, Mexico for re-analysis.   
 
At the end of 2009 the Palmarejo mine completed construction of an on-site assay laboratory.  The lab 
has a sample preparation facility, two fire assay furnaces and two Atomic Absorption (AA) 
instruments.  The laboratory is being managed and run by SGS Laboratories on a contract basis.  The 
on-site lab is used mainly for ore control and mill sample analysis.  Thirty-two percent of the 
underground development drill samples were analyzed by the on-site laboratory.  Assay techniques are 
1 ton Fire Assay for gold with gravimetric or AA finish.  Silver analysis is by aqua-regia digestion and 
AA finish for silver and over limit silver samples are re-analyzed by fire assay and gravimetric finish.  
Mine site personnel are submitting samples with a rigorous QA/QC sample protocol, with the 
exception of check assaying at a second laboratory.   
 
QAQC Results Palmarejo Exploration and Development Drilling 
New drilling conducted between 2008 and Sept. 21, 2010, includes 372 Category 3 (CAT3) 
exploration drillholes for a total of 57,213 meters and 15,290 samples.  Development drill holes 
totaling 230 drillholes, 22,246 meters and 9,415 samples.  QAQC results reported are for site-wide 
exploration and development for 2008-2010.  In 2008 and 2009 there were many channel samples and 
condemnation drill holes completed that did not have QC samples inserted into the sample stream.  
Metal grades from these channel sample and condemnation drill hole data sets were not used in the 
resource model update.   
 
Six internal standards were used for the exploration and development drilling and were created by SGS 
Durango utilizing material from the Palmarejo mine site.  Round robin assaying was conducted by 4 
separate laboratories.  Two of these standards, STD-00005 and STD-00006, were also sent to SGS 
Toronto for analyses.  The analytical method used by each laboratory is not specified in the final SGS 
report.   Round-robin assaying statistics are summarized in Table 13.1.  Table 13.2 presents a summary 
of the QC sample insertion for the drilling completed during the period.

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 79 of 245 

Standards and blanks included during the period performed within acceptable parameters.  A total of 
5043 standards and blanks were inserted in the sample stream with 82 total failures noted based on 
Coeur QAQC guidelines.  A comparison of the calculated mean value for each standard during the 
period and the expected value shows that the calculated mean is typically averaging slightly below the 
round-robin mean value for silver and slightly above the round-robin mean for gold for all methods 
(see Figure 13.1).   
 
Some systematic error was detected in the blank material and corrective action was taken.   Blank 
material was collected from barren RC drill hole material around the mine site.  Five samples each 
were sent to SGS and ALS Chemex for certification.  Failures noted for blanks were typically clustered 
by date of sample insertion, possibly indicating the presence of low levels of mineralization in the 
blank material.  At the end of 2010 new blank material was collected and analyzed and the results will 
be evaluated in early 2011.

Field sample duplicates submitted with exploration drilling show a high percentage of failure between 
sample pairs utilizing a 15% acceptable error limit.  At Palmarejo, it is expected to have high 
variability below 30 ppm silver and 0.5 ppm gold.  The failure rate of duplicates from exploration 
drilling analyzed at SGS for the Ag_AAS21E method is 47.6%.  Sample pairs above 30 ppm show a 
slightly higher rate of 47.9%.    Silver FAG313 failure rate exhibits the same pattern.  The failure rate 
is 28.1%.   Gold duplicates analyzed with FAA313 have a 54.4% failure.  Above the 0.5 ppm 
acceptable level, 52.68% of the duplicate pairs fail.  Gold pairs analyzed with FAG303 method have a 
40.9% failure rate.  Silver shows a high sample variance between the 'primary' sample and the 
'duplicate' sample for Ag values >60 ppm and Au >4 ppm.  The primary sample is typically lower in 
value than the duplicate.  A previous examination of the duplicates in April 2009 showed a very 
pronounced bias with the duplicate sample showing systematically higher grades.  This was attributed 
to sampling bias with most of the fine material going into the duplicate sample.   
 
Instrument (pulp) duplicate pairs perform as expected.  There is a failure rate of 20% for all 
Ag_AAS21E duplicate pairs above the detection limit.  The failure rate for duplicate pairs above 30 
ppm for Ag_AAS21E is 0%.  QQ plots in Figure 13.2 indicate some reproducibility problems for silver 
>140 ppm with AA finish. 
 

Figure 13.2: Sample Duplicate QQ Analysis 
 

  
 
Sample duplicates for development drilling also show a high rate of failure from the SGS and 
Palmarejo site laboratories at all grade levels.  Reproducibility of results appears to decrease above 100 
ppm silver and 1 ppm gold for the Palmarejo laboratory.  Duplicate pairs sent to SGS show more 
variability above 80 ppm Silver and 2.5 ppm gold.  Instrument duplicates show difficulty in re-
producing results below 30 ppm Ag and 0.5 ppm Au 
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 81 of 245 

Duplicate failure can be attributed to both sampling bias and the variability of mineral distribution in 
the core.   Alternative duplicate sampling processes are being examined. Whole core sampling is being 
considered for future development drilling. 
 
The check assay program at a secondary laboratory was minimal for the 2009 and 2010 definition 
drilling and most sample pulps and coarse reject material have been discarded.  Results for the few 
samples show poor agreement between the original and check assay; however, most of this difference 
can be attributed to differences in sample digestion and metal determination. A more rigorous check 
assay program was implemented during the fourth quarter of 2010. 
 
The Qualified Person has reviewed the summary reports of the assay QC data for the 2008 to 2010 
Palmarejo QA/QC program.  The transition from exploration to development and production at the 
Palmarejo Project saw a drop in the rigor of the assay QC program and monitoring for 2008 and most 
of 2009.  Although not ideal, many of the drill holes and all of the channel samples from this period 
were not used in the resource model update described in this report.   The QP considers that the 
remaining data is suitable for resource modeling.  The QC program at Palmarejo has been modified to 
include more regular reporting and check assaying for a larger proportion of the samples. 
 
13.2.2 Coeur QA/QC Summary- Guadalupe and District Exploration Targets 
 
The current commercial analytical lab for the Guadalupe project is ALS-Chemex with sample 
preparation in Chihuahua, Chihuahua.  A split of the prepared pulp is sent to Vancouver, B.C. for fire 
assay with gravimetric finish for both gold and silver.  ALS-Chemex complies with the international 
standards ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 17025:1999 
 
ALS CHEMEX Preparation (ALS code: PREP-31)  
The entire sample is dried and crushed to > 70% passing a 2mm (10 mesh) screen.  A split of up to 
250g is pulverized to > 85% passing a 75 micron (200 mesh) screen.    
 
ALS CHEMEX Au and Ag Analyses (ALS codes: Au-ICP21, Au-GRA21, Ag-GRA21, ME-GRA21)  
All assays techniques at Palmarejo and Guadalupe utilize an initial 30 gram charge that is digested by 
the fire assay method.  Then the metal content is determined by different finish techniques.  The 
GRA21 technique uses a gravimetric finish or a physical weighing of the gold and or silver bead, 
detection limit for Au by this finish method is 0.05 to 1,000 ppm and 5 to 10,000 ppm for Ag.  QA/QC 
analysis over the past year has shown that commercial labs have difficulty reproducing gold values 
below 1 ppm with the gravimetric finish method due to the difficulty of physically weighing the small 
bead therefore a fire digestion followed by an ICP finish is being used for initial gold analyses and 
when the gold exceeds 10.0 ppm the sample is re-assayed by a fire digestion and gravimetric finish. 
 
2009 QA/QC Palmarejo District Exploration (Excluding Palmarejo Mine Area) 
The results of the 2009 QA/QC sample program for exploration drilling within the Palmarejo District 
are summarized in the following section (Table 13.3). During the 2009, 24,390 meters of diamond core 
drilling was conducted.  A total 4,926 meters were sampled and 4,317 samples were analyzed. No 
other types of drilling were conducted.  More information can be found in the January 2010 Palmarejo 
Technical Report on Sedar.

All results from the standards are considered within acceptable limits and no bias or systematic error 
was recognized.  The 8 failures represent less than a 5% failure rate and are within the acceptable 
statistical limits.   
 
The blank samples were developed and certified from barren core drilled within the Palmarejo district.  
The material was certified as blank by a round robin of assays to multiple labs.  A total of 228 blank 
samples were inserted into the sample stream during 2009 and only 3 occurrences of detectable silver 
were noted and 7 occurrences of detectable gold were noted.  The 7 failures represent less than a 4% 
failure rate and fall within acceptable statistical limits.  The levels of detected metal in all occurrences 
were low, 16 ppm for silver and a high of 0.200 ppm for gold, and it is considered that no significant 
contamination was present during the preparation of the 2009 samples. 
 
Duplicates submitted during 2009, consisted of sample duplicates, preparation duplicates and pulp 
duplicates.  Duplicate analyses show acceptable precision obtained from ALS Chemex on both silver 
and gold. Almost all variances outside the accepted +/- 15% occurred at low levels of silver and gold 
which is most likely due to the metal content being below the linear working range for the gravimetric 
finish method.   
 
Check assays were conducted by Techni Lab of Chihuahua, Mexico and SGS of Durango, Mexico on 
samples from the second half of the 2008 through the 3rd Quarter of 2009 drill campaigns.  A total of 
446 samples were sent in for check assays.  The check assays are used to verify the original assay 
value and values are considered acceptable within a +/- 10% range.  The silver values check well with 
most of the variance occurring in the low levels of silver.  Assay values greater than 30 ppm compare 
well between the labs. The gold values showed more variance than the silver and generally Techni 
Labs was consistently lower in gold values than ALS Chemex. While consistently lower and spread 
across all grade ranges, the lower values from Techni are not considered significant to invalidate 
assays. Check analyses for gold received from SGS with assay values greater than 0.8 ppm compare 
well between the labs. As with the results from Technilab, the SGS results show a slightly lower mean 
value and standard deviation than the original results from ALS Chemex. 
 
QA/QC samples were inserted into the field sample stream at the proper rate of at least 1 per 20 
samples or 5%.  All four types of QA/QC samples were inserted or completed, standards, blanks, 
duplicates and check assays at the proper rates of 5% of the total field sample population. No 
systematic bias or accuracy problems were detected for gold or silver assays based on results from the 
standard samples. No contamination was detected from routine insertion of blank samples. Duplicate 
samples showed good precision for silver values above 50 ppm and gold values above 2.0 ppm by the 
30 gram fire assay gravimetric technique.  Some variance was noted for gold analyses by gravimetric 
finish for values between 0.5 and 2.0 ppm and additional assaying by ICP analyses was conducted.  
The study concluded that a fire assay with an ICP finish for gold concentrations < 2 ppm be used and 
for gold values > 2 ppm a 30 gram fire assay with gravimetric finish should be utilized.  The ICP test 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 83 of 245 

method was implemented in November and the results should be reviewed in 2011. Check assays 
verified original sample values within acceptable limits. Coeur's review of the 2009 QA/QC data did 
not encounter significant problems or biases for the period studied, and the Qualified Persons believe 
the assay data to be of acceptable quality for resource modeling. 
 
2010 QA/QC Program 
The results of the 2010 QA/QC sample program for exploration drilling within the Palmarejo District 
are summarized in the following section (Table 13.4). During the year, 24,840 meters of diamond core 
drilling was conducted.  A total of 2,771 samples were analyzed. No other types of drilling were 
conducted.  Graphs and details can be found in the report "Fourth Quarter/Annual QAQC Summary 
Report 2010" (Coeur d'Alene Mines, 2010).

2010 Reference Samples 
Two standards were used during the year (Table 13.5).  All results from the standards analysis are 
considered within acceptable limits of 3 standard deviations and no bias or systematic error was 
recognized.  The 8 failures represent less than a 5% failure rate which is within acceptable statistical 
limits.

2010 Blanks 
During 2010, blank samples were developed and certified from barren core drilled within the 
Palmarejo district.  The material was certified as blank by a round robin of assays to multiple labs.  A 
total of 111 blank samples were inserted into the sample stream during the year and no gold or silver 
blanks failed.  The levels of detected metal in all occurrences was low, 16 ppm for silver and a high of 
0.200 ppm for gold, and it is considered that no significant contamination was present during the 
preparation of the 2010 samples.

2010 Duplicates 
Sample Duplicate analyses show acceptable precision obtained from ALS Chemex on both silver and 
gold (Table 13.6). Almost all variances outside the accepted +/- 15% occurred at low levels of silver 
and gold which is most likely due to the metal content being below the linear working range for the 
gravimetric finish method.

A total of 50 field sample duplicates (1/4 core splits) and 104 analytical duplicates were reported 
during the 2010 year. Seven out of twenty four or 29% failed for gold using the Au_ICP21 method, 
and four out of twenty six or 26% failed for silver using Ag_GRA21 gravity method. 
  
One hundred and four analytical duplicates from pulps were analyzed during 2010. The acceptable 
range for duplicate comparison is +10%. Twenty five out of 53 or 47% failed for gold precision under 
1 ppm values. Fourteen out of 51, or 27% silver analytical duplicates failed, mostly under the 20 ppm 
range. Precision is difficult to obtain from analytical duplicates for silver below 20 ppm using the 
Ag_GRA21 method; and for gold below 0.80 ppm using Au_ICP21 method.  
 
2010 Check Assays 
A total of 217 pulps, 7.8% of total samples taken, were sent to SGS of Durango, Mexico for check 
assay analysis after preparation/analysis at ALS Chemex, Chihuahua, SGS analyzed the pulps with 
equivalent SGS analytical methods FAA313 and FAG313.    Results compare very well above test 
method reproducibility levels (Figure 13.3).

For check assay results received from SGS, Durango, Mexico, three samples out of fifteen (20%) 
failed showing a 20% difference when comparing Au_ICP21 and AuAA_323 methods.  For gold 
assayed by equivalent gravimetric methods, no significant differences were noted; only one sample out 
of eight analyses failed; this value was less than 3ppm Au. 
 
Silver results from SGS results show consistently a slightly higher mean value and standard deviation 
than the original results from ALS Chemex for both low and high grade methods.  Fifteen samples out 
of sixty four samples, or 15 %, failed for silver under comparison of Ag_GRA21 vs Ag_FAG323 
methods.  Data from silver analysis using Ag_GRA21 and Ag_FAG313 methods show that differences 
are below the 50 ppm range.  Two failures occurred at values of 100 ppm and 300 ppm. 
 
Guadalupe QA/QC Discussion and Recommendations 
Coeur's review of the Guadalupe QA/QC data did not encounter significant problems or biases for the 
period studied, and the assay database was found to be of acceptable quality for resource modeling. 
 

1. QA/QC samples were inserted into the field sample stream at the proper rate of at least 1 per 20 
samples or 5%.  

2. All four types of QA/QC samples were inserted or completed, standards, blanks, duplicates and 
check assays at the proper rates of 5 +/- 0.5 % of the total field sample population. 

3. No systematic bias or accuracy problems were detected for gold or silver assays based on 
results from the standard samples.  

4. No contamination was detected from routine insertion of blank samples.  
5. Duplicate samples showed good precision for silver values above 50 ppm and gold values 

above 2.0 ppm by the 30 gram fire assay gravimetric technique.  Some variance was noted for 
gold analyses by gravimetric finish for values between 0.5 and 2.0 ppm and additional assaying 
by ICP analyses was conducted.  The study concluded that a fire assay with an ICP finish for 
gold concentrations < 2 ppm be used and for gold values > 2 ppm a 30 gram fire assay with 
gravimetric finish is being utilized.  The ICP test method is being used since November 2009 to 
date with satisfactory output data.  

6. Check assays verified original sample values within acceptable limits.  



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 86 of 245 

7. When significant failures occurred within any QA/QC samples follow up actions included re-
assaying of the failed QA/QC sample and at least five field samples on both sides of the 
QA/QC samples. 

 
The Qualified Persons' review of the 2010 QA/QC data did not encounter significant problems or 
biases for the period studied, and the Qualified Persons believe the assay data to be of acceptable 
quality for resource modeling.

SECTION 14 - DATA VERIFICATION 
  
Data verification begins with the data storage process.  All assay data is loaded from original lab 
certificates.  QA/QC graphs are generated for each certificate and the assays are accepted/rejected on a 
batch basis.   Assays are assigned a priority ranking based on test method and assay laboratory.    
 
In December, 2010, Mine Development Associates of Reno, Nevada conducted an audit of primary 
assay results loaded to the acQuire database system for exploration and production at the Palmarejo 
property (Avery, 2010).  Of the assay certificates loaded to the Exploration database (exclusive of 
Palmarejo mine site data), 9.3% were evaluated and 4.6% of the assay certificates loaded to the 
Palmarejo mine site database were evaluated.  MDA received the original assay certificates directly 
from the laboratory (SGS Durango or ALS Chemex).  Table 14.1 shows the results of the assay 
certificate audit.

MDA also conducted a brief review of all the data available in both databases.  No significant 
problems were found.  Minor issues were checked and corrected by the geology staff.   
 
14.1 GEMCOM Gems™ vs. acQuire Database Validation 
 
Data from the resource model was compared against the acQuire databases as an extra precaution to 
catch any potential changes.  A total of 87,816 samples are loaded to the Palmarejo resource model.  
Only 52 significant errors were found.  The error is less than 0.1% and is considered within acceptable 
limits.  
 
The same test was performed between the Guadalupe resource model and the acQuire database.  No 
significant errors were noted.

SECTION 15 - ADJACENT PROPERTIES  
 
Exploration activities are under way across the Sierra Madre Occidental by many domestic and foreign 
mining and mineral exploration companies.  Very little open land exists in the belt and around the 
Palmarejo District and other companies control mineral concessions immediately bordering or within 
the external boundaries of the Palmarejo District (Foreign Concessions). However, none of the Foreign 
Concessions have a material impact on the Mineral Resources and Reserves stated herein.   
 
15.1 La Curra Property 
 
During 2008, Coeur entered into an Option to Purchase agreement with Tara Gold on the La Curra 
property located immediately adjacent to Guadalupe along the southeast strike extension.  A total of 17 
diamond core holes were drilled in the first quarter of 2009 for a total of 5,257 meters.  Assay results 
were discouraging and the agreement was terminated and the property returned to Tara Gold in the 
second quarter of 2009.

A review of the results indicate that the ore is quite hard and also quite variable for all of the major ore 
types with the Bond Rod Work Index varying between 15.1 and 21.8 kWh/t, and up to 26.2 for the 
Jasper Breccia, which is not a major ore source.  The Bond Ball mill work index varied between 17.1 
and 20 kWh/t, and up to 24.9 for the Jasper Breccia.  Abrasion index varied between 0.1126 and 
0.4528, and up to 0.7297 for the Jasper Breccia. 
 
The JK SMC tests gave some very hard figures for the amygdaloidal andesite samples when tested, 
with the hardest A x b figure of 24.9 and an average of 31.9.  This indicates a very hard competent 
material that is close to the limit for SAG milling.  However, the JK Drop Weight test on the identical 
amygdaloidal sample that was the hardest gave an A x B figure of 39.9.  As the JK Drop Weight test is 
carried out on whole core samples (as compared to the ¼ core samples tested in the JK SMC test) this 
indicates that the material may not be as hard as the SMC tests indicate.  However, the averages of the 
JK SMC and JK Drop Weight tests have been used in the design of the milling circuit. 
The quartz vein breccia samples and other footwall sediments tested gave higher average figures for 
the A x b figures of 41.1 and 44.2 respectively.  The higher figures for the A x b for these samples 
indicate that these materials are softer than the amygdaloidal andesite. 
 
All of the comminution data has been forwarded to Orway Mineral Consultants Pty Ltd (OMC) for 
analysis and comminution circuit modelling.  The modelling consists of determining the ore 
parameters for each major ore type to be treated in the milling circuit.  Each ore type is then modelled 
along with the expected ore blend that the circuit is expected to handle.  A draft report from OMC has 
been received following their study of the results. 
 
Flotation Testwork 
 
Early testwork programs tested the different circuit configurations to maximise silver and gold 
recovery and included whole ore leaching, gravity concentrations followed by leaching of the 
concentrate and tailings and finally flotation followed by leaching of the flotation concentrate and

tailings.  This early testwork indicated that the best recovery was achieved by flotation followed by 
leaching.  Silver recovery from these tests increased from 45% for the whole ore leach to 81.1% for 
gravity followed by leaching and 90.2% for flotation and leaching.  The corresponding gold recoveries 
were 82.5%, 93.7% and 96.0% respectively.  The whole ore leaching did not include any lead nitrate 
addition where as all other tests did and as such the whole ore recoveries would probably be higher for 
silver with the addition of lead nitrate.  A summary of the different process routes tested is provided in 
Table 16.3.

Subsequent testwork campaigns have concentrated on optimizing the flotation circuit configuration 
and reagent selection.  Early flotation testwork indicated high flotation recoveries into a rougher 
concentrate with a mass pull to concentrate of 6 to 10 % (average 9.5%) and recoveries of between 77 
to 89% for both silver and gold.  Due to these high recoveries flotation tests were carried out to try to 
obtain a 'throw away tail' from flotation, i.e. that the flotation tailings could be sent straight to the 
tailings dam.  Tests that were included were gravity, followed by flotation and finally controlled 
potential sulfidization and flotation.  This test did not result in a tail that was low enough grade to be 
discarded, so this approach was not pursued further. 
 
Flotation testwork then concentrated on the best option for handling the rougher concentrate following 
cyanide leaching.  Testwork on early rougher concentrates indicated that the concentrate contained a 
considerable quantity of fine material that gave difficulties with settling and filtration of this product.  
A number of cleaner tests were carried out to see if the concentrate could be cleaned to a lower mass 
pull and higher grade product that could be more easily handled after leaching.  The cleaner testwork 
indicated that the mass pull could be reduced to between 1.1% to 5.3%, and an average of 3.6%, with 
considerably higher grades also achieved.  The silver and gold recovery was found to drop only 
marginally and the resulting product was found to settle better than the rougher concentrate.  Silver and 
gold recoveries were lower than the rougher only flotation but averaged 79.1% for gold and 80.9% for 
silver. 
 
Following the batch flotation testwork to optimise the circuit configuration and reagent selection and 
dosage a locked cycle tests was carried out on a master composite sample that had been prepared from 
drillhole numbers 078D, 115D and 125D.  This test was carried out for seven cycles and gave a mass 
pull of 5.3% and gold and silver recoveries of 92.0% and 85.1% respectively. 
 
Two pilot plant flotation runs were conducted.  The first was conducted on four RC drillhole samples 
with the primary objective to produce a flotation concentrate that could be leached and the resulting 
liquor separated from the solids and then sent for electrowinning testing.  The flotation circuit included 
only roughing and scavenging, with no cleaner stage.  This pilot produced a high mass pull to 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 94 of 245 

concentrate (17.2%) and relative low silver and gold grades in the concentrate, 25 g/t gold and 2,297 
g/t silver. 
 
The second pilot tests was carried out on combined samples from diamond drill hole 340D and bulk 
underground sample 'Q'.  The flotation circuit consisted of rougher flotation followed by a cleaner 
stage.  The flotation circuit initially ran well with control samples indicating high grade concentrate 
and low tailings grade, however after a number of hours it became apparent that a circulating load of 
fine gangue material had built up in the circuit which finally reported to the cleaner concentrate.  This 
resulted in a high mass pull of cleaner concentrate which was low grade.  This has highlighted the need 
to monitor the circulating load in the cleaner circuit at site and also contingency has been made to feed 
the cleaner tail at different points within the rougher circuit. 
 
As the primary objective of the pilot program was to again produce a leached solution for 
electrowinning testing, it was decided to re-clean the cleaner concentrate by pumping the concentrate 
through the cleaner cell again, after the pilot trial was complete.  This cleaning increased the 
concentrate grades to 23.7 g/t gold and 3,170 g/t silver.  This concentrate was leached, the solids were 
removed and the clear solution sent for electrowinning testing. 
 
A summary of the batch rougher tests, cleaner flotation tests, locked cycle testing and pilot plant tests 
are given in Table 16.4.

Leaching Testwork 
 
Leaching testwork has been carried out on all flotation concentrate and tailings samples that have 
tested for all of the major testwork campaigns.  Leaching of the concentrate indicated that high cyanide 
levels (initially 5%) were required to ensure high silver and gold recoveries.  Latter cyanide 
optimisation tests were carried out on flotation concentrates with and without the addition of oxygen.  
The tests indicate that the optimum cyanide level was 5% if air is added to the slurry.  However the 
cyanide concentration could be lowered to 1% if the slurry is sparged with oxygen.  The majority of 
concentrate leaches achieved silver and gold recoveries in excess of 97%, although one variability test 
on drill hole 078D only achieved concentrate leach recoveries of 44.4% for silver and 94.4 % for gold.  
This was a high grade sample and the leach curves from this test indicate that the silver leaching was 
still going and that a higher cyanide concentration may be required to increase the leaching rate for this

test.  This is supported as the master composite that was made up from drillholes 078D, 115D and 
125D achieved 97.9% silver recovery on the concentrate leach.  A summary of the leaching results for 
the flotation concentrate and tailings is given in Table 16.5.

The leaching of the flotation tailings samples generally gave lower leach recoveries than achieved from 
the concentrate samples, as would be expected.   The average leach recoveries were 84% for gold and 
72.3% for silver.  Recoveries were quite variable, which is partly due to the head grades treated, but 
varied between 55 and 96.6%. 
 
The overall leaching recoveries from both the concentrate and tailings leaches were 93.2% for gold and 
87.9% for silver.  However, again if the 078D variability sample is excluded, then gold recovery is 
94.0% and silver recovery is 91.7%. 
 
The reagent consumption for the flotation concentrate leach tests was 19.9 kg/t and 0.59 kg/t lime.  The 
highest cyanide consumption figure for the concentrate leach was 54.2 kg/t and the lowest 0.31 kg/t.  
The average dropped when the lower cyanide concentration was used in conjunction with the oxygen 
and appears to be around 10 kg/t. 
 
The reagent consumption for the flotation tailings leach tests was 0.71 kg/t and 1.21 kg/t lime.  The 
highest cyanide consumption figure for the tailings leach was 1.64 kg/t and the lowest 0.33 kg/t.  The 
combined reagent consumption for the tests results in a consumption of 1.26 kg/t cyanide and 1.16 kg/t 
lime. 
 
Cyanide Destruction Testwork 
 
Cyanide destruction testwork has been carried out on the master composite sample that was produced 
from drillhole 078D, 115D and 125D, in test campaign 9745.  Approximately 100 kg of master 
composite sample was treated through a 7 kg batch flotation cell to produce a cleaner flotation 
concentrate and a tailings sample, both of which were used for the destruction testwork.  Only the Inco 
SO2/air system was assessed, as this is considered the most cost effective technique.  The results of all 
of the cyanide destruction testwork are given in Table 16.6.

The method used to prepare the sample for testing was quite involved due to the nature of the circuit 
design.  This method included leaching a sample of flotation concentrate for 48 hours to simulate the 
concentrate leach circuit in the plant.  Carbon was added for the last four hours to remove the silver 
and gold from solution.  At the completion of the leaching, the carbon was removed from the slurry 
and the slurry was then added to tailings slurry at the correct mass split as was produced during the 
flotation process.  This combined slurry was then leached for 24 hours, with carbon added for the last 
four hours to remove the silver and gold from solution.  The carbon was then removed from the slurry 
and flocculant was added to the slurry and the slurry was allowed to settle over night.  The excess clear 
solution was then removed from the slurry (to simulate the tailings thickener) and then fresh water was 
added to the slurry to reduce the density back to the density required for destruction testwork.  The 
destruction testwork was now commenced on this slurry. 
 
Cyanide destruction testwork included six batch tests and two semi continuous tests.  The batch testing 
was done in two separate phases, with the aim being to define the conditions required for the semi-
continuous tests.  The first phase of batch testing was done when the cyanide concentration to be used 
in the concentrate leach was 5%, which resulted in a feed to cyanide destruction of 870 mg/l CN wad 
and a CN total of 1100 mg/l.  The testing of this slurry was done at a solids density of 45% w/w solids, 
pH was maintained at 9.0 and metabisulphite additions were tested at 115, 150 and 165% of the 
stoichiometry requirement.  These tests reduced the cyanide wad level to only 126 mg/l and did not 
achieve the target level of 10 mg/l.   
 
It was noted that during the tests that the viscosity of the slurry increased dramatically during the test 
and it is believed that this had a significant impact on the final destruction.  It was also felt that a lower 
pH of the slurry would help with the process. 
 
Subsequent to the first phase of testing, cyanide optimisation testwork had been carried out on the 
flotation concentrate sample.  This optimisation resulted in the addition of oxygen to the concentrate 
and a reduction in the cyanide concentration to 1%.  The second phase of testing was done at the lower 
cyanide level in the concentrate leach and also was planned to study the affect of pulp density on 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 97 of 245 

cyanide destruction.  The feed slurry to the testwork was now at a lower cyanide concentration of 240 
mg/l wad cyanide.  Three tests were done with two tests to be done at a target density of 40% solids 
and one at 35% solids.  The two tests at 40% solids were to be done at a target of 150 and 200% 
metabisulphite stoichiometry and the 35% solids at 150% metabisulphite stoichiometry.  The density 
of the tests was found to be higher than planned, at 42.5 and 37.5%, however all three of the tests 
decreased the wad cyanide level below the target value of 10 mg/l. 
 
A final large slurry sample was produced to allow two semi-continuous tests to be carried.  These tests 
were done to confirm the conditions determined from the batch testwork and to confirm final cyanide 
levels in the resultant slurry.  Both tests were done at 42% solids, maintained the pH between 8.0 and 
8.5, had a residence time of 70 minutes and tested the metabisulphite stoichiometry at 150 and 165%.  
Both tests gave cyanide wad levels of less than 10 mg/l and were in fact less than 2 mg/l.   
 
Electrowinning Testwork 
 
Two solutions were produced from the two pilot plant trials that were conducted at the SGS Lakefield 
Oretest laboratory.  The first solution was produced from a rougher concentrate product that was 
leached with a 5 % cyanide concentration leach in April 2005.  The solution produced contained 
approximately 1000 ppm silver and 10.3 ppm gold with 5% cyanide.  This solution indicated that the 
silver would form plate at the higher concentration and then powder as the silver concentration 
dropped below 300 ppm. 
 
The second solution was produced from a flotation cleaner sample produced from the second pilot trial 
and leached at 1% cyanide in November 2005.  This solution contained approximately 1900 ppm silver 
and 18.2 ppm gold.  This solution produced silver powder for the full range of testing and indicated a 
higher production rate per cell than the first solution tested. 
 
The second solution produced is expected to be more representative of the solution that will be 
processed at site.  This is for a number of reasons, which are given below: 
The concentrate used to produce the second solution was cleaned in the flotation circuit to remove 
excess gangue material prior to leaching. 
The cyanide concentration of the leach was at the planned level of 1%, not 5% as in the first solution. 
Electrometals Technologies have used the results from the second solution testing for sizing the 
required electrowinning circuit.  The advantage of being able to use the powder cells is that this style 
of cell can be automated and the powder can be collected in a filter.  This helps in security of the 
product as well as minimising the workforce required to work in the refinery area. 
 
Electrometals have produced two reports that summarise the test results.  These reports are titled 
"Summary Report: Silver Electrowinning from a Cyanide Electrolyte using EMEW®", November, 
2005 and "Summary Report: Electrowinning a Synthetic Palmarejo Electrolyte", January 2006. 
 
Settling Testwork 
 
Two settling testwork campaigns have been done by Outokumpu Technologies at their laboratory.  The 
first was done on samples produced from the master composite sample made from drillhole numbers 
078D, 115D and 125D.  A flotation cleaner concentrate and flotation tailings samples were sent for 
testing.  Different flocculants were screened for the flotation tailings and a flocculant was selected, 
which is the Nalco product 83384.  Dynamic settling tests were then done on both samples at different 
unit areas and at different dilution concentrations.  The unit rate for the flotation tailings was found to 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 98 of 245 

be best at 0.76 t/m2/h and for the concentrate this was done at 0.28 t/m2/h. A summary of the settling 
testwork is given in Table 16.7.

The second round of testing was done on leached flotation concentrate and leached combined 
concentrate and tailings sample.  These were samples that had been produced from the second pilot 
plant operation.  Dynamic thickening tests were carried out on these samples at unit settling rates of 
0.80 t/m2/h for the combined tailings sample and 0.2 t/m2/h for the leached concentrate samples.  Both 
tests indicated that the targeted underflow densities should be achieved; however overflow clarity may 
not be as good as expected.  This is especially true for the concentrate sample that is at a high pH and 
has a high sodium content due to the high cyanide levels.  Further testwork on optimum flocculants is 
recommended at site during commissioning. 
 
Miscellaneous Testwork 
 
A number of other metallurgical tests have been carried out to collect data required for the plant design 
and as alternative process route.  These have included the following: 
Rheology Testwork. 
Oxygen Uptake Testwork. 
Merrill Crowe Testwork. 
Tailings Testwork 
Chloride Analysis. 
Rheology testwork has been carried out on flotation concentrate and tailings samples at different 
densities.  This data has been used in pump and agitator designs. 
 
Oxygen uptake tests were done on both flotation concentrate and tailings samples.  This was done to 
determine the oxygen requirement for each slurry type and in turn allows for the sizing of the oxygen 
plant required for the process plant.  The concentrate slurry has a high oxygen demand, 0.3207 
mg/l/min, for the first six hours and then slowly reduces over the next 18 hours.  The tailings sample 
oxygen demand was quite low with a peak of 0.0286 mg/l/min.  A summary of the oxygen uptake 
testwork is given in Table 16.8.

Merrill Crowe testwork was done on concentrate leach liquors as an alternative process route to the 
electrowinning route.  The testwork was done on a high grade solution produced from leaching a 
flotation concentrate sample, to test the possible inclusion of a high grade Merrill Crowe circuit to 
directly replace the electrowinning circuit.  The testwork indicated high silver and gold precipitation 
rates from the solution, although some minor re-dissolution was seen over one hour.  Solution tenors 
dropped from 2,360 ppm silver to approximately 7 ppm in 15 minutes at a zinc stoichiometry of 1:1, 
0.85:1 and 1.15:1.  A summary of the Merrill Crowe zinc precipitation testwork is given in Table 16.9.

Tailings testing samples were prepared from the master composite sample, that was made up from 
drillholes 078D, 115D and 125D, and the final pilot plant trial sample, that was made up from drillhole 
340D and the 'Q' sample.  Two different samples from each source were sent, one for geochemical 
tailings testing and the other for geotechnical tailings testing.  Results are still outstanding on these 
samples. 
 
Electrowinning testwork had shown some signs of corrosion on the anode from the first stage of 
testing.  The corrosion appeared to be pitting, indicating the presence of chlorides in the pregnant 
solution.  Difficulties were experienced in trying to assay for chlorides in solution containing very high 
cyanide concentration.  A number of commercial laboratories were approached; however the CSIRO 
laboratory in Perth finally offered the best service for chloride analysis.  The leach liquors from the 
concentrate leach solution were found to contain chlorides between 22 ppm to 199 ppm.  Electrometals 
had indicated that the upper limit of chlorides for stainless steel anodes was 50 ppm.  Due to the range 
of chloride levels and the re-circulation of solution within the process plant, it was decided that 
titanium with a DSA coating would be selected for the anodes in the electrowinning cells.

Cytec Testwork 
 
Cytec Mining Chemicals organised to do additional batch flotation testwork at the SGS Lakefield 
Oretest laboratory to investigate alternative flotation reagent schemes.  Twenty batch cleaner flotation 
tests were carried out on a sample of the master composite prepared from drillhole 340D and Q 
sample.  Testing included alternative reagents and grinding procedures to optimise flotation response.  
The results of this testwork are summarised in a report titled "Palmarejo Brief Technical Update 22nd 
December 2005".  The key findings of this study was that the frother selection could be changed from 
Terric 405 to Cytec F549, that the best flotation reagents are those already selected, but that A3418A 
showed some promise that could be trialled at site following commissioning. 
 
Mineralogy 
 
Mineralogy has been done on five different drill hole head samples and on one concentrate sample 
produced from the master composite made from drillhole number 078D, 115D and 125D.  All of these 
reports have identified that the majority of the silver occurs as electrum and as silver sulphide 
(Acanthite).  A number of other silver minerals have been identified in different holes, but they are not 
consistent through all of the drill holes.  Some of these minerals include Aurorite ((Mn2AgCa)Mn 
4O7.3H2O), native silver and a number of copper/silver/sulphide minerals.  Gold occurs mainly as 
electrum. 
 
The mineralogy of the flotation concentrate confirms that the sample is predominately a pyrite 
concentrate with other base metal sulphides including galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, chalcocite, 
covellite, bornite, marcasite, etc. 
 
Conclusions 
 
A total of 13 drill hole samples have been tested along with three bulk samples.  The drill hole samples 
consist of seven reverse circulation (RC) drill holes and six diamond drill holes.  The bulk samples 
consist of two underground samples taken from the existing workings from the 'La Prieta' structure 
and one surface outcrop sample from the Chapotillo Clavo.  In total, almost 2.5 tonnes of samples have 
been tested to allow the design of the plant to proceed. 
 
A detailed comminution testwork program has been carried out on both whole diamond core samples 
and bulk samples taken from the surface and underground.  The testing has included the conventional 
bond work index testwork, UCS testing, AMC testing and the more advanced JK Drop weight and 
SMC testing used for modelling.  This testing has indicated that some of the rock types (amygdaloidal 
andesite) are hard and competent, while other rock types are less hard and competent (the quartz vein 
breccia and footwall sediments).  The data from all of these tests indicates that the ore is amenable to 
SAG milling, but due to the hard component nature of some of the rock types, a two stage milling 
circuit will be required. 
 
Flotation testwork has been carried out at batch scale, followed by locked cycle testing and finally at 
pilot plant scale.  All of the data suggests that the ore is very amenable to flotation.  The tests indicate 
that approximately 80% of the silver and gold can be collected into a very small mass of approximately 
5% of the feed tonnage.  This has the advantage of allowing high cyanide concentration leaching of the 
concentrate to produce a high tenor solution for precious metal recovery. 
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 101 of 245 

Leaching testwork has been carried out to optimize reagent additions and define the plant recoveries.  
Leaching of the flotation concentrate generally exceeds 97% for both silver and gold, while flotation 
tailings recoveries are approximately 85% for gold and 72% for silver.  The overall leaching recovery 
is 93.2% for gold and 87.9% for silver, although higher recoveries are indicated when tests that did not 
appear to be correct are removed to give a gold recovery of 94% and silver of 91.7%.  Overall reagent 
consumptions were 1.26 kg/t for cyanide and 1.16 kg/t for lime. 
 
Commercial production commenced in April 2009.  Recovery of gold has been consistent with the 
initial metallurgical testwork and feasibility study estimates and averaged 92% during 2010. The 
recovery of silver has not achieved the feasibility study values and averaged 71% during 2010.  During 
2010, silver recoveries at feasibility levels of 80% were achieved but not consistently.  Additional 
metallurgical work has identified causes for the variable recoveries.  Adjustments have been made to 
the current plant and an expansion of the CIL circuit is being evaluated for 2011 which is designed to 
achieve consistently higher silver recoveries from all ore types. 
 
16.3 Guadalupe Metallurgical Testwork Summary 
 
Sample Selection 
 
Two drillhole samples have completed metallurgical testing in 2007, (TGDH-129 and TGDH-184) and 
four more samples (TGDH-054, TGDH-214, TGDH-225, and TGDH-238) were submitted in 2008 to 
be tested at SGS labs in Durango, Mexico.  Additional metallurgical samples TGDH-341 and TGDH- 
355 were sent during 2010, partial results shown cyanadation recoveries of gold up to 92%, and silver 
from 70 to 87%.  Samples were selected from different areas (Figures 16.1-16.2) within the Guadalupe 
vein and represent all the mineralization styles in the deposit. Table 16.10 summarizes the main 
characteristics of such samples.

In addition to the eight metallurgical samples, eighteen samples from different parts of the Guadalupe 
deposit were submitted for mineralogical studies.  Mineralogy was conducted on samples from drill 
holes shown in Figure 16.2., which also shows the distribution of the silver-bearing mineral phases.

Additional test work from the Palmarejo Mine, 7 kilometers northwest, is available on ores from the 
Palmarejo deposit, which are mineralogically similar to the Guadalupe ores (see Sections 16.1 and 
16.2). 
 
The Bottle Roll Leach test were industry standard tests where the samples were tested for gold and 
silver recoveries at three grind sizes and four different concentrations of cyanide.  The test showed 
silver recoveries ranging from 84 to 92% and gold recoveries ranging from 80 to 93%. 
 
The Floatation tests were standard floatation tests conducted at two grind sizes.  The floatation 
concentrate was then assayed for metal content.  The floatation tails where then submitted for 
additional metal extraction with cyanide leaching.   
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 103 of 245 

The Gravity tests were conducted on coarse grind sizes than the Bottle Roll and float tests.  The 
samples were gravity concentrated using a Knelson bowl.  The gravity concentrates were then 
submitted to cyanide leach testing to check for the susceptibilities to leaching with cyanide. 
 
Results 
 
The best recoveries this far were achieved by flotation followed by leaching. Table 16.11 summarizes 
the results of these tests. The poorest overall recovery was found with the gravity concentrate method.

Mineralogy 
 
Mineralogical studies have been conducted on eighteen samples from different drill holes and spatial 
locations within the Guadalupe deposit.  The studies consisted of both thin section analyses and 
microprobe work to identify individual mineral species.  The mineralogical work shows that the 
mineralogy of the Palmarejo deposit and the Guadalupe deposit are similar (Table 16.12).

Conclusions 
 
Metallurgical tests indicate recoveries of silver and gold by floatation and leaching from Guadalupe 
ores is similar to the recoveries experienced at Palmarejo in the full scale process plant with a 
floatation and leaching circuit.  Mineralogical test work shows that the ore minerals at both deposits 
are also similar.  Based on this data the Qualified Person concludes that the Guadalupe ore is 
compatible with the process at the existing Palmarejo mill.  Additional test work at Guadalupe will 
continue to optimize recoveries.

SECTION 17 - MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
Coeur d'Alene Mines obtained ownership of the Palmarejo Deposit from Bolnisi Gold NL and 
Palmarejo Silver and Gold Corporation on December 21, 2007.  The Palmarejo Resource has been 
remodeled since the acquisition date using GEMCOM Gems™ (Gems™), which is a widely used 
commercial mining software package.  The methodology used to estimate Mineral Resources and 
Reserves have been reviewed by Keith Blair of Applied Geoscience LLC of Reno, Nevada a Canadian 
National Instrument 43-101 "Qualified Person", and are described in the following sections. 
 
In July 2010, Coeur d'Alene Mines retained Applied Geoscience LLC (APGS) of Reno, Nevada and 
Behre Dolbear & Company Inc. (Behre Dolbear) to update the geology and metal grade models for the 
Palmarejo Deposit based on new drilling information and updated geological interpretations in the 
main resource areas. 
 
The Resources stated in this report for the Palmarejo District conform to the definitions adopted by the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM"), December 2005 (see Appendix A 
for definitions).  The Palmarejo, Guadalupe, and La Patria Resource estimation procedures are 
discussed individually below. With the exception of minor edits, the La Patria Resource estimation is 
taken directly from the previous Mine Development Associates (MDA) Technical Report (Gustin and 
Prenn, Sept. 2007). 
  
17.1 Mineral Resource Estimation Methodology Palmarejo Deposit 
 
17.1.1 Assay Data 
 
The original geology model for the Palmarejo Deposit was created by AMEC in 2007 and 2008, at 
Coeur's request, for estimating silver and gold Resources at Palmarejo using data generated by Planet 
Gold through late September 2007, including geologic mapping, RC and core drilling results, and 
surveying of underground workings. A wireframe of the underground workings was created by AMEC 
using historical data prepared by previous operators and was incorporated into the resource modeling. 
Aerial photography was used to create a topographic model with two-meter contours.   
 
Since September 2007, an additional 680 definition/in-fill drill holes, totaling 69,210m, have been 
completed in the Palmarejo Mine area.  Production/ore-control drilling in the open pit mining areas at 
Palmarejo has supplied 3,091 additional RC drill holes (71,478m) to the database for geology and 
resource modeling. In addition to the drill hole data, there are 9,717m of grade control chip-channel 
samples in 881 sample strings from underground development and production drifts in the 76 Clavo 
and 108 Clavo areas.  These chip channel samples were used in the interpretation of the mineral type 
model but not in metal grade estimation given the sample type and the lack of quality control data. 
 
These data were incorporated into a digital database and all subsequent modeling of the Palmarejo 
Deposit Resource was performed using GEMCOM Gems™ software. 
 
17.1.2 Material Density 
 
Planet Gold personnel gathered dry bulk specific-gravity data using standard water-immersion 
methods on dried and waxed whole-core samples of mineralized and unmineralized units. These data 
are supplemented by measurements collected on whole and half core as part of third-party 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 107 of 245 

metallurgical studies (Table 17.1). Table 17.2 lists the specific gravities used in the Palmarejo 
modeling.

A density of 2.56 g/cm3 was assigned to modeled mineralization (discussed below), which takes into 
account natural void spaces, such as open fractures, that could not be accurately accounted for in the 
measurements.  No additional work on the specific gravity data and the density model was completed 
for the year-end 2010 resource update.  It is the view of Keith Blair, the Qualified Person for the 
Palmarejo deposit resource estimate, that the density chosen for the vein and stockwork materials may 
be conservative and should be reviewed with additional sampling and confirmation of the natural void 
space and open fractures. 
 
17.1.3 Geology Modeling 
 
Geological modeling of the Palmarejo Mine area was broken up into separate, but contiguous, project 
areas based on actual or projected mining styles (open-pit or underground) and mineral controls.  The 
deposit consists of two main structures, La Blanca and La Prieta.  The La Blanca structure will be 
mined by underground methods at the 76 and 108 clavo, and by both underground and open pit 
methods at the Rosario clavo.  The La Prieta structure will be mined by open pit for all three major 
mineralized shoots; the Rosario, Tucson and Chapotillo clavos. Project domains and clavos are shown 
in Figure 17.1.

(contours on original, pre-mining, topography surface) 

 

 
 
The APGS scope of work included the interpretation of a mineral resource modeling framework for the 
La Blanca vein and was prepared using existing drill hole data and an updated geological model 
prepared by Coeur geologists.  APGS reviewed and edited the geologic interpretation prepared by 
Coeur on vertical sections and level plans and constructed preliminary geological solids.  These 
preliminary solids were contoured on 10m level plans and the final interpretation was completed in 
plan with generation of the final model solids for resource estimation.   
 
As part of Behre Dolbear scope of work, a Mineral Resource modeling framework for the La Prieta 
and La Victoria veins was prepared, using existing drill hole data and a new geological model.  Behre 
Dolbear reviewed and edited the geologic interpretation prepared by Coeur on vertical sections, and 
then interpreted the shapes in plan. Using both sets of interpretations, vertical and plan sections, Behre 
Dolbear constructed geological solids that were used for resource estimation. The geologic model 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 109 of 245 

framework was developed in close collaboration with Coeur geologists, with whom concepts, issues 
and solutions were discussed on an on-going basis. 
 
Lithological Model 
 
Bolnisi geologists in the Chihuahua office prepared an interpretation of the main lithological units at 
Palmarejo during 2007 and 2008. The interpretation was done using parallel vertical sections spaced 
every 25 m and oriented N45°E. AMEC defined sections in Gemcom software, from southeast to 
northwest, with a continuous identification from 1FS to 65FS. Table 17.3 shows the text codes and 
description of lithological units interpreted and defined by Bolnisi and the integer codes defined by 
AMEC to identify the units in the subsequent block model. 
 

Table 17.3: Lithological Unit Descriptions and Codes 
 

 
 
Using only the vertical sections, Bolnisi created lithological solids in Surpac® software and exported 
them, in DXF format, to AMEC. The mineralization at Palmarejo is not completely lithologically 
controlled and the main purpose of this model is to assign specific gravity values to the block model.  
Figure 17.2 shows an illustration of the section orientation and a slice of the lithological solids through 
elevation 960.  
 
Given time constraints during the 2010 resource model update, this original lithology model was not 
modified; the Mineral Control model, discussed below, was inserted into the existing lithology model 
and used for assigning density to the wall rock material outside the mineral control model.  Subsequent 
resource model updates will include modification of the lithology model to better honor the new 
drilling information.

Figure 17.2: Plan View Showing Section Orientation 
 

 
 
Void Model 
 
Three-dimensional `wireframe' lithologic and mineralized structural models were created by AMEC. 
These included models of the La Prieta and La Blanca vein structures and associated footwall and 
hanging-wall stockwork zones, as well as models of the unmineralized stratigraphic host units. The 
mineralized structure interpretations were used as a guide in the grade modeling discussed below. 
 
Prior to Coeur's purchase of the Palmarejo property, Planet Gold created a three-dimensional 
`wireframe' model of the underground workings at Palmarejo (the "Planet Gold void model"). This 
model was built using data from historic mine maps, Planet Gold drill data (intersected workings or 
mine backfill), and survey data collected from accessible underground workings. The mining history of 
the Palmarejo area is discussed in Section 6. The Planet Gold void model was used to directly remove 
tonnage from the resource model. 
 
Pre-feasibility work in July and August 2007 by Coeur in anticipation of a corporate merger of Coeur, 
Bolnisi, and Palmarejo Silver and Gold identified stopes mined by Minas Huruapa (see Section 6) that 
were not included in the Planet Gold void model and, more significantly, historic documentation that 
suggests the Planet Gold void model does not fully account for mining that took place prior to 1909. 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 111 of 245 

The Planet Gold void model accounts for approximately 517,000 tonnes of material mined at 
Palmarejo, while the report brought to MDA's attention suggests that a total of approximately one 
million tonnes may have actually been mined (789,000 tonnes prior to 1909; 46,000 tonnes of 
development work in and around the vein structures that was completed a few years after 1909; and 
168,000 tonnes mined from 1979 to 1992; see Section 6). 
 
While the pre-1909 mining at Palmarejo is almost entirely undocumented by historic mine maps, and 
these old workings are not accessible, the tonnage figure quoted above for the material mined prior to 
1909 originates from a crude estimate by a mining engineer in 1909 (McCarthy, 1909). McCarthy 
provides an "approximate estimate of the ore that has been taken out and milled in the past history of 
the mine." He further notes that, "[t]his necessarily must be but an approximation owing to the want of 
proper records and plans, but which I believe to be correct within reasonable limits."   McCarthy 
estimates the cumulative strike length of the old stopes, and multiplies this strike length by average dip 
extents and widths of the stopes at La Prieta and La Blanca. These crude calculations result in an 
estimate of 562,000 short tons mined from the La Prieta vein and 175,000 short tons from the La 
Blanca structure up to 1909 (McCarthy, 1909). Converting these into metric tonnes using densities 
applied to the resource modeling (McCarthy applied a lower density than used in the MDA model), 
these equate to 611,000 metric tonnes from La Prieta and 178,000 tonnes from La Blanca, for a total of 
789,000 tonnes of production through 1909. 
 
The pre-1909 workings, therefore, cannot be directly modeled, and the location and true scale of these 
workings cannot be determined with certainty.  McCarthy (1909) notes that many of the pre-1909 
stopes had caved or were filled with what was considered waste at the time of mining. He estimated 
that the cutoff grades used by Palmarejo and Mexican GoldFields, Ltd (PMG) were 30 oz Ag/ton (900 
g Ag/t) from 1888 to 1901 and 20 oz Ag/ton (600 g Ag/t) from 1902 to 1909. Waste rock used to fill 
the stopes, therefore, could be of potential economic interest today in an open-pit mining scenario. In 
fact, some of these backfilled stopes were mined in the last years of the PMG underground operations 
(McCarthy). Due to the wide envelopes of lower-grade mineralization that typically encompass the 
high-grade mineralized zones at Palmarejo, caving of the stope walls could also partially fill the old 
stopes with material of potential economic importance today. Unmodeled caved and/or back-filled 
stopes are more an issue of lower density than missing stopes in a void model if: (1) the potential 
method of mining the resources is open pit; and (2) the stope-fill material does not contain deleterious 
quantities of active carbon derived from timber. 
 
The Palmarejo database records a total of 169 void and mine-fill intercepts (collectively referred to as 
void intercepts) from 110 holes, including 19 core and 92 RC holes (one void intercept was cut by both 
an RC hole and its core tail). The mean down-hole length of the void intercepts is 3.17m, with a 
minimum of 0.80m and a maximum of 15.24m. Up to 4 void intercepts are recorded for a single hole; 
McCarthy documents old stopes on hanging wall, central, and footwall portions of the main vein 
structure. Some of these void intercepts lie within the Planet Gold void model, and others were thought 
to represent natural voids, but in light of the newly reviewed historical reports the Qualified Person 
believes, and is in agreement with MDA and AMEC, that most of the void intercepts reflect mining 
voids. 
 
Production from Palmarejo stopped after the recommendations outlined by McCarthy instructed PMG 
to begin intensive development work to prepare the mine for a new mill and production increases. 
However, the production never materialized for PMG due to the onset of the Mexican Revolution. 
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 112 of 245 

Production was resumed at Palmarejo by Minas Huruapa, S.A during the period from 1979 to 1992.  
Minas Huruapa mined the areas previously developed by PMG according to McCarthy's 
recommendations.  Records were provided to Coeur and AMEC by Jorge Cordoba, General Director of 
Operations for Minas Huruapa during that time, which MDA was unaware of.  These records indicate 
that Minas Huruapa mined 168,352 tonnes of ore grading at 297 g/t Ag and 1.37 g/t Au (Table 17.4).

As a result of the newly discovered historical data, AMEC engineers were contracted by Coeur to 
produce a new void model incorporating all known historic information into its construction for use in 
the 2008 Resource estimation (Figure 17.3).  Coeur used an updated density of 2.56 for the present 
volume to tonnes calculation found that 611,000 metric tonnes were mined from La Prieta and 178,000 
tonnes from La Blanca for a grand total of 789,000 tonnes of production up to 1909.  The AMEC void 
model was constructed with these volumes in mind.  The AMEC void model shown in Figure 17.3 
below was completed in late September, 2007.  This model was reviewed by the Qualified Person 
authoring this report and the methodology is considered reasonable.  The final model was employed in 
the 2008 and 2010 Mineral Resource estimation. 
 
A nearest-neighbor estimation of possible mining voids was used to incorporate the new model into the 
final 2008 Palmarejo Resource estimation, and the same mining void estimate was used in the year-end 
2010 Palmarejo resource update.  This is an unbiased approach that is only as accurate as the drill-
density, sample locations, and logging of void intercepts. Inspection of the results shows a reasonable 
representation of the stopes known to be missing from the Planet Gold void model, as well as some 
other areas of stoping that are described in a general fashion in McCarthy's report. However, the results 
remain a crude representation of possible areas of stopes, partially filled stopes, and caved stopes. As a 
result of the void estimation, a total of 665,500 tonnes were classified as Inferred category. The 
resultant void resource model now accounts for a total of almost 1.1 million tonnes, an amount that 
overstates the approximated 1 million tonnes mined according to historic reports. In addition, 
McCarthy's calculations assume one hundred percent extraction, while pillars must have been left in 
the stopes, and he states "many thousands of tons of ore have been irretrievably lost" to future 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 113 of 245 

underground mining due to the "wasteful system pursued in the development of the mine in the past," 
which indicates that McCarthy believed ore-grade material was left between the historic stopes. For all

Determination of Geologic Domains 
 
The silver and gold mineralization at Palmarejo was divided by Coeur's geologists into three mineral 
control domains: Veins, Footwall Stockwork and Hanging wall Stockwork. These mineral domains are 
controlled by the main fault structures and fault intersections within the volcanic rock stratigraphy.  It 
is likely that the vein and stockwork zones are also controlled by lithology with the mineral zones 
preferentially located within specific volcano-stratigraphic horizons where the rock is more brittle and 
able to retain open spaces.  Data outside these mineral domains and below the topographic surface 
were considered to be located in the Host domain. 
 
The most strongly mineralized unit is the vein domain, formed mainly by quartz-vein breccias. The 
veins are logged in the drilling database as "QVBX".  The Footwall (FW) and Hanging wall (HW) 
domains contain sheeted quartz veins, located above and below, but always nearby, the main vein 
structures. The significant sheeted veins in both the hanging walls and footwalls were graphically 
defined to minimize over-estimation of grade in the stock work surrounding the main veins.  Inclusion

in this domain is dominated by quartz percentage, generally over 15%, and mineralization at 
significant grades above surrounding material, but not following a rigid rule. The information is 
extracted from the drill hole intervals. 
 
Given that most of the drilling is RC, differentiation between sheeted vein type and quartz vein breccia 
can be difficult using chip samples. After reviewing the codes available in the drill hole database, 
Behre Dolbear was of the opinion that these domains, in many cases, have been misinterpreted.  Behre 
Dolbear recommends that a complete re-logging of the drill data be completed, with a focus on the 
domains used to create a sectional interpretation that would produce a more consistent definition of the 
units. 
 
La Blanca Structure 
 
Sixty-six vertical cross sections were interpreted by Coeur's geologists for the La Blanca Vein and the 
associated hanging wall and footwall stockwork zones. Vertical sections were supplemented by 
geology mapping and geological interpretation on 9, 20m-spaced, level plans in the 76 Clavo area. 
APGS reviewed and edited the geologic interpretation prepared by Coeur on vertical sections and level 
plans and constructed preliminary geological solids.  These preliminary solids were contoured on 10m 
level plans and the final interpretation was completed in plan with all available drill hole and chip-
channel geology and assay information.  Poly-line interpretations from vertical section and level plan 
were used to construct the final mineral-type solids (Table 17.5).

La Patria and La Victoria Structures 
 
A total of 54 vertical sections were interpreted by Coeur's geologists for the La Patria and La Victoria 
Veins and stockwork zones.  Behre Dolbear geologists used this Coeur interpretation and re-interpreted 
all sections. Mineralization plunge and dip, and the projection of the true drill hole intercept positions 
in relation to the section plane were used as the basis for interpretation. 
 
Behre Dolbear digitized the domain outlines into Gems™ software, fixing the spatial position of the 
contacts where necessary. The polygon vertices were not "snapped" to the drill hole intervals due to 
the distance of most drill holes from the section plane, unless the veins were less than 2 meters from 
the section plane. 
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 116 of 245 

Behre Dolbear used the domain polygons on vertical sections and drill holes to create an interpretation 
on horizontal plans every 10m, covering the entire vertical extension of the deposit. The points from 
the horizontal polygons are, necessarily, snapped to a vertex of the vertical polygons, when the plan 
intercepts a section. This allows an easy and robust reconciliation between the two orthogonal sets of 
polygons, also facilitating the process of solid generation. 
 
The resulting polygons were identified and assigned to a domain (Veins, Hangingwall stockwork and 
Footwall stockwork) of one of the main structures: La Prieta. Behre Dolbear constructed the domain 
solids using both vertical and horizontal sets of polygons. Table 17.6 shows the names of the solids 
defined in this study by Resource Unit, Area, and Domain (Solid).

The resulting solids are complex and some triangles in the wireframe presented self-intersection 
problems, which were not all resolved. However, the solids are considered valid for volume 
calculations and other uses. Behre Dolbear submitted the solids for an internal validation, and it was 
Behre Dolbear's opinion that the existing solids accurately represent the interpretation of the domains 
at La Prieta and that they are acceptable for resource estimation. 
 
17.1.4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
 
La Blanca Structure 
 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the La Blanca Structure, and the 76 Clavo and 108 Clavo areas in 
particular, began during the modeling of the mineral type model by examining the geology coding 
along with the gold and silver assays.  APGS calculated statistics on the raw gold and silver sample 
assays weighted by sample length; histograms and log-probability plots were generated for metal by 
mineral type.  
 
During a field examination at the Palmarejo Mine in July 2010, discussions were held with Coeur mine 
geologists and senior mine management regarding the differences seen between the geology and metal 
grade predictions of the previous resource model and those interpreted using the additional resource 
definition drilling, detail geology mapping and grade control sampling from nine developed 
underground levels now available at the 76 Clavo.  Examination of the previous model with the new 
geology interpretation and sample assay results showed that the model had over-estimated the 
continuity of the mineralization and metal grades.  Given this reality, mineral controls other than the 
"vein" and "stockwork" mineral types were discussed for the year-end 2010 update resource model at 
the 76 and 108 Clavo.   An "indicator" or "probability-assisted" technique for "domaining" the model 
was planned for the area to explore how well this method may honor the recognized metal distribution 
and reconcile with production. 
 
Using the vein and stockwork solid models as domains and structural trends to guide an interpolation, 
indicator/probability models were built for gold and silver at the following levels based on 
visualization of the data and discontinuities in the log-probability plots for each metal: 
 
Au: 0.4 ppm, 1.5 ppm, 9 ppm and 25 ppm,  
Ag: 15 ppm, 350 ppm, 1500 ppm. 
 
Indicator probability models were interpolated by ordinary kriging using the indicator variogram at the 
selected grade levels. All composite data, drill holes and channels, were used in generation of the 
probability models.  The probability models were contoured at a 0.5 probability level which mimics 
what would be contoured by hand but with the benefit of using the data in 3D (not projected to a plane) 
and using continuity measures from the indicator variogram models.   The indicator shells were 
checked on screen with the sample data and the geology interpretation to ensure that they honored the 
input data.    Ideally, these solids would be contoured on level plans and re-interpreted to "smooth out" 
abrupt edges and produce a more continuous solid; this was not done for the 2010 model given time 
constraints.  Review and edit of these probability models is recommended by the Qualified Person 
prior to any subsequent resource model updates. Examples of the gold and silver probability models 
are shown in Figure 17.5 and Figure 17.6.

Both gold and silver are focused at the intersection of the main La Blanca Vein with the N-S Vein and 
the Internal Vein1 and the intervening stockwork zones.  These boundaries were used to guide the 
estimator with search dimensions varying depending on the probability domain.

Outlier Grade Capping 
 
La Blanca Structure 
 
Grade capping for the 76 and 108 Clavo areas of the La Blanca Structure was done in two passes.  The 
initial pass was done before sample compositing to limit the influence of short, very high-grade, 
samples on the composites.  These initial trimming levels were established for each metal domain 
based on discontinuities on the log-probability plots for each mineral type.  Given that an indicator 
method was to be used to help limit the influence of the higher grade composites at the grade 
estimation stage, these initial trimming levels were kept very high in an effort to only affect the 
extremely anomalous samples (Table 17.7).

The initial trimming for the 76 and 108 Clavo samples did not change the sample statistics 
significantly. After compositing the drill hole samples to a common length, discussed below, additional 
trimming levels were established for each metal domain based on discontinuities in the log-probability 
plots and using "indicator at lag 1" plots that provide a measure of continuity and correlation of 
adjacent samples at increasing grade levels down-the-hole.   Levels were selected that were in the same 
order-of-magnitude as the trimming levels selected for the year-end 2008 grade modeling (see 
"Palmarejo Project Technical Report" dated January 1, 2009, available on Sedar.com).  The final 
trimming levels selected for the La Blanca Structure, including the Rosario Area, are presented in 
Table 17.9.

La Patria and La Victoria Structures 
 
To define the high grade outliers for the La Patria and La Victoria Vein zones, Behre Dolbear used the 
industry standard method of determining mineralization cap grades with log-log cumulative probability 
plots. Behre Dolbear capped grades using cumulative probability plot analysis for the composites and 
applied capped grades to composites for the interpolation. Table 17.10 shows the Behre Dolbear 
capping parameters used for each domain.

Sample Compositing 
 
La Blanca Structure 
 
Drill hole samples along the La Blanca structure were composited to a constant 1.52m from the toe of 
the hole; this length matched the RC sample length and was reasonable for the core holes given their 
average sample length of 1m.  Given that the new definition drill holes were sampled only where the 
logging geologists recognized mineralization, un-sampled drill hole intervals were assigned a grade of 
0.001 g/t Au and 0.01 g/t Ag for the composting. This is more conservative than assigning a "not-
sampled" code, but justified given the interpretation that the zones were not mineralized and did not 
warrant sampling.   
 
Composite samples were coded with the appropriate mineral type and metal domain using the final 
modeled solids.  Composite statistics for the La Blanca Structure are summarized in Table 17.11

La Patria and La Victoria Structures 
 
A composite table was created in the Gems™ database containing the same fields as in the assays 
table. Nominal RC sample length is about 1.52 m (twenty foot rods with four samples each). Core 
samples are typically around 1.00 m long. 
 
Composites were generated down the hole with a length of 1.52 m and were also constrained by the 
domain solid limits. Composites shorter than the defined length were not redistributed to the other 
composites within the interpreted solid. 
 
The statistics for composite data are summarized in Table 17.12. Although the nominal defined 
composite length was 1.52 m, the mean composite length is around 1.49 m due to the effect of not 
redistributing short intervals to other composites. The comparison of the raw assay data to composited 
drill data was not completed, since the composited interval length is 1.52 meters and is equal to the RC 
drill length.  In the Qualified Person's opinion, the observed variation in length is not significant since 
94% of the composites are 1.52 meters. Samples inside voids were not taken into consideration.

Spatial Correlation Studies - Variography 
Spatial correlation studies along the La Blanca structure began with visualizing the composite data 
along with the mineral type models to identify the main directions of continuity in each area along the 
structure.  Once the main axes were identified for the 76, 108, and Rosario areas, correlograms were 
calculated along the selected axes and the orthogonal directions for establishing the ranges in each 
direction and the anisotropy ratios for each domain.  Down-hole correlograms were calculated and 
modeled to establish the nugget effect and to view the ranges of continuity along the drill strings 
which, ideally in these systems, are orthogonal, or nearly so, to the vein structures.   
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 127 of 245 

Spatial correlation studies for La Blanca were done using the composite data coded by mineral type 
and indicator domain.  Experimental correlogram models by mineral type for the 76 Clavo and Rosario 
areas are summarized in Table 17.13.  Spatial correlation measures by the metal indicator domains 
were based on the indicator variogram at the median grade for each domain.  The experimental models 
for the 76 Clavo are summarized in Table 17.14.

Most models show the major axis of continuity is oriented in the down-dip direction of the La Blanca 
structure. The correlogram models parameters for the 76 Clavo were also used for the 108 Clavo; the 
orientations of the models were changed to honor the orientation of the La Blanca structure in the 108 
Clavo area: -53o dip in the 200o azimuth direction. 

  
Behre Dolbear created composite correlograms for gold and silver separately for each domain along 
the La Patria and La Victoria structures using the Mine Sight Data Analysis computer program. The 
Qualified Person of this report has reviewed the experimental models with Behre Dolbear while the 
work was ongoing.  The correlogram models and orientations are reasonable and agree with the main 
axes of orientation of the modeled vein and stockwork solids.  The only issue noted in this review was 
that the Behre Dolbear correlogram models show zonal anisotropism where the first variogram 
structures are oriented differently from the second variogram structures.  This is likely more a function 
of data orientation than of the actual continuity directions; however, the effect on the OK estimates is 
not significant.

Directional correlograms were built according to the main vein structure orientations and using lags of 
15 m. 3D models were fitted with two spherical structures and the nugget effect. The correlogram 
parameters used for grade estimation are summarized below in Table 17.15.

17.1.5 Block Model Estimation Methodology Palmarejo 
 
Block Model Geometry 
 
A block model framework was used to cover the area modeled for the solids with extra room to include 
a pit. The block model is of a percent type, i.e. the proportions and respective grades of each mineral 
domain are stored in each block.  Four percentage folders to represent the mineralized domains: Vein, 
HW, FW and Host and additionally defined folders for "air" and "void" percentages were created. 
Once metal grades were estimated into the percent model, the model was block diluted by calculating a 
weighted average block grade using the block percent and block grade for each material type.  The 
block diluted model was used to calculate Resources and Reserves for this report. 
 
Table 17.16 shows the block model geometry.  The block model is rotated 450 counter-clockwise about 
the origin. 

Table 17.16: Block Model Geometry

Z 1,270 2.5 570 228 

            * Origin is defined at the top comer of the block located at the lowest west and south coordinates and highest elevation. 
 
 
Block Model Grade Estimation 
 
La Blanca Structure 
 
Gold and Silver metal grades were interpolated into the percentage block model using Ordinary 
Kriging (OK) and inverse-distance-cubed (ID3) algorithms.  Search dimensions were based on 
variogram model; dimensions along the major and intermediate axes were increased until most, if not 
all, blocks in the modeled areas (vein or HW or FW stockwork material) received an estimate.  The 
search for the OK estimate was ellipsoidal.  The search for the ID3 estimate was an ellipsoidal-octant 
search using a minimum of 1 informed octant and a maximum of 6 composites (2 drill holes) per 
octant.  An octant search was used for the ID3 algorithm to help "decluster" the estimates. Boundary 
conditions between the mineral types were kept hard, allowing only those composites within the 
mineral type to estimate grade.  Boundary conditions between the indicator domains were varied hard 
or soft depending on the mean and declustered mean comparisons with the block estimates.  The other 
estimation parameters for the La Blanca Structure are summarized in Table 17.17.

La Patria and La Victoria Structures 
 
The coefficient of variation (CV) of the composites is relatively low due to the separation of the minor 
sheeted veins and the grade capping for most of the domains along the La Patria and La Victoria 
Structures (See Table 17.12). APGS used the Ordinary Kriging and Inverse Distance Weighting 
methods to estimate grades into the block model from capped composites. Composites flagged as 
falling inside voids were discarded for the estimation.  
 
Because the orientation of the veins is variable, the model set-up defined three different search 
domains in the La Prieta area to enable the use of search ellipses with different orientations. Figure 
17.7 shows a plan view of the search domains with drill holes and a slice of the La Prieta and La 
Victoria veins.   Block selection for each search domain is completed during the process of grade 
estimation, and a corresponding search ellipse is then applied according to the Kriging profile defined 
for each La Prieta vein and stockwork. 
 
The search domains were created geometrically to better fit the search ellipsoids to the changes of the 
geological solid orientations. Three search domains, Rosario, Tucson and Chapotillo areas of the La 
Prieta vein area were defined and applied to the estimation profiles.  The domains were limited 
according to the rows and columns of the block model.

Figure 17.7: Domains Solid Model - Plan View 

 
 

Behre Dolbear implemented a single estimation pass with a fixed search ellipse for gold and silver in 
each geological domain defined in the La Prieta area. Metal grades were not estimated into the Host 
domain along the La Prieta structure given that all significant mineralized intercepts were modeled as 
parallel veins or stockwork zones. A total of 66 kriging profiles were used by Behre Dolbear for the 
year-end 2010 Resource block model estimation. 
 
The Ordinary Kriging estimation was completed with an ellipsoidal search.  The minimum number of 
samples for the stockwork material was 1 sample, this would cause all of the blocks coded as 
stockwork to be filled.  The minimum number of samples applied to the vein domains was 2.  The 
maximum number of samples used for the kriging estimation was set to 15 to minimize the dilution of 
the high grade mineralization. 
 
The Inverse Distance Weighting resource estimation was completed using an octant search.  The 
parameters used to restrict the interpolation include a minimum of composites in 3 octants before a 
block is estimated.  A maximum of 5 composites were allowed from one octant for estimation 
purposes.  The maximum number of composites was restricted to 8 samples to minimize the smoothing 
effect of estimation using inverse distance to the 3rd power. 
 
Despite the short composite length (1.49m on average), only two composites per hole were allowed 
during the mineral estimation for both estimators. The expected result, in conjunction with search 
ellipses, is to force the use of more than one hole along the mineralization orientation.  The definition 
of the vein and stock work solids emphasizes grade continuity where it exists. The complete set of 
search ellipse parameters for La Prieta and La Victoria is shown in Table 17.18.

17.1.6 Block Model Validation 
 
APGS used several validation methods to evaluate the quality of the grade estimation.  
 
Visual Validation 
 
A visual inspection of the block model in section and plan view was the first validation method used. 
Figure 17.8 to Figure 17.11 show example plans and sections through the La Blanca vein with blocks 
and composites colored by gold and silver grade.  The block grade estimates honor the composites and 
the anisotropy observed in the deposit.

Grade Model and Composite Comparisons 
 
Another simple check on the grade models is a comparison of the block model and composite statistics 
to check for global and local bias.  Block grades were compared with length-weighted and cell-
decluster weighted composite statistics.   
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 141 of 245 

Block grade statistics for all measured and indicated blocks were compared with length- and decluster-
weighted drill hole composite statistics for a "global" bias check and with the mean drill hole and 
channel composite grades on  a block by block basis.   A simple cell declustering method was used in a 
quick attempt to produce a "nearest-neighbor-like" model for comparison with the ID3 and OK model.  
The decluster weights locally show some questionable results given that, for some of the domains, the 
declustered composite mean is slightly higher than the length-weighted composite mean.  Block and 
composite statistics are summarized for the entire Palmarejo Project in Table 17.19. 
 
The results for the La Blanca Structure are acceptable with some slight apparent over-estimation in one 
indicator domain for gold and two indicator domains for silver in the 76-108 Clavo Areas.  The 
Rosario Area estimates along the La Blanca Structure agree well with the declustered composite 
means.  Upon close review of the La Prieta grade models, some inconsistencies were noted in some of 
the minor modeled veins and stockwork zones.  The octant search and some errors in composite 
selection have produced some questionable results locally in the less important mineral types.  
Estimates along the main La PrietaVein, 80% of the mineral model, are acceptable.   While not 
desirable, the estimation problems in the minor host domains along La Prieta have not significantly 
impacted the resource model, with differences in contained metal of -2.0% for gold and -1.7% for 
silver for the Measured and Indicated resource categories; these errors will be corrected in subsequent 
resource model updates.

The visual and statistical model checks showed that the ID3 models were generally better conditioned 
to the local data and showed less grade smoothing and extrapolation than the OK models.  For these 
reasons, the ID3 models were used for resource reporting and subsequent stope and pit design work.   
No volume-variance adjustments were made to the metal models.

17.1.7 Resource Classification 
 
APGS defined a set of Resource classification parameters based on geological and grade continuity. 
Given the different estimation methodology from the previous year's model, all block attributes used 
in the previous classification scheme were not available for the current classification.  The parameters 
shown in Table 17.20 are similar to those used previously and produced similar final results. 
 

Table 17.20: Resource Classification Parameters

Indicated 15m to <45m for Vein/Stockwork 6 / 2 
Inferred >45m for Vein/Stockwork 3 / 1 
Inferred All Host Material 3 / 1 

 
Because of the uncertainty in the interpretation of some portions of the voids model, the voids solid 
model was separated into three categories: 
 
Low Confidence 
Medium Confidence 
High Confidence 
 
Blocks were then downgraded to the Inferred category using the following rule: 
 
If the block has more than 25% of low confidence voids, or 
If the block has more than 75% of medium confidence voids.

17.1.8 Statement of Mineral Reserves and Resources Palmarejo Deposit 
 
Mineral Reserves 
Mineral Reserves are based on the year-end 2010 updated block model as well as current surface and 
underground mine designs (design criteria and basis for which are available in Section 22 of this 
report).  Reserve cut-offs  are based on current operating costs and current 3-year trailing average 
metal prices of $1,025 per oz Au and $16.25 per oz Ag.  . Reserve estimates were obtained by applying 
a 1.27 g/t AuEq (gold equivalent) cutoff against Measured and Indicated Resource blocks within the 
remaining ultimate pit and a 2.64 g/t AuEq cutoff against fully diluted underground stopes.   
 
The Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, effective January 1, 2011, based on Measured and 
Indicated Mineral Resources, are summarized in Table 17.21. (See Section 22 for detailed explanation 
of Mineral Reserves estimation.) 
 
The Mineral Reserves summarized in Table 17.21 are based on an open pit cut-off grade of 1.27 g/t 
AuEq and an underground cut-off of 2.64 g/t AuEq. These cut-offs were calculated using metal prices 
of US$16.25/ oz silver and US$1,025/ oz gold.  The Qualified Persons are not aware of any 
environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-economic, marketing, or political issues that could 
materially affect the Palmarejo Mineral Reserves.

Mineral Resources 
 
This section refers only to the "Palmarejo" deposit portion of the Palmarejo District Resources. The 
"Guadalupe" and "La Patria" deposit portions of the Palmarejo District are discussed separately in 
Sections 17.2 and 17.3 of this report. The Mineral Resource for Palmarejo is effective January 1, 2011. 
The Mineral Reserve is a subset of the Resource.  The open pit portion of the Resource was based on a 
Whittle™ shell using current open pit, processing and G&A costs and the Resource metal price 
assumptions of $1,300/oz Au and $20.00/oz Ag; the resultant cut-off for this portion was 1.01 g/t. The 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 145 of 245 

underground portion of the Resource was estimated at current underground, processing and G&A costs 
and the same metal price assumptions, resulting in an underground Resource cutoff of 2.08 g/t AuEq. 
 
Tables 17.22 and 17.23 show the Mineral Resource for Palmarejo inclusive and exclusive of Mineral 
Reserves, respectively.  Mineral Resources in addition to Mineral Reserves have not demonstrated 
economic viability.

17.2 Mineral Resource Estimation Methodology Guadalupe Deposit 
 
17.2.1 Data 
 
AMEC Mining and Metals was contracted to update the Guadalupe block model from data collected 
and interpreted by Coeur.  A model was created for estimating the silver and gold Resources at 
Guadalupe from data generated by Coeur through September, 2010, including RC and core drilling 
results. Aerial photography was used to create a topographic model with two-meter contours. These 
data were incorporated into a digital database, and all subsequent modeling of the Guadalupe Mineral 
Resource was performed using GEMCOM Gems™ mining software. 
 
17.2.2 Density 
 
Density values for the Guadalupe project were obtained by both Planet Gold and Coeur personnel over 
a period of several years using standard water-immersion methods on dried and waxed whole-core 
samples of mineralized and unmineralized geologic units. 
 
In Table 17.24, density values by rock type and the corresponding number of measurements is listed.  
Even though different rock types are listed for the main ore vein/breccia zones, which host the gold 
and silver mineralization, these units are complexly intermixed with each other and cannot separated 
out in a practical mining or modeling scenario so weighted averages are used for the densities.  
 
  



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 147 of 245 

Table 17.24: Guadalupe Specific-Gravity Statistics: Mineralized Core Samples 

 
 
During 2009, Coeur has established a new protocol for density measurements that includes 
measurements on the stockwork zones, which are modeled separately.  To date density information 
shows the stockwork zone to be similar to the vein/breccia zones.  These zones are modeled separately 
but do have the same bulk density.  The density assigned to the year-end 2010 Guadalupe model was

17.2.3 Deposit Geology Pertinent to Resource Modeling 
 
The primary control of the silver and gold at Guadalupe is the northwest-striking quartz-vein structure, 
which dips to the northeast at approximately 50°. The structural zone that hosts the mineralization is 
exposed at the surface as either a distinct quartz vein breccia unit or as an intensely clay altered zone.  
 
Near surface, the structure is usually less than 10 meters wide but as it continues down dip the 
structure widens out into a 10 to +50 meter wide zone of a multiphase quartz-carbonate breccia and 
adjacent stockwork zones.  The main high-grade mineralization is within the massive multiphase 
quartz-carbonate vein breccias that are interpreted as the main epithermal fluid conduits.  These main 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 148 of 245 

structures are sub-parallel along dip and form typical sygmoidal loops and extensional veins into the 
footwall and hanging wall.  Between the main structures are blocks of wall rock, from small to vary 
large, that have been variable fractured and now host quartz-carbonate stockworks. Depending on the 
frequency of the stockwork veins and veinlets these zones can be of ore grade.   
 
The massive quartz-carbonate vein breccias were modeled as continuous veins following typical 
geologic geometries found in extensional systems and the stockwork zones were modeled as an 
adjacent zones or envelopes of variable mineralization. The model was developed on paper sections 
with the use of core photos, drill logs and physical inspection of the core and then transferred into 
GEMCOM Gems™ by constructing polylines on screen and then a set of final 3-D solids were 
constructed.  Quartz-vein stockwork mineralization occurs in the walls of the structure. The drill data 
demonstrate there is silver-gold zonation, whereby silver:gold ratios decrease with depth. 
 
Determination of Geologic Domains 
 
Guadalupe grade modeling was performed in a similar manner as Palmarejo, in that vertical section 
interpretations were used to create domain solids in Gems™ for coding the block models directly; no 
plan interpretations were completed. Silver and gold were modeled and estimated independently. Gold-
equivalent grades were used to provide additional grade constraints on the geologic interpretation with 
respect to silver and gold grades due to zonation issues, but not used in the estimation.  Domaining was 
important at Guadalupe in that it provided encapsulation of the data for the following tasks and 
validation: 
 

 Optimal Composite length determination from raw data 
 Domain Codes in Gems™  must match those in Acquire – Data verification 
 Capping – minimize mixed domain populations so that statistics and related interpolations 

will have properly constrained outliers   
 Polymetallic relationships (evaluate the use of Multivariate Analysis) 
 Continuity Analysis and Variography 
 Domains act as the interpolation envelope 
 Domain to interpolation parameters must be of high quality or the resource estimate will 

fail validation tests and produce poor resultant Mineral Resources & Reserves. 
 
Silver and Gold Domaining 
 
Vertical sections oriented at 045° azimuth were plotted on intervals 5m across the Guadalupe deposit; 
the section locations were chosen to best fit the drill data and minimize projection issues. The 
topographic profile and drill-hole traces were placed on the sections, with silver and gold assays 
colored by the grade population ranges, as well as lithologic codes. These vertical sections were then 
plotted for hardcopy interpretation of the Guadalupe mineralized structures by Coeur NA Exploration.  
This interpretation process also utilized core photos, drill logs, and physical inspection of core. 
 
Once the hardcopy interpretations were completed the individual vertical sections were used by Coeur 
Technical Services to create wireframes (domain solids) in Gems™ using 3D rings and tie lines 
snapped to assay vertices to ensure inclusion of the correct intervals in the domain solids.   



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 149 of 245 

Once the domain solids were completed and validated they were used to back-code the raw assay table.  
This back-coding allowed the raw assays for each domain to be extracted for descriptive statistics and 
metal to assay length correlation analysis.  The domain codes assigned to each geologic domain is 
shown in Table 17.25 below.

The QVBX (Quartz Vein Breccia) is contained in the Master 1, 2 and Las Animas Vein domain solids 
and restricted to areas with the highest-grade mineralization (in-situ vein) with respect to geology. 
Additional domains are the FW, HW and Stockwork which are potentially mineable zones that may 
manifest into larger mineralized envelopes with additional drilling.   
 
The Stockwork domain contains lower grade material for use as a dilution solid for Reserve 
development.  The solids for the Stockwork were not created in Gemcom, but instead constructed in 
Leap Frog which is a modeling software used to create complex solids in a timely manner.  These 
Stockwork solids were produced in Leap Frog by applying anisotropic interpolations of indicators 
based on coded drill hole data (i.e. the domains were given a 1 or 0).  The resultant solids were good 
representations of the Stockwork zones surrounding the main QVBX ore bodies and took a fraction of 
the time it would have using normal methods.  Figure 17.12 shows the resultant Stockwork solid and 
how it is less rigid than the manually constructed QVBX solids.   Once the Stockwork solids were 
complete in Leap Frog they were exported as TRI files and imported into Gemcom for validation and 
use in the year-end 2010 Mineral Resource interpolation process.

17.2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
 
During analysis for the year-end 2009 model, the silver and gold raw grade distributions from all 
available drill hole assays within geologic domain wireframes were used to determine grade to length 
correlations and define optimal composite lengths (Table 17.19).  Drill hole assays were back-coded 
according to mineral-domain envelopes in an effort to ensure data isolation. Descriptive statistics for 
raw assay population distribution of the silver and gold assays within each of the mineral domains 
were examined to define grade trends, sample length to metal bias, and optimize compositing length.  
Table 17.26 shows the raw sample length statistics for each domain for year-end 2009.  Figure 17.13 
shows a box whisker plot related to the sample length statistics.  Although the weighted global 
composite length for the all domains combined is .89m (Domain 10 was not used as it is waste), the 
optimal composite length based on the domain with the majority of the metal was chosen to be .75m 
(QVBX Domain Code 100,101,102).  As stated earlier, there are a number of raw composites greater 
than .75 meters that are critical in the interpolation process.  In an effort not to avoid the decompositing 
of this drill data a composite length of 1.50 meters (approximately twice the optimal length) was used 
in the year-end 2009 Mineral Resource model.  This composite length was deemed appropriate for use 
in the year-end 2010 model as well, which was used to estimate the Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve reported herein.

Figure 17.13: Box Whisker Plot of Raw Assay Lengths 

 
 
Correlation analysis between the raw assay sample length vs. silver and gold in the Master 1 vein was 
carried out.  There were no correlations found between sample length and metal.  It should also be 
noted that there was only a moderate correlation between silver and gold (R=0.411).  This lack of a 
strong Ag to Au correlation is thought to be due to a vertical metal zonation within the Guadalupe 
system. 
 
As a validation, Coeur staff reviewed cross sections of the drill hole assays encapsulated in the domain 
solids and found no errors.  Domain data is encapsulated in the appropriate solids and no multi-modal 
relationships were observed in the associated frequency distributions.   
 
Tables 17.27 and 17.28 show the raw assay descriptive statistics for gold and silver.  There is a high 
coefficient of variation (CV) for Au and Ag in all the domains which is typical of precious metals 
deposits.

Compositing 
 
In the previous 2007 Mineral Resource estimate MDA (Mine Development Associates) used capped 
drill hole assays composited down-hole at 1.52m intervals to avoid de-compositing the RC samples. 
Since that estimation Coeur has added 242 drill holes and implemented more detailed sampling 
utilizing shorter geologic breaks.  A statistical review of the raw assay data outlined in the previous 
section revealed that a.75 meter composite length would be optimal.  As a result, a 1.50m composite 
length was used for the year-end 2010 Mineral Resource model in an effort to avoid decompositing 
raw assays and at the same time preserve the optimal composite length based on the Master 1 & 2 
QVBX domains.   
 
Due to the sharp contacts typical of the vein mineralization, only assays back-coded from domain 
solids were used to create composites for that domain. Tables 17.22 and 17.23 show summary statistics 
of the gold and silver composites at a 1.50m down-hole length controlled by domain back-coding.  A 
function, that included small incomplete 1.50m composites in the previous composite, was used in the 
compositing process to minimize any sample support issues during variography.  There were a small 
amount of residual composites near domain solid margins and they were removed prior to variography 
to further minimize support problems, but retained for the final interpolation process. 

 
Composite Capping 
 
The 1.50m composites for gold and silver were capped using disintegration analysis, log probability, 
mean variance, and histogram plots.  The capping statistics shown in Table 17.29 below are for all of 
the Guadalupe domains with respect to Ag and Au resulting from the capping analysis.  The full 
statistical output for the uncapped and capped 1.50 meter composites are also shown below in Tables 
17.30 through 17.33.

The capping analysis in 2009 combined a disintegration analysis (% step function) on ordered (ranked) 
composite data and statistical graphics from Snowden Supervisor software.  Disintegration analysis 
uses a 15% step function to denote the changes or discontinuity in an ordered dataset.  It is used here in 
conjunction with probability, mean variance, and histogram plots from Snowden's Supervisor software 
to determine the optimal capping grade for each metal by domain.  The 2010 composites were capped 
using the values suggested by the 2009 analysis.    
 
Variography 
Variography was performed on 1.50m capped composites for Au and Ag.  The residual composites 
less than half the composite length of 1.50 meters were removed for variography, but retained in the 
interpolation process.  This removal of residuals was done to provide the maximum sample support 
during the variographic analysis.  Both 2D and 3D validations of the search ellipse orientations was 
carried out to ensure that the spatial relationships were correct prior to interpolation.   
 
Down-hole variograms were generated to define the nugget for gold and silver.  Variograms were 
explored and constructed according to primary structural orientations and appropriate lags based on 
data spacing.  3D spherical models were used and fitted with two structures and the nugget. The 
variogram parameters for Au and Ag are summarized in Table 17.34 below, along with an example of 
the reference cubes used to check orientations.

17.2.5 Block Model Estimation Methodology Guadalupe 
 
Block Model Geometry 
 
A block model framework was created to cover the modeled area and encapsulate all geologic domains 
to be used in the Guadalupe year-end 2010 interpolation process.  The block model is a percent type; 
i.e. the proportions and respective grades (as well as other attributes) of each domain are stored in each 
block.  The Guadalupe block model geometry was rotated 45 deg counter-clockwise to orient the 
blocks relative to the strike of the Guadalupe domains.  Figure 17.14 below shows the rotated block 
model geometry and the Guadalupe solids inside.  The encapsulation of the geologic domains by the 
block model geometry is very important for full interpolation of all the coded domain data. 

 
Figure 17.14: Block Model Geometry 

 

 
 

Table 17.35 shows the block model geometry and model limits encapsulating the domain solids.  The 
domain codes, percent, and density were assigned to the block model by using geologic solids (Figure 
17.12).

Block Model Grade Estimation 
 
Although the coefficient of variation (CV) for raw assays was high for most of the domains (see Tables 
17.27 and 17.28), Ordinary Kriging was used to estimate grades into the block model from capped 
composites which show greatly reduced CV values (see Tables 17.30 to 17.33).   
 
The orientations of the Guadalupe veins are variable and unwrinkling of the main domain solids should 
be evaluated prior to the next Mineral Resource estimate in 2011.  This process would remove artifact 
interpolation lines in the final model that result from estimation in wrinkled space due to the ellipse vs. 
vein strike changes.  This method may also provide a valuable tool to see potential ore shoots in 
unwrinkled space.  One cautionary note with respect to unwrinkled interpolation is that the changes in 
strike and dip are directly related to mineralization (ore shoot development).  Hence, the unwrinkled 
interpolation needs to be tempered with geology. 
 
Two estimation passes were implemented that used incremental search ellipse radii for gold and silver 
in each geologic domain controlled by each pass.  The advantage of using different passes is that 
different restrictions may be applied to each pass; i.e. a minimum number of composites to estimate a 
block, or a maximum number of composites from a certain drillhole. 
 
The first and second pass search distances take into consideration the variographic parameters (Table 
17.34). The first pass was designed to fill the geologic solids with estimated grades.  The major and 
semi-major axes approximate the average strike and dip orientations, respectively, of the principal vein 
structures. The second pass was designed to over write block using more restrictive estimation 
parameters to give a more local estimate.  Table 17.36 below shows the general interpolation pass 
parameters.

17.2.6 Block Model Validation 

 
Visual Validation 
 
A visual inspection of the block model in plan and vertical section was the first validation method 
used.  Figure 17.15 is an example of a vertical section (section Row_222) showing the Master1 vein 
surrounded by the Stockwork domain with blocks and composites colored by silver grade. Figure 
17.16 shows the same section colored by gold grade. The block grade estimates honor the composites 
and the anisotropy observed in the deposit. There were no observable high-grade over-projections, 
except in a few blocks at the lower extensions of the veins, and from the first kriging pass; however, 
this pass was used to define Inferred Resources only.

17.2.7 Classification Scheme 
 
The grade interpolation results were used in combination with 3D distance maps and grade x true 
thickness contours.  This method allowed the use of the pass confidence with both distance and 
geologic continuity assessment.  This type of classification was constructed manually through the use 
of polylines on long sections delineating areas of continuity based on the three criteria stated above.  In 
general the average drill spacing used for measured was 20 meters, 35 meters for Indicated and the 
remaining vein was classified as Inferred.  It should be noted that because drilling is not typically at a 
fix and constant spacing the distance criteria used for Indicated classification, which was done 
manually based also on geologic and grade x true thickness continuity, had some slight variance 
beyond 35 meters.   
 
Following the completion of the silver and gold estimations and classification of blocks, the 3m x 3m x 
3m block model was passed to Coeur engineers for Reserve definition work.  There was no block 
optimization with respect to QKNA (Quantitative Kriging Neighborhood Analysis) and the block sizes 
for the Guadalupe block model were chosen strictly based on mining method. 
 
17.2.8 Statement of Mineral Reserves and Resources Guadalupe Deposit 
 
The Guadalupe Resources conform to the definitions adopted by the Canadian Institute of Mining, 
Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM"), December, 2005, and meet the criteria of those definitions. The 
Qualified Person for this Technical Report has reviewed the work done by AMEC and believes the 
methods employed were appropriate and that the resultant Mineral Resources and Reserves are 
compliant with CIM NI 43-101 standards. 
 
The Mineral Reserve and Resource for Guadalupe, effective January 1, 2011, is shown below.  Mineral 
Reserves were calculated using metals prices of $1,025/oz Au and $16.25/oz Ag in conjunction with 
cost and recovery assumptions. The Mineral Reserve cutoff grade for Guadalupe using these criteria 
was 2.29 g/t AuEq for underground mining (there are no open pit reserves at Guadalupe at this time), 
and the resultant Mineral Reserves are summarized in metric tonne units in Table 17.37.

Mineral Resources were calculated using metals prices of $1,300/oz Au and $20.00/oz Ag in 
conjunction with cost and recovery assumptions.  The Mineral Resource cutoff grade for Guadalupe 
using these criteria was 1.8 g/t AuEq and the resultant Mineral Resources are summarized in metric

17.3 Mineral Resource Estimation Methodology La Patria 
 
17.3.1 Data 
 
Gold and silver mineralization at La Patria was modeled by MDA in September 2007 using data 
generated by Planet Gold through late September 2006 (See Section 11 of this report), including 
geologic mapping and RC and core drilling results.  Aerial photography was used to create a 
topographic model with two-meter contours.  These data were incorporated into a digital database, and 
all subsequent modeling of the La Patria Resource was created using Surpac® mining software. 
 
17.3.2 Material Density 
 
Planet Gold personnel performed dry bulk specific-gravity measurements using standard water-
immersion methods on four dried and waxed whole-core samples of mineralized units (Table 17.40). 
 

Table 17.40: La Patria Specific-Gravity Statistics: Mineralized Core Samples 
 

 
A density of 2.40 g/m3 was assigned to the modeled mineralization.  A significant amount of 
additional specific-gravity measurements is needed for future modeling. 
 
17.3.3 Geological Model 
 
Gold and silver mineralization at La Patria occurs in northwest-trending quartz ± carbonate breccia 
veins enveloped by variably developed quartz hydrothermal breccias. These mineralized structures dip 
45-50° to the northeast and are accompanied by associated quartz-stockwork zones. The breccia veins 
range in thickness from less than a meter up to 15 meters in true width. Several hanging-wall splays 
occur within the upper 100m of the system, and these merge with the principal structure at depth. 
Quartz-stockwork zones are typically developed in the hanging-wall blocks, whereas narrow veins are 
hosted in the footwall block. La Patria appears to represent a partially preserved epithermal system that 
is more deeply eroded than Guadalupe. 
 
The La Patria mineralization was modeled on cross sections, which were used to code the block model 
directly; no plan interpretations were completed. Gold and silver were modeled and estimated 
independently. Gold was modeled first, as it dominates the La Patria mineralization, and silver was 
then modeled using the gold interpretations as a guide. 
 
Gold-equivalent grades were not modeled or estimated, but were used in the determination of cutoff 
values for silver and gold Resource reporting.

Gold Model 
 
The gold distribution of all drill-hole assays resulted in the definition of grade populations of 0.15 to 1, 
1 to 5, and greater than 5 g Au/t. Vertical sections oriented at 065° azimuth were plotted on 40m 
intervals across the La Patria deposit. Drill-hole traces and the topographic profile were placed on the 
sections, with gold assays colored by the grade population ranges defined above, quartz-vein 
percentages, lithologic codes, and mineralized structure codes plotted along the drill-hole traces. Slices 
through the void and mineralized structure solids were also plotted on the sections. 
 
Mineral domain envelopes were interpreted on the cross sections that roughly correspond to the 
defined grade populations (Figure 17.17). The high-grade mineral domain envelopes, assigned a code 
of 300, follow thin high-grade zones in the central portions of the main mineralized vein structures. 
The mid-grade mineral domain envelopes (code 200) usually encompass the domain 300 polygons and 
define the principal structures more continuously. The low-grade mineral domains (code 100) define 
fairly large areas of quartz stockwork mineralization on both the hanging wall and footwall sides of the 
main structures. 
 
Drill-hole assays were coded by the sectional mineral-domain envelopes. Descriptive statistics and 
population distribution plots of the assays within each of the mineral domains were examined to 
determine high-grade outliers appropriate for assay capping. 
 
The sectional mineral domain envelopes were used to code a 5m x 5m x 5m block model rotated 25° to 
the west. The block sizes are not meant to imply that the data are sufficient to define the La Patria 
mineralization to the level of accuracy of a single block. Rather, the block sizes allow for dilution 
appropriate for potential open-pit mining. 
 
The sectional mineral domains coded the block model by projecting the envelopes perpendicularly half 
the distance to the previous and following sections. The partial percentage of each gold mineral 
domain within each block was stored, as well as any remaining area outside of the mineral domains.

Figure 17.17: La Patria Vertical Section Mineralized Envelopes 
 

 
 
 
Silver Model 
 
Silver was modeled independently of the gold, but in an identical manner. Population distribution plots 
of silver drill-sample assays show grade populations of 10 to 40, 40 to 90, and greater than 90 g Ag/t. 
These populations, in combination with sectional grade continuity and geology, were used as guides in 
the definition of mineral domains 100 (low-grade wall-rock stockwork mineralization), 200 (mid-grade 
vein zones), and 300 (high-grade vein zones of limited extents), respectively. 
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 171 of 245 

The silver mineral domains were interpreted on cross sections, and these envelopes were used to code 
the block model. Each block in the model stores the partial percentages of the three mineral domains 
and unmineralized material. The capped drill-hole assays were composited down-hole at 1.52m 
intervals; only assays coded to a mineral domain were used to create composites for that domain. The 
drill-data density is inadequate to perform variographical analysis 
 
17.3.4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
 
Capping 
 
Composites for gold and silver were capped according to domain.  Tables 17.41 and 17.42 show the 
domain and capping data for gold.  Tables 17.43 and 17.44 show the same type of data for silver.

Composites 
 
The capped drill-hole assays for La Patria were composited at 1.52m intervals to avoid de-compositing 
the RC samples.  Due to the sharp contact typical of the vein mineralization, only assays coded to a 
domain were used to create composites for that domain.  Tables 17.45 and 17.46 below show the 
summary statistics of the gold and silver composites.  The drill-data density is inadequate to perfom 
meaningful variographic analysis.

Table 17.46: Silver Composite Statistics – La Patria 
 

 
 
17.3.5 Block Model Estimation Methodology La Patria 
 
Two inverse-distance-squared passes were used to estimate gold and silver grades into the block model 
(Table 17.47). The estimation passes were performed independently for mineral domains 100, 200, and 
300, so that only composites coded to a particular domain were used to estimate grade into blocks that 
were coded to that domain. The estimated grades were coupled with the partial percentages of the 
mineral domains, voids, and unmodeled waste stored in the blocks, in addition to the percentages of 
the block below surface topography, to enable the calculation of weight-averaged block-diluted gold 
and silver grades, as well as tonnes, for each block.

Table 17.47: Estimation Parameters – La Patria 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The major and semi-major axes of the first pass approximate the average down-dip and strike 
orientations of the principal vein structure. Third-power inverse-distance and shorter search-distance 
interpolations, similar to those used at Guadalupe, resulted in grades that were too close to nearest 
neighbor modeling due to the low data density. The second pass filled a minor amount of blocks that 
were not estimated in the first pass due to the high search distance anisotropy coupled with changes in 
attitude of the mineralized structures. 
 
Silver grades were interpolated into the block model using the same estimation parameters as gold. 
Two inverse-distance-cubed passes were run independently on composites from mineral domains 100, 
200, and 300 to interpolate grades into blocks coded to those domains. The estimated grades were 
coupled with the partial percentage of the mineral domains, voids, and unmodeled waste stored in the 
blocks, in addition to the percentage of the block lying below surface topography, to enable the 
calculation of weighted-average block-diluted silver and gold grades, as well as tonnes, for each block. 
 
17.3.6 Block Model Validation 
 
A nearest-neighbor estimate of the Palmarejo Resources was undertaken as a check on the inverse 
distance-cubed model. The nearest neighbor and inverse distance methods yield similar grades and 
tonnes at a 0.0 gold-equivalent cutoff grade. Grade distribution plots of assays and composites versus 
the nearest neighbor and inverse-distance block grades were also evaluated as a check on the 
estimation. In addition, the inverse-distance block model grades were compared visually to the drill-
hole assay data to assure that reasonable results were obtained.  Figure 17.18 shows a cross section 
through the La Patria block model, and its relationships with the drill data.

17.3.7 Resource Classification 
 
The La Patria classification is similar to the Palmarejo classification scheme.  Silver and gold 
Resources are classified on the basis of the estimation pass that interpolated a grade into the blocks, 
anisotropic distance of the model blocks to the nearest composite, minimum number of composites, 
and minimum number of drill holes within a specified distance from a block. These criteria were first 
applied independently to each of the silver and gold domain grades estimated into each block (the 
"domain classification"; (Table 17.48). As the classification parameters may be different for each 
mineral domain in a block, the domain classifications of the mineral domain with the highest silver 
metal content and highest gold metal content were used to assign the domain silver and gold 
classifications, respectively, of each block. The block classification was then assigned on the basis of 
the metal with the highest gold-equivalent metal content. The final classification reflects changes 
resulting from the treatment of mining voids, as discussed in Section 17.1.4

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 180 of 245 

SECTION 19 - INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The silver and gold mineral deposits in the Palmarejo District are zoned epithermal occurrences hosted 
in quartz veins and quartz-rich breccia within a package of volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks 
known to host similar occurrences in the Sierra Madre Occidental of northern Mexico.  The style of 
mineralization is typical of other epithermal precious metal deposits in the range as well as other parts 
of the world. Three deposits comprise the Mineral Resources and Reserves cited in this report – 
Palmarejo, Guadalupe and La Patria – and several other silver and gold mineralized targets exist on the 
property. 
 
Extensive exploration programs were carried out at the Palmarejo, Guadalupe, and La Patria deposits.  
The objective of these programs was to furnish sufficient information to assess the economic viability 
of these deposits with respect to further development.  The economic assessment process inherently 
covers areas such as data density, data verification and risk analysis to determine ore body 
development potential and viability of the resultant Resource estimate.   
 
The Qualified Persons have visited the project sites and have reviewed all information regarding their 
relevant scopes of work (see Section 2). Data and assumptions used in the estimation of Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves summarized in this report have also been reviewed by the Qualified 
Persons and they believe that the data are an accurate and reasonable representation of the Palmarejo 
silver-gold project.  
 
The Mineral Reserves demonstrate the economic viability of the Palmarejo and Guadalupe deposits as 
combined open pit and underground mine operations delivering ores to the flotation/cyanidation mill to 
recover gold and silver.  The prefeasibility level work on Guadalupe has progressed to a sufficient 
level of detail in ore reserve estimation, mine planning, capital and operating costs estimates to warrant 
inclusion of Guadalupe reserves in the mine plan and cash flow projections.

SECTION 20 - RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
The results of this study demonstrate the economic viability of the Palmarejo deposit as a combined 
open pit and underground mine using a flotation/cyanidation process to recover gold and silver. It is 
recommended that the construction and operation of the Palmarejo Mine continue as planned.  The 
Qualified Persons of this Technical Report recommend the following improvements for future work on 
the Palmarejo Project: 
 

• The Palmarejo deposit Mineral Resource model should be refined in future estimations with all 
new drill data and by additional domain creation within the mineralized envelopes.  This should 
be performed by correlating geologic domains with grade domains using sectional 
interpretation as well as statistical analysis of grade domains.  Varied estimation parameters 
and grade interpolators should be tested to explore what method(s) reconcile the best with 
actual production figures. 
  

• Assay quality control and assurance programs for the definition and grade control sampling are 
being/have been improved to provide an increased quality measure of the metals assays and 
metal grade estimates in the future. 

 
• Future feasibility work on Guadalupe will focus on optimization of mine designs and plans to 

maximize economic benefit of this addition to Palmarejo.   
 

• Mechanical availabilities currently being realized at site for the open pit equipment are lower 
than the assumptions used in this report. Work is underway at site to improve the availabilities; 
however the Qualified Person states that if improvement to the availabilities is not achieved 
then impacts to the mine plan and economics will occur. 
 

• The waste rock dump plan used in this report is based on a dump design that does not currently 
have a geotechnical assessment. The current plan by site personnel is to abandon this location 
and dump material in previously assessed rock dump locations in conjunction with backfilling 
the Chapotillo pit. The Qualified Person agrees with this plan and accepts that no significant 
changes to the production schedule (i.e. increased haul distances) will occur provided that at 
least partial backfilling of the Chaptillo pit is completed.

SECTION 22 - ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS ON 
DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES  
 
22.1 Mining Operations 
 
The Palmarejo operation is mined by both conventional open pit techniques and by longhole 
underground techniques with some minor cut and fill techniques.  The mining operation at Palmarejo is 
currently at full capacity and is expected to continue into 2015. 
 
The Guadalupe operation will operate as a satellite to the Palmarejo Mine and is expected to commence 
ore production in 2012. The Palmarejo Mine will provide processing, tailings and administrative support 
for the Guadalupe Mine.  Ore will be mined primarily by longhole underground techniques and some 
minor cut and fill underground techniques.  Some extraction of the ore material may be by open pit 
which is currently being reviewed.  Ore material mined from Guadalupe is planned to be trucked to the 
Palmarejo mill. 
 
The mine ore production schedule for the Palmarejo and Guadalupe operations is summarized in Table 
22.1 below for the remaining Life of Mine.

22.1.1 Palmarejo Operations 
 
Mine Development Associates (MDA) was commissioned by Coeur d'Alene Mining Ltd. ("Coeur") to 
complete both open pit and underground designs and mine production schedules for the Palmarejo 
operation.  The following section details the designs, production schedules, economic analysis and 
provides a statement of reserves.  Coeur was responsible for providing all operating cost, capital cost 
and design parameters to MDA. The statement of reserves has been completed to meet CIM NI 43-101 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 188 of 245 

standards and is based on these designs, schedules and costs. Also an economic analysis was completed 
by Coeur to show that the material can be extracted economically.  The Qualified Person for this 
Technical Report has reviewed the work done by MDA and believes the methods employed were 
appropriate and that the resultant Mineral Reserves are compliant with CIM NI 43-101 standards. 
 
Ore feed to the mill commenced in 2009 as planned, from a combination of surface and underground 
sources at Palmarejo. Surface mining extracted ore from the upper Rosario and Chapotillo clavos, and 
underground mining in the same period extracted ore principally from the 76 clavo with minor 
contributions from the lower Rosario clavo.  Future open pit mining will extract ore from the upper 
Rosario, Chapotillo, and Tuscon clavos in conjunction  with underground extraction of ores from the 76, 
108, and lower Rosario clavos. 
 
Underground longhole mining methods are used to exploit the majority of the lower Rosario, 76 and 108 
clavos, with a minor amount of cut and fill mining planned in select areas. Underground mining is by 4 
and 8 cubic yard loaders (LHD's) and 30 tonne trucks. Three portals were established to access 
underground ramp systems designed for life of mine access to these ore shoots.  One of these portals is 
located on the  "Run of Mine" (ROM) ore stockpiling area, where all ore mined from underground 
sources is delivered by truck to the mill feed stockpile. Underground longhole mining utilizes Cemented 
Rock Fill (CRF) for backfilling of primary stopes. 
 
Surface mining is by conventional drill and blast, truck and shovel operations.  Two O&K RH120 
hydraulic shovels and one Cat 992 loader for loading and fourteen Cat 777F 100-ton class trucks for 
hauling.  Un-mineralized rock from the open pit mine is placed on the east, west and north edges of the 
open pit boundary, with provision to backfill mined out areas of the pit in future years.  Open pit ore is 
delivered to the ROM pad.  
 
Underground and open pit ore stockpiled on the ROM pad is blended as it is fed to the primary crusher.  
Crushed ore is conveyed to the live ore stockpile where it is reclaimed by an apron feeder and 
introduced to the grinding circuit for processing.   
 
The open pit and underground ore will be fed into the mill to meet mill capacity of 5,000 to 5,700 tonnes 
per day.  The portion required from the open pit is 1,150,000 tonnes in 2011, and then 700,000 tonnes 
per year from 2012 through the end of the mine life. The portion required from the underground is 
550,000 tonnes in 2011 and 650,000 tonnes from 2012 through the end of the mine life.      
 
Palmarejo Underground Operations 
Underground stope design was done by using polygons to define continuous zones of blocks above a 
cutoff grade, refining the detailed stopes or cut and fill shapes around the defined zones, then checking 
the average grade of the blocks to see that the mining volume meets cutoff grade after the inclusion of 
dilution.  Initial economic parameters for stope design are based on the 2010 budget planning.  These 
parameters were used to develop the cutoff grade of 2.90 g Au equivalent per tonne for stope design.  
The cutoff grade was later revised to reflect longer-term cost and efficiency improvements.  This 
lowered the cutoff to 2.64 g Au equivalent per tonne, which was used to filter stopes which were not 
economic due to included dilution.  After filtering stopes for dilution, cut and fill stopes were designed 
to optimize the recovery of underground resources.  Cut and fill mining has a higher mining cost, which 
increases the cutoff for design to 2.90 g Au equivalent per tonne. 
 
  



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 189 of 245 

The economic parameters and resulting cutoffs are provided in Table 22.2 below. 
 

Table 22.2: Underground Economic Parameters and Cutoff Grade 
 

 
 

Stope Design 
Two mining methods were considered for underground design at Palmarejo: 1) longhole stoping; and 2) 
cut and fill mining.  In addition, the longhole stopes may be developed as either conventional or 
transverse longhole stopes.   
 
Longhole stopes were designed using polygons that define a continuous area of blocks over a 2.90 g Au 
equivalent per tonne cutoff grade in a cross-sectional view perpendicular to the vein. The cross-sections 
were spaced at 8-meter centers oriented at an azimuth of 45 degrees for the 76 and 108 Clavos. The 
stope design cross-sections for the Rosario area, also spaced at 8 meters, are oriented at an azimuth of 70 
degrees. This stope design technique was applied throughout the entire mineralized area and for 
simplicity was also applied to the design of conventional longhole mining areas where groups of 5 
sections will make a 40-meter conventional longhole stope. 
 
The polygons were used to build solids. The resulting solids were used to define mining locations for 
scheduling and reserve tabulation.  This methodology incorporates minable solids, which also contain 
dilution from both internal waste and blocks that are below cutoff grade.  After tabulation of tonnes and 
grades for each of the stopes, the average grade was compared with the 2.64 g Au equivalent per tonne 
cutoff grade.  Stopes that were below this cutoff grade were either eliminated or redesigned.  Figure 22.1 
shows the technique applied in designing longhole stopes and sills at Section-104 in the 76 Clavo area.

Design for cut and fill stopes followed a similar process, except rather than designing these in cross-
section, they were designed in plan view.  These were designed based on the remaining resource outside 
of the designed longhole stopes at a 2.90 g Au equivalent per tonne cutoff grade.  As with the longhole 
stopes, solids were made to define the mining locations, and the tonnes and grades inside of the solids 
were tabulated individually.  The cut and fill stopes also contained dilution, and those stopes where the 
average grade did not meet the 2.90 g Au equivalent per tonne cutoff grade were either eliminated or 
redesigned. 
 
Longhole stopes require the development of access or "sills" both above and below the stope.  The upper 
sill is used for drilling, blasting, and backfill. The lower sill is used to muck ore that has been blasted 
from the stope and transport it through underground development to the surface.  The sills are developed 
to be 5 meters high, and the total height of the stope is 20 meters.  The main portion of the stope lies 
between the lower and bottom sill. 
 
Mining of ore at Palmarejo anticipates the use of both conventional (longitudinal) and transverse 
longhole stopes.  For conventional stopes, secondary access comes off of the main development and 
drives through the ore perpendicular to the vein.  Then the sill is developed through in the ore parallel 
with the vein.  This is repeated every 40 meters of strike length along the ore body on each level.  The 
longitudinal stopes are developed where the ore body is at least 5 meters wide, but narrower than 15 
meters.   
 
Where the ore body exceeds 15 meters in width, the transverse longhole stopes are used.  The secondary 
access for a transverse stope is driven from the main access to contact the vein perpendicular to the ore 
body.  The sill is then developed perpendicular across the vein.  This requires secondary development to 
intersect the ore body every 16 meters, which increases the development requirements when compared 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 191 of 245 

to longitudinal stopes, but it allows for mining of the full width in the veins.  Primary stopes are mined 
leaving an 8-meter width between each stope.  After mining, the stopes are backfilled with rock and 
cement, and then after the backfill is cured, secondary stopes are mined between the primary stopes to 
recover the remaining reserve. 
 
Cut and fill allows for better selectivity in mining but is more costly.  Cut and fill mining is done by 
mining tunnels or "drifts" off of the secondary access through the ore, and then slashing or removing ore 
along the walls of the drifts.  After the ore has been slashed from the walls, the mined-out drifts are 
backfilled with waste rock or with cemented waste rock as required by the backfill specifications.  Cut 
and fill stopes are mined in 5-meter slices from the bottom up.  For the first slice, the secondary 
development is generally ramped downward, to the bottom of the cut and fill stope.  After completion of 
the first slice, a portion of the secondary development is backfilled and the secondary access is flattened 
toward the bottom of the second slice.  The second slice is then mined and backfilled, and the process is 
repeated for each slice in the stope.  The total designed height of a cut and fill stope is a maximum of 20 
meters before another stope above it would be started from a different access point.  Cut and fill stopes 
at Palmarejo are typically used for remnant mining near the longhole stopes.  Thus, in most cases, access 
to most cut and fill stopes will be from the secondary access developed for longhole stoping.  In 
addition, few of the cut and fill stopes will be the full 20 meter height.   
 
The parameters and design criteria used for the Palmarejo mine are summarized below in Table 22.3.  
Figure 22.2 shows the areas where the different mining methods will be applied in the Palmarejo 
underground mine.

Cut and fill mining areas are shown in blue, and conventional longhole mining and transverse mining 
areas are shown in green and yellow respectively. 
 
Dilution and Mining Losses 
Stope designs were used to determine tonnage and diluted grades. Any unclassified or inferred material 
within the solids was treated as internal waste. No further ore loss or dilution from over break at the 
walls was taken into account because of the level of detail at which the stopes were designed. 
 
After stope design was complete, sub-economic stopes were either eliminated or redesigned.  The nature 
of eliminating stopes created a loss of potential ore associated with waste on the outer edge of the 
deposit.  MDA considers this ore loss reasonable for this study, and no other ore loss factors were used.  
The Qualified Person agrees that this ore loss methodology is reasonable. 
 
Underground Development 
Updated development designs were created and tied to the existing underground development.  Existing 
headings from the 840 Level through the 1060 Level at the 76 Clavo already provide most of the access 
to production stopes at this location. 
 
Main access development such as main access ramps, haulage drifts, and stope access crosscuts were 
designed with a cross section of 5 x 5 meters.  Ramps were designed with a maximum gradient of 15%, 
and the main level drifts were designed with a 0.5% gradient.  Table 22.4 summarizes the updated 
underground development for Rosario, 76, and 108 Clavos.

Underground Mine Development Schedule 
Mine development continues from the current mining location in the 76 Clavo area at the end of 
December, 2010, towards the upper levels. After completing development in the upper levels, 
development continues in the lower levels to finish mining the 76 Clavo. The 108 Clavo also has 
existing development, and this development will continue as lower levels of 76 Clavo are being mined. 
Development at the Rosario area will start approximately half a year prior to completion of production 
in the 108 Clavo. A total of 13,376 meters of development is planned.  Table 22.5 shows the planned 
underground development for Palmarejo.

Underground Mine-Production Schedule 
Current underground production is coming from the 76 Clavo. Underground operations will continue at 
this location while access to production stopes is developed at 108 Clavo and Rosario. In order to 
achieve the required production rates, production at 108 Clavo and Rosario is to commence in 2013. 
 
Production from underground at Palmarejo is summarized below in Table 22.6 
 

Table 22.6: Palmarejo Underground Production Schedule Summary 
 

 
 
Palmarejo Open Pit Operations 
Open pit reserves have been defined by first running Lerchs Grossman pits using Gemcom Whittle™ 
(Whittle™) software, analyzing the results to determine appropriate ultimate pit limits, modifying

Table 22.7: Open Pit Economic Parameters for Pit Optimization 
 

 
 
Slope Parameters 
The slope parameters are based on geotechnical studies and mining experience.  They are graphically 
shown in Figure 22.3.  The slopes were adjusted for pit optimizations to allow for ramps that will be 
placed in the final pit.  As the Rosario pit is deeper than the others, the ramp requirements to access 
minable material require more flattening than other areas.  Table 22.8 shows the slope parameters that 
were used for Whittle™ pit optimizations.  This table shows the azimuth angles as input into Whittle™, 
which define different sectors where the slope angle is applied equally.  The slope angles between 
sectors specified in Whittle™ (i.e.: 248° to 292°) are transition zones in which the slope angle is 
interpolated within the Whittle™ software.

Pit-Optimization Results 
Pit optimizations were completed using variable gold prices from $300 to $2,000 per ounce of gold in 
$25 per ounce increments.  This was done using a revenue factor, which is simply used by the program 
to multiply against the metal price.  Thus, the resulting silver price used for each pit is the revenue factor 
times the base silver price of $16.25 per ounce.  The corresponding silver prices used ranges from $4.76 
to $31.71 per ounce of silver. 
 
Whittle™ pit optimization results for gold prices from $300 to $2,000 per ounce are shown in Table 
22.9 in $100 per ounce of gold increments.  At the end of Table 22.9 the $1,025 per ounce of gold 
Whittle™ results are shown highlighted in grey.

Pit Designs 
Pit designs were created in multiple phases to allow access to the ore required to maintain feed to the 
mill.  The following sections discuss the design parameters used and show the resulting pit designs. 
 
Bench Height 
Current mining is done on 7.5-meter benches and work well with the shovel sizes being used at 
Palmarejo.  This bench height is three times the block height in the block model, but active practice in 
the pit is to have a geologist watch over the loading process.  At contacts between ore and waste, the 
operation will utilize backhoe-style excavators to clean the contact as best as possible.  Thus, the 
selectivity they are currently achieving is reasonable for both the 2.5-meter block height and the 7.5-
meter bench height.  The remaining pits have been designed using a 7.5-meter bench height. 
 
Pit Slopes 
Slope parameters are based on geotechnical studies and mining experience.  The parameters are divided 
into footwall and hanging-wall and end-wall regions based on the slope's relationship to the veins being 
mined.  Figure 22.3 above, shows the slope parameters used for pit design updates.  
 
The footwall is flatter than the hanging wall, with an overall recommend angle of 43.8°.  This is 
achieved using a 60° bench face angle and a 7.0-meter catch bench for each 15 meters vertically.  The 
hanging-wall and end-wall areas were designed to the recommended 51.3° overall slope using a 75° 
bench-face angle and 8.0-meter catch benches for each 15 meters in vertical height.  During the design 
process, the walls were smoothed by hand to transition the walls from the different regions. 
 
Haulage Roads 
Haul roads were designed based on current practices using an overall width of 25 meters and 10% road 
gradients.  The ramp width was narrowed toward the bottom of each of the pit phases to 15 meters 
where one-way traffic is anticipated.  This occurs when the stripping ratio is sufficiently low that the 
total mined tonnage requirements for the phase are reduced.   
 
MDA checked the haul road widths in relation to the width of Caterpillar 777F trucks.  By US standards 
safety berms should be maintained that are half of the height of the largest truck tire (777F trucks).  This 
would require a minimum berm height of 1.31 meters to be maintained.  Assuming an average 1.44-
meter berm height (10% over the required) and the design width of 25.0 meters, a two-way ramp inside 
the pit with one berm allows for 20.35 meters of running room.  This is 3.14 times the width of a single 
truck. 
 
The maximum gradient was steepened to 12% for short distances to link existing roads in the north and 
west to the mill.  This is consistent with current practices.   
 
The design uses switchbacks to maintain access.  Where switchbacks were designed, an 8% centerline 
gradient was used.  This creates a maximum of about 12% gradients for short stretches on the insides of 
these curves. 
 
Pit Phasing and Ultimate Pit 
Pit designs were created to allow access of people and equipment for mining Rosario, Tucson, and 
Chapatillo.  The starting point was the end of December topography, which shows the current working 
and access roads.  Rosario is to be mined using four different pit phases, while both Tucson and 
Chapatillo will be mined in single pit phases.  The four phases in Rosario have been named the starter 
pit, phase 1A, phase 1, and phase 2.  Figure  22.4 shows the Rosario Starter pit design along with the

Chapatillo pit design to the southeast.  Figure 22.5 through Figure 22.7 show the remaining Rosario pit 
designs, and Tucson phase 1 pit design is shown merged with the Rosario pits as the ultimate pit design 
in Figure 22.8. The ultimate pit design is based on the Whittle™ pit at metal prices of $1,025 per ounce 
gold and $16.25 per ounce silver.

Cutoff Grade 
A 1.27 g AuEq/t cutoff grade was used for reserves based on economic parameters provided by the 
Palmarejo site.  Open pit ore was divided into high-oxide and low-oxide based on a manganese 
percentage estimated by Coeur.  During the first year of operations, the silver recovery is based on the 
pit phase that is being mined and the oxide type, with high oxide ore having a lower recovery.  During 
2011, Palmarejo will upgrade the CIL circuit in the mill, which is anticipated to improve silver 
recoveries to a constant 80%.  The impact of the change in silver recovery is not seen in the cutoff 
grade as the cutoff grade is developed in units of g AuEq/t.  However, the recovery does impact the 
AuEq factor. 
 
Table 22.10 shows the economic parameters used for defining the open pit cutoff grades and AuEq 
factors.  The AuEq factor is used to determine the AuEq grade as a function of the Au and Ag grades 
as follows: 
 
AuEq = Au + Ag / AuEq Factor 
 

Table 22.10: Open Pit Economic Parameters, Cutoff Grades, and AuEq Factors 
 

 
 
Dilution 
While the model block heights are smaller than the mining bench heights, ore control practices at 
Palmarejo allow for reasonable selectivity with relationship to the block size.  While blocks could be 
made a bit larger, MDA believes that the dilution that is incorporated into the model by block size and 
estimation parameters is appropriate for a statement of reserves without additional factors.  Thus, no 
additional dilution factors have been used. The Qualified Person agrees that this dilution methodology 
is reasonable. 
 
Open Pit Mine-Waste Facilities 
MDA received an ultimate waste dump design from Palmarejo staff and has relied on this design for 
definition of the waste dump facilities.  MDA used this design along with the end of December 
topography to create a solid of the ultimate waste dump resulting in a total volume of 32.8 million 
cubic meters.  With a swell factor of 1.3, this provides storage of about 64 million tonnes of waste, 
which is more than the waste defined in association with the reserves.

2008).  This report describes two separate dump designs: one to the north; and one to the east of the 
pit. The current operational dumps are the feasibility (Golder) east dump and a southern dump on the 
immediate south side of the open pit.  The south dump began use in 2010 and Golder and Associates 
have been contracted for a review and design optimization of the south dump and a complete review 
and update of the LOM waste dump plan in early second quarter of 2011. The Qualified Person agrees 
that the existing dump plan needs to be reviewed and refined in conjunction with an updated 
Geotechnical study. 
 
Mine Operating Schedule 
The open pit production schedule, along with other equipment parameters, is used to determine the 
number of operating hours per day a piece of equipment is available to work.  MDA used the following 
assumptions: 

• Ten days per year were assumed to be lost due to holidays and weather delays.  This leaves 355 
days per year for operations (356 days in 2012 due to leap year); 

• It was assumed that there would be two shifts per day operating 12 hours per day and 7 days 
per week; and 

• Standby time includes 1.75 hours per shift for startup, shut down, lunch, breaks, and safety or 
lineout meetings. 

 
With the above parameters, the percentage of operating hours per nominal operating hours per year (24 
hours a day 365 per year) is 83.1%. 
 
Open Pit Mine Production Schedule 
The mine production schedule is based on the production rates for ore and waste required to produce 
mill ore at the rates specified by Coeur.  The ore that is mined will be fed into the mill along with 
underground ore to meet the mill total capacity of 5,000 tonnes per day.  The portion required from the 
open pit is 1,150,000 tonnes in 2011, and then 700,000 tonnes per year from 2012 through the end of 
the mine life. 
 
MDA created the schedule using MineSched software from Gemcom.  The schedule uses the reserves 
from the pit phase design along with various parameters to constrain the schedule using quarterly 
periods.  Proven and Probable reserves were split into Low and High manganese oxide material to 
account for current low silver recoveries in the first year.     
 
The yearly mine production schedule is summarized in Table 22.11.

22.1.2 Guadalupe Operations 
 
The Guadalupe deposit is located approximately 6 kilometers southeast of the Palmarejo mine site and 
processing plant and will be operated as a satellite of Palmarejo.  Guadalupe will be mined by 
underground mining methods; however a small open pit operation is currently being reviewed.    Ore 
processing and administrative support will be done at the Palmarejo site.  A dedicated mining fleet and 
small engineering, geology and safety staff will be located at the Guadalupe site. 
 
Guadalupe currently is designed to be mined at an initial rate of approximately 1,500 tonnes per day 
while ore is mined in conjunction with Palmarejo then at a rate up to 4,100 tonnes per day once 
Palmarejo is depleted.  Based on current reserves Guadalupe will have a mine life of 7 years. 
 
The geology and mineralization styles at Guadalupe are similar to Palmarejo which has allowed 
application of Palmarejo designs to Guadalupe.  The mineralized veins of the Guadalupe deposit strike 
approximately North 45 degrees West and dip approximately 50 to 60 degrees to the northeast.  The 
average vein thickness varies by elevation from less than 2 meters to over 25 meters.  Mineralized 
material is near the surface in the southern portions of the deposit and then trends deeper below the 
surface as the vein strikes to the north. 
 
Since the vein at Guadalupe has a variable thickness two underground mining methods were 
considered.  For areas greater than 15 meters wide Transverse Longhole mining was used, for areas 
between 5 and 15 meters wide Conventional (Longitudinal) Longhole mining methods were used.  
Material less than 3 meters wide was not considered for this study but further evaluations of this 
material should be conducted using cut and fill techniques.

Underground mining will be accomplished with a fleet of Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) scoop trams and 
30-tonne trucks.  Ore will be transferred from the stope to muck bays or to an ore pass. The trucks may 
or may not be used based on the distance from the stope to the ore pass.  The ore pass would transfer 
the material by gravity to a loading pocket on the main haulage level.  The broken ore would then be 
hauled from underground to the surface and placed in a stockpile. Then the ore material will 
transported to the Palmarejo processing plant via the larger open pit haul trucks from Palmarejo 
operation. 
 
Waste material from stope preparation and ramp development will be hauled to a waste storage 
facility.  The waste will then be utilized in making an engineered Cemented Rock Fill (CRF) for 
backfilling empty stopes.  The CRF specifications and make-up plant are the same as the design for the 
Palmarejo mine.   
 
Stope Design 
The mining shapes were designed using a resource block model with blocks that are 3m x 3m x 3m 
and a geologic vein solid. The model contains gold, silver and equivalent gold grades as well as the 
percentage of the block with in the vein and the surrounding stockwork solid.  A consolidated block 
model was created from this percentage model and then manipulated to produce an AuEq model with a 
factor of 73.51 for use in creating shapes about cutoff grade. These shapes were designed by drawing 
polylines in plan view around measured and indicated blocks only, using a cutoff grade of 2.29 g/t 
AuEq, including internal dilution of blocks below cutoff or inferred blocks only when necessary to 
create minable shapes.  The polylines were drawn every 6 meters vertically and used to build the 
orebody shapes for each area of the mine (Norte Clavo, Guadalupe Clavo and Las Animas Clavo).  
Figure 22.9 is an example of the Guadalupe stope design.

Figure 22.9: Guadalupe Stope Design 
 

 
Note: Red blocks are above 2.29 g/t AuEq cutoff, blue blocks are below cutoff.  White blocks show the 
measured and indicated classification. The white line is the polyline drawn around appropriate blocks. 
 
Additional parameters used designing the stope shapes are similar to those used for the Palmarejo 
underground.  For dimensions of longhole and transverse mining methods, refer to the 'Stope Design' 
section for the Palmarejo underground.  No cut and fill mining is included for Guadalupe but will be 
considered for future plans. Table 22.12 summarizes the parameters used for underground stope 
design.

Table 22.12: Guadalupe Mining Methods and Stope Design Parameters 
 

 
 
Figure 22.10 shows the areas in the mine by designed mining method.  Depending on the complexity 
of the solids some areas in the mining shape include internal waste that does not have to be mined.  
Detailed work is required to accurately define the stope shape that can be mined and minimize dilution.

(looking west) 

 

 
 
Dilution and Mining Losses 
Any unclassified or inferred material within the solids was treated as internal waste tonnes, with a 
grade of 0.0 grams per tonne.  An additional 10% dilution at 0.0 grams per tonne was applied to all the 
design stope shapes.  The stope shapes were then given a pass/fail status based on the 2.29 g/t AuEq 
cutoff.   Passing stopes were used in the reserve calculations.  To obtain the final reserve estimate, 
background grades were applied to the dilution tonnes to adjust the reserve totals.  Background grades 
of 0.71 g/t gold and 61.42 g/t silver for dilution material were determined by expanding stope designs 
to approximately 110% of the original volume and averaging the grade of Measured and Indicated 
blocks within the expansion area (Inferred material was given a grade of 0.0 g/t).  For purposes of this 
study no ore-loss was assumed.

Underground Development 
Since the deposit covers approximately 2 kilometers of strike length, three portal locations where 
chosen for underground access.  The North portal is at an elevation of 1,180 meters and will provide 
the primary access to the underground mine.  All ore will be transported from underground to the 
surface through the North portal for final transport to the Palmarejo process plant.   
 
A second access ramp will be developed at a later stage from the south of the main deposit with a 
portal elevation of 1,350 meters.  This ramp is also designed for use to transport most of the backfill 
material to this area.  The third portal and access ramp will serve the southernmost clavo, Las Animas.  
Ramp development from each portal is listed in Table 22.13. 
 

Table 22.13: Summary of Ramp Meters to Main Access Levels 
 

 
 

The underground development at Guadalupe is designed with main levels spaced 60 meters vertically.  
The sub-levels are spaced at 20 meter intervals and are connected via sub-level ramps designed at a 
maximum gradient of 14%. Lateral drifts that run parallel to the ore body are used for access and ore 
haulage are designed at an average of 20 meters away and into the footwall of the ore veins.  These 
access drifts are designed at the proper gradient to allow for water drainage into underground sumps.  
Table 22.14 summaries the Primary development for the ore deposit. 
 

Table 22.14: Guadalupe Underground Primary Development Summary 
 

 
 

Secondary development at Guadalupe includes ore passes and stope accesses, Table 22.15.  Stope 
accesses for conventional longhole are spaced an average of 80 meters apart with the assumption that 
stope mining will advance approximately 40 meters in each direction from each access.  Stope access 
for the transverse longhole stopes are designed at 12 meter intervals.  Figure 22.11 shows the 
underground development plan for Guadalupe.

Underground Development Costs 
Development costs or drifting costs for Guadalupe where determined from actual costs experienced at 
the Palmarejo mine.  Based on this data the average cost for excavating a 4.5 meter by 5 meter drift 
including ground support is $1,500 USD per meter.  This cost was used in the Guadalupe study.   
 
Development Schedule 
Initial development is expected to begin at the North Portal in August of 2011. Establishing an initial 
ventilation circuit is key to allowing that start of production.  Once the ramp reaches the first surface 
ventilation raise, near the Norte ore body, completing that raise will be priority.  With the addition of 
more ventilation, the development rates will increase in the second quarter of 2012.  From this point 
the development of stopes and connections to surface, either raises or ramps, is planned to keep pace 
with the production requirements.  A total of 33,400 meters laterally and 1,881 meters vertically is 
planned.  Table 22.16 shows the planned underground development for Guadalupe. 
 

Table 22.16: Guadalupe Underground Development Schedule 
 

 
 
Production Schedule 
Underground production at Guadalupe is scheduled to begin in mid 2012.  By that time the 
development, which begins at the North Portal, will have reached the first area of the Guadalupe 
Clavo.  The north surface ventilation raise will also be completed by this time to allow the additional 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 212 of 245 

equipment needed to start production.  Development and ore production will continue simultaneously 
through most of the mine life.  The underground mine will begin production at 1,000 tonnes per day in 
2012, increasing to a peak design rate of 4,100 tonnes per day before tapering off in the final year.  
Based on current reserves and production rates and assuming 340 working days a year, Guadalupe will 
have a mine life of 7 years.  Production from Guadalupe is summarized in Table 22.17. 
 

Table 22.17: Guadalupe Underground Production Schedule 
 

 
 
Underground Equipment 
The underground mine development and production will be achieved from use of 4 and 8 cubic yard 
loaders (LHD's) and 30 tonne underground trucks plus all associated equipment, Table 22.18.   The 
table shows equipment purchase or transfer from Palmarejo beginning in year 1 with additional pieces 
purchased throughout the mine life with a large purchase of replacement units in year 5.

Mine Ventilation 
 
Airflow Requirements 
Airflow requirements for the Guadalupe underground mine were based on a ventilation rate of 0.06 
cubic meters per second (m3/s) per kilowatt (kW) for operating diesel equipment. This assumption is 
used for initial planning purposes and can be verified and/or adjusted once the primary ventilation 
infrastructure has been finalized.  Considering the minimum equipment used at each active mining 
location, a minimum airflow of 40 m3/s will be required at every active heading of the mine.  This 
means that all the drifts and internal ramps that will eventually become part of the permanent 
ventilation system, in the full production phase, were designed to carry at least the minimum airflow.  
In order to determine the total airflow required for the mine in full production, Table 22.19 lists the 
ventilation requirements for the diesel equipment fleet. 
 

Table 22.19: Estimated Ventilation Requirements 
 

 
 
During the initial phase of the project, the northern decline will be excavated from the surface to the 
intersection of the first surface intake raise.  During this time, it is assumed that a single area of the 
mine will be active using ventilation duct from the portal. As the mine development progresses and the 
first ventilation circuit is established, the ventilation design can support up to three active areas with 
the ventilation system infrastructure being designed around a maximum through-put of 135 m3/s.  
Once the central surface intake raise and central decline are excavated, a total maximum through-put of 
270 m3/s can be obtained to meet the required 264 m3/s for the diesel equipment fleet.  The third and 
southernmost decline will finally be excavated to allow quicker surface access to the southern and final 
production areas of the mine. 
 
In this study, considering the project location, it was assumed that no air heating or cooling will be 
required.

Air Velocity Limits 
Air velocity should be established according to accepted industry standards.  Insufficient air velocity 
can result in increased exposure to contaminants such as dust and products of combustion (i.e. diesel 
particulate matter), while excessively high velocities can also lead to re-entrainment of dust, high 
system operating cost and worker discomfort. In the main ramps, velocities between a minimum of 1 
m/s and a maximum of 6 m/s are recommended. Air velocity at the ramps and the main entrance 
should be limited to 10 m/s while velocities at the dedicated ventilation raises should be limited to 15 
m/s.  The maximum airflow requirements along with the upper and lower velocity limits will 
determine and or/support the basic infrastructure requirements at the mine including the minimum 
cross-sectional area(s) for the haulage ramps and ventilation raises.  Table 22.20 shows the air 
quantities and velocities for the ventilation system. 
 

Table 22.20: Ventilation Distribution Summary 
 

 
 
Primary Ventilation System 
The Main deposit at the Guadalupe mine has five openings to the surface (see Figure 22.12); the North, 
Middle and South portals and two dedicated ventilation raises. The primary intake and escape raise is 
designed for a maximum 135 m3/s of air flow. This air is designed to supply up to three mining areas 
(development or production) which will be exhausted out of the mine through the main ramp. The 
second dedicated ventilation raise is also utilized as an intake to the mine with approximately 135 m3/s 
maximum airflow capacity. A regulator will be needed on the upper access drift of this second raise in 
order to split the air between upper and lower workings of the mine.  All three portals will serve as 
exhaust for the mine with the North portal having an air door system to prevent short circuiting of the 
air from the first intake escape way raise.

This system configuration of two raises that intake air and haulage ramps exhausting air, provides an 
intake split of air to the primary escape ways that could be readily accessed from any location in the 
mine. This design also provides fresh and clean air directly to the working areas for both development 
and production activities. This configuration is preferred over a system that would use main ramps as 
the primary intake for the mine, where a fire in the ramps could create potentially dangerous toxic 
conditions everywhere below the location of the burning equipment. Even if an escape way were 
installed in the exhaust raises, it is doubtful that personnel downstream of the conflagration would be 
able to safely exit the mine before being overcome by toxic fumes.  
 
Figure 22.12 shows the portal and ventilation raise relative locations. 
 

Figure 22.12: Guadalupe Air Ventilation System Arrangement 
 

 
 
Once an internal ramp is no longer being used for ore production, only primary ventilation, the ore 
passes can create short circuiting problems if they are pulled empty.  Filling the ore passes with waste 
rock or installing bulkheads at each of the accesses after production mining progresses to another area, 
may solve this problem. 
 
Auxiliary Ventilation 
Ventilation of the main haulage ramp will be achieved via a system of auxiliary fans and ducting 
during development until it connects with the primary intake/escape way raise. Once this occurs, the 
blowing ventilation system will be moved ahead to the raise connection, and advanced down the ramp 
as development progresses. This system will facilitate the delivery of fresh intake air to the active 
working face of the ramp until the last connection to the intake raise is made. 
 
The preliminary system was designed to deliver approximately 40 m3/s to the face (quantity enough for 
one active development section). In order to maintain as much overhead clearance as possible in the 
ramp, the duct diameter should be limited to a maximum of one meter. In order to achieve the required 
quantity, two 1m blowing bag systems should be installed in parallel. A single fan located at the mouth 
of each duct would need to develop approximately 4.8 kPa of pressure in order to provide the required 
20 m3/s (half the required total multiplied by two ducts) to the face. The same airflows can be achieved

using three fans installed in series (in each duct) with a maximum pressure of only 2 kPa. In a system 
with multiple fans, the possibility for collapsing flexible fabric ducts exist if fan spacing and sizing are 
not appropriately installed and monitored. This can be avoided by maintaining positive pressure on the 
upstream side of the fans located in-line (by starting fans in sequence), or installing sections of rigid 
duct on the intake side of those fans. 
 
Power Supply 
The Palmarejo Mine site is serviced with a high voltage line capable of all power requirements for the 
mine.  The mine also has back up generators capable of producing enough power to operate the entire 
Palmarejo mine and processing plant.  The same high voltage line runs within 4.8 kilometers of the 
Guadalupe site and it is expected that a spur line will be laid to the Guadalupe site at a cost of 
approximately $200,000 USD per kilometer as per quotations from Comision Federal de Electricidad 
(CFE) in Mexico.  The existing high voltage line does have excess capacity.  Guadalupe will require an 
estimated 2.5 mw of power.  Power lines in Guadalupe are set on-site as of November 2010, contracts 
pending on the official authorization and release from CFE. 
 
Compressed Air 
Compressed air will be used at Guadalupe to operate primarily jackleg drills and small pneumatic 
water pumps.  Compressed air will also be used in the maintenance shop.  The compressed air will be 
supplied via 550 hp compressors and distributed throughout the mine by 6 inch steel pipe. 
 
Cemented Rock Fill (CRF) 
Underground mining at Guadalupe will require backfill of mined out stopes to maximize ore recovery 
and provide safe ground conditions.  Since the ore host rocks, surrounding rocks and mining methods 
are similar to the Palmarejo mine the same type of backfill will be used at Guadalupe.  The backfill is 
an engineered cemented rock fill (CRF).   
 
A cement consumption of 8% by weight was initially estimated for Palmarejo and the same is being 
designed for Guadalupe.  Test work on porphyritic andesite waste rock for the Palmarejo feasibility 
study showed that 8% cement by volume produced desired strengths of 0.5 to 1.0 Mpa uniaxial 
compressive strengths.  The same porphyritic andesite unit makes up a large portion of the waste rock 
at Guadalupe.  Additional waste rock at Guadalupe consists of rhyolite and this will need to have 
bench tests run to verify achieved strengths.  As the Palmarejo CRF plant achieves steady production 
in 2011, data from this will be used to modify the design parameters for the Guadalupe CRF plant if 
necessary. 
 
Access Roads 
The existing access road to property from Los Llanos will require improvement.  New roads on site 
accessing the portal locations and vent shaft locations will need to be constructed along with a new 
road from Guadalupe to Palmarejo to provide the haul road for ore transport (Figure 22.13).

Mine Dewatering 
Assumptions for underground mine dewatering for the Guadalupe project are similar to the Palmarejo 
mine.  The expected ground water flow during development is less than 5 liters per second and it is 
expected to increase to a maximum of 12.5 liters per second during the rainy season.  Underground 
water will be collected in sumps and recycled for use.  Excess water will be clarified and sent to the 
Palmarejo Fresh Water dam downstream of the Guadalupe North portal.  Production lateral drifts will 
be graded with water channels to properly drain and collect the underground water in sumps.   During 
backfill operations an additional inflow of 5 liters per second is expected. 
 
Ore Transport to Palmarejo 
The transport of ore from the Guadalupe mine mouth to the Palmarejo processing will be achieved by a 
loader/truck fleet.  The assumption for the loader and truck is that a single 988 loader and a single 777 
truck will be used for the life of the mine. Operating cost for this fleet is estimated to be $2.56 per 
tonne.    

 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 218 of 245 

22.2 Processing and Recoverability 
 
The Palmarejo processing plant is located on the northern flank of the Palmarejo ore body and ore 
from Guadalupe will be hauled via  a 777 truck to the Palmarejo ROM pad. The Guadalupe ore will be 
blended with the Palmarejo ore for feed into the crusher. Blending occurs by selectively feeding the 
crusher by buckets from the 988 loaders of ore types based on metallurgical characteristics.  A small 
crushed ore stockpile downstream of the primary crusher is reclaimed by apron feeder to feed the SAG 
and ball mills, with cyclone overflow reporting to rougher-scavenger and cleaner flotation cells. 
Flotation concentrate is thickened and cyanide leached, and all float tails report to a CIL circuit.  The 
pregnant eluate from the concentrate leach and stripped CIL carbon is treated by electro-winning to 
produce a powder that is filtered, dried and smelted on site into 150 kg ingots. Dore bullion is shipped 
by contract armored truck to a refinery. 
 
Overall LOM recovery of Palmarejo and Guadalupe ore is expected to be approximately 93.00% of 
contained gold, and approximately 80.00% of contained silver (see Section 16 for metallurgical 
testing).  
 
Tailings thickeners, water storage tanks, and miscellaneous reagent and storage facilities are also 
located in the same process plant area.  A diesel power generation facility is situated on a pad below 
the plant site to provide a reliable back-up power supply independent of a main 115kV power supply 
which feeds from the national grid.  
 
Tailings slurry undergoes thickening for water recovery, cyanide detoxification, and is ultimately 
discharged to the tailings impoundment located in the watershed outlet downstream of the open pit 
waste rock storage area.  
 
 Based on existing metallurgical tests and mineralogy of the Guadalupe ore overall recovery of 
Guadalupe ore is expected to be approximately 93% of contained gold, and approximately 80.00% of 
contained silver.  Testing will continue to verify and optimize metal recoveries at Guadalupe during 
2011. 
 
22.3 Markets and Contracts 
 
The final product shipped from Palmarejo consists of doré ingots weighing approximately 30kg each. 
It is estimated that the bars are composed of approximately 96.5% silver, 1.5% gold and 2.00% 
miscellaneous impurities. Doré bullion is shipped by armored truck to a refinery. The relatively pure 
precious metals are then be sold by the refinery on the open market to a variety of buyers in a number 
of different industries. Coeur has no control over the ultimate end use of its gold and silver. 
 
Contracts 
 
Coeur has numerous business contracts in place to allow day-to-day mining, crushing and processing 
functions to operate smoothly. The terms of these contracts, with regard to charges, etc. are all within 
industry norms. 
 
  



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 219 of 245 

22.4 Environmental Considerations 
 
The results of testing thus far indicate that the majority of the waste rock mined through 2011 will not 
be problematic with respect to acid rock drainage. Thus far in the mining sequence the majority of 
waste rock has been produced by the highly oxidized zones in the open pit.  Therefore, acid base 
accounting results indicate that disposal of the waste rock will result in a non-acid forming dump. 
However, further testing is continuing during project development and operations to fully develop the 
database for assessment of the potential for acid rock generation as mining proceeds into less oxidized 
zones.  The focus of future testing will provide information on the classification of individual rock 
types and specific acid base accounting tests to ultimately construct waste rock dumps that provide a 
physically and chemically stable land form.  This testing is compliant with Coeur environmental 
initiatives and is also required to conform to the management and mitigation requirements of existing 
permitting. 
 
Tests on composite tailings samples are being conducted to assess the potential for the generation of 
acid. Results from testing will include acid generation potential and multi-element composition.  
However, the potential for acid generation is negligible given the overall neutralizing capacity of the 
tailings, resulting from the milling process.  In addition, the tailings are essentially anoxic and 
incapable of oxidizing while inundated with water.  
 
The Mexican permitting document the Expression of Environmental Impact (Spanish: (Manifestación 
de Impacto Ambiental or MIA) was approved on May 23, 2006. The MIA has a term of 13 years and 
can be extended by application to the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (in Spanish: 
Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, or SEMARNAT) this agency is Mexico's 
environment ministry. 
 
According to the 2006 MIA, the Palmarejo Mine permits have been granted full authorization for open 
pit gold and silver mining within the area depicted in the MIA.  However, with the addition of 
underground mining and other construction changes, a permit modification was required. Coeur 
requested the corresponding authorization for the modifications from SEMARNAT and received 
confirmation that no further environmental analysis was required as of March 28, 2008. Therefore all 
changes necessary for mine construction were approved as of 2008.  This included permits for 
exploration and for construction of an open pit gold and silver mine, and associated cyanide leaching, 
refining and cyanide detoxification of the tailings prior to discharge into the tailings impoundment 
(INCO detoxification process). 
 
Construction of the project was largely completed in 2009.  Subsequent to initial construction, 
Palmarejo has received some conditional approvals for continued construction, including the required 
authorizations for the Change in Land Use and the subsequent Environmental Authorization from 
SEMARNAT. An upgraded MIA to increase the authorized area for disturbance by 564 hectares and 
10 years was approved on December 7, 2010. The change in use required a payment of roughly 
$660,000 USD to the Mexican Forestry Fund which was made in 2010 for the first 329 hectares of 
disturbance. Should additional disturbance be required it can be added to the balance up to 564 
hectares without additional permitting requirements.  Payment to the Forestry Fund comenserate with 
the additional disturbance would be required. 
 
The Environmental Authorization for the project requires a restoration program for mining areas that 
will recover the soil for landscape restitution and restore ecosystem conditions that provide for 
previous land use objectives.  This program, at a minimum must include: 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 220 of 245 

 
• Activities schedule – develop a schedule for reclaiming critical areas of the disturbed landscape 

that returns the land to use as soon is as practicable. 
• Slope stabilization:  

 Analysis of landscape's basic components and interrelated factors.  
 Geo-morphological analysis that provides guidelines for final landscaping.  
 Hydrological analysis (infiltration, surface streams and surface storage).  

• Natural vegetation characterization stating current vegetation, structure and physiognomy, as 
well as identification of physiological requirements in order to use this information to select 
promissory species during restoration activities.  

 
Coeur d'Alene Mines' Corporate Environmental Policy underpins the company's commitment to 
protecting the environment. The policy provides a structure for the company to operate responsibly to 
maximize the benefits of a modern extractive industry and will conduct its activities in such a manner 
as to protect the physical environment, its employees and the general public.  This policy can be 
summarized as 'Producing and Protecting'. 
 
Coeur's approach to reclamation in the Palmarejo District will mirror its environmental policy as well 
as seek to accomplish the following goals: 
 

• Comply with Mexican environmental and reclamation laws and regulations; 
• Where such standards do not exist, the company will maintain compliance with the provisions 

of the Coeur Environmental Policy; 
• Respect the local community's interest in providing productive post mining land uses that 

benefit the community; 
• The appropriate post-mining land uses would include livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and 

future mineral development; 
• Return disturbed lands to a safe and productive post mining condition, which includes 

physically and chemically stable land forms that will complement the associated regional 
hydrologic balance. 

 
Coeur will adhere to the above philosophy along with the broad reclamation requirements presented in 
the SEMARNAT Environmental Authorization and NOM-141-SEMARNAT-2003 in developing and 
implementing the following reclamation objectives: 
 
1. Stabilization and protection of surface soil materials from wind and water erosion. 
2. Stabilization of steep slopes to provide durable post-mining land forms.  
3. Re-grading to provide rounded landforms and suitable growth media surfaces for natural invasion 

and re-colonization by native plants. 
4. Physical and chemical stabilization of the site works. 
5. Through working with the local land owners and those that use the associated environment Coeur 

will establish long-term, self-sustaining vegetation communities by reseeding and promoting natural 
invasion (re-colonization) and succession; 

6. Protection of surface and ground water quality including compliance with all water quality standards 
at closure; 

7. Projection of public health by reducing potential hazards typically associated with mines and 
mineral processing faculties, and/or restricting access, and, 

8. Minimization of long-term maintenance requirements, where feasible and where they are adapted to 
the long-term land use arrangements with local users. 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 221 of 245 

 
Coeur conducts an annual review of its potential reclamation responsibilities company wide.  The year 
end 2010 preliminary assessment for the life of mine disturbance for final reclamation at the Palmarejo 
mine is estimated to be $17.3 million and for Guadalupe is estimated to be $2.1 million. 
 
22.5 Taxes 
 
22.5.1 Overview 
 
Companies doing business in Mexico are subject to corporate income tax, value added tax, tax on real 
property, social security contributions on behalf of their employees, and as from 2008, possibly the flat 
tax. Some taxes are levied at the state and municipal levels. There is no excess profits tax. 
 
A tax reform passed in 2007 includes the introduction of a flat tax to replace the asset tax as from 1 
January 2008. From that date, corporations (including permanent establishments of non-Mexican 
entities) and individuals will pay the sum of the income tax computed under the Mexican Income Tax 
Law and the excess of the flat tax over the income tax, if any. With the implementation of the new tax 
regime, the asset tax of 1.25% has been abolished. The asset tax was applicable where a company 
reported no taxable profits or if the assessed asset tax would be higher than the regular income tax. 
 
Under mandatory profit sharing rules, employers are required to distribute and pay 10% of their 
"adjusted" taxable income to their employees. The actual distribution of profits must be paid within 60 
days after the corporate income tax return has been filed (and no later than 31 May of the following 
year). 
 
22.5.2 Taxable Income and Rates 
 
The corporate income tax is assessed at a flat rate of 30%, a 2% increase from the 2009 rate.  However, 
this increased rate is scheduled to come back down to 29% in 2013 and 28% in 2014 and subsequent 
years. 
 
A company is resident in Mexico if its place of effective management is in Mexico. Residents are 
taxed on their worldwide income. Companies not domiciled in Mexico are taxed only on their 
Mexican-sourced income. Income is deemed to derive from Mexican sources when the assets or 
activities are in Mexico or when the sales or contracts are carried out in the country, regardless of 
where title passes. 
 
The gross income of a resident legal entity includes all income received in cash, in kind, in services or 
in credit, including income derived from abroad. This includes all profits from operations and income 
from investments not relating to the regular business of the corporation, and capital gains. 
 
The taxable income on which the corporate income tax rate is applied is the difference between taxable 
revenue and expenses. The revenue and expense recognition is on an accrual basis. 
 
Corporate capital gains or losses arising from the sale of fixed assets are treated as ordinary income or 
losses, taxable at the normal corporate rates. In calculating the taxable gains arising from the sale of 
land, buildings, equity shares and other capital interests, companies may apply an official schedule of 
inflation adjustments to the acquisition cost of the asset. 
  



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 222 of 245 

 
Foreign Investment Incentives and Restrictions 
The Mexican government has curtailed the use of direct tax incentives for investment. The most 
significant tax incentive still available is the accelerated depreciation allowance for investments in 
production facilities, which allows same-year deductions for up to 92% of an investment's value, 
which may vary by industry or type of assets. The accelerated depreciation allowance applies only to 
new assets. Many state governments are pursuing foreign investment through state tax incentives. 
 
Mexico offers no tax holidays for local or foreign investors; the country's accession to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and to its successor, the WTO, has eliminated nearly all import duty 
exemptions. The government has lowered duties dramatically, with trends suggesting further 
reductions, particularly with respect to US and Canadian trade. 
 
Foreign investment has been simplified by amending the relevant regulations, reducing legal and 
administrative bureaucracy, reducing local content requirements, modifying ceilings on foreign equity, 
eliminating most import license requirements and overhauling intellectual property legislation. 
 
Foreign investment is permitted in all areas except those explicitly limited to the Mexican government. 
Foreign investors may hold up to 100% of the capital stock of any Mexican corporation or partnership, 
except in areas limited under the law. Where an investment is in a classified or regulated sector such as 
banking, railways or telecommunications, approval is required from the Foreign Investment 
Commission. 
 
Flat Tax 
As mentioned above, the flat tax became effective on 1 January 2008 and replaced the asset tax. 
 
The flat tax is calculated on a cash-flow basis, with the tax base determined by reducing taxable 
revenue (primarily income derived from the sale of goods, the rendering of independent services and 
the leasing of tangible goods) with specific deductions. Interest, salaries and royalty payments are not 
deductible—with some narrow exceptions (e.g. royalties paid to independent third parties); a credit is 
granted to partially neutralize the impact of the non-deductible salaries. Under the flat tax rules, 
investments and inventory are fully deductible when purchased and paid, rather than being deducted 
under the depreciation or cost of goods sold rules. If deductions exceed revenue ("losses"), a credit is 
granted on such "losses" equal to 17.5% or the applicable rate according to the relevant fiscal year, 
which may be credited against the IETU in the following years. 
 
Taxpayers first compute their income tax liability and their flat tax liability for a fiscal year. Because 
the income tax liability may be credited against the flat tax liability, the flat tax is paid only to the 
extent it exceeds the income tax (i.e. the flat tax acts as a "minimum tax"). In contrast to the abolished 
asset tax, any flat tax paid is not creditable for Mexican income tax purposes in subsequent years. 
 
Deductions 
Business expenses are deductible if they are properly documented and supported. The following 
deductions are permitted: 
 
• Returns received or discounts or rebates granted in the tax year; 
• Cost of goods sold; 
• Expenses net of discounts, rebates or returns; 
• Investments (depreciation on a straight line method, adjusted for inflation); 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 223 of 245 

• Bad debt credits and losses from acts of God; 
• The excess of profit shares over tax-exempt fringe benefits paid to employees; 
• Contributions for the creation or increase of employee pension or retirement funds; and 
• Accrued interest, subject to the thin capitalization rules. 

 
Dividends are neither deductible by the distributing corporation, nor included in the gross income of 
the recipient (although they are included in the income base for calculating profit sharing). Other non-
deductible items include: 
 
• Those that do not meet the formal invoice requirements, income tax or VAT payments; 
• Interest and inflation adjustments made due to extemporaneous tax payments; 
• Provisions for employee liability and indemnity reserves; and 
• Goodwill. 

 
The income tax law aims to recognize the "real" reduction in debt that occurs as a result of inflation 
and the corollary decrease in the return on assets. Under the law, any excess of the inflationary 
reduction in debt over the amount of interest paid out is taxable as an "inflationary profit", but any 
excess of the inflationary increase in the value of assets over the return on assets is tax-deductible. The 
system treats as interest both foreign-exchange losses and net gains from the sale of financial 
instruments, such as petro-bonds. 
 
Losses 
Tax losses are the difference between taxable income and authorized deductions when the amount of 
the deductions exceeds the income obtained in a particular fiscal year. Losses may be carried forward 
for 10 years. Losses not carried forward are forfeited. 
 
Capital Gains Taxation 
Capital gains arising from the sale of fixed assets, shares and real property are considered normal 
income and are subject to the standard corporate tax rate. Mexican law allows the proceeds from the 
sale of real property, shares and other fixed assets to be indexed to inflation. 
 
Dividends 
Dividends paid are non-deductible in computing taxable income, and dividends received are not 
included in taxable income. Mexico does not impose a withholding tax on dividends. Income tax paid 
by a non-resident company that distributes dividends to another non-resident company, which, in turn, 
distributes dividends to a Mexican corporation, may be credited against the Mexican corporation's 
income tax liability provided the following conditions are satisfied: 
 
• The dividend and the income tax are accrued by the Mexican corporation; 
• The Mexican corporation owns at least 10% of the first-tier company;. 
• The first-tier company owns at least 10% of the second-tier company; 
• The minimum combined ownership in the second-tier company is 5%; and 
• The Mexican government has concluded a broad exchange of information agreement with the 

country where the second-tier company is resident. 
  



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 224 of 245 

 
Interest 
Interest payments to foreign banks resident in tax treaty countries are currently subject to a 4.9% 
withholding tax. The rate is 10% if in the absence of a tax treaty. Financial leases are taxed at 21%. 
 
Royalties and Fees 
Payments abroad for technical assistance, know-how, use of models, plans, formulae and similar 
technology transfer are subject to a 25% withholding tax. Royalties paid to a foreign licenser of 
patents, trademarks and trade names—without the rendering of technical assistance—are subject to a 
28% withholding tax, except where Mexico has a tax treaty with the relevant country. 
 
Business enterprises that make fee or rental payments to individuals for property must withhold a 25% 
tax on the interest portion of the lease payments. The tax and a statement including information about 
the payments made must be filed with tax authorities in February of the following year. 
 
Foreign Income and Tax Treaties 
Mexico grants a foreign tax credit for tax paid on income earned from abroad up to certain limits, 
against the amount of Mexican tax due. 
 
Mexico has concluded tax treaties with more than 30 countries. As noted above, Mexico does not tax 
dividend distributions to non-residents as long as they are paid out of net (i.e. after-tax) income. 
Accordingly, the table below does not reflect withholding tax on dividend payments. 
 
Controlled Foreign Companies 
Companies, individuals and resident foreigners must pay tax on all earnings from companies or 
accounts in low-tax jurisdictions. Foreign-source income is deemed to come from a low-tax 
jurisdiction if it is not subject to taxation abroad or if it is subject to an income tax that is less than 75% 
of the income tax computed under Mexican tax legislation. 
 
Passive income (i.e. dividends, interest, royalties and capital gains) derived directly or indirectly by a 
Mexican resident through a branch, entity or any other legal entity located in a preferential tax regime 
will be subject to taxation in Mexico in the year in which the income is derived. Specific rules apply 
that permit the non-taxation of active income in certain cases. Taxpayers earning income from a 
preferential tax regime must file an annual information return in February. 
 
Consolidated Returns 
Mexican law allows corporate groups to be taxed on a consolidated basis. The filing of a consolidated 
return has significant advantages, most notably the fact that the losses of some group companies may 
be offset against the profits of others. Also, dividends paid among companies of the group are not 
subject to any tax, notwithstanding that dividends do not originate from the CUFIN (net-of-tax profit) 
account. For tax purposes, a consolidated group consists of the Mexican holding company and the 
subsidiaries in which it has effective direct or indirect ownership interests in excess of 50% of the 
voting shares. Consolidation is on a proportional basis, based on the percentage owned directly or 
indirectly by the controlling company. Only companies resident in Mexico may be treated as holding 
companies. 
 
Consolidated tax returns must be filed in the year following authorization from the SAT. Once 
consolidation for tax purposes has been elected, it must be continued for at least five years. 
 



 

Coeur d'Alene Mines, Palmarejo Technical Report, January 1, 2011  Page 225 of 245 

Taxpayers must disclose in the tax report, issued by an independent public accountant, the amount of 
income tax that has been deferred as a result of electing to file a consolidated tax return. Failure to 
disclose this information will result in deconsolidation of the group. 
 
Turnover and Other Indirect Taxes and Duties 
A value added tax (IVA) applies to both goods and services at a standard rate of 16%. Interest on non-
business loans and credit card debt is also subject to IVA. The following are exempt: land and 
residential buildings, books and newspapers, share transfers, used chattels, tickets and other evidence 
permitting participation in lotteries, raffles, games of chance and competitions of every nature, national 
currency, foreign currency and gold and silver pieces, and alienation of goods among non-residents or 
by a non-resident to a Mexican entity registered in an authorized program to promote exportation of 
goods. Exports are exempt, as are supplies for maquiladoras (IMMEX) if specific conditions are 
satisfied. Imports are not subject to IVA when used in the manufacture of exports. Services utilized 
abroad are subject to the 0% rate on exports of services if the services are contracted and paid by a 
non-resident with a PE in Mexico. 
 
Companies may credit IVA payments against income or other tax payments; if the excess cannot be 
credited in its entirety, the taxpayer may apply for a refund. 
 
Companies must settle IVA on a monthly basis, making the IVA payments for the preceding month. 
IVA payments for installment sales may be made when principal and interest payments are actually 
received, rather than when the sale is invoiced, provided half the purchase prices is paid after six 
months (35% of the price for final consumer sales). For imports, IVA is based on customs value plus 
tariffs. All companies should demand that IVA payable on their purchases be separated from 
deductible expenses. 
 
22.6 Royalties 
 
On January 21, 2009, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Coeur Mexicana SA de CV, entered 
into a gold production royalty transaction with Franco-Nevada Corporation under which Franco-
Nevada purchased a royalty covering 50% of the life of mine gold to be produced from its Palmarejo 
silver and gold mine in Mexico.  Coeur Mexicana received total consideration of $78.0 million 
consisting of $75.0 million in cash plus a warrant to acquire Franco-Nevada Common Shares (the 
"Franco-Nevada warrant"), which was valued at $3.0 million at closing of the Franco-Nevada 
transaction.  On September 19, 2010, the warrant was exercised and the related shares were sold for 
$10.0 million. 
 
The royalty agreement provides for a minimum obligation to be paid in monthly payments on a total of 
400,000 ounces of gold, or 4,167 ounces per month over an initial eight year period.  Each monthly 
payment is an amount equal to the greater of the minimum of 4,167 ounces of gold or 50% of actual 
gold production per month multiplied by the excess of the monthly average market price of gold above 
$400 per ounce (which $400 floor is subject to a 1% annual inflation compounding adjustment 
beginning on January 21, 2013).  After payments have been made on a total of 400,000 ounces of gold, 
the royalty obligation is payable in the amount of 50% of actual gold production per month multiplied 
by the excess of the monthly average market price of gold above $400 per ounce, adjusted as described 
above.  Payments under the royalty agreement are to be made in cash or gold bullion.  Payments made 
during the minimum obligation period will result in a reduction to the remaining minimum obligation.  
Payments made beyond the minimum obligation period will be recognized as other cash operating 
expenses and result in an increase to Coeur Mexicana's reported cash cost per ounce of silver.

22.7 Capital and Operating Expenses 
 
22.7.1 Capital Cost Estimate Palmarejo and Guadalupe 
 
The Capital cost estimate for the Palmarejo Mine is based on development and construction of a 
combined open pit and underground mine operation with a supporting plant & infrastructure that will 
maximize extraction of the ore resource during operations. 
Capital expenditures for the LOM for Palmarejo and Guadalupe are estimated at an additional $167.2 
million from January 1, 2011 through the end of the mine life.  
 
Major expenditures in 2011 at Palmarejo include $23.5 million for a CIL circuit expansion, $4.5 
million for a water treatment facility, $11.0 million for the Final Tailings Dam (FTD) construction.  
Expenditures for Guadalupe in 2011 are budgeted at $6.0 million for construction of the haul road 
from Palmarejo to Guadalupe and for initiation of the North Portal development drift.  Beyond 2011 
the major capital items include $19 million distributed in 2012 and 2013 to complete the Final Tailings 
dam at Palmarejo and $35 million in 2012 for Guadalupe development and equipment.  
 
Other capital expenditure includes underground development costs and general sustaining capital, etc. 
and are detailed in Table 22.16. The underground development comprises underground ramp access, 
development footwall drives, cross-cuts, vertical raises for ventilation and passes for transfer of ore 
and waste.  
 
22.7.3 Operating Cost Estimate Palmarejo 
 
Operating costs are summarized in Table 22.21. These operating costs are based on current costs as

22.7.4 Operating Cost Estimate Guadalupe 
 
Operating costs are summarized in Table 22.22.   Underground mining cost includes sustaining 
development and ore mining costs.  Processing cost includes ore processing and tailings disposal.  
General and administrative (G&A) includes all other costs incurred to sustain the operation.  All costs 
are based on actual costs experienced at Palmarejo during 2010 except for the G&A cost and the 
transport cost. The G&A cost is estimated as the additional cost expected to run Guadalupe as a 
satellite project. Most of the administration cost is applied to Palmarejo, until which time the 
Palmarejo ore is mined out.

2 The royalty agreement provides for a minimum obligation to be paid in monthly payments on a total of 400,000 ounces of 
gold over an initial eight year period.   After payments have been made on a total of 400,000 ounces of gold, the royalty 
obligation is payable in the amount of 50% of actual gold production per month multiplied by the excess of the monthly 
average market price of gold above $400 per ounce, adjusted for inflation.  Payments made during the minimum obligation 
period will result in a reduction to the remaining minimum obligation.  Payments made beyond the minimum obligation 
period will be recognized as other cash operating expenses and result in an increase to Coeur Mexicana's reported cash cost 
per ounce of silver.

As of January 1, 2011, the Mineral Reserves are estimated to generate a pre-tax net cash flow of 
$323.3 million based on future capital expenditure of $195.9 million as illustrated in the table above.  
The stated Mineral Reserves yield an estimated mine life of approximately eight years.   
 
The following tables illustrate the impact of changes to the financial performance of the project to 
changes in a number of operating parameters.  Note that there are no cumulative effects of multiple 
parameter modifications included in the following tables; only one parameter is altered in each case at 
the gold and silver prices listed for each case. The net cash flow is most sensitive to grade, then 
operating cost then capital costs.

22.10 Mine Life 
 
The mine life based on the stated Mineral Reserves is estimated to be approximately eight years. 
 
Exploration potential at Palmarejo is excellent and it is believed that much of the mineral resources 
classified as "inferred" could be upgraded to indicated and measured with planned additional drilling 
from new access provided by the underground and open pit development. Future drilling programs at 
Palmarejo will also target discovery of additional new mineral resources occurring on the fringes of the 
deposit and at depth. 
 
In the underground portion of the mine, only incremental capital development is required to provide 
access to these potential stopes, and the same mining methods and equipment can be used.  As such, if 
they were brought to a higher classification status by diamond drilling, they could readily be added 
into the existing reserve. 
 
The open pit area also has recently exposed mineralized targets not identified by previous exploration. 
Drilling commenced in 2008 and is ongoing. The program was designed to further delineate new ore 
bearing structures within the minable confines of the open pit and to upgrade some or all of existing 
inferred resources to measured and indicated.   
 
Potential exists at the Guadalupe deposit for expansion of Mineral Resource along strike to the 
northwest and at depth.  There is also upside potential identified in the La Patria prospect area where 
work in 2009 and 2010 has identified potential for a low grade disseminated gold system.  Exploration 
and infill drilling is scheduled for these areas in 2011. 
 
On-going exploration activities have shown that the large claim holdings in the Palmarejo area contain 
numerous structures capable of hosting similar mineral occurrences to those at the Palmarejo Mine and 
many of the structures remain undrilled or only have a relatively small amount of exploration drilling 
conducted.

"Indicated Mineral Resource" - the part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on

"Measured Mineral Resource" - the part of a Mineral Resources for which quantity, grade 
or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of 
the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and 
grade continuity. 
 

"Mineral Reserve" - the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral 
Resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study. This study must include 
adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors 
that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A Mineral 
Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material 
is mined. Synonymous with Ore Reserve per SEC Guide 7 and JORC Guidelines. 
 

"Mineral Resource" - a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic 
material or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal and 
industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade,

geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. 
 

"mm" - millimeter.  
 

"NI43-101" - National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, 
promulgated by the Canadian Securities Administrators effective as of December 30, 2005. 
 

"open pit" - a surface working open to daylight, such as a quarry. 
 
"ore" - naturally occurring material from which a valuable mineral(s) can be economically 

extracted. 
 

"ore shoot" - a pipe-like, ribbon-like or chimney-like mass of ore within a deposit (usually a 
vein), representing the more valuable part of a deposit. Syn; "clavo". 
 

"oz" - ounce (troy).  1 troy ounce = 1.097 avoirdupois ounce. 
 
"oz/ton" - troy ounces per short ton. 

 
"Pb" - lead, a soft bluish-white, dense metallic element.  

 
"porphyry" - an igneous rock of any composition that contains conspicuous, large mineral 

grains (phenocrysts) in a fine-grained matrix. 
 

"preliminary feasibility study" – a comprehensive study of the viability of a mineral project 
that has advanced to a stage where the mining method, in the case of underground mining, or the 
pit configuration, in the case of an open pit, has been established and an effective method of 
mineral processing has been determined, and includes a financial analysis based on reasonable 
assumptions of technical, engineering, legal, operating, economic, social, and environmental 
factors and the evaluation of other relevant factors which are sufficient for a qualified person, 
acting reasonably, to determine if all or part of the mineral resource may be classified as a 
mineral reserve. 

  
 
"Probable Mineral Reserves" - the economically mineable part of an Indicated and, in some 

circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility 
study. This study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 
economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 
extraction is justified. 
 

"Proven Mineral Reserves" - the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral 
Resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study. This study must include 
adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors 
that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.

"pyrite" - a mineral with the chemical formula FeS2. 
 

"pyroclastic" - rock formed by the mechanical combination of volcanic fragments. 
 

"Qualified Person" - for the purposes of NI 43-101, an individual who is an engineer or 
geoscientist with at least five years of experience in mineral exploration, mine development or 
operation or mineral project assessment, or any combination of these; and has experience 
relevant to the subject matter of the mineral project; and who is a member in good standing of a 
recognized self-regulatory organization of engineers or geoscientists. 
 

"reverse circulation" - a rotary, percussion drilling method in which rock specimens are 
broken into small pieces, cuttings, and brought to surface by high pressure air passing in the 
annulus between an inner and outer drill casing. Abbrev "arc". 
 

"run-of-mine ore" - mined ore which has not been subjected to any pre-treatment, such as 
washing, sorting or crushing prior to metallurgical processing. 
 

"shrinkage stoping" - a method of stoping which utilizes part of the broken ore as a working 
platform and as support for the walls. 
 

"silicified" - a rock altered by a silica-bearing hydrothermal solution. 
 

"sphalerite" - the main zinc ore, with the chemical formula (Zn,Fe)S, often found in veins 
with galena. 
 

"split" - a vein or seam that is separated from the main vein or seam.  Syn; "loop". 
 
"Sn" - tin, a soft metal extracted from cassiterite. 

 
"stope" - an excavation in an underground mine from which ore is being or has been 

extracted. 
 

"strike" - the trend or direction of the intersection of a dipping a layer of rock, fault, vein or 
other geologic feature with a horizontal surface. 
 

"tailings" - material rejected after recoverable valuable minerals have been extracted from 
the ore or concentrate. 
 

"ton" - 2,000 pounds. Syn; short ton. 
 
"tonne"- 1,000 kilograms. 

 
"tuff"- a general term for all consolidated pyroclastic rocks derived from solid volcanic 

material which has been blown into the atmosphere by explosive activity.  Adj: tuffaceous.
