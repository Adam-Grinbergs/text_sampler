P&E Mining Consultants Inc. i  
Eagle One Report No. 149 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The following report was prepared to provide a Technical Report compliant with the provisions 
of National Instrument 43-101- Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, ("NI 43-101") and 
an independent Resource Estimate of the nickel, copper, platinum, palladium, gold (PGE) and 
silver mineralization on the Eagle One Deposit, Double Eagle Property, Sachigo Greenstone 
Belt, James Bay Lowlands, Ontario. 
 
This report was prepared by P&E Mining Consultants Inc., ("P&E") at the request of Mr. 
Richard Nemis, President and CEO of Noront Resources Ltd., ("Noront"). Noront is a Toronto 
based company trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) under the symbol "NOT". 
 
The Double Eagle Property consists of 178 claims for a total of 41,696 hectares. The Eagle One 
Deposit is situated on claim number 3012264. This claim, as well as claim number 3012265, is 
held 100% by Noront, subject to a 1% NSR that can be bought back at any time for $500,000. 
The remaining 176 claims were staked, and Noront has 100% rights to the staked claims which 
can be leased from the Province of Ontario if a positive decision to mine the deposit is taken.  
 
The Double Eagle Property is situated to the north and west of the Attawapiskat River some 250 
kilometres west of James Bay. The Property lies in the James Bay Lowlands straddling its 
western limit, and approximately 250 kilometres west of the community of Attawapiskat on 
James Bay.  Thunder Bay lies 520 kilometres to the southwest of the project area, and Timmins 
is located approximately 570 kilometres south-southeast. 
 
An exploration camp was initially established on the north-west corner of McFaulds Lake, which 
is accessible to float and ski-equipped aircraft and is situated approximately twelve kilometres 
north, north-east of the Eagle One Deposit. Since the discovery of the deposit, Noront has 
constructed a second camp known as the Esker Camp, which is located 250 metres north-east of 
Eagle One. Currently exploration is supported from Nakina, 300 kilometres to the south, where 
there is a paved, 3,880-foot airstrip, all weather road access and railroad access.   
 
The James Bay Lowlands experience long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  The mean 
daily minimum temperature in January is approximately -27°C.  Spring breakup occurs in April.  
Mean annual precipitation is approximately 660 millimetres, and mean annual snowfall is 
approximately 2400 millimetres (snow depth). 
 
The Geological Survey of Canada and the Ontario Department of Mines carried out regional 
studies circa 1906 and again between 1940 and 1965. The early work focused on the petroleum 
possibilities of the sedimentary basins in Hudson and James Bays and on industrial and fuel 
minerals in the Moose River Basin.  
 
In the early 1990's, Spider Resources Inc., ("Spider") and KWG Resources Inc., ("KWG") 
commenced an ambitious, airborne magnetic-based, diamond exploration program in the 
northern James Bay Lowlands as joint venture partners, discovering the Good Friday and 
MacFayden kimberlites in the Attawapiskat cluster and an additional five kimberlites to the east.   
 
In 2002 De Beers Canada Inc., ("De Beers") in joint venture with Spider and KWG discovered 
the McFaulds No. 1 volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) body while drilling some isolated 
magnetic anomalies in search of kimberlites. In November 2002, Spider recorded the first group 
of claims surrounding the initial VMS discovery and subsequent work by Spider and KWG 
discovered the rest of the McFaulds occurrences, including McFaulds No. 3 VMS body. Many 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. ii  
Eagle One Report No. 149 

other junior mining companies started staking in late 2002 (December) and then again during the 
first half of 2003.  
 
The Double Eagle claims were staked by Noront in 2003, following the VMS discovery, and a 
Fugro Geotem survey was flown later that year.  
  
The Condor Property, which was contiguous to the Double Eagle Property consisted of two 
claims which were sold to Noront in May 2007. Noront holds a 100% interest on these claims, 
subject to a 1% NSR Royalty, and it was in early September 2007 that Noront announced the 
discovery of significant Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization on the Condor claims. The deposit was 
named Eagle One, and the ultramafic sill occupying an unconformity between the basement 
granodiorite on the inside of an arc, and the volcanic belt on the outside of the arc was dubbed 
the "Ring of Fire". 
 
The James Bay Lowlands are defined by flat-lying, Paleozoic platform rocks which are covered 
by a thin but persistent layer of glacial and periglacial sediments.  The Paleozoic carbonates are 
up to 75 metres thick in the McFaulds Lake area and feather out toward the west. 
 
The Precambrian geology of the area is inferred from airborne geophysical data supplemented by 
sparse gravity and diamond drill data.  Magnetic patterns suggest a basement complex 
comprising volcanic and sedimentary belts between large expanses of granite and gneisses.  
Recent work by Stott suggests that the Oxford-Stull Domain, in which the Double Eagle 
Property lies, comprises an older core (2870 to 2830 Ma) perhaps built on a remnant mid-
oceanic ridge.  Stott et al have reported that greenstone belts date between 2737 and 2695 Ma 
which are comparable with data from other parts of the Superior Province.   
 
The "Ring of Fire" is clearly an emerging metal district. The McFaulds No. 1 and No. 3 VMS 
occurrences, Noront's Eagle One Magmatic Sulphide Deposit, Noront's Blackbird One Chromite 
Deposit and Blackbird Two Chromite Occurrence, as well as other Cu-Pb-Zn hits (results 
pending) by the Metalex Ventures Ltd./WSR Gold Inc. joint venture in the area leave no doubt 
about this.   
 
The Eagle One Deposit is a magmatic sulphide deposit. A mantle derived, highly magnetic 
ultramafic intrusion ("the Ring of Fire Intrusion" or "RFI") has been emplaced along the margin 
of a regional scale granodiorite pluton which had been intruded into and caused a doming of the 
host Sachigo greenstone belt rocks. The RFI is thus situated between the granodiorite on one 
hand (footwall) and the surrounding Sachigo greenstone belt rocks (hangingwall) on the other. 
The RFI is magnetically distinct allowing it to be traced more or less uninterrupted, for tens of 
kilometres along the granodiorite margin. It appears that a series of conduits cutting across the 
granodiorite have acted as feeders to the main RFI. 
 
The Eagle One Deposit is interpreted as occurring well within the conduit feeder, at some 
distance from the main RFI. In addition to the Eagle One Deposit, Noront has also discovered, 
two kilometres south-west, the Blackbird One Chromite Deposit, the Eagle Two shear-hosted 
Ni-Cu-PGE Deposit (collectively also known as AT2), and most recently the Blackbird Two 
Chromite Occurrence. At the time of writing of this report, two drill holes had been completed 
on Anomaly AT12, which returned encouraging widths of visual copper-nickel-iron sulphide 
mineralization up to 29.2 metres in peridotite host rock. Assays are pending.  
 
Massive sulphides at the Eagle One Deposit comprise pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite, 
with subsidiary amounts of equant millimetric magnetite.  In most examples the rocks are very 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. iii  
Eagle One Report No. 149 

coarse-grained, with grain sizes up to 1 centimetre and well-formed pentlandite "eyes".  There 
are many instances in the deposit of medium to very fine-grained massive sulphide veins that are 
rich in inclusions of silicates and which may display pronounced gneissic foliation that wraps 
around the clasts, (durchbewegung texture). In some cases the massive sulphide texture grades 
into peridotite through a marginal zone in which silicate minerals are completely bathed in 
sulphide and are not in mutual grain contact.  Much of the net-textured sulphide mineralization at 
Eagle One shows a distinct metamorphic fabric.  Sub-parallel wavy veinlets of sulphide minerals 
are present throughout the rock, apparently the result of transfer of sulphide on the grain-scale 
from the net texture into extensional features.  In this texture the silicate minerals form a closely-
packed orthocumulate-textured framework, the interstices of which are fully occupied by 
sulphide minerals. The large amounts of sulphide and of ultramafic cumulate make it absolutely 
clear that the Eagle One deposit formed in a magmatic conduit.  No magma could have carried 
the observed amount of sulphide in solution; therefore the sulphides have been left behind by a 
through-going volume of magma much greater than what presently remains in the intrusion.  
 
Since Noront acquired the Double Eagle Property in 2003, and prior to the 2007 diamond drill 
program undertaken by Noront, there have been a total of six airborne and ground geophysical 
surveys undertaken as well as an 11 hole diamond drill program completed by Probe Mines Ltd., 
("Probe") in 2006.  
 
Noront has been drilling continuously since acquiring the Condor claims in May 2007, on which 
the Eagle One Deposit is situated. Thirty-five holes were drilled for a total of 5,387 metres on the 
Eagle One Deposit, (none of the 11 holes drilled by Probe intersected the Eagle One Deposit). 
The holes were named NOT-07-01 through NOT-08-35. Seven (7) drill cross sections were 
developed for the resource model on a local grid looking north, on  a 25 metre spacing named 
from 3525-N to 3675-N.  A Gemcom database was provided by Noront containing 29 diamond 
drill holes of which 23 were utilized in the resource calculation. The remaining data were not in 
the area that was modeled for this resource estimate. 
 
From drill hole NOT-07-05 and for the remainder of the drilling, a quality control (QC) program 
was set up by P&E and instituted by Noront. Holes NOT-07-01 and NOT-07-02 were not 
covered by QC and holes NOT-07-03 and 04 did not intersect mineralization. 
 
The QC program involved the insertion of two certified reference materials that monitored the 
lab accuracy on the Cu, Ni and PGE analyses, blank material comprised of sterile granodiorite 
drill core and field (1/4 core), coarse reject and pulp duplicates.  
 
The QC monitoring was done on a real-time basis, and as the lab certificates were received, the 
QC data were graphed to ensure results were accurate as defined by a strict protocol. All of the 
data in the Master database met the QC requirements. 
 
The resource estimate was derived from applying an NSR cut-off grade to the block model and 
reporting the resulting tonnes and grade for potentially mineable areas.

(1) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  Estimated 
mining costs, metallurgical recoveries and project infrastructure costs in this report may materially affect 
this resource estimate due to those components not being studied in sufficient detail to accurately predict 
their realized values.  The estimate of mineral resources may also be materially affected by environmental, 
permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues.  There is no guarantee 
that Noront will be successful in obtaining any or all of the requisite consents, permits or approvals, 
regulatory or otherwise for the project or that the project will be placed into production. 

 
(2) The quantity and grade of reported Inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there 

has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred resources as an Indicated or Measured mineral 
resource and further exploration drilling is required to determine whether they can be upgraded to an 
Indicated or Measured mineral resource category. 

 
A total budget of $12,300,000 is recommended to follow up at Eagle One, to continue defining 
and delineating the other deposits on the property such as Eagle Two, Blackbird One and Two, 
as well as other geophysical anomalies. The authors feel that the large budget is warranted, given 
that the project is now entering a predevelopment stage and will require considerable 
infrastructure upgrades and advanced studies in order to proceed to the next level. In addition, 
geophysical indications are that the Ring of Fire Intrusion continues across the entire Double 
Eagle Property, and that Noront has continued success at intersecting mineralization in areas 
several kilometres from the Eagle One Deposit.  
 
The recommended budget breakdown is presented in the following table:

3.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND TENURE 
 
The Double Eagle Property, within which sits the Eagle One Deposit, is comprised of 178 claims 
for a total of 41,696 hectares. The approximate centre of the property is located at 5,845,000N 
and 545,000E in the UTM NAD83 coordinate system. Two of the claims, 3012264 and 3012265 
were purchased by Noront, subject to a 1% Net Smelter Returns (NSR) royalty that can be 
bought back for $500,000 cash or stock at any time. The Eagle One Deposit lies on claim 
3012264.  
 
The remainder of the claims were acquired by Noront by ground staking pursuant to 
requirements of the Mining Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter M.14, attached regulations and 
amendments thereto. In the James Bay Lowlands, claims corners are generally established with 
the aid of handheld GPS receivers, whose accuracies are in the order of +/- 10 metres, depending 
on which type of unit is used. Claim stakers mark out claim block boundaries by navigating, 
blazing and flagging their course with the aid of a compass or GPS receiver and placing line 
posts along this course every 400 metres. Corner claim posts are established at each corner of the 
claim, and positional information is provided on the corner posts with the aid of a GPS receiver. 
 
Noront has 100% rights to the staked claims which can be leased from the Province of Ontario if 
a positive decision to mine the deposit is taken.  
 
A map showing the claims is presented in Figure 3.1 and a list of the claims is presented in Table 
3-1.

4.0 LOCATION, ACCESS, CLIMATE, PHYSIOGRAPHY & 
INFRASTRUCTURE 

 
4.1 LOCATION AND ACCESS 
 
The Double Eagle Property is situated to the north and west of the Attawapiskat River some 250 
kilometres west of James Bay. The Property lies in the James Bay Lowlands straddling its 
western limit, and ~250 kilometres west of the community of Attawapiskat on James Bay.  An 
exploration camp was initially established on the northwest corner of McFaulds Lake which is 
accessible to float and ski-equipped aircraft and is situated approximately twelve kilometres 
north, north-east of the Eagle One Deposit. Since the discovery of the deposit, Noront has 
constructed a second camp known as the Esker Camp, which is located 250 metres north-east of  
the Eagle One Deposit. Currently exploration is supported from Nakina, 300 kilometres to the 
south, where there is a paved, 3,880-foot airstrip, all weather road access and railroad access.  
  
Smaller ponds, closer to work areas, form potential winter ice strips.  Snow mobiles afford good 
winter access within tens of kilometres of temporary airstrips.  Advanced programs require 
helicopter support for both moving equipment and ferrying personnel and supplies. 
 
The First Nations communities of Webequie and Ogoki / Marten Falls lie 110 kilometres west 
and 130 kilometres SSE of McFaulds Lake respectively.  Both are served by scheduled air 
services, primarily from Thunder Bay, although both Thunder Bay and Timmins serve as support 
centers for the James Bay communities and the projects. Thunder Bay lies 520 kilometres to the 
southwest of the project area, and Timmins is located ~570 kilometres south-southeast.  
 
4.2 CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The James Bay Lowlands experience long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Freeze-up of 
the major rivers occurs in late October or early November. The mean daily minimum 
temperature in January is approximately -27°C.  Spring breakup occurs in April.  Mean annual 
precipitation is approximately 660 millimetres, and mean annual snowfall is approximately 2400 
millimetres (snow depth). 
 
River levels reach their maximum during the spring runoff in late April and early May. Water 
levels typically drop through the summer and then increase slightly during the fall prior to freeze 
up. Water levels fluctuate in response to even modest rainfall and short dry spells. 

The James Bay Lowlands are an almost perfectly planar topographic feature that slope slightly 
eastwards (0.7 m / km).  Major and secondary rivers incise slight trenches into the soft marine 
clays that cover much of the Lowlands.  Elevations in the project area are in the order of 140 
metres ASL.   

Drainage is poor due to the lack of relief, and consequently inland areas remain water-logged 
throughout the year.  Vegetation comprises grasses and sedges, low shrubs and sparse, stunted 
trees, predominantly tamarack (larch) and black spruce.  Woody species increase in size and 
proportion as drainages cut into overburden, forming better-drained banks.  Trees reach full size 
along stable banks of the major rivers.  Extensive string bogs are developed between drainages. 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 8 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

The perennially water logged surface makes effective surface travel impossible except during the 
winter months (December to March), however activities continue year round with helicopter 
support. 

4.3 INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The only infrastructure in the project area is the Esker and McFaulds Lake Camps. The 
McFaulds Lake Camp is located on the shore of McFaulds Lake which is shared by several 
companies doing work in the area. The Esker Camp is located 250 metres north-east of the Eagle 
One Deposit and is used exclusively by Noront. The closest town with infrastructure is Nakina, 
300 kilometres to the south. 
 
Noront is required to remove camps, fuel caches and any remaining waste material upon 
completing exploration.  Drilling is conducted in compliance with environmental standards that 
include the removal of all equipment and waste upon completion of each set-up.  Currently the 
operator backhauls empty containers, garbage and waste on supply flights from Nakina where 
there are believed to be approved waste disposal facilities.  There are no other existing 
environmental liabilities that are known to the writer. 
 
Permits are not required for exploration, however meetings are held on a regular basis with the 
First Nations communities in the area to keep them informed of the activities and to address any 
specific concerns they may have.

5.0 HISTORY AND PREVIOUS EXPLORATION 
 
5.1 HISTORY 
 
The Geological Survey of Canada and the Ontario Department of Mines carried out regional 
studies circa 1906 and again between 1940 and 1965. The early work focused on the petroleum 
possibilities of the sedimentary basins in Hudson and James Bays and on industrial and fuel 
minerals in the Moose River Basin.  
 
In 1959, Consolidated African Selection Trust started diamond exploration in the Lowlands 
(Janse and Sheahan, 2003) and were joined by De Beers South Africa interests in 1962 (Timmins 
Assessment File T.4663).  Monopros Ltd., De Beers' Canadian subsidiary, discovered the 
Attawapiskat kimberlite cluster in 1988 (T.4663) by tracing a picroilmenite (a Kimberlite 
Indicator Mineral- KIM) dispersal train from Hearst northwards to the Attawapiskat River where 
diamonds were discovered in river sands and the Uniform kimberlite found in outcrop. 
 
In the early 1990's, Spider Resources Inc., ("Spider") and KWG Resources Inc., ("KWG") 
commenced an ambitious, airborne magnetic-based, diamond exploration program in the 
northern James Bay Lowlands as joint venture partners, discovering the Good Friday and 
MacFayden kimberlites in the Attawapiskat cluster and an additional five kimberlites to the east.   
 
In 2002 De Beers Canada Inc., ("De Beers") in joint venture with Spider and KWG discovered 
the McFaulds No. 1 volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) body while drilling some isolated 
magnetic anomalies in search of kimberlites. In November 2002, Spider recorded the first group 
of claims surrounding the initial VMS discovery and subsequent work by Spider and KWG 
discovered the rest of the McFaulds occurrences, including McFaulds No. 3 VMS body. Many 
other junior mining companies started staking in late 2002 (December) and then again during the 
first half of 2003.  
 
The Double Eagle Claims were staked by Noront in 2003, following the VMS discovery, and a 
Fugro Geotem survey was flown later that year.  
  
Noront optioned the Double Eagle claims to Hawk Precious Minerals Inc., (now Hawk Uranium 
Inc.), who in turn optioned them to Probe Mines Ltd., ("Probe"). 
 
Probe completed an exploration program in early 2006 with 11 holes testing various (mostly 
VMS style) anomalies. Probe returned the Double Eagle Claims back to Noront in early 2007. 
 
The Condor Property, which was contiguous to the Double Eagle claims, consisted of two claims 
which were optioned to Noront in May 2007. Noront holds a 100% interest on these claims, 
subject to a 1% NSR Royalty, and it was in early September 2007 that Noront announced the 
discovery of significant Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization on the Condor claims. Noront's diamond 
drill hole NOT-07-05 drilled vertically into the heart of a magnetic and electromagnetic target, 
remained in massive sulphide for a 68.3 metre section (not true width) and averaged 5.9% Ni, 
3.1% Cu, 2.87 g/t Pt, 9.78 g/t Pd, 0.61 g/t Au and 8.5 g/t Ag. The deposit was named Eagle One, 
and the ultramafic sill occupying an unconformity between the basement granodiorite on the 
inside of an arc, and the volcanic belt on the outside of the arc was dubbed the "Ring of Fire". 
 
After viewing the chalcopyrite and pentlandite mineralization in the core from the first hole of 
the program, Noront contacted a staking contractor to launch a staking campaign. Claims were

Eagle One Report No. 149 

staked immediately around the discovery site, to the north-east, and to the north-west. By the 
time the drill had completed the second hole, news of the Noront claim-stakers moving into the 
area had leaked out and a number of competing groups began arriving. Helicopter assisted 
staking ensued in the immediate area, initially involving a group headed up by Temex Resources 
Corp. and Baltic Resources Inc., in joint venture with MacDonald Mines Exploration Ltd.  After 
the visuals for hole NOT-07-05 were reported to Noront's management in Toronto, a press 
release was drafted and disseminated. This caught the attention of several other juniors, all vying 
for claims as close to Noront's discovery site as possible. At one point, there were a minimum of 
10 helicopters in the immediate area, staking anything possessing a high magnetic signature, in a 
pattern that covered the geophysically interpreted greenstone belt in contact with the centrally 
located granodiorite (Precambrian gneissic complex) dome. Staking continued from early 
September 2007 until well into 2008, covering most of the area interpreted as being the "Ring of 
Fire", and west toward De Beers Canada's Victor Diamond Mine.  
 
The mining recorder for the area confirmed to Noront that this was the largest staking rush in the 
province of Ontario since the Hemlo discovery.

6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
6.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
Stott (e.g., 2007) and coworkers have done much to elucidate basement geology under the 
Hudson Bay Platform.  Public domain aeromagnetic data supported by isotope chemistry of a 
small number of diamond drill core samples provided the basis for a preliminary geological base 
for the region.  
 
The James Bay Lowlands are defined by flat-lying, Paleozoic platform rocks, which are covered 
by a thin but persistent layer of glacial and periglacial sediments.  The Paleozoic carbonates are 
up to 75 metres thick in the McFaulds Lake area and feather out toward the west. 
 
6.1.1 PRECAMBRIAN GEOLOGY 
 
The Precambrian geology of the area is inferred from airborne geophysical data supplemented by 
sparse gravity and diamond drill data.  Magnetic patterns suggest a basement complex 
comprising volcanic and sedimentary belts between large expanses of granite and gneisses.  The 
Oxford-Stull Domain (Stott, 2007) extends eastwards under Paleozoic cover and into James Bay.  
There are a handful of basement inliers in the Lowlands as follows: 

• Coarse-grained fragmental and pillowed basalt ~30 kilometres north of Missisa Lake 
(McBride, 1994) 

• Fine- to medium-grained intermediate to felsic volcanic ~55 kilometres north north-west  
of Missisa Lake 

• Aphebian (Proterozoic) iron formation, greywacke and other clastic sediments (Sutton 
Ridge Formation), dolomite, limestone and minor argillite (Nowashe Formation) and 
Archean gneisses are exposed in the Sutton inlier ~200 kilometres north north-east of 
Missisa Lake (Bostock, 1971) 

• Sheared mafic to intermediate metavolcanics outcrop in the north-east part of the project 
area (Thomas, 1995).  

Recent work by Stott (e.g., 2007) suggests that the Oxford-Stull Domain comprises an older core 
(2870 to 2830 Ma) perhaps built on a remnant mid-oceanic ridge.  Stott et al., have reported that 
greenstone belts date between 2737 and 2695 Ma which are comparable with data from other 
parts of the Superior Province.  For example host calc-alkaline volcanics from McFaulds Lake 
show a U/Pb zircon isotopic age of 2737±7 Ma.  It should be noted that these new data 
complicate the former picture of progressively older greenstone belts into the northwest corner 
of the province.  A paleo weathering profile, locally including a regolith, is preserved in the 
upper 10 to 20 metres of Precambrian basement immediately below the Paleozoic platform. 
 
6.1.2 PALEOZOIC GEOLOGY 
 
The Paleozoic section spans Ordovician to Cretaceous, the latter being developed in the Moose 
River basin far to the south-east. In the project area, the section is limited to Ordovician and 
Silurian rocks, which are absent along the west edge of the project area but reach ~100 metres to 
the south and east. The section in the project area comprises thin, poorly consolidated, basal 
sandstone, mudstone overlain by muddy dolomites, and limestone intervals of Ordovician and 
Silurian age. 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 13 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

6.1.3 QUATERNARY GEOLOGY 
 
The thickness of the Quaternary section ranges from 3.5 to 10 metres in drill holes. It typically 
comprises 1 to 2 metres of sandy (Wisconsin) till overlain by sand (proximal varves?) grading up 
to clays (distal varves?) and capped by marine clays (Thomas, 2004). Older, pre-Wisconsin, 
interglacial sediments and tills are locally preserved (e.g., DR 95-46).  
 
Glacial striae suggest a southwesterly ice flow in east and south parts of the area and to the 
south-east, west of 85°W (e.g., Bell, 1872, 1878; Fulton, 1995). More recent work (e.g., 
Thorleifson et al., 1993) suggests that the predominant Late Wisconsin ice flow direction was 
west or north-west migrating through time to the south-west. They argue that the south to south-
east flow patterns, termed the Winisk Ice Stream (e.g., Fulton, 1995), were late and short-lived.

6.2 LOCAL AND PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
 
A mantle derived, highly magnetic ultramafic intrusion ("the Ring of Fire Intrusion" or "RFI") 
has been emplaced along the margin of a regional scale granodiorite pluton which had been 
intruded into and caused a doming of the host Sachigo greenstone belt rocks. The RFI is thus 
situated between the granodiorite on one hand (footwall) and the surrounding Sachigo 
greenstone belt rocks (hangingwall) on the other. The RFI is magnetically distinct allowing it to 
be traced more or less uninterrupted, for tens of kilometres along the granodiorite margin. It 
appears that a series of conduits cutting across the granodiorite have acted as feeders to the main 
RFI. 
 
The Eagle One Deposit is interpreted as occurring well within a conduit feeder, at some distance 
from the main RFI. In addition to the Eagle One Deposit, Noront has also discovered, two  
kilometres south-west, the Blackbird One Chromite Deposit, the Eagle Two shear-hosted Ni-Cu-
PGE Deposit (collectively also known as AT2), and most recently the Blackbird Two Chromite 
Occurrence. At the time of writing of this report, two drill holes had been completed on 
Anomaly AT12, which returned encouraging widths of visual copper-nickel-iron sulphide 
mineralization up to 29.2 metres in peridotite host rock. Assays are pending.  
 
The Eagle Two discovery is interpreted as occurring within the "throat or mouth" portion of the 
conduit where it empties into the main RFI.  The mineralization at this point in the system 
consists of mineralized zones that contain numerous thin Ni-Cu bearing sulphide layers or 
"fingers" that "feather" out into the main RFI.  
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 15 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

The most recent drilling at Eagle Two suggests that the zone of finger-style mineralization is 
coalescing and increasing in overall thickness as it is tested to the west, presumably into a 
conduit that is part of the original feeder system. The sulphide mineralization is also interpreted 
as moving away from the chromite mineralization further suggesting that the Eagle Two 
mineralizing environment is moving further away from the RFI and into a possible feeder 
conduit environment similar to that at the Eagle One Deposit.

7.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The "Ring of Fire" is clearly an emerging metal district. The McFaulds No. 1 and No. 3 VMS 
occurrences, Noront's Eagle One Magmatic Sulphide Deposit, Noront's Blackbird One Chromite 
Deposit and Blackbird Two Chromite Occurrence, as well as other Cu-Pb-Zn hits (results 
pending) by the Metalex Ventures Ltd./WSR Gold Inc. joint venture in the area leave no doubt 
about this.   
 
The Eagle One Deposit is clearly a magmatic sulphide deposit, and Section 7.1 presents this 
particular deposit type. In addition to the magmatic sulphide type, a chromite and volcanogenic 
massive sulphide type are discussed.  
 
7.1 MAGMATIC NICKEL-COPPER-PLATINUM GROUP ELEMENTS TYPE 
 
A broad group of deposits containing nickel-copper-platinum group elements (PGE) occur as 
sulphur segregations associated with a variety of mafic and ultramafic magmatic rocks. Among 
such deposits, two main subtypes are distinguishable. In the first, the Ni-Cu sulphide type, nickel 
and copper are economic commodities contained in sulphide-rich ores that are associated with 
differentiated mafic sills and stocks and ultramafic volcanic (komatiitic) volcanic flows and sills. 
The second type, magmatic PGE is mined principally for PGE's which are associated with 
sparsely dispersed sulphides in medium to large, typically layered mafic to ultramafic intrusions. 
 
Nickel-copper sulphide deposits are sulphide concentrations that occur in certain mafic and/or 
ultramafic intrusions or volcanic flows. Nickel is the main economic commodity; copper may be 
either a co-product or by-product, and platinum group elements (PGEs) are usual by-products. 
Other commodities recovered in some cases include gold, silver, cobalt, sulphur, selenium, and 
tellurium. These metals are associated with sulphides, which generally make up more than 10% 
of the ore. 
 
As a group, magmatic nickel-copper sulphide deposits have accounted for most of the world's 
past and current production of nickel. International reserves of magmatic sulphide nickel remain 
large, though they are exceeded by those of lateritic nickel deposits, the only other significant 
source of nickel. 
 
Most nickel sulphide deposits consist of several closely adjacent, but discrete orebodies, 
therefore the definition of "deposit" is rather arbitrary. Individual orebodies may contain from a 
few hundred thousand to a few million tonnes of ore, and in some instances tens of millions of 
tonnes of ore. Mining grades are generally about 1 to 3% Ni, but may be higher in some small 
deposits. Noteworthy exceptions are some of the ore zones in the Talnakh camp of the Noril'sk 
area, where substantial orebodies average several per cent Ni and greater than 20% Cu. 
 
There are four subtypes of this deposit and all subtypes have some general similarities. For 
example, the host intrusions in all cases are either mafic or ultramafic in composition. In 
addition, most deposits occur as sulphide concentrations toward the base of their magmatic host 
bodies. Furthermore, all subtypes of nickel sulphide ores usually consist mainly of the simple 
sulphide assemblage pyrrhotite-pentlandite-chalcopyrite, either as massive sulphides, sulphide-
matrix breccias, or disseminations of sulphides. Nickel-copper sulphide ores of any of the 
subtypes that have undergone tectonic remobilization have been converted to similar-appearing 
sulphide-matrix breccias. The subtypes differ significantly in their geological-tectonic settings 
and in the geometric form and style of differentiation of the host magmatic bodies. They differ 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 18 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

also in that the magmatic hosts in most subtypes are intrusions, but in the komatiitic subtype 
most are volcanic flows. Furthermore the ores of the various subtypes show some differences in 
composition, most noticeably in their Ni:Cu ratios.  
 
The komatiitic subtype, (to which the Eagle One Deposit belongs) is the third most important 
type in the world. Proterozoic komatiitic deposits of the Thompson Nickel Belt in Manitoba 
account for one quarter to one third of current nickel production in Canada. Archean komatiitic 
deposits at Kambalda and elsewhere in Western Australia yield most of that country's produced 
nickel. Several small nickel mines in the Abitibi greenstone belt of Ontario and Quebec are also 
Archean komatiitic deposits. 
 
Most of the Canadian Archean nickel deposits are found in the Abitibi greenstone belt of the 
Superior province (e.g., Langmuir, Redstone, Marbridge, Texmont, Alexo; Coad, 1979; Barnes, 
1985; Barrie et al., 1993). Those in the Shaw dome area south of Timmins are associated with a 
discontinuous horizon of spinifex-textured komatiitic flows (probably 2707 Ma; Corfu, 1993) at 
the base of a volcanic cycle which comprises an ultramafic-mafic-felsic succession. Other nickel 
deposit-bearing komatiites in the Timmins area are considered to be part of the same horizon. 
Furthermore, in both the Kambalda and Shaw dome-Timmins areas, most of the ore-bearing 
komatiite is directly underlain by sulphidic sediments (Coad, 1979; Lesher, 1989). Many believe 
these sediments are the source of sulphur that became incorporated in the komatiitic magmas and 
gave rise to the ores. In both the Norseman-Wiluna and Abitibi greenstone belts, some larger, but 
sub-economic, low grade disseminated nickel sulphide deposits occur in thicker and larger 
dunitic sills of komatiitic affiliation. These are generally separate from the areas in which 
extrusive komatiite hosted nickel deposits occur. Figure 7.1 demonstrates the "multi-deposit" 
aspect of magmatic nickel deposits using the Kambalda camp in the Norseman-Wiluna 
greenstone belt in Australia as an example.

7.2  MAFIC TO ULTRAMAFIC-HOSTED CHROMITE DEPOSIT TYPE  
 
Chromite is mined almost exclusively from massive to semi massive accumulations in ultramafic 
or mafic igneous rocks. Hard rock chromite deposits are normally assigned either to stratiform or 
podiform on the basis of deposit geometry, petrological character, and tectonic setting. 
 
Stratiform chromite deposits are sheet-like accumulations of chromite that occur in layered 
ultramafic to mafic igneous intrusions. The best examples of stratiform chromite deposits in 
Canada occur in the Bird River Sill in south-eastern Manitoba and in the Big Trout Lake 
intrusion in north-western Ontario. Other intrusions in Canada with chromitite layers include the 
Muskox complex in the Northwest Territories, the Lac des Montagnes body in Quebec, and the 
Puddy Lake and Crystal Lake intrusions in Ontario. 
 
There is no past or current production from stratiform chromite deposits in Canada apart from 
approximately 6000 tons of material which was mined at Puddy Lake, Ontario in the 1930's.  
 
Stratiform chromite deposits occur in large, layered intrusions which are commonly 
differentiated into a lower ultramafic zone and an upper mafic zone. The intrusions fall into two 
broad categories with respect to morphology. The first includes essentially tabular bodies which 
were emplaced as sill-like intrusions in which igneous layering is conformable to the floor. 
Examples include Kemi, Campo Formoso, Stillwater Complex, Bird River Sill, and Big Trout 
Lake. 
 
The intrusions which host stratiform chromite deposits occur in a variety of tectonic settings. The 
Bushveld Complex, Great Dyke, and Muskox Intrusion are unmetamorphosed and were 
emplaced into stable cratonic settings. The Kemi and Campo Formoso intrusions are 
prekinematic and occur at the unconformable contact between Archean granitic basement and 
overlying, mainly sedimentary Proterozoic supracrustal rocks. The Bird River Sill and Big Trout 
Lake body are synvolcanic intrusions in Archean greenstone belt settings. 
 
Most stratiform chromite deposits comprise laterally extensive chromite-rich layers which, 
despite local irregularities are generally conformable to and form an integral part of the igneous 
layering that characterizes such intrusions. The individual chromite rich layers range from less 
than 1 cm to more than 1 m in thickness, but their lateral extent is measured in kilometres or tens 
of kilometres. Chromite bearing horizons may be interlayered with a variety of rock types 
including dunite, peridodite, orthopyroxenite, anorthosite and norite and may occur at various 
stratigraphic levels within the host layered intrusion. However because chromite in the most 
primitive rocks tends to be the most Cr –rich mineral species the immediate host rocks of 
economically significant chromitites are peridotites, or less commonly, pyroxenites. Orebodies 
may comprise discrete layers of massive chromitite rocks as in the Bushveld complex and Kemi 
deposit or a number of closely spaced chromite-rich layers separated by UM rocks.  
 
The association of chromite with magmatic platinum group element deposits is well known. The 
association is two-fold. Firstly, the intrusions hosting the most prominent PGE "reefs" (Bushveld 
Complex, Stillwater Complex, and Great Dyke) also contain significant stratiform chromite 
deposits, normally at lower levels in the igneous stratigraphy. 

7.2.1 BLACKBIRD ONE CHROMITE DEPOSIT 
 
The following description is taken directly from a report by Dr. James E. Mungall, Noront's 
Chief Geologist. In the winter of 2008, Noront encountered massive chromitite mineralization in 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 22 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

boreholes drilled to test airborne anomaly AT2 on the Double Eagle Property. The AT2 anomaly 
is a coincident magnetic and conductive feature that was recognized as paired linear AeroTEM 
conductors striking parallel to the margins of a highly magnetic body several kilometres long.  
The magnetic body is connected directly to the Eagle One magmatic massive sulfide deposit and 
as such was considered a prime target for further discoveries of peridotite-hosted magmatic 
sulfide mineralization.  Diamond drilling into the conductive anomalies confirmed that the 
magnetic anomaly corresponds to a large body of metadunite and metaharzburgite that has been 
altered to magnetite-rich tremolite serpentinite and talc-carbonate rock.  Drill holes encountered 
extensive Ni-rich sulphide mineralization hosted by shear zones parallel to the contact between 
the ultramafic rocks and their felsic plutonic (granodiorite, sensu lato) host rocks.  The sulphide 
deposit at the AT2 anomaly area was named the Eagle Two deposit. 
 
Below the Eagle Two shear-hosted sulphide deposit the drilling unexpectedly intersected 
chromite mineralization. The chromite mineralization has been named the Blackbird One 
Deposit.  Blackbird One mineralization consists of massive chromitite layers interbedded with 
chromite-rich metadunite, now entirely replaced by talc carbonate minerals, chromite, and minor 
ferrochrome overgrowths.   
 
Several drill holes intersected massive chromitite mineralization. The layers vary widely in 
thickness, from centimetres on the margins of the Blackbird One deposit to continuous massive 
chromitite intersections approaching true thicknesses of 30 metres at its central axis.  The 
mineralization is thickest along an axis plunging steeply to the northwest from a near-surface 
expression near the southeast extremity of the drill pattern.  To the southwest of this axis the 
mineralization thins rapidly to nothing; along the northeast side there are insufficient data to tell 
the shape of the body at the time of writing. 
 
The chromite mineralization at Blackbird One shows several different textural and structural 
styles.  In the host ultramafic silicate rocks there is abundant chromite which stands out in drill 
core as isolated or disseminated submillimetric black euhedra in the white talc-carbonate host 
rock. The modal abundance of chromite varies from less than 1% to as much as 25% and locally 
shows evidence of primary layering.  When chromite abundance reaches 25% the rock typically 
shows antinodular texture, with submillimetre chromite grains forming a closely packed matrix 
around larger pseudomorphs of olivine. Within domains showing disseminated or antinodular 
texture there are common cognate xenoliths of chromitite or dunite up to several centimetres in 
size. Where xenoliths are larger than the diameter of the core they may become difficult to 
distinguish from primary layers, however, most primary layering preserves some combination of 
centimetric layering and fine laminations, which make identification unequivocal.  
 
The chromitite mineralization does not have a notably strong magnetic susceptibility, compared 
with serpentinized dunite and peridotite which are both common in the area around Eagle One, 
Eagle Two, and the Blackbird One Deposits.  Chromite is an electrical insulator hence there is no 
EM expression from the chromite deposit despite the presence of traces of interstitial sulfide 
minerals in the massive chromitite.    
 
A useful characteristic of chromite is its high density, around 4.5, which is similar to that of 
magnetite and pyrrhotite.  Massive chromite therefore has an anomalously high density 
compared even with ultramafic rocks and is detectable by gravity survey when it exists in 
sufficient tonnages.    
 
The demonstration of a detectable gravitational response to the massive chromitite at the 
Blackbird One Deposit has been used to infer the presence of another body of chromitite some

900 metres long striking 60° away from the AT2 area. A single diamond drill hole through the 
highest part of the density anomaly at line 4000E cut two bodies of massive chromitite, each 
with apparent thicknesses of approximately 20 metres.  The new mineralized zone has been 
named the Blackbird Two Deposit. 
 
Massive layers of chromitite vary in thickness from centimetres to apparent thicknesses 
exceeding 70 metres and true thicknesses probably exceeding 30 metres.  Within massive layers 
there are occasional xenoliths and thin beds of talc after olivine. The chemical composition of 
the chromitite mineralization has been assessed by three methods; whole-rock assay by 
instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), electron microprobe analysis of individual 
chromite grains (EMP), and hand-held semi-quantitative X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (H-
XRF).   
 
Assay results through the chromitite zone in drillhole 1G17 are shown in Figure 7.3.  Cr was 
determined by INAA and is not subject to matrix effects; the results are therefore considered to 
be quantitative.  The main mineralized zone remains well above 40% Cr2O3 for more than 30 
metres, and includes a zone greater than 5 metres wide that averages above 45% Cr2O3.  Similar 
results have been reported in other holes, and further assay results are pending.  The Cr/Fe 
elemental weight percent ratio in the whole rock is consistently above 2 and averages about 2.6 
over the massive chromitite interval.  
 
Electron microprobe analyses were conducted on polished thin sections of samples taken at 
intervals through several chromitite intersections.  Ten grains were analyzed at random from 
each thin section.  Notable results include the observations that the Cr/Fe ratio of the chromite 
ranges from 1.6 to 2.2, and that the Cr2O3 concentration in a chromite mineral concentrate 
would exceed 52%.

7.2.2 ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHROMITE MINING 
 
Annual production of chromite ores is approximately 19 Mt, 90% of which is used to make 
ferrochrome alloy for use in steel.  Chromium ores and products are sold in three principal forms 
worldwide.  Direct shipping ore is referred to as lumpy ore and is sold by contract only.  The 
lump ore is defined as the > 6 mm size fraction; < 6 mm fractions are sold as fines and carry a 
lower price.  High-grade lump ore can be fed directly into smelters and there is a global trade in 
this material, particularly from developing countries to a growing metallurgical market in China.  
Fine-grained chromite concentrates are not amenable to smelting and must be pelletized first; 
most pelletizing operations are integrated with smelters and there is little trade in concentrates.  
However, the bulk of trade in chromium products is in the ferrochrome product of smelting.  
Most ferrochrome is produced by vertically integrated large-scale mining, pelletizing and 
smelting operations that produce the ferrochrome on site or very near to the mine site.  
  
The dominant player in the world ferrochrome market is South Africa, which accounted for 43% 
of global production in 2005.  Major producers include Assmang Ltd., Kermas Group Ltd., 
(formerly Samancor Chrome Mines, South Africa), Xstrata South Africa Proprietary Ltd., and 
International Ferro Metals Ltd.  Most ferrochrome produced in South Africa is made from ores 
mined from the stratiform chromitite deposits of the Bushveld Complex of South Africa.   
Annual production in 2005 was 7.645 Mt.  These ores have moderate grades compared with 
some smaller deposits worldwide but are economic due to economies of scale and simple deposit 
geometry.  Other important producers are India (3.640 Mt), Kazakhstan (3.566 Mt), Finland 
(0.572 Mt), Turkey and India.   
 
Lump ore prices are reported in units called dry metric ton units (dmtu).  The price of an ore is 
found by multiplying the concentration of Cr2O3 in wt% by the price in dmtu; for example, a 
Turkish lump ore containing 39% Cr2O3 was sold in May 2008 at a price of USD14.97/dmtu for 
a price of $583/Mt ex ports (http://www.asianmetals.com).  The value of lump ore increases 
dramatically as the grade increases above 30%; no significant international trade takes place at 
grades below this value.  The value of a concentrate containing 50% Cr2O3 is approximately 
$750/ton (http://www.asianmetals.com). 
 
The smelting process adds considerable value to chromite ores if a deposit is large enough to 
justify the capital cost of a smelter. The product of smelting is ferrochrome alloy, whose price 
has rapidly increased in recent years due to interruptions of the electricity supply in South Africa 
and mounting demand from China. The Q3 contract price for high-carbon 65% ferrochrome is 
$US $2.05, up from about $US 0.60 in mid-2005 
(http://www.metalprices.com/FreeSite/metals/cr/cr.asp). The contained metal value in a ton of 
ore at 40% Cr2O3 therefore is $1,890 a considerable increase over the May 2008 lump ore value 
of about $600 ex ports. 
 
The closest geological analogs to the Blackbird One Deposit are the Kemi Mine in Finland, the 
Ipueira-Medrados Deposit in Brazil, and the Sukinda Valley Deposit in India.  All consist of 
massive chromitite bodies up to several tens of metres thick and hundreds of metres long, hosted 
by ultramafic rocks predominantly consisting of dunite and harzburgite, and all are currently 
being mined. 
 
The Kemi Mine is the best described of these similar deposits.  It is a massive body 40 metres 
thick dipping 70°.  Ore reserves in January 2006 were 41.1 Mt grading 24.5% Cr2O3 and 
Inferred Resources of 86.1 Mt at 29% Cr2O3.  The Cr/Fe ratio is 1.53.  From 1968 to 2005 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 26 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

mining was from an open pit, but with stripping ratios becoming intolerable in the late 1990's, an 
underground operation was begun, and since 2006 all production has been from underground, 
(Duke, 1998).    
 
Production from Kemi in 2005 was 1.1 Mt, recovering 572,000 t of lumpy ore (36% Cr2O3) and 
metallurgical grade concentrate with a grade of 44% Cr2O3, which were used to produce 
235,000 t of ferrochrome (Duke, 1998). 
 
Grades at Noront's Blackbird One compare favourably with those at the world's most important 
chromite producers.  The deposit is the latest example of the Kemi Deposit type, represented by 
important producing mines on three continents that collectively account for approximately one 
third of global chromite production.  A geophysical anomaly known to correspond to the 
presence of massive chromitite persists for more than one kilometre along strike from the 
Blackbird One Deposit, indicating that the potential exists for a multimillion ton resource 
comparable in size to the Kemi, Sukinda Valley, or Ipueira-Medrados Deposits. 
 
7.3 VOLCANOGENIC MASSIVE SULPHIDE TYPE 
 
All volcanic-associated massive sulphide deposits occur in terranes dominated by volcanic rocks. 
The individual deposits however may be hosted predominantly by volcanic or sedimentary strata, 
all of which form integral parts of a volcanic complex. Such deposits are also commonly referred 
to as volcanogenic massive sulphides, or simply as VMS. 
 
These deposits are important sources of base metals and precious metals in Canada. In 1988 they 
produced 32.8% of Canada's copper, 29.4% of its lead, 56.3% of its zinc, 3.6% of its gold, and 
30.4% of its silver. 
 
The deposits occur in two distinct compositional groups, the copper-zinc group and the zinc-
lead-copper group, according to their total contained copper, lead, and zinc (Figure 7.7). Using 
the Zn/Zn+Pb ratio, the division between these two groups is established at 0.90. All are within 
sequences dominated by submarine volcanic rocks, and contain about 90% iron sulphide (pyrite 
dominant). They consist of two parts: massive sulphide ore that formed either on or immediately 
below the seafloor and generally less important vein and disseminated ore (stringer zone) that 
immediately underlies the massive sulphide ore. The stringer ore is usually within an intensely 
metasomatically altered "alteration pipe". Deposits of the volcanic-associated massive sulphide 
type are important sources of copper, zinc, and lead; many deposits contain economically 
recoverable silver and gold. Cadmium, tin, indium, bismuth, and selenium are also recovered as 
smelter by products. 
 
These deposits occur in two principal geological settings; 1) in mafic-volcanic dominated areas, 
such as Archean and Proterozoic greenstone belts and modern and Phanerozoic spreading ridges 
and seamounts; 2) in areas containing subequal amounts of both mafic volcanic rocks and 
sedimentary strata, such as are in Phanerozoic arc sequences. 
 
Significant variation in the composition of these deposits, and the alteration associated with 
them, has been related to the depth of water under which the deposits formed. Morton and 
Franklin (1987) defined two groups: 
 
1) Deposits typified by the Noranda and Matagami Lake Districts, Quebec (Figure 7.6) were 
formed at depths of considerably more than 500 metres. These are associated with sequences 
composed primarily of massive to pillowed mafic flows. Felsic ash-flow tuff beds are usually 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 27 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

prominent immediately below the deposits, and felsic domes may immediately underlie or 
enclose the ore. However, the amount of felsic rock in the footwall sequence may be only minor 
(Flin Flon, Manitoba), or comprise as much as 30% (e.g. Noranda); 
 
2) A second group of deposits, typified by those near Sturgeon Lake, Ontario, Hackett River, 
Northwest Territories, and possibly the Kidd Creek Mine near Timmins, Ontario, are associated 
with volcanic rocks deposited in subaerial to shallow marine environments (<500 metres). These 
include mafic and felsic amygdaloidal and scoriaceous flows and pyroclastic rocks, volcanic 
breccia, and epiclastic strata. Felsic rocks typically comprise 30% of the footwall sequence. 
 
Both groups of deposits occur in volcanic sequences that have prominent subvolcanic intrusions 
near their base. Trondhjemitic intrusions predominate (Noranda, Sturgeon Lake, Flin Flon, Snow 
Lake), but a layered mafic intrusion forms the base of the Matagami Lake Sequence.

Eagle One Report No. 149 

8.0 MINERALIZATION 
 
The Eagle One Deposit is comprised of massive and net textured sulphides with little to no 
disseminated sulphides in the deposit. Descriptions of the mineralization that follow are taken 
directly from reports by Dr. James E. Mungall, Chief Geologist for Noront.  
  
8.1 MASSIVE SULPHIDES 
 
Massive sulphides at the Eagle One Deposit comprise pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite, 
with subsidiary amounts of equant millimetric magnetite.  In most examples the rocks are very 
coarse-grained, with grain sizes up to 1 centimetre and well-formed pentlandite "eyes".  
Sometimes the pentlandite is seen to be aligned along microfractures.  At peak metamorphic 
conditions, all the Ni and perhaps all the Cu in the sulphide was probably present within a 
homogeneous monosulphide solid solution.  The pentlandite probably nucleated and grew during 
retrogression from peak metamorphic conditions, and its occasional habit of forming along the 
margins of fractures probably indicates that it was more easily nucleated on discontinuities.   The 
significance of these textural features is as follows:  since the pentlandite that nucleated along 
fractures is as coarse as the large isolated porphyroblasts ("eyes"), it is likely that all of the 
pentlandite and hence all of the pyrrhotite show metamorphic texture and has been completely 
annealed since peak metamorphic conditions.  It is therefore important to recognize that even 
extreme deformational textures that may have existed in the sulphide at peak conditions will 
have been erased by recrystallization. 
 
8.2 SULPHIDE BRECCIA (DURCHBEWEGUNG TECTURE) 
 
There are many instances in the deposit of medium to very fine-grained massive sulphide veins 
that are rich in inclusions of silicates and which may display pronounced gneissic foliation that 
wraps around the clasts; in light of the comments above, these veins clearly must have 
undergone extreme ductile deformation at post-peak metamorphic conditions.  Motion along 
these zones therefore was very late.  Since sulphide minerals are very ductile at upper 
greenschist or amphibolite facies conditions, massive sulphide bodies commonly serve as 
nucleation points for faults.  Once faulting begins along a surface that includes a massive 
sulphide body, it is not unusual for the sulphides to be squeezed laterally into the fault plane for 
distances of hundreds of metres away from their original sites.  Under the same conditions that 
allow rapid ductile deformation of the sulphides, the host silicate rocks will have been brittle.  As 
a result, the sulphide bodies tend to contain a mixture of brittle angular clasts and wavy schistose 
clasts of host silicate rock. 
 
8.3 SEMI-MASSIVE SULPHIDE 
 
In some cases the massive sulphide texture grades into peridotite through a marginal zone in 
which silicate minerals are completely bathed in sulphide and are not in mutual grain contact.  
Rocks like this may preserve the textures formed at the point where immiscible sulphide liquid 
was becoming fully separated from the hosting silicate crystal mush.  However it is also possible 
that this texture has resulted in part from tectonic disaggregation of net-textured sulphides (see 
below), followed by complete annealing of the texture which would remove all textural evidence 
of deformation. 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 29 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

8.4 NET TEXTURED SULPHIDES 
 
In this texture the silicate minerals form a closely-packed orthocumulate-textured framework, the 
interstices of which are fully occupied by sulphide minerals.  This arrangement is generally 
understood to result from the invasion of a silicate crystal mush by dense immiscible sulphide 
melt that has effectively expelled all the interstitial silicate melt.  In a few examples at Eagle One 
this net texture is observed to be occupied by large (up to 10 cm) pyrrhotite oikocrysts that 
completely fill the interstices of the peridotite orthocumulate texture.  Such large oikocrysts may 
represent primary growth of monosulphide solid solution from the original sulphide melt. 
 
Much of the net-textured sulphide mineralization at the Eagle One Deposit shows a distinct 
metamorphic fabric.  Subparallel wavy veinlets of sulphide minerals are present throughout the 
rock, apparently the result of transfer of sulphide on the grain-scale from the net texture into 
extensional features.  This might have occurred by ductile flow of the sulphides or through 
pressure solution.  This foliation is commonly best developed in parts of the deposit that also 
contain fine-grained sulphide breccias; the combination of metamorphic foliation and discrete 
ductile shear zones indicates that significant deformation has taken place. 
 
The large amounts of sulphide and of ultramafic cumulate make it absolutely clear that the Eagle 
One Deposit formed in a magmatic conduit.  No magma could have carried the observed amount 
of sulphide in solution, therefore the sulphides have been left behind by a through-going volume 
of magma much greater than what presently remains in the intrusion.  Similarly, the mafic 
chilled margins can be interpreted to represent samples of the liquid from which the intrusion 
formed; the ultramafic rocks are cumulates that were gleaned from large volumes of mafic liquid 
that deposited small increments of olivine and pyroxene as it passed by. 
  
If the intrusion is accepted to be a conduit then it must be continuous over considerable distances 
likely measurable in kilometres.  Since diamond drilling has shown that it is surrounded on all 
sides by older felsic intrusive rocks at surface, logic dictates that it must continue at depth.  The 
prospects for continued extension of the mineralized body to depth are excellent, as long as it is 
not lost in a fault zone.  In this regard it is encouraging to note that although the western margin 
has been extensively modified by faulting, it is fundamentally an intrusive contact that is 
preserved in situ.  There is thus no immediate indication of a structural termination of the 
mineralization.   
 
The origins of the sulphides are slightly problematic.  It is generally accepted that in order to 
form a mass of immiscible sulphide liquid on the scale observed at the Eagle One Deposit, a 
mafic or ultramafic magma must become contaminated by sulphide-rich crustal rock.  At its 
present level of exposure the mineralized intrusion is entirely surrounded by sulphur-poor felsic 
intrusive rocks, leaving the origin of the required sulphide in doubt.  Mungall suggests that the 
presence of abundant magnetite-rich xenoliths in the intrusion records a previous episode of 
assimilation of iron formation, which has added sufficient sulphide to the magma to induce 
sulphide liquid saturation.  The conduit has carried the slurry of sulphide droplets and small 
xenoliths to their current location, requiring transport over considerable distances.  This in turn 
suggests that the Eagle One Deposit resides in a large magmatic system with lateral extents at 
least as great as the distance to this same iron formation, which may be represented by the very 
prominent magnetic lineament to the south of the deposit.

8.5 GEOLOGICAL AND MINERALIZATION MODEL 
 
On-going exploration work on the Double Eagle Property is partly predicated upon a conceptual 
model of the mineralizing systems associated with the Ring of Fire. This model has been 
formulated by incorporating recent drill data along with geophysical, geological and other 
technical survey results. Salient features from other established geological models for similar 
mineralizing systems from around the world have also been incorporated into the conceptual 
model, which is in a constant state of revision as new data become available. Key points of the 
Ring of Fire model are as follows: 
 

• A mantle derived, highly magnetic ultramafic intrusion ("the Ring of Fire Intrusion" or 
"RFI") has been emplaced along the margin of a regional scale granodiorite pluton which 
had been intruded into and caused a doming of the host Sachigo greenstone belt rocks 
The RFI is thus situated between the granodiorite on one hand (footwall) and the 
surrounding Sachigo greenstone belt rocks (hangingwall) on the other. The RFI is 
magnetically distinct allowing it to be traced more or less uninterrupted, for tens of 
kilometres along the granodiorite margin. It appears that a series of conduits cutting 
across the granodiorite have acted as feeders to the main RFI. 

• On a world wide basis ultramafic intrusions, such as the RFI, are known to host several 
types of deposits: 

• Layered chromite deposits 
• Nickel-Copper deposits and 
• Platinum Group Metals (PGM) deposits. 

• Recent drilling within the Ring of Fire area confirms that both PGM-rich Ni-Cu deposits 
(Eagle One and Two) and now chromitite deposits, (Blackbird One and Two) are 
associated with the RFI and its related conduit feeder system. On-going drilling by 
Noront and others suggest that the layered chromite mineralization is, as conceptually 
expected from the model, confined strictly to the main RFI while the platinum rich Ni-Cu 
sulphide mineralization appears, at least at this stage of exploration, to be related to the 
conduit feeders.  Based on observations from similar intrusives globally there is no 
reason, at least conceptually, why Ni-Cu or PGM deposits could not be hosted by the RFI 
itself. The exploration potential in this regard remains to be tested.  

• According to the conceptual model, the high-grade Eagle One Deposit is interpreted as 
occurring well within a conduit feeder, at some distance from the main RFI. The Eagle 
Two discovery on the other hand is interpreted as occurring within the "throat or mouth" 
portion of the conduit where it empties into the main RFI.  The mineralization at this 
point in the system consists of mineralized zones that contain numerous thin Ni-Cu 
bearing sulphide layers or "fingers" that "feather" out into the main RFI.  

• The most recent drilling at Eagle Two suggests that the zone of finger-style 
mineralization is coalescing and increasing in overall thickness as it is tested to the west, 
presumable into a conduit that is part of the original feeder system. The sulphide 
mineralization is also interpreted as moving away from the chromite mineralization 
further suggesting that the Eagle Two mineralizing environment is moving further away 
from the RFI and into a possible feeder conduit environment similar to that at Eagle One. 

• It is felt that the drill results obtained to date at Eagle Two are consistent with the 
conceptual model which would suggest that there is significant potential for the discovery 
of another Eagle One - type deposit as the Eagle Two mineralization is traced westward 
into a possible feeder conduit.

9.0 EXPLORATION  
 
Since Noront acquired the Double Eagle Property in 2003, there have been a total of six airborne 
and ground geophysical surveys undertaken as well as an 11 hole diamond drill program 
completed by Probe in 2006, (prior to the 2007 diamond drill program undertaken by Noront). A 
summary of each of the programs is presented in this section. Sub-sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4 
predate the discovery of the Eagle One Deposit, while sub-sections 9.5, 9.6 and 9.7 postdate it. 
No other exploration work has been done on the Property apart from diamond drilling which is 
presented in Section 10.0 of this report. 
 
9.1  2003 FUGRO AIRBORNE SURVEY 
 
An airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey over the McFaulds Lake Area was carried out 
by Fugro Airborne Surveys, ("Fugro") between July 26th and August 10th 2003 from an 
operating base at Pickle Lake, Ontario. A total of 2,148 line kilometres of data was collected, 
which provided among other things, added detail to the sparse geologic information available for 
the area. 
 
The airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey identified a number of interpreted bedrock 
conductors that closely correlate with magnetic anomalies. The associated conductance estimates 
are typically in the range of 30 to 50 siemens which is reasonable for sulphide mineralization. A 
ground survey using a horizontal loop electromagnetic system and magnetometer was suggested 
at the recommended locations and was completed in 2004.  
 
9.2 2004 GROUND MAGNETIC AND HORIZONTAL LOOP EM SURVEY 
 
In March and April 2004, Noront carried out two ground geophysical surveys on two separate 
grids over its mineral claims in the McFaulds Lake area. The data were compiled and interpreted 
by Scott Hogg & Associates Ltd. ("SHA") of Toronto, Ontario.  
 
Ground survey grids were cut with a line interval of 200 metres, perpendicular to a base line, 
which was established using a GPS reference. The data were collected and presented with 
reference to line and station. 
 
The ground magnetic survey was carried out using a Scintrex MP3 proton recession 
magnetometer. Readings were taken at 12.5 metre intervals along the line and recorded digitally 
by the instrument. A second MP3 magnetometer, at a fixed location at the camp recorded diurnal 
magnetic variation and a correction was applied in the field. The corrected digital magnetic files 
were recorded on disk and sent to SHA in Toronto for compilation and analysis. 
 
The magnetic data, collected as profiles, were gridded using the SI-Grid process developed by 
SHA. This interpolation technique preserves all of the detail of the profile data and optimizes the 
correlation of information between adjacent survey lines. The SI-Grid output was contoured at a 
50 nT interval and presented in colour together with survey lines and geographic reference at 
1:20,000 scale. 
 
The ground horizontal loop electromagnetic survey was carried out using a MaxMin II 
instrument. A coil spacing of 150 metres was used and the in-phase and quadrature response 
amplitudes were recorded at 3 frequencies: 444, 1777 and 3555 Hz. Measurements were made 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 32 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

every 25 metres and recorded manually. The field notes were converted to digital files and sent 
to SHA. 
 
On both grids, conductive axes of bedrock origin were mapped within and adjacent to magnetic 
anomalies typical of metavolcanic rocks. It is possible that some or all of these conductors are 
associated with sulphide mineralization. The weaker conductors may be indicative of minor 
pyrite that can occur with gold mineralization and the stronger conductors with massive 
sulphides. Further investigation is warranted but specific anomaly recommendations and 
prioritization cannot be made solely on the basis of the available geophysical information. It is 
also suggested that the circular magnetic anomaly in the northwest corner of Grid 2 might be 
associated with a kimberlite pipe. Magnetic modelling, to determine whether the anomaly dip, 
width and susceptibility is consistent with typical kimberlite, is recommended. 
 
9.3 2006 CONDOR DIAMOND CORP IN-FILL GROUND MAGNETIC SURVEY 
 
In 2003, Condor Diamond Corp., ("Condor") staked several mining claims in the McFaulds Lake 
area based on a regional aeromagnetic survey, (two of the claims were later optioned to Noront 
and the Eagle One Deposit discovery was made on claim number 3012264). In early 2004, 
Condor took part in a ground magnetic and horizontal loop electromagnetic survey that partially 
covered one of these claims. Their target was kimberlite pipes. The claim was one of a 
contiguous pair of four-unit claims that captured two aeromagnetic anomalies. The survey 
revealed an elliptically shaped magnetic anomaly with an associated EM response. The original 
line spacing was 200 metres and was considered insufficient to site a drill hole, and infill lines 
were therefore recommended. 
 
In February 2006, Condor contracted Greenstone Exploration Ltd. to survey infill lines and to 
extend the survey to include the northwest claim. Work began on February 23rd and was 
completed on March 1st. The raw data were forwarded to the offices of SHA in Toronto where 
they were compiled and interpreted. Three anomalies were identified, named A, B and C.  
 
Anomaly A - This anomaly was further resolved magnetically by the infill lines. The magnetic 
field data indicate a SW-NE striking elongated body with a peak amplitude of 4000 nT. The 
modeled body is steeply dipping, with a width of 40 metres to 75 metres, at a depth of 20 to 30 
metres and a magnetic susceptibility of 0.016 to 0.018 emu. *Anomaly A turned out to be the 
Eagle One Deposit. 
 
Anomaly B - This 550 nT anomaly occurs on line 4800, with a slight response on line 5000. The 
model results show a steeply dipping body, with a width of approximately 115 metres and a 
depth of 55 metres. The magnetic susceptibility is 0.0049 emu. 
 
Anomaly C - The anomaly is immediately northwest of anomaly B on line 4800, with a peak 
amplitude of 1100nT. It has a lesser response on line 4600. The model results show a south-
easterly dipping body, with a width of approximately 55 metres at a depth of 18 metres. The 
magnetic susceptibility is 0.00676 emu. 
 
9.4 2006 PROBE DIAMOND DRILL PROGRAM 
 
Noront optioned the Double Eagle claims to Hawk Precious Minerals Inc., (now Hawk Uranium 
Inc.), who in turn optioned them to Probe Mines Ltd.  
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 33 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

Probe drilled eleven holes from February 14 through April 4, 2006 to test selected ground and 
airborne geophysical targets identified from previous surveys, (the closest hole to the Eagle One 
Deposit was drilled approximately 2.5 kilometres north-east of the deposit). The holes ranged in 
length from 103 to 167 metres for a total of 1,585 metres. The diamond drilling was undertaken 
by Norex Drilling of Timmins, Ontario and Cartwright Drilling of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
 
Drilling explained five of the ten conductors, with three targets being explained by sulphide 
mineralization, and two by significant fault structures. Five conductors were not identified and it 
was felt that they were likely due to thick clay deposits or possible conductivity associated with 
mafic/ultramafic mineralogy.  
 
The drilling provided geological information as well. When compared with the central portion of 
the Sachigo Greenstone Belt where the majority of the previous work had been carried out, there 
was found to be an increase in the volume of mafic to ultramafic lithologies associated with 
felsic to intermediate volcanic rocks. 
 
The conclusions stemming from the diamond drill program were that the geology and 
geophysical indications for the presence of VMS-type deposits were encouraging and a second-
phase program of airborne geophysics and diamond drilling was proposed. 
 
Probe returned the claims to Noront in early 2007. 
 
9.5 2007 NORONT AEROTEM II HELICOPTER SURVEY 
 
It is to be noted that the reports discussed in Sections 9.5, 9.6 and 9.7 post date the discovery of 
the Eagle One Deposit. 
 
In late 2007, following the discovery of the Eagle One Deposit, Noront carried out an airborne 
magnetic and electromagnetic survey over a more extensive area in McFaulds Lake. Other 
companies with properties in the vicinity and some with joint venture arrangements with Noront 
wished to participate in the airborne geophysical program. To meet the objectives of a multi-
partner program, Noront arranged for Billiken Management, ("Billiken") to direct the operation. 
Billiken contracted Aeroquest Ltd., ("Aeroquest") to fly the survey using the AeroTem II 
helicopter transient electromagnetic system. SHA were contracted to provide technical 
management, compilation and interpretation services. While the survey was in progress 
Aeroquest provided SHA with field-processed digital data from which preliminary maps, 
representative of the magnetic and electromagnetic data were prepared. An interim report that 
included preliminary anomaly identification and follow-up recommendations was also provided 
by SHA. When completed, the final Aeroquest data, maps and report were distributed.  
 
Follow-up investigation is recommended where a clear indication of a bedrock conductor has 
been interpreted. The highest priority recommendation was reserved for those with a high 
conductance that can often indicate major sulphide mineralization. Lower priorities are 
suggested for lower conductance indications; however, it is important to again note that the 
lower conductance values can be associated economic mineralization such as thinner zones of 
high value minerals or large zones of a less conductive mineral such as zinc.  
 
Twelve anomalies were identified (13 counting the Eagle One Deposit which showed up very 
well as a highly conductive body with a coincident magnetic anomaly). The twelve anomalies 
were prioritized as to high, medium, low and no follow-up recommended.

Eagle One Report No. 149 

One anomaly, 1-36 situated SSW of the Eagle One Deposit was considered high priority for 
follow-up. Anomalies 1-11 and 1-35 were considered medium priority for follow up and 
anomalies 1-07, 1-37 and 1-38 were considered low priority. The remaining five anomalies were 
not recommended for follow-up. 
 
9.6 2007 MAGNETICS, HLEM AND GRAVITY SURVEYS OVER EAGLE 

ONE DEPOSIT 

9.6.1 HLEM AND MAGNETIC SURVEYS 
 
Horizontal loop electromagnetic (HLEM or MaxMin) and magnetic surveys were done over the 
Eagle One Cu-Ni discovery. The field work was done in the period from September 17 to 
October 16, 2007 and detailed in report JVX 7-79. Total coverage was 26,900 metres HLEM and 
44,687.5 metres magnetics. The grid is largely within claims 3012256, 3012259, 3012264 and 
3012265.  
 
Total magnetic intensity readings were made at a station spacing of 12.5 metres using GEM 
Systems GSM-19 and/or Scintrex Envi magnetometer systems. The base station magnetometer 
was set to read the total magnetic intensity every 10 seconds. 
 
The survey grid is centered near 52° 44.5' north, 86° 18' west. For an elevation of 175 m, the 
IGRF on October 1, 2007 is defined by total magnetic intensity = 58,469 nT, inclination = 77.4° 
and declination = 8° west of north. . 
 
HLEM surveys were done with a 150 metre coil spacing at 440, 1760 and 3520 Hz. The reading 
interval was 25 metres. The HLEM coils were held horizontally at the pickets; the lines were 
slope chained. The terrain is flat – the operator entered 0% slope at all stations. A small lake in 
the southeast part of claim 3012264 means a gap in magnetic and HLEM coverage.  
 
The Eagle One Deposit is marked by a distinct magnetic high with a peak over 10,000 nT. The 
magnetic body looks to be no more than 150 metres in strike length and of modest width. Eagle 
One is also marked by strong 440 Hz HLEM anomalies consistent with multiple shallow, strong 
conductors. 

9.6.2 GRAVITY SURVEY 
 
A gravity survey over the Eagle One Deposit was done by JVX Ltd., ("JVX") and detailed in 
report JVX 7-84. Gravity readings were made at 198 stations on 9 traverse lines (49+00E to 
54+00E). Station spacing was 25 or 50 metres.  
 
The Eagle One Deposit is clearly marked in the residual Bouguer gravity as a roughly circular 
gravity high of 0.6 mGal. The gravity high may be open to the south. Small outlier gravity highs 
were not explained. 
 
9.7 2008 MAGNETIC, VLF, HLEM, GRAVITY AND LARGE LOOP TDEM 

SURVEYS 
 
Magnetic/VLF, Horizontal loop electromagnetic (HLEM or MaxMin), gravity and large loop 
TDEM surveys were done on all or parts of Grid 1 by JVX. Grid 1 includes the Eagle One 
Deposit and includes all or parts of claims 3005622, 3005670, 3008261, 3008773, 3008774, 
3012256, 3012259 to 3012262, 3012264 and 3012265. Magnetic/VLF, HLEM and gravity 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 35 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

surveys reported here did not cover claims 3012264 and 3012265 – these claims were surveyed 
in late 2007 under JVX 7-79 and JVX 7-84 (see Sections 9.6.1 and 9.6.2). The field work was 
done in the period from January 20 to May 27, 2008. Total coverage was 144,330 metres 
(magnetic/VLF), 106,150 metres (HLEM), 50,225 metres or 2222 stations (gravity) and 62,575 
metres (TDEM on 14 loops). 
 
Total magnetic intensity and VLF readings were taken every 12.5 metres. Horizontal loop EM 
(HLEM) surveys were done with a 150 metre coil spacing at 440 (or 880) and 1760 Hz, readings 
every 25 metres. Gravity surveys were done over selected grid sections at a station spacing of 25, 
50 metres in areas of less interest. Large loop transient EM (TDEM) surveys were done over 
selected grid sections, readings every 25 or 50 metres.  
 
As of the date of this report, the interpretation, conclusions and recommendations had not been 
completed by JVX and were therefore not available.

10.0 DRILLING 
 
Noront has been drilling continuously since acquiring the Condor claims in May 2007, on which 
the Eagle One Deposit is situated. Thirty five holes were drilled for a total of 5,387 metres at 
Eagle One. The holes were named NOT-07-01 through NOT-08-35.  
 
Drilling was undertaken on 50-metre spaced sections over dip lengths of up to 225 metres, and 
over a strike length of 200 metres.  
 
The drilling contractor was Cabo Drilling of Timmins, Ontario, who was later replaced by 
Forage Orbit Garant of Val-d'Or, Quebec. The initial holes were BQ diameter which was later 
replaced with NQ diameter holes. All holes were surveyed at the collar and downhole using a 
gyro instrument which measured dip and azimuth every 15 metres. Core recovery was 
considered excellent. 
 
A table of the significant intersections through the Eagle One Deposit is presented below.

The Eagle One Deposit was intersected in 23 out of the 35 holes drilled and is currently defined 
over a strike length of 200 metres and to a depth of 225 metres. The Deposit dips semi vertically 
and remains open at depth. All widths reported in the above drilling table are apparent, and true 
widths of the intersections are approximately 2/3 of those reported.

11.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
All drill core was picked up from the drills twice daily at shift change and flown by helicopter to 
the base camp. The core was taken to the core shack where it was logged by one of the 
geologists on the project. Mineralization was identified as being either disseminated, net textured 
or massive sulphide and details as to the type and percentage of mineralization were recorded in 
the logs. Sample intervals were chosen based on geology and contacts between the different 
types of mineralization were not crossed. Typical sample intervals ranged from 1 to 1.5 metres 
but may have varied slightly at the geologist's discretion. Each sample interval has a unique 
sample tag. 
 
Core was sawn in half using an electric saw equipped with a diamond-embedded blade. After 
sawing, core samples are placed in plastic sample bags, sealed with tape and placed inside a rice 
bag, which is then placed inside a plastic bucket. All the sample numbers are recorded on a 
sample shipment form which is inserted into each bucket.  Once the bucket is full, the lid is 
hammered on and a security seal is attached joining the bucket and lid. The buckets are flown to 
Thunder Bay via Nakina Air Services who fly in and out of the camp on an almost daily basis.  
 
Approximately half the holes were sent to ALS Chemex Labs in Thunder Bay for prep, with the 
pulps forwarded to Vancouver for analysis.  The other half of the holes were sent to SGS 
Mineral Services in Toronto for preparation and analysis. 
 
There are no obvious drilling, sampling or recovery factors that would impact the reliability of 
the core samples. The even distribution of the sulphides in all types of mineralization ensures 
that the samples are of high quality and representative of the material or mineralization being 
sampled.

Eagle One Report No. 149 

12.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
Samples awaiting shipment to Thunder Bay are placed in the outbound cargo area beside the trail 
leading to the lake. When the plane arrives the buckets are taken to the plane and loaded on. 
Samples were not secured in locked facilities as this precaution was deemed unnecessary due to 
the remote and isolated camp location.  
 
No aspect of the sample preparation was conducted by an employee, officer, director or associate 
of Noront. 
 
12.1 ALS CHEMEX ANALYTICAL PROTOCOL 
 
The split drill core samples were crushed in their entirety to 90% passing 2 millimetres and the 
crusher was cleaned with barren rock between samples. From the coarse rejects a sub-sample of 
one kilogram was split and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns. The pulveriser was cleaned 
with silica sand between samples. 
 
From each pulp, a 100-gram sub-sample was split and shipped to the ALS Chemex laboratory in 
Vancouver, British Columbia for assay. The remainder of the pulp and the rejects are held at the 
preparation laboratory in Thunder Bay for future reference. The ALS Chemex quality system 
complies with the requirements of the international standards ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 
17025:2005 and operates at all laboratory sites.  
 
The base metals of economic interest (nickel and copper), were determined using a 0.2-gram 
aliquot that was subjected to Geochemical Procedure MS61, (ALS Chemex internal code). This 
method uses a four-acid solution to digest the sample, followed by ICP-AES or ICP-AAS finish.  
 
Silver was digested using aqua regia (3-acid) followed by AAS. 
 
The precious metals gold, platinum and palladium, were determined using Procedure PGM-
ICP27 (ALS Chemex internal code) on a thirty-gram fire assay, followed by ICP-AES. 
 
12.2 SGS MINERAL SERVICES ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES 
 
Approximately half way through the drill program, Noront began using the services of SGS 
Mineral Services in Toronto, Ontario instead of ALS Chemex. The change was made in hopes 
that the assay turn around time would be improved from the almost 8 weeks at Chemex. 
 
SGS Minerals Services are ISO/IEC 17025 accredited and most major regional facilities are ISO 
9001 certified.  
 
The split drill core samples were crushed in their entirety to 90% passing 2 millimetres and the 
crusher was cleaned with barren rock between samples. From the coarse rejects a sub-sample of 
one kilogram was split and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns. The pulveriser was cleaned 
with silica sand between samples. 
 
From each pulp, a 100-gram sub-sample was split for assay. The remainder of the pulp and the 
rejects are held at the preparation laboratory in Toronto for future reference.

The base metals of economic interest (nickel and copper), were determined using a 0.2-gram 
aliquot that was subjected to Geochemical Procedure ICP40B, (SGS internal code). This method 
uses a four-acid solution to digest the sample, followed by ICP-AES or ICP-AAS finish. 
Following discussions with SGS, the method for Ni and Cu was changed to a sodium peroxide 
fusion decomposition (ICP90Q) and analyzed by ICO-OES, as it was believed by SGS that the 
results for Ni and Cu would be more accurate with this method. The author had the site visit 
samples analyzed using 3 different methods, the results of which are presented in Section 13 of 
this report.  Little to no difference in values was observed between the 4-acid digest and the 
sodium peroxide fusion methods. 
 
Silver was digested using aqua regia (3-acid) followed by AAS. 
 
The precious metals gold, platinum and palladium, were determined using Procedure FA1323 
(SGS internal code) on a thirty-gram fire assay, followed by ICP-AES.

13.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
13.1 SITE VISIT AND INDEPENDENT SAMPLING 
 
A visit was made to the McFaulds Lake camp from April 8 to April 10, 2008. The Eagle One 
Deposit core was examined and 24 samples were taken in 15 holes by taking ¼ splits of the half 
remaining core. An effort was made to sample both the net textured and massive sulphides 
equally with a range of grades.  
 
At no time were any employees of Noront or Billiken advised as to the identification of the 
samples to be chosen during the visit.  
 
The samples were selected by the author of this section, ¼ sawn by the technician and placed by 
the author into sample bags which were sealed with tape and placed in a rice bag which was then 
placed in a plastic pail for shipping. Two certified reference materials were inserted into the 
shipment. Two pails were necessary to contain the 24 samples. 
 
The pails were loaded onto the Cessna Caravan operated by Nakina Air Services and flown to 
Thunder Bay where they were delivered by the author to Activation Laboratories ("Actlabs") for 
preparation.  From Thunder Bay the pails were picked up by Fedex Courier and delivered to the 
Ancaster Division of Actlabs for analysis. 
 
In order to estimate the Ni contained in the silicates, a 3-acid (aqua regia) digest was requested 
(3-acid will not dissolve silicates), a 4-acid digest was also requested (will dissolve silicates), as 
well as a lithium metaborate fusion which is a more aggressive digestion method. The 3 methods 
were compared as well as being compared to the original Noront assays, and the results for Ni 
are presented in Figure 13.1. The results demonstrate that 3-acid is not an appropriate method, as 
there is Ni remaining in the undigested silicates. The 4-acid and lithium metaborate fusion 
methods did not differ in their results apart from the analytical variability. Figure 13.2 presents 
the results for Cu and Figure 13.3 presents the results for combined total PGE.

13.2 NORONT QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM 
 
From drill hole NOT-07-05 and for the remainder of the drilling, a quality control (QC) program 
was set up by P&E and instituted by Noront. Holes NOT-07-01 and NOT-07-02 were not 
covered by QC and holes NOT-07-03 and 04 did not intersect mineralization. 
 
The QC program involved the insertion of two certified reference materials that monitored the 
lab accuracy on the Cu, Ni and PGE analyses, blank material comprised of sterile granodiorite 
drill core and field (1/4 core), coarse reject and pulp duplicates.  
 
The QC monitoring was done on a real-time basis, that is, as the lab certificates were received, 
the QC data were graphed to ensure results were accurate as defined by a strict protocol 
determined between the author of this section and the labs. It is to be noted that likely due to the 
labs' overextended capacity there were problems with the QC in that the certified reference 
materials were often not meeting the required norms. This problem was noted and dealt with on a 
real-time basis and work orders were rerun as required. Once the data were shown to have passed 
the QC, they were transferred to the Master database. All of the data in the Master database met 
the QC requirements. 
 
It is the author's opinion that the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures were 
satisfactory.

14.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
Since the Eagle One Deposit discovery in September 2007, interest in the area has increased 
tremendously, resulting in the entire arcuate shaped "Ring of Fire" having been staked in the past 
11 months.  
 
Noront's land position in the "Ring of Fire" includes the Double Eagle Property, 11 additional 
joint ventures (of which Noront is operator of 9), and 3 floating blocks of claims that lie within 
the Ring of Fire but are not contiguous to any other defined property package.  
 
The Double Eagle Property alone covers over 41,000 hectares of land, and with the addition of 
the joint venture claims, the area in which Noront is implicated is increased greatly, see Figure 
14.1.  
 
Deposit types such as VMS (McFaulds No. 1 and No. 3), MMS, (Noront's Eagle One and Eagle 
Two), Chromite (Noront's Blackbird One and Two), and diamonds (Kyle kimberlite pipes) are 
all known to occur. The Metalex /WSR joint venture intersected VMS –style mineralization in 
May in the "Ring of Fire" and at the time of writing, assays were still pending. The author has 
not verified the mineralization outside the Double Eagle Property and the reader is cautioned that 
mineralization on properties adjacent to the Double Eagle Property is not necessarily indicative 
of mineralization on the Double Eagle Property. 
 
An important aspect in defining a metal district is that there exist many different styles of 
mineralization and metals throughout the belt occurring in varying rock types. This is the case 
for the Abitibi Greenstone Belt in which there are gold and base metal deposits in rocks varying 
from gold in ultramafics (Dunite Sill at Sigma II deposit) to gold and base metals in VMS-style 
intermediate to felsic rocks, (Bousquet Camp: (Laronde Mine, Bousquet I and II Mines), 
Noranda Camp), to gold in mafic volcanic and granodiorite to diorite intrusions (Sigma and 
Lamaque Mines). The Dome Mine in Timmins is hosted largely by sedimentary conglomerates 
as well as mafic and felsic rocks. These are to name but a few examples. 
 
It is the author's opinion that this new metal district, the currently known deposits in the Ring of 
Fire, and Noront's vast land position make the adjacent properties a significant upside to the 
Double Eagle Property.

16.0 MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
16.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The purpose of this report section is to delineate the Eagle One Deposit Resources in compliance 
with NI 43-101 and CIM standards. This resource estimate was undertaken by Eugene Puritch, 
P.Eng. and Antoine Yassa, P.Geo. of P & E Mining Consultants Inc. of Brampton Ontario, who 
are the independent Qualified Persons within the meaning of NI 43-101. The effective date of 
this resource estimate is July 3, 2008. 
 
16.2 DATABASE 
 
All drilling data were provided by Noront in the form of a Microsoft Access database, Excel 
files, drill logs and assay certificates.  Seven (7) drill cross sections were developed on a local 
grid looking north on a 25 metre spacing named from 3525-N to 3675-N.  A Gemcom database 
was provided by Noront containing 29 diamond drill holes of which 23 were utilized in the 
resource calculation. The remaining data were not in the area that was modeled for this resource 
estimate.  A surface drillhole plan is shown in Appendix I. 
 
The database was validated in Gemcom with minor corrections required.  The assay table of the 
database contained 1,238 assays for Ni, Cu, Pt, Pd, Au and Ag.  All data are expressed in metric 
units and grid coordinates are in the NAD83 UTM system. 
 
16.3 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
Verification of assay data entry was performed on 1,182 assay intervals for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt 
and Pd.  A few very minor discrepancies were observed and related to averaging multiple results 
and determination of values below detection limits. No corrections were required. The 1,182 
intervals were verified against digital assay lab certificates from ALS Chemex and SGS Mineral 
Services.  The verified assays represented 96% of the data to be used for the resource estimate 
and approximately 95% of the entire database.  
 
16.4 DOMAIN INTERPRETATION 
 
Domain boundaries were determined from lithology, structure and NSR boundary interpretation 
from visual inspection of drill hole sections.  Two domains were developed, named Massive in 
the core of the deposit and Disseminated surrounding the Massive domain. These domains were 
physically created with computer screen digitizing on drill hole sections in Gemcom by the 
authors of this report.  The outlines were influenced by the selection of mineralized material that 
demonstrated massive and disseminated mineralization characteristics, and zonal continuity 
along strike and down dip.  In a very few cases, some mineralization below characteristic grades 
was included for the purpose of maintaining zonal continuity. Smoothing was utilized to remove 
obvious jogs and dips in the domains and incorporated a minor addition of Inferred 
mineralization. This exercise allowed for easier domain creation without triangulation errors 
from solids validation. 
 
On each section, polyline interpretations were digitized from drill hole to drill hole but not 
extended more than 25 metres into untested territory. Minimum constrained true width for 
interpretation was 2.0 metres. The interpreted polylines from each section were "wireframed" in

Eagle One Report No. 149 

Gemcom into a 3-dimensional domain.  The resulting solids (domains) were used for statistical 
analysis, grade interpolation, rock coding and resource reporting purposes.  See Appendix II. 
 
16.5 ROCK CODE DETERMINATION 
 
The rock codes used for the resource model were derived from the two mineralized domain 
solids and are listed below: 
 
Rock Code Description  
 
0 Air  
10 Massive Sulphide Domain 
20 Disseminated Domain  
99  Waste Rock 
 
16.6 COMPOSITES  
 
Length weighted composites were generated for the drill hole data that fell within the constraints 
of the above-mentioned domains.  These composites were calculated for Ni, Cu, Pt, Pd, Au and 
Ag over 1.5 metre lengths starting at the first point of intersection between assay data hole and 
hanging wall of the 3-D zonal constraint. The compositing process was halted upon exit from the 
footwall of the aforementioned constraint. Un-assayed intervals were treated as null data. Any 
composites calculated that were less than 0.5 metres in length, were discarded so as to not 
introduce a short sample bias in the interpolation process. The composite data were transferred to 
Gemcom extraction files for the grade interpolation as X, Y, Z, Ni, Cu, Pt, Pd, Au and Ag files. 
 
16.7 GRADE CAPPING 
 
Grade capping was investigated on the raw assay values in the combined domains to ensure that 
the possible influence of erratic high values did not bias the database. Extraction files were 
created for constrained Ni, Cu, Pt, Pd, Au and Ag data within each mineralized domain. From 
these extraction files, log-normal histograms were generated. Refer to Appendix III for graphs.

16.8 VARIOGRAPHY  
 
Variography was carried out on the constrained domain composites within the domains of the 
deposit model. The Disseminated domain composites allowed the generation of reasonable 
omnivariograms and down dip variograms. The Massive Sulphide domain consisted of 
populations too small to yield discernable variograms. The search ranges from the Disseminated 
domain variography were applied to the Massive Sulphide domain. See Appendix IV. 
 
16.9 BULK DENSITY 
 
The bulk density used for the resource model was derived from measurements of bulk density 
test work performed on drill core by Noront, as well as 22 samples done on drill core by ALS 
Chemex Labs with the same samples done on pulps using a pycnometer. A total of 71 values 
were used, which represented all the Massive and Disseminated domains. The bulk density block 
model was coded with a simple spherical interpolation pass. The resulting average bulk densities 
within the constraining domains utilizing these samples were calculated to be 4.34 tonnes/m3 for 
massive sulphides and 2.98 tonnes /m3 for disseminated sulphides.  
 
16.10 BLOCK MODELING 
 
The resource model was divided into a 3D block model framework. The block model has 
720,000 blocks that were 5m in the X direction, 5m in the Y direction and 5m in the Z direction. 
There were 100 columns (X), 120 rows (Y) and 60 levels (Z). The block model was rotated 20 
degrees clockwise.  Separate block models were created for rock type, density, percent, Ni, Cu, 
Pt, Pd, Au, Ag and NSR.  
 
The percent block model was set up to accurately represent the volume and subsequent tonnage 
that was occupied by each block inside each constraining domain. As a result, the domain 
boundaries were properly represented by the percent model ability to measure infinitely variable 
inclusion percentages within a particular domain. 
 
The Ni, Cu, Pt, Pd, Au and Ag composites were extracted from the Microsoft Access database 
composite table into separate files for each Mineralized Zone.  Inverse distance squared (1/d2) 
grade interpolation was utilized. There were two interpolation passes performed on the massive 
and disseminated domains for each element for the Indicated and Inferred classifications. The 
resulting Ni, Cu, and NSR blocks can be seen on the block model cross-sections and plans in 
Appendix V and VI.  The grade blocks within the domains were interpolated using the following 
parameters:

16.11 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
 
For the purposes of this resource, classifications of all interpolated grade blocks were determined 
from the Ni grade interpolations for Indicated and Inferred due to Ni being the dominant revenue 
producing element in the NSR calculation. See block model classification cross-sections and 
plans in Appendix VII and VIII.  
 
16.12 RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
The resource estimate was derived from applying an NSR cut-off grade to the block model and 
reporting the resulting tonnes and grade for potentially mineable areas. The following 
calculations demonstrate the rationale supporting the NSR cut-off grade that determines the 
potentially economic portion of the mineralized domains.

The above data were derived from similar studies on other Ni-Cu-PGE deposits.  

 
In the anticipated underground operation of the Eagle One Deposit, the mining, processing and 
G&A costs combine for a total of ($60 + $30 + $25) = $115/tonne milled which became the NSR 
cut-off value.

(1) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  Estimated 

mining costs, metallurgical recoveries and project infrastructure costs in this report may materially affect 
this resource estimate due to those components not being studied in sufficient detail to accurately predict 
their realized values.  The estimate of mineral resources may also be materially affected by environmental, 
permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues.  There is no guarantee 
that Noront will be successful in obtaining any or all of the requisite consents, permits or approvals, 
regulatory or otherwise for the project or that the project will be placed into production. 

 
(2) The quantity and grade of reported Inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there 

has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred resources as an Indicated or Measured mineral 
resource and further exploration drilling is required to determine whether they can be upgraded to an 
Indicated or Measured mineral resource category. 

  
It should be noted that the mineral resources in this estimate were calculated using the Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and 
Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve 
Definitions and adopted by CIM Council December 11, 2005. 
 
16.13 CONFIRMATION OF ESTIMATE 
 
As a test of the reasonableness of the estimate, the block model was queried at a 0.01 % Ni cut 
off grade with blocks in all classifications summed and their grades weight averaged. This 
average is the average grade of all blocks within the mineralized domains. The values of the 
interpolated grades for the block model were compared to the length weighted capped average 
grades and average grade of composites of all samples from within the domains. The results are 
presented below:

17.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
A petrographic study was undertaken by M.A. McKeough on drill core from holes NOT-07-01 
and NOT-07-02, (prior to the intersection of drillhole NOT-07-05 and an understanding that a 
deposit had been discovered). Seven samples were collected from NOT-07-02 and one sample 
from NOT-07-01.  
 
The eight polished thin sections and cut samples were investigated by transmitted and reflected 
light microscopy and followed up on with electron microprobe analysis in order to identify the 
host rocks to the sulphide mineralization and unravel the host rock alteration.  
 
The conclusions were that most of the sections were peridotites, apart from one interval in NOT-
07-02 that was found to be a granodiorite. Certain textural and alteration features, as well as a 
high concentration of MgO may suggest that the rocks were mantle derived igneous rocks, 
(otherwise known as komatiitic flows or peridotitic intrusions).  
 
The samples had undergone extreme, low temperature hydrothermal alteration which produced 
serpentinized olivine cumulates as well as two phases of chlorite alteration: 1) phlogopite-
tremolite-chlorite (Mg-rich) and 2), serpentine-chlorite (non Mg-rich).  
 
The sulphides demonstrated both net-texture and massive texture. In spite of the different 
textures, they both showed the same appearances of coarse-grained and fractured pentlandite 
with finely disseminated and blebby chalcopyrite in a coarse-grained pyrrhotite matrix.  
 
The sulphides appeared not to have been affected by the extreme metamorphism and low 
temperature alteration seen in the gangue minerals. However pentlandite displayed some 
alteration in fractures, seen with the presence of violarite (<1% in a section but perhaps present 
in others) and can perhaps be attributed to the hydrothermal alteration the rocks have undergone.

18.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
18.1 CONCLUSIONS 
 
The Eagle One Ni-Cu-PGE Deposit is comprised of a massive sulphide core containing high 
grade Ni-Cu-PGE values, surrounded by lower grade net textured sulphides. The large amounts 
of sulphide and ultramafic cumulate make it clear that it formed in a magmatic conduit which is 
likely continuous over considerable distances, (likely measurable in kilometres).  Diamond 
drilling has shown that the deposit is surrounded on all sides by older felsic intrusive rocks. 
continue at depth.  The prospects for continued extension of the mineralized body to depth are 
excellent, as long as it is not lost in a fault zone. Although the western margin has been 
extensively modified by faulting, it is fundamentally an intrusive contact that is preserved in situ 
and there is no immediate indication of a structural termination of the mineralization.   
 
In addition to the Eagle One Deposit, Noront has also discovered, two kilometres south-west, the 
Blackbird One Chromite Deposit, the Eagle Two shear-hosted Ni-Cu-PGE deposit (collectively 
also known as the AT2 anomaly) and most recently the Blackbird Two Chromite Occurrence. 
Each one remains to be defined in detail. At the time of writing of this report, two drill holes had 
been completed on Anomaly AT12, which returned encouraging widths of visual copper-nickel-
iron sulphide mineralization up to 29.2 metres in peridotite host rock. Assays are pending. There 
are also many more geophysical anomalies which remain to be tested on the Double Eagle 
Property claims surrounding the Eagle One Deposit.  
 
18.2 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
A total budget of $12,300,000 is recommended to follow up at Eagle One, and to continue 
defining and delineating the other deposits on the property such as Eagle Two, Blackbird One 
and Two, as well as other geophysical anomalies. The authors feel that the large budget is 
warranted, given that the project is now entering a predevelopment stage and will require 
considerable infrastructure upgrades and advanced studies in order to proceed to the next level. 
In addition, geophysical indications are that the Ring of Fire Intrusion continues across the entire 
Double Eagle Property, and that Noront has continued success at intersecting mineralization in 
areas several kilometres from the Eagle One Deposit.  
 
For the Eagle One Deposit, the following recommendations are made: 

• Continue diamond drilling to potentially upgrade resource categories and extend the 
deposit at depth; 

• Complete a preliminary economic assessment (scoping study). 
A budget of $3,500,000 is allotted for this work. 
 
For the Eagle Two and Blackbird One Deposits, the following recommendations are made: 

• Delineation diamond drilling for the purposes of an initial resource estimate; 
• NI 43-101 compliant resource estimates on Eagle Two and Blackbird One. 

A budget of $2,150,000 is allotted for this work. 
 
For the Blackbird Two Chromite Occurrence, continued exploration diamond drilling is 
recommended.  A budget of $1,050,000 is allotted for this work. 
 
For the AT12 anomaly continued exploration diamond drilling is recommended. The budget 
allotted for this work is $875,000. 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 57 of 119 
Eagle One Report No. 149 

For the remainder of the Double Eagle Property, the following recommendations are made: 
• Follow up on the defined airborne anomalies with ground geophysics; 
• Diamond drilling to test best targets. 

A budget of $1,800,000 is allotted for this work. 
 
These programs should be undertaken concurrently in as much as the manpower and equipment 
allow.  
 
In addition to the exploration work, it is recommended to construct a semi-permanent airstrip, as 
the current one is on McFaulds Lake which necessitates skis in the winter, floats in the summer 
and during spring break-up is not accessible. Currently the camp houses temporary facilities and 
a new camp more appropriately sized to house the large numbers of people should be built. A 
budget of $1,750,000 should be allotted for this. The proposed budget is presented in Table 18-1.
