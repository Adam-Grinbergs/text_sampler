SOLUMINES 3 

e)  I have visited the property several times since October 2007.  These visits are described in 

detail as follows: 

• I visited the property in company of Jacques Brunelle, President of Knick, on October 17, 

2007, and spent about one day.  The visit occurred in two steps.  The first one consisted of 

the field visit of the property.  The second one was a visit to 1018, 7ième rue, Val-d'Or, where 

sections of core from historical holes CD-175 and 177 were stored;  

• On July 15, 2009, I observed the recently-drilled core, accompanied by Robert Campbell, a 

geologist employed by Knick.  This drill core was stored at the Knick exploration office, 

located at 536, 3ième Avenue, Val-d'Or, Québec. 

• On November 17, 2009, I visited the East-West property accompanied by Gordon Henriksen, 

geologist, Vice President of Knick, and Robert Campbell, geologist, and observed the recent 

stripping and the diamond drilling on the East zone.  About three hours were required for this 

visit. 

• Another visit occurred on May 7, 2010, and took about four hours.  I observed several drill 

sites on both the East zone and the West zone and on the stripped area.  About two hours 

were spent verifying the most significant drill core.  During this visit, I was accompanied by 

Gordon Henriksen and Robert Campbell. 

• Yet another visit took place on July 7, 2011, and lasted about half a day.  Many drill sites 

witnessing holes drilled in 2011 were inspected.  The field inspection was followed by the 

observation of the main mineralized zones intersected and stored at this time at the Knick's 

office in Val d'Or.  During this visit, the author was accompanied by Gordon Henriksen Vice-

President for Knick, and Robert Campbell, geologist.  

 

f)  I am responsible for all the sections of the technical report;

SOLUMINES 9 

1.0) SUMMARY 
 

The East-West property held by Knick Exploration Inc. ("Knick") is made up of one block of seven 

claims totalling 184 ha.  These claims are located in Dubuisson Township and cover lots 21, 22 and 23 

in range 10, lots 11, 12 and 13 in range A and lot 11 in range B. The property is easily accessible from 

Val-d'Or via provincial highway 117 and Chemin des Lacs, the latter being located about 1.2 km east of 

the village of Dubuisson. 

 

Exploration work in the amount of $13,000 will be required to keep the claims in good standing for the 

next claims renewals, which are due between May 24, 2015, and August 7, 2015.  However, more than 

$3M in exploration work is already registered on the claims.  Mining duties amount to $300.25.  

 

The mining rights of the property are 100% held by Knick Exploration Inc., with a 3.5% NSR royalty 

payable to a 9101-2310 Québec Inc.  This NSR may be bought back at any time for a total 

amount of $3,500,000, as follows: 

• The first 1% for an amount of $500,000; 

• The second 1% for $1,500,000; and, finally, 

• The last 1.5% for $1,500,000. 

 

To the knowledge of the author, there are no environmental liabilities pertaining to the East-West 

property.  The only permit required to carry out exploration on the property is the usual forestry 

management permit.  Because the surface rights are owned by landowners, Knick has negotiated a 

right of way with the landowners, and the agreements have been registered in a legal document.  This 

right of way allows Knick to carry out the usual exploration work, ranging from line cutting to diamond 

drilling.  

 

The area shows a relatively flat topography.  The property is covered by abandoned farmland that has 

been colonized by alders.  There is no mining infrastructure on the property, but it is crossed by a 

railroad and provincial highway 117.  The property is bordered on the east side by Lake DeMontagny 

and on the west side by the claims of the old Marban mine. 

 

Since 1935, many magnetic and VLF1 surveys have been done, followed by IP2 surveying.  Historical 

drilling totalling more than 41,000 m in 180 holes was done, mainly since 1980.  More than 90% of the 

holes were drilled on the northern part of the property.  Historically, the most active mining company

was Cache d'Or, with approximately 39,600 m drilled on lots 21 to 23, range 10, on the north part of the 

property.   

 

From a geological standpoint, the East-West property is underlain from north to south by the Jacola, 

Héva Formation and the Kewagama Group.  Almost all the mineralized zones discovered on the 

property are associated with the Jacola Formation, located in the northern part of the property. 

 

Several gold zones have been discovered on the property, the main ones being West and East, located 

by historical and Knick drilling.  Recently, stripping by Knick unveiled three new gold zones, namely 

Raven, Gilbert and Grand Canyon. The West zone is made up of a network of quartz-ankerite-

tourmaline veins inside intermediate-to-mafic lavas, encased in ultramafic flows.  The East zone is 

made up of quartz-carbonates veins, locally associated with one or more breccias.  The geology of the 

West zone shows similarities with the Marban mine geology.  The East zone geology can be associated 

with the geology of the Kiena mine.   

 

On the West zone, the best gold grade obtained was 1,154.67 g/t Au over 0.10 m, or 7.5 cm true width.  

This sample contained visible gold. While spectacular results are sometimes obtained, the usual gold 

values cut on the West zone are in the order of 2 to 3 g/t Au over true widths of less than 1 m.   On the 

East zone, 12 holes returned values of over 1 g/t Au.  The best intersection was obtained in Hole LEO-

09-32, with 37.13 g/t Au over 0.3 m, or about 25 cm true width.  As on the West zone, the gold grade is 

usually around 2-3 g/t Au over a true width of less than 1 m.  On the stripped zones, maximum gold 

values returned are as follows: Raven: 38.26 g/t over 0.5 m, Gilbert: 41.8 g/t over 0.5 m, Grand 

Canyon: 5.97 g/t over 0.37 m, all in channel samples. All the stripped areas are located in east part of 

the property, close to the East zone. 

 

From January 1, 2009, to May 2010, Knick completed 22.6 km of line cutting and 19 km of magnetic 

and VLF surveying followed by 10.8 km of IP and 3D hole-to-hole IP surveying,  stripping close to the 

East zone and, finally, 71 holes totalling 12,864 m drilled on the West zone, East and Raven zones and 

to test IP anomalies.   

 

The magnetic and VLF surveys outlined the Jacola / Héva contact.  The IP survey delineated a wide 

east-west striking resistivity corridor containing IP anomalies that for the most part showed a shallow 

source.  Several isolated IP and other anomalies where the polarisable metallic mineralization may lie 

deeper were located in the same corridor.  The hole-to-hole IP survey located at least six untested 

anomalies.

SOLUMINES 11 

Following the prospecting program, a sub-outcropping area in the eastern part of the property close to 

the East zone was stripped.  At least three new showings, Raven, Gilbert and Grand Canyon, were 

identified, the main one being the Raven zone, which extends more than 200 m in an ENE direction.  

Gilbert and Grand Canyon are located 125 m and 90 m south of the Raven zone, respectively.  In each 

stripped area, gold mineralization is included in quartz veins associated with shear zones.  On Raven, 

quartz veins are located on each side of a gabbroic sill in contact with a quartz feldspar porphyry (QFP) 

to the north and a dacite to the south.  On Gilbert and Grand Canyon, the quartz veins are included in 

intermediate volcanics.   

 

Knick drilled 38 holes for a total of 7,228.9 m in 2009 and another 33 holes for a total of 5,635.4 m two 

years later.  Eleven of these were drilled on the West zone, 19 on the East zone, and 41 on the three 

gold showings and IP anomalies and/or lateral extensions of known gold zones.  On the West, East and 

stripped zones, visible gold was sporadically observed as small specks of free gold in quartz veins and 

at the edges of sulphide crystals.  Many samples returned values of greater than 1 g/t Au over core 

lengths of 0.1 to 1.45 m.  Because of the dip of the auriferous quartz veins relative to the dip of the drill 

holes, true width can be estimated at about 75% of the core length.  

 

The sampling method was based on the mineralization intercepted, with maximum sample width usually 

limited to 1.5 m.  Walls of the mineralized intersections were sampled over width of 0.5 to 1.5 m.  

During the sampling, blanks and standards were inserted at every 25 samples.  We generally observe 

that the laboratory slightly underestimated the gold content.  Check assays were performed on 7%, of 

the reject from the 2011 drilling program by Agat Laboratories.  Check assays confirmed the high 

quality of the assays done by Laboratoire Expert of Rouyn-Noranda. 

 

The author has verified the geological description of the samples and the drill core stored by Knick.  

Many drill sites were also visited and the data recorded on the drill logs was confirmed.  The author's 

observations confirm that the exploration work reported by Knick is real and was carried out in 

accordance with standard industry practice. 

 

Until now, the West zone has been explored to a depth of 200 m.  Drill holes 300 to 500 m in 

length will be required to test its gold potential below 200 m and try to outline minable resources.  

Further exploration work should be done on the East zone.  Stripping done in 2009-2010 

revealed gold-bearing quartz veins with grades of up to 38.2 g/t Au over 0.5 m in channel 

samples.  Holes drilled to test outcropping gold-bearing zones at depth have shown geological 

continuity to a depth of at least 100 m.  More drilling will be required to more precisely define the 

geometry and structure controlling the gold mineralization.   



Knick Exploration Inc,               NI 43-101 Technical Report, East-West Property 

SOLUMINES 12 

 

In light of the results obtained so far, it is highly recommended that exploration work on the property 

resume, with emphasis on the West, East and Raven zones, where gold values have already been 

discovered. 

 

For Phase 1, preparation of a 3D model of the geology and the mineralized zones on the property is 

recommended to help visualize the various gold zones.  Once established, the model should be kept up 

to date with new drill results.  More specifically, approximately 8,000 m drilling is recommended on the 

West zone on a 50-m pattern, laterally and vertically, to a depth of 1,000 m, to try to extend the 

mineralized area both laterally and at depth.  The same philosophy applies to the East and Raven 

zones, with 12,000 m of drilling on a 50-m pattern to a depth of 1,000 m, to extend the mineralized zone 

laterally and at depth. 

 

Phase 2: If the results from Phase I are encouraging enough, drilling on a tighter, 25-m pattern is 

recommended on the most promising zones, as well as a resource estimate, if deemed warranted.  The 

budget for both phases is given below.

qualified person responsible for all the sections of this technical report.  

 

2.4) Scope of the Personal Inspection by the Qualified Person 

 

The author has visited the property several times since October 2007.  These visits are described in 

detail as follows: 

• The author visited the property in company of Jacques Brunelle, President of Knick, on October 17, 

2007, and spent about one day.  The visit occurred in two steps.  The first one consisted of the field 

visit of the property.  The second one was a visit to 1018, 7ième rue, Val-d'Or, where sections of core 

from historical holes CD-175 and 177 were stored;

SOLUMINES 15 

• On July 15, 2009, the author observed the recently-drilled core, accompanied by Robert Campbell, 

geologist, employed by Knick.  This drill core was store at the Knick exploration office, located at 

536, 3ième Avenue, Val-d'Or, Québec. 

• On November 17, 2009, the author visited the East-West property accompanied by Gordon 

Henriksen, geologist, Vice President of Knick, and Robert Campbell, geologist, and observed the 

recent stripping and diamond drilling on the East zone.  About three hours were required for this 

visit. 

• Another visit occurred on May 7, 2010, and took about four hours.  The author observed several drill 

sites on both the East zone and the West zone and on the stripped area.  About two hours were 

spent verifying the most significant drill core.  During this visit, the author was accompanied by 

Gordon Henriksen and Robert Campbell. 

• Yet another visit took place on July 7, 2011, and lasted about half a day.  Many drill sites witnessing 

holes drilled in 2011 were inspected.  The field inspection was followed by the observation of the 

main mineralized zones intersected and stored at this time at the Knick's office in Val-d'Or.  During 

this visit, the author was accompanied by Gordon Henriksen, Vice President for Knick, and Robert 

Campbell, geologist.

4.4) Nature and Extent of the Issuer's Titles 

 

The issuer holds a 100% interest in the mining rights of the property.  However, the surface rights are 

held by landowners.  This situation applies to all the claims of the property.  All the conditions to be met 

for next renewal are indicated in Table 1.  To summarize, $300.25 will be due as mining duties, $13,000 

in exploration work is required for the next renewals, which take place between May 24, 2015, and 

August 07, 2015.  On the other hand, $3,040,073 in exploration work is already accumulated on the 

claims.  On May 17, 2013, a report on $626,535 in exploration work was filed with the MRNFQ.

4.5) Property Boundaries 

 

Claims 3481181, 3828431 and 3828432 form the northern part of the property.  They were surveyed by 

Jean-Luc Corriveau, land-surveyor, and reported on a map dated January 15, 1987, with file number C-

30701276.  The other claims have not been surveyed, but their position is determined by the land 

registry, because the claims correspond to lots of Dubuisson Township.  Correlation between the claims 

and the lots is indicated in Table 2 below.

4.6) Agreements and Royalties 

The mining rights of the East West property are 100% held by Knick Exploration Inc.  Knick 

originally acquired the property from 9101-2310 Québec Inc. on October 24, 2007, on the 

following terms: 

• $60,000 cash and 3,000,000 common shares of Knick, paid on signature of the agreement; 

• 9101-2310 Québec Inc. remains entitled to a 3.5% NSR royalty.  This NSR may be bought 

back at any time for a total amount of $3,500,000, as follows: 

- The first 1% for an amount of $500,000; 

- The second 1% for $1,500,000; and, finally, 

- The last 1.5% for $1,500,000. 

 

In 2008, the property was called the Dubuisson property, and all the shares of Knick Resources Inc. 

were transferred to a capital pool company called Ophiravencap Inc.  At the end of December 2008, 

following the closing of the qualifying transaction, the Dubuisson property was renamed East-West and 

Ophiravencap changed its name to Knick Exploration Inc.

4.7) Environmental Liabilities 

 

To the knowledge of the author, there are no environmental liabilities pertaining to the East-West 

property.  

 

4.8) Required Permits 

 

The only required permit is the usual forestry management permit that must be obtained to undertake 

forestry work.  However, in the case of the East-West property, as the surface rights are not own by the 

crown but by landowners, a right of way must be obtained, accompanied by permission to carry out 

exploration work (line cutting, geophysical surveys, diamond drilling).  Knick has negotiated such rights 

with the landowners and the undertakings have been recorded in a legal document.  

 

4.9) Risk Factors  

 

To the knowledge of the author, there are no undisclosed risk factors that might affect the exploration or 

mining on the East-West property. 

 

5.0) ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURES AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 

5.1) Topography, Elevation, Vegetation and Drainage 

 

The property is located at an average elevation of 310 m above sea level.  The topography of the area 

is almost flat.  GPS data obtained during the field visit shows a maximum elevation difference of 10 m.  

Vegetation consists of abandoned farmland that has been colonized by alders and crisscrossed by 

wooded areas of pine, birch and spruce. 

 

5.2) Accessibility 

 

The property is located about 11 km west of the town of Val-d'Or, or 1.2 km west of the village of 

Dubuisson.  A railroad and provincial highway 117 cross the claims forming the southern part of the 



Knick Exploration Inc,               NI 43-101 Technical Report, East-West Property 

SOLUMINES 21 

property in an east-west direction.  The northern part of the claims is bounded to the east by Lake 

DeMontigny.   

 

The property is easily accessible from the town of Val-d'Or via provincial highway 117 westward, and 

approximately 1.5 km west of the village of Dubuisson via the Chemin des Lacs going north to access 

the NW part of the property.  

 

The NE part of the property is accessible using a private road starting from Route 117 at UTM 

coordinates 279 680E /5 333 746N.  The southern part of the property is accessible using roads located 

on private land.  Property accessibility and topography are illustrated in Figure 1, "Location Map", and 

Figure 3, "Topography and Access". 

 

5.3) Infrastructure 

 

As this is a mining exploration project, the acquisition of the land that might be necessary in the event of 

a mining operation has not been negotiated with the landowners.  In the event of a mining operation, 

services and personnel will be available in the nearby town of Val-d'Or, which is known as a major 

mining centre.  Furthermore, a powerline crosses the property in an east-west direction, and the water 

required for a mining complex can be pumped directly from Lake DeMontigny.  In conclusion, no major 

or particular problems are anticipated if a mine were to be developed on the property. 

 

5.4) Climate 

 

Climate is characterized by long, cold winters and short, cool summers.  The average temperature for 

the years 1971 to 2000 was -17ºC in January and +17ºC in July.  Important temperature differences 

have been observed, with an extreme daily maximum temperature of +9.7ºC and an extreme minimum 

of -44ºC for January.  The same temperature differences have been observed in July, with an extreme 

daily maximum of +36ºC and an extreme daily minimum of -0.1ºC.

6.0) HISTORY 
 

Up until the end of the 1990's, exploration work was carried out separately on the northern and 

southern parts of the property.  For the purposes of this report, the histories of the northern and 

southern parts of the property will be described separately.  

 

The southern part of the property is made up of claims 5076215 and 5075734-36, covering lot 11, 

range B, and lots 11, 12 and 13, range A.  The northern part is made up of claims 3828431, 32 and 

3481181, which cover lots 21, 22 and 23, range 10.  

 

Southern Part: 

 

The first exploration work carried out on the south part of the property dates back to 1937.  From this 

time until the beginning of the 70's, little exploration work is reported, with magnetic prospection by 

Dubuisson Goldfields in 1937, followed by a geological report by Norman Malartic Mines in 1945.  

During the next 16 years, no exploration was reported.  

 

In 1961 and 1962, two other magnetic surveys were conducted by Ambassador Mining Development 

and Dubuisson Goldfields.  Nothing happened from 1962 until 1970, when a new magnetic survey was 

reported by Gold Resources.  Finally, in 1976, three holes totalling 1,668 feet were drilled by Babylon 

Minerals, but no significant gold grades were reported. 

 

From 1980 to 1984, the mining titles were registered in the name of Rénald Garneau.  Magnetic and 

VLF4 surveys followed by an evaluation report were completed at that time.  In 1988, the claims were 

registered in the name of Black Cliff Mines.  Magnetic, VLF and IP surveys were reported, followed by 

one 552-foot drill hole.  Here again, no significant gold grades were reported.  In 1989, the claims were 

optioned by Malartic Hygrade Gold Mines, and four holes totalling 2,163 feet were drilled.  Again, no 

significant gold grades were reported. 

 

In 1993, the claims appear under the name of Alain Guy Garneau.  Nine kilometres of Mag survey were 

reported.  From 1993 to December 31, 2008, no exploration work was recorded.

SOLUMINES 24 

Northern Part: 

 

From 1933 to 1940, the northern part of the property was held by West Shore Malartic Gold Mines.  

Trenches were dug in the eastern part of the property.  A 750-foot long shear zone striking 070º was 

discovered, and anomalous gold values were reported. 

 

In 1945-1956, Clarnor Malartic Mines took an option on the claims.  Eleven holes were drilled, five of 

them on part of a stratigraphic section in the eastern part of the property.  The best gold grade cut at 

that time was 0.41 oz/t Au over 1.8 feet. 

 

In 1959, the property was part of a large claim block held by Little Long Lac.  A program of geophysical 

surveys was completed.  Holes were drilled on lots 17 and 18, outside the East-West property.  In 

1974-1975, the property was known as the Audet option.  Three holes totalling 1,668 feet were drilled 

by Babylon Minerals, but no significant gold grades were obtained.  In 1979, the three claims 

corresponding to lots 21, 22 and 23, range 10, were known as the Arnold James property, and in 1980 

they were optioned by Auguste Mitto and William Plexman, who sold them to Ressources Cache d'Or. 

 

From 1981 to 1987, Ressources Cache d'Or completed magnetic and VLF surveys followed by 184 drill 

holes totalling approximately 130,000 feet.  Drill hole technical data and results greater than 0.05 oz/t 

Au were compiled and are reported in Schedule 1.  Gold grades as high as 2.11 oz/t Au over a core 

length of 10.5 feet were obtained in Hole CD-55.  At the beginning of the 1990s, Ressources Cache 

d'Or became Exploration Auriginor Inc. 

 

To date, no resources have been estimated and no production has taken place on the East-West 

property.

7.0) GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 

7.1) Regional, Local and Property Geology 

 

The East-West property is located in Archean-age rock formations that are part of the Abitibi 

greenstone belt, which lies within the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield.  The property is 

underlain from north to south by the Jacola and Héva formations and the Kewagama Group.  Contacts 

between the lithological units are generally faulted and oriented NW-SE, with sub-vertical dips and tops 

toward the south. 

 

The Jacola Formation covers approximately the NE half of lots 21 to 23, range 10.  It is made of 

ultramafic flows (komatiites) and basalts.  Ultramafic flows are Al2O3 poor, with an average of 5 to 7%, 

and magnesium rich (+20% MgO).  Basalts are of tholeiitic affinity.  The Marbenite fault, which is 



Knick Exploration Inc,               NI 43-101 Technical Report, East-West Property 

SOLUMINES 26 

associated with the Marban mine, is located less than 1 km NE of the property and crosses the Jacola 

Formation on the property, about 100 m north of the Jacola/Héva Formations. 

 

The Héva Formation is made up of mafic to intermediate volcanics.  These usually form massive flows 

but can be locally pillowed or brecciated.  They are similar to those of the Jacola Formation.  These 

basalts and andesites are often sheared.  They are stratified with units of mafic to intermediate tuffs and 

cut by many intrusives. 

 

The Kewagama Sedimentary Group underlies the southern part of the property.  These sediments are 

made up of an interlayering of siltstone and argillaceous schist.  They are often aphanitic.  Figure 4 

shows the regional geology and gold deposits of the area.  

 

The mineralized zones known of to date on the property are all located in the Jacola Formation, which 

also contains the Marban and Kiena mines, located to the NW and SE of the East-West property 

respectively.  This formation has a spectacular magnetic signature on the airborne total field map, as 

illustrated by Figure 5.  Figure 6 shows the geological setting of the property. 

 

Mineralization is often associated with networks of quartz-tourmaline-ankerite veins in competent 

basalts/andesites associated with less competent sheared and altered ultramafic flows.  Mineralization 

is in the form of free gold, specks of gold being observed in the drill core.  There are not many 

sulphides, with pyrite content usually varying from 0 to 5%. Chalcopyrite is rarely observed.  No study 

has been done to verify whether a certain amount of gold is associated with the sulphides. 

 

It is important to note that historically, visible gold was sometimes observed, but with negative gold 

results in the assays.  At the time, no re-checks were done using a metallic sieve.5  Since Knick began 

exploring the property, all samples containing free gold are systematically analyzed by metallic sieve. 

 

7.2) Mineralized Zones 

 

Drilling has identified two main mineralized zones on the property: the East and West zones.  The West 

zone mineralization is associated with a network of quartz-ankerite-tourmaline veins, locally with 

sulphides (pyrite and pyrrhotite), in an intermediate to mafic lava, itself included in ultramafic flows.  The 

mineralized envelope of the West zone is oriented at 110º.  It is parallel to, and probably associated 

with, the Marbenite fault.  This zone is included in a 200 m x 200 m area bounded by UTM coordinates

279 100E, 279 300E, 5 335 000N and 5 335 200N.  This zone has been explored to a depth of 200 m.  

Since it acquired the property, Knick has drilled 11 holes on the West zone, six of which have returned 

gold grades of over 1 g/t Au.  The best gold grade obtained was 1,154.67 g/t Au over 0.10 m, or 7.5 cm 

true width.  This sample contained visible gold.  While spectacular results are sometimes obtained, the 

usual gold values cut on the West zone are in the order of 2 to 3 g/t Au over true widths of less than 1 

m.  This zone seems to have been well defined by Knick and historical drilling, at least to vertical depth 

of 200 m.  The gold potential is interesting but at a depth of more than 200 m, and holes 300 to 500 m 

in length will be required to test the zone at this depth. 

 

The East zone is less well defined, being less drilled.  It is made up of quart-carbonate veins, 

sometimes brecciated, containing an average of 1-5% sulphides, mainly as pyrite and pyrrhotite, and 

more rarely chalcopyrite.  It has been traced over a distance of 400 m in an east-west direction, from 

UTM coordinates 279 900E to 280 300E at 5 334 950N.  Knick drilled 19 holes in 2009 and four holes 

in 2011 on the East zone.  Twelve of these returned values of over 1 g/t Au.  The best intersection was 

obtained from Hole LEO-09-32, with 37.13 g/t Au over 0.3 m, or about 25 cm true width.  As on the 

West zone, the gold grade is usually around 2-3 g/t Au over a true width of less than 1 m.  

 

Stripping completed by Knick revealed at least three new gold zones: Raven, Gilbert and Grand 

Canyon.  Maximum gold values returned by each zone are as follows: Raven: 38.26 g/t over 0.5 m, 

Gilbert: 41.8 g/t over 0.5 m, and Grand Canyon: 5.97 g/t over 0.37 m, all in channel samples. All the 

stripped areas are located in east part of the property, close to the East zone.

SOLUMINES 31 

8.0) DEPOSIT TYPES 
 

Two geological models are considered, the first represented by the Marban mine and the second by the 

Kiena mine.  The Marban mine is located less than one kilometre from the NW boundary of the 

property, and the Kiena mine is approximately 2.5 kilometres east of the eastern edge of the property.  

 

These two mines are located in the Jacola Formation, the same formation that underlies the NE part of 

the property.  Two types of mineralization have been identified on the East-West property.  The first 

consists in a network of quartz-carbonates-tourmaline veins as seen in the West zone;  this zone shows 

many similarities with the Marban mine, which is located in mildly sheared basalts intruded by veinlets 

of quartz-carbonates, and variable amounts of pyrite-pyrrhotite. The second is of the Kiena mine type.  

In a report for Ressources Cache d'Or, Jaman Patel, geologist, made the following comments regarding 

the NE part of the property on parts of lots 21, 22 and 23, range 10: "In the East zone, a total of four drill 

holes intersected free gold, the two holes had fine specks which failed to show up in the assays.  The 

mineralized zone or vein is a breccia vein and it somewhat resembles the Kiena type mineralization, 

except there was very little sulphides or none at all."

9.0) EXPLORATION (OTHER THAN DRILLING) 
 

From the time it acquired the East-West property up until December 31, 2008, Knick did not undertake 

any exploration work.  From January 1, 2009, to May 21, 2010, the exploration work done by Knick was 

concentrated in the northern part of the property, covered by claims 3481181, 3828431 and 3828432, 

which correspond to lots 21 to 23, range 10, Dubuisson Township, respectively.  On the south part of 

the property, only claim 5075735 (lot 12, range A, Dubuisson), has been covered by line cutting and 

magnetic, VLF and IP surveys.  Exploration work is summarized below: 

 

! Line cutting:      22.6 km 

! Magnetic and VLF survey:    19 km 

! Induced Polarization (IP) survey:   10.8 km

9.1) Line Cutting 

 

Lines were cut on a 50-m spacing and picketed every 25 m.  They cover the north part of the property 

and lot 12, range A, Dubuisson Township, with the claim number 5075735.  The base line and tie lines 

are oriented east-west and the transverse lines are north-south.   Jean Robert of Val-d'Or was the line-

cutting contractor. 

 

9.2) Magnetic and VLF Surveys 

 

In June 2009, magnetic and VLF-EM surveys were completed over 19 km of cut lines, mainly in the 

north part of the property.  Magnetic survey included total field and calculated gradient.  Both surveys 

were carried out by Knick staff and the interpretation was by Pierre Boileau, Eng., geophysicist. 

 

Pierre Boileau's conclusions were as follows: "The ground detailed magnetic survey executed on the 

East-West project of Knick Exploration produced a very good and complete magnetic image of the 

underlying rock formations by outlining the contacts between the different geological units crossed by a 

few possible structural lineaments.  The VLF-EM survey outlined several W, NW-E, SE conductive and 

resistive zones possibly associated with structural features. 

 

These results should be first re-evaluated in the light of all geological, geochemical and geophysical 

information available on the area in order to verify the possible magnetic, EM and IP signatures of the 

known gold-bearing mineralized zones.  It is also recommended to carry out, if warranted, a few 

induced polarization and resistivity test profiles with a short (12.5 m) dipole to possibly enhance the 

responses of the finely-disseminated sulphides associated with the gold-bearing horizons." 

 

Results of the survey are illustrated on the maps in Schedule 2.  

 

9.3) IP Survey 

 

The IP survey was completed in May and June 2009 by Rémy Bélanger Geophysics of Rouyn-

Noranda, Québec.  IP interpretation was by Gérard Lambert, Eng., geophysicist.  This was a Phase IP

SOLUMINES 33 

survey, with a dipole-dipole electrode configuration and a 25 m dipole.  Dipole separations were  

n = 1 to 6.  G. Lambert's conclusions were as follows:7  

 
"The Phase Induced Polarization surveys which were recently completed over the East-West property 

for Knick Exploration Inc. have successfully defined a wide resistive corridor oriented along an east-

west direction and hosting several attractive IP anomalies originating from shallow sources for the 

majority, in addition to a number of more isolated anomalies and some other cases where the 

polarisable metallic mineralization may originate from deeper sources.   

 
Several IP anomalies within three main trends were defined and they generally occur within high 

resistivity environments.  They are likely due to the presence of metallic sulphides in the bedrock, and 

considering the occurrence of numerous significant gold zones in the immediate vicinity of the survey 

area both along strike and in the general Val-d'Or mining camp, the causes of these IP features should 

be verified, considering the possibility that they could occur within a significant resistive and potentially 

silicified structure." 

 
Two maps summarizing the IP results are included in Schedule 3 of this report. 

 

9.4) Hole-to-Hole 3D IP Survey 

 
On May 20, 2010, a hole-to-hole 3D IP survey was conducted by Abitibi Geophysics of Val-d'Or.  

During this survey, 10 independent pairs of receiver holes were surveyed on the east part of the 

property.  The list of boreholes used is given in Table 4 below, and Table 5 shows the list of borehole 

combinations.

This survey outlined nine polarizable targets, described as follows by Abitibi Geophysics:  

 
"Three polarizable targets (A, B and C) are well defined using the cross-hole IP survey.  These 

anomalies must have been intercepted by LEO-09-32, LEO-09-27, LEO-09-21 and LEO-09-36.  The 

geometry of the anomalous sources appears clearly defined as they are identified near/inside the area 

encompassed by the boreholes. 

 

One polarizable target (E) is identified between boreholes LEO-09-20 and LEO-09-22.  This IP source 

is unknown since the two DDH missed it. 

 

Five polarizable targets (D, F, G, H and I) are identified but mostly located outside the area 

encompassed by the boreholes.  Therefore, the geometry of these sources is obviously poorly defined.  

These sources have not been targeted by drilling and their nature is unknown." 

 

The block diagram showing the anomalies obtained is illustrated in Figure 7, on next page.

9.5) Stripping and Trenching 

 

Two stripping programs completed in 2009 and 2010 in the east part of the property close to the East 

zone revealed at least three new showings: Raven, Gilbert and Grand Canyon.  The main zone is the 

Raven zone, which extends more than 200 m in an ENE direction.  Gilbert and Grand Canyon are 

located 125 m and 90 m south of the Raven zone, respectively.  

 

In each stripped area, gold mineralization is included in quartz veins associated with shear zones.  On 

Raven, quartz veins are located on each side of a gabbroic sill in contact with a quartz feldspar 

porphyry (QFP) to the north and a dacite to the south.  On Gilbert and Grand Canyon, the quartz veins 

are included in intermediate volcanic.  Figure 8 shows the location of the stripped zones on the 

property, and Table 6 shows the results for gold >1 g/t.  Stripping was performed by Jean Robert of Val-

d'Or.

10.0) DRILLING 
 

10.1) Historical Drilling 

 

All the drilling done on the property prior to January 1, 2009, was done by previous owners and was 

completely beyond Knick's control.  In all the documents consulted by the author, including the drill 

logs, the following elements were observed: 

 
- Only a few of the drill logs are signed by the geologist who described the core; 

- Core size (AQ or BQ) is very rarely indicated; 

- Hole coordinates are indicated according to cut line grid coordinates, which was the norm at the 

time; 

- Hole collars were not surveyed; 

- Acid dip tests were measured only in the most recent holes, and not systematically; 

- No deviation tests (azimuth) were taken; 

- Finally, only a few core boxes from holes CD-175 and 177 have been examined; all the other 

core boxes, which contained about 135,000 feet of core drilled on the property, have been 

destroyed or are impossible to locate.  

 
The historical drilling is summarized in Schedule 1, accompanied by assay results for Au >0.05 oz/t.  

 

10.2) Drilling by Knick 

 
Knick has completed two drilling programs since acquiring the property, the first from July 7 to 

December 20, 2009, consisting of 38 holes for a total of 7,228.9 m, and the second from February 2, 

2011 to April 2, 2011, totalling 5,635.4 m in 33 holes.  These programs are described below.  

10.2.1) 2009 Drilling Program 

 
From July 7 to December 20, 2009, Knick drilled 38 holes for a total of 7,228.9 m. Forage G4 of Val-

d'Or was the drilling contractor.  NQ core size was used.  Hole deviation was measured using a Flexit 

instrument in Phase I and a Reflex instrument in Phase II.  In both cases, readings were taken every 3 

m.  Casings were left in the hole where the overburden was less than 3 m deep, and where the geology 

was judged favourable for gold mineralization.  A total of 16 casing were left in place.  The drill core was 

described by Robert Campbell, geologist, and verified by Gordon Henriksen, geologist and Vice

SOLUMINES 42 

Sixteen holes were drilled on the West zone and nine on the East zone.  When no mineralized zone is 

indicated in Tables 7 and 8, the holes were drilled to test IP anomalies, geological contacts or 

extensions of the West and East zones. 

 

As the mineralized zones dip at approximately 85º and the holes were drilled with a 45º plunge, the true 

width of the intersections is about 75% of the core length.  The surface plan in Schedule 4 shows the 

surface projection of historical and Knick drill holes, the latter beginning with the prefix LEO.  The drill 

core is stored in part at the Knick's office and in part at the Knick core shack close to the airport. 

10.2.2) 2011 Drilling Program 

 

From February 2, to April 2, 2011, Knick drilled 33 holes for a total of 5,635.4 m.  Forage Performax Inc 

of Val-d'Or was the drilling contractor.  NQ core size was used.  Hole deviation was measured using a 

Reflex instrument, with readings every 3 m.  Casings were left in the hole where overburden was less 

than 3 m deep and/or where the geology was judged favourable for gold mineralization.  A total of 13 

casings were left in place.  The drill core was described by Robert Campbell, geologist, and verified by 

Gordon Henriksen, geologist and Vice President of Knick.  Table 9 on the next page shows the drill hole 

technical data.  Table 10 summarizes the assay results for gold >1 g/t Au obtained in the drill holes.  

Surface projection of Knick 2011 drill holes is shown in schedule 5 of this report.

11.0) SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 

11.1) Historical Work 

 

As was often the case for the exploration work done prior to 2001, the reports provide no information on 

sample preparation, analysis or security.  Historical reports show that almost all the gold assays 

reported were done by fire assay.  Only a few samples were assayed for copper and silver.  It should 

also be noted that while free gold was observed, there was often no significant gold grade reported in 

the assays.  At the time of the historical drilling, 81 check samples were re-analyzed, which over a total 

of 5,800 samples represented a verification rate of 1.4%. 

 

A nugget effect is seen locally.  In general, check assays showed good correlation, but some samples 

registered up to 100% variation.  As neither the name of the laboratory that did the assays nor the 

preparation method is indicated in the historical reports, it was impossible to draw conclusions 

regarding the validity of the results.  No assays were done by metallic sieve, a method where almost 

the entire sample is assayed.  It is used when free gold is observed or a strong nugget effect is 

suspected.   

 

Because of the lack of information available, the author cannot comment on the validity of the sample 

preparation, analyses or security.  However, there was nothing in the documents consulted to indicate 

that the historical results are not valid. 

 

11.2) 2009-2010 Stripping Program 

 

Channel samples were cut with a rock saw and put in a plastic sample bag and sealed.  Samples were 

sawed perpendicular to the strike of the vein.  Sample length was dictated by geology but never 

exceeded 1.5 m.  When needed, sample bags were brought to Laboratoire Expert in Rouyn-Noranda by 

a Knick employee.  The entire process was under the supervision of Robert Campbell, geologist. 

 

During sample preparation, blanks and standards were inserted in the analytical chain.  Blanks were 

made of decorative white stones, mainly composed of calcite and to a lesser extent quartz bought in a 

garden centre in Val-d'Or.  Of the 28 blanks assayed, only one revealed value over the detection level, 

with 0.075 g/t Au. 

 



Knick Exploration Inc,               NI 43-101 Technical Report, East-West Property 

SOLUMINES 46 

Three standards were used randomly.  Each time, 60 grams were submitted for assaying.  Standards 

were provided by Rocklabs.  They are described in Table 11, with the analytical results.  

Table 11: Standards used by Knick, stripping 2009-2010 

Standard # Gold grade (ppm) Analytical variation, Lab Expert

SE 44 0.606 from -2.31% to +3.96% 
SK 43 4.086 from -4.36% to +0.6% 

 

In general, it can be seen that the laboratory has a slight tendency to under-estimate gold values, 

mainly at high grades.  But the laboratory results remain acceptable and show the high quality of the 

assays done.  Finally, no re-check was performed on these samples by another laboratory. 

 

11.3) 2009 Drilling Program 

 

The following text describes the handling of samples from the drill through to the assay results. 

 

Each day, a Knick technician picks up the drill core at the drill site and brings it to the Knick core shack, 

located in the basement of the Knick exploration office in Val-d'Or.  Core boxes are then opened and 

put on racks.  The core is logged as soon as possible by Robert Campbell, geologist, who indicates the 

samples and inserts the sample numbers into the core boxes.  The core is photographed before 

sampling, then a Knick technician samples the core.  Samples from holes LEO-09-01 to LEO-09-18 

were split using a core splitter, while other holes were sawed using a diamond blade saw.  In both 

cases, one half of the core is kept in the core box as a witness, while the other half is put in a plastic 

bag with the sample number and the bag is sealed.  This process is repeated for each sample.  

 

After that, the sample bags are grouped by batch of 15 to 20 bags and put into a shipping bag, which is 

also identified and sealed by the technician.  About once every week, these bags are brought to 

Laboratoire Expert, located in Rouyn-Noranda.  The entire process is under the supervision of Robert 

Campbell, geologist. 

 

During sample preparation, blanks and standards are inserted in the analytical chain, as follows: 1 

blank and 1 standard for every 25 samples.  Blanks are made of decorative white stones, mainly 

composed of calcite and to a lesser extent quartz, bought in a garden centre in Val-d'Or.  Of the 83 

blanks assayed, only four revealed values slightly over the detection level, with 0.015, 0.006, 0.008, 

and 0.007 g/t Au.

Three standards were used randomly.  Each time, 60 grams were submitted for assaying.  Standards 

were provided by Rocklabs.  They are described in Table 12, with the analytical results.

SK 44 0.606 from -3% to +2.3%

In general, it can be seen that the laboratory has a slight tendency to under-estimate gold values, 

mainly at high grades.  But the laboratory results remain acceptable and show the high quality of the 

assays done.  

 

Once the samples have been prepared and analyzed by Lab Expert, a part of the powders is sent to 

Actlabs for analysis in accordance with their 1E1 analytical code, whereby 30 elements are analyzed by

11.4) 2011 Drilling Program 

 

The sampling method was almost the same in 2011 as it was in 2009, and is summarized hereafter. 

 

A total of 1,635 samples were taken.  All samples were cut in half using a diamond blade saw, with one 

half retained in marked and labeled core boxes as a physical record of each sample section.  The other 

half was secured in plastic bags closed with tie wraps, then placed in large plastic sacks and sealed 

again using fiber tape and plastic tie wraps.  The samples were transported by technician Jean-Luc

SOLUMINES 48 

Gauthier, Robert Campbell, P. Geo., and/or Gordon N. Henriksen P.Geo., directly from the core shack 

to Rouyn-Noranda, where the samples were personally delivered to the laboratory technicians at Expert 

Laboratories. 

 

The fire assay/instrumental finish method was used for the gold assays and base metals, along with 

atomic absorption and/or multi-elements scan, as well as metallic sieve gold analysis as warranted.  

Gold results were reported in ppb or ppm depending on the type of assay and the laboratory.  Only four 

samples were also analyzed for Ag and Cu, with results reported in ppm.  These four assays revealed 

very low to background content for Ag and Cu. 

 

Various standards and blanks were inserted randomly and about 5% of the rejects from the core 

samples were re-analyzed by Agat Laboratories as due diligence.  Four standards were used.  Each 

time, 60 grams were submitted for assaying.  Standards were provided by Rocklabs, and are tabulated 

hereafter, along with the maximum analytical variation obtained.  

 

Table 14: Standards Used by Knick, 2011 

Standard # Gold grade (ppm) Analytical variation, Lab Expert Analytical variation, Agat 
SE 44 0.606 from -3.79% to +0.33%  

SF 45 0.848 from -1.65% to +2.12% from -0.23% to +0.47% 

SK 52 4.107 from -4.06% to +1.77% -0.17% (only one assay) 

SE 58 0.607  from -2.3% to 0.33% 
 

Much as for the 2009 program, it can be seen that Lab Experts has a slight tendency to underestimate 

gold values, mainly at higher grades.  We also observe the same phenomenon with Agat Laboratories, 

but to a lesser extent. We conclude that these results are acceptable and show the high quality of the 

assays completed.   

 

During this campaign, 66 blanks were inserted in the analytical chain.  Blanks were made of decorative 

stone mainly composed of calcite and to a lesser extent quartz, bought in a garden center in Val-d'Or.  

All blank assayed by Lab Experts returned results under the detection limits of 5 ppb.  Five blanks were 

sent to Agat for verification; three returned values under the limit of detection, and two returned values 

of 0.016 and 0.028 ppm Au.   

 

As check assays, 122 rejects from the core samples were re-analyzed by AGAT Laboratories, 

corresponding to about 7% of the total number of assays.  Figure 9 shows the correlation between the 

two laboratories for the metallic sieve analysis and Figure 10 shows the correlation for the fire assay 

with AA finish.

Figure 9: Check Assay, Metallic Sieve 

 

For the metallic sieve, gold assays results show a very good correlation, excepted for sample B21406, 

from Hole EW-11-20, which returned a result of 38.46 g/t for Laboratoire Expert and 21.6 g/t for Agat, 

likely due to a strong nugget effect.  We can affirm that the metallic sieve results are generally highly 

representative of gold content.

Figure 10: Check Assay, Fire Assay (AA Finish) 

 

Figure 10 shows the check assays done on lower grade samples by fire assay with finish by A.A 

(Atomic Absorption) spectrometry.  We observe a very good correlation between both laboratories 

when grade is lower than 0.5 ppm or 0.5 g/t Au.  The main discrepancies occur at grades higher than 1 

g/t.  This is probably due to the fact that the checks were completed on coarse rejects and not on the 

pulverized material.  Considering that this kind of material exhibits a strong nugget effect, as shown by 

the metallic sieve assays, these results can be considered normal.  However, in the future, checks 

should be done on pulverized material, which has a more constant gold content. 

 

11.5) Laboratories Used 

 

For the 2009 drilling program, gold assays by fire assay or metallic sieve and the Pt-Pd assays were 

performed by Lab Expert of Rouyn-Noranda.  Lab Expert is a laboratory certified by the "Standard 

Council of Canada: proficiency testing provider for specific mineral analysis parameters", and more 

precisely for analysis of Au, Pt, Pd, Zn, Ni and Co.  It is certified ISO 9001:2008, which is a general 

quality assurance standard.  It is not ISO/IEC 17025 certified, which is more specific to analytical and 

calibration laboratories.  On the other hand, the results obtained from the blanks, standards and check 

assays revealed the high quality of the assays performed by Lab Expert.  No crosschecks were done 

with another laboratory during the 2009 drilling program.   



Knick Exploration Inc,               NI 43-101 Technical Report, East-West Property 

SOLUMINES 51 

 

For multi-element analysis during the 2009 drilling program, the samples were prepared by Laboratoire 

Expert and the powders were then sent to Actlabs for analysis in accordance with their 1E1 analytical 

code, whereby 30 elements are analyzed by ICP (inductively coupled plasma).  Actlabs is certified 

ISO/IEC 17025:2005 (CAN-P-4E). 

 

Laboratoire Expert was the main laboratory for the 2011 drilling program, and performed the same type 

of analysis as for the 2009 drilling program.  Cross-check assays were done by Agat Laboratories on 

the rejects of the samples, for metallic sieve and for fire assay with AA finish. 

 

Laboratoire Expert, is located at 127, Boulevard Industriel, Rouyn-Noranda.  Actlabs is situated at 1201 

Walsh Street West, Thunder Bay, Ontario.  Agat Laboratories is located at 5623 McAdam Road, 

Mississauga, Ontario.  Agat is also certified ISO/IEC 17025:2005 (CAN-P-4E).  Analytical protocol used 

by each laboratory is given in schedule 6. 

 

12.0) DATA VERIFICATION 
 

For the reasons indicated in Items 13.0, 14.0 and 15.0, the author was unable to verify the historical 

data.  Also, as previously described, Knick has put in place a QA/QC (quality assurance/quality control) 

procedure by inserting blanks and standards with the samples sent to the laboratory.  At the request of 

the author, 5% of the rejects from the core samples are being analyzed by ALS Chemex of Val-d'Or, 

which is an ISO / IEC 17025-certified laboratory.  

 

The author has verified the correspondence between the core logs, samples and drill core stored by 

Knick.  Many drill sites were also visited, and correspond to the coordinates noted on the logs.  The 

author's observations confirm that the exploration work reported by Knick is real, and has been carried 

out in accordance with industry standards.  

 

13.0) MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 

No mineral processing or metallurgical testing has been done by Knick, and none has been reported in 

the past. 

 

14.0) MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 

No mineral resources or mineral reserves have ever been estimated on the East-West property.

SOLUMINES 53 

Please note that information obtained from the adjacent properties is not necessarily an indication of 

the mineralization on the property that is the subject of this technical report.  

24.0) OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 

All the relevant data and information have been given in preceding items. 

 

25.0) INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

Knick's East-West property is underlain from north to south by the Jacola and Héva Formations and the 

Kewagama Group.  Almost all the gold values obtained on the property are located in the Jacola 

Formation.  This same geological formation contains the Marbenite fault, which is parallel to the 

Jacola/Héva geological contact and seems to be associated, on the East-West property, with the best 

gold values.  It is also the Jacola Formation that, in the immediate vicinity of the East-West property, 

hosts the Marban and Kiena mines, which are located 1 km west and 2.5 km east of the property 

boundaries, respectively.  

 
Several gold zones have been identified on the property, the West and East zones have been 

historically recognized by drilling and confirmed by Knick, and the Raven, Gilbert and Grand Canyon 

zone have been exposed by Knick during a stripping program.  In both drilling and stripping, numerous 

gold values greater than 1 g/t have been obtained, sometimes reaching more than 1 oz/t Au. 

 

Geologically, the West zone shows similarities with the Marban mine, with mineralization composed of 

quart-ankerite-tourmaline veins in intermediate to mafic flows.  The East zone shows affinities with the 

Kiena mine mineralization, as is associated with quartz carbonates veins sometimes associated with 

breccias. 

 
Historically, more than 180 holes totalling over 41,000 m have been drilled and 5,800 samples have 

been assayed.  Drilling was concentrated on lots 21, 22 and 23, range 10, Dubuisson Townships, over 

an area of 98 ha.  This important density of information is concentrated in the first 200 m below surface. 

 
Since January 2009, Knick has drilled 71 holes totalling 12,864.3 m.  Most of these drill holes 

have been drilled on the East, West and Raven zones and have also been used to test several IP 

anomalies.  A total of 3,458 samples were taken from drill holes and generally assayed by fire-

assay with an atomic absorption finish, and all samples containing visible gold were assayed by 

metallic sieve.  Blanks and standards were inserted with the samples sent to the laboratory.  Very 

slight result variances were observed, indicating the high quality of the analyses performed.  As a 

supplementary verification, 7% of the sample rejects from the 2011 drilling program were sent to 



Knick Exploration Inc,               NI 43-101 Technical Report, East-West Property 

SOLUMINES 54 

Agat Laboratory for re-analysis.  As the material sent is prone to a strong nugget effect, and like 

the rejects and not the powders were sent for re-check, a strong variation in results is observed 

locally, mainly for samples containing more than 1 g/t Au.   

 
Until now, the West zone has been explored to a depth of 200 m.  Drill holes 300 to 500 m in 

length will be required to test its gold potential below 200 m and try to outline minable resources.  

Further exploration work should be done on the East zone.  Stripping done in 2009-2010 

revealed gold bearing quartz veins with gold grades of up to 38.2 g/t Au over 0.5 m in channel 

samples.  Holes drilled to test outcropping gold-bearing zones at depth have shown geological 

continuity to a depth of at least 100 m.  More drilling will be required to more precisely define the 

geometry and structure controlling the gold mineralization.   

 

26.0) RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

In light of the results obtained so far, it is highly recommended that exploration work on the property 

resume, with emphasis on the West, East and Raven zones, where gold values have already been 

discovered. 

 

For Phase 1, preparation of a 3D model of the geology and the mineralized zones on the property is 

recommended to help visualize the various gold zones.  Once established, the model should be kept up 

to date with new drill results.  More specifically, approximately 8,000 m drilling is recommended on the 

West zone on a 50-m pattern, laterally and vertically, to a depth of 1,000 m, to try to extend the 

mineralized area both laterally and at depth.  The same philosophy applies to the East and Raven 

zones, with 12,000 m of drilling on a 50-m pattern to a depth of 1,000 m, to extend the mineralized zone 

laterally and at depth. Figures 11 and 12 show the drilling pattern over the West and East zones, 

respectively. 

 

Phase 2: If the results from Phase I are encouraging enough, drilling on a tighter, 25-m pattern is 

recommended on the most promising zones, as well as a resource estimate, if deemed warranted.  The 

budget for both phases is given on the next page.

PRÉPARATION DES ÉCHANTILLONS

1- Réception des échantillons

Lors de la réception, les échantillons sont placés en ordre numérique pour
ensuite être comparé avec la feuille d'envoi du client afin de s'assurer que
tout concorde. Si les échantillons reçus ne correspondent pas à la liste du
client, celui-ci en sera informé. Si le client n'inclut aucune feuille d'envoi, la
personne en charge de la réception des échantillons en préparera une.

2- Préparation des échantillons

L'échantillon est séché si nécessaire pour être ensuite réduit à ¼ de pouce
dans un concasseur à mâchoire. Le concasseur est nettoyé entre chaque
échantillon à l'aide d'un compresseur à air et de plus, il est nettoyé avec du
matériel stérile entre chaque lot. L'échantillon est ensuite concassé à 90% -
10 mailles dans un concasseur à rouleaux. Ce même concasseur est
nettoyé entre chaque échantillon à l'aide d'un compresseur à air et d'une
brosse métallique et de plus, il est nettoyé avec du matériel stérile entre
chaque lot. Le premier échantillon de chaque lot est tamisé à 10 mailles afin
de déterminer si 90% passe à 10 mailles. En cas contraire, le concasseur à
rouleaux est ajusté et un autre test est effectué. Les résultats de ces tests
sont notés sur un registre prévu à cette fin. Une portion de 300 grammes est
ensuite séparée dans un séparateur Jones et cette portion est pulvérisée à
90% - 200 mailles dans un pulvérisateur à anneaux Le pulvérisateur est
nettoyé entre chaque échantillon à l'aide d'un compresseur à air et de plus, il
est nettoyé avec de la silice entre chaque lot. Le premier échantillon de
chaque lot est tamisé à 200 mailles. Si 90% ne passe pas, le temps de
pulvérisation est alors augmenté et un autre test est effectué. Les résultats
de ces tests sont notés sur un registre prévu à cette fin. Le matériel en
surplus (le rejet) est entreposé pour le client.

OR PAR GRAVIMÉTRIE (PYROANALYSE)

Un échantillon de 29.166 grammes est pesé et versé dans un creuset dans
lequel on a, au préalablement, déposé environ 130 grammes de fondant.
L'échantillon est ensuite mélangé et 1 mg de nitrate d'argent y est ajouté.
L'échantillon est alors mis en fusion à 1800

o
Fahrenheit pour environ 45

minutes. Celui-ci est versé dans un moule conique et on le laisse refroidir.
Après refroidissement, la scorie est cassée et un bouton de plomb pesant de
25 à 30 grammes est récupéré. Ce bouton est alors coupellé à 1600

o

Fahrenheit et ce, jusqu'à ce que le plomb soit oxydé. Après refroidissement,
la bille est aplatie à l'aide d'un marteau pour ensuite être déposée dans un
creuset en porcelaine (parting cup). Ce creuset est rempli avec de l'acide
nitrique 1 :7 et chauffé jusqu'à dissolution de l'argent. Quand la réaction
semble terminée, une goutte d'acide nitrique concentrée est ajoutée et
l'échantillon est observé afin de d'assurer qu'il n'y ait aucune autre réaction.
La bille d'or est alors rincée plusieurs fois dans de l'eau chaude distillée,
séchée, réchauffée, refroidie et ensuite pesée.

Chaque lot allant au four comprend 28 échantillons incluant un blanc et un
standard pour l'or. Les creusets ne sont réutilisés tant et aussi longtemps
que nous n'avons pas eu les résultats d'analyse. Les creusets ayant
contenus des échantillons ayant une valeur supérieure à 3.00 g/t sont jetés.
La limite de détection minimale est de 0.03 g/t et il n'y a aucune limite de
détection maximale. Tous les échantillons ayant des valeurs supérieures à
3.00 g/t sont réanalysés avant de soumettre le rapport final.



Metallic Gold:

The total sample is dried if necessary, crushed and pulverized then screened using a 100

mesh screen. The -100 mesh portion is mixed and assayed in duplicate by fire assay
gravimetric finish as well as all of the +100 mesh portion. All individual assays are

reported as well as the final calculated value.

OR / PLATINE / PALLADIUM PAR GÉOCHIMIE (PYROANALYSE)

Un échantillon de 29.166 grammes est pesé et versé dans un creuset dans
lequel on a, au préalablement, déposé environ 130 grammes de fondant.
L'échantillon est ensuite mélangé et 1 mg de nitrate d'argent y est ajouté.
L'échantillon est alors mis en fusion à 1800

o
Fahrenheit pour environ 45

minutes. Celui-ci est versé dans un moule conique et on le laisse refroidir.
Après refroidissement, la scorie est cassée et un bouton de plomb pesant de
25 à 30 grammes est récupéré. Ce bouton est alors coupellé à 1600

o

Fahrenheit et ce, jusqu'à ce que le plomb soit oxydé. Après refroidissement,
la bille est placée dans une éprouvette de 12 X 75 mm. Une portion de 0.2
ml d'acide nitrique 1 :1 est ajoutée pour permettre une réaction. L'éprouvette
est déposée dans un bain d'eau pour environ 30 minutes. Ensuite, 0.3 ml
acide hydrochlorique concentré est ajouté pour permettre une seconde
réaction, toujours dans un bain d'eau pour un autre 30 minutes.
L'éprouvette est ensuite retirée du bain d'eau et 4.5 ml d'eau distillée y est
ajoutée. L'échantillon est alors mélangé vigoureusement pour ensuite le
laisser reposer et les concentrations d'or, platine et palladium sont
déterminées parDCP.

Chaque lot allant au four comprend 28 échantillons incluant un blanc et un
standard pour l'or, platine et palladium. Les creusets ne sont réutilisés tant et
aussi longtemps que nous n'avons pas eu les résultats d'analyse. Les
creusets ayant contenus des échantillons ayant une valeur supérieure à 200
PPB sont jetés. La limite de détection minimale est de 5 PPB.

MÉTAUX DE BASE
(Ag,Cu,Ni,Zn,Pb,Co)

1. INTRODUCTION :

L'utilisation de l'acide nitrique et chlorhydrique permet la mise en
solution des éléments contenus dans le minerai. L'action des acides permet
dans un cas d'oxyder les éléments à leur état métallique et d'autre part, elle
permet la dissolution. Ensuite, l'échantillon est analysé par un
spectrophotomètre d'absorption atomique. La solution est aspirée pour être
introduite dans une flamme air acétylène. L'échantillon subit alors les étapes
suivantes : nébulisation, dissolution, vaporisation et atomisation. La dernière
étape est cruciale car celle-ci permet à l'analyte d'absorber les longueurs
d'onde fondamentales spécifique au métal. En mesurant la différence
d'intensité on peut obtenir un signal correspond à l'intensité de lumière
absorbée. En portant la concentration de l'analyte en fonction du logarithme
de l'intensité initiale (Io) sur l'intensité finale (I) on obtient une fonction
linéaire. À l'aide d'une courbe d'étalonnage on peut mesurer la
concentration inconnue d'un métal.

2. PROCEDURE :

ATTAQUE PARTIELLE (AAT-7)

2.1 Peser 0,5 g d'échantillon pulvérisé et à l'aide d'un entonnoir et le placer
dans un tube de verre. On y place des éléments de contrôle de qualité :
Blanc, duplicata et standard.

2.2 Ajouter 2,5 ml d'acide chlorhydrique concentré et laisser chauffer dans
un bain-marie pour une demi-heure.

2.3 Ajouter 0,5 ml d'acide nitrique concentré et continuer le chauffage pour

2.4 Ajouter 7 ml d'eau, bien mélanger et laisser reposer le tube pour une
période de 12 heures.

2.5 On fait la courbe d'étalonnage avec trois étalons standard sur le
spectromètre d'absorption atomique. On vérifie périodiquement en cours



d'analyse la courbe d'étalonnage avec le standard ayant la plus faible
concentration. Si nécessaire on refait la courbe d'étalonnage.

2.6 L'échantillon est mesuré deux fois par l'appareil. Rapporter la
concentration moyenne de l'échantillon donné par l'appareil sur la feuille de
travail.

2.7 La limite de détection de 2 ppm pour tous les métaux à l'exception de
l'argent qui est de 0,2 ppm

ATTAQUE TOTALE (AAT-8)

hydrofluorique, 3 gouttes de brome, chauffer et ajouter 10 ml d'acide
hydrochlorique concentré.

2.10 Nettoyer les rebords du bécher après que les vapeurs blanches soient
évaporées.

2.11 Chauffer pour mettre à sec.

2.12 Ajouter 25 ml d'acide hydrochlorique concentré, 5 ml d'acide nitrique
concentré et amener à un volume de 100 ml avec de l'eau.

2.13 On fait la courbe d'étalonnage avec trois étalons standard sur le
spectromètre d'absorption atomique. On vérifie périodiquement en cours
d'analyse la courbe d'étalonnage avec le standard ayant la plus faible
concentration. Si nécessaire on refait la courbe d'étalonnage.

Code 1E1 

 

0.5 g of sample is digested with aqua regia (0.5 ml H2O, 0.6 ml concentrated HNO3 and 1.8 ml concentrated HCl) 

for 2 hours at 95 C.  Sample is cooled then diluted to 10 ml with deionized water and homogenized.  The samples 

are then analyzed using a Perkin Elmer OPTIMA 3000 Radial ICP for the 30 element suite.  A matrix standard and 

blank are run every 13 samples.  For vegetation a 0.25 g sample is used. 

 

A series of USGS-geochemical standards are used as controls. This digestion is near total for base metals however 

will only be partial for silicates and oxides.

AGAT Method Code: 202 120 AGAT SOP: MIN-200-12040 

Method Description: Metallic Screen – Gold Analysis

500g of crushed material (75% passing 2 mm) is pulverized using a ring and puck to ensure  

approximately 80 - 90% passing 75 μm. The material on top of the screen is referred to as the "plus" 

(+) fraction with the material passing through the screen is referred to as the "minus" (-) fraction. 

Both the "plus" fraction and "minus" fraction weights are recorded.

The entire "plus" fraction is sent for fire assay determination while two (30g) replicates of the 

"minus" are taken for fire assay determination. Either gravimetric gold determination or an analytical 

finish of ICP-OES is used.

Gold assay results are reported for both "plus" and "minus" fractions, weights of both fractions, and 

the calculated "total gold" of the sample.

The calculation for "total gold" is as follows:

Total gold (g/t) =
(Au ("minus") g/t x Wt. "Minus" x 10-6 t/g) + (Au ("plus") g/t x Wt. "Plus" x 10-6t/g))

(Wt. ("minus") + Wt. ("plus") x 10-6 t/g

Blanks, sample replicates, duplicates, and internal reference materials (both aqueous and  

geochemical standards) are routinely used as part of AGAT Laboratories quality assurance program.

Either Mettler-Toledo Microbalances or PerkinElmer 7300DV and 8300DV ICP-OES instruments are 

used in the analysis
