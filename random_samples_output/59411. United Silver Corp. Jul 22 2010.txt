Summary (Item 3) 
SRK Consulting, (U.S.), Inc. (SRK) was commissioned by United Mine Services, Inc. (UMS) on 
May 13, 2010 to update the UMS Readdressed National Instrument 43-101 compliant (NI 43-
101) Technical Report on Resources dated March 1, 2010 to fulfill applicable securities 
obligations for the completed business combination transaction between UMS and Scarlet 
Resources, Ltd., (Scarlet), a public company listed on the Canadian National Stock Exchange.  
Under the terms of the agreement, Scarlet acquired 100% of the shares of UMS in exchange for 
common shares of Scarlet. 

The transaction between UMS and Scarlet closed on May 7, 2010.  As part of the transaction, 
Scarlet changed its name to United Mining Group, Inc. (UMG).  UMS is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of UMG. 

SRK was originally commissioned by SNS to provide the reader with a comprehensive review of 
the modern exploration activities conducted at the Crescent Mine (or the Project) and a current 
SRK resource estimate based on 1,465 assays from 100 diamond drillholes.  SRK was then 
commissioned by UMS to Readdress the original SNS NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resource, 
dated March 1, 2010, to fulfill applicable securities obligations for the pending business 
combination transaction between UMS and Scarlet. 

This report is unchanged from the Readdressed UMS NI 43-101 Technical Report except, certain 
portions of the Executive Summary introduction, Section 1 Introduction, Section 1.1 Terms of 
Reference and Purpose of the Report and Section 18 Recommendations. 

Property Description and Location 

The Project is an intermediate-advanced stage silver exploration project, currently tested by 100 
diamond drillholes.  It is located approximately 4mi southeast of the town of Kellogg, Shoshone 
County, Idaho and approximately 75mi east of Spokane, Washington.  The Project 
mineralization is centered about 47° 30' 16" N. latitude and 116° 04' 27" W. longitude (UTM 
coordinates 5261639 N and 569722 E, Zone 11), located in Sections 15, 16, 17, and 20, 
Township 48 North, Range 3 East.   

Ownership 

On December 12, 2006, SNS, previously named Strategic Nevada Resources, acquired the right 
to purchase the Project from the County Commissioners of Shoshone County, Idaho for 
US$650,000.  The transaction was completed on January 2, 2007.  The Project is composed of 25 
patented mining claims totaling 346.190 acres, and surface rights totaling 40.631 acres.  

On July 13, 2007, two claim fractions named Queen Lode lying within section 16 were 
purchased from The New Bunker Hill Company.  These were claim fractions lying within the 
otherwise contiguous property boundaries. 

On December 31, 2009, UMS and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Syringa Exploration, Inc. (SE), 
entered into an exploration earn-in agreement with SNS.  Under the terms of this agreement, 
UMS and SE will spend US$9 million over three years on continued exploration and 
development of the Project in order to earn up to an 80% interest in the Project.

Geology and Mineralization 

The Project geology is dominated by Precambrian sedimentary rocks of the Belt Supergroup, 
which have been strongly deformed during the Cretaceous age Sevier Orogeny.  This 
deformation has resulted in large-scale folds cut by numerous west to northwest striking faults 
and veins.  The primary fault at the Project is the Alhambra reverse fault, which displaces the 
stratigraphy of the mine area by approximately 3,000ft.  The Project has been historically 
explored along five main mineralized structures, the Alhambra, South, East Footwall, Hook and 
BJ Veins.  Most of the historic production has come from the Alhambra, East Footwall, Hook 
and BJ; the South Vein was never mined.  The current resource estimation includes only 
mineralization above the 2,450ft elevation within the Alhambra and South Veins.  The 
mineralization has occurred as a result of mesothermal metamorphic/hydrothermal processes.  It 
is characterized by steep, narrow veins that contain economic concentrations of tetrahedrite and 
subordinate galena, introduced as discrete pulses within the same hydrothermal event.     

Exploration 

The exploration work conducted by SNS meets current industry standards.  The drilling program 
is of an appropriate type, it was well planned and carried out in a prudent and careful manner.  
All drill core logging and sampling has been done by trained and professional personnel.  SNS 
has made a concerted effort to ensure good sample quality and has maintained a careful chain of 
custody and ensured sample security from the drill rig to the assay laboratory. 

The 2007-2008 diamond drilling program targeted two mineralized veins.  The drilling was laid 
out for nominal 200ft drillhole spacing along the veins and adequately defines the zone of silver 
mineralization.  Both structures are confined along strike in the elevations tested.  The Alhambra 
Vein is also confined at depth, but the South Vein remains open at depth in some areas. 

Significant exploration potential also exists in the lower levels of the mine, but SNS chose to 
explore first the near surface targets that would be accessible from surface or the Hooper Level, 
and would not require dewatering the lower mine. 

Resource Estimation 

The Project resource estimation is based on information from 100 drillholes totaling 103,215ft.  
The drillhole database was compiled by SNS, verified by SRK and is determined to be of high 
quality.  Wire frame solids of the vein geometries were constructed based on a minimum grade 
threshold of 1.5oz/t Ag.  These solids were used to sub-cell each vein in the block model.  The 
blocking was done using a parent block size of a 100ft cube with sub-blocks down to a minimum 
of a 2ft cube.  The grade estimate was completed using the inverse distance squared weighting 
algorithm, conducted in two passes.  The first required a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 
samples which were less than 250ft from the block centroids.  The second pass only considered 
un-estimated blocks and required a minimum of 2 and maximum of 12 composites, which were 
less than 500ft away from the block centroids.  

The results of the estimation provided a CIM classified Indicated Mineral Resource of 324kt of 
material with 18.7oz/t Ag and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 211kt of material with 19.5oz/t 
Ag, both based on an 11.0oz/t Ag cut-off grade.  The quality of the Project drilling and data is 
very good, and the Mineral Resource was classified mainly according to the general drillhole 
spacing.

Conclusions and Recommendations 

SRK recommends that UMS conduct five stages of work culminating in a Preliminary 
Assessment of the Project.  Stage one would be to complete fire assays on approximately 50 
samples with reported ICP-AES silver grades over 2.0oz/t.  If the results show substantially 
different average silver grades then the remaining samples should be fire assayed and the results 
incorporated into a revised resource estimation.  Stage two would be to extend the Hooper 
Tunnel approximately 1,000ft and set up a drilling station.  Stage three would be to complete 
approximately 5,000ft of drilling into the down dip extension of the South Vein.  Stage four 
would be to complete bench scale metallurgical test work sufficient to support a Preliminary 
Assessment.  Stage five would be to revise the resource estimation and incorporate the result into 
a Preliminary Assessment.

1 Introduction (Item 4) 
SRK Consulting, (U.S.), Inc. (SRK) was commissioned by United Mine Services, Inc. (UMS) on 
May 13, 2010 to update the UMS Readdressed National Instrument 43-101 compliant (NI 43-
101) Technical Report on Resources dated March 1, 2010 to fulfill applicable securities 
obligations for the completed merger between UMS and Scarlet Resources, Ltd., (Scarlet) a 
public company listed on the Canadian National Stock Exchange (CNSX).  Under the terms of 
the agreement, Scarlet acquired 100% of the shares of UMS in exchange for common shares of 
Scarlet. 

The transaction between UMS and Scarlet closed on May 7, 2010.  As part of the transaction, 
Scarlet changed its name to United Mining Group, Inc. (UMG).  UMS is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of UMG. 

SRK was originally commissioned by SNS to provide the reader with a comprehensive review of 
the modern exploration activities conducted at the Crescent Mine (or the Project), and a current 
SRK resource estimate based on 1,465 assays from 100 diamond drillholes.  SRK was then 
commissioned by UMS to Readdress the original SNS NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resource 
dated March 1, 2010 to fulfill applicable securities obligations for the pending business 
combination transaction between UMS and Scarlet. 

This report is unchanged from the oReaddress  NI 43-101 Technical Report except, certain 
portions of the Executive Summary introduction, Section 1 Introduction, Section 1.1 Terms of 
Reference and Purpose of the Repor and, Section 18 Recommendations 

1.1 Terms of Reference and Purpose of the Report 

This Technical Report on Resources is intended for the use of UMS to fulfill applicable 
securities obligations as described above.  The Project is an intermediate-advanced stage silver 
exploration project that was mapped, surveyed, and drilled by SNS during 2007 and 2008.  This 
document provides a Technical Report on Resources of the Project, prepared according to NI 43-
101 guidelines.  Form NI 43-101F1 was used as the format for this report.   

This report is prepared using the industry accepted Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum (CIM) "Best Practices and Reporting Guidelines" for disclosing mineral exploration 
information, the Canadian Securities Administrators revised regulations in NI 43-101 (Standards 
of Disclosure For Mineral Projects) and Companion Policy 43-101CP, and CIM Definition 
Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 11, 2005).   

1.2 Reliance on Other Experts (Item 5)

1.3.1 Site Visit 

The author was first on site for one and one half days during January 31 and February 1, 2008.  
This time was spent conducting interviews with the technical staff, reviewing historic data files 
and observing the ongoing exploration work.  During the January site visit, the author spent the 
first day conducting detailed reviews of the SNS exploration procedures in order to evaluate their 
compliancy with current NI 43-101 reporting standards.  At this time, historical data files were 
also reviewed to evaluate whether this data could support a current resource estimation.  The 
second day was spent touring the underground exposure of the mineralized structure, observing

the drilling, geologic logging, sampling protocol, specific gravity determinations and chain of 
custody.  A Technical Memo was transmitted to SNS after the site visit addressing areas of 
concern and providing recommendation for improvement.  A follow up site visit was conducted 
on August 22, 2008 to observe the modified procedures implemented by SNS based on the SRK 
recommendations.  Again, the overall exploration program was reviewed and all procedures were 
found to meet or exceed current industry standards.

2 Property Description and Location (Item 6) 
2.1 Property Location 

The Project property is located in the panhandle of northern Idaho, approximately 4mi SE of 
Kellogg, Idaho, USA and approximately 75mi from Spokane, Washington, USA (Figure 2-1).  
The drive from Spokane to the Project is approximately 1.25 hours, and from Kellogg, 10 
minutes.  The Project is centered at about 47° 30' 16" N latitude and 116° 04' 27" W. longitude 
(UTM coordinates 5261639 N and 569722 E, Zone 11), located in Sections 15, 16, 17, and 20, 
Township 48 North, Range 3 East.   

2.2 Mineral Titles 

On December 12, 2006, SNS (Strategic Nevada Resources, later renamed SNS Silver Corp.) 
acquired the right to purchase the Project from Shoshone County, Idaho for US$650,000.  The 
transaction was completed on January 2, 2007.  On July 13, 2007, two claim fractions named 
Queen Lode, lying within section 16 were purchased from The New Bunker Hill Company.  
These were fractions lying within the otherwise contiguous property boundaries.  The property is 
currently composed of 25 patented mining claims totaling 346.190 acres, and surface rights 
totaling 40.631 acres (Figure 2-2).  The claims and surface rights parcels are listed in Table 
2.2.1.

2.3 Location of Mineralization 

The known mineralization is located within the Kellogg East and Polaris Peak, Idaho 7.5 minute 
topographic sheets in Shoshone County, Idaho.  This area lies within the Coeur d'Alene mining 
district.   



United Mine Services, Inc.  2-2 
Crescent Mine   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  May 21, 2010 
Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

The major zones of mineralization are the Alhambra, South and East Footwall-Hook-BJ veins.  
The silver-bearing veins strike predominantly east-west and dip steeply to the south.  All drill 
tested mineralization comprising the Mineral Resource estimation of this report is located within 
the patented mineral claims held by SNS. 

The Project facilities include several miles of underground workings on the Alhambra, South, 
East Footwall, Hook, Steep Lead, and Gray Copper vein structures.  Several small mine dumps 
derived from mining the upper levels of the mine can be found on the property.  The North 
American dump is located on the northeastern part of the Project property.  The dump has been 
used by SNS for waste rock from exploration drifting.  Other inactive dumps that occur on the 
property are near the portals of the Big Creek #1, Big Creek #2, Big Creek #3, and Big Creek #4 
tunnels.  The current Project surface facilities are located on top of the mine dump adjacent to the 
Hooper Tunnel. 

There are currently no known ore stockpiles on the property. 

2.4 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances 

There are two underlying agreement issues made by The Bunker Hill Company, former owner of 
the Project at the time of the agreements, with owners of adjoining properties.  The rights 
conferred by these agreements are believed to have been transferred with the ownerships, and to 
still be in effect as noted in a legal opinion dated May 14, 2007 written by Michael E. Regan, 
Coeur d'Alene, Idaho (Stoel Rives LLP 2007). 

The first issue concerns three, 1958 agreements that define boundaries between Project and 
adjoining properties.  These agreements define inclined boundaries to the Project property such 
that the mineralization within the Alhambra, East Footwall, Hook and BJ veins below the 1,500ft 
elevation are owned by the Project holders.  These agreements also convey extra lateral rights for 
other veins, not important to the Project, to adjoining properties.  

The second issue concerns a 1973 mine water discharge agreement.  The discharge line from the 
Project flows into the neighboring Sunshine discharge line.  There is an agreement dated April 
16, 1973 that effluent up to 150gpm from the Project will be transported for a period of fifty (50) 
years through Sunshine's discharge lines to Sunshine mine's tailings impoundment area, and 
treated by Sunshine.  The terms of this agreement have been followed by SNS and Sterling 
Mining Co. (lessees of the Sunshine Mine), since SNS initiated exploration activities on the 
property. 

On December 31, 2009, UMS and SE entered into an exploration earn-in agreement with SNS.  
Under the terms of this agreement, UMS and SE will spend US$9 million over three years on 
continued exploration and development of the Project in order to earn up to an 80% interest in 
the Project.  This agreement was accepted by the TSX Venture Exchange on February 1, 2010, 
upon which UMS and SE completed a cash payment to SNS of US$120,000, and issued 500,000 
common shares of UMS to SNS.  An additional US$100,000 is to be paid to SNS once UMS has 
completed a contemplated listing on a recognized Canadian stock exchange or quotation system 
by way of reverse takeover or qualifying transaction by May 31, 2010.  If UMS does not 
complete the contemplated listing by May 31, 2010, UMS will issue 100,000 shares of its 
common stock to SNS. 

In detail, the earn-in agreement stipulates exploration and exploration expenditures of:

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  May 21, 2010 
Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

 US$2,000,000 by September 30, 2011; 

 An additional US$3,000,000 by September 30, 2012; and 

 An additional US$4,000,000 by September 30, 2013. 

UMS and SE can earn their interest in stages as follows: 

 50% when cumulative exploration expenditures reach $5,000,000; 

 60% when cumulative exploration expenditures reach $6,000,000; 

 70% when cumulative exploration expenditures reach $7,000,000; and 

 80% when cumulative exploration expenditures reach $9,000,000. 

UMS and SE are private companies incorporated in Idaho, and SE is a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of UMS.  On February 5, 2010, Scarlet agreed to acquire 100% of the shares of common stock of 
UMS.  Scarlet is a Vancouver-based company listed on the CNSX. 

2.5 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 

A Modified Phase I Environmental Assessment Report dated February 9, 2007 was prepared for 
the Company by LFR, Inc. of Liberty Lake, Washington (LFR Inc 2007).  LFR notes five 
"Recognized Environmental Conditions" as follows: 

1. Location within a Superfund-Designated Area. 

2. Listing within the EPA "remedial investigation/feasibility study" for the presence of adit 
drainage, upland waste rock, and surface disturbance with potential for erosion. 

3. Surface Water Discharge Contaminant Contributions and NPDES Permitting.  

4. Upland Soil and Waste Rock Contamination. 

5. Underground Contaminant Sources and Ground Water Impacts. 

The consensus of this evaluation is that the Project owners face the possibility of being required 
to remediate features related to historic mining activity on the property.  The two significant 
issues are treatment of the water from the underground workings, and control of erosion and 
runoff from mine dumps and other areas of surface disturbance.  The Project is currently 
operating under the NPDES discharge permit for the Sunshine Mine as a result of the 1973 
agreement. 

2.5.1 Required Permits and Status 

Exploration work conducted to date was conducted on patented lands where no exploration 
permits are required.  Water acquired from small surface creeks on the property for this work 
does require a water use permit.  Temporary Approval of Water Appropriation Permit #TP-94-63 
from the State of Idaho Department of Water Resources has permitted this activity, and this 
approval is currently in effect.  

The Project is currently operating under the NPDES discharge permit for the Sunshine Mine 
because of the 1973 agreement described above. 

2.5.2 Compliance Evaluation 

There have been no complaints of noncompliance reported for the work on the Project by SNS.

3 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography (Item 7) 

3.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The property topography is characterized as foothills of rugged mountains cut by the narrow 
valley of the Big Creek drainage.  The property elevations range from 2,500 to 5,600ft above sea 
level.  

Outcrop on the property is limited because of extensive vegetation and the development of a soil 
horizon, but the Alhambra vein has been identified in surface exposure.  This outcrop is 
principally within road cuts made for the purposes of mining access and logging.   

Most of the property is covered with a mixed conifer forest including hemlock and Douglas fir, 
with moderate to thick underbrush where most recently logged. 

The elevation at the portal of the Hooper Tunnel, the main haulage level of the Project property, 
is 2,690ft (McGrath, 2002). 

3.2 Climate and Length of Operating Season 

The property is located in the northern Rockies and has average summer high temperatures of 
82° F and average winter low temperatures of 22° F.  The average rainfall in Kellogg, Idaho is 
about 31in/yr and the mean average snowfall is 54in/yr (WRCC, 2009).  Surface drilling has 
been conducted from May through November.  The historical operation of the Project was year-
round. 

3.3 Physiography 

The physiography of the Project property is moderately steep.  The property is located on the 
west side of Big Creek, which flows into the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River.  The South 
Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River and Big Creek are both perennial streams.  Elk Creek, located 
on the property, flows from the spring runoff until about the end of July.  

The Project has sufficient sites suitable to accommodate mining roads and mining waste dumps, 
but not processing facilities.  Toll milling at one of the five nearby mills would accommodate 
processing needs or alternatively, private lands could be obtained in the nearby areas of Kellogg 
to site a processing facility and tailings disposal area.  

3.4 Access to Property 

Access from Spokane, Washington follows Interstate 90 east for 75mi to the Big Creek exit #54, 
and then proceeds south upgrade Big Creek road for 2mi to the Sunshine Mill.  Here, a sharp 
right turn enters the private driveway of the Project.  A network of four-wheel drive drill roads in 
good condition accesses the surface exploration area.  The underground is accessed via two 
development levels, namely the Hooper Tunnel and the Big Creek #4 Portal. 

3.5 Surface Rights 

The surface rights owned by SNS comprise a contiguous, irregularly shaped parcel of ground 
totaling 40.631 acres (Figure 2-2).  This parcel consists of the Hiawatha claim (11.331ac), Diana 
Claim (3.61ac), and parts of sections 15 (10.6ac) and 16 (15.09ac). 



United Mine Services, Inc.  3-2

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  May 21, 2010 
Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

The remaining surface rights on the patented mineral claims that comprise the Project belong 
mainly to Stimson Lumber Co. with a very small portion that belongs to Silver Mountain 
Ventures.  These surface rights extend 100ft vertically below the current topography. 

3.6 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Spokane, Washington, located 75mi from the project, is a city of nearly 200,000 with an 
international airport.  It is the major services center for a broad region of western Washington 
and northern Idaho.  Two other intermediate sized population centers are located very close to 
the Project.  Kellogg, Idaho (pop. 2,395) is located 4mi to the northwest.  The county seat, 
Wallace, Idaho (pop 960) is located 8mi to the east.  These towns have services, which include 
restaurants, hotels, hardware stores, grocery stores, schools, and other facilities.  A community 
hospital with emergency care is located in Kellogg, Idaho. 

The Coeur d'Alene mining district has enjoyed continuous mine production for the past 130 
years; and supports local businesses that cater to the mining industry, including fabricators, 
suppliers, contractors and technical services.  

3.6.1 Access Road and Transportation 

The Project is accessed from Interstate 90 and for 2mi south on Big Creek Road, a paved county 
highway.   

3.6.2 Power Supply 

SNS built a 2,000kVA substation in 2007 near the portal of the main haulage level.  This 
substation capacity is sufficient for all surface and underground activities, both current and 
future. 

3.6.3 Communications 

Landline telephones and cable internet services are currently available and established at the 
mine.  Cellular phone service is unavailable due to the steep topography.  A pager telephone 
system is in place for communication between the underground and the surface. 

3.6.4 Water Supply 

The Project currently receives potable water from the Central Shoshone County Water District, 
through a water line from the main South Fork valley upgrade along the Big Creek drainage.  
Future water needs for mining could be met from water currently stored in the historic Project 
site underground workings. 

3.6.5 Port 

The nearest port is Seattle, Washington, which is 360mi away by Federal interstate highway. 

3.6.6 Buildings and Ancillary Facilities 

Six heated, metal-sided buildings comprise the surface facilities, located on the Hooper Tunnel 
dump.  These include; a combined mine office/dry, a technical services office, a four room 
building that houses the electrical shop, machine shop, compressor, and "battery barn", and three 
large storage buildings that house equipment and drill core.

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  May 21, 2010 
Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

3.6.7 Camp Site 

There is no camp site.  All current personnel live in nearby communities and there is adequate 
housing available to accommodate all future personnel.   

3.6.8 Underground Workings 

The underground workings are currently accessible from two tunnels located on the Big Creek 
drainage on the east side of the property.  The main haulage level is the Hooper Tunnel portal, 
located adjacent to the surface buildings at an elevation of 2,690ft.  Above this, the Big Creek 
No. 4 Tunnel portal is located at an elevation of 3,220ft.  On the west side of the property, the 
historic Alhambra Tunnel portal is located at 3,265ft elevation within the Elk Creek drainage.  
The Alhambra Tunnel is currently caved  at one or more points, cutting off air circulation to the 
western end.  To the east, the Big Creek No. 4 tunnel is connected to the Alhambra Tunnel by a 
short ramp as the two tunnels differ in elevation by about 30ft, where the two tunnels meet.  The 
Alhambra and Hooper Levels are connected by the Alhambra raise.  This is caved, but permits 
ventilation between the two levels.   

The lower part of the mine was accessed by the Ellis Shaft, a vertical shaft sunk from the Hooper 
Level to the 3200 Level.  Access for historic production from below the 3100 Level was via 
other internal shafts, and the lowest level in the mine, the 4300 Level, was developed by a 
decline with rubber-tired equipment from the 4100 Level.  The Yreka-United crosscut, connects 
the Bunker Hill Mine, approximately 2mi west, to the 3100 Level of the Project. 

Historic stoping occurred in two main areas of the Project.  The earliest were on and near the 
Alhambra vein from the Hooper Level to the surface in the early 1900's.  The later were on the 
Alhambra, East Footwall, BJ and Hook veins located between 2500 and 4300 Levels in the 
1950's to 1970's.  Currently, all of the historic workings are flooded below the 700 Level (700ft 
below the Hooper Tunnel). 

3.6.9 Potential Plant Sites 

A small concentrator operated on site prior to 1940, and was dismantled shortly thereafter.  SNS 
does not plan to build a mill on site.  The steep hillsides and limited surface ownership would 
make it very difficult.  Currently, there are four operating mills, and one on standby, within 15mi 
of the property.  These all have excess milling capacity and represent toll milling opportunities.  
At present, it is considered more advantageous for SNS to negotiate an agreement to use some of 
that excess capacity than to build their own processing facility.  

3.6.10 Tailings Storage Area 

There are no tailing storage areas on site and no potential locations for tailings disposal within 
the current surface ownership.  If the proposed toll milling arrangement is realized, the tailings 
would be disposed at the toll milling facility. 

3.6.11 Waste Disposal Area 

The mine currently has a waste dump, referred as the North American dump.  Waste from 
exploration drifting by SNS has been placed on the dump.  There is ample capacity at this dump 
to accommodate near term underground development production.

4 History (Item 8) 
4.1 Ownership  

Three historic claim groups located sometime prior to 1908 underlie the current Project claims.  
These include the Alhambra group, the Crescent group, and the Big Creek group. 

The Big Creek group was located near the turn of the 20th Century, and was subject to a property 
dispute in 1908 between Big Creek Mining Company and North American Mining Company.  
This dispute was resolved in 1911 with Big Creek holding ownership.   

"During the period prior to 1922, the claims were owned by the Big Creek Mining Co. Ltd.  In 
1922, the mine workings from Big Creek No. 3 level to surface were leased to George Kinmouth 
and Associates...In the 1920's the Big Creek Mining Company went into receivership and the 
Bunker Hill and Sullivan Mining Company purchased the property at Sheriffs auction."  
(Radford 1985)  

Bunker Hill purchased the Crescent group in 1926 and the Alhambra group in 1937, thus 
consolidating the three historic claim groups under the Project ownership (Baldry 1981).   

In November 1982, the Bunker Hill Limited Partnership purchased the three claim groups 
underlying the Project from the Bunker Hill Company.  The upper workings from the Bud Level 
to surface were leased from 1984 to 1990 to Intermountain Mineral Engineers, Inc.  During this 
time, Bunker Hill Limited Partnership used the Crescent and Big Creek claim groups as 
collateral for outstanding debts to Fausett International, Inc.  The partnership eventually 
defaulted on their debt and Fausett took possession of the two claim groups now constituting the 
modified Project property in June 1992.  The Project was leased for a period (c. 1995) to Royal 
Silver Mines, Inc.  In September 2001, Shoshone County took possession of the mine from 
Fausett in lieu of payment of back taxes. 

4.2 Past Exploration and Development 

Julihn and Horton (1936) reported that "Development work was begun on the Alhambra claim 
group by 1893".  This group was explored by several workings from the Elk Creek drainage, 
including upper and lower Alhambra tunnels.  The lower tunnel drifted east on the Alhambra 
fault to the property line with the Crescent group sometime prior to 1913.   

Development on the Big Creek group began in about 1916 by four main tunnels from the Big 
Creek drainage.  By 1922, ore was being produced from these tunnels, known as the "Anderson 
Mine".  The (lower) Alhambra tunnel was connected to the Big Creek No. 4 tunnel prior to 1928. 

Bunker Hill embarked on major development projects after acquisition of the Crescent and Big 
Creek claims in 1926.  Between January 1929 and February 1930, the 5,000ft long Hooper 
tunnel was run from surface on the Big Creek drainage to, and along, the Alhambra fault.  By the 
time the mine temporarily closed in 1943, the Ellis Shaft had been sunk from the Hooper level to 
the 1200 Level, and the Alhambra raise was driven from the Hooper level to the Alhambra 
tunnel level 550ft above. 

When the mine reopened in 1951, the Ellis shaft was deepened to the 3100 Level.  The Yreka 
United crosscut was run a distance over 2mi between the Bunker Hill Mine and the Project on 
the 3100 Level.  A vertical shaft, the Crescent No. 2 shaft, was sunk from the 3100 Level to 
below the 4100 Level.  The 4300 Level, the lowest in the mine, was developed by a decline with

rubber-tired equipment from the 4100 Level.  Figure 4-1 is a long section showing the 
development within the Project with respect to the nearby Bunker Hill and Sunshine Mines. 

4.3 Historic Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates 

Bunker Hill calculated reserves on an annual basis, using industry-accepted standards of the 
period.  Between 1982 and 1985 under the Limited Partnership ownership, reserves were not 
calculated regularly, but a formal reserve estimation was completed in 1983, and an "informal 
review" was done in 1986 (Dalton 1986).  This latter document states a "proven and probable" 
reserve of 112,756t at 25.3oz/t Ag, and was authored by technical staff that calculated the 
Bunker Hill reserves.  This historical reserve is located primarily in the lower levels of the mine, 
which are currently flooded.  SNS has no intentions at this time to dewater these levels and 
establish access to these areas.  This is a historic reserve estimate made prior to implementation 
of NI 43-101 standards, and should not be relied upon.  It is presented here only for 
suggesting the potential magnitude of exploration targets on the property.   

4.4 Historic Production 

None of the historic production areas are located within the areas of the current resource 
estimation of this report.  Production in the Big Creek, or "Anderson" Mine, appears to have 
been from several veins, one along the Alhambra fault (the "fault vein"), and two in the hanging 
wall of the Alhambra.  A 1922 internal memo refers to on-going production from two stopes, the 
"silver stope", and the "lead stope".  This document notes that 1,199t of material containing 
33,488 pounds of lead and 128,078oz silver (1.4% Pb and 107oz/t Ag) was produced from above 
the No. 3 tunnel level (Anderson, 1922).  A series of "Crescent Mine" memos from H. M Childs 
to Stanley Easton, dated 1928 and 1929, reports progress on stoping and drifting, including the 
East Bud, West Bud, and Brooks stopes.  These reports also mention the "Old Taylor Stope". 

Most of the documented production occurred in the period 1951 to 1981 under the ownership of 
Bunker Hill Mining Co.  

A 1982, Bunker Hill Compilation Report states that the Project produced a total of 25,139,655oz 
of Ag from 978,750t of material at an average grade of 27.0oz/t Ag between the period 1917 and 
1981.  Approximately 700,000t of this material was mined from the lower part of the mine. 

In 1980, Bunker Hill excavated 42,564t from the Big Creek No.3, No.4 and North American 
dumps.  This material averaged 2.05oz/t Ag, and yielded 67,767oz of Ag (Radford, personal 
communication; Radford, 1983, Bunker Hill annual report 1980). 

Very limited production occurred from 1983 to 1985.  None of the areas of historic production 
are located within the areas of the current resource estimation of this report. 

4.5 Historic Metallurgy 

A 120t/d concentrator operated on the property prior to 1940.  A typical concentrate analysis 
from an average feed grade of 25oz/t Ag is as follows: 

 250oz/t Ag; 

 29% Fe; 

 32% S; 

 6% Pb;

"The sulphide ores from the Crescent are well-adapted to flotation; a recovery of 95 percent of 
the silver is made when sulphides alone are treated, but with mixed sulphides and oxides the 
recovery ranges from 80 to 85 percent.  As the recovery in milling oxidized ores is relatively 
poor, high-grade ore from the oxidized zone, averaging 100 ounces silver per ton, is sorted out 
in the stopes and shipped directly to the Bunker Hill and Sullivan smelter."  (Julihn and Horton 
1936).

5 Geologic Setting (Item 9) 
5.1 Regional Geology 

The regional geology is dominated by Precambrian sedimentary rocks of the Belt Supergroup 
(Belt), which have been strongly deformed during the Cretaceous age Sevier Orogeny.  This 
regional deformation has resulted in large-scale folds cut by numerous west to-northwest striking 
faults and veins. 

During the Middle Proterozoic, the area was dominated by a large intra-cratonic basin that was 
subsiding along syn-sedimentary faults.  The basin sediments range in age from about 1,470Ma 
to 1,400Ma and are composed of medium to fine- grained clastic and carbonate bearing clastic 
rocks.  The oldest consist of the Lower Belt sequence, Prichard Formation, a deep water 
argillite/siltite unit up to 12,000ft thick.  The Ravalli Group, consisting of quartzites and siltites 
up to 8,000ft thick and deposited in a shallow water environment, overlies this.  These are 
overlain by the Middle Belt Carbonate, comprised of shallow water dolomitic quartzites and 
arenaceous dolomites up to 6,500ft thick.  The youngest sediments are the Missoula Group, a 
shallow water sequence of inter-bedded quartzite and argillite up to 1,500ft thick. 

These sediments are believed to have remained relatively stable until approximately 1,350Ma 
when portions of the basin were affected by compressional tectonics of the East Kootenay 
Orogeny.  This orogeny was followed by rifting of the basin during the late Proterozoic-early 
Paleozoic when large portions of the sediments were transported away and the western margin of 
North America was developed.   

The next major tectonic event occurred during the Cretaceous Sevier Orogeny.  Early 
compressional tectonics dominated the area forming large-scale folds, reverse and thrust faults.  
Many of these structures were focused along the west-northwest trending Lewis and Clark Line.  
This is a regional, deep seated, lineament believed to represent an intra-plate boundary which has 
been recurrently active since the Proterozoic.  During the late Cretaceous, the Bitterroot Lobe of 
the Idaho Batholith was emplaced to the south, accompanied by dike emplacement in this area 
and normal movement along earlier reverse faults.  The major mineralization event is believed to 
have occurred during the compressional phase of the Sevier Orogeny.  The most recent tectonic 
activity is believed to have occurred during the Tertiary when the Lewis and Clark lineament 
was reactivated along the Osburn Fault.  This event resulted in 16mi of right lateral, strike slip 
movement that has dissected and displaced many of the ore deposits in the region (Hobbs et al. 
1965; Lewis et al., 2002). 

5.2 Local Geology 

5.2.1 Local Lithology 

The Coeur d'Alene mining district lies within a broad area of lightly metamorphosed, Middle 
Proterozoic fine-grained sediments termed the Belt Super Group (Figures 5-1 and 5-2).  These 
sediments locally accumulated to a thickness of 55,000ft or more.   

The Prichard Formation is the lowermost exposed unit and is sub-divided into two parts; the 
Lower and the Upper.  The Lower part is composed of thin to thick bedded, medium gray 
argillite and quartzose argillite, laminated in part with some discontinuous quartzite zones.  
Pyrite is abundant.  The Upper part is comprised of inter-bedded medium-gray argillite and 



United Mine Services, Inc.  5-2 
Crescent Mine   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  May 21, 2010 
Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

quartzose argillite and light gray impure to pure quartzite.  The base of the Prichard is not 
exposed. 

Above the Prichard lie the Ravalli Group rocks.  These are subdivided into the Burke, Revett,  
and St. Regis Formations.  The Burke and Revett are characterized by thick-bedded quartzites 
interbedded with siltite-argillites, while the St. Regis is composed of siltite-argillite.  The St. 
Regis is characterized by abundant mud cracks and mud chips, and by its purple color.  

The Wallace Formation is the lowermost unit of the Middle Belt Carbonate in the district; it 
overlies the Ravalli Group and is sub-divided into an Upper and Lower part.  The Lower Wallace 
is composed of gray and greenish gray siltite-argillites and argillites.  The Wallace is 
distinguished from the St. Regis by the presence of dolomitic silt and the lack of purple color, as 
well as by more subtle differences in bedforms.  The Upper Wallace is medium to greenish-gray 
finely laminated argillite.  It contains some arenaceous dolomite and impure quartzite and minor 
gray dolomite and limestone. 

The Missoula Group is locally represented by the Striped Peak Formation.  This unit includes 
inter-bedded quartzite and argillite with some arenaceous quartzite.  The Striped Peak Formation 
is not exposed at the Project area. 

Regional igneous rocks are represented by large granitic batholiths of Cretaceous age.  The 
Bitterroot Lobe of the Idaho Batholith is located to the south, and the Kaniksu Batholith is 
located to the northwest.  Within the district, a series of small monzonitic stocks were intruded 
coeval to batholith development.  Igneous dikes of many compositions including lamprophyre, 
diabase, and diorite, occur in insignificant volumes.  Some of the dikes are associated with the 
monzonitic stocks, but most are of unknown age (Hobbs et al 1965). 

5.2.2 Alteration 

Wall rock alteration associated with veining consists of changes in carbonate mineralogy plus 
sulfidation and silicification.  Ankerite is the typical disseminated carbonate phase found in 
unaltered wall rock.  Zoning is discernible with siderite adjacent to the vein, grading outward to a 
zone of mixed calcite and ankerite +/- siderite, to distal ankerite, only.  The siderite alteration 
may be found for tens to hundreds of feet from the veins. 

Pyritization of wall rocks is locally strong, and takes the form of fine-grained disseminated 
grains, and streaks of coarse grains.  Silicification occurs as silica-flooding and veining.  
Pyritization and silicification are favorable indications of higher grade mineralization but not 
necessarily correlative. 

Bleaching halos occur around veins that cut purple sediments as a result of destruction of the 
hematite by hydrothermal fluids penetrating the wall rock adjoining the veins.  The St. Regis is 
characterized by purple and maroon colors that result from finely disseminated earthy hematite.  
Subordinate volumes of the Revett are colored by hematite as well.  The bleaching is not evident 
in rocks that were originally green, but a line of euhedral pyrite is often found at the bleaching 
front no matter what the original rock color was.  The bleaching front in purple rocks is often 
"peppered" by very fine octahedral magnetite (White, 1998b; Strand, 2002). 

Both the Alhambra and South Veins are partly oxidized.  The Alhambra fault and vein zone 
displays a normal oxidation pattern from surface to a depth of 250 to 300ft below surface.  The 
South vein has a 200 to 400ft wide zone of oxidation plunging down dip, parallel to the

Crescent Mine   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  May 21, 2010 
Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

mineralization.  The oxidation fluids appear to be following the mineralized portion of the 
structure, or may be an indication of an intersecting fault. 

5.2.3 Structure 

The Coeur d'Alene district hosts structural deformation features related to compressional, 
extensional and trans-current movement.  The district is located at the intersection of two 
predominant linear belts of deformation.  The Lewis and Clark Line (LCL) is a 30mi-wide zone 
of tectonism that extends more than 200mi from western Idaho into western Montana.  This 
regional tectonic zone trends west to northwest and is a deep-seated lineament believed to 
represent an intra-plate boundary, which has been recurrently active since the Proterozoic era.  
The Noxon Line is a north to northwest trending structural high that is partly defined by thinning 
of Belt stratigraphy.  This feature extends from southern British Columbia south to the LCL.   

White (1994) identified five deformation events within the district listed in chronologic order as: 

1. Folds trending west-northwest. 

2. Folds trending north. 

3. Reverse faulting. 

4. Normal faulting along earlier reverse faults. 

5. Right lateral strike slip faulting mainly represented by the Osburn Fault. 

The west to northwest trending folds are interpreted to be related to deformation along the LCL.  
A younger and separate tectonic event is responsible for the north trending folds.  This are 
generally more pronounced north of the district within the Noxon Line.  The structural 
deformation within the Coeur d' Alene Mining District is dominated by the tectonic fabric of the 
LCL.  The reverse movement is seen predominantly along west-northwest striking faults.  White 
(1998b) postulated that the faults and veins developed along metamorphic shear fabric related to 
west northwest-trending reverse faults.  These same fabrics appear to have been re-activated 
during an extensional event producing normal movement.  The final deformation was right 
lateral displacement along the Osburn Fault, which displaces the mineralization.  This 
displacement is the only transcurrent movement well-documented in the district and resulted in 
approximately 16mi of offset (White 1998b). 

5.3 Project Geology 

The predominant fault at the Project is the Alhambra reverse fault.  This structure displaces the 
stratigraphy of the mine area by approximately 3,000ft such that the St Regis units in the hanging 
wall are in fault contact with Wallace Formation in the foot wall and Revett within the hanging 
wall lies adjacent to St Regis in the foot wall.   

The Project has been historically explored along five main mineralized structures.  These are the 
Alhambra, South Vein, East Footwall, Hook and BJ.  The current resource estimation includes 
only mineralization above the 2,450ft elevation within the Alhambra and South Veins.  The 
Alhambra vein is located in the immediate hanging wall of the Alhambra reverse fault above the 
1,500ft elevation, and in the immediate footwall below that elevation.  The South Vein is located 
800-1,000ft into the hanging wall of the Alhambra Fault.  The East Footwall, Hook, and BJ veins 
are all located in the footwall of the Alhambra Fault.

6 Deposit Type (Item 10) 
Precious metal deposits like those found at the Project generally have formed as a result of 
hydrothermal processes but differ as to whether the deposit was formed within a  predominantly 
mesothermal or epithermal environment.  Waldemar Lindgren first subdivided the genetic 
processes of hydrothermal mineralization in 1933 as epithermal, mesothermal and hypothermal.  
This classification was used primarily to describe the depth of formation and the source of 
mineralizing fluids. 

Epithermal deposits are generally believed to have developed by ascending fluids of igneous 
emanations.  They typically are formed at depths less than 3,300ft under low confining pressures 
with temperatures up to 300°C.  Veins are the most common host, but disseminated 
mineralization also occurs.  Gold and silver are the most common ore minerals with silver 
typically more abundant than gold.  The gangue mineralogy is typically quartz and calcite, at 
depth adularia can occur.  Hydrothermal alteration is pronounced, with abundant silicification 
flanked by clay alteration (Panteleyev 1988). 

Mesothermal deposits are generally believed to have developed deeper than epithermal deposits, 
generally between 4,000 to 12,000ft below surface under higher pressures and at temperatures 
between 175 to 300°C.  The source of fluids is believed to be prograde metamorphism and 
dewatering of deep crustal material.  They are characterized by gold greater than silver with 
associated base metals.  Gangue mineralogy consists of crystalline white quartz commonly with 
ankerite.  Fuchsite alteration is also common especially within more basic host units.  Pyrite and 
or pyrrhotite can also be present.  

6.1 Geological Model 

There is a general consensus among district geologists that the mineralization within the Coeur 
d'Alene mining district has formed as a result of mesothermal processes.  The mineralization is 
characterized by steep, narrow veins that contain economic concentrations of sphalerite, 
tetrahedrite, and galena, introduced as discrete pulses within the same hydrothermal event.  The 
mines are loosely subdivided into; silver rich and lead/zinc rich.  The silver mines generally host 
tetrahedrite as the principal silver bearing mineral, silver within galena is subordinate.  The 
lead/zinc mines generally host galena and sphalerite.   

Fleck et al (2002) have documented that mineralization in the district was related to a complex 
metamorphic/hydrothermal event and that the source of metals was likely from scavenging 
within the Belt sediments.  Wavra et al (1994) demonstrated that silver mineralization in the 
Sunshine Mine occurred during a compressional, reverse slip tectonic/metamorphic event with 
higher grade shoots plunging steeply southwest.  White (1998b) supports this observation and 
postulates that the faults and veins developed within zones of intensified shearing where 
mechanically generated heat caused dynamic metamorphism.  There is general agreement among 
all modern researchers that this mineralizing event occurred in the Late Cretaceous after major 
folding.   

The district has a regional zonation defined by base and precious metals.  All mines located to 
the north of the Osburn Fault, and those located in the southwestern part of the district are 
typically dominated by galena and/or sphalerite mineralization and producing lead/zinc.  The 
mines in the southeastern part of the district are known as the "Silver Belt" and are dominated by 
tetrahedrite mineralization.

The Project is the westernmost of the Silver Belt mines, which, from east to west, include the 
Galena, the Coeur, the Coeur d'Alene, the Silver Summit, the Polaris and the Sunshine Mines.  
These mines are typified by siderite-tetrahedrite veins, with local galena zones.   

By removing the post mineralization displacement along the Osburn Fault and reconstructing the 
district, a coherent zoning pattern is seen.  This shows distinct zoning of siderite-tetrahedrite 
mineralization in the east, changing to galena and sphalerite mineralization in the west.  To date, 
there is no plausible explanation as to why this zoning occurs.

7 Mineralization (Item 11) 
7.1 Mineralogy 

The "Silver Belt" veins are composed of siderite, quartz, and various sulfides including pyrite, 
tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite, and galena.  Most of the silver is found within the tetrahedrite, which 
is argentiferous (silver bearing) throughout the district.  It generally contains between 2% and 
6% silver by weight.  Substantial amounts of silver are also recovered from galena.  In some 
silver mines of the District, chalcopyrite contributes recoverable copper.   

Hershey (1916) believed supergene processes have enhanced the silver grades of some of the 
oxidized ore.  Secondary oxide minerals that have been noted historically include cerargyrite, 
native silver, cerrusite, malachite, cuprite, argentite, chalcocite, and pyromorphite. 

Primary hydrothermal zoning within veins has not been demonstrated in the district, with the 
exception of two veins in which the iron content of the sphalerite varied with depth.  In one vein, 
the iron content increased with depth, and in the other, it decreased with depth (Fryklund, 1964).   

Mineral zoning has been described in historical reports.  This observation was later explained by 
the superimposition of mineral concentrations formed by several mineralizing pulses, rather than 
the result of a single hydrothermal fluid evolving in composition as it traveled upward.   

7.2 Mineralized Zones 

The Project has been historically explored and/or exploited along five mineralized structures.  
These include the Alhambra and associated hanging wall veins, South Vein, East Footwall, Hook 
and BJ.  The current resource estimation includes only mineralization above the 2,450ft elevation 
within the Alhambra and South Veins.  The Alhambra vein is located in the immediate hanging 
wall of the Alhambra reverse fault above the 1,500ft elevation, and in the immediate footwall 
below that elevation.  The South Vein is located within the hanging wall of the Alhambra Fault.  
The East Footwall, Hook, and BJ veins are all located in the footwall of the Alhambra Fault.      

7.3 Surrounding Rock Types 

The Precambrian age Belt Supergroup rocks host all of the mineralized veins at the Project.  The 
three Belt units present include; Wallace, St. Regis and Revett Formations.  Detailed lithologic 
mapping has not yet been completed to know exactly where the formation boundaries lie with 
respect to the mineralized veins. 

7.4 Relevant Geological Controls 

The west-northwest striking, steeply south dipping veins are the principal geologic control on 
mineralization.  Many of these show disseminated sulfides in the adjacent wall rocks and for 
years a lively debate was carried on as to whether mineralization within the veins formed from 
local mobilization of metals from the immediate wall rocks.  Recently, the favored hypothesis is 
that the metals were mobilized from Belt sediments at depth and then transported by 
metamorphic/hydrothermal fluids to the veins (White 1998b, Fleck et al 2002).   

The Prichard Formation regionally carries anomalous metal values, leading some observers to 
compare it to the Kupferschiefer of Europe.  This unit is not however an important host for 
Coeur d'Alene-type veins.  Most of the production from the district has been from veins hosted 
within the overlying Ravalli Group rocks.  A district wide compilation by Farmin (1975) 



United Mine Services, Inc.  7-2 
Crescent Mine   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  May 21, 2010 
Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

attributes 75% of all metal production to veins hosted within the Revett and St. Regis 
Formations. 

Historically, district style exploration consisted of tracing major faults and shear zones, and 
exploring them where they cut favorable stratigraphy.  Past geologists at the Project have 
considered the quartzites of the Revett Formation to be the most favorable vein host, while 
geologists at the neighboring Sunshine Mine have considered the St. Regis Formation to be the 
most favorable vein host (Colson, 1958).  At the nearby Bunker Hill lead/zinc Mine, a systematic 
geologic research program in the 1970's identified the thick, clean quartzite of the Upper Revett 
Formation as the most favorable vein host (White, 1977a; Juras, 1977).  At present, SNS 
geologists at the Project consider both St. Regis and Revett to be favorable lithologies to host 
silver bearing veins. 

Approximately 98% of the Silver Belt production has been from veins hosted within the St. 
Regis and Revett Formations.  Defining the split between these two units is problematic for two 
reasons.  First, lithologic labels have evolved through time.  Older mapping, prior to the 1970's, 
described all of the rocks of both formations as "quartzites", distinguishing them as "thick-
bedded" or "thin-bedded".  Second, the location of the Revett/St. Regis boundary, as determined 
by modern mapping, does not always agree with that identified in historic mapping.  Much of the 
discrepancy in correlation is due to rapid facies changes particularly the rapid pinching out of 
individual quartzite beds.  White and Winston (1977) point out that historically, all siltite-
argillites were assumed to be St. Regis Formation however, the quartzite dominated Revett 
Formation does contain significant amounts of siltite-argillite which may be misinterpreted.   

Determining the exact formation name of a given interval is of less importance than identifying 
the lithologic character of the rock.  Examples of stratigraphic control to vein development are 
observed throughout the district.  Next door in the Sunshine Mine, these relations suggest that 
larger, higher grade veins favor either quartzite-dominant intervals or siltite-argillite-dominant 
intervals, but not intermixed intervals of both lithologies.  Two other examples of stratigraphic 
control of vein development are found in the Lucky Friday Mine.  The Lucky Friday Vein 
contains argentiferous galena and sphalerite over 5,000ft of vertical extent.  The vein is thickest 
and richest in the quartzites of the Upper and Lower Revett, but thins where it cuts the 
intervening siltite-argillite dominated Middle Revett.  The nearby Silver Vein contains siderite 
and tetrahedrite, and cuts a similar stratigraphic interval, but displays opposite characteristics.  It 
is thicker in the siltite-argillite and thinner in the quartzite.  These observations suggests that 
rheological properties of the rocks may have varied during the differing pulses of mineralization.   

7.5 Type, Character and Distribution of Mineralization 

The Silver Belt can be described as a corridor of structural preparation parallel to the LCL and 
south of the Osburn Fault.  The mineralization of economic value here is confined to discrete 
veins and veinlets of siderite, quartz and tetrahedrite.  The tetrahedrite typically fills a fine 
fracture pattern within siderite and very rarely occurs as disseminated grains in wall rock.   

Galena occurs within the siderite and quartz veins as isolated grains or fine- to coarse-grained 
streaks.  It also occurs as disseminated zones in quartzose wall rocks described locally as "blue 
rock" which may contain up to a few percent lead.  Most of the galena mineralization exhibits 
crosscutting relations that dates it later than the siderite-tetrahedrite veining.  District wide, the 
galena contains a baseline content of 0.12% silver present as a coupled substitution with 
antimony in the galena structure.

Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

Mineralized zones in the district generally have more vertical than lateral extent.  Historic 
stoping in the Project suggests that the higher grade mineralization has vertical:lateral ratios of 
between 2.5:1 to 4:1.  The mineralized zones plunge down dip, parallel to the shear lineation 
developed during the same deformation that brackets the mineralization. 

The large productive veins of the Silver Belt strike west-northwest and dip steeply to the south.  
They occur along major faults or as "links" between these.  A less common style of veining is 
splay structures that occur at fault bends in the hanging wall or footwall.  These zones are 
typically short in strike length, but very high grade.   

In the Project, silver mineralization has been mined on the Alhambra Fault from near surface to 
1,500ft below mean sea level, a vertical distance of about 5,000ft.  In the upper workings of the 
mine, above the 1,500ft elevation, the higher-grade mineralization occurs on the immediate 
hanging wall of the fault (Julihn and Horton, 1936), where the vein cuts Revett and St. Regis 
Formations.  The zones mined between mean sea level down to -1,500ft elevation occur on the 
immediate footwall in the Revett Formation.  The other significant production from the mine has 
been from a set of veins found within the footwall of the Alhambra Fault.  These include the East 
Footwall, the Hook, and the BJ veins.

8 Exploration (Item 12) 
8.1 Surveys and Investigations 

SNS has completed two years of diamond drilling at the Project targeting two principal areas of 
mineralization.  The first is the Alhambra Fault zone located west of the historic Brooks stope 
and above the Alhambra tunnel.  This area had been largely ignored since the mine's first closure 
in 1943.  SNS considered the area prospective because of the low-grade mineralization 
encountered along the fault on the Alhambra Level, and the presence of favorable stratigraphy on 
the hanging wall of the fault.  Surface drilling was necessary since the only underground 
development was located on the target structure. 

The second target is the up dip projection of the South Vein identified in the lower mine 
approximately 800ft into the hanging wall of the Alhambra Fault.  Several historic drill 
intercepts in the deeper levels prompted Bunker Hill to crosscut to it on the -500ft elevation and 
drift along the structure for about 600ft.  SNS targeted the projection of this structure at the upper 
mine levels where it cuts Revett and St. Regis Formations.  The drilling utilized underground 
platforms located on the Alhambra Fault at the Hooper Level and surface locations. 

Rehabilitation of the Hooper Tunnel began shortly after the property was acquired in January 
2007, and was completed in December 2007.  The tunnel was then extended 1,000ft further west 
along the Alhambra Fault.  Muck sampling of the new drift showed that the fault zone was 
weakly mineralized.  A 200t bulk sample was stockpiled and later processed as a bulk metallurgy 
test at the Sunshine mill in April of 2008.  Between April and August 2008, a second 
underground drill station was cut at the western end of the Hooper Tunnel Level and two 
additional crosscuts were driven into the hanging wall for drill stations.  Rehabilitation of the Big 
Creek No. 4 adit began in April 2007, and proceeded through the connection with the Alhambra 
Level to the top of the Alhambra raise by August 2008. 

During 2007 and 2008, SNS drilled a total of 103,215ft in 30 underground and 70 surface 
diamond drillholes targeting the Alhambra Fault and South Vein.  Figure 8-1 shows the 
distribution of the SNS drilling with respect to the historical underground development.  Several 
days of surface and underground mapping were also carried out during this time.    

8.2 Interpretation 

The exploration work conducted by SNS meets current industry standards.  The drilling program 
as described below, is of appropriate type, it was well planned and carried out in a prudent and 
careful manner.  All drill core logging and sampling has been done by trained and professional 
personnel.  SNS has made a concerted effort to ensure good sample quality and has maintained a 
careful chain of custody and ensured sample security from the drill rig to the assay laboratory. 

Significant exploration potential also exists in the lower levels of the mine, but SNS chose to 
explore first the near surface targets that would be accessible from surface or the Hooper Tunnel 
Level, and would not require dewatering the lower mine.

9 Drilling (Item 13) 
9.1 Type and Extent of Drilling 

One hundred diamond drillholes have been completed by SNS from surface and underground 
locations during 2007 and 2008.  A fan type-drilling pattern was used from most drill stations 
targeting the Alhambra Fault and South Veins on nominal 200ft spacing. 

During the summer of 2007, Atlas Fausett Contracting and Kettle Drilling, Inc. completed a 
surface drilling program.  A total of 41,081ft was drilled in 39 NQ diameter holes from 7 drill 
pads.  Between December 2007 and July 2008, Kettle Drilling Inc. completed an underground 
drilling program.  A total of 35,018ft was drilled in 29 NQ diameter holes and 1 HQ diameter 
hole from 3 drill stations.  These were all located within the Hooper Tunnel at an elevation of 
approximately 2,715ft targeting the South Vein.  In the summer of 2008, Kettle Drilling Inc. 
completed another surface program.  A total of 27,026ft in 31 NQ diameter holes were 
completed from four drill pads.  

Most of the holes were between 500ft and 2,000ft in length targeting one of two structures, either 
the Alhambra Fault or the South Vein.  The holes targeting the Alhambra Fault tested an area 
about 3,500ft along strike, from the surface down dip approximately 2,300ft.  The holes targeting 
the South Vein tested an area about 3,500ft along strike from surface down dip approximately 
2,500ft.  

9.2 Procedures 

9.2.1 2007 Surface Program 

The summer 2007 diamond drilling began with a single contractor, Atlas Fausett Contracting, 
Diamond Drilling (Atlas).  They began with a Longyear 38 (L-38) and the general progress was 
very slow.  Before long, it was decided that more drills were required.  Kettle Drilling Inc. 
(Kettle) was also hired.  They mobilized a Hagby-1500 on June 20, 2007 and started drilling two 
days later.  Atlas mobilized a second machine, a Hagby-1000 and it began work by July 1, 2007.   

After nearly two months of slow progress by Atlas, SNS decided to terminate the drilling 
contract.  Although they had less favorable ground conditions, they typically achieved no more 
than half the daily footage rate than Kettle.  The biggest problem appeared to be that the L-38 
broke down frequently, and Atlas had trouble making timely repairs.  The Atlas, Hagby-1000 
demobilized in late July after completing 1,600ft and the L-38 demobilized in early August after 
drilling 3,453ft. 

In mid July, Kettle mobilized a second drill, a U8-04 and started drilling both day and night 
shifts.  In late July, they brought in a third drill, a U8-03.  The three Kettle rigs finished out the 
season and were demobilized by the end of October.  

Down hole surveys were performed on all of the completed holes except drillhole SNS-706a, 
using a Flexit Multishot® survey tool.  SNS-706A was surveyed only with a single shot at 
1,000ft. 

Drill collars were originally laid out with a handheld GPS unit during the program.  The 
following year, most of the collars were resurveyed by Silver Valley Engineering, a registered 
land survey firm.

Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

9.2.2 Underground Drill Program 

Kettle Drilling was used for the underground program, which ran from December 2007 to July 
2008.  A U-8 drill was used to drill 30 holes totaling 35,108ft from three drill stations on the 
Hooper Level.  Down hole surveys were performed on all of the completed holes except H-102, 
using a Flexit Multishot® survey tool.  The underground drillhole collars were all surveyed by 
Mark Kochler, a professional mining engineer. 

9.2.3 2008 Surface Program 

Kettle Drilling was used again for the 2008 surface drilling program.  From June to August 2008, 
up to three drill rigs were running around the clock in order to take advantage of water supplied 
by seasonal runoff. 

A lightweight, Zinex A-5 drill began drilling on Alhambra Fault targets in June and completed 
its program in July.  The total footage from this machine was 13,713ft in 12 holes.  Two of these 
were not completed to the target depth.  A second lightweight, Longyear LF-70 began drilling 
South Vein targets in June and completed its program in August.  The total footage from this 
machine was 7,754ft in six holes.  A Hagby 1000 began drilling Alhambra vein targets in June 
and completed its program in July.  The total footage from this machine was 5,559ft in nine 
holes.  One of the holes was not completed to the target depth.  The U-8 drill was moved from 
underground onto the surface in August.  This rig completed 3,717ft in four holes during a one 
month period. 

Downhole surveys were performed on all of the completed holes using the Flexit Multishot® 
survey tool.  At the completion of the program, Silver Valley Engineering surveyed the drill 
collars and reported the coordinates in local mine grid.  They also used a high-precision GPS unit 
to tie the mine grid into the UTM-NAD 83 coordinates. 

9.2.4 Core Handling and Chain of Custody 

During the drilling operation, the core is retrieved from the core barrel and laid sequentially into  
cardboard core boxes.  Interval blocks are placed at all run breaks.  Once the box contains 
approximately 10ft of core, the ends and sides are labeled with drillhole identification, from and 
to intervals and the sequential box number.  The box is then covered by a cardboard lid and 
stacked at the rig to assure that the core is not exposed to any potential contamination or mix-
ups.  At the end of each drilling shift, the boxes of core are transported by the drilling contractor 
in a pickup truck or underground cart to the SNS core shed on site.  The drill contractors 
delivered core, at the end of each shift, to the core shed if geology staff were present.  If geology 
staff were not present, the core was placed in a locked annex building.  At this point, the core 
became the custody of SNS.   

9.3 Results 

A total of 100 drillholes totaling 103,215ft have been drilled by SNS from June 2007 through 
August 2008.  These holes confirm the presence of two steeply dipping mineralized structures, 
the Alhambra Fault and the South Vein, in the upper levels of the historic mine.  Along the 
Alhambra Fault, mineralization has been identified west of the historic workings from surface 
down dip to a maximum of 2,000ft.  On the South Vein, mineralization has been identified from 
surface to approximately 1,200ft below the surface.  Both structures are confined along strike in 
the elevations tested.  The Alhambra Vein is also confined at depth, but the South Vein remains

open in some areas.  The drillholes are oriented in a wide array of bearings and dips.  Few, if 
any, of the drillholes intercepted the vein at true right angles, and therefore the drill intercepts 
generally do not represent the true thickness of mineralization.

10 Sampling Method and Approach (Item 14) 
10.1 Sample Methods and Chain of Custody 

Upon receipt from the drilling contractor, SNS arranges the core sequentially from top to bottom.  
It is then processed to identify obvious zones of alteration and scanned by a hand held XRF 
analysis unit.  Core processing is the initial examination and photographing of the core upon its 
arrival at the core shed.  The purpose of the processing is to identify any mineralized intercepts, 
to spot potential errors in labeling or handling of core, and to photograph the core providing a 
record of its original character.  Core processing is utilized whenever the volume of core being 
produced exceeds the rate at which geologists can thoroughly log it, as was the case with the 
2008 program.  The boxes containing identified mineralization were marked and set aside; the 
remaining boxes were stacked on pallets and stored within one of two locked buildings, to be 
logged later when staff time allowed.  

Geologic logging is done on paper log forms with primary emphasis on the alteration and 
character of the veins.  The log form contains columns which record: from-to, core recovery, 
carbonate alteration, sulphide alteration, vein intensity, lithology, hardness and color.  After 
logging the zones of alteration, the sample intervals were determined and marked on the core and 
the core boxes.  The vein lithologies were sampled at nominal 1.2ft intervals and generally did 
not exceed 2.5ft.  The immediate wall rock lithologies were sampled at nominal 2.5ft intervals 
and did not exceed 5.0ft intervals.  Intervals were chosen on the basis of visual and XRF 
determinations of grade in an attempt to break out separate sample material that varied from 
adjacent material by orders of magnitude.  The sample intervals are recorded in three places; the 
sample log sheet, the sample tag booklets and on cards or flagging placed at each interval in the 
boxes.  A brief description of the sample was usually noted on a sample sheet inserted into the 
drill log.  Geotechnical logging includes core recovery and some rock quality determination of 
the vein zones.  The specific gravity of the core samples was measured using a pan balance as 
described in Section 16. 

Competent samples were generally sawn, though a few samples early in the program were split 
with a hydraulic splitter.  Incompetent material was split by hand using a putty knife.  Half of the 
cut core is then placed into a pre-labeled canvas bag.  The bag also contains a sample 
identification tag with a blind sample number.  Each bag is immediately tied closed.  A master 
list is maintained, which records the drillhole identification and from-to intervals of all sample 
tags.  The remaining half of the core is returned to the box for archive.  The archive boxes of half 
core are then stacked in one of the two locked core buildings.  The core is sorted by drillhole and 
sequential box number and a master inventory list is maintained.   

The individual canvas sample bags containing the core samples are accumulated into 5-gallon 
plastic buckets stored within the locked core building.  Once a bucket is full its lid is snapped 
closed and taped shut so that no tampering can occur.  A sample transmittal list is then compiled.  
The buckets of samples were transported by Federal Express or United Parcel Service to ALS 
Chemex in Reno, Nevada by standard transport truck.   

10.2 Factors Impacting Accuracy of Results 

The 2007-2008 drilling program was conducted by professional geologists and drillers who 
undoubtedly performed to the standards of the mining industry.  The core recovery as recorded 



United Mine Services, Inc.  10-2 
Crescent Mine   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  May 21, 2010 
Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

on the drill logs, shows that nearly all of the mineralized intervals produce core recovery in 
excess of 90%.  All of the potentially mineralized material was sampled as well as most of the 
adjacent wall rocks.  Such thorough sampling ensures that both mineralized and un-mineralized 
material is adequately characterized.  Based on the core recovery and thorough sampling 
methods, factors impacting accuracy of results are very positive. 

10.3 Sample Quality 

The core handling, logging and sampling procedures described above combined with excellent 
core recovery ensure that sample quality of the Project drilling is very good.  The sample length 
is appropriate to  characterize accurately the mineralization and to distinguish any zones internal 
to the mineralization, which may have anomalously high or low grades.   

10.4 Relevant Samples 

The relevant samples are from the veins and from stringer zones located within the adjacent wall 
rock.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
(Item 15) 

11.1 Sample Preparation and Assaying Methods 

During the 2007 to 2008 drill programs, SNS collected 1,465 drill core samples, and shipped 
them to a primary laboratory and three secondary laboratories.  A multi-element ICP analysis 
was first run and then all samples testing above ICP threshold for silver samples were re-
analyzed by fire assay.   

All of the half core samples were delivered to the primary lab for sample preparation and 
analysis.  Upon arrival, the samples are unpacked and arranged in order; which are then logged 
into the system by sample identification number.  Each sample bag is emptied into a clean metal 
sample tray and place into a drying oven at 60°C for approximately four hours.  The samples are 
then run through a primary jaw crusher and then a secondary cone crusher to produce a product 
with specifications of 70% less than 2mm in size.  The sample is then blended and run though a 
Jones riffle splitter to produce a 250g subsample.  The reject material is returned to the original 
sample bag and archived.  The 250g subsample is next run through a ring pulverizer to produce a 
product with specification of 85% less than 200 mesh.  The crushers, splitter and pulverizers are 
blown clean with an air hose after every sample and the sample preparation room is equipped 
with a dust collection system.  The blind sample tag accompanies the sample at each stage of 
preparation. 

The samples were analyzed by the primary lab using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic 
Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) for a suite of 35 elements.  A 0.2g portion of the pulp sample 
is first placed into a test tube and dissolved using an aqua regia digestion.  

A typical atomic absorption spectrometer consists of an appropriate light source (usually a 
hollow cathode lamp containing the element to be measured), an absorption path (usually a 
flame, but occasionally an absorption cell), a monochromator (to isolate the light of appropriate 
wavelength) and a detector.  The most common form of atomic absorption spectroscopy is called 
flame atomic absorption.  In this technique, a solution of the element of interest is drawn through 
a flame in order to generate the element in its atomic form.  At the same time, light from a 
hollow cathode lamp is passed through the flame and atomic absorption occurs.  The flame 
temperature can be varied by using different fuel and oxidant combinations; for example, a hotter 
flame is required for those elements, which resist atomisation by tending to form refractory 
oxides.  (ALS Chemex 2009) 

The primary limitation of IPC-AES is that all measurements are made following chemical 
dissolution of the element of interest.  Therefore, the measurement can only be as good as the 
quality of the sample digestion.  A second limitation is that occasionally, interferences from 
other elements or chemical species can impact atomic emission and depress absorbance, thereby 
reducing sensitivity.  For these reasons, most reputable laboratories (ALS Chemex included) 
recommend that ICP-AES not be used for reserve estimations or bankable feasibility studies. 

In general, an aqua regia digestion of relatively high silver-grade samples in the presence of lead 
can result in precipitation of silver chloride complexes which results in a solution under-
reporting true silver content.  Additionally, the ICP-AES instrument is designed for very low 
detection limits and solutions must be highly diluted to accurately measure higher concentrations 
of metals.  This can also have negative impact on the accuracy of the results.

SNS has made an effort to overcome this limitation by ensuring that all samples with silver 
mineralization in excess of 1,500ppm were re-analyzed by standard fire assay methods and they 
have conducted numerous duplicate fire assay analysis of samples originally analyzed by ICP.  
Any samples returning over the maximum detection limit for Ag, 100ppm, were then analyzed 
by "ore grade" ICP, and any samples returning over the ore grade maximum detection limit for 
Ag, 1,500ppm, were analyzed by fire assay.  The maximum detection limit for fire assay is 
10,000ppm Ag; only one sample in the data set exceeded this 1% limit.  The fire assay technique 
used a 30g charge with a gravimetric finish.  This fire assay method is appropriate for the silver 
grades defining the anomalous mineralization.   

In the opinion of the author, the analytical methods used to determine the silver content of the 
Project samples, combined with the QA/QC program described below, has produced results 
appropriate to support the current resource estimation and classification.  It is recommended that 
all samples with silver grades in excess of 1.0oz/t should be fire assayed. 

11.1.1 Testing Laboratories 

SNS began to generate core and chip samples in July 2007.  These early samples were submitted 
to two local labs for analysis, American Analytical in Osburn, Idaho, and Chris Christopherson 
in Smelterville, Idaho.  Following SRK's recommendation, in April of 2008 SNS began sending 
their samples only to accredited labs.  One batch of samples was sent to American Assay of 
Sparks, Nevada and from May 2008 on, all samples were sent to ALS Chemex.  All samples sent 
to ALS Chemex were prepared at the Sparks, Nevada facility and then analyzed at the North 
Vancouver Laboratory.  ALS Chemex located at 212 Brooksbank Ave in North Vancouver 
Canada is certified under ISO 9001:2000 for the provision of assay and geochemical services 
according to QMI Management Systems Registration.    

11.2 Quality Controls and Quality Assurance 

Following SRK's recommendations, SNS began to use standard reference material, blank 
samples and duplicate samples in April 2008 to ensure reliable assay data was being obtained. 

11.2.1 Standards and Blanks 

Commercial, standard reference material samples were inserted into the sample stream at 1 in 20 
intervals, and were considered to have "failed" if the lab returned an assay outside 3-standard 
deviations of the certified value.  The initial failure rate of standards in the ALS Chemex 
analyses was 13% but this did improve over time.  Failed standards were handled by rerunning 
the entire sample batch containing the failure.  In most cases, the rerun standard passed and the 
rerun data was used in the final database.  The failures and subsequent corrective action have 
been individually documented by SNS.  The sample failures typically consisted of values a few 
percent outside the tolerance range, but there were two instances of obvious sample switching.  
In one case, Chemex confirmed the switch, and the data was corrected.  In another case, a rerun 
was made from the coarse rejects, and the rerun showed additional switched samples.  This data 
was rejected, and not replaced.  The results of the various silver standard analyses are shown in 
Figure 11-1.   

Commercial blank samples were also inserted into the sample stream at 1 in 20 intervals, and 
were considered to have "failed" if the lab returned an assay greater than 5ppm.  Only one failure 
occurred in 80 blanks, apparently because of a switched sample.  Because the commercial blanks 
are pulverized material, and the blanks do not act as a check of possible contamination in the 



United Mine Services, Inc.  11-3 
Crescent Mine   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  May 21, 2010 
Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

pulverizing stage, a small number of "field blanks" comprised of barren core were also inserted 
in the sample stream.  There were no failures of field blanks. 

11.2.2 Duplicate Samples 

Three types of duplicate analysis were run by SNS.  These include:  1) coarse rejects prepared 
and analyzed at the primary lab and then shipped to a second lab where they were split, 
pulverized and analyzed; 2) pulps prepared and analyzed at the primary lab and then shipped to a 
second lab and analyzed; and 3) field duplicates created from ¼ core samples of the original ½ 
core intervals.   

A total of 119 coarse reject duplicate samples were analyzed.  These consisted of 58 samples 
from the non-accredited labs and 54 samples from ALS Chemex.  All of these were re-analyzed 
by ALS Chemex.  The results of the 58 samples from the non-accredited lab show good 
correlation to the duplicate analysis generated by ALS Chemex as shown in Figure 11-2.  The 
ALS Chemex duplicates also showed very good correlation.    

Thirty-five pulp samples prepared and analyzed by ALS Chemex were sent to SGS Mineral 
Services of Lakefield, Ontario, and analyzed by fire assay.  The samples were predominantly 
chosen from the higher-grade samples because of their significance in the resource estimation.  
The SGS results agree reasonably well with the Chemex data (Figure 11-3).  The SGS numbers 
range from 42% higher to 20% lower, and average 4% lower than the Chemex results.  While the 
SGS numbers are all fire assays, the Chemex numbers are a combination of both fire assay and 
ICP. 

Thirty-six field duplicate samples were collected to provide a further check on the 2007 
analytical data.  These were generated by ¼ core samples taken from previously sampled vein 
intervals.  The field duplicates were all prepared and analyzed by ALS Chemex.  These re-
samples were also selected from higher-grade intervals that would figure prominently in the 
resource estimation and were chosen to replicate the intervals of the earlier sampling.  This was 
sometimes difficult, as the original intervals from the early sampling were not always well 
preserved in the core boxes.  The results shown in Figure 11-4 indicate a reasonable correlation 
between the two sample results. 

11.3 Interpretation 

The sampling techniques and analytical procedures employed by SNS are adequate for the 
current level of study.  Core drilling is an excellent method to obtain high-quality geologic data 
and the high core recoveries realized here also produce an excellent sample for analysis.  Half 
core sampling is a standard procedure and SNS has ensured that an accountable chain of custody 
tracked all samples.  The ICP-AES combined with fire assay and a good QA/QC program is an 
acceptable method of analysis for silver analysis.  Although some of the original samples were 
analyzed, at non-certified laboratories, the check samples run at ALS Chemex and SGS have 
produced verifiable results within the level of accuracy expected.  The QA/QC procedures 
employed by SNS meet CIM guidelines for resource estimation.  It is recommended that 
approximately 50 samples above a 2.0oz/t silver grade threshold should be re-analyzed using a 
fire assay technique to check for analysis bias.

12 Data Verification (Item 16) 
12.1 Quality Control Measures and Procedures 

The database used for the resource estimate was constructed by SNS and verified by SRK.  It is 
considered to be of high quality.  The database was constructed in three main divisions; drillhole 
locations with orientations, lithological characteristics and analytical results.  The collar 
locations, orientations, down hole deviations, assay sample intervals and lithological types were 
all accumulated onto an MS Excel® spreadsheet.  These were transmitted to SRK along with 
scanned copies of all source data.  The original signed, Adobe® .pdf copies of the assay 
certificates were spot verified to the final electronic assay database and no errors were found.   

12.2 Limitations 

The database prepared by SNS and verified by SRK relies on the industry professionalism of 
information supplied by SNS and from the assay laboratories.  SRK has used the data with 
utmost regards to accurate transfer, but does not take responsibility for the quality of the source 
data.

13 Adjacent Properties (Item 17) 
The Project property is situated at the west end of the Silver Belt located between the Sunshine

14 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
(Item 18) 

14.1 Mineral Processing/Metallurgical Testing Analysis 

A 200t bulk sample of very low-grade material was tested at Sterling Mining Company's 
Sunshine Mill in April 2008.  This sample is not representative of the mineralization expected to 
be mined but does provide a general indication of the materials amenability to grinding and 
floatation milling. 

14.1.1 Procedures 

The material for the bulk test came from the drifting on the Alhambra Fault on the west Hooper 
Level that was completed in April 2008.  A portable XRF unit was used to assess the grade on a 
round by round basis, and muck grading at least 5oz/t Ag was stockpiled in a separate area on the 
waste dump.  This material was then trucked the 0.5mi to the Sunshine Mill for processing.  All 
of the material was un-oxidized.  At the mill, the material was batched through the crushing, 
grinding and floatation circuits using the same general procedures as for ore from the Sunshine 
Mine. 

14.1.2 Results 

An 86% recovery was achieved from 203t with a feed grade of 3.28oz/t Ag.  Sterling's chief 
metallurgist believes that recoveries of 95% could be expected with additional testing and 
refinement of the milling process. 

14.2 SNS Specific Gravity Testing 

SNS determined specific gravity for a representative set of lithologic types using two techniques.  
One was the direct, weigh-in-air/weigh-in-water method; the other was to calculate the density 
based on chemical analysis.  

The direct measurement set-up consisted of a 2,600g capacity triple-beam balance set at the edge 
of a table so that samples could be weighed by hanging underneath the balance pan.  Specific 
gravity was computed from the formula: 

SG = Wt. air /(Wt. air - Wt. water) 

The specific gravity measurements were made on fragments of core generally weighing more 
than 50g, or in cases where an interval was more finely fragmented, up to six or so fragments 
would be aggregated and measured at once. 

Oxidized samples represent a special case, as they can contain visible void spaces.  These 
samples tend to produce bubbles over the time necessary to immerse the sample for the weight in 
water measurement.   

The measured density of wall rock is generally about 2.7g/cm3.  The veins have measured 
densities of about 3.0g/cm3 with ranges up to 4.0g/cm3.  There is not a good correlation between 
Ag content and density.   

A limited number of measurements on oxidized wall rock material returned densities of between 
2.3g/cm3 and 3.0g/cm3, with an average of 2.6g/cm3.  Measurements of 12 sample intervals in 



United Mine Services, Inc.  14-2 
Crescent Mine   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  May 21, 2010 
Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

oxidized vein material from five drillholes produce an average density of 2.89g/cm3, from a 
range of 2.66g/cm3 to 3.05g/cm3.  

SNS also calculated specific gravity from chemical analysis.  The samples sent to ALS Chemex 
were routinely analyzed under a 35-element ICP-AES package.  Because the mineralogy of the 
deposit is fairly simple, a first pass at calculating a specific gravity for each sample was made by: 

1. Assigning all the S to pyrite (density of 5.02g/cm3). 

2. Assigning any remaining Fe to siderite (density of 3.97g/cm3). 

3. Using a background wall rock density of 2.7g/cm3 for the remainder of the sample. 

This worked well for the un-oxidized samples as shown by a comparison of the calculated results 
with samples on which direct measurements were made.  Eighty-seven percent of the un-
oxidized samples (n=46) are within 10% of the values obtained by direct measurement.  In 
addition, the calculated number could be a better representation because the chemical analyses 
consider the entire sample, while the direct measurements could only be made on the larger 
fragments of core.  Refining of this calculation to account for other sulfides known to be present, 
such as arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite and galena, was deemed unnecessary; since they 
appear to be gravimetrically insignificant. 

The oxidized samples are not amenable to this method because variable oxidation has resulted in 
variable development of void spaces.  The specific gravities of the oxidized samples calculated 
by this method were significantly higher than the measured values, and thus these materials 
require direct measurement of their specific gravities. 

The densities of un-oxidized materials are predicted with reasonable accuracy by simple 
calculations based on the chemical analysis.  The calculated densities cannot, however, be used 
for the oxidized materials.   

Thirteen samples were sent to SGS Mineral Services in Lakefield, Ontario for density 
determination.  The numbers are within a maximum tolerance of 6% of SNS's direct 
measurements, and average less than 1% different.  The dataset validates SNS's methodology for 
measuring specific gravity.

15 Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserve 
Estimates (Item 19) 

15.1 Qualified Person of the Mineral Resource Estimate 

Dr. Bart Stryhas constructed the geologic and resource model discussed below.  Dr. Stryhas is 
responsible for the resource estimation methodology and the resource statement.  Dr. Stryhas is 
independent of the issuer applying all of the tests in Section 1.4 of the NI 43-101. 

15.2 Drillhole Database 

The drillhole database was compiled by SNS and is determined to be of high quality.  The 
database consists of three, MS Excel® spreadsheets containing collar locations surveyed in 
Bunker Hill Mine coordinates, drillhole orientations with down hole deviation surveys, and assay 
intervals with elemental analyses and material types.  The appropriate codes for missing samples 
and no recovery were used during the modeling procedures.   

The database contains information from 100 drillholes totaling 103,215ft of drilling.  The 
maximum drillhole depth is 1,964ft and the average is 1,030ft.  All holes were drilled inclined 
both to the north and south in order to intersect the veins at high angles to the strike and dip of 
the mineralization and maintain a nominal 200ft spacing on the vein.  Down hole deviations 
surveys were made on most of the holes using a Flexit Multishot® instrument.   

15.3 Geology 

The resource estimation is based on a generalized geologic model consisting of two vein 
structures, the Alhambra and South Veins.  These have a sheet like geometry, which ranges from 
1.0 to 20.0ft thick with an approximate average of about 3.0ft.  They have been drill testing 
along strike for 3,500ft and down dip for 2,300ft.  Both strike at azimuth 90°-100° and dip 70°-
76° south.  The geometry of each vein was first interpreted in cross section at every drillhole 
intercept.  A grade threshold of approximately 1.5oz/t Ag was used to determine the limits of the 
veins.  The cross sections were rectified in plan view and triangulated into 3-D wireframe solids.  
The wireframe solids were trimmed by two limiting boundaries.  The first is a mineral right 
defined by a surface 100ft below topography.  The second was an outline drawn in long section 
that trimmed the veins so that they extended no more than 200ft from any unconfined drillholes.  
This boundary formed a geologic constraint to limit the assignment of grade regardless of the 
search distance.  The wireframe solid shapes were used to code each vein into the block model.  
Only the blocks whose centroids were located within the vein wireframes were estimated.   

15.4 Block Model 

The block model was constructed within the Bunker Hill local mine grid coordinate limits listed 
in Table 15.4.1.  The blocking was done using a sub-cell scheme with a parent block size of a 
100ft cube and sub-block size down to a minimum of a 2ft cube.  The trimmed vein geometries 
as described above were used to sub-cell the block model.  The topographic surface was created 
from the elevation coordinates of the drill collars and from the digitized contours of the U.S. 
Geologic Survey topographic map, both supplied by SNS.  Soil depth to bedrock was not of 
concern because the veins were trimmed 100ft below topography in accordance to the upper 
limits of the mineral rights right.

Northing -3,000 -1,300 2 
Elevation 2,500 4,800 2 

 

15.5 Compositing 

The raw assay data was first filtered according to each vein and plotted on histogram and 
cumulative distribution graphs to understand its basic statistical distribution.  The histogram of 
the data from both veins shows a strong positive skewness.  The cumulative distribution curve of 
the Alhambra data illustrates a continuous population set up to 2,500ppm Ag.  Above this, five 
isolated outliers are present.  The cumulative distribution curve of the South Vein data illustrates 
a continuous population set up to 3,000ppm Ag.  Above this level, five isolated outliers are 
present.  The original assay lengths from within the veins range from 0.04 to 4.7ft with an 
average of 1.20ft.  For the modeling, these were composited into 2.0ft down hole lengths with 
breaks at the vein boundaries.  This length was chosen to smooth the original sample intervals 
and to accommodate the minimum block size.  During the compositing all raw assays over 
3,000ppm were capped at that level.  This resulted in six composites ranging from 3,953 to 
11,900ppm being reduced to 3,000ppm.  The effects of the capping was a 6% net reduction in 
metal in the sample database.    

15.6 Density 

SNS conducted a specific gravity study on the drill core to be used for the resource estimation.  
They performed direct measurements on 196 samples from within the two veins.  The data was 
filtered by vein and an average specific gravity was assigned to all material within each vein 
regardless of oxidation state.  The results are presented in Table 15.6.1.   

Table 15.6.1:  Vein Densities 

Vein Density (g/cm3) Density (t/ft3)
Alhambra 3.24 0.10122
South 3.01 0.09395

 

15.7 Variogram Analysis 

Variogram analysis was attempted on the composited data filtered to only the samples within 
each vein.  Due to the highly variable nature of the grade distributions and the relative paucity of 
data points, no meaningful variograms were constructed.  This is common in silver deposits of 
this type and does not necessary reflect negatively on the continuity of mineralization.  It simply 
indicates that over relatively short distances the grades can vary significantly.  Similar deposits 
have been mined successfully in the district for over one hundred years.     

15.8 Grade Estimation 

Geologic hard boundaries were used to confine the grade estimation to within each vein using 
only the composites from the same vein.  The confining boundaries described above were used to 
define the limits of the grade extrapolation.

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  May 21, 2010 
Crescent_NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources_202500 01_KG 008   

The grade estimate was completed using the inverse distance squared weighting algorithm, 
conducted in two passes.  The first required a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 samples which 
were less than 250ft from the block centroids.  The second pass only considered un-estimated 
blocks and required a minimum of 2 and maximum of 12 composites which were less than 500ft 
away from the block centroids.  During the estimation, the 2.0ft down hole composites were 
length weighted to accommodate for any short intervals at the vein margins.  No octant-search 
restriction was applied and no limit of the number of samples from a single drillhole was used.  
The results showed that an average of nine composites were used with an average distance of 
186ft to estimate the blocks.  A long section of the interpolated block model grades from each 
vein is shown in Figure 15-1 and 15-2.   

15.9 Model Validation 

Four techniques were used to evaluate the validity of the block model.  All four tests provided 
excellent confidence in the resource estimation.  First, the interpolated block grades were 
visually checked on sections for comparison to the composite assay grades.  Second, statistical 
comparisons were made between the interpolated block grades and composite data within each 
vein.  These results are presented in Table 15.9.1 and show block grades slightly less than 
composite grades as desired.  Third, swath plots were generated to compare model blocks and 
composite grades at regular section spacing through the deposit.  The results are presented in 
Figures 15-3 and 15-4.  These show an acceptable amount of grade smoothing with the majority 
of the block grades very close to the composite grades.  Fourth, a nearest neighbor estimation 
was run using a single composite to estimate each block within the same parameters used for the 
final model.  The total contained silver at a zero cut-off grade was compared in the final model at 
the same cut-off grade.  The final model contained 0.5% less metal than the nearest neighbor 
estimation, indicating that metal is not being manufactured during the modeling process.

15.10  Resource Classification 

The Mineral Resources are classified under the categories of Indicated and Inferred Mineral 
Resources according to CIM guidelines.  Classification of the resources reflects the relative 
confidence of the grade estimates.  This classification is based on several factors including; 
sample spacing relative to geological and geo-statistical observations regarding the continuity of 
mineralization, data verification to original sources, specific gravity determinations, accuracy of 
drill collar locations, accuracy of topographic surface, quality of the assay data and many other 
factors, which influence the confidence of the mineral estimation.  No single factor controls the 
resource classification rather each factor influences the result.  Generally, most of the factors 
influencing the resource classification in the Project are positive.  The resources have been 
classified as Indicated and Inferred based primarily on sample spacing as indicated by drilling

density.  For the resource classification, a solid shape was constructed around the parts of the 
veins where most drillholes are spaced approximately 150 to 200ft apart.  All blocks located 
within these areas were classified as indicated resource.  All blocks located outside of these 
areas, about the periphery of the drilling were classified as Inferred resource (Figures 15-5 and 
15-6). 

15.11  Mineral Resource Statement 

The Project mineral resource statement is presented in Table 15.11.1.  An 11.0oz/t cut-off grade 
was chosen for resource reporting based on cost data and cut-off grade being used at the nearby 
Sunshine Mine.  The results reported in the resource statement have been rounded to reflect the 
approximation of grade and quantity, which can be achieved at this level of resource estimation.

15.13  Reserve Estimation 

A prefeasibility study is required to demonstrate the economic merit of mineral resources in 
order for their conversion to reserve.  At this time, no such study has been completed and 
therefore the Project currently has no reserves.   

15.14  Material Affects on Mineral Resources 

The mineral resources described in Section 15.11 above, constitute contained metal in the ground 
and have not been included in any formal plan of exploitation.  There are no known material 
issues related to environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, 
political or other relevant issues which may affect the mineral resources.  Additionally, there are 
no known material issues related to mining, metallurgy, infrastructure and other relevant issues, 
which may affect the mineral resources.

16 Other Relevant Data and Information (Item 20) 
The lower Project underground workings are partially flooded at present.  This water level is 
controlled by the water maintained in the Bunker Hill Mine by the interconnected underground 
workings.  At present, Bunker Hill pumps to keep the water level at about the 2,000ft elevation, 
which is about 700ft below the Hooper Tunnel in the Project.  If Bunker Hill discontinues 
pumping, the water level will rise to no more than the daylight elevation of the Kellogg Tunnel at 
2,350ft elevation, which corresponds to 350ft below the Hooper Tunnel in the Project.  All the 
resources reported in this report are located above the Hooper Tunnel elevation. 

Zones of low-grade uranium mineralization are present within the veins of the Project.  The 
recent drilling encountered uranium mineralization grading as high as 2ft of 245ppm U.  Nine 
samples out of about 1,200 analyses returned 80 to 245ppm U; the remainder returned no greater 
than 40ppm U.  Elevated radon readings were noted by previous operators in a crosscut near the 
Ellis Shaft on the Hooper Level.  Proper mine ventilation should alleviate the buildup of any 
radon gasses.

17 Interpretation and Conclusions (Item 21) 
17.1 Field Surveys 

During the 2007 and 2008 field seasons, SNS conducted surface and underground diamond 
drilling on the Project.  Two mineralized veins were drill tested by 100 diamond core drillholes.  
These were carefully logged and 1,465 samples were taken and tested with 35-element ICP-AES 
analysis, all samples with Ag values in excess of 1,500ppm (43.8oz/t) were fire assayed.  The 
exploration work conducted by SNS meets current industry standards.  The exploration drilling 
program was well planned and carried out in a prudent and careful manner.  All drill core 
logging and sampling has been done by trained and professional personnel.  SNS has made a 
concerted effort to ensure good sample quality and has maintained a careful chain of custody and 
ensured sample security from the drill rig to the assay laboratory. 

17.2 Analytical and Testing Data 

SRK is of the opinion that the analytical work performed by ALS Chemex and the non-certified 
labs on the Project mineralization was good, and suitable for use in resource estimation.  The 
ICP-AES combined with fire assay and a good QA/QC program is an acceptable method of 
analysis for silver analysis.  Although some of the original samples were analyzed at non-
certified laboratories the check samples run at ALS Chemex and SGS have produced verifiable 
results within the level of accuracy expected.  It is recommended that all samples above a 1.0oz/t 
Ag threshold should be re-analyzed using a fire assay technique.    

SNS has conducted a modern QA/QC program including standard reference material, blanks and 
duplicate check assays on drill core from the 2007 and 2008 drilling programs.  This QA/QC 
program meets current CIM guidelines.  The results of the QA/QC program indicate that the 
reported analytical results meet the standards of precision and accuracy required to support the 
current resource estimation.   

17.3 Exploration Conclusions 

The exploration work conducted by SNS meets current industry standards.  The drilling program 
is of appropriate type, it was well planned and carried out in a prudent and careful manner.  All 
drill core logging and sampling has been done by trained and professional personnel.  SNS has 
made a concerted effort to ensure good sample quality and has maintained a careful chain of 
custody and ensured sample security from the drill rig to the assay laboratory. 

The 2007-2008 diamond drilling program targeted two mineralized veins.  The drilling was laid 
out for nominal 200ft drillhole spacing along the veins and adequately defines the zone of silver 
mineralization.  Both structures are confined along strike in the elevations tested.  The Alhambra 
Vein is also confined at depth, but the South Vein remains open in some areas. 

Significant exploration potential also exists in the lower levels of the mine, but SNS chose to 
explore first the near surface targets that would be accessible from surface or the Hooper Level, 
and would not require dewatering the lower mine. 

17.4 Resource Estimation 

The Project resource estimation is based on information from 100 drillholes totaling 103,215ft.  
The drillhole database was compiled by SNS, verified by SRK and is determined to be of high

quality.  Wire frame solids of the vein geometries were constructed based on a minimum grade 
threshold of 1.5oz/t Ag.  These solids were used to sub-cell each vein in the block model.  The 
blocking was done using a parent block size of a 100ft cube with sub-blocks down to a minimum 
of a 2ft cube.  The grade estimate was completed using the inverse distance squared weighting 
algorithm, conducted in two passes.  The first required a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 
samples which were less than 250ft from the block centroids.  The second pass only considered 
un-estimated blocks and required a minimum of 2 and maximum of 12 composites which were 
less than 500ft away from the block centroids.  

The results of the estimation provided a CIM classified Indicated Mineral Resource of 324kt of 
material with 18.7oz/t Ag and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 211kt of material with 19.5oz/t 
Ag, both based on an 11.0oz/t Ag cut-off grade.  The quality of the Project drilling and data is 
very good and the Mineral Resource was classified mainly according to the general drillhole 
spacing.   

17.5 Other Relevant Information 

The lower Project underground workings are partially flooded at present.  This water level is 
controlled by the water maintained in the Bunker Hill Mine by the interconnected underground 
workings.  At present, Bunker Hill pumps to keep their water level at about the 2,000ft elevation, 
which is about 700ft below the Hooper Tunnel in the Project.  If Bunker Hill discontinues 
pumping, the water level will rise to no more than the daylight elevation of the Kellogg Tunnel at 
2,350ft elevation, which corresponds to 350ft below the Hooper Tunnel in the Project.  All the 
resources reported in this report are located above the Hooper Tunnel elevation.

18 Recommendations (Item 22) 
18.1 Recommended Work Programs 

SRK recommends that UMS conduct five stages of work culminating in a Preliminary 
Assessment of the project.  Stage one would be to complete fire assays on approximately 50 
samples with reported ICP-AES silver grades over 2.0oz/t.  If the results show substantially 
different average silver grades then the remaining samples should be fire assayed and the results 
incorporated into a revised resource estimation.  Stage two would be to extend the Hooper 
Tunnel approximately 1,000ft and set up a drilling station.  Stage three would be to complete 
approximately 5,000ft of drilling into the down dip extension of the South Vein.  Stage four 
would be to complete bench scale metallurgical test work sufficient to support a Preliminary 
Assessment.  Stage five would be to revise the resource estimation and incorporate the result into 
a Preliminary Assessment.     

18.1.1 Proposed Budget 

The following budget outlined in Table 18.1.1.1 provides approximate cost for the fire assay 
program, resource revision and a typical cost for a scoping level economic evaluation.    

Table 18.1.1.1:  Summary of Proposed Activities and Approximate Costs (US$) 

Activity – Phase I Duration Approximate Cost(US$) 
Advance Hooper Tunnel and Drill South Vein Five months $850,000 
Fire Assay, Metallurgical Test Work, Preliminary Assessment Seven months $202,000 
Grand Total – Phase I Ten to Twelve Months $1,052,000

20.1 Mineral Resources and Reserves 

20.1.1 Mineral Resources 

The mineral resources and mineral reserves have been classified according to the "CIM 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines" (December 11, 
2005).  Accordingly, the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the 
Reserves have been classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated 
Resources as defined below.   

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized 
organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.   

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade 
or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and 
reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on 
limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely 
enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of 
the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade 
continuity. 

20.1.2 Mineral Reserves 

A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral 
Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include 
adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors 
that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.  A Mineral 
Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material 
is mined.

A 'Probable Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility 
Study.  This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 
economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 
extraction can be justified.   

A 'Proven Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource 
demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate 
information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified.
