1.0 SUMMARY 
 
Mine Development Associates ("MDA") has prepared this Technical Report on the Salave gold project, 
located in Asturias, Spain, at the request of Astur Gold Corporation ("Astur"), a Canadian company 
listed on the TSX Venture and Frankfurt exchanges.  The Salave project is 100% controlled by 
Exploraciones Mineras del Cantábrico S.L. ("EMC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Astur.  The purpose 
of this report is to provide a technical summary in support of an updated mineral resource estimate for 
the project that envisions potential underground extraction rather than open-pit or a combination of 
open-pit and underground mining.     
 
This report has been prepared in compliance with the disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in 
the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"), Companion Policy 
43-101CP, and Form 43-101F1, as well as with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum's "CIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and 
Guidelines" ("CIM Standards") adopted by the CIM Council on November 27, 2010. 
 
1.1 Property Description and Location 
 
The Salave gold project is located on the northern coast of Spain along the Bay of Biscay, approximately 
two kilometers east of the village of Tapia de Casariego in the western part of the Principality of 
Asturias.  The Salave property consists of five mining concessions, extensions of three of the 
concessions with what is referred to as "demasia ground," and an investigation permit that total 
approximately 3,427 hectares.  The registered owner of the mining concessions and the investigation 
permit is Astur's wholly owned subsidiary EMC. 
 
Should the Salave project proceed to development, Astur would owe: 

 $5 million to a previous operator within 10 days of acquiring all requisite surface rights and 
permits for development of the deposit; 

 $5 million within 10 days after commencement of commercial production of gold; 
 $5 million within 10 days after reaching an accumulated production of 200,000 ounces of gold; 
 $5 million within 10 days after reaching an accumulated production of 400,000 ounces;  
 $5 million within 10 days after reaching an accumulated production of 800,000 ounces; and 
 A net smelter return ("NSR") royalty of 5% on gold produced and sold when cumulative gold 

production exceeds 800,000 ounces.  Astur has the option to reduce the NSR royalty from 5% to 
2.5% by making a payment of $5 million.

Astur's Salave project is envisioned to be developed by underground mining.  The resource lies within 
an area in which environmental restrictions on surface activity other than recreation and farming would 
necessitate special permitting.  
 
1.2 Exploration and Mining History 
 
Gold mining in the vicinity of Salave and other areas in Asturias dates to the Romans in the first century 
AD, and possibly even earlier to the Celts.  Production from Salave by the Romans has been variously 
estimated at two to six million tonnes of material with recovery of an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 
kilograms of gold.  Mining by the Romans was done by open-pit methods, excavating the near-surface 
material to depths averaging 30 meters.  Underground mining to extract molybdenum from quartz veins 
was attempted in the 1940s, but MDA has no information on production, if any, from this effort. 
 
Modern exploration of the Salave area for gold began in the mid-1960s.  Systematic testing of the gold 
zones began with work by IMEBESA, a subsidiary of Northgate Exploration Limited, in 1970, with 
subsequent exploration by Rio Tinto Patiño S.A. ("Rio Tinto"); Gold Fields Española S.A. ("Gold 
Fields"); Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited and related Charter Consolidated P.L.C. 
(collectively referred to as "Anglo"); Oromet Joint Venture ("Oromet"); Empresa Minera Newmont Inc. 
y Compañía, S.C., a partnership held by two wholly owned subsidiaries of Newmont Mining 
Corporation (collectively called "Newmont"); San Diego Gold Minery, S.A., a subsidiary of Lyndex 
Explorations Ltd. ("Lyndex"); and Rio Narcea Gold Mines, Ltd. ("Rio Narcea").   From IMEBESA's 
drilling in 1970-1971 through that of Rio Narcea in 2004-2005, at least 325 core holes and 139 
percussion/reverse circulation ("RC") holes were drilled on the property; this historic drilling totaled 
65,965.5 meters.  Note that this total includes some holes that were lost prior to reaching target depth. 
 
Astur acquired the Salave property in 2010.  Since December 2011, Astur has drilled 10 geotechnical 
core holes totaling 589 meters to establish geotechnical characteristics of the rock and 10 infill core 
holes totaling 3,031 meters for exploration.  Astur also contracted for a structural analysis to assist in 
modeling of the mineralization. 
  
1.3 Geology and Mineralization  
 
The Salave gold deposit is located within the northwestern portion of the Hercynian Iberian Massif, in 
which rocks of Late Proterozoic to Carboniferous age were deformed, often metamorphosed, and 
intruded in Late Devonian to Carboniferous time.  The Salave area lies in the transition between 
unmetamorphosed foreland areas to the east and the more internal zones of the Hercynian orogen to the 
west.  In the Salave area, a nearly continuous series of Cambro-Ordovician to Carboniferous clastic 
siliceous and carbonate rocks approximately 11,000 meters thick has undergone complex compressional 
deformation, with – from west to east – stacked recumbent folds verging toward the east, thrusts, and 
then large open folds with sub-vertical axial planes located farther to the east.  Hercynian magmatism 
took place during the waning stages of the Hercynian collision, producing syntectonic monzogranites 
and leucogranites and post-tectonic granodiorite-monzogranite intrusions with some leucogranite.  The 
post-tectonic intrusions are mainly responsible for the Salave gold deposit and the gold-copper deposits 
of El Valle-Boinas and Carlés, as well as other gold prospects in the northern Iberian Peninsula. 
 
The Salave area is dominated by a thick sequence of Upper Cambrian to Ordovician arenaceous to 
argillaceous metasedimentary units with quartzite, greywacke, and black graphitic and pyritic schist and

slate as important members of the succession.  These metasedimentary rocks strike northeast and 
generally dip west.  The Salave deposit lies in the Mondoñedo nappe, which consists of low- to medium-
grade metasedimentary rocks that were folded by east-verging recumbent structures during the first 
phase of Hercynian deformation and then thrust several tens of kilometers toward the east during the 
second deformation phase.  The north-northeast-trending Mondoñedo thrust passes just east of the 
Salave project.  The metasedimentary rocks in this area are intruded by three west-northwest-trending 
plutons that range in composition from gabbro to granodiorite. 
 
Most of the Salave project area is covered by Quaternary marine sediments ranging from a few 
centimeters to over 70 meters thick.  West of the Mondoñedo thrust, and within the Salave property, the 
area is underlain by quartzite, sandstone, argillite, shale, and greywacke of the Cambro-Ordovician Los 
Cabos Series that have been metamorphosed to slate, arenite, quartzite, and graphitic slates.  The Salave 
deposit is underlain by granodiorite, which is a small part of the Porcia Intrusive Complex that extends 
approximately four kilometers, from Rio Porcia to Represas Playa just east of Tapia.  The granodiorite 
crops out in the western part of the complex.  The igneous rocks in the Salave area are directly related to 
the mineralization and comprise several stocks and dikes whose ages range from 330 to 287 Ma.  The 
morphology of the local coastline reflects northwest- and northeast-trending systems of fractures and 
faults, which also appear to be significant in localizing mineralization.  Oxidation is not intensive at 
Salave and extends for a few meters below the surface, except along larger faults and structural zones 
where it can locally exceed 200 meters vertically. 
 
The Salave gold deposit is hosted mainly by the Salave granodiorite at its western boundary, close to the 
contact with the Los Cabos Series.  The mineralized units occur within an area approximately 400 
meters wide, 500 meters long, and at least 350 meters deep.  Gold mineralization occurs in a series of 
stacked, north- to north-northwest-trending, gently west-dipping irregular lenses related to faults and 
fracture zones that are parallel to the contact of the intrusive and metasedimentary rocks.  The 
fault/fracture zones appear to be related to one or more vertical structures, at least some of which contain 
high-grade mineralization, which probably acted as conduits for hydrothermal solutions.  The 
dimensions of the individual, relatively flat-lying mineralized zones range from 50 meters to 300 meters 
in length, 10 meters to 150 meters in width, and five meters to 60 meters in thickness, with an average 
thickness on the order of 20 meters.  The gold mineralization occurs with intense albite and muscovite 
(phengite) alteration (also identified as sericite alteration by some authors).  Gold occurs both 
disseminated and in veins and is primarily associated with acicular disseminated arsenopyrite and 
variable amounts of pyrite and stibnite. 
 
1.4 Drilling and Sampling 
 
The bulk of the drilling was completed prior to NI 43-101 reporting regulations.  Most of the drilling 
campaigns prior to Rio Narcea did not have the rigorous quality control assurances that current drill 
programs are required to have.  Some of the original data could not be audited as all original assay 
certificates are not available.  The data, however, can be verified by extensive metallurgical testing on 
about six tonnes of mineralized core intervals and several twin-hole comparisons.  All of the 
metallurgical-test average grades indicate equal or higher grades compared to the original drill-hole 
assay grades.   
 
Nine companies have drilled the Salave property from 1970 through 2013.  Those companies are 
IMEBESA, Rio Tinto, Gold Fields, Anglo, Oromet, Newmont, Lyndex, Rio Narcea, and Astur.  The

database used by MDA contains 342 core holes, and 29 RC or percussion holes with a total of 64,926 
meters of drilling.  These 371 holes include some holes drilled outside the current property boundary.  
Fifteen of the core holes were geotechnical holes; two RC holes were hydrologic holes; one RC hole 
was drilled as a possible shaft location; and the remaining holes were exploration holes.  Of the 371 
holes in the database, 10 resource core holes and 10 geotechnical holes were drilled by Astur. 
 
The IMEBESA drill holes were not used in the resource estimation due to check-assaying issues pointed 
out by Rio Tinto and Gold Fields and because drill-hole locations could not be verified.  Down-hole 
survey data were not available for the Rio Tinto holes and were limited for the Gold Fields holes. 
 
Rio Tinto's gold analyses were performed by their lab at Huelva, with duplicate samples also analyzed 
by the Huelva lab and check assaying for 10 samples performed by Anglo American's laboratory in 
Salisbury, Rhodesia. 
 
Gold Fields analyses were performed by their Little Daugh laboratory with a 50-gram split analyzed for 
gold by atomic absorption.  For every tenth sample, a 200-gram split was sent to Imperial Chemical 
Industries ("I.C.I."), a custom laboratory, for gold analysis by neutron activation.  Gold Fields also used 
"control samples" for quality assurance/quality control ("QA/QC"). 
 
Anglo's gold analyses were performed by fire assay at their Anglo American Research Laboratory in 
South Africa, with the exception of their 1984 holes, whose samples were analyzed at the Charter 
Laboratory in England. 
 
Newmont's samples were analyzed for gold by one-assay-ton fire assay at three different laboratories:  
Caleb Brett in England, X-Ray Assay Labs ("XRAL") in Canada, or Rocky Mountain Geochemical in 
the U.S.  Newmont's QA/QC consisted of use of analytical reference standards and check assaying by 
Newmont Metallurgical Services. 
 
Lyndex's gold analyses were performed by XRAL using fire assay.  Check assaying was done on 15 of 
the Lyndex samples by an unnamed independent laboratory. 
 
Rio Narcea sent their samples to their laboratory at the El Valle mine for analysis.  One 50-gram or two 
30-gram samples were used for fire assay.  For geochemical analysis or when lower detection was 
required, gold was analyzed by atomic absorption.  QA/QC measures used by Rio Narcea for the Salave 
drill holes included an on-going recheck program at an independent laboratory, combined with 
monitoring of the El Valle mine assay laboratory by close monitoring of the assay results from 
standards, blanks, and re-assaying of original pulps. 
 
Astur uses ALS as their principal laboratory for gold analyses.  Gold is analyzed by atomic absorption, 
but for samples with assays over 10 g Au/t, the sample is re-analyzed with a gravimetric finish.  Astur's 
QA/QC program includes use of blanks, certified reference materials, core duplicates, and analysis of 
pulp reject and check sample splits at a third-party commercial laboratory. 
 
1.5 Metallurgical Testing and Mineral Processing 
 
Early metallurgical test work on the Salave deposit was initiated by IMEBESA in 1971.  Since then, 
additional work has been conducted by all of the operators.

The Salave mineralization is refractory, and gold extraction by cyanidation of finely ground material has 
been found to be poor.  Cyanidation tests on flotation concentrates after pressure leaching with oxygen 
at elevated temperature or after bacterial oxidation have also been investigated.  Results indicate either 
process was found to improve gold recovery by cyanidation. 
 
Bench-scale and pilot testing were completed in 2005 and 2006 to evaluate flotation and concentrate 
oxidation processes.  Ausenco Ltd. summarized the conclusions that included: 

 Variability tests showed that gold recovery is not significantly affected by gold head grade. 
 At a primary grind of 106 microns, the samples showed consistently high gold recovery (over 

95%) by flotation at a neutral pH to a rougher concentrate containing six to seven percent of the 
sample feed weight.    

 Pressure-oxidation treatment of the concentrates yielded gold recovery from the concentrates of 
over 98%.  Additional testing was recommended.     

 Bacterial oxidation treatment of the concentrate yielded gold recovery from the concentrate of 
over 97%.  Additional testing was recommended.   

 Pressure oxidation was the most appropriate technology considering gold recovery, reagent 
consumption, and the residue stability. 

 Stockpile storage of mined materials for prolonged periods of time was not recommended, based 
on documentation of aging and associated metal loss that included a 3.3% gold-recovery loss 
between core samples collected over a 20-year period. 
 

In 2013, ALS Metallurgy Kamloops ("ALS-Met") completed comminution testing, flotation flow sheet 
development testing, limited grind and flotation optimization testing, aging testing, and locked cycle 
testing on available 2005-vintage core samples from the Salave deposit to confirm the information from 
the 2006 work.  ALS-Met concluded that: 

 Batch flotation testing results indicated that gold recovery by flotation from six composites 
tested ranged from 88 to 95 percent into a cleaner concentrate assaying between 68 and 299 g 
Au/t.   

 Locked cycle flotation testing results on three master composites indicated that gold recovery 
ranged from 85 to 91 percent to a cleaner concentrate that graded 86 to 156 g Au/t. 

 Limited testing indicated that primary grinding finer than 106 microns did not significantly 
improve flotation response. 

 Overall gold recovery from tests that included gravity and flotation was not higher than that from 
tests using only flotation. 

 
The concentrates from the locked cycle tests were assayed for deleterious elements.  Arsenic content 
ranged from 9.5 to 21.8 percent.  Antimony ranged from 1.5 to 2.8 percent.  Both arsenic and antimony 
are well above the concentration considered marketable to traditional concentrate buyers.  Astur is 
exploring other alternatives, including joint ventures with or marketing to mine operators who produce 
and process similar concentrates.  Fluorine content of the concentrate produced from one composite was 
also high at 170 g/t.

1.6 Mineral Resource Estimate  
 
The mineral resources at the Salave project were estimated by determining statistical and geological 
criteria to aid in modeling of gold mineral domains, interpreting gold mineral-domain polygons on cross 
sections, rectifying mineral-domain interpretations on northeast-looking long sections, analyzing the 
model geostatistically, interpolating grades into a three-dimensional block model, and undertaking 
various checks and re-interpolation runs until optimal results were generated.  Arsenic was modeled in 
addition to gold, due to potential penalties associated with the processing of arsenic-rich gold 
concentrates.  The arsenic was modeled independently of gold, but in an identical manner.  All modeling 
of the Salave project resources was performed using GEOVIA Surpac™ mining software. 
 
The Salave project block-diluted resources are tabulated using a cutoff grade of 2.0 g Au/t in Table 1.1.  
The cutoff is chosen to capture mineralization that is potentially available to underground mining, 
sulfide concentration, and gold recovery using off-site processing.  The resource is tabulated below a 40-
meter surface crown pillar.

Note: Rounding may cause apparent discrepancies 
 

 
The resource is open to the west and additional drilling is required to define the entire deposit. 
 
1.7 Conclusions and Recommendations  
 
MDA audited the Salave project database used in the resource estimation and visited the project site.  
MDA believes that the data provided by Astur are generally an accurate and reasonable representation of 
the Salave project. 
 
Although the Salave area was mined for gold by the Romans in the first century AD, drilling by 
IMEBESA, a subsidiary of Northgate Exploration Ltd., in 1970-1971 was the first modern exploration 
conducted at the property to identify gold mineralization.  Through Astur's drilling in September 2013, 
nine companies have drilled at least 345 core holes and 130 percussion-RC holes on and near the current 
Salave project.

The gold mineralization at Salave occurs in a series of stacked, north- to north-northwest-trending, 
generally shallowly west-dipping, irregular lenses related to faults and fracture zones that are parallel to 
the contact of intrusive and metasedimentary rocks.  The dimensions of the individual mineralized zones 
range from 50 meters to 300 meters in length, 10 meters to 150 meters in width, and five meters to 60 
meters in thickness, with an average thickness on the order of 20 meters.  The mineralized zones occur 
within an area approximately 400 meters wide, 500 meters long, and at least 350 meters deep.  Gold 
occurs both disseminated and in veins and is primarily associated with acicular disseminated 
arsenopyrite, variable amounts of pyrite and stibnite, and intense albite and muscovite alteration. 
 
Astur is in the process of completing a feasibility study that will likely be completed sometime during 
the second quarter of 2014.  Astur has received a positive environmental impact assessment for an 
underground mine and has resubmitted environmental studies to permit flotation and tailings facilities.  
Astur does not control the necessary surface rights for all facilities, but plans to purchase, lease, or use 
an expropriation process to obtain the necessary lands.    
 
MDA recommends that the decline proceed to allow the establishment of underground drill stations to 
continue to drill the deposit.  The deposit is currently open to the west, and some areas need additional 
infill drilling.  Most of this drilling is not possible from the surface due to land and permitting issues.   
 
Creating underground access will require time and expense, as it will be necessary to establish the 
decline access and drill level.  Drilling can start after about 18 to 24 months of underground 
development.  The decline will be driven 5 meters x 5.5 meters, a size suitable for proceeding with 
underground mining should the ongoing feasibility study determine that mining the deposit is feasible.  
This will also provide valuable geotechnical and hydrogeological information for the deposit.  The 
planning for a potential underground decline is at an advanced stage.  Table 1.2 shows the estimated cost 
for this project.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE  
 

Mine Development Associates ("MDA") has prepared this Technical Report on the Salave gold project, 
located in Asturias, Spain, at the request of Astur Gold Corporation ("Astur"), a Canadian company 
listed on the TSX Venture and Frankfurt exchanges.  The Salave project is 100% controlled by 
Exploraciones Mineras del Cantábrico S.L., a wholly owned subsidiary of Astur.   
 
This report has been prepared in compliance with the disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in 
the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"), Companion Policy 
43-101CP, and Form 43-101F1, as well as with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum's "CIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and 
Guidelines" ("CIM Standards") adopted by the CIM Council on November 27, 2010. 
 
2.1 Project Scope and Terms of Reference  
 
The purpose of this report is to provide a technical summary in support of an updated resource for the 
Salave gold project that envisions potential underground extraction rather than open-pit or a 
combination of open-pit and underground mining.  The mineral resources described in this technical 
report were estimated and classified under the supervision of Neil Prenn, Principal Engineer for MDA.  
Mr. Prenn is a qualified person under NI 43-101 and has no affiliation with Astur or any of its 
subsidiaries except that of independent consultant/client relationship. 
 
Section 13.0 on Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing has been prepared by Allen Anderson, P. 
E. and President of Allen R. Anderson Metallurgical Engineer Inc., and by Craig A. Smith, an 
independent metallurgical and process design consultant with Metal Edge Solutions.  Mr. Anderson is a 
qualified person under NI 43-101 and has no affiliation with Astur or any of its subsidiaries except that 
of independent consultant/client relationship.      
 
The scope of this study included a review of pertinent technical reports and data provided to MDA by 
Astur relative to the general setting, geology, project history, exploration activities and results, 
methodology, quality assurance, interpretations, drilling programs, and metallurgy of the Salave deposit.  
The author's mandate was to comment on substantive public or private documents and technical 
information listed in Section 20.0.  MDA has relied on data and information provided by Astur for the 
completion of this report, including the supporting data for the estimation of the mineral resources.  In 
addition, MDA has relied on reports listed in Section 20.0. 
 
MDA acknowledges the contributions to this report of Robert Fraser of R. J. Fraser Mineral Exploration 
Inc., consultant to Astur, who provided valuable information on Astur's drilling program and current 
interpretations of the mineralization at Salave. 
 
Two previous Technical Reports were prepared for the Salave project by Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. 
(Agnerian, 2004) and its successor company, Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Agnerian, 
2010); the company is now called RPA Inc. (collectively referred to as "RPA" in this report).  A 
Technical Report describing a Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Salave gold project was 
prepared by Golder Associates Global Ibérica S.L.U. in 2011 ("Golder") (Tenorio, 2011), which was 
subsequently amended (Tenorio et al., 2013).  The resource estimate reported in the current Technical 
Report differs from those in these previous Technical Reports because it is based on potential

underground extraction, which leads to the use of a higher-grade resource cutoff than the previous 
estimates that applied cutoffs appropriate for open-pit mining for most of the resource.  An additional 
difference with the previous estimates is that all material from the surface to a depth of 40 meters is not 
included in the current resources due to the necessity to maintain a surficial crown pillar in a potential 
underground operation. 
 
Mr. Prenn visited the Salave project on September 16 to 20, 2013, and again on November 27 to 28, 
2013.  These visits included inspection of the surface site and review of drill-hole core.  During the first 
visit, one drill was operating and one drill was set up to begin drilling the 10 exploration drill holes that 
Astur completed. 
 
MDA has relied almost entirely on data and information derived from work done by Astur and its 
predecessor operators of the Salave project.  MDA has reviewed much of the available data and made 
site visits and has made judgments about the general reliability of the underlying data.  Where deemed 
either inadequate or unreliable, the data were either eliminated from use or procedures were modified to 
account for lack of confidence in that specific information.  MDA has made such independent 
investigations as deemed necessary in the professional judgment of the author to be able to reasonably 
present the conclusions discussed herein. 
 
The Effective Date of this technical report is January 31, 2014; the information on the Sallave 
investigation permit in Table 4.1 is effective as of the report date of March 10, 2014.  The Effective Date 
of the mineral resource estimate is January 22, 2014.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
The author is not an expert in land, legal, environmental, and permitting matters.  Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 
and 4.4 are based on information provided by Astur.  Section 4.5 has been prepared by Francisco Ruiz 
Allén with Congeo.  The author presents this information to fulfill reporting requirements of NI 43-101 
and expresses no opinion regarding the legal or environmental status of the Salave project. 
 
4.1 Location 
 
The Salave gold project is located on the northern coast of Spain along the Bay of Biscay, approximately 
two kilometers east of the village of Tapia de Casariego ("Tapia") in the western part of the Principality 
of Asturias (Figure 4.1).  The project is located between the villages of Salave and Mántaras within the 
municipality of Tapia.  The center of the property is located at approximately 668,500E and 4,825,900 N 
(UTM-29, European datum 1950). 
 
4.2 Mineral Tenure in Spain 
 
In general terms, the investigation and development of mineral deposits and other geological resources 
in Spain is regulated by the Spanish Mining Act 22/1973 (21 July) ("the Mining Act"), the Royal Decree 
2857/1978 (25 August) approving the regime for the regulation of mining, and the Royal Decree 
975/2009 (12 June) (15 October) on extractive mining activities, waste management, and the protection 
and restoration of areas affected by mining activities.  
 
The Mining Act divides all sub-surface material into the following groups: 

 quarried material used for simple crushing, screening and washing by the construction industry 
(for example, sand, gravel and roadstone, ornamental rocks and slates, clays for refractories and 
limestone for cement and lime); 

 underground water, geothermal sources, mining residuals, and underground structures; 
 all other mineral materials and geological resources (section C); and 
 coals, lignite, and oil shale.  

The Salave gold project falls under Section C in this classification. 
 
In order to explore, investigate, and exploit geological resources of Section C, the Mining Act provides 
for the following categories of mining rights: 

a) Exploration Permit: granted for one year and renewable for another period of one year; 
b) Investigation Permit: granted for three years and renewable for equal periods of three years 

each; and 
c) Mining Concession: granted for 30 years and renewable for equal periods up to a maximum 

of 90 years. 
 
An exploration permit allows its holder to carry out aerial surveys, studies, or other techniques that do 
not affect the soil.  It also grants its holder priority status to obtain investigation permits or mining 
concessions within the perimeter granted. 
 
An investigation permit vests in its holder the right to carry out, within the indicated perimeter and for a 
specific term (a maximum of three years), studies and work aimed at demonstrating and defining one or 
several Section C resources and the right, once defined, to be granted a permit for mining them. The 



               Technical Report on the Salave Gold Project, Spain

term of an investigation permit may be renewed by the Regional Ministry of Economy and Employment 
for three years and, exceptionally, for successive periods. 
  
Rights to develop Section C resources are granted by the Regional Ministry of Economy and 
Employment by means of a mining concession, according to the form, requirements, and conditions 
established in the Mining Act. A mining concession entitles its holder to develop all the Section C 
resources located within the concession area, except those already reserved by the State.  In general 
terms, the concession shall always be granted for a specific area, measured in whole mining grids. No 
more than one mining concession for Section C resources may be granted for the same plot of land.  
Concessions can be renewed for an additional 30-year period to a maximum of 90 years from the date 
the concessions was granted with approval by the mining authorities.  Renewals of title must be 
requested prior to three years before the expiration date. 
 
Boundaries of the concessions are determined by ground-surveyed points, and there is a legal record of 
the boundaries. 
 
Under Spanish regulations, ownership of the land is independent of ownership of the mineral rights. 
 
4.3 Land Area 
 
The Salave property, as currently configured under the Mining Act, consists of five mining concessions 
that cover an area of 433.02 hectares, extensions of three of the concessions with demasia ground 
described below that encompass approximately 228.95 hectares, and an investigation permit that covers 
an additional 2,765 hectares for a total area of 3,426.97 hectares (Table 4.1); part of the area covered by 
the concessions lies in the Bay of Biscay. 
 
Figure 4.2 shows the Salave mining concessions, the demasia, and the investigation permit area.  The 
registered owner of the five mining concessions, the demasia, and the investigation permit is 
Exploraciones Mineras del Cantábrico S.L., a Spanish exploration company and wholly owned 
subsidiary of Astur, that was formerly called Exploraciones Mineras del Cantábrico S.A. (collectively 
called "ECM" in this report).  The concessions are granted for gold, silver, molybdenum, antimony, 
arsenic, iron, copper, strontium, titanium, and cesium. 
 
Because the perimeters of the concessions were defined and surveyed before the 1973 Mining Law, 
effective control can incorporate "demasia" ground, defined as the area beyond the limit of the 
concessions and to the limit of the affected mining square.  The mining square is a polygon of 20" in 
latitude and 20" in longitude, increasing from 0", referred to the Greenwich meridian.  As shown on 
Table 4.1 and Figure 4.2, three of the mining concessions have additional demasia ground.  
 
There are no holding costs on the land owned by Astur. 
 
4.3.1 Surface Rights 
 
The following information on surface rights currently controlled by Astur was taken from López-Cancio 
Valdés (2013) with additional information provided by Astur.

Astur owns approximately 10 hectares in eight contiguous parcels covering much of the resource area.  
This land is used for pasture, forest, and scrubland.  
 
Astur leases four contiguous parcels that total about 13.9 hectares south of the Salave resource from 
private owners, but Astur has given the owners three months' notice that they will be terminating the 
leases in April 2014.  Astur leases a fifth parcel totaling about 0.40 hectares south of the other four 
leased parcels; this parcel is leased for 15 years starting July 1, 2012.  For all five parcels, EMC may 
terminate the lease at any time with three months' notice.  All five parcels are leased at a rate of 0.12 
euros/m2 per year, with the payment revalued annually based on the Cumulative Price Index.

4.4 Agreements and Encumbrances 
 
4.4.1 Agreements for Acquisition of EMC by Astur Gold Corp. 
 
The terms of the agreements whereby Astur acquired EMC included: 

 Up-front cash payments totaling 1.1 million euros were made to Rio Narcea Gold Mines, Ltd. 
("Rio Narcea"), wholly owned subsidiary of Lundin Mining Corporation ("Lundin"), and to the 
holders of the remaining shares of EMC; 

 An additional cash payment of 20 million euros is payable to Rio Narcea within 180 days of 
receipt by EMC of all necessary permits, licenses, and approvals to construct and operate an 
open pit on the property that allows for the production of at least 800,000 ounces of gold; 

 Issuance of 5,296,688 common shares of Astur was made to Rio Narcea; and 
 Issuance of 500,000 common shares of Astur was made to a third party. 

 
In addition, an agreement with Rio Narcea established that any judgments or money awarded to EMC as 
a result of the litigation against the regional government of Asturias will be aggregated and shared 50% 
by Rio Narcea and 50% by EMC, after a deduction of the upfront payment of 500,000 euros to Rio 
Narcea as well as litigation and court-related costs incurred by Astur between April 13, 2010 and the 
time of settlement or final judgment in the lawsuit.  This lawsuit was subsequently rejected by the 
courts. 
 
4.4.2 Royalties 
 
As per an agreement among EMC, Rio Narcea, and John Patrick Sheridan dated March 9, 2004, and 
subsequently amended to include Astur, the following are outstanding obligations of EMC and Astur to 
John Patrick Sheridan in the end-of-lease contract: 
 

 $5 million to Mr. Sheridan within 10 days of acquiring all requisite surface rights and permits for 
development of the deposit; 

 $5 million to Mr. Sheridan within 10 days after commencement of commercial production of 
gold; 

 $5 million to Mr. Sheridan within 10 days after reaching an accumulated production of 200,000 
ounces of gold; 

 $5 million to Mr. Sheridan within 10 days after reaching an accumulated production of 400,000 
ounces of gold;  

 $5 million to Mr. Sheridan within 10 days after reaching an accumulated production of 800,000 
ounces of gold; and 

 A net smelter return ("NSR") royalty of 5% on gold produced and sold when cumulative gold 
production exceeds 800,000 ounces must be paid to Mr. Sheridan.  Astur has the option to reduce 
the NSR royalty from 5% to 2.5% by making a payment of $5 million. 

 
There are no other royalties on the Salave project.

4.5 Environmental Permitting and Liabilities 
 
The following information on Environmental Permitting and Liabilities has been provided by Francisco 
Ruiz Allén of Congeo (see Section 3.0).  
 
Previous attempts to permit an open-pit mine at Salave have not been successful.  Astur's Salave project 
is now envisioned to be developed by underground mining.  The seacoast land-use planning in Asturias 
(Plan de Ordenación del Litoral de Asturias ("POLA")) does not allow any surface activity other than 
recreation and farming in a stretch of about 500 meters from the coast.  Exceptionally, and by reasons of 
public utility, social interest, and having no other alternative, the Government's Council of Asturias can 
grant a permit for an activity not allowed in the POLA area.  A favorable report prior to the activity from 
the Commission on Urban and Territory Planning of Asturias ("CUOTA") is necessary. 
 
In Salave, the limits of the area affected by the POLA are the sea to the north and highway N634 to the 
south.  The Roman open pit and the Salave mineral resource lie within the POLA area.  An open pit was 
seen as unacceptable by the Asturian government in the past.  The current project is envisioned to be 
developed underground, with the proposed portal and treatment facilities to be located a couple of 
kilometers south of the POLA area. Only the ventilation and emergency shafts will be located within the 
POLA, as there is no alternative. 
 
4.5.1 Environmental Studies and Issues 
 
4.5.1.1 Baseline Studies and Impact Assessments 
 
Two environmental impact studies ("EIA") have been completed to date by Astur.  The first was 
completed in 2012, with an updated EIA and mine plan submitted to the mining authorities in May 
2012.  The latest EIA was submitted in December 2013 and is in compliance with the requirements of 
Spanish Law 21/2013 of 9 December regarding environmental assessment. 
 
Baseline environmental and socio-economic studies have been completed to support these 
environmental impact assessments:

PAYMACOTAS.  July 2013. 

 
In addition, an Environmental risk assessment, not linked to any specific permit, will have to be carried 
out according to European Directive 2004/35/EC on environmental liability with regard to the 
prevention and remedying of environmental damage, which was transposed to the Spanish legislation as 
Ley 26/2007 on environmental liability. 
 
4.5.1.2 Protected Natural Areas 
 
Natura 2000 is the network of natural areas protected across the European Union created under Directive 
92/43/EEC of the Council, on 21 May 1992, on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna 
and flora (Habitats Directive) in order to safeguard the most important natural areas in Europe. 
 
The Salave project does not occupy any protected area.  The Silva Lakes area is near a zone forming part 
of the Natura 2000 and Asturian Network of Protected Areas: Penarronda-Barayo (SCI: ES1200017, 
SPA: ES0000317), which corresponds to the coastal line.  The proposed portal and the facilities for ore 
extraction and treatment are 2.7 kilometers away from the protected site.  Four or five ventilation shafts 
are projected around the Silva Lakes area, lying several hundred meters away from the protected area.

4.5.1.3 Waste and Tailings Disposal 
 
Waste and tailings disposal is regulated by the European Directive 2006/21/EC on the management of 
waste from extractive industries.  This Directive was completed with the following Decisions (a decision 
is directly mandatory to the member States): 

 2009/337/EC: Commission Decision of 20 April 2009 on the definition of the criteria for the 
classification of waste facilities in accordance with Annex III of Directive 2006/21/EC. 

 2009/359/EC: Commission Decision of 30 April 2009 completing the definition of inert waste in 
implementation of Article 22(1)(f) of Directive 2006/21/EC. 

 2009/360/EC: Commission Decision of 30 April 2009 completing the technical requirements for 
waste characterization laid down by Directive 2006/21/EC. 

 
Spain has incorporated the Directive as the Real Decreto 975/2009 on the management of waste from 
extractive industries and the rehabilitation of the areas altered by mining activities.  This regulation sets 
what studies are required for the construction and permitting of the facilities for disposal of mine waste 
and processing tailings. 
 
The Reclamation Project and its Mine Waste Management Plan of 2012 have followed the requirements 
of the RD 975/2009. 
 
There is also the European Commission Reference Document on Best Available Techniques for 
Management of Tailings and Waste‐Rock in Mining Activities (EU 2009).  The Environmental Impact 
Studies of 2012 and 2013 included a specific chapter on the application of the Best Available 
Techniques to the Salave project. 
 
4.5.1.4 Mine Waste Dumps 
 
A Construction Project is required covering the following items: 

 Location selection 
 Seismology 
 Geotechnical 
 Hydrological and Hydrogeological 
 Monitoring 

 
The Exploitation Project and the Reclamation Plan, along with the Environmental Impact Studies, 
included the conceptual design of the mine waste dumps.  There were specific chapters on the issues 
above. 
 
Once the Declaration of Impact Assessment ("DIA") and the Exploitation Permit are granted, a detailed 
waste dump project will have to be submitted to the Authorities for their approval.  
 
4.5.1.5 Tailings Disposal 
 
Some studies describing tailings disposal will require additional information beyond that required for 
waste dumps.  Those studies are:

included the conceptual design of the tailings management facility ("TMF").  There were specific 
chapters on the issues above. 
 
Once the DIA and the Exploitation Permit are granted, a detailed TMF project will have to be submitted 
to the authorities for their approval. 
 
4.5.1.6 Site Monitoring 
 
European and Spanish regulations require that the Environmental Impact Assessment includes a Site 
Monitoring Plan focused on different aspects of the environment: surface and ground waters, fauna and 
flora, habitat, cultural-archeological heritage, mining wastes, tailings and process water.  This was 
included in the documentation submitted to the authorities. 
 
The Site Monitoring Plan will be approved and/or modified by the environmental authorities in the DIA 
that will be granted. 
 
4.5.2 Water Management 
 
A comprehensive water management plan must be developed.  A water management plan will have 
many components, and the details will vary from site to site but will include the following: 

 Site water balance 
 Water management practices 
 Water treatment and discharge facilities 
 Approach to maintaining the water management plan. 

 
Astur has commissioned specific environmental studies to assess the current environment status and the 
future impact by the mine project.  SRK Consulting undertook the initial predictive modeling of the 
mine water quality for the Salave project.  
  
Humidity cell test work on mine waste is being carried out at the AGQ Mining & Bioenergy laboratories 
in Seville, Spain, under the supervision of Astur and SRK Consulting.  Humidity cell test work on 
tailings is being conducted by ALS in Vancouver, B.C. 
 
The Salave project will not discharge process water during operation.  Modeling and water balance 
calculations have shown that storm water from the mill site and TMF will supply the majority of water 
necessary for process make-up water.  The balance will be available from ground water from the 
underground mine.  The excess of run-off water and underground drainage will need a discharge permit.

4.5.3 Project Permitting Requirements 
 
The project is subject to legislation in Asturias, Spain, and the European Union ("EU"). EU regulations 
are directly enforceable by law, and EU directives are integrated into regulations in each member state.  
 
Astur received environmental approval to develop the underground mine and its auxiliary facilities, as 
authorized in their Declaration of Impact Assessment ("DIA") in December 2013.  The DIA excludes 
the treatment facilities.  
 
In December 2013, the company submitted an expanded Environmental Impact Study that is currently 
under public review until February 6, 2014.  Afterwards, the company will be sent the comments from 
the authorities and public.  The company must evaluate and respond to those comments. 
 
There are a number of permits to be obtained specific to areas of mining, municipal works, construction, 
waste management, air emissions, and water use, management and discharges.  The overall permitting 
requirements are outlined in Table 4.2; additional required permits and the status of all permits are listed 
in Table 4.3.

4.5.4 Mine Closure Requirements 
 
A conceptual mine closure was included in the reclamation plan and the environmental impact study.  
The reclamation plan included a draft plan for closure of the facilities.  The TMF and waste dump 
construction projects will also have to include a specific plan for closure. 
 
The mining permit will set the financial security for the reclamation.  It will be based on the area of 
disturbance and will be updated annually.  The security also takes into account the closure costs for the 
plant and TMF that were calculated in the reclamation plan. 
 
4.5.5 Environmental Liabilities 
 
There are no known environmental liabilities in the Salave project area.  The Silva Lakes area has 
drained through an adit since Roman times.  That adit was built by the Romans to drain the open pit. 
 
The facilities on surface will lie to the south of the existing freeway, in an area of pine tree plantations 
and grasslands on natural soils, with no deposits of waste. 
 
There are no legal actions pending for the property regarding environmental liabilities.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY  

  
The following information has been taken from Agnerian (2004, 2010), Tenorio (2011; Tenorio et al., 
2013), Crump and Suarez (1977), Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited and Charter 
Consolidated P.L.C. (1982), and other references as cited. 
 
5.1 Access to Property 
 
Access to the Salave project is by paved Highway N634 from Oviedo, the capital of Asturias, which is 
located approximately 140 kilometers east of the property.  The deposit is less than one kilometer from 
the highway via unpaved roads.  N634 also passes through Tapia, two kilometers west of the Salave 
property.  There is direct access to the property by boat.  The nearest airport is Aeropuerto de Asturias 
near Aviles, approximately 87 kilometers east of Salave via highway A8. 
 
Figure 5.1 shows the geography of the Salave region.  Note the location of the Salave deposit, shown 
with the green crossed shovels, northwest of the village of Salave; iron mines are shown by red crossed 
shovels.  Figure 5.2 is an aerial view of the area immediately surrounding the Salave deposit.   
 
5.2 Physiography 
 
The Salave area is characterized by a coastal peneplain forming an east-west strip generally three 
kilometers to four kilometers wide, with relief ranging from 10 meters to 50 meters.  It is backed to the 
south by the Cantabrian Range, a mountainous area that extends along the entire northern coastline of 
Spain.  The peneplain slopes gently to the north from the foot of the mountains and terminates abruptly 
at the coast.  An escarpment along the coastline (Figure 5.3) has a height of about 40 meters in the east, 
diminishing to about 20 meters in the west at Rio de Ribadeo, the estuary of the Rio Eo.  The coastal 
plain is well drained and is incised by shallow valleys occupied by the estuary of the Rio Eo and 
numerous other rivers and streams which flow from the mountains to the south.  Tenorio (2011) noted 
that the location of facilities and development of open-pit mining is prohibited within 100 meters and 
500 meters of the coastline by national and regional planning regulations, respectively. 
 
The land around Salave is used for agriculture and forestry.  The high rainfall, humidity, and mild 
temperatures favor a vigorous growth of vegetation.  Small areas of the original oak and birch forest 
remain in some mountain valleys to the south, but for the most part, these have been replaced with faster 
growing species, such as pine and eucalyptus.  The frequent plantations of eucalyptus, alternating with 
green meadows, are an outstanding feature of the countryside.  The Salave project is locally covered by 
thick vegetation and woodland.  Wildlife in the area includes deer, rabbits, various migratory birds, and 
various species of fish. 
 
Outcrops are common along the coastline, and occasional outcrops of Middle Ordovician grey to black 
shale and quartzite are present at the old Roman open pit on the property, as well as along road cuts on 
Highway N634.  Overburden thickness ranges up to 12 meters.  Overburden consists of unconsolidated 
conglomerate with pebbles and boulders of metasedimentary and granitic rocks in a matrix of limonitic 
sand and clay.

Figure 5.3 View at the Coast of the Salave Project Area 
 

 
 
 
The water table lies about 15 meters below the surface at Salave (Anglo American Corporation of South 
Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982).  The surface terrain is not thought likely to 
cause problems in the design and emplacement of foundations for buildings and heavy equipment 
(Agnerian, 2010).  In terms of seismic activity, the area is considered to be stable (Anglo American 
Corporation of South Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982).  

 
5.3 Climate 
 
The Salave project area has a moderate Mediterranean-type climate with an average daily temperature of 
approximately 20°C in the summer and around 15°C in the winter.  It is situated within the zone of 
highest rainfall in Spain, extending along the northern coast and the northern and western slopes of the 
Cantabrian Range.  Annual rainfall averages 1,115 millimeters within a range from about 700 
millimeters to 1,500 millimeters.  Snowfall is rare along the coast but is more frequent to the south at 
high elevations.  The wettest months are from October to May, but thunderstorms may occur most 
frequently in May and June.  Strong winds are frequent during the fall and spring, gusting up to 115 
km/hour from the west-northwest.  
 
Mining and exploration can be conducted year round.

5.4 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
The village of Tapia lies about two kilometers west of the Salave project, and the city of Oviedo lies 
about 140 kilometers east of the project.  Oviedo has a population of approximately 226,000, and Tapia, 
a population of about 4,000 (2012 population, Instituto Nacional de Estadistica). 
 
Logistical support, in terms of power and telephone lines, is available at Tapia, which is linked to the 
Asturias power grid.  Tenorio (2011) reported that there is an existing network of power lines that enters 
the property and is connected to the national network.   
 
Mining equipment is available at Oviedo.  A rail line transects the property, and shipping facilities are 
available at the port of Ribadeo, some 10 kilometers west of Tapia within the Province of Galicia.  
Infrastructure is excellent for mining activities since the area has a long history of coal mining.  Other 
mines in the region include El Valle gold mine, some 100 kilometers east of Tapia, which is currently 
owned by Orvana Minerals Corp. 
 
Water is available from wells near the property and from the Porcia River, 2.5 kilometers east of Salave. 
 
Astur does not have the necessary surface land for all future facilities but plans to purchase, lease, or use 
an expropriation process to obtain the necessary lands.

6.0 HISTORY  
 
The following information has been taken from Valdés Suárez (2012), Tenorio (2011; Tenorio et al., 
2013), Agnerian (2004, 2010), Rodriguez Terente (2007), Campos de Orellana Pardesa (2001a), Harris 
(1979), Crump and Suarez (1977), Müller (1971), Hillebrand (1969), and other references as cited. 
 
6.1 Exploration and Mining History 
 
Gold mining in the vicinity of Salave and other areas in Asturias dates to the Romans in the first century 
AD, and possibly even earlier to the Celts.  Old Roman open pits are present at Salave and near El Valle, 
about 100 kilometers east of Tapia.  At Salave, the Romans mined the oxidized part of the Salave 
deposit (Figure 6.1) in the vicinity of "Los Lagos," those parts of the ancient Roman open pit that are 
presently covered by shallow ponds.  The Romans developed aqueducts to transport water to the mine 
and completed a drainage tunnel to the ocean to drain water from the pit that was mined.  Section 6.4 
describes what is known about production by the Romans.   
 
In the 1940s, underground mining was attempted by the family of the land holders at the time to extract 
molybdenum from quartz veins, as indicated by the presence of a small exploration shaft at the far 
northeast corner of the Roman pits and three exploration adits driven from the beaches.  MDA has no 
information on production, if any, from this effort.   
 
Mount Wright Iron Mines, Climax Molybdenum Company, and Newmont Mining Corp. examined the 
Salave property in the mid-1960s, and Cominco Ltd. conducted a geophysical survey in 1967.  
Systematic testing of the gold zones at Salave began with work by IMEBESA, a subsidiary of Northgate 
Exploration Limited, in 1970.  From IMEBESA's drilling in 1970-1971 through that of Rio Narcea in 
2004-2005, 303 core holes and 139 percussion/reverse circulation ("RC") holes were drilled on the 
property (Table 6.1).  There was no further drilling until Astur acquired the property in 2010.

6.1.1 Cominco Ltd. 1967 
 
Cominco Ltd. ("Cominco"), through its Spanish subsidiary Exminesa, conducted an induced 
polarization ("IP") survey over the Salave area in 1967 (Hillebrand, 1969, citing a report by George D. 
Tikkanen dated September 20, 1967 that MDA has not seen); although more recent references date 
Cominco's survey as 1964, Hillebrand's 1967 date is used here because Hillebrand's description was 
closest to the time of Cominco's work.  Four northwest-trending IP lines were surveyed, spaced 120 
meters apart with 50-meter dipoles, using a McPhar model 650 unit; the total length of line surveyed 
appears to have been approximately three kilometers (the three-kilometer figure is estimated from a 
rather illegible report).  Tikkanen reported that a weak central anomaly with lower resistivity and 
slightly higher frequency effects was indicated on three of the lines but noted that the survey covered 
only a limited area.    
 
6.1.2 IMEBESA (Northgate Exploration Ltd.) 1970-1971 
 
IMEBESA, the Spanish subsidiary of Northgate Exploration Ltd., examined the Salave property in 1970 
and 1971 on the basis of a weak response in an IP survey (Thomas, 1982).  IMEBESA's work at Salave 
in 1970 was described by Müller (1971); Campos de Orellana Pardesa (2001a) and Agnerian (2004, 
2010) summarized IMEBESA's work in both 1970 and 1971.  Thomas (1982) also described some of 
the work performed by IMEBESA.  
 
From late May 1970 through the end of that year, IMEBESA conducted geological mapping, 
geochemical surveying, and test drilling.  Drilling continued into 1971, but MDA has no details on other 
exploration conducted during 1971.   
 
A soil geochemical survey was conducted over the concessions between Tapia and Campos and Salave, 
including some additional ground to the south and east.  Geological mapping at a scale of 1:5,000 
covered the same area and was performed at about the same time as the soil survey.  The soil survey, 
conducted by Geotecnica, analyzed 671 samples for copper, zinc, mercury, antimony, arsenic, and 
molybdenum and 1,678 samples for molybdenum, arsenic, and mercury.  Samples were collected at 30-
meter intervals along lines trending approximately west-northwest spaced 75 meters or 150 meters apart, 
depending on the zone.  The soil samples were taken from a depth of about 15 centimeters from the 
surface.  The survey identified some local, low-intensity anomalies of arsenic, molybdenum, and 
mercury but few strong anomalies (Müller, 1971; Catuxo, 1997; Rodriguez Terente, 2007). 
 
IMEBESA's drilling consisted of 34 core holes totaling 7,026.4 meters (holes 1-3, 3A, 4-25, 26A, 26B, 
27-32) (Ayala, 1973; Thomas, 1982); numerous previous references attribute only 32 holes to 
IMEBESA.  The database used by MDA for this report contains all but holes 3A and 26A.  All were 
inclined holes drilled at angles from 35 to 75°, based on the hypothesis that the best zones of 
mineralization were vertical or sub-vertical (Catuxo, 1997).  These holes tested the extension at depth of 
the mineralization below the Roman open-pit workings (Thomas, 1982).  IMEBESA's drilling program 
outlined a substantial area of significant gold mineralization (Crump and Suarez, 1977).   
 
IMEBESA contracted with Lakefield Research ("Lakefield") of Canada for a short program of 
metallurgical test work on one composite high-grade sample, assaying 8.4 g Au/t (Thomas, 1982; 
Wilkinson, 1986; Wyslovzil and Bano, 1971).  This test work is described in 13.1. 
 
IMEBESA stopped work at Salave in December 1971 (Ayala, 1973).

6.1.3 Rio Tinto Patiño S.A. 1971-1972 
 
Rio Tinto Patiño S.A. ("Rio Tinto") explored the Salave property in 1971 and 1972.  Before conducting 
field work, Rio Tinto completed check assaying of IMEBESA's reject core samples and found 
significant discrepancies, with IMEBESA's assays tending to be higher than Rio Tinto's checks (Ayala, 
1973; Crump and Suarez, 1977).  Due in part to these initial uncertainties about assay results (Crump 
and Suarez, 1977), Rio Tinto proceeded with an exploration program, conducting geological, 
geochemical, and geophysical surveys and drilling. 
 
An IP and resistivity survey was carried out from April 24 through June 11, 1972 using Rio Tinto's own 
equipment (Cumpstey, 1972).  The purpose of the geophysical survey was to investigate the intrusion 
surrounding the open pit that had been mined for gold by the Romans in the hopes of finding an 
extension to the mineralization.  The survey used a pole-dipole electrode array with a potential electrode 
spacing of a=50 meters.  Line spacing was 300 meters, with intermediate lines at 150 meters where 
anomalies occurred; the station spacing was 100 meters, with 50-meter spacing where anomalies 
occurred.  The survey covered a total of 28 line kilometers.  Four identified anomalies showed very low 
resistivity associated with high chargeability in most cases; all appeared to be near-surface anomalies.  A 
fifth, less intense anomaly was found underlying the old Roman pit.  A magnetic survey yielded 
negative results (Ayala, 1973). 
 
While conducting the geophysical survey, soil-geochemical surveying was carried out on a 300 by 50-
meter grid (272 samples) that enclosed a central grid covering 150 by 50 meters (131 samples) (Ayala, 
1973).  A sampling tool measuring 1.8 meters in length was used to sample at depths greater than 1.5 
meters in order to avoid the marine Quaternary sediments that cover almost all of the project area.  Of 
the 403 samples taken, the first 272 were analyzed for gold, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, and 
arsenic.  The remaining 131 samples were analyzed for gold, copper, molybdenum, and arsenic.  The 
maximum gold value was 11.9 ppm.  Only a few limited anomalies were detected (Campos de Orellana 
Pardesa and Lobo, 1997a).    
 
Rio Tinto drilled 10 vertical core holes totaling 2,014 meters (holes 33 through 42).  Their drilling was 
not concentrated on the mineralized area as defined by IMEBESA, but instead tested the granodiorite 
and geochemical and geophysical anomalies in metasedimentary rocks along a 1,500-meter west-
northwest-trending profile through and west of the western portion of the Roman excavations (Rayment, 
1975a); only five of the 10 holes were located in the mineralized zone, according to a fragment of what 
appears to be a Gold Fields internal memorandum dated December 1976.   
 
Rio Tinto's Chessington laboratory conducted mineral processing test work on Salave samples in 1972 
and 1973 (Bulled, 1973; Gold Fields Espanola, S.A., 1976; Anglo American Corporation of South 
Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982; Wilkinson, 1986).  The results of this test work 
are discussed in Section 13.2. 
 
Rio Tinto dropped the property in December 1972 (Ayala, 1973). 
 
6.1.4 Gold Fields Española S.A.  1975-1976 
 
Gold Fields Española S.A., the Spanish subsidiary of Consolidated Gold Fields Ltd. ("Gold Fields"), 
carried out geological and mineralogical studies as well as core drilling at Salave from October 1975 
until December 1976 (Harris, 1979; Crump and Suarez, 1977).

Gold Fields noted "significant analytical discrepancies" between the results of Rio Tinto and those 
obtained by Gold Fields in an initial check on IMEBESA and Rio Tinto reject core samples from March 
to July 1975.  These discrepancies were a principal factor in Gold Fields' decision to investigate the 
property, along with a substantial increase in the gold price since 1972 (Crump and Suarez, 1977); Gold 
Fields felt that analyses by IMEBESA and especially Rio Tinto were too low (Harris, 1979).  As part of 
their work at Salave, Gold Fields subsequently re-logged, prepared, and re-analyzed the remainder of 
available IMEBESA and Rio Tinto reject core.  Gold Fields found that IMEBESA had over-reported 
gold content by 15-20% and that Rio Tinto had seriously under-reported gold content. 
    
Gold Fields began field work in October 1975 with geologic mapping of the prospect on 1:2000 and 
1:5000 scales and thin- and polished-section examination of selected drill core.  Following interpretation 
of the deposit geometry from previous drilling, Gold Field initiated their drilling program in January 
1976 (Thomas, 1982).  Various reports indicate Gold Fields drilled eight holes totaling approximately 
1,855 meters (Harris, 1979; Knutsen, 1991b; Campos de Orellana Pardesa, 2001a; Rodriguez Terente, 
2007), although Crump and Suarez (1977) and the database used by MDA list seven holes totaling 
1,830.5 meters (holes 43 through 48 and 50).  Holes generally were inclined 60° or 70° east or west, but 
one was inclined 45° and another was vertical.  The purpose of Gold Fields' drilling was to fill in a 
block of mineralization in the southern area identified by previous drilling and to test the northeast 
extension of this mineralization, where the geometry of the mineralization was poorly understood 
(Crump and Suarez, 1977).  Thomas (1982) reported that due to water problems at the bottom of the old 
workings, Gold Fields collared the majority of their holes on the periphery of the high-grade area 
identified by IMEBESA.   
 
Warren Spring Laboratories carried out metallurgical test work for Gold Fields, which was limited to 
mineralogical examination of one sample with 2.59 g Au/t in addition to selected sections of core and 
standard cyanidation testing of four samples with grades ranging from 1.12 to 3.30 g Au/t (Crump and 
Suarez, 1977).  Results of this test work are described in Section 13.3. 
 
Gold Fields dropped the property in 1976 (Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited and 
Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982), concluding it was uneconomic at that time (Crump and Suarez, 
1977). 
 
6.1.5 Exploraciones Mineras del Cantábrico S.A. 1980… 
 
Exploraciones Mineras del Cantábrico S.A. ("EMC"), a privately owned Spanish company, acquired the 
concessions that comprise the Salave property from the owners on February 1, 1980.  EMC 
subsequently changed its corporate form in 2003 and appears as Exploraciones Mineras del Cantábrico 
S.L. in more recent references.  The company's continuing history is described later in this section. 
 
6.1.6 Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited 1980-1988 
 
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited and related Charter Consolidated P.L.C. 
(collectively referred to as "Anglo" in this report) held the Salave project from November 1980 to 1988 
on a 50:50 joint venture basis through an option/lease between Charter Exploraciones, S.A., a subsidiary 
of Charter Consolidated P.L.C., and EMC; Charter Exploraciones, S.A. was the operator (Anglo 
American Corporation of South Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982).  Exploration 
began in February 1981.

At the start of their program, Anglo ran analytical checks on 722 old pulps from previous drilling that 
represented all the mineralized portions in the area of prime interest that were still available (Anglo, 
1981a).  In addition, halved core from Gold Fields holes numbered 43, 45, and 48 was quartered, 
crushed, split, and also sent for analysis.  The samples were sent to Johannesburg for analysis, 
presumably at the Anglo American Research Laboratories.  Samples were analyzed for gold, silver, total 
sulfur, molybdenum, arsenic, and antimony (Anglo, 1981a).  The results showed overall that the original 
gold values and standard deviations for gold in some longer intersections from IMEBESA, Rio Tinto, 
and Gold Fields holes were generally similar to results obtained by Anglo (Anglo, 1981a; Hutchison, 
1986).  In addition, Anglo's first 14 vertical core holes were drilled to confirm the previously identified 
mineralization, and these holes showed similar gold values to those obtained in earlier drilling 
(Hutchison, 1982, 1986).   
 
Anglo reported on data from a geochemical exploration program conducted by the Institute of Geology 
and Minerals of Spain (Charter Exploraciones S.A., 1981).  Seven east-trending sampling lines crossed 
the general Salave area, ranging in length from 2,250 meters to 400 meters.  Samples were collected 
every 30 meters from the bottom of pits dug to about 1.5 meters deep, presumably designed to penetrate 
the marine gravels.  Three of the lines were in the Salave pit area.  Two lines south of the pit area 
identified gold and arsenic anomalies about 400 meters southeast of the Roman pit. 
 
Anglo conducted geologic mapping, channel sampling, geochemical and outcrop sampling, and 
percussion drilling to probe for extensions to the mineralized body (Anglo American Corporation of 
South Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982; Hutchison, 1986).  Geological mapping 
was completed in the area of the old Roman workings at a scale of 1:1000, while geologic mapping of 
the entire mining lease was completed at a scale of 1:5000 (Hutchison, 1982).  However, the lack of 
outcrop limited the value of regional mapping and outcrop sampling.  Channel sampling in 1981 and 
1982 over the area of the Roman workings and along the cliff faces on Represas beach, west of the old 
workings, showed  significant gold mineralization, up to 22.0 g Au/t over two meters, in the eastern part 
of the old workings (Hutchison, 1982).  An initial soil-geochemical sampling program was conducted 
over an area 1,000 meters square surrounding the old Roman workings on lines 100 meters apart with 
samples every 25 meters, which was later extended to the limits of the property along lines 200 meters 
apart and with samples collected every 50 meters (Hutchison, 1983).  Several anomalous gold 
concentrations in the soils were identified, with some north, east, and west of the old workings thought 
to reflect bedrock mineralization (Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited and Charter 
Consolidated P.L.C., 1982; Hutchison, 1983).  Shallow percussion drilling south and east of the Roman 
workings showed anomalous concentrations of arsenic and gold, with a peak value of 1.45 g Au/t.  
Outcrop sampling within the old workings but beyond the limits of previous drilling revealed several 
areas with greater than 0.5 g Au/t. 
 
Anglo drilled 99 core holes (totaling 15,412 meters) on the Salave property.  In addition to these core 
holes, Anglo used a small percussion drill to drill a total of 26 holes (116 meters) scattered over the area 
south and east of the old Roman workings as described above (H-series holes) (Hutchison, 1982, 1983); 
these H- series holes are not in the database used for the resource estimate for this report, and Astur 
reports that no records for these holes have been found.  The high water table severely limited the 
effectiveness of this percussion drilling, but granodiorite drilled in one of the holes located 700 meters 
southeast of the old workings showed a peak anomalous gold value of 1.45 g Au/t with 0.35 g Ag/t 
(Hutchison, 1982).  Three other holes in the granodiorite in the same area showed highly anomalous 
arsenic values.

Anglo performed a structural analysis using oriented core, but no preferential directions to faults and 
fractures were found within the mineralized body (Hutchison, 1986).  
 
Anglo completed an IP survey totaling 14.75 line kilometers in 1983 over the area west of the Roman 
workings and up to the concession boundaries to probe for mineralization and/or granodiorite beneath 
the Quaternary cover.  The contractor for the work was Compania General de Sondeos S.A. (Charter 
Exploraciones S.A., 1983c).  Lines 100 meters apart were run with five depth readings at stations every 
50 meters.  Resistivity and chargeability profiles interpreted by both the contractor and Anglo's 
geophysical department showed several anomalies.  Seven core holes were drilled to test these 
anomalies, drilling to projected anomaly depths of between 50 and 100 meters for a total of 488.8 
meters.  No granodiorite or significant mineralization was found (Hutchison, 1986).   
 
The Anglo American Research Laboratory conducted a number metallurgical test programs on Salave 
samples.  These are discussed in Section 13.4.   
 
During their second phase of drilling, Anglo ran tests on water inflow rates in the core holes, and salinity 
tests were conducted on the water (Hutchison, 1982, 1983, 1986).  Although the salinity test results 
indicated the water was fresh, drillers had reported slight tidal variations in the water level in hole 
S13/1(Hutchison, 1986). 
 
In January 1984, Anglo signed an option agreement with EMC for the Fabrica de Mieres property 
adjoining the Figueras concession on the southeast and including the eastern end of the Salave 
granodiorite (Charter Exploraciones S.A., 1984a).  An IP survey was completed by Compania General 
de Sondeos (Charter Exploraciones S.A., 1984b).  Anglo drilled an additional 22 core holes on this 
property in 1984 (FM- series) to test the granodiorite and to investigate IP anomalies but found no 
significant mineralization (Hutchison, 1986).  They did not renew the option on the Fabrica de Mieres 
property (Charter Exploraciones S.A., 1984d). 
 
As described in Section 6.1.7, Anglo dropped the Salave property following dissolution of an agreement 
with the Oromet Joint Venture.  
 
6.1.7 Oromet Joint Venture 1988-1989 
 
Oromet Joint Venture ("Oromet") was a joint venture between Glamis Gold Inc. and Biomet 
Technology Inc.  Oromet negotiated controlling interest of the Salave property with Anglo in order to 
investigate the response of the Salave mineralization to bio-oxidation.  Oromet completed 503 meters of 
shallow core drilling in 20 holes (12.5-meter by 12.5-meter grid) in the northeast part of the old Roman 
pit in 1988.  In addition, in 1988 Oromet conducted a number of metallurgical tests using BioMet 
technology; these are described in Section 13.5.  In 1989, Oromet suddenly withdrew from Salave, and 
Anglo chose not to continue work on the project, which reverted to EMC (Knutsen, 1991b). 
 
6.1.8 Newmont Mining Corp. 1990-1991 
 
Empresa Minera Newmont Inc. y Compañía, S.C., a partnership held by two wholly owned 
subsidiaries of Newmont Mining Corporation (collectively called "Newmont" in this report), acquired a 
two-year lease with a terminal purchase option on the Salave property from EMC in November 1990.  
Newmont had been interested in the property since 1965.

Newmont conducted confirmatory geologic mapping, measured a stratigraphic section of the 
metasedimentary rocks in Poleas playa, and re-logged 25 Anglo holes. 
 
Newmont did not conduct any geochemical or geophysical surveys at Salave.  Knutsen (1991b) did note 
that a 1983 soil geochemical survey by Anglo showed no obvious soil geochemical anomaly in the area 
between Newmont's holes NSC4 and NSC28, where Newmont found an extension of gold 
mineralization. 
 
Based on the information in the database provided to MDA, Newmont completed 5,873.55 meters in 32 
core holes and 202.5 meters in two RC drill holes; Knutsen (1991b) reported 5,870.45 meters in 29 core 
and two RC holes.  The disparity appears to be primarily in holes 5A, 5B, and 5C included in the 
database.  
 
Newmont also conducted metallurgical test work, which is described in Section 13.6.   
 
Newmont installed piezometers in 17 drill holes to assess fluctuations in water level, as discussed in 
Section 10.7. 
 
Newmont carried out work in 1991 for a feasibility study that was never completed, as described in 
Section 17.0 and then returned the property to EMC at the end of 1991.  According to Knutsen (1991b), 
Newmont did not renew the lease for the second year because of inadequate tonnage and grade for an 
underground mine and a 10:1 stripping ratio for an open pit. 
 
6.1.9 Exploraciones Mineras del Cantábrico S.A.  (continuing) 
 
On July 6, 1992, EMC leased the Salave property to John Patrick Sheridan of Toronto, Canada.  Also in 
1992, EMC carried out an estimate of the mineral resources that could be exploited by underground 
mining (see Table 6.2).   
 
6.1.10 Lyndex Explorations Ltd. 1993-2004 
 
John Patrick Sheridan formed a Spanish company called San Diego Gold Minery, S.A., a subsidiary of 
Lyndex Explorations Ltd. ("Lyndex") of which John Patrick Sheridan was a director, to explore the 
Salave property (Campos de Orellana Pardesa and Lobo, 1997a) on November 20, 1995.  Lyndex held 
the property until 2004.   
 
Magnetic and electromagnetic surveys were conducted in November 1995 on a grid about 2,000 meters 
in an east-west direction and about 600 meters north-south, centered on the Roman pit (Campos de 
Orellana Pardesa and Lobo, 1997a; Campos de Orellana Pardesa, 2001a).  The electromagnetic survey 
was conducted with APEX-MAX/MIN equipment.  Lines were spaced 100 meters apart.  The 
transmitter and receiver stations were spaced 50 meters apart, and station spacing was 20 meters.  A 
Scintrex MP-2 proton magnetometer was used for the magnetic survey, with a 10-meter spacing 
between stations.  These surveys did not detect any significant anomalies (Campos de Orellana Pardesa 
and Lobo, 1997a). 
 
Lyndex conducted both core and RC drilling at Salave from October 1996 through December 1997 
(Campos de Orellana Pardesa, 2001a).  They completed 9,077.65 meters of core drilling in 23 vertical 
holes, based on the database provided to MDA; a table in the reports by Catuxo (1997) and Campos de

Orellana Pardesa (2001a) shows the same 23 holes but totaling 9,044.90 meters, with the discrepancy in 
total depth appearing in three holes (9601, 9703, and 9708).  In addition, Lyndex drilled  RC holes 
(Catuxo, 1997), variously reported as 102 holes totaling 5,455 meters (Agnerian, 2004, 2010) or 
5,296.70 meters (Valdés Suárez, 2012) and 109 holes totaling 5,333 meters (Campos de Orellana 
Pardesa, 2001a); the database used by MDA included only 24 RC holes totaling 683.9 meters.  
Lyndex's core holes tested a relatively small and deep high-grade zone of mineralization originally 
identified by some of Anglo's (3/2, 5/4, and 5/5) and Newmont's holes (NSC19, 20, 21, 22, and 26) 
(Campos de Orellana Pardesa, 2001a; Catuxo, 1997).  Lyndex's RC holes were generally very shallow 
and were drilled in a narrow grid with a spacing of 7.5 meters to 15 meters at the bottom of the Roman 
open pits in order to confirm results of previous operators and to improve knowledge of the oxidized 
mineralization in the area of a potential open pit (Campos de Orellana Pardesa, 2001a; Catuxo, 1997). 
 
In November 2002, Lyndex drilled a percussion hole 30 centimeters in diameter and 200 meters deep as 
a pilot for a proposed shaft.  Instability of the hole due to the presence of Quaternary sediments and 
older metasedimentary rocks to a depth of 40 to 45 meters in the hole led Lyndex to consider use of a 
ramp to permit underground drilling. 
 
Lyndex also hired divers to collect seven samples from five points in the seabed off the beach at El Figo 
to look for possible continuation of the mineralized zone to the northeast.  The gold content did not 
exceed 0.03 ppm (Campos de Orellana Pardesa, 2001a). 
 
6.1.11 Rio Narcea Gold Mines, Ltd.  2003-2010 
 
Rio Narcea Gold Mines, Ltd. ("Rio Narcea") purchased 85% of the shares of EMC in October 2003 
through its wholly owned subsidiary Naraval Gold S.L. (Rio Narcea Gold Mines Ltd. news release, 
April 5, 2004, and 2003 Annual Report).  On March 9, 2004, the lease between EMC and John Patrick 
Sheridan was terminated, which gave Rio Narcea the exclusive right to explore and develop the project.  
Later in 2004, Rio Narcea acquired 93.7% of EMC through two equity financings in EMC in which the 
minority shareholders did not participate (Rio Narcea Gold Mines Ltd. news release, March 29, 2005).  
By February 2010, Rio Narcea controlled 95.04% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of EMC, 
according to the share purchase agreement dated February 10, 2010.   
 
Rio Narcea compiled all available information about the project from previous operators and developed 
an updated database that included drill-hole data from Lyndex, Newmont, and Anglo.  In early 2005, 
Rio Narcea contracted with International Geophysical Technology, based in Madrid, to conduct a 
gravimetric survey at Salave.  Figure 6.2 shows the residual gravity.  Altered granodiorite is believed to 
be reflected by the blue colors showing lower density (Valdés Suárez, 2012). 
 
Rio Narcea drilled 79 holes from May 2004 to May 2005, of which five were geotechnical holes (RN01, 
GT1, GT2, GT3, and GT4) and two (Hidro1 and Hidro2) were for hydrological purposes; the remainder 
were for resource evaluation and exploration (Astur, written communication).  All but the two 
hydrological holes were core holes; the remaining two were RC holes.   
 
In addition, Rio Narcea contracted for metallurgical work (Ausenco Limited, 2006), a geotechnical 
report, design of potential mining facilities, an archeological study, hydrogeological studies, and 
environmental baseline studies.  The metallurgical studies are described in Section 13.7.

Rio Narcea ceased further exploration at Salave in August 2005 when they were unable to permit an 
open-pit operation. 
 
6.1.12 Lundin Mining Corporation 2007-2010 
 
In 2007, Lundin Mining Corporation ("Lundin") acquired all of the outstanding shares of Rio Narcea 
(Lundin Mining Corporation news release, November 13, 2007), thereby acquiring Rio Narcea's interest 
in the Salave project.  Rio Narcea became a wholly owned subsidiary of Lundin.  In February 2010, Rio 
Narcea entered into an agreement to sell their interest in the Salave project to Dagilev Capital Corp. 
(subsequently renamed Astur Gold Corp.).  Terms of the sale are discussed in Section 4.4.1. 
 
From Lundin's news releases during this period, there is no evidence that they or Rio Narcea conducted 
exploration or other activities on the Salave project.

Dagilev Capital Corporation ("Dagilev") acquired 100% interest in the Salave project by purchasing the 
issued and outstanding securities of EMC held by Lundin's subsidiary Rio Narcea in February 2010 and 
by purchasing the remaining issued and outstanding securities of EMC in March 2010; EMC became a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Dagilev (Dagilev Capital Corp. news releases, February 11, 2010; March 
18, 2010; and April 14, 2010).  Dagilev was renamed Astur Gold Corporation on June 4, 2010 (Astur

The estimate by Gold Fields shown on Table 6.2 was made in August 1976 and identified "probable 
reserves" with a stripping ratio of 1:2.6 and an average slope of 45° for the trial pit limit (Crump and 
Suarez, 1977).  Within the "reserves," a high-grade central core was said to contain some two to four 
millions tonnes with a grade of 5.28 g Au/t and three to four million tonnes grading 0.18% Sb and 
0.014% Mo (Crump and Suarez, 1977).  A three-dimensional model of the geometry of the 
mineralization was constructed using a cutoff of 1.0 g Au/t (Crump and Suarez, 1977; Thomas, 1982).  
The polygonal method was then used to calculate the "reserves" by taking 25-meter horizontal slices 
from +25 to -200 meters below sea level.  Gold values were averaged over a vertical 25 meters (12.5 
meters above and below each section).  Correction factors were applied to IMEBESA and Rio Tinto 
assays based on Gold Fields re-check analyses for some of the holes.  Three other variations of the 
estimate were made using different grades.  
 
Anglo made a number of estimates of the resources at Salave during their tenure on the project.  An 
estimate based on the limited area of prime interest after Anglo had drilled its first 14 drill holes in the 
first phase of their exploration program is not included on Table 6.2.  After in-fill drilling and limited 
peripheral exploration drilling that totaled 16 additional holes, Anglo prepared an estimate in 1982 of 
"indicated reserves" using five methods (Hutchison, 1986).  Earlier inclined holes were included, which

was subsequently shown to slightly enhance both tonnages and grades.  The 1982 Anglo estimate shown 
on Table 6.2 used areal interpretations on longitudinal sections with minimum widths of mineralization 
of two meters and extended to maximum depths of 185 meters below mean sea level.  Gold "stretch 
values" calculations were made in which the waste thicknesses of up to a maximum of six meters were 
included in mineralized units if mineralization above and below these poorly mineralized zones would 
"carry" them above the cutoff value (Hutchison, 1982).  A specific-gravity value of 2.74 was applied to 
the granodiorite.   
 
Following the drilling of an additional 15 holes, a revised "reserve" calculation was made in 1983 that 
did not use data from earlier inclined holes due to demonstrated uncertainty about their locations and 
deviations (Hutchison, 1983, 1986).  This estimate is shown on Table 6.2; it used a minimum width of 
two meters and a cutoff of 1 g Au/t.  In 1986, Anglo conducted a reappraisal of its previous study and 
extended the "geological reserves" with the addition of "very substantial reserves in the 'possible' 
category" (Hutchison, 1986). 
 
In 1984, Mineral Industries Computing Limited performed a "reserves calculation" for Anglo 
(Lavandeira, 1992).  Modeling was based on blocks measuring 25 meters by 12.5 meters by four meters, 
and linear kriging was used for interpolation.  "Open-pit reserves" are shown in Table 6.2.     
 
The 1986 estimate (Table 6.2) included three new holes in the main zone of mineralization.  Anglo's 
1986 estimates of "geological in situ inventory" only included mineralization thought to be minable by 
open-pit methods and were based on a depth limitation of 185 meters below sea level (Hutchison, 1986).  
The model was based on north-south sections, generally 25 meters apart with two being 100 meters 
apart.  "Probable reserves" occurred in blocks that were a maximum of 25 meters on either side with 
widths being 12.5 meters on either side of the section; "possible reserves" extended outside these limits.  
Sample data were composited into four-meter units, and a computer model was generated using linear 
kriging interpolation.  Again using minimum two-meter widths and a 1 g Au/t cutoff, Anglo's 1986 
estimate was intended to "provide a reasonably optimistic assessment of the likely ore reserve contained 
within the present area of investigation."  Unlike the previous Anglo models, the 1986 model 
deliberately ignored the existing structural interpretation, included all gold assays over 0.5 g Au/t 
regardless of rock type, and included without restricting the influence of some very high-grade sample 
values (the highest being 166 g Au/t) (Brown, 1986).  A pit was designed based on this model with an 
"optimistic slope angle" of 55°; the "in situ mineable reserves" are also shown in Table 6.2.   
 
The 1988 Anglo estimate shown on Table 6.2 is taken from Agnerian (2004, 2010), but no further 
details were provided.  MDA has seen no original reports by Anglo more recent than 1986 and has seen 
no details on Anglo's 1988 estimate reported by Agnerian. 
 
Newmont conducted modeling of the "resources" at Salave that included Newmont's drill holes in 
addition to all historic drilling.  Interpolation was by inverse distance to the fifth power, and model 
blocks were 15 meters by 15 meters with a bench height of five meters.  The results are shown in Table 
6.2.  Newmont discovered a "high-grade" core extending north from the known mineralized system; a 
polygonal estimate of the "underground minable reserves" of just this high-grade mineralization totaled 
300,000 oz at an average grade of 5.5 g Au/t at a 30% dilution and a 3.0 g Au/t cutoff (Knutsen, 1991b).  
In a subsequent report prepared for Lyndex that appears to be citing Newmont information (Campos de 
Orellana Pardesa, 2001a), there is an estimate of "in situ resources" as of the end of 1991 that were

potentially exploitable by underground mining; these total 2.8 million tonnes with an average grade of 
7.71 g Au/t at a cutoff of 3 g Au/t (Table 6.2). 
 
EMC prepared an estimate of "underground mining resources that can be recovered simultaneously 
with open pit mining" at Salave in 1992 (Lavandeira, 1992).  This estimate assumed a limited open-pit 
depth of close to 100 meters, with some high-grade areas present under the pit and extending to the 
north and northwest.  EMC's estimate of the cutoff was based on a gold price of $350 per ounce with 
90% recovery. 
 
After completion of their 23 core holes to test the area of deep high-grade mineralization identified by 
Anglo and Newmont, Lyndex estimated the "resource" between depths of 100 and 200 meters that was 
potentially minable by underground methods at 5.5 million tons with an average grade of 7.7 g Au/t at a 
cutoff of 3 g Au/t (Campos de Orellana Pardesa, 2001a).  Based on their 109 shallow RC holes drilled in 
the area of the Roman pit, Lyndex also estimated an open-pit "resource" to a depth of 220 meters with 
40% dilution of between 10,000,000 and 5,000,000 tonnes averaging 3.77 and 5.01 g Au/t, respectively, 
at cutoffs of 2 and 3 g Au/t, respectively (Campos de Orellana Pardesa, 2001a); this estimate is not 
shown on Table 6.2.  This report gave no details on how these estimates were made. 
 
The author has not done sufficient work to classify these historic estimates as current mineral resources 
or mineral reserves, and Astur is not treating these historic estimates as current estimates.  The estimates 
shown on Table 6.2 were prepared prior to NI 43-101 regulations. 
 
In a 2004 Technical Report prepared for Rio Narcea, RPA (Agnerian, 2004) estimated a mineral 
resource for the Salave deposit.  RPA used the same drill-hole database as the one Newmont had used 
for their 1991 estimate and also used the assay database from Lyndex's drilling and for holes RN-02 to 
RN-14 and RN-16 to RN-17 drilled by Rio Narcea as of the date of the estimate.  RPA constructed a 3D 
block model with blocks measuring 10 meters (east-west) by 10 meters (north-south) by five meters 
(vertical) and used kriging to interpolate the gold grades of the blocks.  Using a density of 2.74 g/cm3, 
recovery of 90%, and a gold price of $350 per ounce, RPA calculated a cutoff grade of 1.74 g Au/t but 
reported the resource at a nominal cutoff grade of 1 g Au/t because the gold price considered by Rio 
Narcea was considerably lower than the price at the time of the estimate, in the range of $390 to $410 
per ounce.  Table 6.3 shows the 2004 estimate for Salave.

6.3 Previous Mineral Resource Estimates 
 
In a 2010 Technical Report prepared for Astur, RPA (Agnerian, 2010) updated an in-house mineral 
resource estimate for the Salave deposit that had been prepared in September 2005 by Rio Narcea.  The 



               Technical Report on the Salave Gold Project, Spain

model for the 2005 estimate was based on 235 core holes and 130 percussion holes; these holes included 
70 of Rio Narcea's holes.  RPA constructed a new block model and updated the resource estimate.  The 
block size was four meters (east-west) by four meters (north-south) by four meters (vertical).  The 
following parameters were used to generate a conceptual pit shell for the purposes of defining resources: 
 

 Recovery of 90% of the gold grade: 95% of the gold to the flotation concentrate and 95% 
recovery of the gold in the concentrate by pressure oxidation or bio-leaching 

 An average slope of 45° for the walls of the conceptual open pit 
 Assumed annual production of two million tonnes of ore 
 Unit cash operating costs per tonne, including: 
 US$1.75/tonne for mining (ore and waste). 
 US$0.50/tonne for ore haulage. 
 US$15.00/tonne for processing. 
 US$4.00/tonne for general administration (G & A) 
 Gold price of US$1,000 per ounce (or US$32.15/g Au). 

In addition to the above parameters, RPA assusmed an underground mining cost of US$55/tonne, which 
represented the cost for selective rather than bulk mining.  Adding this cost to the above parameters, 
RPA arrived at a cutoff grade of 2.5 g Au/t used for the underground mineral resources. 
 
A density of 2.74 g/cm3 was used for the estimate.  Interpolation was by inverse distance squared.  Table 
6.4 shows the 2010 estimate, including the in-pit resources and the additional underground resources 
peripheral to and below the conceptual open pit used for that estimate.  Agnerian (2010) noted that the 
results shown in Table 6.4 were very similar to the unclassified resources estimated by Rio Narcea in 
September 2005, although Rio Narcea had used a cutoff grade of 0.5 g Au/t whereas RPA had used a pit 
discard cutoff grade of 0.7 g Au/t.  The open-pit resources shown on Table 6.4 are contained within a 
conceptual open pit with dimensions of 800 meters by 650 meters and 305 meters deep.  In addition, the 
underground resources shown on Table 6.4 were estimated at a cutoff grade of 2.5 g Au/t and minimum 
4-meters vertical thickness of mineralization (Agnerian, 2010).  These underground resources included: 
1) areas peripheral to the conceptual open pit, largely located between the conceptual pit and the ocean; 
and 2) areas below the conceptual open pit.

2. Open pit Mineral Resources are estimated within a constraining pit shell, at the pit discard cut-off grade of 0.7 g Au/t 

and a minimum 4 meters vertical thickness of mineralization.  The pit discard cut-off is only valid within an economically 
viable open pit shell.

for the Salave deposit. 
4. Tonnage and contained ounce figures are rounded and totals may not add due to rounding. 
5. Measured Mineral Resources include blocks within approximately 15 meters search radius within the conceptual 

open pit.  Indicated Mineral Resources include blocks within a 40 meters search radius within the conceptual open 
pit.  Inferred Mineral Resources include blocks within a 100 meters search radius within the conceptual open pit. 

6. Mineral Resources exclude mined out areas from historical mining. 
7. Underground Mineral Resources, located outside of the open pit shell, are estimated at the cut-off grade of 2.5 g Au/t 

and a minimum 4 meters vertical thickness of mineralization. 
 

A Preliminary Economic Assessment performed by Golder (Tenorio, 2011; subsequently amended as 
Tenorio et al., 2013) was based on the 2010 RPA mineral resource model (Agnerian, 2010).  Golder 
reviewed the 2010 estimate using a gold price of $1,100 per ounce, updated operating and processing 
costs, and applied three different mining scenarios with various cutoff grades.  This Preliminary 
Economic Assessment is further described in Section 17.1; the interested reader is referred to the 
original Technical Report (Tenorio, 2011; Tenorio et al., 2013) for details. 
 
All prior mineral resource estimates are superseded by the current mineral resource estimate for Salave 
described in Section 14.0.   
 
6.4 Past Production 
 
The only known past production of gold from the Salave project dates from Roman times.   
 
There are various reports of estimates of total production by the Romans.  Rio Narcea estimated that 
approximately 3,265,000 tonnes of material were mined from the four areas of the Roman excavation 
(Figure 6.1) (Rodriguez Terente, 2007, citing Maldonado, 2006).  Hutchison (1986) reported that it had 
been estimated that about three million tonnes of friable material were mined at an average grade of 
possibly 6 g Au/t (surface concentration).  Crump and Suarez (1977) estimated that the Romans mined 
between two and four million tons of material, recovering between 5,000 and 7,000 kilograms of gold 
(Parry, 1991, cited by Rodriguez Terente, 2007).  Lavandeira (1992) estimated that the Romans removed 
some five million tons of rock.  Harris (1979) reported a "rough volume calculation" of four to five 
million tonnes mined from the ancient open pits.  Lyndex (1994) proposed the largest tonnage produced 
during the Roman era – some six million tonnes.

Mining by the Romans was done by open-pit methods, excavating the near-surface material to depths 
averaging 30 meters.  Dewatering tunnels and canals were dug out to the sea.  Processing of the material 
included gravity concentration of the gold by transporting the loose oxidized material along several large 
and adjacent sluice channels (Agnerian, 2010, citing Jones and Bird, 1972; Lewis and Jones, 1970; 
Domergue, 1970).  Crump and Suarez (1977) hypothesized that the presence of abundant ground water 
and high-grade mineralized outcrop at the base of the open pit imply that the Romans abandoned the 
mine due to problems of draining below the local water table rather than because the deposit had been 
mined out.

7.0 GEOLOGIC SETTING AND MINERALIZATION  
 
The following information has been taken from Agnerian (2004, 2010), Tenorio (2011; Tenorio et al., 
2013), Martínez Catalán et al. (2013), Valdés Suárez (2012), Rodriguez Terente (2007), Nieto (2004), 
McMillin (1991), Bastida et al. (1986), Harris (1979), Crump and Suarez (1977), Müller (1971), and 
other references as cited. 
 
7.1 Geologic Setting 
 
7.1.1 Regional Geology 
 
The Salave gold deposit is located within the West Asturian–Leonese Zone ("WALZ") of the 
northwestern portion of the Hercynian Iberian Massif (Figure 7.1).  The Hercynian, or Variscan, orogen 
consists of rocks of Late Proterozoic to Carboniferous age that were deformed, often metamorphosed, 
and intruded during the collision of Laurasia and Gondwana in Late Devonian to Carboniferous time 
(370 to 290 Ma).  The WALZ represents the transition between unmetamorphosed foreland areas 
(Cantabrian Zone) situated to the east and the more internal zones of the Hercynian orogen to the west 
(Central Iberian Zone) (Figure 7.1).   
 
The Cantabrian Zone contains the continental part of the Paleozoic succession, with relatively small 
thicknesses of pre-orogenic sedimentary rocks that were deformed in a foreland thrust belt.  In contrast, 
the WALZ contains a nearly continuous series of Cambro-Ordovician to Carboniferous clastic siliceous 
and carbonate rocks approximately 11,000 meters thick, which has undergone intense deformation.  The 
Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of the WALZ were deposited unconformably on Upper Proterozoic rocks 
that are not exposed in the Salave project area.  Proterozoic rocks are found on the eastern and western 
edges of the WALZ in the cores of two antiforms (Figure 7.1).  Silurian to Carboniferous rocks are also 
not exposed in the Salave project area.     
 
Compressional tectonics during the Hercynian orogeny formed east- and northeast-directed overturned 
and recumbent folds as well as major thrust faults.  Three phases of deformation affected the WALZ: 
 

 The first deformation phase (D1) produced eastward-verging recumbent folds.  The primary slaty 
cleavage or schistosity (S1) developed during D1. 

 The  second  deformation  phase  (D2)  was  responsible  for  the  appearance  of thrusts, 
associated sub-horizontal shear zones, and related structures.  The largest of the thrust sheets is 
the Mondoñedo nappe.  A variety of fault breccias, shear folds, crenulation cleavages or 
schistosities (S2), and mylonitic zones are related to this phase. 

 The third deformation phase (D3) gave rise to large, upright open folds with steep axial planes 
plus minor folds and local development of crenulation cleavage (S3).  Locally there is also a 
system of transverse folds, which, when superimposed on the earlier D3 folds, produced 
interference patterns.   

 
Figure 7.2 shows both a plan view and cross section illustrating the complex compressional deformation 
that has affected the WALZ, with – from west to east –  stacked recumbent folds verging toward the 
east, thrusts, and then large open folds with sub-vertical axial planes located farther to the east.

The morphology of the coastline near Salave is controlled by northeast-trending and moderately to 
steeply northwest-dipping, upright to isoclinally folded metasedimentary rocks.  Northwest-trending 
faults have acted as secondary control to the coastline morphology. 
 
The Bay of Biscay developed in Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous time as Iberia slowly separated from 
northern Europe along one arm of a tensional triple junction. 
 
Hercynian magmatism covers a time span of approximately 70 Ma (from 350 Ma to 280 Ma) and took 
place during the waning stages of the Hercynian collision.  Syntectonic intrusions that include 
peraluminous to strongly peraluminous monzogranites and leucogranites were emplaced during the D2 
and D3 deformational events.  Post-tectonic granodiorite-monzogranite intrusions with some 
leucogranite were emplaced after the main phases of Hercynian crustal shortening.  These post-tectonic 
intrusions are mainly responsible for the Salave gold deposit and the gold-copper deposits of El Valle-
Boinas and Carlés, as well as other gold prospects in the northern Iberian Peninsula. 
 
Synkinematic regional metamorphism, contact metamorphism related to intrusions, and retrograde 
metamorphism have affected the rocks within the WALZ.  The Salave plutonic complex is mainly 
within the biotite zone, but in the vicinity of granitic intrusions, the andalusite-cordierite and locally 
garnet isograds are reached.

7.1.2 Local Geology 
 
The Tapia area is dominated by a thick sequence of Upper Cambrian to Ordovician metasedimentary 
rocks that includes the Los Cabos Series and Luarca and Aqüeira formations (Crump and Suarez, 1977).  
These rocks are predominantly arenaceous to argillaceous metasedimentary units with quartzite, 
greywacke, and black graphitic and pyritic schist and slate as important members of the succession.  A 
number of oolitic ironstone horizons are present in the Luarca Formation that crops out in the Porcia 
area.  These metasedimentary rocks strike northeast and generally dip west. 
 
The Mondoñedo nappe consists of low- to medium-grade metasedimentary rocks that were folded by 
east-verging recumbent structures during the first phase of deformation and then thrust several tens of 
kilometers toward the east during the second deformation phase (Bastida et al., 1986).  A shear zone up 
to three kilometers thick was developed at the base of the thrust sheet, deforming granitoid bodies that 
were intruded after D1 and before or during D2.  The north-northeast-trending Mondoñedo thrust that 
passes just east of the Salave project is one of the major Hercynian thrust faults and separates the large 
stack of recumbent folds and thrusts of the Mondoñedo nappe to the west from an area of smaller and 
more open folds to the east (Figure 7.2).  Late- to post-Hercynian intrusions, such as the Salave 
granodiorite, were likely channeled by these crustal-scale thrusts (Knutsen, 1991b).  The Salave plutonic

complex was emplaced just at the eastern border of the Mondoñedo nappe.  The Salave deposit lies in 
the Mondoñedo nappe, close to its thrust contact with the Narcea antiform to the east. 
 
In the Tapia area, the metasedimentary rocks are intruded by three west-northwest-trending plutons that 
range in composition from gabbro to granodiorite (Figure 7.3).  These plutons are aligned along a west-
northwest-trending strike-slip fault that predated the intrusions.  The close proximity, mineralogical 
similarities, and single metamorphic aureole of these intrusions suggest they have a common parent 
magma (Crump and Suarez, 1977).  
 
7.1.3 Property Geology 
 
Most of the Salave project area is covered by Quaternary marine sediments ranging from a few 
centimeters to over 70 meters thick.  The scarcity of outcrops, which are largely confined to coastal 
cliffs, makes geologic mapping of the property difficult. 
 
The Salave concessions are situated at the eastern border of the Mondoñedo nappe, which is separated 
from a less-deformed area to the east by the basal thrust of the nappe – the Mondoñedo thrust.  West of 
the Mondoñedo thrust, and within the Salave property, the area is underlain by quartzite, sandstone, 
argillite, shale, and greywacke of the Cambro-Ordovician Los Cabos Series that have been 
metamorphosed to slate, arenite, quartzite, and graphitic slates (Figure 7.3).  The Mondoñedo thrust 
places the Upper Cambrian Los Cabos Series over the Upper Ordovician Agüeira Formation.  Where the 
metasedimentary rocks are intruded by igneous rocks, contact metamorphism takes the form of biotite 
and pyroxene hornfels, with cordierite, andalusite, and local garnet, which is superimposed on the 
greenschist-grade regional metamorphism exhibited by rocks beyond the contact aureole. 
 
The Salave deposit is underlain by granodiorite, which is a small part of the Porcia Intrusive Complex 
that extends approximately four kilometers, from Rio Porcia to Represas Playa just east of Tapia.  The 
granodiorite crops out in the western part of the complex.  To the south, the complex is covered by thin 
Quaternary alluvium.  The igneous rocks in the Salave area are directly related to the mineralization and 
comprise several stocks and dikes whose ages range from 330 to 287 Ma.   
 
Oxidation is not intensive and extends for a few meters below the surface (Anglo American Corporation 
of South Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982), except along larger faults and 
structural zones where it can locally exceed 200 meters vertically.

7.1.3.1 Igneous Rocks at Salave 
 
The igneous rocks at Salave range in composition from gabbro to granodiorite.  Important plutons are 
discussed individually below. 
 
Salave Granodiorite 
 
The Salave gold deposit is primarily hosted by the Salave granodiorite.  From outcrops and drill holes, 
an elongate shape has been deduced for this pluton; the Salave granodiorite is thought to be a large dike 
(Hutchison, 1983; Nieto, 2004).  It has a west-northwest trend and is interpreted to cover an area 
approximately two kilometers by 500 meters.  In the area of Los Lagos, at the old Roman open pit, roof-
pendants and apophyses of metasedimentary rocks occur within the Salave granodiorite (Figure 7.4).   
 
Two samples of unaltered Salave granodiorite from outcrops south of the highway at Cantón yielded an 
average  apparent minimum K-Ar age on biotite of 291.71 + 9.56 Ma (Harris, 1979).  This and other K-
Ar ages reported by Harris (1979) were corrected with new decay constants by Harris; in the text of his 
report, he uses uncorrected ages to facilitate comparison with previous studies.  Rb-Sr dating of biotite 
from the Salave granodiorite yielded an age of 287 ± 8 Ma (Rodriguez Terente, 2007, citing Suarez et 
al., 1978). 
 
Where it is unaltered, the granodiorite appears as a hard, black-and-white, slightly porphyritic rock.  It 
has a hypidiomorphic-granular texture, and the main minerals are plagioclase (40%), quartz (30%), 
biotite (15%), potassium feldspar (10-15%), and muscovite (1%).  Due to its variable potassium-feldspar 
content, it often passes into the quartz diorite or tonalite range but is widely referred to as 
"granodiorite." 
 
Salave and Porcía Gabbros 
 
The Salave and Porcía gabbros extend over an area of 2.5 kilometers by 0.6 kilometers in two main 
bodies from El Figo beach to the western bank of the Porcía River.  These igneous bodies are the oldest 
intrusions in the area, and gabbro xenoliths frequently occur in the granodiorite.  The contacts of gabbro 
with the metasedimentary rocks are sharp; xenoliths of the metasedimentary rocks are common in the 
gabbros.  A very fresh sample of the Porcía gabbro has yielded an apparent minimum K-Ar age on 
biotite of 329.95 ± 10.60 Ma (Harris, 1979), and gabbro has also yielded a U-Pb age on zircon of 295 + 
3 Ma (Rodriguez Terente, 2007, citing Suarez et al., 1978). 
 
Sericitic and chloritic alteration and carbonatization observed in some of the gabbros are generally 
fracture controlled, but no significant mineralization is found in the gabbros. 
 
Punta Campega Granite 
 
This rock is described as microgranite or aplitic granite and intrudes the Salave gabbro just at the 
shoreline.  It is a leucocratic equigranular rock, with allotriomorphic textures, formed by quartz, 
sericitized plagioclase, potassium feldspar, sericitized chlorite, and iron oxides.  The intrusion has a 
slightly reddish appearance.

Dikes 
 
Porphyritic  dikes  of  dacitic  to  rhyodacitic  to  andesitic  composition  occur  in  the Salave area.  
They range from a few centimeters to over a meter in width, and where unaltered, are dark colored and 
composed of feldspar, biotite, and generally rounded quartz phenocrysts in a very fine-grained matrix of 
similar composition that is typically altered to sericite. 
 
Dikes are older than the hydrothermal alteration and mineralization, and they are affected by the same 
events as the granodiorite. 
 
Represas Intrusions 
 
The Represas area lies just to the east of Tapia and less than 1.5 kilometers west of the westernmost 
known extension of the Salave granodiorite, to which these intrusions are probably genetically related.  
Three main types of igneous rocks are observed in this area: fine- grained biotite-rich granodiorite; a 
very quartz-rich granodiorite with lesser amount of mica; and a small outcrop of pinkish rhyodacite 
porphyry with quartz, chlorite, and altered feldspar in a matrix of quartz and potassium feldspar. 
 
The Represas intrusions appear to have been controlled by the same steeply-dipping, northwest-trending 
fault system that controlled the emplacement of the Salave granodiorite. 
 
Two samples of granodiorite from Represas yielded a K-Ar age on biotite of 276.93 + 9.01Ma, and one 
sample of rhyodacite from Tapia yielded an age of 283.63 + 9.25 Ma (Harris, 1979).   
 
7.1.3.2 Structure at Salave 
 
Metasedimentary rocks in the Salave region were affected by the three main stages of the Hercynian 
deformation described in Section 7.1.1 and show the corresponding folding, faulting, and cleavages.  
The morphology of the local coastline reflects northwest- and northeast-trending systems of fractures 
and faults, which also appear to be significant in localizing mineralization. 
 
Northwest- to west-northwest-trending faults are parallel to the general shape of the Salave granodiorite 
and may have provided a conduit for the emplacement of the granodiorite as well as the Salave and 
Porcía gabbros.  Several gold-bearing quartz veins in the metasedimentary rocks and several porphyry 
dikes are localized in high-angle northwest-trending structures. 
 
The northeast-trending structural system is parallel to regional Hercynian structures (bedding, folding, 
thrusting, and late faulting).  Contacts (except where faulted) between the metasedimentary rocks and 
the Salave granodiorite are oriented in a north-northeasterly direction.  Lithologic contacts may have 
been overprinted by subsequent faulting and/or brecciation, as evidenced by the north-northeast-trending 
breccia zone situated in the northeastern corner of Figure 7.4.  In the Salave area, the basal thrust of the 
Mondoñedo nappe, many porphyry dikes, some gold-bearing quartz veins in the metasedimentary rocks, 
and the tabular zone that encases the various mineralized horizons of the Salave deposit, trend northeast 
(Nieto, 2004). 
 
Mapping and subsequent structural analysis by Newmont in the Salave pit and to the northeast of the pit 
identified four major fault trends (McMillin, 1991):  1) an east-west trend is strongest on the west side of

the pit; 2) a steeply dipping  N20°E trend is strongest toward the center of the pit; 3) a N40°E trend with 
moderate to steep dips to the northwest is strongest toward the east side of the pit; and 4) faults with a 
N40°W trend and dipping steeply to the southwest are crosscut by most other generations of faults but 
appear to guide the distribution of intrusive rocks and possibly gold mineralization.  Bedding in the 
metasedimentary rocks strikes N20°E and dips 40 to 60° NW.  Much of the faulting has occurred along 
bedding planes (McMillin, 1991).  Intrusive-metasedimentary rock contacts in core and outcrop are 
largely conformable, suggesting that the granodiorite intrusion was sill-like and passive (McMillin, 
1991). 
 
Analysis of historic, oriented drill-core data from six holes revealed that if fractures are parallel to 
bedding, bedding strikes N34°E and dips 33° NW (Barclay, 2013).  A second dominant subset of 
joints/veins that cut both intrusive and metasedimentary rocks strikes N66°W and dips 46°SW, nearly 
perpendicular to the overall trend of bedding in metasedimentary rocks.  This subset of data may be 
much more pertinent to the distribution of gold since both rock types host gold mineralization, and 
mineralization apparently straddles the upper contact of the intrusion with metasedimentary rocks 
(Barclay, 2013).

7.2 Mineralization 
 
The Salave deposit is located in the Oscos gold belt, a gold district in the Hercynian massif on the 
northwestern Iberian Peninsula.  The Oscos belt is one of four mineralized belts that trend northeast or 
north-northeast in the region (Agnerian, 2010, citing Spiering et al., 2000).  
 
The Salave gold deposit is hosted mainly by the Salave granodiorite at its western boundary, close to the 
contact with the Los Cabos Series.  The mineralized units occur within an area approximately 400 
meters wide, 500 meters long, and at least 350 meters deep.  Gold mineralization occurs in a series of 
stacked, north- to north-northwest-trending, shallowly west-dipping irregular lenses related to faults and 
fracture zones that are parallel to the contact of the intrusive and metasedimentary rocks.  The 
fault/fracture zones appear to be related to one or more vertical structures, at least some of which contain 
high-grade mineralization and which probably acted as conduits for hydrothermal solutions.  Anglo 
(Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982) noted 
that the physical attitude of the sheeted alteration-mineralization zones mirrors that of the overlying 
metasedimentary rocks.  In places, these lenses may be sub-horizontal.  The dimensions of the individual 
mineralized zones range from 50 meters to 300 meters in length, 10 meters to 150 meters in width, and 
five meters to 60 meters in thickness, with an average thickness on the order of 20 meters.  The 
thickness is dependent on the number of contact-parallel fractures and their influence on the fracturing 
of the surrounding rock.  Narrow zones of gold mineralization are also present within the Los Cabos 
metasedimentary rocks. 
 
At least two types of mineralization have been described in the western portion of the Salave 
granodiorite: a molybdenite-rich type and the volumetrically much more important gold-rich type 
(Knutsen, 1991b; Puig P., 1991; Rodriguez Terente, 2007).  The first type contains molybdenite with 
small amounts of bismuthinite.  Different stages of quartz veining contain sulfides, including 
molybdenite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, stibnite, and minor chalcopyrite.  This type of 
mineralization occurs in sub-vertical quartz veins hosted both by metasedimentary rocks and 
granodiorite and was formed by a low-salinity magmatic fluid at minimum temperatures between 210°C 
and 300°C.  The molybdenite was remobilized by the later hydrothermal stage.   
 
The later and volumetrically more important gold-rich mineralization occurs with intense albite and 
muscovite (phengite) alteration.  Gold occurs both disseminated and in veins and is primarily associated 
with acicular disseminated arsenopyrite and variable amounts of pyrite and stibnite.  The gold 
mineralization occurs close to near-vertical and gently west-dipping fractures in the granodiorite.  
Mineralizing fluids rose through the near-vertical fractures and then extended through the low-angle 
fractures towards the surface, giving rise to an asymmetric "fir-tree geometry" (Figure 7.5) (Rodriguez 
Terente, 2007).  Ar/Ar dating of sericitic alteration yielded an age of 295.4+1.6 Ma (Rodriguez Terente, 
2007).  The gold mineralization formed by magmatic, low-salinity fluids with a minimum temperature 
of around 350°C in the deepest zones close to the feeder.  
 
Rodriguez Terente (2007) proposed that the gold mineralization appears to have two stages.  An arsenic-
rich stage, characterized by gold-rich arsenopyrite, pyrite, and native gold, makes up most of the Salave 
deposit.  Randomly superimposed on this mineralization is a second antimony-rich stage, characterized 
by stibnite, sphalerite, lead-antimony and silver-antimony sulfosalts, scheelite, and gold.  Gold occurs 
within arsenopyrite and as native gold in micro-fractures, veins, and on the edge of arsenopyrite, pyrite, 
and stibnite crystals.

Gold mineralization at Salave is related to hydrothermal alteration of the host granodiorite, although 
Anglo (Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982) 
noted that isolated gold values have been found in unaltered granodiorite.  Alteration is zoned from fresh 
rock, to chlorite-sericite alteration, then albitic alteration, and finally advanced sericitic-albite-carbonate 
alteration, which usually contains the highest gold values.  The zoning of alteration reflects increasing 
sericitization, albitization, and desilicification.  The alteration was accompanied by the introduction and 
development of carbonate minerals, principally dolomite, as narrow veinlets, especially in shears, faults, 
and joints.  Destruction of the original texture is a major feature of the most intensively altered and 
mineralized granodiorite.   
 
Figure 7.5 shows the distribution of alteration and mineralization at Salave on a northwest-southeast 
cross section, as well as the previously mentioned fir-tree geometry.  Figure 7.6 is a map of the geology 
and alteration on and adjacent to the Salave concessions.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPE 
 
Gold mineralization at Salave is largely intrusive hosted and is structurally controlled.  The 
mineralization is localized within a 350 to 400-meter-wide corridor that hosts a set of generally north- to 
north-northwest-trending and gently west-dipping to almost flat-lying mineralized zones. 
 
Gold mineralization at Salave is related to hydrothermal alteration of the host granodiorite.  The highest 
gold grades are associated with intense albite-sericite alteration with fine-grained arsenopyrite, 
commonly disseminated as fine needles.  Other sulfide minerals, such as pyrite and stibnite, are also 
associated with the gold mineralization.  Destruction of the original texture is a major feature of the most 
intensively altered and mineralized granodiorite.  Quartz veins, although present, do not contain the 
gold-arsenopyrite assemblage, and their presence is largely due to desilicification and re-precipitation of 
quartz remote from the main mineralized area.  The quartz-carbonate molybdenite-bearing veins present 
in the deposit do not contain gold and represent a separate mineralizing event. 
 
Harris (1979) established the following tentative genetic model for the sequence of events that might 
have resulted in the Salave gold deposit: 
 

 The Salave granodiorite was intruded into the gabbro and metasedimentary rocks during the end 
of the Hercynian orogeny; 

 Volatiles (H2O-CO2-H2S) driven from the surrounding country rocks travelled along major 
structures.  These fluids encountered the cooling granodiorite causing the resulting alteration and 
mineralization.  Whether the introduced As, Sb, Mo, Au, Zn, W, and B were scavenged from the 
metasedimentary rocks or were an igneous contribution is unclear. 

 The alteration assemblages and the mineralization were the result of a roughly isochemical 
redistribution of the original chemical composition of the granodiorite under the new pressure, 
temperature, and fluid composition.  The fluids are interpreted to have been near neutral 
solutions, at temperatures in the range from 250ºC to 350ºC, with sporadic episodes of boiling. 

 Late stage faulting provided oxidizing conditions. 
 Faulting and deposition of carbonate continued for some time following the cessation of the main 

alteration and mineralization events. 
 
Harris (1979) and other early workers initially characterized the Salave deposit as a type of porphyry 
deposit, but Harris demonstrated that Salave's sulfide assemblage and associated hydrothermal alteration 
were strikingly different from even the very gold-rich porphyries.   
 
Gold mineralization in intrusive rocks generally contains large amounts of copper sulfides, unlike 
Salave, or lacks the alteration types seen at Salave.  An exception may be Au-Mo deposits of eastern 
Transbeikalia, in which arsenopyrite, pyrite, molybdenite, scheelite, and gold are disseminated in 
granodiorites that have been affected by sericitization, carbonatization, and more rarely by chloritization 
and pyritization  (Harris, 1979).  Gold Fields had also noted the following similarities between Salave 
and deposits in the eastern Transbeikal Russia and to Au-Mo deposits of Darasum and Dzhalinda, 
specifically (Crump and Suarez, 1977): 
 

 Mineralization associated with small, oval stocks of typically quartz-diorite porphyry 
composition, with Au-Mo deposits generally associated with granodiorite intrusions;

 Mineralization consisting of arsenopyrite, pyrite, scheelite, antimonite, and gold; and 
 Alteration including sericitization, carbonatization, and, more rarely, chloritization and 

pyritization. 
 
Rodriguez Terente (2007) proposed that the Salave deposit is a mesothermal-type gold deposit hosted by 
a granodiorite intrusion and developed in the latest episode of the collisional Hercynian orogeny.  RPA 
(Agnerian, 2004, 2010) concluded that the gold mineralization at Salave is related to albitization within 
a wide shear zone in the host intrusive rocks. 
 
Harris (1979) proposed the "Salave type" gold deposit as one formed in any kind of feldspar-quartz- 
ferromagnesian rock, probably in an area of major tectonism, with a zoned alteration sequence of 
decreasing carbonatization, albitization, desilicification, sericitization, and texture-destruction away 
from the disseminated gold mineralization, which is associated with pyrite, arsenopyrite, stibnite, and 
minor amounts of other base-metal sulfides. 
 
Harris (1979) cited literature review by Gallagher (1940), who noted that gold deposits related to 
albitization almost always occur in quartz-carbonate gangues with associated sericitization-
chloritization.  Pyrite was always present, and arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite were common to many.   
 
More recently Poulsen et al. (2000) published a classification system based on observations on a wide 
range of gold deposits occurring in Canada.  The classification is not restricted to Canadian deposits and 
draws on examples from around the world.  Astur staff believe that Salave appears to best fit the "non-
carbonate stockwork disseminated deposits" model, which is described by Poulsen et al. (2000) as 
follows:  
 

"This poorly defined group of deposits includes the Andacollo gold deposit in Chile, the 'stage 
I' mineralization at Porgera, Papua New Guinea, and perhaps the bulk of the ore at Muruntau, 
Uzbekistan.  This deposit type consists of discordant to stratabound stockwork and 
disseminated sulphide zones along faults, permeable units, and lithological contacts (including 
intrusive contacts) in miogeoclinal siliciclastic and volcaniclastic sequences in volcano-
plutonic arcs in oceanic and continental settings. The deposits are hosted mostly by 
supracrustal rocks, but in cases where felsic sills, dykes, and stocks are present, the ore may 
also occur within and along the contacts of intrusions (Sillitoe, 1991a). 
 
Disseminated sulphide minerals (1–20 volume per cent) are mostly pyrite, with smaller 
amounts of chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite, accompanied by hematite, magnetite, tellurides, and 
anhydrite in some deposits.  The ores have variable, but generally gold-rich, compositions 
(Au:Ag > 1) and contain elevated concentrations of copper, arsenic, bismuth, tellurium ± 
tungsten, fluorine, and boron.  Associated alteration involves potassium metasomatism 
(sericite, biotite, or K-feldspar) and/or sodium metasomatism (albite), typically accompanied 
by carbonatization and, in some deposits, silicification."

(2000).

9.0  EXPLORATION 
 
Astur acquired the Salave gold project in 2010. 
 
Very little exploration work has been undertaken by or on behalf of Astur since acquisition of the 
property.  Exploration undertaken by prior operators is summarized in Section 6.1.   
 
In 2013, Astur contracted for a structural analysis to assist in modeling of the mineralization.  Oriented-
core data were analyzed from the following six historic drill holes by W. A. Barclay Exploration 
Services Ltd. (Barclay, 2013):  RN02, RN13, GT1, GT2, GT3, and GT4.  The principal conclusion of 
this study was that one particular subset of fracture/joint/vein orientations (with a strike and dip of 114° / 
46o SW) appears to control gold distribution at the Salave deposit.  These fractures/joints extend across 
the contact between upper intrusive and metasedimentary rocks.  In granodiorite, this subset of fractures 
exhibits a mean orientation with a strike and dip of 114o / 46o SW.  In metasedimentary host rocks, these 
fractures exhibit a mean orientation of 127o / 57o SW.  The moderate difference in fractures/joints 
orientation between the host rocks plausibly can be attributed to refraction of fracture orientations across 
the rheologic contact between them.  The moderate south-southwest dip of this fracture/joint subset may 
correlate with progressively deeper distribution of gold mineralization at Salave to the south-southwest.  
It is recommended that joint/vein data be compiled exclusively from mineralized zones, which could 
result in a better interpretation of the controlling structures.  
 
Astur began infill core drilling in September 2013 and drilled geotechnical core holes to establish 
geotechnical characteristics of the rock in December 2011, December 2012, and May 2013.  Astur's 
drilling is discussed in Section 10.10. 
 
Metallurgical work conducted for Astur is described in Section 13.8. 
 
Tenorio (2011) reported that there were geophysical anomalies that had not been drill tested.  It is 
recommended that these be evaluated for future testing. 
 
A relatively steeply dipping high-grade zone has been intersected near the northwestern edge of the 
deposit.  This structure has been traced on a number of cross-sections through the deposit and has good 
continuity from section to section.  Most of the exploration at Salave has been by vertical drill holes.  
Although most mineralized zones appear to be shallowly dipping, this high-grade zone is different.  The 
definition of the high-grade zone can be improved by drilling more inclined drill holes.  Other nearly 
vertical zones could easily have been missed due to the predominance of vertical drilling.   
 
Other steeply dipping structural zones that appear to be highly mineralized have been observed by the 
author on ocean cliff faces.  These zones should be explored.

10.0 DRILLING   
 
10.1 Summary  
 
Nine companies have drilled the Salave property, starting with IMEBESA in 1970 and continuing 
through Astur in 2013.  Those companies are IMEBESA, Rio Tinto, Gold Fields, Anglo, Oromet, 
Newmont, Lyndex, Rio Narcea, and Astur.  As described in Sections 6.0 and 9.0, at least 345 core holes, 
including holes lost before reaching target depth, and 139 percussion/RC holes have been drilled at 
Salave, including some holes drilled outside the current property boundary.  Most of the drill holes for 
which data are available are vertical holes.  Those holes included in the Salave database used by MDA 
are listed on Table 10.1, and those holes drilled in the vicinity of the resource estimate are shown on 
Figure 10.1.

Figure 10.1  Location of Drill Holes in the Vicinity of the Salave Resource 
 

 
 
10.2 Drilling by IMEBESA 
 
IMEBESA drilled 34 inclined core holes (holes 1-3, 3A, 4-25, 26A, 26B, 27-32) totaling 7.026.4 meters 
in 1970 and 1971, of which all but holes 3A and 26A are in the database provided to MDA.  
IMEBESA's drilling in 1970 through DDH9 was contracted to Cimentaciones y Sondeos SA of Madrid 
(Müller, 1971).  As often as possible and with few exceptions from DDH3 through DDH9 (the last hole 
drilled as of the time of the report), individual core samples represented three-meter drill intersections 
(Müller, 1971). 
 
MDA has no information on the drill contractor and type of rig or procedures used for IMEBESA's 
remaining holes and no information on the size of core drilled for any of their holes.  The IMEBESA 
drill holes were not used in the resource estimation due to check-assaying issues pointed out by Rio 
Tinto and Gold Fields and because drill-hole locations could not be verified.

10.3 Drilling by Rio Tinto 
 
Rio Tinto drilled 10 vertical core holes (holes numbered 33 to 42) totaling 2,014 meters in 1971-1972.  
Down-hole survey data are not available for the Rio Tinto drill holes.  They contracted with Agua y 
Suelo Company as drilling contractors, who used two rigs:  a Longyear 38 and a Craelius D-750.  
Drilling was with NQ and BQ core.  Recovery always exceeded 95% and reached 100% for large 
intervals (Ayala, 1973).   
 
Core logging paid special attention to petrography, structure, alteration, and mineralization.  Each core 
box was marked with the depths, and core recovery was calculated.  All mineralized zones were 
prepared and analyzed.  All sample intervals measured one meter.  Core was split lengthwise with a 
mechanical splitter, and one half was placed back into the box; the other half was sent for analysis.  
When the condition of the core did not permit splitting, the sample was crushed and divided into two 
parts with the riffle splitter.  
 
Thomas (1982) reported that as of that time when Anglo was evaluating the property, there were assay 
sheets but no logs or records of core recovery for Rio Tinto's drilling.    
 
10.4 Drilling by Gold Fields 
 
The following information was taken from Crump and Suarez (1977), with information from additional 
references as cited. 
 
Gold Fields drilled eight core holes (holes 43 through 50) totaling approximately 1,855 meters in 1976.  
Some previous references listed only seven Gold Fields core holes, excluding hole 49, but Harris (1979) 
indicated hole 49 was drilled, although it is likely that this hole was lost prior to reaching mineralization.  
All but one of the holes were inclined; one was vertical, with limited down-hole survey information. 
 
Gold Fields contracted with Compania General de Sondeos to conduct the drilling at Salave, which 
began in January 1976.  Two types of drills were used:  a Longyear 38 and a Craelius D-750.  Most of 
the drilling was of NQ and BQ diameter. 
 
With the exception of holes 44 and 46, recovery exceeded 95%.  Those two holes encountered highly 
fractured rock, and core recovery approximated 80% overall.  Sludge samples were collected routinely 
for every run on all holes. 
 
Samples for analysis were two meters in length.  Where practicable, core was cut with a diamond saw 
prior to preparation; one half was prepared, and the other kept in storage.  In sections where the rock 
was extensively broken, the core was jaw and roller crushed prior to splitting.  All core was analyzed for 
drill holes 43 through 48, but in hole 50, the visually barren sections were left unprepared.  
 
10.5 Drilling by Anglo 
 
During their tenure on the Salave project from 1981 to 1988, Anglo drilled 99 core holes totaling 
15,412.14 meters and an additional 22 FM- series shallow core holes totaling 1,080.45 meters that were 
drilled in 1984 on another property Anglo held for one year just off the southeast corner of the present 
Salave property.  In addition, Anglo drilled 26 percussion holes (H- series) totaling 116 meters.

Two drill rigs were used in Anglo's initial core drilling in 1981 (Anglo, 1981a) and were also being used 
in 1983, when they were drilling HQ core (Charter Exploraciones S.A., 1983a).  For the drilling 
completed in 1983, the drill contractor was Drillsure (Charter Exploraciones S.A., 1983a).  MDA has no 
information on the drill contractor used for Anglo's other core drilling.  
 
All of the Anglo core drill holes were vertical, with down-hole survey information available for all of 
the holes. 
 
Core was sawn longitudinally, with halves of core, taken in approximately two-meter lengths, sent for 
assay (Hutchison, 1986). 
 
A small percussion drill was used to drill the 26 H- series holes (Hutchison, 1982, 1983), but a high 
water table in the area south and east of the old Roman workings where these holes were drilled severely 
limited the effectiveness of this percussion drilling (Hutchison, 1982).  These 26 holes are not in the 
database used for the resource estimate for this report. 
 
10.6 Drilling by Oromet S.A. 
 
Oromet completed 503 meters of shallow core drilling in 20 holes (12.5-meter by 12.5-meter grid) in the 
central part of the old Roman pit in 1988.  Summaries of drill logs reviewed by MDA indicate core was 
sampled on two-meter intervals and analyzed for gold.  MDA has no further information about drill 
contractors, the type of rig used, or drilling procedures. 
   
10.7 Drilling by Newmont 
 
Newmont reportedly drilled a total of 5,870.45 meters in 29 HQ-diameter, vertical core holes plus two 
failed reverse circulation ("RC") holes totaling 181.05 meters (Knutsen, 1991b); however, the database 
provided to MDA includes 34 holes totaling 6,076.05 meters (holes NSC01-05, NSC05A, NSC05B, 
NSC05C, NSC06-19, NS-21-22, NSC24-31, NSR20, and NSR23).  The difference appears to be that 
Knutsen (1991b) did not include the three additional NSC05 core holes lettered A-C.  The database 
provided to MDA also showed 202.5 meters as the total of the two RC holes, rather than the 181.05 
meters reported by Knutsen (1991b).  Down-hole survey data are included in the drill-hole database. 
 
The following information on Newmont's drilling is taken from Knutsen (1991b).  
 
Newmont's drilling was conducted by Drill Sure Limited Sucursal en Espana.  The drillers used two 
trailer-mounted Boyles BBS 56 or 37 rigs, according to the drill-contract specifications.  Drill Sure set 
116 millimeter conventional core casing into solid bedrock and drilled HQ wireline core to depths up to 
300 meters.  Knutsen (1991b) reported that core recovery was very good. 
 
An attempt was made to use RC down-hole hammer drilling, but problems with air leaks in the drill 
steel and the head drive precluded a viable test of the system.  The attempt was abandoned after drilling 
holes NSR20 and NSR23.  
 
Down-hole surveys were conducted in each hole using a down-hole Eastman camera; usually two 
surveys were conducted in each hole.

Because of proximity to the Bay of Biscay, Newmont paid particular attention to geotechnical 
evaluations (Knutsen, 1991b).  All drill core was photographed and geotechnically logged before 
cutting.  Information recorded included:  length of core run; core recovery; RQD; Rock Mass Rating 
("RMR"); fractures per meter of core; rock hardness; fracture type, orientation, and filling; and remarks 
relating to fracture sets.  Uniaxial compression tests were performed in conjunction with evaluation of 
geotechnical logging.  Piezometers were installed in 17 drill holes and monitored periodically.  They 
revealed fluctuations in the water level, which were tentatively correlated with tidal variations. 
 
10.8 Drilling by Lyndex 
 
Lyndex drilled 23 vertical core holes and 109 RC holes at Salave from October 1996 through December 
1997.  Down-hole survey information is available for the core drill holes.  In 2002, they drilled a 
percussion hole as a pilot for a proposed shaft.  The following information has been taken from Catuxo 
(1997) and Campos de Orellana Pardesa (2001a, 2003; and Lobo, 1997a), unless otherwise noted.   
 
Lyndex's 1996-1997 core drilling was conducted with three different rigs:  one with their own crew used 
their own Craelius 90 rig drilling NQ and BQ core; the other two rigs, from contracted drilling company 
Insersa, were a Longyear 44 and a Longyear 38, both truck mounted and drilling HQ and NQ core.  Core 
remaining after sampling was stored in waxed cardboard boxes kept in a warehouse the company 
maintained in the town of Barres.  Logging of the core placed special emphasis on alteration, structure, 
and geotechnical features of the core. 
 
Catuxo (1997) and Campos de Orellana Pardesa (2001a) identified 23 vertical core holes (S-96-1 and S-
97-1 through S-97-22) totaling 9,044.90 meters, although the database used by MDA had a total of 
9,077.65 meters for the same holes.  The Lyndex crew drilled holes S-96-1, S-97-1 through 3, 7, 11, 14, 
16, 18, and 20-22; the INSERSA crews drilled the remaining 11 core holes. 
 
The core was cut longitudinally.  Sample intervals were variable, depending on lithology and 
mineralization, but were a maximum of 1.5 meters; many were one meter, and some were 0.5 meter in 
length.  Initially, Lyndex only sampled sections rich in sulfides as had been done by previous operators, 
but later the remaining sections were analyzed and subsequent holes were sampled in their entirety.  
 
Geotechnical data were gathered on the 23 core holes, including RQD, RMR, structural discontinuities, 
fracture spacing, tensile strength, etc.  
 
Lyndex's RC drilling consisted of very shallow holes.  An Atlas-Copco Roc 203 rig was acquired by 
Lyndex in 1996 and used for this drilling with a contract drill crew.  This rig can use conventional 
drilling or reverse circulation with diameters of 131, 115, or 105 millimeters at the beginning and ending 
with 85 millimeters and can drill to a depth of 50 meters under optimum conditions (Campos de 
Orellana Pardesa and Lobo, 1997a; Campos de Orellana Pardesa, 2001a); however, 56 of the Lyndex 
holes exceeded 50 meters in depth with a maximum of 75 meters.  Campos de Orellana Pardesa (2001a) 
reported that Lyndex drilled 109 RC holes totaling 5,333 meters, but Agnerian (2010) reported that 
Lyndex drilled 102 holes totaling 5,454 meters; MDA cannot account for the difference.  MDA's 
database only includes 24 of the Lyndex RC drill holes, which were not used in the resource estimate. 
 
The down-hole hammer percussion hole drilled as a pilot for a proposed shaft in 2002 was drilled by 
Sondeos Principado, from Avilés, using a JR EFMS 3/2002 hydraulic drill on wheels with a #8 hammer

and 4/3 drill.  This hole was 30 centimeters in diameter and 200 meters deep.  The presence of 
Quaternary sediments and metasedimentary rocks in the first 42 meters of the hole caused problem with 
stability of the walls, which were addressed with ground-freezing techniques.  Water was encountered at 
a depth of nine meters, and at 15 meters in depth, with the appearance of granodiorite, the flow of water 
entering the hole was 0.5 l/sec.  In March 2003, four months after completion of the hole, the water level 
still stood at a depth of 10 meters.  No relationship was observed between water level in the hole and 
tides from completion of the hole on November 13, 2002 until water-level measurements stopped on 
March 15, 2003 (Campos de Orellana Pardesa, 2003). 
 
10.9 Drilling by Rio Narcea  
 
The following information is taken from Valdés Suárez (2012) and Agnerian (2010), with additional 
information provided by Astur and other references as cited. 
 
Rio Narcea drilled 79 holes from May 2004 to May 2005, of which five were geotechnical holes (RN01, 
GT1, GT2, GT3, and GT4) and two (Hidro1 and Hidro2) were for hydrological purposes (Astur, written 
communication and Rio Narcea news releases, September 17, 2004; May 11, 2005; May 13, 2005; July 
11, 2005).  Hidro1 and Hidro2 were RC holes; the remaining 77 holes were core.  The geotechnical and 
hydrological holes were sampled and assayed in the same manner as the resource holes, with the 
exception of Hidro1. 
 
Four rigs were used.  Astur reports that Rio Narcea used their own rig for holes RN01, 02, 07, 09, 12, 
35, 37, 42, 46, 48, 51, 59, 62, 68, 69, 71, 72, and 73, and that Sondeos y Perforaciones Industriales del 
Bierzo S.A. ("SPIB") of Leon, Spain, drilled the remaining holes with Longyear 38 and 44 machines 
plus an SPIB-built rig D640.  The core holes were drilled with HQ core.  The two RC holes were drilled 
by SPIB using their proprietary D640 rig, which had both RC and core capabilities. 
 
Core logging and sampling were performed at a warehouse in the town of Tapia.  Drill core was 
photographed and logged by Rio Narcea geologists.  The core was oriented and reference lines were 
drawn on the core before logging to ensure that no sampling bias was introduced during 
splitting/sawing.  RQD and core recovery measurements were done on intact core prior to 
lithologic/mineralogical logging.  Geologic data, core orientation, and additional geotechnical data were 
noted as part of the drill-hole logging.  Density measurements were taken at this time (see Section 
11.9.2).  Upon completion of the geotechnical work and lithologic logging, the handwritten forms were 
transferred to data entry personnel for conversion of the data into digital format.  The newly entered data 
were checked by the geologists until they were free of data-entry errors.  All the original forms related to 
a drill hole were kept in a separate file folder for future reference. 
 
Rio Narcea technicians sampled the whole drill core at regular intervals of 1.5 meters to 2.0 meters; 
sampling intervals were adjusted locally to honor changes in lithology.  The core was cut with a 
diamond saw.  Samples were bagged, put in large rice packing bags, and sent to the laboratory.   
 
10.9.1 Rio Narcea Collar and Down-Hole Surveys 
 
Nineteen of the 73 core holes were inclined, and 54 were drilled vertically.  All of Rio Narcea's drill-
hole collar locations were surveyed by Rio Narcea surveyors, and the coordinates were in the Universal

Transverse Mercator grid.  Hole deviation was measured by down-hole Flexit and Maxibor equipment 
and recorded directly into an onboard computer.   
 
10.10 Drilling by Astur Gold Corporation  
 
From late September until early November 2013, Astur drilled 10 resource holes totaling 3,031 meters.  
Drilling was done under contract by SPIB.  
 
The contractor provided two SPIB-manufactured core drill rigs.  The rigs employed were track mounted.  
All drill holes were collared using PQ equipment and then downsized to HQ, generally when entering 
more competent intrusive rocks.  Core recovery averaged about 90 – 95 % for the program, with the best 
recoveries in the intrusive rocks.  Figure 10.2 shows drilling in progress at Salave. 
 
The drill program was designed to complement an on-going resource estimate.  Holes were designed to 
provide infill information where previous drilling was considered too widespread for confidence in 
interpretation and to extend the size of known mineralized zones.  Two holes were also drilled to twin 
previous holes, one drilled by Lyndex and the other by Rio Narcea. 
 
Due to issues concerning surface rights and environmental concerns due to the proximity to the Salave 
Lakes, the area in which the drill holes could be collared was severely limited.  This necessitated drilling 
multiple holes from a single platform and drilling at azimuths and dips not considered ideal for the 
presumed geometry of the mineralization. 
 
All drill holes except for the two twin holes were inclined, while the twin holes were vertical.  
 
Down-hole surveying of the drill holes was performed by the SPIB drill crews, using a Reflex EZ- Shot.  
An initial measurement was taken at 15 meters downhole, then at 50 meters, and then at intervals of 50 
meters until the end of the hole.   
 
All drill-hole collars were surveyed by Topocad Ingeniera S. L. from Ribadeo, Galicia, Spain, using a 
Topcon GPT-7003 total station unit.  Surveying was done in ETRS89 UTM29 North. 

In addition to the resource drilling, Astur drilled four geotechnical core holes during 2011 to 2012 and 
an additional six geotechnical core holes in May 2013 for a total of 589.05 meters.  Terratec Geotecnia y 
Sondeos S.L. ("Terratec") was the drilling contractor, and all holes were drilled with HQ core.  Terratec 
used two rigs manufactured by Rolatec in Spain – Rolatec RL 48 L and Rolatec RL 800. 
 
The following description of sample preparation and core handling protocols applies to all drilling 
carried out by Astur on the Salave property.  Drill core is placed in wooden trays at the drill site by the 
drill crew.  The geologist prepares a quick log of the drill hole at the drill site, after which the core boxes 
are transported to the core logging facility by Astur personnel.  The drill site is kept secure by means of 
a fence and gate, and only authorized personnel have access.  
   
When the core is received at the core shack, it is immediately washed, reconstituted, and all distance 
markers checked for accuracy and clarity.  It is then photographed by Astur personnel.  The photos are 
captured digitally, and at the end of the day are downloaded into a directory of core photographs with a 
separate folder for each drill hole.  Core is photographed wet.

Once the geologist is ready to log the core, it is placed in order on the logging benches, and the core is 
reconstituted, if necessary.  The geologist verifies all the distance blocks and changes those that are in 
poor condition.  Labelling of the boxes is verified, corrected where necessary, and augmented by adding 
the down-hole distance (From-To) for each individual box.  Figure 10.3 shows the core-logging facility 
for the project.

Geotechnical logging is completed first, recording recovery and RQD, relative hardness, degree of 
weathering or oxidation, and fracture fillings.  Data are recorded onto paper sheets and then transferred 
to Excel before the end of each day.  For drill holes SA-3 and SA-6, additional geotechnical data, mostly 
fracture information, were recorded as these two holes were used for hydrologic testing. 
 
The core is descriptively logged and marked for sampling by Astur geologists.  Logging and sampling 
information is entered onto paper logging sheets, which are later scanned and stored on several 
computers.  Backups are made at regular intervals. 
 
After logging, the core is prepared for sampling.  A line is drawn down the core, and the cutter uses this 
as a guide. The entire intrusive section is marked for splitting as the mineralization is often very fine 
grained and difficult to identify.  The core is sampled at intervals of no more than 1.5 meters and no less 
than 0.3 meter.  The intervals shorter than 1.5 meters are selected where dictated by the geology in order 
to respect contacts or changes in character of the mineralization.    
 
Astur does not have a core saw on site due to permitting issues.  The core is transported by Astur 
personnel to a dimension stone cutting facility where it is cut under Astur supervision by a professional 
cutter (Figure 10.4).  The core is then returned to the logging facility where half of the drill core is 
placed in a plastic sample bag, while the other half is retained in the core box for future reference.   The 
sample number is written on the bag, and an assay tag with the same number placed inside the bag.   The 
samples and sample bags are numbered sequentially in advance, allowing for the insertion of standard 
reference samples, duplicates, and blanks.  The plastic sample bags are placed in larger rice bags, 
palletized, and wrapped for shipment to the laboratory by commercial transport.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS, AND SECURITY  
 
MDA has no information about measures taken by operators prior to Astur to ensure sample security; 
Astur's security measures are described in Section 10.10. 
 
Figure 11.1 summarizes the sample preparation and analysis procedures used by the operators at Salave 
prior to Astur that are described in Sections 11.1 through 11.8.  Astur's procedures are described in 
Section 11.9. 
 
11.1 IMEBESA Sampling 
 
The only information MDA has seen on sample preparation by IMEBESA is that shown on Figure 11.1 
and a similar figure in the 2010 Technical Report (Agnerian, 2010). 
 
IMEBESA's drill-core and surface samples taken in 1970 were analyzed by the following laboratories, 
as reported by Müller (1971): 
 

 Irish Base Metals Ltd., Exploration Dept. in Loughrea, Ireland – soil samples 
 Metals and Chemicals Ltd. in Cork, Ireland – soil samples 
 Instituto Geologico y Minero de España ("IGME") in Madrid, Spain – surface outcrop and drill-

core samples 
 Emprese Nacional Adaro de Investigaciones Mineras ("Adaro") in Madrid, Spain – drill-core 

samples 
 X Ray Assay Laboratories Ltd. ("XRAL") in Ontario, Canada – drill-core samples 
 Lakefield Research of Canada Ltd. ("Lakefield") in Ontario, Canada – preliminary metallurgical 

testing of drill-core material. 
 
A report by Rio Tinto in 1973 (Ayala, 1973) identified the laboratories who analyzed the drill samples 
of IMEBESA as IGME, Bell-White Analytical Laboratories Ltd. in Ontario ("Bell-White"), and 
Griffith-Iturribarria, S.A. but did not mention the other laboratories who analyzed drill-core samples 
listed above by Müller (1971).  MDA cannot reconcile these differences. 
 
Through their 1970 drilling, IMEBESA assayed all core samples for gold and molybdenum, with part of 
the samples also analyzed for arsenic, antimony, and silver (Müller, 1971).  Thomas (1982) reported that 
the first two holes were analyzed for As and Mo by colorimetry, but after that, As was dropped and Mo, 
Sb, and Ag were analyzed only sporadically.  Müller (1971) reported that molybdenum assays were 
conducted by IGME, Adaro, XRAL, and Lakefield, and that a comparison of the results indicated that 
IGME results were probably too high and XRAL's too low.  Adaro results appeared to be confirmed by 
the few Lakefield results (Müller, 1971). 
 
Rayment (1976) reported that as of 1976, approximately 50% of IMEBESA samples were missing.

11.2 Rio Tinto Sampling 
 
Rio Tinto crushed split core to six to eight millimeters in size with a jaw crusher.  The whole sample 
was then reduced to less than 10 mesh in size with a roll crusher.  A riffle splitter was used to obtain a 
sample of approximately 300 grams, which was sent to the laboratory for analysis; a second split was 
sent to archives.   
 
Rio Tinto's analyses were performed by their lab at Huelva (Harris, 1979).  The sample was pulverized 
to -270 mesh and quartered.  A 100-gram sample was sent for fire assay, while 200 grams were saved, 
with a fraction used for other determinations.  Although Rio Tinto's report by Ayala (1973) indicated 
100 grams were analyzed by fire assay, a later report by Anglo indicated samples were analyzed for 
gold, silver, molybdenum, arsenic, and sulfur by atomic absorption (Thomas, 1982), which may have 
referred to additional analyses.  Except for hole number 37, all samples were analyzed for gold, silver, 
and sulfur; arsenic was analyzed on all samples except for 29 samples from hole number 34 and eight 
from hole number 41; and molybdenum was analyzed in all samples except those from holes numbered 
38 and 40 as well as eight samples from hole 41 (Ayala, 1973).  Duplicate samples were analyzed by 
Rio Tinto's lab (Ayala, 1973).  Check assaying on Rio Tinto's samples was performed by Anglo 
American's laboratory in Salisbury, Rhodesia for 10 samples from drill holes 33, 34, and 35.   
 
11.2.1 Rio Tinto's Check of IMEBESA's Assays 
 
Rio Tinto acquired the Salave property in 1971.  Before conducting field work, Rio Tinto completed 
check assays on IMEBESA's reject core samples (Crump and Suarez, 1977).  Significant discrepancies 
between Rio Tinto's and IMEBESA's results are shown on Table 11.1, later compiled by Gold Fields 
from Rio Tinto's data (Crump and Suarez, 1977).  Rio Tinto felt that IMEBESA's assays tended to be 
higher than the actual amount, although their attempts to determine which were the accurate lab results 
were not conclusive (Ayala, 1973).  Crump and Suarez (1977) later noted that Rio Tinto's comparison of 
their assays and those of independent laboratories indicated that, comparatively, Rio Tinto was reporting 
low.

All Values 2.33 4.27 -45.43 

 
 
11.3 Gold Fields Sampling 
 
Gold Fields split core with a diamond saw then crushed it to less than five millimeters with a jaw 
crusher, followed by crushing with a rolls crusher to -30 mesh (Crump and Suarez, 1977).  Splitting 
produced a sample for storage and a 300-gram sample for analysis.  The 300-gram sample was 
pulverized with a disc pulverizer to -100 mesh (Harris, 1979).  A 50-gram split was sent to Gold Fields' 
Little Daugh laboratory for gold analysis by atomic absorption (Harris, 1979).  For every tenth sample, a

200-gram split was sent to Imperial Chemical Industries ("I.C.I."), a custom laboratory, for gold analysis 
by neutron activation (Harris, 1979).   
 
Thomas (1982) reported that all the Gold Fields core was analyzed for gold by atomic absorption; the 
majority was also tested for sulfur, and core from two of the holes was also analyzed for Mo, Sb, and 
As.  Drill logs indicate that the Mo, As, and Sb analyses were performed on holes 47 and 48; they were 
performed by Hunting Technical Services Ltd. ("Hunting;" now HTSPE Limited) in the United 
Kingdom; Harris (1979) reported that those analyses were made by colorimetry and noted that the same 
analyses were performed for Gold Fields on parts of holes 18, 22, 24, 28, 29, 32, 33, and 35.  Harris 
(1979) reported that a 50-gram sample was sent to Hunting or Robertson Research for analysis of silver, 
arsenic, antimony, molybdenum, and sulfur with variable frequency. 
 
Harris (1979) reported on the following procedures for Mo, Sb, and As used by Hunting: 

 Mo:  Digestion by HNO3 and HClO4 with leaching of the residue with dilute HCl.  No 
concentration determined spectrophotometrically.  The lower detection limit was 0.2 ppm Mo. 

 Sb:  Ammonium chloride digestion followed by leaching with dilute HCl and oxidation with 
sodium nitrate.  Sb concentration measured spectrophotometrically.  The lower detection limit 
was 0.5 ppm Sb. 

 As: Fusion with potassium bisulfate, followed by leaching with dilute HCl and addition of 
potassium iodide and stannous chlorite.  Zn pellets were added, and liberated arsine permeated 
filter paper impregnated with mercuric chloride.  Color was compared to standard color charts.  
The advertised lower detection limit is 5 ppm As.   

 
11.3.1 Gold Fields QA/QC 
 
Gold Fields established a QA/QC process to monitor their Little Daugh laboratory's performance that 
utilized "control samples" and check assays (Crump and Suarez, 1977; Harris, 1979).  Analyses of all 
IMEBESA, Rio Tinto, and Gold Fields samples at Gold Fields' Little Daugh laboratory routinely 
included 10% control samples.  Ten control samples were prepared from excess material remaining from 
previous inter-laboratory testing; mean values from the original replicate analysis of each sample were 
taken as the control to which all subsequent analyses were compared.  Control samples representative of 
all gold grades likely to be encountered in the drill hole were included in each batch of samples sent for 
assay.  After receiving assay results, Gold Fields analyzed the performance of the controls.  Splits of the 
same control samples along with duplicate samples covering the range of expected gold values were sent 
to I.C.I. for check assaying; I.C.I. used neutron activation. 
 
From September 1975 to May 1976, values for controls determined at the Little Daugh laboratory were 
approximately 5 to 10% lower than the original control values based on the earlier replicate analysis 
exercise (Rayment, 1976; Crump and Suarez, 1977).  Over the same period, the results from I.C.I. for 
the corresponding control samples were about 10% higher than those of Little Daugh but were still about 
6% lower than the original values of the controls (Rayment, 1976; Crump and Suarez, 1977).   
 
In May 1976, a new batch of control samples was prepared and, after that, Little Daugh's results 
corresponded well with the original mean value as determined by the May replicate analyses (Rayment, 
1976; Crump and Suarez, 1977).  For the new batch of control samples, I.C.I.'s results averaged 
consistently 15% higher than Little Daugh's results; duplicate samples sent to I.C.I. averaged 19% 
higher than the results from Little Daugh.

Based on analysis of their control samples, Gold Fields used correction factors for four ranges of gold 
results.  MDA used the "uncorrected" Gold Fields assays in their database. 
 
11.3.2 Gold Fields' Check of IMEBESA's and Rio Tinto's Assays 
 
In April 1975, shortly after Gold Fields had made an initial field visit to Salave, they conducted a 
program of check assaying of prior drilling results by IMEBESA and Rio Tinto (Crump and Suarez, 
1977; Rayment, 1975a; Harris, 1979).  A total of 520 check samples were selected from existing 
IMEBESA jaw-crushed core and from Rio Tinto half core for holes 22 (IMEBESA), 32 (IMEBESA), 
and 35 (Rio Tinto).  The samples were prepared by Gold Fields at their Little Daugh laboratory and then 
analyzed for gold at three custom laboratories – I.C.I. (analysis by atomic absorption), Union Assay 
(analysis by fire assay), and Robertson Research (analysis by neutron activation).  The purpose of this 
testing was to examine the performance of the three different laboratories and analytical methods and to 
check the accuracy of both IMEBESA's and Rio Tinto's analyses.  The results (Table 11.2) show that 
there were significant differences is gold values reported by the three custom laboratories and that Rio 
Tinto's re-analyses of IMEBESA core were low when compared with I.C.I and Union Assay's results.  
Results from Robertson Research were uniformly low, and Gold Fields rejected this lab as a possibility 
for their routine assays.

In January and February 1976, Gold Fields apparently ran two checks of mineralized sections in 
IMEBESA's holes 20 and 28, comparing assays from Gold Fields' Little Daugh laboratory to original 
assays from IMEBESA.  Results are shown in Table 11.3 and are taken from tables found in a collection 
of Gold Fields memoranda regarding the Salave project provided by Astur.  A much larger comparison 
of Little Daugh and IMEBESA results was reported by Rayment (1976) and is shown in Table 11.4; this 
comparison applied a correction factor to Little Daugh values related to performance of Little Daugh 
results compared to control samples.

11.3.3 Gold Fields Specific-Gravity Measurements 
 
Gold Fields made a total of 174 specific-gravity determinations using a Walker Steelyard Balance 
(Harris, 1979).  In addition, 31 duplicate samples were measured, and the mean difference found 
between the replicate analyses was 0.03.  Harris (1979) summarized the results, which fell into three 
groups: 

 High specific-gravity values for "hongorock" samples ("Hongorock" is a term they used for a 
specific type of alteration that was generally mineralized.  "Hongo" is Spanish for mushroom)  
29 samples measured 
Range of specific gravity:  2.72 – 3.01 
Specific-gravity mean + standard deviation:  2.81 + 0.08 

 Low specific-gravity values for albitite samples 
22 samples measured

11.4 Anglo American Sampling 
 
For Anglo's core drilling with the exception of their 1984 holes, the core was split and half was sent for 
analysis by fire assay to Anglo American Research Laboratory in South Africa (Anglo American 
Corporation of South Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982).  Initial samples submitted 
by Anglo in 1981 were analyzed for Au, Ag, total S, Mo, As, and Sb, but later in 1981, Anglo changed 
their procedure and samples were analyzed for gold and silver, and also for total S, Mo, As, Sb, and CO3 
if the gold value returned was greater than 0.5 g Au/t (Hutchison, 1986).  Samples from Anglo's 1984 
holes, including the FM- series, were split and sent to the Charter Laboratory in England for assay 
(Charter Exploraciones S.A., 1984c). 
 
11.4.1 Anglo American Specific-Gravity Measurements 
 
Anglo measured samples at their Research Laboratory for specific gravity.  As of March 31, 1983, they 
reported that the average of 24 samples tested was 2.69, while the average of 13 samples with gold 
exceeding 0.25g Au/t was 2.72 and the average of two samples with gold exceeding 1.0g Au/t was 2.75 
(Charter Exploraciones S.A., 1983a).  By May 31, 1983, Anglo reported that the program of specific-
gravity measurements had been completed (Charter Exploraciones S.A., 1983a).  Seventy-two 
measurements were made, and the average specific gravity for all samples tested was 2.70.  The 32 
samples with gold exceeding 0.5g Au/t had an average specific gravity of 2.72, and the 17 samples with 
gold exceeding 1.0g Au/t also had an average specific gravity of 2.72.  However, they noted:  "Though 
the >1.0g/t Au material average S.G. has worked out at 2.72 it has been noticeable that well-
mineralized samples have higher S.Gs. and virtually all samples tested in this analysis were from 
outside the area of main mineralization.  It is thus suggested that in tonnage calculations continued use 
is made of the S.G. of 2.74."  
 
Agnerian (2010) summarized density measurements from 75 Anglo samples which seem to show a 
different breakdown by gold grade than that described above.  Table 11.5 shows the summary reported 
by Agnerian (2010).

11.5 Oromet Sampling 
 
Oromet analyzed their core samples for gold, but MDA has no details on the procedures used; however, 
the assays are generally on two-meter intervals, with check assays every five to 10 samples.   
 
11.6 Newmont Sampling 
 
For Newmont's drilling, all core was sawn in half, and one-half of the core was subject to a primary 
crush in Tapia (Knutsen, 1991b).  After drying at 100°C for 24 hours, and depending on Newmont's 
sample preparation capacity relative to drill productivity, crushed material was either roll-crushed to 
95% minus 10-mesh on site or sent directly to the assay lab for sample preparation.  The labs pulverized 
the minus 10-mesh material to at least minus 100-mesh before taking a representative split for fire 
assaying.   
 
Samples were sent for analysis of gold by fire assay to Caleb Brett (now called Intertek Group Plc.) in 
St. Helens, England; X-Ray Assay Labs ("XRAL") in Toronto, Canada; or Rocky Mountain 
Geochemical ("RMGC") in Salt Lake City, Utah (Knutsen, 1991b).  Samples from the first phase of 
drilling were sent to either Caleb Brett or XRAL, and samples from the second phase (holes NSC5A, 
5B, 5C, 24, 28-31) were sent to RMGC.  All samples were analyzed by one-assay-ton fire assay.  In the 
first phase, all samples were analyzed on 1.5-meter intervals.  In the second phase, only obviously well-
mineralized (sulfides) intervals were analyzed, and assay intervals were 1.0 meter. 
 
11.6.1 Newmont QA/QC 
 
 Newmont's QA/QC consisted of use of analytical reference standards and check assaying (Knutsen, 
1991b).  Newmont reference standards were included with each batch of assays at an average insertion 
rate of 4%.  Results of analysis of the standards were reviewed for acceptability upon receipt.  In 
addition, Caleb Brett provided Newmont with the results of their internal standards program. 
 
Check assaying was performed by Newmont Metallurgical Services (Odekirk, 1991a, 1991b, 1991c).  
Analysis was by fire assay on a 1-assay ton sample (Odekirk, 1991c).  All drill-hole intervals assaying 
greater than 1.0 g Au/t and selected intervals assaying less that that value were checked.  Knutsen 
(1991b) reported that 200 assays were conducted on duplicate splits of material from drill holes NSC1, 
NSC2, NSC3, and NSC4 originally assayed by Caleb Brett.  In addition, Caleb Brett re-analyzed 65 
pulps grading more than 1 g Au/t.  
 
Check assays on samples from Newmont holes NSC-1 and NSC-2 suggested that coarse gold was 
causing large variation in assay results, which was confirmed by hand panning (Odekirk, 1991c, 1991d).  
Knutsen (1991b) described sample analysis as follows: 
 
"High statistical variability was observed, particularly at higher grades of gold mineralization and was 
shown to be a function of coarse gold.  As a result, samples were subject to screen fire analysis to 
determine the optimal sample size and sample reduction steps.  For the whole of the campaign, entire 
half-core samples were roll-crushed to minus 10-mesh before further sample volume reduction."

11.6.2 Newmont Specific Gravity 
 
Knutsen (1991b) reported that eight samples of core from granodiorite and syenite were subject to 
apparent density determinations by Seinico CONTROL in Oviedo.  Apparent density of four unaltered 
granodiorite samples averaged 2.68 kg/dm3, and the four syenite samples averaged 2.62 kg/dm3.  
Newmont used a tonnage factor of 0.370 m3/t in calculating reserves, representing a rock density of 2.70 
g/cc.  
 
11.7 Lyndex Sampling 
 
Lyndex sent their core samples to XRAL in Quebec, Canada, for sample preparation and analysis, using 
the following procedures (Catuzo, 1997): 
 

 Coarse grinding to 90% passing -10 mesh 
 Quartering for pulverizing 
 Pulverizing to 90% passing -200mesh 
 Quartering for analysis 
 Analysis for gold by fire assay.  

All samples were analyzed for gold, and some were also analyzed for antimony and molybdenum. 
 
11.7.1 Check Assaying by Lyndex 
 
Catuxo (1997) reported that the only check assaying of the core sampling by Lyndex was some 
performed for the consulting group MPH, who collected 15 Lyndex samples, including higher-grade 
ones, and sent them to a different laboratory for check assaying.  The analysis of sample S-97-6 (201.5-
202.5m), showed that the XRAL result was 134% higher than that provided for MPH, which was 
thought to be due to either a nugget effect or gold amalgamation problems (Catuxo, 1997).  Otherwise, 
the check assays were on average 6% higher than the original XRAL results (Catuxo, 1997). 
 
11.8 Rio Narcea Sampling  
 
The following information is taken from Agnerian (2010) and Valdés Suárez (2012), with additional 
information provided by Astur or as noted. 
 
Rio Narcea sent samples from their drilling program to their laboratory at the El Valle mine for analysis.  
Rio Narcea's geotechnical and hydrological holes were sampled and assayed in the same manner as the 
resource holes, with the exception of Hidro1.  These are summarized in Figure 11.1 and are described as 
follows: 
 

 The initial drill-hole sample was split to produce a five kilogram sub-sample. 
 Samples weighing five to seven kilograms were dried, crushed through a jaw crusher (95% <6 

millimeter), and further reduced (95% passing <4 millimeter) using an LM5 ring mill.  An Essa 
splitter was used to take a 450-gram to 550-gram sub-sample of each split for pulverizing.  The 
remaining reject portion was bagged and stored.

 After reducing the sub-sample to a nominal -200 mesh with an LM2 pulverizer, the samples were 
thoroughly blended and sent to the fire assay department.  A 50-gram portion or two 30-gram (60 
grams) portions were used for fire assays. 

 For geochemical analysis, or when lower detection was required, the gold was dissolved and the 
concentration was determined by the atomic absorption method. 

 
All samples were analyzed for Au and As.  For intervals of significant mineralization (>1 g Au/t), 
samples were also analyzed for Mo, Sb, total C, and total S.  The determinations for C and S were done 
at ITMA, in Oviedo, Asturias.  Acid digestion for As, Sb, and Mo was done on two-gram aliquots of 
samples.  MDA has seen assay certificates from OMAC Laboratories Ltd. ("OMAC") in Galway, 
Ireland dated September and October 2004 and sent to Rio Narcea.  Some of these were multi-element 
aqua regia ICP analyses performed by OMAC on samples from holes RN02 through RN11 and 
additional analyses for %S on samples from holes RN02 through RN16.   
 
Assay results were faxed to the Rio Narcea exploration office at Tapia with original certificates sent by 
regular mail or through the normal pick-up procedure.  Pulps and rejects were also returned through the 
normal pick-up routine.  These were sorted for recheck and/or storage.  Low-grade material that was 
well removed from known zones was discarded (Agnerian, 2010). 
 
11.8.1 Rio Narcea QA/QC 
 
QA/QC measures used by Rio Narcea for the Salave drill holes included an on-going recheck program at 
an independent laboratory, combined with close monitoring of the assay results from standards, blanks, 
and re-assaying of original pulps at the El Valle mine assay laboratory (Agnerian, 2010). 
 
The "mine standard" was prepared by assaying a small sample from an area of known gold 
concentration at the El Valle laboratory in an attempt to establish consistency.  A commercially prepared 
standard was also used – Geostats G397-4, whose value is 3.13 g Au/t with a standard deviation of 0.14 
g Au/t.  For standards, replicate assays were expected to be within ± 2 standard deviations. 
 
A blank sample accompanying the standard was also inserted into each batch of samples by Rio Narcea.  
Blanks were usually quartz or waste rock for which previously analyzed gold content was less than 0.05 
g/t.   
 
There is a conflict in the references MDA reviewed about the two laboratories who conducted check 
assaying.  Valdés Suárez (2012) reported that ITMA Foundation in Asturias and SGS in Ontario, 
Canada conducted the checks, but Agnerian (2010) reported the two labs were Inspectorate Laboratories 
in England and SGS.  MDA cannot resolve this discrepancy.   
 
Check assays were performed regularly on original pulp and occasionally on a second pulp prepared 
from stored rejects.  Routine check assays were performed on every 20th sample.  For the first 1,000 
samples, 20% were check assayed in duplicate using two external laboratories, and the same sample was 
used for the internal laboratory duplicate.  After the first 1,000 samples, pulp checks were done in one 
out of every 20 samples, alternating between the two external laboratories.  The sample numbers for 
pulp duplicates and pulp checks were different after the first 1,000 samples.

Duplicate samples were prepared for 458 core sample intervals by preparing two pulps from different 
quarter-core samples.  Figure 11.2 is a relative difference graph of the two assay pairs, which indicates 
relatively good agreement with the exception of two outlier assay pairs where samples may have been 
from unpaired intervals.  This comparison is shown also shown in Table 11.6.

11.8.2 Rio Narcea Density Measurements 
 
Rio Narcea technicians carried out systematic density determinations on mineralized material as well as 
waste rock from different parts of the deposit.  These density determinations are done using the formula: 
 
Density= Weight in air / (weight in air-weight in water) 
 
Results of various density determinations are as follows: 

 Density determinations carried out on the 2004/05 Salave drill core show that the average of 261 
density measurements on mineralized rock is 2.67 g/cm³, which is similar to the value of 2.65 
g/cm³ reported by Newmont in its 1991 resource estimate of the Salave deposit. 

 The average density for mineralized rock containing >0.5 g Au/t is 2.75 g/cm³. 
 The average density reported in Rio Narcea's 2005 resource estimate is 2.74 g/cm³.  

 
11.9 Astur Sampling  
  
ALS was selected by Astur as their principal laboratory for the analysis of Salave samples. Sample 
preparation is done by a preparation facility in Seville, Spain, and then the pulps for analysis are shipped 
to ALS laboratory facilities in Loughrea, Ireland operating under OMAC Laboratories Ltd.  OMAC with 
registration number 173T is accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Board to undertake testing as 
detailed in the Schedule bearing the Registration Number detailed above, in compliance with the 
International Standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005.  The accreditation is dated 27/6/2006, was renewed on 
13/5/2011, and expires on 13/05/2016 (http://www.inab.ie/directoryofaccreditedbodies/laboratoryaccreditationtesting/173T.pdf).  
 
ALS was requested to do their 31B preparation method on the sample, which pulverizes approximately 
one kilogram of material to 85% < 75 μ.  A 29.167g assay charge (one assay ton) is then weighed out for 
analysis.     A flow chart of the sample preparation procedure is illustrated in Figure 11.3.

The prepared sample is fused with a mixture of lead oxide, sodium carbonate, borax, silica, and other 
reagents as required, inquarted with six milligrams of gold-free silver, and then cupelled to yield a 
precious-metal bead. The bead is digested in 0.5 milliliter dilute nitric acid in the microwave oven.  
Hydrochloric acid of 0.5 milliliter concentration is then added, and the bead is further digested in the 
microwave at a lower power setting.  The digested solution is cooled, diluted to a total volume of 10 
milliliter with de-mineralized water, and analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy against matrix-
matched standards.  Detection limits are 0.01 g Au/t at the lower end and 100 g Au/t at the upper end. 
 
If a gold sample assays over 10 g Au/t, the sample is re-analyzed with a gravimetric finish.  A prepared 
sample is fused with a mixture of lead oxide, sodium carbonate, borax, silica, and other reagents in order 
to produce a lead button. The lead button containing the precious metals is cupelled to remove the lead. 
The remaining gold and silver bead is parted in dilute nitric acid, annealed, and weighed as gold. The 
lower detection limit is 0.05 g Au/t, while the upper limit is 1,000 g Au/t. 
 
A 33-element ICP analysis was undertaken on all samples using a four-acid digestion.  The sample is 
digested in a mixture of nitric, perchloric, and hydrofluoric acids.  Perchloric acid is added to assist 
oxidation of the sample and to reduce the possibility of mechanical loss of sample as the solution is 
evaporated to moist salts.  Elements are determined by inductively coupled plasma – atomic emission 
spectroscopy ("ICP-AES").  Detection limits for the various elements are shown in Table 11.7.

11.9.1 Astur QA/QC 
 
All laboratories routinely insert blanks and analytical standards into each batch as an internal check. 
 
Drill-core sampling carried out by Astur during the program was subject to a QA/QC program 
administered by the company.  This included submission of blank samples, certified reference materials, 
and core duplicates and analysis of pulp reject and check sample splits at a third-party commercial 
laboratory.  Results of both the in-house and laboratory QA/QC were monitored by Astur on an on-
going basis during the course of the project. 
 
11.9.1.1 Astur Certified Reference Material (Standards) 
 
Results for the regular submission of Certified Reference Material ("CRM" or "standards") are used to 
identify problems with specific sample batches and long-term biases associated with the regular assay 
laboratory.  Astur has obtained five gold standards.  The standards were prepared by two outside 
commercial laboratories who are specialities in the field of CRM preparation: CDN Resource 
Laboratories Ltd ("CDN") of Vancouver Canada and Ore Research and Exploration Pty of Australia. 
Details about the standards are listed in Table 11.8. 
 
The standards cover the general range of values anticipated by Astur, and the source material for the 
standards is similar to that of the Salave deposit.

Astur inserted standards into the sample sequence at the rate of approximately 1:20.  Insertion was not 
systematic so that the occurrence of a standard in the sample sequence was not predictable.  The results 
of the analyses of the standards are shown in Figure 11.4 through Figure 11.8 for each of the standards.

The analyses of the standards have been within expected values with the exception of a few analyses for 
standard CDN-GS-5K, which appeared to be slightly biased on the high side. 
 
11.9.1.2 Astur Blanks 
 
The regular submission of blank material is used to assess contamination during sample preparation and 
to identify sample numbering errors.  Astur has been using barren quartzite as blank material.  Prior to 
use, four samples were sent for gold and 33-element ICP analysis.  Table 11.9 shows results for Au, As, 
Sb, and S, the principal elements of interest at Salave, and illustrates that this material is suitable as a 
blank.

11.9.1.3 Astur Drill-Core Duplicates 
 
Drill-core duplicate samples, often called field duplicates, are used to help assess the natural local-scale 
grade variance or nugget effect (in the case of gold) and are also useful for detecting sample numbering 
mix-ups.  At the time of sampling, a quarter core is cut from the remaining half-core sample and 
submitted as a duplicate.  As rocks are rarely completely homogenous, it is normal to expect some 
variation between results.   Table 11.10 illustrates the results for gold analyses of the core duplicates.

11.9.1.4 Astur Pulp Duplicate Program 
 
Pulp duplicates were submitted to the original laboratory and to secondary laboratories to assess the 
analytical accuracy and identify laboratory bias. After initial analysis by ALS, a pulp split of 
approximately every 10th sample was sent to ACME Labs in Vancouver, Canada for a check assay.  A 
total of 87 check assays have been sent to date, representing drill holes SA-1 to SA-4.  The check assay 
was performed for gold using ACME method G601, which is a lead collection fire assay with an atomic 
absorption spectrometry finish.  The lower detection limit is 0.005 g Au/t, and the upper limit is 10 g 
Au/t.  Overlimits are re-assayed using a gravimetric finish. 
 
A duplicate pulp split was taken from the original 1,000-gram pulverized sample (see Figure 11.3 
describing sample preparation) and was analyzed by ALS as a check of their original assay. A total of 87 
duplicate pulp splits from holes SA-1 to SA-4 were submitted to ALS. 
 
A preparation duplicate is a duplicate pulp derived from a second split of the coarse rejects of the 
original sample.  A total of 87 preparation duplicates from holes SA-1 to SA-4  were sent to ALS for 
analysis to examine sample homogeneity.     
 
Table 11.11 shows the results of the various Astur duplicate sample analyses.  The first row summarizes 
the results of the original ALS analysis.  The second row shows the results of the second analysis by 
ALS on a duplicate pulp split from the original 1,000-gram pulverized sample.  The third row shows the 
results of analyses of the preparation duplicates by ALS.  The fourth row summarizes the results of 
check assays by Acme of original ALS pulps.

The duplicate analyses generally fall within an acceptable range of precision for gold analysis given the 
analytical method employed.  Overall, the results of the duplicate analysis are acceptable. 
 
11.9.2 Astur Specific-Gravity Measurements 
 
The following methodology was employed based on method #3 from Lipton (2001): 
 

 The sample is dried and then weighed on a triple-beam balance to determine the dry mass 
("Ms").   

 The sample is then placed in a basket, which is suspended in water.   
 The weight of the basket is then subtracted to get the weight of the sample in water ("Ms in water").   
 The dry specific gravity is calculated as the mass of the sample in air divided by the difference of 

mass of the sample in the air and the mass of the sample in water  

 
Specific-gravity measurements were recorded for the sedimentary and intrusive rocks plus varying 
degrees of mineralization.   Astur made a total of 280 bulk density measurements.   As a check on the in-
house work, 20 samples were sent to a commercial laboratory for density measurements.  The analyses 
were performed at Lacotec Laboratorio Asturiano de Control Técnico, S.A. ("Lacotec"), located in Soto 
de Llanera, Asturias.  Lacotec used method # 4 after Lipton, (2001).  The main difference in the Lacotec 
method from the method used by Astor is the use of a wax coating to prevent water infiltration into pore 
spaces or fractures and to hold together friable samples.  Table 11.12 shows Astur's specific gravity 
results as well as those of Lacotec; comparable results from measurements made by prior operator Rio 
Narcea are also included on Table 11.12.  Rio Narcea used the same Lipton method # 3 used by Astur.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION  
 
Most of the data gathered by previous operators occurred prior to the NI 43-101 reporting guidelines, 
and most of the old drill programs did not include rigorous check assaying or the insertion of blanks and 
standards as part of the programs.  Limited check assaying did occur, but the bulk of the verification of 
the old drill data is from extensive metallurgical testing programs using drill core for the metallurgical 
test samples. 
 
12.1 Metallurgical Testing of Drill Core Samples  
 
12.1.1 Rio Narcea Metallurgical Tests 
 
Considerable metallurgical testing of drill core has been completed on Rio Narcea, Anglo, Newmont, 
and Lyndex core intervals.  These data provide the bulk of the data verification for the deposit.  All of 
the tests reported have drill-hole sample weights so that the drill-hole assays can be compared to 
metallurgical test head assays and calculated heads. 
 
The first metallurgical tests that can be compared to drill-hole assay data are from two large-scale 
metallurgical tests that were completed by Ammtec in 2005, compositing nearly three tonnes of mostly 
Rio Narcea drill core in each of the two composites for upper and lower mineralized horizons.  A pilot 
flotation plant was operated to consume the composites at a rate of about 150 kilograms per day.  Table 
12.1 describes the comparison of the drill-hole assays to the metallurgical test head samples.  Note that 
the pilot plant metallurgical testing indicates higher grades than the drill-hole assays.  This may be due 
to a coarse gold component.  
 

Table 12.1 Comparison of Pilot Plant Metallurgical Test Results to Drill Core Assays 
 

Weight Drill Hole Head Assay Pilot Feed Calculated Head* Daily Stream

Lab Composite kg g Au/t g Au/t g Au/t g Au/t g Au/t

AMMTEC Upper 2,848 4.09 4.31 4.48 5.06 4.28

AMMTEC Lower 2,872 3.97 5.26 5.70 4.82 5.15

*Note: Calculated head is for one day only (150 kg)  
 
Ammtec also completed 65 variability tests on behalf of Rio Narcea.  Drill core was selected, weighed, 
and composited into 65 samples for the tests.  Each composite was based on a seven kilogram sample, 
with the excess weight used to make the upper- and lower-horizon composites for the pilot plant test 
work.  The assay heads and calculated heads of the one-kilogram split sample can be compared to the 
expected value calculated from the drill-hole assays of the intervals used in the composite; this 
comparison is shown in Table 12.2, Table 12.3, and Table 12.4 for the upper, lower, and "underground" 
samples used, respectively.  The "underground" samples were higher in grade, presumably representing 
material that would be mined by underground methods.

Note that the average drill-hole gold assay grade is the same as both the metallurgical test assay head 
and calculated head, confirming the drill-hole gold assays.  The arsenic drill-hole assay is about 18% 
above the calculated head arsenic grade, indicating the drill-hole arsenic grade may be higher than the 
actual grade. 
 
Table 12.4 also summarizes the test results of all 65 variability tests.   
 
12.1.2 Astur Gold Corporation Metallurgical Tests 
 
Astur completed metallurgical tests on a number of composites.  Composite samples were constructed 
from low-grade, average-grade, and high-grade samples from both Upper and Lower zones of 
mineralization.  The nature of the Upper and Lower zones is discussed in Section 13.0.  Master 
composites were constructed for both the Upper and Lower zones.  The size of each test was generally 
around two kilograms.  The comparison between the calculated head grade, assay head grade, and the 
composite grade from drill-hole assays is shown in Table 12.5.  The metallurgical tests show slightly 
higher grades than the estimated head grade by using the drill-hole assays.

12.2 Twin Drill Hole Comparison 
 
A total of seven twin (one is a triple) drill holes can be compared.  The triple twin is drilled on a very 
high-grade, nearly vertical structure and compares about as well as can be expected with vertical drilling 
on a vertical structure.  The mineralized domains were prepared on sections prior to having the last 10 
Astur drill holes.  Only minor changes to the mineralized domains were required after adding the Astur 
drilling.  Table 12.6 is a comparison of the twin drill holes.

12.4 Database Audit 
 
A report of a 2013 survey by Topcad Ingenierias S.L. documents Astur's drill-hole survey and the 
transformation of the Salave drill data from local coordinates into the current project coordinate system 
(UTM Zone 29 coordinates using the ETRS89 datum).  This report was used to check the locations of 51 
(15%) of the core holes in the project database.  No coordinates for the Oromet, Goldfields, or the FM-
series of holes drilled by Anglo are provided in the document.  One discrepancy was found in the collar 
elevation of hole RN07, but the elevation provided by the document is clearly inaccurate, as it would 
place the collar about 25 meters above the surface.  The elevation in the project database for this hole is 
identical to that of hole AA6/4, which lies 0.2 meters away.

While MDA was unable to audit the down-hole survey data, the database is dominated by vertical holes. 
 
Auditing of the historic drill-hole assays utilized original paper laboratory certificates or copies thereof 
(Newmont, Rio Tinto, and Anglo holes) and various handwritten records, primarily drill logs.  No 
backup data for assays from holes drilled by Oromet or Rio Narcea were available.  In the case of 
Lyndex assays, handwritten notes that carefully document the drill hole, sample number, from-to 
interval, and gold assay in oz Au/ton were used in the auditing.  It was found that the conversion of the 
original oz Au/ton values into g Au/t (metric tonne) was actually a conversion into g Au/ton (short ton), 
so MDA reconverted all of the values and replaced them in the project database.   
 
Assays from 19% of a total of 2,816 drill-hole intervals from the IMEBESA, Anglo, Rio Tinto, and 
Newmont holes were audited.  Other than inconsistencies with respect to the handling of less-than-
detection analyses, 32 discrepancies between the audit materials and the gold assay values in the 
database were found.  Of these errors, the most significant consist of an entry error, whereby a 0.5 g 
Au/t value was entered as 0.05 g Au/t, and an unassayed interval that had a value of "0" in the database; 
all other of the errors were immaterial. 
 
Astur provided MDA with assay certificates for their 10 resource core holes drilled in 2013, which were 
imported into the project database.  
 
12.5 Summary Statement on Data Verification 
 
Although most of the drill-hole information was obtained prior to NI 43-101 regulations, the 
metallurgical tests that utilized much of the mineralized core serve to confirm the drill-hole assay data.  
The drill-hole data from the IMEBESA core drilling and 24 Lyndex RC holes drilled in 1997 were not 
used to prepare a grade model for the deposit.  MDA believes that the remaining drilling assay results, 
only two of which are from RC holes, can be used to prepare a grade model for the deposit.  All of the 
metallurgical tests that can be compared to the core-hole assays show equal or greater grades than the 
drill-hole assays.  Recent metallic screen check assaying by Astur also indicates slightly higher grades 
than the original drill-hole assays.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING  
 
This Section 13.0 on Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing has been prepared by Allen 
Anderson, P. E. and President of Allen R. Anderson Metallurgical Engineer Inc., and by Craig A. Smith 
with Metal Edge Solutions.  Mr. Anderson takes responsibility for 13.0. 
 
The following information has been taken from Wilkinson (1986), Bulled (1973), Crump and Suarez 
(1977), Agnerian (2010), Tenorio et al. (2013), Ausenco Ltd. (2006b), and other references as cited.   
 
Early metallurgical test work on the Salave deposit was initiated by IMEBESA in 1971, and since then 
numerous other metallurgical investigations have been carried out by various operators, including Rio 
Tinto, Gold Fields, Newmont, Anglo, Oromet, Rio Narcea, and Astur.   
 
Crump and Suarez (1977) summarized results of cyanidation testing by IMEBESA, Rio Tinto, and Gold 
Fields as follows: 
 

"Gold extraction by straight cyanidation of finely ground ore has been extremely poor in tests 
performed to date.  W.S.L. [Warren Spring Laboratories] achieved a maximum recovery of 
56% on a head grade of 1.12 gm Au (80%-200/48 hours leaching time).  Rio Finex [Rio Tinto 
Finance and Exploration Limited] and Lakefield Research Laboratories achieved much lower 
recoveries (10-13%) on higher grade samples.  Cyanidation of a flotation concentrate gave 
even poorer extraction (5-8%). 
 
The conclusion is that Salave ore is highly refractory…" 

 
Wilkinson (1986) summarized the results of metallurgical testing from 1971 through April 1986.  
Cyanidation after pressure leaching and bacterial oxidation yielded gold extractions over 95%, but 
questions remained about the capital investment required.  Subsequently Newmont determined that the 
high dolomite content coincident with the gold mineralization made bio-oxidation of low-grade material 
impractical (Knutsen, 1991b). 
 
From 2004 to 2006, Rio Narcea commissioned metallurgical test work at AMMTEC to evaluate 
flotation and oxidation of the flotation concentrate by pressure leaching, the Activox process, and 
biological methods.  Results of the studies indicated that gold, sulfur, and arsenic recoveries to a rougher 
concentrate were high.  The oxidation studies concluded that pressure oxidation was the most 
appropriate technology considering gold recovery, reagent consumption, and the residue stability.   
 
In 2013, Astur submitted samples of core splits of previous owners' drilling inventory to ALS 
Metallurgy Kamloops for metallurgical testing.  The test program was designed to provide information 
for comminution circuit design and to confirm the AMMTEC flotation results.  The flotation recovery 
process included cleaning stages, and locked cycle test results indicated that gold recovery ranged from 
85 to 91 percent to a cleaner concentrate that graded 86 to 156 g Au/t.  Test products were submitted to 
others to evaluate the concentrate marketability and tailing characteristics.

13.1 IMEBESA 1971 
 
Lakefield Research ("Lakefield") of Canada identified pyrite and arsenopyrite as the principal minerals 
in samples submitted by IMEBESA, with pyrite predominating (Anglo American Corporation of South 
Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982).  IMEBESA contracted with Lakefield for a 
short program of metallurgical test work on one composite high-grade sample, comprised of a composite 
of 12 samples, assaying 8.4 g Au/t (Thomas, 1982; Wilkinson, 1986).   
 
Flotation tests with grinding to about 85% -75µm showed that 95.9% of the gold could be recovered in a 
bulk sulfide concentrate.  Some selective flotation of pyrite and arsenopyrite was possible, but attempts 
to separate stibnite from other sulfides during cleaning were not successful (Anglo American 
Corporation of South Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982; Wilkinson, 1986).   
 
Direct cyanidation of the concentrates yielded 13.5% gold dissolution with the head sample pulverized 
to -65 mesh and leached for 48 hours (Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited and 
Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982; Wilkinson, 1986).  Of three flotation-roasting-cyanidation tests, the 
best result was with the flotation concentrate roasted with 5% carbon at 650°C and calcine leached with 
10 kg NaCN/t for 24 hours, which produced 79% gold extraction (Wilkinson, 1986).  No attempt was 
made to suppress the effect of Sb or As during the direct cyanidation tests. 
  
13.2 Rio Tinto 1972-1973 
 
Rio Tinto's Chessington laboratory conducted mineral processing test work on Salave samples in 1972 
and 1973 (Bulled, 1973; Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited and Charter 
Consolidated P.L.C., 1982; Wilkinson, 1986).  Rio Tinto undertook grinding, froth flotation, roasting, 
and leaching on six samples from Salave and a seventh composite sample comprised of two kilograms 
of each of the original six samples.  All of the samples contained native gold and sulfide minerals, 
chiefly pyrite and arsenopyrite, in a silicate matrix.  Rio Tinto also sent a sample of mineralized 
weathered rock to the Robertson Research Laboratories to determine the habit and particle size of the 
gold (Thomas, 1982).   
 
Grinding test work indicated that grindability was very variable and that the ball-mill grindability work 
index of the composite sample was 13.2 kWh/t.  Open-circuit flotation tests included a simple rougher-
cleaner flowsheet; a grind of 80% passing -300 mesh was determined to be suitable for flotation.  
Satisfactory roasting of the concentrate was achieved over two hours at a temperature of 600°C.  
Leaching was conducted for 48 hours in 0.1% NaCN solution with a starting pH of 10, adjusted by lime 
addition.  Table 13.1 shows the results of this test work.  Rio Tinto noticed that because of the 
difficulties involved in working with low-grade gold samples, a greater quantity of duplication of tests 
was necessary than is normal in mineral processing test work and recommended such duplication in 
future testing programs (Bulled,1973).  Wilkinson (1986) noted that reservations were expressed about 
the accuracy of the results because of sampling errors, the nature of the ore, and discrepancies between 
assay and calculated head values.

13.4 Anglo American 1981-1983 
 
In 1981, Anglo American Research Laboratory ("Anglo") conducted test work on high- and low-grade 
composites with head grades of 4.52 and 1.24 g Au/t, respectively (Anglo American Corporation of 
South Africa Limited and Charter Consolidated P.L.C., 1982; Wilkinson, 1986).  The flotation test work 
showed that at a grind of 85% passing 74 microns, 95% of the sulfide sulfur and gold and 75% to 85% 
of the silver were recovered to the rougher concentrate.  Gravity concentration prior to flotation failed to 
improve gold extractions significantly.  Roasting, followed by leaching of the high- and low-grade 
calcines (100 g Au/t and 46 g Au/t, respectively) gave gold recoveries from the calcines of 77% and 
70%, respectively.  These disappointing results led Anglo to consider alternative methods of treating the 
mineralization at Salave. 
 
In 1983, Anglo carried out metallurgical test-work to determine gold recovery using conventional 
cyanidation methods (Agnerian, 2010; Tenorio et al., 2013).  The testing was performed on samples 
with size fractions varying from 1.6 millimeters to 12 millimeters material of crushed ore, whose 
provenance is not known.  Based on these test results, Anglo concluded that only some 20% of the gold 
in Salave mineralized material could be recovered by conventional cyanidation using percolation leach 
methods.  Mineralogical studies by Anglo also indicated that some 70% of the gold occurs "locked in 
sulphides, probably as sub-micron particles, and unlikely to be recovered by conventional methods" 
(Agnerian, 2010, citing McArthur, 1983).   
 
Anglo's tests also showed that for "a typical mineable grade sample assaying approximately 4 g/t Au 
and 2% S," more than 96% of the contained gold was recovered in a flotation concentrate containing 52 
g Au/t, 27% S, and 6% As, with a concentration ratio of 15:1.  Laboratory autoclave pressure leaching of 
such a concentrate, under conditions of 700 kPa oxygen partial pressure and at 180°C, achieved over 
95% gold liberation,  and  subsequent  cyanidation  produced  gold  recoveries  from  97%  to  98%. 
 
Anglo also examined bacterial oxidation, which was shown to be feasible with over 95% gold extraction 
after 5% sulfide oxidation (Wilkinson, 1986). 
 
Based on these test results, Anglo recommended a flow sheet comprising three-stage crushing, 
conventional grinding to 80% passing 75 microns, bulk flotation, and then pressure leaching of the 
flotation concentrate followed by cyanidation/CIP gold recovery. 
 
13.5 Oromet 1988 
 
In 1988, Oromet carried out a number of metallurgical tests using BioMet technology.  Oromet also dug 
a test pit within the old Roman open pit and constructed a pilot plant to treat the Salave mineralized 
material.  Results are discussed below. 
 
13.5.1 Bio-oxidation Tests 
 
Bio-oxidation column test results on split core samples and two bulk ore samples showed that acid 
consumption was directly related to crush size, with the coarser material consuming a lesser amount of 
sulfuric acid (Agnerian, 2010, citing Larrain, 1988).  These test results also showed sulfuric acid 
consumption and pH as a function of leach time.  In particular:

 Acid consumption dropped from an initial 120 kg/t to approximately 40 kg/t during the first 10 
days of leaching and remained virtually constant during the remaining 150 days (total 160 days 
of leaching). 

 pH increased rapidly from near zero to approximately 2 during this initial 10-day period,  and  
thereafter  increased  gradually  to  approximately  5  during  the remaining leach period. 

 Other tests indicated that pH stayed well below 2 during the course of leaching. 
 
13.5.2 Bioleaching Tests 
 
Bioleaching tests included an initial bio-oxidation and subsequent cyanidation of crushed material.  
Results of seven tests carried out over periods ranging from 64 days to 181 days showed that: 

 Extraction of the arsenic averaged approximately 59% within a range from 37.1% to 70.5%. 
 Consumption of sulfuric acid averaged approximately 145 kg/t within a range from 96 kg/t of 

material to 180 kg/t. 
 Gold extraction averaged approximately 63.5% (for three test results available), and ranged from 

54.5% to 69.4%. 
 Lime consumption averaged approximately 15.4 kg/t (for three test results available), and ranged 

from 12.5 kg/t to 18.5 kg/t. 
 Cyanide consumption averaged approximately 1.575 kg/t (for three test results available), and 

ranged from 0.525 kg/t to 2.52 kg/t (Agnerian, 2010, citing Larrain, 1989). 
 
13.5.3 Bottle-Roll Cyanidation Tests 
 
Bottle roll cyanidation tests were carried out on 13 column materials over periods ranging from 74 days 
to 154 days, and averaging approximately 118 days.  These results showed that: 

 Gold extraction averaged approximately 70%, and ranged from 35.2% to 83.2%. 
 Lime consumption averaged approximately 24 kg/t and ranged from 7 kg/t to 79.8 kg/t. 
 Cyanide consumption averaged approximately 1.26 kg/t and ranged from <0.2 kg/t to 5.36 kg/t ( 

Agnerian, 2010, citing Larrain, 1989). 
 
13.6 Newmont 1990 - 1991 
 
Semi-quantitative x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence analyses were performed on samples from 12 
drill holes.  Results showed positive correlation of gold with plagioclase, dolomite, sodium, CaO, MgO, 
arsenic, sulfur, and stibnite and a negative correlation between gold and quartz and potassium feldspar.  
Newmont also calculated a net carbonate value ("NCV") for 97 six-meter drill-composite samples from 
holes NSC1, NSC2, and NSC3.  The NCV is not clearly defined in the work except to note that it is a 
mathematical assessment of the acid-forming potential relative to the neutralizing potential for the 
samples.  Newmont's conclusion was that acid discharge would probably not result from the oxidation 
of sulfides in a pile of waste rock from Salave, because the majority of the determinations exhibited 
either neutral or positive NCV (Knutsen, 1991b; Hofmann, 1991).  This work also suggested that 
because of the high dolomite content coincident with the mineralization, heap-leach bio-oxidation was 
not a practical option for Salave due to high sulfuric acid requirements (Knutsen, 1991b).

13.7 Rio Narcea 2004 - 2006 
 
In 2004, Rio Narcea commissioned Ausenco Ltd. ("Ausenco") of Australia to carry out a scoping study 
on the Salave deposit to assess the suitability of alternative concentrate oxidation technologies and their 
application to the Salave gold concentrate with arsenopyrite.  These alternatives included: 

 Roasting 
 Activox® 
 Redox 
 High temperature pressure oxidation 
 Conventional bio-oxidation (tank leach) 
 Bacterial assisted heap leach (GeoBiotics) 

Based on the results of this scoping study, Rio Narcea concluded that, with the possible exception of 
replacing the three-stage crushing with a single-stage crush and SAG mill/ball mill grinding circuit, the 
flow sheet proposed by Anglo in 1983 remains valid.  No mention in the reports documents SAG 
grinding test work results to support that judgment.    
 
In 2004, values of 95%  for  gold  recovery  to  a  flotation  concentrate  and  95%  for  gold  recovery  
by subsequent  oxidation  and  cyanidation  were  being  used  by Rio Narcea (Agnerian, 2010, citing 
personal communication from A. Riles, 2004). 
 
In 2004, Rio Narcea noted that given the relatively low sulfur content of the deposit and therefore high 
concentration ratio, and also the existence of cyanidation and gold recovery facilities at its El Valle plant 
in Asturias, the plan was to produce only a flotation concentrate at Salave itself and to transport the 
concentrate to El Valle.  This concept offered capital savings as well as environmental advantages in 
that the El Valle plant already had suitable facilities for cyanide management and disposal of tailings 
from cyanidation (Agnerian, 2010, citing personal communication from A. Riles, 2004). 
 
13.7.1 AMMTEC Testing 2005 
 
In 2005, AMMTEC completed comminution and flotation testing on samples from Salave for Rio 
Narcea (AMMTEC Ltd., 2005a, 2005b, and 2005c).  Mineralogical (Townend, 2004), Bond grind 
characterization, cyanidation, and flotation tests were completed on two composites from Salave.  
Composite 1 was from the "Upper Zone," and the Composite 2 was from the "Lower Zone" of the 
deposit.  Upper Zone mineralization was described as predominantly pyrite mineralization, while Lower 
Zone mineralization was described as higher in arsenopyrite; the pyritic mineralization was generally 
lower grade than that associated with arsenopyrite.  The head assays for the composites are shown in 
Table 13.3.

Review of Table 13.3 indicates that both composites contained interesting concentrations of gold but 
also contain relatively high concentrations of arsenic and antimony.   
 
Mineralogical examination indicated that the sulfide portion of the Upper Zone contained primarily 
pyrite, with major arsenopyrite and minor stibnite.  Two gold occurrences were detected optically, a 
single nine-micron particle in pyrite and a second coarse pyrite particle with four fine (two micron) gold 
particles.  For the Lower Zone, the sulfide portions of the dominant component was arsenopyrite with 
major pyrite, minor quantities of stibnite, and traces of molybdenite, galena, chalcopyrite and sphalerite.  
One occurrence of gold was detected optically, a single 30-micron x five-micron strip in pyrite. 
   
Bond ball mill work index results indicated that Composite 1 and Composite 2 material had a work 
index of 17.2 and 16.3 kWh per tonne, respectively.  
  
Whole-rock cyanidation tests at grind P80s of 75 and 10 microns were conducted.  Results, summarized 
in Table 13.4, indicate that the material is relatively refractory but that fine grinding did improve the 
response in these scoping-level tests.

Tests were run to evaluate flotation conditions, including pH, grind, and copper sulfate addition.  
Conditions recommended for follow-up testing were: 100 g/t of copper sulfate to rougher feed, 25 g/t 
sodium isobutl xanthate ("SIBX") to flotation, and 25 g/t Aero 3477 ("3477") to flotation with MIBC as 
needed for a frother.  The effect of grind size was also evaluated.  Based on the test results and operating 
cost estimates at a gold price of $400, the target grind size P80 of 106 microns was selected (Davis, 
undated).  
  
Tests at selected flotation conditions, summarized in Table 13.5, indicated that excellent gold recovery 
could be realized into a concentrate containing less than 10 percent of the weight.  The resulting 
concentrate contained five to twenty percent arsenic and 0.6 to 1 percent antimony.

13.7.2 Ausenco Program 2006 
 
In 2006, Ausenco reported results from flotation, variability, and pressure oxidation ("POX") testing on 
samples from Salave for EMC (Ausenco, 2006b, 2006a).  Some of the results presented in the Ausenco 
report were included in the 2005 AMMTEC report and are not repeated here.  Bench-scale and pilot 
testing was completed to evaluate flotation and concentrate oxidation processes.  Products from the pilot 
plant were also submitted to specialists to evaluate thickening, filtration, and concentrate-handling 
characteristics.  Composites of material designated Upper Zone, Lower Zone, and Underground were 
prepared.  
 
The flotation testing was conducted at AMMTEC (AMMTEC Ltd., 2005b, 2005c).  AMMTEC sent 
samples from the pilot flotation program to Larox Pty Ltd for concentrate filtration tests (Larox Pty Ltd, 
2005), Outokumpu Technology Pty Ltd for thickening tests (Outokumpu Technology Pty Ltd, 2005), 
tailing samples to Vizon Scitec Inc. for tailing characterization, and filtered concentrate to Australian 
Testing Sampling & Inspection Service Pty Ltd for transport moisture limit determination (Australian 
Testing Sampling & Inspection Service Pty Ltd, 2005).  POX testing on the concentrates produced was 
conducted at SGS Lakefield Oretest.   
 
Conclusions from the Ausenco report (Ausenco Ltd., 2006b) are summarized below: 
 

 The Salave mineralization is considered to be refractory.  Gold is locked in the mineral matrix 
but can be liberated by oxidation of the sulfide minerals.   

 At a primary grind of 106 microns, the samples showed consistently high gold recovery (over 
95%) by flotation at a neutral pH to a rougher concentrate containing six to seven percent of the 
sample feed weight.    

 Testing of samples that had been tested earlier and aged for 20 years yielded a gold recovery loss 
of 3.3 percent, indicating that rapid aging of the samples was not a significant issue.  However, 
Ausenco noted that it remains prudent not to stockpile material for prolonged periods to ensure 
maximum gold recovery.   

 Information generated from the flotation test program was considered sufficient to generate 
design criteria for this specific operation.  Additional comminution and POX testing was 
recommended.   

 Testing to evaluate the stability of arsenic and antimony in the precipitates from neutralization of 
the oxidation step products was also recommended.   

 POX treatment of the concentrates yielded gold recovery from the concentrates of over 98%.

The metallurgical test samples submitted for the 2006 test program were substantial.  Approximately 
1,700 meters of quarter-core weighing 6.5 tonnes were submitted for testing.  For the pilot test program, 
all quarter-core rejects from continuous zones that were greater than three meters in length and greater 
than 2 g Au/t gold were submitted.  The composites were prepared based on sample depth.  The Upper 
Zone (from 0 to 75 meters below surface) was noted to be pyrite rich, and the Lower Zone (from 75 
meters below the surface to the bottom of the planned open pit) and the underground composite were 
noted to be arsenopyrite rich (Green, 2005).  The underground composite represented the lower section 
of the arsenopyrite-rich zone below the proposed pit shell that was proposed to be accessed by 
underground mining methods.  There was said to be no significant difference between the arsenopyrite-
rich zones proposed for mining by both methods (Green, 2005).  The mineralogist concluded that the 
low occurrence of visible gold, considering the head grade, indicates that the gold was likely present in 
the crystalline structure of the pyrite / arsenopyrite matrix.  
  
Large batch and pilot-scale flotation tests were conducted to generate material for oxidation tests and 
other tests required for equipment sizing.  The target feed rate to the pilot plant was 150 kg/hr with a 
target grind size P80 of 106 microns.  Results from the pilot program are summarized in Table 13.6.  
Ausenco concluded that the pilot results confirm the bench-scale results.

Ausenco noted a correlation between the gold and arsenic recovery in the pilot plant.  Assays of screen 
fractions indicated the recovery of gold, sulfur, and arsenic was relatively high and consistent on the 
minus 75 micron material, but somewhat lower on the coarse fractions for both the Upper and Lower 
composites. 
    
The viscosity of pilot plant concentrate and tailing samples was measured.  The viscosity of the tailing 
streams is dependent on the percent solids, with typical values noted between 50 and 60 percent solids. 
   
Settling rates for concentrate and tailing samples were measured to allow thickener sizing (Outokumpu 
Technology Pty Ltd, 2005).  Results indicate that for the flotation tailing: underflow percent solids of 50 
to 55 percent solids were achieved at loading rates of 0.72 (t/m2 hr) with 30 g/t flocculant addition.  For 
the flotation concentrate, underflow percent solids of approximately 70% were obtained as 0.26 (t/m2 
hr) loading rates with 10 to 20 g/t flocculant addition. 
    
Concentrate filtration tests conducted by Larox on a PF-1 test filter indicate a filter cake with 9.9% 
moisture was produced at a unit rate of 90 to 95.5 (kg dry solids / m2 hr) (Larox Pty Ltd, 2005).  A cycle 
time of 24 to 26.5 minutes was estimated.

A sample of flotation concentrate was evaluated at Australian Testing Sampling & Inspection Services 
Pty Ltd (2005).  Results indicated the transportable moisture limit for the Upper and Lower concentrate 
to be 10.3 and 10.4 %, respectively.  
  
The variability samples were selected from the available samples to provide a vertical and geographic 
representation of the deposit.  A total of 65 rougher flotation variability tests were run on samples from 
the three zones: Upper, Lower, and Underground.  Average test results for the three zones are shown in 
Table 13.7.  Ausenco's analysis of the variability results are summarized below: 
 

 Gold recovery is not significantly affected by gold head grade. 
 Gold, sulfur, and arsenic recovery is consistently high across each ore zone. 
 The average rougher gold recovery from the Upper, Lower, and Underground variability tests 

was 96.3, 97.2, and 97.8 percent, respectively. 
 

Table 13.7 Variability Test Summary 
 

 
 
Upper and Lower Zone composite concentrate samples were submitted for POX testing.  Variables 
evaluated included the effects of POX temperature between 200 and 220 degrees C and feed percent 
solids between 10 and 15 percent solids on cyanidation results.  Gold recovery from the POX residue 
was excellent at over 98%.  POX conditions were found to have an effect on the POX oxidation kinetics, 
the residue gold-leach kinetics, and cyanide and lime consumption.  Lime consumption for the washed 
residue ranged from 48 to 227 g/t, and cyanide consumption ranged from 5.5 to 11 kg/t depending on 
conditions.  Additional testing was recommended to optimize autoclave conditions.

13.8.1 ALS Metallurgy Testing 2013 
 
In 2013, ALS Metallurgy Kamloops ("ALS-Met"), on behalf of Metal Edge Solutions (Craig Smith) 
who is acting for Astur on the Salave project, completed comminution testing, flotation flow sheet 
development testing, limited grind and flotation optimization testing, aging testing, and locked cycle 
testing on samples from the Salave deposit (Pojhan and Johnston, 2014).  Primary focus of the work at 
ALS-Met was to confirm the base information reported in the 2006 Ausenco final metallurgical report 
(Ausenco Ltd., 2006b).  ALS-Met also sent samples of flotation tailings to other laboratories for solid-
liquid separation tests, geotechnical characterization in support of planned dry stack tailings placements 
(Intermountain GeoEnvironmental Services, Inc., 2013), environmental tests, and mine-paste back-fill 
tests (Pavlovic and Palkovits, 2013). 
   
Bond abrasion and SAG Mill Comminution ("SMC") testing was completed on six composite samples 
that were available in May 2013 (Contract Support Services, 2013).  The samples tested represented

98.9 meters of quarter-core from both the Upper and Lower zones.  Results, summarized in Table 13.8, 
indicate the Bond abrasion index averaged 0.076 grams, indicating the material is mildly abrasive.  The 
SMC derived A x b values ranged from 33 to 47, indicating the material is medium to hard with respect 
to breakage in a SAG mill. 
 

Table 13.8 SMC and Bond Abrasion Index Test Results 
 

 
 
A second set of six similar samples from core that was available later was submitted for Bond ball-mill 
work-index testing.  Results, shown in Table 13.9, indicate that the Lower Zone has a slightly higher 
work index than the Upper Zone.  The Lower Zone is considered to be of average hardness, and the 
Upper Zone is considered softer than average.  Previous reported work was weak on comminution test 
work, a focus of Astur through ALS-Met in support of design criteria development. 
 

Table 13.9 Bond Ball Mill Work Index Test Results 
 

 
 
Head assays from the various ALS-Met composite samples are shown in Table 13.10.  Significant gold 
concentrations are present in all composites.  The sulfur is primarily present as sulfide sulfur.  Arsenic in 
the feed is relatively higher in the Lower Zone and in the high-grade samples.

ALS-Met completed limited optimization testing to confirm earlier work reported on grind size, gravity 
recovery, and flotation conditions.  The following summarize results obtained: 
 

 Overall, metallurgical response to flotation was excellent.  From the six composites tested 
initially, batch flotation test gold recovery ranged from 85 to 95 percent into a cleaner 
concentrate that graded from 68 to 299 g Au/t.  Limited testing indicated that primary grinding 
finer than 106 µm did not significantly improve flotation response. 

 Evaluation of two flotation schemes indicated that a simple flow sheet using potassium amyl 
xanthate ("PAX") as a collector, instead of copper sulfate as an activator and SIBX/3477 as 
collectors, was recommended.   

 A series of tests at primary grind P80 sizes ranging from 73 to 167 microns indicated that 
primary grind size does not have a significant effect on gold recovery. 

 The natural pH of the pulp ranged from 8.5 to 9.0.  Tests at higher pH showed that gold recovery 
did decrease as the pH approached 10.5.  Flotation at natural pH was recommended.   

 Limited testing to evaluate regrind size showed that some regrinding improved metallurgical 
performance.  A target regrind P80 size of 39 microns was noted. 

 Tests to evaluate sample aging were conducted on two similarly positioned Upper and Lower 
Zone drill-hole composites collected from core drilled in the 1981-1983 period, and later drilling 
in the 2004-2005 period.  No conclusive variation in flotation response could be confirmed given 
the head-grade variability; however, the older core generally demonstrated a lower recovery 
response than the freshest core available at the time, between 1.4% and 0.8%. 

 Overall gold recovery from tests that included gravity and flotation was not higher than that from 
tests with flotation only.  Gravity concentrates produced contained from 24 to 30 percent of the

gold and were relatively high grade so some economic benefit to separate marketing of the 
higher-grade concentrate could be realized.   

 Locked cycle test gold recovery on the Lower and Upper Zone composites as well as the Master 
Composite 2 resulted in gold recoveries of 85 to 91 percent to a cleaner concentrate that graded 
86 to 156 g Au/t.  Master Composite 2 was assembled from pre-2005 drill samples representing 
six composites of Upper and Lower Zone samples.  

 The concentrates from the locked cycle tests were assayed for deleterious elements.  Arsenic 
content ranged from 9.5 to 21.8 percent.  Antimony ranged from 1.5 to 2.8 percent.  Both arsenic 
and antimony were above the concentration normally considered marketable.  Fluorine content 
of the concentrate produced from the Lower Zone Master Composite was also high at 170 g/t.  It 
is recommended that advice from concentrate marketing experts be sought during feasibility 
studies. 

 Mineralogical analysis of a gravity concentrate from one of the composites indicated that gold 
recovered to the gravity concentrate was either liberated or in multi-phase particles containing 
over 50 percent gold by mass that could be recovered by gravity or flotation. 

 
13.8.2 Pocock Industrial, Inc. Solid-Liquid Separation Test 2013 
 
Pocock Industrial Inc. ("Pocock") conducted tests to support sizing of solid-liquid separation equipment 
on test products from the ALS-Met test program (Pocock Industrial, Inc., 2013).  Tests on products from 
both Upper and Lower zones were conducted.  Settling rates for concentrate and tailing samples were 
measured to allow thickener sizing.  Results from dynamic tests to simulate high-rate thickening on the 
flotation tailing indicate that  underflow percent solids of 61 to 67 percent solids were achieved at 
loading rates of 3.5 to 5.0 (m3/m2 hr) with 25 to 40 g/t flocculant addition.   
 
For the flotation concentrate, underflow percent solids of approximately 64 to 68% were obtained as 
0.125 to 0.15 (m2/t per day) loading rates with 10 to 20 g/t flocculant addition in conventional 
thickening tests.     
 
Tailing filtration tests conducted by Pocock indicate a filter cake with 11.5 to 18.4% moisture was 
produced.  Sizing basis was 0.828 to 0.855 (m3/t).  An air blow time of 5.5 to 6.0 minutes and a total 
cycle time of 14 to 15 minutes were estimated.  Pocock filter sizing data are summarized in Table 13.11, 
with the notation that "cake moistures may be from 2% to 4% lower than shown in the table…if a 
membrane press is used with hydraulic squeeze capability".   
 
Concentrate filtration tests conducted by Pocock indicate a filter cake with 9.9% moisture was produced.  
Sizing basis was 0.577 (m3/t).  An air blow time of 6.0 minutes and a total cycle time of 15 minutes were 
estimated.  Pocock concentrate filter sizing data are also summarized in Table 13.11.

13.9 Summary 
   
The objective of the 2013 test program was to verify the test work completed by AMMTEC and others 
from 2005 to 2006.  As summarized below, the results from tests at both labs are very similar.   
 
The samples submitted to ALS-Met for the 2013 test program were selected by Astur geologists to be as 
representative as possible, given core availability and the focus on an underground mineable resource.  
For the AMMTEC samples, all continuous core intervals inside the planned mine zone with a grade over 
2.0 g Au/t were selected.  The 2006 AMMTEC metallurgical samples are considered representative.   
 
Summary statistics for the metallurgical composite samples tested from the AMMTEC and ALS-Met 
programs are shown in Table 13.12.  Review of Table 13.12 indicates that the 2006 AMMTEC pilot and 
variability test programs were conducted on approximately 1,700 meters of core and the 2013 ALS-Met 
composites totaled approximately 200 meters in interval length.  The 2006 samples are considered the 
most representative of the deposit, and the 2013 ALS-Met samples provide a sample base to confirm the 
earlier test program results.  It is noted that the samples tested and reported by ALS-Met in 2013 were 
drilled prior to 2006 and stored at site.

The composite sample test head assays, summarized in Table 13.10 were compared to data from the 
geologic database summarized in Table 13.13.  The drill-hole data have been filtered so that only data 
observations that include sulfur analysis and are above 2.0 g Au/t are shown.  Comparison of the 
composite head values and the range and average values noted in Table 13.13 indicates that the 2013 
ALS-Met composite gold, arsenic, and sulfur grades are typical of the grades to be expected.

Comparison of rougher flotation test results from 2013 ALS-Met and 2005 and 2006 AMMTEC results 
is shown in Table 13.15.  Review of Table 13.15 indicates similar gold recovery to the rougher 
concentrate, but at higher mass pulls for the ALS-Met tests.  Previous grade-recovery curves from 
AMMTEC Upper Zone tests are shown in Figure 13.2, and ALS-Met grade-recovery curves for cleaning 
tests are shown in Figure 13.3.  Comparison of the two figures shows that they have a similar shape in 
the region of interest.  Gold recovery will be a function of the concentrate grade produced and will 
decrease as gold concentrate grade is increased.  The concentrate grade produced will also be dependent 
on the head grade.  The actual gold recovery estimate to use for the study will depend on the target 
concentrate grade, which will depend on the concentrate marketing terms and conditions.

The locked cycle tests conducted in 2013 at ALS-Met provide the best available gold recovery estimates

Zone composites ranged from 85 to 91 percent to a cleaner concentrate that graded 86 to 156 g Au/t. 
Concentrates from the locked cycle tests were assayed for deleterious elements.  Arsenic content ranged 
from 9.5 to 21.8 percent.  Antimony ranged from 1.5 to 2.8 percent.  Both arsenic and antimony are well 
above the concentration considered marketable to traditional concentrate buyers.  Astur is exploring 
other alternatives, including joint ventures with or marketing to mine operators who produce and process 
similar concentrates.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
14.1 Introduction 
 
The resource estimation for the Salave project follows the guidelines of Canadian National Instrument 
43-101 ("NI 43-101").  The modeling and estimation of the resources, which were undertaken from 
October to December 2013, were done under the supervision of Neil Prenn, a qualified person with 
respect to mineral resource estimations under NI 43-101.  Mr. Prenn is independent of Astur by the 
definitions and criteria set forth in NI 43-101; there is no affiliation between Mr. Prenn and Astur except 
that of an independent consultant/client relationship.   
 
Although MDA is not an expert with respect to any of the following aspects, MDA is not aware of any 
unusual environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, or political factors 
that may materially affect the Salave mineral resources as of the date of this report other than those 
discussed in Section 4.5   
 
The mineral resources presented in this report for the Salave project conform to the definitions adopted 
by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM") in December 2000 and 
modified in 2005 and 2010, and meet the criteria of those definitions, where: 
   
The CIM definitions pertaining to resources include the following: 
 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic 
material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, 
and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a 
grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, 
quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, 
estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. 
 
Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, 
Indicated and Measured categories. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of 
confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource. An Indicated Mineral Resource 
has a higher level of confidence than an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a lower level of 
confidence than a Measured Mineral Resource. 
 
An "Inferred Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 
grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and 
reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on 
limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 
 
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be 
assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an Indicated 
or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration. Confidence in the estimate 
is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical and economic parameters or to 
enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public disclosure. Inferred Mineral

Resources must be excluded from estimates forming the basis of feasibility or other economic 
studies. 
 
An "Indicated Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade 
or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a level of 
confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic 
parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 
The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered 
through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably 
assumed. 
 
A "Measured Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade 
or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can 
be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability 
of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both 
geological and grade continuity. 

 
14.2 Resource Modeling 
 
14.2.1 Data 
 
A three-dimensional block model was created for estimating the gold resources at the Salave deposit 
from data generated by Rio Tinto, Gold Fields, Anglo, Oromet, Newmont, Lyndex, Rio Narcea, and 
Astur, including percussion, RC, and core drill data.  These data, as well as digital topography of the 
project area, were provided to MDA by Astur and incorporated into a digital database in UTM Zone 29 
coordinates using the ETRS89 datum. 
 
14.2.2 Deposit Geology Pertinent to Resource Modeling 
 
Gold mineralization at Salave occurs within the granodiorite and overlying package of metasedimentary 
rocks (see Section 7.0); the gold resources reported herein are restricted to mineralization hosted within 
the granodiorite.  The bulk of the modeled gold mineralization is contained within thick zones of 
albitized and sericitized granodiorite that generally dip 10 to 20° to the west-southwest, more-or-less 
sub-parallel to the contact between granodiorite and metasedimentary rocks.  
 
14.2.3 Gold Modeling 
 
The gold resources at the Salave deposit were modeled and estimated by: 
 

 determining statistical and geological criteria to aid in the modeling of gold mineral domains; 

 interpreting gold mineral-domain polygons on a set of 26 northwest-looking cross sections 
(292.7°) spaced at 20-meter intervals;

March 10, 2014  Print Date: 19-Mar-2014 12:13 PM  

 rectifying the mineral-domain interpretations on northeast-looking long sections spaced at four-
meter intervals; 

 analyzing the modeled mineralization geostatistically to aid in the establishment of estimation 
and classification parameters; 

 interpolating grades into a three-dimensional block model, using the gold mineral domains to 
control estimation; and 

 undertaking various checks and re-interpolation runs until optimal results were generated.   

Arsenic was modeled in addition to gold, due to potential penalties associated with the processing of 
arsenic-rich gold concentrates.  The arsenic was modeled independently of gold, but in an identical 
manner.     
 
All modeling of the Salave project gold resources was performed using GEOVIA Surpac™ mining 
software.  Astur personnel worked in concert with MDA in all aspects of the gold and arsenic modeling, 
except for the final grade interpolations.  Astur's participation was invaluable in developing a model that 
respects the geology of the deposit as it is presently understood. 
  
14.2.3.1 Mineral Domains 
 
A mineral domain encompasses a volume of rock that ideally is characterized by a single, natural, grade 
population of a metal (or metals) that is associated with a set of specific geologic criteria.  In order to 
define the mineral domains at the Salave deposit, the natural populations of gold were first identified on 
a quantile graph that shows the gold-grade distribution of all Salave drill-hole assays.  Natural 
populations are manifested on the graph as changes in the slope of the plotted assay data.  Low-grade 
(~0.1 to ~0.9 g Au/t), medium-grade (~0.9 to ~8 g Au/t), and high-grade (>~8 g Au/t) populations can 
be distinguished on the quantile plot.  Ideally, each of these populations can be correlated with specific 
geologic characteristics that are captured in the project data to aid in the definition of the mineral 
domains.   
 
In order to identify the geologic characteristics that aid in the modeling of the domains, a set of 
northwest-looking paper cross sections were plotted at 20-meter intervals (the sections match the 
orientation of those in use at the project).  The present-day topographic profiles and drill-hole data are 
also plotted, including gold assays color-coded to match the grade-domain population ranges as well as 
lithologic and alteration codes.  After an initial review of these sections, it became clear that drill-hole 
intervals dominated by assays within the mid-grade population defined in the quantile plot (~0.9 to ~ 8 g 
Au/t) are strongly correlated to zones of intense albite-sericite alteration in the granodiorite.  This 
alteration type was therefore modeled on several sections in the central portion of the deposit and, as has 
been the case in previous modeling, the alteration is interpreted to form zones of highly variable widths 
that dip gently to the west-southwest.  The alteration modeling then served to control subsequent mid-
grade mineral-domain interpretations on these sections.  However, it became clear that the correlation 
between the alteration and mid-grade gold interpretations is so strong that gold can be modeled directly 
using the alteration codes posted on the drill holes (alleviating the need to first model alteration).  Other 
data that aided in the interpretation of the mid-grade domain included arsenic values (positively 
correlated with gold) and angles-to-core-axis of structural features (found on copies of handwritten drill 
logs).  The combination of the gently dipping zones of strong albite-sericite alteration, higher-grade 
arsenic values, structural angles-to-core-axes, and the statistically defined mid-grade gold population

served to guide the sectional modeling of the mid-grade gold mineral-domain polygons, which are 
assigned a code of mineral domain 200.     
 
A number of samples within the high-grade population (>~8 g Au/t) occur sporadically within the mid-
grade domain 200 but could not be modeled separately due to the lack of continuity.  There is, however, 
a cluster of high- to very high-grade samples in the northwestern quadrant of the deposit.  A number of 
structures are intersected by holes in this area, and drill logs indicate moderate- to high-angles-to-core-
axes for some structural features in these holes (as opposed to low- to moderate-dipping core-axes 
measurements that characterize the thick, gently dipping zones of domain 200).  These data led to the 
interpretation of several zones of sub-vertical high-grade mineralization (mineral domain 300), with 
limited across-strike width and irregular vertical continuity.  These sub-vertical high-grade structures 
have associated 'branches' of high-grade mineralization that lie within much broader zones of the gently 
dipping mid-grade domains, although the high-grade branches, as interpreted, extend for only limited 
distances away from the high-angle zones (see Figure 14.2).  It should be noted that the interpretation of 
the high-grade 'feeder'-like domain-300 mineralization is hampered by the preponderance of vertical 
holes, but it is felt that the modeling reasonably represents the actual volume of high-grade 
mineralization in this zone based on the data presently available. 
 
The low-grade gold domain was modeled as envelopes around the mid- and high-grade domains, 
sometimes including the fringes of the albite-sericite zones, but usually incorporating alteration zones of 
lesser intensity (e.g., chloritic to relatively unaltered granodiorite); this low-grade gold is assigned to 
domain 100.   
 
The interpreted mineral domains only model zones with demonstrable continuity.  In addition to the gold 
domains, the contact of the granodiorite with the metasedimentary rocks was modeled on the sections.  
Mineralization within the metasedimentary rocks was explicitly excluded from the mineral-domain 
modeling, which means that the mineral resources reported herein are derived entirely from gold 
mineralization hosted by granodiorite. 
 
Essentially all blocks that meet the resource cutoff, and therefore report to the project gold resources, are 
derived from the mid- and high-grade domains (domains 200 and 300, respectively).  The low-grade 
gold domain (domain 100) serves largely to estimate dilution into blocks that are only partly coded to 
the mid-grade and high-grade domains (i.e., into blocks that lie along the outer edges of the two higher-
grade domains). 
 
Two domains were also modeled for arsenic after the sectional gold domains were completed.  The 
higher-grade arsenic domain mimics gold domain 200 closely, while the low-grade arsenic domain is 
more extensive than the low-grade gold domain.   
 
Representative cross sections showing gold mineral-domain interpretations of the Salave deposit are 
shown in Figure 14.1 and Figure 14.2.

During the sectional mineral-domain modeling, the IMEBESA holes were often found to be anomalous 
in terms of grade, often being higher grade than adjacent holes drilled by other operators, as well as in 
location of the mineralized zones, which, if honored, would lead to irregularities in the domain modeling 
that appear to be artificial.  One of the IMEBESA core holes is angled to the northeast, while the 
remaining holes were drilled to the southeast, and most of the holes were drilled at angles between -35° 
and -47.5°; these orientations generally cut the gently west-southwest dipping zones at relatively poor 
angles, which could lead to unrepresentative samples.  Several previous operators of the Salave project 
have questioned the reliability of the IMEBESA drill-sample assays (see Sections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4).  In 
consideration of all of these factors, Astur and MDA decided to exclude the IMEBESA holes from the 
resource modeling.  The 24 RC holes drilled by Lyndex in 1997 were also excluded, due to concerns of 
potential down-hole contamination below the shallow water table at Salave, although only a small 
amount of data were thereby removed due to the shallow depths of these vertical holes (average of 28 
meters in depth, with minimum of three meters and maximum of 60 meters).  Excluding all the 
IMEBESA holes and the Lyndex RC holes, 265 holes for a total of 51,556 meters of drilling by 
operators prior to Astur were used for the resource estimate; these holes exclude any holes lacking assay 
data (e.g., some geotechnical holes).  Of the 265 holes, two are RC holes, 13 are combination RC-core 
holes, and 250 are core holes.   
 
The cross-sectional mineral-domain envelopes were digitized, pressed three-dimensionally to the drill 
holes, and then sliced vertically at four-meter intervals.  These slices were used to guide the refinement 
of the gold and arsenic mineral-domain interpretations on four-meter-spaced long sections oriented 
orthogonally to the original cross sections.     
 
14.2.3.2 Assay Coding, Capping, and Compositing 
 
Drill-hole gold and arsenic assays were coded to their respective mineral domains using the original 
cross-sectional mineral-domain envelopes.  No samples from the IMEBESA holes and Lyndex RC holes 
were allowed to be coded.  Descriptive statistics of the coded assays are provided for gold in Table 14.1 
and arsenic in Table 14.2.

Table 14.2 Descriptive Statistics of Coded Arsenic Assays 

 
 
The coded assays were plotted on quantile distribution plots by mineral domain to evaluate if multiple 
populations may exist in any of the domains, as well as to identify possible high-grade outliers that 
might be appropriate for capping.  The spatial relationships of the potential outlier samples with all of 
the drill data were then evaluated to determine their potential impacts during grade interpolation.  This 
process led to the capping of coded assays as summarized in Table 14.3.

The capped assays were composited at two-meter down-hole intervals that respect the mineral domain

14.2.3.3 Specific Gravity 
 
Astur supplied MDA with a set of Rio Narcea specific-gravity ("SG") measurements taken on drill core 
using the water-immersion method.  MDA recalculated the SG values based on the raw data provided 
and loaded the results into the resource database.  The SG values were then coded to the gold mineral 
domains for the purposes of statistical analysis, which is summarized in Table 14.6 (one anomalously 
high SG value from domain 300 is excluded). 
 

Table 14.6  Specific-Gravity Statistics by Mineral Domain 

 
 

The specific-gravity values increase with increasing gold-grade domain.  This is an expected result, as 
the gold mineralization is positively correlated with sulfide content (e.g., arsenopyrite, stibnite, and 
pyrite).  Astur's independent analysis of the SG data, completed prior to the MDA modeling, showed a 
similar positive correlation between gold grade and SG values.  It should be noted that there are 
insufficient SG data derived from domain 300 to be confident in the statistical values. 
 
14.2.3.4 Block Model Coding 
 
The four-meter-spaced long-section mineral-domain polygons were used to code the block model, which 
is comprised of four-meter-wide x four-meter-long x 4.5-meter-high blocks.  The block dimensions were 
chosen in consideration of potential mining by underground methods.  The model is rotated around the 
z-axis to a bearing of 292.7˚ to match the orientation of the project cross sections.  In order for the block 
model to better reflect the irregularly shaped limits of the mineral-domain polygons, as well as to 
explicitly model dilution, the percentage volume of each mineral domain within each block is stored in 
the block (the "partial percentages").  The partial percentages of each block that lies below surface 
topography were also coded into each block, and a solid was used to code the block's lithology 
(metasedimentary rocks or granodiorite).  
 
For the purpose of the block model, MDA assigned a single SG value for each gold domain, as well as 
for the granodiorite and metasedimentary units that lie outside of the modeled mineral domains; these 
values are shown in the "Model" column of Table 14.6.  A slightly lower SG value than is indicated by 
the statistics was chosen for domain 300 in order to account for void spaces that are likely present in this 
high-grade domain, which is thought to be related to a structural zone.   
 
The bulk of the gold (and related arsenic) mineralization at the Salave deposit occurs in relatively 
shallow-dipping zones, although much of the modeled high-grade mineralization is related to sub-
vertical structures.  In order to apply an appropriate search ellipse to each portion of the model, 
estimation area solids were constructed and used to code model blocks.  Three model areas were 
identified: (i) shallowly west-southwest-dipping zones, which dominate the model; (ii) a more-or-less

east-west-striking, vertically dipping high-grade structural zone; and (iii) moderately west-southwest-
dipping zones, which primarily occur adjacent to the vertically dipping zones.   
 
14.2.3.5 Grade Interpolation 
 
A variographic study was performed using the gold composites from each mineral domain, collectively 
and separately, at various azimuths, dips, and lags.  The study was complicated by the fact that the 
mineralization occurs in multiple orientations.  The most reliable structures modeled on the variograms 
were obtained with a strike of 350° and a shallow west-southwesterly dip (-15°), using composites from 
all domains jointly, as well as composites solely from domain 200 (the volumetrically most important 
domain).  Maximum ranges of about 50 meters along strike and 75 meters in the dip direction were 
obtained using this orientation and domain 200 composites, although most of the correlation between 
composites occurs at distances less than 15 meters (dip) to 25 meters (strike).  The results from the 
variography study were used to provide information relevant to estimation parameters and resource 
classification.   
 
The Salave gold resource grades were estimated using inverse-distance methods.  A number of gold 
interpolations were run using various parameters in an attempt to optimize the estimation.  A summary 
of the final parameters used in grade estimation is provided in in Table 14.7.

The major and semi-major axes of the search ellipses approximate the average strike and dip directions 
of the gold mineralization.  The first-pass search distances take into consideration the results of the 
variography, the drill spacing, and the results of multiple interpolation iterations to obtain optimal 
ranges.  The second pass was designed to estimate grade into all blocks coded to the mineral domains 
that were not estimated in the first pass.     
 
The estimation passes were performed independently for each of the mineral domains, so that only 
composites coded to a particular domain were used to estimate grade into blocks coded by that domain.  
The estimated grades were coupled with the partial percentages of the mineral domains to enable the 
calculation of a single weight-averaged undiluted grade for each block.  All estimations used length-
weighted composites. 
 
Gold grades for all domains were initially interpolated using inverse-distance to the third power.  In an 
attempt to control the effects of some outlier grades within the low-grade domain, the inverse-distance 
power was increased to the fourth power for this domain. 
 
The constraint of a maximum of three composites from a single drill hole was imposed, along with the 
relatively short composite length of two meters, to attempt to preserve local grade variations in the 
domains, especially those for high-grade intervals lying within the mid-grade domain.  
 
Arsenic was estimated identically as gold, with the exception that a third estimation pass was added.  
The third pass was needed to fully populate grades into the modeled domains because there are fewer 
arsenic composites than gold (not all drill samples were analyzed for arsenic). 
 
Figure 14.3 and Figure 14.4 show cross sections through the block model that correspond to the mineral-
domain cross sections in Figure 14.1, Figure 14.2, respectively.

14.2.3.6 Model Checks 
 
Volumes derived from the mineral-domain polygons of the original set of cross sections were compared 
to both the long-sectional and coded block-model volumes to assure close agreement.  All block-model 
coding was checked visually on the computer.  Nearest-neighbor and ordinary-krige estimates of the 
modeled resources were undertaken as a check on the inverse-distance estimation results.  Various 
grade-distribution plots of assays and composites versus the nearest neighbor, krige, and inverse-
distance block grades were evaluated as a check on the estimation.  Finally, the inverse-distance grades 
were visually compared to the drill-hole assay data to assure that reasonable results were obtained. 
 
14.3 Salave Project Gold Resources 
 
The Salave block-diluted gold resources are presented in Table 14.8 using a cutoff grade of 2.0 g Au/t.  
This cutoff is chosen to capture mineralization that is potentially available to underground mining, 
sulfide concentration, and gold recovery using off-site processing.   
 

Table 14.8 Salave Project Gold Resources  

 
 

 
 

Note: Rounding may cause apparent discrepancies 
 

Due to the necessity to maintain a surficial crown pillar in a potential underground operation, all 
material from the surface to a depth of 40 meters is not included in the Salave resources. 
 
The Salave resources are classified on the basis of the number and distance of composites used in the 
interpolation of a block, as well as the number of holes that contributed (Table 14.9).

The modeled extents of the Salave gold resources are approximately 525 meters in a northwesterly 
direction and 375 meters in a southwesterly direction.  The domains were modeled over a vertical extent 
of about 340 meters. 
 
The arsenic modeling allows for a general assessment of arsenic grades that are associated with the gold 
resources.  Measured and Indicated gold resources have an associated arsenic grade of about 0.7% As, 
while the Inferred gold resources have an associated arsenic grade of about 0.5%.  
 
Grade-distribution information at different cutoffs is provided in Table 14.10, which allows for an 
evaluation of the sensitivity of the resources to economic conditions or mining scenarios other than

14.4 Comments on the Resource Modeling 
 
The drill data support the modeling of the broad zones of strongly altered granodiorite and associated 
gold mineralization as shallow-dipping zones, and this interpretation is consistent with those of 
numerous previous geologists who have worked at the project.  The presence of multiple 
altered/mineralized intervals in each drill hole presents challenges, however, as to which interval in one 
hole should be correlated with another of the several intervals in an adjacent hole.  This challenge is 
exacerbated by abrupt changes in volume and/or location of some zones from section to section.  
Another uncertainty exists with the modeling of the sub-vertical high-grade domains using drill data 
from predominantly vertical holes, as was previously noted in Section 14.2.3.1.  While MDA is 
confident in the present interpretations, it is possible that the details of some of the correlations of 
mineralized zones, especially those of relatively limited continuity, may create local inaccuracies.  
However, if there are errors, they are mitigated by the high density of drilling, i.e., the extents of any 
such errors are significantly constrained by the drill data, especially within the Measured and Indicated 
resources.  An analogous mitigative effect is demonstrated in the insignificant change in resource ounces 
that would occur were assay caps removed (discussed below). 
 
MDA initially completed the Salave resource model in mid-December 2013.  Subsequent to this, Astur 
received final assays for a sequence of 10 holes drilled in late 2013, which were primarily drilled 
internal to the deposit as modeled in 2013.  These holes were added to the resource database, and the 
resource model was then updated in January 2014 to include the Astur core data, which created the 
opportunity to evaluate the initial 2013 modeling.  The new holes broadly confirm the modeling of the 
Salave resources.  As was expected (see discussion in the previous paragraph), there were several 
instances where the new data led to small interpretational changes as to the correlation of one intercept 
of a shallowly dipping zone with that from an adjacent hole, but the most common changes in these 
zones were in the interpreted widths, in both positive and negative directions.  Of particular interest is 
one hole that was drilled directly down the axis of the main sub-vertical high-grade domain.  The results 
of this hole were remarkably consistent with the 2013 interpretations.  The ultimate impact of the 10 
2013 holes was the addition of 6,000 ounces to the model at the resource cutoff of 2.0 g Au/t.       
 
Astur has received a positive environmental impact assessment for an underground mine and has 
resubmitted environmental studies to permit flotation and tailings facilities.  Underground mining will 
assume a 40-meter crown pillar from the present surface.  This near-surface portion of the deposit 
would, in effect, serve as a crown pillar for an underground operation.  The project resources do not 
include 389,000 tonnes of what would be classified as Measured and Indicated material at a grade of 
3.14 g Au/t (39,000 ounces) from the surface to a depth of 40 meters within the crown pillar.    
 
In order to evaluate the impact of assay capping on the Salave resources, the model was re-estimated 
using composites of uncapped assays.  The uncapped estimation results in a gain of 16,000 ounces in the 
Measured and Indicate categories (+2%) and 2,000 ounces in the Inferred category (+2%) at the 2.0 g 
Au/t resource cutoff.  
 
The Salave gold mineralization is associated with arsenopyrite, which would be captured in flotation 
concentrates.  Due to potential penalties that could be incurred for the processing of arsenic-rich 
concentrates, arsenic was estimated into the model in addition to gold.  The arsenic values are derived 
from various multi-element ICP analyses whose accuracies have not been determined.  Metallurgical 
results suggest that at least some of the arsenic analyses may be overstated by approximately 10%.

There are a number of significant differences between the current mineral resource estimate described 
herein and the one reported by RPA in 2010 (Agnerian, 2010) (see brief description in Section 6.3 of 
this report), as well as the "inventory of mineral resources" for the underground-mining scenario 
summarized in Golder's Preliminary Economic Assessment (Tenorio, 2011; Tenorio et al., 2013) (see 
brief descriptions in Sections 6.3 and 17.1 of this report).  Some of these differences include: 

 The current mineral resource is based on an underground-only mining scenario.  The 2010 
mineral resource estimate was based on open-pit mining of most of the resource with 
underground mining of an Inferred underground resource located outside of the open pit shell.   

 The current estimate uses a single 2.0 g Au/t cutoff, whereas the 2010 estimate used a cutoff of 
2.5 g Au/t for the underground resource and a cutoff of 0.7 g Au/t for the open-pit resource.  The 
2011 "inventory of mineral resources" in the Preliminary Economic Assessment for the 
underground-mining scenario used variable cutoff grades. 

 The current estimate excluded the IMEBESA core holes and the 24 RC holes drilled by Lyndex 
in 1997 but included all of Rio Narcea's drilling and the 2013 drilling by Astur.  The 2010 
estimate included the IMEBESA and Lyndex holes but 70 of 79 Rio Narcea holes and none of  
Astur's subsequent drilling; the 2011 Preliminary Economic Assessment was based on the 2010 
estimate. 

 The current estimate includes high-grade mineralization in sub-vertical fracture/fault zones 
located in the northwestern part of the deposit.  Although Rio Narcea had recognized the 
presence of this type of mineralization in the deposit, it was not included in the model used for 
the 2010 estimate. 

 The 2010 modeling capped high-grade values of four-meter composites.  The current estimated 
capped original high-grade assays and then composited the samples into two-meter composites.  
The relatively short composites were chosen in an attempt to preserve inhomogeneities in grade, 
especially higher-grade intervals present sporadically within the mid-grade gold domain. 

 The current resources are stated on a fully block-diluted basis, while the 2010 resources were 
reported undiluted. 

 The current estimate excludes material from the surface to a depth of 40 meters for a crown 
pillar.  No such exclusion was made in the 2010 resource estimate because the open pit would 
mine this material.  

 
Subsequent resource modeling could be improved by the incorporation of detailed logging of new or 
existing core holes, with the specific goal of compiling structural observations (carefully documented 
angles-to-core-axes) that will aid in the creation of a structural model of the Salave deposit.  Angled core 
holes that cut the high-grade, high-angle gold mineralization would be particularly useful.  Upon 
completion of a structural model, the present resource model could be evaluated and updated if 
warranted.

17.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION  
 
17.1 2011 Preliminary Economic Assessment 
 
Golder prepared a Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") of the Salave project with an effective 
date of February 12, 2011 (Tenorio, 2011; Tenorio et al., 2013) that examined three mining scenarios – 
a large initial open pit with minor underground mining at the end of the mine life, underground only, and 
underground mining concurrently with a small open pit – and, for each mining scenario, considered two 
processing options – pressure and biological oxidation methods.  That PEA was based on the mineral 
resource estimate reported in the 2010 Technical Report by RPA described in Section 6.3 and shown on 
Table 6.4 of this report (Agnerian, 2010), but the 2010 mineral resource estimate has been superseded 
by the one described in Section 14.0 of this report.  The PEA was based on a throughput rate of 1.1 
million tonnes per year, a gold price of US$1,100 per ounce, and an average plant recovery of 95%.  A 
zone extending 40 meters below surface was removed from the inventory as a crown pillar. 
 
For each scenario, an "inventory of mineral resources contained within the pit shells and underground 
stopes" was estimated.  Golder noted that "the quantities and grades tabulated and summarized by 
Mineral Resource categories contained within pit shells and underground designs used in the scenarios 
for the PEA are not an update of the Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves completed by RPA but are 
the quantities of the RPA Mineral Resources contained within the designs."  Golder further cautioned, 
"The figures obtained with this exercise must not be considered an inventory of mineral resources or 
mineral reserves, and do not have economic viability and there is no certainty that the preliminary 
assessment will be realized" and "The PEA is preliminary and includes inferred resources that are 
considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would 
enable then [sic] to be categorized as mineral reserves" (Tenorio et al., 2013).   
 
Golder noted that the underground resources require better definition of the geometry of the limits of the 
mineralization.  The blocks from the 2010 resource block model by RPA were grouped by Golder as a 
function of different economic cutoffs into three different height sizes:  4 to 8 meters, 8 to 16 meters, 
and greater than 16 meters.  Then for each mineral zone it was determined which areas have sufficient 
continuity of the groups to allow underground mining.  Table 17.1 shows the "inventory of mineral 
resources" based on the underground-only mining scenario, with the cautions described above.

17.2 1991 Pre-Feasibility Work 
 
As part of its investigation to assess the mineral potential of the Salave project, Newmont carried out 
initial aspects of a pre-feasibility study in 1991.  The following description of that work is taken from 
Knutsen (1991b) and the Technical Report by Agnerian (2010). 
 
Newmont's work included: 
 

 Identification of required surface properties 
 Generation of detailed topographic maps 
 Environmental baseline studies, including socio-economic impacts and climatic data 
 Site geotechnical studies 
 Archeological studies to ensure that the company satisfied the requirements of the Consejería de 

Cultura (Council of Culture) of Asturias 
 Assessment of capabilities of Spanish engineering and construction companies 
 Mineralogical studies.  Newmont carried out a number of analyses using x-ray fluorescence 

("XRF") and x-ray diffraction ("XRD") techniques. 
 Metallurgical studies.  Newmont concluded that the high dolomite content coincident with the 

mineralization (would make) bio-oxidation of heap-leachable ores impractical (Knutsen, 1991b). 
 Collection of information regarding permitting, applicable regulations, and government financial 

support 
 Consideration of the potential value of feldspar as a by-product from future mining operations at 

Salave.

Newmont paid particular attention to the hydrologic and archeological aspects of the property because of 
the project's proximity to the coastline and the potential dewatering problems of operating below sea 
level.  In terms of hydrogeology, Newmont's primary concerns included: 
 

 Delineation and characterization of the water table aquifer in the unconsolidated and weathered 
bedrock 

 Delineation and characterization of fracture and fault flow in the bedrock. 
 
Based on a report by Sunblad (1991), Newmont concluded that: 
 

 "Bedrock is competent with the exception of faulted, brecciated and highly fractured zones.  It is 
probable that intrusive syenite dikes in the deposit may provide zones of aquifer storage due to 
solution weathering. 

 Examination of the water levels in the borehole piezometers indicates confined aquifer condition 
in the bedrock.  Boundary conditions produce dramatically different pressure heads (up to 8m) 
across relatively short horizontal distance between boreholes.  The local flow gradient in the 
deposit area is toward the lagos or the center of the project area. 

 The lagos (small flooded area within the Roman pit) provide a potential connection or outlet to 
the atmosphere for the deeper confined system and water table aquifer.  The aquifer zones are 
connected in the mine area due to previous mining in the pit area, exploration boreholes and 
adits, and the dewatering galleries." 

Although minor data collection of public information continued until Newmont relinquished the 
property at the end of 1991, further work remained to be completed by Newmont prior to a feasibility 
study report on the project.  Newmont, however, did not complete this feasibility study. 
 
Newmont also contracted an archaeological study of the project area by Dr. A. Villa Valdés.  As 
expected, the archaeological inventory confirmed the historic mining activities by the Romans, including 
the presence of a network of hydrologic canals, but no evidence was found for Roman habitation 
(Agnerian, 2010).

18.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS  
 
MDA audited the Salave project database used in the resource estimation and visited the project site.  
MDA believes that the data provided by Astur are generally an accurate and reasonable representation of 
the Salave project. 
 
Although the Salave area was mined for gold by the Romans in the first century AD, drilling by 
IMEBESA, a subsidiary of Northgate Exploration Ltd., in 1970-1971 was the first modern exploration 
of the property to identify gold mineralization.  Through Astur's drilling in September 2013, nine 
companies have drilled at least 345 core holes and 139 percussion-RC (113 RC and 26 shallow 
percussion) holes on and near the current Salave project. 
 
The gold mineralization at Salave occurs in a series of stacked, north- to north-northwest-trending, 
shallowly west-dipping irregular lenses related to faults and fracture zones that are parallel to the contact 
of intrusive and metasedimentary rocks.  The lenses appear to be related to one or more vertical 
structures, at least some of which contain high-grade mineralization.  The dimensions of the individual 
mineralized zones range from 50 meters to 300 meters in length, 10 meters to 150 meters in width, and 
five meters to 60 meters in thickness, with an average thickness on the order of 20 meters.  The 
mineralized zones occur within an area approximately 400 meters wide, 500 meters long, and at least 
350 meters deep.   
 
The Salave gold deposit is primarily hosted by granodiorite that has yielded radiometric ages of 292 and 
287 Ma.  Gold occurs both disseminated and in veins and is primarily associated with acicular 
disseminated arsenopyrite, variable amounts of pyrite and stibnite and with intense albite-sericite-
carbonate alteration. 
 
The updated mineral resource estimate described in this report uses a cutoff grade of 2.0 g Au/t, which 
was chosen to capture mineralization that is potentially available to underground mining, sulfide 
concentration, and gold recovery using off-site processing.  Arsenic was estimated into the model in 
addition to gold because of the association of the gold mineralization with arsenopyrite, which would be 
captured in flotation concentrates.  Due to the necessity to maintain a surficial crown pillar in a potential 
underground operation, all material from the surface to a depth of 40 meters is not included in the Salave 
resources.  Measured and Indicated resources total 6,522,000 tonnes averaging 4.51 g Au/t for a total of 
944,000 ounces of gold, with an additional 1,078,000 tonnes averaging 3.05 g Au/t for a total of 106,000 
ounces of gold in the Inferred category. 
 
Astur is in the process of completing a feasibility study that will likely be done sometime during the 
second quarter of 2014.  Astur has received a positive environmental impact assessment for an 
underground mine and has resubmitted environmental studies to permit flotation and tailings facilities.  
Astur does not have the necessary surface land for all facilities but plans to purchase, lease, or use an 
expropriation process to obtain the necessary lands.

19.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
There are two main recommendations for the project to continue on a path toward development.  First, 
the ongoing feasibility study should be completed sometime during the second quarter of 2014.  We 
have not included an estimate for the feasibility study, as most of the work on the study has been 
completed. 
 
Second, the deposit has not been completely drilled out and is open to the west; in addition, as described 
in Section 9.0, there are untested geophysical anomalies and mineralized, steeply dipping structural 
zones on the ocean cliff faces that should be explored.  In addition, some of the drilled areas require 
infill development drilling to prove Inferred materials.  These areas cannot be drilled from the surface 
due to permitting constraints and surface ownership issues of some areas.  Planning for a potential 
underground mine is at an advanced stage.  The same decline and level development could be used for 
both underground development drilling and during actual mine operations, should the feasibility study 
prove positive. 
 
The time required and cost of gaining access to complete the development drilling are significant.  
About 18 to 24 months of development are required prior to drilling.  Table 19.1 shows the estimated 
cost of this program.
