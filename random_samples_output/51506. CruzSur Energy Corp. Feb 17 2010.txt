1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

Gustavson Associates LLC (the Consultant) has been retained by Manas Petroleum Corporation 

(the Client, Manas) to prepare an Economic Evaluation Report regarding the currently licensed 

Blocks 2 & 3 concession position in Albania. 

 

The license position is described as Blocks 2 & 3 that is subject to a Production Sharing Contract 

(PSC) with the Albanian government that was signed in early November 2008 and was ratified 

by the Albanian government on July 8, 2009.  The effective date of the PSC is July 31, 2009. 

Blocks 2 & 3 include a total of approximately 851,031 acres (3,444 square kilometers)
1
 located 

along the NW-SE trending fold belt known as the Berati Belt in central Albania.  The plays 

include potential conventional exploration targets involving sub-thrust hydrocarbon 

accumulations in fractured carbonates. 

 

Manas' primary exploration targets are deep (approximately 13,045 feet (3,976 meters) to 16,174 

feet (4,930 meters)), sub-thrust fractured carbonate reservoirs.  Seismic imaging from the 1990s 

revealed a large carbonate sub-thrust, extending over Blocks 2 and 3 on the Manas concession 

known as the Ionian carbonate, which is the targeted reservoir and holds most Albanian onshore 

hydrocarbon reserves. 

 

There are three prospects included in this report known as Spiragu in Block 2, Spiragu South 1, 

and Spiragu South 2 in Block 3. There are also a number of lead areas that will be delineated by 

seismic and may be explored in the future on both Blocks. 

 

The hydrocarbon type that could occur in these reservoirs is most likely oil with associated gas 

based on the results of the Occidental Petroleum Spiragu 1 well.  This report considers only the 

oil with associated gas and it is expected that it will be good quality oil with an API gravity of 37 

degrees.

 All values are presented in both US standard and metric units. Standard conversions were used for distance, area 
and volume values. For Oil, a 37

Manas Petroleum Corporation operates under a PSC that covers Blocks 2 and 3.  The PSC 

specifies the work commitment and fiscal terms.  The work commitment represents the capital 

investments that Manas Petroleum Corporation will spend on the exploration of their blocks, 

while fiscal terms govern the allocation of revenues resulting from oil and gas production. 

 

The objective of the economic model constructed by Gustavson Associates is to estimate the Net 

Present Value (NPV15) based on the exploration and development of the P50 Prospective 

Resource Estimates
2
 from the "Resource Evaluation Report on Manas Petroleum Corporation's 

Concessions in Albania Blocks 2 and 3" dated 15 December, 2009 that was prepared by Letha C. 

Lencioni of Gustavson Associates
3
. All of the resources in this report are Prospective Resources. 

These resources are classified as Prospective Resources based on the commercial risk as defined 

by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, (Calgary Chapter): Canadian Oil and Gas 

Evaluation Handbook, Second Edition, Volume 1, September 1, 2007, pg 5-9 to 5-10. In order to 

assign recoverable resources, a development plan consisting of one or more projects needs to be 

defined. Estimates of recoverable quantities are stated in terms of the sales products derived from 

a development program, assuming commercial development. It must be recognized that reserves, 

contingent resources and prospective resources involve different risks associated with achieving 

commerciality. The likelihood that a project will achieve commerciality is referred to as the 

"chance of commerciality." The risk of commerciality for Prospective Resources is that not all 

exploration projects will result in discoveries.  The chance that an exploration project will result 

in the discovery of petroleum is referred to as the "chance of discovery."  Thus, for an 

undiscovered accumulation the chance of commerciality is the product of two risk components â€“ 

the chance of discovery and the chance of development.

 The P50 resource numbers in the economic report differ slightly from those in the resource report. The difference is 
well within the margin of error, since there is considerable uncertainty about the prospects at this time. The two 
reports use different timing assumptions. Parameters for the well type curves were selected so that production over 
30 years would be equal to the P50 resources, given an assumed well spacing. The economic model used the same 
type curve parameters, but did not restrict production to 30 years. Rather, the economic model includes a schedule of 
drilling and production so that wells come on-stream at different times, and continue producing until the economic 
limit is reached or the year 2052, assuming that sufficient extensions of the PSC term will be allowed. The small 
difference in resources between the two reports is dwarfed by the much larger range of uncertainty about the size of 
the potential resources.

In the model, two scenarios are considered.  Under the first scenario (Complete Success), it is 

assumed that the exploration program will be successful leading to the discovery of commercial 

hydrocarbons at each one of the three prospects.  Under the second scenario (Complete Failure), 

it is assumed that no discovery of commercial hydrocarbons is made at either of the two initial 

prospects, Spiragu and Spiragu South 2, and the blocks are abandoned. 

 

There are many variables in a success case scenario such as drilling and operating costs, the 

number of rigs used, flow rates, pipeline diameters, pricing, etc. that could change which would 

have a material impact on the potential value of this project. Gustavson Associates used the best 

current estimates available as well as input from Manas for this report. 

 

The results of the economic modeling of the Manas project conditioned on success of the Manas 

exploration program are summarized in the table below with both Imperial and Metric volumes.

 Prospective Resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable 
from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects.  Prospective resources have both 
an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.  Prospective Resources are further subdivided in 
accordance with the level of certainty associated with recoverable estimates assuming their discovery and 
development and may be subclassified based on project maturity.

Second Edition, Volume 1, September 1, 2007, pg 5-7.

There is uncertainty about the outcome that may occur as a result of the exploration program on 

the Manas blocks.  This means that the chance of success at all of the prospects is very small.  

So, the results for the complete success scenario should be viewed as an indication of the 

potential upside for the blocks, which may only have a small chance of occurring. 

 

In the complete failure scenario, the capital expenditures are estimated to be $53MM.  This 

would include the reprocessing of seismic data and the drilling and testing of two exploratory 

wells.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 

 

4.1 DESCRIPTION OF MANAS BLOCKS 

 

The license position is described as Blocks 2 & 3 (Figure 4-1) that are subject to a Production 

Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Albanian government that was signed in early November 2008 

and is expected to be ratified by the Albanian government in late June 2009. These concession 

blocks contain a total of approximately 851,031 acres (3,444 square kilometers) located along a 

thrust belt system with a northwest â€“ southeast trend. The plays include potential conventional 

exploration targets involving sub-thrust hydrocarbon accumulations in fractured carbonates.

12/15/2009 4-2 Gustavson Associates 

4.2 LOCATION 

 

The Republic of Albania (Republika e ShqipÃ«risÃ«) is located on the eastern side of the Adriatic 

Sea in Southeast Europe and has significant natural resources that include oil and gas. It has 

common borders with Montenegro to the North, Kosovo to the Northeast, Macedonia to the East 

and Greece to the Southeast. The capital of the Republic of Albania is Tirana, which has 800,000 

inhabitants, and is located near the center of the country. Albania has a total area of 11,100 

square miles (28,750 square kilometers). Its coastline is 225 miles (362 kilometers) long and 

stretches along the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea. 

 

Detailed descriptions of these concessions can be found in Section 5.1 of the Resource 

Evaluation Report
6
. 

 

4.3 ACCESS AND INFRASTRUCTURE  

 

Oil and gas infrastructure in Albania is limited to the southern part of the country where there is 

current oil and gas production on the Manas concession Block 2 and 3.  

 

The Porto Romano Jetty, a terminal for importing refined petroleum products and Liquid 

Petroleum Gas (LPG) has been built by Romano Port Sh.a. on the coast in the Duress area. This 

terminal became operational April 2009 and has the capacity for 24,000 cubic meters of liquids 

and is projected to have the capacity for 102,620 barrels (14,000 tonnes) of oil per day and 141.2 

MCF (4,000 cubic meters) of LPG per day. This terminal could be modified to enable oil exports 

from the Manas blocks. Also, there is a proposal for the construction of a power plant in the area 

that would use the imported hydrocarbons or the potential production from the Manas concession 

areas and a proposal for another hydrocarbon terminal.

 "Resource Evaluation Report on Manas Petroleum Corporation's Concessions in Albania Blocks 2 and 3" dated 
June 1, 2009 was prepared by Gustavson Associates. 



12/15/2009 4-3 Gustavson Associates 

4.4 OWNERSHIP 

 

These potential resources are owned by the Republic of Albania and have been licensed for 

development to DWM Petroleum AG, a Swiss corporation, which is a subsidiary of Manas 

Petroleum Corporation. 

 

4.5 FISCAL TERMS OF THE PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENT 

 

The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for Exploration, Development and Production of 

Petroleum in Onshore Albania was signed in early November 2008 between the Government of 

Albania, represented by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy of Albania, and Manas 

Petroleum Corporation represented by DWM Petroleum AG (see press release below). This 

agreement governs exploration, development and production of Blocks 2 and 3 in southern 

Albania and was ratified by the Albanian government on July 8, 2009.  The effective date of the 

PSC is July 31, 2009. The PSC terms establish a framework designed to provide flexibility and 

fair return to the company and the government while limiting undue administrative burden and 

interference.   

 

 



12/15/2009 4-4 Gustavson Associates 

Manas Petroleum Corporation and partners would operate under the PSC.  PSC terms specify 

two primary economic aspects related to the work commitment and fiscal terms.  The work 

commitment represents the capital investments that Manas Petroleum Corporation will spend on 

the exploration of their blocks, while fiscal terms govern the allocation of revenues resulting 

from oil and gas production.  The PSC terms are summarized in Table 4-1 through Table 4-4 

Government production allocation and the entitlements of the Contractor and government to 

profit petroleum are determined by the R-Factor. The R-Factor is calculated as the ratio of the 

Contractor's cumulative receipts from the effective date until the end of the preceding calendar 

year to the Contractor's cumulative expenditures incurred from the effective date until the end of 

the preceding calendar year. The Contractor's receipts are calculated as the aggregate value of 

the Contractor's share of profit petroleum plus cost recovery petroleum and less Albanian taxes. 

The Contractor's expenditures are the aggregate value of all bonuses, costs, expenses and 

expenditures previously incurred by the Contractor under the contract. 

 

The effective date as determined by the PSC terms is the date on which a decision of the Council 

of Ministers of the Government of Albania approves the contract and is published in the "Gazeta 

Zyrtare", the local newspaper.  The effective date of the Manas Blocks 2 & 3 PSC in Albania is 

early November, 2008; therefore, the initial 3-year exploration period will end in early 

November, 2011.  Assuming that Manas completes the work program (Table 4-3) for the First 

Exploration Period and decides to exercise the option of using the 2-year extension period, the 

Second Exploration Period will continue until early November, 2013.  Provided Manas 

completes the work program for the Second Exploration Period (Table 4-3) and decides to 

exercise the option of using the second 2-year extension period, the Third Exploration Period 

will end in early November, 2015.

Upon a discovery and the approval of the development plan by the Government of Albania, the 

production period will continue for 20 years for each field from its date of initial commercial 

production and based on the Petroleum Law, the production period may be extended by 5 years.  

Assuming that a discovery is made during the second exploration period and the initial 

commercial production begins on January 1, 2013, the 20-year production period will continue 

until January 1, 2033 and with the extension until January 1, 2038.  Assuming the discovery is 

made during the third exploration period and the initial commercial production begins on 

January 1, 2015, the 20-year production period will continue until January 1, 2035 and with the 

extension until January 1, 2040.  If the discovered fields continue producing beyond the 25-year 

production period, Manas should renegotiate the duration of the production period specified in 

the PSC.

5 EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 

 

5.1 CURRENT STATUS 

 

5.1.1 Summary of Geological and Geophysical Findings 

 

The primary exploration targets are sub-thrust fractured carbonate reservoirs similar to those 

discovered in the 1990s in the Apennines of Italy. During the same time Shell and Coparex 

discovered a deep under-thrust structure within the B block to the north that, by their 

calculations, has the potential to contain a combined 820 million barrels (MMB) (112 million 

tonnes (MMT) of recoverable oil. Oxy drilled a well and tested a similar deep under-thrust 

structure that flowed oil on Block 2. Manas has this opportunity because Oxy and their partners 

suspended all exploration activity and abandoned the blocks in reaction to financial problems 

caused by a downturn in the oil industry allowing Manas to later acquire these superbly defined, 

giant, virtually drill-ready prospects. 

 

Manas' primary exploration targets are deep (13,045 feet (3,976 meters) to 16,174 feet (4,930 

meters)
7
 Measured Depth), sub-thrust fractured carbonate reservoirs. Seismic imaging revealed a 

large carbonate sub-thrust, extending over Blocks 2 and 3 on the Manas concession known as the 

Ionian carbonate, which is the targeted reservoir and holds most Albanian onshore reserves. 

 

The Ionian thrust sheet's source rocks are more ancient Jurassic age carbonates and shales 

formed 199 to 145 million years ago. These strata are covered by Cretaceous through Eocene age 

limestone reservoir rocks that are then sealed by thick Miocene age (Neogene) flysch. 

 

Manas is committed to the exploration of hydrocarbons in Albania where they have reprocessed 

up to 411 miles (662 kilometers) of existing 2D seismic data and have acquired 118 miles (190 

kilometers) of new data in Blocks A and B at a cost of US$3.0MM in order to better delineate 

the optimal drilling locations to test their prospective areas in the concession areas. The existing

2D seismic data over the Block A, B, D, and E concession area totals approximately 2,485 miles 

(4,000 kilometers) and was shot by AlbPetrol, Shell, INA, Premier Oil and Coparex. 

A large amount of the existing data has been reprocessed by various companies but, all vintages 

of data suffer from data quality deterioration in areas of rugged surface topography and complex 

subsurface geology in Albania. This includes the Block 2 & 3 area where Oxy acquired data in 

1998 and 2003. 

 

Manas plans to reprocess approximately 211 miles (340 kilometers) of existing 2D seismic data 

acquired by Oxy, if necessary, in order to better delineate the optimal drilling locations to test 

their prospective areas over the Spiragu area. Manas has obtained a copy of these data, and is 

currently evaluating it. 

 

Gustavson has reviewed the existing migrated seismic data set and created a preliminary 

structural interpretation. This interpretation is the basis for the areal extent of the potential 

hydrocarbon reservoirs used in the resource calculations. This interpretation will be updated 

when the final processed stack data becomes available or when the Manas interpretation can be 

reviewed. 

 

There are three prospects included in this report. They are known as Spiragu located in the south 

part of Block 2, Spiragu South 1, and Spiragu South 2 located in Block 3. A map of Manas 

license blocks and prospect locations is shown on Figure 5-1.   

 

The Spiragu prospect located in the south part of Block 2 (Figure 5-1) will be tested first as the 

existing Oxy well can be re-entered

, followed by Spiragu South 2 located in Block 3. If 

successful, Manas would then test the remaining prospect known as Spiragu South 1.

Exploration Risk Analysis 

 
The quantification of risk for this play can be characterized with the following variables: 

 

â€¢ Structure: defined as the presence of a structure that could act as a trap for hydrocarbons;  

â€¢ Seal: defined as an impermeable barrier that would prevent hydrocarbons from leaking 

out of the structure;  

â€¢ Reservoir: defined as the rock that is in a structurally favorable position having sufficient 

void space present whether it be matrix porosity or fracture porosity to accumulate 

hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to be commercial and  

â€¢ Presence of Hydrocarbons: defined as the occurrence of hydrocarbon source rocks that 

could have generated hydrocarbons during a time that was favorable for accumulation in 

the structure. 

 

Table 5-1 shows the Probability of Success (POS) that the above-defined variables would occur, 

for any one prospect. This POS would be for the first well drilled in the project area and may 

change depending on the results of the first well. The Overall POS is the product of all four 

variables.

Reservoir 60 Dependent on proven fracture and joint presence 

Presence of HC 90 Oxy Spiragu 1 well tested oil; source beds contained in section

The overwhelming risk, in these prospects, is in the interpretation of these complex structural 

plays and the presence of reservoir quality Ionian carbonate. Some of the 2D seismic has 

difficulty imaging the earth clearly below the shallowest thrust faulting. The Kruja limestone has 

been encountered in wells drilled on these concession blocks as well as the Ionian carbonate 

where production has been established to the west.  The main risk in the Block 2 & 3 prospects is 

in the size and productivity of the hydrocarbon accumulations. The seismic suffers from 



12/15/09 5-5 Gustavson Associates 

multiples and other artifacts that may taint the interpreter's view of the deeper structures. The 

seismic data may benefit from reprocessing as well as better velocity control from an exploratory 

well. The interpreted seismic lines should include the surface geology with the type, strike and 

dip of rock units and any surface expressions of faults with their strike and dip so that these data 

are incorporated into the interpretation. The structural sections need to be balanced and undergo 

palinspastic reconstruction to make sure that the interpretation makes sense and to mitigate risk. 

 

The probability of success for a wildcat well in a structurally complex area such as this is 

relatively high due to the fact that it is in a structurally favorable area, there exists a proven 

hydrocarbon source, production from analogous structures is located only 10.5 miles (17 

kilometers) away, and one of the structures has already been successfully tested. Some of the 

structural risk may be mitigated by the reprocessing of the old seismic data. 

 

5.1.2 Summary of Resource Estimates 

 

The hydrocarbon type that could occur in these reservoirs is expected to be oil with associated 

gas.  It is expected that the oil present at the depths of these prospects will be good quality oil 

with API gravity in the range of 30 to 37 degrees as seen in the Spiragu 1 well test. 

 

A report, "Resource Evaluation Report on Manas Petroleum Corporation's Concessions in 

Albania Blocks 2 and 3" dated 15 December, 2009 by Gustavson Associates, presented 

probabilistic Prospective Resources

 for the Manas prospects. The median (P50) prospective 

resource estimate is shown in Table 5-2. This resource estimate assumes that the prospects will 

be successful and fully developed. The prospects have not yet been drilled, and it is possible that 

there will not be commercial hydrocarbons in some or all of the prospects. It is also possible that 

there may be more resources than shown in Table 5-2.

 Prospective Resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable 
from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects.  Prospective resources have both 
an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.  Prospective Resources are further subdivided in 
accordance with the level of certainty associated with recoverable estimates assuming their discovery and 
development and may be subclassified based on project maturity.

These resources are classified as Prospective Resources based on the commercial risk as defined 

by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, (Calgary Chapter): Canadian Oil and Gas 

Evaluation Handbook, Second Edition, Volume 1, September 1, 2007, pg 5-9 to 5-10. In order to 

assign recoverable resources, a development plan consisting of one or more projects needs to be 

defined. Estimates of recoverable quantities are stated in terms of the sales products derived from 

a development program, assuming commercial development. It must be recognized that reserves, 

contingent resources and prospective resources involve different risks associated with achieving 

commerciality. The likelihood that a project will achieve commerciality is referred to as the 

                                                 
10
 The P50 resource numbers in the economic report differ slightly from those in the resource report. The difference is 
well within the margin of error. The P50 resource numbers reflect the modeled production stream through 2052. The 
production will continue beyond 2052 and therefore the resources will not be fully depleted. 



12/15/09 5-7 Gustavson Associates 

"chance of commerciality." The chance of commerciality for Prospective Resources is that:  Not 

all exploration projects will result in discoveries.  The chance that an exploration project will 

result in the discovery of petroleum is referred to as the "chance of discovery."  Thus, for an 

undiscovered accumulation the chance of commerciality is the product of two risk components â€“ 

the chance of discovery and the chance of development. 

 

Due to the significant geological risk associated with the identified prospects, there is uncertainty 

about resource estimates in the Manas blocks. The chance of success at all of the prospects is 

very small. Therefore, the resource estimates for all prospects should be viewed as an indication 

of the potential upside for the blocks, which may have only a small chance of occurring.      

 

5.2 PROPOSED EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 

 

5.2.1 Exploration 

 

Manas plans to reprocess approximately 211 miles (340 kilometers) of existing 2D seismic data 

acquired by Oxy, if necessary, in order to better delineate the optimal drilling locations to test 

their prospective areas over the Spiragu area. Manas obtained a copy of the final stack data, and 

is currently evaluating it. 

 

Manas plans to re-enter the Spiragu 1 well on the Spiragu Prospect and drill a new sidetrack first. 

Manas will drill an exploration well as a straight hole on the remaining prospects. If a new well 

has indications of the presence of hydrocarbons, after running a full suite of wireline logs, Manas 

will then drill a directional sidetrack well oriented at an optimum angle and azimuth to intersect 

the most fractures. Manas will test the well for 15 days to determine if commercial flow rates can 

be established, and to collect data to aid in the optimization of field development. Upon 

completion of a successful exploration well at a prospect, two appraisal or delineation wells will 

be drilled and tested at that prospect. If these wells are successful, Manas will then commence 

drilling development wells. 

 



12/15/09 5-8 Gustavson Associates 

The prospect named Spiragu located in the south part of Block 2 (Figure 6-6) will be tested first 

as the existing Oxy well can be re-entered, followed by Spiragu South 2 located in Block 3. If 

successful, Manas would then test the remaining prospect known as Spiragu South 1. If the first 

two tests fail, then Manas will abandon the project.   

 

This evaluation assumes a variety of drilling times and costs, depending on depth, for 

exploratory, appraisal, and development wells, as shown in Table 5-3. 

 

5.2.2 Development 

 

The assumed spacing of development wells would be on a 160-acre (0.65 square kilometer) 

spacing plan.

6 MARKET ANALYSIS 

 

6.1 REGIONAL ENERGY MARKETS 

 

6.1.1 Current Status 

 

6.1.1.1 Oil 

 

Albanian domestic oil production is low and the country is highly dependent on oil imports to 

meet its consumption needs (Table 6-1). In 2008 oil production was 6.0 MB/D (0.8 MT/D) while 

the 2008 oil consumption was forecast to be 33.0 MB/D (4.5 MT/D).  For 2008, oil import was 

forecast to be 27 MB/D (3.7 MT/D).   

 

In 2008, the total proved oil reserves in Albania were estimated at 199 MMB (27.1 MMT)
11
. 

 

Albania does not have sufficient refining capacity to process oil that may be produced by Manas.  

There are two refineries located at Ballsh and Fier, 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of the capital 

city of Tirana. The capacity of these two refineries is about 26,000 BPD (3,547 TPD).  These 

refineries are technically inefficient and require modernization. To address this issue, on 

February 19, 2008, the Government of Albania announced an international tender for the 

privatization of an 85% interest in the Albanian refineries
12
 (ARMO). This tender was recently 

awarded to Taci Oil International. 

 

6.1.1.2 Gas 

 

The gas market in Albania is undeveloped due to a lack of gas distribution infrastructure in the 

country.  From 2000 through 2006, Albanian annual gas production and consumption was held

13
. Existing residential consumers rely on LPG imported from 

Greece.   

 

As of 2008, total proved gas reserves in Albania are estimated at 30.0 BCF (0.8 BCM)
14
. The 

principal source of gas production in Albania is from associated gas from existing oil operations 

in the southern part of Albania.

6.1.1.3  Oil and Gas Pipelines 

 

Since Albania has been isolated from the rest of Europe for many years, the existing oil and gas 

pipelines of Albania do not have connections to international oil and gas pipelines. The domestic 

oil pipelines connect operating oil fields to the existing oil refineries. The limited indigenous gas 

infrastructure in many places is out of operating condition and needs rehabilitation. Some parts 

of the network are unable to transport gas due to their corrosion and destruction. The gas pipeline 

network would need to be totally replaced. 

 

 

 



12/15/09 6-4 Gustavson Associates 

6.1.2 Possible Options to Connect to European Oil and Gas Markets 

 

6.1.2.1 Oil 

 

Manas plans to export their oil to Italy because Italy has seventeen major refineries concentrated 

along the Mediterranean coastline, with a total refining capacity of 2.3 MMBPD (0.31 MMTPD). 

In Albania, there are two ports that could be used for exporting oil from the Manas project, 

Durres and Vlore. 

  

The Porto Romano Jetty, a terminal for importing refined petroleum products and Liquid 

Petroleum Gas (LPG) has been built by Romano Port Sh.a. on the coast in the Duress area. This 

terminal became operational April 2009 and has the capacity for 24,000 cubic meters of liquids 

and is projected to have the capacity for 102,620 barrels (14,000 tonnes) of oil per day and 141.2 

MCF (4,000 cubic meters) of LPG per day. This terminal could be modified to enable oil exports 

from the Manas blocks by tanker from Albania to Italy. Also, there is a proposal for the 

construction of a power plant in the area that would use the imported hydrocarbons or the 

potential production from the Manas concession areas and a proposal for another hydrocarbon 

terminal. 

 

The other potential alternative for exporting oil would be through the Port of Vlore in southern 

Albania also on the Adriatic. This port would be expanded if it becomes the termination point of 

the proposed Albania-Macedonia-Bulgaria (AMBO) oil pipeline. The 570-mile (920 kilometer) 

pipeline would have a capacity of 750,000 BPD (102,320 TPD) (Figure 6-1). 

 

The comparison of these two options for exporting oil showed that the oil terminal at the port of 

Durres is the preferable alternative for Manas because of its proximity to the Manas blocks. 

Therefore, this report assumes that an oil pipeline would be built from the Manas prospects to the 

oil terminal at Durres for sale of produced oil. 

 



12/15/09 6-5 Gustavson Associates 

 

Figure 6-1 Route of Proposed Balkan Oil Pipeline 

 
6.1.2.2 Gas 

 

There is almost no gas infrastructure in Albania. Consequently this will limit the ability to 

market and sell gas in the short term. In fact, the production-sharing contract includes the 

possibility of an extension if gas is discovered.   

 

Gazprom of Russia and Eni, an Italian multinational oil and gas company, have proposed to 

build a 560-mile (900 kilometer) gas pipeline from Russia to southern Europe (Figure 6-2). The 

South Stream pipeline would go under the Black Sea and then continue from Bulgaria through 

Greece to southern Italy with a new major gas hub created in Serbia. The expected annual 

capacity of the southern branch of the gas pipeline is estimated at 333 BCF (10 BCM). 

 

A feasibility study is expected to be completed by the end of 2009. Construction is planned to be 

completed less than three years after approval from the European Union Commission and 

regulatory authorities. Construction of the Serbian stretch is scheduled to start by 2012. 

Deliveries through the South Stream gas pipeline are scheduled to start by 2015. 

 



12/15/09 6-6 Gustavson Associates 

 

Figure 6-2 Proposed Gas Pipelines 

 

For this report, it is assumed that the South Stream gas pipeline would have sufficient capacity to 

accommodate the Manas gas production and Manas would be able to connect to this pipeline 

and, therefore, gain access to the European gas markets. Under these assumptions, Manas would 

build gas pipelines from its prospect area to the southern Albanian border with Greece. 

  

Another potential gas market is domestic gas-fired power generation. Over the past several years, 

Albania has experienced an acute energy crisis with regular power outages throughout the 

country, including the capital city of Tirana. The current hydropower generation capacities are 

insufficient and negatively impact the economic development of the country. Surplus electricity 

might be exported to the EU. This would require improvements to the existing power grid and 

connections to the EU power grid that is another consequence of Albania's lengthy isolation 

from Europe. 

 



12/15/09 6-7 Gustavson Associates 

6.2 OIL AND GAS PRICES 

 

The Client requested that Gustavson Associates use a price of $50.00/Bbl ($366.50/tonne) of oil 

for 2009. As a comparison, on December 15, 2009, Brent 38Âº API oil price was $71.43/Bbl 

($523.58/tonne).  

 

An estimated gas price of $2.50/MCF ($88.29/MCM) is used for 2009. 

 

The Client requested that the pricing for this case be held flat (not escalated) and a Discount 

Factor of 15% be used in order to comply with TSX Policy 5.4 

 



12/15/2009 7-1 Gustavson Associates 

 

7 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

 

7.1 METHODOLOGY 

 

Gustavson Associates built an economic model to estimate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the 

Manas project in Albania. 

 

Two scenarios were considered for this report. Under the first scenario, it was assumed that the 

exploration program would be successful at each one of the three prospects leading to the 

discovery of commercial hydrocarbons. Under the second scenario, it was assumed that the 

exploration program would be a total failure. 

 

The scheduling of exploration and development programs for each prospect within the blocks 

was based on estimates of the time required to drill exploration, appraisal and development wells 

including the time required to move a rig from one location to another and to build surface 

facilities and pipelines. It was assumed that a second rig would be contracted to start the 

development drilling of the first successful prospect after the first successful exploration well 

was drilled.  This report assumes that a maximum of two rigs would be used for this project, 

however; if Manas were successful in discovering hydrocarbons more rigs would be deployed to 

accelerate development. Therefore, the economics or NPV15 in this report are considered to be 

conservative. 

 

The scheduling of the drilling of the development wells would be the basis for determining when 

the field will be ready to start production.  It was assumed that Manas would be able to extend its 

PSC beyond the duration of the 25-year production period specified in the PSC and continue 

operations to at least 2052. 

 

The production schedule within the blocks covered by the PSC was determined with the 

consideration of the economic limit of production; however, the cases as currently evaluated do 

not reach an economic limit before 2052. 

 



12/15/2009 7-2 Gustavson Associates 

 

Production would begin at some fields before development drilling was completed. For each 

prospect, the start date of production would be determined by two factors: (1) after five 

development wells are completed and (2) after the construction of surface facilities was 

completed. To start production at each oil or gas field discovered within the blocks, both 

conditions would have to be met. Thus, in some cases the start of production may have to be 

delayed until the construction of surface facilities was completed at the field, even though five 

wells may have been completed before that time. 

 

For each block, the capital costs included in the model consist of exploration and development 

costs. The exploration costs include the costs of reprocessing seismic data and the costs of 

drilling exploration wells and testing them. The development costs include the drilling, testing 

and completion costs of appraisal and development wells and the costs of field production 

facilities and pipelines.   

 

Separate oil and gas pipelines are assumed to be built with gathering systems for each prospect. 

The length of the oil pipeline is estimated as the distance from the prospects to Durres and the 

length of the gas pipeline is estimated as the distance from the prospects to the southern border 

of Albania with Greece. 

 

The operating costs are made up of two components: cost per well per month and cost per year 

for each field. The capital and operating costs are estimated in 2009 dollars and then escalated. 

 

The estimate of abandonment costs consists of two components: the abandonment costs per 

operating well and the abandonment costs per each successful prospect where a commercial 

discovery of hydrocarbons was made. The abandonment costs in 2009 dollars were escalated to 

estimate the abandonment costs in the nominal dollars of the final years of the project life.   

 

The allocation of abandonment costs is determined according to the rules specified by the PSCs. 

The abandonment costs are accrued 10 years prior to the estimated date of termination of 

production operations or at the end of the year in which cumulative production reached 75% of 

expected recovery of petroleum, whichever occurred first. For this calculation, petroleum is 



12/15/2009 7-3 Gustavson Associates 

 

estimated in barrels of oil equivalent. For each year of the period over which the abandonment 

costs are accrued, the costs are prorated on a unit of production basis over the expected 

remaining recovery of petroleum within the blocks covered by the PSC. 

 

The oil and gas prices in constant 2009 dollars are escalated to determine the oil and gas prices in 

nominal dollars. 

 

All recoverable costs are recovered from the portion of available petroleum production known as 

the total cost recovery petroleum available. It is equal to 100% of the available petroleum 

production after the Government Allocation that is determined according to the rules specified in 

the PSC.  The available petroleum is defined as the wellhead production less shrinkage. 

 

The government's profit share and the contractor's profit share are determined by the fiscal terms 

of the PSC. The R-factor is calculated as the ratio of the contractor's cumulative receipts from 

the Effective Date of the PSC until the end of the preceding calendar year to the estimate of 

contractor's cumulative expenditures incurred from the Effective Date of the PSC until the end 

of the preceding calendar year. 

 

Cumulative receipts consist of the contractor's share of profit petroleum plus the cost recovery 

petroleum less the estimates of Albanian taxes to be paid by the contractor. Cumulative 

expenditures include all costs and expenses that are incurred by the contractor under the PSC. 

The schedule of production bonus payments is based on projections of when the average daily oil 

production would reach the rates specified in the PSC. 

 

The total government's share and the contractor's take were estimated based on the projected 

cash flows. 

 

A discount rate of 15% is used for estimating the NPVs of the exploration and development 

program of the Manas Block 2 & 3 project in Albania in order to comply with TSX Policy 5.4.

7.2 PRODUCTION FORECAST 

 

Oil and gas rates were estimated for an average well based roughly on information regarding 

rates tested at the Occidental Spiragu #1 well, along with variations in most likely average net 

hydrocarbon thickness calculated by dividing the P50 bulk volume values by the area of each 

prospect.  The estimates of initial production rates for all wells are 7,500 BPD (999 Tonnes/D) 

and 7,500 MCF/D (212.4 MCM/D). 

 

The gas rates were estimated based on the oil rates and the average gas/oil ratio (GOR) of about 

1000 SCF/bbl (212.7 CM/tonne) over the field life. This GOR is based on the early test 

information from the Spiragu 1 well in order to reflect the true solution gas content. The GOR 

has been reported as being as high as 2000 SCF/bbl (425.3 CM/tonne) but these values are from 

the end of the test when the near wellbore pressure would have been lower than the reservoir 

pressure. 

 

Hyperbolic decline behavior was assumed as typical behavior of water-drive reservoirs, with 

decline parameters adjusted in order to recover the average P50 reserves per well in a 30-year life.  

Using these initial rates and the exploration and development schedule discussed above, total oil 

and gas rates for each prospect were forecast. Graphs of the success case prospects' forecast rates 

are shown in Section 7.5.   

 

7.3 PRICE FORECAST 

 

The initial prices for oil and gas are discussed above in Section 6.2.  These prices are held flat 

(not escalated) at the Client's request in order to comply with TSX Policy 5.4.

7.4 COST ESTIMATES 

 

7.4.1 Drilling Costs 

 

Several drilling contractors were asked to participate in providing cost estimates for the drilling 

of wells in Albania for the Manas project.  The following equipment specifications were used in 

the well drilling cost estimates: 

 

â€¢ 2,000 horsepower SiliconeControledRectifier rig; 

â€¢ 1,300,000 lb. mast with Midco U-1220-EB (or equivalent) drawworks; 

â€¢ Canrig 650 ton 1165E Top Drive System (or equivalent); 

â€¢ Three 1,600 horsepower Continental Emsco FB-1600 mud pumps (or equivalent); 

â€¢ Power plant of five Caterpillar 3512B engines (or equivalent) with 1,400 horsepower 

each. 

 

Nabors International Drilling was the only United States-based drilling contractor that provided a 

cost estimate. Helmerich & Paine required that a contract be signed before doing any analysis 

work or cost estimating for the project. The Nabors estimate was based on the qualification that 

they would require a year's contract to mobilize a rig to Albania. Helmerich & Paine would have 

similar requirements written into their contract. 

 

The rig proposed to be used for the Manas project by Nabors International Drilling would be the 

Rig 218, which is currently in Dubai, U.A.E.  This rig meets all the specifications listed above, 

and can handle the various total depths of the wells proposed for this project. 

 

For their drilling cost estimate, Nabors assumed 110 drilling days for an exploration well with a 

total depth of 14,764 feet (4,500 meters). Using Nabors' information, Gustavson estimated a cost 

for drilling a 21,325 foot (6,500-meter) well that would take 136 days to drill. With these two 

numbers a linear relationship was developed to estimate costs for wells of various depths (Figure 

7-1). 

 



12/15/2009 7-6 Gustavson Associates 

 

The Client, Manas, requested that Gustavson use the following guidelines. Cost estimates for 

drilling should be based on US$23MM for a well to the depth of 17,388 feet (5,300 meters) and 

US$10MM for a well to the depth of (9,842 feet) 3,000 meters. 

 

For example, based on this relationship, drilling costs for a well with a depth of 17,274 feet 

(5,265 meters) is estimated to be: 

 

$0.001723 MM x 17,274' - $6.9565 MM = $22.8 MM  

$0.005652 MM Ã— 5,265 meters - $6.9565 MM = $22.8 MM 

 

Since each prospect has a different surface elevation as well as estimated depth to the top of the 

reservoir and estimated reservoir thickness, the total depth for the wells in each prospect varies.  

Thus, the cost versus depth relationship can be used to estimate the costs of drilling wells in a 

specific prospect area accounting for the variations in total depth. 

 

A relationship between depth and drill days was also determined for use in project scheduling 

(Figure 7-2).   

 

For example, the number of drill days required to drill a well with a total depth of 17,274 feet 

(5,265 meters) is estimated by using the equation as follows: 

 

0.0041 x 17,274 + 48.344 = 119 drill days 

0.0135 x 5,265 + 48.344 = 119 drill days

These equations were used for each exploration prospect to generate drilling cost and drilling 

time estimates. The development wells are assumed to have a 25% cost savings for potential 

drilling efficiencies that will develop with a better understanding of local drilling conditions. 

These potential cost savings run the gamut of a reduced number of casing strings, to a more 

efficient mud system, to increased penetration rates due to better bit selection, as well as 

elimination of some of the data gathering planned for the exploration wells. The appraisal wells 

costs were calculated using an average of the exploration and development wells costs.   

 

European prices are assumed for the drilling tangibles such as casing, tubing and wellheads. The 

directional equipment, mud and cementing costs are based on USA prices that have had a 

differential multiplier of 1.5 (or a 50% increase) applied to approximate the likely European 

markets.   

 

The cost of mobilization and demobilization, in the success case, of the first rig has been 

allocated as follows; the first prospect absorbs the entire cost of the mobilization of $2,483,000. 

The remaining two prospects split the cost of the demobilization of $2,000,000, so that they were 

allocated $1,000,000 each. Infield rig mobilization was accounted for in the drilling days 

allocated for each well. 

 

Estimated drilling costs by prospect are shown in Table 5-3 above. All drilling and abandonment 

costs were held flat (not escalated). 

 

7.4.2 Other Capital Costs 

 

7.4.2.1 Pipeline Costs  

 

One gas and one oil pipelines were assumed with the oil pipeline extending to Durres, Albania, 

and the gas pipeline extending south to connect to the proposed South Stream gas pipeline at the 

border of Albania and Greece. All pipeline costs and pipeline facilities costs are calculated for 

the model scenario proportionally to the maximum flow rate. Pipeline costs are escalated at 2.2% 

per year. 



12/15/2009 7-10 Gustavson Associates 

 

A cost of $75,000 per inch of pipe diameter, per mile of length was used to estimate pipeline 

costs with an additional cost adjustment factor of 1.3 to adjust for Albania.  For example, the 

costs of building in Albania a 100-mile (161 km) pipeline with a diameter of 20 inches (50.8 cm) 

are estimated as follows:  

 

1.3 x $75,000  Ã—  20"  Ã—  100 miles = $195 MM 

 

The oil pipeline size is based on choosing a diameter large enough for the volume and pressure 

while attempting to keep the fluid velocity between 3 and 15 ft/sec (1 to 5 m/sec)
16
. The sizing of 

gas pipeline diameters was based on a calculation routine using five different industry-accepted 

equations
17
 for gas flow in horizontal pipes that calculates gas flow rates based on gas properties, 

pressure drop, and line diameter and length. Using these methods, tables of required pipeline 

diameter versus required maximum throughput were developed, which were then used as inputs 

into the economic model.  

 

A pipeline length of 53 miles (85 kilometers) was used for estimating oil pipeline costs. For the 

gas pipeline, a pipeline length of 183 miles (295 kilometers) was used for estimating gas pipeline 

costs.  The estimates do not take into account that smaller pipeline diameters would actually be 

required at the furthest points of the system, with line size increasing as various successful 

prospects enter the system; nor do the estimates account for the fact that various portions of the 

pipeline would not be needed, or would need to be larger, depending on which prospects are 

ultimately successful. Thus, the logic used was intended to provide reasonable cost 

approximations, not exact costs or designs.

The pipeline facilities were sized for varying volume throughput. The oil pipeline will require 

pumps, and the gas pipeline will require compressors. Compression and pumping on the 

pipelines must manage the pressure change due to friction and elevation changes. The estimated 

cost for pumps, compressors and ancillary equipment as a function of throughput are presented 

in Table 7-1.  

 

Table 7-1 Estimated Pipeline, Pumps, and Compression Cost Parameters 

 
Oil Gas 

$M/MBPD $M/MTPD $M/MMCFPD $M/MMCMPD 

Costs $3.782 $28.703 $19.950 $704.534 

 

Compression cost estimates have been provided by UE Compression and pump cost estimates 

were provided by Sulzer Pumps in the USA.   

 

Gustavson Associates assumed that natural gas and not electricity would be used as fuel for all 

field and pipeline facilities. 

 

A large amount of horsepower is required to move these volumes of hydrocarbons and this 

accounts for the bulk of the facilities cost. Horsepower requirements are based on an assumption 

of discharge pressure. A discharge pressure of 1,500 psig was used in the compression 

calculations, corresponding with an assumed upstream pressure of the gas pipelines. These fixed 

costs were calculated using a relationship graph that similar to the one used to calculate drilling 

costs and days. A linear relationship was established of cost versus throughput for both oil and 

gas to estimate the numbers presented in Table 7-1. 

 

The summary of pipeline costs for the complete success case is presented in Table 7-2.

7.4.2.2 Surface Facilities Costs 

 

Centralized facilities at each field would allow for the most economic and efficient operation.  

Each field will have separate oil storage tank facilities, high-pressure separators, gas dehydrators, 

and the pumps and compressors necessary to get the product into the pipelines. Gas lift would be 

used as the optimal lifting method for oil wells if they can no longer flow naturally. The 

estimated facility cost, is estimated at $935 per field.  Although water production may eventually 

be likely at these fields, at this time no costs have been included for water disposal wells, water 

storage, or disposal pumps.   

 

Facility abandonment costs of $100,000 per field have been included. All of these costs are held 

flat (not escalated). 

 

7.4.3 Operating Costs 

 

Operating costs are estimated at $10,000 per well per month. Additional field level operating 

costs were estimated at $1,000,000 per field per year. All of these costs are held flat (not 

escalated).

7.5 DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS 

 

7.5.1 Overview 

 

This section presents the results of the economic model created by Gustavson Associates. It is 

important to recognize that these results are a preliminary estimate of the value of the two Manas 

blocks. The actual value will depend on the outcome of the actual exploration programs. The 

economics in the success scenarios may be better than presented here, since it will be possible to 

optimize exploration and development scheduling, and the sizing of facilities in a way that has 

not yet been considered as well as the actual price realized from oil and gas sales. For example, it 

may be desirable to (a) change the sequence in which prospects are explored depending on 

earlier results, (b) order additional rigs, and/or (c) save on capital expenditures by reducing the 

capacity of facilities and pipelines even though this may delay production. 

 

Two scenarios are considered: (1) a complete success scenario in which all three prospects are 

successful, (2) a total failure scenario in which the initial exploratory well drilled on the Spiragu 

and Spiragu South 2 structures are dry-holes, after which there is no further drilling. 

 

A summary of the economic results for the two scenarios modeled is shown in Table 7-5. 

 

As seen in Table 7-5, the NPV15
18
 in the success scenario is estimated to be about $4.7 billion.

 The BOE or Barrels of Oil Equivalent is derived by converting gas to oil in the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of 
gas to one barrel of oil (6 Mcf :1 Bbl). BOEs may be misleading, particularly when used in isolation. A BOE 
conversion, as stated, is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip 
and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. 



12/15/2009 7-14 Gustavson Associates 

 

We estimate the capital expenditures in the total failure scenario will be approximately $53 

million, including dry-hole costs for two exploratory wells and seismic reprocessing costs. 

 

Details of the methodology and assumptions for the scenarios are presented below. 

 

7.5.1.1 Complete Success Scenario 

 

In the complete success scenario all three of the prospects are successful and each of them 

contains oil with associated gas. Based on the relationship between the Total Depth of the wells 

and the drilling time as seen in Figure 7-2, the estimated schedule for exploration and 

development wells based on the use of only two rigs is shown in Table 7-6.

Notice also that production begins at all of the fields before development drilling is completed. 

We assume that production can begin
20
 at a field once 5 wells are completed. This includes the 3 

wells drilled for the purpose of exploration and appraisal. A forecast of the total production for 

this scenario is shown in Figure 7-3. 

 

Oil production rates are estimated to be about 124,000 BPD (16,511 TPD) in 2015, and increase 

to more than 245,000 BPD (32,623 TPD) in 2034 as additional prospects are developed. Gas 

production rates follow a similar pattern. 

 

A summary of the total production by prospect and the capital expenditures for the prospects (in 

constant 2009 dollars excluding pipelines) is shown in Table 7-5.

 In some cases, the start of production may be delayed until the construction of surface facilities is completed at the 
field, even though 5 wells have been completed before that time.

7.5.2 Failure Scenario 

 

If each of the exploration wells in Spiragu and Spiragu South 2 are failures then both blocks 

would be relinquished by Manas. The capital expenditures by prospect in constant 2009 US 

dollars are shown in Table 7-7 below.

We assume that 2-D seismic would be reprocessed over all of the prospects before the results of 

all of the exploration drilling are known, so there is a small expenditure for reprocessing and

interpretation for each field. The total capital expenditure in (nominal) dollars would be about 

$53 million in this scenario.  Exploratory drilling would be completed by about March 2011. 

 

7.5.3 Expected Value Analysis 

 

To complete the economic assessment of the Manas blocks including the consideration of 

potential measures to mitigate the risk, the probability of success for each prospect has to be 

estimated.  These probabilities can be used to weight the NPVs of the various possible outcomes 

to determine the statistical expected value (EV) of the licenses. EV represents the amount that 

the licenses are worth to a risk-neutral investor. With three prospects, each of which can be a 

success or a failure, there are 2
3
 = 8 possible outcomes.  Therefore, determining the EV of Manas 

blocks is a larger task than the scope of this report, and can be undertaken at the Client request. 

  

This economic report has presented the net present value (NPV15) for only two of the eight 

possible outcomes that may occur in the execution of this exploration program. The scenarios 

include complete success and total failure of the first two prospects that will then condemn all of 

the remaining prospects on both blocks.   

 

The NPV15's of these scenarios cover a range of possible values of the exploration program, 

from -$53 million loss in the Total Failure Scenario to +$4.7 billion in the Complete Success 

Scenario.   

 

7.6 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 

 

The results of sensitivity analysis for oil pricing and pipeline costs show the impact on the value 

of the Manas blocks in Albania.  The basic sensitivities related to the possibility of the discovery 

of different types of hydrocarbons as well as the possibility of different success scenarios for the 

exploration program (full success, partial success, or failure) have been addressed in Section 7.5 

and the range of possible outcomes has been presented in Table 7-5. 

 



12/15/2009 7-19 Gustavson Associates 

 

In this section, as an example, the effects of varying several uncertain parameters on the value of 

the partial success oil case of the Manas exploration program are considered. 

 



12/15/2009 7-20 Gustavson Associates 

 

7.6.1 Oil Price 

 

Figure 7-4 shows the effect of changes in the oil price on the value of the Manas blocks.  The 

change in oil price has a significant effect on the value.  A 10% change in oil price results in a 

10% change in the value of the Manas project. 

 

7.6.2 Pipeline Costs 

 

There is considerable uncertainty about the capital cost of the oil and gas pipelines. However, the 

project economics are not sensitive to this cost, due to the cost recovery aspect of the PSC. 

Figure 7-5 shows the effect of changes in pipeline costs on the value of the Manas blocks.   

 

As Figure 7-5 indicates, an increase in pipeline costs causes a very small decrease in the value of 

the Manas project.  However, this declining trend is not consistent for different pipeline costs.  In 

some ranges of pipeline costs, the increase in pipeline costs is offset by the increase in the profit 

share attributable to the Contractor.  This can be explained by the step-type mechanism for profit 

sharing between the Contractor and the Government incorporated in the fiscal terms of the PSCs.

7.7 RISK ANALYSIS 

 

This project, due to the potential reward and multiple opportunities, is very attractive from an 

exploration perspective; however, there is considerable uncertainty about the outcome that may 

occur as a result of the exploration program on the Manas blocks in Albania. The current 

economic report has presented the net present value (NPV15) for only two of these scenarios, 

namely a complete success case and complete failure at the first two prospects which is assumed 

to condemn the remaining prospect. This range of results should be viewed as an indication of 

the uncertainty of the success of the prospects identified within the Manas blocks.   

 

Even though the concession area is fairly close to analogous production, there is significant 

geological and mechanical risk associated with the prospects identified within the Manas blocks. 

The overwhelming risk, in these prospects, is in the interpretation of these complex structural 

plays and the presence of sufficient reservoir quality Ionian carbonate.
