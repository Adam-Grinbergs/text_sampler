NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

ITEM 1 SUMMARY 
1.1 Introduction 
Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) was retained by GrowMax Agri. Corp. (GrowMax) as an independent qualified 
entity to review and report on estimates of Phosphate Mineral Resources and to prepare an NI 43-101 technical 
report for the GrowMax Bayóvar Phosphate Project located in the Piura Region of Peru (Figure 1.1, Project 
Location Map). 

GrowMax, a private company involved in the exploration for near-surface potash, phosphates and other 
minerals, and potential development of a fertilizer project in Peru is owned by Americas Petrogas Inc. (89% 
interest) and the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Co-operative Limited (IFFCO; 11% interest). 

The project property comprises 16 contiguous mining concessions, with the Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 and 
Bayóvar N°8 concessions being the primary focus for phosphate exploration at this time.  The Bayóvar area is 
developing into a significant phosphate mining centre.  Phosphate was initially discovered in the area in 1955 
and the area is currently host to Vale S.A.'s producing Bayóvar Mine as well as phosphate resource and reserve 
evaluation studies by Fosfatos del Pacifico (FOSPAC) and Focus Ventures Ltd. (Focus). 

The phosphate mining and resource evaluation work in the area all focuses on a series of closely spaced beds 
of pelletal phosphate interlayered with diatomite that occur within the Miocene-aged Zapallal Formation.  The 
phosphorite beds are characterized by strong thickness and grade continuity over the extents of the marine 
basin. 

1.2 Project Location and Access 
The GrowMax Bayóvar Project property is situated in Sechura Province of northwestern Peru, approximately 900 
km north of the Peruvian capital city, Lima, and 200 km south of the Ecuador border.  The towns of Sechura and 
Piura are located 65 km and 90 km north of the Project property.   

The GrowMax Bayóvar Project property is transected by a portion of the Virrilá Estuary, connecting Ramón 
Lagoon to the north of the property with the Pacific Ocean to the west.  The Chiclayo-Bayóvar Road occurs 
immediately south of the property, connecting the Pan-American Highway to the east of the property with the 
pacific coast to the west.  A power line right of way and oil and gas pipeline also pass to the south of the 
Property. 

1.3 Property Ownership 
Americas Potash Peru SA ("Americas Potash"), a Peruvian subsidiary of GrowMax, is the title holder of 16 
contiguous mining concessions in the Bayóvar area.  Their main focus is in the exploration and development of 
near surface phosphate and potash brine reservoir and evaporite deposits at the Bayóvar Project in the Sechura 
Desert, northwest Peru. The GrowMax Bayóvar Project that is the subject of this report comprises 72,858 
hectares in three contiguous qualified mining concessions, namely the Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 and Bayóvar 
N°8 concessions.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

1.4 Geological Setting 
The Bayóvar-Sechura phosphate deposit is a sedimentary phosphate deposit.  Typically these deposits are 
stratiform bodies that commonly comprise alternating mineralized and barren zones.  The individual zones can 
range from sub-metre thickness up to tens of metres thick, with the overall thickness of mineralized and barren 
sequence commonly forming in excess of several hundred metres.  The deposits typically cover significant areal 
extents, often extending for tens or hundreds of kilometres in their maximum lateral dimensions. 

Sedimentary phosphate deposits are biochemical in origin, forming in marine sedimentary basins where coastal 
upwelling of nutrient-rich, cold waters interact with the warm nutrient-poor surface seawater layer.  This 
interaction, coupled with significant sunlight interaction aiding the photosynthetic process, creates favourable 
conditions for intense algal bloom. Algal blooms develop as algae multiply at rapid rates in nutrient rich, shallow 
marine environments. 

Multiple cycles of marine regression and transgression and cycles of upwelling activity result in changes in the 
depositional environment and associated biochemical processes occurring within the host marine sedimentary 
basin.  These changes commonly result in the cyclical nature of the deposits, where the deposit comprises a 
series of alternating phosphorite and barren (or non-phosphorite) horizons of varying thickness. 

The phosphate bearing units occur in the upper part of the Miocene (23.22 to 5.33 Ma) strata in the basin, 
primarily within the Zapallal Formation.  The Zapallal Formation comprises a cyclical series of interlayered 
marine basin fill diatomites and phosphorites with lesser sandstone and tuff.  A detailed discussion of the 
Zapallal Formation stratigraphy and structure is presented in the section below. 

The Zapallal Formation is underlain by older Miocene, Oligocene and Eocene age marine basin fill sedimentary 
units. These units unconformably overlay metamorphic and igneous basement rocks of Paleozoic (541 to 252 
Ma) and Precambrian (greater than 541 Ma) age.  As a result of late Eocene basement uplift and basin 
subsidence, the Paleozoic basement is exposed in the Illescas Mountains along the western margin of the basin, 
see Figure 7.1 above. 

The Zapallal Formation is unconformably overlain by Pliocene age interbedded coquina, sandstone and shale.  
The stratigraphy is capped by a thin cover of unconsolidated Quaternary (2.58 Ma to present) age alluvial and 
aeolian sand with localized occurrences of gypsum. 

1.5 Mineralization 
Phosphate mineralization, in the form of beds of phosphorite, and surface brine mineralization containing 
potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, sulfates and bromine are present within the GrowMax Bayóvar Project 
area.  The phosphate mineralization is the focus of this technical report.   

ERCOSPLAN prepared an NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Report in March 2013 on behalf of Americas Potash, 
focusing on evaluation and estimation of its brine Mineral Resource located primarily on the northern section of 
Bayovar 6 (Rauche and van der Klauw 2013). 

The primary phosphate minerals present in most sedimentary phosphate deposits are microcrystalline 
Fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) or Francolite (carbonate-rich Fluorapatite; Ca5(PO4)2.5(CO3)0.5F). The phosphate 
minerals in sedimentary phosphate deposits commonly occur as pellets, oolites, laminae, nodules and fragments 
of teeth, bones or shells.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

Exploration drilling and trenching on the project property has identified 17 laterally correlatable phosphorite beds 
(PH00 through PH16).  The phosphorite beds show good thickness and grade continuity across the concession 
areas.  Grades and thicknesses are consistent with those encountered in other nearby phosphate projects where 
phosphorite beds of the Diana Formation are being explored and or mined. 

The phosphorite beds were intersected in all three areas of drilling within the GrowMax Bayóvar Project area and 
the mineralization can be considered open in several directions given the distribution of the three distinct drilling 
areas within the overall GrowMax property position. 

1.6 Exploration Work 
Trenching and test pit work was conducted on the GrowMax Bayóvar Project during the 2011 and 2012 
exploration programs,  during a 2014 trenching program in the Bayóvar N°6 Concession, and as part of the 2015 
exploration program.  The 2014 trenching has identified continuous intervals of phosphorite ranging from 0.20 to 
1.03 m thick (mean of 0.74 m) returning P2O5 grades ranging from 7.04 to 18.80 wt.% (mean of 14.46 wt.%) at 
or near surface. 

1.7 Drilling 
The only known exploration drilling activity on the GrowMax Bayóvar Project was conducted in 2011 and 2012 
by Americas Potash.  The drilling programs resulted in the completion of 34 drill holes focused in three distinct 
areas within the Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 and Bayóvar N°8 concessions.  All drill holes were drilled vertical 
using a wireline drill rig.  Drill hole total depths ranged from 52 m to 165 m, mean of 110 m.  All drill holes were 
fully cored recovering NTW core (56 mm core diameter). 

The drilling programs were implemented using a nominal drill spacing of 1,000 m in Bayóvar N°7, between 1,000 
to 1,500 m spacing in Bayóvar N°8 and 1,500 to 2,000 m spacing in Bayóvar N°6.  With the exception of 
Bayóvar N°7, this nominal drill hole spacing is consistent with that generally used for defining Inferred Mineral 
Resources in phosphate deposits with similar thickness and grade continuity characteristics.  Additional infill 
drilling will be required to upgrade the resource classification to Indicated and Measured categories across all 
three areas. 

Given the concentrated drilling within the three distinct areas of the GrowMax Bayóvar Project area, a significant 
portion of the project area remains undrilled; given the thicknesses and grades observed in the drilling the 
potential exists that the phosphorite beds will be continuous across these undrilled areas. 

1.8 Sample Chain of Custody 
The GrowMax drill core was stored at a rented secure storage facility in Piura between the completion of the 
drilling programs in 2011 and 2012 and the initiation of the core logging and sampling program in 2014-2015.  
Although Golder cannot speak for the security of the core boxes for the duration of this time the general 
condition of the core and core boxes suggest they were protected from the elements and were held in a secure 
location. 

The logging and sampling of the core took place in 2014-2015.  All drill holes were logged and sampled at the 
Americas Potash office and core facility in Piura by employees of Geominex Consultants Inc. ("Geominex"), a 
third party consulting firm which is independent of GrowMax and Americas Potash.  The core logging and 
sampling was performed using guidelines established by Golder.

All core samples were bagged, sealed and then placed in plastic buckets which were security tagged and 
sealed. Core samples were then transported by Geominex and/or Americas Potash personnel as secured 
shipments to Certimin S.A. in Lima, Peru.  Certimin is an affiliated ISO 9001 laboratory which uses standards for 
phosphate and silica from the Association of Fertilizer and Phosphate Chemists.  

Analytical precision and accuracy was monitored by the insertion of Certimin internal quality controls including 
the insertion of blanks, standards and duplicate and replicate analyses. In addition to internal laboratory controls, 
field Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) measures included during the sampling program by 
Geominex personnel; the field controls included the insertion of blanks, duplicate samples and certified 
standards within the sample stream to allow for monitoring of analytical accuracy and precision. 

1.9 Sampling and Analyses 
The sample selection and sample shipping was performed by Geominex personnel at the Americas Potash core 
facility in Piura between October 2014 and March 2015.  A total of 1,350 half core samples were collected during 
the sampling program, including 560 samples from the 17 correlatable phosphorite beds.  A total of 446 roof and 
floor wing samples were collected in the adjacent diatomite beds for the majority of the sampled phosphorite 
beds to ensure proper grade control on the phosphorite bed contacts and also to provide dilution grade data for 
later studies.  Phosphorite sample interval lengths ranged from 0.13 to 0.60 m (mean of 0.25 m) while wing 
samples ranged from 0.18 to 0.60 m (mean of 0.23 m). 

All samples were shipped to the Certimin laboratory in Lima Peru for grade analyses Phosphorus pentaoxide 
(P2O5 wt.%) and silica analysis were determined by gravimetric processes and major oxides were determined by 
ICP-OES for all phosphorite and diatomite samples submitted for analyses. 

The 2014-2015 sampling program included the monitoring and evaluation of both internal QA/QC controls from 
the lab as well as field quality controls submitted and monitored by Geominex personnel.  The field controls 
included the submission of blind blanks, coarse duplicates and certified reference material standards specific to 
phosphate 

1.10 Geological Model and Resource Estimates 
Golder developed a single 3D geological model for the entire GrowMax Bayóvar Project area (Bayóvar N°6, 
Bayóvar N°7 and Bayóvar N°8 concessions inclusive) using the Ventyx MineScape geological modelling and 
mine planning software package.  Both the stratigraphic and grade components of the geological model were 
developed as gridded surface models using a grid cell size of 20 by 20 m.  The geological model includes an 
undifferentiated overburden unit that overlies a sequence of 17 correlatable phosphorite beds identified as PH00 
through PH16. 

Base data for the geological model included the drill hole data and observations collected by Geominex 
personnel during the logging and sampling and program performed between October 2014 and March 2015.  
The geological database included downhole lithology records from 34 drill holes totaling 3,747 m of core and 
1,349 phosphorite bed and interburden bed analytical samples.  The topographic surface in the geological model 
was developed using data extracted from a 1.5 m cell size digital elevation model. 

Grade data in the geological model, including P2O5 and SiO2 (by gravimetric analyses) and major oxides (by 
ICP-OES analyses) were interpolated for all 17 correlatable phosphorite beds.  As sampling in the interburden 
units was limited to roof and floor wing samples bounding the phosphorite beds, the interburden grade samples 

May 2015 
Report No. 1403265-TR 6  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

were used by Golder to verify phosphorite bed roof and floor picks but the interburden grade data was not 
interpolated into the geological model.   

As reliable density analyses were not available for the Bayóvar Project, Golder applied global default relative 
densities of 1.25 grams per centimetre cubed (g/cm3; dry-basis) and 1.65 g/cm3 (wet basis) to convert estimated 
phosphorite resource volumes to tonnes.  The global default dry and wet bases density values used were 
established based on Golder's experience in similar phosphate deposits both locally and globally. 

As per NI 43-101 guidelines, Golder is reporting only in situ phosphate Mineral Resources as a mine plan, 
processing/metallurgy study, environmental study, economic analysis, marketing analysis, and other modifying 
factor studies have not been completed to a minimum of a Pre-Feasibility level of study as of the effective date of 
the resource estimate.  No minimum thickness, grade cut-off, dilution, recovery or other mining factors have 
been applied to the in situ resource estimate and no Mineral Reserves are being reported at this time. 

Based on an evaluation of the drill hole spacing and geological continuity of the phosphorite beds (both 
thickness and grade parameters were evaluated) Golder has applied a Mineral Resource classification schema 
of 0 to 400 m spacing for Measured Resources, 400 to 800 m spacing for Indicated Resources and 800 to 1,600 
m for Inferred Resources.  Based on this classification scheme there are currently no reportable Measured 
Resources.  Indicated (Bayóvar N°7Concession only) and Inferred (all three concessions) Mineral Resource 
tonnes and grade (mass weighted, dry-basis) are reported in Table 1.1, Summary of Indicated* Mineral 
Resources, All Areas, All Beds, and Table 1.2, Summary of Inferred* Mineral Resources, All Areas, All Beds.  
Detailed results of the Mineral Resource estimate, reported by drilling area and by phosphorite bed, are 
presented in Item 14 of this report. 

The geological model, Mineral Resource estimation and classification of phosphate Mineral Resources will be re-
evaluated once the results of the next phase of resource delineation and in-fill drilling, currently underway, have 
been completed.

1.11 Reserve Estimates 
As of the effective date of this technical report there are no current or historical phosphate Mineral Reserve 
estimates for the GrowMax Bayóvar Project property. 

1.12 Environmental Work 
As of the effective date of this technical report Golder is not aware of any environmental work having been 
undertaken on the GrowMax Bayóvar Project property by current or previous leaseholders. 

1.13 Processing and Development Work 
As of the effective date of this technical report no phosphate processing or development work has been 
undertaken on the GrowMax Bayóvar Project property by current or previous leaseholders. 

1.14 Mining Operations and Production 
As of the effective date of this technical report there has been no commercial phosphate mining production from 
the GrowMax Bayóvar Project property.   

1.15 Conclusions 
The 2014-2015 logging and sampling program was completed successfully and has resulted in the development 
of an initial geological model and maiden phosphate Mineral Resource estimate as reported in this NI 43-101 
technical report.    

The methodologies and procedures used for the collection of the drilling, core logging, sampling and analytical 
data were reviewed in detail by Golder and are deemed to be appropriate for use in the estimation of Mineral 
Resources and for the preparation for this technical report. 

The Diana Formation phosphorite bed thickness and grade parameters and continuity within the GrowMax 
Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 and Bayóvar N°8 concessions are consistent with those being mined at Vale's 4 
million tonnes per year phosphate mine and or evaluated in the adjacent and nearby concessions.  On this basis 
there is a reasonable prospect for extraction; however, as there are no Mineral Reserves currently being 
reported and the bulk of the Mineral Resources being reported fall within the Inferred category additional work is 
required to better understand the prospects for extraction. 

The surface to near surface phosphate mineralization identified in the trench work provides an excellent 
opportunity for easily accessible mineralization with appreciable thicknesses and grades.  There are several 
areas in the central part of the Bayóvar N°7 concession area where the surface to near surface phosphate 
showings correlate to beds PH01, PH02 and PH03 as observed in drilling.  These phosphate showings offer the 
potential for a surface to near surface mining scenario. Further work in this immediate area, including 
mechanical trenching using an excavator, is being recommended during 2015 exploration work on the property 
in order to expand upon this potential opportunity. 

The GrowMax Bayóvar Project requires additional drilling, mostly by drilling of infill drill hole, and analytical work 
to increase the Mineral Resource as well as to increase the level of confidence in the categorized Mineral 
Resources from Inferred to Indicated and Measured categories.

BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

1.16  Recommendations 
The 2014-2015 GrowMax Bayóvar Project logging and sampling program was successful in achieving the goals 
of phosphate mineralization evaluation and initial resource delineation.  In order to advance the project and 
expand the potential Mineral Resources Golder recommends that GrowMax proceed with conducting additional 
exploration drilling on 800 m centres in all three concession areas for the purpose of evaluating the potential to 
expand the estimated Mineral Resources.   

A component of the planned drilling should also focus on infill drilling on 400 m centres within the three 
previously drilled areas for the express purpose of upgrading the existing Indicated Mineral Resources to 
Measured Resources and the existing Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated and or Measured categories of 
Mineral Resources.   

The infill drilling program should also include a minimum of two holes that twin 2011 and 2012 drill holes for the 
purpose of verifying that there have been no material changes to the phosphorite bed analytical results relating 
to the prolonged core storage time prior to sampling and analyses 

In addition to drilling, the lithology and analytical data from additional test pits and trenches located near the 
subcrop of the phosphorite beds should also be evaluated and incorporated into the geological modelling and 
Mineral Resource estimate where appropriate. 

The sampling and analytical program for both the exploration drilling and infill drilling should include a plan for 
collecting reliable moisture and relative density data for both the phosphorite beds and the diatomite beds.  This 
will allow site specific wet and dry density values to be used in the conversion from volumes to tonnes in future 
Mineral Resource estimates. 

Upon completion of the drilling and sampling programs the geological model, Mineral Resource estimate and the 
NI 43-101 Technical Report should be updated with any new results.  As part of the Mineral Resource estimate 
update Golder recommends that the statistical and geostatistical evaluation be revisited once additional drilling 
and analytical data are available to attempt to establish Mineral Resource categorization parameters that 
properly reflect the continuity of the GrowMax Bayóvar Project phosphorite thickness and grade parameters. 

Upon completion of the additional drilling, analytical program and updates to the geological model Golder 
recommends that GrowMax update the Mineral Resource estimates and NI 43-101 Technical Report.  In 
addition, Golder recommends that GrowMax evaluate the project with the intent of advancing it towards a 
Preliminary Economic Assessment and/or a Pre-Feasibility level study, to allow for eventual Mineral Reserves 
estimation and reporting if supported by the findings of modifying factors studies performed at a minimum of a 
Pre-Feasibility level of study.

June 30, 2011) and, 

 Form NI 43-101F1 – Technical Report (effective date June 30, 2011). 

 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM) - Estimation of Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines for Industrial Minerals (May 2003). 

 CIM Definitions Standards (November 2010). 
2.2 Effective Date 
The effective date of this technical report, titled NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Technical Report on the GrowMax 
Bayóvar Phosphate Project, Piura Region, Peru, is March 15, 2015.  The signature and submission date of the 
technical report is May 11, 2015. 

There were no material changes to the scientific and technical information on the GrowMax Bayóvar Phosphate 
Project between the effective date and the signature date of the technical report. 

2.3 Qualified Person and Current Personal Inspection 
The Independent QP responsible for the preparation of the report is Mr. Jerry DeWolfe, P. Geo., Senior 
Geological Consultant at Golder. 

Mr. DeWolfe traveled to the GrowMax Bayóvar Project site and core logging facility in Piura from November 17 
to November 20, 2014 to perform a QP current personal inspection site visit as required under NI 43-101.  
During the site visit the Golder QP reviewed the core logging, splitting, sampling and analytical methods and 
procedures at the core logging and storage facility.  One day was spent at the site verifying the locations of drill 
holes and reviewing the project property geology and access. 

2.4 Sources of Information 
The primary source of information used in the preparation of this Mineral Resource estimate and technical report 
are the data, observations and analytical results collected by GrowMax and their consultants in October 2014 

May 2015 
Report No. 1403265-TR 12  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX

through March 2015.  The drill holes used in the logging, sampling and analyses program were drilled in 2011 
and 2012 and stored in a secure core storage facility prior to commencing with the logging and sampling work in 
October 2014. 

2.5 Note on the Usage of the Term "Ore Zone" in Unit Names 
To avoid confusion with the published literature available for the Bayóvar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit, Golder 
has retained published geological unit naming conventions for the various subdivisions of the Zapallal Formation, 
including the Minerva Ore Zone, Zero Ore Zone and the Diana Ore Zone.  The use of the term "Ore Zone" in 
these unit names is applied solely as a geological unit name and does not imply that technical feasibility and 
economic viability, that should only be attributed to Mineral Reserves, have been evaluated or established for 
said units. 

2.6 Language, Currency and Measurement Standards 
Unless otherwise indicated this technical report uses Canadian English spelling, United States of America dollar 
currency (US$) and System International (metric) units.   

Coordinates in this technical report are presented in metric units metres (m) or kilometres (km) using the 
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection (Zone 17S), World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS1984) datum.  
Elevations are reported as metres above mean sea level (m amsl).   

All references to geological time periods and geological age dates throughout this report are according to the 
nomenclature and dates presented in the 2014 Edition of the International Stratigraphic Chart as prepared by the 
International Commission on Stratigraphy (Cohen et al., 2014).

ITEM 4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
4.1 Location 
The GrowMax Bayóvar Project property is situated in Sechura Province of northwestern Peru, approximately 900 
km north of the Peruvian capital city, Lima, and 200 km south of the Ecuador border (Figure 4.1, Project Location 
Map).  The towns of Sechura and Piura are located 65 km and 90 km north of the Project property.  The 
GrowMax Bayóvar Project area is approximately 40 km by paved multi-lane road from the Sechura Bay on the 
pacific coast where the ports of ports of Bayovar and Piata are located. 

The GrowMax Bayóvar Project property is transected by a portion of the Virrilá Estuary, connecting Ramón 
Lagoon to the north of the property with the Pacific Ocean to the west.  The Chiclayo-Bayóvar Road occurs 
immediately south of the property, connecting the Pan-American Highway to the east of the property with the 
pacific coast to the west.  A power line right of way and oil and gas pipeline also pass to the south of the 
Property. 

The Project property comprises 16 contiguous mining concessions, with the Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 and 
Bayóvar N°8 concessions being the primary focus for exploration at this time.  (Figure 4.2, GrowMax Bayóvar 
Project Concessions Map).   

The GrowMax Bayóvar Project is located approximately 25 km northeast of Vale's operating Miski Mayo surface 
Phosphate Mine which is currently producing approximately 4 million tonnes per year and is scheduled to 
expand (Figure 4.3, Regional Concession Map) and is contiguous with the Fosfatos del Pacifico (FOSPAC) 
phosphate reserve area to the west and the Focus Ventures Ltd. phosphate exploration project to the South.  

The following sections contain information relating to mineral titles, legal agreements as well as permitting and 
regulatory matters in Peru.  The Golder QP is not qualified to verify these matters and has relied upon 
information provided by GrowMax including lease agreements and legal opinions concerning GrowMax's mineral 
and surface rights prepared by Rubio, Leguia and Normand, a Peruvian law firm, for the benefit of GrowMax. 

4.2 Mineral Tenure 
Americas Potash Peru SA ("Americas Potash") is the title holder of the 16 contiguous mining concessions on the 
Bayóvar Project, as shown below in Table 4.1, Americas Potash Peru SA Concessions, and Table 4.2, 
Concession Boundary Coordinates.  Americas Potash operates as a subsidiary of GrowMax Agri Corp. The 
company was founded in 2008 and is based in La Victoria, Peru.  Their main focus is in the exploration and 
development of near surface potash brine reservoir and evaporite deposit at the Bayóvar Project in the Sechura 
Desert, northwest Peru. The Bayóvar Project comprises 90,883 hectares (224,577 acres) of qualified mining 
concessions, and an additional 1,400 hectares in processed or requested concessions.  The Project property 
boundary node coordinates are presented in Table 4.2, Concession Boundary Coordinates.  

In Peru, mining concessions are map-registered using a grid system at the Instituto Geologico, Minero y 
Metalurgico ("INGEMMET") and the Superintendencia Nacional de Registros Publicos ("SUNARP").  
Concessions can be granted for either metallic or non-metallic minerals and allow both exploration and 
exploitation.  Mining concessions are granted for an indefinite period; however, in order to maintain concessions 
in good standing, titleholders must pay a Mining Good Standing license fee equal to US$3.00 per hectare per 
year.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

4.3 Surface Rights 
Under Peruvian law, holding a mining concession does not grant title for surface rights; when surface lands are 
required for the execution of mining activities, mining titleholders must obtain rights over said surface lands by 
acquiring property through a transfer agreement or by executing an easement agreement whereby the 
concessionaire is granted with the right to enter, explore and exploit the concession located under the surface 
rights.  A surface agreement was executed between Americas Potash and Fundacion Comunal San Martin de 
Sechura (the community of San Martin de Sechura) in May 2009.  Under the terms of the agreement Americas 
Potash maintains title by sustaining an annual production target potash product tonnes and by paying a royalty 
of US$33.00 per tonne of potash product sold.  As a result of this agreement Americas Potash has legal rights 
on the surface land over the Mining Concessions in order to conduct mining activities for non-metallic minerals 
(Rubio et al. 2015). 

4.4 Agreements and Encumbrances 
The agreement with Fundacion Comunal San Martin de Sechura, executed on May 7, 2009, is for 30 years, with 
the first four years as an option with an initial payment of $328,000 split into the following annual payments: 

i) $229,600 in year 1 

ii) $32,800 in each of years 2 through 4 

Following year 4, Americas Potash can exercise the option by payment of  

iii) $125,000 plus tax in year 5  

iv) $62,500 in each of years 6 and 7.   

If Americas Potash doesn't exercise this option the contract with Fundacion Comunal San Martin de Sechura 
expires. 

As per the third party legal review (Rubio et al. 2015) there are presently no registered encumbrances for the 
GrowMax Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 or Bayóvar N°8 mining concessions.  

Under the Transfer agreement Americas Potash must respect the right of way for the Panamericana Norte 
highway in the Bayóvar N°6 concession and must respect the right of way for the Nor Peruvian Oil Pipeline in 
the Bayóvar N°8 concession. 

4.5 Mining Royalties and Taxes 
In order to maintain mining concessions in good standing, concession titleholders are required to pay an annual 
Mining Good Standing license fee equivalent to US$3.00 per hectare. 

Under Peruvian mining laws, mining concession holders must reach an annual production of at least US$100.00 
per hectare in gross sales within six (6) years from January 1st of the year following the date the title was 
granted. If there is no production on the concession within that period, the titleholder must pay a penalty of 
US$6.00 per hectare or US$1.00 for small scale miners and US$0.50 for artisan miners, during the 7th through 
11th years following the granting of the concession.  From the 12th year onwards, the penalty is equal to 
US$20.00 per hectare under the general regime, US$5.00 for small scale miners and US$3.00 for artisan 
miners. The titleholder can be exempt from the penalty if exploration expenditures incurred during the previous

year was 10 times the amount of the applicable penalty. Default in payment of the license fees or the penalty for 
two consecutive years will result in the forfeiture of the concession. 

GrowMax, via its Peruvian subsidiary Americas Potash, has a royalty agreement with Activos Mineros SAC 
(AMSAC), a state owned entity responsible for overseeing the development of mining actives in Peru. Under the 
terms of the agreement Americas Potash maintains title by sustaining an annual production target potash 
product tonnes and by paying a royalty of US$33.00 per tonne of potash product sold. This royalty is also 
applicable for any other non-metallic minerals extracted via a simple conversion formula based on relative price.  
The maximum required annual potash production over the next 28 years is 444 metric tonnes. 

4.6 Environmental Liabilities 
Golder is not aware of any environmental liabilities on the GrowMax Bayóvar Project property. 

4.7 Permitting 
The Environmental Regulations for Mining Exploration Projects requires the submittal of an Environmental 
Declaration for projects that include a maximum of 20 drill holes and less than 10 ha of disturbed areas or 
tunnels up to 50 m long; for projects exceeding 20 drill holes, 10 ha of disturbed area or tunneling in excess of 
50 m, a Semi-detailed Environmental Impact assessment is required to be submitted prior to any exploration 
activities. Mining reconnaissance or prospecting does not require an environmental assessment. 

As per Environmental Mining Regulations, the mining concession holder must submit an Environmental Impact 
Assessment once the exploration stage of the project is complete and prior to the commencement of mining 
activities. 

4.8 Other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or 
the right or ability to perform work on the property 

A portion of the GrowMax Bayóvar Project property is included within the proposed conservations areas, known 
as both the Humedales de Sechura and the Humedales de Virrilá – Ramón y Ñapique.  The proposal for a 
regional conservation area, known as the Humedales de Sechura, was submitted to the Piura Regional 
Government in 2010.  In 2011, a second proposal was submitted for a slightly reduced regional conservation 
area, known as the Humedales de Virrilá – Ramón y Ñapique.  As of the effective date of this report, neither of 
the prosed areas has been approved by the Pirua Regional Government.  At present none of the drill holes used 
for the basis of this resource estimate and technical report occur within the either the Humedales de Sechura or 
Humedales de Virrilá – Ramón y Ñapique, and the impact on the current phosphate Mineral Resource being 
reported is deemed by Golder to be minor.   

As of the effective date of this report, Golder and GrowMax are not aware of any indication that either of the 
proposed regional conservation areas will be approved.  Should approval for either the Humedales de Sechura 
or Humedales de Virrilá – Ramón y Ñapique conservation areas, in their present form or some modified version 
thereof, be granted in the future the impact on Mineral Resources, site access, future mine planning activities 
etc. would have to be evaluated.   

Golder is not aware of any other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title or the right or ability to 
perform work on the GrowMax Bayóvar Project property.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

ITEM 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Physiography 
The GrowMax Bayóvar Project area is situated within the Sechura Desert in northwestern Peru.  The Sechura 
Desert occurs as a continuous narrow strip, roughly 2,000 km in length, encompassing much of the Pacific coast 
of Peru.  The desert stretches inland from 20 to 100 km, covering an area of approximately 188,700 km2.  The 
desert slopes gently westward from the foothills of the Andes mountain range to the Pacific coast.  In the 
Bayóvar area the desert is partially bound on the western side by the Illescas Mountains that form the Illescas 
Peninsula on the southern margin of Sechura Bay (Figure 5.1  Regional Physiography). 

The generally featureless, low-relief character of the Sechura Desert (Plate 5.1) is marked in the Bayóvar area 
by several distinct physiographic features, namely the Virrilá Estuary, La Niña Lagoon, the Tablazo and the 
Sechura Depression.  The physiographic features present are a result of combined local uplift and subsidence 
as well as erosional activity. 

 

 

Plate 5.1  Typical landscape on the Bayóvar N°7 Concession 
 

The Virrilá Estuary is a network of shallow channels, extending as much as 30 km inland, which connects 
Sechura Bay on the Pacific Coast with Ramón Lagoon, a large inland lake situated north of the project area.  
The Bayóvar N°7 Concession encompasses much of the estuary in its northeastern half.  During years when the 
region experiences the effects of the oscillating warm ocean currents known as El Niño, the La Niña Lagoon 
wetlands flood and expand in the depression in the centre of Bayóvar N°6 Concession, further connecting the 
Virrilá Estuary and Ramón Lagoon.  While the region is classified as a desert and there is limited year-round 
surface water present, the area is subject to tsunami and flooding associated with weather and seismic events 
occurring along the nearby pacific coast.  The Bayóvar project area was impacted by the floodway associated

with the 1998 El Niño event which saw widespread flooding in the low ground surrounding the Virrilá Estuary and 
La Niña wetlands.  Plate 5.2, below, shows the typical surface characteristics of the southern portion Bayóvar 
N°6 Concession.

Plate 5.3  Surface brine pool on Bayóvar N°6 Concession 
 

The Tablazo (Plate 5.4) is a prominent regional scale flat-topped table land that runs north-south through the 
Bayóvar area, separating a central plateau of higher ground from lower ground to the north, east and west.  The 
steep ridge line marking the edge of the Tablazo ranges in height from 15 to 75 m amsl; elevation on top of the 

May 2015 
Report No. 1403265-TR 23  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

Tablazo ranges from 15 to 75 m amsl compared to 0 to 10 m amsl on the lower plain to the east and 30 to 60 m 
amsl on the low ground to the west that separates the Tablazo from the Illescas Mountains.  The southwestern 
corner of the Bayóvar N°7 Concession straddles the eastern ridge of the Tablazo.  The remainder of the 
GrowMax Bayóvar Project is primarily situated on the low ground to the northeast of the Tablazo. 

 

 

Plate 5.4  Tablazo ridge on the Bayóvar N°7 Concession, looking west-northwest 
 

The Sechura Depression is a steep sided, flat bottomed, topographic depression that transects the Tablazo, 
breaking it into northern and southern regions.  The floor of the Sechura Depression is approximately 35 m 
below mean sea level. The most northern edge Sechura Depression is located approximately 10 km south of 
GrowMax Bayóvar Project. 

Much of the GrowMax Bayóvar Project surface is marked by a thin layer of hard packed sand, thin gravel, 
coquina (Plate 5.5) and localized gypsum, all of which are quaternary in age.  Large crescent shaped barchan 
sand dunes that slowly migrate across the property in a north-easterly direction are present in the southern part 
of the project area but are less abundant in the northern part of the project area.

5.2 Climate 
The GrowMax Bayóvar Project area is situated in the Sechura Desert.  The Sechura Desert climate is heavily 
influenced by the confluence of the Humboldt (cold water) and Equatorial (warm water) ocean currents that 
circulate in contrary directions; this typically results in zones of high temperature and low precipitation. 

A summary of the historical climate data for the project area, sourced from the Sechura, Peru weather station 
data as compiled on the www.weatherbase.com website, is presented in Figure 5.2, Historical Sechura-Bayóvar 
Area Climate Data.  Data was collected over a 30 to 112 year period, with the bulk of the data records going 
back 112 years.

5.3 Accessibility 
The GrowMax Bayóvar Project is accessible year round via a series of multi-lane sealed roads and highways 
(Figure 5.3, Regional Access).  The Pan-American Highway transects the eastern side of the property and the 
Chiclayo-Bayóvar road (Plate 5.8) crosses just south of the Bayóvar N°7 and Bayóvar N°8 concession 
boundaries.  A network of un-maintained drill roads provides four wheel drive vehicle access to the remainder of 
the property. 

 

 

Plate 5.8  Chiclayo-Bayóvar Road to the south of Bayóvar N°7 Concession 
 

Travel time from Piura to the GrowMax Bayóvar Project is approximately 1.5 hours by car via the Pan-American 
Highway.  Piura is serviced by a modern domestic airport with commercial daily service to Lima and other 
airports in the region.  Air travel flying time from Piura to Lima is approximately 1.5 hours. 

 

5.4 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
The GrowMax Bayóvar Project area is approximately 40 km by paved multi-lane road from the fishing village of 
Puerto Rico, located on Sechura Bay on the pacific coast where the ports of ports of Bayovar and Piata are 
located.  Several port facilities for loading of dry bulk materials are situated adjacent to the village of Puerto Rico, 
including the Vale port facility where phosphate from Vale's Miski Mayo operation (Bayóvar Mine) is loaded for 
shipping. 

Power transmission lines for the Vale Bayóvar Mine transect the very southeast corner of the Bayóvar N°8 
concession.  Power transmission lines also transect the Nuevo Bayóvar 8, Nuevo Bayóvar 9, Nuevo Bayóvar 10, 
Nuevo Bayóvar 11 and Nuevo Bayóvar 12 concessions along the Pan-American Highway (Figure 5.3, Regional

Access).  A pipeline right of way crosses through the Nuevo Bayóvar 17 concession and across the very 
southeast corner of the Bayóvar N°8 concession. 

Potential future mining operations at the GrowMax Bayóvar Project could be conducted year-round and would 
not be affected by the climate.   

Infrastructure and facilities studies have not been performed to date on the project.  However, it is expected that 
given the current foot print of the Mineral Resource and the extent of the overall GrowMax Bayóvar Project limits, 
there would be sufficient surface rights for potential mining operations, potential tailings storage areas, potential 
waste disposal areas and potential processing plant facilities.  Likewise, it is anticipated that there would be 
sufficient site access, power and water to support the potential GrowMax operations.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

ITEM 6 HISTORY 
6.1 Ownership History 
Golder did not establish the historical land tenure boundaries for the various past concession titleholders in the 
region.  As a result, it is possible that a portion or all of the current GrowMax Bayóvar Project property area may 
have been included in the land holdings of some of these historical titleholders in the Bayóvar-Sechura 
Phosphate deposit.  

6.2 Exploration History 
The phosphate mineralization in the Bayóvar-Sechura region was first discovered in 1955 during oil and gas 
exploration drilling.  There are no direct records of historical phosphate exploration on the GrowMax Bayóvar 
Project property prior to the transfer agreement with Americas Potash in 2009. 

There has been a long history of salt brine and potash exploration and development on the GrowBax Bayóvar 
Project concessions, as detailed in the 2013 NI 43-101 Technical Report prepared by ERCOSPLAN for 
Americas Petrogas (Rauche and van der Klauw 2013).   

The historical Ramon and Zapayal mineral concessions (Figure 6.1  Historic Mineral Concessions) are almost 
entirely encompassed by the GrowBax Bayóvar Project concessions.  The Ramon concession is contained 
within the present Bayóvar N°6 concession, and the Zapayal concession within the Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 
and Bayóvar N°8.  Only a small portion of the historically defined Zapayal concession is not included within the 
GrowMax Bayóvar Project boundaries, therefore a Mineral Resource estimate for the historical Ramon and 
Zapayal Reservoirs provides a good comparison of the brine Mineral Resources within the GrowMax Bayóvar 
Project. 

The potash exploration in the Ramon and Zapayal mineral properties was initially connected to exploration 
efforts for phosphate resources.  Historical work on the GrowMax Bayóvar Project included considerable drilling 
and coring of wells, sampling, geophysical surveying and construction of a pilot plant utilizing solar evaporation 
processing which resulted in the production of high quality potassium chloride (i.e. potash fertilizer).  A brief 
summary of the historic exploration activity is outlined below in Table 6.1.

Table 6.1: Brief History of Potash Exploration and Development on the GrowMax Bayóvar Project 
(Rauche and van der Klauw 2013) 
Year Description 

1958 
Minerales del Perú S.A. (MIDEPSA) who later found Compañía de Minas Jorge Alterto S.A. 
discovered salt solutions in low depths. An analysis of these solutions showed potassium salt 
contents. Exploration works were carried out by a number of USA based consultants. 

1959 Foundation of several associated companies for further development of the deposit. Compilation of different studies by independent consultants or consulting companies. 

1962 Minera Bayóvar S.A., Piura, Peru took over the concession areas and explored the Sechura deposit until 1968 

1964 Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical acquired the concession areas and continued tests of the solar evaporation plant erected by Minera Bayóvar S.A. 

April 1972 Mining rights were deprived due to not meeting valid legal obligations 

July 1972 Concessions were granted to Minera del Peru with the obligation to develop and exploit the deposit 

1981 Finalization of a pre-feasibility study for the potash project 

1981 to 2005 Minero Peru operated a small-scale phosphate plant to supply the Peruvian and New Zealand markets. 

2005 The phosphate concessions were separated from the potash concessions and granted to Companhia Vale do Rio Doce to develop the phosphate project. 

2008 The potash concessions were opened for bids and Americas Petrogas Inc. was awarded the surface mining rights.

ITEM 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
7.1 Regional Geology 
7.1.1 Regional Stratigraphy 
The following section summarizes the regional geology as presented by McClellan (1989), Cheney et al., (1979) 
Bech (2009) and references therein. 

The Bayóvar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit is located in the Sechura Basin, a shallow north trending basin 
situated in northwestern Peru.  Figure 7.1, West to East Chronostratigraphic Cross-Section through the Sechura 
Basin (INGEMMET, 1980), shows a west to east stratigraphic cross-section through the Sechura Basin.  The 
Sechura Basin is bounded by the Illescas Mountains to the west and the foothills of the Andes Mountains to the 
east (Figure 7.2, Regional Geology Map).  The basin is filled by a thick sequence, in excess of 200 m, of 
interlayered marine sediments including phosphorite, diatomite, sandstone, shale and occurrences of volcanic 
tuff, ranging in age from Eocene (56.0 to 33.90 Ma) at the base to Pliocene (5.33 to 2.58 Ma) in the upper basin.   

 

 
Figure 7.1: West to East Chronostratigraphic Cross-Section through the Sechura Basin (INGEMMET, 1980) 

The Sechura basin was formed as a result of subsidence along the paleo-continental shelf.  Cycles of uplift and 
subsidence modified the basin during its long depositional history, with basement faults partially controlling basin 
geometry during deposition.  The stratigraphy is subhorizontal, dipping gently at 2° to 3° across the basin. 

A period of marine transgression into the basin, as evidenced by the clay facies typically found at the base of the 
Zapallal formation, began in the early Miocene.  Coastal upwelling along the paleo-continental shelf brought 
warm, nutrient poor shelf waters into contact with cold, nutrient-rich, deep ocean waters, resulting in favourable 
conditions for algal blooms.  The presence of rounded pellets and oolites in sedimentary sequence, indicate that 
there was a degree of transportation prior to deposition. 

The phosphate bearing units occur in the upper part of the Miocene (23.22 to 5.33 Ma) strata in the basin, 
primarily within the Zapallal Formation.  The Zapallal Formation comprises a cyclical series of interlayered

marine basin fill diatomites and phosphorites with lesser sandstone and tuff.  A detailed discussion of the 
Zapallal Formation stratigraphy and structure is presented in the section below. 

The Zapallal Formation is underlain by older Miocene, Oligocene and Eocene age marine basin fill sedimentary 
units. These units unconformably overlay metamorphic and igneous basement rocks of Paleozoic (541 to 252 
Ma) and Precambrian (greater than 541 Ma) age.  As a result of late Eocene basement uplift and basin 
subsidence, the Paleozoic basement is exposed in the Illescas Mountains along the western margin of the basin, 
see Figure 7.1 above. 

The Zapallal Formation is unconformably overlain by Pliocene age interbedded coquina, sandstone and shale.  
The stratigraphy is capped by a thin cover of unconsolidated Quaternary (2.58 Ma to present) age alluvial and 
aeolian sand with localized occurrences of gypsum.

7.1.2 Zapallal Formation Detailed Stratigraphy 
The Zapallal Formation is subdivided into four members, which are in turn subdivided into distinct units or zones 
(Figure 7.3, Zapallal Formation Stratigraphic Column).  The formation and its subdivisions, presented from oldest 
to youngest, are as follows: 

 Lower Diatomite and Phosphorite Member 
 Tuffaceous Diatomite – Thickness is in excess of 50 m, predominantly foraminifera-rich diatomite with 

numerous thin beds of tuff and three isolated phosphorite beds; P2O5 grades in the phosphorite beds 
range from 10 to 18 wt.% and from 1 to 3 wt.% in the diatomite.  The upper contact is gradational with 
the overlying Diana Ore Zone (note: please refer to Item 2.5 of this technical report concerning the 
usage of the term "Ore Zone"). 

 Diana Ore Zone – Mean thickness of 39 m (range of 36 to 41 m). The zone is subdivided into seven 
regionally correlatable phosphorite beds alternating with diatomite beds. The Diana Ore Zone contains 
the highest P2O5 grades (ranging from 10 to 25 wt.% in the phosphorite beds and 3 to 7 wt.% in the 
diatomite beds) and is the thickest phosphorite bearing zone in the Bayóvar-Sechura Phosphate 
deposit. The upper contact is gradational with the overlying Grey Tuff.   

 Grey Tuff – Thickness ranges from 0 to 21 m. Comprises generally massive beds of soft grey 
diatomaceous tuff.  Preservation of the unit varies across the area due to variable and locally significant 
erosion by the overlying Clam Bore Sandstone.  It is thickest in the northwestern part of the western 
Sechura Depression, and thins westward, southward and eastward.  There are no identified or 
correlatable phosphorite beds present within the unit and no significant presence of phosphate pellets, 
resulting in negligible P2O5 grades. The upper contact with the overlying Clam Bore Sandstone is 
marked by a hiatus and angular unconformity; units below the unconformity dip to the east while units 
above dip to the southeast. 

 Clam Bore Sandstone Member – Thickness ranges from 0 to 23 m; the unit is thinnest in the southern 
portion of the basin and thickest in the north and western portions of the basin.  Comprises fine to medium 
grained quartz sand with abundant trace fossils across most of the basin; in areas where the unit is thicker, 
such as in the vicinity of the Tablazo, the upper portion of the unit comprises a limestone coquina (oyster 
bank). The upper contact is gradational with the overlying Zero Ore Zone. 

 Upper Diatomite and Phosphorite Member 
 Zero (or Cero) Ore Zone – Mean thickness of 6 m (range of 3 to 11 m). Comprises a single thick poorly 

sorted coarse grained phosphorite bed (the Zero Bed) and is overlain by diatomite; P2O5 grade in the 
Zero Bed can be up to 18 wt.%, with a mean P2O5 grade of 9 wt.% over the entire zone (phosphorite 
and overlying diatomite). The upper contact is gradational with the overlying Inca Diatomite. 

 Inca Diatomite – Mean thickness of 10 m (range of 5 to 17 m).  Comprises massive beds of diatomite 
with minor pellets but no distinct or correlatable phosphorite beds; P2O5 grade ranges from 1.0 to 2.8 
wt.% throughout the unit. The upper contact is gradational with the overlying Minerva Ore Zone. 

 Minerva Ore Zone – Mean thickness of 26 m (range of 23 to 35 m).  Comprises two to three 
phosphorite beds interlayered with diatomite; overall P2O5 grade in the phosphorite beds is lower than

those in the other zones with grades generally in the 5 to 6 wt.% range although in areas where the unit 
thins there is often an associated increase in P2O5 grade, with values in the 8 to 10 wt.% range.  
Grades in the diatomite beds range from 2 to 3 wt.% P2O5. Though the overall composition is fairly 
constant, in general the phosphorite beds thin and the diatomite beds thicken from west to east across 
the deposit.  The upper contact is gradational with the overlying Quechua Diatomite. 

 Quechua Diatomite – Mean thickness of 17 m (range of 12 to 19 m). Comprises massive beds of 
diatomite with localized occurrences of one or two thin phosphorite beds.  Grade across the unit 
(diatomite and localized phosphorite inclusive) is typically 2 wt.% P2O5. The upper contact is gradational 
with the overlying Barren Diatomite Member. 

 Barren Diatomite Member – Thickness range of 0 to 31 m.  Is comprised of massive diatomite with common 
mica flakes. There are no identified or correlatable phosphorite beds present within the unit and no 
significant presence of phosphate pellets, resulting in negligible P2O5 grades.  The upper contact is marked 
by a hiatus and angular unconformity separating the Miocene Zapallal Formation from overlying Pliocene 
sandstone and shale; units below the unconformity dip to the southeast while units above are horizontal.

7.1.3 Regional Structure 
As identified in the detailed discussion of the Zapallal Formation, there are two regional scale angular 
unconformities identified as impacting the stratigraphy in the basin. The uppermost unconformity occurs at the 
top of the Zapallal Formation (Figure 7.3, Zapallal Formation Stratigraphic Column), marking the contact 
between Barren Diatomite of Miocene age and coquina, sandstone and shale of the overlying Pliocene 
sedimentary units.  The second unconformity occurs within the Zapallal Formation, marking the contact between 
the Lower Diatomite and Phosphorite Member and the Clam Bore Member. 

There are isolated occurrences of regional scale faulting and folding in the basin, including a regional scale fault, 
known as the Tablazo Fault, which transects the FOSPAC Bayóvar 9 concession to the southwest of the 
GrowMax Bayóvar Project.  However, beyond the Tablazo Fault, the stratigraphy has seen minimal post-
depositional tectonic modification. 

7.2 Phosphorite and Diatomite Composition 
7.2.1 Phosphorite 
The phosphorite beds are comprised primarily of massively bedded phosphate pellets with lesser grains and 
fragments of diatoms, volcanic glass; sodium, potassium and magnesium salts; quartz; feldspar; sponge 
fragments; gypsum, mica flakes and organic matter.  The phosphate is marine in nature and is generally in the 
form of fluorhydroxycarbonate apatite. 

The apatite is generally in the form of individual pellets although agglomerations of pellets, oolites, laminae, 
nodules and fragments of teeth, bones or shells are also present.  The pellets are generally subrounded but 
elongated and irregular shaped pellets also present.  The pellet grain size ranges from 0.4 to 2.0 mm in 
diameter, with larger pellets occurring in the phosphorite beds while finer grained pellets occur in the diatomite.  

The pellets range in colour from white to brown to black.  Although the apatite pellets and other grains and 
fragments are generally well sorted within the beds, most of the pore space is filled in with fine fragments of 
diatoms and silt. The specific gravity of individual pellets is typically around 2.9. 

7.2.2 Diatomite 
The diatomite beds are comprised primarily of massively bedded aggregates of microscopic diatom fragments 
with variable finer grained apatite pellets and lesser grains and fragments of volcanic glass, shell and bone 
fragments and sponge fragments.  The diatoms are typically composed of opaline silica. 

The diatomite ranges in colour from white to brown to olive green.  The diatomite generally has high porosity, 
often on the order of 90%; as a result of this and its resistance to compaction, the specific gravity is very low, 
typically around 0.5.  

7.3 Property Geology and Mineralization 
The Zapallal Formation stratigraphy dips gently to the east within the Bayóvar N°6 and Bayóvar N°7 concessions 
and the northern portion of the Bayóvar N°8 Concession (Figure 7.4, Local Geology Map).  In the most 
southeasterly corner of the Bayóvar N°8 Concession, the Zapallal formation generally dips towards the west, as 
the sediments appear to have been deposited onto a basement high.  No faulting or folding was identified within 
the concession.  Interpretation of the 2011 and 2012 GrowMax exploration drilling in the southern portion of the 
Bayóvar N°6 Concession, southwestern corner of the Bayóvar N°7 Concession, southeastern corner and

northern half of the Bayóvar N°8 Concession, indicated that the following stratigraphic units (from top 
downwards) were intercepted on the property (Table 7.1):

To facilitate modelling of the deposit, the overburden units, as indicated in the above Table 7.1 with OB, 
regardless of suspected age or formation, were grouped and modelled together.  Any units intercepted below the 
Diana Ore Zone were grouped as underburden. 

The uppermost members of the Zapallal Formation are not present at the Bayóvar N°7 Concession, as the Diana 
Ore Zone lies very near to surface.  At this stage, Golder is unable to definitely say whether the uppermost 
members of the Zapallal Formation, namely the Upper Diatomite and Phosphorite Member, including the Zero 
and Minerva Ore Zones, and the Barren Diatomite Member, were intercepted in Bayóvar N°6 and Bayóvar N°8 
concessions. Further drilling and detailed logging would be required to define these upper units.  As mentioned 
previously, all units intercepted above the Diana Ore Zone were grouped as undifferentiated overbuden.   

GrowMax has intercepted 17 distinct and correlatable phosphorite beds (identified as PH00 through PH16) 
across the project area.  GrowMax and Golder have interpreted the upper 14 phosphorite beds (PH00 to PH13) 
as Diana Ore Zone beds with the lower three beds (PH13 to PH16) interpreted as phosphorite beds occurring in 
the underlying Tuffaceous Diatomite unit.   

The literature on the Bayóvar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit generally identifies seven regionally correlatable 
phosphorite beds in the Diana Ore Zone; however, GrowMax and Golder interpret the seven additional 
phosphorite beds encountered in the Diana Ore Zone as locally continuous and correlatable beds that aren't 
necessarily present or correlatable across the entire basin.  Summary thickness and P2O5 grade statistics for the 
phosphorite are presented in Table 7.2, Phosphorite Bed Thickness and P2O5 Grade Summary Statistics.  
Summary thickness and P2O5 grade statistics for the diatomite beds are presented in Table 7.3, Diatomite Bed 
Thickness and P2O5 Grade Summary Statistics.

ITEM 8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
8.1 Genetic Model 
The following section summarizes the deposit type and genetic model as presented by Simandl et al. (2012), 
Mosier (in Cox and Singer, 1992), Garrison (1992), Follmi (1996) Froelich et al. (1988), and Cheney et al. 
(1979). 

The Bayóvar-Sechura phosphate deposit is a sedimentary phosphate deposit.  Typically these deposits are 
stratiform bodies that commonly comprise alternating mineralized and barren zones.  The individual zones can 
range from sub-metre thickness up to tens of metres thick, with the overall thickness of mineralized and barren 
sequence commonly forming in excess of several hundred metres.  The deposits typically cover significant areal 
extents, often extending for tens or hundreds of kilometres in their maximum lateral dimensions.  

Sedimentary phosphate deposits are biochemical in origin.  The formation of sedimentary phosphate deposits 
has occurred throughout geological time, from as far back as the Proterozoic (2,500 to 542 Ma) to the present 
day sedimentary phosphate deposits currently forming off the coast of Peru (Froelich et al., 1988).  On the basis 
of stratigraphy the Bayóvar-Sechura Phosphate deposit formed during the middle Miocene with the bulk of the 
phosphate deposition occurring between 8.5 to 7 Ma (Garrison, 1992). 

Both paleo and modern sedimentary phosphate deposits typically develop in marine sedimentary basins that 
occur along passive continental margins.  Conditions favourable for the depositional and biochemical process 
are found in areas of warm paleoclimate (or current climate for modern day equivalents), typically occurring 
between the 40th parallels at the time of deposition.  The water depth at time of deposition and biogenic activity 
can range from 40 m to in excess of 300 m. 

Sedimentary phosphate deposits form in marine sedimentary basins where coastal upwelling of nutrient-rich, 
cold waters interact with the warm nutrient-poor surface seawater layer.  This interaction, coupled with significant 
sunlight interaction aiding the photosynthetic process, creates favourable conditions for intense algal bloom. 
Algal blooms develop as algae multiply at rapid rates in nutrient rich, shallow marine environments.  During algal 
blooms the algae biomass increases significantly as algae multiply.  The combination of high biomass and rapid 
multiplication of the algae often leads to toxic and/or anoxic conditions that prove fatal to both algae and other 
marine organisms.  

Cycles of algal bloom and death lead to significant seafloor accumulation of organic phosphate released by the 
algae along with accumulation of skeletons, scales, fecal pellets and other organic debris from algae and other 
marine life forms.  The process of phosphogenesis occurs during decomposition of the phosphate bearing 
organic debris by bacteria along with the dissolution of fish bones and scales.  This results in the precipitation of 
phosphate minerals in an anoxic environment within the unconsolidated seafloor sediment near the sediment-
water interface. 

Multiple cycles of marine regression and transgression and cycles of upwelling activity result in changes in the 
depositional environment and associated biochemical processes occurring within the host marine sedimentary 
basin.  These changes commonly result in the cyclical nature of the deposits, where the deposit comprises a 
series of alternating phosphorite and barren (or non-phosphorite) horizons of varying thickness.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

The primary phosphate minerals present in most sedimentary phosphate deposits are microcrystalline 
Fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) or Francolite (carbonate-rich Fluorapatite; Ca5(PO4)2.5(CO3)0.5F). The phosphate 
minerals in sedimentary phosphate deposits commonly occur as pellets, oolites, laminae, nodules and fragments 
of teeth, bones or shells. 

The host rocks and the barren horizons within the sedimentary phosphate deposits are most commonly 
diatomite although mudstone, marl, limestone, volcanic ash and sandstone are also known to occur depending 
on changes in the depositional environment and sediment input within the basin.

ITEM 9 EXPLORATION 
9.1 Summary of Non-Drilling Exploration Activity 
During the 2011 and 2012 GrowMax exploration programs trenches and test pits were hand dug in the Bayóvar 
N°6 and Bayóvar N°8 concession areas.  According to project personnel involved at the time the trenches and 
test pits did encounter near surface phosphorite beds; however, no detailed descriptions or logs of these 
excavations were recorded and no sample collection or analytical work was performed using material from the 
excavations. 

In 2014 Geominex personnel hand dug a series of trenches which measured approximately 2 by 2 m in size and 
varied up to 1.64 m in depth for the purpose of evaluating the near surface phosphorite potential in the Bayóvar 
N°6 Concession.  A total of 72 samples were collected from 16 locations as shown in Figure 9.1  GrowMax 
Surface Trenches and Test Pits.  The samples obtained were from a series of exposed manually dug surface 
trenches. All trenches tested a series of surface to near-surface flat-lying phosphate beds within a sequence of 
diatomite, sandstone and fossil debris. Where a sample could not be obtained due to collapsed trench walls, a 
random grab sample of material from a surface pile was taken.   

All samples were placed in plastic sample bags, tagged and then placed in security-sealed bags. Samples were 
accompanied by Geominex employees from site to Certimin Laboratories in Lima for analysis. Phosphorous is 
determined by gravimetric methods. Major oxides are determined by ICP OES, and silica by gravimetric 
analysis. Multielemental analysis was determined by ICPMS.   

The trenching program demonstrated the presence of near surface phosphorite of appreciable thicknesses and 
grades.  A summary of the 2014 trench sample results are presented in Table 9.1, Summary of Results from the 
2014 Bayóvar N°6 Concession Trench Sampling Program.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

The 2015 GrowMax exploration program that is currently underway includes a mechanical test pit program, 
including collection of near surface phosphorite bed samples for phosphate grade analyses; the results of these 
test pits will be included in future updates to the geological model and resultant resource estimates. 

No other surface sampling or geophysical programs have been completed on the Project property as of the 
effective date of this report. 

9.2 Digital Surface (Topography) Model 
A digital surface model (DSM) covering the bulk of the Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 and Bayóvar N°8 concessions 
was prepared for GrowMax by PhotoSat Information Ltd. (PhotoSat) of Vancouver Canada during August 2014.   

The DSM source data used by PhotoSat was 1.5 m SPOT6 tri-stereo satellite imagery sourced in December 
2013.  Coverage for the DSM is shown in Figure 9.2  GrowMax Bayóvar Digital Surface Model Extents.  The 
DSM is gridded on a 3 by 3 m grid and elevation accuracies of 2 m or better.  Unlike a Digital Elevation Model 
(DEM), the DSM has not been filtered to remove vegetation or buildings; however, given the limited, low 
vegetation and the absence of buildings across the study area this is not considered to be an issue. 

Although entirely appropriate for the purpose of exploration and Mineral Resource modelling and estimation, it is 
recommended that as the project advances into engineering studies in the future, GrowMax should source a 
topography model with increased elevation accuracy.

ITEM 10 DRILLING 
10.1 Drilling Summary 
The only known exploration drilling activity on the GrowMax Bayóvar Project was conducted in 2011 (15 drill 
holes) and 2012 (19 drill holes) by Americas Potash.  The drilling programs resulted in the completion of 34 drill 
holes focused in three distinct areas within the Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 and Bayóvar N°8 concessions.  All 
drill holes were drilled vertically using a wireline drill rig.  Drill hole total depths ranged from 52 m to 165 m, mean 
of 110 m.  All drill holes were fully cored recovering NTW core (56 mm core diameter).  A summary of the 2011 
and 2012 drilling programs is presented in Table 10.1, 2011 and 2012 GrowMax Drill Hole Summary, below. 

The drilling programs were implemented using a nominal drill spacing of 1,000 m in Bayóvar N°7, between 1,000 
to 1,500 m spacing in Bayóvar N°8 and 1,500 to 2,000 m spacing in Bayóvar N°6.  With the exception of 
Bayóvar N°7, this nominal drill hole spacing is consistent with that generally used for defining Inferred Mineral 
Resources in phosphate deposits with similar thickness and grade continuity characteristics.  Additional infill 
drilling will be required to upgrade the resource classification to Indicated and Measured categories across all 
three areas. 

Given the concentrated drilling within the three distinct areas of the GrowMax Bayóvar Project area, a significant 
portion of the project area remains undrilled; given the thicknesses and grades observed in the drilling the 
potential exists that the phosphorite beds will be continuous across these undrilled areas.

10.2 Drilling Results 
The 2011 and 2012 drilling programs completed 34 drill holes, of which, 32 intercepted the majority of the target 
phosphorite sequence.  Only one drill hole, APH_19, failed to intercept any phosphorite or diatomite beds.  The 
correlated intercepts are based on the sampled intervals and the corresponding P2O5 grade.  As the GrowMax 
drill holes were not continuously sampled through the target phosphorite sequence, it is possible that in 
instances where beds appear to have not been intercepted, it is possible they may have been missed during 
sampling, and may be present in the drill hole.  This is based on the assumption that the Bayóvar-Sechura 
phosphate deposit exhibits stratigraphic continuity across much of the deposit.   

A summary of the intercepts correlated in each drill hole is presented in Table 10.2: Summary of Phosphorite 
Intercepts by Drill Hole and by Concession.

In the Bayóvar N°7 Concession drill holes, phosphorite beds PH01 through PH14 were intercepted, with the 
target sequence of 14 phosphorite beds spanning a total mean thickness of 52 m (range of 33 to 64 m) including 
interburden diatomite beds.  The Diana Ore Zone is relatively close to the surface over this portion of the 
Bayóvar N°7 Concession, with the depths from ground surface to the roof of the upper most phosphorite bed 
(PH01) ranging from 5 m beneath the Virrilá Estuary erosional feature to 39 m below the surface on the Tablazo.  
The floor of the lower most phosphorite bed (PH14) ranged from 5 m beneath the Virrilá Estuary erosional 
feature to 85 m below surface in the Tablazo area.  

In the Bayóvar N°6 and Bayóvar N°8 concessions sampling of the drill holes was less continuous than in 
Bayóvar N°7.  This resulted in fewer intercepts of the entire target sequence PH00 through PH15, and more 
extrapolation through the drill holes during correlation.  In the holes that did intercept the majority of the 16 
phosphorite beds, the mean thickness of the target sequence, including interburden diatomite beds is 58 m 
(range of 38 to 82 m).  The depths to the roof of the uppermost phosphorite bed (PH00) varied across the two 
concessions from west to east and north to south, based on the overall dip of the sequence.  In the northern 
portion of Bayóvar N°8 and southern portion of Bayóvar N°6 the depths to PH00 ranged from 53 m in the west to 
97 m in the east.  The lowest most phosphorite bed (PH16) was intercepted only once in APH_02, at a depth of 
132 m.  The next lowest phosphorite bed (PH15) ranged in depth from 129 m in the west to 143 m in the east on 
the concession. 

In the southeastern corner of the Bayóvar N°8 Concession, there is a local basement high and the general dip of 
the beds appears to be towards the west. There was only one intercept of the uppermost phosphorite bed, 
PH00, in drill hole APH_03, at a depth of 109 m.  The depths to the floor of the lowest correlatable phosphorite 
bed, PH16, ranged from 147 m to 156 m depending on the location of the drill hole on the basement high.  Due 
to the lack of drill holes in this area, further drilling is required to properly evaluate the resource and to ensure 
reliable correlations of the target sequence.

Core recovery for all units was reasonable during the 2011 and 2012 drilling program, with a mean core recovery 
of 86% (range of 0% to 100%), for all units.  There were 400 occurrences with core recovery less than 90%.  Of 
these, there were 172 occurrences where core recovery was less than 50%.  The core recovery within the 
phosphorite beds appears to be in line with the overall core recovery, and is generally in excess of 80-85%. 

Overall the Rock Quality Designation (RQD) for all units was fair to excellent with a mean RQD of 45% (range of 
0% to 93%).  RQD in the phosphorite beds was consistent with the overall RQD. 

A total of 1,349 half core (hand split) samples were collected from all 34 drill holes.  Due to the non-continuous 
nature of the sampling, not all of the samples collected were within the target sequence, and as such fell within 
the overburden grouping (87 samples) and within the extrapolated intervals (257 samples).  Within the 
correlatable units of the target sequence, there were diatomite (445 samples) and phosphorite (560 samples) in 
all 34 drill holes.  Sample interval lengths ranged from 0.13 to 0.6 m (mean of 0.25 m) in the phosphorite and 
0.18 to 0.6 m (mean of 0.23 m) in the diatomite.  A detailed discussion of the analysis methods and the analytical 
results from the sampling program are presented in Item 11 of this technical report.

10.3 Drilling Procedures and Methodology 
The following sections detail the exploration drilling program procedures and methodology employed by 
GrowMax during the 2011 and 2012 exploration drilling programs. 

10.3.1 Drilling Methodology 
All 34 drill holes in the 2011 and 2012 GrowMax exploration program were drilled using a wireline drill rig, and 
were drilled vertically.  All drill holes were fully cored recovering NTW core (56 mm core diameter).   

The drilling programs were implemented using a nominal drill spacing of 1,000 m in Bayóvar N°7, between 1,000 
to 1,500 m spacing in Bayóvar N°8 and 1,500 to 2,000 m spacing in Bayóvar N°6. 

Golder was unable to confirm details regarding drill site supervision during the 2011 and 2012 drilling programs. 

10.3.2 Drill Hole Location Methodology 
Golder was unable to determine if a detailed survey of the drillhole location was completed.  It is assumed that 
the drill hole platforms were located by Americas Potash senior staff using a handheld GPS, based on the 
spacing mentioned previously.  After completion, drill holes are sealed with a cement monument (Plate 10.1).  
The drill hole name was inscribed into the cement monument prior to the cement setting.

10.3.3 Core handling and Visual Logging Methodology 
Exploration Data Collection and Documentation 
All measurements and observations collected during the core logging process were recorded by the Americas 
Potash technologists onto paper logs during the 2011 and 2012 drilling programs.  During the 2014-2015 logging 
and sampling program, two Geominex geologists recorded all information on paper logs and transcribed the data

into Excel every few days.  An excel file for all of the drill hole data was compiled, and included information on 
the collar location, downhole survey, lithology, recovery and sampling including quality data.  Information on the 
standards, duplicates and blanks inserted during the sampling program was also included. 

Core Handling 
Golder was unable to confirm the daily core handling procedures during the 2011 and 2012 drilling program. 

Between the completion of the drilling programs in 2011 and 2012 and the initiation of the core logging and 
sampling program in 2014-2015, the drill core was stored at a rented secure storage facility in Piura.  Although 
Golder confirm the chain of custody of the core boxes for the duration of this time, the general condition of the 
core and core boxes suggest they were protected from the elements and were held in a secure location 

The logging and sampling of the core took place in 2014-2015.  All drill holes were logged and sampled at the 
Americas Potash office and core facility in Piura by employees of Geominex, a third party consulting firm which 
is independent of GrowMax and Americas Potash.  The core logging and sampling was performed using 
guidelines established by Golder and Geominex.  

The Americas Potash office and core facility is a secure (gated and guarded) facility, with an owner/operator 
living onsite.  The core logging area was arranged to provide areas for logging, core splitting and sampling.  
Core was stored on covered core racks (Plate 10.3) while awaiting logging and sampling.  Once the logging and 
sampling process is completed for a given drill hole, the core boxes are transported to a locked industrial storage 
site in Piura..

Core Photography 
Before core splitting, logging and sampling commenced each complete core box was photographed by 
Geominex personnel using a tripod mounted digital camera.  The photos were archived for reference purposes 
(Plate 10.4). The core photography set up was standardized so that all core box photographs were consistent in 
terms of quality, scale and resolution.  Drill hole names and depth marker blocks were oriented so as to be 
clearly read in each photograph.  In addition to the core box photographs, detailed close-up photographs were 
also taken for any stratigraphic, structural, mineralization or other features of interest.  All photos were labeled 
using a systematic numbering system that clearly indicates drill hole name and depth interval in the photograph 
name.  Photographs were reviewed by the Geominex geologist to ensure they met the required standards prior 
to splitting the core.

Geotechnical Logging 
Once photographed the core was reoriented and fitted together as appropriate prior to measuring the length of 
core recovered for every drill interval and calculating the Total Core Recovery (TCR); the recovered length and 
TCR were recorded in the drill logging sheet.  The RQD was also calculated for each drill run by counting the 
number of whole core pieces that were equal to or greater than 10 cm in length.  The RQD results were recorded 
in the drill logging datasheet.  Observations on the spacing, frequency and infill material on joints and fractures 
were also recorded by the Geominex geologist in the drill logging datasheet. 

Descriptive Logging 
Once the TCR, RQD and other geotechnical observations were recorded on the whole core, the Geominex 
geologist cleaned and then scraped/peeled a slice off the core with a knife to expose a fresh surface for core 
logging (Plate 10.5).  Lithology descriptions included down hole depth intervals, colour, grain size, porosity, 
facies type, interpreted unit name, a detailed comment or description of each interval and the sample number if 
applicable.  A new interval record was created in the descriptive log any time a change in the colour, grain size, 
facies or geological unit occurred.  The Geominex geologist marked observed and interpreted geological unit 
and facies interval boundaries on the core during the visual logging process.  All lithology interval descriptions 
were then recorded directly onto the paper log by the Geominex geologist.

Grade Estimation  
During the core lithology logging and sampling, the Geominex geologist performed a visual estimation of the 
apatite pellets in the diatomite and phosphorite intervals using a magnified hand lens and a set of percentage 
composition estimation charts.  The Geominex geologist identified grade zones based on estimating the apatite 
pellet contents in each interval.  Individual diatomite and phosphorite intervals were subdivided into multiple 
grade intervals whenever there were 5% changes (positive or negative) in the estimated pellet content.   

The grade estimation process, as well as the detailed core logging and sampling for all 34 drill holes was 
performed by the same two Geominex geologists to minimize variability and/or bias in the grade estimation 
process.  The two senior geologists regularly cross checked each other's estimates to ensure they were 
consistently estimating grade intervals. 

Once the grade intervals were established and marked on the drill core, the Geominex geologist recorded the 
estimated percentage and indicated whether it was weak, moderate or strong phosphorite for each interval 
directly into the drill logging sheet. 

Core Splitting 
Once logging was completed and the sampling intervals assigned, a longitudinal cut line was marked on the core 
by the Geominex geologist.  The core for the entire drill hole was split longitudinally by hand by Americas Potash 
technical personnel.  A core technician placed individual core segments in a form to hold the core in place on the 
splitting bench.  A 3 to 5 mm deep groove was then cut along the longitudinal cut line on the core segment using 
a circular saw (Plate 10.6).  The cut was made using a circular saw without using water.  A cleaver was then 
placed in the cut and gently struck with a hammer to split the core in half (Plate 10.7).  This procedure was used 
on most of the core except in instances where the material was very soft, in which case it was split by a knife or 
sampling spoons.  This core splitting method allowed for the best results in terms of maintaining core segment 
integrity (over a mechanical vise style sample splitter or water cooled saw) as well as providing a natural fracture

10.4 Drilling Factors Impacting Accuracy and Reliability of Results 
Golder was unable to confirm a number of details regarding the 2011 and 2012 drilling program, including drill 
location surveying, core transport and daily drill supervision.  However, the core appears to have been kept 
secure and in good condoning during the intervening period of time between the drilling and the 2014-2015 
logging and sampling program.

It is Golder's opinion that the 2014-2015 GrowMax core logging and sampling program was carried out 
according to appropriate professional methodologies and procedures, including those presented in the CIM 
Exploration Best Practice Guidelines (August 2000 edition).  The methodology and procedures were well defined 
and documented by Golder and Geominex prior to commencing with the logging and sampling program.  All 
components of the program were conducted according to the methodology and procedures and were well 
documented during implementation by Geominex personnel.   

The overall drill core recovery was very good (mean of 86%), as was the recovery in the phosphorite beds.  The 
RQD was fair to good overall (mean of 45%) and was consistent in the phosphorite beds.  The sample 
distribution, while not consistent top to bottom in each hole, does provide enough data points to make a 
reasonable interpretation of the resource. 

Golder is not aware of any factors or concerns regarding the accuracy and reliability of the logging and sampling 
results from the 2014-2015 GrowMax logging and sampling program.   

10.5 Interpretation of Drilling Results 
The drill hole data from the 2014-2015 GrowMax logging and sampling exploration program were reviewed and 
interpreted independently by Geominex senior geologists and by the Golder QP.  Drill hole lithology and grade 
data was used to confirm the roof and floor picks for each of the phosphorite intervals as well as the various 
overburden, interburden and underburden units.  Drill hole fences were used to confirm the correlation of the 
phosphorite beds and overburden, interburden and underburden units between drill holes.  A detailed discussion 
of the interpretive geology and geological modelling process is presented in Item 14 of this technical report.

ITEM 11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
11.1 Sample Summary 
Sampling and phosphate analyses activities on the GrowMax Bayóvar Project to date have been limited to 
sampling of exploration drill core during the 2014-2015 GrowMax logging and sampling program. 

A total of 1,349 half core (hand split) samples were collected from all 34 drill holes.  Due to the non-continuous 
nature of the sampling, not all of the samples collected were within the target sequence, and as such fell within 
the overburden grouping (87 samples) and within the extrapolated intervals (257 samples).  Within the 
correlatable units of the target sequence, there were 445 diatomite samples and 560 phosphorite samples 
collected from the 34 drill holes.  The sample interval lengths ranged from 0.13 to 0.6 m (mean of 0.25 m) in the 
phosphorite and 0.18 to 0.6 m (mean of 0.23 m) in the diatomite.   

All 2014-2015 GrowMax samples were submitted to the Certimin laboratory in Lima Peru for analyses.   

The standard analytical package performed on all diatomite and phosphorite samples was as follows: 

 P2O5 & SiO2 (gravimetric analysis); 

 major oxides (ICP-OES analysis); and, 
As a reliable relative density data was not available for the phosphorite or diatomite beds at the time the model 
and resource estimate were prepared, a global default relative density of 1.25 grams per cubic centimetre 
(g/cm3; dry-basis) and 1.65 g/cm3 (wet-basis) was applied to convert estimated phosphorite resource volumes to 
tonnes. These densities were established based on past Golder experience in similar phosphate deposits.  

The following sections detail the sample selection, collection, transport, preparation and analyses procedures 
and methodology employed by GrowMax during the 2014-2015 sampling program. 

11.2 Sampling Methodology and Procedures 
11.2.1 Sample Interval Identification 
Sample intervals were marked on the drill core and recorded in the drill logging datasheet by the Geominex 
geologist.  Sample interval lengths ranged from 0.13 to 0.6 m (mean of 0.25 m) in the phosphorite and 0.18 to 
0.6 m (mean of 0.23 m) in the diatomite. 

11.2.2 Sample Collection and Packaging 
Once each sample interval was recorded in the drill logging datasheet the Geominex geologist selected each 
sample in sequence (Plate 11.1) and placed each one inside a plastic sample bag pre-labeled with the sample 
number.  A sample tag was also placed inside the sample bag before the bag was sealed by double folding the 
top, stapling and finally taping the bag closed (Plate 11.2).  The sample was then weighed and the as shipped 
sample weight was recorded, along with the sample number and the sample interval from and to depths directly 
onto the drill logging paper datasheets by the Geominex geologist. 

The sealed sample bags were then placed in 70 litre plastic sample pails (Plate 11.3).  Once each sample pail 
was full, they were sealed by hammering a lid on, then double security tagged and finally taped.  The pails were 
labelled clearly to identify the Certimin laboratory as the final shipping destination.  The full sample pails were 
held in the core logging facility until a shipment batch (approximately 8 - 20 barrels) was ready for transport to

Certimin laboratory in Lima by commercial bus.  An Americas Potash technician would travel with the samples to 
the Certimin laboratory to ensure a secure handover of the samples.  The samples were shipped on average 
once per week, usually on a Thursday. 

The remaining un-sampled core was carefully reorganized in the core box and the lids were returned to the 
boxes before they were transported to the secure core storage facility.

11.2.3 Insertion of Field Quality Assurance/Quality Control Standards 
Field QA/QC samples were inserted into the sampling stream by the Geominex geologist during the sampling 
process.  The QA/QC field standards used by Geominex included: 

 ¼ Core Duplicates – ¼ core duplicate assay sample (using half of the split core that was retained for 
reference purposes.

 Coarse Blanks – Several pails of coquina sand from the FOSPAC concessions were used as coarse 
blanks.  

 Certified Reference Materials – Five commercially prepared certified reference material standards (CRM's) 
were purchased from Geostats Pty Ltd of Australia.  The CRM's were matrix matched from a sedimentary 
phosphate in Tunisia.  The following standards were used by Geominex: 

 GPO-01 – 28.66 wt.% P2O5 

 GPO 15 – 25.22 wt.% P2O5 

 GPO 16 - 17.76 wt.% P2O5 

 GPO 17 – 13.55 wt.% P2O5 

 GPO 18 – 15.09 wt.% P2O5 

The field standards were inserted randomly into the sample number sequence by the Geominex geologist.  
Generally, one CRM, one blank and one ¼ duplicate were inserted every 20 samples; however, care was taken 
to ensure the field standards were not inserted at predictable intervals or at the same location in each drill hole.  
The field standards were placed in a plastic sample bag and secured with a cable tie in the same fashion as the 
regular analytical samples. The Geominex geologist generally tried to insert the mineralized CRM standards 
within zones of similar estimated grade of mineralization in the sample sequence before, within or immediately 
after the mineralized sample. Blanks were inserted at the end of mineralized runs to monitor potential cross 
contamination.  Each sample submission batch was designed to include as a minimum the following standards in 
each batch: 

 2 ¼ Core duplicates 

 2 CRM's (grade matched to the estimated mineralization) 

 2 Coarse blanks 
11.3 Sample Preparation and Analytical Methodology and Procedures 
11.3.1 Analytical Laboratory 
All sample preparation and analytical work for the 2014-2015 GrowMax sampling program was performed at the 
Certimin S.A (Certimin) laboratory in Lima Peru.  The Certimin laboratory is an ISO 9001:2008 certified and 
Peruvian Government National Accreditation Service (INDECOPI) accredited analytical laboratory with 
certificates in good standing (certificate renewal date : May 2015).  Certimin has significant experience providing 
analytical services to the phosphate exploration and other exploration industries in Peru.   

11.3.2 Analytical Results 
Analyses were performed by Certimin on a total of 1,349 samples from the diatomite (445 samples), phosphorite 
(560 samples), overburden (87 samples) and extrapolated intervals (257 samples) in all 34 drill holes.  A 
summary of the analytical results for the individual phosphorite beds is presented in Table 11.1, Summary of 
Phosphorite Bed Analytical Results. A summary of the analytical results for the individual diatomite beds is 
presented in Table 11.2, Summary of Diatomite Bed Analytical Results.

11.4 Sample Security 
The Americas Potash office and core facility is a secure (gated and guarded) facility, with an owner/operator 
living onsite.  The core logging area was arranged to provide areas for logging, core splitting and sampling.  
Core is stored on covered core racks whilst awaiting logging and sampling, once sampled, the remaining un-
sampled core was carefully reorganized in the core box and the lids were returned to the boxes before they were 
transported to the secure core storage facility. 

The sample packaging was performed by Americas Potash core technicians under the supervision of the 
Geominex geologists.  The sealed sample bags were placed in 70 litre plastic sample pails, sealed by 
hammering a lid on, then double security tagged and finally taped.  The pails were labelled clearly to identify the 
Certimin laboratory as the final shipping destination.  The full sample pails were held in the core logging facility 
until a shipment batch was ready for transport to Certimin in Lima by commercial bus.  An Americas Potash 
technician would travel with the samples to the Certimin laboratory to ensure a secure handover of the samples.  
The samples were shipped on average once per week, usually on a Thursday. 

11.5 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Methodology and 
Procedures 

11.5.1 GrowMax Field Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
Geominex implemented a comprehensive analytical QA/QC program on behalf of GrowMax during the 2014-
2015 sampling program that included the insertion of blind CRM standards, duplicates and blanks to evaluate 
analytical precision, accuracy and potential contamination during the sample preparation and analytical process.  
The field QA/QC samples were inserted by Geominex geologists during the core sampling process. 

The QA/QC sample summary and insertion rates for the GrowMax 2014-2015 sampling program are presented 
in Table 11.3, GrowMax 2014-2015 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Samples

Certified Reference Material Standards. 
GrowMax used five commercially prepared phosphate CRM standards to monitor laboratory analytical accuracy.  
The CRM standards were purchased from Geostats Pty Ltd. of Australia.  The CRM's were matrix matched from 
a sedimentary phosphate in Tunisia.  The following standards were used by GrowMax: 

 GPO-01 – 28.66 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.145) 

 GPO 15 – 25.22 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.064) 

 GPO 16 - 17.76 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.147) 

 GPO 17 – 13.55 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.117) 

 GPO 18 – 15.09 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.117) 
 

A total of 96 blind CRM standards were submitted to Certimin for analysis.  Golder prepared and evaluated 
QA/QC control charts for each of the CRM standards (Figure 11.1, Control Charts – P2O5 Certified Reference 
Material Standards).  All of the CRM standards analysed fell within the control limits and there was a single 
instance of a GPO-18 standard approaching but not reaching the upper control limit.

Coarse and Pulp Duplicates 
GrowMax submitted blind coarse duplicates comprising ¼ core samples (half of the core split retained for 
reference purposes) to Certimin. 

A total of 66 blind coarse duplicates were submitted to Certimin for analysis. Golder prepared and evaluated 
QA/QC cross plots for the original and duplicate analyses (Figure 11.2, Cross Plot – P2O5 Primary and Duplicate 
Analyses).  There were a small number of duplicates that showed variation from the original result but they are 
likely due to isolated and minor grade variations within the samples as all other QA/QC controls from the batches 
were within their tolerances.

Coarse Blanks 
The coarse blank standard was prepared using locally sourced (FOSPAC Concession) coquina sand from the 
barren Upper Diatomite Series (above the Diana Ore Zone).  

A total of 95 blind blank standards were submitted to Certimin for analysis. Golder reviewed the results for the 
blanks and found that all 95 samples returned values below detection limit. 

11.5.2 Certimin Internal Laboratory Analytical Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
In addition to the field based QA/QC program implemented by GrowMax, Certimin also performed their own 
internal analytical QA/QC program that included the insertion of blind CRM standards, duplicates and blanks to 
evaluate analytical precision, accuracy and potential contamination during the sample preparation and analytical 
process.  The laboratory standards were a combination of blind standards inserted by laboratory sample 
preparation and QA/QC personnel prior to analysis, as well as routine testing of reference standards during the 
analytical process (i.e. during ICP-OES analysis). 

11.5.3 QP Comment on Analytical Quality Assurance and Quality Control Program 
It is Golder's opinion that the GrowMax and Geominex QA/QC protocol and the Certimin laboratory internal 
QA/QC protocol applied during the 2014-2015 logging and sampling program were appropriate, followed and 

May 2015 
Report No. 1403265-TR 92  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

well documented during the analytical process.  It is Golder's opinion that analytical samples showing no 
significant bias and that the quality of Certimin analyses results can be considered reliable for use in estimating 
Mineral Resources.  Golder does recommend that GrowMax add a check assay component to their analytical 
QA/QC program using a secondary independent laboratory. 

11.6 Laboratory Audit 
The Golder QP did not perform a Laboratory Audit as part of the site visit for this project.  The Golder QP is 
familiar with the Certamin laboratory in Lima having performed an audit at the lab within the past year. The Lima 
laboratory is also used regularly by Golder personnel in the Lima office with no issues identified.  

11.7 Qualified Person Statement on Sampling, Analysis and Quality 
Control 

It is Golder's opinion that appropriate chain of custody and internationally recognized sample selection, sample 
preparation, analysis and QA/QC procedures were followed during the sample preparation and analytical 
process for the 2014-2015 GrowMax sampling program.  It is Golder's opinion that the samples collected during 
the 2014-2015 sampling program were of high quality and were representative of the phosphorite mineralization 
within the GrowMax Bayóvar Project with no significant sample bias.

ITEM 12 DATA VERIFICATION 
12.1 Data Verification Procedures 
12.1.1 GrowMax 2011 and 2012 Data Verification 
As Golder personnel were not involved during the implementation phase of the 2011 or 2012 GrowMax 
exploration program the primary quality control and data verification measures taken were in the form of a 
desktop review of the data and observations provided by GrowMax.  Golder does have some concerns regarding 
the length of time between the drilling and sampling of the drill core, as mentioned in previous sections, however, 
Golder is satisfied that the data and observations from the 2011 and 2012 programs can be considered reliable 
for use in geological modelling and resource estimation.  The key areas of the previous GrowMax exploration 
program data and observation verification carried out by Golder are presented in the following sections. 

Drill Hole Collar Location Verification 
During the personal inspection site visit the Golder QP visited 11 of the 34 drill hole locations on the GrowMax 
Bayóvar Project in order to verify and document the reported drill hole locations.  The drill holes visited for collar 
location verification, shown in Figure 12.1, Drill Collar Verification Map, were selected at random by the Golder 
QP while in the field to ensure there was no bias in drill hole selection by the GrowMax personnel.  The drill 
holes visited covered the bulk of the spatial extent of the GrowMax Bayóvar Project drill holes. 

Drill hole collar monuments, indicating the drill hole name, completion date and depth, were photographed (Plate 
12.1, and Plate 12.2) and drill hole collar coordinates for each of the 6 drill holes were recorded using a 
handheld non-differential GPS.  The handheld GPS coordinates were compared to the surveyed collar 
coordinates and differences in easting and northing were calculated.  The results of the collar coordinate 
comparison are presented in Table 12.1, Summary of Drill Hole Collar Coordinate Comparison. The differences 
between the drill hole verification coordinates and the surveyed collar coordinates are within the error limits of 
the handheld GPS.

Logging and Sampling Procedure Verification 
Golder did not actively participate in the implementation of the 2011 or 2012 exploration drilling program.  Golder 
did work with GrowMax and Geominex personnel to establish the core logging, sampling and laboratory 
analytical programs that were used during the 2014-2015 logging and sampling program. The Golder QP was 
able to observe the implementation of the core splitting, logging and sampling procedures during the QP current 
personal inspection site visit (Plate 12.3, Plate 12.4 and Plate 12.5).

Geological Data and Interpretation Verification 
Geological data and interpretation verification performed by Golder was in the form of a desktop review of the 
descriptive logs, sample interval data and analytical data to ensure the geological database was free from 
typographic errors or omissions.

Golder prepared graphic logs for each of the 34 GrowMax drill holes using all available data for each drill hole.  
Lithology intervals were reviewed and where minor errors or omissions were identified Golder performed these 
adjustments.  GrowMax provided Golder with phosphorite bed correlations which Golder used as reference 
during the review.  During the review process, Golder reinterpreted and updated the correlations where minor 
errors or omission existed in the phosphorite and diatomite bed correlations between drill holes. 

Analytical Data Verification 
Analytical data verification performed by Golder includes cross referencing the spreadsheet analytical data 
against pdf copies of the Certimin laboratory certificates to ensure the analytical database was free from 
typographic errors or omissions.  Analytical data for the phosphorite and diatomite beds was reviewed in detail 
by Golder to ensure the data set was free of any miscorrelations, errors and/or omissions. 

Golder performed an independent assessment of the laboratory and field QA/QC results for the program 
(discussed in detail in Item 11 of this report) 

Golder did not independently collect samples to submit for analyses.   

12.2 Limitations on Data Verification 
The primary limitation on the data verification relates to the time elapsed between drilling of the core in 2011 and 
2012 and the sampling and analyses in 2014-2015.  Golder had initial concerns that the prolonged exposure to 
air, heat and humidity might negatively impact the core and the resultant analytical results. Upon visual 
inspection the core appeared to be in good condition and was no worse for wear during the 2 plus years of 
storage.  The analytical results for the phosphorite and diatomite samples were consistent with results elsewhere 
in the Bayóvar area.  Both of these points suggest the long storage of the core before sampling did not materially 
affect the core negatively but this should be evaluated in the future via twining of select holes to verify 
reproducibility and representativeness of the analytical results. 

12.3 Qualified Person Statement on Data Verification 
It is Golder's opinion that the exploration data and observations from the 34 drill holes completed during the 
2011 and 2012 GrowMax drilling programs and the 2014-2015 GrowMax sampling program have been 
appropriately verified for the purpose of completing a geological model, estimating Mineral Resources and 
preparing an NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate technical report.

ITEM 14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
14.1 Definition of Mineral Resources 
For estimating the phosphate Mineral Resources for GrowMax Bayóvar Project, Golder has applied the 
definitions of "Mineral Resource" as set forth in the CIM Definitions Standards adopted November 27, 2010 
(CIMDS) by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Council.   

Under CIMDS, a Mineral Resource is defined as:  

"… a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized 
organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust 
in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that is has reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are 
known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge."  

Mineral Resources are subdivided into classes of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred, with the level of confidence 
reducing with each class respectively. Mineral Resources are always reported as in situ tonnage and are not 
adjusted for mining losses or mining recovery. 

14.2 Mineral Resource Estimation Methodology 
14.2.1 General 
Geological modelling and subsequent Mineral Resource estimation was performed by the Golder QP in 
accordance with Golder internal modelling and resource estimation guidelines and in accordance with the CIM 
Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines (May 2003 edition).The 
geological data compilation, interpretation, geological modelling and Mineral Resource estimation methods and 
procedures are described in the following sections. 

14.2.2 Geological Database 
Golder compiled all available drill hole data including drill hole collar survey, down hole lithology, sample interval 
and analytical results into a MS Access master geological database.  Golder performed basic data checks on the 
loaded data including checking for duplicate drill holes, lithology and sample records, checking for lithology 
interval and sample interval overlaps.  Records in digital spreadsheet files, including all Certimin analytical 
results, were cross checked against pdf scans of lab certificates and other original paper records to ensure the 
data set as free from any errors or omissions.  No significant errors or omissions were identified during the base 
data review process; minor errors or omissions were rectified by Golder based on supporting documentation (i.e. 
lab certificates) and or discussions with Geominex personnel responsible for collecting and providing the base 
data. 

The geological database included downhole lithology records from 34 drill holes totaling 3,747 m of core and 
1,349 phosphorite bed and interburden bed analytical samples.  Once the checks were completed the drill hole 
survey, lithology and analytical data was formatted in preparation for correlation reviews and eventual geological 
modelling.

14.2.3 Geological Interpretation 
The review of phosphorite bed roof and floor picks and between drill hole correlations was performed in Golden 
Software's Strater™ program.  The drill hole data was loaded into Strater™ and graphic logs were prepared for 
each drill hole to allow for visual inspection of the down hole lithology and sampling data and observations and 
the analytical results for the purpose of ensuring the phosphorite bed roof and floor picks were consistent with 
the analytical results for the intervals.  A number of minor adjustments were made to the roof and floor depth to 
ensure the phosphorite bed depth intervals were consistent with grade data. 

The initial between hole correlation performed by Geominex personnel was also reviewed in Strater™ by 
creating fence lines of drill holes and comparing the structure (thickness and elevation) and grade signatures of 
the phosphorite beds in adjacent drill holes.  Fence sections oriented in both east-west and north-south 
orientations were prepared for each of the three individual drilling areas, using all 34 GrowMax drill holes.  An 
example of a correlations fence section is presented in Figure 14.1  Example of Correlation Fence Section. 
Overall the Geominex phosphorite bed correlation was very good and only minor adjustments were required. 

During the roof and floor evaluation and the correlation review, Golder identified a number of instances where 
phosphorite beds appeared to be thinning or pinching out; these zones often coincided with areas where 
sampling of the diatomite intervals between major beds was limited to narrow roof and floor wing samples 
immediately adjacent to the overlying and underlying phosphorite bed contacts.  It is Golder's opinion that given 
the relatively continuous nature of the phosphorite beds across the region, it is possible that these beds were 
intercepted but have not been sampled or analysed to date.  Golder recommends that the results of the 
correlation review be used to revisit and potentially select additional samples for analyses. 

The geological database was updated to reflect any adjustments to the phosphorite bed roof and floor picks and 
or the correlated beds.  After updating the database the initial data checks were performed again to ensure that 
there were no issues with the data as a result of the pick checks and correlation review.  Once the database was 
validated the data was formatted and exported in preparation for import into the geological modelling software. 

14.2.4 Topographic Modelling 
As the initial step in the geological modelling process, Golder created a topography model for the project area 
using elevation data extracted from the DSM prepared by PhotoSat.  Elevation data was extracted from the DSM 
and exported to an ASCII xyz file using Global Mapper software.  The ASCII xyz data was then imported into the 
MineScape StratModel geological modelling software package, where the data was loaded and inspected to 
ensure there were no outliers within the dataset  The xyz data was then gridded in StratModel using a 10 by 10 
m regularized grid.  Due to the large area covered by the Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 and Bayóvar N°8 
concessions, Golder applied a limiting polygon to the data during the gridding process to avoid unnecessarily 
increasing the file size by gridding topography well outside of the areas of interest. 

The topography surface was then contoured and visually inspected to ensure there were no issues.  Spot 
elevation checks were also performed using publically available low resolution ASTER and SRTM topography 
data and a small LiDAR data set that didn't provide complete coverage over the area of interest.   Spots checks 
of the topography surface were also performed using the drill hole collar coordinates and elevations.  The collar 
elevations were generally within the margin of error for the collar elevation surveys and the DSM elevation 
errors; collar elevation versus topography model elevation differences ranged from 0.06 to 6.11 m with a means 
difference of 0.73 m.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

To avoid discrepancies between the topography model and geology model, the collar elevations were adjusted 
to use the topography model elevation at the collar easting and northing coordinates. 

14.2.5 Stratigraphic and Structural Model 
Golder developed a 3D stratigraphic and structural model spanning the entire GrowMax Bayóvar Project area 
(Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 and Bayóvar N°8 concessions inclusive) using the Ventyx MineScape geological 
modelling and mine planning software package.   

The stratigraphic and structural model was developed as gridded surface model using a grid cell size of 20 by 20 
m.  The model comprises gridded structure surfaces for each modeled phosphorite bed as well as the base of 
the overburden.  The structure grids created represent the bed roof, floor, vertical thickness (roof minus floor) 
and true thickness.  Model data included validated drill hole collar survey records, lithology data and 
observations, sample intervals and analytical results for all 34 drill holes completed on the GrowMax Bayóvar 
Project.  The topography used in the model was the 10 by 10 m gridded topography model discussed in the 
previous section. 

A planar interpolator was used for phosphorite bed thickness calculations while a Finite Element Method 
interpolator was used for phosphorite bed roof and floor surface calculations.  The model extents extended well 
beyond the limits of the three drilling areas to ensure regional stratigraphic and structural trends were accounted 
for in the model. 

The stratigraphic and structural model includes an undifferentiated overburden unit that overlies a sequence of 
16 correlatable phosphorite beds identified as PH00 through PH15.  The phosphorite beds modeled are 
presented in stratigraphic order in Figure 14.2, Geological Model Stratigraphic Sequence. 

Geological cross-sections and long sections were cut and isopleth maps were prepared for each structure 
parameter on a bed by bed basis.  The contours were compared against structure postings from the drill hole 
composites to ensure the model was representative of the base data.  Summary statistics for the drill hole and 
modeled seam structure (roofs, floors, thickness) were also reviewed.  Any potential outliers or issues identified 
in the visual inspection and statistical review were followed up on to ensure the model was free from erroneous 
data or interpolation errors. 

The model is developed as an iterative process of gridding, checking the results via model and drill hole 
statistics, geological sections and structure isopleth maps prior to adding interpretive controls and then rerunning 
the entire process until the model reasonably reflects the data and overall geological interpretation. The result is 
a refined model that honors the base data and is free of interpretive errors or omissions.  The final stratigraphic 
model provides the basis for volumetric estimates for phosphate resources, constraining the phosphate quality 
model.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

14.2.6 Density/Specific Gravity 
As a result of the core logging and sampling taking place several years after the holes were drilling, the Golder 
QP deemed that the moisture loss which will have occurred due to atmospheric exposure was sufficient to make 
relative density analyses from the core samples unreliable. 

To allow for phosphorite bed model volumes to be converted to tonnes for the purpose of Mineral Resource 
estimation, Golder has applied a global default relative density of 1.25 g/cm3 (dry basis) to all 17 phosphorite 
beds.  The default relative density of 1.25 g/cm3 (dry basis) was established to be on the conservative side of 
relative density data for similar phosphate mineralization both in the Bayóvar region and globally. 

14.2.7 Grade Model 
Once the stratigraphic and structural model was completed, a gridded grade model was constructed in 
StratModel.  The grade model was developed using the same 20 by 20 m grid as used in the stratigraphic and 
structural model.  The grade model comprises gridded surfaces for each modeled grade parameter for each 
individual phosphorite bed; the grade grid surfaces are spatially associated with the corresponding phosphorite 
bed grid surfaces.  Grade data including P2O5 and SiO2 (by gravimetric analyses) and major oxides (by ICP-OES 
analyses) were gridded using a Finite Element Method interpolator for all 17 correlatable phosphorite beds.   

As sampling in the interburden units was limited to roof and floor wing samples bounding the phosphorite beds, 
the interburden grade samples were used by Golder to verify phosphorite bed roof and floor picks but the 
interburden grade data was not interpolated into the grade model.   

As reliable density analyses were not available for the Bayóvar Project, Golder applied global default relative 
densities of 1.25 grams per centimetre cubed (g/cm3; dry-basis) and 1.65 g/cm3 (wet basis) to convert estimated 
phosphorite resource volumes to tonnes.  The global default dry and wet bases density values used were 
established based on Golder's experience in similar phosphate deposits both locally and globally. 

The individual grade samples were composited using the phosphorite beds in the drill holes to create a single 
composite for each bed that was interested in each drill hole.  Summary statistics of the phosphorite bed 
composite grade data to identify any outliers as well as to identify any instances where there is insufficient data 
for gridding; a minimum of three composites with appropriate spatial distribution across the extents of the 
phosphorite bed are required for .gridding of the grade parameters.  The number of phosphorite beds with 
gridded grade data varied from concession to concession due to drill hole counts and phosphorite beds that 
were not intersected or not sampled in some drill holes. 

Isopleth maps for each grade parameter for each individual phosphorite bed were prepared and checked against 
grade postings from the drill hole composites to ensure the model was honouring the data.  Any potential outliers 
or issues identified in the visual inspection and statistical review were followed up on to ensure the model was 
free from erroneous data or interpolation errors. 

14.3 Mineral Resource Estimation and Classification 
Using the finalized stratigraphic and structural model and the grade model, Golder estimated phosphate Mineral 
Resources for the GrowMax Bayóvar Project using the StratModel application of MineScape.  Phosphate Mineral 
Resources were estimated for each individual phosphorite bed from PH00 through PH16.  As per NI 43-101 

May 2015 
Report No. 1403265-TR 106  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

guidelines and CIMDS definitions the Mineral Resources were reported as in situ tonnage and were not adjusted 
for mining losses or mining recovery.  No minimum mining thickness or grade cut-off parameters were applied. 

Mineral Resource volumes and grade were estimated for each phosphorite bed using the corresponding unit roof 
and floor grids from the structural grid model.  The volumes for each phosphorite bed were then converted to 
tonnes using the global default relative density of 1.25 g/cm3 (dry basis). 

Golder performed categorization of the Mineral Resources for the GrowMax Bayóvar Project according to the 
CIMDS definitions as referenced in NI 43-101.  Mineral resources were categorized into Measured, Indicated 
and Inferred Mineral Resource using area of influence polygons around points of observation.  A point of 
observation is defined as a complete intercept of the bed (both roof and floor intercepted). 

Golder performed a statistical and geostatistical evaluation of the phosphorite bed structure and grade 
parameters for all phosphorite beds in all three areas for the purpose of evaluating Mineral Resource 
categorization distances.  Unfortunately the limited number and spatial distribution of points of observation for 
the individual phosphorite beds prevented Golder from being able to develop meaningful semi-variograms for 
phosphorite bed thickness and P2O5 grade parameters. However, an inability to generate semi-variograms does 
not prevent the QP from using their experience and judgment to estimate classified Phosphate Resources.   

In lieu of statistically and/ or geostatistically derived categorization parameters, Golder relied on past experience 
in the categorization of phosphate Mineral Resources with similar thickness and grade parameters and 
continuity, both in the Bayóvar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit as well as in global phosphate deposits. Golder 
applied area of influence polygon radii that are consistent with those applied in other phosphate Mineral 
Resource estimates.   

Mineral Resource categorization was performed individually for each phosphorite bed using drill hole intercepts 
on the floor of the unit for the location of the point of observation.  The area of influence polygons were 
generated on the floor surface for each phosphorite bed rather than on the horizontal plane to allow for the dip of 
stratigraphy.   

Golder used the following area of influence classification parameters for the GrowMax Bayóvar Project Mineral 
Resource estimate: 

 Measured Mineral Resources – 400 m spacing between points of observation 

 Indicated Mineral Resources – 800 m spacing between points of observation 

 Inferred Mineral Resources – 1,600 m spacing between points of observation 
14.4 Statement of Mineral Resources 
Golder has estimated phosphate Mineral Resources for the GrowMax Bayóvar Project.  As per NI 43-101 
guidelines, Golder is reporting only in situ phosphate Mineral Resources as a mine plan, processing/metallurgy 
study, environmental study, economic analysis, marketing analysis, and other modifying factor studies have not 
been completed to a minimum of a Pre-Feasibility level of study as of the effective date of the resource estimate.  
No minimum thickness, grade cut-off, dilution, recovery or other mining factors have been applied to the in situ 
resource estimate and no Mineral Reserves are being reported at this time.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

Golder performed categorization of the Mineral Resources for the GrowMax Bayóvar Project according to the 
CIMDS definitions as referenced in NI 43-101.  Mineral resources were categorized into Measured, Indicated 
and Inferred Mineral Resource using area of influence polygons around points of observation.   

Mineral Resource volumes and grade were estimated for each phosphorite bed.  The volumes for each 
phosphorite bed were then converted to tonnes using the global default relative density of 1.25 g/cm3 (dry basis). 

Based on an evaluation of the drill hole spacing and geological continuity of the phosphorite beds, Golder has 
applied a Mineral Resource classification schema of 0 to 400 m spacing for Measured Resources, 400 to 800 m 
spacing for Indicated Resources and 800 to 1,600 m for Inferred Resources.  Based on this classification 
scheme there are currently no reportable Measured Resources.   

Indicated Mineral Resource (Bayóvar N°7Concession only) and Inferred Mineral Resource (all three 
concessions) tonnes and grade (mass weighted, dry-basis) for all beds and all areas combined are summarized 
in Table 14.1, Summary of Indicated* Mineral Resources, All Areas, All Beds and Table 14.2, Summary of 
Inferred* Mineral Resources, All Areas, All Beds Detailed results of the Mineral Resource estimate, reported by 
area and by phosphorite bed, are presented in Table 14.3, Summary of Bayóvar 7 Indicated Mineral Resources*,

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

14.5 Reasonable Prospects for Extraction 
As per the CIMDS definition of Mineral Resources, a key requirement in the Estimation of Mineral Resources is 
that they must have a reasonable prospect for economic extraction. 

The bulk of the Mineral Resource Estimate presented in this report falls within in the Inferred Mineral Resource 
category.  For Inferred Mineral Resources the confidence level is not sufficient for the application of technical 
and economic parameters to be used for detailed planning and estimation of Mineral Reserves. 

Estimation of Mineral Reserves requires additional modifying factors studies performed to a minimum of a Pre-
Feasibility level of study; mine planning, processing, environmental, economic, marketing and other modifying 
factors studies that will provide further insight into prospects for development and extraction of the Mineral 
Resource have not been completed to a minimum Pre-Feasibility level of study to date.  

The assumption of reasonable prospects for development and extraction of the phosphate Mineral Resource 
located within the GrowMax Bayóvar Project limits is based primarily on commercial phosphate production and 
advanced level studies on the same phosphorite beds within adjacent and contiguous concessions of the same 
Bayóvar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit.  These activities include the currently producing Vale Miski Mayo 
phosphate mine, the currently producing Fosyeiki phosphate operation and the advanced stage studies on the 
FOSPAC Bayóvar 9 Concession.

ITEM 18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
Infrastructure and facilities studies have not been performed to date on the project.  However, given the current 
foot print of the Mineral Resource and the extent of the 16 contiguous concessions held or pending approval, 
GrowMax/Americas Potash will have sufficient surface rights for potential mining operations, potential tailings 
storage areas, potential waste disposal areas and potential processing plant facilities.  Surface infrastructure and 
operations would require coordination with any potential brine mining and production infrastructure and facilities 
that GrowMax and Americas Potash may develop in the future. 

The GrowMax Bayóvar Project is accessible year round via a series of multi-lane sealed roads and highways.  
The Pan-American Highway transects the eastern side of Bayóvar N°6 and the Chiclayo-Bayóvar road crosses 
just south of the Bayóvar N°7 and Bayóvar N°8 concession boundaries.  A network of un-maintained drill roads 
provides four wheel drive vehicle access to the remainder of the property. 

Travel time from Piura to the GrowMax Bayóvar Project is approximately 1.5 hours by car via the Pan-American 
Highway.  Piura is serviced by a modern domestic airport with commercial daily service to Lima and other 
airports in the region.  Air travel flying time from Piura to Lima is approximately 1.5 hours. 

The GrowMax Bayóvar Project area is approximately 40 km by paved multi-lane road from the fishing village of 
Puerto Rico, located on Sechura Bay on the pacific coast.  Several port facilities for loading of dry bulk materials 
are situated adjacent to the village of Puerto Rico, including the Vale port facility where phosphate from Vale's 
Miski Mayo operation (Bayóvar Mine) is loaded for shipping. 

Power transmission lines for the Vale Bayóvar Mine transect the very southeast corner of the Bayóvar N°8 
concession.  Power transmission lines also transect the Nuevo Bayóvar N°8, Nuevo Bayóvar 9, Nuevo Bayóvar 
10, Nuevo Bayóvar 11 and Nuevo Bayóvar 12 concessions along the Pan-American Highway (Figure 18.1  
Regional Infrastructure and Access).  A pipeline right of way crosses through the Nuevo Bayóvar 17 concession 
and across the very southeast corner of the Bayóvar N°8 concession. 

Given the presence of the Vale Bayóvar mine as well as the number of other phosphate projects in the 
immediate vicinity, it should not be an issue to access sufficient power, water and road access for any potential 
future operations.

At present the most advanced operation or project in the area is Vale's currently producing Bayóvar Mine located 
on the Bayóvar N°2 Concession, 25 km southwest of the GrowMax Bayóvar Project.  The Vale operation is one 
of the largest phosphate deposits in South America. Vale partners in the project are Mosaic (35%) and Mitsui 
(25%; Vale 2010 Annual Report).  

FOSPAC (Cementos Pacasmayo / Mitsubishi / Zuari) recently completed a Feasibility Study on the Bayóvar N°9 
Concession, located 16 kilometers southwest of the GrowMax Bayóvar Project and 11 kilometers north of the 
Vale Bayóvar Mine.  FOSPAC is currently evaluating the project, which has a reported mine life of 20 years 
based on 130 Mt (dry-density) of Measured and Indicated Resources grading 17.5 wt.% P2O5 (FOSPAC 
Environmental Impact Assessment Report, October 2013). 

The Fosyeiki operation comprises a small open pit phosphate mining on a narrow strip of land between the Vale 
and FOSPAC concessions (approximately 200 m wide by 2,000 m long).  The operation is very basic, consisting 
of stripping of overburden by dozer and mining of the PH01 phosphorite bed using a small excavator and a 
dump truck.  Fosyeiki performs simple beneficiation on the mined material, operating a small coal fired dryer that 
reduces the product moisture and diatomite fines, resulting in a slight P2O5 product grade increase.  The 
upgraded product is then bagged and sold as a direct application fertilizer in the domestic and international 
markets. 

The Focus Ventures Bayovar 12 Project is situated directly south of the GrowMax Bayóvar Project.  Focus is 
currently advancing the project towards completion of a Preliminary Economic Assessment as well as 
conducting additional exploration drilling.

Report No. 1403265-TR 126  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

ITEM 25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The 2014-2015 logging and sampling program was completed successfully and has resulted in the development 
of an initial geological model and maiden phosphate Mineral Resource estimate as reported in this NI 43-101 
technical report.    

The methodologies and procedures used for the collection of the drilling, core logging, sampling and analytical 
data were reviewed in detail by Golder and are deemed to be appropriate for use in the estimation of Mineral 
Resources and for the preparation for this technical report. 

The Diana Formation phosphorite bed thickness and grade parameters and continuity within the GrowMax 
Bayóvar N°6, Bayóvar N°7 and Bayóvar N°8 concessions are consistent with those being mined at Vale's 4 
million tonnes per year phosphate mine and or evaluated in the adjacent and nearby concessions.  On this basis 
there is a reasonable prospect for extraction; however, as there are no Mineral Reserves currently being 
reported and the bulk of the Mineral Resources being reported fall within the Inferred category additional work is 
required to better understand the prospects for extraction. 

The surface to near surface phosphate mineralization identified in the trench work provides an excellent 
opportunity for easily accessible mineralization with appreciable thicknesses and grades.  There are several 
areas in the central part of the Bayóvar N°7 concession area where the surface to near surface phosphate 
showings correlate to beds PH01, PH02 and PH03 as observed in drilling.  These phosphate showings offer the 
potential for a surface to near surface mining scenario. Further work in this immediate area, including 
mechanical trenching using an excavator, is being recommended during 2015 exploration work on the property 
in order to expand upon this potential opportunity.   

The GrowMax Bayóvar Project requires additional drilling, mostly by drilling of infill drill hole, and analytical work 
to increase the Mineral Resource as well as to increase the level of confidence in the categorized Mineral 
Resources from Inferred to Indicated and Measured categories.

Report No. 1403265-TR 127  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - GROWMAX 
BAYOVAR PHOSPHATE PROJECT 

 

ITEM 26 RECOMMENDATIONS 
The 2014-2015 GrowMax Bayóvar Project logging and sampling program was successful in achieving the goals 
of phosphate mineralization evaluation and initial resource delineation.  In order to advance the project and 
expand the potential Mineral Resources Golder recommends that GrowMax proceed with conducting additional 
exploration drilling on 800 m centres in all three concession areas for the purpose of evaluating the potential to 
expand the estimated Mineral Resources.   

A component of the planned drilling should also focus on infill drilling on 400 m centres within the three 
previously drilled areas for the express purpose of upgrading the existing Indicated Mineral Resources to 
Measured Resources and the existing Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated and or Measured categories of 
Mineral Resources.   

The infill drilling program should also include a minimum of two holes that twin 2011 and 2012 drill holes for the 
purpose of verifying that there have been no material changes to the phosphorite bed analytical results relating 
to the prolonged core storage time prior to sampling and analyses. 

The lithology descriptions, depth intervals and analytical data from additional test pits and trenches located near 
the subcrop of the phosphorite beds should also be evaluated and incorporated into the geological modelling 
and Mineral Resource estimate where appropriate.   

Mechanical trenching using an excavator should be implemented, especially in the surface to near surface 
phosphorite showings in the central part of Bayóvar N°7 Concession which correlate with the phosphorite beds 
in the model, to further evaluate the continuity, lateral extent and thickness of the potential surface to near 
surface phosphate mineralization. 

The sampling and analytical program for both the exploration drilling and infill drilling should include a plan for 
collecting reliable moisture and relative density data for both the phosphorite beds and the diatomite beds.  This 
will allow site specific wet and dry density values to be used in the conversion from volumes to tonnes in future 
Mineral Resource estimates. 

Upon completion of the drilling and sampling programs the geological model, Mineral Resource estimate and the 
NI 43-101 Technical Report should be updated with any new results.  As part of the Mineral Resource estimate 
update Golder recommends that the statistical and geostatistical evaluation be revisited once additional drilling 
and analytical data are available to attempt to establish Mineral Resource categorization parameters that 
properly reflect the continuity of the GrowMax Bayóvar Project phosphorite thickness and grade parameters. 

Upon completion of the additional drilling and analytical program and the resultant updates to the geological 
model, Mineral Resource estimates and NI 43-101 Technical Report, Golder recommends that GrowMax 
evaluate the project with the intent of advancing the project towards Initiate Preliminary Economic Assessment 
and or Pre-Feasibility level modifying factors studies to allow for eventual Mineral Reserves estimation and 
reporting if supported by the modifying factors studies. 

The estimated budget to carry out the recommended work is summarized in Table 26.1, Estimated Budget for 
Recommended Additional Work.
