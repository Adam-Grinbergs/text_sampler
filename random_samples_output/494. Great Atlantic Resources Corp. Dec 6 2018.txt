Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 10 
 

1 SUMMARY 
The authors have been retained by Great Atlantic Resources Corp. (Great Atlantic) to prepare an 
independent Technical Report on the Company's Golden Promise Property (the "Property") 
located in the central region of Newfoundland, in  the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, 
Canada. The Property consists of 16 Mineral Licences, totalling 661 claims, which cover a 
significant trend of structurally-controlled, auriferous quartz vein occurrences and prospects 
within sedimentary units of the Victoria Lake Supergroup.  

This report provides a summary of all exploration and development work performed, and  results 
obtained, on the property to date, with recommendations for future work, based on the 
property's perceived gold exploration potential. The report was prepared in compliance with the 
reporting standards as set forth under National Instrument Policy NI 43-101 – Standards of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  Co-authors Larry Pilgrim (B.Sc., P.Geo.) and Greg Z. Mosher 
(P.Geo., M.Sc.App.) are considered a "Qualified Persons" as defined under this policy. 

Historical Work 

Historical exploration work conducted over the area now contained by the present Golden 
Promise Property was, collectively, carried out by Rubicon Minerals Corp. (Rubicon), and joint 
venture partners Placer Dome Canada Ltd (Placer Dome), Paragon Minerals Corp. (Paragon) and 
Crosshair Exploration & Mining Corp. (Crosshair), between 2002 and 2011. Work programs, 
consisting of prospecting, soil sampling, trenching and diamond drilling (totalling 152 drill holes), 
culminated in the discovery and partial delineation of several structurally-controlled, auriferous, 
quartz vein systems, the more significant (or explored) of which, is the Jaclyn Main Prospect. Two 
other prospects, having significant drilling to date, are the Jaclyn North and Linda-Snow White 
Prospects. 

A mineral resource estimate pertaining to the Jaclyn Main Zone prospect, prepared by Crosshair, 
in 2008, provided an Inferred estimate of 921,000 tonnes averaging 3.02 g/t gold or 89,500 ounces 
of contained gold (Pilgrim & Giroux, 2008). This mineral resource estimate was based on diamond 
drilling programs conducted from 2002 to 2007. Subsequent and final drilling on the Jaclyn Main 
Zone took place in 2010.  The results of that drill program are incorporated into the updated 
mineral resource estimate that is described in Section 14 of this report.  

In 2010, Crosshair extracted a 2,241tonne bulk sample (from the trenched surface expression of 
the zone) which produced an average grade of 4.47 g/t gold (Wallis, 2010). A longitudinal 
representation of the Jaclyn Main Zone, based on all drilling to date (2010), is included in Section 
6.1.5.1 of this report. 

During the late spring to early summer of 2017, Great Atlantic contracted geologist, David Martin 
(P.Geo) and assistant/prospector, Bruce Stewart, both of New Brunswick, to conduct 
preliminary/reconnaissance assessment work on various mineral licences of the property, and to 
implement a mechanical trenching program (on Mineral Licence 21281M). The latter program was 
designed to evaluate further east-northeastward extension of the historical Jaclyn North and 
Jaclyn South quartz vein systems. A third objective of the property visit was to provide a  due 
diligence assessment – by a  Qualified Person (David Martin, P. Geo) –  as to the nature the 
property's gold mineralization, host geology and exploration potential. In addition to general 
reconnaissance prospecting and sampling work, visits were made, by D. Martin, to the sites of the 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 11 
 

earlier-discovered, gold-bearing, quartz vein systems and high-grade (gold-mineralized) quartz 
float occurrences.  

Work was successful in locating several new gold-bearing quartz float occurrences as well as 
several single-station to multi-station gold (Au) and arsenic (As) soil anomalies for which follow-up 
investigations are recommended. Further to this, the author (W. Jacobs) was contracted to 
prepare assessment reports on the mineral licences investigated by D. Martin, and to assist with 
the trenching program by conducting geological mapping and sampling.  

Results of the trenching program proved interesting, although, deep glacial till cover precluded 
access to bedrock for the most part. The program was successful in exposing one of the Jaclyn 
North quartz veins (at one locality) while elsewhere along the projected trend, numerous 
auriferous quartz boulders (up to 0.7 metres in size) were exposed, several of which contained 
visible gold (VG). The angularity and local clustering of these boulders, at some localities – at 2.0-
3.0 m depths – suggest likely proximity to bedrock sources. Further investigation, by drilling, is 
warranted. 

Great Atlantic conducted additional reconnaissance prospecting and soil / rock geochemical 
sampling during 2018 on the property within multiple mineral licences, of which partial analytical 
results have been received. The program was conducted by Paul Delaney (P.Geo.) and assistant 
Art Clarke. David Martin (P.Geo.) conducted a portion of the prospecting / rock sampling. The 
program identified an area of gold soil anomalies within mineral licence 25161M in the southern 
region of the property, northeast of the Linda - Snow White prospect. 

Most of the drilling conducted on the property, to date, has been directed at evaluation of the 
Jaclyn Main Zone where common gold grades – citing narrow to wide (core length) intercepts – 
include: 44.59 g/t over 0.30m (GP03-31); 15.23 g/t over 0.30m (GP06-47); 68.95 g/t over 0.40m 
(GP02-21); 23.14 g/t over 0.90m (GP02-14); 93.71 g/t over 1.40m (GP06-52); 9.47 g/t over 1.40m 
(GP06-61); 20.65 g/t over 1.60m (GP06-65); 43.83 g/t over 1.45m (GP07-91); 5.24 g/t over 1.70m 
(GP06-51); 16.57 g/t Au over 2.55m (GP02-01); 6.51 g/t over 3.10m (GP06-56); and 10.41 g/t Au 
over 4.70m (GP07-92). Local, exceptionally high, grades include up to 327.97 g/t Au/0.2m (GP06-
52).  

Geological Setting 

Regional geology maps, by government, show the Golden Promise Property to be underlain by 
dominantly arc-related, rift-basinal, volcanogenic and turbiditic clastic to argillitic sedimentary 
rocks of the Victoria Lake Supergroup. The latter comprises a significant portion of 
Newfoundland's central Dunnage Zone, a major tectonostratigraphic division of the Appalachian 
Orogen, composed of remnants of Cambrian-Ordovician, ophiolitic and volcanic, arc terranes of 
the ancient Iapetus Ocean basin. During subduction of the Iapetan crust and, thus, eventual 
closure of the basin – an event synonymous with the collision of the Laurentian (proto North 
American) and Gondwanan (proto northwest Africa/Amazonian) continental land masses – these 
terranes were tectonically assembled and accreted to Laurentia, which developments lasted from 
the Ordovician (Taconic) Orogeny to the Silurian (Salinic) Orogeny. 

Volcanic arc elements of the peri-Laurentian and peri-Gondwanan domains are now represented 
by the Notre Dame and Exploits Subzone divisions of the Dunnage Zone, respectively. The same 
were juxtaposed together along a major (Appalachian-scale) collisional boundary, and suture zone,

known as the Red Indian Line (RIL). This structure lies proximal to, and, in part, contiguous with, 
the northwestern margin of the Golden Promise Property.  

The development of the RIL, and related southeastward-directed thrust-fault panels, represent a 
plausible deep-rooted source zone and mechanism (fault-dominated conduit system) for gold-
bearing, hydrothermal, fluids responsible for the development of quartz vein systems on the 
property. Given the 1) uniformity, or similarity, of the property's favorable geology throughout – 
being underlain by structurally-prepared (folded and thrust-faulted) turbiditic sedimentary 
sequences, 2) the widespread occurrence of gold-bearing quartz float and gold-in-soil anomalies 
(for which there are, yet, no confirmed bedrock sources) and 3) the success rate by which 
trenching and drill hole testing have, thus far, led to the discovery of significant gold occurrences 
(despite deep glacial till cover), it can, therefore, be reasonably surmised that much potential 
remains for further significant gold discovery. As well, none of the presently-known auriferous 
quartz vein occurrences have, yet, been fully evaluated, or delineated, by drilling. These, 
therefore, remain as 'open-ended' targets for further investigation and expansion. The potential 
for economic gold mineralization on the property is further highlighted by the fact that its 
geological setting equates with that of other turbidite-hosted/slate-belt gold districts world-wide 
(eg. the Bendigo district of Victoria, Australia, and the Meguma district of Nova Scotia, Canada), 
which have been long-term, significant, gold producers.  

Current Resource Estimate 

The current mineral resource estimate for the Jaclyn Main Zone is based on assays from 107 
drillholes.  The zone was modelled as a single quartz vein that strikes east-west and dips steeply to 
the south.  Modelled vein thickness was based on true thickness derived from quartz vein 
intercepts.  The estimate is based on 220 assays that were composited to 135 one-meter long 
composites.  A bulk density of 2.7 g/cm3 was used.   Blocks in the model measured 15 meters east-
west, 1-meter north-south and 10 meters vertically.  The block model was not rotated.  Grades 
were interpolated using inverse-distance squared (ID2) weighting and a search ellipse that 
measured 100 meters along strike, two meters across strike and 50 meters vertically.  Grades were 
interpolated based on a minimum of two and a maximum of 10 composites with a maximum of 
one composite per hole so the grade of each block is based on at least two drillholes thereby 
demonstrating continuity of mineralization.  All resources were classified as Inferred because of 
the relatively wide spacing of drillholes through most of the zone. 

Because part of the vein is near surface the resource estimate was constrained by a conceptual 
open pit to demonstrate reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction.  Generic mining 
costs of US$2.50/tonne and processing costs of US$25.00/tonne were used together with a gold 
price of US$1,300/ounce.  A pit slope of 45° was assumed with no allowance for mining loss or 
dilution.  Based on the combined hypothetical mining and processing costs and the assumed price 
of gold, a pit-constrained  cutoff grade of 0.6 g/t was adopted.  For the underground portion of the 
resource a cutoff of 1.5 g/t was assumed.   

Table 1.1 is a summary of the estimated mineral resource for the Jaclyn Main Zone.  The table 
shows the total resource together with the pit-constrained and underground portions.  Note that 
the cutoff grade for the total resource is the weighted average of the pit-constrained  and 
underground cutoff grades.

Recommendations 

Mineral Licence 21218M 

Drilling of 10 holes, six on the Jaclyn Main Zone and four on Jaclyn North.  Budget: $207,535. 

Jaclyn Main Zone: The near-surface portion of eastern end of the zone has been tested by few 
drillholes and can reasonably be regarded as a valid exploration target.  Six (6) holes with an 
aggregate length of 900 meters are recommended to test this portion of the zone at depths of 
approximately 100 and 150 meters below surface to establish whether the vein is present at these 
depths and if present, whether it is mineralized.   

If successful, this drill program will enlarge the Jaclyn Main Zone but regardless will establish the 
reasonable limits of the zone. 

Mineral Licence 24015M 

Reconnaissance soil sampling.  Budget $75,505. 

Mineral Licence 24017M  

Reconnaissance soil sampling.  Budget $33,325. 

The total recommended budget for all three licences is $316,365.

2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Terms of Reference 
The authors have been retained by Great Atlantic Resources Corp. (Great Atlantic), to prepare an 
independent National Instrument 43-101-compliant Technical Report on the merits and status of 
its (gold-prolific, exploration-stage) Golden Promise Property, located central Newfoundland (Fig. 
2.1). The property consists of 16 contiguous Mineral Licences, totalling 661 claims (16,525 
hectares), acquired through various option agreements on existing properties in the area, followed 
by additional staking of Mineral Licences (consolidation), by Great Atlantic, in 2017 (Fig. 2.1 & 
Table 4.1).  

The Technical Report provides a summary of all assessment work performed on the property, to 
date – the bulk of which relates to exploration and development work conducted prior to the 
present property acquisition by Great Atlantic. This work, as covered under Section 6 (Historical 
Exploration and Results), was carried out by Rubicon Minerals Corp. and various joint venture 
partners, including Placer Dome Canada Ltd (Placer Dome), Crosshair Exploration & Mining Corp. 
(Crosshair) and Paragon Minerals Corp. (Paragon), between 2002 and 2011.  

W. Jacobs  visited the Property on a number of occasions — in company with geologist David 
Martin, P.Geo., (retained by Great Atlantic to conduct preliminary assessment and due diligence 
evaluations of the property, during May-June, 2017) and as a geologist contracted to conduct 
geological mapping and sampling during a mechanical trenching operation on the property, during 
June-July, 2017.  G. Mosher visited the Property on August 30, 2018 for a period of one day. 

The portions of this report prepared by W. Jacobs have been reviewed by Larry Pilgrim a 
"Qualified Person", as prescribed under NI 43-101 policy, and is independent of Great Atlantic 
Resources Corp., as per policy Section 1.5. Larry Pilgrim has previously prepared a 43-101 technical 
report on the Golden Promise Property in 2006 at the request of Rubicon Minerals Corporation 
and again co-authored has qualifying person on a 43-101 technical report for Crosshair Exploration 
and Mining Corporation in 2008.  

 

2.2 Technical Summary 
During 2002, prospecting activities conducted by property vendor, William Mercer, 10 kilometres 
(km) southwest of the town of Badger and the Trans Canada Highway, resulted in the discovery of 
several quartz fragments and boulders (also, herein, referred to as "float"), bearing abundant 
visible gold (VG) mineralization. These discoveries, which indicated the (probable) presence of 
local, or near-surface, bedrock quartz vein sources, constituted the basis of a property option 
agreement, between Rubicon and William Mercer, dated May 22, 2002.

A total of 24 claims (comprising Mineral Licences 8859M & 8864M) were staked by W. Mercer, 
during May 21 & 22, 2002, to cover the area of interest. This was followed by an additional 168 
(peripheral) claims (Lic. 8868M), staked by Rubicon, in which a 3.0 km 'area of interest' was 
granted to W. Mercer, as part of the option agreement (Fig. 2.3). A program of prospecting and 
soil geochemical sampling was, shortly, implemented by Rubicon, resulting in the delineation of 
several gold-bearing quartz boulder/float trends (glacial dispersion trains) and numerous 
geochemical gold anomalies. Follow-up trenching and diamond drill testing, in 2002, led to the 
discovery of the Jaclyn Main Zone (gold-bearing) quartz vein system, located within the area of the 
former Mercer Option, since replaced by Mineral Licence 21281M; the latter licence comprises the 
central portion of the northeastern half of the Golden Promise Property (Figs. 2.2 & 2.3). 

During 2003-2005, Rubicon formed a Joint Venture ("JV") partnership with Placer Dome, at which 
time soil geochemical programs were expanded to cover new areas, albeit, largely within the 
central Mercer Option. Again, follow-up trenching and/or drilling, conducted in response to 
geochemical soil and quartz float gold anomalies, resulted in the discoveries of the Jaclyn North, 
Jaclyn South and Christopher vein systems – the latter, however, having only two drill-hole tests, 
to date. A number of other auriferous quartz vein and quartz float occurrence, including the 
Justin's Hope, Shawn's Shot, and Northwest Target, as well as three (un-named) targets in the 
Jaclyn West area, have, likewise, received only cursory drill-hole investigations, with most sites 
revealing host-rock alteration similar to that occurring at the Jaclyn Zone; no drill investigation has, 
yet, been conducted in the area of the high-grade, gold-bearing Branden float occurrences, 
located 8.5 km northeast of the Jaclyn Zone.

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 18 
 

During October-November, 2003, Fugro Airborne Surveys Corp. was commissioned to conduct an 
8,250 line-km airborne Electromagnetic/Magnetic (EM/Mag) survey over the property. High-
resolution magnetic and EM conductivity/resistivity responses were evaluated in conjunction with 
geological mapping information (including that of an earlier regional government study) to provide 
an informative interpretation of the property's stratigraphic and structural setting (described in 
Section 7.2). 

Continued exploration programs over the central property area, beyond 2005, were conducted 
under new JV arrangements focusing, mainly, on drill delineation of the Jaclyn Main Zone,  Jaclyn 
East Extension, Jaclyn North Zone and, to a lesser extent, the Jaclyn South Zone. Over 50% of the 
holes drilled in this area encountered visible gold mineralization. 

Following termination of the Placer Dome option, in 2005, Rubicon secured a similar agreement, 
with Crosshair, lasting until the end of 2006, at which time Rubicon's interest in the project was 
transferred to Paragon Minerals Corp. – a company formed, by Rubicon, for divestment of its 
Newfoundland exploration assets. Paragon managed additional drilling programs (in partnership 
with Crosshair) on the Jaclyn Main and Jaclyn North zones, until 2007. Crosshair then 
commissioned a mineral resource estimate on the Jaclyn (Main) Zone, utilizing all relevant drill 
hole data covering the period 2002-2007. The same was completed by Larry R. Pilgrim (P.Geo., 
B.Sc.) and Gary H. Giroux (P.Eng., M.Sc.), on April 30, 2008, which provided an inferred mineral 
resource calculation of 921,000 tonnes averaging 3.02 g/t Au (89,500 oz. contained gold).  

Following a downturn in the exploration industry, beginning in 2007, no further work was 
conducted over the Jaclyn Zone area until drilling was resumed, by Crosshair, in February, 2010; 
final drilling was completed on the zone in May, 2010. During this time, some infill drilling was 
conducted along the central part of the Jaclyn Main Zone as well as along its projected east-
northeasterly extension (Jaclyn East Zone). This latest drilling established the auriferous Jaclyn 
Main quartz vein system as having a total 'open-ended' strike dimension of 975 m and an open 
vertical depth extension of 400 m (Sparkes, 2010). Descriptions of the Jaclyn Main and other 
prospects of the Golden Promise Property are presented in Section 8 (Deposits Types).  

The infill drilling, on the Jaclyn Main, was carried out in preparation for a planned bulk sample test 
performed by Crosshair, in November, 2010. The latter operation involved the extraction of a 
2,241-tonne bulk sample, from the (trenched) surface expression of the vein system, which 
returned an average grade of 4.47 g/t Au (Wallis, 2010).   

At the time of the 2003 Rubicon/Placer option agreement (on the original Golden Promise 
Property), adjoining claims to the southwest, also staked by Rubicon (in 2002) – comprising the 
South Golden Promise Property – were the subject of a separate option agreement, signed on 
February 14, 2003, with International Lima Resources Corp. (name changed to Crosshair 
Exploration & Mining Corp., March 1, 2004). Initial exploration work performed on the latter 
property area (originally consisting of Mineral Licences 9050M, 9051M & 9052M) was similar to, 
and concurrent with, that carried out to the northeast, under the Rubicon/Placer JV arrangement. 
This included an airborne EM/Magnetic survey (totalling 2,382.5 line-kms) flown by Fugro Airborne 
Surveys, in November, 2003.  

 

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 19 
 

As in the case of the former Golden Promise Property, reconnaissance prospecting and sampling 
over the former South Golden Promise Property, led to the identification of numerous gold and/or 
arsenic soil anomalies, as well the discovery of abundant, auriferous, quartz float. Follow-up 
trenching, at one of the soil anomalies (120 ppb Au), resulted in the discovery of the Linda/Snow 
White Gold Occurrence, in 2004 – a composite quartz vein system, up to 5 m wide, exposed over a 
170-metre northeast to east-northeast trend. Grab samples from the site returned numerous Au 
values in the range of 1.47-9.6 g/t Au, as well as a few exceptionally high values, of 41.67 g/t, 
105.28 g/t and 232 g/t Au. Channel sampling results, although not outstandingly high, for the most 
part, did produce a grade of 29.7 g/t Au over 0.5 m. A 2006 diamond drill program delineated the 
quartz vein zone over a strike trend of 280 m and to a vertical depth of 115 m, returning a best 
intercept of 19.5 g/t Au over 1.15 m (incl. 63.3 g/t Au /0.35 m) (Morgan, Pickett & Froude, 2006).  

Whereas all of the above-mentioned auriferous quartz vein occurrences are hosted by 
sedimentary rocks, a second discovery in the (former) South Golden Promise Property area, reveals 
numerous gold-bearing quartz veins cutting a gabbro intrusive. Here a gold showing, known as the 
Gabbro Occurrence, has yielded grab sample results of up to 2.62 g/t and 10.04 g/t Au, thus, 
highlighting the potential for other prospective gold environments in the general property area.  

Initial work, by Great Atlantic, on the Golden Promise Property, was carried out during May-June, 
2017, by geologist, David Martin (P. Geo) and assistant/prospector, Bruce Stewart, both of New 
Brunswick. The program consisted of preliminary/reconnaissance prospecting, rock and soil 
sampling, focused mainly around the sites, or general areas, of earlier-discovered (float and 
bedrock) quartz vein-hosted gold mineralization. The immediate objective of this work was to 
satisfy assessment requirements due on various mineral licences – 24015M, 24017M, 241018M, 
24021M, 21474M, 25067M, 21281M, 24305M & 21970M – while providing some measure of due 
diligence with respect to verifying earlier-reported gold occurrences and gaining some perspective 
on the exploration potential of the property geology in general. With respect to the work 
assessment on Mineral Licence 21281M, a mechanized trenching program was implemented, 
during June-July, 2017, to ascertain further east-northeastward strike extensions of the Jaclyn 
North and Jaclyn South (gold-bearing) quartz vein systems, partially defined by historical drilling.  

Project supervision and sampling activities during 2017 were directed by D. Martin, while trench 
mapping and additional sampling was carried out in 2017 by a co-author (W. Jacobs).  

Great Atlantic conducted additional reconnaissance prospecting and soil / rock geochemical 
sampling during 2018 on the property in multiple mineral licences, of which partial analytical 
results have been received. The program was conducted by Paul Delaney (P.Geo.) and assistant 
Art Clarke. David Martin (P.Geo.) conducted a portion of the prospecting / rock sampling. Paul 
Delaney (P.Geo.) supervised the program. 

A summary of the work performed by Great Atlantic, on the Golden Promise Property, is presented 
in Section 9 (Exploration). 

Drilling investigations, to date, have focused, mainly, on evaluation of the multiple quartz vein 
systems comprising the Jaclyn Zone (of Mineral Licence 21281M) and the Linda/Snow White Zone 
(Mineral Licence 21970M). These and other targets remain as 'open-ended' targets for future 
investigation; elsewhere, numerous, angular, gold-bearing, quartz fragments and boulders – 
representing frost-heaved and glacially-transported material – are widespread throughout the 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 20 
 

property area, attesting to the high probability of many, yet undiscovered, bedrock sources. 
Numerous boulder (grab sample) assays include values in the range of 10 g/t to 353.4 g/t Au.

3 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 

During the preparation of this report, the authors relied, mainly, on the sources of information 
listed above. In relation to the 2017 and 2018 mineral exploration work performed by Great 
Atlantic, the authors relied on communications with, and field and assay data obtained from, 
geologist, David Martin (P. Geo.) who had conducted work on a number of mineral licences 
comprising the Property area during May-June 2017 and 2018. That information/data was 
obtained for the purpose of preparing assessment reports (filed with the NL Department of Mines) 
on behalf of Great Atlantic. This assessment work comprises part of the present NI 43-101 report 
as detailed in Section 9 (2017 Exploration Program).  
 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 22 
 

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The property consists of 16 Mineral Licenses totaling 661 claims (16,525 hectares), contained 
within National Topographic Sheet (NTS) area 12A/16 (as shown in Fig. 2.2 and listed in Table 4.1). 
The claims extend from 1.5 to 34 km southwest of the Trans Canada Highway (TCH) and the town 
of Badger, located in central Newfoundland. 

Any proposed exploration on the property involving any disturbance of the environment, such as 
trenching, drilling, bulk sampling or line cutting, requires exploration approval from the 
Department of Natural Resources (through the Application for Mineral Exploration Approval), in 
which specifics of the proposed program(s) are outlined and submitted. This is routine practice 
which has covered previous such activities on the Golden Promise Property and exploration, in 
general, in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 

There are no known factors or risks that has affected (or is expected to affect) access, title, or the 
right or ability to perform work on the property. 

4.1 Claims Acquisition, Ownership and Status 
The northeastern section of the Golden Promise Property consists of 10 mineral licences (310 
claims) under option from William Mercer, of Grand Falls-Windsor, NL. These licences include

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Property Access 
The Golden Promise Property is quite accessible for the most part, being traversed – for nearly its 
entire northeast/southwest trend – by the Buchans Highway which exits the TCH at the town of 
Badger (Fig. 2.2). Also, a number of forestry/logging roads branch from the highway, providing 
additional access to the northwest. The Exploits River, which flows parallel and adjacent to the 
highway precludes direct access, by vehicle, to the southeastern claims. Thus, entrance into this 
area is best gained via logging roads (including network/secondary routes) which extend from the 
Exploits River bridge, at Grand Falls-Windsor, located roughly 35 km east of the mid-section of the 
property (Fig. 5.1). The south-southeasternmost claims may be more quickly reached via logging 
routes extending roughly 15 km northwest from the former Duck Pond Mine road.  
 
5.2 Climate 
The climate for Newfoundland is largely moderated by marine conditions of the Atlantic Ocean 
with, therefore, little incidence of extreme seasonal temperatures. In general, the island of 
Newfoundland experiences an average summer temperature of 16°C (intermittently up to 20°C) 
and winter temperature of around 0°C (occasionally down to -20C). Snowfall can be substantial 
during more moderate temperatures due to moisture-laden winds off the ocean. Pleasant outdoor 
working conditions, with occasional rainfall, generally persist from late spring to mid fall. 

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
The town of Badger (pop. 700), located on the TCH, 1.5 km east-northeast of the property, is 
conveniently located with respect to worker accommodations and equipment contract services. 
Important commercial/industrial centres for the region, however, are represented by the towns of 
Grand Falls-Windsor (pop. 14,170) and Gander (pop. 11,700), located 25 km and 135 km farther 
east along the TCH, respectively (Fig. 2.1). Gander is also recognized as an international airport 
centre. 

Exploration services for the region are based in the Springdale-Halls Bay area, roughly 70 km north 
of Badger, via the TCH (Fig. 2.1). These services include an assay laboratory (Eastern Analytical 
Ltd), diamond drilling companies, and line-cutting and geochemical sampling contractors. Mining-
related infrastructure for the area includes the recently-closed Duck Pond (Cu-Zn) mine/mill 
facilities (of Teck Resources Ltd), located at a road distance of roughly 42 km south-southwest of 
the property (Figs. 2.1 & 5.1), and a concentrate storage/shipping facility, at Goodyear's Cove, 
near Springdale; the latter facility is presently used by Rambler Mines (located on the nearby Baie 
Verte Peninsula) to ship copper and gold concentrate. The historical mining town of Buchans, 
located 35 km west of the southwestern end of the property, hosts a large government-run core 
storage facility.  

Two hydro-power transmission lines traverse the property area, including the newly-constructed 
(2017) Muskrat Falls hydro-electric transmission line which crosses the northeasternmost claims, 
and an older powerline crossing the central property area, just 2.0 km south of the Jaclyn Zone 
gold prospects (Figs. 2.2 & 5.1).   

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 29 
 

 

  Figure 5.1 - Property Location and Access. 

 

 

5.4 Physiography 
The entire property area is part of a broad valley system occupied by the northeast-flowing 
Exploits River (Figs. 2.2 & 5.2) which flows from an elevation of 130 m above sea level (ASL), in the 
southwest (near Red Indian Lake), to 100 m ASL, in the northeast (at Badger). The topography is 
characterized by mainly gently to moderately sloping, hilly terrain, with local flat areas, with steep 
hills present, locally, in the southwestern claims area. The northeastern one-third section of the 
property exhibits a gentle rise in elevation, to a maximum of 190 m ASL (northwest of the river), 
while the remaining southwestern section rises to 250 m ASL, northwest of the river, and 290 m 
ASL to the southeast – the latter area, having locally steep, prominent, hills/ridges just southwest 
of the confluence of the (large) Noel Paul's Brook with the Exploits River. The course of this brook, 
within the claims area, is marked by a steeply incised valley cutting north across the above-
mentioned hills/ridges (Fig. 2.2). Numerous, other, small to medium sized, brooks and streams 
enter the Exploits from the northwest and southeast throughout the property area.  
 
The property is heavily-forested, for the most part, with mature spruce and fir and lesser tamarack 
and birch, albeit with patchy, old to recent, cut-over areas and scattered small to large open bogs. 
Along the northeastern corner area of Lic. 25162M (far west-southwestern property area), 
extensive, NE-trending, linear, bogs are present, coinciding with the general trace of the 
regionally-extensive Red Indian Line tectonic structure. 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 30 
 

 

The northeastern one-third section of the property is largely devoid of forest cover due to a 
combination of 18-year-old forest fire effects and logging (salvaging) operations. Consequently, 
only scattered patches of mature forest exist in this area, mainly along streams and/or low valley 
areas, having been replaced in all other areas, by sparse young tree growth and extensive berry 
scrub.  
 
Another dominant, though less conspicuous, feature of the property is the presence of extensive 
glacial (gravel and boulder) till, varying in thickness, from shallow to deep (< 5m), thereby, 
resulting in little bedrock exposure. Glacial striae, craig and tail features, and stoss-and-lee forms 
indicate the last major ice-flow direction to be northeast (Sparkes & Vanderveer, 1980)(Fig. 5.3). 
Previous workers to the Golden Promise property have noted a glacial striae orientation of 058⁰ 
Azimuth (Newport, 2003).

6 HISTORY 
Apart from minor prospecting activities, no focused or detailed exploration efforts for gold or base 
metals were performed over the present property area prior to 2002. However, in 1966, the area 
was part of a regional (640 sq. mi.) airborne EM/Mag survey, by Selco Exploration Co. Ltd/ 
McIntyre Porcupine Mines Ltd (Lazenby, 1966), that extended from Red Indian Lake (19 km WSW 
of the present property) to the Grand Falls area, 30 km to the east. The survey was the first to 
reveal the regional extent and general folded outline of the (conductive) Caradocian shale 
sequence.  

A forest fire which swept the northeastern property area (west of the Buchans Highway), in 1999, 
followed by several years of timber salvaging operations, resulted in enhanced ground visibility 
and exposure which favoured prospecting investigations by former Badger resident, and 
prospector, William Mercer. During mid-May, 2002, W. Mercer reported the discovery of 
abundant angular quartz float (boulders), containing significant amounts of visible gold, in the 
immediate area of the later-discovered Jaclyn Zone (quartz vein) prospects. A combined sample of 
several of the float material returned an assay of approx. 30 g/t Au, prompting W. Mercer to stake 
Mineral Licences 8859M and 8864M (totalling 24 claims) on May 21 and 22, 2002 (Fig. 2.3).  

Immediately following the above staking, W. Mercer entered into a "Letter Agreement" with 
Rubicon Minerals Corp., whereby Rubicon – in exchange for granting W. Mercer certain payments 
of cash and shares (of Rubicon) –  would acquire a 100% interest in the Mercer Licences (8859M & 
8864M) and stake a surrounding "area of mutual interest" (subsequently Mineral Licence 8868M); 
the same would provide W. Mercer a 3 km "area of influence", peripheral to the earlier licences, 
whereupon all three licences would be subject to the same terms and conditions of the "Letter 
Agreement". Additional, contiguous, mineral licences were then staked by Rubicon, between June 
22, 2002 and October 4, 2002, over the favoured northwestern fringe area of the Victoria Lake 
Supergroup (Fig. 2.3). 

During 2002-2004 a number of gold occurrences were discovered, on the Mercer Option, which 
underwent preliminary drilling investigations, by Rubicon (2002) and, later, by joint venture (JV) 
partners Rubicon and Placer Dome Canada Ltd (2003-2004). Further advanced drilling, involving 
other JV arrangements, took place on the Jaclyn Zone prospects between (and inclusive of) 2006 
and 2010 (as detailed in the Sections 6.1 and 6.2).  

Coinciding with the earlier work on the Mercer Option, Rubicon entered into a separate joint 
venture agreement (on Feb 14, 2003) with International Lima Resources Corp. (now Crosshair 
Exploration & Mining Corp., as of Mar 1, 2004), on its southwestern-most claims group (South 
Golden Promise Property). Here, another significant (gold-bearing) quartz vein system, known as 
the Linda-Snow White prospect, was discovered, by Crosshair, in 2004, and drilled in 2006. Given 
these separate developments, a chronological account of the historical work performed on the 
present Golden Promise Property is best presented, separately, for the northeastern and 
southwestern property areas, as follows. 

 

 

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 34 
 

6.1 Northeastern Golden Promise Property area (2002-2010) 
6.1.1 Rubicon Minerals Corp. (2002-2003) 
In May, 2002, Rubicon Minerals Corp. acquired an option on the property based on the above-
mentioned Mercer discovery. During June and July 2002, the company conducted a property-wide 
prospecting program to determine the source of the gold-bearing quartz float. This led to the 
identification, initially, of a 650 m long, ENE-trending, 'glacial quartz-boulder train' coincident with 
the trace of the later-discovered Jacyln Main quartz vein system. Grab samples of the surficial 
quartz float material, measuring up to 1.5 m in size, returned several assays in the range of 10-20 
g/t Au and one at 353.4 g/t Au. Subsequently, two sub-parallel, boulder trains of gold + 
arsenopyrite-bearing quartz were discovered approx. 250 m north and 300 m south of the Jaclyn 
Main zone, which sites now comprise the Jaclyn North and Jaclyn South quartz vein zones, 
respectively (Moore, 2003). The overlying boulder trains converge along a common trend 500 m 
northeast of the prospect area (Fig. 6.1).  

Subsequent to the above discoveries, Rubicon conducted a 20 km ground geophysical 
(magnetic/VLF-EM) survey over the Jaclyn zone area utilizing a 070°-oriented grid baseline (parallel 
to the trend of the mineralized float) with cross-lines at 50-100 m intervals (Fig. 6.1). A 2.0 km IP 
survey was also completed within the same grid. The surveys, however, were not considered 
effective due to limited coverage which precluded sufficiently wide (areal) representation of units 
and/or structures to enable reliable interpretations.  

[Note, the above-mentioned terms Jaclyn North, Jaclyn Main and Jaclyn South zones are 
collectively referred to as the Jaclyn Zone. For the sake of brevity (and on account of their 
numerous mentions in the following sections), these individual zones are, respectively, referred to 
under the following abbreviations – JN, JM & JS or JNZ, JMZ & JSZ, accordingly].

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 36 
 

6.1.1.1   2002 Trenching Program       

 

During July, 2002, a total of 9 trenches were excavated over the Jaclyn Zone in an attempt to 
expose a bedrock source for the gold-bearing quartz float. This included 7 trenches, along the JM 
quartz float train, and one, each, at the JN and JS zones (Mullen, 2003) (Fig. 6.1).  
 
One trench at the JMZ exposed a 1-2 m thick quartz vein system (with abundant visible gold) over 
a distance of 22 m "within a sequence of relatively flat-lying mudstone and greywacke. A narrow 
mafic dyke was exposed next to the vein" (Mullen, 2003). "Adjacent trenches failed to expose any 
bedrock due to deep overburden and rapid water inflow" (Copeland & Newport, 2004). The JS 
trench exposed a 6 cm wide quartz-sulphide vein (assaying 38 ppb Au) and a 2 cm quartz-pyrite 
veinlet (assaying 31 ppb Au) that cut shallow-dipping (10-30°) arkosic sediments. The JN trench 
exposed steeply-dipping (70°), dark grey to black, siliceous sediments with local graphitic seams, 
and a 17 cm wide zone of semi-massive to nodular pyrite (Mullen, 2003).  
 
6.1.1.2   2002 Drilling Program    

During August-Sept, 2002, a 21-hole diamond drill program (GP02-1 to 21) was implemented at 
the JM zone (Figs. 6.1 & 6.2). Seventeen holes intersected quartz veining, fifteen of which 
encountered visible gold. This first-phase drilling defined the vein system over a minimum strike 
distance of 225m and to a minimum vertical depth of 50-60m, with intersections of up to 16.57 g/t 
Au over 2.55m  and 68.95 g/t Au over 0.40m (Copeland et al., 2004). The auriferous vein was 
found to strike generally 080° and dip steeply to the south, cutting siliceous mudstone, siltstone 
and greywacke. A summary of drill-hole depths and significant mineralized intersections is 
presented in Table 6.1.  
 
[Note: for the following drill-core gold (Au) assay grades, presented throughout this report, results 
are given as the weighted average (fire assay) analysis of the +150 and -150 (screen)-mesh sized 
sample fractions. As with most all other rock samples herein reported that are strongly suspected 
of hosting gold –  as per criteria outlined in Section 11 or as predetermined by regular fire assay 
analytical technique – the same are selected for metallics screen preparation whereby the entire 
sample is pulverized and separated into two size fractions by a standard mesh-size screen/sieve 
(150 mesh); the separate fractions are specified, for example, as +150 mesh (coarse) and -150 
mesh (fine). Following this procedure, each fraction is separately weighed and analyzed by Fire 
Assay Au, with results then used to calculate a combined (weighted-average) assay result. The two 
size fractions are separately analyzed to ensure capture of all gold (particularly coarse grains) that 
may otherwise be excluded (or 'screened out') from normal sample mediums prepared for 
analyses. Also, reported drill-intersection sample widths relate to 'core lengths' which do not 
necessarily reflect 'true widths' (TW) – unless a mineralized zone is intersected perpendicularly. 
Thus, all results are given as 'core length' intersections unless otherwise specified as TW].

6.1.2 Rubicon Minerals Corp./Placer Dome Canada Ltd (2003-2005) 
On August 29, 2003 Rubicon signed a JV agreement with Placer Dome Canada Ltd (Placer) whereby 
Placer could earn a 70% interest in the property, albeit, with Rubicon remaining as project 
operator.  
 
6.1.2.1   2003 Airborne Geophysical Survey 

During Oct 21 to Nov 19, 2003, Rubicon and Placer commissioned Fugro Airborne Surveys Corp. to 
conduct an 8,250 line-km EM/Resistivity/Magnetic airborne survey over the (formerly more 
expansive) Golden Promise property which extended up to 24 km east beyond the present 
property boundary (Fig. 7.9).  
 
The Resistivity EM survey was useful in outlining the trace of the (conductive) graphitic Caradocian 
shale sequence which further revealed pronounced NE/SW-trending local and regional-scale fold 
structures and displacement features representing favorable loci for quartz vein-hosted gold 
mineralization. "Abrupt transitions from high resistivity to low resistivity units" (as can be seen in 
Fig. 6.3  ) mark the contact between siliciclastic rocks and the overlying (generally 450 m wide) 
Caradocian unit (Steele, 2011 & Copeland et al, 2004). Structural discontinuities interpreted from 
both the airborne EM and magnetic surveys were targeted for follow-up prospecting and sampling 
activities.  

6.1.2.2   2003 Soil Sampling, Prospecting and Rock Sampling  

Jaclyn Zone 

During Oct-Dec, 2003, a soil sampling program, utilizing 100m-spaced lines and 25m sample 
stations (L47+00E-56+00E, 45+00-55+00N), was implemented over the Jaclyn zone area in advance 
of further planned drilling. Eleven samples returned strongly anomalous Au assays in the range of 
15 ppb to 8995 ppb. Significant multi-station gold anomalies, of greater than 15 ppb, were 
obtained on all lines crossing the known extent of the JM. Anomalous soil assays of up to 102 ppb 
and 273 ppb Au were obtained over the Jaclyn East area. No anomalous gold geochemistry was 
obtained over the JN and JS zones. However, a newly-sampled quartz boulder from the JN zone did 
return an assay of 4 g/t Au (Copeland et al., 2004).

Branden, Shawn's Shot &  Justin's Hope Occurrences 
 
Property-wide prospecting along the NE/SW structural trend encompassing the Jaclyn Zone 
prospect, led to the discovery of numerous (additional) high-grade gold-bearing quartz boulders 
up to 8 km 'down-ice' and 'up-ice' from the prospect. However, with the exception of the area of 
the Shawn's Shot (gold) occurrence (located 7.5 km SW of the Jaclyn Zone; Figs. 6.3 & 6.4), the 
2003 prospecting program was focused mainly to the northeast of the Jaclyn. Approx. 3.5-4.2 km 
northeast of the latter, several anomalous Au assays were obtained from an extensive quartz float, 
glacial dispersion, train comprising the Justin's Hope Occurrence (Figs. 6.3 & 6.4) – site of a 335.9 
g/t Au (9.8 oz/t) assay obtained by W. Mercer. New sample results included 10.2 g/t Au and 116 
ppb Au (for quartz float) as well as several values up to 40 ppb Au (for float of quartz and arkosic 
sediments cut by quartz veins/veinlets). Approx. 0.7 km NE of the 335.9 g/t Au sample site, 
another quartz float sample returned 99 ppb Au.

Figure 6.4 - Geological units and gold occurrences of the Golden Promise Property area.  

 

Geological interpretations, based on the 2003 airborne EM survey results (and later drilling results, 
discussed below) reveal the Jaclyn-Justin's Hope trend to be underlain by folded Caradocian shales 
disposed along the axial trace of the Jaclyn Anticline (Fig. 6.4). In the Justin's Hope area, the 
Caradocian shales are reportedly interbedded with, and overlain by, the Badger Group sediments.  

Approx. 4.5 km northeast of the Justin's Hope Occurrence, more gold-bearing, quartz float, hosting 
trace to 1% pyrite & arsenopyrite, were discovered over a 100 m long  (040°-oriented) glacial 
dispersion train known as the Branden Occurrence (Fig. 6.4). Gold assay results from the quartz 
float samples include 80.73 g/t, 72.1 g/t, 62.6 g/t, 22.6 g/t and 20.5  g/t Au.  

Prospecting carried out by W. Mercer, along the Exploits River, 7.5 SW of the Jaclyn Zone, resulted 
in the discovery of the Shawn's Shot (gold-bearing) quartz vein occurrence (Fig. 6.4). The 
occurrence consists of a poorly-exposed, 0.35-0.4 m wide, quartz vein located on the west bank 
and riverbed where loose subcrop debris (derived from the vein) revealed abundant visible gold 
and returned an assay of 34 g/t Au.

6.1.2.3   2003 Trenching Program      

During Oct 28 to Nov 4, 2003, a total of six trenches (GPTR-01 to 06) were collectively emplaced 
over the JN and JS (Au-bearing) boulder trains (Figs. 6.1 ). One of two trenches at the JN zone (GP-
TR-01 & 02) and three of four at the JS zone (GP-TR-03 to 05) encountered bedrock, each revealing 
interbedded black to greenish-grey mudstone, greywacke and arkosic sandstone. At the JN zone, a 
1.0 m wide quartz vein swarm (with 1-3 cm wide veins) was found associated with a narrow 
deformation zone within argillite. Although visible gold-bearing quartz boulders were found 
overlying the trenched bedrock, no gold (or arsenopyrite) were observed in the bedrock veins 
itself. At the JS zone, numerous 1-4 cm wide quartz veins were observed in connection with zones 
of weak alteration (Copeland et al., 2004).

prospects (After Tettelaar, 2010). 

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 42 
 

A trenching investigation was also conducted at the Justin's Hope Occurrence, where three closely-
space pits were excavated near the site of the high-grade (gold-bearing) quartz float site (335.9 g/t 
Au)(Fig. 6.7). Only one of the pits encountered bedrock revealing unaltered black mudstone with 
insignificant quartz veining. No trench samples were taken.  

6.1.2.4   2003 Drilling Program  

During October 2003 - December 2003, twelve holes were drilled by JV partners Rubicon Minerals 
and Placer Dome in the Jaclyn area, including nine holes (GP03-22 to 30) at the JMZ, one hole 
(GP03-32) at the JNZ and two holes (GP03-31 & 33) at the JSZ (Figs. 6.1 & 6.2). The JN and JS Zones 
are located 250 m north, and 300 m south, of the JMZ, respectively. The relative location and 
attitudes of the three main quartz vein systems, based on the discovery holes, are shown in 
Fig.6.5. Highlights of the 2003 drilling program are presented in Table 3.  
 
At the JM zone, drilling confirmed further extension of the large quartz vein system with newly-
revised 'opened-ended' dimensions tottaling 375 m of strike length and 192 m of vertical depth. 
Eight of the twelve holes encountered significant amounts of visible gold with assays up to 18.18 
g/t Au /0.6 m (GP03-25) and 11.16 g/t Au /1.6m (GP03-24)(Copeland et al. 2005). 

Table 6.2 - Rubicon Minerals Corp./Placer Dome Canada Ltd - 2003 Drilling Program. 

 

At the JN zone, drill-hole GP03-32 intersected four separate quartz vein zones, three of which 
contain visible gold, being hosted by silica/sericite-altered greywacke and mudstone. This initial 
drill hole, however, was determined to have been drilled down-dip, thus, obliquely cross-cutting 
the north dipping stratigraphy (Fig. 6.6). [The veins were later defined (during the 2006 drilling) as 
comprising three subzones – the Upper, Middle and Lower Subzones (Fig. 6.5)(see Section 
6.1.3.1)]. The widest intersection of quartz was 2.8 m (1.0 m true width) within a 10 m (core 
length) section of stringer quartz veining. "Three separate veins returned max. assays of 12.13 g/t 
Au /0.3 m (41.4-41.75m), 12.30 g/t Au/0.3 m (85.35 85.65) and 7.42 g/t Au /0.5 m (119.0-119.5).

At the JS zone, drill holes GP03-31 and 33, spaced 100m apart, encountered strongly silicified and 
sericitized, interbedded, greywacke and mudstone cut by three gold-bearing quartz veins, one of 
which revealed visible gold. The upper (larger) Alpha vein, intersected over a 3.4 m interval (est. 
3.0 m true width), at 75.1-78.5 m (GP03-31), returned only low Au values (max. 0.12 g/t Au). Two 
narrower quartz veins (referred to as the Beta Veins), intersected at depths of 25 m and 50 m 
beyond the Alpha Vein, produced assays of: 44.59 g/t Au/0.3 m (or 8.92 g/t Au diluted over 1.5

6.1.2.5   2004 Soil Sampling Program      

During early spring of 2004, Rubicon and Placer implemented a soil sampling program over the 
Jaclyn - Justin's Hope structural trend (Fig. 6.6 & 6.7) – an area inferred to be underlain by the 
Caradocian Shale unit. This inference is based largely on the presence of a pronounced 'resistivity 
low', as revealed by the 2003 airborne geophysical survey (Figs. 6.3 & 6.6). Furthermore, this trend 
defines the axial trace of the Jaclyn Anticline. Soils were taken along 200 m-spaced lines, utilizing 
25m-stations, for a total of 1402 samples. A 32 ppb Au soil sample value was obtained in proximity 
to quartz float assaying 335.9 g/t Au (Moore, 2003).  

At the Branden quartz boulder train occurrence, located 4.5 km farther NE, a total of 167 soils 
were collected on eight, 100m-spaced, recce lines (Fig. 6.8). Five widely spaced elevated to 
anomalous Au values, of 7 ppb, 8ppb, 18 ppb, 55 ppb and 177 ppb, were obtained (Copeland et al, 
2004 & 2005). 

During the summer of 2004, an additional 1000 soil samples were collected over the Jaclyn West 
(JW) area to assess the possibility of west-southwestward continuation of the JM, JN and JS vein 
systems (Fig. 6.9 ). Over 17% of the quartz float taken around the general to immediate area of the 
later-discovered Christopher Vein (located 400 m SW of the JM zone) produced Au values greater 
than 150 ppb, with 5.8% yielding greater than 0.5 g/t Au (Copeland et al, 2005). This area was also 
found to contain abundant  quartz subcrop material (discovered by W. Mercer, in 2003) which 
produced grab sample assays up to 3.8 g/t Au and 4240 ppm As.  
 
6.1.2.6   2004 Prospecting, Rock Sampling and Trenching Program 

Jaclyn West Area 

Prospecting carried out in response to anomalous soil geochemistry in the JW area, led to the 
discovery of two ENE-trending (070°) quartz boulder trains, including: an approx. 250m-long, 
quartz-float trend, located less than 1.0 km WSW of (and aligned with) the JS zone; and a 150m-
long boulder train located 1.5 km WSW of the JM (Fig. 6.9).The latter consists of both subcrop and 
float of quartz- breccia material hosting up to 10% pyrite and 2% chalcopyrite. These and other 
quartz float occurrences in the JW area reveal common laminated and/or stylolitic textures 
(typical of vein margins) and vuggy textures (typical of massive quartz vein centers) – similar to 
that occurring at the Jaclyn Zone.  
 
In addition to the above, large angular boulders of milky white quartz (up to 0.8 x 0.8 m size), with 
mudstone wallrock fragments enclosed, were discovered roughly 800 m southwest (240°) of the 
above-mentioned quartz-breccia train. Sample assays of up to 162 ppb Au were obtained from 
these, though no visible mineralization was observed (Copeland et al., 2005). 
 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 44 
 

During early fall, 2004, a total of 6 trenches (GP-TR-08 to 13) were emplaced in the Jaclyn West 
area, each revealing weakly to strongly altered, interbedded, mudstone, greywacke and arkosic 
sandstone. 
 
Christopher Zone 
The above-mentioned soil (Au) anomalies and subcroppings of quartz, located 400 m southwest of 
the JM (Fig. 6.9), prompted a trenching investigation which led to the discovery of the Christopher 
Vein. The initial trench (GP-TR-10) revealed a 2 m wide, composite, gold-bearing quartz vein 
system having an 'exposed' strike trend of 35 m, at 080°/75° S, within silica/carbonate/ 
sericite/chlorite-altered greywacke. It is similar to the Jaclyn Zone veins in that it exhibits a 
generally massive core with laminated/stylolitic-textures along the vein margins. Sulphides consist 
of up to 2% pyrite and trace to 2% arsenopyrite occurring as "disseminated anhedral masses near 
angular wallrock inclusions, and as disseminated euhedral grains within, and proximal to, stylolitic 
laminae" (Copeland et al, 2005). The highest grab sample assay, following trenching, was 1.96 g/t 
Au from the southern margin of the vein where, in fact, visible gold was noted. Channel sampling, 
however, produced only slightly elevated to moderately elevated Au results, for the most part (10-
90 ppb Au over 0.5-1.0m intervals), with best assays at 280 ppb Au /0.55 m and 620 ppb Au /0.44 
m (Copeland et al., 2005).  

 

A trench (GP-TR-11), emplaced 100 m east of the Christopher Vein, revealed sandstone 
transitioning southwards to greywacke, with coincident increasing silicification and minor pyrite-
arsenopyrite mineralization. No eastward extension of the vein was encountered in the trench, 
though the aforementioned 'southward increasing alteration' was considered as a possible 
indication of the vein being located farther south (no trenching was done to test this possibility). 
Three grab samples taken of the silicified (trench) exposure returned a best assay of 19 ppb Au. 
[Discovery of the Christopher is said to "potentially extend the Jaclyn Zone to over 775 m in strike 
length" (Copeland et al, 2005)]. 
 
A second trench site (GP-TR-08), located 50 m to the west of the Christopher vein exposure, 
revealed Fe-carbonate altered greywacke with quartz-carbonate veins (< 3cm wide)  "similar to 
that exposed at Christopher" (Copeland et al, 2005). Little investigation of the trench could be 
carried out due to flooding which precluded bedrock mapping and sampling.

Rip Pond 
At the eastern side of Rip Pond (approx. 700 m NNW of the Christopher Vein)(Fig. 6.9), quartz 
float containing up to 20% chalcopyrite, pyrite and arsenopyrite, were found hosted by graphitic 
shales, thereby, suggesting potential for vein-hosted gold within the Caradocian shale unit as well 
as in the usual underlying siliciclastic/turbiditic units. Six of nine samples collected of the shale-
hosted quartz vein material returned values of >150 ppb Au, the highest being 1.4 g/t Au. Other 
(associated) elevated to anomalous metal concentrations included up to 2.74% Cu, 1565 ppm Co, 
4450 ppm As, 11 ppm Sb, 6.2 ppm Ag and 37 ppm Bi.

Northwest Zone 
The Northwest Zone lies roughly 175 m southeast of Rip Pond, at a distance of 450 m west of 
(along strike from) the JN Zone (Fig. 6.9 ). Here, abundant, laminated-textured, quartz float, 
bearing up to 3% arsenopyrite, was found along the contact zone between the Caradocian 
graphitic shale and the underlying siliciclastics (on the northern limb of the Jaclyn Anticline). Of the 
nine samples collected here, eight produced elevated to anomalous Au values, the highest being 
98 ppb, 34 ppb and two values at 25 ppb Au. Soil sample results from the area included Au values 
up to 110 ppb.  

Shawn's Shot Occurrence 
Prospecting and sampling were also carried out in the area of the Shawn's Shot gold-bearing  
quartz vein located on the Exploits River, 7.5 km southwest of the Christopher zone. Geologically,  
it lies on the northwestern limb of the NE-plunging Exploits Anticline (Fig. 6.4). The vein, which  
outcrops along the west-side riverbank (and riverbed), was first discovered by W. Mercer, in 2002  
– its exposure, then consisting of loose subcrop quartz material hosting abundant visible gold on  
laminated/banded surfaces. A grab sample collected by Mercer yielded an assay of 34 g/t Au  
(resampling of the same, in 2003, produced assays of 14 g/t and 30 g/t Au). Hand trenching, in 
2004, helped to determine a more clearly-defined vein having a width of 0.3-0.4 m and an 
'exposed' trend of 2.0m, at 110°/67-78°S, before disappearing into the deeper section of the river. 
Four grab samples of the vein, taken in 2004, produced assays of >150 ppb Au, the highest being 
100.5 g/t Au; elevated Ag and As up to 4.5 ppm and 1230 ppm, respectively, were associated. An 
outcrop of black shale was reported 1.5 m from the occurrence, having fractures which trend sub-
parallel to the vein. Other (1-15 cm wide) quartz veins were located 250 m northeast of the 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 48 
 

occurrence within "tightly chevron-folded, graphitic, black shale and sandstone" showing "small 
scale examples of breached anticlines" (i.e., quartz veins occupying breaks developed along 
anticlinal hinges). These also trend sub-parallel to the Shawn's Shot vein occurrence (Copeland et 
al, 2005).

Otter Brook Showing  

Approx. 5.0 km southeast of the Shawn's Shot Occurrence, another 0.3 m wide quartz breccia vein, 
named the Otter Brook showing (Fig. 6.4 ) – first discovered by S. Courtney, in 1996 – lies at the 
contact/transition zone between siliciclastic sediments and overlying Caradocian shales. A grab 
sample assay of 880 ppb Au was obtained by Courtney at that time. Sampling of the occurrence, 
by Rubicon, in 2002 (at which time a property option was acquired), produced grades of 3.2 g/t 
and 1.183 g/t Au. Reports by Rubicon describe the occurrence as consisting of a 5-20 cm wide 
quartz breccia vein, oriented 060/65°SE, that was traced for approx. 10 m within rust-stained, 
siliceous, mudstone and chert. The zone contains angular wallrock inclusions and, locally, vuggy 
textures with 1-5% pyrite, up to 2% chalcopyrite and trace arsenopyrite associated. Further 
sampling of the occurrence, in 2004, returned grades of up to 2.2 g/t Au (Copeland, 2004). 
 
Branden Occurrence 
A revisit of the Branden glacial quartz boulder train, in 2004, yielded grab sample (Au) assays of 
72.1 g/t, 62.6 g/t, 22.6 g/t and 20.5 g/t Au, with corresponding arsenic (As) values of 1125 ppm, 
469 ppm, 481 ppm & 1195 ppm). Three trenches were emplaced over the site (Fig. 25) – the first 
targeting "the centre and high-grade part of the boulder train where quartz float assayed up to 
80.7 g/t Au in 2003" (Copeland et al, 2005). Unfortunately, rapid water inflow forced the 
abandonment of this trench before bedrock could be assessed. The two other trenches were 
excavated 40 and 120 m farther up-ice (230°), respectively, each revealing interlayered, fine to 
coarse grained, sandstone-greywacke and shale with a bedding orientation of 020/40°W. A 1.5 m 
wide mafic dyke, trending 088°, intrudes the sedimentary units in the trench nearest the Branden, 
while a pyrite-bearing, greyish-purple, porphyry intrusive (of undisclosed composition) was 
reported to be present in the southwestern trench (Copeland et al., 2005). Glacial striations (020-
030°) noted in each of the latter two trenches indicate each to be off-trend with respect to the 
'up-ice' source direction for the high grade, gold-bearing Branden boulder train (Fig. 6.8). Any 
future trenching attempt to assess the possibility of a local bedrock source for the boulders 
should, therefore, be situated farther east to align with the projected 'up-ice' trend. 
 
Copeland et al (2005) suggested that the Branden trench exposures are representative of  VLSG-
type rocks and may, therefore, constitute an erosional 'window' by which the same are exposed 
through the younger, overlying, Badger Group sediments. Based on the structural interpretations 
of McNeill (2005), he suggests such exposure may be facilitated by a 'doming' effect created by a 
doubly-plunging F1 anticlinal feature that underlies the area (See Figs. 7.10d & e).   
 
Jaclyn Zone 
Although minor prospecting was carried out in the Jaclyn area, in 2004, three new quartz float 
samples were discovered less than 500 m to the NE of the zone, yielding assays of 45.5 g/t Au, 
24.5 g/t and 16.3 g/t Au (Copeland et al, 2005).

6.1.2.7   2004 Drilling Program     
The 2004 drilling (final drilling under the Rubicon/Placer JV partnership) consisted of two phases – 
a 5-hole program targeting the Justin's Hope and Jaclyn East areas, during April-May, and a 8-hole 
program covering the Christopher, Northwest Zone, Jaclyn West and Shawn's Shot areas, during 
November-December, 2004.  
 
 Table 6.3 - Rubicon Minerals Corp./Placer Dome Canada Ltd - 2004 Drilling Program 

 

 
Justin's Hope 

Two holes (GP04-34 & 35) were drilled approx. 750 m apart (along a SW/NE trend) over the 
general area of the Justin's Hope boulder train site (Fig. 6.7). Both holes encountered mainly black 
(Caradocian) shales with lesser greywacke, however, with several intrusions of quartz-feldspar 
porphyry (QFP) in GP04-34 (located to the SW) and several mafic dykes in GP04-35 (to the NE). The 
QFP units ranged mainly between <1.0m to > 4.0m in width, with the exception of a 60.6 m wide 
unit at 68.9-129.5 m depth. Only one (0.3m-wide) quartz-calcite vein was intersected in this hole. 
Hole GP04-35 encountered several quartz-calcite veins (0.55-1.9m in width) cutting shale, 
however, no pyrite or arsenopyrite were found associated with the veins; assays returned only 
slightly elevated to 'detection limit' values for Au (Copeland et al., 2004). Drilling revealed very 
deep overburden at the sites, (over 15 m true depth), thus, precluding the likelihood of a local 
bedrock source for the mineralized quartz float. The mineralized float is, therefore, considered to

The second phase drilling for 2004 began with 2 holes (GP04-39 & 40) at the Christopher Zone 
(Jaclyn West area) (Figs. 6.2 & 6.9). These were positioned to test the down dip and easterly 
projection of the 2.0 m wide vein exposed by the 2004 trenching.  
 
Drill-hole GP04-39, drilled beneath the trench, intersected altered lithic/arkosic greywacke with 
minor lenses/layers of mudstone cut by mainly 1-3 cm wide quartz-calcite veins and occasional 2-7 
cm quartz veins. Alteration consists of patchy or spotted ankerite (Fe-carbonate) and chlorite with 
associated minor pyrite and arsenopyrite mineralization. A quartz vein breccia/fault zone, 
intersected at a depth of 73 m (vertical depth of 28m), was interpreted as a possible continuation 
of the Christopher Vein/Zone, given the vein's down-dip projection based on its indicated 75°S dip 
at surface. The zone consists of a 0.7 m section of brecciated greywacke, with angular quartz vein 
fragments, cut by later-generation quartz-calcite-chlorite veins/veinlets; it returned an assay of 
0.03 g/t Au/0.7 m (73.2-73.9m). The later-generation quartz-calcite-chlorite veins, however, 
continue throughout the remainder of hole (to 178.9 m) in association with variably 
sericite/carbonate-altered and pyritized mudstone, thereby indicating an alteration zone marginal 
to the Christopher Zone/structure.  
 
Hole GP04-40 was located 35 m NE of GP04-39 (closer to the trend of the vein) to test for further 
eastward continuation of the same at a shallower depth (Fig. 6.9 ). The hole cut weakly altered 
and quartz/calcite-veined greywacke before intersecting the vein at a depth of 40.2-41.3 m. A 1.1 
m wide massive quartz vein, with adjacent, 3-4 cm wide, pyrite-arsenopyrite-bearing, stylolitic, 
quartz veins, was intersected over a width of 1.5 m (however, a 40 cm interval of core reported 
lost immediately above the intercept, possibly corresponding with the fault/shear zone observed 
adjacent to the vein at surface). Best assay reported for the quartz vein zone was 0.025 g/t  
Au/1.10m. Continuing at depth beyond, variably sericitized, chloritized and iron-carbonate altered 
siltstone, mudstone and greywacke, hosting trace pyrite and arsenopyrite, persist with minor 
cross-cutting, cm-scale, quartz-calcite veins/veinlets. 

Northwest Zone 

The Northwest Zone, located approx. 600 m NNW of the Christopher Vein, was investigated by hole 
GP04-41 (Figs. 6.2 & 6.9) to test the inferred siliciclastics/Caradocian shale contact zone beneath a 
110 ppb Au soil anomaly and arsenopyrite-bearing, stylolitic, quartz float. The hole was "oriented 
to cut the underlying north-dipping stratigraphy" and assess the "potential for north-dipping 
quartz veins" that may represent a continuation of the JNZ vein system located 450 m along strike 
to the east. Highly graphitic, pyritic, shale was encountered to a depth of approx. 40 m where it 
transitions to siliceous mudstone. Within the shale, however, a moderately NW-dipping, stylolitic, 
arsenopyrite-pyrite bearing, quartz vein system, composed of at least four, 10-15 cm wide, 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 52 
 

laminated veins, was intersected between 26.1 and 30.35 m depth; the interval returned elevated 
Au values throughout – the highest being 0.10 g/t Au/1.35 m and 0.16 g/t Au/0.3 m. 

A second quartz vein zone was intersected at 87.3-88.0m, marking another shale/mudstone-
greywacke contact, where a graded assay of 0.71 g/t Au/0.7 m (including 3.42 g/t Au/0.4 m) was 
obtained. The zone is described as a composite structure consisting (in contiguous sequence) of: a 
20 cm wide a laminated, vuggy, quartz vein;  a 10 cm wide breccia zone containing fragments of 
mafic dyke; a 40 cm wide, ankerite-altered, mafic dyke; and a 60 cm wide, pyrite-arsenopyrite-
chalcopyrite bearing, massive to laminated/stylolitic, quartz vein. Patchy, sericite-chlorite altered 
mudstone and greywacke exist throughout remainder of hole, to 175.9 m (EOH). The mineralized 
quartz vein system at 26.1-30.35 m, was reported to be very similar to that encountered in GP03-
32 at the JNZ (Fig. 6.9). 

Jaclyn West Area 
Following drill-hole investigations of the Christopher and Northwest Target zones, three additional 
zones of interest were investigated in the Jaclyn West area, each involving single drill-hole tests.  
 
Hole GP04-42 was positioned approx. 600 m SW of the Christopher Zone (Fig. 6.9) to test the site 
of a 075°-trending zone of arsenopyrite-bearing quartz boulders, all of which assayed between 200 
and 750 ppb Au. The hole intersected a sequence of weakly to strongly (Fe-carb/sericite/chlorite-) 
altered mudstone and greywacke, having associated minor pyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite and 
trace chalcopyrite, and several (generally) narrow quartz vein/breccia zones. At 59.8-65.5 m, two 
(10 & 40 cm wide) quartz vein zones were found separated (intruded) by a 0.4 m wide mafic dyke, 
thus indicating, either, two previously separate veins or a single vein obliquely cross-cut by the 
dyke. [Note, similar contiguous quartz vein/mafic dyke zones were encountered at the JMZ, 
Northwest Target and Shawn's Shot Occurrences]. Between 127.4 and 176.4 m, three 10-20 cm 
wide quartz breccia/sulphide veins were intersected; the sulphides occur as 3-5 cm wide semi-
massive pyrite bands with trace to minor pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. Assay results for these 
quartz breccia zones (within inclusion of some wallrock veining) include 0.24 g/t Au /0.5 m (127.1-
127.6m), 0.16 g/t Au/0.4m (146.0-146.4m) and 0.65 g/t Au/0.4 m (176.0-176.4m).  
 
Hole GP04-43 targeted a three-station soil anomaly (of 24-36 ppb Au) located 600 m WSW of the 
Northwest Zone. Black graphitic, locally pyritic, shale was encountered to a depth of 103.9 m 
showing local, small-scale, fold structures with thin, bedding-parallel and axial planar (cross-
cutting) quartz veins/veinlets. At 61.0-68.4 m, stylolitic, laminated, quartz veining (including 
stockwork) comprises 40% of the rock, with an example of saddle-reef type vein-filling exhibited in 
one instance. Mudstone, cut by minor, thin, quartz-calcite veins/veinlets, persists beyond the 
shale contact to 171.5 m (EOH). No significant assays were obtained. The drill intersection 
indicated a moderate NW-dipping stratigraphy consistent with the northern limb of the Jaclyn 
(anticlinal) fold structure. 

Hole GP04-44 was collared 450 m WNW of GP04-42 (Fig. 6.9) to test a 1.0 m wide subcropping of 
quartz breccia that assayed up to 1 g/t Au. The hole intersected a sequence of variably altered 
mudstone and greywacke throughout, with associated, local, silica + Fe-carbonate + sericite 
alteration and minor to trace pyrite; trace chalcopyrite and sphalerite were noted in a couple of 
instances.  No significant assays were obtained.

Shawn's Shot Showing 

Drilling at the Shawn's Shot Occurrence (GP04-45 & 46) consisted of 2 holes (Fig. 6.10) designed to 
test the gold-bearing quartz vein exposed at the river, and ascertain the possible occurrence of 
other veins in the vicinity. Dominantly mudstone and (lesser) greywacke were encountered 
throughout – the same showing variable, spotted to patchy and fracture-controlled, 
sericite/chlorite  alteration, with trace to 1% pyrite, cut by several 10-30 cm wide, stylolitic, quartz 
veins and mafic dykes. The dykes occur adjacent to the quartz veins (obviously occupying the same 
zones of structural weakness) and indicate a post-veining relationship based on chilled contact 
margins. Most quartz veins returned low Au values. Several quartz vein zones, with (individual) 
veins up to 0.3 m wide, were intersected in each of the holes, at depths of between 82 m and 85 
m, returning assays of 0.6 g/t Au/0.30m (GP04-45) and 0.43 g/t Au/0.3 (GP04-46). However, the 
projected depth extension of the Shawn' Shot vein, itself, was believed to have been intersected at 
the targeted depth of 136.5 to 137 m, in GP04-45, where a quartz breccia vein, bearing minor 
pyrite, and trace arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite, was encountered. However, this intersection 
returned only 30 ppb Au/0.5 m.

6.1.3 Rubicon Minerals Corp./Crosshair Exploration & Mining Corp. (2006)  
6.1.3.1   2006 Drilling Program    

Following a one and half year period of inactivity on the property (i.e., excluding the area 
represented by the former South Golden Promise Property) drilling resumed at the JN, JM and JS 
Zones under Crosshair. Placer Dome's option agreement terminated in March, 2005, after which 
Rubicon entered into a joint venture (JV) agreement with Crosshair, in May 2006. Under this 
arrangement Crosshair could earn a 60% interest in the property, albeit, with Rubicon, again, 
acting as operator of the project. During June-December, another 22 holes (GP06-47 to 68) were 
drilled to investigate further expansion of the JN, JM and JS zones (Fig. 6.1 & 6.2 and Table 6.4).  

JM Zone 

The 2006 drilling on the JM zone was reported to be "very successful, as potential ore-grade, 
visible gold-bearing, quartz veins continued to be intersected"… extending the JM Zone "to a strike 
length of 750 m and, locally, to 225 m below surface" (Mullen, 2008). In fact, visible gold, was 
observed in most of the drill-holes, in association with stylolitic/laminated quartz veining. 
Significant intersections are listed in Table 6.4  .  

In addition to establishing significant eastward extension of the JM zone, drilling also confirmed 
the existence of a new (albeit, narrow) high grade, VG-bearing quartz vein system – named the 
Main Prime Zone – located in the structural hanging wall of the main zone (Steele, 2011). The 
zone, as intersected in drill-holes GP06-52 and GP06-61 is situated 5 m from, and trending parallel 
to, the main zone. [This high-grade 'peripheral' zone, is herein, referred to as the JM Satellite Zone 
(as preferred to be called by the author (Jacobs)) since Main Prime Zone sounds synonymous with 
the Jaclyn Main Zone].  

The JM Satellite Zone, encountered in GP06-52, consists of a zone of non-stylolitic, diffusive, silica 
flooding to discrete quartz veining, from which an oblique core length interval of 0.4 m (0.2 m True 
Width) was cut, revealing a total of 115 visible gold specks; the same returned an assay of 327.97 
g/t Au. Hole GP06-61, collared approx. 160 m farther east, intersected a narrower (silica flooded) 
section hosting two (0.5-1.0 cm wide) VG-bearing quartz veins. Again, a wider sample width is 
recorded (due to angle of drilling) producing an assay of 10.37 g/t Au/1.75m.  

JN and JS Zones 

The 2006 drilling at the JN and JS zones helped further outline the (VG-bearing) multiple-vein 
systems (Upper, Middle & Lower Sub-zones) previously encountered in GP03-32 (Sect. 6.1.2.4), 
proving up a minimum strike length of 150 m (Steele, 2011). The veins were noted to dip 
moderately (at 40-45°) to the NNW, obliquely cross-cutting (in sub-parallel fashion) the more 
gently NNW-dipping stratigraphy of greywacke and mudstone. This contrasts with the steeper 
(SSE-dipping) vein systems at the JMZ and JSZ where the veins cross-cut the bedding more 
perpendicularly (see Fig. 6.5). 

 

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 55 
 

The 'better-developed' Upper Sub-zone vein system consists of two to four, 0.25-0.7m, wide quartz 
veins, with many smaller (1-10 cm) quartz veins associated. However, the 'lesser-developed' 
Middle Sub-zone and 'weakly developed' Lower Sub-zone gave the best assay/grades, with hole 
GP06-51 returning up to 5.24 g/t Au/1.70m (Middle Sub-zone) and hole GP06-47 returning one 
significant intersection of 15.23 g/t Au/0.30 (Lower Sub-zone). In comparison, the Upper Sub-zone 
yielded low to modest gold grades at 0.09-2.04 g/t Au/0.30-0.55m. The Middle Sub-zone, however, 
was reported to be, apparently, "strengthening at depth" while both the Middle and Lower 
Subzones were reportedly accompanied by strong to intense silica-sericite alteration that also 
appear to be increasing at depth (Steele, 2011). 
 
Table 6.4 - Rubicon Minerals Corp./Crosshair Exploration & Mining - 2006  Drilling Program 

 

At the JS Zone, two holes (GP06-59 & 60), drilled approx. 125 m apart (Fig. 6.1), were reported to 
have "intersected the thicker Alpha Vein but may not have cored the higher-grade Beta Veins" 
(Steele, 2011). Assay grades for the Alpha Vein included 0.19 g/t Au/0.3 m for each of the drill 
holes. As mentioned in Section 6.1.2.4, the latter veins were previously intersected at a depth of 
25-45 m into the structural footwall of the Alpha Vein (Holes GP03-31 & 33) (Figs. 6.1 & 6.5). 
Present drill hole GP-06-60, collared to the west of GP03-31, confirmed an additional 100 m of 
westward.

6.1.4 Paragon Minerals Corp./Crosshair Exploration & Mining Corp. (2007) 
At the end of the 2006 drilling program (Dec 12, 2006), Rubicon arranged for the creation of a new 
company, Paragon Minerals Corp., into which its Newfoundland assets (including the Golden 
Promise Property) were transferred by way of a Plan of Arrangement. Subsequent to Paragon's 
acquired interest, Crosshair renewed its former option agreement by which it would, and 
subsequently did, acquire a majority interest (60%) in the Golden Promise Property.  

6.1.4.1 2007 Drilling Program     
Under the Paragon Minerals/Crosshair partnership, two drilling phases were implemented for the 
Jaclyn Zone area, including a 7-hole program at the JMZ, during December, 2006 to February,2007, 
and a 23-hole program at both the JMZ (19 holes) and the JNZ (4 holes), during June to December, 
2007 (Fig. 6.3)(Table 6.5).  

The 26-hole program (GP07-69 to 75 & 80 to 98), at the JMZ, involved both infill and exploratory 
drilling – the latter aimed at testing further strike and depth extensions of the zone, both to the 
east and west (Fig. 6.2 ). The program confirmed a total (minimum) strike length of 800 m and a 
(minimum) depth extension of 265 m for the JMZ (Wallis, 2010). Drilling encountered 
stylolitic/laminated quartz veining, throughout, with abundant VG present. In addition, the JM 
Satellite Zone – a high grade, non-stylolitic, quartz vein/silica-flooded, zone that had been 
previously intersected in GP06-52 and GP06-61 (Section 6.1.3.1) – was encountered again, in hole 
GP07-92, at a depth of 92.6-93.5 m. The intersection returned an assay of 64.49 g/t Au /0.5 m 
(with 1340 ppm As associated). 
 
The four holes drilled at the JNZ (GP07-76 to 79; Fig. 6.2  ) were positioned to test further westerly 
and easterly extensions of the quartz vein system while also providing deeper (down-dip) 
evaluation of the zone. Each of the holes intersected the Upper and Middle (quartz vein) Sub-zones 
with one hole (GP07-76) intersecting the Upper Sub-zone as well. The latter intersection contained 
VG, returning an assay of 2.63 g/t Au/1.30m (incl. 11.28 g/t Au/ 0.3 m). Drilling extended the gold-
bearing zones from its previously determined strike length of 150 m, to 250 m, and from its 
previous depth of 100 m, to 160 m (Wallis, 2010). Highlights of the entire 2007 drilling program are 
presented in Table 6.5.

6.1.5.1   2010 Drilling Program     

Following a period of market decline, beginning in 2007, there was relative inactivity on the 
Golden Promise property – with the exception of some prospecting, rock and geochemical 
sampling on the southwestern claims group (as discussed in Section 6.2). Thus, drilling operations 
ceased for a time, but was resumed again, in the Jaclyn Zone and Northwest Target area, during 
February-May, 2010, by JV partners, Crosshair Exploration and Paragon Minerals. This program 
consisted of 3 drill holes on the JN Zone, 4 holes at the Northwest Target and 31 holes on the JM 
Zone (including its Jaclyn East extension) thus, comprising the final drilling, to date, performed on 
the Golden Promise property (see Fig. 6.2 & Table 6.6). 
 
Drilling began at the JN site with all three holes (GP10-99, 100 & 103) intersecting the two well-
developed Middle & Lower Subzone quartz vein systems, as identified by earlier drilling (see Sect. 
6.1.3.1). Present drilling continued to reveal high grade gold, albeit, over narrow widths, including 
4.68 g/t Au/0.3 m (GP10-99) and 2.08 g/t Au /0.38 m (GP10-100). An additional 200 m of strike 
length and 60 m of vertical depth was proven up for the zone, giving total 'open-ended' lateral and 
down-dip dimensions of 470 m and 185 m, respectively. Drilling continued to confirm the sub-
parallel relationship of the quartz vein systems to bedding (Fig. 6.5).

Additional drilling was carried out on the JMZ to assess further down-dip extension of the quartz 
vein system in its western section (holes GP10-120, 124 & 125) and to ascertain further lateral 
(eastward) and down-dip continuity in the Jaclyn East area (16 holes; see Fig. 6.2 & Table 6.6). The 
latter drilling was successful in tracing the known limits of the Jaclyn Main vein system for another 
175 m eastwards, for a total strike length of 975 m, and to a newly-determined depth of 400 m 
(Sparkes, 2010). Highlights or best assay intercepts for all zones are outlined in Table 6.6.   
 
A longitudinal (grade x assay width) representation of the JMZ is shown in Fig. 6.11. As can be seen 
from this section, the higher-grade portions of the JM vein system is relatively shallow for the 
most part, with an apparent (ore shoot) plunge to the east.

An important objective of the 2010 drill program was to provide detailed (shallow) infill-drilling 
along a 300 m section of the central deposit area of the JM Zone in preparation for a bulk sampling 
program planned for the fall of 2010. This involved the drilling of 12 holes to better determine the 
structural and grade continuity of the JMZ and to provide a sample medium for metallurgical 
testing. The bulk sample test was proposed on the rationale that it provides for a more 
representative gold grade determination of the resource, as a whole, by circumventing the 
unreliability of gold grades as obtained from drill core samples – this 'unreliability or 
unpredictability' being due to the 'nuggety' or spotty nature of the gold mineralization (in quartz) 
which lends itself to highly variable and inconsistent results. Furthermore, it was determined that 
a bulk sample test would "provide information on recovery and processing of the ore" (Steele, 
2011). A description of the bulk sampling program is presented in Section 13. 

An interesting result of the infill-drilling, along the central JMZ, was the confirmation of visible gold 
in over 80% of the new drill holes. Also, it was revealed that "previous drill holes, GP02-18 and 
GP02-19, had stopped short of the more northerly, en echelon, Main Branch Zone" (Steele, 
2011)(see Fig. 6.1).  

6.2 Southwestern Golden Promise Property Area (2002-2010) 
The southwesternmost claims area of the (present) Golden Promise Property area was initially 
contained, in large part, by former Mineral Licence 9050M (Fig. 6.12), one of three mineral licences 
comprising the former South Golden Promise Property – the others being 9051M and 9052M, 
located well beyond to the southwest. The area formerly encompassed by 9050M is now largely 
contained by Mineral Licences 24305M and 25161M. Thus, for the purpose of this report, only that 
area contained by former Mineral Licences 9050M, and later-acquired Mineral Licences 11057M 
and 11058M (adjoining to the east), are considered with respect to inclusion of historical work 
coverage. The areas formerly contained by the latter two licences, staked in Sept, 2004, are now 
contained, for the most part, by present Mineral Licences 25156M and 24311M, respectively. 
 
The former three licences, mentioned above, were staked by Rubicon Minerals, on July 19, 2002, 
and optioned to International Lima Resources Corp. (now Crosshair Exploration & Mining Corp.), 
on February 14, 2003. [The name change from Lima Resources to Crosshair transpired on March 1, 
2004]. The ensuing JV program, between Rubicon and Crosshair, was undertaken concurrently 
with the Rubicon/Placer Dome JV program covering the greater Golden Promise Property area, to 
the northeast.  
 

6.2.1 Rubicon Minerals Corp./Crosshair Exploration & Mining Corp. (2003-2010) 
6.2.1.1 2003  Reconnaissance Prospecting, Soil Sampling & Rock Sampling 
During 2003, Rubicon Minerals performed reconnaissance mapping, prospecting and sampling 
over the southwestern portion of the present Golden Promise Property (former South Golden 
Promise Mineral Lic. 9050M) resulting in the collection of 118 rock samples and 21 soil samples. 
"Massive to brecciated quartz veins and altered gabbro", containing anomalous Au (107-480 ppb) 
and As (100 ppm), were reported "within 500 m of brittle, 070°-trending, fault zones – particularly 
in the north-central and southwest corners of former Mineral Licence 9050M (Copeland & 
Newport, 2004). The highest rock sample Au value obtained, during this work, was a 480 ppb Au 
for a piece of quartz float located on the western boundary of the licence (Fig. 6.12a). None of the 
soil samples collected by Rubicon, at that time, returned anomalous gold (Froude, 2004).

6.2.1.2   2003 Airborne Geophysical Surveying and Interpretations 

During November, 2003, a 2,382.5 line-km airborne EM/Magnetics survey was flown, by Fugro 
Airborne Surveys Corp., over the former mineral licence areas of 9050M, 9051M & 9052M. The 
survey portion relevant to the present property area is shown in Fig. 6.12 . 
 
As in the case of the larger Fugro Airborne survey area, to the northeast, magnetic and 
EM/Resistivity results were used to provide geological interpretations, outlining stratigraphic and 
structural features of the property area. Interpretations were aided and/or supported by 
geological field observations and information gleaned from the government geological map 
compilation (NTS Area 12A/16), of Evans, Kean and Jayasinghe (1994). The southern part of the 
area was shown to be "dominated by low-resistivity, relatively highly-magnetic, black shales", 
conformably overlain, to the northeast and north, by "siltstones and mudstones"; these are, in 
turn, overlain by sandstone, greywacke and felsic volcanics (Copeland et al., 2004) (Fig. 6.12). As 
elsewhere on the property, stratigraphic trends are controlled by NE-plunging F1 folds cut by 
brittle fault zones striking NE (035°), ENE (070°) and ESE (110°-120°)(Copeland et al., 2004; Geofile 
12A/1146). 
 
During 2004, Crosshair obtained the services of GeoScott Exploration Consultants Inc., of St. 
John's, NL, to provide an interpretation on the Fugro airborne survey results. A graphical 
representation of (apparent) NE and ENE-trending structural breaks, considered favorable for gold 
deposition, is shown, by GeoScott, in Fig. 6.13. A discussion of these features is presented below, 
as excerpts from the Geoscott report (contained within the report of Froude, 2004)(Geofile 
12A/1138); insertions by the writer are contained in parentheses and brackets.  

GeoScott Exploration Consultants Inc.  

"Results of the electromagnetic part of the airborne survey are dominated by formational 
conductors, with very long strike lengths, which trend generally north-northeast, in agreement 
with the dominant magnetic trend direction and known geology. (However), the Fugro report 
identifies some airborne electromagnetic conductors which do not conform to this general 
outcome".  

"Within a few hundred metres of the (Linda) showing, intersecting structural trends of 090°, 045° 
and 320° have been identified in the magnetic shadowing (Fig. 6.13  ). These directions appear to 
represent structural features which could control mineralization". 

"All of the gold occurrences … lie on intersections of the magnetic trends indicated in the 
shadogram. In addition, several of the showings (occur) in close proximity to locations of non-
formational EM anomalies".  

"In the south-central part of the block, near 544000E, 5401500N, a complex of intersecting 
structural trends lies near a high gold anomaly in soil. This area obviously should be given priority 
for follow-up". 

"Intersections of linear magnetic feature are ubiquitous. If these intersections represent the best 
locations to look for auriferous deposits, then the whole property has potential" (GeoScott 
Exploration Consultants Inc., after Froude, 2004).

6.2.1.3   2004 Reconnaissance Soil Sampling, Rock Sampling and Trenching      

Also during 2004, a total of 4,077 soil samples were collected from a 106 line-km reconnaissance 
grid consisting of E/W-trending, 500m-spaced, lines, covering the whole of (former) Lic. 9050M 
(Fig. 6.14). Samples were taken at 25m-spaced stations. A total of 35 widely-scattered Au 
anomalies were identified, including 8 sample results in the range of 105-252 ppb Au, 18 in the 
range of 22-56 ppb Au, and two at 68 ppb and 70 ppb Au (Froude, 2004). Nine of the anomalous 
sites were selected for local-area geochemical follow-up, however, with only one site (120 ppb Au) 
yielding further anomalous gold. Here, two adjacent (follow-up) soils returned 42 ppb and 490 ppb 
Au (with up to 578 ppm As). Hand-trenching at the site led to the discovery of visible gold - bearing 
quartz veins, named the Snow White Occurrence. Prospecting, nearby, to the southwest revealed a 
similar showing, named the Linda Occurrence (Froude, 2004, 2005). Later trenching, with use of an 
excavator, in 2005, showed the two occurrences to be part of a single, composite, quartz vein 
system, exposed over a strike distance of 170 m and a width of up to 5 m (Fig. 6.15). See Section 
6.2.1.5 for description of the vein. 

Grab samples collected during the initial hand-trenching investigations, at the Linda and Snow 
White quartz vein occurrences, returned a number of Au assays ranging from 1.284 g/t to 105.25 
g/t (weighted average analyses (see Sect. 6.2.1.5 & Table 6.7). 

Follow-up investigations at the site of two soil anomalies (79 ppb & 105 ppb Au) at Valley Brook, 
located 2.5 km northeast of the Linda/Snow White prospect (Fig. 6.14  ), revealed a zone of dark 
grey, fine grained, partially silicified, sediment, cut by 1 cm-wide sulphide veins. Two bedrock 
samples returned an interesting correlation of elevated to anomalous elements including up to 23 
ppb Au, 325 ppm As, >220 ppm Mo, 264 ppm Cu, 99 ppm Pb, 166 ppm Ni, 235 ppm Zn and 129 
ppm Ce. A third, nearby, sample, consisting of silicified (questionable) sediment or volcanics, 
hosting trace sulphides and cut by minor quartz veins, produced a >220 ppm Sr (strontium). Three 
quartz vein samples separately yielded >2200 ppm As, 2611 ppm Cu and 2154 ppm Cu (Fig. 6.14).

6.2.1.4   2005-2006 Soil Geochemistry and Rock Sampling   

During the spring of 2005, a 41.35 line-km soil grid, with a baseline orientation of 049°, was 
completed over part of the northwestern corner area of (former) Lic. 9050M and the 2004 
reconnaissance soil grid (Fig. 6.16). The new grid consisted of 50m-spaced lines designed to follow 
up on geochemical anomalies broadly coincident with the newly-discovered Linda/Snow White 
quartz vein system and the projected trend of the vein system, itself. Baseline orientation was, 
thus, coincident with the general strike of the host stratigraphy.  
 
The grid consisted of two parts – a 400 m long section to the northeast (near the Buchans 
Highway) and a 2.0 km section, located 1.6 km farther southwest (the Linda Grid) – linked by a 
common baseline (see inset map in Fig. 6.16 ). Another 650 m of baseline extended beyond to the 
southwest. Samples were collected at 25m-spacings, along the baseline as well as along the 50m-
spaced grid lines, resulting in a total of 1,348 soils (Froude, 2005).  
 
Elevated to anomalous Au-in-soils were found to be widely scattered over the Linda Grid section 
where 14 samples returned values in the range of 16-71 ppb Au, and 6 in the range of 130-455 ppb 
Au. Seven of the elevated to anomalous Au values occurred in the general vicinity of the 
Linda/Snow White prospect, including 359 ppb Au and 8,164 ppb Au. Elevated to highly anomalous 
Arsenic (As) was found to be considerably more pervasive, with significant concentrations of the 
element exhibiting a wide NE/SW trend through the prospect area (Fig. 6.16 ). Here, five soils 
returned arsenic (As) values between 300 ppm and >2200 ppm (the latter being the max. 
detection limit). On the smaller northeastern grid section, only one elevated Au (20 ppb) and two 
anomalous As values (50 ppm & 69 ppm) were obtained. A 75 ppm As was obtained on the 
baseline roughly 470 m farther southwest.

Also in 2005, a section of the Linda grid was extended 500 m southeast (to the Exploits River) to 
expand soil sample coverage. The extended survey included Lines 70+50E-75+00E from which a 
total of 188 soils were collected (Fig. 6.16 )(Morgan, Pickett & Froude, 2006). Sample results, 
however, did not reveal any gold values greater than the 5 ppb detection limit. Surprisingly, one 
anomalous As value (193 ppm) was obtained, its location being the northeastern corner of the 
survey area. Along the southeastern margin of the grid, one sample site returned elevated for 
several elements – Co (190 ppm), Pb (33 ppm), Ba (141 ppm) and Cu (42 ppm) – that may be 
worthy of investigation. However, this enrichment may be due to a scavenging effect by 
manganese, given the latter's very high concentration (15530 ppm Mn). As well, three elevated to 
anomalous Zn values (96-123 ppm) were reported by Morgan et al. (2006) for soils collected 
between 70+50E-71+50E and 93+00-94+00N (southern part of the grid) (Fig. 6.16  ). 

In addition to the soil survey, a small (100 x 150 m) basal till sample grid, utilizing 25m-space lines, 
was superimposed over the baseline area of the Linda grid, immediately east of the prospect. A 
total of 43 till samples were collected between (and inclusive of) Lines 72+00E to 73+00E. The tills 
returned a Au value of 109 ppb as well as five in the range of 18-39 ppb (>2200 ppm As was 
associated with the 39 ppb Au value). Assay results also revealed two anomalous Cu values (109 
ppm & 181 ppm Cu) in association with two of the elevated Au values at, and near, the baseline 
location of 72+00E. Two anomalous zinc (Zn) results – 107 ppm & 103 ppm Zn – were also 
obtained from grid locations 73+00E/101+00N and L72+00E/101+00N, respectively (Morgan et al., 
2006).  

Prior to mechanical trenching, a total of 18 random soil sample checks were made over a roughly 
10 x 30 m area comprising what became the northeastern section of the Linda trench exposure. All 
samples returned elevated to anomalous results for Au (up to 8,313 ppb) and As (up to >2200 
ppm)(Fig. 6.17 ). In addition, a reconnaissance soil sample site located 1.9 km east of the prospect 
(SE side of the Exploits River) returned Au values of 124 ppb Au (Fig. 6.17  ).  

Rock sampling conducted in the vicinity of the Linda/Snow White quartz vein, in 2006, produced a 
number of elevated to anomalous Au results, including a 2995 ppb Au (obtained roughly 150 m 
southeast of the prospect) and values of 49 ppb, 78 ppb and 129 ppb Au (150-250 m northeast of 
the prospect)(Morgan et al., 2006). [These results, however, relate to the +150 mesh-size sample 
fractions, with corresponding "weighted average" assay results returning 25 ppb, 5 ppb, 16 ppb & 
6 ppb Au, respectively)(Fig. 6.17)].  

Approximately 1.0 km along strike, to the southwest of the Linda-Snow White prospect, four 
quartz float samples returned elevated to anomalous results of up to 85 ppb Au, >2200 ppm As 
and 213 ppm Cu), while four other samples taken along the Exploits River, 0.8 km south and 1.3 
km SE of the prospect (collectively) produced anomalous results of up to 35 ppb Au, 497 ppm Cu, 
262 ppm Pb and 299 ppm Zn)(Table 6.7 & Fig 6.17).

6.2.1.5   2005 Trench Sampling – Linda/Snow White Prospect 

A number of grab samples, collected during the initial hand-trenching investigations at the Linda 
and Snow White quartz vein occurrences, returned many highly anomalous (weighted average) Au 
assay results ranging from 1.284 g/t to 105.25 g/t, with generally highly anomalous arsenic as well 
(Table 6.8 ). Also, anomalous concentrations of Ag (8.9 g/t), Pb (72 ppm) and Bi (24 ppm) were 
obtained in association with the 105.28 g/t Au assay. Other, nearby, samples of quartz vein 
material produced sporadic elevated to anomalous Au and As values up to several hundred ppb 
and >2200 ppm, respectively (Froude, 2004, 2005).  

Following completion of the mechanical trenching at the Linda-Snow White Occurrence, a total of 
182 channel samples and 79 grab samples (including from adjacent areas) were collected from the 
site (Fig. 6.18). Assay results include up to 232 g/t Au for grabs (Table 6.8) and up to 29.7 g/t Au/ 
0.5 m for channels. [Note: Channel samples listed in Fig. 6.18, as presented in the Crosshair 
Exploration & Mining report, by Morgan et al. (2006), do not indicate sample lengths or intervals 
in connection with the assay results]. 

Trenching revealed the Linda-Snow White occurrence to consist of a composite zone of quartz 
veining, up to 5 m in width, with an (exposed) strike trend of 170 m, hosted within a mix of 
gabbro, mudstone, siltstone and greywacke. Wall rock alteration consists of minor iron-carbonate, 
sericite and local chlorite. The veins contain variable, though generally minor pyrite, arsenopyrite 
and trace galena, with gold occurring in "free-style form (as specks or nuggets) associated with 
dark stylolitic bands, on or close to vein margins (Froude, 2005 & Pilgrim et al., 2008). The veining 
was reported to be similar to that at the Jaclyn Zone, to the northeast.

6.2.1.6   2006 Diamond Drilling     

In 2006, Crosshair drilled 16 holes (SGP-01 to 16), totaling 1016 m, to investigate the Linda/Snow 
White quartz vein system (Fig. 6.19 ). The zone was tested to vertical depths of 30 m to 110 m, and 
over a strike distance of 230 m. Holes were spaced at approx. 25 m over the northeastern portion 
of the vein system, and at 50 m, to the southwest (Morgan et al., 2006).  

Variable (weak to intense) quartz veining was encountered throughout all drill holes, with 
brecciated host-rock fragments common. Intersections, of both single quartz veins and multiple 
vein/veinlet systems, were commonly encountered over widths of up to 1.0 m. Elevated to 
anomalous Au values of >150 ppb (as per the sample width) were encountered in eleven of the 
drill holes, however, with only one hole (SGP-14) returning any 'economic-grade type' results; the 
latter encountered a mineralized quartz vein zone, between 42.95 m and 43.90 m, producing an 
intersection of 19.5 g/t Au / 1.15 m (core length) which included a sub-interval of 63.2 g/t Au/0.35 
m. The zone was noted to contain pyrite and arsenopyrite and 20 specks of visible gold. A second 
anomalous interval, at 48.60 - 49.10m, consisted of several narrow quartz veins, cutting gabbro, 
which returned 1.5 g/t Au/0.50 m (Morgan et al., 2006). The remaining anomalous intersections 
consisted of assay grades of 131 ppb to 798 ppb Au over (core length) intervals of 0.14 to 1.78 m, 
though mainly in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 m. A single speck of visible gold was noted in connection 
with the 798 ppb Au (obtained over a 0.4 m (core length) interval). Significant mineralized 
intersections are presented in Table 6.9. Drill hole parameter data are outlined in Appendix II.

6.2.1.7   2007 Trenching and Sampling      

During October, 2007, trenching investigations were conducted at three anomalous soil sample 
sites identified on the Linda Grid, in 2005. Two of the trenches were emplaced at anomaly sites 
130 ppb and 308 ppb Au, located 1.0 km southwest of (along strike from) the Linda-Snow White 
prospect. The third trench was located approx. 650 m NNE of the quartz vein prospect, at the site 
of a 383 ppb Au anomaly (Fig. 6.20). Trenching at all three sites exposed non-mineralized black 
shale, with no evidence of quartz veining (Morgan & Pickett, 2008).

6.2.1.8   2008-2009 Soil and Rock Sampling    

In January 2008, a reconnaissance soil sampling program was implemented to the west and 
southwest of the Linda/Snow White Prospect to identify further potential areas for follow-up 
(Eaton & Morgan, 2008). The survey consisted of four, 500m-spaced, lines, located roughly 500 m 
west of the prospect, three  of which overlapped with the present property area. Two additional 
lines were located 1.7 km and 3.4 km farther southwest (Fig 6.20).  

A total of 289 soils were collected resulting in five anomalous Au assays (at 34 - 55 ppb), three 
elevated Cu (at 33-35 ppm) and five elevated to anomalous Zn (75-119 ppm).  

The highest and most concentrated of the Au, Cu and Zn values were obtained at, or near, the 
present property boundary (on Lines 2 to 4), immediately west of the Linda/Snow White Prospect 
(Fig. 6.20  ). However, a follow-up soil survey (during Oct-Nov, 2008), using 100m-spaced (infill) 
lines, produced only two anomalous Au results for this area. These consisted of a 62 ppb Au, 
located just WSW of the earlier-reported 40 ppb Au (on L3), and a 14 ppb Au located on the 
southeastern end of L4.

Table 6.9 - 2006 Diamond Drill Hole (Gold) Results, Linda-Snow White Prospect 

 

Follow-up soil sampling carried out on, and adjacent to, line (L6), located 4.5 km SW of the 
prospect, produced a significant cluster of anomalous Au values, including 7,667 ppb, 47 ppb, 45 
ppb, 50 ppb and 82 ppb Au (Fig. 6.20). Associated concentrations of 1750 ppm As, 42 ppm Cu and 
49 ppm Pb, were obtained with the larger Au value, while up to 94 ppm Cu and 137 ppm Zn 
occurred with the latter results.  

A re-investigation of the anomalous site, in 2009, resulted in the discovery of a poorly-exposed 
quartz vein system, roughly coincident with the soil anomalies, being outlined by angular quartz  
float and sparse bedrock occurrences.  "Where outcropping, the quartz vein measures 0.30 - 0.70 
m wide and consists of bull white quartz with local iron carbonate/chlorite alteration and 
silicification of adjacent wallrock. Only rare stylolitic remnants of the host sediments/volcanics 
were observed" (Sparkes, 2009). Sampling of the subcrop/float material assayed only 101 and 56 
ppb Au. However, at the site of the 7,667 ppb Au soil anomaly (located at the site of a roadside 
pit), scattered, angular, fragments of quartz-carbonate float overlying poorly exposed, NE-
trending, interbedded siltstone, chert and tuff, returned two assays of 6.78 g/t and 2.44 g/t Au 
(Fig. 6.20). Panning of soils, at two localities within the general soil anomaly area, revealed several 
pristine flakes of very fine gold (Sparkes, 2009; Geofile 12A/1462). [While these anomalies are 
located a significant distance from the present Golden Promise Property boundary, they do align 
with the structural trend of the Linda-Snow White prospect, thereby, highlighting the importance 
of this trend as a yet-worthwhile exploration target].

6.2.1.9   2010 Biogeochemical Sampling 

During May-June, 2010, a program of biogeochemical sampling, utilizing the collection of tree 
needles and twigs, was implemented over the original Linda Grid and a smaller grid to the south of 
the Exploits River (Fig. 6.21). The purpose of the program was to "better define trends of 
anomalous gold, arsenic and other pathfinder elements which could be targeted by future 
trenching and drilling" (Wallis, 2010).  

A total of 561 samples (fir tree needles and twigs) were collected from the Linda Grid, while 
another 85, consisting of spruce bark material, were collected from the smaller southern grid; the 
latter grid consisted of four lines, spaced 100 m apart, which targeted a 250 m long arsenic 
anomaly identified (on L9N), during the 2004 reconnaissance soil survey (Wallis, 2010). 

Gold results for the Linda Grid included 15 anomalous values ranging from 10 - 456 ppb (over a 
background of < 5 to 10 ppb). No anomalous Au results were obtained in the vicinity of the Linda-
Snow White prospect where, in fact, only a few biochemical samples were taken due to lack of 
suitable trees. A cluster of 5 samples, with assay values exceeding 10 ppb (including the 456 ppb 
Au value), was obtained from the northwestern fringe area of the grid (400 m WNW of the 
prospect)(Fig. 6.21  ); elevated responses of Ag, Ba, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Ge (and weaker Mo) were 
associated. To the NNE of the prospect, 5 sample sites, located within 200 m of the earlier-
reported 383 ppb Au (soil) anomaly, produced values ranging from 14 to 37 ppb Au. In addition, a 
75 ppb Au value (correlating with elevated Ag, Cu, Pb & Zn responses) was obtained on the 
southwesternmost line of the grid (L59+50E)(Wallis, 2010).  

The southern survey grid produced only one elevated (biochemical) Au value, of 13 ppb. A total of 
18 rock samples, also collected from the southern grid, returned no anomalous Au. Three quartz 
float samples, however, yielded As values of 427 ppm, 428 ppm and 975 ppm (Wallis, 2010).

6.2.1.2 6.2.10  2005 Rock and Soil Sampling – Noel Paul's Brook-Gabbro Occurrence Area 
In 2005, a small reconnaissance soil grid, consisting of four (100 m-spaced) lines, was sampled just 
west of the Noel Paul's Brook, on (former) Lic. 11058M. The survey lines were designed to test a 
NE-trending topographic lineament (structure) that crosses the brook 0.9 km northeast of the 
survey area (Froude, 2005). Of the total 85 soils collected, only one anomalous Au value – 34 ppb – 
was obtained, this being located on the structure, itself (Fig. 6.22).  

Approximately 2.0 km east of Noel Paul's Brook, in the northwestern corner area of (former) Lic. 
11057M, additional reconnaissance soil sampling was carried out in conjunction with prospecting 
and rock sampling, resulting in the discovery of auriferous quartz veins cutting gabbro (the Gabbro 
Occurrence). A number of rock samples produced elevated to highly anomalous  gold results, 
including 152 ppb Au, 153 ppb Au, 661 ppb Au, 955 ppb Au, 10.04 g/t Au and 2.6 g/t Au (Sparkes, 
2006).  A total of 118 soil samples were collected on three 400m-spaced lines which returned a 
maximum Au value of 87 ppb Au, and several others in the range of 28 - 45 ppb Au (Fig. 6.22). 

During July-Sept, 2006, a follow-up investigation of the general area of the 10.04 g/t Au 
occurrence, revealed a 25 x 55 m (exposed) bedrock area consisting of iron-carbonate altered 
gabbro, cut by a system of narrow (<1 to 4 cm wide) quartz veins, hosting up to 10% pyrite 
(Copeland, 2006). Five of the 36 samples taken at, or near, the site, returned Au values of 9.15 g/t, 
4.45 g/t, 1.99 g/t, 1.88 g/t and 1.35 g/t Au, while another 18 samples assayed between 119 ppb 
and 922 ppb Au. 

During the fall, 2008, a total of 117 soils were collected on four 200m-spaced reconnaissance lines 
located approx. 1.1 km southwest of the Gabbro Occurrence (Fig. 6.22). A total of 9 rock samples 
were also collected from the grid (Morgan, 2008). The central portion of the survey area revealed 
numerous outcrops and subcrops of pyrite-bearing quartz veins, striking 090° and 110°, and 
dipping steeply north. The veins can be intermittently traced for at least 125 metres along strike, 
the widest, ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 m in width. The report, by Morgan (2008) does not record the 
type of host rock (in general), except to state – in the case of one 8 cm wide quartz vein – that it 
cuts "medium grained, weakly/locally magnetic gabbro containing minor pyrite plus pyrrhotite".  
Rock sampling, however, produced generally insignificant gold and base metal assays, the 
maximum being 32 ppb and 40 ppb Au, 119 ppm Cu and 42 ppm Zn. Soil sampling returned 7 
elevated to anomalous Au values, including 7 ppb, 10 ppb, 11 ppb, 15 ppb, 30 ppb, 32 ppb and 388 
ppb Au (Morgan, 2008; Geofile 12A/1364). 

During Sept, 2008, a final program of trenching and rock sampling was carried out at the Gabbro 
Occurrence, where two trenches were excavated and seven rock (grab) samples were collected. 
The two trench exposures, separately, consisted of chloritized and saussauritized gabbro and 
strongly fractured siltstone. The gabbro exposure was reported to be cut by local, <1-15 cm wide, 
quartz veins from which three anomalous Au results were obtained, including 38 ppb, 176 ppb and 
504 ppb Au (Sparkes, 2009). No samples were taken from and second trench. The quartz-veined 
gabbro exposure, however, could not be "washed or channel-sampled due to the lack of a suitable 
water source in the area" (Sparkes, 2009).

7 GEOLOGY SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
The Golden Promise property lies along the north-northwestern fringe of the Victoria Lake 
Supergroup – a volcanosedimentary terrane comprising a significant portion of Newfoundland's 
central Dunnage Zone (Fig. 7.1). The Dunnage is a major tectonostratigraphic division of the 
Appalachian Orogen composed mainly of remnants of the Cambrian-Ordovician ophiolitic and 
volcanic arc terranes of the ancient Iapetus Ocean basin. The same were juxtaposed between 
the Precambrian continental land masses of Laurentia (proto-North America) and Gondwana 
(proto northwest Amazonia/Africa) during the Early-Mid Ordovician Taconic Orogeny. These 
terranes are now represented by the Humber and the Avalon-Gander Zones, respectively (Figs. 
7.1 & 7.2).  

The Taconic Orogeny was followed by the (Silurian) Salinic and (Devonian) Acadian orogenies 
which resulted in final juxtaposition, accretion and deformation of the oceanic/continental-
margin arc sequences along the Laurentian margin (Fig. 7.2). Following these events, more 
relaxed crustal conditions gave way to a profusion of anorogenic granitoid intrusive events 
throughout the Dunnage Zone. 

The Newfoundland Dunnage Zone is comprised of two major divisions or terranes – the Notre 
Dame Subzone (NDSZ) and Exploits Subzone (ExSZ) – representing the once widely-separate 
oceanic realms of peri-Laurentia and peri-Gondwana, respectively (Figs. 7.1 & 7.2). During the 
convergence of these terranes "several thousand kilometers of oceanic lithosphere were 
consumed by means of subduction" occurring on opposite sides of the Iapetus Ocean basin 
(van Staal, 2007). Final disappearance of the main ocean tract brought these domains together 
along a suture zone known as the Red Indian Line (Fig. 7.1). This major, northeast-trending 
structural zone marks the west-dipping thrust-fault contact of the peri-Laurentian Red Indian 
arc sequence (of the NDSZ) with the peri-Gondwanan Victoria arc sequence (of the ExSZ). The 
same occurs adjacent to the northwestern boundary of the Golden Promise Property. Its actual 
location in this area, however, is obscured by the Mid Ordovician- Silurian Badger Group 
sedimentary cover sequence. 

7.1.1 Victoria Lake Supergroup 
  

The Victoria Lake Supergroup (VLSG) dominates the western portion of the ExSZ (Fig. 7.1); it is 
composed of remnants of the Penobscot Arc (ca. 513-486 Ma) and the later, superimposed, 
Victoria Arc (ca. 473-454 Ma) sequences, of the peri-Gondwanan realm, which have correlative 
extensions in northeastern and southern Newfoundland, as well as in the Canadian Maritimes 
and Maine, USA  (van Staal and Barr, 2012).

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 83 
 

    Figure 7.2 - Middle Ordovician–Early Silurian tectonic evolution of the peri-Laurentian and peri-
Gondwanan terranes associated with closure of the Iapetus Ocean Basin (Modified 
after van Stall & Barr, 2012).  

 

The VLSG has a maximum width of 28 km and a strike extension of 170 km extending from the 
Grand Falls-Windsor area, in the northeast, to the King George IV Lake and Burgeo highway 
area, in southwestern Newfoundland (Figs. 7.1 & 7.3).  

From east to west, and corresponding with oldest to youngest stratigraphy, the 
volcanosedimentary units of the VLSG include: the Tally Pond (ca. 513 Ma), Long Lake (ca. 505 
Ma), Tulks Hill (ca. 498 Ma), Pats Pond (ca. 487 Ma), Sutherlands Pond (ca. 462 Ma), Noel Paul's 
Brook (ca. 455-465 Ma) and Wigwam Brook (ca. 455 Ma) Groups (McNicoll et al., 2008; 
Zagorevski et al., 2007)(Fig. 7.3). Its uppermost (Caradocian) shale/chert sequence is assigned 
to the Noel Paul's Brook Group (Rogers & van Staal, 2003-2005). Along its north-northwestern 
fringe (present property area), the VLSG is overlain by a flyschoid sequence of 
greywacke/turbidites, argillites and conglomerates of the Ordovician-Silurian Badger Group.  

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 84 
 

An important distinction is noted between the lithological character and tectonic origin of the 
sediments of the VLSG and those of the Badger Group. Prior to collision of the peri-Gondwanan 
and peri-Laurentian arc terranes, distal sedimentation concomitant with Victoria arc volcanism 
(of the VLSG) was influenced by extensional basins associated with arc rifting, wherein 
deposition of argillites, cherts and volcanogenic epiclastic/siliciclastic sediments occurred. 
Intermittent disruption and slumping of these sediments, due to  seismic/rifting activity, 
resulted in the formation of turbidites – as recognized within the property area and elsewhere 
within the VLSG. During collision of the peri-Gondwanan (Victoria/Penobscot) arc terrane with 
the peri-Laurentian terrane – along the Red Indian Line (RIL) – the former assumed a lower-
plate setting, undergoing partial subduction (and therefore subsidence) in contrast to 
simultaneous uplift of its Laurentian counterpart to the west (Zagorevski, et al., 2008)(see Fig. 
7.2). This resulted in a basinal setting to the east of the RIL, thus, favoring widespread 
deposition of the (458-448 Ma) Caradocian black shales atop the Victoria arc sequence 
(Zagorevski, et al., 2008; van der Velden et al., 2004). Subsequent eastward transport of 
erosional detritus across the RIL, from the emergent Laurentian terrane, resulted in deposition 
of flyschoid-type sediments of the Badger Group, atop the Caradocian (Fig. 7.2). 

Structurally, the VLSG is characterized by a moderately to strongly developed regional foliation 
fabric that dips steeply NW to SE in association with tight to isoclinal, folds which trend and 
(generally) plunge NE (Evans et al., 1990; Zagorevski, 2007). First, second and (locally) third-
order folds occur parasitic to a regional-scale antiformal structure called the Victoria 
Anticlinorium (Kean, 1985) (Fig. 7.4). Metamorphic grade is generally lower-greenschist facies, 
increasing to mid-greenschist to lower-amphibolite facies along the southern margin of the 
VLSG.  

Mineralization in the VLSG 

The VLSG is host to numerous volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) and epigenetic-gold 
occurrences. Approximately 130 (chalcopyrite-sphalerite-galena-type) VMS occurrences are 
documented to date – including 30 significant deposits and prospects (Fig. 7.4 ). The most 
significant of these occur within the Early Cambrian Tally Pond Group which hosts the past-
producing Duck Pond base metal deposit. Combined resources of the Duck Pond deposit and 
the nearby Boundary Zone deposit consisted of 5.48 Mt of 5.8 % Zn, 3.3% Cu, 0.9 % Pb, 59 g/t 
Ag & 0.8 g/t Au (Squires & Moore, 2001).  



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 85 
 

Figure 7.3 - Geology of the Victoria Lake Supergroup and adjacent stratigraphy, Central Dunnage 
Zone region, Newfoundland (After Rogers et al., 2006).  

 

Equally prospective for the VLSG is the historical to recent discoveries of significant gold 
mineralization within the supergroup – particularly in the Valentine Lake to Wilding Lake areas, 
along the south-southeastern fringe area of the VLSG (Fig. 7.4). Exploration conducted from 
1985 to present, in the Valentine Lake area, has led to the discovery of numerous 
prospects/deposits over a structural trend of 16 km. These occurrences consist mainly of en 
echelon, tension-gash and/or shear-related, gold-bearing, quartz and quartz-tourmaline vein 
systems which cut the Valentine Lake (granitoid) Intrusive Suite. A recent Press Release (Oct 30, 
2018), By Marathon Gold Corp., on ongoing drill programs in the Valentine Lake area, have 
recently concluded a measured and indicated resource of 45,146,000 tonnes at 1.854 g/t 
(2,691,400 oz of contained gold) and an inferred resource totalling 26,857,000 tonnes of 1.774 
g/t Au (1,531,600 oz of gold).  

More recent (2015-2017) gold discoveries in the Wilding Lake area, located 19-26 km east-
northeast of the Valentine Lake occurrences (along the same regional structural trend), consist 
of similar orogenic-style, structurally-controlled, quartz veins, bearing coarse to very coarse-
grained gold.  

 

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 86 
 

The gold-bearing quartz vein systems comprising the Golden Promise Property prospects, located 
along the north-northwestern fringe of the VLSG, represent a relatively new discovery for the 
supergroup as well. Although of similar orogenic origin, these quartz vein systems are hosted 
within anticlinal folds affecting sedimentary units – being controlled by, or expressed as, axial 
planar breaks, en echelon type structures, spurs and fold-hinge related saddle reefs, quartz 
stockworks and ore chutes, as well as offset-faults and shears (Fig. 7.5) – similar to that 
characterizing the 80 million ounce (Au) Victoria District, of the Lachlan Fold Belt of southeastern 
Australia (Goldfarb et al., 2001 & 1998) and the 1.2 million oz. (Au) Meguma Group, of Nova Scotia 
(Bates, 1987). In both these 'type localities' turbiditic argillite/siliciclastic sediments comprise the 
host rocks affected. The Meguma Group, which contains "60 past producing gold districts" is also 
"considered one of the classic areas of turbidite-hosted gold mineralization" (Kontak et al., 1990; 
Ryan and Smith, 1998). 

The similarity, in geological setting and character, between gold-bearing quartz vein systems of 
the Lachlan Fold Belt and the Victoria Lake Supergroup, is notable in several respects, particularly 
regarding: their (common) mode of development; host rock association (argillites/ 
greywacke/turbidite sequences); and their similar (Ordovician) age and orogenic/tectonic 
development along the (paleo) Gondwanan continental margin.

7.2 Property Geology 
Given the general lack of bedrock exposure throughout the property area, the pertinent 
geology is best summarized in the context of the more salient (regional) features that transcend 
the area – as represented by the 1:50,000-scale mapping study, of NTS area 12A/16, by Kean 
and Jayasinghe (1982) and, herein, schematically represented by former stakeholder to the 
property area, Rubicon Minerals Corp. (2002), as Fig. 7.6). A later, more refined, geological 
interpretation of the Golden Promise Property area, by Rubicon and Placer Dome, in 2003, is 
represented in Fig. 7.7  . These map presentations are based to a large extent, respectively, on 
interpretations derived from a 1966 regional airborne Electromagnetic (EM) survey, 
commissioned by Selco Exploration Co. Ltd/McIntyre Porcupine Mines Ltd, over the Red Indian 
Lake-Grand Falls area (Lazenby, 1966) and a 2003 EM/Magnetic survey, flown by Fugro 
Airborne Surveys Corp. (for Rubicon & Placer Dome), over the former 'Golden Promise Property' 
area (see Figs. 7.7 & 7.8). In both cases, the pronounced electromagnetic (EM) conductive 
signature of the graphitic Caradocian shale sequence – an approx. 450 m wide, distinctive, 
marker horizon – was found to be particularly useful in determining the folded outline of the 
upper Victoria Lake Supergroup stratigraphy.  

[Note, previous reports on the Golden Promise property refer to the Caradocian unit as 
overlying the Victoria Lake Supergroup (VLSG), thus, signifying its exclusion from the 
supergroup. However, based on mapping and compilation studies and nomenclatural revisions 
by Geological Survey of Canada workers, Rogers and van Staal (2003-2005), this sequence is 
now recognized as part of (and is therefore assigned to) the VLSG, thereby, comprising its 
uppermost (and youngest) stratigraphic member within the property area].

7.2.1 VLSG Sedimentary Rocks of the Property Area 
Based on the work of Kean et al. (1982), the VLSG is seen as underlying only the southern half 
of the Golden Promise property (Fig. 7.6). However, results of the 2003 (Rubicon/Placer) 
airborne EM survey indicate the 'low-resistivity' Caradocian unit to have considerably further 
northeastward extension through the property than previously inferred. The linear form of this 
extension would appear to represent the crest or apex of the folded Caradocian shale unit as it 
plunges gently to the northeast, where it appears to have limited exposure through the 
overlying Badger Group sediments (see Fig. 7.7).  

Rocks of the VLSG, in the property area, are divisible into two main units belonging to the 
Ordovician Noel Paul's Group (after the nomenclature of Rogers & van Staal, 2003-2005); these 
include the Caradocian shales of the Lawrence Harbour Formation and the dominantly 
volcanogenic clastic sediments of the Stanley Waters Formation (Sandeman et al., 2007). The 
latter (also informally referred as the Exploits Rapids Formation, by previous workers to the 
property) consists mainly of turbiditic sandstones, siltstones, greywackes and conglomerates 
overlain by argillites and minor cherts which "typically display a cyclic bedding sequence",  i.e., 
with basal conglomerates and pebbly sandstones grading upward into sandstones overlain by 
thinly laminated siltstone or argillite and cherts (Kean et al., 1982; Evans & Kean, 2002). The 
units also commonly display wavy bedding, crossbedding, scouring, and load cast features 
(Steele, 2011 - Crosshair Exploration & Paragon Minerals). The turbiditic nature of much of the 
VLSG sediments is due to slumping within active volcanic arc extensional basins

Airborne EM/Mag Survey. 

 

At the Jaclyn zone, Steele (2011) reported the presence of turbidites consisting of "massive, 
metre-thick beds of felsic, volcaniclastic, arkosic and lithic greywacke" with zones of  
quartzofeldspathic lapilli-ash tuff" (suggesting proximity to a volcanic source); the latter is noted 
to phase out up-stratigraphy due to waning volcanism. Further mention is made of "volcanogenic-
driven hydrothermal alteration … marked by sericite-chlorite-silica-carbonate alteration and 
spotted alteration textures". 
 
The Mid Ordovician to Early Silurian Badger Group, inferred to occupy a significant portion of 
the northeastern property area (though bedrock confirmation is poor), is "comprised of a 
flyschoid sequence of argillite, greywacke, and conglomerate" (Wallis, 2010). These sediments 
are chemically and lithologically distinct from that of the VLSG;  the latter consists mainly of 
mafic to intermediate volcanic and related epiclastic rocks, whereas the Badger Group 
"contains debris from mixed silicic crustal and mafic to ultramafic sources" (Sandeman, Rafuse 
& Copeland, 2010). As mentioned in Section 7.1.1, clastic sediments of the Badger Group were 
derived from the uplifted peri-Laurentian terrane to the west of the Red Indian Line. The group 
is further described as comprising "coarse-grained, thick-bedded, polymictic conglomerates" 
and "medium-grained, lithic wackes" – the latter having "locally abundant, grey-black, 
mudstone beds, rip-up clasts and mudstone lithic fragments" (Sandeman et al., 2010).

7.2.2 Silurian-Devonian Dyke/Sill Intrusives 
A pronounced feature of the property geology, evident from the (2003) airborne magnetic data, is 
the widespread occurrence of ESE-trending (110-130°) mafic dykes (or dyke swarms) which cross-
cut the stratigraphy (Fig. 7.9 ), presumably having their origin as part of the large Silurian-
Devonian intrusive bodies located several km to the west. A report by Copeland and Newport 
(2004) states that these dykes "may be correlative to mafic plutonic rocks that intrude the upper 
levels of the Victoria Lake Supergroup". An age range of Early Silurian-Late Devonian (443-355 Ma) 
is inferred for the dykes which, therefore, post-dates deposition of the Caradocian sequence. 
Where mafic dykes have been encountered in drill holes at the Jaclyn and other gold-bearing 
quartz vein system(s) on the property, the majority are noted to be syn-to late-
deformation/faulting, with some occupying the same structures as the quartz veins themselves 
(Copeland et al., 2004, 2006). 

Copeland et al. (2004) also reported the occurrence of NE-trending, magnetic, dykes which trend 
parallel to the largely NE-oriented stratigraphy of the VLSG. However, a significant number of 
discontinuous linear magnetic bodies, showing conformity with the folded strata (as evident from 
the 2003 airborne magnetic survey), likely represent mafic sills as well. A geological interpretation 
report, on the Golden Promise Property, by Tettelaar (2010), makes mention of diorite sills and 
laccoliths intrusive into conglomerate beds in the area. Gabbroic intrusive bodies may also occur 
as host to auriferous quartz veins, such as seen at the Gabbro Occurrence and, in part, at the 
Linda/Snow White Prospect (southwestern claims area). 

7.2.3 Structure 
The general NE-trending stratigraphy of the VLSG, and associated shallow-dipping to vertical 
bedding dips (within the property area), are influenced by southeast-verging, open to sub-isoclinal, 
F1 folds that plunge moderately northeast (Tettelaar, 2010) – an interpretation based largely on 
the structural mapping of the property area by McNeill (2005). These fold structures are consistent 
with regional fold trends identified by historical mapping within the greater VLSG (see Fig. 7.4).  

McNeill (2005) states that "the most prominent deformational feature within the Golden Promise 
area are folds" which form "outcrop scale to regional scale structures". These are "generally open 
to tight, normal to inclined … with well-developed cleavages", their style and size being dependant 
on the stratigraphic unit, bedding thicknesses and the structural environment involved. 
Furthermore, "many outcrops are characterized by folds that are doubly plunging, resulting in 
elliptical interference patterns of bedding on outcrop surfaces"; this pattern is "commonly 
repeated at the regional scale".  McNeill (2005) also notes that, although many folds are doubly-
plunging, the dominant plunge is northeast, with southwesterly plunges evident locally. "The main 
northeasterly plunge of folds, as measured in the field, is 030°/19° but the actual plunge of any 
large-scale structure will be less (at 13-15°)" (McNeill, 2005). Examples of variable fold 
morphologies, and related structures, in the property area, are shown in Fig. 7.10.

Property. 

 

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 94 
 

Structural mapping by McNeill (2005) also revealed four generations of cleavage in the area – S0cl 
(parallel to bedding), S1 (generally axial planar to F1 folds) and S2 (axial planar to F2 folds). 
Numerous outcrops exhibiting variable cleavage orientations within the same fold – a phenomena 
typical of slate belts. The second-generation (F2) folds are described as having "steeply dipping, 
NW-striking, axial planes that refold earlier structures"; the plunges of these vary "depending on 
the earlier F1 fold geometry" (McNeill, 2005).   

The entire VLSG stratigraphy within the property area, as well as up to several km extending 
farther east, has been recognized, by McNeill (2005), as comprising four main thrust nappes – the 
Badger, Jaclyn, Noel Paul's and Diversion Lake nappes (Fig. 7.11). The structural contacts of these 
are defined as "generally coincident" and stratigraphically-parallel with the Caradocian shales. 
According to McNeill (2005), related thrust-faulting has resulted in some stacking or repetition of 
stratigraphy – and related fold structures (favorable for quartz vein development) – which is seen 
to maximize the quartz vein gold potential of the property. He states "the repetition of favourable 
tectonostratigraphic environments, by several thrust nappes, increases the number of 
prospective, Jaclyn Vein-type, gold deposits" since "each of these nappes host several antiformal 
fold closures that are similar to the Jaclyn area". 

Other structural features of the property, as reported by Tettelaar (2010), include regional syn- to 
late-folding, brittle-ductile, shear zones, trending ENE, NNE and ESE. These were reported by 
Copeland et al. (2004a) as having undergone "episodic reactivation", thereby "acting as conduits 
for mineralized fluids responsible for the formation of the (gold-bearing) quartz vein systems". 
Some ENE-trending breaks represent sinistral strike-slip faults along which both the quartz vein 
systems and the ENE-trending mafic dykes have been emplaced – the dykes, itself, indicating a 
long-lived, syn- to post-folding, relationship with the structures (Tettelaar, 2010). In some cases, 
the ENE-trending structures are "bounded or bent/offset by the NNE-trending structures" 
(Tettelaar, 2010). This assessment has been determined, collectively, from drill-log information, 
interpretation of airborne geophysical data and structural mapping investigations by McNeill 
(2005). Certainly, given the scarcity of bedrock exposure in the area, the 2003 airborne EM-
resistivity/magnetic survey has been particularly useful in helping define both local and regional-
scale fold structures, as well as offset faults, which trend parallel to, or transect, the axial trace of 
the folds (Wallis, 2010). The conductive nature of the Caradocian shale unit, observed in 
conjunction with the high 'resistive' character of the underlying siliciclastics, helps present a 
reliable interpretation of stratigraphy and structure. 

Kean et al (1982) noted at least two periods of deformation for the general area – a 
southeastward-directed (D1) thrusting event related to the Late Ordovician (Taconic) to Early 
Silurian (Salinic) orogenies (445-430 Ma) and a (D2) folding-and-faulting event related to the Late 
Silurian-Early Devonian Acadian orogeny (421-400 Ma). Following closure of the Iapetus Ocean, at 
the end of the Taconic orogeny, Salinic orogenic compression, along the now-designated Red 
Indian Line (RIL) structural zone, was accompanied by downloading of the peri-Gondwanan (ExSZ) 
terrane resulting in the latter's partial subduction beneath the peri-Laurentian (NDSZ) terrane (as 
discussed in Section 5.1.1). This setting is consistent with the recognized structural disposition of 
the regionally-extensive arc sequences of the Buchans-Roberts Arm and Red Indian Lake Groups, 
located along the west side of the RIL – which sequences are now defined as Laurentian overlap 
rocks comprising east to southeast-directed thrust slices (Fig. 7.2 ). This thrusting is evident within 
the property stratigraphy (of the VLSG), by virtue of the thrust nappes recognized by McNeill 
(2005) (Fig. 7.11).

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
The mineral deposit type, characteristic of the property area, is that of orogenic, structurally-
controlled, mesothermal, quartz vein gold mineralization. The development of auriferous quartz 
vein systems within structurally-prepared (folded and faulted) sedimentary units – namely, 
argillites, sandstones and greywacke/turbiditic sequences, of the Victoria Lake Supergroup – 
equates with other orogenic, turbidite/slate belt-hosted gold deposits worldwide. These include 
deposits of the the Lachlan Fold Belt of southeastern Australia, which has produced in excess of 80 
million oz. of gold (Goldfarb et al., 2001 & 1998), and the Meguma Group, of Nova Scotia, which 
has produced around 1.2 million oz. of gold (Bates, 1987). The Meguma Group, which contains "60 
past producing gold districts" is also "considered one of the classic areas of turbidite-hosted gold 
mineralization" (Kontak et al., 1990; Ryan and Smith, 1998).  

The similarity, in geological setting and character, between gold-bearing quartz vein systems of 
the Lachlan Fold Belt and the Golden Promise Property area (of the Victoria Lake Supergroup), is 
notable in several respects, particularly regarding: their (common) mode of development; host 
rock association (argillites/ greywacke/turbidite sequences); and their similar (Ordovician) age and 
orogenic/tectonic development along the (paleo) Gondwanan continental margin. 

With respect to mode of development, the quartz vein systems are controlled by fold-related 
dilational/tensional openings, including axial planar breaks, fold-hinge related saddle reefs, 
stockworks and ore chutes, spurs and en echelon type features. The veins also show infilling along 
shears and offset and/or thrust faults (Johansen, 2001).[For emphasis and convenient reference, 
elements of Figs. 11 and 16, showing the above (Bendigo and Meguma-type) structural controls on 
auriferous quartz vein development, are combined, here, in Fig. 8.1, below]. Alteration, consisting 
of white mica, quartz, carbonate and occasional albite, generally characterize wallrock alteration 
envelopes which may extends up to 10 m from the auriferous veins. Other important elements of 
these quartz vein systems, as noted in relation to the Bendigo Zone goldfields (Lachlan Fold Belt), 
include:  

1) the veins occur in "fields", hosted by short strike-extent faults (<1 km), in areas of 1 km by 
8 to 12 km and parallel the structural grain; 

 

2) Veins are hosted by large antiformal culminations; and 
 

3) The largest tonnage deposits generally occur within permeable turbidites, immediately 
beneath, or within, carbonaceous shale caprock (After Johansen, 2001). 

According to Dominy et al. (2000), the above "types of coarse gold-bearing veins are characterized 
by high grades that are localized and erratic. Effective sampling of these veins is difficult and grade 
distribution can only reliably be obtained from underground development, including close-spaced 
sampling, bulk sampling, and trial mining. Diamond drilling is still an effective measure of 
geological continuity, but it is unlikely that anything above an "Inferred Resource" category can be 
estimated from surface drilling alone".

Evaluation of quartz vein gold mineralization tends to be challenging since it does not lend itself to 
the degree of predictability as would be expected in the case of more pervasive-style 
mineralization where the commodity of interest is more representatively distributed, as per a 
given volume of rock or zone. The reason for this is two-fold:  quartz veins, by their very nature, 
tend to be unpredictable in their occurrence as they represent injection of silica-rich hydrothermal 
fluids into zones of weakness (or openings) which, itself, may appear random; and, the nuggety-
style or 'spotty' occurrence of gold mineralization, within quartz veins, lends uncertainty, as to 
grade and continuity, when channel or drill core sampling. Another important aspect of gold-
bearing quartz veins which may impact on their economic viability for mining, is their size or – in 
the case of small veins – their density or concentration; veins may form sparse or isolated 
occurrences to densely concentrated 'swarms'. 

While there is a predictable pattern of rock behaviour or deformation (due to mechanical stresses 
vs rock properties) – particularly in the form of fold-related axial planar breaks and fold-hinge 
dilational openings – it is uncertain as to what degree (or intensity) such features will develop.  

The assessment report by Mullen (2007) states: "One of the inherent problems in evaluating this 
type of "nuggety" coarse gold deposit is the estimation of its overall grade". In relation to the 
Jaclyn Main Zone, Mullen (2007) further states that "increased (drill hole) density should improve 
the gold tenor and … confirm the geological continuity of the zone". He also notes that, as in the 
case of the Jaclyn Zone area, "detailed exploration and development work at geologically similar 
deposits in Australia and Wales, U.K., has indicated that gold grades, based on wide-spaced 
drilling, consistently understate close-spaced drilling results" (Mullen, 2007; Dominy et al, 2000). 
Dominy et al., (2000) concludes that "bulk samples are likely to be the closest estimators of true 
grade" while John and Thalenhorst (1991) suggest a minimum bulk sample size of 500-1000 tonnes 
per 100,000 tonnes of "resource" (0.5-1%).  

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 98 
 

A redeeming quality of the quartz vein hosted gold mineralization is that it requires no 
metallurgical chemical process, but simply crushing, after which gold is then separated by gravity 
methods; the nugget style of the gold mineralization, as well as its structural and density (weight) 
contrast with quartz, lends itself to easy separation. 

Descriptions (including excerpts from earlier reports) of the various quartz vein hosted gold 
occurrences/prospects on the Golden Promise Property are as follows:  

8.1 JACLYN MAIN ZONE (JMZ) 
To date, the Jaclyn Main Zone (JMZ) vein system has been traced, by drilling, over a strike trend of 
975 m and to a (vertical) depth of 400 m (Sparkes, 2010). The gold-bearing system consists of 
single to multiple, en echelon, quartz veins, which dip steeply SE (at 70°- 85°) for most of its trend, 
though, along its eastern extension, it dips steeply NW. This change is coincident with a variation, 
in strike, as well – from 070° (in the west) to 090°, along its eastern segment (Pilgrim & Giroux, 
2008; Moore, 2003).  

Moore (2003) described the JMZ as follows: "The vein system attains an estimated true thickness 
of close to 4 m, with individual veins up to 2.7 m thick. The quartz veins of the zone are milky 
white to grey in colour, comb-textured to locally vuggy, often stylolitic to banded, and inclusion 
rich – indicative of open-space filling in an extensional tectonic setting. Visible gold distribution 
within a vein is generally restricted to 10-20 cm thick zones, often close to vein margins. Gold 
occurs: i) as specks (0.1mm) to coarser (3 mm) flakes along short fractures oriented perpendicular 
to the vein margin (comb quartz crystal boundaries); ii) along stylolitic seams with fine-grained 
arsenopyrite; iii) as scattered specks along rusty fractures parallel to the vein boundary; and, less 
commonly, as iv) isolated grains in massive quartz". 

"Accessory minerals include calcite, chlorite, sericite, iron-carbonate, arsenopyrite, pyrite, galena, 
sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. Wall rock inclusions locally contain abundant arsenopyrite with lesser 
pyrite". The predominant host rock to the veins consist of "fine-grained, weakly to well bedded, 
mudstone/greywacke intercalated with more granular arkosic greywacke" often hosting mudstone 
clasts up to 2 cm in size (Moore, 2003).  

"Alteration associated with the veining extends up to 15 m either side of the zone but varies 
somewhat according to rock type. The most pronounced alteration is developed in fine-grained 
mudstone as light-green, 1-10 mm spots, and fracture alteration, consisting of silica-sericite-
carbonate, locally coalescing into massive alteration sections. A steeply dipping mafic dyke (0.5-1.2 
m wide) with chilled contacts, "cuts all rock types including the mineralized quartz vein" (Moore, 
2003).  

Further description of the JMZ, is presented by Mullen (2008) who notes: "at its eastern margin 
(Section 5600E), the veining remains quite strong and open in that direction". To the west, the 
vein narrows and is affected by a late brittle fault running subparallel to the zone". During the 
2007 drilling, the near- surface, high-grade, central portion of the zone was "confirmed to consist 
of two en echelon vein segments which overlap by approx. 100 m (Sections 5150E- 5250E) and 
which are separated by 10-20 m" (Mullen, 2008) (see Fig. 6.1 ). This drilling also revealed that 
previous (2002) drill holes, GP02-18 and GP02-19, had been stopped short of the more northerly 
en echelon Main Zone branch.  



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 99 
 

Drilling in both 2006 and 2007, along the central portion of the JMZ, confirmed the existence a 
separate, parallel (albeit, narrow) high grade, VG-bearing (non-stylolitic) quartz vein/silica-flooded 
zone, located 5 m south of the main zone, being situated within the structural hangingwall of the 
JMZ. The zone, herein, named the JM Satellite Zone, was encountered in, at least, three holes, 
returning Au assay grades of:  

327.97 g/t Au/0.40m [GP06-52];  
9.47 g/t Au/1.40m (incl. 27.67 g/t/0.45m)[GP06-61];  
10.37 g/t Au/1.75m (incl. 30.9 g/t /0.30m & 17.73 g/t /0.50m)[GP06-61]; and  
10.41 g/t Au/4.70m (incl. 64.49 g/t/0.50m, 26.59 g/t 0.35m & 5.51 g/t /0.7m)[GP07-92]. 
 
In drill hole GP06-52, a 20 cm (true width) intercept of the JM Satellite zone, revealed 115 specks 
of visible gold (VG). Two narrow (0.5-1 cm) VG-bearing quartz veinlets assayed 10.37 g/T 
Au/1.75m.   

Numerous other high-grade gold intersections, at the JMZ, encompass a range from very narrow 
to significantly wide assay sections including 44.59 g/t Au/0.30m (GP03-31), 36.1 g/t /0.3 (GP03-
25), 68.95 g/t/0.40m, 23.14 g/t over 0.90m (GP02-14), 43.83 g/t/1.45m (GP07-91), 6.87 g/t /1.70m 
(GP07-98), 16.57 g/t/2.55m (GP02-01), 6.51 g/t over 3.10m (GP06-56) and 4.18 g/t /5.20m (GP03-
24). Interestingly, visible gold has been observed in over 80% of the drill holes at the JMZ. 

An historical resource estimate prepared by Pilgrim & Giroux (2008), based on drilling completed 
during 2002 to 2007, yielded 921,000 tonnes averaging 3.02 g/t Au (89,500 ounces of contained 
gold)(Steele, 2011).  

A longitudinal (grade x assay width) representation of the JMZ, based on all drilling to date (2010), 
is shown in Fig. 28. As can be seen from this section, the higher-grade portions of the quartz vein 
system is relatively shallow for the most part, with an apparent (ore shoot) plunge to the east.  
 
8.2 JACLYN NORTH ZONE (JNZ) 

The Jaclyn North Zone (JNZ), located approx. 250 m north of the JMZ, consists of three multiple 
quartz-veined zones (Upper, Middle & Lower Subzones) which have been delineated, by drilling (13 
holes), over a roughly 400 m, ENE/WSW, strike, and down-dip for 165.5 m (Sparkes, 2010). All 
three zones reveal visible gold in drill core.  

The Upper Sub-zone contains up to four individual veins, ranging from 0.25 to 0.70 m in thickness, 
with a best drill intersection of 2.63 g/t Au/1.30m (incl. 11.28 g/t Au/0.30m [GP07-76]). A 
composite assay of multiple veins, in the Middle Sub-zone, produced an assay of 5.24 g/t 
Au/1.70m (GP06-51). The Lower Sub-zone returned an assay of 15.23 g/t Au/0.30m (GP06-47).  

The 2006 and 2007 drilling revealed strong to intense silica-sericite alteration, associated with 
both the Middle and Lower Subzones, which appear to be increasing with depth (Steele, 2011). 
Two of three holes drilled in in 2010 (final drilling) extended the zone significantly to the east with 
intersections of 2.08 g/t Au /0.38m (GP10-100) and 6.19 g/t Au/0.35 m (GP10-103). The third hole 
(GP10-99), which tested the JNZ  below the earlier drilling, encountered 4.68 g/t Au /0.3m at a drill 
depth of 165.5 m. The visible gold bearing zones, encountered in holes GP10-99 and GP10-103, 
appear to correlate with the Upper Subzone (Sparkes, 2010). The intersection in GP10-100 appears 
to correlate with the Middle Subzone.    



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 100 
 

"Unlike the JMZ vein system, which crosscuts the sedimentary host rocks at a high angle (70°- 85° 
SE) to bedding, the JNZ veins run subparallel to bedding, dipping north at 35°-45°" (Pilgrim et al., 
2008)(Fig. 22).   

8.3 JACLYN SOUTH ZONE (JSZ) 

The JSZ, which has been tested by only 4 drill holes, to date, is located 300 m south of the JMZ. It 
consists of two, sub-parallel, locally stylolitic, quartz vein systems – an upper vein (the Alpha Vein), 
intersected over a max. core length of 3.4 m (or est. 3.0m 'true width') and two, smaller (0.03 & 
0.3 m wide) well-laminated, veins (Beta Veins), hosting up to 1-2% pyrite and arsenopyrite. The 
two vein systems trend 080-085° and dip 60-65°S with a drill depth separation of 20-45 m (Pilgrim 
et al., 2008). Initial drill holes (GP03-31 & 33) encountered both quartz vein zones at a distance of 
100 m apart, along a ENE/WSW trend. Later holes GP06-59 and GP06-60 intersected only the 
upper (Alpha) vein system, proving up a total (open-ended) strike length of 200 m for the latter 
(Steele, 2011). The veins are hosted within strongly sericitized and silicified mudstone and lithic 
greywacke, with alteration increasing in proximity to the veins (Copeland et al., 2004).  

The Beta Vein system returned the highest Au grades, with assays of 44.59 g/t/ 0.3 m (or 8.92 g/t 
Au diluted over 1.5 m)(GP03-31) and 2.59 g/t/0.3 m (GP03-33). The Alpha Vein returned only 
elevated Au values of 0.12 g/t Au/0.5m (GP03-31) and 0.19 g/t/0.3m (Mullen, 2006). 

8.4 SHAWN'S SHOT PROSPECT 

The Shawn's Shot Prospect is located roughly 7.5 km southwest of the Jaclyn Zone and consists of 
a 0.3-0.4 m wide quartz vein, having an exposed trend of 2.0 m (at 110°/67-78°S), exposed on the 
west side of the Exploits River. Visible gold is present in the vein which has returned grab sample 
Au assays of 14 g/t, 30 g/t, 34 g/t and 100.5 g/t Au, with elevated Ag (up to 4.5 ppm) and As (up to 
1230 ppm). 
 
Two holes (GP04-45 & 46), drilled at the site, intersected several 10-30 cm wide, stylolitic, quartz 
veins and mafic dykes cutting dominantly mudstone and (lesser) greywacke – the latter host rocks 
showing variable, spotted to patchy and fracture-controlled sericite/chlorite alteration, with trace 
to 1% pyrite and arsenopyrite. Most quartz veins returned low Au values. However, both drill 
holes encountered a 0.3 m (core length) intersection of auriferous quartz veining  within a 
(collective) depth range of 82.0 - 82.8 m (presumably the same vein) which returned assays of 0.6 
g/t Au/0.30m (GP04-45) and 0.43 g/t Au/0.3 m (GP04-46).  
 

8.5 OTTER BROOK SHOWING 
The Otter Brook Occurrence, located along the transition zone between Caradocian shales and 
siliciclastic sediments (approx. 5.0 km southeast of the Shawn's Shot quartz vein), consists of a 5-
30 cm wide, auriferous, quartz breccia vein, having an approx. 10 m 'exposed' trend along 0/65°SE. 
Up to 2% chalcopyrite, 5% pyrite, with trace arsenopyrite, occur along the vein. Grab sample 
results include up to 1.183 g/t Au, 2.2 g/t Au and 3.2 g/t Au.

abundant, cm-scale, quartz-calcite veins/veinlets. The alteration consists of variable (weak to 
intense) sericitization, chloritization, Fe-carbonatization and silicification.  
 
The vein system has an 'exposed' strike-length of 35 m, along 080°/75°S. The core section of the  
vein is characterized by generally massive (bull quartz), while the margins display 
laminated/stylolitic textures with up to 2% pyrite and trace to 2% arsenopyrite associated 
(Copeland et al, 2005). Grab sample results from the vein include assays of 3.8 g/t Au and 1.96 g/t 
Au, with up to 4240 ppm arsenic (As). The latter Au value was obtained from the southern margin of 
the vein system where visible gold was noted.  
 
The first of two holes (GP04-39 & 40), drilled at the Christopher Zone, intersected a 0.7 m wide 
quartz vein breccia (fault) zone, at a drill depth of 73.2 m, representing a possible continuation of 
the vein exposed on surface. Here, brecciated greywacke, with angular quartz vein fragments cut 
by later-generation quartz-calcite-chlorite veins and veinlets, returned an assay of 0.03 g/t Au/0.7 
m.  
 
The second hole (GP04-40), which targeted the vein at a distance of 50 m east of the trench 
exposure, intersected a 1.1 m wide (core length) massive quartz vein, at a depth of 40.2-41.3 m 
and an adjacent (contiguous) 1.5 m wide zone of 3-4 cm wide, pyrite-arsenopyrite bearing, 
stylolitic, quartz veins, within weakly altered mudstone and greywacke. The best assay result was 
0.025 g/t Au /1.1 m (main quartz vein). A 40 cm interval of core was reported lost immediately 
above the intercept, possibly corresponding with the fault/shear zone observed adjacent to the 
vein at surface.  
 

8.7 NORTHWEST ZONE (NWZ)  
The Northwest Zone is located on the northern limb of the Jaclyn Anticline, approx. 450 m west of 
(along strike from) the JNZ (Fig. 26). The initial drill hole test (GP04-41) which targeted the 
(inferred) contact zone between the Caradocian shale unit and underlying siliciclastics, intersected 
four, 10-15 cm wide, laminated, quartz veins (at 26.1-30.35 m depth), returning elevated Au 
values throughout – the highest, being 0.10 g/t Au/1.35 m and 0.16 g/t Au/0.3 m. A second quartz 
vein zone, intersected at a shale/greywacke contact (at 87.3-88.0m), is described as a composite 
structure consisting of: a 20 cm wide, laminated, vuggy, quartz vein; a 10 cm wide breccia zone 
containing fragments of mafic dyke; a 0.4 m wide, ankerite-altered, mafic dyke; and a 60 cm wide, 
pyrite-arsenopyrite-chalcopyrite bearing, massive to laminated and stylolitic, quartz vein. A 
sample assay of 0.711 g/t Au/0.7 m (incl. 3.42 g/t Au/0.4 m) was obtained for the zone. Patchy 
sericite and chlorite alteration is associated and persists, from there, throughout remainder of 
hole (to 175.9 m).

Southwestern Golden Promise Property Area  

8.8    LINDA/SNOW WHITE PROSPECT 
The Linda-Snow White prospect is described as a composite zone of quartz veining and quartz 
breccia, up to 5 m wide, cutting mudstone, siltstone, greywacke and gabbro. The vein system has 
an 'exposed' strike trend of 170 m, with a drill-defined strike dimension of 230 m, tested to a 
vertical depth of 110 m. The vein system remains open in all directions. The veins contain variable, 
though generally, minor pyrite, arsenopyrite and trace galena, with locally abundant gold 
occurring as specks or nuggets along dark stylolitic bands on, or close to, vein margins (Froude, 
2005 & Pilgrim et al., 2008). Wall rock alteration consists of minor iron-carbonate, sericite and 
local chlorite.  

Although grab samples from the vein system yielded numerous anomalous gold assay results – 
including many in the range of 1.28 g/t to 105.28 g/t Au (as well as an exceptional 'high' of 232.25 
g/t Au) – channel sampling and drilling (16 holes) did not prove up any consistently high-grade Au 
results (see Sections 6.2.1.5 & 6.2.1.6). Most drill core samples returned assays in the range of 
131-798 ppb Au over (core length) intervals of 0.14-1.78 m. Notable intersections included 19.5 
g/t Au /1.15 m (incl. 63.2 g/t Au/0.35 m) and 1.5 g/t Au/0.50 m. The best channel sample assay 
result was 29.7 g/t Au/ 0.5 m (Morgan et al., 2006). Associated As results generally range from 
several hundred ppm to >2200 ppm (ICP detection limit). 

8.9 GABBRO OCCURRENCE 
The Gabbro Occurrence, located 8.5 km ESE of the Linda-Snow White Prospect, consists of a 25 x 
55 m area (minimum exposure) of iron-carbonate altered gabbro, cut by numerous (< 4 cm wide) 
quartz veins and veinlets, hosting up to 10% pyrite (Copeland, 2006). Grab sample Au results 
include several assays between 1.35 g/t and 10.04 g/t Au, as well as many other results in the 
range of 119 - 955 ppb Au (Sparkes, 2006; Copeland, 2006).  
 
8.10 AURIFEROUS QUARTZ BOULDER OCCURRENCES 
The widespread occurrence of abundant auriferous quartz float represents probable evidence of 
several yet-undiscovered quartz vein occurrences or deposits on the property. Such occurrences 
include the Branden, Justin's Hope and Jaclyn West quartz boulder trains. As mentioned in Section 
6.1.2.7, the Justin's Hope (335.9 g/t Au) boulder occurrence lies atop 15.8 m of glacial till cover 
which, most likely, precludes any direct linkage of the quartz float to the immediate subsurface 
bedrock. The same is, likely, true of the extensive auriferous quartz boulder trains over the Jaclyn 
Zone where significant till thicknesses are present as well. In such cases, the sources of the 
anomalous float are inferred to lie farther 'up-ice' to the southwest. Where anomalous 
geochemical Au results have been obtained over deep tills, these may be similarly derived from 
'up-ice', given that soils can developed from the glacially-transported (gold-bearing) parent 
material.  

 
A summary of anomalous quartz float, and possible related soil occurrences, include the following:  
 

Branden Boulder Train: Historical Au assay results of 80.7 g/t , 72.1 g/t, 62.6 g/t, 22.6 g/t, 20.5 g/t 
and 15.53 g/t Au (2017 exploration sampling results include 57.2 g/t, 233 ppb & 200 g/t Au). 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 103 
 

  
Justin's Hope Boulder Train: Au assays: 335.9 g/t (9.8 oz/t), 10.2 g/t, 116 ppb, 99 ppb, 40 ppb, 20 
ppb, 17 ppb, 16 ppb and 14 ppb (2017 results include 9 ppb & 100 ppb Au).  

Jaclyn Zone Boulder Train: Au assays: 353.4 g/t, 45.5 g/t, 24.5 g/t, 16.3 g/t Au, 4 g/t (the 2017 
sampling returned assays of 70.9 g/t, 6.11 g/t, 1.63 g/t, 420 ppb & 150 ppb Au; these results relate 
to surface quartz float samples and not to the abundant, highly anomalous, quartz float found, at 
depth, within the 2017 trench sites ). Soil sample results over the Jaclyn Zone area (Lines 47+00E 
to 56+00E) which may also have glacial origins, 'up-ice', include several multi-station gold 
anomalies of >15 ppb Au with a 'high' of 8995 ppb Au, and assays of up to 102 ppb and 273 ppb 
Au over the Jaclyn East area. 

Jaclyn West Area 
 
Rip Pond Boulder Occurrence: Six of nine float samples consisting of shale-hosted quartz veins, 
taken from the eastern side of the pond, returned >150 ppb Au, the highest being 1.4 g/t Au. 
Some of the veins host up to 20% chalcopyrite, pyrite and arsenopyrite, yielding assays of up to 
2.74% Cu, 1565 ppm Co, 4450 ppm As, 11 ppm Sb, 6.2 ppm Ag and 37 ppm Bi.  
 
Northwest Zone Area: Several laminated-textured quartz boulders, bearing up to 3% arsenopyrite 
(atop 4.6 m of till), returned elevated to anomalous Au values – the highest being 34 ppb, 98 ppb 
and two values at 25 ppb Au. A single-station (110 ppb Au) soil anomaly was identified nearby. 

GP04-42 Drill Site: A number of auriferous, arsenopyrite-bearing, quartz boulders, located 85 m 
north of the drill collar, returned assays of 200-750 ppb Au (a 12.5 m till thickness was determined 
at the drill site, itself). 

GP04-43 Drill Site: A three-station soil gold anomaly, of 26-36 ppb (located 630 m WSW of the 
Northwest Zone) was the target of a drill hole test which revealed a till depth of 12.1 m.  

GP04-44 Drill Site: Several quartz breccia float, assaying up to 1 g/t Au, were found overlying 4.3 
m of till cover at this site.  

Approximately 800 m WNW (along strike) from the GP04-44 site, are a number of angular quartz 
boulders, up to 0.8 m in size, which returned Au values of up to 162 ppb. The boulders host 
mudstone wall rock material, but no  (visible) sulphides. 

[Note: 17.5% of the 257 float samples collected over the Jaclyn-Jaclyn West area assayed >150 ppb 
Au, with 5.8% assaying at >0.5 g/t Au. Corresponding arsenic assays included values as high as 
7630 ppm and >10,000 ppm (Copeland, et al., 2005)].

9 EXPLORATION 
Mineral exploration activities, by Great Atlantic Resources Corp., were carried out on the Golden 
Promise Property, during May to December 2017 and May to August 2018. All work, with the 
exception of a trenching program conducted on Mineral Licence 21281M, consisted of 
preliminary, reconnaissance-type prospecting and rock/soil sampling, sufficient to meet minimal 
assessment requirements for impending work-due-date deadlines on Mineral Licences 24015M, 
24017M, 24018M, 24021M, 25156M, 25161M, 26162M, 21474M, 22313M, 25067M, 25916M, 
24305M, 24311M and 21970M; this work was deemed adequate, for the interim, until such time a 
more focused exploration plan/strategy and budget could be implemented. A further objective of 
this initial work, by Great Atlantic, was to provide verification (by a "Qualified Person") regarding 
the nature of the historically-reported gold mineralization and host geology. Consultant geologist, 
David Martin (P. Geo), and assistant/prospector, Bruce Stewart (both of New Brunswick), were 
retained, by Great Atlantic, to carry out the necessary mineral licence assessments during 2017. 
Consultant geologist, Paul Delaney (P.Geo.) and assistant, Art Clarke (both of Newfoundland and 
Labrador), were retained to carry out the necessary mineral licence requirements during 2018. 
David Martin (P.Geo.) also carried out a portion of the 2018 work. 
 
During the course of this work, visits were made, by D. Martin (P. Geo), to the sites of the high-
grade, gold-bearing, quartz float occurrences, including the Jaclyn Zone, Justin's Hope and Branden 
(glacial) boulder trains, as well as to the (historically trenched & drilled) Christopher, Shawn's Shot 
and Linda/Snow White quartz vein systems; no observations could be made at the Jaclyn North, 
Jaclyn South and Jaclyn Main sites, as the original trenches emplaced over these have been refilled 
(under site reclamation). Present trenching, however, performed during June-July 10, 2017, on Lic. 
21281M, did provide (albeit limited) exposure for one of the Jaclyn North veins (as discussed 
below). 
 
For most of the property areas examined, outcrop was found to be sparse to non-existence over 
wide areas, thus, necessitating a focus on soil testing and/or sampling of quartz float – which 
methods (combined) have proven effective in the discovery of the more significant prospects, to 
date. Soil sampling involved localized areas of coverage with samples collected at mainly 25 and 
50 m spacings. All soil and rock samples were GPS-recorded.  
 
9.1 2017 Exploration  
 
The 2017 exploration program resulted in the collection of 160 soils and 149 rock samples. Rock 
sampling included 52 samples collected during the trenching program, on Lic. 21281M, and five 
'check' samples from the Christopher, Shawn's Shot and Linda-Snow White quartz vein 
occurrences, on Mineral Licences 21281M, 21474M and 21970M, respectively. A list of samples 
collected on all mineral licences concerned is given in Table 9.1 . 
 
Although most 2017 samples returned negligible assay results, anomalous gold (Au) and/or arsenic 
(As) values were obtained, for a significant percentage of these, reaffirming the strong association 
between the quartz vein hosted gold and arsenopyrite mineralization on the property. It is evident 
that arsenic represents an important pathfinder element for the discovery of gold mineralization 
in this particular type of environment.

The absence of appreciable results for some mineral licences, however, bears no reflection on the 
overall exploration potential of these areas, given that the present sampling, for the most part, 
was of a very cursory nature, involving only small select areas – essentially, a 'first pass' 
evaluation, to meet minimum assessment requirements for the 2017 assessment period.  
 
[With respect to the following discussion, rock and soil sample number prefixes (GP-R-017- & GP-S-
017-) are, herein, shortened to GPR- and GPS-, respectively, for the sake of brevity and quick 
referencing].  

 
 Sample highlights and important observations, pertaining to the 2017 field season, are as follows: 

 
Mineral Licence 24015M  
 

Three general areas of Lic. 24015M were investigated under the 2017 assessment, including: the 
area of the Branden quartz float/gold occurrences (northern claims area); the area inclusive of, 
and just north of, the Justin's Hope quartz float/gold occurrences (east-central claims area); and 
site of a chalcopyrite-bearing sulphide vein (southeasternmost claims). 
 
Four of the 15 rock samples collected in the area of the Branden Occurrence (Fig. 9.1) are 
described, by geologist, D. Martin (P. Geo), as consisting of grey meta-sandstone, greywacke and 
siltstone, cut by NE- to ENE-striking, cm-scale, rusty, pyrite-bearing, quartz veinlets. Assays for 
these returned only 'detection-limit' values for Au (<5 ppb) and As (<5 ppm). Most of the 
remaining 11 rock samples consisted of angular float of the same. Two float samples of sericitized 
sandstone (GPR-30 & 32), cut by 30-50% rusty pyrite-bearing quartz veins, returned 200 g/t Au 
and 233 ppb Au, respectively (visible gold was observed in GPR-30). Two other samples (GPR-33 & 
35), of angular quartz float, returned 57.2 g/t Au and 340 ppb Au, respectively (the latter sample 
was collected as a composite sample of multiple quartz boulders measuring up to 0.5 m across).

Figure 9.1 - 2017 Sample Location Map for the northern portion of Mineral Lic. 24015M. 

 

 
The highest As assays included 454 ppm (GPR-30) and 559 ppm (GPR-33). A couple of the above 
samples revealed anomalous concentrations of Pb, Ag and Bi, as listed below. 
 

GPR-30 (200 g/t Au (VG), 454 ppm As, 66 ppm Pb, 4.4 ppm Ag & 8 ppm Bi)  
GPR-32 (233 ppb Au)  
GPR-33 (57.2 g/t Au, 559 ppm As, 130 ppm Pb, 1.6 ppm Ag & 4 ppm Bi)  
GPR-35 (340 ppb) 
 
 
 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 107 
 

All seven reconnaissance soils samples (GPS-44 to 50), taken in the general vicinity of the Branden 
Occurrence (Fig. 9.1), returned only detection-limit Au values, while most did reveal significantly 
elevated As values (at 8.9-18.4 ppm).  
 
The discovery of quartz-veined (sedimentary) bedrock, approx. 200 m SSW of the Branden 
boulders, suggest the possibility that this float may be locally derived – a suggestion worthy of 
follow-up investigation. An important feature of the bedrock occurrences in the area is that they 
reveal typical Victoria Lake Supergroup (VLSG) siliciclastics, such as comprising the host rocks to 
the main quartz vein gold prospects to the south (Copeland et al., 2005). Based on the structural 
mapping results of McNeill (2005), Copeland et al (2005) suggested the same (VLSG) sediments 
may be exposed as an erosional ' window' through the overlying Badger Group – such an exposure 
being facilitated by a 'doming' effect created by a doubly-plunging F1 anticlinal feature that 
underlies the area (as shown in Fig. 7.10d). 
 
In the east-central portion of Lic. 24015M (Fig. 9.2), approx. 1.0 km northeast of the Justin's Hope 
Occurrence, two of six float samples of greywacke/sandstone, hosting minor disseminated pyrite 
and 1-3 cm wide, rusty, quartz veins, each assayed at 50 ppb Au (GPR-15 & 16), with 
corresponding As values of <5 ppm & 239 ppm.  
 
Two E-W trending, 250m-spaced, reconnaissance, soil lines, emplaced across the general area of 
the float samples resulted in a total of 43 soil samples (GPS-1 to 43) (Fig. 9.2) – most of which 
yielded elevated to anomalous arsenic values (at 12.0-26.6 ppm). Several elevated responses for 
Au were also obtained, including two widely-spaced values (of 7 & 8 ppb), on the northern line, 
and 5 values of elevated to anomalous Au (up to 17 ppb), on the southern line. Three of the latter 
values (9, 13 & 17 ppb Au) form a multi-station anomaly (GPS-6 to 8). Also interesting for this area 
is the presence of elevated Cu (42.5 ppm), in association with several elevated to anomalous 
(granophile-related) elements, including Mo (43.7 ppm), Sb (5.8 ppm) and As (87 ppm), as well as 
0.18 ppm Te (GPS-13). A second sample, taken approx. 125 m distant, gave 13.65 ppm Mo, 19.5 
ppm As, 4.1 ppm Sb and 0.19 ppm Te (GPS-18) (Fig. 9.2). [The concentration of Te (Tellurium) is 
significant given that its average crustal abundance is 0.001-0.005 ppm]. 
 
Final sampling on Lic. 24015M involved the collection of two 2 bedrock samples (GPR-37 & 38) 
from the far southeastern corner of the licence (approx. 700 m SE of the Exploits River). The 
exposure is described, in a sample data sheet, provided by D. Martin (2017), as "brownish-grey, 
siliceous, metasediment with 5-10%, rusty, sulphide-bearing, quartz veins, 1-8 cm wide. The veins 
are noted to be vertical and trending 090-095°. [Regional government mapping indicates the 
stratigraphy of immediate area to be NE to NNE-striking and dipping 75-80°E (Evans et al., 1994)]. 
A single anomalous value of 5940 ppm Cu was obtained from the exposure – the related sample 
(GPR-38) consisting exclusively of sulphide-rich quartz vein material. No appreciable Au or As 
values were associated.

Mineral Licence 25067M 
 

Assessment work performed on Lic. 25067M was undertaken in conjunction with that carried out 
on the adjacent (east-central) claims area of 24015M. Prospecting and sampling conducted just 
inside the eastern boundary of Lic. 25067M,  including around the site of the Justin's Hope quartz 
float-hosted gold occurrences, resulted in the collection of 4 rock samples (GPR-7-9 & 16) and 6 
soils (GP-S-19 to 24) – the latter comprising the western extensions of the two soil lines on Lic. 
24015M (Fig. 9.2).  

Two of three rock (float) samples, taken in the immediate area of the Justin's Hope gold 
occurrences, returned Au assays of 9 ppb (GPR-9) and 100 ppb (GPR-8). These were described, by 
D. Martin, as consisting of angular, rusty, float of dark grey metasediment, with abundant pyrite 
and trace chalcopyrite (GPR-9) and a composite sample composed of multiple rusty, vuggy, quartz 
vein float, with minor arsenopyrite (GPR-8). A value of >2200 ppm As is associated with the latter, 
while GPR-9 revealed a number of other interesting results, including 59 ppm Co, 197 ppm Cr, 302 
ppm Cu, 3.49 % S, 316 ppm W and 395 ppm Zn).  

 
Mineral Licence 24017M 
 

A total of 19 rock and 80 soils were collected from two general areas of Lic. 24017M – the 
northwestern corner area of the licence (NW of the Exploits River and Buchans Highway), and the 
south-central part of the licence (1.75-2.0 km SE of the river) (Fig. 9.3). 
 
Only one of ten float samples, taken from the northwestern corner area of the licence returned an 
elevated assay result, this being 8 ppb Au. Most of the float material consisted of sandstone cut by 
10-20% (< 3cm wide) pyrite-bearing quartz veins which included minor stockwork (pers. comm, D. 
Martin, 2017).  
 
Soil samples collected for this area proved more interesting. Sampling was conducted on three 
reconnaissance lines, two of which extended north and roughly NW from the Buchans Highway 
and, the other trending east-west. Five of the 70 sample sites returned elevated to anomalous Au 
values of 9-31 ppb, while two others yielded highly anomalous values of 212 ppb (GPS-130) and 
236 ppb Au (GPS-81) (Fig. 9.3).  
 
Elevated to anomalous soil arsenic (As) values, however, were more pervasive, with 42 samples 
(60%) yielding 10.7-50.7 ppm As, 6 samples (8.5%) at 59.8-103.5 ppm As (GPS-155-160 & 110) and 
2 samples at 121 & 327 ppm As (GPS-111 & 112). Interestingly, the most elevated to highly 
anomalous As responses form a contiguous trend, comprising a large multi-station anomaly in the 
northwestern corner area of the licence.

Mineral Licence 21474M 
 

The 2017 investigation of Lic. 21474M (Fig. 9.4 ) was restricted to the more accessible western 
portion of the licence (i.e., west of the Exploits River) – particularly, around the site of the Shawn's 
Shot (bedrock) quartz-vein gold occurrence, located on the west side of the river. The vein is 0.35-
0.4 m wide, with an 'exposed' strike/trend of 2.0 m (at 110°/67-78°S) at which point it disappears 
into the river. 
 
Subcrop vein material, hosting abundant visible gold, sampled by W. Mercer, in 2003, returned an 
assay of 35 g/t Au, while subsequent samples, by Rubicon Minerals (also in 2003), produced assays 
of 14 g/t and 30 g/t Au. During hand trenching of the vein, by Rubicon, in 2004, four grab samples 
produced assays of >150 ppb Au – the highest being 100.5 g/t Au (with 4.5 ppm Ag & 1230 ppm 
As). A single chip sample (GPR-203) was taken across the vein, in 2017, which gave an assay of 
48.2 g/t Au over 0.32 m.  Prospecting revealed no 'visible' west-northwest continuation of the 
quartz vein beyond the river.  
 
Mineral Licences 24018M and 24021M  

 

Two float samples and 23 soil samples were collected on Lic. 24018M, none of which produced 
any appreciable assay results. Similarly, on Lic. 24021M, three float samples and six soils were 
collected, returning negligible results – with the exception of a single elevated Au response, of 7 
ppb (GPS-76) (Fig. 9.4).

Preliminary reconnaissance work on Licences 24305M and 21970M (southwestern property area), 
resulted in a total of 23 rock samples of mainly float (Fig. 9.5). With the exception of two bedrock 
'check' samples taken from the Linda-Snow White quartz vein system (on Lic. 21970M), no 
significant assays were returned. The two grab samples collected at the prospect returned (+150 
mesh size sample fraction) assays of 1227 ppb and 15 ppb Au, however, with only 27 ppb and 7 
ppb Au, respectively, for the weighted average assay result. 

Prospecting along the north side of the Exploits River, 4 km east of the prospect, revealed 
numerous quartz veins/veinlets (up to 3 cm wide) cutting argillite, along an orientation of 105-
110°/55N to subvertical. No appreciable results were obtained for float or bedrock samples in this 
area.

Mineral Licence 21281M 

Initial visits to Mineral Licence 21281M, by Great Atlantic, during 2017, involved check sampling at 
the Christopher Vein trench site (located 400 m west of the Jaclyn South Zone)(Fig. 9.6) as well 
investigation of quartz float distributed along the Jaclyn Zone boulder trains; with respect to the 
Jaclyn Zone area, no observation of the quartz vein systems could be made as all historical 
trenches have underwent reclamation (re-filled). At the Christopher trench, grab samples were 
taken from the north and south (stylolitic) vein margins, resulting in weighted average assay 
results of 540 ppb and 60 ppb Au (for samples GP-R-017-200 & 201, respectively). In the case of 
the first sample, a 2100 ppb Au was obtained for the +150 mesh-size sample fraction. For the 
second, a 60 ppb Au was also obtained for the -150 mesh fraction (Table 9.2).  
 
Within the Jaclyn boulder train area, a total of seven quartz float samples were collected, four of 
which produced significant Au results – having weighted average assays of 0.42-70.9 g/t Au 
(samples GP-R-17-205 to 208). These were obtained from an area located 125-150 m north to 
northwest of the (later established) T4 trench site (Table 9.2).  
 
A total of 52 grab, chip and channel samples were collected during the trenching operation on the 
Jaclyn North and Jaclyn South Zones with most yielding anomalous Au results, as discussed below 
and listed in Table 9.2.

The trenching project was carried out during June 28 - July 11, 2017, using an excavator, operated 
by local contractor J & T Welding & Construction, of Badger, NL. The program was designed to 
investigate further northeast to east-northeast extensions of the Jaclyn North and Jaclyn South 
quartz vein systems. Supervision and sampling were conducted by David Martin (P. Geo.), with 
assistance provided by prospector, Bruce Stewart. Trench mapping and additional sampling was 
carried out by the co-author, W. Jacobs. 
 
A total of 6 trenches were excavated and sampled in the area of the Jaclyn prospects (Fig. 9.6 ); all 
were excavated to depths of generally 2.5 to 3.0 m, with widths of 1.5 to 2.0 m. A total of 54 
samples were collected from the trenches, most of which consisted of quartz float exposed at 
depths of 1.5-3.0 m. Seven of the samples consisted of channels taken across the Jaclyn North 
quartz vein exposure in Trench 1.

Trenching – Jaclyn North Zone 
 

Trenching along the 'projected' ENE extension of the Jaclyn North Zone (JNZ) resulted in the 
excavation of 4 trenches spaced over a strike distance of 220 m, with individual lengths of 138 m 
(T1), 116 m (T2), 30 m (T3) and 71 m (T4)(Fig. 9.6). For the most part, trenching was not successful 
in reaching bedrock, due to excessive glacial till cover, thus, greatly limiting the degree of bedrock 
mapping and sampling that could be done. Variably-oriented laminations, observed in sparse 
occurrences of mainly argillite and greywacke, suggest the presence of local, small-scale, folds, 
throughout.  

Trench 1 – Mapping and Sampling Results 

Placement of Trench 1 (T1) was determined by the surface projection of the gold-bearing quartz 
vein zone encountered in (historical) drill hole GP10-103, collared 200 m ENE of the drill-
delineated section of the JNZ (Fig. 9.6). The trench was located approx. 20 m east of the drill 
section plane of GP-10-103.  

Despite the lack of bedrock encountered, excavation of the T1 site was successful in exposing a 
1.0-1.5 m wide quartz vein at a depth of 2.0-3.0 m (Fig. 9.7) – its location, roughly corresponding 
with the inferred surface projection of a 0.7 m wide quartz vein intersected in GP-10-103 (believed 
to correlate with the Upper Sub-Zone vein system, of the JNZ). Limited widening of the trench 
undertaken at the site of the quartz vein, resulted in a total strike length exposure of 4.5 m. The 
vein trends 075° to 090° with a dip of 50-60°N – its variable attitude being due to deformation. No 
intact extension of the vein was observed trending east of the trench (at least at the 3m depth 
reached) due to the vein's highly fractured/friable condition and, thus, remobilization as frost-
heaved rubble. Slickenside features along fracture surfaces reveal post-veining deformation with 
evidence of low-angle thrusting from the northwest (this is consistent with the regional structural 
interpretations outlined in Sect. 7.2.3). 

The T1 quartz vein is moderately to strongly fractured and Fe-stained, with an upper (0.2-0.4 m 
wide) marginal zone characterized by bluish-grey stylolitic seams and bands, hosting 
sporadic/minor occurrences of pyrite, arsenopyrite, rare galena and visible gold. Similar banding is 
seen along a small section of its poorly exposed footwall margin. These zones show evidence of 
multiple, discrete to diffusive, silica injections. In contrast, the central part of the vein consists of 
massive (bull) quartz. Both the hangingwall and footwall host rock consist of argillite having 20-30 
cm wide zones of strong to intense, cm-scale, quartz veining (including stockwork), immediately 
adjacent to the main vein. Moderate to strong sericitization and silicification are associated.  

[For the sake of brevity in the following discussion of sample results, an abbreviated form of the 
sample labels, are used, as per the following examples: GP-R-017-210 = GPR-210; Channel sample 
GP-T1-CH1 = CH1].

A total of 7 channel samples were taken across sections of the quartz vein zone (including the 
immediate hangingwall). Samples were confined to three cross-sections of the vein, spaced 
roughly 1.0 m apart, each consisting of 2 or 3 contiguous samples. In addition, a 1.5 m chip sample 
was taken across the entire vein width, 1.4 m west of the channel samples.   

Four of the six channels, from the vein, itself, yielded highly anomalous Au results for the +150 
mesh-size sample fractions  – including 6.33 g/t /0.42m (CH3), 7.09 g/t/0.69m (CH4), 1.1 g/t/0.6m 
(CH6) and 35.5 g/t /0.2m (CH7) (Table 9.2 ). A sample cut across the quartz veinlet stockwork zone 
comprising the hangingwall argillite returned 833 ppb Au /0.2m (CH1). The weighted average (wt. 
ave.) analyses for the above samples (combining the +150 & -150 mesh size fractions), produced 
lower, though, elevated to anomalous, Au results – 10 ppb (CH1), 67 ppb (CH3), 118 ppb (CH4), 
141 ppb (CH6) and 691 ppb (CH7).  

The 1.5 m chip sample (GPR-214), taken across the vein, returned 723 ppb Au (+150-mesh 
fraction) or 285 ppb (wt. ave. analysis). Grab samples of the sericite-altered hangingwall and 
footwall zones yielded 30 ppb Au (GPR-247) and 284 ppb Au (GPR-248), respectively. However, a 
0.5 m chip sample (GPR-215) of the footwall argillite, cut by four (<2 cm wide) quartz veins, 
returned <5ppb Au.  

Two composite grab samples (GPR-213 & 245) of quartz subcrop/rubble, marking the eastward 
continuation of the vein gave weighted average Au assay values of 315 ppb and 208.51 g/t Au, 
respectively.  

Three of the 7 float samples collected from other parts of the trench, consisted of angular quartz 
vein debris (up to 0.3 m wide) – two of which returned (+150 mesh fraction) assay results of 328.8 
g/t Au (GPR-221) and 184.4 g/t Au (GPR-216), or, respectively, 0.998 g/t and 1.676 g/t Au (wt. ave. 
results). These exhibited banding effects and bluish-grey stylolitic seams/fractures, defining the 
original vein margins, as well as pronounced reddish-brown to greenish-yellow staining due to the 
oxidation of minor pyrite and arsenopyrite.  

The remaining 5 float samples and 3 bedrock samples, from the T1 trench, consisted of mainly 
light to pale green, sericite altered, argillite and greywacke, cut by abundant quartz veinlets. One 
float sample (GPR-209), cut by a 6 cm quartz vein, returned an assay of 30.24 g/t Au (wt. ave). A 
second float sample (GPR-210) and a bedrock sample (GPR-248) gave regular fire assay Au results 
of 797 ppb and 284 ppb, respectively.  

Sample site GPR-212, located 25 m south of the main vein, is interesting in that it consists of a 
dense concentration of quartz rubble, up to 35 cm in size (composite sample assaying 118 ppb 
Au), exposed over a 1.5 m section of trench, within 1.0 m of surface – similar to that found 
adjacent to, and atop, the main vein. The 25 m separation between this occurrence and the 
trenched vein exposure to the north, is consistent with interval between the Upper and Middle- 

Subzone vein systems encountered in drill hole GP10-103. An exposure of sericite-altered argillite, 
cross-cut by abundant quartz veinlets, nearby, may be a further indication of the proximity of such 
Subzone vein systems encountered in drill hole GP10-103. An exposure of sericite-altered argillite, 
cross-cut by abundant quartz veinlets, nearby, may be a further indication of the proximity of such 
a (second) vein system, at depth. Unfortunately, trenching, here, was hampered by rapid water 
inflow and did not extend below 1.5 m.  



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 120 
 

[Note, with respect to GP10-103, a 0.7 m wide quartz vein intersection was encountered, at 64.85-
65.55 m, which yielded an interval of 6.19 g/t Au/0.35 m, A roughly 7.0 m wide zone of significant 
quartz-carbonate veining, with minor pyrite, arsenopyrite and trace sphalerite and galena, was 
also intersected at 89.55-96.46m, which returned two sample intervals of 0.066 g/t Au/0.35 m 
(89.55-89.9m) and 0.066 g/t/0.9 m (at 94.1-95.0 m)].  

Trenches 2 to 4 - Mapping and Sampling Results 

As in the case of T1, only sparse bedrock (and questionable bedrock) occurrences of 
interbedded/interlaminated argillite, greywacke and minor chert, with local sericite/silica 
alteration and minor quartz veinlet swarms, were mapped in T2 to T4 (Figs. 9.7 & 9.8 ). As well, 
significant clusters of (possibly frost-heaved) quartz vein rubble, exposed at depths of 2.0-3.0 m (in 
T2 & T4), were noted, which may suggest proximity to underlying bedrock/quartz vein sources.  

With the exception of one bedrock sample (from T3), all samples from T2 to T4 were taken of 
angular quartz float (0.2-0.7 m in size) having banded and stylolitic textures with generally trace to 
minor pyrite and arsenopyrite.  

Most of the 14 quartz float samples (GPR-221 to 234) collected from T2 returned elevated to 
anomalous Au values, including three at 1.04 g/t (GPR-225), 4.505 g/t (GPR-225) and 1.897 g/t Au 
(GPR-226). In fact, samples GPR-224 and 225 were taken from a cluster of angular quartz float, 
located at the mid-section of T2, which occurs in rough alignment with the projected ENE 
extension of the Jaclyn North (Upper Subzone) vein encountered in T1 (Fig. 9.7 ). Sample GPR-229, 
taken from a significant cluster of quartz float in the northern section of T2, returned a +150 mesh 
assay analysis of 3.28 g/t Au (or wt. ave. assay of 67 ppb Au).  

Trenching at the T3 site was hampered by wet (partially boggy) ground conditions to the north and 
deepening bedrock to the south, resulting in limited excavation work (Fig. 9.7 ). Interestingly, in 
the southern section of the trench, a zone of laminated argillite and chert (or silicified seams) cut 
by a dense swarm of parallel-trending quartz veinlets, was exposed over a 0.5 m width before 
'dropping off' steeply into (deeper) till cover. A (0.5 m) channel sample of the zone, however, 
produced only 6 ppb Au (GP-T3-CH1). The remaining sample, consisting of quartz float hosting 
minor pyrite and trace arsenopyrite (from the northern section of the trench), returned 58 ppb Au 
(GPR-235).  

Another 14 samples of quartz float (GPR-236 to 244), similar to that described in T1 to T3, were 
taken at the T4 site. The vein material was fairly evenly distributed along the 71 m trench – the 
more anomalous  assay Au results (wt. ave.) being 279 ppb (GPR-236), 78.05 g/t (GPR-237), 31.96 
g/t (GPR-238), 164 g/t (GPR-239), 634 ppb (GPR-241), 748 ppb (GPR-243) and 332.67 g/t (GPR-
244). Two other samples returned values of 34 ppb Au (GPR-240) and 61 ppb (GPR-242).

Trenching - Jaclyn South Zone 

Trenching in the Jaclyn South Zone (JSZ) area involved two excavation sites – T5, located approx. 
55m east of the easternmost JSZ drill-intercept (GP03-33), and T6, located 245 m farther east-
northeast (Figs. 9.6 & 9.9 ). The trenches were emplaced at 3.0 m depths with linear dimensions of 
72 and 33 m, respectively. No bedrock was encountered in either of these. Unfortunately, 
excavation of both the T5 and T6 trench sites were limited in scope due to a combination of deep 
till (>3.0m) and excess/rapid water intake, resulting in 'caving'. In the case of T5, this precluded 
sufficient extension of the trench southwards to 'adequately' cross-cut the projected trend of the 
main JZS Alpha Vein (Fig. 9.9  ).

Figure 9.9 - Trench and Sample Location Map - Trenches 5 & 6, Jaclyn South Zone.  

 

Trench 5 - Sampling Results 

Three float samples were collected from T5, including quartz, which assayed at 263 ppb Au (GPR-
250), and argillite cut by < 1.5 cm wide quartz veins, assaying 20 ppb (GPR-251) and 14 ppb Au 
(GPR-253).  

Three surface samples of float were also collected, at distances of 20 m west (GPR-249) and 65-88 
m east of the southern section of T5 (GPR-202 & 252). Significant results included a (+150-mesh 
fraction) assay of 294 g/t Au, from an angular, rusty, 0.5 x 0.6 m size quartz boulder (GPR-249), 
and a (+150 mesh fraction) assay of 8.58 g/t Au, from an angular, 0.4 x 0.4 m size, massive, quartz 
boulder (GPR-252).  

Trench 6 - Sampling Results 

No appreciable assay results were obtained for the two samples (GPR-254 & 255) collected from 
the north end of T6 – these being from a 0.3 x 0.4m boulder of greywacke cut by pyrite-bearing 
quartz veinlets, and a 15 x 20cm boulder of partly silicified argillite, cut by an 8cm quartz vein. 
Sample GPR-204, located approx. 100 m northwest of the trench – taken from an angular, 0.4 x 0.5 
m size, boulder of rusty, vuggy, quartz, containing altered wallrock fragments and minor pyrite – 
returned 150 ppb Au (wt. ave. assay).

9.2 2018 Exploration 
Mineral exploration activities, by Great Atlantic Resources Corp., were carried out on the Golden 
Promise Property during late May to August, 2018. The work consisted of reconnaissance-type 
prospecting and rock/soil sampling, sufficient to meet minimal assessment requirements for 
impending work-due-date deadlines on Mineral Licences 022313M, 024015M, 024017M, 
024018M, 0245021M, 024305M, 024311M, 025156M, 025161M, 025162M and 025916M. The 
work was conducted by geologist, Paul Delaney (P. Geo) and assistant, Art Clarke. Geologist, David 
Martin (P.Geo.) also conducted prospecting and collected a portion of the rock samples. As with 
similar work conducted in 2017, the 2018 program was deemed adequate, for the interim, until 
such a time a more focused exploration plan / strategy and budget can be implemented.  
 
As with the 2017 rock sampling program, focus in 2018 was given to sampling quartz vein material, 
either composed entirely of quartz or host rock material containing quartz veining. The B-horizon 
was sampled where possible during the 2018 soil sampling program. Although the 2018 work was 
still reconnaissance in nature, the areas of work were chosen based on favourable geology, 
favourable historic geophysics information and / or other historic work; and the 2017 exploration 
results. For example, one area of 2018 focus was the northeast region of mineral licence 25156M. 
This licence required significant assessment expenditure in 2018. Soil samples were collected 
along four traverses and rock samples were collected in the northeast region of the licence to 
explore the area further west-southwest of the Shawn's Shot gold bearing vein which occurs on 
licence 21474M. 
 
Great Atlantic has received partial analytical results for 2018 soil and rock samples as of the 
Effective Date of this report. Analytical results were received for soil and rock samples collected in 
mineral licences 24021M, 24305M, 25156M, 25161M and 25162M during May to mid-June. 
Analytical results received are for 110 soil samples and 72 rock samplesas of the Effective Date of 
this report. Outcrop in the areas prospected within these mineral licences was sparse to non-
existent.  

Of the 72 rock samples for which analytical results have been received as of the Effective Date of 
this report, all but one was reported as float. These mainly consisted of sedimentary / 
metasedimentary rocks and / or quartz vein material. Approximately half of the float samples 
returned anomalous values for gold in the 5-23 ppb range. Two float samples from one region 
returned higher gold values. Sample 309045 from a large quartz boulder in the south-central 
region of mineral licence 025161M returned 74 ppb gold while sample 309053 from a small float 
of siliceous siltstone with quartz veining / flooding in the northeast region of mineral licence 
024305M returned 192 ppb gold. Outcrop sample (309029) was collected further north in the 
central region of mineral licence 025161M. This sample of rusty, pyrite-bearing, cherty rock 
returned 197 ppb gold and 122 ppm arsenic. The sample locations and corresponding gold 
analyses are presented in Figures 9.11 to 9.14. 

Soil samples returning anomalous gold values as of the Effective Date of this report were primarily 
from two adjacent northwest-southeast traverses in the south-central to central region of mineral 
licence 025161M. Sample spacing along these traverses was approximately 50 meters. Eight of 
nine samples from the northern half of Line 1 (samples L1-11 to L1-19) returned anomalous gold 
values in the 5-77 ppb range. Some of these samples returned anomalous values for arsenic 
(including 173 and 190 ppm) and copper (including 105 and 286 ppm). Sample L1-19 also returned

40 ppm molybdenum and 12 ppm antimony. All 11 samples from adjacent Line 3 returned 
anomalous gold values in the 5-15 ppb range. Scattered soil samples in other regions returned 
anomalous gold values in the 5-10 ppb range, being single sample to 2-sample anomalies. Of note, 
sample 554700 5412450 from the northeast corner of mineral licence 025156M returned 60 ppb 
gold, representing an isolated but significant anomaly.  The sample locations and corresponding 
gold analyses are presented in Figures 9.10 to 9.15.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 

11.1 2017 Sampling Methodology and Approach 
All rock and soil samples collected on the Golden Promise Property, by geologist David Martin (P. 
Geo) and assistant/prospector, Bruce Stewart, during the 2017 exploration program, were 
numerically-labelled according to a systematic sampling scheme which denoted abbreviated 
property name (GP), sample type [rock (R) or soil (S)], year (017) and sample number (eg. soil 
sample series GP-S-017-1 to 160). Sample tags, bearing the sample number, were left in the field 
to mark the sample sites. Also, sample descriptions and GPS location measurements were 
recorded in field notes, and later used to compile a sample data spreadsheet. 
 
Given the quartz-vein-hosted nature of the 'known' gold mineralization on the property, focus was 
given to the sampling of quartz veins (bedrock), quartz float and any host rock material (bedrock 
or float) bearing multiple small quartz veins/veinlets. Most samples, however, consisted of float, 
this being more widespread and abundant, relative to the (sparse) bedrock exposures. [Note, most 
of quartz vein gold discoveries on the property, to date, have resulted from the tracing of quartz 
float debris (up-ice) to potential source areas where further investigation has been carried out by 
trenching]. 
 
The 2017 rock samples were collected with a 4 lb sledge hammer (and chisel where needed), 
ensuring that the amount of sample medium collected was reasonably large (1.5-2.0 kgs), to 
account for the typically 'spotty' nature (nugget effect) of gold-in-quartz which may be more easily 
missed in smaller samples.  
 

 Individual soil samples consisted of approx. 250 grams of B-horizon material, obtained with the 
use of a hand-held (steel) soil auger. Given the reconnaissance nature of the 2017 soil sampling 
program, sample collection consisted of, mainly, limited-area (single- or sparse line), coverage, 
over select areas, with sample stations at 25-50 m spacings.  

 
Prior to rock sample analyses (as per analytical methods described in Section 10), certain quartz 
samples were selected for metallics screen preparation whereby the entire sample is pulverized 
and separated into two size fractions by a standard mesh-size screen/sieve (150 mesh); the 
separate fractions are specified, for example, as +150 mesh (coarse) and -150 mesh (fine). 
Following this procedure, each fraction is separately weighed and analyzed by Fire Assay Au, with 
results then used to calculate a combined (weighted-average) assay result.  

Quartz samples selected for the metallics screening method were those having: a) significantly 
elevated gold values, as determined from a previous standard fire assay analysis; b) visible gold or 
sulphides; and c) stylolitic features and/or banded vein margins. The advantage of using the above 
technique is that it ensures a larger and, thus, more representative, sample medium to be tested, 
with, therefore, less risk of coarse gold grains being excluded from the final analysis. The 
technique also ensures better reproducibility for assay results.  

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 132 
 

Among the samples analyzed using the preparatory screen separation process, were those taken 
at the Christopher, Shawn's Shot, Linda-Snow White and Jaclyn North (quartz vein) prospects. In 
the latter case, most of the quartz float samples exposed by trenching along the projected trend of 
the Jaclyn North vein system, were analyzed using this method. 

11.2    2017 Sampling Program 
All samples were bagged, sealed and labelled during the course of the field work. Rock samples 
were placed in high-strength polyethylene bags for storage and shipment. Soil samples were 
placed in (industry-standard) moisture-releasing, durable, kraft paper bags. Following short-term 
sample storage, at a secure building, in Grand Falls-Windsor, NL, samples were shipped, by D. 
Martin and B. Stewart, to two separate laboratory facilities, as named below.       
 
The first of the sample shipments, consisting of 160 soils and 64 rocks – collected during 
reconnaissance investigations on Mineral Licences 24015M, 24017M, 24018M, 24021M & 25067M 
and during 'check' sampling, at known auriferous quartz veins and/or boulder sites, on Licences 
21474M and 21281M – were sent, via air cargo, to ALS Minerals (ALS Canada Ltd), in Sudbury, 
Ontario, for processing and analyses.  
 
During processing, the soils were sieved to -180 microns (80 mesh) and analyzed using Fire-Assay 
Au/AAS and 48-element- Four-Acid ICP-AES /ICP-MS. Most rocks were analyzed using 33-
Element/Four-Acid ICP-AES and Fire-Assay Au/AAS (Table 11.1  ), with some 'check' samples (of 
quartz float/vein material) selected for the 150 mesh screen metallics separation/Fire Assay Au. 
Samples analyzed under the latter method included a single chip sample (GPR-203) taken from the 
Shawn's Shot quartz vein (Lic. 21474M), two grab samples (GPR-200 & 201) from the Christopher 
vein (Lic. 21281M) and 6 samples of quartz float (GPR-202 & 204-208) collected from the Jaclyn 
North and Jaclyn South boulder train areas (Lic. 21281M).   
 

Table 11.1 - General Information on Analytical Methods 

 (After Laboratory Testing Inc. website. 2017) 
 
ICP = Inductively Coupled Plasma; AES = Atomic Emission Spectrometry; AAS = Atomic Absorption 
Spectrometry; MS = Mass Spectrometry 
 
ICP Analysis is performed to identify and measure a range of chemical elements necessary for the 
analysis of metal samples.  
 
ICP-AES or ICP Atomic Emission Spectroscopy is a technique that can determine concentrations of trace 
to major elements and can detect most elements in the periodic table. Reliable results can be obtained 
for about 70 elements with detection limits in the parts per billion range. 
 
ICP-MS or ICP Mass Spectrometry is highly sensitive and capable of multi-element trace analysis and 
ultra trace analysis, often at the parts-per-trillion level]. 
 

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 133 
 

All grab, chip and channel samples (totalling 52) collected during the trenching operation on the 
Jaclyn North and Jaclyn South Zones, as well as 23 rock samples from the southwestern claims 
(Lics. 24305M & 21970M) were, personally, transported and delivered to Eastern Analytical Ltd, 
Springdale, NL, by David Martin (P. Geo), where analyses were conducted for gold only. 

Over 70% of the trench samples from the Jaclyn North and South zones were processed and 
analyzed using the metallic screen separation/Fire Assay method, these being quartz float and 
bedrock quartz vein material. Host rock (sedimentary) material, having some quartz veining, were 
generally analyzed using regular Fire Assay Au technique. Analytical standards (controls) were 
inserted within the sample batch at every 10th sample position.  

For the 23 rocks collected from licence area of 24305M and 21970M (southwestern property 
area), all were, analyzed for Au only, however, with only the two grab samples – from the Linda-
Snow White vein, itself – involving the metallic screen separation/Fire Assay technique. One 
standard control sample (OREAS 202) was inserted with the sample batch. As well, random 
duplicate (pulp) analyses were done, by Eastern Analytical Ltd, for two of the samples. 

11.3 2018 Sampling Program 
Rock samples from the 2018 exploration program on the Golden Promise property were 
numerically labelled using sample booklets. For each rock sample, the sample number was written 
on the sample bags and one tag from the sample booklet with the sample number was placed in 
the bag before sealing. For each soil sample from the 2018 Golden Promise program, the sample 
number was written on the sample bag. The majority of soil samples were assigned sample 
numbers corresponding to the sample coordinates (NAD 27 east and north coordinates marked on 
the sample bag representing the sample number). For certain soil sampling traverses, the soil 
samples were labelled by line number and station such as L1-10 and L1-11. Sample descriptions 
and GPS locations (using hand-held GPS devices) were recorded in field notes, and later used to 
compile sample data spreadsheets. A piece of flagging tape with the written sample number was 
left at each sample site. 
 
All samples were bagged, labelled and sealed during the course of the field work. Rock samples 
were placed in high-strength polyethylene bags for storage and shipment. Soil samples were 
placed in (industry-standard) moisture-releasing, durable, kraft paper bags. Following short-term 
sample storage, at a secure building, in Grand Falls-Windsor, NL, samples were transported by P. 
Delaney (P.Geo.) to Eastern Analytical laboratory facilities.       
 
During processing, the soil samples were sieved to -80 mesh. The rock samples were crushed to 
80% -10 mesh, followed by creation of split samples, and pulverizing of the split samples to 95% -
150 mesh. The rock and soil samples were analyzed for gold using Fire-Assay / Atomic Absorption 
(AA) and for 34-elements using Four-Acid Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission 
Spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

11.4 Historical Sampling Program 
 

The following account of the historical drilling and sampling practices performed during 2002 to 
2010 on the northeastern Golden Promise Property area (encompassing the Jaclyn Zone, Jaclyn 
West, Justin's Hope and Shawn's Shot prospects, were (collectively) summarized in assessment 
report by Sparkes (2010) and Mullen (2002-2008) and a 2008 NI 43-101 report, by Pilgrim and 
Giroux (2008), as follows: 

All diamond drilling on the property was conducted by Petro Drilling Company Ltd, of Springdale, 
NL. Upon completion of drill holes, casings were left in the ground and marked with 4" x 4" 
wooden posts, with aluminium dymo tape (affixed) on which drill-hole data – depth, inclination, 
azimuth, etc – were recorded. The drill collar locations were initially assigned field grid coordinates 
with all holes later surveyed with a Trimble GPS unit (with ± 0.5 m accuracy).  During drilling, hole 
deviation was monitored with a Reflex survey instrument at 60 m intervals down-hole.  

The drill core was logged in a secure, well lighted, core logging facility, in Badger (located near the 
property), where the selected sample intervals were sawn in half using a diamond-blade rock saw. 
A one-half section of core was then bagged for shipment for assay analysis, while the remaining 
half was returned to the core box. The diamond saw blade was routinely cleaned, after each 
sample cutting, to prevent cross contamination of mineralization. The finished core was stored in 
metal racks at the logging facility, with all core boxes labelled with aluminium dymo tape. Before 
shipment to the lab, samples were securely sealed in polyethylene plastic bags, then sealed in 
larger, woven, rice bags. 

For sampling conducted during 2002 to 2007, samples were delivered, directly, by company 
personnel, or by freight truck, to Eastern Analytical Ltd, in Springdale. After completion of gold 
analyses, all remaining pulps were shipped, via air cargo out of Gander, to ALS Chemex Labs in 
Vancouver, BC, for 27-Element multi-acid digestion ICP analysis plus additional check assays for 
gold on a selected subset. Coarse rejects were stored at Eastern Analytical (Pilgrim et al., 2008).  

(Sample preparation and assay procedures, employed by Eastern Analytical, are outlined in Table 
11.2). 

During the 2010 drilling, core samples were delivered, by Crosshair personnel, directly to 
Accurassay Labratories' prep lab, in Gambo, NL. Following preparation, the samples were shipped 
to Accurassay's analytical laboratory, in Thunder Bay, ON, for Fire Assay Au and ICP analysis. 
Samples containing visible gold (or suspected to), or assaying >1 g/t Au, under regular Fire Assay, 
were automatically submitted for metallic screen method. Thirty element ICP analyses were 
conducted using Accurassay's ICP-MA (muiti-acid) technique" (Sparkes, 2010). 

For rock, grab, float and core samples taken during the prospecting and drilling programs 
conducted between 2002 and 2004, analytical standards were inserted, by Eastern Analytical Ltd, 
into the sample batch at every 20th, consecutive sample position. During the 2006/2007 and 2010 
drill campaigns, a blank was inserted into the sample stream, by the core technician, once every 
20 samples, while two to three standard control samples (with known gold contents) were 
inserted into almost every sample batch at the laboratory (Mullen, 2008; Pilgrim & Giroux, 2008; & 
Sparkes, 2010). Gold analyses were performed using a combination of screen metallics sieving and 
30 gram (1 A.T.) Fire Assay technique. 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 135 
 

"Gold check assays on Eastern Analytical's screened pulps, by ALS Chemex (for the 2002-2007 
sampling), compared favourably with the -150 mesh metallic assays by Eastern, considering the 
nugget-style nature of the gold mineralization. In the range of 0.1-1.0 g/t Au, Eastern was, on 
average, higher by 26% about 82% of the time and lower by 38% for the remainder. Between 1.0 
to 3.0 g/t Au, Eastern's assays were on average 25% higher than ALS Chemex's 28% of the time, 
and lower by an average 30% for the remaining 72%. However, in the more critical >3.0 g/t Au 
subset, Eastern's assays averaged 10% higher 62% of the time, and lower by an average 18% for 
the remaining 38% of the time" (Mullen, 2006 & 2007).  

The standards were supplied to Eastern Analytical by CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Delta, BC. 
Their documented gold values were 0.82 ± 0.09 g/T (CDN-GS-10, Eastern No. STD-J), 0.99 ± 0.08 
g/T (CDN-GS-1C, Eastern No. STD-L), and 3.47 ± 0.26 g/T (CDN-GS-3B, Eastern No. STD-M) No 
major analytical issues were encountered as the standards assayed within the acceptable two 
standard deviation limits quoted by CDN Resource Labs, and all blanks assayed <5 ppb Au  (Mullen, 
2008). 

Table 11.2 - Sample Preparation and Assay Procedures at Eastern Analytical Ltd 

 

Eastern Analytical Ltd 

SAMPLE PREPARATION OF ROCK 
 

Samples are organized and labeled when they enter the lab and then placed in drying ovens until 
they are completely dry. After drying is complete samples are taken and crushed in a Rhino Jaw 
Crusher to approximately 75% -10 mesh material. 
 

The complete sample is rifle-split until approximately 250 – 300 grams of material is separated. 
The remainder of the sample is bagged and stored as coarse reject. The 250 – 300 gram split is 
then pulverized using a ring mill to approximately 98% -150 mesh material. 
 

The ring pulverizers and jaw crushers are cleaned with silica sand when changing clients. Rings 
and bowls are inspected by a sample prep technician after each sample and silica sand is used to 
clean equipment as needed. 
 
SAMPLE PREPARATION OF SOILS 
 

Soils are dried at 90⁰F.  They are then pounded with a rubber mallet in the soil bag and then 
screened through an 80 mesh screen.  The -80 fraction is rolled and kept as the sample.  The +80 
mesh fraction is discarded. 
 
FIRE ASSAY PROCEDURE 
 

A 30 gram sample is weighed and placed into an earthen crucible containing PBO fluxes and then 
mixed.  Silver nitrate is added and the samples are fused in a fire assay oven to obtain a liquid 
which is poured into a mold and left to cool.  A lead button is then separated from the slag and 
cupelled in to a fire assay oven which obtains a silver bead containing the Gold. 
 

The silver is removed with 1 ml nitric acid and then 3 ml hydrochloric acid is added to bring the 
Ag and Au into solution. After cooling, deoinized water is added to bring the sample up to a 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 136 
 

present volume. Then sample is then analyzed by Atomic Absorption. 
 

Atomic Absorption (AA): 

Samples are analyzed one at a time by AA (in batches of 24) with a value obtained by taking the 
average of three readings per sample. Unit is checked with a calibration solution after every 12 
samples. Sample results are recorded manually and transferred to the manual data entry person 
where assay data is remerged with RMX sample number and tabulated into reports for 
certificates. Reports and standards are checked by the Chief Assayer before the certificates are 
release to the client. 

Au Metallics: 

All quartz vein samples are analyzed using a metallic sieving process. The entire sample is 
crushed, and then approximately one kilogram is split off into four portions. This split is 
pulverized and then sieved through a +150 mesh screen. All of the +150 fraction is placed in an 
envelope and then fired, the sample weight is then recorded (usually a low weight <10 g). The 
entire -150 fraction is placed in a plastic bag and the weight is recorded. The final Au value is 
calculated by one half A.T. from the -150 fraction and the fire assay. 
 
PROCEDURE FOR AR-ICP30 
Each sample rack contains one blank, two CanMet standards and 37 unknowns, of which two will be 
duplicates. 
 
A 0.500 gram sample is digested with 2ml HNO3 in a 95oC water bath for ½ hour, after which 1 ml HCL is 
added. The sample is returned to the water bath for an additional ½ hour.  After cooling, the sample is 
diluted to 10 ml with deionized  water, stirred, and let stand for 1 hour to allow precipitate to settle. The 
sample is then ready for ICP analysis. 
 
GEOCHEM PROCEDURE FOR CU/PB/ZN/AG 
A 0.500g sample is digested in a test tube with 2ml of nitric acid and 1ml of hydrochloric acid for 1 hour.  
Samples are then diluted to 10ml with deionized water and analyzed on the AA. 
 

 

2010 Bulk Sampling Program, Jaclyn Main Zone 

Sample analytical procedures and quality control measures reported for the Crosshair (bulk 
sample preparation) trench sampling program, are presented in an excerpt from Steele (2011) as 
follows: 

"Each sample was placed in a plastic sample bag with a labelled sample tag and sealed. All samples 
were then placed into large rice bags, securely sealed and delivered by Crosshair personnel 
directly to the Accurassay Laboratories Ltd sample preparation facility, in Gambo, NL. Prepared 
pulps were then sent to the main laboratory facility in Thunder Bay, ON, for gold analyses and 30-
element ICP-OES analyses by multi acid digestion. Of the 53 channel samples submitted, 18 
channel samples contained visible gold and were analyzed by the pulp metallics method with AA 
finish, which uses a 1,000g sub-sample size and sieved using a 150 mesh screen. The entire +150 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 137 
 

metallics portion is assayed along with two duplicate sub-samples of the -150 pulp portion. Results 
are reported as a weighted average of gold in the entire sample. The remaining 35 channel 
samples and all drill cuttings samples were analyzed via standard 50g fire assay with AA finish. All 
fire assayed samples that gave results greater than 1g/t were re-assayed by the pulp metallics 
method. Two different standards with known gold content and blanks (<5ppb Au) were also 
submitted with the channel and drill cutting samples to monitor quality control" (Steele, 2011).  

11.5 Quality Assurance / Quality Control Programs for Drill Core 

During the period 2004 through 2008, the property was explored by Rubicon and subsequently by 
Paragon.  Both companies sent drillcore to Eastern Analytical Laboratory in Springdale 
Newfoundland for determination of gold by screened metallic assaying.  Rubicon provided Eastern 
Analytical with three standards that were obtained from CDN Labs in Delta, BC and Eastern 
Analytical inserted those standards into the sample stream at intervals established by Rubicon and 
Paragon, generally one standard per 20 samples for an insertion rate of 5%.  During the 2005/2006 
drill program Rubicon also submitted blanks with drillcore samples.  The total number of 
submitted blanks is not known; records have been found for 40.  There is no record of Eastern 
Analytical performing duplicate analyses to measure analytical precision. 

Upon completion of their assaying, Eastern Analytical forwarded the pulps to ALS (then ALS 
Chemex) in North Vancouver BC for 20-element ICP analyses.  During the period 2004-2005, 
Rubicon sent drillcore to ALS as well as to Eastern Analytical.   As with Eastern Analytical, Rubicon 
instructed ALS to insert standards and blanks into the sample stream at proscribed intervals of one 
in 20, although it appears that unlike Eastern Analytical, ALS supplied their own standards.  As 
well, ALS performed duplicate analyses although the frequency is not known. 

Because the sample pulps that were forwarded to ALS by Eastern Analytical had already been 
assayed for gold, ALS performed very few gold assays and therefore there are relatively few 
QA/QC measures for gold with respect to the pulps. 

During their 2010 – 2011 drill program, Crosshair sent drillcore samples to Accurassay Labs in 
Thunder Bay Ontario for gold assaying.  The assay certificates indicate that Accurassay performed 
duplicate analyses, generally at a rate of one duplicate per 10 assays, but towards the end of the 
program the ratio dropped to one in 20.  There are no records of assaying of standards or blanks 
by Accurassay. 

In 2011, Crosshair sent one batch of pulps (70) to ALS for determination of gold; those samples 
were subjected to the normal ALS QA/QC protocol of standards, blanks and duplicates. 

All QA/QC analyses for which documentation is available are tabulated in the following Table 11.3.  
QA/QC data is also available for the ALS treatment of non-gold pulps but because the only element 
of interest at Jaclyn Main Zone is gold, those data are less relevant to the current discussion, 
although they do demonstrate that ALS consistently achieved their targets for accuracy, precision 
and absence of cross-contamination. 

If Eastern Analytical maintained an insertion rate of 5%, the documentation of their assaying of 
standards is incomplete but it is not known whether that rate was actually maintained.

Figure 11.2 - Eastern Analytical Standard M Control Plot 

 

Standard L assays fall mostly within a +/- 10% band although more values lie above the expected 
mean than below.  This suggests that for samples with contained gold values of about one ppm, 
the Eastern Analytical assays may slightly overstate the actual value.  Standard M assays also fall 
mostly within the +/- 10% band but most fall below the expected mean which suggests that for 
samples with contained gold values of 3 ppm or greater, the Eastern Analytical assays may 
understate the actual value. 

No plots of ALS standard analyses are included here because ALS used numerous (21) standards 
and the population for each is too small to comprise a meaningful plot.  However, all ALS standard 
assays fall within target limits. 

All Eastern Analytical and ALS assays of blanks were at or below detection limit which indicates 
that there was no evidence of cross-contamination.   

All duplicate pair assays show close agreement as demonstrated by the following three plots.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 
Data used for the mineral resource estimate described in Section 14 was verified in three ways: 

1) The Property has been the subject of three site inspections by two of the authors of this 
report: Mr Pilgrim inspected the Property on two occasions, in 2005 and in 2008, during 
and immediately after the completion of drill programs and had the opportunity to observe 
and determine the location of the majority of holes that were drilled within the Jaclyn 
Main Zone.  Mr Mosher inspected the site in August 2018.  The Mosher  site inspection was 
carried out to confirm the presence and location of drillholes in preparation for the 
resource estimation described in Section 14, as well as to review bedrock geology.  As it is 
mandatory that all excavations be reclaimed, few of the drillcollars remain and none of the 
trenches nor the bulk sample site remain and in fact it is difficult to determine their 
locations; 

2) Drill core was examined, and samples were collected from drill core and submitted to ALS 
in North Vancouver to verify original assay values.  Quarter-core samples were collected 
from half core by diamond saw.  Visible gold was observed in several of the intervals 
examined but these intervals were not sampled as they had already been reduced to 
quarter core; 

3) The assay database was compared with as many original assay laboratory certificates as 
were available.  Certificates were available for approximately 60% of the 4,861 assays in 
the database.  It should be noted that two sets of assays exist for samples collected during 
the period 2006 – 2007.  Samples were initially assayed by ALS Chemex in North Vancouver 
by fire assay with an atomic absorption finish; for samples containing more than 10 g/t 
gold, the samples were re-assayed with a gravimetric finish.  Subsequently in 2007, it was 
decided that because of the common presence of elemental gold, metallic screening would 
be appropriate.  Therefore, all the samples were re-assayed by Eastern Analytical in 
Newfoundland.  Many of these results are higher than the ALS results due to the presence 
of coarse gold and it is the Eastern Analytical results that have been used in the database.  
No discrepancies were found between the Eastern Analytical assay certificates and 
corresponding assay values in the database. 

Table 12.1 is a comparison of original and check assay values for six (6) core samples that were 
collected during the site visit.

As can be seen from Table 12.1, the check assays range from being very similar to both 
significantly higher and lower than the original assays.  These differences are ascribed to three 
probable causes: 1) the original samples were collected from sawn half-core; the check samples 
were collected by sawing the remaining half-core to obtain a quarter-core sample so that the 
original and check samples are testing different sample material;  2) although the samples are 
proximate, the particulate nature of the gold makes it highly improbable that both samples would 
contain identical quantities of gold.  The variability of gold content is both positive and negative 
which is taken to reflect the erratic nature of gold distribution and; 3) the check samples were not 
analyzed using metallic screening because they were all too small – between 0.32 and 0.56 
kilograms – and ALS requires a minimum sample size of one kilogram for the screening process.  
Therefore, the check samples may have contained particulate gold that was not accounted for in 
the assaying process and this omission may account for the two check samples that are of very low 
grade.  The check assays do, however, demonstrate both the presence of gold in the samples and 
also serve to emphasize the need for metallic screening of all samples that may be collected from 
the Property in future for any further assessment of the gold mineralization present.  

The author (Mosher) is of the opinion that the data are adequate for the purpose of the mineral 
resource estimate described in Section 14 of this technical report.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
13.1 2010 Bulk Sample Program  Jaclyn Main Zone     
A description of the 2010 bulk sampling program, performed on the Jaclyn Main (gold-bearing) 
quartz vein system, is herein, presented as mainly excerpts and abbreviated statements from 
Steele (2011). [Comments by the author are enclosed in parentheses and brackets].  
 
"In June 2010, Crosshair Exploration & Mining Corp. entered into a contract with Stantec 
Consulting Ltd (an internationally-based company), in which Stantec would provide planning, 
design and project management services to the bulk sampling program". A geotechnical drilling 
program was completed by Stantec in Sept, 2010, which showed overburden depths ranging from 
1.5 to 3.5 metres, though more typically between 2.0 and 2.5m (Steele, 2011).  

Using existing drill hole data on the Jaclyn Main Zone, a determination on the surface projection of 
the vein was made, by Hawco King Renouf Ltd, of St. John's, NL, to guide excavation work 
(overburden removal). Organics and overburden (till) material were stockpiled at separate 
locations adjacent to the trench site. Mechanized trenching, prep-drilling and blasting were 
conducted by Barker Construction Ltd, of Baie Verte, NL, during November 1-26, 2010, with 
operational and logistical aspects of the program supervised by Stantec. Geological mapping, 
sampling and ore zone designations – for blasting and extraction purposes – were performed by 
independent geological consultant, Tanya Tettelaar (M.Sc., P.Geo.), assisted by Crosshair staff 
personnel, Owen Chaulk and Steve Janes (Steele, 2011).  

"The completed trench was approx. 170 metres in length and ranged from 5 metres to 10 metres 
in width" (Steele, 2011). [An outline of the bulk sample trench-site, with channel sample locations, 
is shown in Fig. 50. The location and extent of the trench site, in relation to the Jaclyn Main 
longitudinal ore zone section, is shown in Fig. 6.11.  

Blast holes, 10 and 15 ft deep, were prepared using an Airtrack drill. Based on calculations, by 
Crosshair staff, the estimated quantity of rock removal was approx. 2,600 tonnes. "Due to poor 
ground conditions (strongly fractured subcrop), only 50% of the vein and host rock was exposed". 
Also, groundwater and silt drainage into the pre-blast holes resulted in some of these being 
partially or completely lost, an issue which negatively affected the depth and intensity of blasting 
for portions of the trench. 

A total of 53 channel samples and 23 drill chip samples (from blast prep holes) were taken from 
the trench site. Channel sampling resulted in 47 samples from bedrock and 6 from (loose) 
subcrop/quartz vein material. Eighteen of the channel samples were noted to contain visible gold, 
with bedrock and subcrop channels assaying up to 161.65 g/t Au/0.7 m and 35.37 g/t Au/0.45 m, 
respectively. Corresponding average assay grades for these channels were 9.87 g/t Au/0.5 m and 
9.60 g/t Au/0.5 m. Drill chip samples returned assay values up to 56.18 g/t Au, with an average of 

 9.38 g/t Au (Steele, 2011). All sample locations are shown in Fig. 13.1. All related data, with 
respect to sample UTM and field grid coordinates, sample descriptions and assay results, are 
presented in Tables 13.1 and 13.2.

The blasted ore zone material was mechanically busted into acceptable sizes for milling (< 0.4 m) 
and loaded onto 30-tonne capacity semi-trucks for transport to the Nugget Pond mill facility, 
currently operated by Rambler Metals and Mining Plc., on the Baie Verte Peninsula. This entailed a 
(one-way) road distance travel of approx. 200 km. Seventy-one truck-loads of material were 
transported for an estimated total of 2,241 wet tonnes. Following the ore concentrate processing, 
"two gold bars were poured and shipped to Johnson Matthey Ltd, in Toronto, for refining. Bar 1 
weighed 4.773 kg and contained 118.84 oz. of gold and 20.54 oz of silver. Bar 2 weighed 0.638 kg 
and contained 15.265 oz, of gold and 2.51 oz. of silver" (Steele, 2011). In addition, 482.5 kilograms 
of concentrate were recovered from the Ball mill and SAG mill (during clean out) and also shipped 
to Johnson Matthey for treatment and refining. Eight samples collected from the Ball mill 
produced an average assay grade of 6.5 g/t Au, while eleven samples from the SAG mill material 
produced an average grade of 5.13 g/t Au. "After refining, the bars and the mill concentrate 
produced a total of 313.59 ounces of gold and 23.05 ounces of silver. Based on the mill records 
and the total gold recovered, the average recovered gold grade was 4.47 g/t. The average tails 
grade was 1.12 g/t gold, indicating a back-calculated head grade of 5.59 g/t gold with an 80% 
recovery" (Steele, 2011). 

"Crosshair compared the head grade with the estimated sample grade using the block model 
prepared, in April 2008, by Gary Giroux (P. Eng), which stated an inferred resource of 921,000 t at 
3.02 g/t Au". [This grade was based on drill hole results from 2002 to 2007 and, thus, did not 
included the 2010 in-fill drilling implemented in preparation for the bulk sampling program]. 
"Assuming a 2 m deep trench and 25% dilution, Giroux determined that the bulk sample would 
have a tonnage of 2,125 t at an average grade of 4.42 g/t" (Steele, 2011). 

The 80% recovery – while, in fact, a positive result – "is lower than that predicted by the bench 
scale test work. It is believed that the lower-than-expected recovery is due to the presence of 
carbonaceous material in the waste rock. In the future, this issue can be mitigated by modifying 
the circuit to a carbon-in-leach process as opposed to a carbon-in-pulp process. This would result 
in a minor modification to the flow sheet which will be further refined in future metallurgical test 
programs" (Steele, 2011) (See Section 11  for sample analytical procedures and quality control 
measures, pertaining to the program).

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
14.1 Introduction 

Great Atlantic provided data files in Excel format containing collar, downhole survey, assay and 
lithology data for 136 drillholes with a total of 4,861 assays for gold and 38 other elements.   This 
dataset contains information for 36 holes that were drilled in 2010 and were therefore not 
included in the previous resource estimate that was carried out in 2008.   Of the 38 other 
elements, only arsenic was considered to be present in potentially significant quantities, so the 
mineral resource estimate was carried out for gold and arsenic.  In addition to the drill database, 
Great Atlantic provided copies of laboratory assay certificates and assay laboratory quality control 
certificates in pdf format. No data from trenches or other sample media were received. 

14.2 Exploratory Data Analysis 
The Jaclyn Main Zone was tested by 107 holes; the remaining 29 holes tested other vein 
occurrences.  The 107 holes that tested the Jaclyn Main Zone contained 3,336 assays.  Descriptive 
statistics for these assays are given in Table 14.1.

 As the holes were sampled continuously, most of these assays do not contain gold: only 520 of 
the 3,336 assay values are greater than detection limit (0.05 g/t for ALS and 5 ppb for Eastern 
Analytical).  Within the Jaclyn Main Zone, gold mineralization of potential economic interest is 
associated with quartz veins and only 262 assays are described in the dataset as being associated 
with quartz veins.  Descriptive statistics for those assays are given in Table 14.2.

14.3 Capping 
Capping is the process of artificially reducing high values within a sample population that are 
regarded as statistically anomalous with respect to the population as a whole (outliers), to avoid 
the distorting influence these values would have on the statistical characteristics of the population 
if left at their full value.  The risk in including atypically high values in a resource estimate is that 
their contribution to the estimated grade will be disproportionate to their contribution to the 
tonnage, and therefore the grade of the resource as a whole will be overstated. 

Cumulative frequency curves are commonly used to determine whether capping is appropriate.  If 
a single sample population is present, the cumulative frequency curve is a straight line; prominent 
steps in the curve indicate the potential presence of separate or mixed populations.  Figure 14.1 
shows the cumulative frequency curve for gold for the Jaclyn Main Zone.  The plot exhibits a 
prominent break at 65 g/t so all assays that exceed that value were capped at 65 g/t. 

Figure 14.1 - Jaclyn Main Zone Gold Assay Cumulative Frequency Curve 

 

Five of the 3,336 assays were capped at 65 g/t.  These five assays represent 0.15% of the sample 
population but by being capped, their capped values reduce the aggregate sum of the sample 
population by approximately 16% which suggests that those five samples exert an influence on 
grade that is disproportionate to their number.   See Table 14.3.

14.4 Composites 
Compositing of samples is done to overcome the influence of sample length on the contribution of 
sample grade (sample support).  A composite length is chosen that is equal to or greater than the 
majority of sample lengths.  As approximately 99% of the samples are shorter than or equal to one 
meter, one meter was chosen as the composite length. 

14.5 Bulk Density 
During 2006 and 2007, 102 specific gravity (SG) measurements were made on samples of core 
from six drillholes.  Forty-two of those samples were of quartz vein material and had an average 
SG of 2.66 g/cm3.  That value was rounded to 2.7 for the mineral resource estimate described in 
this section of the report. 

14.6 Geological Interpretation 
The Jaclyn Main Zone has previously been modelled (Pilgrim and Giroux, 2008) as two slightly-
overlapping en-echelon veins that strike approximately east-west and dip steeply to the south.  
Although there are several quartz vein intercepts that may represent the overlap of two en-
echelon veins, the evidence for the presence of two separate veins is not unequivocal; there are 
multiple vein intercepts in many of the drillholes which may suggest the presence of an 
indeterminate number of parallel veins rather than just two.  Evidence from surface trenching 
suggests the presence of a persistent main vein so the other vein intercepts may represent less 
well-developed subordinate veins.   

Given the ambiguity that multiple vein intercepts represent, the simplifying step was taken to 
model the Jaclyn Main Zone as a single vein that strikes approximately east-west and dips 
approximately 75° to the south.  The vein as modelled represents the aggregation of quartz vein 
intercepts that are located approximately mid-way between the hangingwall and footwall 
boundaries of all quartz vein intercepts within the Jaclyn Main Zone.  The modelled vein contains 
99 of the 262 quartz vein intercepts in drillholes in the Jaclyn Main Zone. 

14.7 Spatial Analysis 
An attempt was made to create variograms for the Jaclyn Main Zone quartz vein intercepts but 
there were insufficient data points to establish more than several points on the variogram and 
therefore a range could not be established. 

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 152 
 

Consequently, instead of doing the interpolation by kriging, which is dependent upon variograms, 
inverse distance squared (ID2) was used and a search ellipse was established on the basis of the 
orientation of the Jaclyn Main Zone vein, and on the spatial density of drillholes.   The search 
ellipse is longest (100 meters) in the strike direction of the vein (east-west), is narrowest (2 
meters) across strike (north-south), and is 50 meters in the Z direction.  The dimensions were 
chosen to capture at least two drillholes in the strike direction and to limit the lateral smearing of 
grades in the across-strike direction.  The search ellipse is parallel to the vein and plunges 15 
degrees to the east.  The plunge of the search ellipse is based on the apparent plunge of high-
grade gold values.  Figure 14.2 shows the distribution of contoured gold grades in a long vertical 
section view of the Jaclyn Main Zone vein.  The eastward plunge of the higher grades is obvious 
and may relate to regional fold plunges.   Figure 14.2 also shows the approximate lower limit of 
the conceptual pit that was used to constrain the mineral resource estimate described in this 
section of the report.

14.9 Interpolation Plan 
Grades were interpolated into the block model using Inverse Distance Squared (ID2) weighting.  
Grades were interpolated in a single pass.  In order for a grade to be interpolated into a block it 
was necessary that a minimum of two and a maximum of 10 composites were located within the 
volume of the search ellipse.  A maximum of one composite per hole was allowed thereby 
ensuring that, at a minimum, each block was informed by at least two drillholes to demonstrate 
the continuity of mineralization.  The volume percentage within the geological wireframe was 
estimated for each block and the tabulated resource is stated only for those portions of the block 
model within the geological wireframe. 

 

 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 154 
 

14.10      Mineral Resource Classification 
All resources have been classified as Inferred because of the  relatively wide spacing of drillholes 
through significant portions of the zone  Closer-spaced drilling will serve to increase confidence in 
the geological interpretation of the zone as well as to confirm historical drill results. 

 

14.11      Reasonable Prospects of Eventual Economic Extraction 
The Jaclyn Main Zone is, in part, exposed at surface and it is appropriate to assume that if mined, 
at least part of the deposit would be extracted by open pit methods.  For that reason, the mineral 
resource has been constrained by a conceptual pit.   Table 14.6 lists the parameters used for the 
conceptual pit.  No allowance was made for mining dilution or mining loss.  The costs used are 
generic and were chosen based on publicly-available costs for small open pit mines and for 
flotation processing of gold.  The cutoff grade for the resources within the open pit was taken as 
0.6 g/t based on the combined mining and processing cost per tonne of US$27.50 divided by the 
price of one gram of gold (US$41.79) and rounded to the nearest 0.2-gram value.  The 
underground cutoff value was taken as 1.5 g/t based on its frequent use in publicly-available 
documentation as an appropriate cutoff grade for small underground mining operations.

14.12      Mineral Resource Tabulation 
The Jaclyn Main Zone Mineral Resource is tabulated in two parts: Table 14.7 is a tabulation of pit-
constrained resources based on the parameters outlined in Section 14.11.  The basecase resource 
is stated at a cutoff grade of 0.6 g/t gold and is highlighted.  At a cutoff grade of 0.6 g/t, the pit-
constrained mineral resource is estimated to be approximately 157,300 tonnes with an average 
capped grade of 11.4 g/t gold, equivalent to approximately 57,800 contained ounces of gold.  Gold 
grades have been rounded to the nearest 0.1 gram; arsenic grades have been rounded to the 
nearest gram; tonnes and ounces have been rounded to the nearest 100.

· Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.   
· There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resources estimated will be converted into Mineral Reserves. 
· Mineral resource tonnage and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate, and 

numbers may not add due to rounding.

Table 14.8 is the tabulation of the underground resource and is stated at a basecase cutoff grade 
of 1.5 g/t gold, which is highlighted.  The underground portion if the mineral resource is estimated 
to comprise 200,200 tonnes with an average capped gold grade of 7.5 g/t for an approximate total 
of 48,600 contained ounces of gold. Gold grades have been rounded to the nearest 0.1 gram; 
arsenic grades have been rounded to the nearest gram; tonnes and ounces have been rounded to 
the nearest 100.

In Tables 14.7 and 14.8, the quantity of mineral resource and the corresponding average gold 
grade is also stated for a range of cutoff grades other than the basecase.  It is notable that the 
total resource is relatively insensitive to cutoff grade because of the high grade of the Jaclyn Main 
Zone vein.  It is also notable that the near-surface (pit-constrained) portion of the vein has a 
significantly higher average grade than the deeper (underground) portion.  This outcome is 
consistent with the contoured gold grades shown in Figure 14.2. 

Table 14.9 combines the pit-constrained and underground resources.  The cutoff grade of 1.1 g/t 
for the total resource is the weighted average of the pit-constrained and underground cutoff 
grades.

14.13      Block Model Validation 
The Jaclyn Main Zone Mineral Resource Estimate was validated several ways: 1) visually by 
comparing block model grades with proximal composite grades within the block model, 2) by 
comparing average grades of raw assays, composites, and the block model, and 3) by swath plots.  
In all cases the comparisons are considered to be reasonable. 

Table 14.10 shows the comparison of descriptive statistics among non-zero values for raw assays, 
composites and the block model.  The composite average grade is slightly lower than the raw 
assay average grade as is to be expected because of the combining of higher with lower grades.  
Similarly, the block model average grade is slightly lower for capped gold as can be expected as a 
result of distance-weighting of composite values during the interpolation process.  It is noted, 
however that the average uncapped grade is slightly higher than the corresponding composite 
grade which suggests that a minor amount of "smearing" of higher grades may have taken place 
during the interpolation process.  Regardless, the agreement among data types indicates that the 
estimation process has not meaningfully distorted the original assay values.

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 159 
 

14.14      Comparison With Previous Estimates 
The only previous mineral resource estimate for the Jaclyn Main Zone was carried out in 2008 by 
Gary Giroux as part of a technical report prepared by Larry Pilgrim and Gary Giroux for Crosshair 
Exploration and Mining Corporation, dated April 30, 2008. 

The 2008 Mineral Resource Estimate interpreted the Jazlyn Main Zone as being comprised of two 
separate overlapping veins.  These veins were modelled to a minimum thickness of 1.5 meters and 
gold grades within the veins were capped at 32 and 35.3 g/t.  The resource estimate was carried 
out using 1.5-meter composites.  At a cutoff of 1.0 g/t gold, the total resource for both veins was 
estimated to be 921,000 tonnes with an average capped grade of 3.02 g/t for an approximate total 
of 89,500 contained ounces. 

By comparison, at a cutoff of 1.0 g/t the current estimate contains 370,000 tonnes with an average 
grade of 9 g/t gold for an approximate total of 107,000 contained ounces of gold.  The current 
estimate was carried out using intersected vein thicknesses, corrected for dip, rather than a 
minimum 1.5-meter thickness, 1.0-meter composites rather than 1.5-meter composites, and assay 
values capped at 65 g/t rather than 32 or 35.3 g/t. 

The difference in tonnage is attributed to the use in the current estimate of intersected vein 
thicknesses rather than modelled minimum thicknesses of 1.5 meters as was done in the 2008 
estimate.  Many of the vein intercepts are shorter than one meter: the average intersected 
thickness for non-zero assays within the currently modelled Jaclyn Main Zone vein is 0.47 meters.  
The higher grade in the current estimate is in part attributable to the use of undiluted, narrower 
vein widths as well as to the higher capping level.  The current mineral resource estimate contains 
data from 22 holes that were drilled in the Jaclyn Main Zone in 2010 that therefore were not part 
of the 2008 estimate.  Those holes were all drilled within the limits of pre-2010 drilling and 
therefore did not expand the dimensions of the zone.  Further, the average grade of the 2010 
assays is slightly lower than the average of the pre-2010 assays although the impact of this lower 
grade on the outcome of the current estimate is considered to be negligible.

23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
The Moosehead Gold Project of Sokoman Iron Corp. is located approximately 41 kilometers east-
northeast of the Golden Promise Property. The Moosehead Gold Project is also located within the 
Exploits Subzone. Gold mineralization is reported in quartz veins at the Moosehead Gold Project 
(source: Sokoman Iron Corp. website). Diamond drill hole intersections reported by Sokoman on 
the Moosehead Gold Project during 2018 include 44.96 g/t gold / 11.90 meter core length in drill 
hole MH-18-01 and 33.56 g/t gold / 24.90-meter core length in drill hole MH-18-17 (Sokoman New 
Releases of July 24 and November 16, 2018). Regarding the Moosehead Gold Project, the qualified 
persons have been unable to verify the information and the information is not necessarily 
indicative of the mineralization on the property that is the subject of this technical report.  
 
There are no other adjacent properties the description of which would enhance the understanding 
of the Properties that are the subject of this Technical Report.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
25.1 General 
Although significant drilling has been conducted on the Golden Promise Property, to date – 
particularly in relation to the Jaclyn Zone – the property remains largely unexplored. A general lack 
of bedrock exposure over large areas (due to extensive glacial till cover) precludes any direct 
evaluation of the property's geology and gold potential for the most part.  

Given the general scarcity of outcrop, much of the historical exploration work on the property has 
been restricted to soil geochemistry and sampling of (glacially-transported) quartz float. 
Nevertheless, gold-bearing quartz veins have been found to be widely-distributed over the area, 
with present discoveries – including the Jaclyn Zone, Christopher, Shawn' Shot and Linda-Snow 
White prospects – collectively encompassing a roughly 22 km NE/SW trend. This distribution of 
quartz veins is consistent with the widespread occurrence of gold-bearing quartz float contained 
within, or lying atop, the glacial till. All such quartz vein prospects exhibit the same characteristics 
– namely massive vein cores, with laminated and stylolitic margins hosting minor pyrite, 
arsenopyrite and (often visible) gold. 

Most gold occurrences discovered on the property, to date, have been the result of attempts to 
trace the origin of quartz float, up-ice, to (suspected) source areas, where trenching and drill 
testing – particularly, in the case of the Jaclyn Zone prospects – have proven quite successful in 
encountering significant quartz vein hosted  gold mineralization, despite deep till cover. Such 
discoveries, however, may be fortuitous given that, where significant till depths are encountered, 
it is unlikely that such float were derived from the immediate subsurface bedrock, but rather 
farther 'up-ice'. Interestingly, this incidence of quartz vein gold discovery may simply be due to the 
widespread, prolific, occurrence of the auriferous quartz veins, itself. Also, anomalous 
geochemical results obtained over till-covered areas may also relate to  development of soils over 
the originally  transported, gold-bearing, parent material. This aspect of the property's glacial 
history, combined with its favorable geology and incidence of gold discoveries to date, bodes well 
for the property's greater unseen gold potential. 

Geological mapping by McNeill (2005), performed in conjunction with interpretation of high-
resolution airborne EM/Magnetic survey results (2003), has confirmed a folded and faulted, 
largely turbiditic (argillite/sandstone/greywacke), sequence throughout the property. 
Observations from outcrop and drill core indicate the auriferous quartz veins to be controlled by 
dilational and displacement structures similar to that characterizing the prolific gold producing 
districts of the Bendigo-Ballarat zone, of Australia, and the Meguma Group, of Nova Scotia (Fig. 
8.1). Within any regional-scale fold regime, there is typically a hierarchy of fold patterns repeated 
from the mega-scale to the micro-scale, whereby, useful information regarding the broader 
structural controls on quartz vein development, can be gleaned from outcrop and drill core. At one 
outcrop site, located 250 m northeast of the Shawn's Shot prospect, Copeland et al (2004) 
reported tight folds (within graphitic shale and sandstone) showing "small scale examples of 
breached anticlines" i.e., with quartz veins occupying breaks developed along anticlinal hinges. 
Also, a section of core from drill-hole GP04-43 (located 1.0 km west of the Jaclyn Zone) exhibits 
small-scale fold structures showing saddle reef type quartz vein fillings as well as bedding-parallel  
and axial planar quartz veins and veinlets, with local stockwork. Such features are reflective of the 
broader structural controls exerted on formation of auriferous quartz veins on the Golden Promise 
Property. 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 171 
 

The gold potential of the property area is further highlighted by its close spatial relationship with 
the Red Indian Line (RIL) – a regional-scale, orogenic, structure (and suture zone), marking  the 
northwestern edge of the Victoria Lake Supergroup (VLSG). This structural environment is similar 
to that of the gold-rich Baie Verte-Brompton Line (BBL) – an Appalachian-scale structure defining 
the western boundary of the Dunnage Zone in western to northeastern Newfoundland (Fig. 7.1); 
numerous gold occurrences (including quartz vein hosted types) are associated with the latter 
structure, including the presently-producing Pine Cove gold deposit on the Baie Verte Peninsula.  

The (Golden Promise) property's structural setting is also similar to that of the southeastern fringe 
zone of the VLSG, where numerous orogenic quartz vein hosted gold occurrences have been 
discovered, over a 40 km structural trend, encompassing the Valentine Lake gold camp and the 
fairly recent (2015-2017) Wilding Lake discovery area. [Ongoing drill programs in the Valentine 
Lake area, by Marathon Gold Corp., have recently concluded a measured and indicated resource of 
45,146,000 tonnes at 1.854 g/t (2,691,400 oz of contained gold) and an inferred resource totalling 
26,857,000 tonnes of 1.774 g/t Au (1,531,600 oz of gold)(Marathon Gold Corp. Press Release, May 
30, 2018)].  

In terms of exploration strategy, an important aspect of the quartz vein-hosted gold mineralization 
on the Golden Promise Property – one that is particularly useful in further exploration and 
discovery of the same – is the strong genetic link between arsenopyrite and gold mineralization; 
historical sampling of both rocks and soils on the property reveal a generally strong correlation 
between elevated to highly anomalous arsenic (As) and gold (Au), thereby, rendering arsenic an 
excellent geochemical pathfinder for (yet-undiscovered) gold occurrences in the area. In fact, 
historical – as well as the recent (2017) – soil geochemical sampling on the property, has shown 
elevated to anomalous arsenic (As) to be rather pervasive over the area, in contrast with the more 
'spotty' or localized Au-in-soil occurrences. This is not surprising given the susceptibility of 
arsenopyrite to oxidation and geochemical breakdown (typical of sulphides) compared to the 
relatively inert (or un-oxidative state) and stability of gold. Geochemical arsenic is, therefore, more 
readily dispersed in the environment, whereas, gold particles – particularly that associated with 
quartz veins – are largely dispersed by mechanical/erosional means. Thus, the presence of 
arsenopyrite or geochemically anomalous arsenic, represents potential for gold mineralization, on 
the property, that may not otherwise be evident. 

Present gold discoveries on the Golden Promise Property, including the Jaclyn Main, Jaclyn North, 
Jaclyn South, Christopher and Linda/Snow White (quartz vein) prospects, remain as 'open-ended' 
targets for future drilling investigations, as these zones have not, yet, been fully delineated by 
drilling. Also, the abundant occurrences of angular, auriferous, quartz float and gold-in-soil 
anomalies (which remain unsourced) likely, represent additional undiscovered gold 
occurrences/deposits on the property. All such areas or occurrences deserve further investigation 
(see Section 26).

25.2 Conclusions and Interpretations relating to the 2017 Trenching Program 
The 2017 trenching investigations on Licence 21281M, particularly on the Jaclyn North Zone (JNZ), 
proved interesting, although, deep glacial till cover precluded access to bedrock, for the most part. 
The program was successful, however, in exposing one of the JNZ quartz veins, at one trench site 
(T1), while, elsewhere, along the projected ENE quartz vein trend (tested over a distance of 220 
m), numerous, angular, auriferous quartz boulders were exposed, several of which contain visible 
gold. Weighted average Au analyses for these (i.e., combining the +150 & -150 mesh sample 
fractions) include grades of:  

1) 30.2 g/t & 208.5 g/t Au, for Trench 1 (T1);  

2) 1.04 g/t, 1.897 g/t & 4.5 g/t Au, for T2; and  

3) 31.96 g/t, 78.0 g/t, 163.99 g/t & 332.67 g/t Au, for T4.  

Channel sample results from the JNZ vein, encountered in T1, include assay grades of up to 35.5 
g/t Au/0.2 m and 7.09 g/t Au/0.69 m (+150 mesh sample fraction analyses)(see Section 8).  

The angularity and local clustering of the above-mentioned auriferous quartz boulders suggest 
likely proximity to a subsurface bedrock source. In fact, such a cluster of (apparently frost-heaved) 
quartz vein rubble/float was found directly overlying the JNZ vein, exposed in T1, which is believed 
to correlate with the JNZ Upper Subzone quartz vein system. As well, within the same trench, 
approx. 25 m farther south, another significant cluster of quartz float debris, indicates the possible 
presence (at depth) of the JNZ Middle Subzone vein system – particularly, given that the distance 
between the two subzones in nearby drill hole GP10-103, is also 25 m. Also, the large size of some 
of the float (up to 0.7 m wide) encountered in T2 and T4, suggest the presence of large quartz vein 
sources. 

As in the case of the JNZ, the trenching investigation of the Jaclyn South Zone (JSZ) was 
significantly hampered by deep glacial till cover and rapid water intake, resulting in 'caving'. 
Consequently, trenches T5 and T6 could not be sufficiently extended to adequately cross-cut the 
projected trend of the quartz vein system (see Section 9).  

Limited historical drilling (4 holes) on the JSZ, to date, has produced Au assay intersections of 
44.59 g/t /0.3 m (or 8.92 g/t /1.5 m diluted) and 2.59 g/t /0.3 m, for the Beta Vein system. The 
larger Alpha Vein, which has an estimated 'true width' of up to 3.0 m, has, thus far, yielded only 
low Au values (up to 0.12 g/t Au/0.5m and 0.19 g/t Au/0.3 m). Given the variability of vein widths 
and Au grades, typical of such quartz vein systems, further drilling beyond the present limited area 
of investigation, may yet prove up a more robust auriferous vein system.  

25.3 Jaclyn Main Zone Mineral Resource Estimate 
The Jaclyn Main Zone is estimated to contain a pit-constrained Inferred resource of approximately 
157,300 tonnes with an average capped gold grade of 11.4 g/t and an underground resource of 
200,200 tonnes with an average capped grade of 7.5 g/t.

shows the total resource together with the pit-constrained and underground portions.  The cutoff 
grade for the total resource is the weighted average of the pit-constrained and underground

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 
While further reconnaissance mapping, prospecting and sampling coverage is needed over the 
general Golden Promise Property, a number of specific areas are recommended for follow-up 
investigations based on the results of both the 2017 and earlier (historical) exploration programs.  
The budget for the work proposed is presented in Table 26.1. 

26.1 Mineral Licence 24015M 
Two areas deserving of further investigation, within Lic. 24015M (based on the results of the 2017 
prospecting & sampling), include:  

 

1) the general area of the four float samples which assayed 200 g/t Au (GPR-30), 233 ppb Au 
(GPR-32), 57.2 g/t Au (GPR-33) and 340 ppb Au (GPR-35), located near the Branden 
Occurrence (Fig. 41). Aside from the associated anomalous arsenic (up to 559 ppm), two of 
the samples produced anomalous concentrations of other elements as well, including Pb 
(130 ppm), Ag (4.4 ppm) and Bi (8 ppm), which may prove as useful pathfinders, in soils, in 
leading to a bedrock source.  

 

Also, glacial striations (030-040°) observed in the two historical trenches excavated 40 m 
WSW and 120 m SW of the Branden Occurrence, suggest these trenches to be off-trend 
with respect to the 'up-ice' source direction for the high-grade, auriferous, boulders (see 
Fig. 6.8). It is, therefore, recommended that trenching be conducted farther east to align 
with the indicated 'up-ice' direction. 

 
2) the area of two reconnaissance soil lines, located within the east-central portion of Lic. 

24015M (3.5 km SW of the Branden), where numerous, elevated to anomalous, Au and As 
responses were obtained (up to 17 ppb & 87 ppm, respectively) (Fig. 9.2). Elevated As 
values were obtained for over 50% of the 43 soil samples taken here, thus, indicating 
potential for widely-dispersed gold mineralization in the area. These responses are 
coincident, in part, with other anomalous elements of interest, as revealed by two samples 
– GPS-13 and GPS-18 – located approx. 130 m apart on the southern recce line. These 
results include: 

 

GP-S-17-13: 42.5 ppm Cu, 43.7 ppm Mo, 5.8 ppm Sb and 0.18 ppm Te, and  
GP-S-17-18: 13.65 ppm Mo, 4.1 ppm Sb and 0.19 ppm Te. 

 

The concentration of Te (Tellurium) is significant given that its average crustal abundance is 
only 0.001-0.005 ppm. 

 

Also, two float samples (GPR-15 & 16), taken adjacent to the southern recce line, both 
returned assay values of 50 ppb Au (the samples consisted of greywacke/sandstone, 
hosting minor disseminated pyrite and 1-3 cm wide, rusty, quartz veins).

Initial geochemical sampling over the Branden area, in 2004, involved 100m-spaced recce lines, 
thus, leaving considerable untested 'gaps' – nevertheless, producing five widely-spaced, elevated 
to anomalous, Au values, of 7 ppb, 8ppb, 18 ppb, 55 ppb and 177 ppb. Also, the two, above-
mentioned, soil lines, sampled by Great Atlantic (2017), 3.5 km farther southwest, were spaced 
250 m apart. More detailed soil sampling is, therefore, recommended for both these areas, 
utilizing 25m-spaced lines and 25m stations. In the case of the Branden area, grid coverage should 
encompass the sites of the gold-bearing quartz float, as well. [The presence of bedrock exposure, 
for both areas, suggests the possibility that the mineralized float may have a proximal/shallow 
bedrock source where soils may be more effective in reflecting subsurface mineralization].  

26.2 Mineral Licence 24017M 
A particularly interesting area worthy of follow-up, on Lic. 24017M, is the northwestern corner 
portion of the licence (Fig. 43) where 50 out of 70 reconnaissance soil samples (2017) returned 
elevated to anomalous As (10.7 to 327 ppm) as well as lesser, and more widely scattered, Au 
values (with five assays at 9-31 ppb and two at 212 ppb and 236 ppb Au). The most significantly 
concentrated, and highest, of the As results (which range from 48 to 327 ppm) comprise a large 
multi-station anomaly involving the northwesternmost sample sites (Fig. 43). No bedrock was 
noted in the area, except for a possible subcrop occurrence of sandstone cut by 10% rusty quartz 
veinlets which assayed 8 ppb Au. 

The high concentration of anomalous As-in-soils for the above area, most likely, suggests a local 
bedrock source. Given the strong association of arsenopyrite with gold mineralization on the 
property, such an extensive and pronounced arsenic (As) anomaly may indicate the presence of 
significant gold mineralization in the area. This is supported, to some extent, by the more widely 
scattered Au results which attain very high concentrations, including 212 ppb and 236 ppb Au. A 
detailed and systematic soil grid survey is recommended for the area to better define the existing 
Au and As anomalies, with the possible identification of others, where trenching investigations 
may then be carried out.  

26.3 Mineral Licence 21281M 
Areas deserving of further drilling investigations within this licence include the Jaclyn and Jaclyn 
West areas:  

26.3.1 Jaclyn Zone   
Given that none of the three main quartz vein systems in this area – Jaclyn North (JN), Jaclyn South 
(JS) and Jaclyn Main (JM) Zones – have, yet, been fully delineated by drilling, additional drill testing 
is warranted along both the ENE and WSW (projected) extensions of these zones. The projected 
ENE extension of the vein systems should constitute a priority target given that the present limits 
of drilling, in this area, occur in proximity to an interesting airborne geophysical feature (located 
still further ENE)  marked by a pronounced transition from a zone of very high resistivity 
(encompassing the present quartz vein gold discoveries in the area) to a zone of very low 
resistivity response. This feature lies within the core of the Jaclyn Anticline (Fig. 26.1 ) – the high 
and low resistivities having been inferred as corresponding, respectively, with the siliciclastic 
component of the VLSG stratigraphy and the (conductive) Caradocian Shale unit. Thus, potential 
for significant fold-hinge dilational opening – favoring a large-scale saddle reef type quartz vein 
emplacement – is implicated here.  



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 176 
 

As well, the sharp linear delineation of the resistivity feature may indicate the presence of a 
displacement feature which also has implications for potential significant quartz vein siting. 
Further discussion of this target area is presented below.  
 
Given that excavation efforts, during the 2017 trenching program, were hampered by excess 
glacial till depths, further investigation of the projected ENE extensions of the JNZ and JSZ quartz 
vein systems would be better served and more expeditiously (and cost-effectively) implemented, 
by direct drilling alone; this allows for the acquisition of useful geological information as well. In 
addition to the successful (trenching) encounter of one of the JNZ veins (at T1; see Figs. 9.6 & 9.7 ), 
further discovery by drilling, along the trend, is highly probable given the occurrences of significant 
clusters of angular, high-grade, auriferous, quartz vein float, up to 0.7 m wide, present at depth 
along Trenches 1, 2 and 4.  
 
26.3.1.1 Jaclyn Main Zone:  
The near-surface portion of eastern end of the zone has been tested by a few drillholes and can 
reasonably be regarded as a valid exploration target.  Six (6) holes with an aggregate length of 900 
meters are recommended to test this portion of the zone at depths of approximately 100 and 150 
meters below surface to establish whether the vein is present at these depths and if present, 
whether it is mineralized.   

If successful, this drill program will enlarge the Jaclyn Main Zone but regardless will establish the 
reasonable limits of the zone. 

26.3.1.2 Jaclyn North 
Four (4) holes with an aggregate length of 700 meters should be drilled here to test for extensions 
of the known veins. 

26.3.2 Jaclyn West Area 
Additional drilling is warranted to evaluate further strike and dip extensions of the Christopher 
Vein, as well as other zones of quartz veining and alteration identified by single-hole drill tests 
represented by drill holes GP04-42, 43 & 44 (see Fig. 26.1). These holes (located to the WSW and 
WNW of the Christopher Vein) reveal favorable alteration and structural features indicative of a 
prospective quartz-vein-zone gold environment.  
 

Drill Site GP04-42  (located 0.6 km WSW of the Christopher Vein) 
Further drilling is required at this site to more broadly assess the significance or scope of the 
alteration and quartz veining encountered during the initial drilling test. Variable spotty to patchy 
and locally pervasive sericite + chlorite + ankerite + silica alteration, with minor to locally abundant 
sulphides (mainly pyrite), persist throughout the entire 199.6 m drill hole. Three of several narrow 
quartz veins (including breccia zones) encountered, returned intersections of 0.16 g/t Au/0.4m, 
0.65 g/t Au/0.4 m and 0.24 g/t Au/0.5m (core length sample widths).  
 

Further prospecting is also recommended in the GP04-42 area to determine the source of a 
number of auriferous, arsenopyrite-bearing, quartz boulders (assaying 200-750 ppb Au) located 85 
m north of the drill collar. Give the drill-indicated overburden/till depth, here (12.5 m), 
prospecting efforts should focus on the 'up-ice' source direction, to the southwest. 
 
 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 177 
 

Drill Site GP04-43   (located 630 m WSW of, and along strike from, the Northwest Zone) 
 

Of interest at the GP04-43 drill site is a 7.4 m (core length) intersection of black graphitic shale 
with minor, thin, greywacke beds, cut by 40% stylolitic, laminated and stockwork quartz veins. Of 
further interest is the presence of cm-scale, fold-related, axial planar and saddle reef-type quartz 
vein fillings or structures, within the zone. These small-scale dilational features or openings 
typically indicate the presence of larger-scale equivalents – as part of higher-order (encompassing) 
folds – within the immediate to general area. Such features represent potential for significant 
concentrations of auriferous quartz zones (as veins, lenses or shoots) that may persist along the 
hinge of a large fold – where competency contrasts between different rock layers (sediments in 
this case) can result in significant dilational 'openings' (Fig. 8.1 ). In the prolific gold mining 
Bendigo district of Australia, 80% of the gold production is from "quartz bodies in anticlinal crests" 
(Website: Bendigo, Victoria, Australia - After Porter GeoConsultancy Pty Ltd, 2007). 
 
The above quartz-veined shale unit also exhibits local weak pervasive ankerite alteration as do 
adjacent units (although such alteration is not manifested or generally well-developed within black 
carbonaceous shales). However, in a deeper mudstone unit, which persists to the end of hole 
(EOH: 171.5 m), there is a reported increase of sericite alteration and fracture-fill pyrite 
throughout the last 4.5 m of hole. Although drilling was terminated at this depth, the core-logging 
geologist, D. Copeland, suggested that "perhaps the hole was approaching a vein zone" and should 
not have been discontinued (Copeland et al., 2005).  
 
A three-station soil gold anomaly (of 26-36 ppb) is also present at the GP04-43 site. Given the drill-
indicated 12.1 m till depth (true thickness), the anomaly may, either, be related to a shallow 
bedrock source elsewhere (nearby) or is the result of gold-bearing glacial till material derived from 
'up-ice', to the southwest. In any case, further investigation of the anomaly by prospecting and 
follow-up soil sampling should be undertaken.  
 
Drill Site GP04-44 
This site (located roughly 1.0 km WSW of the Christopher Vein) may be considered for further drill-
testing on account of its rather pervasive, weak to intense, alteration (sericite + chlorite + ankerite 
+ silica), associated quartz-calcite veinlets, local breccia structures and trace to minor pyrite, 
chalcopyrite and sphalerite, affecting mudstones and greywackes, throughout the entire 153 m 
hole. Furthermore, this zone lies along strike from the Christopher Vein.  
 

Also worthy of follow-up is the reported occurrence of a 'subcropping' of quartz breccia, assaying 
up to 1 g/t Au, at the drill site. A drill-indicated till cover thickness of 4.3 m was determined at the 
site of this occurrence, thus, ruling out an immediate subsurface bedrock source. Therefore, 
follow-up prospecting is recommended to test the proximal to distal 'up-ice' trend for such a 
source.  
 
Jaclyn Main-Jaclyn West Area 
The Jaclyn Main - Jaclyn West area lies within a large anticlinal fold structure (Jaclyn Anticline) – as 
interpreted from the mapping of O'Neill (2005) and results of the 2003 high-resolution airborne 
EM/Mag survey (Fig. 26.1 ). The anticlinal feature is one of several, large-scale, nappe-type, 
structures dominating the north-northwesterly to northeasterly extension of the Victoria Lake 
Supergroup (see Figs. 7.4 & 7.11  ). The sharply contrasting EM/resistivity responses, associated 



 

Golden Promise Property - National Instrument 43-101 Report 178 
 

with the Jaclyn Anticline, are interpreted as reflecting the resistive siliciclastic core of the fold 
structure and the outer, largely conductive, 450 m thick, (graphitic) Caradocian Shale unit.  

The abundant linear, ENE/WSW-trending, quartz vein systems discovered in the Jaclyn Main-Jaclyn 
West area, appear to represent axial planar breaks associated with the core of the Jaclyn Anticline. 
Thus far, these veins have been encountered only within the high-resistivity (core zone) area of 
the fold (Fig. 26.1 ), as drilling has not, yet, extended to the large low-resistivity area to the NE – 
albeit, with the exception of drill hole GP04-37 (the latter drill site, located north of the JMZ trend, 
does confirm the Caradocian Shale unit interpreted to underlie this area). Therefore, it is 
unknown, at this point, whether or not the axial planar quartz veins are as profusely developed 
within the latter unit as it is within the siliciclastic-dominated stratigraphy to the SW. However, 
probably more important, here, is the marked competency contrast between shales and 
siliciclastics which bodes excellent potential for fold-hinge dilational openings responsible for 
saddle reef-type quartz vein filling. The large-scale size of the resistivity feature may indicate 
potential for a large-scale form of this type of quartz body. These type of dilational structures 
comprise the main form of quartz-hosted gold deposits in the Bendigo-Ballarat district of Australia.  

Also noted with respect to the resistivity feature, is its sharp linear trend which may reflect some 
structural modification of the siliciclastics/shale (hinge) contact, due to displacement, although 
this is not evident elsewhere across the large fold (Fig. 26.1). Such a structural offset or 
displacement, if present, may have implications for additional or complementary siting of 
auriferous quartz.  

To assess the possibility of a saddle-reef type structure associated with the resistivity feature and 
(major) lithological contact, future drilling should be properly designed to effectively cross-cut any 
such zone. Given that the major folds throughout the Golden Promise Property area, have been 
determined, by O'Neill (2005), to plunge gently NE (at 13-19°), related quartz masses or bodies 
would be expected to follow such a plunge. Thus, some element of future drilling in this area 
should involve a series of SW-directed drill holes (at -45°), along linear resistivity feature, to test 
this possibility.

26.4 General Recommendations 
In terms of more regional follow-up on the Golden Promise property, some exploration focus 
should be given to areas or sites of dyke intrusions (as inferred from the 2003 airborne survey 
magnetic map) as these tend to follow many of the same structures as occupied by the quartz vein 
systems. A review of the drill log data for the Golden Promise prospects (present study) reveals an 
apparent strong spatial relationship between the sites of large quartz veins and the presence of 
mafic dykes (the latter generally occurring adjacent to the veins and exhibiting chill margins 
denoting its post-vein occurrence). While there is obviously no genetic relationship between the 
two, it is apparent that localized intrusions of dykes were facilitated, to a large extent, by the same 
structurally-prepared zones of weakness that had (preferentially) accommodated the 
hydrothermal fluids responsible for the quartz veins. Therefore, noting the occurrence of these 
magnetic dykes (via magnetic and resisitivity surveys) – in relation to favourable fold structures – 
can be a worthwhile tool for defining future gold exploration targets on the property. 

Follow-up investigations should be undertaken around all significant historical Au and/or As soil 
anomalies given that the discovery of the Linda-Snow White Prospect resulted from an 
investigation of a single-station Au anomaly (120 ppb).  

A final consideration for future work on the property is the importance of assessing the potential 
of permeable host rocks (particularly coarse sediments) as an additional source of gold 
mineralization. It is important to note that – in relation to the Bendigo gold district of Australia – 
"the largest tonnage deposits generally occur within permeable turbidites, immediately beneath, 
or within, carbonaceous shale caprock" (Johansen, 2001); such rocks may be infiltrated by gold-
bearing silicic fluids without necessarily forming quartz veins. Therefore, future sampling on the 
property (particularly via drilling) should be cognizant of this possibility, and may warrant some  
sampling of existing drill core, i.e., apart from the already sampled quartz veins. 

Exploration results on the Golden Promise Property, to date, highlight significant potential for one 
or more economic gold deposits. Future work should focus on extending and better defining the 
mineralized quartz vein systems, as well as identifying additional zones of mineralization along, 
and across strike from, the known vein systems.
