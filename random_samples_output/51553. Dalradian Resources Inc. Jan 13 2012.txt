1.0 SUMMARY 
 
1.1 SCOPE OF WORK 
 
At the request of Dalradian Resources Inc. (Dalradian Resources), Micon International 
Limited (Micon) has prepared an updated Mineral Resource Estimate and an independent 
Technical Report, compliant with the reporting standards and definitions required under 
Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101), for the company's Curraghinalt gold 
deposit at the Tyrone project in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.  In addition Micon has 
reviewed and opined on a proposed exploration and development program for the Tyrone 
project.  The Tyrone project is indirectly held by Dalradian Resources through a wholly-
owned subsidiary, Dalradian Gold Limited (Dalradian Gold), in whose name the licences and 
option agreements are registered. 
 
The scope of work included a review of the geology, mineralization model and exploration 
programs for the Curraghinalt deposit.  Drill hole data compilation and quality assurance/ 
quality control protocols, which form the foundation for the resource estimate, were reviewed 
in detail for this update.  Much of this work had been completed by Micon in 2007 for 
Tournigan Gold Corporation (now Tournigan Energy Ltd., Tournigan), the previous operator 
of the project and for Dalradian Resources in 2009-2010.  It was updated for this report. 
 
1.2 LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION 
 
The Tyrone project is located in County Tyrone and County Londonderry, Northern Ireland.  
The Curraghinalt gold deposit, located near the centre of the property, in County Tyrone, is 
approximately 127 km west of Belfast by road and 15 km northeast of the town of Omagh.  
Access to the Curraghinalt deposit is via a number of paved highways and local roads.  These 
include the B48 which runs from Omagh to Gortin and the B46 which runs from Gortin to 
Greencastle.  Private roads and farm tracks provide access within the property. 
 
The relevant property is the subject of four Mineral Prospecting Licences and four Option 
Agreements.  The four Mineral Prospecting Licences are issued by the Department of 
Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) and the four Option Agreements are issued by the 
Crown Estate Commissioners (CEC).   
 
In Northern Ireland, DETI is responsible for the granting of prospecting licences and mining 
licences for the exploration and development of minerals.  Dalradian Resources, through its 
subsidiary Dalradian Gold, presently has the benefit of the following DETI prospecting 
licences: DG1/08, DG2/08, DG3/11 and DG4/11. 
 
The CEC are responsible for the licensing of precious metal exploration.  Prior to 2011, the 
CEC issued prospecting licences similar to DETI.  In 2011, the CEC switched to a system of 
option agreements, whereby the option holder can exercise the option to convert the property 
into a lease.  Dalradian Resources, through its subsidiary Dalradian Gold, also has the benefit 
of the following CEC option agreements: DG1, DG2, DG3 and DG4.  (It should be noted that

in this document any reference to "TG-3" and "TG-4" rather than to "DG3" and "DG4" is a 
carryover from the previous ownership period by Tournigan Gold (hence "TG") and has no 
practical bearing or significance to the prospecting licences or option agreements.) 
 
The 4 DETI licences correspond to the 4 CEC option agreements thereby granting base and 
precious metal mineral exploration rights to four contiguous pieces of ground.  The licences 
cover a total area of some 844 km2.  (See Figure 1.1.)

The four pieces of property are often referred to simply as DG1, DG2, DG3 and DG4 or DG-
1, DG-2, DG-3 and DG-4 (with or without hyphens).  In this report they shall be referred to as 
DG1, DG2, DG3 and DG4 although some older figures provided herein show them as DG-1, 
DG-2, DG-3 and DG-4.   
 
The approximate centre of the two most important licence areas, DG1 and DG2, is located at 
latitude 54o 41' 24" north and longitude 7o 04' 09" west.   
 
The mineral exploration rights are owned by a former Tournigan subsidiary, Dalradian Gold, 
which was acquired by Dalradian Resources in a transaction dated September 28, 2009.  They 
are renewable, subject to certain requirements, for two-year periods from the date of issue and 
must have biennial reports submitted to the licensing authorities.  At the end of six years 
(provided that it has endured that long), the licence is not continued; rather, a fresh licence 
must be issued.  Dalradian Gold had previously provided the renewal reports to DETI in 
support of the licences. 
 
Licences DG1 and DG2 (and the corresponding CEC option agreements) were reissued in 
January, 2008.  The licences were issued for a term which may total up to six years (subject to 
the conditions described in Section 4 of this report).  A first renewal of these licences was 
granted in January, 2010 and a second renewal was granted in November, 2011 with an 
effective date of January, 2012.  Reissue of these licences is scheduled for January 1, 2014.   
 
Licences DG3 and DG4 (and the corresponding CEC option agreements) were due for their 
first extension in April, 2011.  Due to timing problems in the renewal process, the licences 
were reissued as new licences in April, 2011.  The licences were issued for a term which may 
total up to six years (subject to the conditions described in Section 4 of this report) with 
reissue scheduled for April 24, 2017. 
 
1.3 GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
 
The Tyrone property contains mesothermal gold mineralization, with gold disseminated in 
quartz-sulphide veins, at the Curraghinalt deposit on licence DG1.  The general strike 
direction of the quartz-sulphide veins is approximately west-northwest and the dip is 
approximately 60º to 70º to the north.  Additionally, on licence DG2, there are known 
occurrences of gold mineralization in silicified rhyolite breccias, and porphyry-style copper 
mineralization.  It has also been postulated that the DG2 licence is also a potential host for 
volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) style mineralization due to stratigraphic correlations 
with mineral belts in Newfoundland and Scandinavia. 
 
The geological history of the project and the immediate surrounding area is related to the 
closing of the Iapetus Ocean in Ordovician time. 
 
The Curraghinalt deposit is located 3 km to the north of the northeast-southwest striking 
Omagh Thrust Fault.  This major fault has thrust Dalradian Supergroup rocks from the 



 

 4

northwest over the Ordovician-aged Tyrone Volcanic Group (TVG) rocks, part of the Tyrone 
Igneous Complex, located to the south.  The Dalradian metasediments on the northern side of 
the thrust strike northeast-southwest and dip to the northwest.  The lithologies are interpreted 
to lie on the lower limb of a gently to moderately northwest dipping, southeast upward-facing, 
major recumbent isoclinal fold, referred to as the Sperrin overfold or the Sperrin Nappe. 
 
The Dalradian stratigraphy in the DG1 licence area is inverted, occupying the lower limb of 
the overturned Sperrin Nappe.  The Dalradian formations present in the deposit area are, from 
the southeast (at the Omagh Thrust) to the northwest and, from the youngest to the oldest, the 
Mullaghcarn, Glengawna and Glenelly Formations.  The Mullaghcarn Formation, which hosts 
the Curraghinalt deposit, consists of mixed semi-pelites, quartz semi-pelites and psammites.  
The Glengawna Formation comprises a mixed package of graphitic pelites, graphitic semi-
pelites, chloritic semi-pelites and minor psammites.  Furthest north on licence DG1 is the 
Glenelly Formation, which is comprised of pelites, semi-pelites and quartz semi-pelites.  
Further to the north on licences DG3 and DG4 lie more clastic sediments and limestones of 
the Dalradian along with a small area of unconformable Carboniferous sandstone. 
 
Mineralized vein structures at the Curraghinalt deposit represent composite veins that have 
been developed over time by four distinct periods of quartz injection and sulphide-rich 
hydrothermal fluids.  Mineralized veins are best developed in the relatively brittle semi-pelites 
and psammites, rather than in the more ductile pelitic horizons.  Barren quartz veins represent, 
for the most part, the first stage of quartz injection that was essentially barren in gold.  These 
veins are generally quite narrow, generally occur in pelite units, and fill the available shear, 
thus effectively sealing the shear for later stage gold-bearing quartz injection.  Available 
evidence suggests that the hosting structures for these veins, or parallel ones, may strike onto 
the DG3 and DG4 licences. 
 
The upper part of the TVG is comprised of bimodal sequences of basaltic and andesitic to 
rhyolitic submarine and subaerial lavas, volcaniclastics with chert horizons and intercalations 
of graptolitic shales.  These lithologies are preceded by submarine basaltic andesite pillow 
lavas and associated intrusives.  A series of porphyry bodies and a series of calc-alkaline 
granitic intrusions intrude the volcano-sedimentary sequence. 
 
Work by Earls (1987) and others suggests the presence of three island arc volcanic cycles 
favourable for VMS deposits, adjacent to the back arc basal ophiolites, within the TVG on 
licence DG2.  These cycles are designated from top to bottom as Cycle 3, the Broughderg 
Formation, Cycle 2, the Bonnety Bush-Glencurry Formation and Cycle 1 the Dungate-
Tanderagee Formation.  The tops of each cycle are marked by an erratic increase in 
volumetrically minor chert or ironstone, which is taken to represent the culmination of a 
cycle.   
 
1.4 HISTORY 
 
The DG1 and DG2 licence areas were acquired initially, in 1981, by Ulster Base Metals 
Limited (later known as Ulster Minerals) an entity which later became a wholly-owned 



 

 5

subsidiary of Ennex International plc (Ennex).  Ennex conducted exploration on the property 
between 1986 and 1999.  Ennex sold its interest in Ulster Minerals to Nickelodeon Minerals 
Inc. (Nickelodeon) in January, 2000.  In August, 2000, the name of Nickelodeon was changed 
to Strongbow Resources Inc. and, subsequently, to Strongbow Exploration Inc. (Strongbow). 
 
In February, 2003, Tournigan entered into an option agreement with Strongbow to earn an 
interest of up to 100% in the Curraghinalt deposit.  At the same time, Tournigan entered into a 
similar option agreement with Strongbow in respect of its "Tyrone project" in the TVG.  
Tournigan established Dalradian Gold as a wholly-owned subsidiary through which it would 
earn its interests in the Curraghinalt and Tyrone properties which were subsequently 
converted to licences UM-1/02 and UM-2/02. 
 
In the following year (February, 2004), Tournigan entered into a letter agreement with 
Strongbow for the outright purchase by Tournigan of all of the issued and outstanding shares 
of Ulster Minerals.  A net smelter royalty of 2% held by Ennex was transferred to Minco plc.  
Full transfer of ownership in Ulster Minerals to Tournigan was completed in December, 2004.   
 
During this period, Tournigan also applied for and received the licences which later became 
DG3 and DG4 and lie to the northwest of licences UM-1/02 and UM-2/02.  As well, licences 
UM-1/02 and UM-2/02 were converted in name to licences DG1 and DG2 and their internal 
boundary was moved to reflect the location of the Omagh Thrust, the boundary between the 
Dalradian metasediments and the TVG. 
 
As described above, in September, 2009, Dalradian Resources entered into an agreement with 
Tournigan to purchase Dalradian Gold and all of its Northern Ireland assets. 
 
Prior to the work of Ennex/Ulster Base Metals gold was recognized in the gravels of the 
Moyola River as early as 1652 and, in the 1930s, an English company reported plans for 
alluvial gold mining in a prospectus, but very little work appears to have occurred.  The 
licences were held by other companies prior to Ulster Base Metals and the Geological Survey 
of Northern Ireland (GSNI) completed a report on the gold potential of the area. 
 
Between 1983 and 1997 Ennex conducted a significant amount of exploration drilling at 
Curraghinalt and other targets in the area such as Cashel Rock.  Ennex also completed a 
program of underground development on two of the veins at Curraghinalt.  Nickelodeon and 
Strongbow completed very little work on the property. 
 
Due to the relatively advanced stage of historical exploration completed at the Curraghinalt 
deposit by the previous operators of the property, in 2003 Tournigan initially moved directly 
to infill and deeper drilling and only undertook a small amount of additional exploration.  
Some geophysical surveys had been carried out on a regional scale to delineate drill targets 
along strike and some prospecting, sampling and mapping, sufficient to retain the other 
licences, was completed.  Tournigan also compiled an extensive database of available 
historical exploration information and data. 
 



 

 6

The drill program allowed Tournigan to report a mineral resource estimate for Curraghinalt in 
2007 consisting of both indicated and inferred resources (Mukhopadhyay, 2007).  This 
estimate was performed by Micon.  After completion of the resource estimate, and before 
halting exploration at the deposit, Tournigan completed four more holes to intersect deeper 
mineralization which were not available to be used in completion of the resource estimate at 
the time.   
 
1.5 EXPLORATION 
 
After acquisition of the property by Dalradian Resources, Micon modified the geological 
model to take into account the results from the last four Tournigan holes and published an 
updated mineral resource estimate (Hennessey and Mukhopadhyay, 2010) in a Technical 
Report supporting the listing of the company. 
 
Since acquisition of the Tyrone project, Dalradian Resources has embarked upon a campaign 
of drilling largely concentrated on the Curraghinalt deposit.  This program consists of an 
additional 45 diamond drill holes totalling 20,561.9 m as described in Section 10 of this 
report.  As a result the company determined that it was appropriate to update the mineral 
resource estimate for the Curraghinalt deposit. 
 
1.6 MINERAL RESOURCES 
 
In order to prepare the updated mineral resource estimate, the mineralized area was again 
divided into different zones with statistical analysis carried out separately on all zones.  
Resources were estimated by the inverse distance interpolation method with selected checks 
on larger veins by ordinary kriging.  Vein thickness and metal accumulation (grade times 
thickness) were interpolated into the model with block grade determined by division of the 
metal accumulation by interpolated thickness.   
 
The resource has been classified following the standards and definitions of the Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM).  The mineral resource has been 
reported at an economic cut-off grade of 5 g/t Au over a minimum thickness of 1 m.  All 
mineralized blocks in the block model which were greater than 0.10 m in thickness were 
diluted to 1 m at zero grade (for the diluting material) and reported if they then met the cut-off 
grade.   
 
The results of the 2011 mineral resource estimate are presented in Table 1.1.  This estimate is 
based on exploration data available as of October 10, 2011 and is current as of November 30, 
2011.

To the best knowledge of the authors, the stated mineral resources are not materially affected 
by any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, 
political or other relevant issues.  There are no known mining, metallurgical, infrastructure or 
other factors that materially affect this mineral resource estimate. 
 
The Curraghinalt mineral resource estimate by Dibya Kanti Mukhopadhyay, MAusIMM 
(CP), is compliant with the current CIM standards and definitions as required under NI 43-
101 and is, therefore, reportable as a mineral resource by Dalradian Resources.  However, the 
reader should be cautioned that mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 
demonstrated economic viability. 
 
1.7 CONCLUSIONS 
 
With further exploration there is potential for the conversion of mineral resources from the 
Inferred and Indicated categories to the Indicated and Measured categories at Curraghinalt.  
Within the present resource estimate, only the major vein systems have mineral resources 
classified as Measured or Indicated.  While some close-spaced drilling has been undertaken 
on the property, more is required and it is Micon's opinion that there are many sub-veins 
which have good potential to be brought into the Indicated resource category. 
 
The above mineral resource has been estimated largely for the central part of the Curraghinalt 
deposit.  There are sufficient indications, based on preliminary mapping and geochemical 
sampling, for exploration potential in either direction from the deposit and there is good 
potential that some of the veins identified in the present study may contribute further to future 
resource estimates.  Deep drilling has indicated significant potential down dip.  The regional 
geochemical, mapping and sampling work clearly indicates that there are parallel trends of 
mineralization in conformity with the Curraghinalt trend in the Dalradian metasediments. 
 
The Curraghinalt gold deposit may be regarded as a mid-stage exploration project on which a 
reasonably-sized gold mineral resource of good grade has been estimated.  Additionally there 
are other good exploration opportunities on the four licence areas for gold and base metal 
mineralization.

Dalradian Resources has designed a program of exploration and preliminary engineering for 
the Curraghinalt gold deposit as well as the remainder of the mineral licence areas at the 
Tyrone project.  The program is summarized in Table 1.2.  Details for the exploration and 
development program may be found in Section 19 of this report.

Micon has reviewed the exploration program and finds it to be reasonable and warranted in 
light of the data presented and observations made in this report.  Micon recommends that 
Dalradian Resources proceed with the program.  After completion of the proposed drilling at 
the Curraghinalt deposit Micon also recommends that the company consider preparing a 
preliminary economic assessment (PEA or scoping study) for the deposit.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
Dalradian Resources Inc. (Dalradian Resources) has retained Micon International Limited 
(Micon) to prepare an updated mineral resource estimate for the Curraghinalt gold deposit and 
an independent Technical Report, in accordance with the reporting standards and definitions 
required under Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101), on the Tyrone property in 
Northern Ireland.  This report presents the results of the mineral resource estimate and a 
summary of the project's geology and exploration potential. 
 
At least four previous estimates of mineral resources are known to have been completed on 
the Curraghinalt deposit.  The most recent, prior to Micon's involvement with the property, 
was prepared by John V. Tully & Associates Inc. (Tully) on behalf of Tournigan Gold 
Corporation (now Tournigan Energy Ltd., Tournigan).  The independent Technical Report for 
this estimate is dated January 27, 2005 and was filed on SEDAR on March 24, 2005 (Tully, 
2005).  Since the completion of Tully's mineral resource estimate, Tournigan undertook 
further exploration work on the property, concentrating on the Curraghinalt deposit.   
 
Micon prepared a second estimate of mineral resources on the Curraghinalt deposit for 
Tournigan in 2007.  This took into account the previous exploration work and 20 additional 
holes completed since the beginning of 2005.  This estimate is described in a Technical report 
dated November, 2007 (Mukhopadhyay, 2007) which was filed on SEDAR by Tournigan on 
January 17, 2008.  After the database for that estimate was frozen, Tournigan completed four 
more deep holes on the deposit to test the down plunge extent of those existing resources and 
then ceased work there.  After 2007, a small amount of prospecting and sampling was 
completed on the rest of the property in order to hold the licences. 
 
Dalradian Resources acquired the Tyrone project in the fall of 2009 and retained Micon to 
update the 2007 resource estimate with the final four holes as part of a Technical Report 
prepared to support the initial listing of the company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).   
 
Subsequent to Dalradian Resources' acquisition of the Tyrone project, a diamond drill 
campaign was started.  From the start of the drilling to the resource cut-off date, an additional 
20,561.9 m were drilled in 45 surface diamond drill holes.  The updated mineral resource 
estimate presented in this report incorporates this new information 
 
Tournigan's, and therefore Tully's and Micon's, previous work concentrated on the 
Curraghinalt gold deposit located on concession DG1.  There also exists gold and 
volcanogenic massive sulphide exploration potential on the south side of the Omagh Thrust 
Fault as well as the potential for along strike continuation of the Curraghinalt deposit 
mineralization.  That potential will also be described herein. 
 
The geological setting of the property, mineralization style and occurrences, and exploration 
history were described in reports that were prepared by Peatfield (2003), Tully (2005), 
Williams (2007), Coller (2007) and in various government and other publications listed in the 
references of this report.  The relevant sections of those reports are reproduced herein.

The Tyrone property was visited by B. Terrence Hennessey, P.Geo., Vice President of Micon 
and based in the firm's head office in Toronto, Ontario Canada, on November 6 and 7, 2009.  
Discussions were held with representatives of Aurum Exploration Services Ltd. (Aurum) and 
Mr. Patrick Anderson, a director of Dalradian Resources.  Aurum provided local project 
management services on behalf of Tournigan and provided the same to Dalradian Resources.  
Mr. Hennessey conducted a second site visit to the Curraghinalt project from October 3 to 5, 
2010.  
 
The Tyrone property was also visited by Dibya Kanti Mukhopadhyay, MAusIMM (CP), 
Senior Mineral Resource Geologist with Micon, based in the firm's office in Norwich, United 
Kingdom, between August 10 and 12, 2007.  Mr. Mukhopadhyay's visit was in conjunction 
with the previous resource estimation assignment completed for Tournigan.  At that time 
discussions were held with Joe Ringwald, Vice President, Technical Services, Ravi Sharma, 
Consulting Manager, Resource and Reserve with Tournigan, and with representatives of 
Aurum. 
 
Mr. Mukhopadhyay's visit to the Curraghinalt deposit site included field inspection, 
inspection of three major veins observed in the underground adit on the property, inspection 
of drill core and discussion of sampling and assay procedures, quality assurance/quality 
control (QA/QC) procedures and data security.  In addition to visiting and reviewing the 
above, Mr. Hennessey visited the Cashel Rock showing on the DG2 concession and collected 
selected confirmation samples from underground and surface exposures as well as drill core 
for check assaying. 
 
Messrs. Mukhopadhyay and Hennessey are Qualified Persons (QP) as defined in NI 43-101. 
 
The present report and mineral resource estimate is based on exploration results and 
interpretation current as of October, 2011. 
 
This report is intended to be used by Dalradian Resources subject to the terms and conditions 
of its contract with Micon.  That contract permits Dalradian Resources to file this report as an 
NI 43-101 Technical Report with the Canadian Securities Regulatory Authorities pursuant to 
provincial securities legislation.  Except for the purposes legislated under provincial securities 
laws, any other use of this report, by any third party, is at that party's sole risk. 
 
 

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
Micon has reviewed and analyzed exploration data provided by Dalradian Resources, its 
consultants and previous operators of the property, and has drawn its own conclusions 
therefrom, augmented by its direct field examination.  Micon has not carried out any 
independent exploration work, drilled any holes or carried out any significant program of 
sampling and assaying.  However, precious metal-bearing veins are visible in an adit and 
drifts developed underground and have also been found on surface in a nearby gravel pit. 



 

 11

 
While no large scale mining of precious metals has taken place in the immediate area there is 
a small producing gold deposit nearby known as Cavanacaw and held by Galantas Gold 
Corporation (Galantas) which substantiates the local presence of gold mineralization (see 
Section 16).  Samples collected by Micon come from core or mineralized exposures and 
independently confirm the presence of gold at grades similar to those claimed by others.  
 
While exercising all reasonable diligence in checking, confirming and testing it, Micon has 
relied upon the data presented by Dalradian Resources, and any previous operators of the 
project, in formulating its opinion. 
 
The various agreements under which Dalradian Resources holds title to the mineral lands for 
this project have not been thoroughly investigated or confirmed by Micon and Micon offers 
no opinion as to the validity of the mineral title claimed.  The descriptions were provided by 
Dalradian Resources as received from DETI and CEC, the entities responsible for licensing 
mineral exploration in Northern Ireland (see Section 4.2). 
 
The description of the property is presented here for general information purposes only, as 
required by NI 43-101.  Micon is not qualified to provide professional opinion on issues 
related to mining and exploration title or land tenure, royalties, permitting and legal and 
environmental matters.  Accordingly, the authors have relied upon the representations of the 
issuer, Dalradian Resources, for Section 4 of this report, and has not verified the information 
presented therein. 
 
The conclusions and recommendations in this report reflect the authors' best judgment in light 
of the information available at the time of writing.  Micon reserves the right, but will not be 
obliged, to revise this report and conclusions if additional information becomes known to it 
subsequent to the date of this report.  Use of this report acknowledges acceptance of the 
foregoing conditions. 
 
Those portions of the report that relate to the location, property description, infrastructure, 
history, deposit types, exploration, drilling, sampling and assaying (Sections 4 to 11) are 
taken, at least in part, from previous Technical Reports prepared by Micon and others as well 
as updated information provided by Dalradian Resources. 
 
 

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
4.1 LOCATION 
 
The Tyrone property is located in County Tyrone and County Londonderry, Northern Ireland.  
The Curraghinalt gold deposit is found on the property, approximately 75 km west of Belfast 
and 15 km northeast of the town of Omagh.  The property is accessible by paved road, a 
distance of approximately 127 km from Belfast.  See Figure 4.1.

4.2 DESCRIPTION 
 
The Tyrone property is the subject of four Mineral Prospecting Licences and four option 
agreements.  The four Mineral Prospecting Licences are issued by the Department of 
Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) and the four Option Agreements are issued by the 
Crown Estate Commissioners (CEC).  The Mineral Development Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 
makes DETI responsible for the grant of prospecting licences and mining licences for 
exploration and development of minerals.  The CEC is responsible for the licensing of 
precious metal exploration.  Before 2011, the CEC issued Mineral Prospecting Licences 
similar to DETI.  However, in 2011 this was changed to a system of option agreements.  The 
option agreements are similar to the prospecting licences in that they coincide with the DETI 
licences in area and their renewal periods.  DETI notes: 
 

"Prospecting licences for precious metals are issued by the Crown Estate Commissioners 
(CEC) and companies wishing to explore for precious metals should apply simultaneously to 
the CEC and the Department for licences.  Once the Department issues its licence, CEC will 
normally issue a concurrent licence for a conterminous area."  (DETI, Minerals and Petroleum 
Exploration and Development in Northern Ireland 1997-2000). 

 
Dalradian Resources, through its subsidiary Dalradian Gold, presently has the benefit of the 
following DETI prospecting licences: DG1/08, DG2/08, DG3/11 and DG4/11.  In addition the 
company, through Dalradian Gold, has the benefit of the following CEC option agreements: 
DG1, DG2, DG3 and DG4.   
 
The four DETI licences correspond to the four CEC option agreements thereby granting base 
and precious metal mineral exploration rights to four contiguous pieces of ground.  The 
licences cover a total area of some 844 km2.  (See Figure 4.1.) 
 
The four pieces of property are often referred to simply as DG1, DG2, DG3 and DG4 or DG-
1, DG-2, DG-3 and DG-4 (with or without hyphens).  In this report they shall be referred to as 
DG1, DG2, DG3 and DG4 although some older figures provided herein show them as DG-1, 
DG-2, DG-3 and DG-4 as well as DG-01, DG-02, DG-03 and DG-04 or TG-03 and TG-04 
(DG3 and DG4).   
 
The approximate centre of licences DG1 and DG2 is located at latitude 54º 41' 24" north and 
longitude 7º 04' 09" west.  The two additional licence areas DG3 and DG4 lie to the north and 
west of DG1.   
 
Licence and option agreement maps, showing the boundaries of DG1, DG2, DG3 and DG4, 
have been issued by DETI and the CEC.  DETI utilizes the Irish National Grid system of 
easting and northing which is then used for reference.  The Tyrone property is located at 
approximately 25700 mE and 38600 mN.

Details on the eight licences, including size and expiry dates are presented in Table 4.1 below.  
The DETI licences and the CEC option agreements expire on the same dates and so only four 
records are shown in Table 4.1.

The mineral resource estimate presented in this report is located entirely on the property 
covered by licence DG1.  A net smelter return royalty of 2% is payable to Minco plc in 
respect of DG1. 
 
Table 4.2 lists the required annual expenditures made on each of the four licence areas since 
acquisition by Tournigan in 2002.  In the reissuing and renewals undertaken in 2011, the 
requirement for a minimum expenditure for a work program was removed.  The licences 
outline a general work program to be undertaken on the four licences without a minimum 
spending commitment. 
 
Prospecting licences (and CEC option agreements) in Northern Ireland are issued for a 2-year 
period and may be renewed (or extended), subject to relevant conditions being met and 
satisfied, on two occasions for a period of two further years, for a total of six years.  At the 
end of each 2-year period a progress work report is submitted to the licensing authorities in 
order to support renewal, along with a letter indicating the intention to continue work on the 
license into the following 2-year period.  At the end of each 6-year period a full reissuing 
application process must be undertaken whereby a full 6-year work report is submitted to the 
licensing bodies along with a new application for another 6-year period.  Renewals, 
extensions and reissuing are not automatic. 
 
The CEC option agreements allow the option holder the option of taking out a lease on the 
land.  The tenant agrees to pay rent/royalty to the landlord (in this case the CEC) on the 
production of precious metals.

Licences DG1 and DG2 (and the corresponding CEC option agreements) were reissued in 
January, 2008.  The licences and option agreements were issued for a term which may total up 
to six years (subject to the conditions described above).  A first renewal of these licences and 
agreements was granted in January 2010 and a second renewal was granted in November 
2011 with an effective date of January 2012.  Reissuing of these licences and option 
agreements is scheduled for January 1, 2014. 
 



 

 16

Licences DG3 and DG4 (and the corresponding CEC option agreements) were due for their 
first extension in April, 2011.  Due to timing problems in the renewal process, the DETI 
licences were reissued as new licences in April 2011 and the CEC licences were reissued as 
option agreements.  The licences and option agreements were issued for a term which may 
total up to six years (subject to the conditions described above) with reissuing scheduled again 
for April 24, 2017.  
 
Dalradian Gold provides annual reports in support of the licences and options agreements, 
usually around March of each year. 
 
Licensees are required to give notice of their intention to enter land to carry out work and 
must seek the agreement of landowners before entering their property.  Compensation is 
generally payable to the landowner for any damage caused during exploration. 
 
DETI is required to consult with other departments and with public bodies concerning its 
intention to issue a licence and is also required to place notices in the Belfast Gazette and at 
least one local newspaper.  This is primarily to allow the owners of surface land within the 
area under application the opportunity to make their views known. 
 
DETI notes that a draft licence and a 'letter of offer' are provided to applicants once all 
comments have been considered.  The letter of offer may contain a number of conditions 
although DETI notes that, at the prospecting stage, it is usually sufficient for the applicant to 
inform all listed contacts of its plans and progress.  When the conditions set out in the letter of 
offer are accepted and the terms of the draft licence agreed, the licence is executed by DETI 
and the company. 
 
DETI states that planning permission is not required for early stage exploration although the 
Planning Service of the Department of the Environment must be informed of the planned 
work including the nature and scale, time and location of the company's activities and drill 
hole locations. 
 
4.3 LOCATION OF MINERALIZED ZONES 
 
Previous exploration has identified the Curraghinalt vein system.  An adit was developed by 
Ennex between 1987 and 1989 to access the deposit.  The location of the Curraghinalt gold 
deposit relative to the boundaries of DG1 and DG2 can be seen in Figure 4.2.  Details of the 
locations of the mineralized zones, the portal and adit are shown on Figure 4.3.

4.4 PERMITS 
 
Licence holders are required to give up to four weeks notice of their intention to enter land to 
carry out work and must seek the agreement of landowners before entering their property.  
Compensation is generally payable to the landowner for any damage caused during 
exploration. 
 
The issuing of a prospecting licence by DETI allows permitted development to take place 
without additional planning permission.  The Planning Service of the Department of the 
Environment must be notified in writing prior to the work taking place giving details of the 
location of the proposed development, target minerals, details of plant and operations and 
anticipated timescale.  In addition, DETI must also be notified in writing at least 28 days 
before work commences if there are any environmentally designated areas in close proximity 
to the work.  This is required to allow DETI and other agencies to determine if any further 
studies or permissions will be required before the work can take place.  Before starting any 
borehole and upon completion, notification is required to be given to the Health and Safety 
Executive of Northern Ireland (HSENI). 
 
Dalradian Gold reports that it has negotiated land access and compensation agreements with 
all the landowners for the present drilling program.  Additional access agreements will be 
required when drilling to the east and west of the known mineralization takes place.  
Dalradian Gold indicates that it expects to be able to successfully negotiate access to the 
required land to undertake any future drill programs on the Curraghinalt property. 
 
4.5 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Micon has not undertaken a review of potential environmental concerns or liabilities at the 
Tyrone property.   
 
At the time of Micon's first site visit in August, 2007, drilling was the only activity being 
carried out.  Shortly after that, all work ceased and no activity was occurring during the 
second site visit in 2009.  Drilling resumed in early 2010 and has continued up to the time of 
writing. 
 
Water flow and returns are channelled from the drill collar using 5-in drainpipes.  The water 
and returns are directed into large sediment settling sumps positioned close to the drill.  The 
solids are settled out and the water is returned to the drill, thus forming a closed loop water 
system.  Temporary abstraction permits to allow for makeup water for the drilling operation 
have been granted by the Northern Ireland Environmental Agency (NIEA). 
 
Tully (2005) refers to, and quotes the following, from a report prepared by Peatfield (2003): 
 

"One specific subject of interest is that the Owenkillew River has been designated by the 
Government of Northern Ireland as an Area of Special Scientific Interest.  ("ASSI").  The 
Owenkillew River drains that part of the property containing the Curraghinalt gold deposit via 



 

 19

the Curraghinalt and Attagh Burn streams and the Glenlark River.  Lyons et al. (2001) 
reviewed the various reports regarding this designation and field studies related to it.  The 
purpose of their work was to decide whether or not it would be reasonable to challenge the 
ASSI designation; their conclusion was that a challenge was not justified. 
 
… The principal concerns appear to be: 
 
The presence (JNCC 2003) of the Freshwater Pearl Mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera), 
 
The presence (JNCC 2003) of the River Otter Lutra lutra, and 
 
The presence (Preston et al. 2001) of the River Water-crowfoot [an aquatic flowering plant] 
Ranunculus penicillatus var. penicillatus. 
 
These species are all of some special concern in the United Kingdom.  On the Tyrone 
property, they are all restricted to the river and its immediate environs.  It would appear that 
the most critical is the pearl mussel, which is found in three sites well upstream from the 
confluence of the Glenlark and incidentally of the Curraghinalt deposit." 

 
The Owenkillew River was also designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and is 
thus also a Natura 2000 site (an EU-wide network of nature protection areas established under 
the 1992 Habitats Directive) for the reasons stated above. 
 
The above is provided for background information purposes only. 
 
 

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
Access to the Tyrone property is via a number of highways and local roads.  These include the 
B48 from Omagh to Gortin and the B46 from Gortin to Greencastle.  Local county roads, 
private roads and farm tracks provide generally good access within the property.  Figure 5.1 
shows the network of local roads and rivers around the Tyrone project area. 
 
Local climate conditions are temperate.  The average annual temperature is 9º C.  Average 
daily temperatures vary between 4.1º C and 14.7º C throughout the year.  Average annual 
precipitation is 852 mm, the majority of which falls in the winter months between September 
and January (average >80 mm per month).  Snowfall is usually restricted to areas of higher 
elevation and occurs on 10 days or less per year.  Exploration activities can generally be 
conducted year-round. 
 
The town of Omagh (population approximately 17,000) provides lodging and local labour, as 
do smaller local villages.  Few experienced mining personnel are available locally although 
there is a small mining industry in Northern Ireland (salt and gold) and the Irish Republic has 
a number of underground base metal mines.  There is a large quarrying industry in Northern 
Ireland.  The principal economic activities in the area of the licences are sheep farming and, to 
a lesser extent, the raising of beef cattle.

Belfast is the capital city of Northern Ireland and supports a population of approximately 
300,000.  From Belfast, Omagh and the project can be reached by paved road, more than half 
of which is limited access highway.  The over-road distance is approximately 110 km and 
requires less than 1.5 hours in good weather.  Belfast is served by both a domestic and 
international airport with frequent daily flights to the rest of the UK and Europe. 
 
The village of Gortin (pronounced Gorchin) is located a few kilometres from the Curraghinalt 
gold deposit at the western edge of licence DG1 (see Figure 5.1).  Dalradian Gold, has a small 
field office there as well as core storage facilities all of which are rented.  Gortin is centrally 
located within the licence areas and well situated to support the exploration program.  
Dalradian Gold also leases an office and core storage facility in Omagh near the road leading 
to Gortin.  Geology and administration staff are located there as well as the principal core 
logging and storage facility.  
 
A principal power sub-station is located at Plumbridge, approximately 22 km north of Omagh 
and the main 110-KV power line runs just outside Omagh.  Local water resources are 
abundant. 
 



 

 21

Topography is rolling hills and broad valleys (see Figure 5.2).  Glacial deposits and peat cover 
much of the area resulting in mixed forest and heathlands, as well as the farmland in the 
valleys.  Relief ranges between around 100 masl in the major river valleys to some 550 masl.

6.0 HISTORY 
 
6.1 ACQUISITION HISTORY 
 
The property containing the Curraghinalt deposit was acquired initially by Ulster Base Metals 
(which later became Ulster Minerals) in 1981, an entity which later became a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Ennex International plc.  Ennex conducted exploration on the property between 
1982 and 1999.  Ennex sold its interest in Ulster Minerals to Nickelodeon in January, 2000.  
In August, 2000, the name of Nickelodeon was changed to Strongbow Resources Inc., and 
subsequently to Strongbow Exploration Inc. (Strongbow). 
 
In February, 2003, Tournigan entered into an option agreement with Strongbow to earn an 
interest of up to 100% in the Curraghinalt deposit, located within a prospecting licence known 
as UM-11/96.  Terms included staged exploration expenditures of $CDN4.0 million over a 
period of seven years and the delivery of a bankable feasibility study, and issuing shares to 
Strongbow at a price based on a 90-day trading average.  At the same time, Tournigan entered 
into a similar option agreement with Strongbow in respect of its "Tyrone project", located 
within prospecting licence UM-12/96.  Tournigan established Dalradian Gold as a wholly-
owned subsidiary through which it would earn its interests in the Curraghinalt (UM-11/96) 
and Tyrone (UM-12/96) properties. 
 
In the following year (February, 2004), Tournigan entered into a letter agreement with 
Strongbow for the outright purchase by Tournigan of all of the issued and outstanding shares 
of Ulster Minerals through the issue of 5 million shares of Tournigan.  The earlier option 
agreements were terminated and replaced by the letter of agreement.  A net smelter royalty of 
2% held by Ennex was transferred to Minco plc.  Full transfer of ownership in Ulster Minerals 
to Tournigan was completed in December, 2004.   



 

 22

 
Tournigan then applied to the licensing authorities, and received licences TG-3 and TG-4 
(both minerals and precious metals), to the northwest of UM-11/96 and UM-12/96. 
 
Ulster Minerals licenses UM-11/96 and UM-12/96 were later renamed UM-1 and UM-2, and 
ultimately DG1 and DG2.  During the renaming and reregistering process the internal 
boundary between DG1 and DG2 was reoriented from east-west to a position which reflects 
the approximate location of the Omagh Thrust Fault (see geological descriptions in Section 7 
and Figure 7.2).  Older maps from previous operators may show the prior internal boundary.  
Details of the current licences and option agreements are provided in Section 4, above. 
 
In October, 2009, Dalradian Resources completed a purchase and sale agreement with 
Tournigan to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Dalradian Gold which 
included the licences, mineral rights and surface rights (including easements) in the Area of 
Interest.  The Area of Interest is defined in the agreement as Mineral Prospecting Licences 
DG1, DG2, TG-3 and TG-4, the latter two being renamed to DG3 and DG4 by DETI after 
acquisition (see Section 4).  As of the time of Micon's second visit in 2009, no exploration 
work had been completed by Dalradian Resources although Aurum (the mineral exploration 
contractor used by Tournigan) had been retained to continue its management of the 
exploration program over DG1 to 4.  During this time Aurum completed a program of data 
compilation and targeting. 
 
6.2 EXPLORATION HISTORY 
 
The exploration history on the property is described by Tully (2005).  Gold was recognized in 
the gravels of the Moyola River in 1652 and in the 1930s, an English company reported plans 
for alluvial gold mining in a prospectus.  The licences comprising the Tyrone project were 
held by others prior to Ennex/Ulster Minerals and a report on the gold potential of the area 
was prepared by the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI).  However, Tully's report 
concentrated on the Curraghinalt gold deposit and his description of the mineral exploration 
history concentrates on the DG1 licence area and the work completed by Ulster Minerals, 
Ennex, Strongbow and Tournigan. 
 
Tully (2005) noted: 
 

"During the period 1971 to 1974 Rio Tinto Finance and Exploration ("Riofinex") carried out 
an exploration program consisting of geological mapping and geophysical and geochemical 
surveys, searching for "porphyry copper" deposits in the Mid-Ordovician Tyrone Volcanic 
belt of rocks.  This work was focused in an area located immediately to the south of the 
Curraghinalt deposit on Exploration License UM 2/02.  The work was followed up with 
drilling of 6 diamond drill holes in the Cashel (Formil) area.  The best intersections were 131 
feet grading 0.17% Cu in drill hole H2, and 151 feet grading 0.12% Cu in hole H4.  Riofinex 
ceased exploration work in the area in 1974. 

 
"Clifford et al. (1990) noted that during the mid-1970s, the Geological Survey of Northern 
Ireland (GSNI) reported on basic geological and geochemical studies that it had conducted in 



 

 23

the area which confirmed the presence of gold in stream gravels over a wide area.  These 
reports also recorded anomalous values in stream sediments of elements that are commonly 
associated with gold. 

 
"On the basis of the above data, Ennex applied for a License in the area in 1980.  This license 
was granted in 1981 and from that date to 1997 Ennex carried out an extensive exploration 
program consisting of geological mapping, prospecting, geochemical and geophysical surveys 
and diamond drilling in both the Tyrone Volcanic Group and the Dalradian Metasediments 
located immediately to the north. 

 
"During 1987 Ennex drilled 25 holes in the Cashel Rock gold deposit (located approximately 
4-km southwest of Formil) which was discovered by deep overburden geochemistry, 
geophysics and trenching.  Gold mineralization is located in silicified rhyolite and is generally 
conformable to the general northwest trending dip of the rhyolite flows.  In general long 
intercepts of very low anomalous gold values were intersected (up to 145 m grading 394 ppb 
Au), with some shorter better grade zones (5.45 m @ 4.3 g/t Au, 6.9 m @ 1.3 g/t Au and 3.63 
m @ 30.6 g/t Au)." 

 
[Tully quotes 25 holes at Cashel Rock, however, examination of old drill records indicates 
that 14 had been completed by 1990.  It is believed that this error is caused by adding in 
drilling by Riofinex at a different location.] 
 

"In addition, Ennex drilled 11 reconnaissance holes in the Tyrone Volcanic rocks and in the 
Dalradian strata.  Some of these holes returned anomalous base or precious metal assays, but 
no definite deposits were intersected. 

 
"In addition to the base metal exploration programs carried out by Ennex on the Tyrone 
Volcanic Group of rocks, they focused on developing and exploring the Curraghinalt deposit, 
which was discovered in 1983.  During the period 1983-1997, Ennex completed 4 major 
drilling programs to explore the Curraghinalt deposit." 

 
The four phases of exploration at Curraghinalt, between 1983 and 1997, are summarized as 
follows: 
 

Phase 1 (1983-July, 1987):  
 

• Detailed prospecting, geochemistry and geophysics. 
• 68 trenches (2,856 m) and 63 diamond drill holes (6,387 m). 

 
Phase 2 (August, 1987-March, 1989): 
 

• Underground development program including development of an adit (412 m), 
lateral drifting (325 m) and raising (60 m).   

• Lateral development utilized a Dosco SL 120 road header. 
 
Phase 3 (May, 1995-March, 1996): 
 



 

 24

• Detailed and reconnaissance drilling to test previously inadequately drilled 
veins. 

• Reconnaissance drilling of veins to the southwest of previously-drilled areas.  
Total 59 holes (4,980 m). 

 
Phase 4 (June, 1996-May, 1997): 
 

• Infill drilling on 25- to 30-m centres in the main vein areas.  Drilling of 50 
holes (5,400 m). 

 
The locations of the drilling and trenching activities carried out by Ennex are shown in 
Figures 6.1 and 6.2. 
 
Between 1997, when Ennex transferred its interest to Nickelodeon, and late-2002, when the 
agreement was signed between Strongbow and Tournigan, little work was done on the 
property.   
 
The Tournigan exploration can be broken into several phases.   
 

Phase 1, 2003 to January, 2005: 
 

• 22,910 soil samples collected. 
• Small geophysical survey conducted. 
• Mapping and prospecting on the DG1 Licence area. 
• 26 diamond drill holes (4,391 m) drilled at Curraghinalt. 
• 7 diamond drill holes drilled at Glenlark. 

 
Phase 2, January, 2005 to 2007: 
 

• 2 diamond drill holes drilled in the area of the Crows Foot-Bend. 
• 24 diamond holes drilled (infill drilling) on the Southeast Extension target. 

 
Phase 3, 2007 to 2009: 
 

• Resource estimate completed by Micon (November 29, 2007). 
• 4 deep diamond drills holes completed  

 
After completion of the 2007 drill program Tournigan ceased all exploration activity at the 
Curraghinalt deposit and, except for some prospecting on TG-3 and TG-4 in 2008, the 
property remained inactive until acquisition by Dalradian Resources in 2009.

Williams (2008) described the exploration history of what is now the DG2 licence area as 
follows: 
 

"Mineral exploration has been completed over the TVG [Tyrone Volcanic Group] in the 1970s 
by Riofinex and Glencar and in the 1980s and 1990s by Ulster Minerals Limited.  This has 
comprised of geological mapping, prospecting, geochemistry, ground magnetic and IP 
surveys, followed by trenching and drilling.  An airborne INPUT was flown by Geoterrex in 
1979 for Moydow Limited.  This exploration has led to the discovery of numerous sub-
economic yet significant gold and base metal occurrences." 

 
The principle target of interest for Ennex on DG2 was the Cashel Rock showing where a 
gold-mineralized silicified rhyolite breccia outcrop is exposed at surface.  At this location 15 
shallow drill holes targeted the zone just below surface.  The results and example sections 
were presented in Hennessey and Mukhopadhyay (2010).  They are not relevant to the 
mineral resource estimate for the Curraghinalt deposit presented in this report and are not 
repeated here. 
 
6.3 HISTORICAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
In May, 1997, a polygonal resource estimate was prepared on behalf of Ennex by CSA.  (See 
CSA 1997).  The estimate was prepared on a minimum mining width of 1.25 m and a cut-off 
grade of 6 g/t Au.  The estimate, referred to as a "polygonal resource calculation" is 
summarized below in Table 6.1.  It is an historical estimate and is provided for information 
purposes only.  It predates, and is not compliant with, NI 43-101 and should not be relied on.

Tully prepared a mineral resource estimate in 2005 and, in 2007, Micon also completed a 
mineral resource estimate on the Curraghinalt deposit for Tournigan (Tully, 2005 and 
Mukhopadhyay, 2007) and again in 2010 for Dalradian Resources (Hennessey and 
Mukhopadhyay May 10, 2010).  The previous Tully and Micon estimates were NI 43-101 
compliant but were not considered to be historic estimates under the previous version of the 
instrument.  While the new instrument (June 30, 2011) allows for the use of estimates made 
prior to an issuer entering into an agreement to acquire a property, the 2007 and 2010 Micon 
estimates have been superseded by the estimate presented herein.  The 2005, 2007 and 2010 



 

 28

estimates can be found on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) filed under Tournigan and Dalradian 
Resources. 
 
6.4 HISTORICAL PRODUCTION 
 
Micon is not aware of any historical mineral production from the Tyrone property other than 
the bulk sample taken from the Ennex adit. 
 
 

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
The geological setting of the Curraghinalt deposit area, as set out below, is adapted from 
Tully (2005). 
 

The geological history of the project area and the immediate surrounding area is related to the 
closing of the Iapetus Ocean in Ordovician time.  This major geological event involved the 
following individual events: 

 
Obduction of oceanic crust (dated at 484 to 480 million years) from the southeast over the 
older Dalradian metamorphic rocks (Hutton 1993; Earls et al. 1996); 

 
Building of a volcanic arc with several volcanic cycles in middle Ordovician time (dated 
at 470 - 464 million years); 

 
Stitching intra-arc tonalites (470 to 466 million years) and younger continental arc 
granites (467 - 464 Ma);  

 
Overthrusting of older Dalradian (Proterozoic and possibly lower Paleozoic) clastic meta-
sedimentary rocks from the northwest (c 470 to 455 million years). 

 
The Oceanic rocks which occur on both sides of the Central Inlier, and to the south of the 
Tyrone Volcanic Group, form what is known as the Tyrone Ophiolite within the Tyrone 
Igneous Complex, and are dominated by gabbros and basic dykes.  The age of these rocks is 
has been recently dated as 484 to 480 million years (Cooper et al. 2010). 

 
The volcanic arc package of rocks, the Tyrone Volcanic Group is considered to be middle 
Ordovician in age (dated at 470 to 464 million years) and forms part of the Tyrone Igneous 
Complex.  The upper part of the volcanics is comprised of bimodal sequences of basaltic and 
andesite to rhyolitic submarine and subaerial lavas, volcaniclastics with chert horizons and 
intercalations of graptolitic shales.  These lithologies are preceded by submarine basaltic 
andesite pillow lavas and associated intrusives. 

 
A series of porphyry bodies and a series of calc-alkaline granitic intrusions intrude the 
volcano-sedimentary sequence.  The history of these units began with the northwest-directed 
obduction of the ophiolite, with its related overlying arc, onto an offshore Proterozoic 
continental fragment (the Tyrone Central Inlier).  During the later stages of this obduction, and 



 

 29

before the arc had become inactive, these amalgamated units collided with and were 
overridden by the Dalradian rocks of the continental margin, causing the c.470 Ma Caledonian 
orogeny in this area.  (Alsop and Hutton, 1993a). 

 
The rocks thrust over the Tyrone Volcanic Group by the Omagh Thrust form part of the 
Dalradian Supergroup.  The Dalradian rocks consist of a metamorphosed clastic sedimentary 
package of biotite to garnet grade semi-pelites, (siltstone) psammites (impure sandstone) and 
chloritic-sericitic pelites (shale).  The younger Dalradian Supergroup clastic sediments of the 
Grampian terrane accumulated in passive-margin rift basins between c.800 Ma and the early 
Cambrian during the breakup of the Late Precambrian supercontinent Rodinia, and the 
formation of the Iapetus Ocean.  The Glengawna Formation contains a distinctive assemblage 
of psammites, talcose schists and graphitic pelites that host the Glenlark gold and base metal 
occurrence.  The Curraghinalt deposit occurs in the Mullaghcarn Formation that is comprised 
of fine grained clastic meta-sedimentary rocks (psammite, semi-pelite and chlorite-rich pelite). 

 
There are many similarities between the Tyrone Volcanic Group rocks and the rocks of the 
Appalachian Mountains, Atlantic Canada, Ireland, Scotland and Scandinavia.  The rocks in 
these areas were part of the continuous Appalachian-Caledonian Orogen, prior to the opening 
of the Atlantic Ocean basin in middle Mesozoic time.  It is postulated that the Bathurst, New 
Brunswick area rocks (Tetagouch Group) are correlative with rocks in southern Ireland 
(Avoca, in County Wicklow), whereas the Tyrone area Ordovician rocks are more closely 
related to those at Buchans, Newfoundland.  Similarly, it is postulated that late Proterozoic 
and early to late Cambrian sediments present on the Great Northern and Baie Verte peninsulas 
of Newfoundland are analogous to that of the Dalradian in Northern Ireland.

7.2.1 Curraghinalt Gold Deposit Area - Licence DG1 
 
Williams and Archibald (2009) described the geology of the DG1 licence areas as follows: 

 
7.2.1.1 Stratigraphy 
 

"The rocks underlying the licence area belong to the Central Highland (Grampian) Terrane, 
and consist of mid- to late-Neo-proterozoic rocks of the Dalradian Supergroup and a small 
area of unconformable Lower Carboniferous sandstone.  The Dalradian Supergroup is 
composed of a thick sequence of clastic marine sediments, with minor volcanic units, 
deposited in a rift basin, and can be correlated with successions in Scotland (Highlands), 
Republic of Ireland (Cos. Donegal, Mayo and Galway) and perhaps the Fleur de Lys 
Supergroup in Newfoundland (Kennedy, 1975) and the Eleonore Bay Supergroup in eastern 
Greenland (Soper, 1994). 
 
"The Dalradian Supergroup is divided into four groups, i.e., Grampian, Appin, Argyll and 
Southern Highland [Table 7.1], of which only the Argyll and Southern Highland groups are 
present in Northern Ireland (Strachan et al. 2002).  The rocks in the Argyll Group indicate a 
change in tectonic and depositional environment, varying from a relatively stable shelf 
environment (Easdale and Crinan subgroups) to a floundered shelf environment associated 
basaltic magmatism (Tayvallich Subgroup) caused by the crustal thinning and stretching prior 
to the opening of the Iapetus Ocean.  Erosion and reworking of the basic igneous rocks formed 
contemporaneous volcaniclastic sediments (green beds) present in the upper part of the Argyll 
Group and the lower part of the Southern Highland Group.  The Southern Highland Group 
formed in an unstable shelf environment and, as such, has developed turbidite facies.  These 
vary from coarse-grained proximal arenites (conglomerates) to fine-grained outer fan pelites 
(shales).   
 
"All of the Dalradian Supergroup lithologies were deformed during the Grampian Orogeny, 
and now lie on the inverted southern limb of the Sperrins Nappe.  The dominant structural 
feature in the licence area an isoclinal F2 anticline, plunging to the northeast, which has been 
refolded to form a northwest plunging anticline.  
 
"Based on information from adjacent areas it is certain that the Dalradian Supergroup rocks 
were covered in younger lithologies.  However, the only evidence for the presence of these 
units in the licence area are a sandstone-dominated Lower Carboniferous basin that is present 
3 km to the north of Newtownstewart and 3 km to the east of Gortin, and another basin at the 
extreme south of the licence."

Southern Highland Group 
 
"In the south Sperrin Mountains the Southern Highland Group is composed of four 
formations; Dart, Glenelly, Glengawna and Mullaghcarn.  The Glenelly and Glengawna 
formations are equivalent to the Ballykelly Formation in the north Sperrin Mountains.  
Dominant lithologies within these formations are psammites, semi-pelites, pelites and 
amphibole schists.   

 
Glenelly Formation 
 
"The Glenelly Formation outcrops between 4 km northeast and southwest of Gortin and 
comprises of four mappable members, i.e., Oughtboy Burn, Clogherny, Golan Burn and the 
Garvagh Bridge.  The Oughtboy Burn Member is composed of approximately 70 m of dark 
green, chlorite- and biotite-rich volcaniclastics semipelite (green bed) with abundant feldspar 
(albite) porphyroblasts.  The overlying Clogherny Member is a calcareous, pale-green to white 
tourmaline-rich schistose semipelite.  Medium- to coarse-grained psammite also comprises 
this member.  A similar lithology is encountered in the overlying Golan Burn Member, except 
tourmaline is less abundant, and it contains thin beds of impure meta-limestone.  The Garvagh 
Bridge Member is composed of fine- to medium-grained, pale grey, calcareous semipelite 
schist, and thin bedded meta-limestones.  The calcareous units represent basin shallowing 
during periods of deeper water sedimentation (Cooper and Johnston, 2004). 
 
Glengawna Formation 
 
"The formation is approximately 400 m thick and comprises a distinctive association of 
graphitic pelites, semi-pelites, chloritic semi-pelites and psammites.  These lithologies contrast 
markedly with the silvery-grey lithologies of the underlying Glenelly Formation. 
 
Mullaghcarn Formation 
 
"The formation is only present in the extreme southeast and south of the licence area, and it 
consists of psammite, semi-pelite, chloritic-semipelite and pelite schists.  Garnets are 



 

 34

sometimes present, and may be replaced by chlorite or hematite.  Bedding is difficult to 
recognise, but it is generally acknowledged that the formation is overturned.  The Mullaghcarn 
is economically significant, since both the Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw gold deposits are 
hosted in this formation." 

 
Tully (2005), whose report concentrated on the Curraghinalt gold deposit, describes the 
geology of the deposit area as follows: 
 

"The Curraghinalt deposit is located 3-km to the north of the northeast-southwest striking 
Omagh Thrust Fault.  This major fault has thrust Dalradian Supergroup rocks from the 
northwest over Tyrone Volcanic Group rocks located to the south.  The Dalradian 
metasediments on the northern side of the thrust strike NE-SW and dip to the northwest.  The 
lithologies are interpreted to lie on the lower limb of a gently to moderately northwest-dipping 
southeast upward-facing, major recumbent overturned tight isoclinal fold.  This fold is 
referred to as either the Sperrins Overfold or the Sperrins Nappe. 

 
"The Dalradian stratigraphy in the license area is inverted, occupying the lower limb of the 
overturned Sperrins Nappe.  The Dalradian Formations present in the area from the southeast 
(at the Omagh Thrust) to the northwest are, from the youngest to the oldest, the Mullaghcarn, 
Glengawna and Glenelly Formations.  The Mullaghcarn Formation, which hosts the 
Curraghinalt deposit, consists of mixed semi-pelites, quartz semi-pelites and psammites.  The 
Glengawna Formation comprises a mixed package of graphitic pelites, graphitic semi-pelites, 
chloritic semi-pelites and minor psammites.  Furthest north is the Glenelly Formation, which 
is comprised of pelites, semi-pelites and quartz semi-pelites." 

 
7.2.1.2 Structure 
 

"The structures in the immediate area of the Curraghinalt area have been described in detail by 
M. Boland (1997) and are summarized as follows: 

 
"The Curraghinalt deposit consists of a WNW trending vein swarm.  The veins are controlled 
by a series of high-angled, east-west trending shears that are interpreted to represent 
hangingwall accommodation structures caused by a ramp in the footwall of the Omagh Thrust.  
(Earls and al. 1996 [sic]).  These structures are expressed geophysically as strong Fraser 
filtered VLF-EM linears.  The shears are vertical to northerly steep dipping structures, which 
dextrally offset the veins. 

 
"The veins are also offset sinisterly [sic] by ENE to NNE trending normal faults that dip to the 
NW and with general displacements of approximately 10 metres.  Low angle, north-dipping 
thrust faults are also evident in the main access adit." 

 
In 2007 the operators retained Dave Coller, P.Geo., Euro.Geol., a structural and economic 
geological consultant, to prepare an initial review of the Curraghinalt vein system.  See Coller 
(2007).  Coller concluded: 
 

"An overall model is suggested for a shallow east plunging system with steep west pitching 
ore shoots.  The implication is that the SE Extension represents a higher structural level in the 
system than the Central Resource area such that similar grade and thickness veins are 
predicted at moderate depths below the SE Extension."

Extension, and the relative locations of the principal identified mineralized veins on level 170.

Coller undertook a detailed interpretation of the vein geometry for two levels in the Central 
Resource Area, level 170 and level 220, which are 170 m and 220 masl, respectively.  Coller 
also provided an interpretation for the entire system on level 170. 
 
Coller tabulated the types of veins and their characteristics by means of the definitions in 
Table 7.2.

7.2.1.3 Central Resource Area 
 
For the Central Resource Area Coller noted: 
 

"Most of the large high grade veins in the Central Resource Area are relatively distinct vein 
zones, with a few simple high grade branches and sometimes en echelon segments.  The No 1 
Vein Complex is more complex and develops multiple branches in the eastern part of the 
Central Resource Area. 

 
1. Grade is very variable within each of the vein complexes but is consistently over 5 gpt 
for almost all the complexes and branches (on both compiled levels …).  The exception is the 
western part of T17 at the lower 220 level. 

 
2. Over the 300-350 m strike length of the Central Resource Area, all of the vein 
complexes have three or more very high grade segments >25gpt [grams per tonne].  In the 
case of No 1 and 106-16 these segments are steep plunging (comparing levels) with a westerly 
pitch ….  T17 has the thickest and most continuous high grade segment within which there are 
two very high grade segments of >50gpt. 

 
3. Most of the branches within the vein complexes are high grade and of significant 
thickness to be included in a resource.  No 1 complex has two main branches at the lower level 
which may separate at the higher level. 

 
4. The main veins (and complexes) have varying dips to the north.  The T17 has steep 
dipping segments of around 70 N although the eastern part of the vein dips more moderately at 
55 N.  The No 1 complex is generally moderately dipping between 40 and 50 N, whilst the 
average dip of most of the other veins is around 55-60 N." 

 
For the other areas Coller made the following observations. 
 



 

 37

7.2.1.4 Southeast Extension 
 

"A 500m strike length of drilling has defined a high density of high-grade veins which are 
clearly continuations of the main Vein Complexes defined in the Central Resource Area … 
and which represent a significant Au resource.  The main interpretation of the vein geometry 
showing the high grade distribution and probable linkage of the veins is taken from the 170 
level.  The other levels have less information but could be worked up for some parts of the SE 
[Extension]. 

 
1 The Vein No 1 and Vein 106-16 complexes develop as multi-branch systems with en 
echelon, but linked, thick high grade vein segments. ...  These two vein complexes essentially 
merge on 170 level.   

 
2. The high grade segments (>11gpt) of all the vein complexes appears to continue as far 
east as the current drilling and hence is presumed to continue further. 

 
3. The principal vein T17 appears to be a very straight vein with three or four high grade 
segments, thickening to the east. 

 
4. The Crows Foot Vein complex in the southern part of the system appears now from 
the compilation to be an E-W vein system with multi-branches, several of high grade.  This 
vein complex is parallel to the Kiln Shear.  This may be a very significant vein complex which 
is untested." 

 
7.2.1.5 Attagh Burn Vein Complex 
 

"The Attagh Burn drilling west of the Central Resource Area is now interpreted as a wide 
complex of veins with the same WNW strike as those in the Central Resource Area.  Within 
the complex there are 3-5 high grade parallel veins or branches.  This complex of veins may 
be bounded to the south by a continuation of the Kiln Shear.  However, displacements on the 
Kiln Shear do not appear to be very significant even in the Central Resource Area so the 
Attagh Burn veins may be present south of the shear." 

 
7.2.1.6 Northern Area Veins 
 

"Three significant high grade veins have been discovered in the Northern Area, immediately 
north of the Central Resource Area.  These veins are not well drill tested although the Mullen 
Vein appears to have a strike-length of at least 700 m and has three high grade segments and 
several branches similar to the main vein complexes.  The Sheep Dip Vein has a significant 
high grade segment and at least one main branch and dips [at] around 75-85N than the other 
veins. 

 
"The Road Vein is essentially untested with one relatively deep level intersection in 04CT 26 
of 1.2m @ 29 gpt." 

 
Coller concluded:  
 

"The consistent geometry and pattern to all three of these features links both the vein 
branching, the thickness variations and the high grade shoots in a kinematic way that relates to 



 

 38

the genesis of the system.  The common westerly pitching vector to the system is almost 
certainly related to the syn-kinematic 'fault' control.  At this stage the interpretation is 
consistent with a movement direction which is normal to the vein i.e. north block up dip to the 
west (compressional) as suggested by the geometry of the rolls in plan and consistent with the 
larger scale en echelon vein style and relay branching (above) which is left lateral." 

 
The vein system and controlling structures of the Curraghinalt gold deposit are interpreted to 
strike to west-northwest towards, and possibly onto, the DG3 licence and southwest corner of 
the DG4 licence as seen in Figure 7.2. 
 
7.2.2 Licence DG2 - Tyrone Volcanic Group 
 
Williams and Archibald (personal communication via e-mail, December, 2009) provides the 
following description of the Tyrone Volcanic Group rocks on licence DG2. 
 

"The Tyrone Volcanic Group (TVG) is located to the SE of the Dalradian metasediments and 
is Ordovician in age.  It is structurally demarcated on the southeast by the much older Pre-
Cambrian Complex of the Central Metamorphic Inlier and further to the northeast by an 
ophiolite suite.  On the northwest side the Ordovician has been overthrust by the Dalradian, 
late Pre-Cambrian to early Palaeozoic, metasedimentary rocks on the Omagh Thrust.  The 
thrust dips northwest at a moderate dip.  Both ends of the northeasterly striking Ordovician 
belt are covered by younger, Devonian, Old Red Sandstone and the Lower Carboniferous. 
 
"Work by Earls (1987) suggests the presence of three island arc volcanic cycles favourable for 
VMS [volcanogenic massive sulphide] deposits, adjacent to the back arc basal ophiolites, 
within the TVG.  These cycles are designated from top to bottom as follows: 
 

Cycle 3.  Broughderg Formation 
 

Cycle 2.  Bonnety Bush - Glencurry Formation 
 

Cycle 1.  Dungate - Tanderagee Formation 
 
"The top of each formation is marked by an erratic increase in volumetrically minor chert or 
ironstone, which is taken to represent the culmination of a cycle.  The cherts are variably 
magnetic and discontinuous and occur at several horizons.  For this reason, and their relatively 
shallow dip to the northwest, the cherts are difficult to trace on the magnetic surveys.  The 
cherts assigned to the two lowermost cycles are jasperoid, indicative of an oxidizing 
environment, whereas the Cycle 3 cherts are grey to black suggesting reducing depositional 
conditions.  Each sequence progresses from mafic to more felsic upwards. 
 
"Basaltic flows are common in the lowermost parts of the Cycle 1, Dungate-Tanderagee 
Formation.  East of the Dungate Fault the top of the cycle, fairly well marked by cherty zones 
within the volcanics lies close to extensive ophiolite suite rocks to the southeast.  West of the 
Dungate Fault the Cycle 1 volcanic sequence is much thicker, with some suggestion of 
ophiolite suite rocks along its contact with the older Metamorphic Inlier. 
 
"The Cycle 2, Bonnety Bush-Glencurry Formation hosts major quartz porphyry intrusions 
towards the central part of the TVG.  These porphyry intrusions are, in all likelihood, the 



 

 39

feeders for the rhyolites occurring stratigraphically above at the top of Cycle 2.  The 
intervening tonalites dilate the section and for present purposes may be imagined as being 
removed to bring the quartz porphyry intrusions closer to their original stratigraphic proximity 
to the rhyolites. 
 
"The Cycle 3, Broughderg Formation has lesser rhyolite development than the underlying 
formation, but the ratio of mafic to felsic flows and tuffs is less than in the preceding 
formations.  Black argillite occurs in the upper part of the formation and associated weakly 
auriferous cherts.  The top of the formation is overridden by the Omagh Thrust." 

 
Williams (2008) also notes the similarities between the Tyrone Volcanic Group and 
lithologies in Scandinavia and eastern Canada and their potential to host VMS style 
mineralization: 
 

"The Tyrone Volcanic Group can be roughly correlated with similar volcanic packages in 
Québec, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and the Scandinavian Caledonides.  Similar aged 
rocks in all four widely separated areas contain significant VMS deposits.  Of these, the most 
significant are the numerous large deposits of the Bathurst District in New Brunswick (Luff 
1995), and probably the famous Buchans deposits of Newfoundland (Swinden 1991; Thurlow 
and Swanson 1981).  The latter have in the past been considered to be slightly younger, (Kean 
et al. 1981; Thurlow 1981; Bell and Blenkinsop 1981), but subsequent information (Nowlan 
and Thurlow 1984; Swinden 1990; Williams 1995, page 151) has shown them to be most 
likely time-correlative with the Bathurst area deposits.  Other deposits of roughly similar age 
include several in the Eastern Townships of Québec (Trottier and Gauthier 1991; Gauthier 
1995) and a number in the Trondheim district of Norway (Stephens et al. 1984).  There are 
many similarities between the Tyrone Volcanic Group rocks and those in these other regions.  
Such correlation is not unreasonable, because the rocks of the Appalachian Mountains, 
Atlantic Canada, Ireland, Scotland and Scandinavia were part of the continuous Appalachian-
Caledonian Orogen prior to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean basin in middle Mesozoic time 
(see, e.g., Stephens et al. 1984; Williams 1984; Williams et al. 1992)."  [See Figure 7.4.] 
 
"More recent work (van der Pluijm et al. 1995) has suggested that the volcanic belts are parts 
of several island arcs related to separate subduction zones in the Iapetus Ocean.  It may well 
be that the Bathurst area rocks (Tetagouche Group) are correlative with rocks in southern 
Ireland (e.g. those at Avoca, in Co. Wicklow, Republic of Ireland) whereas the Tyrone area 
Ordovician rocks are more closely related to those at Buchans, Newfoundland."

After Archibald (2009). 

 
Ongoing work by Hollis (personal communication to G. Earls, 2011) has updated and revised 
much of the volcanic stratigraphy of the Tyrone Volcanic Group and has allowed a detailed 
chronostratigraphic framework of the evolution of the Tyrone Igneous Complex to be 
established.  Hollis has interpreted the Tyrone Volcanic Group as forming at the same time as 
the Annieopsquotch terrane in Newfoundland that is host to the Buchans deposits.  In addition 
Hollis has recognized a common geological history between the Tyrone Volcanic Group and 
the Annieopsquotch terranes. 
 
7.2.3 DG3 and DG4 Licences 
 
7.2.3.1 Stratigraphy 
 
Williams and Archibald (2009) described the geology of the DG3 and DG4 licence areas as 
the same as that presented for licence DG1 in Section 7.2.1.1 above. 
 
The Dalradian Supergroup is divided into four groups, i.e., Grampian, Appin, Argyll and 
Southern Highland (see Table 7.1), of which only the Argyll and Southern Highland groups 
are present in Northern Ireland.  Detailed descriptions are provided below (Williams and 
Archibald 2009). 
 

Argyll Group: Crinan Subgroup 
 
"The oldest rocks present in DG3 licence are psammites and pelites belonging to the 
Newtownstewart Formation.  The Newtownstewart Formation is the equivalent of the Killeter 

Nova Scotia 
Ireland 

UK 

Newfoundland

New Brunswick 



 

 41

Quartzite Formation.  Both formations belong to the Easdale Subgroup.  [G. Earls reports that 
they are part of the Crinan Subgroup, personal communication, 2012.] 
 
Newtownstewart Formation 
 
"The Newtownstewart Formation is present in the south-western and north-eastern part of the 
licence area (immediately south of Newtownstewart, and 3 km east of Strabane) and is 
exposed in the core of a recumbent F2 fold.  The formation is composed of fine-grained, pale 
grey quartzose psammites in beds approximately 50 cm thick, and is interbedded with thin 
pelite units.  Occasionally the formation shows graded pebbly beds.  Since the base of the unit 
is not observed the exact thickness is unknown, but it is probably similar to the Killeter 
Quartzite Formation, i.e., ~1000 m.  
 
Argyll Group: Tayvallich Subgroup 
 
"The Tayvallich Subgroup overlies the Crinan Subgroup and is characterised by two 
contrasting rock types; limestones and pillowed basalts.  Local names for the Tayvallich 
Subgroup in Northern Ireland include Aghyaran Formation (South and Central Donegal), 
Dungiven Formation (Counties Londonderry and Tyrone) and the Torr Head Limestone 
Formation (Co. Antrim).  In the DG3 licence the Dungiven Limestone Formation is used to 
describe the Tayvallich Subgroup. 
 
Dungiven Limestone Formation 
 
"The Dungiven Limestone Formation is present throughout most of the licence, and it attains a 
maximum extent at Strabane where it is present in the nose of a northwest plunging anticline.  
Meta-limestone is the dominant lithology, and is associated with pelite, semi-pelite, psammite, 
quartzite, basaltic pillow lava and volcaniclastic sediments.  The best exposure of this unit is 5 
km north of Plumbridge on the eastern flanks of Butterlope Glen (GR 249300; 394700).  
Basaltic pillow lavas occur at several localities, with individual pillows up to 1 m in diameter, 
and consisting of fine-grained, equigranular metabasalts.  Volcanic textures such as triple 
junction chilled margins, gas vesicles and radial fracture patterns are all present.  Meta-
limestones are the dominant lithology at the contact with the Newtownstewart Formation and 
the overlying Claudy/Dart Formation.  The limestone varies in texture from pale saccharoidal 
to dark crystalline and thickness from a few centimetres to several metres.  The sequence has 
been extensively intruded by metabasite sills, and these are probably conduits to more 
extensive pillow lavas elsewhere in the Tayvallich Subgroup. 
 
Southern Highland Group 
 
"Three formations belong to the Southern Highland Group in the north Sperrin Mountains; 
Claudy, Ballykelly, and Londonderry formations.  In the south Sperrin Mountains the South 
Highland Group is composed of four formations; Dart, Glenelly, Glengawna and Mullaghcarn.  
The Glenelly and Glengawna formations are equivalent to the Ballykelly Formation in the 
north Sperrin Mountains.  Dominant lithologies within these formations are psammites, semi-
pelites, pelites and amphibole schists.  All of the south Sperrin Mountain formations are 
present in the DG3 licence, whereas the Claudy Formation is the only north Sperrin Mountain 
Formation present.  
 



 

 42

Claudy Formation 
 
"The Claudy Formation is present in the northern part of the licence area; to the north of 
Strabane [Figure 5.1].  The formation has a variable thickness, ranging from 750 to 2000 m, 
and is predominantly composed of coarse-grained quartzo-feldspathic psammite with graded 
bedding.  The quartzo-feldspathic psammite contains coarse grains of blue and white quartz 
and pink and white feldspar.  Beds within the psammite units can attain thickness up to 1 m, 
alternating with silvery grey phyllitic semipelite and rare greyish-black phyllitic pelite.  The 
presence of biotite porphyroblasts, rare garnets, and chlorite indicate upper greenschist facies 
metamorphism.  Two limestone units within the Claudy Formation are important marker units.  
These units are termed the Alla Glen Limestone Member and the Bonds Glen Limestone 
Member.  The Alla Glen Limestone Member is pale grey to greyish blue, coarsely crystalline 
and forms units up to 1 m in thickness.  Individual units are separated by black graphitic 
semipelite and pelite.  The Bonds Glen Limestone Member is pale to dark bluish grey, 
medium- to coarse-grained, in beds up to 0.75 m in thickness.  The beds are separated by dark 
grey to black pelite that is often pyrite-bearing. 
 
Dart Formation 
 
"The Dart Formation is present in the south-eastern quadrant of the licence area.  The base of 
the formation is composed Glenga Amphibolite Member, which is interpreted as a re-
sedimented volcaniclastic siltstone and sandstone.  Other lithologies within the formation 
include quartz pebble conglomerate, psammite displaying graded bedding, semipelite and the 
Henry's Bridge Member.  The Henry's Bridge Member is between 30 to 50 m in thickness and 
is composed of a dark greenish brown, chlorite-rich volcaniclastic semipelite and is interpreted 
to record erosion of underlying volcanics, but may also result from contemporaneous 
volcanism in the hinterland (Strachan et al., 2002).  Throughout the Dalradian volcaniclastic 
semipelites are known as "Green Beds". 
 
Glenelly Formation 
 
"The Glenelly Formation outcrops between 4 km northeast and southwest of Gortin and 
comprises of four mappable members, i.e., Oughtboy Burn, Clogherny, Golan Burn and the 
Garvagh Bridge.  The Oughtboy Burn Member is composed of approximately 70 m of dark 
green, chlorite- and biotite-rich volcaniclastics semipelite (green bed) with abundant feldspar 
(albite) porphyroblasts.  The overlying Clogherny Member is a calcareous, pale-green to white 
tourmaline-rich schistose semipelite.  Medium- to coarse-grained psammite also comprises 
this member.  A similar lithology is encountered in the overlying Golan Burn Member, except 
tourmaline is less abundant, and it contains thin beds of impure meta-limestone.  The Garvagh 
Bridge Member is composed of fine- to medium-grained, pale grey, calcareous semipelite 
schist, and thin bedded meta-limestones.  The calcareous units represent basin shallowing 
during periods of deeper water sedimentation (Cooper and Johnstone, 2004).

Glengawna Formation 
 
"The Glengawna Formation is restricted to the southeast of the DG3 licence area, forming the 
low ground in the Gortin Glen Forest Park (GR 249000 381000).  The formation is 
approximately 400 m thick and comprises a distinctive association of graphitic pelites, semi-
pelites, chloritic semi-pelites and psammites.  These lithologies contrast markedly with the 
silvery-grey lithologies of the underlying Glenelly Formation. 
 
Mullaghcarn Formation 
 
"The formation is only present in the extreme southeast and south of the licence area, and it 
consists of psammite, semi-pelite, chloritic-semipelite and pelite schists.  Garnets are 
sometimes present, and are usually replaced by chlorite or hematite.  Bedding is difficult to 
recognise, but it is generally acknowledged that the formation is overturned.  The Mullaghcarn 
is economically significant, since both the Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw gold deposits are 
hosted in this formation. 
 
Carboniferous: Late Courceyan and Early Chadian 
 
"Two Carboniferous basins are present within the licence area.  In the south, the Omagh 
Sandstone Group represents strata deposited prior to, and during, and marine transgression, 
whereas in the north the Owenkillew Sandstone Group in the Newtownstewart Outlier 
represents non-marine strata. 
 
Omagh Sandstone Group 
 
"The Omagh Sandstone Group rests unconformably on the Dalradian.  The basal unit is up to 
100 m thick and is composed of non-fossiliferous red sandstone with calcrete nodules, and 
quartz pebble conglomerates (Mitchell, 2004).  Much of the remaining sequence is dominated 
by channel sandstone and siltstone that contain Courceyan to early Chadian miopores.  
However, thin algal limestones with evaporite replacement textures occur locally.  Some of 
the limestones contain rare brachiopods.  The exact thickness of this group is difficult to 
estimate based on the amount of uplift, folding, and erosion that has taken place. 
 
Owenkillew Sandstone Group 
 
"The Owenkillew Sandstone Group rests unconformably on the Dalradian and comprises of 
approximately 1500 m of predominantly non-marine strata present within a half graben.  
Lithologies include greenish grey and purplish red sandstone and siltstone, with thin beds of 
algal laminated limestone (Mitchell, 2004).  Mudstones containing miospores have indicated 
an early Chadian age.  The group is thought to have formed in an inter-cratonic basin with 
current indicators suggesting the sediment source to the north." 

 
7.2.3.2 Structural History and Setting of Gold Mineralization 
 
Williams (2009) described the structural history and setting of gold mineralization on the 
DG3 and DG4 licence areas as follows: 
 



 

 44

"Known gold deposits within the Dalradian Supergroup, e.g., Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw, lie 
on the inverted, gently to moderately northwest-dipping, limb of a southeast facing, major 
overturned tight to isoclinal fold (Alsop and Hutton; 1993a, 1993b).  This fold is known as the 
Sperrin Fold in the Sperrin Mountains, the Altmore Anticline in northeast Co. Antrim (Alsop 
and Hutton, 1993a; Cooper and Johnston, 2004).  All of these structures are analogous to the 
Tay Nappe in Scotland, that formed as a result of D2 flattening, tightening and extension of an 
earlier D1 anticline (Stephenson and Gould, 1995; Strachan et al., 2002).  Deformation 
resulted in lower greenschist facies in the north (Co. Donegal) to lower amphibolite facies 
metamorphism close to the Omagh Thrust.  D3 deformation in the south Sperrin Mountains 
resulted in a south-easterly-verging minor folds and low angle, northwards inclined thrust 
surfaces, i.e., the Omagh Thrust Fault, which transported Dalradian rocks over the early 
Ordovician Tyrone Igneous Complex (Alsop and Hutton, 1993a).  The dominant D3 structural 
feature in west County Tyrone is the Ballybofey Nappe, which is a sub-recumbent structure 
that closes and faces towards the southeast and is displaced by several Caledonian faults 
(Alsop, 1991). 
 
"Auriferous quartz-carbonate veins occur throughout the Dalradian Supergroup, with the 
majority (e.g., Curraghinalt, Golan Burn, Cavanacaw) present close to the Omagh Thrust, 
where the Dalradian rocks have been overthrust to the southeast over the Tyrone Igneous 
Complex.  The presence of this terrane boundary obviously plays a significant role in the 
formation of economic mineralization.  Gold tends to occur as electrum, gold-bearing hessite 
(Ag2Te) and as substitutions in pyrite.  Associated sulphides in the veins include pyrite, 
chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, tennantite, galena and sphalerite.  Gangue minerals are quartz, 
calcite, dolomite, siderite, orthoclase and rare barite.  All veins are steeply dipping, but their 
strike varies from north-south at Cavanacaw in the west, to west-northwest in the east at 
Curraghinalt." 

 
A simplified geological map showing the relationship of the major units of the Dalradian 
Metasediments, Tyrone Volcanic Group, Central Inlier and the Tyrone Plutonic group can be 
seen in Figure 7.5. 
 
7.3 MINERALIZATION 
 
7.3.1 The Curraghinalt deposit 
 
The mineralization at the Curraghinalt gold deposit is described by Tully (2005) as follows: 
 

"Mineralogically the veins are composed of quartz with carbonate on late cross veins.  Pyrite 
and chalcopyrite are the dominant sulphides with accessory tennantite and tetrahedrite plus 
rare arsenopyrite, galena and molybdenite.  Three styles of sulphide mineralization are evident 
at Curraghinalt; (i) euhedral pyrite crystals with chalcopyrite occur in white quartz, filling 
vugs or along micro-fractures, (ii) grey pyritic quartz forms the matrix to brecciated white 
quartz, and (iii) massive pyrite.

"The variations in the sulphide content are dependent on the volume of space created by 
movements on the E-W shears.  The massive sulphide mineralization present at the eastern 
end of the T17HW drift [Ennex underground exploration program] is due to its position 
adjacent to the Kiln Shear.  On the No. 1 Vein, drill holes 106-16, 90-12, 90-14 and 90-43 
exhibit increased mineralization close to the Kiln Shear.  Zones of grey pyritic quartz breccia 
commonly occur along the hangingwall contact of the veins.  This is evident in the No. 1 drift.  
The veins have sharp margins with no mineralization in the country rock.  Sericitization and 
minor chloritization occurs in the hangingwall and footwall of some of the veins, but it is not 
consistently present." 

 
The gold at Curraghinalt occurs in three forms: 
 

• As inclusions within pyrite, remote from fractures. 
• Within fractures in pyrite. 
• As gold-bearing tellurides. 

 
Four stages of quartz deposition (Q1 through Q4) were recognized, with gold mineralization 
associated with the second and fourth stages, as described by Tully (2005): 
 

"Q1 represents the initial phase of vein formation and has an opaque, milky white appearance.  
No sulphides are present, and it is interpreted that the quartz precipitated from a metamorphic 
fluid at greenschist facies temperature. 

 
Q2 is a re-activation phase of the vein system.  This resulted in intense brecciation of the 
existing quartz (Q1), cementation by new quartz (Q2) and the development of significant 
porosity of the veins.  Q2 is recognized by its grey, translucent appearance and its breccia 
cement texture.  Textural relationships indicate that Q2 was synchronous with the main phase 
of sulphide mineralization.  Fluid inclusion and staple isotope geochemical studies have 
indicated that Q2 was precipitated from a magmatic fluid or from a fluid with a significant 
magmatic component. 

 
Q3 is limited in occurrence to the larger, most intensely mineralized veins.  It can be 
recognized in hand specimens as coarse, transparent euhedral crystals.  The Q3 fluid is 
interpreted to represent evolved surface-derived water. 

 
Q4 is only common in the thickest mineralized veins.  It occurs as cement to 
anhedral/brecciated aggregates of pyrite and as thin syntaxial overgrowths on euhedral 
crystals.  Q4 is synchronous with the late generation of sulphide and electrum mineralization 
infilling fractures in pyrite.  Studies indicate that Q4 was precipitated from basinal brine." 

 
The following description of the vein system at Curraghinalt is reproduced from Tully (2005) 
who references Boland (1997). 
 

"The quartz veins form a series of sub-parallel structures, which crosscut the Dalradian 
metasediments with a general strike of 090º - 135º, and dip at 55º - 77º to the north.  They 
bifurcate, splay, and pinch and swell along strike and down dip and vary in thickness from less 



 

 47

than 5cm to greater than 2 m.  The veins are well developed in the semi-pelites and psammites 
but have poor continuity in the package of ductile pelites and chloritic semi-pelites." 
 

The vein swarm has been traced along strike for approximately 1,950 m, across strike for 
approximately 600 m and down dip for approximately 800 m by prospecting, trenching and 
drilling.  Ten 'main' veins are included in the current resource estimate.  These are: 
 

1. Road 
2. Sheep Dip 
3. Mullan 
4. T17 
5. No. 1 
6. 106-16 
7. V75 
8. Bend 
9. Crow 
10. Attagh Bridge Burn 

 
A brief description of the veins discovered to date is as follows: 
 
Road Vein - The Road vein was encountered initially in a trench and subsequently by drilling 
and underground development.  It has been traced by drilling over an approximate 500 m 
strike length and to a depth of approximately 300 m below surface.  The vein remains open to 
depth and to the east and west. 
 
Sheep Dip Vein - The vein lies approximately 60 m south of the Road vein and has been 
accessed by a short drift from underground, near the portal of the adit and has a defined strike 
length of 200 m.  The vein strikes 110º to 115º and dips between 60º to 65º to the north.  It has 
been traced along strike for approximately 500 m and to a depth of approximately 300 m.  
The vein remains open to depth and to the east and west. 
 
Mullan Vein - The vein occurs approximately 70 m south of the Sheep Dip vein and has an 
interpreted minimum strike length of approximately 1,050 m.  Drilling has intercepted the 
vein at approximately 440 m below surface and it has a similar strike and dip to the Sheep Dip 
vein.  The Mullan Vein is not well developed at the elevation of the adit, but remains open 
along strike and down dip. 
 
T17 Vein - The vein is located on both the southern and northern sides of the Kiln Shear, 
approximately 100 m south of the Mullan Vein.  It intersects the east-west trending Kiln 
Shear where it is visible in the T17 drift.  The vein strikes west-northwest and dips 60º to 65º 
to the north.  It is interpreted to have a minimum strike length of about 1,400 m and has been 
delineated by 200 m of drifting.  Drilling has tested the vein to an elevation of -350 m (c. 570 
m below surface).  The vein is well developed, with good continuity in the semi-pelitic 
lithologies, which were intersected in the eastern 110 m of the T17 drift.  The vein is offset by 
1 to 2 m in a number of places by northeast-trending cross faults.  West of 256980E the 



 

 48

lithology is dominantly a pelite and the vein is less well developed.  The vein remains open to 
depth and to the east and west. 
 
No. 1 Vein - The vein is located 90 m south of T17 Vein and strikes 110º to 115º and dips 
between 60º to 65º to the north.  It has been tested by several trenches, numerous drill holes 
and 95 m of drift, plus one raise.  The vein has been interpreted along strike for approximately 
1,100 m and down dip for some 680 m.  The vein remains open to depth and along strike to 
the east and west. 
 
106-16 Vein - The vein is located approximately 80 m south of the No. 1 Vein.  It strikes 110º 
to 115º and has a variable dip of between 50º to 65º north.  The vein has been interpreted for a 
length of approximately 1,300 m along strike, and to a depth of approximately 710 m below 
surface.  The vein remains open to depth and to the east and west." 
 
V75 Vein - The vein is located approximately 60 m south of the 106-16 vein and strikes 110º 
to 115º and has a variable dip of between 50º to 65º north.  It has only been encountered in 
drill holes and has been correlated over an interpreted strike length of 1,100 m and traced 
down dip for approximately 760 m.  The vein remains open to depth and to the east and west. 
 
Bend Vein - The Bend vein is located approximately 60 m to the south of the V75 vein and 
has been interpreted over a strike length of approximately 1,100 m and down dip for 
approximately 800 m through trenching and drilling.  The vein remains open to depth and to 
the east and west. 
 
Crow Vein - The Crow vein is located approximately 70 m to the south of the Bend vein and 
has been interpreted over a strike length of approximately 1,100 m and down dip for 
approximately 840 m through trenching and drilling.  The vein remains open to depth and to 
the east and west. 
 
Attagh Burn Bridge Vein (ABB) - This is the westernmost vein drill tested within the 
deposit.  The vein may represent the western extension of the 106-16 Vein, an offset of the 
No. 1 Vein, or is a separate entity.  It strikes 110º to 115º and dips 60º to 65º to the north and 
has been tested by drilling and surface trenching for 260 m.  It has been tested by four surface 
trenches and 22 drill holes to a depth of 130 m below surface.  The vein remains open to 
depth and to the west.  Drill hole CT-26 has extended the known depth of the vein to 215 m 
below surface. 
 
7.3.2 The Tyrone Volcanic Group 
 
Williams (personal communication, December, 2009) has provided the following list of 
anomalous areas and/or showings in the Tyrone Volcanic Group (TVG) on the DG2 licence.  
Their locations relative to the DG2 boundaries are shown in Figure 7.6. 
 

"A number of anomalous areas have been defined by the exploration completed to date.  
These include from NE to SW: 
 



 

 49

1.  Tullybrick  (273250E, 390000N)  The area contains bleached and sericitized tuffs with 
reported minor fuchsite over several hundreds of metres of section.  These contain 
disseminated pyrite grading up to 5% and a maximum gold value of 2.78 g/t Au.  
 
2.  Bonnety Bush  (272500E, 388750N)  Much of the area is moorland with limited rock 
exposure.  However, there is good exposure of the jasper, magnetite ferruginous chert that 
marks the top of the Cycle 2, Bonnety Bush-Glencurry Formation.  The main target area is 
located to the north of this.  However, there are a number of targets south of the top of the 
Cycle 2 volcanics that were highlighted by the MPM study that warrant investigation.  
 
3.  Crocknahala (Broughderg)  (266600E, 387000N)  This northeasterly trending area may be 
on the rhyolite horizon, no outcrop was seen.  The presence of much tonalite float, some of it 
sheared, may indicate that the tonalite extends further northeast than shown on published 
maps.  Trenching to test anomalous geochemistry intersected 1.5m @ 4.36 g/t Au in 
tectonized tuffs.

4.  Aghascrebagh  (261000E, 383400N)  to Greencastle  (258250E, 382200N)  The area is 
between the tonalite and the Omagh Thrust and contains altered tuffs with disseminated 
pyrite-galena-sphalerite-chalcopyrite mineralization.  Drilling in the area has intersected 
siliceous tuffs with maximum values of 0.5m @ 2% Pb/Zn and 0.5 g/t Au. 

DG2 

DG1

5.  The Formil (Cashel) Copper Prospect (262000E, 382200N)  Exploration by Riofinex in the 
1970s established the presence of low-grade copper porphyry-type mineralization at Formil 
(Cashel) and additional low-grade copper mineralization was intersected further west. 
 
At Formil, drilling by Ennex was in quartz porphyry within an area of argillic alteration.  At 
the contiguous Slievemenagh copper occurrence drillhole H-7 (Riofinex) intersected 
northwesterly dipping mineralization, 94.2m @ 0.16% Cu, including 1.83m @ 0.32% Cu, in 
banded mesocratic, dark, tuffs cut by small acid and intermediate intrusions.  The tuffs are 
silicified near the intrusions.  Mineralization reportedly occurs as veinlets and blobs in quartz 
veins or as disseminations in the surrounding rock. 
 
About 3km west-southwest of Formil, Riofinex intersected further low copper values.  Here 
drillhole H-2 intersected 39.6m @ 0.17% Cu in tuffs with coincident copper soil anomalies, 
drillhole H-4 intersected 46m @ 0.12% Cu in tuffs and drillhole H-6 intersected 24m @ 
0.17% Cu in tuffs. 
 
6.  The Cashel-Leaghan (Cashel Rock) Gold Prospect  (258950E, 380100N)  In the 1980s 
Ennex discovered and drilled the Cashel-Leaghan (Cashel Rock) gold prospect.  The prospect 
was discovered by geochemistry / prospecting and tested by trenching / drilling.  
 
Significant gold was outlined by Ennex (max. 3.63m @ 30.5 g/t Au, including a 1.23m 
interval @ 1.14% Cu and 1.85% Pb), along a 100m zone of silica flooding within rhyolite 
flows.  The silica zone, about 2m thick, dips west at 30º and may occur along a flow top or 
alternatively at the contact between a felsic intrusion and a rhyolite flow. 
 
7.  Murrins  (256000E, 377500N)  This area is located to the SW of the Cashel-Leaghan gold 
prospect and occurs in an area with extensive gravel development with a number of operating 
sand and gravel pits and no bedrock exposure.  No rhyolite is mapped as occurring beneath the 
sands/gravel but rhyolite may exist here on the northern side of the tonalite and this would 
enhance the potential of the target area.  A further positive aspect is that if the tonalite, which 
dilates the section, is abstracted it brings the Murrins area into close depositional proximity 
with the Loughmacrory quartz porphyry. 
  
8.  Mountfield (253600E, 378000N) to Glencurry (251000E, 377000N).  The volcanics in this 
area are located between the rhyolite and the graphitic pelite that occurs along the Omagh 
Thrust.  The bedrock exposure in the area is very limited but prospecting in the area in the 
1980s located tuff float with disseminated sphalerite. 
  
9.  Loughmacrory (259000E, 377300N).  This target area is located at the top of Cycle 1 and 
straddles the area between the Loughmacrory quartz porphyry and the tonalite to the north.  A 
large boulder of rhyolite volcaniclastic occurs in a dry stone wall of a laneway, near the foot 
of the hill.  There is a suggestion that the quartz porphyry may have vented onto the sea floor 
in this vicinity, thereby creating a favourable environment for the deposition of massive 
sulphide deposits.  If this is so, it makes areas south of the tonalite more prospective than 
would otherwise be the case." 

 
Beaghbeg (see Figure 7.6) is another important anomalous area in the TVG.  At this location 
surface jasperoid and rhyolite breccia outcrops have been identified.  Soil sampling by Ennex 



 

 51

has identified soil geochemical anomalies with anomalous levels of copper, lead, zinc and 
gold.  
 
Crosh (see Figure 7.6) is a possible gold exhalite target where silicified volcanics and black 
shale gold mineralization have been found.  Grab samples in siliceous tuff have returned gold 
values of 0.57, 0.42 and 0.37 g/t.  Soil sampling by Ennex has also discovered anomalous 
levels of copper, lead, zinc and gold. 
 
Although the TVG has been recognized as a terrane suitable for the possible discovery of 
VMS-style mineralization, and some supporting evidence has been found, no massive 
sulphide mineralization has been discovered to date.  Sulphides of volcanic origin have been 
found though.  Analogies with the TVG have been drawn above to the host rocks of the 
Buchans, Newfoundland area.  The following description of Buchans type ores is taken from 
Thurlow and Swanson (1981). 
 

"The Buchans group is a regionally extensive calc-alkaline volcanic suite erupted at a point in 
time near the Ordovician-Silurian boundary.  It is subdivided in Lower and Upper Subgroups, 
each of which consists of interbedded mafic to felsic pyroclastics, flows and breccias. 
 
"The Buchans ores are high grade Kuroko-like polymetallic massive sulphide deposits 
associated with submarine felsic volcanic rocks near the top of the Lower Buchans Subgroup.  
Three genetically related ore types occur: stockwork ore, in situ ore and mechanically 
transported fragmental ore.  Stockwork ore consists of networks of veinlet and disseminated 
base metal sulphides within highly silicified and locally chloritized host rocks.  In situ ore lies 
stratigraphically above stockwork mineralization and is composed of banded to streaky yellow 
ore, black ore and barite.  Transported ore consists of discrete orebodies composed of sulphide 
and barite fragments which were derived from in situ ore, transported by density flows and 
deposited in paleotopographic depressions.  They maintain ore grade at distances greater than 
2 km from the source area, well beyond the limits of stockwork mineralization and related 
alteration.   
 
"The Buchans ores are outstanding among massive volcanogenic sulphides because of their 
very high grade and the extensive development of mechanically transported fragmental ores." 

 
Thurlow and Swanson (1981) report that 17,426,000 tons of ore grading 14.62% Zn, 7.60% 
Pb, 1.34% Cu 3.69 oz/ton Ag and 0.043 oz/ton Au had been mined from five major orebodies 
in the Buchans area.  Strong (1981) reports that ores commonly contain pyrite, chalcopyrite, 
sphalerite, galena, quartz, barite and calcite.  The sphalerite is very low in iron (<1%) and the 
silver occurs essentially in tetrahedrite and not galena. 
 
 

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
Tully (2005) described the types of mineral deposits that have been identified on DG1 and 
DG2 (identified as UM-1/02 and UM-2/02 in 2005): 
 



 

 52

"Orogenic structurally controlled, mesothermal gold-bearing quartz and quartz-sulphide veins 
in Dalradian clastic meta-sedimentary rocks - e.g. the Curraghinalt deposit. 

 
"Possible stratabound and perhaps stratiform semi-massive and massive bands of base metal 
(lead, zinc and pyrite) sulphides with significant gold values in fine grained Dalradian clastic 
meta-sedimentary strata - e.g. the Glenlark occurrence. 

 
"Porphyry"-style bodies in altered intermediate intrusive rocks within the Tyrone Volcanic 
Group.  Sulphide veinlet stockworks contain pyrite and chalcopyrite, and some quartz veins 
host rare galena and sphalerite.  Molybdenite occurs on shear surfaces - e.g. the Formil 
occurrence. 

 
"Siliceous breccias with gold values and base metal sulphides in felsic units of the Tyrone 
Volcanic Group - e.g. the Cashel Rock occurrence." 

 
8.1 THE CURRAGHINALT DEPOSIT 
 
The Curraghinalt deposit, an orogenic structurally-controlled, mesothermal gold deposit is 
comprised of a swarm of gold-bearing quartz veins within a meta-sedimentary sequence of 
pelites, semi-pelites and psammites.  The veins range from a few centimetres wide to over 3 
m wide and are aligned along a west-northwest trend.  Average width is approximately 1.2 m.  
The strike length of the vein swarm at Curraghinalt has been traced by prospecting, trenching 
and drilling to a minimum length of 1,950 m and remains open to the east and west.  The 
veins included in the present resource occur over a width of approximately 600 m from north 
to south and more veins are known to occur to both the north and south.  The veins dip 
between 60º and 75º to the north and depth has been traced to approximately 840 m below 
surface  The vein system remains open to depth. 
 
As noted above, the structures are interpreted to be related to high-angle, east-west- to west-
northwest-trending shears which are probably related to the thrusting of the Dalradian 
metasediments over the Tyrone Igneous Complex. 
 
A technical report prepared for the DETI and Crown Mineral Agent by Aurum (Williams, 
2008) describes the veins as follows: 
 

"The veins are dominantly quartz, with some carbonates.  Locally abundant sulphides 
are mostly pyrite and commonly contain variable amounts of other accessory minerals 
[sic], notably chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite and tennantite, and trace amounts of galena, 
sphalerite, molybdenite and several telluride minerals present.  Gold is reported to 
occur as electrum, in unspecified telluride minerals and within the pyrite." 

 
8.2 THE TYRONE IGNEOUS COMPLEX 
 
The Tyrone Igneous Complex (TIC) comprises the Tyrone Plutonic Group and the Tyrone 
Volcanic Group (TVG). 
 



 

 53

The TIC is known to host both gold and porphyry copper style mineralization and is 
interpreted to have good potential to host VMS style mineralization similar to the Buchans 
type. 
 
Williams and Archibald (personal communication via e-mail, December, 2009) observe the 
following: 
 

"The main potential for VMS mineralization is in Cycle 3 [of the TVG] and extends along a 2-
3 km wide corridor on the southern side of the Omagh Thrust.  Southwest from Crocknahala 
(267000E, 387000N) the volcanics are intruded [by] tonalites and quartz porphyries with 
associated rhyolites.  It is likely that the rhyolites trending southwest from the Slievemenagh 
area (Formil) (262500E, 382700N) continue under glacial cover along the northerly side of the 
tonalite towards Mountfield and then continue on either side of the tonalite for some distance 
to the southwest.  The rhyolite may be assumed to continue southwest from the Cashel-
Leaghan gold prospect along the northern flank of the tonalite.  
 
"With regard to the licensed area, the most prospective VMS locations would be along strike 
from these central areas, both north and south of the tonalite.  The northerly striking Dungate 
fault makes the volcanic rocks on its northeast side towards Tullybrick a favourable locus for 
VMS deposits." 

 
As described above, there is also potential for porphyry-style copper mineralization and gold-
mineralized silicified breccias.  The potential target types in the TVG, on licence DG2, are 
summarized in Figure 8.1. 
 
Ongoing research by Hollis has indicated that the newly defined Greencastle Formation 
(equivalent to Cycle 3 quoted by Williams and Archibald) is the most likely correlation with 
the Annieopsquotch Group in Newfoundland that is host to the Buchans VMS deposits.  
Hollis bases this on detailed geochemistry and age dating (personal communication with 
G. Earls of Dalradian Resources, 2011).

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 
The exploration programs carried out by Ennex between 1983 and 1997 have been described 
in Section 6, above.  Between 1997 and 2002, only a small amount of exploration was 
undertaken on the property during a period of relatively low metal prices and poor markets. 
 
Following the option agreement of 2003 between Tournigan and Strongbow, Tournigan 
carried out geochemical and geophysical surveys, mapping and prospecting and a 26-hole 
diamond drilling program. 
 
Since 2010, Dalradian Resources has completed 45 drill holes at Curraghinalt (DG1) and 
three drill holes on DG2.  In addition, a review of the Tellus geophysical survey has been 
completed and prospecting has taken place on all licences.  The Tellus survey is a 
geochemical and airborne geophysical survey sponsored by the government of Northern 
Ireland and intended to create a dataset of magnetic, radiometric and electromagnetic 
geophysical data available to the public.  In cooperation with the Irish government it has since 
been expanded to the border areas of Ireland to create a seamless cross border dataset of 
geophysical data. 
 
9.1 NICKELODEON/NAVIGATOR/STRONGBOW 1997 - 2003 
 
Nickelodeon focused on validating drill core and underground channel sample gold assays.  A 
program of quarter drill core sampling and analysis successfully validated previous sampling 
and analyses.  Several channel samples were sawn on the back of the T17 and No. 1 drifts in 
lower, medium and higher grade sections.  The results from this program compared very 
closely with the existing samples collected during underground development in the late 1980s.

Strongbow focused exploration on two areas, Glenlark in DG1 and Crosh in DG2.  Mobile 
Metal Ion geochemistry was completed in both areas (Glenlark 236 sites; Crosh 308 sites) and 
defined coherent precious and base metal anomalies.  An induced polarization (IP) 
geophysical survey at Glenlark identified a series of conductors. 
 
The mineralization encountered in the first trench (T10) comprised stratiform and crosscutting 
zones of massive and semi-massive zinc, lead and iron sulphides.  These zones were also 
associated with significant gold and silver values (tabulated in Table 9.1 below

Au and 22.53 g/t Ag. 
 
The second trench (T11) encountered very deep overburden conditions and bedrock was not 
encountered over much of its length.  Several angular mineralized boulders, which are 
interpreted to be related to a nearby source, were encountered.  
 
In addition prospecting was undertaken at Greencastle and Carnanransy in DG2. 
 
9.2 TOURNIGAN EXPLORATION, 2003 - JANUARY, 2005 
 
The following description of Tournigan's exploration work is taken from Tully (2005). 
 

"Tournigan started exploring the property in April, 2003 and has completed geochemical and 
geophysical surveys, plus mapping and prospecting programs as well as a 26-hole diamond 
drilling program on Curraghinalt. 

 
Geochemical Sampling 

 
"Tournigan collected 2,910 soil samples from north south oriented grid lines on 100m centres 
along the Curraghinalt trend.  Samples were collected at a depth of 50-75 cm, roughly the B-
soil horizon, on 30m spacing along the lines.  The area covered included the area to the north 
of the known vein structures, as well as in both directions along strike from the known veins. 
 



 

 56

"Many anomalous areas were identified in the sampled areas, indicating the continuity of the 
vein structures along strike as well as the possible presence of additional veins to the north of 
the known veins.  The main targets identified cover several areas north, northwest and 
northeast of the adit that combined, measures 1.5-km north to south and which extends for 
approximately 1.0-km along strike.  This area represents 419 sample points with values 
ranging from 400 - 12300 ppb Au, plus 5 smaller areas with similar values.  These areas 
outside the immediate area of the known veins will require follow-up deep overburden 
sampling plus diamond drilling to develop the individual vein structures. 

 
 Geophysics 
 

"An attempt to conduct a VLF survey over the grid area was eventually abandoned when the 
Cuttler Maine transmitter station was shut down.  A total of 652 readings taken at 30m 
spacing along 100m spaced lines were completed prior to the shut down of the Maine station.  
The results were inconclusive.  The Rugby station, located in the UK was never turned on 
during the time of the survey. 

 
 Geology 
 

"Tournigan has completed preliminary mapping and prospecting throughout the license area.  
One of the discoveries resulting from this work is the Alwories Vein, located 2.5 km southeast 
of Curraghinalt.  Previous work in this area had identified float samples of vein material only.  
Vein outcrop was mapped in a newly developed rock quarry.  Hand stripping subsequently 
revealed a 50-cm wide vein that averaged 15 g/t Au.  The Alwories vein is a quartz-sulfide 
vein very similar to the veins that comprise the Curraghinalt deposit.  Future work in this area 
will include detailed stripping and sampling, detailed mapping and possibly follow-up 
diamond drilling." 

 
Tournigan's exploration work on the property, starting in April, 2003 was carried out by its 
subsidiary, Dalradian Gold.  Aurum, based in Kells, County Meath, Ireland, provided local 
project management services and technical staffing for the project. 
 
Tully reported that Tournigan completed 33 HQ drill holes between 2003 and January, 2005.  
Of these, seven were drilled in the Glenlark area and 26 infill holes were drilled in the 
Curraghinalt deposit. 
 
Infill drilling, holes 03-CT-05 to 04-CT-26, was completed on the central resource block. 

 
9.3 TOURNIGAN EXPLORATION FROM JANUARY, 2005 
 
The drilling programs carried out by Tournigan since the preparation of Tully (2005) are 
described in Section 11 below. 
 
Tournigan's exploration program up to the time of writing of the Tully report is described in 
Tully (2005).  Tully concluded: 
 

"The work completed by Tournigan to date [i.e., to the date of Tully's report in January, 2005] 
has consisted of 26 diamond drill holes (4,391m) on the Curraghinalt deposit, 7 holes [drilled] 



 

 57

on the Glenlark project area (NE of Curraghinalt) for a total 830.5m, shallow depth 
geochemical surveys, detailed compilation work, plus one trench (228m) and a satellite 
imagery analysis of the area." 

 
In 2005, Tournigan completed two diamond drill holes in the area of the Crows Foot-Bend 
structural zone (05-CT-27 and 05-CT-28). 
 
In 2006 to 2007, a 25-hole program of infill drilling was completed on the Southeast 
Extension target.   
 
A program of underground structural mapping and sampling was undertaken by consultant 
structural geologist, John Cuthill in 2002-2003.  The T17 and No. 1 drifts were the principal 
areas of emphasis.  Tully (2005) reported on the structural analysis as follows: 
 

"The data suggests that faulting has played a significant role in ground preparation within the 
vein structures.  The faulting appears to have facilitated the injection of the Q4 style sulphide 
rich quartz veining material in the veins where they are in close contact with the Kiln Shear.  
The high-grade nature of most of the drill holes piercing the T17HW vein in the area where 
the vein intersects the Kiln Shear suggests a high-grade shoot in this area. 
 
"Similarly, the apparent low-grade sections occurring within the plane of the veins can be 
shown in some cases to be associated with the pelite horizons that tended to deform 
plastically, rather than in brittle fashion.  The presence of the pelitic units has resulted in rather 
"tight" rock conditions that have inhibited the injection of quartz veining.  Within these low-
grade horizons mostly barren to low grade Q1 quartz has formed.  The nature of the enclosing 
rock has prevented the formation of Q2 and Q4 gold bearing veining.  Consequently the quartz 
veining within these semi-pelite units tend to contain only narrow, Q1 relatively barren quartz.  
Since stratigraphy strikes NE, and dips at a moderate angle across the NNW striking vein sets, 
the low grade intervals are created by the pelitic units where such units intersect the strike of 
the veins." 
 

The location of holes drilled by Tournigan between 2003 and 2007, and the adit developed by 
Ennex, are shown on Figure 9.1.

Data from trench samples had not been digitized and precise sample locations had not been 
mapped.  No data from trench samples were used in the previous mineral resource estimates.  
 
Tournigan planned to collate the data from trench sampling but, to Micon's knowledge, this 
was not completed. 
 
9.4 TOURNIGAN EXPLORATION 2007 TO 2009 
 
After completion of the 2007 Micon resource estimate for Tournigan (Mukhopadhyay, 2007), 
the company completed several more drill holes at the Curraghinalt deposit.  The results of 
that work are discussed in Section 11 below.  After cessation of drilling at Curraghinalt 
Tournigan had Aurum engage in a small program of data compilation, prospecting and 
sampling on the DG3 and DG4 licence areas.  Williams (2009) describes the work completed 
as follows: 
 

Geological Data - Geology, Prospecting and Sampling 
 
"All available historical data (which includes geological mapping, field prospecting and 
geochemistry) was collected and catalogued during the earlier phases of work.  This data was 
re-assessed and new data, where possible, was added to the database.  This data included 
outcrop data, prospecting data, and general geological data.  
 

53 Holes 

26 SE Extension

"Historical prospecting had previously identified several areas where significant auriferous 
quartz vein material was evident either in bedrock or float.  The results ranged between 15-
30g/t Au in the Rylagh area, >100g/t in the SW corner of TG-3 (now DG 3) at Bessy Bell, and 
187g/t Au in Glensass Burn on TG-4 (now DG 4). 
 
"Satellite imagery completed by Tournigan in 2004 identified structural trends on TG-3 (DG 
3) and TG-4 (DG 4) which are very strongly analogous to those at Curraghinalt, and along 
with the anomalous geochemistry that characterizes the area, several important target areas 
have emerged. 
 
Geochemistry - Stream Sediments \ Panned Concentrates 
 
"All existing geochemical data was compiled for the TG-3 (DG 3) and TG-4 (DG 4) licences 
and this included panned concentrate data collected historically by Ennex, and also British 
Geological Survey (BGS) stream sediment data.  This data was compiled and re-evaluated in 
the target generation. 
 
"Ennex also carried out detailed panned concentrate surveys on TG-4 [DG4, the licence 
bordering DG1 to the north], in an area around Plumbridge and Eden Hill.  Several very 
anomalous streams had been identified with values up to 97-105 ppm Au in panned 
concentrates.  No equivalent data sets for historical panned concentrate have so far been 
located for TG-3. 
 
Geophysics 
 
"Since the last renewal period, the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland released the Tellus 
Airborne Geophysical Survey Data for Northern Ireland.  This data was purchased [technically 
Tellus data is leased] and work was carried out in-house by Aurum Exploration Services using 
this Geophysical database to interpret geological features including faults, conductive units 
and specific anomalous targets. 
 
Geological Appraisal 
 
"Licences TG-3 and TG-4 [DG3 and DG4] have a significant potential to host Curraghinalt 
style mineralization as well as several other distinct styles, most of the licence area is 
underlain by Dalradian metasediments interbedded with volcanics and intrusive lithologies.  
Structurally there are some major features known both historically and through more recent 
satellite imagery work and also through interpretive use of the Tellus airborne geophysical 
data.  There have been several reported float and outcrop occurrences of gold mineralization 
and also the high level of anomalism for gold within the panned concentrate surveys carried 
out by Ennex in the 1980's. 
 
"Work during the last reporting period 2005 - 2007 concentrated primarily on the stream 
sediment geochemical data set and detailed basin analysis work was carried out on the 
anomalous drainage basins.  Limited follow up shallow soil geochemistry failed to identify a 
mineralizing structures associated with these very high values and though most evidence has 
started to point to a glacially derived origin for this alluvial gold.  A buried bedrock source 
however still cannot be ruled out."

Aurum identified several targets for follow-up work but this exploration program has yet to be 
completed. 
 
9.5 DALRADIAN RESOURCES EXPLORATION 
 
Since acquiring the Tyrone project, Dalradian Resources, in addition to the drill program at 
Curraghinalt, began a program of exploration on others areas of its licenses.  After carrying 
out a review of the Northern Ireland Government Tellus geophysical data, regional 
prospecting and target generation was undertaken. 
 
Prospecting was carried out on all four licences in the first and second quarters of 2011.  A 
total of 929 samples were collected, 143 of which assayed greater than 0.25 g/t Au.  A 
summary of the samples is provided in Table 9.2.  The locations of the prospecting samples 
are shown in Figure 9.2.

DG4 159 97 62 0.01 - 2.07 2 samples over 0.25 g/t Au 

 
Integration and re-evaluation of previous exploration and the new regional prospecting 
information identified 19 areas for detailed follow-up and drill testing.  These are shown in 
Figure 9.3. 
 
These targets can be split into two distinct groups, those within the igneous TVG, mainly 
located within licence DG2, and those within the Dalradian Supergroup (DSG) of 
predominantly metasediments in DG1, DG3 and DG4.

The TVG is an environment favourable for the formation of VMS deposits.  It is interpreted to 
have a similar origin as the Buchans VMS camp in Newfoundland and contains an abundance 
of float with VMS-style mineralization.  Gold and base metal mineralization is most prevalent 
within the upper part of the volcanic sequence.  Historic prospecting results include siliceous 
tuff assaying 16.1% Pb and 1.5 g/t Au and chloritic tuff assaying 8.8% Zn, 1.2% Pb and 
1.7 g/t Au. 
 
In the DSG, the highest priority exploration targets are within the Curraghinalt structural 
corridor, an area of approximately 8 km of strike length and 3 km width, centred on the 
Curraghinalt mesothermal gold deposit. 
 
The targets in the TVG and DSG are described in Tables 9.3 and 9.4 and their locations are 
shown in Figures 9.2 and 9.3.

Following the target identification, a program of regional scout-drilling was started, with two 
targets having been drilled up to the time of writing of this report.  Two drill holes were 
completed at TVG-1 (Broughderg) and one drill hole was completed at TVG-7 (Tullybrick).  
There were no significant intercepts in these three drill holes. 
 
Dalradian Resources' plan is to continue scout drilling the most promising targets in the TVG 
and the DSG. 
 
 

10.0 DRILLING 
 
The drilling completed by Irish Base Metals/Ennex/Strongbow was described in Section 6, 
History.  The holes drilled by those companies, Tournigan and Dalradian Resources are listed 
in Appendix 1 of this report.  The relevant mineralized drill intersections are listed in 
Appendix 2. 
 
10.1 TOURNIGAN DRILL PROGRAMS 
 
Irish Drilling Limited (Irish Drilling) was contracted to carry out all drilling on the 
Curraghinalt area property on behalf of Tournigan and, according to Tully (2005), was one of 
the principal contractors engaged by Ennex in the 1980s.  From 2002, Aurum managed the 
drilling program carried out by Irish Drilling for Tournigan.  The programs were designed 
primarily by Aurum and Tournigan structural geologist, John Cuthill. 
 
Drilling at Curraghinalt between 2003 and the date of the Micon resource estimate in 2007 is 
summarized in Table 10.1.

Tully (2005) describes the program up to January, 2005 as follows: 
 

"The drill type used for the Dalradian Gold program is a Boyles Brothers 37, mounted on a 
Go-Tract 1000, which allows access to boggy areas.  The rig is operated on a 10-hour shift by 
experienced drillers and helpers.  The core size is mostly HQ, although NQ has been utilized 
when necessary to allow continuation of drilling in difficult conditions when HQ-sized casing 
is required.  Earlier drilling by Ennex produced both HQ and NQ sized core as well.  Core 
recovery is very good and averages in the 95-98% range." 
 

Each drill site was fenced off prior to the start of drilling to keep livestock away from the rig.  
Personal protective equipment was used by drillers and visitors to the site. 
 
Each drill site was located with GPS, staked and then photographed prior to the rig being 
moved in.  The holes were down-hole surveyed by using an Encore "Reflexit" smart multi-
shot tool instrument.  Tully reports that a Tropari survey instrument was used for the first four 
holes in the Tournigan program.  On completion of the drill hole, the collar was surveyed by 
Celtic Surveys Ltd. using the Irish National Grid, to the nearest centimetre.  All holes have 
been cemented except 04-CT-26, which was left open for potential future use.  All sites were 
cleared on completion and re-photographed. 
 
10.2 DALRADIAN RESOURCES DRILLING 
 
Dalradian Resources began a new drilling campaign following the purchase of Dalradian 
Gold from Tournigan.  The program commenced in March, 2010 with the mobilization of two 
Boyles 37 track-mounted drills with the capability of drilling to a depth of 500 m using HQ 
rods.  These drills were supplied by Irish Drilling.  A second diamond drill contract was 
signed with Major Drilling and two drills were mobilized to site in December, 2010, with a 
third Major drill mobilized in August, 2011.  The Major drilling fleet consists of one UDR200 
track-mounted drill, one AVD6000 track mounted drill and one AVD6100 track-mounted 
drill.  The UDR drill is capable of drilling to 800 m depth using HQ rods and the two AVD 
rigs are capable of drilling to a depth of 1,500 m using HQ rods. 
 
The majority of the drilling with all five rigs is HQ diameter.  NQ diameter is sometimes used 
when a reduction from HQ is required due to ground conditions. 
 
Drilling is carried out on a single shift, with the Irish Drilling rigs working a 10-hour shift, 5 
days per week and the Major rigs working 12-hour shifts, 7 days per week. 
 
Prior to drilling, access agreements are negotiated with the owners of the surface lands and, 
generally, compensation is paid for use of the land and for disturbances caused by drilling.  
Before drilling, all drill sites are photographed.  They are also photographed upon completion 
of a drill hole and again after rehabilitation of the drill site. 
 
Drill hole locations are marked out using a GPS and later all drill collars are independently 
surveyed.  Down-hole surveys are carried out on all drill holes using a REFLEX multi-shot 



 

 68

tool, with a reading taken every 6 m.  This survey information is stored in the drill hole 
database. 
 
All drill core is stored at the drill location during the shift, and brought to Gortin at the end of 
each day.  The drill core is stored in a secure shed.  For the majority of the drill campaign, the 
drill core was logged, sampled and photographed at the core facility in Gortin and then moved 
to storage at one of two facilities located outside Gortin.  Dalradian Resources has recently 
leased a larger office and core facility in Omagh, approximately 15 km from the Gortin 
facility.  Presently core is stored overnight in the secure facility in Gortin and transported the 
following morning to Omagh, where it is logged, sampled and photographed and stored.   
 
All sampled material and pulps previously stored in Gortin are being transferred to the new 
facility in Omagh. 
 
For Micon's 2010 Curraghinalt resource estimate, the drill hole database was frozen at hole 
CT-57.  In this current estimate, an additional 45 holes were drilled totalling 20,561.9 m.  The 
locations of these holes are shown in Figure 10.2 and a summary of the new Dalradian 
Resources drilling is presented in Table 10.4.  This drilling was a combination of holes to the 
east and west of the previous resource and testing the structures at depth.  In addition to the 45 
holes completed, five holes, totalling 318.4 m, were drilled, but were not included in the 
resource estimate as these holes were abandoned at various depths due to drilling difficulties 
(see Table 10.5). 
 
Drill results for the mineralized intersections in these 45 holes are provided in Appendix 2 of 
this report.   
 
Vein thicknesses are discussed in Section 14, Mineral Resources of this report.

10.3 CORE LOGGING 
 
Prior to sampling, the drill core is washed and logged by the site geologist.  This process 
results in a recovery log, and core annotated with metre-marks.  Drill core was logged to 
record lithology, structure, alteration, rock quality designation (RQD) and mineralization. 
 
Core logging was carried out by geologists assigned to the project by Aurum (until July, 
2011) and by Dalradian Resources staff (after July, 2011).  The length of core brought from 
the drill site is confirmed against the drill report.  Logging commences with the calculation of 
core recovery.  Geology is then marked with particular reference paid to the identification of 
mineralized zones.  Structural data collected include orientation of mineralized quartz veins 
against the longitudinal axis of the core with particular care given to mineralized veins that 
are sub-parallel to the longitudinal axis.  Alteration and geotechnical information (RQD) are 
noted.   
 
In general, core recoveries vary from 90 to 97%, and RQDs are generally in the high 80s or 
better, except in certain wall rock zones (pelites and faults).  In general, the core size drilled is 
HQ which results in excellent recoveries and, thus, the samples are considered to be 
representative of the veins.  Some drill holes are reduced to NQ to allow for completion of a 
hole.  The overall recovery difference between NQ and HQ core is quite similar. 
 
Logging is carried out on paper with data then being input into a series of digital data logs 
which are entered into the computer database with other drill hole data logs. 
 
During its first site visit, Micon recommended that all drill core be photographed in order to 
provide a permanent record and to conform to accepted industry best practice.  Tournigan 
initiated photography of all vein material immediately following the site visit in August, 2007 
and, at the time of writing of the 2007 report, this was substantially complete.  Presently, all 
core is routinely photographed and the photographic record, along with copies of the paper 
drill logs, geotechnical logs and assay certificates are stored in a separate file for each drill 
hole.   
 
Figure 10.3 shows an example photograph of mineralized drill core.

Micon's observation of core logging during the 2009 visit showed it to be carried out to 
industry standards. 
 
 

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
11.1 SAMPLING 
 
The Dalradian Resources sampling approach and methodology is as follows. 
 
All sulphidic quartz vein material intersected in the drill core is sampled.   
 
Core sample intervals are selected by the geologist logging the hole.  The maximum sample 
interval is currently 0.25 m in mineralized veins with no minimum width (intervals are as 
short as 0.02 m).  The 0.25-m sample length was set so that the entire sample is pulverized at 
the laboratory, eliminating the need to split the crushed sample.  Samples in weakly 
mineralized or unmineralized wall rock are usually significantly larger (i.e. up to 1 m). 
 
Sample intervals tend to be split by the geology and or mineralization noted (i.e. sulphide-rich 
zones in veins are separated from quartz-rich zones), and wall rock samples are only taken if 
mineralized (i.e. stockwork veins are present). 
 
During the logging process the geologist marks the intervals to be sampled on both the core 
and the core box.  The core is then oriented along the line of symmetry and sawn with a 
diamond-tipped saw.  This process allows for an accurate depth measurement to be assigned 
to each sample.  Once an interval is cut, both halves of the core are placed back in the box, 
and the next interval is sawn. 
 
A sample ticket book is used to record sample intervals and a brief mineralogical description.  
Each sample is assigned an identifying number as printed on each ticket.  A plastic sample 
bag is then clearly numbered with the matching ticket number placed inside with the split 
core.  A duplicate ticket is stapled to the core box at the start of the sample interval above the 
remaining half core in the core box. 
 
Once bagged, all the samples split during each work shift are placed on the floor in numerical 
order.  When all the individual samples have been counted, and the tag numbers verified, the 
samples are placed into large plastic bags.  Each larger bag of samples is sealed with a wire 
tag and an address label.  These bags are stored in the locked core shed until shipment to the 
laboratory by a commercial courier service 
 
The QA/QC procedures for the sampling processes are shown in Table 11.1, which has been 
based on information provided by Dalradian Resources.

Table 11.1  
Drill Set-up, Sampling Procedures and Controls 

 
Procedure Comments 

Sampling Orient the core. 
Mark sample boundaries using mineralogy and percentage sulphide as guidelines. 
Record intervals on sample sheet. 
Sample main veins at 0.25-m intervals. 
Split the actual vein width only if vein intercept is less than 10 cm. 
Maximum sample width 0.25 m. 
Insert one analytical standard packet as a sample amongst each main vein; approximately 20% of 
all samples per hole. 
Insert one blank sample of drill core as a sample amongst each main vein; approximately 20% of 
all samples per hole. 
Photograph sampled vein intervals once sampled drill core has been returned to shed. 

 
11.2 SAMPLE ANALYSES 
 
Currently, all exploration samples at Curraghinalt are analysed at OMAC Laboratories 
(OMAC), Athenry Road, Loughrea, County Galway, Republic of Ireland.  The OMAC 
laboratory was also used by Tournigan.  Before Tournigan, sample analysis was carried out 
by Ennex at OMAC as well, except for the underground sample analyses from the 
development drifts which were completed at the Ennex Mine Laboratory, essentially a 
satellite OMAC laboratory. 
 
OMAC joined the Alex Stewart Assayers group in 2000 and operates as its principal 
exploration laboratory.  In July, 2011, The Alex Stewart Group was acquired by the ALS 
Group, the testing services business of Campbell Brothers Limited.  OMAC states that it is 
accredited to ISO 17025 by the Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB).  ISO 17025 
relates to general requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories.  
INAB is a member of the International Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and is a signatory 
to the ILAC Mutual Recognition Arrangement whose signatories include Canada, the United 
States, Australia, South Africa, Japan and countries of the European Union, among others.  
OMAC states that its accreditation schedule can be accessed through the INAB website under 
Registration No. 173T (www.inab.ie). 
 
OMAC participates in twice-yearly round robin programs run by Geostats of Perth, Australia, 
and under the Proficiency Testing Program for Materials Analysis Laboratories (PTP-MAL) 
run by CANMET in Canada.  (See www.omaclabs.com/QA-QC.htm). 
 
The sample preparation and analytical methods used by OMAC are shown in Table 11.2

Micon confirmed with the site geologist and a director of Aurum, and representatives of 
Tournigan during the 2007 site visit, that the procedures described by Tully for sample 
preparation and assaying remain in place.  
 
11.3 SAMPLE SECURITY 
 
All drill core is brought from the drills at the end of shift, and is stored in a rented lockable 
storage facility on the main street of Gortin, across the road from the field office.  Until 
November, 2011 core was sawn at a nearby farm and unmineralized core boxes were stored in 
a concrete-floored barn at that location.  Mineralized sample boxes were returned to the 
industrial building where they were kept under lock and key.  In November, 2011, Dalradian 
Resources leased a new office and core facility in nearby Omagh.  The drill core is brought 
from the drills at the end of the shift and stored overnight in the secure facility on the main 
street in Gortin as previously was done.  The following day, the core is brought to the Omagh 
facility where it is logged, sawn and stored.  The Omagh facility is located in a secure fenced 
area, which is locked in the evenings and the weekends.  The core storage and logging facility 
is kept locked when unoccupied.  Unshipped samples are also stored at this location.  
 
11.4 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
 
11.4.1 Early QA/QC Programs 
 
The QA/QC procedures have varied slightly over the history of the exploration of the deposit, 
and can be broken into three main phases, the Ennex work, the Tournigan work and the 



 

 77

Dalradian Resources work.  The database used in this resource estimate contains assay 
information from all drilling carried out on the property 
 
Tully (2005) describes sample Tournigan QA/QC procedures as follows: 
 

"Quality control is maintained by inserting a blank sample of limestone drill core from the 
midlands of Ireland (Lisheen area), known to contain no gold, after each mineralized interval, 
and given the next sequential identifying number.  This sample is recorded as a "blank" in the 
ticket book.  At least 15% of the samples submitted are "blanks". 

 
"In addition, Tournigan uses six different standards of known gold grade that it submits as 
control samples.  The standard name is recorded in the sample ticket book and when the assay 
results from the lab are received, they are compared with the known grade of the standard.  … 
The results from the "Standard" check analysis have agreed very well. 

 
"Sample pulps are returned to the mine office in Gortin once analysis is complete.  Fifteen to 
twenty percent of the returned pulps are reanalyzed.  These samples are sent back to OMAC 
[Laboratories] for re-analysis under a new sample number.  A recent change to the procedure 
is to send half of the duplicates to OMAC and the remaining half of the 20% to an outside 
laboratory as an additional check on OMAC." 

 
Drilling carried out in the Curraghinalt area totaled about 27,299 m, up to August 15, 2007.  
In addition, an approximate total of 740 m of underground workings was established from an 
adit developed by Ennex and which included drifts, cross-cuts and raises.  This drifting helped 
confirm continuity of mineralized structures.  After August 15, 2007 an additional 2,502.8 m 
of core were drilled in the final four deep holes. 
 
Assaying for all drilling completed by Tournigan was carried out by OMAC at its facility at 
Loughrea, County Galway, Ireland.  Prior to Tournigan's programs, assaying of underground 
samples was carried out by Ennex at its internal laboratory which is referred to in this report 
as the Ennex Laboratory.  Ennex drill core was assayed at OMAC. 
 
Out of the total 27,299 m drilled, 8,923 m of drilling was carried out during 2006-2007.  
Tournigan's QA/QC program consisted of assaying of blanks, reference materials, duplicate 
samples, and the re-assay of samples in a reference laboratory.  Check assaying undertaken by 
Tournigan included samples from the Ennex drill programs assayed at the Ennex Laboratory.  
The details of samples assayed as part of Tournigan's QA/QC program are given in Table 
11.3.

11.4.2 Dalradian Resources QA/QC Program 
 
The QA/QC program was under the supervision of Aurum from the restart of drilling in 2010 
until July, 2011, at which time it was under the supervision of Dalradian Resources staff. 
 
The Dalradian Resources sampling and QA/QC procedures can be described as follows: 
 

1) Core sample intervals are selected by the geologist as described above. 
 

2) Sample intervals tend to be split by geology as described in Section 11.1 above. 
 

3) Samples are cut by diamond saw down the ellipse of the vein.  The same half is 
always taken for the sample and the other half is left in the core tray for reference.  
Cross cuts at sample extents are along the contact of the vein and wall rock, where this 
is possible on both vein contacts (with the interval measured to the centre of the core 
axis) or, if this is impossible, perpendicular across the core axis. 

 
4) To check for contamination during sample preparation at the laboratory, blanks are 

inserted where the geologist estimates the sample will be high grade.  These are 
inserted so that approximately 10% of the submitted samples are blanks.  The blank 
material is chunky (fist-sized) limestone from a local source that has been used 
extensively enough so that there is confidence that the material contains negligible 
amounts of gold. 

 
5) A certified Standard Reference Material (SRM or referred to in this report as a 

standard) is inserted into the sample stream so that they make up approximately 10% 
of the samples submitted.  These are 50-g sachets of pulverized, homogenized rock 
with gold and sulphide added.  The accepted gold grade of each standard is determined 
by round-robin assaying at multiple laboratories.  These are supplied by Rocklabs 
(New Zealand), with around five or six different standards in circulation at any one 
time and a current gold grade range from 1.34 to 30.04 g/t Au.  The selection has been 
chosen to reflect the typical range of vein assays as it is the accuracy within this grade 
range that is of interest.  The standard that is inserted is randomly selected. 

 
6) Before being dispatched the samples are sealed in bags and an additional signed and 

dated, tamper proof, security tag is placed around the wire tie.  All samples and core 
that will be sampled is stored in a locked core shed. 

 
7) Specific gravity (SG) measurements are attempted on each vein sample, using the 

water submersion method. 
 
Out of the total 51,575 m drilled at Curraghinalt, 20,561.9 m of drilling was carried out during 
2010-2011.  Dalradian Resources' QA/QC program consists of assaying of blanks and 
standard reference materials and a duplicate assay program at OMAC.  No sample re-assaying

has been conducted at a second reference laboratory.  The details of samples assayed as part 
of Dalradian Resources' QA/QC program are given in Table 11.4.

As part of its review of the quality control data, Micon conducted a number of checks to 
assess precision, accuracy and bias.  This is described in the following sections of the report. 
 
11.4.3 Blank Sample Results 
 
Pre-Dalradian Resources 
 
Blank samples form part of all analytical quality control procedures and are used to assess the 
accuracy of the assay results and to identify any possible contamination and mixing during 
analysis.  A total of 315 blanks were inserted along with the other samples.  As blanks are 
close to the detection limit of the laboratory, it is expected that the error in analysis at that 
level can be +50%.  There are two blanks which had considerable error and these are 
designated as outliers.  All the results were plotted in Figure 11.1.  The accuracy of the blanks 
is considered to be within an acceptable limit of error.

error plot compiled considering all the standards with the mean recalculated to zero and 
deviation plotted against the mean.  These results indicate that the assay results likely do not 
have any significant bias or accuracy issues.  All the results for the individual analyzed 
standard samples along with their certified value and acceptable range of standard deviation 
are plotted in Figures 11.4 to 11.10. 
 
There are some outliers from assays of standard samples that are beyond the acceptable limit 
of 2 standard deviations but these do not indicate bias or misallocation.  Micon had 
recommended that Tournigan review the outliers and, if necessary, re-assay the complete 
sample batch.   
 
Overall, Micon considers that the Tournigan results are within the acceptable range of error.

Dalradian Resources Standard Results 
 
A total of 10 different types of reference materials were used to check the accuracy of assays.  
All standards were acquired from Rocklabs Ltd. (New Zealand).  The average value for each 
standard along with its tolerance is given in Table 11.8.  A total of 288 standard samples were 
submitted along with the drill core samples.  Three samples had clear evidence of being 
attributed in the database with the incorrect reference standard code.  These were discarded 
from the graphical analysis (see Table 11.9 for details).  The average received value for each 
of the standards is given in Table 11.8.   
 
It may be seen that there are no significant bias or accuracy issues in analyzing the standards.  
This indicates that the assay results would not have any significant bias.  An error plot (Figure 
11.10) was also compiled considering all the standards with the mean recalculated to zero and 
deviation plotted against the mean.  All the results for analyzed standard samples, along with 
their certified value and acceptable range of standard deviation, are plotted in Figures 11.11 to 
11.20.   
 
There is one outlier from the assay results of the standard samples that is beyond the 
acceptable limit of 2 standard deviations (Sample A8366, Standard SH41) but this does not 
suggest any systematic bias or misallocation.  Dalradian Resources regularly reviews the 
outliers and, if necessary, will re-assay the complete sample batch, however this has not yet 
been deemed to be necessary.

An error plot was generated to understand the degree of error of individual samples between 
the original samples with the repeat samples.  This was done by plotting the mean of the two 
results with the absolute difference to the mean.  The plot is shown in Figure 11.22.  The plot 
shows that 87% of samples with a mean value above 5 g/t Au fall within a 10% absolute error.

Micon concludes that the QA/QC procedures used conform to industry standards and the data 
generated as a result are suitable for use in the present mineral resource estimate.  No 
significant bias has been identified as a result of the above analysis and which warrants 
further study. 
 
11.5 SPECIFIC GRAVITY DETERMINATIONS 
 
Tully (2005) provided a tabulation of specific gravity (SG) determinations carried out by 
Tournigan in 2004.  Two samples from drill core from each of the veins were sent to OMAC 
for specific gravity determinations by the water displacement method.  Table 11.10 
summarizes the specific gravity determinations for the veins as shown.

A total of 583 specific gravity samples have been generated since the Tournigan work.  A 
scatter plot was also generated in order to understand the relationship between gold grade and 
specific gravity.  The plot is shown in Figure 11.23.  The plot indicates that generally there is 
no significant relationship between the gold grade and specific gravity.  However, there is a 
positive correlation when the grade is above 10 g/t.  This result prompted Micon to use the 
average value of the specific gravity for each vein.   
 
Samples measured for specific gravity were selected for each vein/sub-vein/veinlet.  It was 
found that not all 35 veins have been analysed for specific gravity.  In the absence of some 
data, samples were regrouped into major veins and average values were calculated for each 
major vein as shown in Table 11.11.  The specific gravity assigned for minor veins and 
veinlets is the same as for the major veins.  For veins D and G, specific gravity values used 
were the same as those from the last resource estimate.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
12.1 DALRADIAN RESOURCES DATA VERIFICATION 
 
The QA/QC and data verification programs employed by Dalradian Resources and their 
results have been discussed in Section 11.4 above. 
 
12.2 MICON DATA VERIFICATION 
 
Micon was provided with the drill hole data from Curraghinalt and is satisfied that they are 
suitable for the present mineral resource estimate. 
 
During the second site visit in 2009, Micon collected five samples to confirm the presence of 
gold and copper mineralization at the Curraghinalt deposit.  A sixth sample was collected 
from silicified and mineralized outcrop at the Cashel Rock showing on licence DG2.  The 
results of this sampling are set out in Table 12.1.

75122 Cashel Rock Surface grab sample 8.71 10.9 555 

 
The original assay results for the duplicate quarter core samples 75120 and 75121 were 44.96 
g/t Au and 23.68 g/t Au.  The samples collected by Micon have confirmed the presence of 
gold mineralization at the expected grades on both the DG1 and DG2 licences. 
 
The checks carried out by Micon confirm the logging procedures utilized at the Curraghinalt 
site.  All drill core is stored in wooden boxes with proper numbering to indicate the drill hole 
number and metreage.  Random checks were carried out by Micon on the stored core and no 
discrepancies were identified. 
 
The drill hole database is maintained in Microsoft Access and work is carried out at 
Dalradian's offices in Omagh, Northern Ireland.  Regular checks are performed there to 
ensure that there are no errors in data entry.  Assay results are provided in Excel files from 
OMAC, thereby allowing direct electronic data transfer.  This eliminates any potential error 
arising from manual data entry. 
 
Micon utilized the data verification protocols available in Datamine software to check the 
database for errors such as transposed or crossed from and to entries for sample intervals, or 
incorrect entries in data fields.

Hanging wall and footwall contacts of mineralized veins were developed by contractors of 
Dalradian in constant consultation with Micon.  Several intermediate amendments and 
modifications were suggested by Micon which were adopted to create the final set of 
wireframes for each vein.  Wireframes were also verified for intersections between hanging 
wall and footwall and between veins.  In addition, Micon carried out spot checks to confirm 
that the changes have been adopted.  Micon did not review each intersection for each vein.  
 
The data submitted to Micon appear reliable in light of the checks it has carried out.  Micon 
has not independently verified the statements and data contained in historical reports or in 
assay data provided to Micon for the purpose of this mineral resource estimate, other than 
those steps described herein. 
 
 

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
Tully (2005) reports on metallurgical studies undertaken in the late 1980s and in 1999.  The 
following description from Tully (2005) is provided for information purposes only. 
 

"During the middle to late 1980's a number of metallurgical studies were undertaken by 
Lakefield Research on the Curraghinalt mineralization.  Gravity concentration recovered 
variable amounts of gold, ranging from about 15% to over 70% in various tests.  Some of the 
gold in gravity concentrates was coarse and thus might not be suitable for flotation (or to a 
lesser extent for cyanidation).  However, the gravity tails in all cases contained sufficient gold 
to necessitate further treatment.  The results indicated that a gravity circuit would be 
advisable, especially if the principal recovery method were flotation. 
 
"Direct cyanidation of whole ores has also been tested in the past.  Limited test-work on a 
number of samples suggests that overall recoveries in the 90 to 97% range, might be possible.  
The presence of abundant sulphides, especially chalcopyrite, might make this more expensive.  
Present indications are that cyanide consumption might be as much as 3.5 kg per tonne of 
feed. 
 
"Similarly flotation test work has shown that it is possible to produce good grade concentrates 
and achieve high recoveries.  A potential drawback to this method comes from the fact that 
where the feed material has a high sulphide content, the concentration ratio would not be 
particularly attractive.  The preliminary test work suggests that some of the concentrates 
would contain elevated concentrations of a number of deleterious elements such as mercury, 
arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and possibly others.  The concentration of these elements would 
probably not result in unsaleable concentrates, but there might be penalties assessed by a 
smelter. 
 
"During 1999, six vein samples were collected from the underground workings and forwarded 
to International Metallurgical and Environmental Inc. ("IME") for treatment.  The samples 
were collected from the T17 Vein and No. 1 Vein.  The six vein samples were independently 
ground to minus 10-mesh, and a one-half split of each was stored in a sealed, nitrogen-purged 
bag and frozen.  The remaining halves were segregated into high-sulphide (T17 Vein) and 
low-sulphide (No. 1 Vein) groups, each containing three samples.  These were then combined 



 

 98

into composites.  The portion of each composite not required for immediate gravity and 
flotation testing was stored, as reference splits. 
 
"Eleven separate tests were carried out, six on the low sulphide composite and five on the 
high.  In all cases, a Knelson Concentrator gravity concentration step was followed by bulk 
flotation.  In several of the tests, the bulk rougher concentrate was subjected to a cleaning 
stage.  The gravity concentrates were not cleaned, in order to have enough material for 
analysis.  All products, including tails, were analyzed for gold, silver, iron and total sulfur, and 
in several cases for copper.  Selected samples of concentrates and tails from both composites 
were forwarded to Chemex for detailed analyses for various trace elements. 

 
"The results of the above work by IME demonstrated that both mineral composites (high and 
low sulphide content) were amenable to the unit processes of gravity concentration and 
flotation, and that the test results were reproducible. 
 
"Approximately 50% of the gold contained in both samples was recoverable using gravity 
concentration.  The gravity concentrate tailings were subjected to flotation to achieve gold 
recoveries approximating 48% of the metals contained in the process feed.  Thus the total 
recovery of gold in the feed exceeded 97%. 
 
"Silver recoveries approximated 30% in the gravity circuit.  However, high recoveries of 
silver in the flotation circuit resulted in overall silver recoveries approximating 90% and 96% 
from the low and high sulphide composites respectively. 
 
"Saleable concentrates from both composites were produced.  The only element of concern in 
the concentrate that could attract penalties was antimony.  The amount of antimony in the low 
sulphide gravity concentrate was 0.116%, and was 0.362% in the flotation concentrate.  The 
amount of antimony in the high sulphide test concentrate was 0.137% in the gravity 
concentrate, and 0.348% in the flotation concentrate.  These concentrations are not considered 
to constitute a serious problem, but could result in penalties. 
 
"The low sulphide mineralization yields favourable concentration ratios that will minimize 
freight and treatment charges.  Gravity concentrates could be further cleaned and smelted on 
site, or co-mingled with the flotation concentrate. 
 
"The combined gravity and flotation concentrates would grade 150 g/t Au and 80 g/t Ag, 
which is an acceptable grade for shipping.  The grade of the flotation concentrate could be 
possibly improved, with little loss in precious metal recoveries, by including pyrite depression 
in the flotation circuit.  Further test work is required to confirm this." 

 
A report was prepared by M. J. Donoghue in November, 2003, on behalf of Tournigan.  This 
report provides a more detailed review of the metallurgical testwork described above by 
Tully.  
 
No additional metallurgical testing results are available as of the date of this report.  Micon 
understands that Dalradian will be starting a program of additional testwork in the near future.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
14.1 MICON MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
Micon has prepared an estimate of mineral resources for the Curraghinalt deposit using 
geological information and assay data from 301 drill holes and 277 underground channel 
samples.  This section of the report provides the methodology for estimation of the gold 
mineral resource.   
 
Primary, or raw, assay data were composited for gold and were analyzed to determine the 
basic statistical and geostatistical characteristics.  This information has been used in several 
modelling algorithms, which have been compared and checked for validity.  A total of 583 
specific gravity measurements were utilized.  
 
14.2 GEOLOGICAL MODEL 
 
Several mineralized veins have been identified at Curraghinalt and these have been drilled to 
different degrees.  The present resource estimate encompasses all the known mineralized 
veins, which are comprised of 12 major veins, 4 secondary veins and 19 veinlets which 
bifurcate out of the major veins.  
 
For the purpose of resource definition and modelling, each of the identifiable veins was 
designated with a code.  These codes were different from those used previously by Tully for 
the 2005 resource estimate.  The additional veins identified since Tully's mineral resource 
estimate are the result of further drilling and re-interpretation of the data.  A general 
correlation of the previous and present codes is shown in Table 14.1.

The hanging wall and footwall contacts of each of the veins were calculated from the 
identified zone intersection from each drill hole.  Two dimensional (2D) surfaces were then 
created for the hanging wall and footwall of each vein, with an additional extension 30 m to 
40 m beyond the last contact point derived from the drill hole intersection.  A vertical section 
derived from the hanging wall and footwall wireframes is shown in Figure 14.1.  The 
disposition of the different veins is illustrated schematically in Figure 14.2.

14.2.1 Basic Statistics 
 
Basic statistics were calculated for gold for each of the individual veins with statistics 
calculated for the raw, capped and composited samples.  The results are presented in Table 
14.3 through Table 14.10.  The tables show classical statistical parameters (i.e., minimum, 
maximum, mean and standard deviation) for assays, composites and block model grades.  
Statistics on linear metal accumulation are similarly given in Table 14.8 and Table 14.10.  
Both composited samples and estimated blocks are shown in the tables.  Linear metal 
accumulation was calculated for each intersection by multiplying the total length of the 
samples by grade.

14.2.2 Raw Assay Intervals 
 
Samples were selected within the mineralized wireframe for all the veins.  The statistical 
analysis and the resource estimation were carried out using only these samples.  
 
A study on capping of high grade gold assays was carried out.  There are not enough samples 
for each sub-zone (veinlets) to apply capping individually.  All the samples from each veinlet 
were included with the samples from the major veins in order to assess capping for that 
particular vein.   
 



 

 108

While a few of the major veins do not have enough samples to create a probability plot, these 
plots were created for almost all of the major veins and a few of the sub-zones.  The inflection 
point in the probability plot indicates the break in continuity of the distribution for each vein.  
Capping was applied since these inflections indicate the beginning of the outlier population 
for the respective veins.  The details of grade capping including percentile at which capping 
has been applied along with number of samples affected by capping for each vein are given in 
Table 14.11.  The probability plots are shown in Figure 14.3 through Figure 14.13.

Compositing is the first step in mineral resource estimation.  The intersection defined by each 
drill hole for each zone represents the thickness of the quartz vein for that zone.  In places, the 
width of the quartz vein is as low as 10 cm.  It is not possible to carry out uniform length 
compositing with a length of 10 cm, since it would generate a huge number of artificial 
samples which is not supported by the theory of compositing.  A larger composite length on 
the other hand would dilute the grade of the vein.  Under such circumstances, it is better to 
group all the samples from a single drill intersection through a vein into one composite.  The 
problem of variable composite length may be overcome by estimating linear metal 
accumulation rather than grade for the purpose of interpolation.   
 
Compositing was carried out based on the above method.  Linear metal accumulation was 
calculated for each intersection by multiplying the total length of the samples by the grade.  
The classical statistics for linear metal accumulation are given in Table 14.8, above. 
 
14.3 GRADE INTERPOLATION METHOD 
 
14.3.1 Estimation Parameters and Search Distances 
 
The density of drilling in the principal zones of mineralization is generally 30 m by 30 m.  
This drill density, together with good understanding of the geology and mineralization, 
provides a reasonable level of confidence in the resource estimate.  The method of

compositing resulted in a single sample point per intersection.  This results in a two-
dimensional estimation protocol.  The method of compositing has resulted in reduction of the 
nugget effect to a minimum (see semi-variogram in Figure 14.19).  A very low nugget effect 
prompted the selection of the inverse distance method of estimation.  The power was raised to 
5 so that the variation of grade remains local.  The analysis of classical statistics and 
compositing has dictated the selection of the estimation parameters.  The orientation of the 
search ellipse for all the veins along with the estimation parameters are given in Table 14.12 
through to Table 14.14.

14.4 BLOCK MODEL 
 
The block model constructed for the Curraghinalt resource estimate utilized rectangular 
blocks measuring 10 m (X) by 2,000 m (Y) by 5 m (Z) in height.  Although the dimension in 
the Y-direction is unusually long, this was selected with the understanding of the nature of the 
transverse sections of the mineralized zones.  In order to better conform to the mineralization 
contacts, Datamine software uses a system of sub-blocking.  The sub-blocking method used in 
Datamine would result in a single block in the Y-direction conforming to the width of the vein 
and is in line with the method of compositing.  Blocks were permitted to split in the X and Z 
directions.  This procedure minimizes the volume variance between the wireframe model and 
the block model.  This block size was the most appropriate considering the morphology of the 



 

 117

mineralization and the distribution of sample data.  The parameters that describe the block 
model are summarized in Table 14.15.

Block model grade interpolation was performed for gold using inverse distance to the power 
of 5 in different zones.  Concentric search ellipses were used to avoid smearing of grade and 
for preservation of local variation.  Estimations were carried out for both gold, length of the 
samples and linear metal accumulation.  The grades were recalculated from linear metal 
accumulation by dividing it by the estimated length.  This recalculated grade was used for 
resource reporting and was done so in order to carry through the procedure adopted during 
compositing.  
 
14.5 BLOCK MODEL VALIDATION 
 
Validation of the block model included the following: 
 

1. Visual inspection,  
2. Comparison of individual block grades with the de-clustered sample grades at two 

different block sizes and  
3. Alternate estimation method.   

 
1. Visual Inspection 
 
The block model was compared with the drill hole intersection at uniform intervals both 
vertically and along cross section.  No visible bias was observed.  The cross-section, plan 
view (on 170 m RL, the 170 m level, 60 m below surface) and a three-dimensional view of 
the block model are shown in Figure 14.14 through 14.16. 
 
2. Comparison of individual block grades with de-clustered sample grade. 
 
The block model grade interpolation protocol was investigated by inspecting plots of block 
model grades versus mean borehole sample composite grades that occur within each block.  
Mean borehole sample composite grades were calculated for each block using the de-
clustering technique in which the weighted average grade of composites that fall within a 
block is calculated.  This value is compared with the grade interpolated for the block.  A 
successful grade interpolation protocol will result in block grade estimates that demonstrate a 
minimum amount of bias.  Declustering was carried out on block dimensions shown above in 



 

 118

Table 14.15 and with a block dimension of 30 m (X) and 30 m (Z).  This dimension was 
selected as it represents the drilling density.  
 
Plots comparing composite grades and block model grades for all the veins are presented in 
Figure 14.17 and Figure 14.18.  It is apparent from the plots that there is no significant bias.  
The de-clustering analysis demonstrates that the mineral resource model provides a 
reasonable estimate of Curraghinalt mineral resources.   
 
3. Alternate Estimation Method 
 
An experimental semi-variogram was calculated using the samples of vein 60 for linear metal 
accumulation.  The variogram model developed, based on the experimental semi-variogram, 
was used to estimate all the veins using ordinary kriging (Figure 14.19).  All other parameters 
including dimension and orientation of search ellipse and number of samples used for 
estimation were kept constant.  A scatter plot was produced to compare the grade of two 
methods of estimation, as shown in Figure 14.20.  The plot indicates that there may be local 
variation based on the method of estimation but, globally, they will produce similar results.  
 
Based on these three validation checks, it was concluded that the resource model represents a 
reasonable grade estimate of the deposit when compared to the drill hole samples.

14.6 MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
 
Mineral resources were estimated following the CIM guidelines.  The following definitions 
were adopted for the classification of mineral resources.   
 

• Measured mineral resources are defined as those portions of the deposit which has 
underground channel sample within a 15-m radius.  
 

• Indicated mineral resources are defined as those portions of the deposit estimated with 
a drill spacing generally defined by 30 m by 30 m and high level of confidence on 
geological continuity of mineralization.  The limit of indicated resources was 
considered to be 30 m from the last intersecting drill hole with the drill spacing above. 

 
• Inferred mineral resources are defined as those portions of the deposit for which grade 

is interpolated utilizing a wider drill spacing, at places with a 100-m radius,  or fewer 
intersections but with a high level of confidence on the geological continuity of the 
mineralization.  The limit of the inferred resource was considered to be 30 m from the 
last drill hole on the periphery.  

 
Only Veins 40 and 60 were explored by one level of underground development.  Measured 
mineral resources are from only these two veins.  Most of the major veins have been classified 
as indicated and inferred resources.  Veins 80, 90, D and G have been classed as inferred 
since there is insufficient drilling on each for them to be included in the indicated category.  
Sub-zones 55 and 75 have been classified as indicated and inferred resources respectively.  
All the other sub-zones have been classified as inferred resources.  All the veinlets have been 
classified as inferred except Veins 61, 62, 604 and 701 where, at the upper levels, there is 
sufficient drilling to classify some portions as indicated resources.  
 
A vertical longitudinal projection of Vein 60 is given in Figure 14.21 to demonstrate the 
method of resource classification.  Figure 14.22 shows a cross-section of the resource model, 
colour-coded by category of resource.  A plan view (170 m RL) is also presented in Figure 
14.23, with classification of the mineral resource.  A three-dimensional view of the model in 
presented in Figure 14.24.

The grade-tonnage distribution of the Curraghinalt block model is presented in Figure 14.25 
and Figure 14.26.  It is apparent that the deposit maintains a significant profile of measured 
and indicated mineral resources at higher cut-off grades.  The estimated mineral resources at 
different cut-off grades and vein thickness are shown in Table 14.16 and Table 14.17.  It is 
evident from the grade tonnage curves and the tables that there is little resource associated 
with blocks of vein thickness less than 0.1 m.
