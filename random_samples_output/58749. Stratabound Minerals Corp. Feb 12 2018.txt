1 Executive Summary 
	
Marty	Huber,	P.Geo.	(the	"Author")	was	retained	to	write	a	National	Instrument	43‐
101	 Technical	 Report	 (the	 "Report")	 describing	 and	 summarizing	 the	 work	
completed	 to	date	on	 the	 "Golden	Culvert"	 and	 "Little	Hyland"	properties	 in	Yukon	
(collectively	the	"Property").	Information	and	data	for	the	Report	were	obtained	from	
a	site	visit	by	the	Author	on	September	9	and	10,	2017,	as	well	as	an	extensive	study	
of	pertinent	available	technical	information.	
		
The	 Property	 is	 located	 in	 Southeast	 Yukon	 within	 the	 Little	 Hyland	 River	 Valley,	
some	250	kilometres	north	of	Watson	Lake,	Yukon	at	approximately	61°57'00"	North	
Latitude	 and	 128°25'00"	 West	 Longitude.	 The	 Robert	 Campbell	 Highway	 and	 all‐
weather	 Nahanni	 Range	 Road	 provide	 direct	 access	 to	 the	 Property	 from	Watson	
Lake.	
		
The	 Property	 includes	 431	 contiguous,	 un‐surveyed	 mineral	 titles	 that	 cover	 an	
approximate	area	of	83.8	square	kilometres.		The	mineral	titles	are	jointly	recorded	
100%	to	Gary	Lee	and	Robert	Scott	 ("Lee	and	Scott")	 in	 the	case	of	Golden	Culvert	
property	(including	the	Rubus	claims),	and	Gary	Lee,	Robert	Scott	and	Ronald	Stack	
("Lee,	 Scott	 and	 Stack")	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 Little	 Hyland	 property.	 South	 Shore	
Partnership	 Inc.	 ("South	Shore"),	 a	private	 company,	 acquired	an	option	 to	acquire	
the	 Property	 in	 September	 2017	 pursuant	 to	 two	 separate	 option	 agreements	 to	
reflect	 the	 different	 ownership	 of	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	 and	 Little	Hyland	 properties.		
Collectively	 both	 agreements	 constitute	 the	 Property.	 	 	 In	 December	 2017,	 South	
Shore	assigned	its	rights	under	the	two	option	agreements	to	Stratabound	Minerals	
Corp.	("Stratabound").	
		
The	 Golden	 Culvert	 property	 is	 fully	 permitted	 under	 a	 10	 year	 Class	 3	 Land	 Use	
Approval	 No.	 LQ00456	 until	 November	 16,	 2026	 which	 allows	 for	 a	 camp,	 fuel	
storage,	road	and	trail	building,	clearing,	trenching,	drilling,	all	forms	of	sampling	and	
up	 to	a	10,000	 tonne	bulk	 sample.	The	Little	Hyland	property	will	 initially	operate	
under	a	Class	1	program	until	a	Class	3	permit	is	obtained.	
	
The	Property	lies	within	the	Selwyn	Basin	and	is	underlain	by	two	main	lithological	
formations	of	the	Hyland	Group.	The	eastern	part	of	the	Property	is	underlain	by	the	
Upper	Proterozoic	to	Lower	Cambrian	Vampire	Formation	whereas	the	western	part	
of	 the	 Property	 is	 underlain	 by	 Upper	 Proterozoic	 to	 Lower	 Cambrian	 Narchilla	
Formation.	 	 The	 Narchilla	 is	 underlain	 by	 the	 Yusezyu	 formation	 further	 west.	
Intrusive	 rocks	 are	 exposed	 at	 some	 places	 north	 and	 south	 of	 the	 Property	
belonging	to	the	mid‐Cretaceous	Tungsten	Suite.	The	Property	has	not	been	mapped	
in	any	detail.	Prospecting	samples	include	phyllites,	schists	and	argillites.

Previous	work	has	outlined	a	northerly	trending,	3	kilometre	by	250	metre,	+30	ppb	
Au	up	to	791	ppb	Au,	gold‐in‐soil	anomaly	that	remains	open	at	both	ends.	The	soil	
anomaly	 is	 centred	 around	 the	 partially	 exposed	 Golden	 Culvert	 showing	 that	
consists	 of	 primary	 gold‐bearing	 quartz	 veins	 and	 complimentary	 gold	 bearing	
quartz	 vein	 stockwork	within	 a	 larger	 silicified,	 altered,	 sulphide	 and	 gold‐bearing	
wallrock.	 Historical	 grab	 samples	 from	 the	 quartz‐carbonate	 veins	 have	 returned	
values	no	less	than	7.7gpt	Au	and	up	to	22.8gpt	Au	in	quartz	veins	and	up	to	2.58gpt	
Au	 in	 the	 wall	 rock	 phyllites.	 The	 gold	 is	 related	 to	 pyrite	 and	 arsenopyrite	
mineralization.	 	 A	 site	 visit	 completed	 by	 the	 Author	 in	 September	 confirmed	 the	
dimensions	 and	 type	 of	mineralization	 at	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	 showing	 and	 verified	
historical	 gold	 results.	 	 To	 date	 there	 has	 been	 no	 trenching	 or	 drilling	 on	 the	
Property.	
		
Stratabound	 is	 primarily	 exploring	 for	 orogenic‐	 or	 lode‐type	 gold	 mineralization	
similar	 to	 the	 vein‐hosted,	 high‐grade,	 gold	 mineralization	 found	 within	 Hyland	
Group	 sediments	 at	 Golden	 Predator	 Mining	 Corp.'s	 ("Golden	 Predator")	 "3	 Aces"	
project,	 located	 20km	 south	 of	 the	 Property,	 and	 at	 Goldstrike	 Resources	 Ltd.'s	
Plateau	project	located	315km	northwest	of	the	Property.	Exploration	for	this	type	of	
gold	mineralization	must	focus	on	structures	such	as	folds,	shears,	faults,	stockworks	
and	extensional	fractures	that	are	secondary	or	adjacent	to	major	fault	zones.	
		
The	 Property	 merits	 further	 exploration	 work	 based	 on	 the	 general	 prospective	
nature	of	 the	underlying	Hyland	Group	rocks,	 the	veracity	of	previous	gold	 results,	
the	 range	 and	 tenor	 of	 soil	 geochemical	 anomalies	 on	 the	 Property,	 the	 relatively	
good	infrastructure,	the	large	size	of	the	mineral	claim	package,	the	long	strike	extent	
of	 potential	 gold‐bearing	 structures,	 and	 the	 local	 presence	 of	 the	 relatively	 well‐
advanced	3	Aces	project.	
				
The	 Author	 strongly	 recommends	 that	 an	 aggressive	 exploration	 program	 be	
pursued.	A	 first	year	Phase	1	exploration	program	totaling	$842,375	with	a	 follow‐
up,	 second	 year	 Phase	 2	 program	 totaling	 $1,782,500	 are	 recommended	 at	 a	 total	
estimated	cost	of	$2,624,875	over	the	two	years.	
		
The	 proposed	 first	 year	 Phase	 1	 activities	 include	 an	 upgrade	 of	 the	 existing	 2km	
long	ATV	trail	from	the	Nahanni	Range	Road	to	a	4x4	truck	accessible	road	leading	to	
the	 Golden	 Culvert	 showing	 to	 minimize	 helicopter	 support;	 several	 mechanical	
trenches	 at	 and	 along	 strike	 of	 the	 showing	 to	 identify	 the	 extent	 of	 gold‐bearing	
structures	 and	 mineralization;	 800	 grid	 soil	 geochemical	 samples	 to	 evaluate	 the	
Rubus	 block;	 2,000	 grid	 samples	 on	 the	 Hyland	 South	 block	 to	 extend	 the	 2011	
Stakeholder	 grid	 southeast	 from	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	 property;	 and	 600	 metres	 of	
diamond	core	drilling	to	test	the	mineralization	vertical	and	strike	extent	centred	on	
and	 around	 the	main	 showing.	 Also	 recommended	 in	 Phase	 1	 are	 lithological	 and	
structural	 mapping,	 prospecting	 and	 Lidar	 topographic	 surveys	 over	 the	 entire	
Property.

Upon	success	of	Phase	1,	the	recommended	Phase	2	program	would	consist	of	3,000	
grid	samples	on	the	Hyland	North	block,	500	reconnaissance	ridge	and	spur	samples	
on	the	Rubus	Block,	and	800	reconnaissance	ridge	and	spur	samples	on	the	southern	
part	 of	 the	 Hyland	 South	 block,	 plus	 continued	 reconnaissance	 prospecting,	
geological	mapping	and	sampling.		Contingent	upon	suitable	targets	being	generated	
elsewhere	on	the	Property	in	Phase	1,	2,000	metres	of	additional	core	drilling	is	also	
proposed	as	part	of	the	Phase	2	work.	

2 Introduction 
	
The	 Author	 was	 retained	 by	 South	 Shore	 in	 September	 2017	 to	 write	 a	 National	
Instrument	43‐101	technical	report	(the	"Report")	describing	the	Golden	Culvert	and	
Little	 Hyland	 properties	 in	 Yukon.	 The	 responsibility	 for	 completion	 of	 the	 report	
was	assumed	by	Stratabound	as	part	of	the	acquisition	of	the	option.	Information	and	
data	for	the	Report	were	obtained	from	a	site	visit	by	the	Author	on	September	9	and	
10,	2017,	as	well	as	an	examination	of	relevant	reports	and	maps	cited	 throughout	
the	Report.	The	Report	provides	a	review	of	the	publicly	available	information,	and	a	
description	 of	 previous	 assessment	 work	 filed	 on	 the	 Property	 with	 the	 Yukon	
Geological	Survey	database.	Pertinent	technical	information	was	studied	in	sufficient	
detail	to	prepare	this	Report	
	
The	Author	has	visited	and	personally	inspected	the	Property	on	numerous	occasions	
and	is	a	"Qualified	Person"	as	defined	in	Section	1.2	in	and	for	the	purposes	of	NI	43‐
101.	The	Author	is	very	familiar	with	the	Golden	Culvert	property,	having	worked	for	
Stakeholder	in	2011	supervising	a	soil	sampling	program	and	having	co‐authored	a	
report	describing	that	work	program	(Fekete	and	Huber,	2011).	The	Author	has	less	
experience	with	the	Little	Hyland	property	but	has	visited	it	most	recently	on	the	site	
visit	 in	 September	 2017.	 The	 Report	 contains	 specific	 recommendations	 and	
proposes	a	budget	for	further	work.	This	Report	conforms	to	NI	43‐101	standards	of	
disclosure	for	mineral	projects.	
		
The	metric	system	is	used	 for	all	units	of	measure	mentioned	 in	the	Report	and	all	
dollar	amounts	are	in	Canadian	funds	unless	otherwise	stated.	All	figures	presented	
in	the	Report	are	plotted	in	map	projection	UTM	WGS84	Zone	9N	unless	otherwise	
stated.		The	following	abbreviations	are	used	throughout	the	Report:

Stack	 ("Lee,	 Scott	 and	 Stack")	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 Little	 Hyland	 property.	 	 All	 three	
gentlemen	 are	 residents	 of	 Whitehorse,	 Yukon.	 A	 complete	 list	 of	 claims	 for	 the	
Property	is	provided	in	the	YTG	Claim	Status	Report	abstract	located	in	Appendix	I.	
	
South	Shore	obtained	an	option	to	acquire	the	Property	in	September	2017	pursuant	
to	 two	separate	option	agreements	 to	reflect	 the	different	ownership	of	 the	Golden	
Culvert	 and	 Little	 Hyland	 properties.	 	 However,	 the	 claims	 are	 considered	 as	 one	
property	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 operation	 and	 administration.	 	 	 In	 November	 2017,	
South	Shore	assigned	its	rights	under	the	two	option	agreements	to	Stratabound.	The	
Author	has	reviewed	the	agreement	executed	between	Stratabound	and	South	Shore,	
and	the	two	underlying	agreements	between	South	Shore	and	the	Optionors.

4.2 Golden Culvert Agreement 
	
On	 September	 27,	 2017	 South	 Shore	 entered	 into	 the	 "Golden	 Culvert	 Agreement"	
with	Lee	and	Scott.	Under	the	terms	of	the	agreement,	South	Shore	has	the	option	to	
earn	100%	interest	in	Golden	Culvert	property	for	total	consideration	of	$1,000,000	
cash,	and	$350,000	exploration	work	scheduled	over	a	five‐year	period	subject	to	a	
2.0%	 NSR	 royalty	 on	 smeltable	 metals.	 The	 Golden	 Culvert	 block	 consists	 of	 78	
claims	 (Figure	 3).	 Pursuant	 to	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	 Agreement,	 South	 Shore	 having	
made	the	initial	$80,000	signing	payment	to	Lee	and	Scott,	and	subsequently	having	
assigned	the	agreement	to	publicly	traded	Stratabound,	Stratabound	has	the	right	at	
its	discretion	to	make	up	to	50%	of	any	remaining	cash	payments	by	issuing	common	
shares	of	Stratabound	to	Lee	and	Scott.	
	
Additionally,	 under	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	 Agreement,	 South	 Shore	 was	 granted	 the	
exclusive	 right	 to	 acquire	 the	 "Rubus"	 claims	 by	 September	 27,	 2018.	 	 The	 Rubus	
block	 consists	 of	 76	 claims	 (Figure	 4).	 If	 Stratabound,	 as	 South	 Shore's	 assignee,	
chooses	to	exercise	that	right,	 the	Rubus	claims	shall	become	subject	 to	 the	Golden	
Culvert	 Agreement,	 and	 additional	 total	 cash	 payments	 of	 $120,000	 over	 the	
remaining	four	years	of	the	agreement	will	be	required.

4.3 Little Hyland Agreement 
	
On	 September	 27,	 2017	 South	 Shore	 entered	 into	 "Little	 Hyland	 Agreement"	 with	
Lee,	Scott	and	Stack.	Under	the	terms	of	this	agreement,	South	Shore	has	the	option	
to	earn	100%	interest	in	the	property	for	total	consideration	of	$600,000	cash,	and	
$350,000	exploration	work	scheduled	over	a	five‐year	period	subject	to	a	2.1%	NSR	
royalty	 on	 smeltable	 materials.	 The	 Hyland	 North	 (Figure	 5)	 and	 Hyland	 South	
(Figure	6)	claim	blocks	consist	of	149	and	128	claims	respectively	for	a	total	of	277	
claims.	Pursuant	to	the	Little	Hyland	Agreement,	South	Shore	having	made	the	initial	
$45,000	signing	payment	to	Lee,	Scott	and	Stack,	and	subsequently	having	assigned	
the	 agreement	 to	 publicly	 traded	 Stratabound,	 Stratabound	 has	 the	 right	 at	 its	
discretion	 to	make	up	 to	50%	of	any	remaining	cash	payments	by	 issuing	common	
shares	of	Stratabound	to	Lee,	Scott	and	Stack.

4.4 Stratabound Agreement 
	
On	November	30,	2017	Stratabound,	a	public	company	 trading	on	 the	TSX	Venture	
Exchange	under	 the	 symbol	TSXV:SB,	 entered	 into	 an	 agreement	with	 South	 Shore	
(the	"Stratabound	Agreement")	whereby	it	was	assigned	the	Option	on	the	Property.		
On	the	December	15,	2017	closing	of	the	transaction,	Stratabound	issued	12,000,000	
common	 shares	 and	6,000,000	 common	 share	purchase	warrants	 (each	warrant	 is	
exercisable	for	one	common	share	at	$0.075	for	24	months	from	the	date	of	issue)	to	
South	 Shore	 and	 made	 a	 cash	 payment	 of	 $100,000.	 Another	 cash	 payment	 of	
$100,000	will	be	due	 to	South	Shore	on	April	15,	2017.	Exercise	of	 the	Option	will	
require	 payments	 of	 $1,595,000	 to	 the	 Optionors	 and	 work	 commitments	 of	
$700,000	over	a	five‐year	period.	Future	production	will	be	subject	to	NSR	royalties	
aggregating	to	2.5%	payable	to	the	Optionors	and	South	Shore.

4.5 Background on Yukon Mining Legislation 
	
The	mineral	claims	included	in	the	Property	were	acquired	under	the	Yukon	Quartz	
Mining	Act	which	grants	only	the	hard	rock	mineral	rights	 to	 the	claim	holder.	The	
surface	 rights	 for	 the	 area	of	 the	Property	 are	held	by	 the	Crown.	To	maintain	 the	
claims	 in	 good	 standing,	 a	minimum	 of	 $100	 assessment	 work	 per	 claim	must	 be	
completed	annually.				There	are	provisions	to	apply	for	more	than	one	year	work	at	a	
time	up	to	a	maximum	of	five	years,	to	apply	work	from	one	claim	to	other	adjoining	
claims	(grouping)	up	to	a	maximum	of	750	contiguous	claims,	and	to	pay	cash	in	lieu	
of	 work	 up	 to	 a	 maximum	 of	 five	 years.	 The	 Yukon	 Quartz	 Mining	 Land	 Use	
Regulations	 consist	 of	 a	 classification	 system	 based	 on	 varying	 levels	 of	 specific	
activities.	These	threshold	levels	categorize	exploration	activities	into	four	classes	of	
operation.	Classes	1	through	4	represent	activities	with	increasing	potential	to	cause	



	 	

 10

adverse	 environmental	 impacts.	 In	 the	 specific	 case	 of	 the	 Ross	 River	 Area	 that	
includes	 the	 Property,	 the	 Yukon	 Territorial	 Government	 has	 applied	 relief	 from	
annual	assessment	work	obligations	(valid	until	 January	31,	2019	in	the	Ross	River	
Area)	 to	 active	 quartz	 and	 placer	 claim	 holders	 during	 the	 mineral	 staking	
prohibition	(see	Section	4.6).	
	
Activities	within	a	Class	1	program	are	defined	as	"grassroots"	exploration	with	low	
potential	 to	 cause	 adverse	 environmental	 effects,	 and	 where	 activities	 and	
reclamation	 are	 completed	 within	 a	 year.	 A	 Class	 1	 program	 generally	 does	 not	
require	 an	 assessment	 under	 the	 Yukon	 Environmental	 and	 Socio	 Economic	
Assessment	 Act	 or	 government	 approval,	 but	 the	 operator	 must	 comply	 with	 the	
certain	 operating	 conditions.	 	 In	 certain	 designated	 areas	 of	 Yukon	 including	 the	
"Ross	 River	 Class	 1	 Notification	 Area"	where	 the	 Property	 is	 located,	 the	 operator	
must	 notify	 the	 Yukon	 Territorial	 Government	 of	 its	 plans	 for	 Class	 1	 mining	
exploration	work.	
	

Figure	6:	Little	Hyland	South	claim	block



	 	

 11

	
Class	 2	 programs	 are	 considered	 to	 represent	 the	 upper	 level	 of	 "grassroots"	
exploration	 activities.	 A	 notification	 submitted	 through	 the	 Yukon	 Territorial	
Government	Mining	Lands	Office	which	outlines	the	activities	and	how	the	area	will	
be	reclaimed	 is	required.	These	programs	comprise	activities	 that	have	a	moderate	
potential	 to	 cause	 adverse	 environmental	 effects	 and	 therefore	 require	 an	
assessment	through	YESAA.	All	work	and	reclamation	must	be	completed	within	one	
year.		
	
All	Class	3	and	Class	4	programs	require	submission	of	a	detailed	"Operating	Plan"	to	
the	 Yukon	 Territorial	 Government	 Mining	 Lands	 Office.	 A	 YESAA	 assessment	 is	
required.	The	Operating	Plan	must	be	approved	before	any	exploration	activities	can	
be	 undertaken.	 An	 Operating	 Plan	 may	 entail	 multi‐year	 exploration	 programs	 to	
allow	greater	flexibility	for	the	operator.		
	
The	 Golden	 Culvert	 property	 has	 a	 10‐year	 Class	 3	 Land	 Use	 Approval	 valid	 to	
November	16,	2026	(No.	LQ00456)	that	allows	for	a	camp,	access	roads,	 trenching,	
diamond	drilling	and	bulk	sampling.		The	Little	Hyland	property	will	initially	operate	
under	a	Class	1	program.		
	
Additional	 information	 regarding	 exploration	 classification	 system	 and	 activities	
allowed	can	be	found	online	at	www.yesab.ca	

4.6 Land Claims in South East Yukon 
	
In	 December	 2013	 the	 Yukon	 government	 issued	 an	 Order	 in	 Council	 ("O.I.C.")	
prohibiting	entry	on	to	lands	in	the	Ross	River	Area	(Figure	7)	in	order	to	facilitate	
discussions	between	the	Ross	River	Dena	Council	and	the	YTG	regarding	land	claim	
settlement.	As	such,	a	moratorium	on	additional	staking	for	quartz	and	placer	claims	
was	 put	 in	 place	 until	 such	 time	 as	 negotiations	 between	 the	 two	 parties	 are	
completed.		
	
Importantly	 any	 recorded	 claims	 in	 good	 standing	 at	 the	 time	 the	 O.I.C.	 was	
implemented	are	exempt	from	this	O.I.C.		Additionally,	the	expiry	date	for	any	claims	
in	good	standing	will	be	adjusted	every	year	as	the	negotiations	continue.	Holders	of	
claims	in	good	standing	have	free	access	to	their	properties	subject	to	other	normal	
governmental	regulations	including	full	allowance	to	proceed	through	their	intended	
course	and	purpose	for	potential	mine	permitting	as	any	otherwise	recorded	quartz	
claim	in	good	standing.	 	 	All	quartz	claims	held	under	the	Golden	Culvert	and	Little	
Hyland	agreements	were	 in	good	standing	prior	 to	 the	 implementation	of	 the	O.I.C.	
and	are	therefore	not	subject	to	the	O.I.C.	There	are	otherwise	no	restrictions	on	the	
development	of	the	Property	for	potential	mine	permitting.	
	
	
	



	 	

 12

The	moratorium	 on	 additional	 claim	 staking	 in	 the	 Ross	 River	 offers	 a	 somewhat	
unique	 exploration	 opportunity.	 	 No	 competitive	 staking	may	 be	 done	 around	 the	
existing	exempted	claims	during	the	period	of	the	O.I.C.				This	will	allow	Stratabound	
to	develop	the	project	with	proprietary	firsthand	knowledge	to	capitalize	on	eventual	
expansion	opportunities.			
	
An	 excerpt	 of	 the	O.I.C.	 as	 it	 pertains	 to	 recorded	 claims	 is	 outlined	 below	 (Yukon	
Territorial	Government,	2013).	
	

Purpose		
1.	The	purpose	of	this	Order	is	to	prohibit	entry	on	the	lands	described	in	Schedule	A	to	facilitate	
continuing	consultation	with	the	Ross	River	Dena	Council.		
(Section	1	amended	by	O.I.C.	2015/162)		
Interpretation

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and 
Physiography 

5.1 Accessibility 
	
Access	 to	 the	Property	 is	 relatively	good	(Figure	8)	compared	 to	other	parts	of	 the	
Watson	 Lake	Mining	 District	 as	 it	 is	 reachable	 via	 the	 all‐weather	 Nahanni	 Range	
Road	that	 leads	 to	 the	historic	mining	village	of	Tungsten	 located	 in	 the	Northwest	
Territories	 10	 kilometres	 east	 of	 the	 Property.	 The	 Nahanni	 Range	 Road	 crosses	
directly	through	the	middle	of	the	claim	group,	and	the	Property	is	located	between	
the	 157	 and	 175	 kilometer	 markers	 measured	 from	 the	 turn	 off	 from	 Robert	
Campbell	Highway.		From	this	turnoff	it	is	110km	south	to	the	town	of	Watson	Lake	
(Population	900)	located	on	the	Alaska	Highway	(Highway	3).	Access	to	most	parts	of	
the	Property	is	by	helicopter.				



	 	

 14

	
Over	 $360	million	 in	 combined	 federal	 and	 territorial	 funding	 was	 announced	 on	
September	2,	2017	to	improve	road	access	in	the	Yukon	including	the	Nahanni	Range	
Road.	 	This	infrastructure	program	will	upgrade	road	surfaces,	and	build	or	replace	
numerous	bridges,	culverts,	and	stream	crossings.

Note	Nahanni	Range	Road	passing	through	western	edge	of	Property

5.2 Climate 
	
The	Little	Hyland	River	Valley	typically	has	higher	annual	precipitation	compared	to	
the	 rest	 of	 the	 Yukon	 with	 approximately	 450mm.	 Snow	 generally	 begins	 to	
accumulate	in	the	alpine	areas	in	late	September	and	begins	receding	in	early	May.	In	
the	summer	months	temperatures	can	be	as	high	as	+30°C	and	in	the	winter	months	
as	low	as	‐50°C.	Due	to	the	northerly	latitude	of	the	region,	summer	days	are	long	and	
winter	days	very	short.	The	best	season	for	exploration	is	during	the	summer	months	
from	 mid‐May	 to	 mid‐October.	 Although	 it	 is	 possible	 to	 work	 during	 the	 winter	
months,	 costs	 rise	 exponentially	 due	 to	 cold	 temperatures,	 inclement	weather	 and	
short	daylight	hours.	
	
	
	
	
	



	 	

 15

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
	
The	 Property	 is	 located	 in	 an	 isolated	 part	 of	 Yukon	 with	 relatively	 few	 local	
resources	or	infrastructure.	The	Property	must	be	worked	from	an	exploration	camp	
set	up	on	or	near	the	Property.	A	camp	can	be	supported	from	Watson	Lake,	where	
generally	most	 goods	 and	 services	 are	 available,	 or	 from	Whitehorse	 where	 a	 full	
range	 of	 services	 are	 available	 including	 line‐cutting,	 geophysics,	 drilling,	 assaying,	
aircraft	charters	etc.		It	is	an	enormous	advantage	that	fuel,	equipment,	supplies	and	
personnel	 can	 be	 delivered	 from	Watson	 Lake	 on	 the	 all‐weather	 Nahanni	 Range	
Road.		

5.4 Physiography 
	
The	Property	is	situated	in	the	northwest	trending	Logan	Mountains	along	the	border	
between	Yukon	and	 the	Northwest	Territories.	The	 topography	 is	characterized	by	
broad,	 U‐shaped	 valleys	 separated	 by	 steep	 sloped	mountainous	 peaks	 and	 ridges.	
Elevations	on	the	Property	range	from	1200	to	2000	metres	above	sea	level.	Most	of	
the	Property	lies	above	the	tree‐line	where	steeper	slopes	are	covered	by	talus	and	
felsenmeer	and	the	flatter	areas	are	covered	by	typical	alpine	moss	and	lichens.	Thick	
willow,	 dwarf	 birch	 and	 alder	brush	mark	 the	 tree‐line	 and	 lower	 elevations	 show	
patchy	scrub	forests	of	fir,	spruce	and	pine.

6 History 

6.1 General Statement 
	
The	 region	 has	 a	 long	 history	 of	 exploration	 beginning	 with	 the	 discovery	 of	 the	
Cantung	Mine	 in	1954	and	the	 initiation	of	production	 in	1962.	The	Golden	Culvert	
and	Little	Hyland	project	area,	however,	does	not	have	a	considerable	documented	
history	of	exploration,	prior	to	the	activities	of	Mr.	Scott	and	his	subsequent	partners.		
	
The	 YGS	 MINFILE	 database	 lists	 two	 mineral	 occurrences	 within	 the	 Property	
including	 the	 "Golden	Culvert"	and	 "Ricardo"	 showings	 (Table	2).	 	There	are	also	a	
number	of	undocumented	showings	located	on	the	Little	Hyland	Property	including	
the	 "Road",	 "Camp"	 and	 "Dull	 Spur"	 (Figure	 10).	 	 There	 has	 also	 been	 some	work	
done	 on	 the	 Rubus	 claim	 block.	 	 Total	 documented	 expenditures	 on	 the	 Property	
amount	to	$564,417	(Table	3).

6.2 Golden Culvert 
	
Placer	gold	was	first	found	on	the	Golden	Culvert	property	by	Robert	Scott	in	1984	at	
a	culvert	under	the	Nahanni	Range	Road.	Stream	sediment	sampling	and	subsequent	
prospecting	 led	 to	 the	 discovery	 of	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	 main	 showing	 in	 2008	
(Casselman,	 2008).	 The	 showing,	 consisting	 of	 quartz	 vein‐hosted	 gold	
mineralization,	 is	 located	 in	 the	 creek	 draining	 the	 southeastern	 corner	 of	 the	
Property	approximately	2.5km	east	 from	the	Nahanni	Range	Road.	The	 first	quartz	
claims	were	staked	in	2005.	From	2006	to	2008	additional	stream	sediment,	soil	and	
rock	sampling	was	completed	 (Casselman,	2007	and	Casselman,	2009),	 followed	 in	
2009	by	line	cutting,	limited	ground	magnetic	and	VLF‐type	electromagnetic	surveys,	
pop‐hole	blasting,	and	soil	and	rock	sampling	(Casselman	and	Halle,	2010a).

Figure	11:	Looking	northwest	at	Main	Showing	and	baseline (Casselman	and	Halle	2010a)	
		

In	 regards	 to	 the	geophysical	work,	 the	 report	 concluded	 that	 in	 the	vicinity	of	 the	
main	 showing,	 the	magnetic	 and	 VLF	 response	 support	 the	 orientation	 of	 the	 soil	
anomaly	 trend,	 shown	 to	 be	 parallel	 to	 the	majority	 of	 known,	mineralized	 quartz	
veins	 (Figure	13).	 	Possible	northeast‐trending	 structures	 shown	by	 the	magnetics,	
(Figure	 12)	 may	 also	 mimic	 the	 emerging	 conjugate	 vein	 set	 on	 the	 property.		
Unexplained	 broad	 magnetic	 gradients	 may	 be	 representing	 differences	 in	
lithology/alteration,	or	a	buried	intrusion.

Casselman	 and	Halle	 (2010a)	 report	 large	 scale	 sheeted	 quartz	 veins	 on	 the	 north	
end	of	the	Golden	Culvert	on	a	steep	cliff	face	approximately	2km	north	along	strike	
of	the	main	showing.			The	cliff	face	has	neither	been	sampled	nor	mapped	due	to	the	
extreme	slope	conditions.	An	unmapped	fold	axis	was	also	identified	approximately	
300m	east	of	 the	main	 showing.	 	 	 These	 structural	 features	 are	 important	because

In	2010,	the	Golden	Culvert	property	was	optioned	to	Stakeholder	Gold	Corp.	by	Lee	
and	 Scott.	 Stakeholder	 completed	 an	 extensive	 soil	 survey	 which	 essentially	
blanketed	the	entire	Golden	Culvert	claim	package	on	100	metre	lines	with	50	metre	
sample	 intervals.	 Although	most	 of	 the	 previous	work	 completed	 by	 Lee	 and	 Scott	
was	to	the	north	of	the	Main	Showing,	Stakeholder	outlined	a	well‐defined	"gold‐in‐
soil"	 anomaly	 (Figures	 16	 and	 17)	 that	 showed	 strong	 indications	 that	 surface	
prospecting	could	find	additional	surface	gold	showings	to	the	southeast	of	the	main	
Golden	Culvert	showing	(Fekete	and	Huber,	2011).

6.3 Ricardo 
	
The	Ricardo	showing	is	found	on	the	Little	Hyland	claims	approximately	3km	south	
of	the	Golden	Culvert	main	showing.	 	 It	 is	described	in	the	MINFILE	database	as	an	
unmineralized	 ferricrete	 gossan	 occurring	within	 an	 area	 underlain	 by	 Cretaceous	
granodiorite	 that	 intrudes	Cambrian	slates	and	phyllites.	The	gossan	was	originally	
staked	by	Canada	Tungsten	Mining	Corporation	Ltd.	 in	1961.	There	 is	no	record	of	
Canada	 Tungsten	 doing	 any	 additional	work	 and	 its	 claims	were	 allowed	 to	 lapse.	
The	Ricardo	Showing	was	later	re‐staked	by	Mr.	A.	Black	in	1980	as	the	Kay	claims,	
and	then	in	1981	as	the	Lynx	claims	by	Mr.	E.	Broadhagen.	In	each	case	there	is	no	
record	of	work	being	performed	and	the	respective	claims	were	allowed	to	lapse.	

6.4 Little Hyland 
	
The	 Little	 Hyland	 project	 is	 made	 up	 of	 two	 claim	 blocks,	 divided	 by	 the	 Golden	
Culvert	 block.	 Previous	 work	 on	 the	 claims	 was	 first	 conducted	 by	 Lee,	 Scott	 and	
Stack	 in	 2009	 who	 completed	 soil	 sampling,	 stream	 sediment	 and	 prospecting	
surveys	in	2010	(Casselman	and	Halle,	2010b).	This	work	led	to	the	identification	of	
the	 "Road"	showing	 in	 the	northwest	corner	of	 the	Little	Hyland	North	claim	block	
(Figure	10).		In	2011	Commander	Resources	Ltd.	optioned	the	Little	Hyland	property	
(originally	named	the	"Glenmorangie"	property),	and	over	2011	and	2012	completed	
soil	 geochemical	 sampling,	 stream	 sediment	 sampling,	 prospecting,	 and	 a	mapping	
survey	 (Potts,	 2012	 and	 Potts	 and	McKenzie,	 2013).	 	 The	 "Camp"	 and	 "Dull	 Spur"	
zones	were	identified	from	the	2012	soil	sampling	(Figure	10).	

6.5 Rubus 
	
The	Rubus	 claims	were	 staked	by	Lee	 and	Scott	 in	2010	with	minimal	 exploration	
completed	to	date.	In	2010	Lee	and	Scott	completed	soil	sampling,	stream	sediment	
sampling,	prospecting	and	geophysical	surveys	on	 the	claims.	The	stream	sediment	
sampling	identified	anomalous	arsenic	values	over	significant	distances	in	two	of	the	
streams	located	in	the	central	portion	of	the	claim	block	(Casselman,	2011).

7.1 Geology of Southeastern Yukon 
	
The	following	geological	description	is	a	derived	directly	from	Casselman	and	Halle	
(2010a),	and	was	originally	sourced	from	regional	compilation	maps	by	Gordey	and	
Makepeace	(2000)	and	descriptions	by	Héon	(2007)	and	Hart	(2002).

7.2 Regional Geology 
	
The	Golden	Culvert	and	Little	Hyland	properties	are	 located	 in	 the	Selwyn	Basin	 in	
the	 southeastern	 Yukon	 (Figure	 19).	 The	 Selwyn	 Basin	 is	 part	 of	 the	 cordilleran	
miogeocline	and	is	characterized	by	thick	accumulations	of	clastic	sediments,	with	a	
significant	 component	 of	 deep	water	 black	 shales	 and	 cherts	 (Héon,	 2007).	 These	
basinal	 rocks	 interfinger	 with	 and	 are	 bound	 by	 shallower‐water	 platformal	
carbonates.	The	Selwyn	Basin	is	bound	to	the	north	by	the	Dawson	Fault,	grades	into	
platformal	facies	to	the	east	(Mackenzie	Platform)	and	southwest	(Cassiar	Platform),	
may	be	bound	by	a	Mesozoic	thrust	fault	separating	it	from	Yukon‐Tanana	Terrane	in	
the	Anvil	district,	and	is	offset	to	the	southwest	by	the	Tintina	Fault.	The	sediments	
range	in	age	from	Precambrian	to	Jurassic	(Héon,	2007)	and	lie	within	the	Omineca	
Belt	of	the	Northern	Cordillera	(Hart,	2002).

and	Sack,	2018)	
The	Hyland	Group	is	the	thickest	sequence	in	Basin	and	occupies	the	core	of	Selwyn	fold‐thrust	belt	
	
The	 Little	 Hyland	 River	 valley	 is	 entirely	 underlain	 by	 Neoproterozoic	 to	 Lower	
Cambrian	Hyland	Group	clastic	sedimentary	rocks.		The	Hyland	Group	is	the	thickest	
sequence	in	the	Selwyn	Basin	and	shows	the	largest	areal	extent.	The	eastern	part	of	
the	 valley	 (Figure	 20)	 is	 underlain	 by	 dark	brown,	 fine‐grained	 and	 thinly‐bedded,	
argillaceous	 sandstone	 and	 siltstone	 with	minor,	 interbedded,	 medium‐	 to	 coarse‐
grained,	white	to	light	grey	orthoquartzite,	phyllite,	slate	and	argillite	of	the	Vampire	
Formation	(uPCV1).	The	western	part	of	 the	valley	 is	underlain	by	 thinly	 to	 thickly	
bedded	maroon	and	green	argillites,	grey	shales	and	lesser	grits	and	sandstone	of	the	
dominantly	 Lower	Cambrian	Narchilla	 Formation	 (PCH3).	 	 Further	 to	 the	west	 the	
Narchilla	is	underlain	by	brown	to	pale	green	shale,	quartz‐rich	sandstone,	grit,	and		
pebble	conglomerate	of	the	dominantly	Neoproterozoic	Yusezyu	Formation	(PCH1).

Figure	20:	Generalized	Stratigraphic	column	for	thr	Upper	Hyland	River	area	(Hart	and	Lewis,	2006)
	
The	eastern	part	of	the	area	is	intruded	by	resistant,	blocky,	fine‐	to	coarse‐grained,	
equigranular	 to	porphyritic	 rocks	 ranging	 from	K‐feldspar	porphyry,	 biotite‐quartz	
monzonite	and	granodiorite	with	minor	quartz	diorite,	 leuco‐quartz	monzonite	and	
syenite	 of	 the	 mid‐Cretaceous	 Tungsten	 Suite	 (mKgTu).	 	 These	 are	 less	 prevalent	
moving	westward	and	are	generally	absent	in	the	Little	Hyland	valley.	
	
Structurally	 the	 Hyland	 Group	 is	 deformed	 into	 a	 series	 of	 moderately	 shallowly	
southwest‐dipping	overturned	folds	locally	cut	by	thrust	faults	and	occupies	the	core	
of	the	Selwyn	Fold‐Thrust	Belt	(Figure	22).	 	This	regional	deformation	gives	rise	to	
an	 overall	 phyllitic	 to	 weakly	 micaceous	 rock	 fabric	 that	 is	 generally	 northwest‐
trending	and	shallowly	 to	moderately	 steep‐dipping.	 	The	 fabric	 is	more	 intense	 in	
the	southwest	but	gradually	gives	way	to	more	slaty	cleavages	to	the	northwest.	
	
Numerous	 small	 north‐	 to	 northwest‐trending	 normal	 faults	 with	 limited	
displacement	cross‐cut	 the	Hyland	Group	stratigraphy,	and	are	marked	by	straight,	
short	 valleys	 at	 the	macro‐scale	 and	 north‐	 to	 northwest	 trending	 lineation	 at	 the	
outcrop	scale.	 	These	faults	are	in	turn	cut	by	northeast‐trending	normal	faults	that	
generally	control	secondary	drainages.	
	
Hart	and	Lewis	(2006)	proposed	the	presence	of	the	March	Fault	along	the	western	
boundary	of	the	Property	parallel	to	the	40km‐long	Little	Hyland	River	valley	based	
on	extrapolation	of	this	structure	from	previous	mapping	done	further	north	(Gordey	
and	Anderson,	1993),	 interpretations	 in	Gordey	and	Makepeace	(2003)	and	 limited	
reconnaissance	mapping	(Figure	21).	They	suggested	the	March	Fault	as	a	northeast‐
directed	thrust	placing	the	Narchilla	formation	to	the	west	over	the	time	equivalent	
Vampire	 formation	 to	 the	 east,	 and	 cited	 the	 distinctive	 lithological	 difference	 of	
coarse‐clastic	strata	in	the	Narchilla	Formation	as	evidence	for	this.	Moynihan	(2017)	
suggests	 that	 the	March	 Fault	 may	 instead	 be	 a	 dextral	 strike‐slip	 fault	 of	 limited	
displacement,	and	in	the	Little	Hyland	River	valley,	may	not	exist	at	all.	



	 	

 28

	
It	is	often	contended	that	the	mid‐Cretaceous	Tungsten	Suite	intrusions	have	driven	
gold‐bearing	 mineralizing	 fluids	 within	 the	 Upper	 Hyland	 River	 region,	 but	 the	
majority	 of	 gold	 occurrences	 found	 in	 the	 area	 to	 date	 show	no	 proximal	 or	 distal	
features	normally	associated	to	intrusive	activity.		Hart	and	Lewis	(2006)	suggested	
that	 the	 proximity	 of	 the	 gold	 showings	 to	 large	 crustal	 scale,	 northwest‐trending	
structures,	 and	 orogenic	 characteristics	 of	 some	 the	 host	 quartz‐carbonate	 veins	
supports	a	non‐magmatic	origin.	
	
Although	 the	 existence	 or	 relative	 displacement	 of	 the	 large‐scale	 March	 Fault	 is	
debatable,	 it	 seems	 clear	 that	 gold‐bearing	 fluids	 generated	 by	 regional	 prograde	
metamorphism	have	been	 spread	 along	 larger,	 northwest‐trending	 faults	 and	 folds	
related	to	metamorphic	activity,	and	subsequently	remobilized	into	secondary	north‐	
and	northeast‐trending	structures.		This	type	of	gold	mineralization	is	fundamentally	
orogenic	in	nature	as	discussed	in	Section	8	below.	
	
Hart	and	Lewis	(2006)	and	Moynihan	and	Sack	(2018)	emphasize	that	gold‐bearing	
quartz	veins	within	 the	Hyland	Group	marine	metasedimentary	rocks	cross‐cut	 the	
regional	metamorphic	fabric	and	are	relatively	late	in	structural	history,	are	likely	to	
be	 adjacent	 to	 large	 strike‐slip	 features,	 and	 are	 located	 at	 the	 boundary	 between	
upper	crustal,	upright	 folded	sequences	and	deeper,	highly	deformed	orogenic	core	
zones.	 	What	 also	 seems	 important	 for	 gold	mineralization	 is	 lithological	 contacts	
that	 juxtapose	 coarse‐grained	sequences	 (e.g.	 grits,	 sandstones	and	conglomerates)	
against	fine‐grained	sequences	(e.g.	phyllites).

7.3 Property Geology 
	
The	Property	has	not	been	mapped	in	any	detail	by	the	Author.	Sample	descriptions	
of	 rocks	 collected	by	 the	previous	workers	outlined	 in	assessment	 reports	 indicate	
that	 the	 Property	 is	 generally	 underlain	 by	 interlayered	 phyllites,	 schists	 and	
argillites	 (Casselman	 and	 Halle,	 2010a	 and	 Potts,	 2013).	 Locally	 grits	 (sandstone)	
have	 been	 identified	 as	 well	 as	 mafic	 and	 felsic	 intrusive	 rocks.	 Strong	 sericite,	
carbonate	and	phyllic	(muscovite)	alteration	is	often	noted	in	the	wall	rocks	adjacent	
to	quartz‐carbonate	veins	such	as	at	the	Golden	Culvert	showing.	Other	quartz	veins	
are	 noted	 in	 outcrop	 and	 talus	 which	 appear	 to	 be	 more	 bull	 white	 quartz	 with	
minimal	mineralization	and	possibly	associated	with	metamorphic	events.	
	
Compilation	work	 by	Gordey	 and	Makepeace	 (2003)	 indicates	 that	 the	 Property	 is	
underlain	 by	 two	 main	 lithological	 units	 separated	 by	 the	 regional	 northwest	
trending	 March	 Fault	 that	 follows	 the	 Little	 Hyland	 Valley	 (Figure	 21).	 	 Hart	 and	
Lewis	(2006)	inferred	that	the	potential	for	gold	mineralization	was	only	west	of	the	
March	 Fault	 in	 the	 Narchilla	 and	 Yusezyu	 formations.	 	 This	 conclusion	 was	
overturned	by	the	later	discovery	of	the	Golden	Culvert	showing	on	the	east	side	of	
the	 fault	 within	 the	 Vampire	 Formation.	 Moynihan	 (2017)	 calls	 into	 question	 the	
existence	 of	 the	 March	 Fault	 suggesting	 instead	 that	 the	 contact	 along	 the	 Little	
Hyland	River	may	be	a	facies	change	between	the	Narchilla	and	Vampire	formations.	
	



	 	

 31

Intrusive	rocks	belonging	to	the	mid‐Cretaceous	Tungsten	Suite	are	exposed	mainly	
in	 the	 southern	portions	of	 the	Property.	These	 rocks	 include	K‐feldspar	porphyry,	
biotite	monzonite	 and	 granodiorite.	 Regional	 airborne	magnetic	 data	 suggests	 that	
these	intrusive	rocks	may	be	more	extensive	and	may	underlie	much	of	the	layered	
rocks	in	the	area.	The	magnetic	data	also	shows	that	numerous	moderate	to	strong,	
northwest‐trending	 magnetic	 features	 transect	 the	 Property.	 Casselman	 and	 Halle	
(2010a)	 suggest	 that	 these	 may	 be	 caused	 by	 sharp	 lithological,	 alteration	 or	
structural	contacts.		

7.4 Mineralization 

7.4.1 Golden Culvert 
	
The	 Golden	 Culvert	 showing	 (Figure	 23),	 located	 in	 the	 creek	 draining	 the	 central	
portion	of	 the	Property	approximately	2.5km	 from	 the	Nahanni	Range	Road,	 is	 the	
most	 significant	 gold	 occurrence	 found	 on	 the	 Property	 to	 date.	 This	 showing	
consists	of	a	series	of	primary,	northwest‐trending,	quartz‐carbonate	veins,	each	up	
to	one	metre	wide,	hosted	 in	 intensely	altered	phyllites	(Figure	25).	Historical	grab	
samples	from	the	quartz‐carbonate	veins	at	the	showing	have	returned	values	up	to	
22.8gpt	 Au	 (Casselman	 and	 Halle,	 2010a).	 The	 gold	 appears	 to	 be	 related	 to	
arsenopyrite	 mineralization	 that	 ranges	 from	 semi‐massive,	 fine‐grained	 fracture	
fillings	 to	 medium‐grained	 disseminations	 to	 local	 clusters	 of	 euhedral	 needles	
(Figure	26),	 and	medium	 to	 coarse‐grained	euhedral	pyrite	 (Figure	27).	Casselman	
and	 Halle	 (2010a)	 also	 reported	 gold	 values	 up	 to	 1.28gpt	 Au	 from	 mineralized	
outcrops	of	phyllite	that	lack	quartz‐carbonate	veins	(Figure	29).	
	

	
	Figure	23:	Panoramic	view	of	Golden	Culvert	showing	area	(looking	west).		Author	is	in	foreground

	
Structurally,	the	quartz‐carbonate	veins	at	the	Golden	Culvert	showing	are	typically	
subvertical,	 and	 show	 at	 least	 two	 main	 orientations	 generally	 striking	 at	 260°	
(Figure	27)	and	305°	(Figure	25).	The	Author	also	observed	shallow	dipping,	sheeted	
extension	veinlets	that	strike	parallel	to	the	main	veins	mentioned	above.		A	third	set	
of	veins	approximately	perpendicular	to	above	mentioned	orientations	was	noted	by	
Stratabound	personnel	but	not	observed	by	the	Author.		Together	these	various	vein	
sets	form	a	sort	of	quartz‐carbonate	stockwork	within	a	zone	of	phyllites	marked	by	
strong,	pervasive	silica	alteration	and	disseminated	sulphide	mineralization,	that	is	at	
least	30	metres	wide	over	10	metres	of	exposed	strike	length.

Elsewhere	 a	 grab	 sample	 collected	 by	 the	 Author	 returned	 an	 assay	 of	 7.16gpt	 Au	
from	an	outcrop	of	silicified	phyllite	with	quartz	veinlets	and	disseminated	sulphides	
situated	approximately	100	metres	south	of	 the	showing	(Figure	30).	This	suggests	
that	there	is	a	least	some	strike	extent	to	the	Golden	Culvert	mineralization.	
	
The	Golden	Culvert	showing	is	marked	in	a	broader	sense	by	a	northwest‐trending,	
"gold‐in‐soil"	 anomaly	 outlined	 by	 previous	workers	 (Casselman	 and	Halle,	 2010a,	
and	Fekete	and	Huber	2011).		The	anomaly	is	defined	by	values	greater	than	30ppb	
Au	with	maximum	values	up	to	791ppb	Au.		It	is	up	to	250	metres	wide	and	extends	
3,000	metres	northwest	from	the	southern	boundary	of	the	Golden	Culvert	property,	
but	 remains	 open	 in	 both	 directions	 (Figure	 35).	 The	 gold	 anomaly	 shows	 various	
correlations	and	is	sometimes	coincident	with	arsenic,	copper	and	silver	patterns.	
	
Casselman	and	Halle	(2010a)	concluded	that	gold‐bearing	structures	exposed	at	the	
Golden	Culvert	showing	had	more	potential	 to	continue	to	northwest,	based	on	the	
available	 soil	 geochemical,	 prospecting	 and	 geophysical	 data.	 	 Fekete	 and	 Huber	
(2011)	 suggested	 that	 the	 area	 southeast	 of	 the	 showing	 was	 more	 prospective,	
based	on	the	stronger,	more	continuous	geochemical	trend	outlined	in	2011.

7.4.2 Green Dragon 
	
During	the	Author's	September	2017	Property	visit,	a	new	quartz‐carbonate	vein	was	
discovered	on	the	south	block	of	the	Little	Hyland	property	about	50	metres	south	of	
the	 south	 boundary	 of	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	 property.	 	 The	 showing	was	 found	 as	 a	
result	of	prospecting	the	soil	geochemical	anomaly	outlined	by	Stakeholder	in	2011	
(Fekete	and	Huber,	2011).		The	vein	contains	minor	disseminated	chalcopyrite,	and	is	
marked	 by	 green	 malachite	 staining.	 	 Hence	 it	 was	 named	 the	 "Green	 Dragon"	
showing.	 	The	vein	is	2	to	3	metres	wide	where	exposed	and	was	traced	on	surface	
for	 a	 distance	 of	 about	 20	metres	 in	 a	 northwesterly	 direction.	 	 Samples	 returned	
assay	 values	 absent	 in	 gold	 but	 carried	 up	 to	 6,575ppm	 Cu	 and	 13,805ppb	 silver.		
Potts	(2012)	noted	other	areas	with	copper	malachite	staining	on	the	Little	Hyland	
property.

7.4.3 Camp Zone 
	

The	Camp	zone	is	located	near	the	north‐west	border	of	the	Little	Hyland	north	claim	
block.	Samples	from	this	showing	returned	values	up	to	4500ppb	Au	from	a	quartz	
vein	with	some	sulphides	hosted	within	phyllite	(Potts	and	McKenzie,	2012).	Roughly	
400m	 east	 of	 this	 showing	 occurs	 a	 series	 of	 north‐south	 trending	 veins	 with	
scorodite	where	values	up	to	1600ppb	Au	have	been	recorded	(Potts,	2011).

The	Road	showing	is	located	next	to	the	Nahanni	Range	Road	in	the	northwest	corner	
of	 the	Little	Hyland	north	 claim	block.	Casselman	and	Halle	 (2010b)	 reported	 float	
samples	 from	 this	 occurrence	 with	 anomalous	 gold	 including	 365ppb	 Au	 from	
massive	arsenopyrite,	442ppb	Au	from	pyrite‐arsenopyrite	in	quartz	and	748ppb	Au	
from	quartz‐pyrite‐galena,	and	up	to	4.03%	Pb	and	24.4gpt	Ag	from	a	float	sample	of		
galena	 and	minor	 pyrite	 in	 quartz.	 They	 also	 noted	 the	 presence	 of	 quartz	 pebble	
conglomerate	 at	 this	 showing,	 and	 attributed	 it	 to	 the	 Yusezyu	 Formation	 of	 the	
Hyland	Group.	This	unit	is	regionally	significant	for	gold	occurrences	such	as	at	the	3	
Aces	property.

7.4.5 Dull Spur Zone 
	

The	Dull	 Spur	 zone	 is	 located	 on	 the	 north‐west	 corner	 of	 the	 Little	 Hyland	 south	
claim	block.	Mineralization	is	still	unknown	over	this	zone	however	 it	 is	defined	by	
several	 anomalous	 soil	 values	 ranging	 up	 to	 131ppb	 Au	 and	 0.55ppm	 Ag.	 Potts	
(2011)	correlated	these	anomalous	results	to	NNW‐trending	faults.	

7.4.6 Rubus 
	

Outcrop	 mineralization	 on	 the	 Rubus	 claim	 block	 is	 still	 unknown;	 however,	
significant	 arsenic	 anomalies	 derived	 from	 stream	 sediment	 data	 have	 been	
identified.	 	Two	 streams	 that	drain	 the	 central	 portion	of	 the	 claim	block	 returned	
anomalous	arsenic	values	over	substantial	distances.	Float	rock	samples	in	this	area	
marked	by	pyrite	mineralization	and	yellow	scorodite	staining	returned	values	up	to	
5060ppm	As	and	315ppb	Au	(Casselman	and	Halle,	2011).	

8 Deposit Types 

8.1 Skarn‐type Tungsten  
	

The	former	Cantung	Mine,	located	in	the	Northwest	Territories	approximately	10km	
east	 of	 the	 Property,	 is	 the	 most	 significant	 mineral	 deposit	 in	 the	 area.	 It	 has	
produced	 tungsten	 periodically	 since	 1962	 and	 	 was	 most	 recently	 owned	 and	
operated	 	 by	 North	 American	 Tungsten	 Corp.,	 until	 June	 2015	 at	 which	 time	 the	
company	went	into	receivership.			The	Cantung	Mine	and	the	Mactung	deposit	were	
ultimately	acquired	by	the	Government	of	Northwest	Territories	in	2015.		Under	the	
terms	of	a	devolution	agreement	the	Federal	Canadian	Government	has	assumed	the	
responsibilities	for		care	and	maintenance	since	that	time	(Government	of	Northwest	
Territories,	 2015).	 	 Reserves	 (not	 verified	 by	 the	 Author)	 are	 stated	 at	 2.5‐million	
tonnes	 grading	 1.11%	 tungsten	 oxide	 indicated	 and	 0.4‐million	 tonnes	 grading	
0.84%	 tungsten	 oxide	 inferred	 (Delaney	 and	 Bakker,	 2014).	 	 The	 deposit‐type	
consists	of	tungsten‐rich	skarns	formed	in	carbonaceous	Selwyn	Basin	sedimentary	
rocks	along	the	margins	of	mid‐Cretaceous	granodiorite	intrusions.		

8.2  Orogenic‐ or Lode‐type Gold  
	

The	 Selwyn	 Basin	 has	 traditionally	 been	 known	 for	 its	 sedimentary	 exhalative	
deposits	of	lead,	zinc	and	silver.	 	Exploration	over	the	last	decade	has	led	to	several	
significant	gold	discoveries	of	various	gold	deposit‐types	including	intrusion‐related	
replacement	(e.g.	Tiger),	Carlin	(e.g.	Osiris	and	Conrad)	and	orogenic	(e.g.	3	Aces	and	
Plateau).	 Stratabound	 is	 primarily	 exploring	 for	 orogenic‐	 or	 lode‐type	 gold	
mineralization	 hosted	 within	 Hyland	 Group	 sediments	 similar	 to	 the	 quartz	 vein‐
hosted,	 high‐grade	 gold	 mineralization	 found	 at	 Golden	 Predator's	 3	 Aces	 project,	
located	 approximately	 20km	 south	 of	 the	 Property,	 and	 Goldstrike	 Resources'	
Plateau	project	 located	approximately	315km	to	 the	northwest.	 	 Sack	et.	 al.	 (2018)	
provides	an	excellent	synopsis	of	the	orogenic	character	of	the	gold	mineralization	at	
Plateau.		



	 	

 39

	
Gold	only	deposits	derived	from	bedrock	sources	are	generally	classified	as	orogenic‐	
or	 lode‐type.	 	 This	 type	 of	 deposit	 is	 extremely	 important,	 accounting	 for	 60%	 of	
historical	 gold	 production	 in	 Canada	 (Poulsen,	 1996).	 Lode‐type	 gold	 deposits	 are	
found	 in	a	variety	of	 tectonic	 terranes	but	occur	mainly	 in	areas	where	 there	 is	 an	
abundance	of	volcanic	and	clastic	sedimentary	rocks	of	low	to	medium	metamorphic	
grade.	 They	 are	 generally	 formed	 in	 regionally	 metamorphosed	 terranes	 during	
compressional	to	transpressional	deformation	processes	at	convergent	plate	margins	
in	 accretionary	 and	 collisional	 orogens	 (Groves	 et	 al.,	 1998).	 	 The	 classification	 of	
lode‐type	 gold	 deposits	 remains	 problematic	 due	 to	 the	 variety	 of	 the	 host	 rock	
lithological	 and	 tectonic	 settings.	 The	 Little	 Hyland	 River	 area	 has	 not	 seen	much	
exploration	work	for	gold	so	it	is	too	early	to	categorize	known	showings	like	Golden	
Culvert	and	3	Aces.

However,	 in	 a	 broad	 sense,	 the	 gold	 in	 these	 showings	 is	 contained	 in	 quartz‐
carbonate	 veins	 that	 appear	 to	 be	 associated	 with	 brittle	 to	 ductile	 deformation	
zones	 hosted	 in	 basinal	 sedimentary	 host	 rocks.	 This	 style	 of	 mineralization	 is	
recognized	globally	as	a	sub‐type	termed	"turbidite‐hosted	quartz‐carbonate	vein"	or	
"Bendigo"	 type	15	 (Poulson	 et.	 al.,	 2000).	 These	deposits	 consist	 of	 veins	 and	vein	
arrays	 in	 folds	 (saddle	 reefs),	 faults	 and	 brittle‐ductile	 shear	 zones	 in	 turbidite	
sequences	of	all	ages,	deformed	and	metamorphosed	to	 lower	to	upper	greenschist	
facies.	 Graphitic	 schists	 in	 such	 sequences	 are	 particularly	 favourable	 hosts,	 and	
intrusive	 rocks	 are	 generally	 lacking	within	 and	 immediately	 around	 the	 deposits.	
The	deposits	are	commonly	associated	with	anticlines	and	related	limb‐thrust	faults	
as	 exemplified	 by	 Bendigo	 and	 Ballarat,	 Australia	 (Cox	 et	 al.,	 1991;	 Phillips	 and	
Hughes,	1996).	Veins	consist	of	quartz	and	carbonate,	with	lesser	amounts	of	chlorite	
and	 sericite;	 arsenopyrite	 and	 pyrite	 typically	 comprise	 less	 than	 10%	 by	 volume.	
The	ores	are	gold‐rich	(i.e.	Au:Ag	>	5),	and	contain	elevated	concentrations	of	As	and	
W.	 Wallrock	 alteration,	 in	 the	 form	 of	 sericitization	 and	 some	 silicification,	 is	
generally	 restricted	 to	 the	 immediate	vicinity	of	 the	vein.	Typically	 this	 sub‐type	 is	
consistent	with	low	to	medium‐grade	metamorphic	processes	at	intermediate	crustal	
depths	 in	 compressive	 tectonic	 settings.	 They	 are	 often	 erroneously	 referred	 to	 as	
mesothermal	gold.

The	depth	scale	is	approximate	and	logarithmic.		Note	Turbidite‐hosted	type	(From	Poulson,	Robert,		
Dube,	2000)	
	



	 	

 41

The	 Little	 Hyland	 River	 area	 is	 essentially	 a	 clastic	 sedimentary	 terrane.	 Canadian	
examples	of	similar	 terranes	with	quartz‐carbonate	 lode‐type	gold	deposits	 include	
the	 Meguma	 sequence	 in	 Nova	 Scotia,	 the	 Camlaren	 in	 the	 Yellowknife	 district,	
Northwest	Territories,	and	the	Sheep	Creek	district	and	Barkerville	terrane,	both	in	
B.C.	Classic	known	type‐districts	outside	of	Canada	 include	Bendigo	and	Ballarat	 in	
Australia,	Ashanti	in	Ghana,	and	Otago	in	New	Zealand.		The	size	and	grades	of	these	
deposits	are	mostly	less	than	5Mt	at	6	to	15gpt	Au,	(Poulson	et	al,	2000).		
	
Regional	exploration	for	this	type	of	gold	mineralization	must	focus	on	fold	axes	and	
major	ductile	or	brittle	fault	zones.	At	the	property	scale	exploration	should	focus	on	
folds,	 shear	 zones,	 faults,	 stockwork	 zones	 and	 extensional	 fractures	 that	 are	
secondary	or	adjacent	to	major	fault	zones	and	are	generally	slightly	to	moderately	
discordant	to	host	rock	bedding	or	foliation.		Veins	can	be	associated	with	a	variety	of	
structures.	Most	common	are	folded	veins	and	saddle	reefs	related	to	anticlinal	folds.	
Sheeted	en	echelon	sigmoidal	veins,	ladder	veins,	tension	gashes	or	stockworks	may	
be	related	to	zones	of	extension	or	to	Reidel	shear	structures.	Features	such	as	small	
felsic	 intrusions	and	dykes,	 iron	formations	or	mafic	 intrusive	bodies	that	 interrupt	
the	main	fault	zone	are	often	good	places	to	look	for	quartz‐carbonate	zones.	At	the	
outcrop	 level,	gold‐bearing	quartz‐carbonate	veins	 typically	contain	one	or	more	of	
arsenopyrite,	fuchsite,	pyrite,	scheelite	and	tourmaline.	Sericite,	silica,	carbonate	and	
sulphide	alteration	of	wallrock	is	typical	and	the	wall	rocks	often	contain	significant	
gold	value.	
		
Quartz‐carbonate	vein‐type	deposits	by	nature	have	relatively	low	sulphide	contents	
and	do	not	respond	readily	to	most	geophysical	methods.	Geophysical	surveys	can	be	
used	indirectly	to	identify	favourable	structures	such	as	faults	or	shear	zones.	Rock,	
soil	 and	 stream	 sediment	 geochemical	 surveys	 are	 generally	 more	 useful.	 Finally,	
gold	 related	 to	 quartz‐carbonate	 veins	 is	 notoriously	 inconsistent	 along	 strike	 and	
down	dip.	Numerous	close	spaced	drill	holes	are	required	to	build	resources.	

9 Exploration 
	
As	 part	 of	 their	 due	 diligence	 in	 early	 2017,	 South	 Shore	 began	 a	 review	 of	 drill	
results	and	a	bulk	sampling	program	reported	on	Golden	Predator's	3	Aces	project	in	
order	to	compare	to	the	Golden	Culvert	Property.	A	compilation	of	publicly	available	
information	on	the	Golden	Predator	website	and	Yukon	Geological	Survey	database	
led	 South	 Shore	 to	 the	 conclusion	 that	 that	 the	 lithological	 and	 structural	 features	
hosting	the	spectacular	gold	mineralization	on	the	3	Aces	project	could	be	present	on	
the	Property.		Moreover	it	was	noted	that	the	Property	was	very	large,	and	that	there	
had	 been	 very	minimal	 exploration	 completed	 to	 date	 although	 it	 hosted	 a	 known	
high‐grade	gold	showing.		Most	importantly	it	was	observed	that	no	drilling	had	been	
done	on	the	Property.		In	September	2017,	a	site	visit	was	done	by	two	South	Shore	
personnel	and	 two	 independent	consultants	 including	 the	Author	as	part	of	 its	due	
diligence	 review.	 	 The	 results	 of	 this	 review	 consequently	 led	 to	 the	 two	 option	
agreements	being	executed	between	the	various	Property	owners	and	South	Shore.	



	 	

 42

Subsequently	Stratabound	acquired	the	Option	from	South	Shore,	 following	its	own	
site	 visit	 and	 due	 diligence	 review	 in	 October	 2017.	 Neither	 South	 Shore	 nor	
Stratabound	 has	 completed	 any	 exploration	work	 on	 the	 Property	 except	 for	 field	
visits	pertaining	to	due	diligence.	

10 Drilling 
	

To	date	there	has	been	no	reported	drilling	on	the	Property.	

11 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security 

11.1 Site Visit and Independent Sampling 
	
The	Property	was	visited	on	September	9	and	10,	2017	by	the	Author	in	the	company	
of	 James	Cecchetto	 and	Dean	MacEachern,	 P.Geo.	 of	 South	 Shore	 and	Mark	 Fekete,	
P.Geo.,	of	Breakaway	Exploration	Management	Inc.	The	Property	visit	included	a	tour	
of	 the	 3	 Aces	 property	 provided	 by	 Mike	 Burke,	 P.Geo.	 of	 Golden	 Predator.	 	 The	
Author	 conducted	 independent	 sampling	 primarily	 at	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	 showing,	
and	also	at	several	other	sites	to	confirm	historical	results.		The	Author,	accompanied	
by	Mark	Fekete,	also	collected	a	 few	rock	samples	 in	 the	course	of	prospecting	 the	
soil	 anomalies	 extending	 southeast	 from	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	 showing.	 This	 work	
resulted	in	the	discovery	of	the	Green	Dragon	showing	described	above	in	section	9.2	
	
The	verification	samples	were	chipped	by	the	Author	primarily	 from	outcrop	and	a	
few	 from	boulders	of	 float.	 Sample	 locations	were	 tagged	 in	 the	 field	and	recorded	
with	HP	iPAQ	200	series	field	computers	running	GeoInfoMobile	and	Tierra	Mapper	
software	paired	with	Holux	GPS	receivers	in	map	datum	UTM	WGS84	Zone	9N.	The	
Author	 attempted	 to	 get	 representative	 samples	 of	 the	 various	 types	 of	
mineralization	 from	 both	 the	 quartz‐carbonate	 veins	 and	 from	 the	 adjacent	 wall	
rocks.		Sample	locations	in	UTM	coordinates,	gold	and	arsenic	assay	values	and	brief	
descriptions	of	the	samples	are	provided	in	Table	4.	Sample	locations	and	pertinent	
assay	 results	 are	 plotted	 on	 Figure	 38.	 	 A	 total	 of	 14	 samples	 were	 analyzed	 by	
Bureau	Veritas	Commodity	Canada	Ltd.	("BV"),	and	the	analytical	certificate	provided	
by	BV	is	included	as	Appendix	II.	

11.2 Security 
	
All	 samples	 were	 collected	 and	 handled	 only	 by	 the	 Author	 in	 the	 field	 and	 until	
delivery	to	the	BV	facility	in	Whitehorse,	Yukon.		Rock	samples	were	placed	in	plastic	
bags	with	the	appropriate	sample	numbers	marked	in	indelible	ink.		To	maintain	the	
validity	and	integrity	of	the	samples	taken,	individual	sample	bags	were	immediately	
sealed	by	the	Author	with	tie	wraps,	and	then	all	samples	were	placed	in	rice	bags,	
which	were	 in	 turn	 sealed	with	 tamper‐proof	 security	 tie	 wrap	 tags.	 The	 samples	
were	 delivered	 in	 person	 to	 the	 BV	 preparation	 facility	 in	Whitehorse	 for	 sample	
preparation,	and	then	shipped	by	BV	to	its	main	laboratory	in	Vancouver,	BC	for	final	
analysis.

11.3 Sample Preparation and Analysis 
	
Samples	were	dried,	 crushed,	 split	 and	pulverized	 to	250	gram	and	 sieved	 to	 	200	
mesh	 and	 analyzed	 for	 37	 elements	 (including	 gold)	 by	 15	 gram	 Aqua	 Regia	
digestion,	Ultratrace	ICP‐MS	finish	(BV	code	AQ251).	Samples	were	also	analyzed	by	
50	 gram	 lead	 collection	 fire	 assay	 fusion,	 AAS	 finish	 (BV	 code	 FA450).	 Samples	
returning	values	in	excess	of	10,000	ppb	gold	were	reanalyzed	using	a	lead	collection	
fire	 assay	50	 gram	 fusion,	 gravimetric	 finish	 (BV	 code	FA550).	BV	 is	 an	 accredited	
laboratory	under	 ISO	9001,	and	is	 independent	of	 the	Author	and	Stratabound.	 	BV	
follows	an	internal	QAQC	program	utilizing	standards,	blanks	and	standards.		The	BV	
preparation,	 analytical	 methods	 and	 QAQC	 procedures	 used	 on	 the	 samples	 are	
available	on	its	subsidiary	website	(www.acmelab.com).	

11.4 Author's Opinion 
	
It	 is	 the	Author's	opinion	 that	 the	 sampling	procedures,	 security	measures,	 sample	
preparations	 and	 analytical	methods	 applied	 to	 the	 2017	 independent	 verification	
rock	samples	were	diligently	followed	and	are	adequate	to	meet	industry	standards	
commonly	 accepted	 for	 this	 level	 of	 exploration.	 The	 Author	 has	 relied	 upon	 the	
adequacy	and	accuracy	of	 the	analytical	results	provided	by	 the	BV	 laboratory.	 	No	
unusual	variances	were	observed	in	QAQC	analyses	performed	at	the	BV	laboratory.	
The	 Author	 reconciled	 the	 field	 data	 with	 the	 analytical	 results	 and	 found	 no	
irregularities.

12 Data Verification 
	

Table	 5	 below	 compares	 the	 2017	 independent	 verification	 sample	 results	 with	
historical	gold	values.		Figure	39	shows	two	of	the	five	verification	samples	compared	
quite	 well	 with	 historical	 results	 whereas	 three	 samples,	 despite	 being	 highly	
anomalous,	 showed	 a	 negative	 variance	 compared	 to	 the	 historical	 samples	 (0.71,	
1.26,	7.3gpt	Au	vs.	6.34,	9.48,	11.95gpt	Au	respectively).		In	the	samples	where	there	
is	significant	variance	it	is	always	the	historical	values	that	show	larger	gold	values.			
The	 Author	 attributes	 this	 significant	 variance	 to	 selective	 sampling	 by	 previous	
workers,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 "nugget"	 effect	 that	 often	 accompanies	 higher	 grade	 gold	
mineralization	making	reproducibility	difficult	within	a	small	sample	set.			With	this	
in	 mind,	 the	 Author	 considers	 the	 historical	 gold	 tenors	 to	 have	 been	 suitably	
verified.

The	 most	 significant	 exploration	 in	 the	 area	 has	 been	 completed	 on	 the	 Golden	
Predator's	3	Aces	property	 located	approximately	20km	south	of	 the	Property.	The	
"Discovery"	vein	was	found	in	2003	by	prospector	Alex	McMillan	with	a	grab	sample	
that	 returned	5,401gpt	Au	 (~157.53opt	Au)	 from	a	quartz	 vein	with	 coarse	visible	
gold	(Dessureau,	2018).

Prior	 to	 this	 discovery,	 work	 started	 in	 1997	 when	 Hudson	 Bay	 Exploration	 and	
Development	Company	Ltd.	("Hudson	Bay")	staked	the	Hit	claims,	and	in	1998	Alex	
McMillan	staked	the	adjacent	3	Aces	claims.		Hudson	Bay	optioned	McMillan's	claims	
and	expanded	the	property	by	staking	 the	Hat	claims.	 	From	1998	to	1999	Hudson	
Bay	 completed	 surface	work	 including	 airborne	 geophysics,	 prospecting,	 and	 rock,	
soil	and	silt	geochemical	sampling.	 	Limited	diamond	drilling	of	600m	in	four	holes	
was	completed	 just	northeast	of	 the	3	Ace	showing	 in	1999.	 	Hudson	Bay	returned	
McMillan's	3	Aces	claims	in	2000	and	did	no	further	work	on	the	Hit	and	Hat	claims.	
	
In	 2003	 ATAC	 Resources	 Ltd.	 optioned	 McMillan's	 3	 Aces	 claims	 and	 completed	
excavator	 and	hand	 trenching,	 geological	mapping,	 prospecting,	 and	 rock	 sampling	
around	 the	 Road	 Showing	 located	 approximately	 3km	 southeast	 of	 the	 3	 Aces	
showing.		Following	this	work	the	option	was	dropped.

In	 2005	 McMillan	 optioned	 the	 3	 Aces	 claims	 to	 North	 American	 Tungsten	
Corporation	Ltd.	which	completed	surface	soil	geochemical	and	geophysical	surveys	
before	dropping	the	option	in	2008.	
	
In	2008	McMillan	began	re‐staking	Hudson	Bay's	Hit	and	Hat	claims	as	they	expired.		
By	2010	he	had	consolidated	his	position	in	the	area,	and	optioned	the	claim	package	
to	Northern	Tiger	Resources	 Inc.	("Northern	Tiger").	 	From	2010	to	2012	Northern	
Tiger	greatly	expanded	the	property	by	staking,	and	completed	extensive	exploration	
work	 including	an	airborne	magnetic	and	radiometric	geophysical	survey	and	a	silt	
geochemical	 survey	 over	 the	 entire	 property,	 detailed	mapping,	 prospecting,	 hand	
trenching,	and	rock	and	soil	sampling,	and	11,409m	of	diamond	drilling	in	58	holes,	
primarily	in	the	area	at	the	main	3	Aces	showing.		Northern	Tiger	became	insolvent	
in	2013	and	in	2014	was	acquired	by	Golden	Predator	as	part	of	a	complex	corporate	
re‐organization	(Dessureau,	2018).	
	
Golden	Predator	began	exploration	work	in	2014	with	metallurgical	studies	followed	
in	2015	by	rotary	air	blast	drilling,	followed	in	2016	and	2017	by	reverse	circulation	
drilling,	 diamond	 drilling,	 bulk	 sampling,	 airborne	 geophysics,	 excavator	 trenching	
and	infrastructure	development	including	a	bridge	across	the	Little	Hyland	River	to	
provide	access	to	the	main	areas	of	exploration.		Total	drilling	on	the	3	Aces	property	
to	date	is	36,358	metres	in	369	holes.		The	bulk	sample	recovered	a	744	troy	ounce	
gold	doré	bar	from	776	metric	tonnes	at	a	recovery	rate	of	83%	from	a	simple	gravity	
recovery	 circuit	 assuming	 an	 average	 gold	 content	 of	 9.0gpt	 Au	 in	 the	 tails.	
(Dessureau,	2018).	
	
Most	 of	 this	 work	 has	 been	 done	 in	 the	 area	 of	 the	 original	 3	 Aces	 "Main"	 or	
"Discovery"	and	"Sleeping	Giant"	zones.	 	Golden	Predator	has	renamed	 these	zones	
"Ace	of	Hearts"	and	 "Ace	of	Spades"	 respectively,	 and	has	added	 the	 "Ace	of	Clubs"	
and	 "Ace	 of	Diamonds"	 zones.	 	 Collectively	 these	 four	 zones	 are	 referred	 to	 as	 the	
"Central	Core"	area.	 	The	Central	Core	area	 is	defined	by	an	extensive	"gold‐in‐soil"	
anomaly	that	covers	an	area	of	13	square	kilometres.	
	
Dessureau	(2018)	explains	that	the	3	Aces	property	is	geologically	located	within	the	
Hyland	Group	interbedded	clastic	and	carbonate	sedimentary	rocks.	The	Property	is	
underlain	 by	 the	 Yusezyu	 Formation,	 which	 forms	 the	 lower	 part	 of	 the	 Hyland	
Group.	 	 A	 long	 history	 of	 multiple	 deformations	 and	 faulting	 has	 allowed	 later	
hydrothermal	 fluids	 to	 penetrate	 the	 stratigraphy	 and	with	 it	 bring	 in	mineralized	
fluids.	 Within	 the	 Central	 Core	 area,	 the	 lithologic	 packages	 strike	 to	 the	 north‐
northwest	 (340°)	 and	 dip	 gently	 (20°)	 to	 the	 east‐northeast.	 The	 litho‐structural	
contacts	are	 interpreted	 to	 focus	hydrothermal	 fluids	carrying	gold‐arsenic	bearing	
fluids	within	the	Central	Core	area	and	to	 locally	develop	quartz	veins	within	areas	
with	significant	extensional	strain.	The	rheological	contrast	between	thick	graded	to	
massive,	 coarser	 sandstone‐grit	 beds	 and	 interlayered	 phyllite	 in	 association	 with	
steeper	 normal	 fault	 zones	 appears	 to	 form	 a	 preferred	 structural	 setting	 for	 the	
formation	of	quartz	veins.	Quartz	veins	 form	at	or	near	 the	contact	 in	both	coarser	
sandstone‐grit	rocks	and	the	phyllites.		Gold	and	minor	sulfide	mineralization	(pyrite	



	 	

 49

and	 arsenopyrite)	 occurs	 with	 late,	 brittle	 faults	 within	 regional	 dextral	 trans‐
extensional	faults.	Gold	mineralization	is	associated	with	argillic,	iron	carbonate	and	
limonitic	alterations.		
	
The	gold	mineralization	in	the	Central	Core	area	is	relatively	high	grade	and	is	often	
spectacular	with	 visible	 gold	 occurring	 as	 coarse	 lumps	 and	 along	 fracture	 planes.		
Significant	drill	 results	 from	2016	and	2017	 include	19.3m	of	16.5gpt	Au,	4.57m	of	
58.75gpt	 Au,	 39.6m	 of	 13.3gpt	 Au	 and	 11.43m	 of	 31.82gpt	 Au	 gold	 (Dessureau,	
2018).	
	
During	 the	 September	 site	 visit	 to	 the	 3	 Aces	 property	 by	 the	 Author,	 several	
resemblances	to	the	Golden	Culvert	property	were	noted.	Quartz	veins	and	structural	
trends	 including	axial	planar	cleavage	occur	 in	similar	northwest	orientations.	Low	
sulfide	content	within	the	gold‐bearing	veins	was	also	noted.	

15.3 Reef 
	
The	418‐claim	Reef	property	located	five	kilometres	west	of	the	Property	is	currently	
held	 under	 option	 by	 Golden	 Predator	 from	 Precipitate	 Gold	 Corp.,	 and	 is	 being	
operated	as	part	of	the	3	Aces	project	(Dessureau,	2018).		Previous	work	on	the	Reef	
property	 has	 established	 an	 extensive	 gold‐arsenic‐antimony	 soil	 anomaly	
measuring	 at	 least	 three	 kilometres	 long	 with	 gold	 values	 exceeding	 1.0gpt	 Au	
(Figure	36).		

15.4 Hy‐Jay 
	
The	 198‐claim	 Hy‐Jay	 property	 located	 10	 kilometres	 west	 of	 the	 Property	 is	
currently	held	under	option	by	Golden	Predator	 from	Bearing	Lithium	Corp,	and	 is	
being	 operated	 as	 part	 of	 the	 3	 Aces	 project	 (Dessureau,	 2018).	 Numerous	
mineralized	 zones	 have	 been	 identified	 on	 the	 Hy‐Jay	 claim	 block	 from	 soil	
geochemistry	 surveys	 and	 prospecting	 (Figure	 36).	 Gold	 mineralization	 is	 hosted	
within	quartz‐arsenopyrite	veins	and	stockworks	controlled	by	north‐	to	northwest‐
trending,	steep	west‐dipping	 faults	(Hart,	2005).	 	The	best	documented	gold	values	
were	 reported	 from	 grab	 samples	 with	 visible	 gold	 from	 the	 "West"	 zone,	 which	
returned	 144.1gpt	 Au,	 and	 the	 "Zig‐Zag"	 zone,	 which	 retuned	 up	 to	 47.0gpt	 Au	
(Dessureau,	2018).	

15.5 Sprogge 
	
Golden	Predator	recently	acquired	100%	of	the	Sprogge	property	through	purchase	
agreements	 with	 Alexco	 Exploration	 Canada	 Corp.	 and	 Newmont	 Canada	 Corp.	
(Golden	 Predator,	 2017).	 	 The	 agreements	 supersede	 prior	 option	 agreements	
entered	 into	 by	 predecessor	 company	 Northern	 Tiger.	 	 Sprogge	 is	 located	 directly	
south	 and	 east	 of	 the	 3	 Aces	 property	 (Figure	 36).	 Highlights	 of	 previous	work	 in	
2011	and	2012	by	Northern	Tiger	include	8.5gpt	Au	over	6.8m	from	a	trench	across	a	
northeast	striking	fault	at	the	"Meadows"	zone;	a	grab	sample	of	23.8gpt	Au	from	the	



	 	

 50

"Matilda"	vein;	7.6gpt	Au	over	2.5m	from	a	trench	across	a	shear	at	the	"Ridge	East"	
zone;	and	a	grab	sample	of	7.1gpt	Au	from	the	"Ridge	West"	zone	(Golden	Predator,	
2017).	

15.6 Justin 
	
The	 Justin	 property,	 held	 by	 Aben	 Resources	 Ltd.,	 is	 located	 approximately	 20km	
south	of	the	Property.		It	is	directly	to	the	east	of	the	3	Aces	property.	Significant	drill	
intersections	 on	 the	 Justin	 property	 include	 2.47gpt	 Au	 over	 21.0m,	 2.7gpt	 Au,	
29.0gpt	 Ag	 over	 11.3m,	 1.49gpt	 Au	 over	 46.4m	 and	 0.73gpt	 Au	 over	 88.5m	 (Aben	
Resources	 Ltd.,	 n.d.).	 	 Exploration	 on	 the	 Justin	 property	 has	 been	 directed	 at	
identifying	 Intrusion	 Related	 Gold	 Systems	 ("IRGS")	 such	 as	 skarn	 hosted	 gold	
mineralization	 and	 sheeted	 veining.	 Zones	 of	massive	 skarn‐style	 replacement	 and	
quartz‐calcite	 stock	 work	 veining	 with	 elevated	 Au,	 Bi,	 Cu,	 Mo	 and	 W	 have	 been	
observed	in	drill	intersection	supporting	the	IRGS	model.		

16 Other Relevant Data and Information 
	
The	Author	is	not	aware	of	any	other	relevant	data	and	information	or	explanation	to	
make	this	report	more	understandable	and	not	misleading.	

17 Interpretation and Conclusions 

17.1 Geology and Mineralization 
	
The	veracity	of	significant	historical	gold	results	at	the	main	Golden	Culvert	showing	
has	 been	 independently	 confirmed	 by	 the	 Author.	 	 Soil	 geochemical	 trends	 on	 the	
Property	indicate	that	there	is	additional	potential	beyond	the	immediate	area	of	the	
several	 mineral	 occurrences	 found	 on	 Property	 to	 date.	 	 Indeed	 the	 new	 Green	
Dragon	showing	described	 in	 section	7.4.2	was	discovered	during	 the	Author's	 site	
visit	only	after	several	hours	of	prospecting	a	gold‐in‐soil	geochemical	trend.	
	
The	 large	number	of	gold	occurrences	hosted	 in	Hyland	Group	rocks	clearly	shows	
this	unit	is	highly	prospective	for	gold	deposits.	 	Significant	gold	mineralization	has	
been	found	on	the	Property	and	on	adjacent	properties	within	Hyland	Group	rocks.		
These	gold	occurrences	are	evidently	examples	of	the	orogenic	or	lode	gold	deposit‐
type.	This	kind	of	mineralization	is	known	to	be	closely	associated	to	and	controlled	
by	structural	features.		Further	exploration	of	the	Property	will	therefore	have	to	pay	
close	 attention	 to	 structural	 features	 such	 as	 folds,	 faults,	 shear	 zones,	 stockworks	
and	 extension	 fractures.	 	 Workers	 should	 note	 any	 occurrence	 of	 arsenopyrite,	
fuchsite,	 pyrite,	 scheelite	 and	 tourmaline	 mineralization	 as	 well	 as	 sericite,	 silica,	
carbonate	 and	 sulphide	 alteration.	 	 Sharp	 geophysical	 contrasts	 should	 be	
investigated	 as	 possible	 deformation	 zones,	 and	 magnetic	 lows	 should	 be	



	 	

 51

investigated	 for	 alteration	 of	 iron‐bearing	 magnetic	 minerals	 to	 more	 prospective	
oxide	or	carbonate	minerals.	
	
Soil	geochemical	sampling	followed	by	traditional	"pack	and	boots"	prospecting	has	
so	 far	 shown	 to	 be	 very	 effective	 at	 locating	 surface	 mineralization.	 	 Detailed	
geological	 mapping	 would	 be	 useful	 to	 identify	 potential	 lithological	 contacts	
favourable	for	lode	gold	mineralization.		Mechanical	trenching	will	be	useful	to	better	
expose	gold	occurrences,	and	eventually	core	drilling	will	be	required	to	define	gold‐
bearing	structures	in	the	subsurface.	

17.2 Infrastructure and Permitting 
	
Many	 exploration	 projects	 in	 Yukon	 face	major	 challenges	 due	 to	 the	 lack	 of	 basic	
infrastructure.	In	contrast,	the	Property	is	located	adjacent	to	and	benefits	from	the	
all‐season	access	Nahanni	Range	Road	which	provides	excellent	access.	Watson	Lake,	
located	 approximately	 250	 kilometres	 from	 the	 Property,	 offers	 a	 wide	 range	 of	
services	including	equipment,	supplies	and	labour.	 	Easy	access	to	the	Property	and	
its	proximity	 to	 a	 service	 center	 clearly	 improve	 the	project's	 logistics	 and	 relative	
cost	of	exploration	work.	
	
Permitting	 may	 often	 cause	 delays	 to	 exploration	 projects.	 The	 Golden	 Culvert	
property	has	been	approved	 for	a	Class	3	Quartz	Mining	Land	Use	Permit	effective	
until	November	14,	 2026	 that	 allows	 for	 a	 camp,	 access	 roads,	 trenching,	 diamond	
drilling	and	bulk	sampling	to	be	undertaken	immediately.	The	Little	Hyland	property	
will	 be	 operated	 under	 Class	 1	 permit	 conditions	 until	 a	 Class	 3	 permit	 can	 be	
approved.	 	 The	 Little	Hyland	 permit	will	 closely	 follow	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	 permit,	
and	all	things	being	equal,	no	major	delays	are	expected	in	the	approval	process.	

17.3 Other Considerations 
	
The	Property	 is	a	 relatively	 large	mineral	 claim	package	at	83.8	square	kilometres.		
Moreover,	until	the	moratorium	on	additional	claim	staking	in	the	Ross	River	area	is	
lifted,	the	Property	offers	a	somewhat	unique	exploration	opportunity.		The	Property	
covers	 approximately	 23	 kilometres	 of	 northwest‐trending	 structure	 potentially	
favourable	for	gold	mineralization.		This	offers	a	great	chance	to	locate	multiple	gold	
deposits	along	strike.		
	
Since	2014,	Golden	Predator	has	conducted	major	exploration	work	with	significant	
results	and	completed	substantial	infrastructure	improvements	on	its	3	Aces	Project.		
There	 are	 clearly	 benefits	 to	 have	 a	 prolific	 project	 like	 3	 Aces	 located	 in	 close	
proximity	to	the	Property.	Direct	advantages	include	potential	cost	sharing	for	joint	
mobilization	of	 contractors,	 equipment	and	 fuel.	 	Less	 tangible	benefits	 include	 the	
exchange,	 comparison	and	discussion	of	 technical	data,	and	 the	prior	knowledge	of	
financial	 investors	 with	 the	 3	 Aces	 project	 specifically,	 and	 the	 Little	 Hyland	 area	
generally.

18 Recommendations 
	
Based	on	the	general	prospective	nature	of	the	underlying	Hyland	Group	rocks,	 the	
veracity	 of	 previous	 gold	 results	 and	 the	 range	 and	 tenor	 of	 soil	 geochemical	
anomalies	 on	 the	 Property,	 the	 relatively	 good	 infrastructure,	 the	 large	 size	 of	 the	
mineral	 claim	 package,	 the	 long	 strike	 extent	 of	 potential	 gold‐bearing	 structures,	
and	the	local	presence	the	well‐known	3	Aces	project,	it	is	the	Author's	opinion	that	
the	 Property	 is	 of	 significant	 merit	 to	 recommend	 that	 an	 aggressive	 exploration	
program	continue	to	be	pursued.		Indeed	it	is	rare	to	find	a	large	project	in	the	Yukon	
that	is	located	so	close	to	a	road,	has	returned	significant	gold	values	on	surface,	and	
has	never	been	drilled.	
	
The	 following	 recommendations	 for	 an	 exploration	 program	 are	 set	 out	
chronologically	 in	 two	 phases	 and	 are	 accompanied	 by	 a	 Gantt	 graph	 (Figure	 41)	
with	 estimated	 start	 and	 finish	 dates.	 Phase	 1	 will	 consist	 primarily	 of	 soil	
geochemical	 sampling,	 prospecting,	 trenching,	 road‐building,	 and	 drilling	 in	 2018.	
The	 second	 phase	 will	 consist	 of	 additional	 core	 drilling	 at	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	
showing	 and	 other	 significant	 targets	 generated	 by	 Phase	 1,	 as	 well	 as	 continued	
geochemical	 sampling,	 prospecting	 and	 mapping.	 	 Phase	 2	 will	 be	 contingent	 on	
positive	results	in	the	first	phase,	and	will	commence	in	2019.	
	
A	 crew	 varying	 from	 two	 to	 ten	 persons	will	 be	 needed	 to	 complete	work	 on	 the	
Golden	Culvert	property	in	2018.	This	would	include	four	technicians,	one	geologist	
and	one	cook.		Four	technicians	will	be	needed	for	the	soil	sampling	but	only	two	for	
the	prospecting.		One	heavy	equipment	operator	will	be	needed	to	build	the	road	and	
excavate	 the	 trenches,	and	 it	 is	expected	 that	a	drill	 crew	of	 four	will	 complete	 the	
core	drilling.	Notice	of	the	upcoming	exploration	work	should	be	given	to	the	Yukon	
Territorial	 Government	 Mining	 Lands	 Office	 in	 mid‐April	 2018.	 This	 would	 be	
followed	by	camp	construction	of	a	temporary	summer	camp	for	up	to	ten	persons	in	
early	July.		It	is	estimated	the	camp	would	take	five	days	for	two	men	to	build.		
	
Phase	 1	 work	 will	 begin	 on	 the	 Rubus	 block	 where	 soil	 results	 are	 a	 priority	 to	
determine	if	the	block	will	be	included	with	the	Golden	Culvert	agreement.	A	2km	x	
2km	 grid	 with	 up	 to	 800	 samples	 is	 proposed	 to	 cover	 the	 previously	 outlined	
anomalous	stream	sediment	samples.	Grid	lines	should	be	spaced	at	100m	oriented	
at	70°	azimuth	with	50m	sample	intervals	to	intersect	potential	northwest‐trending	
structures.	
	
Next,	soil	grids	should	be	extended	2km	to	the	southeast	from	the	2011	Stakeholder	
grids	 on	 the	Golden	 Culvert	 claim	block	 to	 cover	 the	 unsampled	 area	 on	 the	 Little	
Hyland	south	claim	block.		A	total	of	20	grid	lines	5,000	m	long	should	be	spaced	at	
100m	 oriented	 at	 70°	 azimuth	 with	 50m	 sample	 intervals	 to	 intersect	 northwest‐
southeast	 trending	 structures.	This	grid	will	 include	20	 lines	each	5km	 for	 roughly	
2,000	samples.	
	



	 	

 53

Lithological	and	structural	mapping,	and	prospecting	surveys	are	also	recommended	
in	 Phase	 1.	 	 This	 work	 should	 focus	 on	 the	 Golden	 Culvert	 claim	 block	 and	 the	
northern	part	of	 the	Little	Hyland	claim	block.	 	Geologists	 can	design	mapping	and	
prospecting	 traverses	 to	 coincide	 with	 soil	 sampling	 set‐outs	 to	 save	 money	 on	
helicopter	time	where	possible.	
	
It	 is	 also	 recommended	 during	 Phase	 1	 to	 build	 a	 4x4	 truck	 accessible	 trail	 to	 the	
Golden	Culvert	showing.		This	trail,	approximately	two	kilometres	long,	would	allow	
for	equipment	and	personnel	to	access	the	showing	without	the	cost	of	a	helicopter.	
Also	 in	 Phase	 1	 several	 mechanical	 trenches	 should	 be	 excavated	 at	 the	 Golden	
Culvert	showing	to	identify	the	extent	of	gold‐bearing	structures	and	mineralization.	
	
The	final	Phase	1	recommendation	is	600m	of	diamond	drilling	at	the	Golden	Culvert	
showing	to	test	the	mineralized	structure	at	depth.	
	
The	estimated	cost	for	the	first	phase	of	the	exploration	program	is	$842,375	and	is	
outlined	in	Table	6	below.	The	soil	geochemical	sampling	part	of	Phase	1	is	estimated	
to	cost	$204,750,	or	roughly	$73	per	sample	including	labour,	camp,	helicopter,	truck	
and	 assay	 costs.	 	 The	 mapping,	 prospecting,	 road‐building	 and	 trenching	 work	 is	
estimated	to	cost	$169,750.		The	drilling	is	expected	to	cost	$330,000	based	on	an	all‐
in	estimate	of	$550	per	metre.	 	An	additional	$13,000	has	been	added	 for	 the	 final	
report	 and	 to	 transport	 Stratabound	 management	 to	 the	 Property.	 	 A	 15%	
contingency	has	been	added	to	the	budget	to	account	for	rainy	days,	breakdowns	and	
other	lost	days.	
	
Phase	2	will	be	contingent	upon	positive	 results	 in	 the	 first	phase,	and	will	 consist	
primarily	of	soil	geochemical	sampling,	mapping,	prospecting,	and	drilling	to	follow	
up	on	Phase	1	results.		The	remaining	property	should	be	sampled	by	reconnaissance	
ridge	and	spur	 lines	at	50m	sample	 intervals	 for	an	additional	300	samples	on	 the	
Rubus	block	and	800	samples	 in	the	southern	part	of	 the	Little	Hyland	South	claim	
block.		The	unsampled	areas	of	the	Little	Hyland	North	claim	block	would	be	sampled	
over	 a	 grid	 6	 km	 long	 with	 3	 km	 lines	 generating	 up	 to	 3000	 samples.	 It	 is	 also	
recommended	 that	 lithological	 and	 structural	 mapping,	 and	 prospecting	 surveys	
continue	in	the	second	phase.			
	
	
	
The	 total	 estimated	 cost	 for	 Phase	 2	 of	 the	 program	 is	 $1,782,500	which	 includes	
15%	 for	 contingencies	 as	 outlined	 in	 the	 Table	 7	 below.	 The	 soil	 geochemical	
sampling	 is	 estimated	 at	 $322,500,	 or	 roughly	 $75	 per	 sample.	 The	 mapping	 and	
prospecting	is	estimated	at	$109,000.		The	2000	metres	of	drilling	is	expected	to	cost	
$1,100,000	based	on	an	all‐in	estimate	of	$550	per	metre.		An	additional	$18,500	has	
been	 added	 for	 the	 final	 report	 and	 to	 transport	 Stratabound	management	 to	 the	
Property.
