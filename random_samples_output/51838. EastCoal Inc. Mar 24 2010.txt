3 SUMMARY 
At the request of Lysander Minerals Corporation ("Lysander") this independent technical report has been 
prepared in conformity with NI 43-101.   Lysander is a company incorporated in British Columbia, Canada and  
listed on the TSX Venture Exchange ("TSX-V") under the symbol LYM. 

Following the exercise of options at the end of November 2009, Lysander owns 100% of the charter capital of 
Ukraine Energy Limited, a Ukraine company that in turn owns 51% of the chartered capital of Skhidna Vugilna 
Kompania ("East Coal Company" or the "Company or "ECC") and owns directly 49% of the charter capital of 
ECC.  Accordingly, Lysander owns all of ECC, which is a Ukraine company that holds the license for the 
Verticalnaya mine and, though lease and rental agreements, the assets and facilities of the mine. 

This technical report covers the Verticalnaya North Project ("VNP" or "Verticalnaya North"), a small satellite 
operation within the Verticalnaya mine license area.  It has been compiled to conform to the disclosure and 
reporting requirements established by the Canadian Securities Administration National Instrument 43-101, 
Companion Policy 43-101CP and Form 43. 

3.1 General 
Verticalnaya Mine is in the Donbass coal basin located in Lugansk region near the Russian border. Following its 
closure in 1998 the mine was passed onto the State Enterprise "Ukruglerestructurizatsiya" (UDKR) whose 
responsibility is the liquidation of closed mines.  IMC understands that Skhidna Vugilna Kompania ("the 
Company" or "ECC") was granted the license to operate the mine as a private enterprise and will activate a 
mining plan proposed by the Company in conjunction with GOAO Luganskgiproshakht, an entity of the district 
government responsible for technical design and oversight of mines in the district. 

Lysander after acquiring ECC has proposed a plan for an initial separate operation to access the resources 
initially in the H11

B seam in the North West sector of Verticalnaya Mine.  It is this plan which is based on a prior 
GOAO Luganskgiproshakht plan, that has been assessed by IMC in this report. 

3.2 Description of Assets 
IMC reviewed the asset listed in Table 3-1, which is wholly owned by the Company and shown on the location 
plan, Figure 3-1 below.

3.3 Summary of Geology 
The geology of the Verticalnaya North Project area is not complex.  Structurally the strata are located in a 
southern dipping limb of a syncline and are not disrupted by fault structures although some simple fault 
structures do occur.  The coal seams are contained in competent strata, predominantly siltstone and sandstone. 

3.4 Summary of Reserves and Resources 
The Company propose to extract coal from the H11

B seam in the areas where it attains a thickness of 0.60 m or 
more.  The nature of the evidence, estimation methods and statements regarding reserves and resources are 
described below: 

3.4.1 Nature of Evidence 
The area of the Verticalnaya Mine has been thoroughly explored by numerous cored borehole programmes 
between 1930 and 1985 totalling over 400 boreholes, 26 of which cover the VNP area.  The Luganskgiproshakht 
holds the original borehole data listings and resource evaluations. The data is held in hard copies only with no 
computer database.

3.4.2 Reserves and Resources Estimation Methods 
The resources and reserves were originally evaluated to conform to the standards set out in the Former Soviet 
Union (FSU), the GKZ Standards.  These standards were meticulous and thorough but did not take account of 
economic or marketing factors when estimating reserves.  

The original reserve blocks and seam data have been used here as the basis to estimate the resources and reserve 
to the JORC (2004) standards which are equivalent to the CIM (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum) classifications in this situation. 

3.4.3 Reserves and Resources Statement 
It is considered that the Verticalnaya North Project will have access to 1.6 Mt of Proved Reserves in seam H11

B 
within the Measured Resources as shown in below.  These resources are inclusive of these Reserves.

Resources are inclusive of Reserves 

Reserves are quoted after allowing for all losses. Resources are quoted as in-situ totals, with no allowance for 
either mining or geological losses and are inclusive of reserves.  

3.5 Mines and Facilities 
Verticalnaya Mine is currently under care and maintenance and non-operational.  In the VNP the Company 
intends to drive new infrastucture from the surface outcrop and develop mining operations in the virgin areas of 
the H11

B coal seam as a satellite mine to the main Verticalnaya Mine. 

There are no coal preparation facilities at the mine site and none are planned. 

3.5.1 History 
Mining operations at the Verticalnaya Mine began initially during 1912 when coal was accessed from its 
outcrop point on the surface via inclined drifts locally known as "Number 10 Mine". It was then developed and 
operated as a shaft and drift mine where the workings progressed to -1000 metres "1245 m below surface". 

The sinking of a second shaft was completed just prior to the mine closure in 1998 and was never fully equipped 
and the mine never achieved the planned coal outputs and was considered unprofitable and closed and thus 
passed onto UDKR where it was kept on care and maintenance scheme as a water pumping station to protect the 
adjacent operating mines from increased water inflows. 

3.5.2 Management 
IMC's personnel were in regular contact and held numerous discussions with the Company's management at all 
levels.  IMC is satisfied that the Company's management is capable of implementing the proposed production 
plans based on this contact and on direct observations of the limited operational management team, which IMC 
understands will be enhanced as the mine is developed. 

3.5.3 Health and Safety 
IMC understands that as the development of the mine begins the new management of the mine will pursue an 
active safety management policy.  Any training programme devised will be approved by the Ukrainian Mine 
Authorities before it is implemented and a record of each individuals training will be maintained at the mine.

3.5.4 Infrastructure 
The site proposed for the VNP mine access and surface facilities has good access by road from the main 
Verticalnaya site and a nearby rail line with facilities for wagon loading.  Overhead power lines supplying a 
nearby quarry run close to the site and could be used to supply the mine facilities 

The existing Verticalnaya Mine site's main administration building is functional, capable of providing the 
services required for management and workers which could be used for the VNP 

3.5.5 Mine Development Project 

3.5.5.1 Mine Layout 
The VNP mine layout is based on the initial development and extraction of coal reserves in H11

B leaving lower 
coal seam H10

B available for extraction at a later time.  It is intended to extract the coal in this satellite block 
with longwall faces. 

Development of the mining block will be via two in-seam drifts driven from the surface (Ventilation and 
Conveyor Drifts).  With the full seam dip at the surface being 18-20°, the drifts will be driven cross-dip to make 
sure the angle of apparent dip is not greater than 16° (refer Figure 25-1). 

From these drifts three longwalls driven along the strike of the coal seam will be developed in the coal resources 
to the west of the drifts, extracting the seam in descending order (refer Figure 25-2).   

3.5.5.2 Roadway Development 
The two inclined drifts, 30 m apart, will be driven a distance of 450 m from the surface outcrop and an inseam 
connection formed at the base of the drifts.  From the drifts ventilation and conveyor access roadways to the first 
longwall will be driven.  50 m of cover will be left between the higher longwall ventilation gate and the surface.  
The ventilation gate should also be below the oxidized section of the coal seam.  Due to the angle of the drifts 
compared to the line of strike the length of the upper ventilation roadway will be 60 m to the longwall face and 
the lower conveyor roadway will be 190 m. 

The method of drivage of the drifts, in-seam access roadways and the longwall will be by drill and blast. 

Using solid firing the coal seam will be drilled, fired and loaded out prior to the hard rock section of the 
roadway.  This will separate the coal from the waste materials and also provide a second free-face for blasting 
the rock.  This method will advance the drivage by 2 metres per round giving advance rate of 90 m/month.  The 
advance rate is relaxed to a maximum of 70 m/month for scheduled planning. 

In-seam drivage for the development of the longwall roadways is planned at a maximum drivage rate of 
75 m/month because they are being driven level along the strike. 

Meetings with two companies, Spetspromtehnika and Luganskshakhtoprohodka, have confirmed that rates of 
70 m/month on the inclined drifts and 75 m/month on in-seam drivage can be achieved for the proposed 
development of H11

B coal seam at VNP. 

The advance rate for the longwall face start position is planned at 90 m/month as this is a simple inseam drivage. 

The cross-sectional area of all roadways will be a standardised at 16 m2 and two weeks are allowed for the 
erection of a junction during the development programme. 

3.5.5.3 Longwall Development 
Longwall faces will be driven to the rise from the longwall conveyor roadway to a planned length of 270 m 
along the line of dip.  Two months are allowed for the equipping of a longwall, and its associated production 
infrastructure. 

All longwalls will be advanced longwall operations utilising a short advanced heading system at each end of the 
longwall face using standard arch support.  The longwall will be equipped with a plow system along the face-
line for the extraction of coal. 

An advanced heading system is a common method of work for advancing longwalls in Ukrainian mines.  The 
system consists of either a bucket loading or gathering arm loading machine fitted with a boom mounted drill 
rig.  Bore and fire methods are used in the removal of the strata to form the roadway profile which is then 
supported with steel arch supports.

Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

3.5.5.4 Production 
The planned production from each longwall will peak at 35,000 t/month based on 25 days and a calculated 306 
tonnes per metre of advance which will require 4.5 m advance per day. 

Two mines in the same area of the Ukraine, the Frunze Mine and the Bryanka Mine, have both confirmed that 
the longwall advance rate of 4.5 m is readily achievable and in the past they have achieved in excess of that on 
numerous occasions in Seam H11

B. 

When the first longwall is in production the two inclined drifts will be extended a further 300 m prior to the 
development of Longwall 2 with a similar configuration to access Longwall 3. 

To ensure continuity of longwall coal production, Longwall 2 will be driven and equipped whilst Longwall 1 is 
in production ensuring Longwall 2 is ready for coal production when Longwall 1 is finished.  A second set of 
longwall equipment will be purchased for Longwall 2.  Equipment from Longwall 1 will be refurbished and 
installed onto Longwall 3, again to ensure continuity of coal production. 

The mining schedule developed shows first coal production in month 17 allowing 4 months to obtain land and 
coal production permits (refer Figure 25-3).  Each longwall will be worked systematically providing a 
continuous coal output for 47 months or 4 years.  In total the three longwall's will produce around 1.5 Mt of 
saleable product. 

Based on similar operations in the Ukraine and IMC's experience, IMC consider these development and 
production parameters to be testing but achievable with the correct management and equipment. 

3.5.6 Coal Preparation 
The Company have no plans for a dedicated coal processing plant on site to treat the VNP ROM product.  It is 
intended to utilise mobile screening technology and associated conveying systems to pre-screen the ROM coal 
to remove contaminants, inspect/hand clean the screen oversize to maximise recovery in order to prepare a 
marketable product for direct sale to the domestic electricity generating market. 

Third party washing of the coal off-site is an option available to the Company should operational experience 
deem it necessary. 

3.6 Environmental Issues and Management 
At the Verticalnaya Mine site, the estimated mass emissions to air of dust and combustion gases are relatively 
small. The mitigation measures proposed in the Environmental Social Impact Assessment, together with 
establishment of sanitary protection zones for this site, are designed so that ambient Ukrainian air quality 
standards are not exceeded.  

The proposed area for the VNP mine access and surface facilities is on the site of a former clothing factory on 
land designated for industrial use.  The land is under the authority of Sverdlovsk District and presently unused.  
Similarly, land in the immediate surroundings is mainly grass and unused for agriculture.  

A revised environmental assessment is required for the VNP site although environmental effects would not be 
expected to differ significantly from those of the main Verticalnaya Mine.  However a village lies approximately 
500 m from the VNP site and therefore the project and environmental management systems must be designed to 
ensure air quality and noise levels remain within Ukrainian standards.  

ECC considers that the local communities are supportive of a resumption in mining because of employment 
prospects. 

ECC has two suitable options for waste rock storage; either on the existing Verticalnaya waste site or in the 
nearby quarry owned by another company.   

3.6.1 Provision for Rehabilitation 
At this stage, ECC has not developed a formal environmental management system and plan.  However a 
technical specificaction document is to be prepared by Luganskgiproshakht and submitted with the application 
to Sverdlovsk Civil Authority to rent an area of land for the VNP site. The document typically includes a 
provisional plan for rehabilitation of the disturbed land.  As a point of note, there is no requirement under 
Ukrainian Environmental Law to plan or make financial provision for mine closure.

3.7 Statutory Authorisations 

3.7.1 Mining Licences and Leases 
ECC has recently taken ownership of the assets comprising the Verticalnaya Mine, acquiring the mining 
licences and finalising an agreement for rental of land areas required for implementation of the main mine 
project.  

The protocol for acquiring these and commencing mining activities is an integrated, phased process involving: 

• Acquisition of a licence to develop the deposit from the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources 
(MENR). 

• Gaining permission to rent land areas housing the mine and process facilities, infrastructure, waste 
storage site and water treatment from the Sverdlovsk Civil Authority. 

• Obtaining the mining lease from the Ministry of Coal. 

• Obtaining various permits for labour safety and environmental emissions. 

Currently the position is that ECC has the Mining Licence, has a preliminary agreement regarding rental of land 
areas and has submitted the project plans and drawings to the Ministry of Coal for approval for the Verticalnaya 
Mine.  This approval is expected shortly. 

IMC understands that ECC has a verbal agreement to rent an area of land suitable for the VNP. 
Luganskgiproshakht has been contracted to prepare the technical specification, including the area and 
boundaries of the land required, for submission with the application for rental.  ECC considers that the 
application will be approved quickly without objection.  IMC has not identified any issues likely to result in a 
rejection of the application. 

3.7.2 Environmental Permits 
Before mining can commence, ECC must obtain permits from the MENR for emissions to air, use and discharge 
of water and generation and storage of solid waste materials.  Two critical approvals necessary for the 
Verticalnaya Mine project implementation have been received.  However in order for VNP to proceed, 
Luganskgiproshakht is to revise the original feasibility study, including the  environmental impact assessment.  
This has to be submitted to the State Expertise for review and approval before the ecological certificate and 
work permits can be granted.  No problems are expected in this regard 

3.8 Financial Results 
A financial analysis for Verticalnaya North, provided by the Company and evaluated by IMC, over the period 
January 2010 to August 2015 inclusive- the life of the mine as proposed.  This duration covers the time from 
when the main site was taken over to when the final income is received for the related coal sales, some two 
months after production ceases from this area. 

It is important to note that this project for Verticalnaya North will extract some of the resources/reserves 
planned within the larger project for the development of Verticalnaya Mine and which have already been 
included within the valuation of that project.  However it should also be noted that the amount of reserves that 
will extracted by the VNP, some 550,000 tonnes, will not materially affect the main project considering the 
established resources and reserves at the Verticalnaya Mine. 

Further, for the duration of this project, costs incurred at the main project site are covered within this 
Verticalnaya North project. Thus while some resources should now be removed from the larger Verticalnaya 
project, it is advisable that the overall timing, capital expenditure and operating costs, of that project should now 
be reviewed. 

Capital expenditure for developing the mine project for the initial years plus additional expenditure over the 
remaining life to maintain production is estimated at US$25.0 million. This total includes any operating 
expenses prior to the commencement of commercial coal production, less the associated coal sales, which have 
been capitalised in the Company business plan. 

Commercial coal production is projected to commence from the H11B seam half way through the second year of 
the project- in July 2011 based on a January 2010 start.

Cash operating costs over the full term of the business plan are projected to average US$23.25 per saleable 
tonne of production (excluding development costs capitalised during the first 3 years of the project). 

A discounted cash flow appraisal has been carried out over the 65 months of the business plan and this shows a 
net present value, when discounted at 12%, of US$14.89 million.  A sensitivity analysis has been carried out and 
the results are shown in Section 25.11. 

Based on the business plan as presented and the subsequent cash flow analysis the projected undiscounted 
payback period is 41 months.

4 INTRODUCTION 

4.1 Report Preparation 
At the request of Lysander Minerals Corporation ("Lysander") this independent technical report has been 
prepared in conformity with NI 43-101.   Lysander is a company incorporated in  British Columbia, Canada and 
listed on the TSX Venture Exchange ("TSX-V") under the symbol LYM. 

Following the exercise of options at the end of November 2009, Lysander owns 100% of the charter capital of 
Ukraine Energy Limited, a Ukraine company that in turn owns 51% of the chartered capital of Skhidna Vugilna 
Kompania ("East Coal Company" or the "Company or "ECC") and owns directly 49% of the charter capital of 
ECC.  Accordingly, Lysander owns all of ECC, which is a Ukraine company that holds the license for the 
Verticalnaya mine and, though lease and rental agreements, the assets and facilities of the mine. 

IMC Group Consulting Limited ("IMCGCL" or "IMC") of Nottingham, England has been commissioned as 
independent technical consultants for the preparation of this report.  The Qualified Persons, signatories of this 
report, are engaged as consultancy employees of IMCGCL.  IMCGCL has received fees for the preparation of 
this report.  There is no other corporate or commercial relationship between IMCGCL and Lysander, nor does 
any such relationship exist through the individual signatories, each of whom confirm their independence in the 
Certificates of Qualified Persons in Section 24 of this report. 

This technical report covers the Pre-feasibility Study of the Verticalnaya North Project (VNP) and has been 
compiled to conform to the disclosure and reporting requirements established by Canadian Securities 
Administration National Instrument 43-101, Companion Policy 43-101CP and Form 43-101F1. 

4.2 Purpose of the Technical Report 
The purpose of the report is to provide an independent assessment of the VNP by reviewing pertinent data, 
including resources, reserves, manpower requirements, environmental issues and the life-of-mine ("LOM") 
plans relating to productivity, production, operating costs, capital expenditures and revenues. 

IMC has reviewed the practice and estimation methods undertaken by the Company for reporting reserves and 
resources in accordance with the Former Soviet Union (FSU) "Classification and Estimation Methods for 
Reserves and Resources," last revised in 1981.  This procedure establishes the nature of evidence required to 
ensure compliance with the Classification.  Within this is a "Conditions for Estimation of Reserves and 
Resources" unique to each deposit.  IMC has reviewed the reserves and resources statement of the VNP 
compiled by the Company and has restated the reserves and resources in compliance with the reporting 
requirements established by Canadian Securities Administration National Instrument 43-101, Companion Policy 
43-101CP and Form 43-101F1  In this report, all reserves and resources estimates, initially prepared by the 
Company in accordance with the FSU Classification, have been substantiated by evidence obtained from IMC's

site visits and observation and are supported by details of drilling results, analyses and other evidence and takes 
account of all relevant information supplied by the management of the Company. 

Mining, and in particular underground coal mining, is carried out in an environment where not all events are 
predictable.  Whilst an effective management team can, firstly, identify the known risks, and secondly, take 
measures to manage and mitigate these risks, there is still the possibility for unexpected and unpredictable 
events to occur.  It is therefore not totally possible to remove all risks or state with certainty that an event that 
may have a material impact on the operation of a mine, will not occur.

The work of the above experts can be relied upon. 

6 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The VNP area lies within the north western sector of the Verticalnaya Mine licence area which is in the 
Dolzhano-Rovenetskiy region of Donbass. The Verticalnaya Mine licence area is 52.4 km2. The centre of the 
mine licence area is 39˚ 50΄E 48˚ 10΄N or 42000E 29500N in local coordinates.  

The Verticalnaya Mine licence document lists the coordinates in longitude and latitude.  ECC have been issued 
a mining licence for the property, No. 4305 dated 19th July 2007 which allows them to extract coal from seams 
H11, H11

B, H10
B, H8 and H8

B within the licence area.  This licence is valid for 20 years from the date of issue 
expiring on the 19th July 2027. 

6.1 The Nature and Extent of the Issuer's Title to, or Interest in the Property including Surface Rights 

The mine licence is issued by the Ukraine Ministry of Mines. They are the only authority allowed to give 
permission for mining within the Ukraine. 

ECC has recently taken ownership of the assets comprising the Verticalnaya Mine, acquiring the mining 
licences and finalising an agreement for rental of land areas required for implementation of the original project 
to work the mine and for the VNP site.   

The protocol for acquiring these and commencing mining activities is an integrated, phased process involving: 

• Acquisition of a licence to develop the deposit from the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources 
(MENR). 

• Gaining permission to rent land areas housing the mine and process facilities, infrastructure, waste 
storage site and water treatment from the Sverdlovsk civil authority. 

• Obtaining the mining lease from the Ministry of Coal. 

• Obtaining various permits for labour safety and environmental emissions. 

6.1.1 Mining Licence 
ECC has acquired the mining licence for seams 8, 10 and 11 under an open tender by the MENR.  Typically, 
mining licences are valid for 20 years. Terms of licences include obligations of the owner to work according to 
safety and environmental laws, make efficient use of the resources, submit summary production reports monthly 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 10

and detailed annual reports, and pay royalty fees equivalent to US$ 0.25 per tonne coal delivered to the surface 
on the specified dates.  

As the VNP comes within this licence area as a satellite mine, the same conditions will apply. 

6.1.2 Rental of Surface Areas 
The land proposed for the mine access and surface facilities of the VNP is approximately 1.5 km north west of 
the main Verticalnaya site.  It is owned by the local civil authority and ultimately under the administration of the 
Sverdlovsk District Authority.  According to ECC there is a verbal agreement in place to rent an area of land 
which effectively allows ECC to proceed with the work necessary for a formal rental application and revision of 
the feasibility study. 

ECC is presently finalising a contract with Luganskgiproshakht Institute to prepare a technical document to 
accompany the application to rent a suitable area of land from the Sverdlovsk Civil Authority. The technical 
document typically specifies: 

• The characteristics of the land. 

• Technical details of the project.  

• Infrastructure requirements. 

• Methods of  disposal of waste and water. 

• The area and boundaries of the land required. 

• Ownership of adjoining land and an estimate of any damage or losses likely to be incurred.  

• Provisional plans for rehabilitation of the disturbed area. 

The rental application has been granted without any objections as the site and surrounding land are currently 
unused and the local population is generally supportive of a resumption in mining because of the employment 
prospects.  

6.1.3 Mine Lease 
Following acquisition of the Mining Licence, ECC has submitted the project plans and drawings to the Ministry 
of Coal.  After review and approval by various departments of the Ministry of Coal, the mining lease was issued 
as of the 28th May 2009.  In parallel, ECC must obtain permits for mining and use of explosives by 
demonstrating that the relevant managers and explosive specialists have the necessary experience and 
qualifications.  

The original project feasibility study by Luganskgiproshakht for the Verticalnaya Mine has received positive 
conclusion following review by the State Expertise committees for labour safety and ecology.   A revision of the 
mining plan will require similar approval and then a total conclusion from the State Expertise before site 
construction work can commence.  Detailed engineering design work can also commence at this stage. 

6.2 Conditions of Mining Licence 

The licence states that there are additional conditions for mining the coal.  These are 

• The licence is issued according to the results of the tender (protocol No.13, dated 11th June 2007) 

• Conformation with conditions laid down in: 

• State Control of Ecological Recourses in the Lugansk Area, Card No.1272 dated 18th April 
2005 

• State Mining Industrial Control No. 01/02-07.04.1/891 dated 20th December 2006 

• Complete and in time payment of obligatory payments to State Budget according to the Legislation 

• Annual report to "GEOINFORM of Ukraine" Form 5-GR

The Verticalnaya Mine boundaries set out in the licence agreement are dictated by:: 

• Outcrop of the coal seams on the rise side to the north; 

• Tsentrosoyuz mine workings on the east side along the strike of the coal seam; 

• Cosmonavtov mine workings on the west side along the strike of the coal seam; 

• The final contour line of the current licence area allocated to the dip. 

The location of the mine shafts and other surface features were checked using GPS measurements on an earlier 
visit to the mine site and the results confirm the location of the licence area (refer Figure 6-1).   

For the VNP only the outcrops of the seams and the mine workings and faulting to the west inpinge on the area 
available to the project (refer Figure 6-2). 

The location of the old mine workings are shown on a map in Section 11, Figure 11-2 and the location of all 
known mineral zones are shown in map form in Figure 13-1 and Figure 13-2. 

6.4 The Terms of any Royalties, Back-in Rights, Payments or Other Agreements and Encumbrances to 
which the Property is Subject; 

Payment to the State Property Fund for the assets required for the operation of the mine will be paid as a royalty 
per tonne of coal produced. 

6.5 All Environmental Liabilities to which the Property is Subject; 
The proposed site for the VNP was previously used as a small clothing factory and is designated industrial land. 
All that remains of the factory, which IMC understands has been closed for almost 20years, is a concrete slab 
and some small concrete structures.  IMC has not identified any liabilities associated with the existing site 
condition other than a need to clear the concrete and a small amount of fly tipping of municipal waste.   
However ECC will be required to work according to lease conditions necessary to protect the environment and 
after completion of mining to restore the land to an agreed condition.   

Other ongoing liabilities refer to the main Verticalnaya Mine and are referred to in the Technical Report on the 
Verticalnaya Mine, Ukraine (NI 43-101 Standards) dated September 2008.

6.6 The Permits that must be acquired to Conduct the Work proposed for the Property, and if the 
Permits have been Obtained. 

Environmental protection in the Ukraine is legislated using a system similar to that adopted by many countries 
throughout the former Soviet Union. With regard to the exploitation of mineral deposits the primary articles of 
legislation governing are: 

• The Law of Ukraine on Protection of the Natural Environment, No. 1264-XII, 25.06.91. 

• The Code of Ukraine on Subsoil, No. 132/94-ВС, 27.07.94. 

The permitting procedure for mining projects consists of three distinct phases: exploration, project initiation and 
project operation. Environmental regulation, applied throughout these phases, is established in the primary 
legislation. The Subsoil Code establishes the basis for the issuing of exploration and mining licences and defines 
the concept of the rational use of resources. Procedural measures, permitting and the basis for standards are 
provided in subsidiary legislation, such as  

• The Water Code of Ukraine, No. 213/95-ВР, 06.06.95. 

• The Law of Ukraine on Protection of the Atmosphere, No.2707-XII, 16.10.92. 

• The Ground Code of Ukraine, No. 2196-XII, 13.02.92. 

• The Law of Ukraine on Waste Products, No. 187/98-ВР, 3/5/1998. 

A key element of the project initiation phase is the OVOS process, which is equivalent to the international 
Environmental Social Impact Assessment.  The OVOS is used as the basis for the application for permits 
covering waste management, water abstraction and discharge, and emissions to atmosphere.  Further 
implementation of a project is dependent on receipt of an Environmental Certificate and review of the EIA by 
the State Environmental Expertise according to the Law of Ukraine on Ecological Expertise, No. 45/95-ВС, 
09.02.95.  The latter includes procedures for public notification and consultation. 

A large number of rules, regulations, normative documents and Government decisions are taken into account in 
the development of the EIA including: 

• Maximum permissible concentration (MPC) of harmful substances in air. 

• Specifications of quality of fishery and domestic water use.  

• Maximum permissible concentration, sanitary rules and norms for protection of surface waters from 
pollution. 

Environmental protection is enforced mainly by the requirement to obtain and maintain the environmental 
permits that establish and regulate an economic mechanism levying payments for permissible or normative 
amounts of emissions and waste production.  Environmental permits, specifying the permissible quantities of air 
emissions and waste storage are issued annually whereas water usage and discharge permits are normally valid 
for 5 years. Renewal is subject to submission of an annual environmental report, compliance with specific 
provisions and payment of taxes at the required dates. The normative levels must be re-assessed periodically, 
typically every 5 years for air emissions. 

For the main Verticalnaya Mine project two critical approvals necessary for the project implementation have 
been received.  The submission of the ecological certificate has been approved by the Chief of the Department 
of the State Administration of Ecology and Natural Resources in Lugansk Region, on 18.04.2005, and the state 
ecological expertise was carried out by the State Administration of Ecology and Natural Resources in Lugansk 
Region and approved on 20.05.05 

In order for the VNP to proceed, EEC must submit a revised feasibility study and environmental assessment for 
review and approval by the State Expertise.  Luganskgiproshakht is preparing the revised feasibility study and is 
of the opinion that approval can be obtained in approximately 3-4 months on the basis that the VNP does not 
impose additional environmental impact compared with the original plan for extracting coal from the main 
Verticlnaya mine. 

Also before mining and processing can commence, ECC must obtain permits from the MENR for emissions to 
air, use and discharge of water and generation and storage of solid waste materials. These define the permissible 
quantities for release of hazardous substances based on the results of the EIA (Environmental Social Impact 
Assessment) that is being prepared as part of the revised feasibility study.  Generally permits for water discharge 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 14 
Ukraine 

 

 
 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

are valid for 5 years whilst air emission permits and waste permits must be renewed annually. Furthermore the 
air emissions inventory must be re-evaluated every 5 years. 

In parallel, ECC must obtain permits for mining and use of explosives by demonstrating that the relevant 
managers and explosive specialists have the necessary experience and qualifications.  

As stated above Luganskgiproshakht is of the opinion that approval can be obtained in approximately 
3-4 months. 

7 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

7.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 
The proposed site for the VNP mine access and surface facilities occupies a slightly elevated position, at 320 m, 
approximately 1.5 km north west of the main Verticalnaya site.  The land in the immediate vicinity is gently 
undulating with vegetation consisting of grass and small trees but no evidence of agriculture or animal grazing.  
A shallow river valley lying to the east of the site is dammed at several points upstream to form the settlement 
lagoons for treating water from the main Verticalnaya Mine and site. 

7.2 The Means of Access to the Property 
The VNP site is accessed from the main Verticalnaya site via public highways and good quality dirt track; a 
total distance of approximately 10 km.  There may be an option to construct a more direct access road from the 
main site. 

7.3 Proximity to a Population Centre and Nature of Transport 
The Verticalnaya Mine, formerly known as Volodarskiy, is located in the Sverdlovsk district, Lugansk region of 
Ukraine west of the city of Sverdlovsk. A number of settlements lie in the vicinity including towns of 
Lunacharsk, Leninskiy, Volodarsk, Ustinovka, and villages of Malomedvezhje, and Fedorovka.  Houses of 
Volodarsk village are visible from the proposed VNP area at a distance of approximately 500 m to the north 
east.  

Mining in the region has been ongoing for almost 100 years resulting in a landscape dominated with numerous 
waste heaps, mine head gear and settling ponds.  Within the bounds of the Verticalnaya lease area are the 
aluminium plant "Intersplav" and the Valyanovskiy gravel plant.  The locality is a densely populated and highly 
developed industrial region, associated mainly with coal mining and manufacturing.  Although several mines 
bordering Verticalnaya are still in operation, the collapse of the coal industry during the 1990s had a high impact 
on the local economy. 

Transport for a potential workforce could easily be established from the local centres of population by a public 
or Company run buses. There is a rail spur at the gravel plant with wagon loading facilities, approximately 1 km 
from the proposed VNP site.  This option is under consideration for delivery of coal directly to the power 
station. 

7.4 The Climate and the Length of the Operating Season 
The regional climate can be extreme with snow and temperatures of -30ºC in winter rising to +30ºC with dry 
sun in summer.  However, the extensive mining operations throughout the whole of the Donbass are used to 
working with such extremes so, with adequate precautions, the operating season is continuous throughout the 
year. 

7.5 Sufficiency of Surface Rights for Mining Operations, the Availability and Sources of Power, 
Potential Tailings Storage, Potential Waste Disposal Areas 

ECC proposes to sell the coal mined at the VNP either directly to the customer, a power station, or send to a 3rd 
party washing plant for treatment.  The only treatment envisaged on site is a relatively simple screening process 
to remove large size material.  A small area will be required for coal stocking prior to loading on to rail wagons 
at a rail spur and loading facilities located at a gravel quarry close to the VNP site.   Other facilities at the site 
are likely to include the mine ventilation equipment, conveying equipment and a small heating plant.

The total area and boundaries of the land required for the VNP facilities will be defined in a technical study to 
be prepared by Luganskgiproshakht and submitted with the application to rent the land from Sverdlovsk Civil 
Authority. 

ECC requires land area for the mine, and infrastructure.  In order to conclude an agreement for rental of this 
land from the Sverdlovsk Civil Authority, ECC must: 

• Demonstrate ownership of buildings, facilities on the land to be rented 

• Be in possession of the licence to develop the deposit 

• Receive written confirmation from the current owners, that any assets have been privatised. 

• Have approval from the Sverdlovsk regional council signed by the Mayor.   

In practice, a rental agreement has to be agreed with the State Property Fund and discussions on the amount are 
still ongoing with ECC and the State Property Fund. 

ECC is considering two options for storage of the mining waste arising from the VNP: 

• Transport by truck to the existing Verticalnaya waste storage site, a distance of approximately 10 km 
via the existing access route. 

• Deposit on a nearby coal waste dump owned by another company but presently unused. 

Either of these options appear suitable, although the potential costs and legal implications associated with 
depositing waste on a 3rd party site are a potential downside against the advantage of a shorter haulage route. 

Since the coal will not be washed on site prior to sale there will be no requirement for tailings storage. 

8 HISTORY 
The Verticalnaya Mine is owned by the State Authorities and is now legally leased by ECC from July 2007 for 
20 years. The mine was previously owned and operated by the State authorities who have kept the mine under 
care and maintenance.  During the period when the mine was operational, no coal was mined in the areas of the 
H11

B and H10
B seams now being included in the Verticalnaya North Project (VNP). 

Several phases of exploration drilling have been completed by The Ministry of Coal Industry of USSR since 
1930, the most extensive phase being during the 1970's when over 200 cored boreholes were drilled in the area 
of the Verticalnaya and adjacent mines. The latest review of the geology and resources was completed in 1986 
by The Ministry of Coal Industry of USSR.  

The original borehole data is now held by The Ministry of Coal and Energy of Ukraine. Original borehole 
sections, together with seam plans and reports are held at the Ukraine Ministry in Lugansk 
(Luganskgiproshakht). These documents have been seen and inspected during the visits to the 
Luganskgiproshakht in 2008.  ECC do have copies of some of the seam plans and associated documents.  
Copies of seam plans and seam data relating to H11

B and H10
B seams have been used to compile this report of the 

VNP. 

The H8 seam has been subject to mining until the suspension of coal production due to flooding. The production 
has demonstrated that the resource estimates, structural interpretation and mine planning were realistic. There is 
no reason to question the geological interpretation or estimates of coal quality and quantity. 

The data held at the Luganskgiproshakht is typical of the comprehensive borehole data listings, coal analysis 
results, seam plans and reserve block definitions, prepared by the former USSR Ministries. From this data the 
coal resources have been calculated according to the FSU standards. The Luganskgiproshakht also holds 
information gathered during the period of active mining at the Verticalnaya Mine and from other mines in the 
area. An independent check of the resources in the H11 seam has been completed from copies of the exploration 
data held by Luganskgiproshakht and ECC. 

The VNP includes some proposals to further investigate the H10
B seam during the mining of the H11

B seam 
which lies above the H10

B seam. 

9 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
The coal bearing strata of the Dolzhano-Rovenetskiy Region of Donbass are of Carboniferous age.  Superficial 
deposits in the area are a thin (up to 25 m) covering of Quaternary clays and loam 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 16 
Ukraine 

 

 
 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

The coal resources within the Verticalnaya Mine lease area are situated on the northern limb of a broad syncline 
structure.  The strata dip toward the south at 18º (c.1 in 3) from sub-crop along the northern perimeter of the 
mine.  It is from the sub-crop of the H11

B Seam that the inclined drift access to the VNP will be constructed.  In 
the area where the coal resouces for the VNP exist, the strata maintain this 18º dip to the south. 

The strata in the area are displaced by a number of faults which occur in two zones. The coal resources of the 
VNP occur between the two major fault zones which strike north north-east to south south-west. However, some 
small scale faulting could occur in the VNP area where it is close to the major fault zones. 

10 DEPOSIT TYPES 
The coal resources of the VNP are contained in two seams, the H11

B seam and the H10
B seam some 75 m below.  

The seams are contained in the series known as C2-3 Formation which contains several coal seams of exploitable 
thickness some of which are included in the larger Verticalnaya Mine Project.  The coal deposits are of 
anthracite grade having volatile matter content of less than 8% on a dry, ash free basis.  Moisture content of the 
coal is between 1.5% and 3%.  The calorific value of the coal is typically 7700 kcal/kg (daf).  Ash contents on a 
dry basis, are variable but average 15% for the H11

B seam and 26% for the H10
B seam. 

The coal seam structure, thickness and quality are well defined by the exploration programs undertaken by the 
Ministry of Coal Industry of USSR. 

11 MINERALISATION (COAL SEAMS) 
The two coal seams are contained in competent rock strata, the majority of which are described as sandstone or 
sandy shale (siltstone).  The sandstone and siltstone rocks have compressive strengths in the range 35 to 

165 MPa.  The immediate roof and floor 
strata of the seams have strengths in the 
range 59 to 78 MPa (70 MPa average). 

Within the VNP area the two coal seams of 
interest have not been worked.  Immediately 
to the west of the H11

B resource area, there 
are some old workings in the seam but this 
does not encroach upon the proposed 
working area of this seam. 

The VNP proposes to start working in the 
H11

B seam which has an average full seam 
thickness of 0.76 m. The full seam thickness 
ranges from 0.57 m to 0.96 m in thickness. 
The H10

B seam, some 75 m below the H11
B, 

has an average full seam thickness of 
0.88 m, ranging from 0.64 m to 1.19 m.  
However, this seam has many thin and 
variable non coal partings contributing to 
the overall higher ash content of the seam.  
This seam deteriorates in the eastern part of 
the VNP resource area. 

The generalised vertical section shows the 
position of the H11

B and H10
B seams with 

respect to the H8 seam which is included in 
the Verticalnaya Mine Project.  The VNP 
propose to work the H11

B seam from a level 
of 350 m down to a level of -90 m. The 
proposed workings in the H10

B seam have 
yet to finalised after some further 
exploration work to be undertaken during 
the working of the H11

B seam.

12 EXPLORATION 
Exploration of the coal bearing strata in the area of the Verticalnaya Mine area began in 1930 and the latest 
phase of drilling was completed in the 1970's.  Six exploration and drilling phases have taken place over this 
time totalling some 416 boreholes of which 26 define the area of H11

B and H10
B seams in the VNP area. The 

majority of these were cored boreholes drilled between 1966 and the late 1970's through to the most recent 
boreholes in 1985.  The deposit is regarded as being well defined.   

The original exploration work was directed by The Ministry of Coal Industry of USSR. The latest review of the 
geology and resources was also completed in 1986 by the same ministry.  This original data is now held by The 
Ministry of Coal and Energy of the Ukraine.  ECC has copies of some of the data and have based their proposals 
on the 1986 review and evaluation of resources.  The data examined at the Ukraine Ministry in Lugansk 
(Luganskgiproshakht), now the professional institute with responsibilities to coal mining, is typical of the 
comprehensive borehole data listings, seam plans and reserve block definitions, prepared by the former USSR 
Ministries.  From this data the coal resources were originally calculated according to the FSU standards.   

The standards maintained during the exploration were very thorough and documentation and interpretation were 
to a high standard and can be relied upon.  

Part of the VNP proposals is to drill some further exploration boreholes into the H10
B seam from the H11

B 
workings in order to further define the resources and confirm the coal quality. 

13 DRILLING 
The Verticalnaya Mine area was subject to investigation drilling from 1930.  The original drilling logs are in the 
archive of the Ukraine Ministry of Coal in Kiev.  Original borehole sections, seam plans and documentation are 
held by the Luganskgiproshakht.  The drilling consisted of both open hole and core drilling with some 
geophysical logging in the later phases of investigation.  Borehole deviation measurements were standard. 

The borehole spacing within the VNP area varies from some 400 m to 700 m in the H11
B seam and from 400 m 

to 1100 m in the H10
B seam. This is sufficient to delineate the coal resources in term of physical characteristics

and coal quality. The drilling of the H11
B seam is sufficient to delineate the seam to Measured Resource status 

under the JORC classification. The drilling in the H10
B seam is sufficient to delineate the seam to Indicated 

Resource status under the JORC classification. 

Coal samples were collected from the drill core and subject to analysis, primarily for ash, sulphur and volatile 
matter with additional analysis for calorific value on some samples. In addition to these, some coal samples 
were subject to wash analysis in order to evaluate the yield for the coal washing process. Rock strength 
measurements were recorded for non coal strata in order to assist mine planning.  The borehole distribution 
within the VNP area and immediately adjacent to the area is shown on the plans below:-

14 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
The methods and systems employed throughout the exploration of the coalfield area would have been based on 
Standards laid down by the Ministry of Coal of the former USSR.  A review of the specific methods employed 
to generate the information under review has not been carried out.  However, the level of detail and the method 
of reporting of the information reviewed are consistent with that found on many other projects throughout the 
FSU which have proved to be comprehensive, detailed and reliable.  Every aspect of seam depth, thickness and 
quality was recorded and logged from the borehole programme.  In addition, the nature of the strata was 
analysed, including rock characteristics and strengths.  Coal samples taken during the exploration phase were 
analysed for quality, primarily for ash, sulphur and volatile content but also moisture and calorific value in some 
cases. 

15 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
The quality data reviewed has been obtained over a considerable period of time both during the exploration 
phase and the subsequent operational period of the Verticalnaya Mine.  It is considered that the methods and 
procedures employed in obtaining representative samples, maintaining an appropriate chain of custody, together 
with sample preparation and subsequent analysis would also have been based on the Standards laid down by the 
Ministry of Coal of the former USSR and the appropriate GOST Standards.  Most of the test-work was carried 
out by the appropriate State Authorities.  The washability tests carried out in 1998 were undertaken by the 
independent company CCI Ukraine Ltd who it is understood are certified under ISO 9001/2000. 

There would appear to be no reason to question the adequacy of the procedures employed or the validity of the 
results obtained.   

The quality of the coal seams is well defined by the results of the drilling programmes and analytical data is 
reported for the seams occurring throughout the mine area. The quality of the coal in the VNP area are 
summarised below. 

16 DATA VERIFICATION 
During the visits to the Luganskgiproshakht and the Verticalnaya Mine in 2008, original plans, reports and data 
listings were examined, including the report of the 1986 resource evaluation.  These plans and reports include 
the interpretation of the borehole data showing seam structures, seam thickness and seam qualities. Copies of 
the seam plans and the 1986 evaluation document are held by ECC and have been used in the verification of the 
coal resources of H11

B and H10
B seams for the VNP proposals. 

Within the VNP proposed mining area, the original estimate of reserves for the H11
B seam were estimated as 

being 4.42 Mt in the 1986 report (using the Russian System of Reserve Evaluation – the GKZ System). This 
independent review, using the borehole data, estimates the reserves in the VNP area as being 4.18 Mt. This is 
within 6% of the 1986 estimate. This gives confidence that data and original estimates are reliable. 

17 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
There is one adjacent mine to the area of the Verticalnaya North Project with workings in the H11

B seam located 
to the west along the strike of the seams.  This mine is the Cosmonavtov Mine on the west side along the strike 
of the coal seam.  To the east of the project area is the eastern sector of the Verticalnaya Mine.  However further 
east, the Tsentrosoyuz Mine borders the Verticalnaya Mine along the strike of the coal seam.  No further details 
are available for either the Cosmonavtov Mine or the Tsentrosoyuz Mine. 

18 COAL PROCESSING 

18.1 Data Sources 
The data which has been used in the preparation of this element of the report was the same data used in the 
preparation of the Coal Processing element of the "Technical Report on the Verticalnaya Mine, Ukraine, (NI 43-
101 Standards)" dated September 2008. 

The majority of this information was obtained from the 'Geological Report on the additional exploration and re-
evaluation of the anthracite reserves of the Volodarskava (Verticalnaya) Mine' carried out by the Production 
Association of Mine Geology and Technical Drilling 'Ukruglegeologiay' in 1986. The format of the reports and 
the level of detail included are indicative of the high standards which were laid down by the Ministry of Coal – 
USSR and which governed exploration, sampling, and analysis activities across the former Soviet Union. 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 20 
Ukraine 

 

 
 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

With regard to establishing the representative nature of the data, the procedures and methods employed by the 
State Institutes to generate this data were well established and governed by the appropriate GOST Standards. 

Operational data from the H11 seam at the neighbouring Mine No.3 Davieskaya together with the uncomplicated 
geological nature of the area would support the view that the washability and quality data can be considered 
generally representative of what will be expected from the target seam within the VNP area. 

18.2 Coal Quality and Classification 
The quality data and distribution of boreholes reporting quality data in the H11

In addition to the coal quality data from the borehole programme, there is historic data from the mining of seam 
H11

B at the mine to the west of the Verticalnaya North Project area although this data was not available. 

The coal quality reported by the 1986 Luganskgiproshakht evaluation, using all the quality data for seam H11
B is 

summarised in Table 18-3 below:-

The data points covering the area of seam H11

B forming the basis of the Verticalnaya North Project (VNP) 
indicate that clean coal ashes and full seam ashes are widely variable, ranging from  

• Full seam 4.8% to 20.1% 

• Clean Coal 2.4% to 20.1%  

The coal from the proposed seam is characterised by its high degree of metamorphism.  Quality data from the 
1986 report indicates very high vitrinite reflectance indices, with Ro values for H11 seam of 5.24%, very high 
fixed carbon contents of around 96 – 97%, and very low volatile matter content. On the basis of the analytical 
results, the coals can be identified as Anthracite of class 'A' under the Russian coal classification system and as 
'Anthracite/meta-anthracite' under the ASTM classification system. 

18.3 Coal Processing Options 
The project is targeted to produce from a single operating face at any one time. 

The Company have chosen to focus production on the H11
B seam as, on the basis of the available data, this 

should provide the more consistent clean coal ash content which should help in producing a saleable product 
with the minimum of preparation.  

It is not proposed to provide any coal preparation facilities to upgrade the ROM coal to meet specific market 
requirements. 

The project envisages two possible options for marketing the product from the mine 

1. Dependent on ash content variability, the ROM coal would be put through a simple screening operation 
at a selected size to remove any large contaminant which would include large stone, timber and other 
foreign materials. The undersize would then be transferred to a rail loading point for direct disposal to 
the power station market under a defined supply agreement. 

2. If ash contents are consistently outside the range of the contract specification consideration would be 
given to transporting ROM direct to a local processing plant for upgrading under a defined third party 
contract. 

With the mine having no coal processing facilities, the ability to produce consistent quality products which meet 
target specifications will be totally dependent on the quality of run of mine coal. 

Geological interpretation of the available data indicates that in general there appears to be very little difference 
between the whole seam thickness and the clean coal thickness across the project area and that in the initial 
mining area, with the exception of a thin dirt parting which appears towards the north west of the area, the seam 
is generally a single coal leaf between 0.6 and 1.0 m thick. 

The implication behind the variation in ash content across the proposed take given the lack of dirt partings and 
the very small variation between the clean coal and the full seam sections is that the increase in ash is due to ash 
distribution throughout the seam. 

Historical washability data does indicate that the H11 seam can be upgraded to produce a low ash product if it 
was considered necessary (Ref: Washability test report on ROM from seam H11 at the adjacent Mine No.3 
Davievskaya in 1959).

Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

The mining plan which is based on longwall coal plow technology together with what is considered to be 
competent floor and roof strata should help to reduce near seam dilution and the consequential increase in ash 
content of the ROM product. 

Dilution, which will occur from longwall headings and from the drift drivages following the commencement of 
operations on Longwall 1, will increase the ash content and inconsistency of the ROM product. 

The Company plan to closely monitor the ROM ash content and to take appropriate action should variations 
outside of the contractual limits be experienced. 

Such action could include temporary segregation of high ash batches with controlled blending back of the high 
ash material before despatch. 

Dependent on the effect of such dilution on the product ash content, it may be necessary to segregate such high 
ash batches of ROM and despatch them for washing under a separate contract. 

As an aid to reducing the ash variation in the ROM, when development dirt is being conveyed out of the mine, it 
is intended to separately plow off this material from the drift conveyor and transfer it to the waste pad. 

18.4 Coal Processing Conclusions 
• The available data indicates that the ash content of the ROM coal from the proposed longwall plow 

faces should, under normal operating conditions, fall within a range which will allow direct sale, with 
minimum preparation, and under an appropriate contract, to the domestic power generation market. 

• Known ash variations, together with the dilution effect from longwall headings, drift developments, 
and minor faulting will potentially produce short term high ash variations in the ROM. 

• The proposed system to try and segregate development dirt will be helpful in controlling the variations 
in ROM ash content, but its effectiveness will be dependent on the link between development and 
longwall operating schedules. 

• Close monitoring and control of the mining activities together with a regular routine sampling and 
analysis programme, and appropriate systems for identifying and segregating high ash material should 
help in achieving the Company's objectives. 

19 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATION 
The resources and reserves of the Verticalnaya Mine area were re-estimated in 1986 in line with principles of 
the system of the Ministry of Coal Industry of USSR.  This work was carried out by what is now the 
Luganskgiproshakht.  The system was founded upon the definition of reserve blocks based upon the borehole 
interpretation.  Such features as seam splits, faults or other geological boundaries were used to delineate the 
blocks.  In the area of the VNP, the H11

B seam was defined by 5 blocks and the H10
B seam was defined by 4 

blocks. 

From the 1986 review of the coal resources, the remaining resources reported in the seams of interest in the 
VNP area, in millions of tonnes, are shown in Table 19-1 as follows:- 

Table 19-1 Coal Resources in the Verticalnaya North Project Area (GKZ System, 1986)

B 3.63 0.79 4.42 

Seam H10
B  3.69 3.69 

Total 3.63 4.48 8.11 
 

From these blocks an average seam thickness and specific gravity for the block area were used to calculate the 
in-situ tonnage of coal.  Under this system each block was categorised as A, B C1 or C2, which reflected the 
density of data points available for each reserve block.  Categories A, B and C1, define resources with sufficient 
data to enable mine planning and coal extraction to be evaluated i.e. Measured or Indicated Resource categories 
of the JORC (2004) clasification which are equivalent to the CIM classifications.

For this report, the resources and reserves are quoted with respect the JORC Standard (2004).  For this Standard, 
the Resource and Reserve categories not only reflect the confidence level in the data but also take into account 
the legal, technical, economic and social factors addressed by the VNP Mine Plan.   

It is estimated that in the VNP areas some 4.2 Mt of the H11
B seam are of Measured Resource status with an 

additional 3.8 Mt of H10
B seam of Indicated Resource status.  These resources are tabulated below in Table 

19-2:-

The Proved Reserves of the H11
B seam are defined in three planned mining panels within the Measured 

Resources of the seam.  This is also shown in Table 19-2 above 

Of the 4.2 Mt of Measured Resources in the H11
B seam, some 1.9 Mt of this are in an area which overlaps the 

Measured Resources reported as part of the coal included in the Verticalnaya Mine Project which lies below the 
0.0m level in the H11

B seam.   

Only Longwall 3 encroaches in this area originally assessed as reserves in the Verticalnaya Mine but it is 
considered that the tonnage assessed for this face (557,000 tonnes) will not materially affect the reserves total 
quoted in the NI 43-101 Report.

20 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
See Section 25.1 below in relation to the proposed mine development. 

21 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
IMC concludes from the independent technical review that: 

• management's geological and geotechnical knowledge and understanding is of a satisfactory level to 
support medium term planning for the VNP satellite mine project; 

• the mine plans appropriately consider geological factors to minimise mining hazards; 

• all statutory rights and permits are either in place or there is a reasonable expectation of them being in 
place in the near future to develop the mine; 

• ECC has a verbal agreement to rent the land required for the VNP mine access and surface faciliities 
and will submit a formal application in the near future.  IMC has not identified any issues likely to 
prevent approval of the application; 

• the Company's proposed mining equipment planned in the capital forecasts is suited to its mine plans 
and is adequate, with minor adjustments, for the production plans; 

• the planned infrastructure is capable of supplying appropriate quality ROM products to the markets at 
the forecast production plans; 

• environmental issues are well managed and there are no issues that could materially impede mine 
development nor are any prosecutions pending; 

• A revised feasibility study and environmental assessment must be subject to expert review and 
approval before the ecological certificate and work permits are granted for the VNP.  In IMC's view 
the environmental impacts are manageable and unlikely to be significantly different from those 
connected with the main Verticalnaya Mine; 

• the assumptions used in estimating both capital and operating costs are appropriate and reasonable;

• capital and operating costs used in the financial models incorporating minor adjustments by IMC 
reflect the mine plans, development and construction schedules and the forecast production levels; 

• special factors identified by IMC are well understood by management and appropriate action to 
mitigate these risks is being taken.  Further, the mine plans and cost forecasts appropriately account for 
these risks; 

• based on a review of the available documentation, the Company's technical proposals for the surface 
minerals handling and coal preparation facilities would appear adequate to meet the plan; 

• the available data indicates that the ash content of the ROM coal from the proposed longwall plow 
faces should, under normal operating conditions, fall within a range which will allow direct sale, with 
minimum preparation, and under an appropriate contract, to the domestic power generation market; and 

• yield projections are reasonable but there is the possibility of them being slightly lower dependent to 
some extent on final product quality requirements. 

22 RECOMMENDATIONS 
ECC currently have uncertainties that need to be addressed as soon as is practically possible in the developing 
mine programme: 

1. A revised Mining Plan is currently being prepared by the GOAO Luganskgiproshakht Institute based 
on the ECC design proposals. Once finalised this should be submitted to the Ukrainian State 
Authorities for approval allowing the mine development to proceed. 

2. In order for ECC to proceed with the VNP, Luganskgiproshakht will need to revise the environmental 
assessment (EIA) to take account of environmental effects arising from operations at the VNP site and 
the impact on sensitive receptors, in particular the village of Volodarsk.  

3. A further recommendation is that whilst H11B is being worked the Company should utilise the roadways 
in the H11

B seam to locate a drilling rig to further prove the H10
B seam below.

25 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS ON DEVELOPMENT 
PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES 

25.1 Mining Operations 
Verticalnaya Mine is currently under care and maintenance and non-operational.  The Company intends to open 
a satellite mine, the Verticalnaya North Project, based on new accesses and mine infrastructure to develop 
mining operations in the virgin areas of the H11

B coal seam. 

These facilities are to be developed in accordance with a plan currently being prepared and refined by 
Luganskgiproshakht in conjunction with the Company management. 

25.1.1 Historical Mining Methods and Production 
Mining operations began initially during 1912 when coal was accessed from its outcrop point on the surface via 
inclined drifts locally known as "Number 10 Mine". Later during 1975 mainly for ventilation purposes a vertical 
shaft was sunk down to the then lower workings at the -600 m horizon, "845 m below surface".  This shaft was 
then used for the transportation of men and materials.  Also installed within the same shaft is a second winding 
facility (Cage and balance weight) designed to wind out around 350 t/d of waste rock from development 
drivage. 

As the mine working progressed even deeper to -1000 m level, "1245 m below surface", the government 
provided capital investment for the sinking of a second shaft again for improved ventilation and also to be 
utilised for the winding of mineral (Skip shaft).  The main objective of the new shaft was to replace the long 
string of conveyor belts installed along the length of the existing inclined drifts.  The sinking of this shaft was 
completed just prior to the mine closure in 1998 and was never fully equipped. 

At that time due to lack of investment required to maintain the mine equipment, mine management were unable 
to achieve the planned coal outputs shown Table 25-1 below.  Therefore the mine was considered unprofitable 
and closed passing into the State Enterprise "Ukruglerestructurizatsiya" (UDKR) whose responsibility is the 
liquidation of closed mines.   Some of the mines are put into a care and maintenance scheme as water pumping 
stations to protect the adjacent operating mines from increased water inflows from the closed mines.

25.1.2 Proposed Mining Methods 

25.1.2.1 Mine Layout 
The VNP mine layout is based on the initial development and extraction of coal reserves in H11

B leaving lower 
coal seam H10

B available for extraction at a later time.  It is intended to extract the coal in this satellite block 
with longwall faces 

Development of the mining block will be via two in-seam drifts driven from the surface (Ventilation and 
Conveyor Drifts).  With the full seam dip at the surface being 18-20°, the drifts will be driven cross-dip to make 
sure the angle of apparent dip is not greater than 16° (refer Figure 25-1). 

From these drifts three longwalls driven along the strike of the coal seam will be developed in the coal resources 
to the west of the drifts, extracting the seam in descending order (refer Figure 25-2).

25.1.2.2 Underground 
The life of mine plan is the working of three longwalls, subsequently all mining operations will be undertaken at 
the main mine complex. 

The three longwalls are designated Longwall 1, Longwall 2 and Longwall 3.  Each face will be 270 m long and 
due to the angle of the drifts the longwall panels will be progressively longer.

25.1.2.3 Seam Development 
The two inclined drifts, 30 m apart, will be driven a distance of 450 m from the surface outcrop and an inseam 
connection formed at the base of the drifts.  From the drifts ventilation and conveyor access roadways to the first 
longwall will be driven.  50 m of cover will be left between the higher longwall ventilation gate and the surface.  
The ventilation gate should also be below the oxidized section of the coal seam.  Due to the angle of the drifts 
compared to the line of strike the length of the upper ventilation roadway will be 60 m to the longwall face and 
the lower conveyor roadway will be 190 m. 

The method of drivage of the drifts, in-seam access roadways and the longwall will be by drill and blasting. 

Using solid firing the coal seam will be drilled, fired and loaded out prior to the hard rock section of the 
roadway.  This will separate the coal from the waste materials and also provide a second free-face for blasting 
the rock.  This method will advance the drivage by 2 metres per round giving advance rate of 90 m/month.  The 
advance rate is relaxed to a maximum of 70 m/month for scheduled planning. 

In-seam drivage for the development of the longwall roadways is planned at a maximum drivage rate of 
75 m/month because they are being driven level along the strike. 

Meetings with two companies, Spetspromtehnika and Luganskshakhtoprohodka, have confirmed that 
development rates of 70 m/month on the inclined drifts and 75 m/month on in-seam drivage can be achieved for 
the proposed development of H11

B coal seam at VNP. 

The advance rate for the longwall face start position is planned at 90 m/month as this is a simple inseam drivage. 

The cross-sectional area of all roadways will be a standardised at 16 m2 and two weeks are allowed for the 
erection of a junction during the development programme. 

25.1.2.4 Longwall Development 
Longwall faces will be driven to the rise from the longwall conveyor roadway to a planned length of 270 m 
along the line of dip.  

Two months are allowed for the equipping of a longwall, and its associated production infrastructure. 

All longwalls will be advanced longwall operations utilising a short advanced heading system at each end of the 
longwall face, "using standard arch support". The longwall will be equipped with a plow system along the face-
line for the extraction of coal. 

An advanced heading system is a common method of work for advancing longwalls in Ukrainian mines.  The 
system consists of either a bucket loading or gathering arm loading machine fitted with a boom mounted drill 
rig.  Bore and fire methods are used in the removal of the strata to form the roadway profile which is then 
supported with steel arch supports. 

25.1.2.5 Production 
The planned production from each longwall will peak at 35,000 t/month based on 25 days and a calculated 306 
tonnes per metre of advance which will require 4.5 m advance per day. 

Two mines in the same area of the Ukraine, the Frunze Mine and the Bryanka Mine, have both confirmed that 
the longwall advance rate of 4.5 m is readily achievable and in the past they have achieved in excess of that on 
numerous occasions in Seam H11

B. 

When the first longwall is in production the two inclined drifts will be extended a further 300 m prior to the 
development of Longwall 2 with a similar configuration to access Longwall 3 

To ensure continuity of longwall coal production, Longwall 2 will be driven and equipped whilst Longwall 1 is 
in production ensuring Longwall 2 is ready for coal production when Longwall 1 is finished.  A second set of 
longwall equipment will be purchased for Longwall 2. Equipment from Longwall 1 will be refurbished and 
installed onto Longwall 3, again to ensure continuity of coal production. 

The mining schedule developed shows first coal production in month 19 (Allowing 4 months to obtain land and 
coal production permits.  Each longwall will be worked systematically providing a continuous coal output for 47 
months or 4 years.  In total the three longwalls will produce around 1.5 Mt of saleable product. 

Based on similar operations in the Ukraine and IMC's experience, IMC consider these development and 
production parameters to be testing but achievable with the correct management and equipment.

25.1.3 Proposed Processing/Despatch Arrangements 
It is noted that the project does not include the provision of in-line crushing on the coal transportation system 
from the mine. 

The coal itself is known to be very hard, with a Hardgrove Index <40. This together with the proposed plow 
extraction system should produce a ROM product with a high proportion of large (+100 mm) coal. 

At this stage, it is envisaged that the ROM coal will be screened (utilising conventional mobile screen 
technology) at a nominal top size of 100 mm to screen out contaminant (rock, false roof, timber etc), with the 
<100 mm screen undersize being conveyed to an adjacent rail loading point. 

The projected output rates of 35,000 tonnes per month (25 operating days), is well within the capacity of 
conventional mobile screening technology.  

The Company recognises the potential for maximising coal recovery from the screening operation and will 
incorporate a hand picking facility to remove and recover +100 mm clean coal from the screen oversize.  

Operational experience will allow screening sizes to be optimised to help in controlling the variation in ash 
content of the undersize product.  The Company may also be able to explore the possibility of selectively 
screening out material which may be suitable for the domestic heating and industrial markets. 

In the initial phases of production the Company proposes that saleable coal will be despatched by road trucks to 
the customer. As revenue generation proceeds, the Company will move to establishing a rail loading facility. 

The Company propose to convey the final product to a stock site adjacent to the existing rail line (some 500 m 
away from the drift site) and from there to a rail loading point.  An option being considered is to utilise an 
existing rail loading point situated at a disused quarry adjacent to the mine site. 

The Company also propose to incorporate in-line weighing systems to monitor despatched weights.  

25.2 Markets 
The Company has based its proceeds projections on an indicative target product quality for the domestic 
electricity generation market as shown in Table 25-3 below: 

Table 25-3 Indicative Target Power Station Quality 

Ash 
(% ar) 

Moisture 
(% ar) 

Sulphur 
(% ar) 

Volatiles 
(% daf) 

16.0 8 1.1 3 

 

Any supply contract to the generators will incorporate the base quality standard specification and the maximum 
and minimum range for various quality parameters. It would generally also include a bonus /penalty structure 
based principally on the variations in ash and moisture content of the product. 

The moisture content of the VNP coal should be consistent and is likely to be lower than the indicative target in 
Table 25-3.  

Ash contents will vary throughout the life of each panel due to inherent variations in the clean coal section, 
although, on the basis of the available data, such variations should be manageable within the constraints of an 
appropriate supply contract. 

Short term, high ash variations due to faulting or intermittent dilution from development drivages may require 
appropriate action as indicated above. 

The domestic power generation market for coals of this type is well established. 

Ash, moisture, volatiles and sulphur content of the coal from the VNP as indicated in the available data should 
fall within the limits required of the local generating market although it is considered that consistency of the ash 
content will be a particular issue which will require close attention by the Company. 

Coal ash chemistry and ash fusion characteristics of the VNP coal have not been considered in this report, 
although coal from the target seams has been supplied into the target market for many years and it is considered 
that any potential problems would have been highlighted in the historical documentation relating to the 
development.

25.3  Yield Comment 
The Companies projections are base on an anticipated yield of saleable coal from the ROM of 95%. This 
envisages that all coal produced will be pre-screened to remove contaminants and sold direct to the power 
generating market. 

Whilst the available information would suggest that this figure is a reasonable estimate, should it be necessary to 
wash the ROM under contract washing, as a result of as yet unknown geological conditions or other factors 
which preclude the direct sale of the product, saleable yield will be reduced but with a consequential increase in 
proceeds from the upgraded saleable products.  

25.4 Comments on Costs 
IMC understand that a definitive site layout identifying equipment locations and conveyor connections has not 
yet been established. The capital cost estimates for the surface screening and conveying systems are considered 
reasonable at this stage, until such time as definitive layouts are established when costs will be firmed up. 

It is noted that the Company would have at its disposal a considerable amount of used equipment which already 
exists on the site and it is the intention to utilise this equipment wherever possible. 

Operational costs relating specifically to machine hire and coal stocking and loading are considered reasonable 
at this stage although they may vary as a result of operational experience and the stocking/blending and loadout 
arrangements employed. 

25.5 Environmental Considerations 

25.5.1 Status 
The area and boundaries of the land required for the mine access and surface facilities of the Verticalnaya North 
Project have yet to be defined but ECC proposes to use the site of a former clothing factory approximately 
1.5 km north of Verticalnaya.  A concrete pad and some small concrete buildings are all that remain of the 
previous activities and IMC understands that this land is designated for industrial use.   

The area surrounding this site is not under private ownership and consists of open grass land with scattered trees 
and appears unused for agriculture or grazing.  Some previous disturbance of the area is evidenced by vehicle 
tracks, rail embankments and a small amount of municipal waste. 

Major features visible from the area of the VNP include: 

• A rail line to the west. 

• Overhead power lines 

• The head gear of Verticalnaya Mine, approximately 1.5 km south. 

• Houses of Volodarsk village approximately 500 m to the east/north east. 

25.5.2 Environmental Impact Assessment 
Part 3 of a study prepared by Luganskgiproshakht, Feasibility Report on the Opening and Operation of 
Volodarskiy Mine 1250 m level, is an Estimation of the Influence on the Environment, an EIA. 

The EIA is similar in format to an international class Environmental Social Impact Assessment and its approval 
by the State Ecological Expertise is an essential phase of the permitting process for commencement of mining.   

In IMC's opinion the EIA has assessed all of the critical issues in sufficient detail and proposed suitable methods 
to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts. The main elements of the EIA comprise: 

• Detailed calculations of emissions from the mine and coal preparation plant and assessment of the main 
impacts on the surrounding area and population. 

• Proposed control measures to minimise the impacts. 

• Calculation of payments for environmental damage due to negative impact. 

• Socio –economic issues 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 32 
Ukraine 

 

 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

In order for ECC to proceed with the VNP, Luganskgiproshakht will need to revise the environmental 
assessment (EIA) to take account of environmental effects arising from operations at the VNP site and the 
impact on sensitive receptors, in particular the village of Volodarsk.  

25.5.2.1 Emissions to Air 
According to Ukrainian regulations, sanitary protection zones must be established around processes that emit 
hazardous substances and residential properties are excluded from within the boundaries.  The EIA proposes for 
the main Verticalnaya site protection zones of: 

• 500 m radius around the main surface facilities. 

• 500 m radius around the waste storage facility. 

• 200 m around the settling ponds and domestic sewage treatment facility.  

The EIA includes detailed calculations to estimate the emissions from each source and predictions of the impacts 
on ambient air quality in order for ground level concentrations of sulphur dioxide and coal dust to remain below 
maximum concentration limits at the perimeters of the protection zones  

Table 25-4 Ambient air maximum concentration limits 

Substance Maximum Concentration Limit (mg/m3) 

Sulphur dioxide 0.5 

Nitrogen oxides 0.085 

Carbon monoxide 5.0 

Coal ash 0.3 

Coal dust 0.11 

Welding aerosol 0.5 

 

Luganskgiproshakht has not yet estimated the air emissions resulting from activities at the VNP site but these are 
likely to include: 

• Dust generated during material handling, screening and loading operations. 

• Dust from vehicle movements on unpaved roads. 

• Dust entrained in the mine ventilation air. 

• Particulate matter and products of coal combustion in heating plant gases, assuming a boiler is installed 
for heating mine ventilation air/and or any buildings.   

As part of the revised environmental assessment the impact on the surrounding land, and in particular local 
villages, will be assessed with reference to Ukraine air quality standards given in Table 25-4.  The exact distance 
from Volodarsk to the VNP site is not known but an estimation from the area map supplied indicates a 
separation of approximately 500 m.  Therefore some residential areas lie on or near the boundary of any sanitary 
protection zone likely to be applied to the VNP site. Efficient dust control measures from stationary plant and 
fugitive sources are critical with respect to maintaining air quality standards at the border of the protection zone. 

The coal deposit is not classed as having potential for methane generation.  

An EIA includes detailed calculations to estimate the emissions from each source and predictions of the impacts 
on ambient air quality.  In order for ground level concentrations of sulphur dioxide and coal dust to remain 
below maximum concentration limits at the perimeters of the protection zones, the EIA includes provision for 
increasing the height of items such as a boiler chimney and replacing relatively inefficient cyclone gas cleaning 
systems with wet scrubbers. 

25.5.2.2 Discharge to Surface Water 
Waste waters from mining and operations at the VNP site are not yet assessed.  However the characteristics are 
typical of those arising from the main Verticalnaya site and the methods of treatment are likely to be similar: 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 33 
Ukraine 

 

 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

• Sanitary waste; 

• Rain water run-off from the surface facilities; 

• Mine water pumped to the surface. 

At VNP sanitary waste will be collected and treated using an existing facility approximately 1 km from the 
mine, before discharge to the river.  The treatment system is conventional and consists of mechanical separation, 
sand filtration and then biological treatment using reed beds. 

Rain water run-off from the area of the VNP surface facilities will be collected in reservoirs in which solids are 
settled before the water is discharged. 

Water from the drifts of VNP will be pumped to the surface and then by pipeline to a series of water treatment 
lagoons approximately 1 km to the south.  A preliminary inspection of the topography of the route indicates the 
possibility of drainage by gravity.  Treated water is discharged to the local surface waters.   

The quantity and quality of water have not been assessed but in Luganskgiproshakht's opinion the chemical 
characteristics are likely to be similar to the water presently being pumped from the Verticalnaya Mine although 
with a higher suspended solids due to the mining activities.   

IMC considers this a reasonable assumption and that the proposed treatment method is appropriate.   

25.5.2.3 Waste Materials 
ECC is considering two options for storage of the mining waste arising from the VNP: 

• Transport by truck to the existing Verticalnaya waste storage site, a distance of approximately 10km  
via the existing access route; 

• Deposit on a nearby coal waste dump owned by another company but presently unused. 

Either of these options appear suitable, although the potential costs and legal implications associated with 
depositing waste on a 3rd party site are a potential downside against the advantages of a shorter haulage route.  
The 3rd party waste tip is adjacent to a gravel works and although in reasonable condition does not appear 
managed on a regular basis.  The available capacity of the tip is not known and there are no facilities for the 
management of run-off water. 

Since the coal will not be washed on site prior to sale there will be no requirement for tailings storage. 

25.5.2.4 Noise 
At the VNP site, noise from the ventilation fans and coal screening are potential issues in view of the potential 
for exceedance of noise level standards at some residential areas of Volodarsk located at some 500m distance.  
This should  be assessed in the revised environmental assessment and appropriate mitigation measures 
incorporated into the design and equipment selection.  There may be a requirement for construction of noise 
barriers.     

25.5.2.5 Surface Deformation 
Volodarsk village is not within the boundary of the mining license and will not be affected by mining or drift 
development. 

25.5.2.6 Radioactive Substances 
During previous operations of the Verticalnaya Mine, the mine was tested for radioactivity and concentrations 
were below the Ukrainian regulatory standards.  These checks must be repeated before final approval for 
mining.  The VNP is expected to be similar to Verticalnaya Mine. 

25.5.3 Environmental Management and Monitoring Programmes 
The same rules and regulations will apply to the VNP as apply to the Verticalnaya Mine.  That is: - 

Within 6 months of the date of permit, ECC shall: 

• Carry out a baseline environmental study according to an agreed programme with the State 
Administration of Ecological Resources, with the purpose of measuring its physical parameters as of 
the date of the permit. 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 34 
Ukraine 

 

 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

Within 18 months of registration of permit, ECC shall: 

• Monitor the ecological state of the environment (subsoil, water bodies, soils, bio-resources) in the area 
of mining influence including radiation monitoring according to the programme agreed with the State 
Mining Industry Inspection of Ukraine. 

• Dispose mining dumps and waste materials with minimal influence on the environment, and 
systematically control their state.  

• Arrange mine workings, and surface infrastructure facilities in such a way to exclude harmful influence 
on the environment according to the requirements of industrial safety and subsoil protection as well as 
environmental legislation,  

• Reclaim disturbed soils – until the date of permit expiration.  

• Take all necessary steps to minimise or avoid negative influence of mining practice upon the 
environment. 

The EIA will include a provisional monitoring programme; air emission monitoring will be carried out using 
certified laboratories according to Ukrainian regulation at specified interval as shown in Table 25-5.

Monitoring, according to regulations, is undertaken to assess compliance and environmental payments are based 
on actual emissions, discharges and waste production.  Exceeding the permit conditions normally incurs 
additional taxation based on a higher unit rate for the excess.  The calculation of payment for environmental 
impact is a complex procedure and is made for each pollutant according to various statutory rules and normative 
factors such as: 

• The mass or volume of emission or discharge equivalent to permissible levels. 

• The mass or volume of emission or discharge exceeding permissible levels. 

• The specific payment per tonne of pollutant based on the hazard classification. 

• Coefficients taking into account any ecological peculiarities or socio-economic conditions. 

A preliminary monitoring programme for the VNP site should be established as part of the revised 
environmental assessment and is likley to be similar in scope to the above programme. 

25.5.4 Summary of Key Environmental Issues  
The proposed site for the VNP mine access and surface facilities is on land designated for industrial use. 
Grassland in the immediate vicinity of the VNP site shows evidence of disturbance by previous activities, is not 
privately owned and is not presently used.  IMC has not identified any significant liabilities associated with this 
site. 

The environmental impacts of the VNP are not expected to differ significantly from those already assessed for 
the Verticalnaya Mine.  However, since Volodarsk village lies on or close to the potential boundary of an 
environmental protection zone around the VNP, the facilities and environmental management system require 
careful design in order to comply with Ukrainian air quality standards and noise limits. 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 35 
Ukraine 

 

 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

Water discharged from the VNP is expected to be of similar quality to water pumped from Verticalnaya and can 
be treated to an acceptable standard in the nearby settling lagoons.   

There are adequate facilities for storage of waste rock with easy access.  The absence of a washing plant for 
VNP results in a less complex waste management system. 

25.5.5 Provision for Rehabilitation 

25.5.5.1 Ongoing Rehabilitation 
At this stage, ECC has not developed a formal environmental management system and plan. However, the EIA 
for the Verticalnaya Mine includes measures for environmental protection generally according to the 
requirements of Ukrainian environmental regulations and codes.  These include: 

• Abatement of major emissions to air and establishment of sanitary protection zones around the major 
emissions sources. 

• Pumping and treatment of mine water and re-use where practicable. 

• Treatment of sanitary waste water 

• Storage of mine waste rock and immediate capping and cultivation of the waste dumps. 

• Storage of waste slurry from the coal preparation plant in a safe manner designed to protect ground 
water pollution. 

• Collection and removal of other waste materials. 

25.5.5.2 Closure Restoration 
There is no requirement under Ukrainian Environmental Law to plan or make financial provision for mine 
closure.  

However, the technical document prepared as part of the rental application for the Verticalnaya site, 2008, 
includes a general description of the provisional closure rehabilitation plan.  This is consistent with normal good 
practice and includes measures such as: 

• Preservation of topsoil and subsoils prior to development commencing.  

• On closure - site clearance, sealing of mine access points, replacement of soils and contouring to match 
previous conditions, re-vegetation. 

• Estimates of areas, quantities of soil and vehicle movements involved. 

The technical specification for the VNP land rental application is expected to include similar plans.  

IMC also recommends that ECC's business plan include a mechanism for provision of funds to cover the cost of 
closure restoration in line with international good practice. 

25.6 Management 
Currently there are approximately 104 management and workers employed at the mine engaged in Care and 
Maintenance duties. 

Initially the work programme for the drivage of the inclined drifts will be of a specialist nature and contractors 
will be used to do out this work.  As the underground workings are developed, mine management will employ 
their own workers.  The overall plan is that all operations of and the services to operate the longwalls will be 
carried out by mine personnel. All capital drivage and other specialist activities will continue to be done by 
contract companies.   

Verticalnaya Mine is situated in a mining area and there are two major towns nearby whose population consist 
predominantly of mine workers and their families. Recruitment will not be a problem. 

The wages structure will be based on the normal Ukrainian system which consists of a basic wage plus bonus 
payments (based on achieved objectives).  This policy will be adopted but with some variations, based on 
western experiences, taking into account tried and tested systems of work and payments.  In addition to this 
workers in the Ukraine also receive concessionary fuel as part of their wage.

Ukraine 

 

 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

25.7 Health and Safety 
IMC understands that as the development of the mine begins the new management of the mine will pursue an 
active safety management policy.  Any training programme devised will be approved by the Ukrainian Mine 
Authorities before it is implemented and a record of each individuals training will be maintained at the mine. 

All mining operations will be carried out and managed according to the requirements of the Ukrainian Mining 
Law and Regulations, personnel protective clothing will be issued to all workers and the mine atmosphere will 
be monitored at all times to ensure a good working environment is maintained. 

It will be the policy of mine management to pursue a zero accident policy. If unfortunately an accident does 
occur then a full investigation will be undertaken to ascertain the cause of the accident and to implement new 
procedures to prevent a reoccurrence of similar accidents. Any accident will be recorded and reported in the 
prescribed manner to management, workers, workers representatives and mining authorities. 

25.8 Infrastructure 

25.8.1 Surface 
The existing infrastructure at or close to the VNP site includes: 

• Good access from the main Verticalnaya site by public highway and tracks. 

• A nearby rail line and loading facilities. 

• Water treatment lagoons. 

• Waste storage facilities. 

On the Verticalnaya site the main administration building is functional, and capable of providing the services 
required for management and workers.  A mine boiler is installed and operating and it is planned eventually to 
install a second boiler alongside it to provide for the extra heating requirement when the mine is re-developed.  
ECC plans to use the administration buildings and wash house at the main Verticalnaya site to support the VNP. 

There may be a need to install a small boiler at the VNP site for local heating of any buildings and the mine 
ventilation air. 

25.8.1.1 Electrical Power Supply 
There is an overhead power supply in close proximity of the new drift entrances which supplies electricity to a 
nearby quarry.  This line originally supplied a now closed mine and has the capacity to supply electricity for the 
mining operations planned.  A new sub-station will be built on the mine surface for the connection to the mine 
circuit. 

25.8.1.2 Mine Access 
Development of the mining block will be via two in-seam drifts driven from the surface at the subcrop of the 
H11B seam (Ventilation and Conveyor Drifts).  Due to the fact that the seam dip at the surface is 18-20°, the 
drifts will be driven cross-dip to make sure the angle of dip is not greater than 16°.  The cross sectional area of 
the roadway will be 16 m2.  All drivages will be driven by the drill and blast method. 

25.8.2 Underground 
Longwall faces will be driven to the rise from the longwall conveyor roadway to a planned length of 270 m 
along the line of dip.   Again the roadways for these faces with be driven by drill and blast techniques and will 
be 16 m2 cross sectional area.  The lengths of the roadways varies with the faces, the shortest being on the first 
longwall. 

25.8.2.1 Mine Water 
There are no streams or rivers located above the proposed working area and therefore the only source of water 
will be that which percolates through the strata above the working area from natural rain and snow.  A sump for 
water collection will be constructed at the base of the drifts equipped with pumping facilities to pump the water 
out of the mine to the current mine settling ponds. 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 37 
Ukraine 

 

 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

25.8.2.2 Ventilation 
The first section of the two drifts (450 m) down to the first longwall will be ventilated using auxiliary ventilation 
as per the norm for development works.  After the first cross-cut at this point has been constructed a main mine 
ventilation fan will be installed at the entrance to the ventilation drift.  The air circuit for the main mine fan will 
then be extended as the mine workings progress inbye. Further cross-cuts will be constructed for ventilation 
purposes at the location of the second and third longwalls.   

25.8.2.3 Methane Gas 
At the Verticalnaya Mine the measured amount of methane gas contained within the coal seam does not exceed 
0.8 m3/tonne of coal with the average of 0.1 m3/tonne of coal.  Therefore the mine under the Ukrainian Mining 
legislation is classed as a naked flame mine i.e. none gassy.   

VNP is expected to have a similar rating to Verticalnaya although the H11
B seam has not been worked at the 

mine.  Where this seam is expected to be worked it will be close to the surface and gas contents are expected to 
be very low. 

The coal seams under the same classification system are considered not to be dangerous with regard to coal dust 
explodibility and spontaneous combustion.  Also there is no gas under pressure within the coal seam and 
surrounding strata eliminating the danger of sudden gas outbursts or rock bumps. 

25.8.2.4 Mineral Transportation 
The transport system for mineral from longwalls and development is designed to by via conveyor belt to the 
surface. 

25.8.2.5 Men and Materials 
Men and materials will be transported into and out of the mine along the ventilation drift by a rope haulage 
system.  The men will be travel in purpose built manriding cars equipped with all the relevant safety equipment. 

Materials will be transported using the same haulage system, but not at the same time as the workers.  Additional 
drift haulage will be installed in the conveyor drift for the transport of materials only. 

Along the longwall roadways there will be only haulage facilities for the transport of materials and workers will 
walk inbye to the longwall faces.  Man riding facilities installed on the longwall conveyor belt will be provided 
for the outward journey. 

25.9 Taxes 
At the present moment mining companies activity in Ukraine is controlled by the Constitution of Ukraine, the 
Ukrainian Mining Law, the Bowels Code, Environmental Protection Law of Ukraine, Search and rescue services 
Law of Ukraine, the Civil Defence Law of Ukraine, Labour safety Law of Ukraine and other acts.  

According to the Taxation Law regime of Ukraine the rates of taxes, charges and other obligatory payments in 
Ukraine and also privileges relating to taxation are established exclusively by the taxation laws. The coal 
industry enterprises are tax payers in accordance with general practice established by operating tax laws.  

The main source of investment to the enterprises of Ukraine which is not subject to the taxation is payments in 
the authorised capital of the company. Thus the person who is the participant of any society in Ukraine has the 
right to form an authorised capital stock or to increase the authorised capital stock by money resources or 
property. Such investments entering and withdrawal is not assessed. 

25.9.1 Charges and Taxes 

25.9.1.1 Profits Tax 
The Tax legislation in Ukraine as for September 15th, 2008 doesn't contain any privileges for coal-mining 
enterprises (mines). The taxation is being executed on the basis of general taxation.  

According to the Enterprises' profits taxation Law of Ukraine № 334/94-ВР from 28.12.1994 the general rate of 
profits tax in Ukraine amounts to 25% from the object of taxation. Profits tax is to be paid for any income 
received by residents or non-residents from any kinds of activity within the territory of Ukraine, including 
interest, dividends, royalties and any other kind of passive income.  

Profit of the tax payer (of the mine) is computed by the following calculation: 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 38 
Ukraine 

 

 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

Gross Revenue – Total Expenses = Taxable Profit 

The profit is calculated quarterly on the result accruing through the year. The accounting periods for the profits 
tax is quarterly and yearly. Declarations for the profits tax are to be made quarterly and at the end of the year the 
annual declaration is to be made. Based on results the profits tax is paid to the state treasury. 

25.9.1.2 Dividends Taxation 
The Issuer of the corporate rights can make the decision on payment of dividends to participants of the company. 
Payment of dividends is made proportionally to the share of the participant (shareholder) in the authorised 
capital stock of the enterprise/issuer of such corporate rights irrespective of whether activity of such enterprise-
issuer was profitable throughout the accounting period under the presence of other sources for dividends 
payment or whether there is available profit calculated by the rules of the tax account. The enterprise/issuer 
which pays the dividends, pays an advance payment of the profits tax at a rate of 25% of accrued dividends 
which is included into the total tax sum in subsequent declaration, i.e. in the following period the accrued profits 
tax will be decreased by the sum of the paid dividends.  

25.9.1.3 Non-Residents Taxation 
Taxation of non-residents is ruled by the Article 13 of the Enterprises' profits taxation Law of Ukraine № 
334/94-ВР from 28.12.1994. 

Any income of the non-residents received from the economical activity within the territory of Ukraine (including 
the dividends paid by the resident which are subject to taxation at a rate of 15%). The resident intending to 
transfer to the non-resident any payouts from the revenue received by such non-resident and originated in 
Ukraine has to withhold the tax at a rate of 15% from the sum of the revenue and, except as otherwise provided 
by the international regulations of agreements, to remit the tax to the budget within the period of such payout. 

According to the article 10 of the Convention signed by Ukraine and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland concerning the elimination of double taxation and prevention of tax evasion relating to the 
profits tax and property price appreciation tax from 10.02.93: 

Dividends can be assessed in other contractual states, in this case Canada. 

The dividends may be also subject to taxation in the contractual State the resident of which is the company 
paying dividends according to the Legislation of the State (Ukraine) in the case if the recipient actually has the 
right for the dividends and is the subject to dividends taxation within the State the tax doesn't have to exceed: 

a) 5% of the total sum of the dividends in the case when the right for the dividends belongs to the voting 
company which controls straight or immediately at least 20% of the capital of the company paying 
dividends (in the case of UK) and at least 20% of the authorised capital (in the case of Ukraine). 

b) 10% of the total sum of dividends in other cases 

25.9.2 Value Added Tax (VAT) 
Value-added tax in Ukraine is discharged according to the Value-Added Tax Law of Ukraine № 168/97  from 
03.04.1997. The rate of the tax is 20% to the assessment basis as stated in the article 4 of the Law and is added 
to the price of the goods (services). The sum of the tax liable to payment to the state budget for the results of the 
accounting period calculated in the declaration is defined as the difference between the accounting period tax 
liabilities and the tax credits. If in the result of such calculation the declaration shows a net positive sum it is to 
be paid to the state budget, if the sum is negative the payer has the choice to a credit on their account or 
compensate against the tax payer's account.  

The VAT payer can choose monthly or quarterly reporting tax period.  VAT payers (mines) hand over 
declarations under the VAT monthly and by results of the declaration pay the tax. For export of goods a 0% rate 
of VAT is applied. Thus it is likely that the sum of the VAT paid to suppliers of raw materials, works and 
services for manufacture of the exported goods will exceed the sum of the VAT collected, that is the sum of the 
tax credit will exceed the sum of tax obligations and the tax payer will have a right to receipt from the state 
budget of the net overpayment of VAT. 

25.9.3 Currency Exchange Regulation 
Currency exchange regulation within Ukraine is regulated by the Procedures of foreign currency exchange Law 
of Ukraine № 185-94/ВР from 23.09.1994 according to which inclusion of the exported goods currency earnings 
should be transferred to Ukrainian enterprise accounts not later than in 180 calendar days after customs 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 39 
Ukraine 

 

 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

registration of cargo. The same rule governs the import of goods when the resident of Ukraine lists an advance 
payment for the goods outside of Ukraine. Such goods should be delivered to Ukraine not later than in 180 
calendar days after customs registration of cargo otherwise the advance payment is to be returned. For 
infringement of the above-stated terms a penalty can be applied to the infringing Company at a rate of 0.3% of 
the late payment (cost of the goods which were failed to deliver) for each day of delay. 

25.9.4 Customs Duties 
According to the Custom schedule of Ukraine stated by the Law of Ukraine N 1109-V from 31.05.2007 the coal 
export duty in Ukraine is 0%. Thus coal production exports outside the customs border of Ukraine are realised 
without additional expenses.  

25.9.5 Charges for Remuneration of Labour Fund 
Essential tax loading in Ukraine make the charges for remuneration of labour fund which consist of: 

• Pension fund charges   33.2%  
• Unemployment case charges   1.3%  
• Accidents on manufacture charges  1.9%  
• Social insurance     1.5% 

25.9.6 Mining Royalty and Geological Works Charges 
As stated in the Article 19 of the Bowels Code of Ukraine the mines can be operated only by the enterprises 
holding a special licence. ESS Company has such licence established according to legislation of Ukraine at a 
price of 2,475,200 Hrivnas.  At the present moment prior to the commencement of coal extraction additional 
payments are not paid. However after the commencement of coal mining the enterprise should pay annual 
payments for the mine operation. Annually payments for mine operation are established by State budget of 
Ukraine Law of Ukraine for corresponding year. So according to the State budget 2008 of Ukraine Law base 
specifications of payments for mine using were established. Thus after the commencement of coal mining the 
enterprise should pay 2 Hrivnas for each tonne of coal including anthracite (provided that at the moment of the 
extraction commencing the rate of the payment will not be changed). 

Geological works charges executed at the expense of the state budget makes 0 Hrivnas 47 Kopecks for one 
tonne of the extinguished coal. However specifications of the given charge are subject to indexation taking into 
account officially established index of inflation. In connection to this the sum of 47 Kopecks varies constantly 
depending on inflation fluctuation in the country. The given charge is paid once in a quarter. 

25.10 Capital and Operating Cost Estimates 

25.10.1 Capital Estimate 
Estimates of capital expenditure have been made using prices as at the end of April 2009 and the project is 
deemed to start at the beginning of June 2009. Capital expenditure for developing the mine project for the initial 
period until production from the first face plus additional expenditure over the remaining life to maintain 
production is estimated at $US25.0 million. Phasing of this expenditure, over the term of the project is shown in 
Table 25-6 below.

25.11 Economic Analysis 
The results detailed below of the economic analysis and the accompanying sensitivity analyses are based on the 
"Most Realistic" production scenario for Verticalnaya North. 

25.11.1 Economic Analysis of the Verticalnaya Mine 
Based upon the assessment of Proven and Probable Reserves scheduled for extraction within the production 
schedule prepared by the company, an economic analysis of the Verticalnaya Project is presented as Table 25-9. 

Sales revenues have been assessed on the basis of one grade of coal being sold into the domestic power market. 
The model assumes that a recovery of saleable coal from ROM of 95% is achieved. An average sales price of 
$62.50 has been assumed. An exchange rate of 8 UAH:1 USD has been assumed. 

VAT is assumed to be paid on a monthly basis so that there are no timing differences to take into account. Profit 
tax is assumed to be paid quarterly. Further, it has been assumed that losses in any period can be accumulated 
and used to offset subsequent tax liability. 

An evaluation of the project based upon a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology has been completed using a 
discount rate of 12% and a 65 month life of mine, including the initial development period, as described in 
Section 25.10.  This analysis has been prepared on an all-equity, post-tax basis.  This evaluation, and results at 
differing discounting rates, are given in the table below. 

Table 25-9 Evaluation of the Project at a Range of Discounting Rates 

Discount Rate NPV (US$ '000) 

+2% 13,149 

+1% 13,997 

12% (base rate) 14,885 

-1% 15,816 

-2% 16,790 

The internal rate of return of the project, as described above, is 42.7% 

25.11.2 Sensitivity Analysis 
A sensitivity analysis for cash flow and net present value (NPV) has been undertaken with respect to variation in 
sales prices, output, operating and capital investment costs. Mining and marketing of coal contain variables that 



Technical Report Final Report  Page 42 
Ukraine 

 

 
Lysander Minerals Corporation  IMC Group Consulting Ltd 
Project 688C VNP 43-101 Final R07  March 2010 

are not always predictable. Potential variables include those directly associated with the mining and processing 
operations, such as cost and production levels, as well as those that are external to the mining and processing 
operations, such as market prices. 

While the NPV of the Verticalnaya operations, as presented above, is realistic relative to the life of mine plans 
(based on reserves but not resources), a sensitivity analysis has been prepared for the following variables. 

25.11.2.1 Operating Cost 
This could vary as a result of changes in component costs, such as labour or supplies, or from variances in 
productivity.  A sensitivity of plus 10% operating cost has been calculated. 

25.11.2.2 Production 
Production level can be affected by variances in productivity or market place demands. A sensitivity of minus 
10% in production has been calculated. 

25.11.2.3 Capital Cost 
Variances in capital costs could result from quantity or market prices of capital items. A sensitivity of plus 10% 
in capital costs has been calculated. 

25.11.2.4 Coal Prices 
The sensitivity impact of a minus 10% change in coal prices has been calculated. 

A summary of the effect of sensitivity of the valuation of reserves to these variables is given in Table 25-10 
below.

Based on post tax results 14,885 12,683 10,579 13,874 10,425 

25.12 Payback 
The financial appraisal and cash flow analysis has been carried out on the basis of all-equity funding and as such 
no interest is shown. 

On this basis the project shows an undiscounted payback period of 41 months. 

25.13 Mine Life 
Based on the reserves and resources available to the mine within the existing mining licence area the mine has a 
life of 65 months including the initial development period. 

26 ILLUSTRATIONS 
The following illustrations should be read in conjunction with the development plans for the mine contained in 
Section 25 above.

Sample  A representative fraction of a coal seam collected by approved methods, guarded against 
contamination, and analysed to determine the nature, chemical, mineralogical or petrographic 
composition, percentage content of specified constituents, and heat value. 

Sampling Taking small pieces of rock at intervals along exposed mineralisation for assay (to determine the 
mineral content). 

Screen A device for separating by size. 
Seam A layer or bed of coal.  Correlated seams of coal are normally assigned a name, letter or number.  A 

single seam can contain one or more non-coal partings resulting in a sub-division into leaves.  

Seam outcrop A manifestation of a coal seam at the Earth's surface. 
Seam splitting  When a coal seam splits into two or more leaves or subsidiary seams. 
Sedimentary Formed by the deposition of solid fragmental material that originates from weathering of rocks and 

is transported from a source to a site of deposition. 

Sedimentation Letting solids settle out of wastewater by gravity during wastewater treatment. 
Sediments Soil, sand, and minerals washed from land into water, usually after rain. Sediments pile up in 

reservoirs, rivers, and harbours, destroying fish-nesting areas and holes of water animals and 
clouding the water so that needed sunlight may not reach aquatic plants. Careless farming, mining, 
and building activities will expose sediment materials, allowing them to be washed off the land 
after rainfalls. 

Settling

A holding area for wastewater in which heavier particles sink to the bottom for removal and 
disposal. 

Sewage The waste and wastewater produced by residential and commercial establishments and discharged 
into sewers. 

Shaft A mine-working (usually vertical) used to transport miners, supplies, ore, or waste. 
Shaft pillar  A prescribed area of ground around the shaft in which mining is not permitted. The pillar affords 

stability to the shaft ensuring this essential access is preserved. 

Shearer A machine used for cutting coal on a longwall face.  (Usually in Russian called a combine) 
Skip The conveyance/vessel into which coal/ore is tipped at the bottom of the shaft and then hoists to the 

top where the ore is tipped into a receiving bin and then the cycle is repeated. 

Slurry A suspension of coal or waste in water. 
Smoke Particles suspended in air after incomplete combustion of materials. 
Split An in-seam parting which attains a thickness such that the resultant leaves of coal are considered as 

separate seams from a mining point of view. 

Spontaneous 
combustion 

The propensity of some types of coal to oxidise rapidly on contact with air.  The oxidation reactions 
produce heat that increases the rate of oxidation to the point that the coal ignites.  Low-rank coals 
are the most prone to spontaneous combustion. 

Steam coal Coal which will be used for steam generation principally in thermal power plants.  
Steel arches Arches made in sections of steel which can be bolted together to form a roof supporting a 

deforming roof. 
Stockpile An accumulation of ore or mineral.

V Volts. 
Ventilation Air coursed around a mine to provide a working environment to both men and machines. 
Volatile Matter 
Content; VM 

That portion of the coal comprising both gases and liquids that is released following heating it from 
105°C to 800°C.  The amount of volatile matter in a coal is a function of the rank of the coal 
(thermal maturity) and of the coal type.  High rank coals have a low volatile matter content (<20%) 
medium rank coals have a higher volatile matter content (20 – 30%) and low rank coals have a high 
percentage of volatile matter.  The type of coal also effects volatile matter, coal with a high 
inertinite content will produce less volatile matter than a coal with high vitrinite content that will 
produce less volatile matter than a coal with high liptinite content. 

W Watts. 
Washability Result of a laboratory test that separates a sample of coal into different density fraction.  Is used to 

predict plant performance. 

Washing Plant A plant designed to size and clean material to produce pre-determined sizes of product.
