1.  SUMMARY 
 
In a letter dated 1 February, 2007 Canada Enerco Corporation ("CEC"), of Toronto, 
Ontario, Canada retained Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited ("WGM") to undertake an 
evaluation of a group of uranium properties (the "Property") located in Beange, Buckles, 
Bouck, Gunterman and Joubin Townships, near the town of Elliot Lake in north-central 
Ontario. 
 
The above-mentioned townships cover much of the famous Elliot Lake mining camp which 
produced uranium during the period 1955 through 1996.  By the time the last mines closed in 
the mid-1990s, a total of 362 million pounds of uranium oxide (313.5 Mlbs uranium metal) 
was produced from 13 underground mines having an average grade of approximately 0.106% 
U3O8 (898 ppm U or 2.12 lbs U3O8 per short ton).  Many of the mines closed in the early 
1980s at a time when uranium prices were falling due to rapidly accumulating uranium 
stockpiles in many countries, including Canada.  At the same time, energy prices were rising, 
inflation rates were in excess of 10% and interest rates exceeded 15%.  The mines closed due 
to simple economic pressures, and not as a result of resource depletion.  The remaining 
uranium resources included several zones that had been discovered through drilling, but 
never developed. 
 
The area is underlain by the Huronian Supergroup, a southward-thickening, mainly clastic 
succession which is well exposed north of Lake Huron.  The uranium-rare earth deposits are 
hosted in quartz-pebble conglomerates that are located in the lower part of the Matinenda 
Formation, the basal unit of the Elliot Lake Group, and only a short distance above 
crystalline Archean basement rocks.  Uranium and rare earth element ("REE") 
mineralization is stratabound, showing good consistency in grade and thickness over wide 
areas, both along strike and down dip.  The uranium mineralization is predominantly 
uraninite, coffinite and uranothorite, most of which are readily leachable, and this facilitated 
high recoveries, typically 95%, in the operating mines.  These minerals carry economically 
important amounts of yttrium which was historically co-produced at the uranium mines.  The 
balance of the yttrium and the other REEs are dominantly contained in monazite. 
 
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Kerr McGee Corporation ("Kerr McGee"), a major US 
uranium producer, acquired a large group of mining claims covering key portions of the 
Elliot Lake basin.  Ker McGee completed diamond drill holes in areas not formerly tested, or 
where earlier holes had failed to reach the uranium-bearing horizons.  Following this drilling 
in the Banana Lake area, Mr. Doug Sprague, P.Eng., Chief Geologist for Rio Algom Ltd. 



  
 

 - 2 - 

("RIO") estimated  the potential resource in the Banana Lake area at 176 million short tons 
with a grade of  0.76 lbs U3O8/ton over an average thickness of 5.36 m (17.6 feet).  REE 
contents were not determined at the time because the market for these metals was quite 
limited.  Sprague's estimate was based on a limited number of widely spaced holes, and the 
fact that the uranium-bearing horizons demonstrated remarkable lateral and down-dip 
continuity over a very large area.  Subsequent historical estimates thought to be authored by 
Sprague and shown on a RIO map (Rio Algom, 1979), were based on mine data as well as a 
series of deep drill holes completed by Kerr McGee and other exploration companies in 
widely separated areas of the Property.  RIO's estimates increased the total remaining 
uranium resource to approximately 200 million pounds of U3O8.  These historical resources, 
located in five separate zones down-dip from past-producing mines, are summarized as: 

Zone Quantity 
(tons) 

Grade

Contained U3O8 
(lbs) 

Teasdale Lake 17,458,200 1.206 20,787,200 
Gemico Block #3 42,800,000 0.38 16,264,000 
Gemico Block #10 20,700,000 0.75 15,525,000 
Banana Lake Zone 175,800,000 0.76 133,608,000 
Canuc Zone 7,000,000 1.86 13,020,000 

Total 263,758,200 0.76 199,204,200 
 
The foregoing historical resources were not estimated in accordance with definitions and 
practices established for the estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves by the 
Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy ("CIM").  As such, the historical resources are 
not compliant with Canada's security rule National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"), and 
are unreliable for investment decisions.  Neither Appia nor its Qualified Persons have done 
sufficient work to classify the historical resources as current mineral resources under current 
mineral resource terminology and are not treating the historical resources as current mineral 
resources.  Nevertheless, most of the historical resources were estimated by mining 
companies active in the Elliot Lake camp using assumptions, methods and practices that were 
accepted at the time, and based on corroborative mining experience. 
 
The purpose of WGM's initial review was to document the historical uranium resource 
estimates pertaining to the CEC claims, as well as to conceptually explore the conditions 
required in order for the resources to be economically viable.  In an agreement dated 1 Nov., 
2007, Appia Energy Corp. ("Appia") optioned the Property from CEC and WGM's 
contractual responsibilities were modified accordingly.  Since that time, WGM has prepared 
several up-dates to the Mineral Resources.  The current Mineral Resources, as stated herein 



  
 

 - 3 - 

and has been prepared in accordance with the terms of an agreement between Appia and 
WGM dated 31 October, 2012. 
 
In accordance with WGM's recommendations, Appia carried out two programs of diamond 
drilling, the first during 2007-08 which confirmed the presence of uranium resources in the 
areas tested and provided the basis for initial resource estimates in the Teasdale Zone and the 
Banana Lake Zone, and the second during 2012 which focused on the Teasdale Zone and 
supported the current up-dated Mineral Resources estimates for that zone.    Through the use 
of twinned, wedged and step-out drill holes, WGM and Appia have confirmed the borehole 
data on which the Banana Lake and Teasdale Lake estimates were based.  WGM prepared its 
estimates for mineralized zones belonging to the Banana Lake and Teasdale Zones on the 
basis of sufficient data to show continuity of geology and grades.  The current Mineral 
Resources estimates are contained in Workman and Breede (2011) and are summarized 
herein. The Banana Lake and Teasdale Zones are widely separated and are unlikely to be 
mined from a single point of entry (ramp or shaft). 
 
The Banana Lake Mineral Resources estimate (Table 1) was prepared from a block model 
using a 0.6 lb U3O8/ton cut-off grade, a minimum vertical thickness of 5 m, and based on the 
assumption that material from this deposit would be refined in a central milling facility that 
would accommodate Appia's operations and, potentially, neighbouring mining operations in 
the Elliot Lake camp, thus significantly reducing capital and operating costs (Workman and 
Breede).  The increased minimum thickness was imposed by WGM to provide a basis for the 
use of larger underground equipment as a cost-reduction strategy, however this restriction 
had little impact on the contained resources.

Notes: 1. Effective, 1 April, 2011 
2. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially 

affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues.  
3. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define 

these Inferred Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an 
Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource category. 

4. The Mineral Resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, 
Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council December 11, 2005.  These 
definitions are provided in Section 17.1 of this report. 

5. S.G. of 2.85 tonnes/m3 (or 3.14 tons/m3) was used. 
6. Indicated amounts may not precisely sum due to rounding.

The estimate of the Mineral Resources in the Teasdale Zone (Table 2) was initially reported 
in Workman and Breede (2011) and prepared from a polygonal model using a geological cut-
off and a minimum bed thickness of 2.44 m (8 ft.) which takes into consideration the 
continuity of grade within the various mineralized beds and historical mining practices.  The 
mineralized zone was geologically constrained by the well defined markers provided by the 
upper surface of the highest mineralized bed and the lower surface of the basal bed.   The 
resources were reported for each of the three geological units that comprise the mineralized 
zone:  Upper Reef ("UR"), Intermediate Quartzite ("IQ") and Lower Reef ("LR").  As a 
result of the inclusion of the UR to incorporate its significant REE content as well as the IQ, 
neither of which were mined historically, all drill hole intersections substantially exceeded 
the minimum thickness.  No grade cut-off or high capping was used for this estimate as the 
grades were themselves quite robust and the utilization of a cut-off grade would require 
complex economic modelling of individual metals that is not required at this time. 
 
This report encompasses the results of the most recent drilling on the Teasdale Zone and an 
up-dated Mineral Resources estimate for that zone.  The report also incorporates the results 
of a recently completed metallurgical testing program that has identified beneficiation as a 
key step in the processing of Teasdale mineralization.  The current Mineral Resources for the 
Teasdale Zone are stated as follows in Table 2 and as detailed in Table 3 for rare earth 
metals.

Notes: 1. Mineral Resources effective 30 July, 2013 
2. Mineral Resources are estimated at a cut-off value of $100 per tonne, using a uranium price of US$70/lb U3O8, a TREE

price of $78/kg, and a C$:US$ exchange rate of 1:0.9. 
3. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The estimate of

Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political,
marketing, or other relevant issues.  

4. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been
insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource and it is
uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource category. 

5. The Mineral Resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum standards on
Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve
Definitions and adopted by CIM Council December 11, 2005.  These definitions are provided in Section 17.1 of this
report. 

6. S.G. of 2.85 tonnes/m3 (or 3.14 tons/m3) was used. 
7. Indicated amounts may not precisely sum due to rounding. 

 

 
As is clear from the foregoing estimate, the total rare metal content of the Teasdale Zone is 
approximately 6 times the uranium content if the resource is predominantly constrained by 
geology and is not constrained in respect to a uranium cut-off grade.  While this approach 
results in the inclusion of lower grading uranium mineralization, it does incorporate large 
volumes of economically interesting REE mineralization. 
 
Preliminary testwork and analysis carried out at the SGS Canada facility in Lakefield, 
Ontario indicates that a flotation-concentrate acid bake process route combined with a 
tailings leach can result in a high extraction of U (~90%) and most REEs (80-90%) from 
Appia's Teasdale uranium-rare earth deposit.  It is believed that planned additional testwork 
and data analysis will substantiate these data and probably lead to reduced overall processing 
costs and improved recovery.

WGM carried out site visits to the Elliot Lake property during 2007 and 2009 to review the 
geology, to locate historical drill hole collars, to examine and check sample drill core and to 
meet with company representatives concerning the project's accomplishments and future 
plans.  WGM also met with officials of two key Ontario ministries:  the Ministry of Northern 
Development and Mines and the Ministry of the Environment.  These site visits and the work 
completed during each are described in Appia's more recent technical report that was 
authored by WGM in compliance with NI 43-101 (Workman and Breede, 2011).  Although 
the most recent drilling was carried out under the close scrutiny of WGM and under the 
supervision of QP Alan MacEachern, P.Geo., WGM revisited the project site in July, 2013 
for discussions with Mr. MacEachern and visits to a selection of drill sites for confirmation 
purposes.  All work was found to have been completed in accordance with WGM's 
instructions and in accordance with industry best practices standards. 
 
The commercial viability of REE mineralization was previously demonstrated by the 
historical recovery of yttrium as a by-product of uranium production at the Elliot Lake mines.  
These operations proved that separate facilities were not required to leach the REEs, and that 
once in solution, yttrium could be easily recovered.  However the mine operators ignored the 
other REEs because the market was adequately served by deposits elsewhere.  As noted in 
Workman and Breede (2011), Appia's drilling provided the opportunity to analyse the drill 
core for uranium and REEs and thereby estimate the size and potential of these resources 
present in that part of the Teasdale Zone drilled by Appia.  To WGM's knowledge, the REE 
potential had never been investigated in the past.  A significant number of historical drill 
holes completed by Conecho Corp. are known to have economically interesting LR 
intersections well beyond the limits of the area drilled by Appia at this time.  The size of the 
Teasdale Zone is therefore likely to be increased with additional drilling which will test all 
horizons for both U and REEs. 
 
At present, Appia plans to produce a high-value REE-uranium concentrate through 
beneficiation of the ore prior to leaching.  Appia's assay data indicates that the value of the 
project vests mainly in uranium and some of the REEs present, predominantly in cerium, 
lanthanum, neodymium and yttrium which account for 86.3% of the total REEs present.  
Appia's initial review suggests that the project economics hinge on a higher uranium price 
than is present at this time, potentially as high as $75/lb U3O8, however current market 
forecasts indicate that this price should be achievable given long-term supply-demand 
fundamentals.  This price model has recently been used by Pele Mountain Resources Inc. 
("Pele"), a junior exploration company that is exploring its Eco Ridge uranium project which 
is an "Adjacent Property" in the context of NI 43-101. 



  
 

 - 7 - 

 
Pele provided an up-dated Mineral Resources estimate in a report publicly available on the 
SEDAR website dated 5 April, 2011 in which Indicated Resources of 14.31 Mt were reported 
grading 0.048% U3O8 (0.96 lbs U3O8 per ton) and 0.164% total rare earth elements ("REE"s) 
or 3.28 lbs/ton with additional Inferred Resources of 33.12 Mt grading 0.043% U3O8 (0.86 
lbs U3O8 per ton) and 0.132% total REEs or 2.64 lbs/ton (Ciuculescu, 2011).  The total 
contained metal was 15.2 million pounds of U3O8 and 51.9 Mlbs of REEs in the Indicated 
category and 31.4 Mlbs of U3O8 and 96.4 Mlbs of REEs in the Inferred category.  The 
resources were based on a cut-off grade of 0.028% U3O8 and a long term uranium price of 
$60 per pound of uranium oxide (the current price is stable at $68).  In July, 2011, Pele 
announced the results of a new Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") for the Eco 
Ridge Project, including the following key findings based on a 9,400-tonne per day operation 
with life-of-mine production of 10.7 Mlbs of total rare earth oxides (REOs) and 24.9 Mlbs of 
U3O8 over a 14-year mine life: 

• cumulative operating cash flow of US$1.72-billion 

• cumulative pre-tax cash flow of US$1.31-billion 

• positive NPV of $533 million (at a 10% discount rate) 

• internal rate of return (IRR) of 47 percent (47%) 

• operating cash cost of US $16 per pound U3O8, net of REO credits 

• start-up capital costs of US $212 million and sustaining capital costs of US $195 
million. 

 
WGM and Appia assessed the Eco Ridge results and it believes that the foregoing costs offer 
guidance in respect to exploiting the Teasdale Zone resource which may potentially be much 
larger and higher grading.  Historical production information for the Elliot Lake uranium 
mines does not include rare earth metal data other than some yttrium co-production data that 
is not specific to individual mines.  Although it is likely that the major producers estimated 
the global rare metal content of the uranium ores, none of this information seems to be is in 
the public domain.  As a result of the historical core being unavailable for reanalysis, Appia 
could rely only on its own drilling and REE assay data for resource estimation.  WGM found 
that within the zone occupied by the uranium-bearing "reefs", REE mineralization was far 
more prevalent and blanketed across all of the uranium-bearing horizons. 

 
An understanding of the dynamics of the uranium and REE markets is vital in opining on the 
future conditions under which the Appia project might be developed.  Uranium prices have 
been affected on many occasions by the anti-nuclear sentiment that flared in the shadow of 



  
 

 - 8 - 

high-profile accidents such as Three Mile Island in the United States, Chernobyl in the 
Ukraine and most recently Fukishima in Japan.  Media hype and political hyperbole did 
great, though mostly short-term, harm to the nuclear industry and uranium prices fell 
accordingly.  The REE markets during the last 10 years have been as politicized as the 
uranium market, although for different reasons largely due to China's overwhelming control 
of REE production.  China has used its clout to influence foreign REE manufacturers to 
transfer technology to China in return for assured supplies.  This has resulted in a flurry of 
new REE projects and the development of REE-replacement alternatives where possible. 
 
At about the time Appia's Elliot Lake project was initiated, the Spot Market price on 6 June, 
2007 was US$135 per lb of U3O8 versus approximately $40 at the time of writing this report 
in June, 2013, a price retreat of approximately 70%.  The less volatile Term Market price at 
that time was $95 versus $57 at this date, a retreat of 40%.  However, it important to note that 
the Spot Price is the discount price and not the price at which most uranium is delivered to 
energy utilities.  As of the date of this report, the Spot and Term prices are still recovering 
from the effects of the Fukushima Daiichi tsunami disaster in 2011 which was used by the 
media, anti-nuclear activists, and opposition governments to cast unjustifiable dispersions on 
the nuclear energy industry.  Even Japan, having understandable concerns about reactor 
safety in an area with clear geohazards concerns, has re-stated its support of the industry and 
applications are being studied for the restart of 10 reactors idled since early 2011. 
 
Utilities are intermittently buying in the Spot Market to supplement nuclear fuel supplies 
stockpiled at reactors and to satisfy the need for initial cores at new reactor sites.  Substantial 
new electrical capacity development is going ahead at various nuclear sites and continuing 
upwards pressure on prices seems certain.  The US-Russian HEU Agreement, officially 
named the "Megatons to Megawatts Program", terminates at the end of 2013.  Under this 
agreement, 500 tonnes of highly enriched (weapons grade) uranium ("HEU") from 
approximately 20,000 Russian nuclear warheads is being down-blended to produce 
commercial-grade, low-enriched uranium ("LEU") for use in nuclear power plants.  The 
LEU is shipped to the US where it is used as nuclear power plant fuel to generate electricity.  
Initiated in 1993, the 20-year program first shipped LEU to the US in June 1995.  At this 
time the warhead-derived LEU from Russia provides over 10% of the electricity 
requirements of the US.  No plans have been enunciated by either party to extend the 
agreement. 
 
Despite anti-nuclear political rhetoric present in Europe, and until its recent reversal, Japan, 
many new nuclear energy projects are proceeding more or less on schedule.  Both China and 
India, neither self-sufficient in fossil fuels, are building new reactors as quickly as possible 



  
 

 - 9 - 

due to rapidly escalating  energy requirements – India's will triple within 25 years.  At the 
same time, uranium mining projects are being slowed due to perceived social, political and 
capital risks.  The permitting process for new uranium mining projects in greenfield areas is 
notorious for its delays, so sharp increases in production are unlikely.  If the dynamics of the 
last uranium boom can be used as a model, lagging production will cause uranium prices to 
stabilize at a much higher price than has been seen recently.  Evidence from various sources 
was reported by the World Nuclear Association to show that $40 was a marginal production 
price in 2010, illustrating that many producers were under stress at that time.  RBC Capital 
Markets currently forecasts Term Market U3O8 prices rising to $75/lb in 2016, and an $80 
price persisting beyond that to at least 2020.  CIBC Metals & Minerals have forecast Term 
Market prices for U3O8 during 2014 and in the longer term of $65 and $70, respectively. 
 
The search for REE deposits was energized by increasing demand for these metals in a wide 
range of 'high-tech' applications.  China's decision to restrict REE exports to meet its own 
domestic needs initially caused price spikes for most REE products in the 3rd and 4th quarters 
of 2011, but at the end of 2011 and during 2012, prices fell in reflection of declining 
domestic consumption in the United States.  Consumption generally decreased for cerium 
compounds used in automotive catalytic converters and in glass additives and glass-polishing 
compounds; REE chlorides used in the production of fluid-cracking catalysts for oil refining; 
REE compounds used in automotive catalytic converters and many other applications.  Rare 
metals and their alloys used in armaments and base-metal alloys also saw price declines. 
Consumption was stable in lighter flints, permanent magnets, pyrophoric alloys and 
superalloys, but decreased for yttrium compounds.  Demand remained stable for REEs in 
many other applications, especially in rechargeable batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles. 
 
Molycorp's REE separation plant at Mountain Pass, California resumed operation in 2007 
and operated throughout 2011 producing bastnäsite concentrates and other REE 
intermediates and refined products from mine stockpiles.  Molycorp commenced its Project 
Phoenix in 2011, a plan to reopen mining operations and build new processing facilities.  
Mining operations were restarted during 2012.  Molycorp also acquired Canadian REE 
technology company, Neo Material Technologies, a leading REE fabricator with global 
operations including facilities in China.  The Mountain Pass processing plant commenced 
activity in the 1st quarter of 2013.   US consumption decreased 25% in 2012 over 2011, partly 
due to substitution.  MolyCorp reported that it sold 3,274 tonnes of REE product in the 1st 
Qtr, 2013 from its various global operations at an average sales price of US $44.71 per kg.  
The Mountain Pass REE product, of which approximately 47% is Ce, 32% is La, 21% is Nd 
and Pr and less than 5% is other REOs, was sold at US $23/kg.  Although revenues were up 
9% over 2012 levels, Molycorp posted a net loss of $0.33 per share due to soft REE prices.  



  
 

 - 10 - 

Molycorp planned to ramp up to the facility's planned annual run rate of 19,050 tonnes of 
REO equivalent by mid-2013.  It is forecast to develop profitability in 2015. 
 
The considerable excitement that gripped rare earth metal explorers, a relatively recent 
phenomenon, forced governments to suddenly assess the strategic importance of REEs to key 
industrial applications.  The Australian Government's review of national mineral activities 
for 2009 does not mention a single rare earth project even though several major discoveries 
were moving towards production.  The Mount Weld Mine, owned by Lynas Corp., is now in 
production and the company's REO refinery in Malaysia is ramping up to an 11,000 tpa rate 
of REO production, to be doubled when its phase 2 program is commissioned later in 2013. 
 
Figure 1 summarizes global REE production during the period from 1983 through 2012.  
Most of the growth on the production side of the industry, to the 133,000 tonnes produced in 
2011 (110,000 t at this time), has resulted from increased output from China.  However, both 
the USA and Australia returned to REE production during 2012, and hence any forecasts of 
future REE prices must incorporate the impact of alternative supplies in the marketplace. 

 
Figure 1: Graph showing global REE mine production.  The return to production of mines in Australia and the USA is 

notable and must be taken into account in any forecast regarding future REE prices, especially the light REE 
metals. 

 
 
Global exploration efforts to develop rare earths projects surged in 2011, and investment and 
interest increased dramatically.  Economic assessments continued in the U.S.A. at Bear 
Lodge (Wyoming); Diamond Creek (Idaho); and Elk Creek (Nebraska); as well as in Canada 
at Hoidas Lake (Saskatchewan), Kipawa (Quebec) and Nechalacho (Thor Lake) in the 
Nunavut Territory.  None of these deposits are thought to be near a production decision.  



  
 

 - 11 - 

Economic assessments in other locations around the world include Dubbo Zirconia in New 
South Wales, Australia; Kangankunde in Malawi; Nolan's Bore Project in the Northern 
Territory, Australia, and at Steenkampskraal in South Africa.  Nolan's Bore is similar to 
Mount Weld in respect to REE content. 
 
The mines of Elliot Lake are the only deposits in Canada which have seen rare metal 
production.  During the 1970s and 1980s, yttrium was a major by-product of uranium mining 
at both the Denison and the Rio Algom operations.  The Canadian Minerals yearbook 
documents production. Although significant concentrations of rare earth metals were 
recognized, exceeding even that of yttrium, global prices for such metals at the time did not 
favour a commercial operation.  This report represents an up-date of the previous WGM 
work to take into account the considerable unrealized value of rare earth metal mineralization 
present in the Elliot Lake deposits.  Although no previous resource estimates for these metals 
in the Elliot Lake deposits have ever been made, new interest in REEs has put the spotlight 
on the area as a potential producer.  In November 2009, Montoro Resources Inc. confirmed 
that it had intersected significant concentrations of rare earth oxides on its Serpent River 
property located 13 km east of Elliot Lake. 
 
WGM believes the Appia project offers the following positive factors: 

1) the project is located in a brownfields area that has been impacted by a long 
history of uranium and REE mining and production; 

2) the previous mining has demonstrated that uranium tailings can be stabilized and 
managed such that the impacts are successfully mitigated without serious adverse 
consequences for the local environment;; 

3) Appia's Teasdale Deposit is close to existing electrical and water supplies as 
well as uranium infrastructure (the Cameco uranium refinery situated west of 
Elliot Lake near the town of Blind River); 

4) the mineralization is stratabound with excellent lateral grade and thickness 
continuity; 

5) mine rock conditions were favourable for underground development and their 
engineering properties are well understood; 

6) the average thickness of the deposit (9.7 m) is approximately 3 times greater than 
the average thickness mined in the past which should allow Appia commensurate 
reductions in mining costs; 

7) the uranium and REE mineralization are interrelated and can be mined without 
changes to the mining plan; 

8) the associated REE production is another potential revenue generator that could 
exceed the value of uranium production; 



  
 

 - 12 - 

9) the metallurgy of Elliot Lake uranium and REE mineralization is well known in 
respect to milling characteristics as well as its leaching characteristics, including 
the application of bacteria leach technology to uranium; 

10) historical evidence proves that REE recovery can utilize much of the same 
processing technology as that used for uranium production; 

11) Appia bears no responsibility for potential environmental legacy issues in the 
future arising out of previous mining activities; 

12) other companies delineating new uranium and REE resources in the area, such as 
Pele Mountain Resources, as well as companies such as Denison Mines and Rio 
Algom which continue to hold significant Mineral Resources, may present 
opportunities for joint mill ownership or toll milling; 

13) proximity to the Panel Mine which offers the potential for shaft revitalization and 
underground openings for mine infrastructure as well as in-stope leaching and 
waste disposal; 

14) the project is located in Ontario, Canada, in an area that has a long mining 
tradition and in an investor-friendly jurisdiction that supports flow-through 
financing; 

15) a hard-working and knowledgeable local labour force lives in northern Ontario; 
16) excellent year-round project access and close to infrastructure and supply 

centres; 
17) the property is large, extending over an area adjacent to and down-dip of former 

mine workings; and, 
18) the potential to develop a large scale thorium resource from Elliot Lake tailings 

is a potential future consideration since India and some other countries are now 
working on the engineering challenges of using thorium fuel. 

 
Based on Appia's results to date, additional exploration is clearly warranted.   
 
In Workman and Breede (2011), WGM previously identified a staged exploration program 
budgeted at $14.6 million that, over time, would minimize technical risk by building slowly 
from the established facts concerning the historical work.  For planning purposes, three 
phases of drilling were proposed on each of the Teasdale and Banana Lake zones for 
budgetary and cash flow reasons.  The drilling was divided between 15,405 m on the 
Teasdale Lake Zone and 17,600 m on the Banana Lake Zone.  During 2012, Appia 
completed approximately half of the drilling proposed at a significantly lower cost that 
estimated.  The savings are largely attributed to Appia avoiding the cost of a helicopter for 
moving the drilling rig between sites.  During 2012-13, Appia also completed a detailed 
metallurgical testing program that provided positive outcomes for the use of beneficiation to 
process Elliot Lake ores, thereby reducing capital costs, as well as positive outcomes 
concerning the recovery of uranium and REEs. 
 



  
 

 - 13 - 

As a first priority exploration task, WGM recommends that Appia continue its drilling to 
enlarge the Teasdale Zone in all directions.  In completing this review, WGM assessed the 
results of the drilling to date and herein proposes that Appia complete an additional 14 drill 
holes totalling 7,750 m at a total estimated cost of $2,192,000.  These costs are detailed in 
Table 35 in the Budget section of this report. 
 
Although the amount of mineralization present in the Banana Lake Zone is substantial, its 
continuing exploration must be rated as a second priority exploration target at this time 
because WGM believes that the greatest benefit to Appia is in completing the Teasdale 
drilling and its economic assessment as a matter of the highest priority.  Continued 
exploration drilling on the Banana Lake Zone must be contingent on funding, however 
exploration costs have declined as a result of the general conditions which have negatively 
impacted many gold and base metals projects in the Province of Ontario.  Therefore WGM 
believes that some of the cost savings realized during the 2012 drilling program may be 
realized in the Banana Lake area despite the fact that the drilling is much deeper.  These cost 
reductions have been applied to the recommended drilling for this zone.  Whereas the 
previously budgeted drilling was estimated to cost $7.6 million for three phases totalling 
17,600 m, this drilling might now be completed for as little as $4.96 million (Table 35). 
 
WGM also recommends that Appia continue its metallurgical testing program to optimise the 
beneficiation and leaching flowsheet and to provide key information for a NI 43-101 
compliant Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") in the near future.  Based on the 
results of Pele's PEA on its Eco Ridge deposit, WGM believes that the Teasdale PEA will 
provide ample justification for continuing investment in the Elliot Lake uranium and rare 
metal-bearing zones. 
 
WGM has also recommended that Appia pursue a program of community engagement and 
information sessions to ensure that local residents and their representatives are aware of the 
company's activities and the long term benefits to the community if uranium mining resumes 
at Elliot Lake.

2.  INTRODUCTION 
 
2.1 GENERAL 
 
In a letter dated 1 February, 2007 Canada Enerco Corporation ("CEC"), of Toronto, Ontario, 
Canada retained Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited ("WGM") to undertake an evaluation of 
a group of uranium properties located in Buckles, Bouck, Beange, Gunterman and Joubin 
Townships, near the town of Elliot Lake in north-central Ontario (Figure 2).  The 
aforementioned townships enclose portions of the famous Elliot Lake Mining Camp which 
produced uranium during the period 1955 through 1996.  Senior WGM Geologist and Vice-
President, Al Workman, P.Geo. and Qualified Person ("QP") for the project, visited key 
Ontario ministry offices in Sault Ste. Marie and visited the Elliot Lake area on 15-16 May, 
2007 and during 3-4 June, 2009.  In a subsequent agreement dated 1 November, 2007, Appia 
Energy Corp. ("Appia") optioned the Property from CEC, and then requested that WGM up-
date its previous report to encompass the results of recent diamond drilling carried out by 
Appia on the Property. 
 
Between 18 November, 2007 and 12 March, 2008 Appia completed a Stage 1 exploration 
program comprising a total of 10 diamond drill holes using 2 drilling rigs (6 new holes and 4 
wedged holes totalling 3,885.2 m).  Exploration expenditures totalled approximately 
C$ 2,000,000.  The drilling confirmed previously reported intersections and provided the 
basis for WGM to complete a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate on the Banana Lake 
and Teasdale Lake zones.  At this time, Appia was a private company and consequently the 
results were not reported publicly.  During its revisit of the project site during June, 2009 
WGM had discussions with Appia's QP, Mr. Alan MacEachern, formerly Chief Mine 
Geologist for Denison Mines Ltd. resulting in valuable insights into the local geology that are 
not available in published literature.  During this site visit WGM confirmed that the reported 
exploration work had been completed, and re-examined key intervals of mineralized drill 
core. 
 
From October to December 2008, Appia carried out a second program of diamond drilling on 
the Banana Lake Zone.  This exploration entailed new step-out drilling within the resource 
area of the zone previously identified by Rio Algom based on widely separated Kerr McGee 
drill holes.  Using the new data, WGM up-dated the previous NI 43-101 compliant resource 
estimate, the results of which showed a substantial increase in tonnage over WGM's initial 
estimate, as well as a 20% increase in grade over historical estimates. 
 
The current WGM-Appia agreement is dated 1 October, 2009 and under this agreement 
WGM has provided on-going advisory services and up-dates to its earlier reports.  These

assignments for Appia have included geological modelling of the Banana Lake and Teasdale 
Zones drilled by Appia, and Mineral Resource estimates for each.  All reports and estimates 
have been completed in compliance with Canadian securities rule National Instrument 43-
101 ("NI 43-101"). 
 
WGM's report dated 18 July, 2011 included a report of Mineral Resources for the Appia 
Project.  It was filed during November, 2012 and it provides details of historical uranium 
production in the Elliot Lake mining camp, historical resource estimates on Appia's claims, 
WGM's observations concerning the geology and Appia's exploration, as well as WGM's 
data confirmation procedures and evaluation of the project together with recommendations 
for additional exploration. 
 
On-going discussions between WGM and Mr. MacEachern have been extremely valuable in 
determining the parameters used in modelling the rare earth mineralization.  The initial 
drilling in 2006-07, as well as the current drilling program, have confirmed the earlier 
intersections and contributed to substantially increasing the size of the area drill-tested in the 
Teasdale Zone.  It has also increased the level of knowledge in the continuity of the geology 
and the geological model to allow WGM to confidently recommend additional exploration 
drilling to further enlarge the area of Mineral Resources.  Further metallurgical testing is 
warranted to refine the processing flowsheet. 
 
WGM's most recent review of Appia's Elliot Lake Project, dated 18 July, 2011, included a 
detailed history of mining in the Elliot Lake area.  In the Elliot Lake camp, a total of 156,750 
tons of uranium metal (313.5 million pounds) was produced from 13 underground mines 
from approximately 177 million tons of ore having an average grade of approximately 
0.106% U3O8 (898 ppm U), equivalent to 2.12 lbs U3O8 per short ton.  This production 
equals approximately 362 million pounds of U3O8.1  The primary mining method used was 
room and pillar mining with significant resource losses in pillar support (50-70% ore 
extraction).  The ore was hoisted and transported to a number of central mills for crushing, 
grinding and leaching using sulphuric acid to dissolve the uranium.  Uranium was then 
stripped from the solution using sulphuric acid (solvent) extraction and ion exchange 
processes to produce a uranium-oxide precipitate (yellowcake) which was then dried and 
shipped for further refining.  Yttrium, rare earth metals, thorium and some other metals (Fe, 
Al…) were also present in the pregnant solution from which yttrium was recovered 

                                                 
1  1 million lbs of U3O8 are equivalent to approximately 385 metric tonnes of uranium metal.

separately.  The remaining REEs were not recovered at that time because the market had 
little demand for these metals. 
 
In addition to the primary mining production, a number of alternative techniques were 
pioneered both at Elliot Lake as well as at Kerr Addison's Agnew Lake Mine, 70 km to the 
east, to enhance uranium recovery.  Principal amongst the secondary techniques was the use 
of bio-leaching and ion exchange columns to recover small amounts of uranium from mine 
waters being pumped to surface.  Denison Mines Limited established an underground 
bacterial leaching program in the mid-1960s, and initiated a research program in 1980 to 
expand bio-leach production.  In addition, underground leaching was carried out on broken 
ore packed into the open stopes following the primary mining of ore.  The stopes were sealed 
and then flooded for leaching. Oxygen was introduced into the stope to accelerate the 
leaching.  Spray leaching was also used to extract the uranium from underground pillars and 
a portion of the broken ore, and to some degree the wet-dry-wet cycling of the spraying 
program resulted in higher recoveries.  At the Agnew Lake Mine, the steeply dipping 
geometry of the ore zones allowed Kerr Addison to 'long-hole' stopes which were similarly 
sealed and flooded with leachate.  This proved to recover only half of the estimated uranium 
present in the ore.  Kerr Addison also attempted heap-leaching of ore on surface, but this 
again failed to produce anticipated recoveries. 
 
During the 20-year period ending in the 1980s, the accumulation of significant uranium 
stockpiles far exceeding market demands led to a prolonged slump in uranium prices 
beginning in 1981.  Relative to the open-pitable high-grade ores in the Athabasca Basin of 
Saskatchewan, the lower grading ores of Elliot Lake fell out of favour and one by one the 
mines closed.  Most of the mines contained significant, readily leachable uranium resources 
at the time that uranium prices declined, but the deep underground workings resulted in 
operating costs that made the resources uneconomic.  That factor combined with lower 
demand for new uranium production resulted in the closing of the Elliot Lake camp, and the 
decommissioning of the mines. 
 
Due to the significant hiatus between the closure of the mines and the present, no drill core 
was available for check sampling.  As part of its on-going work for Appia, WGM reviewed 
core logs and various technical reports that were prepared by previous mine operators.  
WGM believes that the information in these files is an accurate representation of the state of 
knowledge at the time the mines closed.  Furthermore, in every instance, Appia's drilling 
programs have confirmed the previous uranium intersections which lends considerable 
veracity to the historical resource estimates.

In previous reports, WGM has included the use of several historical resource estimates.  The 
estimates are based on widely spaced drilled holes completed by several of the major 
companies operating in the Elliot Lake area during the 1970s and 1980s.  The resources are 
deep, and are located down-dip of previous mine workings.  The use of widely spaced holes 
was common practice in the Blind River district due to the uniformity of the stratabound 
mineralization.  The historical resources, which were estimated by companies well 
acquainted with both the area and with uranium mining, are inferred, and WGM included 
them in its discussion because it believes that the resources are material to the exploration 
potential and future economic value of the Appia mineral claims.  Given these facts however, 
WGM cautions that the historical resource estimates do not meet current standards as defined 
by the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy ("CIM") and implemented under 
Canadian Securities Regulators' Rule National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"). 
 
This report encompasses the results of the most recent drilling on the Teasdale Zone and up-
dated estimates of the Mineral Resources in that zone.  The report also incorporates the 
results of a recently completed metallurgical testing program that has identified beneficiation 
as a key step in the processing of Teasdale mineralization.  Hydrometallurgical testing has 
also shed light on the extraction of uranium and REEs from the mineralization.  The 
continuing exploration work recommended in this report includes additional exploration 
drilling on the Teasdale Zone to add additional resources and to up-grade the confidence 
level of the existing Inferred Resources in some areas.  Continued metallurgical testing is 
also recommended to improve the beneficiation approach, to fine-tune the extraction 
flowsheet and to refine the costs related to the recovery of uranium and REEs from Teasdale 
ore.  Community out-reach is also recommended to ensure that Elliot Lake residents and their 
representatives are well informed concerning Appia's plans and the benefits of renewed 
mining in the area.  As a second priority item, contingent on available funds, WGM has also 
recommended additional drilling on the much deeper and significantly larger mineralization 
in the Banana Lake Zone. 
 
On completion of the next phase of exploration on the Teasdale Zone, Appia should 
complete a Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") which includes a preliminary mine 
plan to exploit the Mineral Resources and a cash flow model incorporating the Mineral 
Resource estimates, capital cost and operating cost estimates, metallurgical recovery data, 
metal market data and the mining plan.  The PEA would include an up-date of the Mineral 
Resources based on the exploration drilling recommended herein which should result in a 
significant increase in resources based on the current well-established geological model in 
which WGM has a high degree of confidence.  The PEA will conceptually examine the 



  
 

 - 19 - 

conditions that might allow the resources in the Teasdale Zone to be brought into production.  
In this respect, the assessment is a material fact that is relevant to Appia's longer term plans. 
 
 
2.2 TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
During early 2007, Canada Enerco Corporation ("CEC"), of Toronto, Ontario, Canada 
retained Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited ("WGM") to undertake a review of a group of 
its uranium properties (the "Property") located in Buckles, Bouck, Beange, Gunterman and 
Joubin Townships, north-central Ontario.  CEC is an Ontario-registered private corporation 
based in Toronto, Canada.   Also based in Toronto, WGM is a consulting firm of geologists 
and engineers which has been providing high quality technical services to the mineral 
industry since 1962. 
 
As a result of a vending agreement dated 1 November, 2007 between CEC and a related 
company, Appia Energy Corp. ("Appia") of Toronto whereby Appia acquired the 
exploration and mining rights to the Property, WGM was retained by Appia to prepare an up-
date of its previous work including initial Mineral Resources estimates for the Banana Lake 
and Teasdale Lake zones carried out during the fourth quarter of 2008 and early 2009.  
WGM has been retained since that time as Appia's independent QP for the project.  WGM 
has undertaken several resource estimates when Appia was a private company, and was 
asked by Appia to provide this report incorporating new and up-dated technical data.  
 
The Property comprises a group of staked mining claims which cover the extensions of 
uranium ore zones from past-producing mines located on the north and south limbs of the 
Quirke Lake Syncline.  As room and pillar mining was the favoured mining method, the 
mines contain substantial uranium resources left in pillars and undeveloped mineralized 
zones.  The extensions of these zones are inferred to contain a considerable uranium resource 
based on previous drilling.  
 
This report includes the previous findings, the results of the most recent drilling program, 
WGM's latest resource estimates and new data acquired as a result of a recently completed 
program of metallurgical testing carried by SGS-XRAL Laboratories at its testing facility in 
Lakefield, Ontario. 
 
WGM included detailed discussions of the uranium and REE markets in its previous NI 43-
101 compliant technical report filed on SEDAR.   These discussions, which are summarized 



  
 

 - 20 - 

herein, included the conclusions expressed by the World Nuclear Association in its biennial 
meeting in London, UK, held on 9-11 September 2009 concerning uranium pricing.  Despite 
the recent Fukushima nuclear accident, an incident borne not out of a technological failure 
but out of a natural disaster, most countries have not abandoned plans to expand their 
nuclear-electric generating capacities.  Whereas the uranium market is forecast to grow 
markedly over the next several decades based on supply-demand fundamentals, REE markets 
are currently influenced by a high degree of political control exercised by the Government of 
China, and are therefore less easily predicted. 
 
WGM understands that it is Appia's intent to use WGM's report as a supporting document to 
support a future Initial Public Offering "IPO". 
 
 
2.3 SOURCES OF INFORMATION 
 
The historical exploration information reviewed during this assignment, and incorporated 
into this NI 43-101 compliant report, was largely collected from the public records of the 
Ministry of Northern Development and Mines ("MNDM") offices located in Sault Ste. 
Marie, Ontario.  WGM also relied upon its own library and research resources as well as the 
expertise of its personnel.  WGM spot tested the information given for reliability against 
MNDM files.  Other information was gleaned from authoritative internet sources such as the 
World Nuclear Association, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, the Canadian Nuclear 
Association, the International Atomic Energy Association, and the World Information 
Service on Energy ("WISE") Uranium Project. 
 
The site visits by WGM Senior Geologist Al Workman on 15-16 May, 2007 and during 3-4 
June, 2009 were used as opportunities to collect additional public information from the 
records of the MNDM regional office in Sault Ste. Marie, to discuss exploration policy with 
ministry representatives and to meet with Ministry of the Environment officials.  A recent 
site visit on 15 July, 2013 was made to examine drill core and to confirm selected drill site 
locations. 
 
WGM has reviewed various licence documents (abstracts), but did not carry out a detailed 
audit of the certificates in order to verify title to any of the properties described herein.  
Efforts were made through discussions with MNDM personnel to understand the nature of 
any potential challenges which might arise in respect to resuming uranium production in the 
Elliot Lake area.  Similar discussions were held with Ministry of the Environment (MOE) 
representatives.  Importantly, WGM ascertained that the Ontario Government would fully 



  
 

 - 21 - 

uphold the rights of any mineral claim owner to undertake such development in compliance 
with existing laws and regulations. 
 
Given the long period of time that has elapsed since the Elliot Lake area was actively being 
explored and mined, substantial sections of drill core from the key holes put down by Kerr 
McGee and other companies were not available for examination.  Although a few 
representative sections of mineralized drill core have been maintained in the MNDM core 
library in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, such material is of limited quantity and great historical 
significance, and is therefore not available for resampling.  No surface exposures were 
sampled as the results of such samples would have been irrelevant given the scope of the 
undertaking under consideration by Appia.  Check samples of Appia drill core were selected 
for independent analysis by WGM and sent to the SGS laboratory on Don Mills (Toronto) for 
check assaying.  The results were previously reported in detail in Workman and Breede 
(2011) which found that the Appia assays were representative of the uranium contained in the 
samples within a reasonable range of error.  Routine check analysis by Appia has up-held the 
validity of its assay database. 
 
This report is the responsibility of WGM which alone has been in charge of its overall 
presentation. 
 
 
2.4 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
The metallurgical testing program carried out by Appia and summarized herein was 
performed under a contract between Appia and SGS Mineral Services based in Lakefield 
Ontario.  The work was supervised by Mr. James Brown, MASc, P.Eng., Senior Metallurgist-
Hydrometallurgy and carried out under the direction of Senior WGM Associate Metallurgist, 
Mr. John Goode, P.Eng. 
 
For metallurgical test data, WGM has relied on the technical report prepared by SGS Mineral 
Services entitled "An Investigation Into the Recovery of Uranium and Rare Earth Elements 
from the Teasdale Property  prepared for Appia Energy Corporation, Project 13849-001, Final 
Report" dated 19 July, 2013 and a second SGS report entitled 'An Investigation Into 
Beneficiation Testwork to assess the Recoverability of Uranium and Rare Earth Elements 
from the Teasdale Property  prepared for Appia Energy Corporation, Project 13849-002, Final 
Report" dated 5 June, 2013.  Both reports are appended hereto in the Attachments sections of 
this report.  In the preparation of this WGM report, the authors have also relied on a technical 



  
 

 - 22 - 

report concerning the mineralogy of the Teasdale Zone prepared by SGS Mineral Services 
entitled "An Investigation by High Definition Mineralogy into the Mineralogical 
Characteristics of Three Composite Samples from the Elliot Lake Project" dated 10 May, 
2013 and authored by Mr. Bernie C. Yeung, Mineralogist and Dr. Huyun Zhou, Senior 
Mineralogist. 
 
During its previous site visits, WGM met with various QPs who have provided in-put to the 
Appia project including Mr. Robert MacGregor, P.Eng., a mining engineer resident in the 
city, and a former employee at the Denison Mine and Mr. Alan MacEachern, a consulting 
geologist and Elliot lake resident who has 40 years of experience in the mining camp, 
originally managing drilling programs and logging drill core during his tenure with Denison 
Mines Ltd.  Both have contributed intimate details of their knowledge of the uranium-bearing 
horizons ("reefs") mined at Elliot Lake.  Significant insight and additional information 
concerning underground uranium leaching and bioleaching was also supplied by Mr. Richard 
Swider, P.Eng., a former metallurgical engineer at the Denison Mine.  Mr. Swider acted in 
his role as a WGM Associate whereas Mr. MacGregor and Mr. MacEachern are QPs who are 
independent of WGM. 
 
WGM relied on the MNDM offices to provide accurate land title information and did not 
ascertain or confirm the legal status of the Appia mining claims beyond downloading from 
the MNDM a list of current claim owners in the project area.  This data indicates that the 
claims are in good standing insofar as the office of the Mining recorder is concerned. 
 
One key goal of the earlier WGM site visit was to locate the position of some of the Kerr 
McGee drill holes.  Although the locations provided to WGM by the MNDM from the 
ministry database proved to be inaccurate, WGM was able to reliably re-locate holes using 
the sketch maps contained within individual drill hole records filed for assessment.  To this 
extent, WGM's reliance on the Ministry records was conditional, and done solely as a means 
of establishing the search area within which the hole was likely to be found 2. 
 
 

                                                 
2   Subsequent to WGM's efforts, Appia reported that it was able to locate all of the historical holes that it 

searched for.

2.5 UNITS AND CURRENCY 
 
All monetary sums relating to uranium prices are reported in United States dollars (US$) 
unless stated otherwise.  A conversion rate of 0.90 Canadian dollars (C$) to the United States 
dollar (US $) was used in respect to developing and qualifying Mineral Resource estimates 
and cost models. 
  
Measurements in this report are stated in the SI (metric) system.  In keeping with norms in 
the industry, uranium grades are reported as pounds triuranium octoxide (commonly referred 
to as "yellowcake" or U3O8) per short ton.  Less commonly, uranium content is reported as 
per cent uranium oxide (%U3O8).3   Assay data may be reported as parts per million (ppm). 
 
Uranium supply pricing is predominantly established during direct contract negotiations 
between producers and energy utilities, and the quantities involved are typically several 
million pounds or more of U3O8.  This is commonly referred to as the "Term Market".  
Smaller quantities of uranium, measured in hundreds of thousands of pounds of U3O8, may 
be offered for sale on one of several "Spot Markets".  The prices on the Spot Market bid by 
utilities seeking to increase on-site fuel supplies is generally discounted with respect to the 
prices established under Term contracts, however in times of uncertainty regarding future 
pricing, the Spot price can exceed the Term price resulting in an inverted market.  Prices on 
both markets are quoted in US $ per pound of U3O8. 
 
The classification of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in Canada follows the 
codification established by the CIM.  The CIM system, which must be followed in order to 
assure NI 43-101 compliance, ranks Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in terms of 
confidence level which in turn is a reflection of the types and amounts of exploration work 
completed.  The conversion of resources to reserves is based on a study of mineral economics 
that establishes the economic viability of the existing resources under a specific set of 
conditions.  The Mineral Resources estimated by WGM based on recent Appia drilling 
programs are in compliance with NI 43-101. 
 
The historical resources mentioned herein this report cannot be precisely confirmed by the 
authors and are not suitable for investment decisions.

2.6 RISK FACTORS 
 
As is generally the case in the world at large, natural resources including mineral 
commodities are the property of the sovereign State, and the right to develop and exploit 
mineral deposits is conveyed to private interests via permitting and licensing procedures and 
agreements.  Mineral projects must therefore meet certain statutory requirements to be 
permitted to go into production. 
 
Due to a combination of legitimate concerns and irrational fears, uranium projects receive 
special attention which can prolong the permitting process and certain additional conditions 
associated with a "social licence" to operate can be imposed.  This is especially true for 
mining projects that are located close to settlements as is the case with some of the Appia 
mining claims, although the main Mineral Resource areas are located at some distance from 
the town of Elliot Lake.  WGM understands from its conversations with Mr. Bob McGregor, 
P.Eng. (Mining), that Elliot Lake municipal leaders are generally in favour of renewed 
exploration and mining activity as a means of increasing tax revenue to the city.  Mr. 
McGregor had previously met with two town officials in his capacity as an independent 
consultant.  This sentiment has been confirmed recently in discussions with the 
aforementioned Mr. MacEachern, P.Geo., a long-standing resident of Elliot Lake.  WGM's 
meeting with Ministry of the Environment officials in Sault Ste Marie also found assurance 
that Appia's project would not face any unusual permitting hurdles. 
 
There are no land use restrictions of which WGM is aware which might restrict the ability of 
Appia to access the project areas, or which might restrict its ability to bring its uranium 
property into production.  The economic viability of the estimated Mineral Resources is 
dependent on a higher priced uranium-REE market than exists as of the date of this report.  
Metal market researchers at RBC Capital Markets, CIBC and at many other financial and 
research institutions are forecasting a shortage of U3O8 and substantially higher prices in 
2014 and beyond that will prevail at or during the timeframe that the Appia requires for 
completion of its exploration and project permitting for mine development. 
 
WGM's own analysis favours higher uranium prices based on data from such organizations 
as the World Nuclear Organization, the World Information Service on Energy (WISE) 
Uranium Project, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the US Energy Information 
Agency.  WGM is aware that future reactor builds can be affected, and likely will be affected 
by alternative energy sources, especially low-cost natural gas, however the predicted uranium 
shortages are based on the number of reactors currently in service and under construction.  



  
 

 - 25 - 

The predictions are not based on the US or Europe resuming or embracing a robust nuclear 
reactor construction program.  Uranium pricing is a reflection of supply-demand 
fundamentals, and demand is easily forecast on reactor operations and construction (actual 
and planned).  While nuclear fuel consumption is easily forecast, shocks to demand have 
occurred as a collateral result of major accidents, and these have affected uranium prices in 
the short term.  Political posturing in the wake of such accidents has certainly played a role in 
exacerbating a decline in uranium prices.  However, these shocks have proven to be transient 
largely because of growing global energy demand.  The long-term linkage between oil and 
uranium prices, which is in an imbalance as of mid-2013 due a natural event in 2011 (Japan's 
tsunami) and not by a reactor malfunction at Fukushima, indicates that uranium prices should 
rise but this is not a certainty. 
 
Balancing the forgoing caution are several factors which are favourable for the Appia 
project: 

• new mine infrastructure development would be in brownfields areas already 
disturbed by industrial and mining activity; 

• water, electrical, transportation and communications infrastructure is in place or 
close at hand; 

• the processing of Elliot Lake ore is well known and faces no significant technical 
uncertainties; 

• no First Nations land claims affect the project area; 

• Appia bears no responsibility (liability) in any manner for potential future 
impacts arising out of historical mining operations and waste disposal;  and, 

• the Cameco uranium refinery is located approximately 50 km away near Blind 
River. 

 
 
As far as WGM knows, all of the Appia mining claims that are the subject of this report are 
presently held by Appia without legal encumbrances to other parties or by the Government 
which would relate to previous mining activities.  The reader is also directed to the section in 
this report entitled "Other Relevant Data and Information", specifically the sub-section on 
environmental policy and issues.

3.  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
3.1 GENERAL LOCATION 
 
The Appia uranium-REE property comprises a group of unpatented mineral claim units 
located in Buckles, Bouck, Beange, Gunterman, Joubin and Lehman Townships and near the 
town of Elliot Lake in north-central Ontario (Figure 3).  Elliot Lake is located on Highway 
108 approximately 26 km north of Highway 17, also known as the Trans-Canada Highway. 
 
The project area is situated in UTM zone 17.  The geographic co-ordinates of the town of 
Elliot Lake are 46o23'N latitude and 82o39'W longitude.  The Appia claims have not been 
surveyed.  As is typical for exploration properties, Appia does not own the surface rights to 
the underlying mineral claims.  The surface rights to the claims belong to the Crown and 
some belong to the City of Elliot Lake.  Surface rights can be acquired and there is sufficient 
area to construct the infrastructure necessary for mining and processing operations. 
 
 
3.2 PROPERTY ADMINISTRATION AND STATUS 
 
Mineral claim titles in the Province of Ontario are administered by the Ministry of Northern 
Development and Mines ("MNDM").  The Elliot Lake area is administered by the regional 
office located in the city of Sault Ste. Marie, a major government centre in north-central 
Ontario.  Other government offices in the city include those charged with administering 
regulations pertaining to the environment, inland waterways, transportation and 
communications.  The Appia Property consists of 100 staked mining claim units with original 
anniversary dates ranging from 19 October, 2004 to 11 December, 2009 (Table 4).  
Originally, 58 of the claims were held by Canada Enerco Corporation ("CEC"), a company 
related to Appia, however 100% ownership in these claims was transferred to Appia on 
27 July, 2009.  The terms of this agreement are discussed in Section 3.4 Nature of Appia's 
Interest.  As can be seen from the following table, excess expenditures have been filed 
against the claims ensuring that they remain in good standing.  Appia maintains a large 
positive balance in its reserves sufficient to carry the claims for another five years without 
being compelled to carry out additional exploration.

(2)  Ownership marked by an asterisk (*) were subject to a transfer (option) agreement between Appia Energy and CEC. 
(3)  This claim number was issued by the MNDM twice and the Ministry determined that the Appia claim should receive a "0" prefix to reduce 

confusion rather than issue a replacement claim number.

Mineral claim titles in the Province of Ontario are administered by the Ministry of Northern 
Development and Mines ("MNDM").  The Elliot Lake area is administered by the regional 
office located in the city of Sault Ste. Marie, a major government centre in north-central 
Ontario.  Other government offices in the city include those charged with administering 
regulations pertaining to the environment, inland waterways, transportation and 
communications. 
 
The Appia claims are unpatented, staked claims which are subject to annual exploration 
expenditure requirements.  These requirements, presented in Table 1, are assessed on a per-
claim basis, and must be met in order to maintain the claims in good standing.  The MNDM 
monitors the completion of assessment work through a reporting system that demands the 
claim holder file an annual assessment report by the anniversary date for each claim, or group 
of claims.  Work credits may be spread over blocks of contiguous claims. 
 
The anniversary date for the individual claim comprising the Appia Property (Figure 3) are 
shown in Table 1.  The total work commitment required to maintain the claims in good 
standing is C $324,400.  At this time, Appia has filed excess expenditures and retains 
C$1,337,121 in reserves for meeting future requirements (Table 4).  Appia has additional 
exploration expenditures in the amount of $1,974,263 relating to the 2012 drilling which has 
not yet been filed against its work requirements, and this amount will substantially increase 
the reserves held against future work obligations.  Appia has no relinquishment plans at this 
time, and does not see a need to relinquish any claims in the future. 
 
Certain of the mining claims (#4214928, 4221249 and 4228612), while valid, are currently 
subject to a Decommissioning Licence issued under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and 
relating to previous mining activities.  The licence holder, Denison Mines Inc., is obligated to 
undertake a work program relating to control of environmental impacts and restoration of the 
land.  Appia is required to avoid exploration activities that might interfere with the execution 
of Denison's environmental programs.  It is clear from correspondence received by Energy 
Metals Corp. (see following section) that Denison does not have the authority to grant access 
to these claims for the purpose of exploration drilling.  Appia has no plans to carry out 
exploration on these licences at this time.

3.3 NATURE OF APPIA'S INTEREST 
 
Appia holds its mineral titles as a result of having acquired the claims under the terms of an 
agreement dated 1 November, 2007 with Canada Enerco Corporation ("CEC"), a related 
company, which originally staked the claims in accordance with the Mining Act of Ontario 
R.S.O. 1990.  The claims are now held 100% by Appia. 
 
Under the Vending Agreement with CEC, Appia paid 35 million common shares to CEC in 
exchange for the claims and Appia was granted two options by CEC.  Under the 1st option, 
Appia had the right to buy back 1 million of its shares at C $1 per share at any time prior to 
31 August, 2008.  Appia exercised this option.  The 2nd option is conditional on Appia 
spending at least $10,000,000 on exploration on the Elliot Lake properties prior to 
2 November, 2012, to define a NI 43-101 compliant uranium mineral resource on the 
property.  This option granted Appia the right, prior that date, to buy back 9 million shares in 
tranches of 1 million shares at C $2 per share, subject to a price adjustment.  The adjustment 
governed the maximum purchase price for the block of shares as follows: 
 
 

$0.10 times the NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resources in pounds of U3O8. 
 
 
In the event that the purchase price is less than $20 million, the option price of the 9 million 
shares will be adjusted to equal the maximum purchase price divided by 10 million.  CEC 
retains a 1% uranium production payment royalty on uranium sold at a price equal to or in 
excess of US $130 per lb U3O8, as well as a 1% net smelter royalty on any precious and base 
metal co-production when the price of uranium equals or exceeds US $130 per lb U3O8. 
 
Appia did not meet the minimum expenditure requirement imposed in the forgoing and could 
not exercise its 2nd option. 
 
Under the agreement with CEC, Appia is required to maintain the Property in good standing, 
including any claims returned (surrendered) to CEC.  In turn, CEC is required to supplement 
the Property with any additional claim units that it acquires within 20 km of the Property 
boundaries subject only to Appia's acceptance of such new claim units.  Appia is responsible 
for paying the acquisition (staking) costs of any claim units that it acquires from CEC. 
 
Under an agreement dated 14 February, 2008, Appia purchased a group of claims from Dan 
Patrie Exploration Ltd. which retains a 1% net smelter royalty on the production and sale of 



  
 

 - 31 - 

any uranium from the subject claims at a time when the realized price for the uranium equals 
or exceeds US $130 per lb U3O8.  The claims covered in this purchase agreement are: 

• 3019312 and 3019313; 
• 4215309; and, 
• 4215313 to 4125315 inclusive. 

 
One half of the royalty payable to Dan Patrie Exploration Ltd. may be purchased by Appia 
for C $1 million. 
 
CEC transferred some surface rights to the City of Elliot Lake under an agreement dated 
1 November 2005, and executed 22 November, 2005, to allow the construction of a road.  
The mining claims so affected were 4221245 and 4221246 (formerly 3009176 and 3009177).  
A similar agreement on 12 January, 2009 transferred the surface rights for road construction 
to the City of Elliot Lake on claims 4215303, 4215313 and 4215303. 
 
A block of claims in Buckles Township at the eastern end of the Appia Property were 
previously the subject of an option agreement between CEC and Energy Metals Corporation 
("EMC") which had an option to earn a 50% interest.  That option has been relinquished, and 
all outstanding shares of EMC have been purchased by Uranium One Inc.  In exchange for 
terminating the option agreement, CEC issued C $250,000 worth of stock (250,000  common 
shares) of Appia to EMC (now Uranium One).  In turn, CEC and now Appia, must maintain 
in good standing those claims that were subject to the original agreement until such time as 
Appia completes an initial public offering ("IPO").  In addition, Uranium One retains the 
right to participate in any Appia financing (for up to 9.9%) until and including an Appia IPO 
or reverse take-over.  No Appia claim units are under option to a second party at this time or 
affected by a royalty agreement. 
 
Lastly, an agreement on 22 July, 2009 conveyed Denison the right to construct a new tailings 
infrastructure on claims numbered 4221247 and 4221248 in exchange for a 3% net smelter 
royalty on any uranium production from the subject claims.  Denison also granted Appia the 
right of access onto claims held by Denison in the Elliot Lake area as well as the right to use 
former Denison mine workings to facilitate the exploration and development of Appia's 
Elliot Lake Project.

4.  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
4.1 ACCESS 
 
The Appia Property is located approximately mid-way between the city of Sudbury 126 km 
by road to the east and the city of Sault Ste. Marie 181 km to the west.  It can be reached via 
the Trans-Canada Highway (#17), and then via Highway #108 approximately 26 km north to 
the town of Elliot Lake.  The town can be reached by regular northern Ontario bus service, 
but it is not currently serviced by air.  Regularly scheduled air travel from Toronto is 
available on a daily basis into both Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie. 
 
 
4.2 CLIMATE 
 
The Elliot Lake area has a northern boreal climate, moderated by its proximity to Lake 
Huron, with warm summers and cold dry winters.  The coldest months are January and 
February which average -17o to -18oC.  The summers are hottest during July and August with 
maximum temperatures of 22o to 24oC, however, summer nights tend to be cool with 
minimum temperatures of 11o to 12oC. 
 
Most of the precipitation in Elliot Lake falls during the spring months of April through May 
and during September-October.  Absolute summer and winter temperatures are moderated by 
the areas proximity to Lake Huron, one of the largest of the Great Lakes.  Although on a 
latitude equal to that of Kirkland Lake, the Elliot Lake area does not experience the cold 
weather that the former centre receives. 
 
 
4.3 LOCAL RESOURCES 
 
Elliot Lake with a 2006 population of 11,549 is a small fraction of its former size during the 
uranium boom of the 1970's when its population exceeded 30,000.  It is now a local supply 
centre for recreation areas in the north, offering a wide variety of food sources as well as 
general mechanical supplies and services (equipment repair, welding, auto 
maintenance….etc).  All the major Canadian banks are represented in the city:  Royal Bank 
of Canada, TD-Canada Trust, Bank of Nova Scotia, CIBC and the Bank of Montreal. 
 



  
 

 - 34 - 

The Ontario government maintains two offices in Elliot Lake: the Office of the Worker 
Advisor which operates under the Ministry of Labour, and an office of the Ministry of 
Northern Development and Mines (50 Hillside Dr. North, Elliot Lake ON P5A 1X4 - 
Telephone (705) 848-7133.  The latter office is also a "Service Ontario" office which 
provides a broad range of administrative services for other ministries such as transportation 
and health (renewal of driver's licences and health cards). 
 
A new integrated health centre has been constructed in Elliot Lake that houses the 
community's doctors and other health care professionals.  The city is serviced with 24-hour 
911-response ambulance service provided by the Algoma District Services Administration 
Board.  The board provides one on-site ambulance and crew 24 hours a day and an additional 
crew on weekdays from 8 to 4 pm for transfers to service the other outlying areas. For 
emergency transportation to other centres, a helicopter landing pad is located at the Elliot 
Lake Hospital.  Air Bravo Corporation operates an air ambulance service, servicing all of 
north-eastern Ontario and provides charter services.  Policing services in Elliot Lake are 
provided by the Elliot Lake detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP).  Officers 
patrol the streets and are on duty 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  The Elliot Lake fire service 
provides 24 hour service with a complement 34 firefighters.  They have a fully equipped fire 
hall with an aerial pumper and a complement of rescue vehicles. 
 
Elliot Lake is located near the northern margin of the developed corridor along the Trans-
Canada Highway.  As a result, there are no paved roads extending more than 20 km north of 
the city.  Elliot Lake Municipal Airport has no regularly scheduled flights, and is currently 
being used for occasional auto racing. 
 
Local and long-distance communication facilities are well developed in Elliot Lake, and 
many hotels can provide internet services.   
 
Most types of field supplies and equipment are readily available in Elliot Lake, although the 
selection is not as complete as might be found from major suppliers in the south.  Outdoor 
recreation equipment is generally in good supply in order to support the local recreational 
community.  Other supplies such as office equipment and materials are readily available.

4.4 INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The project is situated in the famous Elliot Lake uranium mining camp.  Located at the end 
of a regional highway, the city of Elliot Lake contains a full complement of local 
Government, health, education and other services.  The town has good drinking water, 
sewage treatment, communications and electrical services which are sufficient to support 
mining operations.  A 4,500 ft (1,385 m) paved runway (46o21'06"N  82o33'40"W) is 
located about 6.4 km ESE of the town although it is not serviced by regular flights at this 
time and its surface condition is unknown.  The runway has an ESE-WNW direction striking 
approximately 112 degrees.  The location of other infrastructure relevant to mining is shown 
in Table 5.

4.5 AGRICULTURE 
 
There is relatively little agriculture in the project area due to the thin soils and the short 
growing period having only 112 frost-free days (versus 160 days for Toronto), both 
representing major obstacles to market-oriented agricultural development.  Some private 
gardens are grown locally to produce vegetables for local consumption. 
 



  
 

 - 36 - 

Silvaculture is a major industry in the area which produces pine and spruce for the 
construction industry, as well as cedar and a few hardwoods such as birch as a specialty 
woods.  Some renewed cutting is expected in the area of the Appia property during 2013. 
 
 
4.6 PHYSIOGRAPHY  
 
Located in the Canadian Shield, the project area is gently rolling with occasional bedrock 
scarps as much as 25 m in height (Plate 1).  Elevations range from approximately 300 to 500 
metres above sea level.  The city of Elliot Lake is situated at 312 m above sea level.  The area 
is dotted with a great number of lakes which is typical of the shield.  The largest of these is 
Quirke Lake.  The lakes drain towards the south into the North Channel, a body of water 
which forms part of Lake Huron. 
 
Soils in the project area are generally thin as a result of protracted periods of glaciation 
during the Pleistocene.  Areas between bedrock ridges are generally filled with glacial till 
with an upper muskeg or peat-covered surface.  Drainage may be poor locally.

5.  HISTORY 
 
5.1 REGIONAL EXPLORATION HISTORY 
 
The history of the Elliot Lake uranium discovery is described in some detail in Workman and 
Breede (2011) which can be found on the SEDAR site at www.sedar.com under company 
profiles for Appia Energy Corp. dated 12 Dec., 2012.  The history is briefly summarized here 
as follows. 
 
A modest staking rush occurred in the area now known as the Blind River District during 
1948.  Several samples from Long Township, 122 km east of Sault Ste. Marie contained low 
but measurable amounts of uranium.  This led geologists into the Elliot Lake area and a high 
proportion of the early samples taken demonstrated economically interesting uranium values 
averaging 0.11% U3O8.  Over a period of a month or so, most of the major claim blocks were 
staked.  During the subsequent period ending in 1954, diamond drilling outlined deposits 
totalling more than 200 million tons grading an estimated 2.5 lbs U3O8 per ton.  On-going 
surface exploration work and diamond drilling that followed in the Elliot Lake area during 
the 1960s and 1970s, and in areas now held by the Appia, was completed as part of the 
deposit evaluation and ore definition process that gave rise to the historical mines.  Little 
work was done during the 1980s as the uranium price was in decline due to reduced reactor 
builds and accumulating stockpiles in the major producing countries. 
 
 
5.2 MINING HISTORY 
 
During the mid-1980s, more than  half of Canada's reasonably assured uranium resources, 
though expensive to develop and mine, were contained in the Quirke Lake Syncline despite 
the addition of high-grade deposits found in the Athabasca Basin of northern Saskatchewan 
(International Atomic Energy Agency, 1987).  The mining history of the Elliot Lake uranium 
camp is described in detail in Workman and Breede (2011) which can be found on the 
SEDAR site at www.sedar.com under company profiles for Appia Energy Corp. dated 12 
Dec., 2012.  This report described the production from each individual mine.  What follows 
is a brief overview taken from that report. 
 
During 1956, the Quirke Mine at Quirke Lake and the Nordin Mine near Elliot Lake 
commenced operations under the new companies Preston East Dome and Algom Uranium 
Mines Limited.  Eldorado, the federal Crown corporation which was the sole buyer of 



  
 

 - 38 - 

Canadian uranium production, gave a $206M uranium supply contract to Algom and a $55M 
contract to Pronto.  However, before the Algom Mine could begin production, the company 
was taken over by the U.K.'s Rio Tinto Limited (Rio Tinto).  By the end of 1957, Rio Tinto 
had also bought control of Nordic Uranium Mines Ltd. and merged its interests in three 
additional mines into Northspan Uranium Mines Limited.  Finally Rio Tinto acquired 
Milliken Lake Uranium Mines from Hirshhorn.  By the end of 1958, Rio Tinto had seven 
mines in operation supplying 40% of Canada's uranium concentrate production:  Algom 
Quirke, Nordic, Pronto, Milliken Lake and three Northspan mines. 
 
At this same time, another small explorer named Stanrock Uranium Mining Ltd. 
commissioned its mill in 1958 and started production.  Realizing the value of high yttrium 
contents in the Elliot Lake ores, Stanrock began producing yttrium as a by product in 1965.  
The production was quite simple as the metal went into solution together with uranium.  
During this same period, Denison sank two shafts on its discovery, one a 5-compartment and 
the other a 7-compartment shaft, and a mill was constructed to process 6,000 tons per day.  
Eventually reorganized as Denison Mines Ltd., the company negotiated a $280,600,000 
contract to supply 28 M lbs of U3O8 to the United States between 1957 and November, 1963.  
When supply contracts to the United Kingdom were added to this, nearly $500M of uranium 
was sold by 1963. 
 
Having observed the Stanrock yttrium operation, Denison decided to capitalize on the 
growing market for yttrium which had previously been identified as a potential by-product in 
Elliot Lake ores.  In 1966 a yttrium circuit was added to Denison's mill and production 
started later that year with 10,307 kg (22,724 lbs) of Y2O3 produced.  The following year, the 
Elliot Lake camp reached a zenith in its output with 78,268 kg (172,551 lbs) of Y2O3 
produced (Canadian Minerals Yearbook).   The camp's output gradually diminished as the 
US market turned more and more to lower cost production from its own mines, including the 
Mountain Pass Mine in California, a major producer of cerium and lanthanum.  By 1970, the 
output was only 33,112 kg (73,000 lbs).  No production was recorded in 1971 or '72.  
Stanrock merged with Denison Mines Ltd. in 1973, a year that saw only 181 kg (400 lbs) of 
Y2O3 produced, but the yttrium market revived the following year which saw a collective 
output of 39,366 kg (86,787 lbs) of Y2O3 from the Elliot Lake mines.  During the period 
1975 through 1977, output from the Denison mine alone averaged 30,545 kg (67,340 lbs) of 
yttrium oxide, however by 1978 yttrium production became uneconomic due to increased 
reagent costs. 
 



  
 

 - 39 - 

The oil shocks that occurred during the mid-1970s combined with rapidly growing energy 
demands led to significant increases in uranium demand during the 1970s and the 
international price for uranium oxide rose above all previous highs, reaching $43.40 per 
pound during the summer of 1978.  This up-swing in commodity prices enabled many of the 
Elliot Lake uranium mines to resume production, including the Agnew Lake Mine to the east, 
and fuelled a second uranium exploration boom in the Elliot Lake area. 
 
At one time, 13 uranium mines operated at Elliot Lake, most of which were owned by Rio 
Algom Limited as follows in Table 6.  However the largest mine was the Denison Mine, and 
its production served as the foundation of the company that bore its name.

Collectively, the foregoing Denison mines produced some 156 Mlbs of U3O8 from 75 M tons 
of ore grading approximately 2.1 lbs U3O8 per ton.  The Rio Algom mines produced 
approximately 206 Mlbs of U3O8 from 92 M tons of ore grading approximately 2.3 lbs U3O8 
per ton.   The total production was approximately 362 Mlbs of U3O8. 
 



  
 

 - 40 - 

In the late 1980s, the main contractor for uranium from Elliot Lake mines was Ontario's 
public energy utility Ontario Hydro.  Political pressure on the government and softening 
international uranium prices forced the government to renegotiate its contracts with Denison 
Mines Ltd.  Faced with high mining costs, the last remaining uranium mines in the Blind 
River Area were forced to close.  Before closure, the Denison and Agnew Lake mines 
attempted various innovative means to drastically reduce mining costs, such as flood leading 
in sealed stopes, and heap leaching, but recoveries failed to meet expectations.  In 1985, 
Denison assessed the potential of supplying 300,000 pounds of Y2O3 per year to Japan, 
however this was never realized due to the mine's inability to sustain uranium operations. 
 
Much can be learned from the mining history of the camp.  Most of this mining was 
completed using conventional room and pillar methods, and whole ore was crushed, ground 
and leached in a conventional sulphuric acid solution.  The initial mills lacked beneficiation 
circuits to separate the predominantly silica-bearing gangue from the pyrite-rich interstitial 
phase that carried the uranium and REE minerals.  As production was expended, the mills 
simply added additional circuits of the same design.  No effort was made to achieve 
economies through reducing the volume of material leached presumably because electrical 
energy used for heating was cheap in Ontario at the time.  Over time this changed and costs 
rose both for heating the leachate and for heating the large quantities of air needed for 
ventilation during the winter months. 
 
Denison Mines was also an innovator in respect to the application of bio-leach technology 
and in-situ (underground) leaching.  This is described in detail in Workman and Breede 
(2011). 
  
 
5.3 HISTORICAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES 
 
5.3.1 General Overview 
 
As mentioned in the foregoing, the closure of the Elliot Lake Mines was triggered by a 
collapse in uranium prices due to a tremendous over-supply of uranium on the world market 
far exceeding any demands from the military or from energy utilities.  The inventory of 
uranium in various forms had been building for more than 20 years, and the fall in prices 
came as no great surprise to those working in the industry at the time.  Mining in the Elliot 
Lake camp continued despite the new economic conditions due largely to long-term supply 
contracts that Rio Algom and Denison had negotiated with Ontario Hydro and a few other 



  
 

 - 41 - 

energy utilities.  As these contracts were satisfied or, in the case of Ontario Hydro, cancelled 
through a buy-out negotiation, the mines were faced with the reality of substantially lower 
revenue and ever escalating costs.  As a result, the mines closed leaving considerable lower 
grading uranium resources in the ground. 
 
With the run-up in prices seen during 2006 and 2007 when they were poised to exceed the 
inflation-adjusted record uranium market prices established during the period 1977-1979, the 
Elliot Lake area enjoyed a renaissance.  The exploration drilling by Pele Mountain Resources 
("Pele") that defined new Mineral Resources in Pecors Township is proof of both renewed 
interest and the potential for success.  The mineralization on Pele's property was known 
previously from considerable exploration work that outlined the uranium-bearing zone 
several decades ago.  Pele's so-called Eco Ridge deposit is situated approximately 10 km 
south of the Appia claim block.  Pele have announced a NI 43-101 compliant Mineral 
Resources as follows in Table 7.

Notes: 
1) Mineral Resources were estimated at a cut-off value of $100 per tonne for the Main Conglomerate Bed ("MCB"), and 

$50 per tonne for the Hanging wall Zone ("HWZ") based on prices and Pele's anticipated recoveries of uranium and 
rare earths, net of off-site rare earth separation costs.  Pele used an average uranium price of US$70 per lb U3O8 and 
a rare earth "basket price" of $78 per kg (net of separation charges), and a C$:US$ exchange rate of 1.00:1.00. 

2) A minimum mining thickness of 1.8 m was used for the MCB whereas the thickness of the HWZ was based on geology. 
3) Scandium (Sc2O3) is also included in HREO, as it occurs in low concentrations and carries high unit values like an 

HREO.

Prior to Appia's exploration work in the Elliot Lake basin, historical uranium resources were 
known to occur in five main areas of the Appia property as shown in Figure 4.  Based on drill 
hole evidence, they are summarized as follows: 

Teasdale Lake Zone located in Buckles Township approximately 1 km east of the 
former Can-Met Mine and situated obliquely on strike (and down 
dip) about 4 km southeast of the Panel Mine.   

Gemico Block 3 located on boundary between Buckles and Joubin Townships and 
situated obliquely down-plunge from the Stanrock Mine 

Gemico Block 10 located in south-eastern Bouck Township and down-dip of the 
Spanish American Mine 

Banana Lake Zone located in Beange Township and western Bouck Township, and 
situated in the centre of the Quirke Lake Syncline. 

The Canuc Zones located in west-central Bouck Township, and situated southwest of 
the Spanish American Mine in an area not intensively drilled.  

  
 
Appia's exploration drilling has focused on the Teasdale and Banana Lake zones, the 
historical information for which is detailed in the following section.  Whereas the up-dip 
portions of the Teasdale Zone are near the rim of the Elliot Lake Basin and approach the 
surface, the Banana Lake zone is located near the axis of the basin and therefore occurs at a 
much greater depth. 
 
Historical drill hole locations are shown in Figure 5.  Outlines of the major ore zones are 
shown as blue (Nordic) and green (Quirke) dashed lines.  The poorly defined southern 
boundary of the Quirke Zone has recently been reassessed by Alan MacEachern based on the 
assumed position of the pinch-out of the uranium-bearing Ryan Member of the Matinenda 
Formation.  This interpretation is also shown on Figure 5 based on the assessment report 
prepared by MacEachern for Appia (MacEachern, 2009).

5.3.2 Teasdale Lake Zone 
 
The area near Teasdale Lake (Figure 4) has been drilled during many periods, but the major 
historical drilling programs were completed during the mid-1950s as follows: 

1954-1955 Conecho Mines Ltd. 19 diamond drill holes – 9 holes 
not filed with Mining Recorder. 

1954-1956 San Antonio Gold Mines Ltd. 6 diamond drill holes totalling 
4,496.5 m (14,753 feet). 

1954-1957 Roche Long Lac Gold Mines Ltd 5 diamond drill holes totalling 
3,246.9 m (10,653 feet). 

 
The foregoing holes were targeted on the south-easterly extension of the main uranium-
bearing zone on the north limb of the Quirke Lake Syncline.  The area of drilling was centred 
only three kilometres ESE of the Can-Met Mine and four kilometres east of the Stanrock 
Mine. 
 

The Conecho Mines Ltd. ("Conecho") drilling program was evidently designed to test along 
strike of the Panel Mine in an area where the uranium-bearing Matinenda Fm. occurs at a 
relatively shallow depth.  All of the holes were drilled vertically.  Four of the holes reviewed 
by WGM produced interesting intersections:   

C-4 48.8 – 52.1 m 
(160.0-171.0 ft) 

3.3 m 
(11 feet) 

0.4 lbs U3O8/ton (0.020% U3O8) 

C-6 59.0 – 59.4 
(193.6-194.9) 

0.4 m 
(1.3) 

0.68 lbs U3O8/ton (0.034% U3O8) 

C-10 241.5- 244.4 
(792.3-801.7) 

2.9 m 
(9.4) 

0.2 lbs U3O8/ton (0.010% U3O8) 

C-13 312.7-322.6 
(1026.0-1058.4) 

9.9 m 
(32.4) 

0.54 lbs U3O8/ton (0.027% U3O8) 

 
 
WGM was not able to obtain logs for all of the Conecho drill holes because records for many 
holes (C9, C10, C12, C14 through C19) do not appear in the MNDM assessment files.  
Nevertheless, the records for the other holes show that the overlying sequence above the top 
of the Matinenda ranges in thickness from zero to 234 m (768 feet), with only three holes 
having more than 37 m (122 feet) of overlying material.

An undated independent report written by the late Mr. Doug Sprague, P.Eng., formerly Chief 
Geologist of Rio Algom Ltd., for Artisan Gold Inc. from which Appia acquired the claims, 
reports that the first 11 holes failed to intersect commercially interesting uranium 
mineralization.  This seems to reflect the fact that the intersections in holes C-4, C-6 and C-
10 (reported above) are generally thin and/or low grade.  In addition to what is in the 
assessment files, Sprague reports the following Conecho intersections: 

C-12 interval not available 1.5 m 
(5 feet) 

1.23 lbs U3O8/ton (0.062% U3O8) 

C-14 as above 1.5 m 
(5 feet) 

1.12 lbs U3O8/ton (0.056% U3O8) 

C-15 as above 1.5 m 
(5 feet) 

1.38 lbs U3O8/ton (0.069% U3O8) 

C-16 as above 1.5 m 
(5 feet) 

1.00 lbs U3O8/ton (0.050% U3O8) 

C-17 as above 1.5 m 
(5 feet) 

1.07 lbs U3O8/ton (0.054% U3O8) 

C-18 as above 1.5 m 
(5 feet) 

0.98 lbs U3O8/ton (0.049% U3O8) 

C-19 as above 1.5 m 
(5 feet) 

1.42 lbs U3O8/ton (0.071% U3O8) 

 
 
The foregoing Conecho drill holes C-12 through C-19 were evidently completed sometime in 
late 1955 or in 1956.  As the host rocks are not steeply dipping in this area, the intersection 
length in all of the Conecho holes is very close to the true thickness of the mineralized zone, 
and it very closely matches the actual mining height for room and pillar mining.  A 
compilation map produced by independent mining engineer Robert MacGregor of Sault Ste 
Marie, and supplied to WGM shows that C-14 and C-15 intersected, respectively, 1.2 lbs 
U3O8/ton over 4.0 feet (1.2 m) and  1.8 lbs U3O8/ton over 3.9 feet (1.1 m), effectively 
confirming the numbers reported by Sprague. 
 
The San Antonio Gold Mines Ltd. ("SAGM") drilling program consisted of a single fence of 
six vertical holes along a north-south section located south of Teasdale Lake, and 
immediately east of the Appia property.  In moving towards the south, the holes 
progressively encountered an ever thickening assemblage of strata overlying the basal 
Matinenda conglomerates.  Holes SA-1 and SA-6 are sufficiently close to the Appia property 
to be of interest.  Unfortunately, no assays were filed with the San Antonio drill logs.  
Sprague reported that none of the holes intersected values of interest.  It is clear that holes 
SA-4 and SA-5 were not drilled deep enough to reach the Matinenda Fm.  The third hole was 
drilled into what may be a basement high which stands above the elevation of the Matinenda 
Fm.  The geological information from hole SA-2 is not present in the MNDM file below 
3,322 feet (1,012.5 m), and with a total length of 4,215 feet (1,285 m) it is clear that the hole 



  
 

 - 47 - 

crossed the prospective Matinenda horizons to basement.  Strong radioactivity was reported 
from a pitchblende vein in hole SA-1 at 2022.5 ft (616.5 m), but no assay is reported.  The 
drill core from hole SA-6 between 2,945 and 3,010 feet (897.6-917.4 m), located 
immediately above the greenstone basement, was removed before the core was logged and no 
description is available in the public records.  This is very unusual and leads immediately to 
the speculation that the core was well mineralized, despite Mr. Sprague's belief 4, because the 
hole is clearly on the trend of mineralization from the Panel Mine. 
 
The Roche Long Lac Gold Mines ("Roche") holes were completed on the islands and near 
the main shoreline of Quirke Lake, approximately 4 km from the Panel Mine and as little as 
1.5 km from the Can-Met shaft.  Of the seven holes drilled, the MNDM records contain the 
logs and assays for five.  Of these, three holes reported intersections ranging between  2 m 
and 9.5 m grading between 1.1 and 1.8 lbs U3O8 per ton as follows: 

R-1 556.4 – 557.0 m 
(1825.3 – 1827.3  ft) 

560.3 – 561.7 m 
(1838.4 – 1842.9 ft) 

652.4 – 563.3 m 
(1845.0 – 1848.2 ft) 

0.6 m 
(2.0 feet) 

1.4 m 
(4.5 feet) 

0.9 m 
(3.2 feet) 

1.1 lbs U3O8/ton 
 

1.14 lbs U3O8/ton 
 

0.94 lbs U3O8/ton 
 

(0.055% U3O8) 
 

(0.057% U3O8) 
 

(0.047% U3O8) 

R-3 626.9 – 628.4 
(2056.8 – 2061.8 ft) 

1.5 m 
(5.0) 

1.8 lbs U3O8/ton (0.90% U3O8) 

R-5 576.7 – 579.6 
(1892.0 – 1901.5 ft) 

2.9 m 
(9.5) 

1.5 lbs U3O8/ton (0.075% U3O8) 

 

Hole number R-4 showed anomalous radioactivity in the interval 611.1-614.8 m (2,005-
2,017 ft) but only very low uranium values of 0.01-0.02% U3O8 (0.2-0.4 lbs/ton) were 
reported.  Similarly, Roche drill hole R-2 showed anomalous radioactivity at 733.0-742.5 m 
(2,405-2,436 ft) in the hole, but the samples did now show significant uranium assays. 

Mr. Sprague completed a resource estimate which is of an uncertain date, but which WGM 
believes must be treated as historical and non-compliant with current CIM standards and 
guidelines.  It is based solely on the drilling carried out during the 1950s, and is based in part 
on Mr. Sprague's experience gained when he was Chief Geologist, Rio Algom Ltd. during 
the period 1960-1990.  Mr. Sprague notes "the calculations were done in the same manner 
that was used when the mines were in production, in fact, some of the uranium resources 
were calculated by the Panel Mine staff at the mine's closure as a mine-indicated resource".  

                                                 
4  Mr. Sprague notes the 65 ft section was in the Lower Mississagi Fm., however he does not describe the 

rock type encountered, nor does he say whether quartz-pebble conglomerates were present. 



  
 

 - 48 - 

Several of the holes, notably C-20 and C-16, were drilled 250-500 m (800-1,600 feet) from 
Panel Mine underground workings.  A polygonal approach was used whereby each drill hole 
intersection was applied to the grade and thickness (tonnage) of each resource block.  The 
"mine-indicated" resource blocks are all adjacent to existing Panel Mine workings.  Lower 
confidence "drill-indicated" blocks, are square blocks measuring 800 feet by 800 feet (244 m 
square) centred on drill hole intersections.  Possible blocks having the lowest confidence are 
those areas that occur between the other blocks.  The historical, non-compliant resources 
reported by Mr. Sprague were quantified as follows in Table 8.

Note:    1) The foregoing resources are of a historical nature – they should not be relied upon for investment decisions 

as the estimates are not compliant CIM Standards and Guidelines for the estimation of Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves and are therefore not compliant with current National Instrument 43-101 
requirements. Neither Appia nor its Qualified Persons have done sufficient work to classify the historical 
resources as current mineral resources under current mineral resource terminology and are not treating the 
historical resources as current mineral resources. 

2) Under current rules, the addition of higher confidence Measured and Indicated resources and lower 
confidence Inferred Resources ("Possible" under historical terminology) would not be allowed. 

 
 
5.3.3 Gemico Block #3 
 
Gemico Block #3 was defined by Rio Algom Ltd. within the boundaries of a group of claims 
that it acquired from Gemico during the late 1970s.  The block is illustrated on a map drafted 
by Rio Algom Ltd. (1979) and provided to WGM by the MNDM in Sault Ste Marie.  The 
map bears the title "Gemico Properties, Elliot Lake Area" and is referenced as drawing #791. 
 
The down-dip location of the uranium-bearing conglomerates is shown on the map.  WGM 
believes that this outline is based on mine geology and evidence from diamond drill holes.  A 
stippled area represents that portion of the uranium-bearing zone which is located under the 
Gemico claims.  Within this area, Rio Algom has estimated that a "potential resource" of 
some 42.8 million tons of mineralization exists having an average tenor of 0.38 lbs U3O8 per 
ton over an average thickness of 28.5 feet.  This estimate is apparently based on a single drill

hole, KM-144-1, put down by Kerr McGee near the north-western boundary of the claims.  
The hole intersected a zone having this grade and thickness.  According to the original drill 
log that WGM obtained from the MNDM assessment files, the mineralized zone contains a 
higher grading interval at 1,118.0-1,121.4 m (3,668-3679 ft) averaging 0.46 lbs U3O8 per ton 
over a thickness of 3.4 m (11 ft).  The volume of the mineralized zone is confined to the 
Gemico claims and is truncated by the inferred margin of the mineralized zone.  It is clear 
that uranium mineralization extends to the east, north and west of the Gemico claims.  The 
truncation of the mineralization to the south is not justified as two holes, Nasco #2 and Nasco 
#3 intersected mineralization of interest approximately 500-800 m south of the Gemico 
claims.  Nasco #2 intersected 0.8 lbs U3O8 per ton over a thickness of 1.5 m (5 ft), the grade 
being an average of the initial intersection (0.76 lbs U3O8/ton over 1.5 m) and a second 
wedged cut (0.84 lbs U3O8/ton over 1.5 m).  Nasco #3 intersected 0.5 lbs U3O8 per ton over a 
thickness of 4.5 m (14.9 ft). 
 
Given Rio Algom's experience as one of the two main uranium producers, and based on the 
foregoing evidence, WGM accepts the above-mentioned historical estimate as a reasonable 
estimate of the exploration target within the Gemico #3 block which shows that a higher 
grading core zone is present, likely grading 0.5-0.8 lbs U3O8 per ton, that could positively 
influence the viability of mining this zone.  The potential quantity and grade is conceptual in 
nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain 
if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.  As the 
area held by Appia also covers the area surrounding the Gemico block, we conclude that the 
mineral potential on the Appia claims is probably greater than that estimated for the block 
alone, and that additional drilling is justified to increase the resource base.  
 
 
5.3.4 Gemico Block #10 
 
Rio Algom estimated that the uranium-bearing conglomerates underlying the Gemico #10 
block contained a "potential resource" of 20.7 M tons with an average grade of 0.75 lbs U3O8 
per ton with an average thickness of 3 m (10 ft).  This historical estimate, which does not 
comply with current NI 43-101 requirements, was based on Kerr McGee drill hole KM-150-1 
(1.6 lbs U3O8 per ton over 1.5 m [5 ft]), drilled in the north-western area of the zone, as well 
as two drill hole intersections on the Denison block completed by Denison Mines Ltd and 
Uranez Mitsui: 

DU-76-2 0.62 lbs U3O8 per ton over 2.1 m (6.9 ft). 
DU-76-3 0.65 lbs U3O8 per ton over 3.8 m (12.4 ft). 

 



  
 

 - 50 - 

Like the Gemico #3, the mineral potential of the #10 block is constrained by the geographical 
boundaries of the claims available to Rio Algom as shown on the above-mentioned Rio 
Algom map.  It is significant that a large block of ground to the north, previously owned by 
Denison Mines Ltd., is located immediately down-dip of the Stanrock and Spanish American 
Mines.  This block is now part of the claim group held by Appia.  The historical resource 
estimated for the #10 block was further constrained by the limits of the zone thought to be of 
ore grade at the time of the estimate.  According to Sprague (date?), the western margin of 
this mineralized zone is delimited by the Ramsey Lake Scour,  within which the middle 
Mississagi boulder conglomerate was deposited in a channel eroded downwards through the 
uranium-bearing Matinenda quartz-pebble conglomerates.  This feature is well illustrated on 
Figure 5 which is from Rupert (1980). 
 
Sprague confirms the intersection in Kerr McGee drill hole 150-1, but refers to an 
intersection in hole DU-76-2 of 0.40 lbs U3O8 per ton over 46.1 feet (14.1 m).  This clearly 
exceeds the intersection reported from other sources, although the two are not mutually 
exclusive.  The sample data were not available to WGM however MacEachern rightly asserts 
that this represents the entire Denison main zone reefs of the Quirke Ore Zone.  The narrower 
intersection of 0.62 lbs U3O8 per ton over 2.1 m (6.9 ft) is the lower reef only. 
 
WGM successfully located the intact casing for hole KM-150-1 in the field and surveyed its 
location by GPS.  WGM's review of the Kerr McGee hole from the original log taken from 
MNDM assessment files shows that the zone in hole 150-1 can be widened somewhat to take 
in the lower grading shoulders and thereby give a mineralized width of 2.6 m (8.5 ft) grading 
1.1 lbs U3O8 per ton. 
 
Hole DU-76-1, collared near Quirke Lake, immediately down dip of the Stanrock Mine, and 
less than one kilometre east of the Gemico block also produced an interesting intersection of 
0.72 lbs U3O8 per ton over 4.7 m (15.4 ft). 
 
For the same reasons as cited in respect to the Gemico #3 block, WGM accepts the foregoing 
historical estimate as a reasonable expression of the magnitude of the exploration target in 
the Gemico #10 block.  The potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, there has 
been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further 
exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.  As the area held 
by Appia also covers the area surrounding the Gemico block, we conclude that the 
exploration potential on the Appia claims is probably greater than that estimated for the block 
alone, and that additional drilling is justified to increase the resource base.

5.3.5 Banana Lake Zone 
 
The area west, north and east of Banana Lake was included in the Gemico #2 claim block.  
This area has been well tested by deep diamond drill holes, most of which was completed by 
Kerr McGee Corp.  The area north of Banana Lake was also drilled much earlier during 
1955-56 by Buffalo Uranium, however the four holes completed totalled only 1,227.1 m 
(4,026 ft), none being greater than 343.5 m (1,127 ft) in length, and none was sufficiently 
deep to reach the uranium-bearing Matinenda Fm. 
 
Based on the drilling completed, Rio Algom estimated a historical, non-compliant resource 
for that part of the uranium-bearing Matinenda located below the Gemico #2 claim block.  As 
with above-mentioned estimates for the Gemico #3 and #10 blocks, the estimate for this area 
is constrained by the geological limits of the mineralized trend which may extend from the 
Stanleigh Mine to the southeast.  It is also constrained by the physical limits of the claim 
blocks available to Rio Algom.  For example, the uranium-bearing conglomerates clearly 
extend to the east onto a large claim block formerly controlled by Denison, however this 
resource area was not included in the Rio Algom estimate.  According to MacEachern, 
Denison did not complete its own forward-looking estimate of the uranium resources on its 
own claims.  The Rio Algom historical resource estimate is also constrained by drill holes 
that returned trace values for uranium or failed to intersect the Matinenda conglomerates at 
the anticipated depths, for example in drill holes KM-149-2, KM-156-4 and KM-150-4. 
 
Rio Algom estimated that the Gemico #2 block claims contained a potential uranium 
resource of 175.8 M tons of U3O8 with an average grade of 0.76 lbs U3O8 per ton, and with 
an average thickness of approximately 5.4 m (17.6 ft).  These historical estimates of grade 
and tonnage are viewed as reliable and relevant based on the information and methods used 
at the time. However they are not compliant with resource definitions under NI 43-101 and 
must be considered only as historical resources. Neither Appia nor its Qualified Persons have 
done sufficient work to classify the historical resource as a current mineral resource under 
current mineral resource terminology and are not treating the historical resource as a current 
mineral resource. The historical resource should not be relied upon. This historical resource 
estimate was based on a collection of the company's widely spaced drill holes which are 
summarized as follows: 

KM-156-5 0.65 lbs U3O8 per ton  (0.33 kg/t)  over 34 ft  (10.4 m) 
KM-150-5 0.88 lbs U3O8 per ton  (0.44 kg/t)  over 44 ft  (13.4 m) 
KM-150-2 0.68 lbs U3O8 per ton  (0.34 kg/t)  over 11 ft  (3.4 m)  

 



  
 

 - 52 - 

WGM successfully located the collar and casing for the KM-150-2 drill hole, and surveyed 
its position by GPS to within an estimated position error of less than 3 m.  As this was purely 
a test of WGM's ability to locate a hole using the historical records as a guide, WGM did not 
attempt to locate the other holes (subsequently located by Appia). 
 
WGM's review of the assessment record filed for Kerr McGee hole 156-5 showed that the 
record contains only 61 m (200 feet) of geology ending in the Gowganda Fm.  Given the 
placement of the hole, it is not reasonable to conclude that the hole was intended to be a 61 m 
hole.  No mention of hole abandonment is contained in the public record.  WGM is of the 
opinion that the depth reported on the Rio Algom map (1,554 m or 5,099 ft) is correct and 
that Kerr McGee filed only that amount of the hole that was needed to maintain the claim(s) 
in good standing, a common practice at the time.  WGM has also of the opinion that the 
uranium intersection reported on the Rio Algom map was also correct (subsequently 
confirmed by Appia's drilling in 2007-08). 
 
WGM's review of Kerr McGee hole 150-5 showed that the hole was drilled to 1,497.5 m 
(4,913 ft) a depth sufficient to ensure that the hole intersected the Matinenda Fm. at 
approximately 1,433 m (4,700 ft).  However, the geology and assay results for the section 
below 1,346 m (4,416 ft) were selectively removed from the drill hole record filed with the 
Ministry.  What is now available through the MNDM ERMES database (MDI Reference 
#41J07NE0052) lacks the geological record below 1,346 m (4,416 ft) and lacks sample data.  
The graphic log for the hole below 1,347.2 m (4,420 ft) has been hidden by a piece of blank 
paper put in place at the time the log was photocopied.  Given the timeframe, Kerr McGee's 
failure to file complete drill hole records for assessment purposes is not surprising.  WGM 
believes this critical information was withheld because of the higher grade and thicker nature 
of the uranium intersection.  Hole NDM #2, drilled in the southwest corner of the Canuc 
Property, and filed by New Delhi Mines Ltd. in 1957 had a key section at 1,457-1,581 feet 
(444.1-481.9 m) in the lower Mississagi Quartzite (Matinenda Fm), only 21 feet (6.4 m) 
above the bottom of the hole, blacked out by felt pen to protect information WGM assumes 
the company considered to be proprietary (AFRI Reference # 41J07NE0061).  In hindsight, it 
is regretful that the Mining Recorder accepted such submissions at the time 5. 
 

                                                 
5  At the time the drilling was completed, the Ontario Mining Recorder awarded annual assessment credits for 

work completed.  Each claims was required to have a specific number of days of work completed per year.  
Diamond drilling produced credits of one day per foot drilled, but no additional credits were awarded if the 
drill log contained assay results.  For this reason, companies commonly filed the hanging wall geology 
which accounted for most of the hole length, and omitted the mineralized zone, or if the zone was included, 
withheld the assay data. 



  
 

 - 53 - 

The foregoing historical Banana Lake resources represent an approximate exploration target 
that is confined not only by Gemico claim boundaries, but also by drill holes completed by 
Kerr McGee to the south (149-2 and 156-4) and to the north (150-4) which failed to intersect 
the Matinenda conglomerates.  The potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature.  
There has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if 
further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.  In Beange 
Twp., a few kilometres to the northwest, hole 156-1 intersected 1.76 lbs U3O8 per ton over 
0.6 m (2 ft) in an area which is excluded from the foregoing historical resource.  This hole 
suggests additional potential to the west although the economically interesting uranium 
grades are present in a thin horizon that would not be minable unless greater thicknesses 
were discovered nearby. 
 
A Canuc Mines Ltd. annual report for 1976 reports the results of three Kerr McGee drill 
holes completed "immediately west of the present claim holdings of Canuc, which have 
located a possible extension of the Nordic Zone.  These three holes suggest a block of ground 
which may hold 180,000,000 tons containing a potential reserve of 126,000,000 pounds of 
uranium oxide".  Although the delineation of the "Nordic Zone" requires substantial deep 
drilling, this reference gives sufficient credence to the Rio Algom historical estimate for 
WGM to believe that a significant exploration target remains in the area.  Based on this 
estimate, the target might conceptually be in the range of 100-200 million tons grading 0.7-
1.4 lbs U3O8/ton and containing 70-140 M pounds of uranium oxide.  Although Appia's 
current drilling results in this area are positive, until a comprehensive exploration drilling 
program is completed it is uncertain whether a NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource of this 
size will be identified. 
 
Given Rio Algom's experience developing mines at Elliot Lake, WGM is prepared to accept 
the broad brushed historical approach to defining resources in the Elliot Lake area, especially 
given the stratiform character of the deposits.  This approach was successfully used by both 
Rio Algom and Denison to plan new mines and in developing new ore zones.  However, the 
foregoing historical resource block underlies an area totalling approximately 6.2 km2 (2.4 
mi2) and is based on only four holes, with an additional three holes constraining the zone.  
Although the geological basis for the estimate appears to be reasonable, too little hard 
evidence is available in this area to associate the resources identified by Rio Algom with any 
current NI 43-101 compliant resource classification.  WGM accepts the abovementioned 
estimate as a reasonable estimate of the magnitude of the potential exploration target in this 
area.  WGM believes that the thicknesses reported offer underground bulk mining 
possibilities that could greatly reduce mining costs.  Clearly, additional drilling is required to 



  
 

 - 54 - 

bring these historical resources into NI 43-101 compliance.  It must also be stressed that the 
area held by Appia covers prospective areas that were not on the original claims held by 
Gemico, and therefore we consider the foregoing statement of potential to be a minimum 
reflection of the potential of the claims now held by Appia. 
 
5.3.6 Other Zones 
 
In its attempts to corroborate resource information, references were found to drilling carried 
out by Canuc Mines Limited during 1968 and subsequently on claim blocks 4, 5 and 6.  In 
the company's 1976 annual report, the company states its plans to drill a minimum of three 
holes to outline mineralization which had been discovered in the northeast corner of Block 5 
of its claims.  The company had inferred a resource of some 7 million tons grading 1.86 lbs 
U3O8 per ton to exist in this area situated southwest of the Spanish American Mine.  The area 
may have previously been thought to be affected by the Ramsey Lake scour that removed the 
lower uranium-bearing horizons of the Matinenda Formation, and which marks the NW-
trending discontinuity in uranium mineralization shown in Figure 7 crossing the middle of 
the Appia claim block.  Apparently follow-up holes intersected lower, but still interesting 
grades of 0.63 lbs U3O8 per ton over a thickness of 1.4 m (4.6 feet) in drill hole 77-C-1 
located on Block 4 (Figure 4 location uncertain).  Mr. Len Cunningham, P.Eng., an 
independent consulting engineer and resident of Kirkland Lake reviewed the results and 
recommended additional drilling (Canuc Annual Report, December 1977). 
 
Although WGM was unable to determine how the aforementioned historical resources were 
estimated, and it was unable to locate a log for hole 77-C-1, it does appears certain that 
economically interesting uranium grades and some uncertain tonnage exists on the former 
Canuc claims.  WGM believes that the foregoing historical resource, which does not comply 
with current estimation guidelines and standards as contained in NI 43-101, must be treated 
as an approximation of the size of the exploration target in this area.

5.3.7 Summary of Historical Uranium Resources

The historical estimates of grade and tonnage set out above are viewed as reliable and 
relevant based on the information and methods used at the time. However they are not 
compliant with resource definitions under NI 43-101 and must be considered only as 
historical resources. Neither Appia nor its Qualified Persons have done sufficient work to 
classify the historical resources as current mineral resources under current mineral resource 
terminology and are not treating the historical resources as current mineral resources. The 
historical resources should not be relied upon. 
 
The foregoing historical resources summarized in Table 9 were estimated by mine operators 
using practices that were common at the time, but which do not comply with current 
regulatory standards and guidelines.  It is doubtful that quality control standards used at the 
time would meet more rigorous requirements in practice today.  Specifically, the operators 
relied on experience and assumptions of continuity rather than factual drill hole geology and 
assay data.  As such, these estimates do not comply with NI 43-101 and should not be used 
for investment decisions. 
 
It is worth noting that WGM could find no mention of historically estimated rare earth metal 
resources, a reflection of the fact that such metals were affected by weak markets during the 
peak uranium production period, and that yttrium-REE production was incidental to uranium.  
As a result, drill core was not routinely assayed for such metals.

6.  GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
6.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
The regional geology of the Elliot Lake area was previously described in detail in Workman 
and Breede (2009, 2012) and will not be repeated as such here. 
 
The Elliot Lake area is located on the southern margin of the Archean component of the 
Superior Province of the Canadian Shield (Figure 6).  As is typical across North America, the 
margin is marked by a series of structural basins and troughs which contain late Archean to 
early Proterozoic sedimentary rocks.  The structural basins or troughs that contain uranium-
bearing conglomerate formed within or on the Archean continental crust.  The southern limit 
of the Archean has not been precisely located because Paleozoic, and younger sedimentary 
rocks cover most of the area south of the early Proterozoic basins. 
 
Significant iron formation deposits in NW Ontario and the American border states as well as 
most of the known occurrences of uraniferous quartz-pebble conglomerate are found in the 
marginal basins.  Although the uranium deposits are diverse, and differ in age by as much as 
several hundred million years, they share many sedimentary and structural characteristics.  
The sedimentary sequences laid down on the shield margins record several transgressive 
cycles each resulting in deposition of fluvial-to-marine or glacial-to-marine conglomerates 
and sandstones, followed by shallow-marine clastic or carbonate rocks (International Atomic 
Energy Agency, 1987).  Generally the final cycle of sedimentation ends with deep-water-
marine dark shales, greywacke and volcanic rocks.  Episodes of extension, compression, 
intrusive magmatism and metamorphism occurred during the same approximate period of 
time 
 
The Lake Huron region, within which Elliot Lake is located, contains the early Proterozoic 
Huronian Supergroup, of which the basal deposits in the Elliot Lake district contain the 
world's most important deposits of uranium in Precambrian conglomerate.  The ore-bearing 
conglomerate beds are found in the Matinenda Formation, the basal unit of the Elliot Lake 
Group within the Huronian Supergroup.  The uranium-bearing conglomerate is a clean, well 
sorted, coarse-pebble conglomerate which was apparently deposited in a mixed littoral and 
fluvial-deltaic fan environment, possibly as the early Proterozoic sea transgressed up onto the 
Archean craton.  The conglomerate is overlain by and interfingers in a time-transgressive 
relationship with the shallow-marine McKim Formation. 
 



  
 

 - 58 - 

Pyrite is the main iron mineral found in the Matinenda Formation, whereas superseding 
formations contain predominantly hematite.  The Th-U ratio in radioactive placer deposits 
first increases to greater than ten in the Lorrain Formation.  This is thought to present strong 
evidence that during the early Proterozoic deposition of the Huronian Supergroup, a 
profound change in the Earth's atmosphere resulted in a transition from non-oxidizing to 
oxidizing conditions.  Neither the uranium in the quartz-pebble conglomerates nor the iron 
formation deposits found elsewhere on the edge of the Archean craton would have been 
stable had the earth's atmosphere not been anoxic at the time of deposition. 
 
 
6.2 GEOLOGY OF THE ELLIOT LAKE AREA 
 
The Elliot Lake area is underlain by an approximately east-west trending basin within which 
the Huronian sedimentary strata on-lap the Archean basement to the north, and presumably 
also to the south.  Uranium mineralization occurs in the predominantly quartzose and arkosic 
basal conglomerates of the Matinenda Formation, located near the base of the Huronian 
sequence and unconformably overlying the Archean basement.  The stratigraphic 
nomenclature for the Elliot Lake area is shown in Table 10. 
 
The Huronian succession is folded into an east- trending syncline, the Quirke Lake Syncline, 
which is located immediately north of the city of Elliot Lake.  Uranium-bearing Matinenda 
Formation strata are exposed on the limbs of the fold, but occur at vertical depths of +/- 
1,500 m (5,000 ft) near the centre axis of the basin.  Uranium mines are located on both 
limbs and the Quirke Lake structure has been well tested an explored by underground mine 
developments as well as deep exploration drilling.  The Can-Met, Denison, Panel, Quirke, 
New Quirke, Stanrock and Spanish American mines are located on the north limb whereas 
the Buckles, Milliken, Lacnor, Nordic and Stanleigh mines are situated on the south limb. 
 
The Matinenda Formation is the coarse-grained sandstone unit at the base of the 
stratigraphically lowest megacycle.  To the north, it on-laps over an irregular Archean 
basement surface, filling paleo-valleys and draping over intervening hills.  Uranium-bearing 
quartz-pebble conglomerates (Plate 2) occur within the sandstones in the lower part of the 
Matinenda Formation, forming laterally extensive deposits with NW-trending long axes.  In a 
general sense, the NW end of the conglomerates either abuts against basement or is cut of by 
an erosive scour at the base of the overlying Ramsay Lake Formation.  The conglomerates 
die out to the southeast by an increase in the proportion of interbedded sandstone wedges and 
a general reduction in grain size. 



  
 

 - 59 - 

The uranium-bearing portion of the Matinenda is divided into three members.  From 
uppermost downwards, these are the Manfred Member, the Stinson Member and the Ryan 
Member.  The presence and thickness of these members and their uranium-bearing zones is 
dependent on the relative elevation of the Archean unconformity and the topography of its 
surface. 
 
Two principal ore zones are present: the Quirke Ore Zone on the north limb of the basin (the 
Quirke Lake Syncline), and the Nordic Ore Zone on the south limb.  The Quirke Ore Zone 
occurs in the Manfred Member of the Matinenda Formation.  The Nordic Ore Zone occurs in 
the Ryan Member.  It is important to note that there is no Ryan Member on the north limb 
and the Manfred Member is absent on the south limb.

The Stinson Member of the Matinenda Formation lacks uranium in economically interesting 
concentrations.  The base of the Stinson in some areas of the Nordic Ore Zone is marked by 
angular, grey granite-clast conglomerate (as compared to quartz pebble clasts in the ore reefs), 
usually with a matrix of mostly smaller grey granitic material and some, mostly minor, pyrite.  
This horizon, is usually 2.0-5.5 m thick and is called the Stinson basal conglomerate - it can 
be very useful as a marker or reference horizon to indicate the top of the Nordic Ore Zone reef 
hosting Ryan  member. 
 
On balance of evidence, a fluvial placer mode of origin is accepted as the most reasonable 
genetic model for the uranium deposits hosted in the Matinenda Formation.  At Elliot Lake 
the occurrence of large-scale flood events has been proposed as a means of widely depositing 
detrital uranium.  Some idea of the extensive nature of these deposits is provided by the scale 
of Figure 7.  The documented presence of glacially derived mixtites associated with 
Matinenda sediments leads to speculation that catastrophic ice-margin lake drainage flowing 
down an outwash fan deposited the uraniferous conglomeratic units present in the lower 
Matinenda Formation. 
 
The Quirke Ore Zone is a classic sedimentary delta-type deposit.  Quartzose and 
conglomeratic sediments bearing detrital uranium were introduced through a narrow 1,800 m 
(6,000 ft.) wide valley in the basement and spread out to the east and southeast to cover an 
area of approximately 80 square kilometres (30 sq. miles).  There is very little Stinson  
member and no Ryan member between the  Manfred member and the basement in the Quirke 
Ore Zone.  Where the Manfred member is thickest, there are two pairs of reefs separated by 
36 m (120 feet) of quartzite.  The past producing mines of the Quirke Ore Zone were: 
Denison, Stanrock, CanMet,  Quirke (1), New Quirke (2), Panel and Spanish American.  
 
Outside of the mined areas at it's southeast end, much of the Nordic Ore Zone is not well 
defined by surface diamond drilling.  It has been thought to begin approximately 6.5 
kilometres (4 miles) northwest of Banana Lake as a 1.5 - 2.5 km (1 - 1.5 mile) wide basement 
depression channel with relatively steep basement sides (MacEachern, 2009).  It extends for  
approximately 11 km (7 miles) south and southeast of Banana Lake, widening to 
approximately 13 km (8 miles).  There may be some Stinson Member but no Manfred 
Member overlying the Ryan Member in the Nordic Ore Zone.  Where the Ryan Member is 
thickest there are three reefs in the Nordic Ore Zone.  In descending order these are the 
Pardee, the Nordic and the Lacnor Reefs.  The past producing mines of the Nordic Ore Zone 
were: Stanleigh, Milliken, Lacnor, Nordic and Buckles.  Most of the uranium produced was 
from mining in the Nordic and Lacnor Reefs.  Where there is sufficient thickness of the Ryan 



 

 - 62 - 

Member above the  Pardee Reef, thin conglomerate or pebble beds called "Floater Reefs" may 
be present, but to date these occurrences are very thin and do not appear to be economic. 
 
Below the Lacnor Reef, Appia holes BL-07-01, BL-08-02 and BL-08-03 have intersected 
reefs composed of rounded 8-15cm (3-6 inch) white quartz cobbles (Cobble Reef or Cobble 
Quartzite), with pale olive green irregular-shaped siltstone clasts and a few black chert clasts. 
Uranium grades in these rocks appear to be related to the amount of pyrite in the individual 
beds. 
 
Another zone called the Pardee Zone is located approximately 4.5 km (3 miles) east  of the 
Nordic Mine, east of the southeast corner of the Nordic Ore Zone.  The Pardee Zone is 
approximately 2.5 square kilometres (1 square mile) in size and is separated from the Nordic 
Ore Zone by a basement high (ridge).  Pele has been working on the Pardee Zone since early 
2007 and has completed major drilling programs on its Eco Ridge Deposit.  
 
The uranium-bearing conglomerates are massively bedded, but do show localized evidence of 
horizontal stratification. Trough cross-stratification due to meandering deltaic channel 
development is present in the pebble conglomerates in areas where numerous sandstone 
lenses occur.  Occasionally the cross-sets can be traced from the conglomerate into sandstone 
lenses.  Sandstones interlayered with the conglomerate and forming units separating 
conglomerate packages are generally trough cross-stratified with cross-set amplitude 
averaging approximately 12 cm. 
 
Detrital uraninite and brannerite is concentrated in the more massive portions of the 
longitudinal bars as well as in lags along horizontal reactivation surfaces in stacked bars.  The 
bars themselves represent rare, discrete high energy events in a succession that is dominated 
by braid-channel deposits (trough cross-stratified sandstones).  The gravel bars are localized 
in the lower portion of the formation, usually being confined to paleovalleys (Roscoe, 1969). 
 
The water-borne transport of uranium detritus was from north to south during deposition of 
the lower portions of the Matinenda.  As time passed the regional paleoflow direction 
gradually changed to NW to SE and eventually to WNW to ESE.  The counter-clockwise 
rotation in paleocurrent direction is thought to reflect crustal subsidence to the east of the area 
in which the Matinenda Formation was studied. 
 
Pyrobitumen occurs in the Matinenda Formation in and near ore-bearing horizons.  Stevenson 
et al (1990) report the occurrence of stratiform and dispersed kerogens, and concluded that the 



 

 - 63 - 

kerogens formed from mats of cyanobacteria that were affected by diagenetic and low-grade 
metamorphic processes including partial remobilization.  During burial and metamorphism, 
rising temperatures cracked the kerogens to form petroleum, which migrated into fractures 
and subsequently became pyrobitumen through a combination of water-washing and thermal 
cracking which converted the oil into a more tarry form.  As this tarry material detached from 
the wall, it formed spheroids that floated upward and were trapped in vuggy openings in the 
fractures.  It is clear to WGM that the presence of kerogens might have contributed to the 
stabilization of uranium minerals under strongly reducing conditions in the mineralized beds. 
 

 
Plate 3:  Black quartz-pebble conglomerate commonly referred to as "chlorite ore" - generally thought 

of as high-grade ore due to significant higher pyrite-brannerite contents  – 3 cm hammer scale. 
 
Economically interesting uranium mineralization is not pervasive throughout the basin.  
Figure 7 shows the distribution of the main uranium-bearing zones of quartz-pebble 
conglomerate.  The favourable horizon is affected by the topography on which the 
conglomerates were deposited, as well as scours (river channels) which eroded down through 
the conglomerates following their initial deposition.  As is also clear, large areas in the deep 
basin such as that near Banana Lake, have been shown to contain uranium values exceeding 
0.5 lbs per ton.  Yttrium-REE minerals have long been known to co-exist with uranium.

7.  DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The Elliot Lake (and Agnew Lake) deposits are known as paleoplacers and classified by the 
Geological Survey of Canada as sub-type 1.1.1 (Eckstrand et al, 1995).  Uraniferous 
conglomerates occur in many parts of the world, and are similar to those of other metal 
commodities, notably gold, platinum group metals, tin, tungsten, rare earth minerals, titanium, 
zirconium and chromium.  The economic minerals are typically deposited in conglomerates at 
the base of a sedimentary cycle which may, over time, see a gradual transition to lower energy 
deposition.  Although similarities exist between these deposits through the geological 
timescale, the younger deposits tend to be hematite-rich (subtype 1.1.2) whereas late Archean 
and early Proterozoic deposits tend to be associated with pyrite.  This difference is one factor 
of many that indicate that the early Earth's atmosphere was anoxic and transitioned to an 
oxygenated atmosphere somewhat later. 
 
The paleo-placer deposits are stratabound, commonly occurring in stacked sheet-like bodies 
of conglomerate.  Mineralization is entire disseminated and the highest grades are associated 
with quartz-pebble conglomerates.  The pebbles are generally well rounded (Plate 4), and 
some association between pebble size and uranium grade is noted.  Placer deposits are created 
wherever rapidly flowing water allows heavy mineral particles to settle out while less dense 
mineral particles and rock fragments are transported through the depositional site.  The term 
paleoplacer is generally reserved for only such mineral concentrations as constitute 
economically interesting deposits in lithified strata.  The erosion of the parent rock and 
transport of detrital material results in degradation of all but the hardest minerals.   
 
During the 1940s and 1950s, debate centred on whether these deposits were truly syngenetic 
(placers) or whether they were epigenetic (grown in place) or purely hydrothermal.  Davidson 
(1958) favoured a hydrothermal model which has fallen out of favour, although the potential 
for recrystallization of uraninite and accretion of additional uranium onto existing mineral 
grains is still recognized as a possibility.  Friedman (1958) points out that Th-enrichment is 
regional at Elliot Lake, extending well beyond those zones of U-enrichment outlined by 
exploration drilling.  He concluded that the weight of evidence suggests a sedimentary origin 
for the mineralization because no known hydrothermal process could explain the widespread 
thorium anomaly.  This is supported by Roscoe (1959) of the Geological Survey of Canada 
who very concisely states "the ore deposits near Blind River represent exceptional, uranium-
rich, deposits within an extensive province of thorium-rich clastic sedimentary rocks".  The 
presence of resistate minerals, such as uranium bearing silicates (zircon), is also difficult to 
explain in an epigenetic model.  In the Blind River District, the presence of brannerite 
(UTi2O6) and U-bearing phosphates such as monazite ([Ce,La,Nd,U,Th]PO4) and xenotime 



 

 - 66 - 

(Y-UPO4) relates quite well to the weathering of a U-Th and Ti enriched (granitic) source.  
Brannerite it is believed to have developed as a result of uranium ions adsorbing onto 
decomposing Ti minerals such as ilmenite. 
 

  

Plate 4:  Elliot Lake ore - rounded quartz pebbles in U-bearing, sulphide-rich matrix – 3 cm hammer 
scale. 

 
 
Most recently, Robinson and Spooner (1984) have underscored the strong evidence for a 
paleoplacer origin for the U-Th mineralization in the Blind River District.  New evidence 
shows that the regional metamorphic grade is negligible and that the quartz-pebble 
conglomerates are affected by syn-depositional faulting consistent with a rift margin setting.  
The authors add that primary uraninite grains were deposited with coarse smoky quartz, 
perthitic microcline, magnetite with ilmenite lamellae, monazite and zircon, however, the bulk 
of the pyrite which constitutes 5-10 vol-% of the ore is post-depositional in origin.  Pyrite 
occurs as overgrowths on detrital pyrite grains and on uraninite grains altering to coffinite.  
The simple mineralogy of the Elliot Lake ores has been well documented. 



 

 - 67 - 

8.  MINERALIZATION 
 
The ore mineralogy was previously described in some detail in Workman and Breede, the 
contents of which are summarized as follows: 
 

• mineralization consists primarily of detrital grains of brannerite and uraninite, together 
with minor uranothorite, monazite and secondary coffinite associated with pyrite, 
pyrrhotite, zircon, rutile and Ti-magnetite as interstitial fill in a quartz pebble 
conglomerate; 

• main ore mineral is brannerite, containing small inclusions of pyrrhotite and 
radiogenic galena, and occurring as ovoid, reddish-brown grains associated with 
bladed rutile surrounded by uranium oxides and rare earth oxides 

• second most important ore mineral is uraninite which occurs as black subhedral grains 
up to 0.1 mm in size containing approximately 6% ThO2 by substitution; 

• monazite is a lesser ore mineral which contains an unusually high uranium content as 
inclusions (also uranothorite or thorite) - occurs as rounded to subangular grains 
typically less than 0.3 mm in diameter; 

• pyrite content is typically 10-15% of the rock (Robertson, 1981) which only rarely 
occurs as fracture fillings; also occurs as inclusions in monazite; 

• uranothorite and coffinite have been identified as minor mineral phases; 

• yttrium has been an important by-product of uranium mining but the other REEs have 
not seen production to date; 

• the average REE balance in the Elliot Lake camp is: 0.8% La2O3, 3.7% CeO2, 1.0% 
Pr6O11, 4.1% Nd2O3, 4.5% Sm2O3, 0.2% Eu2O3, 8.5% Gd2O3, 1.2% Tb4O7, 
11.2% Dy2O3, 2.6% Ho2O3, 5.5% Er2O3, 0.9% Tm2O3, 4.0% Yb2O3, 0.4% Lu2O3, and 
51.4% Y2O3 ; 

• non-metallic gangue minerals in the matrix of the conglomerate are represented by 
quartz, feldspar and sericite.  In some mines a dark grey to black hued ore is reported 
to contain fine grained chlorite (Plate 5); 

• thucholite, an organo-uranly compound (U-bearing radioactive bitumen), occurs 
locally as thin laminae and as a void-filling mineral phase within ore zones at Elliot 
Lake (Plate 6); and, 

• uranium ores are hard and very well indurated resulting in favourable rock conditions 
for underground mining. 

 
New and specific information concerning the mineralogy is discussed in the Metallurgy 
section of this report.

The deposits at Elliot Lake have been historically referred to as uranium deposits because of 
the far greater economic importance derived from past uranium production than that from 
REEs and thorium.  However, in the Elliot Lake deposits, REEs occur in much greater 
abundance than uranium.  In the Teasdale Deposit Mineral Resources, as estimated in this 
report, the average REE content is approximately 6 times greater than the average uranium 
grad.  Even in that part of the deposit with the highest uranium grade, the REE grade averages 
approximately 3 times greater.  
 
There are few references as to the physical dimensions of the Elliot Lake deposits, in part 
because the mines often exploited individual portions of the same large sheet-like deposit.  
The mineralization is commonly referred to as stratabound and 3-5 metres in thickness and 
having "good lateral continuity. 
 
Kerr Addison reported on the Agnew Lake Mine giving appreciable insights into the size of 
the deposits from the resource estimation parameters in use at that mine.  Only deposits of 
considerable uniformity and size would permit the use of drill hole spacings of 400 feet (122 
m) for the outlining of probable reserves as defined by Kerr Addison's mine engineering 
department.  Given the need for accountability in production planning, one can well 
appreciate the uniformity of grade that supported the use of such a wide spacing as the 
standard convention. 
 
Robertson (1981) describes the physical dimensions of the deposits.  The largest of the 
deposits, the Denison Mine, measured 19,500 m long by 1,400 m to 8,000 m wide.  The 
deposit carried an average grade of 2.5 lbs of U3O8 per ton of ore.  The next largest at Rio 
Algom's Quirke Mine measured 13,000 m by 1,800-5,500 m wide.  The Quirke A Reef at the 
#1 mine was 3.5 m thick.  The Quirke #2 mine's C Reef was 1.8-3.6 m thick and other 
uranium-bearing horizons were present.  A typical geological section through the Denison 
Mine is shown in Figure 8.

9.2 RECENT EXPLORATION 
 
Since the completion of the drilling programs in 2008, additional diamond drilling was 
completed by Appia on the Teasdale Zone during 2012 which has confirmed and materially 
increased the size of the Teasdale Deposit.  The drilling totalled 16 holes completed from 
surface, one wedged hole and one abandoned hole totalling 8,130.2 m of drilling (Table 12).

Appia's drilling was carried out during the summer months using a barge to transport the drill 
on Teasdale Lake and drill sites were positioned on the shore of the lake.  This approach 
precluded the need and expense of a helicopter for moving the drill and equipment between 
sites.  Special care an attention was used to prevent petroleum products and other drill run-off 
from entering the lake.  The locations of the holes are shown in Figure 9.  All drilling was 
carried out to produce NQ sized core, however some lower sections were drilled with BQ core 
due to problems higher in the hole and a need to reduce.

The previous WGM drilling plan proposed to Appia called for drill sites to be established on 
ice platforms in Teasdale Lake during the winter in order to assure an optimum drill hole 
spacing in the target zone.  This was deemed important as the purpose of the recommended 
drilling campaign was to support a new (up-dated) Mineral Resource estimate for the 
Teasdale Deposit.  With Appia's approach to summer drilling, multiple holes were drilled 
from many of the drill sites on different angles and bearings to ensure that the uranium-
bearing target horizon was intersected in much the same manner as originally planned.  All 
drill holes were geologically logged by Appia's QP, Mr. Alan MacEachern, P.Geo., formerly 
the Chief Mine Geologist for Denison Mines Ltd., who also selected and submitted the 
samples for analysis.  In WGM's view, the 2012 drilling accomplished much of what was 
previously proposed, although only 17 of the proposed 39 holes were drilled leaving many 
areas with significant resource potential yet to be tested. 
 
 
9.3 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 
 
The sampling procedure utilized by Appia's personnel during the drill program is summarized 
as follows: 

1) the core was geologically logged and sections were selected for analysis based on 
geology and radiometric activity using a hand-held RS-125 Super-SPEC portable 
gamma ray spectrometer manufactured by Radiation Solutions of Mississauga, 
Ontario, Canada 6; 

2) the mineralized core intervals were split in the core shack in Elliot Lake using a 
diamond core saw - one half of the drill core was bagged, a pre-numbered sample 
tag was placed in the bag and the samples was sealed before being sent to 
Activation Laboratories (ActLabs) in Ancaster, Ontario for analysis; 

3) the remaining half of the core was retained in the core tray as a permanent record; 
4) at the lab, the samples were dried, crushed and pulverized in preparation for the 

analysis for uranium, thorium, REEs, silver and 28 trace elements as well as the 
major oxides; and, 

5) the trays of split drill core are stored in core racks that are inside a locked building 
in Elliott Lake. 

                                                 
6  The instrument uses a 6 cubic inch NaI crystal sensor to measure a full spectrum of gamma particles in 

either 256 or 1025 channels.  In assay mode it produces count data for the conventional total count, 
potassium, uranium and thorium energy windows up to a maximum of 65,000 cps.  Pre-programmed 
stripping ratios are used by the instrument to convert the measured count rates to equivalent concentrations 
for K (%), U (ppm) and Th (ppm).  Sample time is user-selectable to improve precision through the use of 
longer count times.  The instrument has an internal memory allowing for up to 1,000 samples and has both 
USB and Bluetooth output capabilities. 



 

 - 76 - 

The un-split cores from overlying formations are being stored outside of the core logging 
building, cross-stacked and covered within a fenced area. 
 
Most elements including the REEs, uranium, thorium and silver, were determined in 
accordance with Actlabs fusion-mass spectrometer technique; some trace elements and the 
major oxides used the fusion-ICP technique (both Code 8 analyses). 
 
 
9.4 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
WGM's verification procedures for historical data, including its success in verifying some of 
the previously reported drill hole locations and uranium intersections, are discussed in 
previous reports (Workman and Breede) and will not be repeated here. 
 
WGM has no information on the REE grades of the historical drill core discussed in this 
report.  The logs that report uranium grades lack REE data.  We believe that REE assaying 
was seldom practised as a result of the weak commodity prices that prevailed during much of 
the uranium mining that occurred in the Elliot Lake camp.  We believe that the assured by-
product nature of the yttrium-REE production coupled with the relative uniformity of yttrium 
and REE grades did not provide sufficient incentive for mines and explorers to incur the 
additional analytical costs. 
 
WGM also confirmed the historical Teasdale resources using a simplified model that 
duplicated the polygonal approach used previously by Sprague, applying variables to the in-
puts that might represent a reasonable range of best-estimate scenarios.  Details of this are 
provided in Workman and Breede. 
 
Despite being very active in the design and execution of the initial drilling programs, WGM 
visited the Appia drill sites after each of the 2007-08 drilling programs, confirmed drill sites 
and selected check samples for its independent reanalysis.  WGM found no significant 
irregularities in the approaches used by Appia or the information reported.  WGM was also 
actively involved in the communications and decision-making process pertaining to the 2012 
drilling.  WGM visited the project site on 15 July, 2013 to examine the drill core, to discuss 
the project status with Mr. MacEachern and to confirm the locations of selected drill sites.

10.  2012 DIAMOND DRILLING 
 
10.1 SUMMARY 
 

As summarized in the foregoing section, Appia completed 16 diamond drill holes from 
surface and one wedged hole totalling 8,130.2 m of drilling between mid-June and early 
September, 2012 (Table 12).  This included one hole that was abandoned and redrilled due to 
a failure in the initial hole.  The drilling contractor was an independent (private) company 
under the management of Mr. Richard Lavoie of Val d'Or, Quebec.  All holes were drilled 
through the uranium-brearing hosizons in the lower Matinenda Formation and many were 
drilled into the Archean basement comprising granite or volcanic rocks. 

 

 
Plate 9:   Appia's smaller drill on the shoreline of Teasdale Lake – sites were chosen to minimize the 

need for access roads. 
 

Appia's original plan, based on WGM's recommendations made in 2008, was to carry out a 
winter drilling program using ice platforms to drill-test the Teasdale Deposit on centres 
approximately 50 m apart.  The goal of this program was to provide a basis for classifying the 
uranium resources as predominantly Indicated Resources.  For a variety of reasons, including 
the desire to avoid the use of an expensive helicopter for project support, Appia elected to 
carry out the drilling during the summer months.  A barge was used to transport the drill on 
Teasdale Lake, and the drill was off-loaded onto islands and the main shoreline where drill 
sites were positioned.  Special care and attention was used to prevent petroleum products and 
other drill run-off from entering the lake.  Co-ordinate and set-up data for the holes was given 
in Table 14 under "Recent Exploration", and the hole locations are shown in Figure 9. 



 

 - 78 - 

The drill holes were completed with NQ equipment at angles ranging from -55 degrees to 
vertical.  In many cases, several drill holes were completed from the same collar location 
employing different angles or a variety of bearings to provide spaced intersections on the 
uranium-bearing formation.  This approach was made possible by the moderate dip of the host 
rocks and capitalized on the predictable location and depth of the mineralization.  The net 
benefit of Appia's approach was a reduction of drilling costs from that budgeted.  Inclusive of 
all costs relating to personnel, sampling, assaying…etc, the total cost of the drilling completed 
was approximately $1.974 million or $243 per metre.  This compares very favourably with 
the original $7 million budget for a 15,405 m program ($454/metre7). 
 
The drilling was supported using a Reflex EZ-Shot down-hole surveying tool to capture 
bearing and inclination data on approximate 50-metre intervals.  All drill hole collars were 
surveyed by GPS using the NAD 83 datum.   
 
Appia analysed a total of 1,213 samples from the 17 diamond drill holes during the course of 
the 2012 drilling program.  In addition, Appia included quality assurance/quality control 
("QA/QC") samples made up of 27 duplicate samples, 13 blanks and 22 certified standards.  
Appia's control samples comprised approximately 1 sample in every 20.  The samples were 
analysed at the Actlabs accredited geochemical laboratory located in Ancaster, Ontario as 
described in Section 9.3 of this report. 
 
 
10.2 DRILL HOLE GEOLOGY 
 
Typical stratigraphic sequences found in the Teasdale drill holes are shown for drill holes 
AEC 12-08 and AEC 12-09 in Figure 9.  The Appia drilling intersected the uraniferous 
conglomerates at varying depths due to the Matinenda Formation's moderate southerly dip. 
 
Most of the Matinenda formation is composed of quartzite with occasional interbeds of 
pebbly quartzite.  The quartz-pebble conglomerates that are the important uranium-bearing 
horizons ("reefs") are located in the lowermost part of the Matinenda.  Although thin 
uranium-bearing conglomerate horizons may occur anywhere in the lower half of the 
Matinenda, two major mineralized horizons are specifically recognized as being of economic 
importance: the Upper Reef ("UR") and the Lower Reef ("LR"), separated by the 

                                                 
7  The $7,000,000 budget included a provision for helicopter support for 6,000 m or 40% of the program and 

included a provision of $120,000 for the construction of ice platforms.  The actual amount expended includes 
the cost of the barge and a tractor for moving the drill.

Intermediate Quartzite ("IQ").  A summary of the average intersected grades for each of these 
horizons in the Appia drill holes is presented in Table 13. 
 
Although quartzite is not the major host to mineralization, it is not unusual for grades in 
excess of 250 ppm U and 2,000 ppm TREEs to occur in thin, gritty to pebbly quartzite beds 
up to 25 cm thick in the hanging wall above the main U-bearing horizons.  For example, in 
hole AEC12-12, a 20 cm thick pebbly-quartzite ("PQ") bed located 1.35 m above the UR 
carries 413 ppm U and 6,063 ppm TREEs.  Moving upwards and away from the uranium host 
rocks, these matrix-supported PQ beds become less common and occur farther apart resulting 
in a gradual lowering of overall (bulk) grades for both U and REEs.  These horizons also 
occur in the footwall section immediately below the main uranium-bearing reefs, and have 
been accordingly referred to as Hanging Wall Pebbly Quartzite or Footwall Pebbly Quartzite 
in the company's drill hole logs.  Some quartzite sections contain thin horizons that are pyrite-
bearing, with the pyrite occurring as fine, scattered grains or as continuous mm-scale seams 
along bedding laminations. 
 
In most of the Appia DDH's, the UR is poor to faint, and is a mixture of interbedded pebbly 
quartzite, conglomerate and minor quartzite.  According to MacEachern, it was unrecognized 
and not assayed in most of the historical Conecho logs, and it is not shown on mine plans 
covering the eastern areas of the Panel Mine adjacent to the Teasdale Deposit.  Doug Sprague 
did not include the UR on his plan of reserve blocks for Conecho.  The assaying of drill core 
for REE mineralization resulted in Appia's discovery of REE mineralization of potential 
economic significance in most beds of PQ and in quartzite adjacent to the thin conglomerate 
beds that comprise the UR.  The UR is enriched in REEs relative to U (Table 13) and the 
average ratio of REEs to U is 10.4 : 1.  It's average thickness is 4.4 m. 
 
The IQ comprises the section immediately overlying the LR, and it is composed of between 
two and four metres of quartzite with minor PQ and little or no quartz-pebble conglomerate.  
It averages approximately 2.7 m in thickness and on rare occasions it exceeds 4 m in 
thickness, however in hole AEC12-13 the IQ is only 52 cm in thickness.  This hole is unusual 
in that it is also characterized by a strongly mineralized siltstone unit underlying the lower 
reef which is discussed further in the following text.  These variations may be imposed by 
bedding-parallel slips (faults) that are difficult to recognize in the core.  Because of U and 
REE enrichment in the PQ horizons, the IQ typically contains between 50 and 200 ppm U 
(average = 99 ppm) and between 500 and 1,500 ppm TREEs (average = 938 ppm) as can be 
seen in Table 15.  In the IQ unit, the REE:U ratio averages 9.1 : 1 in the Appia drill holes.  In 
general, the average grade of the IQ increases with higher PQ contents.

Notes: 1) In drill hole AEC12-03, the Lower Reef was poorly developed. 

2) In drill hole AEC12-10, the Lower Reef was displaced by a swarm of lamprophyre dikes and only the uppermost 28 cm of the lower uranium-bearing horizon was present in this hole – some fault dislocation is possible. 

3) In drill hole AEC12-14, the Upper and Lower Reefs and the Intermediate Quartzite were displaced by a dike and so were not present in this hole.

The LR is the main carrier of uranium, and it is this reef that was exploited in the Elliot Lake 
uranium mines.  Most of the Appia holes intersected a LR ranging in thickness from 1.4 m to 
5.4 m, and the average length of the LR in the Teasdale drill holes was 2.95 m.  The true 
thickness of the LR is approximately 2.7 m and it averages 438 ppm U and 1,512 ppm 
TREEs.  In holes where the geology shows the reef to be poorly developed or compromised 
by intrusive rocks, such as in holes AEC12-03 and AEC12-10, grades may be substantially 
lower.  In well developed LR, the REE:U ratio is 3.4: 1. 
 
 
10.3 DISCUSSION OF DRILLING RESULTS 
 
Appia's continuing drilling of the Teasdale area has extended the area of known 
mineralization beyond the limits imposed by the company's first phase of drilling.  A typical 
composited vertical section that is approximately normal to the strike is presented in 
Figure 11.  The earlier drilling confirmed the results reported from the original Conecho 
drilling carried out during 1954-55 and provided some new geological and assay data between 
the older holes.  Appia's initial drilling program also confirmed as "reasonable" an earlier 
resource estimate by Rio Algom's Chief Geologist Doug Sprague, P.Eng., and provided a 
basis whereby Appia disclosed a modest NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for the 
Teasdale deposit as reported by WGM (Workman and Breede).  The drilling carried out by 
Appia in 2012 substantially extended the area of known mineralization by completing a 
significant part of the diamond drilling previously recommended by WGM.  The average 
grade and intersected thickness of the UR-IQ-LR unit is shown for each hole.  As is shown, 
the mineralized zone is open down-dip. 
 
All of the Appia holes completed during the 2012 drilling programs intersected the uranium-
REE bearing horizons in the lower part of the Matinenda Formation, namely the UR, IQ and 
LR horizons.  The total length of the mineralized sections in the drill holes varied from 8.6 m 
to 11.4 m in the recent drill holes.  The grades-thicknesses encountered by Appia were more 
or less the same as those intersections taken from historical records, although complete 
comparisons are impossible since the upper reef was not recognized as such at the time, and 
the original holes were assayed only for uranium.  The Appia drilling does show that the 
mineralized zone extends to the boundary of the company's claims and is probably contiguous 
with the mineralization that remains in the old Panel Mine workings. 
 
WGM carried out a new mineral resources estimate to provide an up-date to its earlier 
estimate reported by Workman and Breede.  This estimate, and the parameters on which it is 
based are contained in Section 17 of this report.

11.  SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
During the drilling program, uranium-bearing intervals were delineated on the basis of 
diagnostic radiometric signatures as measured with a hand-held RS-125 Super-SPEC portable 
gamma ray spectrometer manufactured by Radiation Solutions of Mississauga, Ontario, 
Canada.  The specifications and capabilities of this instrument are described in Section 9.2 of 
this report.  It is important to understand that the equivalent potassium, uranium and thorium 
data provided by portable spectrometers allow insight into the elemental make-up of a 
radioactive source, but they do not provide analytical data.  Such data can only be accurately 
provided through conventional geochemical analysis under controlled conditions in a 
laboratory.  Equivalent metal data is calculated based on statistical algorithms integral to the 
instrument's software, and the accuracy of such data is influenced by the manner in which the 
instrument is used, its performance, ambient conditions and operator experience.  Radiometric 
data was used only as a guide in selecting intervals to be sampled and assayed. 
 
After geologically logging the core, the mineralized sections were delimited for sampling by 
permanent marks across the core and a cutting line was added to ensure consistent sampling.  
Individual samples were selected based on geology such that conglomerate horizons, pebbly 
quartzite beds and intervals of quartzite were sampled separately.  No sample exceeded one 
metre in length, and samples as short as 15 cm were taken.  The core was cut in half using a 
diamond saw, with one half of the core being placed in the sample bag with a pre-numbered 
tag and sealed, and the other half returned to the core tray with a matching sample tag as a 
permanent archival record.  Plate 10 shows a core tray with pre-arranged sample tags prior to 
cutting. 
 
Appia's 2012 drilling program generated 1,211 routine drill core samples.  In addition, 69 
duplicate samples, 47 certified standards and 27 blank samples were inserted into the sample 
stream and blindly submitted to the laboratory for quality assurance/quality control 
("QA/QC") purposes.  All samples were analysed as batches and the lab was not aware of the 
QA/QC samples.  Three different certified standards from the CANMET8 and CDN Labs9 of 
Burnaby, B.C. were used (DL 1A, UTS-4 and BL-3).

The field blank was developed using essentially barren country rock.  Control samples 
constituted approximately 10.6% of the samples submitted by Appia.  This QA/QC program 
was in addition to the internal control program carried out by the laboratory.

12.  SAMPLE PREPARATION AND SECURITY 
 
For reasons cited herein, no surface sampling has been carried out by Appia on the Property, 
and all samples submitted for analysis have been derived from diamond drill core. 
 
The Appia drill core samples were submitted to Activation Laboratories ("Actlabs") of 
Ancaster, Ontario.  Actlabs is a fully accredited geochemical laboratory that meets both 
ISO/IEC 17025 with CAN-P-1579 standards as recommended by the Toronto Stock 
Exchange-Ontario Securities Commission mineral standards taskforce. 
 
On receiving the samples, Actlabs dried and crushed the entire core sample to a nominal 85% 
passing a #10 mesh screen, before repeated riffle splitting of the crusher product to generate 
an aliquot of approximately 250 g.  The subsample was then pulverized to a nominal 95% 
passing a #200 mesh screen using a ring and puck pulverizer to ensure that REE minerals 
were sufficiently reduced to ensure complete fusion during the assaying technique.  Cleaner 
(wash) sand was used between each sample to prevent carry-over. 
 
Most elements including the REEs, uranium, thorium and silver, were determined in 
accordance with Actlabs' fusion-mass spectrometer technique; some trace elements and the 
major oxides used the fusion-ICP technique (both Code 8 analyses). 
 
The Code 8 Nb-Zr-Y-Ta-U-Th-Phosphate assay package was used to analyze for these 
elements by fusion with lithium metaborate/tetraborate in platinum crucibles with the molten 
glass cast into a glass disc.  These glass disks were then analyzed on a Panalytical Axios 
Advanced wavelength dispersive XRF instrument.  REEs and major oxides were determined 
separately using an ICP and ICP/MS instrument after a lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion.  
Mass balance is required as an additional quality control technique and elemental totals of the 
oxides should be between 98 to 101%.  Although an acid digestion can be used for REEs, it is 
not advised since REEs can occur as resistate minerals meaning that any such digestion will 
produce a partial analysis reflecting only acid-soluble REEs.  
 
Previously, the analysis of Appia's samples for uranium was primarily by Actlabs' Code 5D 
which uses neutron activation and delayed neutron counting (DNC).  Approximately one 
gram of sample was weighed into a polyethylene capsule which in turn was sealed into a 
carrier vial for neutron irradiation within a slowpoke nuclear reactor.  The sequentially 
irradiated samples are transferred automatically to the BF3 counting array detector using a 
computer automated system.  Calibration is achieved with certified reference materials.  All 



 

 - 88 - 

elements in the sample absorb neutrons which produce a subsequent emission that can be used 
to measure the composition of the sample using an array of BF3 neutron detectors.  This 
technique, more generally referred to as neutron activation analysis, is ideal for measuring 
uranium and many other trace elements from sub-ppm to percentage levels.  The method does 
have limitations as certain interferences can occur.  It measures total metal content which may 
not be relevant in the sense of mineral economics, for example, it measures total uranium 
rather than soluble uranium.  While the difference may be trivial in most geological 
environments, DNC analysis may include non-recoverable uranium that is contained in the 
crystal lattice of resistate minerals such as zircon.  Fortunately, the Elliot Lake mineralization 
contains no significant amount of refractory minerals and thus the uranium concentration 
database should be unaffected by mineralogically induced assay variability.  
 
A few samples were analysed for gold using an Actlabs Code 1A2 procedure which is a 
conventional 1050oC fire assay on a 30 g charge with an atomic absorption instrumental finish 
giving a 5 ppb lower detection limit (the upper limit is 3,000 ppb).  Normally, any sample 
exceeding the upper limit of 3,000 ppb is reanalyzed using a gravimetric finish in which the 
prill is weighed. 
 
The Appia geologist retained possession of samples until they were delivered to the courier 
for shipping to the lab. 
 
All the split cores are currently being stored in core racks that are inside a locked building in 
the town of Elliot Lake.  The un-split cores, which are not generally mineralized or of 
importance from a resource standpoint, are being stored outside the building, cross-stacked, in 
a fenced area.  Sample intervals from the drill program are permanently recorded  in drill logs 
combined with the assay results.

13.  DATA CORROBORATION 
 
13.1  OVERVIEW 
 
Appia's exploration work has been under the management of Alan MacEachern who provided 
independent QP oversight for the Appia exploration program as well as core logging and 
sampling.  WGM visited the project site during 15 July, 2013 and confirmed drill hole 
locations and briefly examined the drill core which had been extensively sampled both for 
routine analysis and for metallurgical testing. 
 
Although the WGS-84 datum normally be used for the Elliot Lake project, Appia uses the 
NAD-27 (Canada) datum all location measurements to maintain consistency with the Ministry 
of Northern Development and Mines ("MNDM") which uses this datum for its records of 
drill hole locations stored in its ERMES database.  During the previous Appia drilling 
program, WGM used the NAD-27 datum for checking drill hole locations.  In comparing the 
use of WGS-84 and NAD-27, WGM has found that the physical difference in co-ordinates 
between the two datums was 3-5 metres as measured on the ground.  The GPS Utility 
software licensed to WGM converted between the two datums and between geographic co-
ordinates and UTM co-ordinates with no significant variance after the data is discounted for 
the estimated position error.  In Workman and Breede (2009), WGM reported on inaccuracies 
in the MNDM co-ordinates for previously drilled holes and Appia's success in resurveying 
the locations of the on-shore historical holes drilled by Conecho in 1954-55.  
 
As part of its data corroboration efforts, WGM secured original assay certificates for the 
Appia drill core samples from Actlabs.  WGM carried out a detailed audit of the project's 
assay database and found no errors that would have compromised the resource estimate.  
WGM questioned the accuracy of one down-hole survey value which was in error in the drill 
hole database and this was corrected after referring to the original survey data. 
 
In confirming the locations of drill sites, WGM measured the locations of the holes shown in 
Table 14 which are compared with the original measurements.  In general the WGM co-
ordinates compared favourably with the original co-ordinates, and in no cases where the 
variances sufficient to significantly influence the Teasdale resource estimate.

13.2  BEDROCK SAMPLING 
 
As mentioned in the foregoing text, the mineralized conglomerates in the Matinenda 
Formation rarely outcrop and do not outcrop on the Appia property.  No amount of surface 
sampling can provide Appia with any answers concerning the uranium-bearing conglomerates 
that have been intersected on the Appia property. 
 
Appia previously followed WGM's recommendation for a Phase 1 drilling program intended 
to corroborate some of the historical drill holes in the Teasdale Lake Zone.  This work was 
successful in confirming the original intersections, and while some variations were 
encountered, no discrepancies were found such that uranium mineralization was absent where 
formerly reported.  In addition, the thicknesses of the mineralized zones were comparable 
(Workman and Breede).  On this basis, Appia was confident in the outcomes of the follow-up 
2012 drilling program which is the subject of this report.

13.3  EVALUATION OF LABORATORY PERFORMANCE 
 
WGM previously discussed Appia's QA/QC program and laboratory performance relating to 
the earlier drilling programs carried out by Appia at Teasdale Lake and Banana Lake 
(Workman and Breede).  In that review, WGM found that four standards failed, falling 
outside of what it would accept as a normal range of values.  Actlab's internal checks that 
were inserted at the time of analysis performed well, so it is possible that the failures represent 
anomalies within the standard (as unlikely as that may seem), or some form of contamination 
that occurred during sample preparation.  These findings were discussed with the initial Appia 
project geologist, Sonny Bernales, and it was agreed that additional tests would be made in 
the future on any samples associated with unusual assays of such standards.  This resulted in a 
doubling of the frequency that Appia inserted standards and other quality control samples in 
the sample stream submitted to Actlabs. 
 
Workman and Breede also reported on a set of WGM check samples collected previously 
which showed reasonably good overall correlation to the assay results reported originally.  
WGM also cautioned on need for careful sample preparation because uranium mineralization 
tends to occur as brittle, heavy mineral grains (some microscopic) that may be difficult to 
properly homogenize within granular or pulped samples.  Care is required in sample 
preparation and any process involving the subdivision of samples as the slightest vibration 
can result in the settlement of heavy mineral particles. 
 
The results of Appia's most recent QA/QC program are illustrated in the following graphs.  
Figure 12 illustrates the comparison between duplicate samples.  Assays are shown for U, Th 
and TREEs.  The first set, field duplicates, is derived from re-cutting the normal half-core 
sample of drill core into two equally sized quarter-core samples which are submitted blindly 
to the lab under different sample numbers.  The second set, lab duplicates, is produced 
internally by the Actlabs sample preparation crew by creating a second sample from one 
sample in each group of +/-25 samples submitted by the client.  These samples serve as an 
internal quality control measure along with certified standards.  The results show some 
outliers which triggered re-analysis at the laboratory and the results were inconclusive, 
pointing to an irregular distribution of U or REE minerals in the sample, and not to laboratory 
error. 
 
 



 

 - 92 - 

 
Figure 12: The graph shows the correlation between the assays on duplicate samples, both laboratory duplicates 

and field duplicates, illustrating little or no systemic differences in the two populations.  Outliers 
exist in both populations which WGM attributes to variations in the amount of mineralization within 
the samples rather than lab error. 

 
Appia's use and assaying of blank samples resulted in the maximum, minimum and average 
values shown in Table 15.  While the uranium, thorium and rare earth content of the blanks is 
not zero, the values have assayed within a narrow range that is sufficiently low to provide a 
meaningful guide as an expression of laboratory performance.  The high REE value detected 
in one sample (#W1381775) skewed the average grade of the entire blank sample population 
as it contained 74 ppm Ce, 177 ppm La, 22 ppm Dy, 91.5 ppm Nd and 17.7 ppm Sm, all 
values that significantly higher than normal (4-7 x average).  This sample was analysed after 
several samples that were weakly mineralized in REEs, however the level of enrichment was 
relatively low and thus carry-over contamination cannot explain the relatively high values in 
the blank.  The standards used by both the laboratory and those inserted by Appia for this 
group of samples also analysed within very close tolerances of the certified values.  Appia's 
two inserted standards that accompanied this group of samples assayed within 2-3% for the

REEs and were within less than 1% for uranium and thorium.  These results suggest that 
Appia's blanks are imperfect, with some carrying a range of REE values that reduce their 
usefulness as control samples.

WGM concluded that Appia's control samples generally supported the high-quality 
performance of the laboratory and that better blank source material should be acquired for 
QA/QC purposes.  In terms of WGM's experience from many other exploration projects, 
including uranium, base metals, REEs and gold, Appia's field duplicates performed no better 
and no worse than other duplicate sample populations.  WGM's experience has shown that 
field duplicates are generally a poor way to test laboratory performance because it is rare that 
a true duplicate sample can be produced from the opposite sides of the drill core10. 
 

                                                 
10  WGM believes that the only good way to achieve a field duplicate is to process (finely crush and/or pulverize) the 

core in the field, and then to use a laboratory quality sample divider to split the sample into two equal halves.  This 
demands care and expertise since improper use of a sample divider can introduce heterogeneity into the samples.

14.  ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
Under NI 43-101 and in the context of this report, an "Adjacent Property" is a mineral 
property with a boundary reasonably close to the boundary of the Appia Elliot Lake area 
property. 
 
An adjacent exploration property is held by Pele Mountain Resources Inc. ("Pele") of 
Toronto, Canada.  The Pele property comprises a 100-percent interest in 313 mining claims 
covering more than 12,500 acres near Elliot Lake and covering portions of Rio Algom's past-
producing Lacnor Mine property where the Pardee reef was identified.  Pele has referred to 
this as its Eco Ridge Mine Uranium Project ("Eco Ridge Project").  Pele's ownership is held 
via its wholly owned subsidiary, First Canadian Uranium Inc. ("FCU"), and is subject to a 
1.75% net smelter royalty that is owned by CanAlaska Uranium Ltd. on the Pardee Claim 
Group, of which Pele may buy back 1-percent for $1-million.  The location of the Eco Ridge 
Project is shown in Figure 13. 
 
The Pele property has been extensively drilled with more than 100 historic drill holes 
completed since 1953 by a number of companies including McIntyre Porcupine Mines Ltd. 
which was the initial discoverer of uranium mineralization in this area on claims it had 
optioned from Aquarius Porcupine Mines Ltd.  Aquarius subsequently constructed a 30-metre 
adit for sampling purposes. New Jersey Zinc Exploration Co. also drilled a few holes in the 
area as did St. Mary's Uranium Mines Limited, Stancan Uranium Corp., Algom Uranium 
Mines and many others.  The data was compiled by Rio Algom in 1977 after it acquired the 
exploration rights to this area.  Pele completed a single 224 m hole during 2006. 
 
Based essentially on the historical work, Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. ("SW-
RPA") released a NI 43-101 compliant report dated 15 January, 2007 (available on SEDAR) 
for the property which contained a mineral resource estimate that totalled 30.05 Mt grading 
0.05% U3O8, in the Inferred Mineral Resource category for a total inferred uranium content of 
33.05 Mlbs of U3O8. 
 
SW-RPA completed a Preliminary Assessment during late 2007 and its report entitled 
"Preliminary Assessment on the Elliot Lake Project, Ontario, Canada Prepared for Pele 
Mountain Resources Inc." by Cochrane et al (2007) and dated 3 October, 2007 was filed on 
SEDAR.  Under NI 43-101, feasibility studies are not allowed on Inferred Resources, 
however a company may complete a Preliminary Assessment which is defined as an 
economic analysis carried out to investigate the potential viability of mineral resources at an 



 

 - 95 - 

early stage in a project.  Also known as "Scoping Studies", reviews such as these can answer 
questions concerning the need for a project to discover additional resources at the same grade, 
or alternatively, whether the company requires higher grading resources to meet viability 
criteria.  The SW-RPA study was based on the previously estimated mineral resources 
(0.030% U3O8 cut-off grade, 2.70 specific gravity), 10% dilution, a US $55.00 per pound 
U3O8 commodity price and an exchange rate of C$1.00 to US$0.90 (Cochrane et al, 2007).  
The mining method selected was based on a combination of panel drifting and horizontal 
long-hole slashing with approximately 60% of the ore treated in place by underground 
bioleaching and 40% of the ore hauled to surface by ramp for conventional milling and 
treatment in an acid-leach plant.  A 3,214 tonne per day production rate was used in the study 
with ore averaging 0.045% U3O8 over an 18 year mine life.  Uranium recovery was assumed 
to be 90% by conventional milling and 70% by bioleaching.  The study concluded: 

• capital costs related to project development would be C$195 million; 

• on-going capital costs would add another C$63 million over the 20-year life of the 
project, including the rehabilitation period); 

• operating costs per pound of U3O8 produced over the life of the project would be 
US$55.51; 

• costs associated with decommissioning would total C$31 million; 

• based on a commodity price of US $95.00 per pound of U3O8, the project generated 
gross revenue of C1.5 billion and had a net present value ("NPV") of C$363.5 million 
using a zero discount rate and C$41 million using a 10% discount rate, both before 
taxes; 

• at the 10% discount rate, the project had a pre-tax internal rate of return ("IRR") of 
13%; and, 

• a US$5 increase in the commodity price would increase the IRR to 15%. 

 

SW-RPA recommended that Pele increase the density of drilling using a maximum 200 m by 
200 m hole spacing which was chosen as sufficient to increase the confidence level of the 
mineral resources and allow Inferred Resources to be converted to Indicated Resources, and 
thus able to support a feasibility study. 
 
Based on recommendations from SW-RPA, Pele completed follow-up drilling during late 
2007 and early 2008 which expanded a "higher grading" zone within the deposit.  Pele's press 
release on the subject dated 25 January 2008 reported uranium grades ranging from 0.034% 
U3O8 (0.68 lbs U3O8/ton) over an estimated true width of 2.20 m to a high of 0.080% U3O8 
(1.60 lbs U3O8/ton) over an estimated true width of 2.66 m.  The two widest intersections 



 

 - 96 - 

were both estimated at 2.92 m true thickness and these had uranium oxide contents of 0.060% 
and 0.070%, respectively (1.20 and 1.40 lbs U3O8/ton).  In the same press release, Pele up-
dated its Elliot Lake uranium resources to 6.3 Mt of Indicated Resources averaging 0.051% 
U3O8 and 41.0 Mt of Inferred Resources averaging 0.044% U3O8 for a total contained 
resource of "42 million pounds of NI 43-101 compliant U3O8 resources".  WGM cautions that 
the adding of inferred and indicated resources is not allowed under NI 43-101 rules and CIM 
Standards and Guidelines, nevertheless the numbers do show the magnitude of the potential 
resources on the Pele's Elliot Lake claims.  An additional press release on 6 March, 2008 
showed additional intersections having the same tenor of mineralization as those holes 
released previously. 
 
On 1 May 2008, Pele announced that it would initiate a preliminary feasibility study based on 
the positive results of its scoping study.  A subsequent MD&A document completed on 27 
May 2008 and filed on SEDAR, provides a summary of the SW-RPA scoping study and 
reiterates that the sufficient resources were found to support an 18-year mine life producing 
826,000 lbs of U3O8 per year at a cash operating cost of US $55.51 per pound. 
 
Pele initiated site characterization studies base line environmental studies in preparation for 
undertaking a Environmental Impact Assessment.  Discussions centering on advancing the 
project towards development are on-going with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, the 
town of Elliot Lake and Serpent River First Nation representatives. 
 
On 9 September, 2008 Pele announced that it had submitted the project description for its now 
named Eco Ridge Mine at Elliot Lake to the federal government's major projects management 
office and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). This move initiated the official 
permitting process for Pele's planned uranium mine and processing facility to be located near 
Elliot Lake.  Pele plans for mining, processing and waste management to make innovative use 
of proven technologies to build a new facility that will be significantly more advanced and 
environmentally-friendly than historic operations in the Elliot Lake region.  Mining will be 
accomplished using ramps from surface, trackless development and long-hole slashing.  
Underground leach cells and surface heap leach cells will be designed to fully contain the 
leach solutions and to allow for progressive decommissioning.  The news release states that 
no tailings pond will be required at the Eco Ridge Mine.  The project description provided 
target dates for completion of the licensing and permitting activities by year-end 2010, the 
beginning of construction in early-2011 and the commencement of uranium production in 
late-2012.

A follow-up press release on October 28, 2008, announced measures in response to market 
conditions, including postponement of the pre-feasibility study and certain components of the 
permitting process.  Pele proposed underground uranium mining with uranium processing 
through a combination of underground bioleaching and surface heap leach extraction at the 
Eco Ridge Project.  Under Pele's plan, approximately 35% of mined ore would be trucked to 
surface for heap leaching. 
 
A Pele new release dated 27 July, 2009 refers to the project containing "a NI 43-101 
compliant resource of 6.4 million pounds of "indicated" U3O8 (5.68 million tonnes grading 
0.051-percent U3O8) and 36.1 million pounds of "inferred" U3O8 (37.26 tonnes grading 0.044-
percent U3O8) with the potential for significant expansion."  These grades are equivalent to 
1.02 lbs U3O8 per ton in the Indicated Resources class and 0.88 lbs U3O8 per ton in the 
Inferred Resources class. 
 
During July, 2009, FCU signed an agreement with the City of Elliot Lake in respect to the 
purchase of the surface rights to a key group of 48 patented mining claims (796 ha) that are 
part of the Eco Ridge Project.  The surface rights covered by the Lease include areas planned 
for mine portals and other surface plant, equipment and related infrastructure. 
 
On 7 October, 2009 Pele announced new Rare Earth Element ("REE") analytical data from 
selected drill intersections confirming widespread REE mineralization with the uranium at its 
Eco Ridge Mine uranium project.  As is known from historical records, the Elliot Lake mines 
were historical producers of significant amounts of yttrium as a by-product of uranium 
production.  The mineralization was prevalent within the uranium-bearing conglomerates.  
The average leach extraction of heavy REEs plus yttrium averaged 64%, and Pele concluded 
that these are sufficiently recoverable to add to the economic value of the uranium resources.   
 
This Eco Ridge resource estimate was up-dated in a report dated 5 April, 2011 by RPA, 
formerly known as SW-RPA, that the deposit contained Indicated Resources of 14.31 Mt 
grading 0.048% U3O8 (0.96 lbs U3O8 per ton) and 0.164% total rare earth elements ("REE"s) 
or 3.28 lbs/ton with additional Inferred Resources of 33.12 Mt grading 0.043% U3O8 (0.86 lbs 
U3O8 per ton) and 0.132% total REEs or 2.64 lbs/ton (Ciuculescu, 2011).  The total contained 
metal was 15.2  million pounds of U3O8 and 51.9 Mlbs of REEs in the Indicated category and 
31.4 Mlbs of U3O8 and 96.4 Mlbs of REEs in the Inferred category.  The resources were 
based on a cut-off grade of 0.028% U3O8 and a long term uranium price of $60 per pound of 
uranium oxide (the current price is stable at $68). 



 

 - 99 - 

In July, 2011, Pele announced the results of a new Preliminary Assessment for the Eco Ridge 
Project, including these key findings based on a 9,400-tonne/day operation with 14-year life-
of-mine production of 10.7 Mlbs of total rare earth oxides (REOs) and 24.9 Mlbs of U3O8: 

• cumulative operating cash flow of US$1.72-billion 

• cumulative pre-tax cash flow of US$1.31-billion 

• operating cash cost of US $16 per pound U3O8, net of REO credits 

• start-up capital costs of US $212 M and sustaining capital costs of US $195 M. 

• positive NPV of $533 million (at a 10% discount rate) 

• internal rate of return (IRR) of 47 percent (47%) 
 
On the basis of the foregoing analysis, there is no question that with the right market 
fundamentals, the remaining uranium-REE deposits in the Elliot Lake basin represent a viable 
long-term resource that can be extracted with a very robust rate of return on investment. 
 
Since the PEA, Pele's continued drilling of its Eco Ridge project has yielded results that the 
company views as positive.  On 10 June, 2013, Pele announced an 11% increase in the 
Indicated Resources at Eco Ridge to 22.7 Mt at an average grade of 0.045% U3O8 (0.90 lbs 
U3O8/ton) and 1,606 ppm total REOs (Table 16).  The amount of contained metal increased 
10% to 22.65 Mlbs of U3O8 and 80.5 Mlbs of REOs.  Most of Pele's drilling was done to 
enlarge the area of known mineralization and was insufficient to classify this mineralization 
as Indicated.  Nevertheless, the mineralization classified as Inferred Resources increased 
116% increase to a total of 36.6 Mt at an average grade of 0.047% U3O8 (0.94 lbs U3O8/ton) 
and 1,554 ppm total REOs.  The amount of contained metal in the Inferred Resources 
increased to 37.6 Mlbs of U3O8 and 125.3 Mlbs of REOs.  Pele announced that expanded 
higher-grading zones had been identified and that its previous PEA had shown that these 
would positively impact project economics in the early production life of the project.  Pele 
also identified scandium as a potential high-value by-product of uranium and REE mining.

15.  MINING 
 
15.1  OVERVIEW OF ELLIOT LAKE REGIONAL OPERATIONS 
 
No uranium mines are presently active in the Elliot Lake area. 
 
Further to the east, Prophecy Platinum Corp. ("Prophecy") owns the Shakespeare Nickel 
Mine, formerly discovered and operated by Ursa Major Minerals with which Prophecy 
amalgamated in 2012.  Open pit mining of the West Zone was suspended during February, 
2012 when the company failed to secure an agreement with Xstrata Nickel for processing of 
Shakespeare ore at its Strathcona Mill located at Sudbury.  Prophecy announced a new 
resource estimate on 12 September, 2012 whereby the underground-minable East Zone 
deposit contained an Indicated Resource of 3.57 Mt averaging 0.32% Ni, 0.39% Cu, 0.02% 
Co, 0.34 g Pt/t, 0.37g Pd/t and 0.20 g Au/t.  The deposit also contained an Inferred Resource 
of 1.87 Mt averaging 0.32% Ni, 0.36% Cu, 0.02% Co, 0.34 g Pt/t, 0.36g Pd/t and 0.21 g Au/t.  
The resources were estimated using a $50/tonne NSR cut-off.  The mine is located very near 
the former Agnew Lake uranium mine, and about 70 km west of Sudbury, Ontario. 
 
 
15.2  FUTURE OPERATIONS ON THE APPIA PROPERTY 
 
Although it is premature to speculate concerning future mine development on the Appia 
claims, it is certain that any potential mine development would be as an underground 
operation.  The history of mine development in the Elliot Lake camp strongly suggests that 
the mining method would be room and pillar, or some modified version of this method.  With 
the recent recognition of significant rare earth mineralization in the Upper Reef, Appia is 
considering several possible mining scenarios including: 

• mining and processing the uranium-rich Lower Reef alone; 

• mining the REE-enriched Upper Reef, extracting the Intermediate Quartzite to be used 
as back-fill and then mining the Lower Reef for its uranium; and, 

• mining and processing the Upper and Lower Reefs simultaneously with the 
Intermediate Quartzite as a single unit to permit the use of larger equipment and thus 
achieve the maximum cost-reductions that the greater back height and scale offers. 

  
No certain decisions have been made in this regard as of the date of this report.

16.  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
16.1  BACKGROUND 
 
Uranium production in the Elliot Lake area commenced in 1955 and by 1959 there were 11 
mines with associated processing plants.  The process used at all mills comprised crushing; 
grinding; high-temperature, high acid, high-density leaching; liquid-solid separation; and ion 
exchange for uranium recovery.  Thorium recovery was started in one plant in 1959 and rare 
earth recovery was started in 1965. 
 
Until recently, no substantive metallurgical research on mineral processing to determine 
uranium recovery parameters has been carried out since the last of the Elliot Lake mines 
closed in 1996.  Notwithstanding this fact, the efficient recovery of uranium was well 
established at the time of closure.  Over the many years that the mines operated, uranium 
recoveries averaged approximately 95% even while head grades declined from 2-3 lbs 
U3O8/ton (1-1.5 kg U3O8/tonne) to 1.6 lbs U3O8/ton (0.8 kg U3O8/tonne).  Recoveries were 
certainly assisted by the occurrence of the economic minerals as discrete well-liberated 
subhedral-to-euhedral grains, although some uraninite grains were intergrown with U-Th 
silicates that leached well under the conditions employed. 
 
Denison Mines was the first to apply bio-leaching, a relatively new technology in 1987 when 
it was introduced.  That year the mine recovered 840,000 lbs (380,952 kg) of U3O8 by in-
stope bacterial leaching (tonnage under leach not reported).  Recoveries were facilitated by 
the simple mineralogy of the ores:  brannerite (UxTh1−xTi2O6), uraninite (UO2) and minor low-
uranium monazite ([U,REE]PO4).  Coffinite ([U,Th]SiO4) and uranothorite ([Th,U]SiO4), 
though present, are less important ore minerals.  Both brannerite and uraninite are high-
uranium minerals in their pure uranium end-members, the former containing 62.8% UO2 and 
the latter being pure uranium oxide less any daughter products.  Data presented by Robertson 
(1981) shows that the U:Th ratio in Blind River uraninites varied from 12.6:1 in some Panel 
Mine ores to as low as 5.4:1 in some Denison Mine ores with a regional average being 10:1. 
 
Although uranium recovery is not metallurgically complex compared to many other mineral 
commodities, it does require robust leaching conditions for the Elliot Lake ores.  Ifill et al 
(1989) demonstrates that a uranothorite grain subjected to harsh leaching conditions dissolved 
within 0.5 hr, and that elevated temperatures and greater acid content lead to rapid dissolution 
of uranothorite.

16.2  PREVIOUS APPIA STUDIES 
 
During early 2011, Appia selected 3 core samples of uranium-bearing quartz-pebble 
conglomerate (57729, 57741 and 57757) for QEMSCAN® analysis at the SGS-Lakefield 
metallurgical testing facility located in Lakefield, Ontario, Canada.  The results of the 
research are summarized in a SGS report dated 22 June, 2011. 
 
SGS describes QEMSCAN as "an acronym for Quantitative Evaluation of Materials by 
Scanning Electron Microscopy, a system which differs from image analysis systems in that it 
is configured to measure mineralogical variability based on chemistry at the micrometer-
scale. QEMSCANTM utilizes both the back-scattered electron (BSE) signal intensity as well 
as an Energy Dispersive X-ray Signal (EDS) at each measurement point. It thus makes no 
simplifications or assumptions of homogeneity based on the BSE intensity, as many mineral 
phases show BSE overlap. EDS signals are used to assign mineral identities to each 
measurement point by comparing the EDS spectrum against a mineral species identification 
program (SIP) or database." 
 
The results from whole rock (major element/oxide) analysis by XRD and trace element 
analysis by ICP is found in the report by SGS dated 22 June, 2011.  Selected analytical and 
mineralogical data from the samples is summarized as follows in Tables 17 and 18.

The SGS QEMSCAN®™ of the samples (nominal pixel resolution of 1-2 µm) clearly 
demonstrated that the non-quartz fraction is almost entirely restricted to the matrix between 
quartz pebbles.  Potassium feldspar was also found to be a major component in the matrix, 
occurring as sub-rounded grains up to 4,000 µm in size, some containing inclusions of 



 

- 103 - 

muscovite.  Muscovite grains less than 100 µm in size typically dot the rims of quartz 
pebbles.  Calcite, though rare, appears as essentially inclusion-free veinlets up to 1 mm in 
thickness.  Some of the thicker calcite veins carry very fine (<200 µm) inclusions of pyrite 
and plagioclase.  
 
Six polished thin sections were prepared from the three core samples.  The qualitative X-Ray 
diffraction results shown in Table 18 were derived by SGS-Lakefield using a Bruker D8 
Advance Diffractometer, and indicate that for the three samples tested the major mineral was 
quartz.  Minor mineral assemblages included K-feldspar-pyrite-mica, pyrite-calcite-K-
feldspar and pyrite-K-feldspar.  In all samples, mica was present in very low or trace amounts 
(Yeung and Zhou, 2011).  The X-ray diffraction data did not indicate any unusual 
compositions to the major and minor minerals, however the data did not include useful 
information on uranium, REEs, or thorium which are present at the ppm level.

All values are in per cent.  Qtz = quartz; Kspar = K-Feldspar; Musc = muscovite; Ca = calcite;  Py = pyrite;  
Mon = monazite; Syn = synchysite; Bas = bastnasite; Th = thorite; Z = zircon; Ap = apatite; Col = columbite 

 
 
Initial probe work indicates that grains have an a mean particle size ranging between 65 and 
120 µm.  Bastnasite and synchysite are significantly finer at 22-28 µm and 23-31 µm, 
respectively.  Other unnamed REE minerals are also quite fine at 22-24 µm.  U-Th minerals 
showed a mean grain size of about 60 µm. 
 
Metallic mineral grains are not uniformly distributed in the matrix.  Pyrite, Fe (+/- Ti) oxides, 
monazite, pyrochlore, REE minerals, apatite and zircon typically occur as enriched bands 
crossing the matrix except where disrupted by larger quartz pebbles.  This has the appearance 
of micro-bedding or mm-scale sorting of the heavy mineral fractions (Plate 12).  This aspect 



 

- 104 - 

of heavy mineral distribution is better evidenced in some sample sections than in others, 
especially those scan images in which grain size is less than 3 mm.  In scan images, calcite 
and mica have the appearance of being a late veining stage as evidenced by it occurring along 
fractures both in the matrix and within quartz pebbles. 
 
A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with X-ray Energy Dispersive 
Spectrometer was used to acquire back scattered electron images and semi-quantitative 
analyses.  Initial SEM data indicated that monazite is the main REE carrier followed by 
bastnasite/synchysite/parisite.  REE phases include monazite (Ce,La,Nd,Th)PO4 and fluoro-
carbonates including bastnäsite, bastnäsite-(Ce) with a formula of (Ce,La,Nd)CO3F, and 
calcium fluoro-carbonates Ca(Ce,La)2(CO3)3F2 and synchysite Ca(Ce,La,Nd)(CO3)2F.  
Uranium and thorium are likely present as thorite and uraninite, uranothorite, thorite and 
coffinite although these mineral names are based on semi-quantitative SEM-EDS analyses.  
Uranium and thorium minerals occur together and are difficult to resolve at the 15 µm 
resolution of the probe.  Taking as an example sample 57729-1, SGS summarized the 
mineralization as: 

• "Pyrite is significant in the sample, generally fine-grained, <50 µm to 0.5 mm, with 
aggregates up to 1 mm, but generally ~0.3 mm in size.  It is well-formed and 
crystalline and is present as subhedral, angular grains, and locally forms aggregates.  It 
is generally disseminated in the sample and interstitial to the main silicates. It hosts 
rare chalcopyrite inclusions of <50 µm. 

• Monazite mineralization (1%) is characterized by fine-grained particles and is strongly 
associated with pyrite.  Monazite is up to 0.3 mm in size and is subhedral to 
subrounded in habit.  It has a cloudy appearance under the optical microscope that is 
attributed to the fine-grained thorite inclusions.  It carries mainly cerium, and less 
lanthanum and neodymium. 

• Thorite is tentatively identified and may carry significant uranium.  It ranges from 
5 µm to 30 µm in size, as angular and sub-rounded inclusions in monazite, but also 
forms distinct grains up to 0.3 mm in size. It is also associated with pyrite 
mineralization, and occurs interstitial to silicates and as attachments on monazite. 

• Uranium minerals occur as either coffinite/uraninite or uranothorite. They occur as 
5 µm to 70 µm, sub-rounded and anhedral shaped grains having a heterogeneous 
textural and chemical nature.  They are locally complexly intergrown with silicates 
and pyrite.  They form micrometric rims around pyrite and inclusions close to the edge 
of pyrite.  They are also observed in close association with monazite and thorite."

SGS concluded that the REE-U-Th mineralization is of a disseminated type, and it is strongly 
associated with pyrite.  The metallic minerals are generally interstitial to the main silicates, 
and rarely do these minerals occur as inclusions in silicates, e.g., quartz.    SGS concluded that 
the distribution related to the original bedding in the rocks, a view shared by WGM.  SGS 
speculated that these features would allow good liberation of the metallic minerals 
collectively during mineral processing.

SGS underscores the close association between urano-thorium and REE minerals with pyrite, 
however some SEM images show more than an association; Plate 13 shows a U-Th phase 
clearly replacing pyrite.

quartz groundmass (area 1) – study site 4 in sample # 57741A – from SGS, June 2011. 

 
 
The QEMSCAN data (Table 19) show that sample #57757 contains significantly less 
uranium, thorium and REEs than the other two samples which carry in excess of 0.1% U and 
0.6% REEs. SGS concluded that cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, uranium and thorium 
contents were significantly elevated in samples #57729 and #57741 and enrichment was also 
present in yttrium, samarium and praseodymium.  Monazite and fluoro-carbonates were found 
to account for most of the LREE.  Yttrium was frequently identified in uranium and thorium 
minerals.  SGS recommended that electron microprobe analyses be carried out to determine 
the distribution of the REE within the minerals identified.  Monazite is the primary REE 
phase. Bastnasite, synchysite and parisite are also present in trace amounts and carry a 
proportion of the LREE.  Monazite also hosts a number of micrometric thorite inclusions.  



 

- 107 - 

Thorite is the principle Th-mineral.  Uranium is predominantly present as coffinite/uraninite 
and uranothorite.

The commercial viability of REE mineralization was previously demonstrated by the 
historical recovery of yttrium as a by-product of uranium production at the Elliot Lake mines.  
These operations proved that separate facilities were not required to leach the REEs.  Yttrium 
was well leached during the normal uranium dissolution process and that, once in solution, 
yttrium could be recovered.  However the mine operators ignored the other REEs because the 
market was adequately served by deposits elsewhere and because they were not effectively 
dissolved under normal uranium leaching conditions.  At present, Appia plans to produce a 
high-value REE-uranium concentrate through beneficiation of the ore.  Appia future 
production plans will be determined by market conditions at that time, but will likely focus on 
either extracting the metals from solution as uranium oxide and as combined REE-oxides 
known as mischmetal, or producing a U-REE concentrate for sale.  Appia's assay data 
indicates that the value of the REEs present will largely vest in cerium, lanthanum, 
neodymium and yttrium which account for 86.3% of the total REEs present.

16.3  CURRENT TESTING 
 
16.3.1 Introduction 
 
Based on the historical production of yttrium as a by-product of uranium mining in the Blind 
River area, Appia recognized the potential of the Elliot Lake uranium ores to contain 
significant amounts of rare earth metals.  At the time Appia's project commenced, limited 
data was available documenting the presence of REEs in the Elliot Lake ores even though 
petrographers had recognized the presence of monazite.  Although monazite is commonly 
enriched in REEs, it was consistently referred to, if at all, as a "uranium ore mineral" and no 
mention was made of its REE potential even though yttrium was being recovered as a co-
product with uranium (Thomson, 1960, Robertson, 1968, Robertson, 1976).  It was not until 
2007-08 when Appia drilled the Teasdale and Banana Lake uranium zones and analyzed the 
drill core that quantitative evidence was obtained showing the presence of economically 
significant REE mineralization in the stratabound, 3.2 m thick Lower Reef ("LR") horizon.  
Appia's exploration also led to the recognition of a second overlying horizon, the 3.95 m 
thick Upper Reef ("UR"), that contained significantly higher REE contents, although a 
somewhat lower average uranium content.  The UR and LR are separated by the more weakly 
mineralized Intermediate Quartzite averaging 2.65 m in thickness. 
 
Rather than mining only the LR as had been done in the past, Appia recognized the cost-
saving potential of bulk mining the entire LR-IQ-UR assemblage and the economic benefit of 
recovering REEs as well as uranium.  At the end of its most recent drilling in the latter half of 
2012, Appia concluded that it had sufficient evidence of widespread REE-U mineralization 
and sufficient sample media to commence a meaningful metallurgical testing program to 
investigate processing options for the recovery of REEs and uranium. 
  
Following a competition between laboratories, WGM and Appia selected SGS Minerals 
Services, Lakefield Site ("SGS") to undertake beneficiation and hydrometallurgical testwork 
under WGM supervision and managed by Senior Associate Metallurgist, John Goode, P.Eng.  
Drill core was quarter-cut and dispatched in secure containers from Elliot Lake to SGS where 
it was crushed and composited prior to testwork.  The testing program was designed by Mr. 
Goode in consultation with SGS personnel as follows: (1) mineralogical work was conducted 
by Tomas Hrstka and Tassos Grammatikopoulos; (2) beneficiation work was carried out 
under the supervision of Feng Gao, Ben Yu, Yashashree Chaugule, Jason Garbutt, and Dan 
Lang;  (3) hydrometallurgical work was supervised by James Brown, Michael Archer and

Krystal Davis; and (4) reports were prepared by Su McKenzie.  The final SGS report is 
appended to this report. 
 
16.3.2 Samples 
 
Appia and WGM selected drill core to represent the UR, IQ and LR material.  Remaining half 
core was sawed into quarter core that was shipped to SGS who prepared metallurgical 
composites of each material type as well as a Master Composite containing appropriate 
portions of the three individual composites.  Analyses for the four composites are presented in 
Table 20.

16.3.3 Mineralogy 
 
SGS completed mineralogical examination of the three composites using X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), QEMSCAN, Electron Microprobe Analysis (EMPA), Scanning Electron Microscopy 
(SEM) and chemical analysis.  XRD and QEMSCAN showed that all three samples contained 
about 66% quartz (SiO2) obviously from the quartz pebbles of the conglomerate.  Samples 
also contained approximately 15% potassium-feldspar (KAlSi3O8), and pyrite (FeS2) 
amounting to 10%, 4.1%, and 2.6% respectively for the LR, UR, and IQ composites 



 

- 110 - 

respectively.  The samples also contained minor graphite and about 10% mica 
(K(Mg,Fe)3Si3AlO10(OH)2). 
 
The distribution of the minerals containing U, Th, and the REE are indicated in Figure 14. 
 

 
Figure 14:  Distribution of U, Th and REE minerals in Appia samples 

 
 
Brannerite is often mentioned as being an important component of Elliot Lake ore.  
QEMSCAN did not indicate the presence of brannerite, but it was tentatively identified during 
the SEM examination of the samples as either micrometric inclusions in various minerals and 
local alteration of the U-Th phases. 
 
QEMSCAN demonstrated that the mean grain size of the minerals of interest were below 20 
µm in all three composites. 
 
EMPA work showed that approximately 70% of the Y was contained in U-Th minerals with 
the balance in monazite.  This distribution agrees well with the historical U and Y leach 
recovery values for Elliot Lake ore.  
 



 

- 111 - 

16.3.4 Beneficiation 
 
Prior metallurgical data from the Elliot Lake camp, initial hydrometallurgical testwork on 
Appia samples, and simple economic analyses showed that leaching of whole ore would 
provide for good recovery of uranium, reasonable recovery of yttrium but poor recovery of 
the other REEs.  In contrast, concentration of the more refractory REE minerals would allow 
their intensive hydrometallurgical processing and the possibility for high recoveries of all 
REEs.  Leaching of uranium from flotation tailings was shown to be simple and effective.  
Hence SGS was directed in a program aimed primarily at concentrating the REE minerals 
followed by the recovery of pay elements from the concentrate and tailings.  Preliminary cost 
estimates showed that high REE recovery to a concentrate of about 10% mass could be 
effective. 
 
Earlier literature on the beneficiation of Elliot Lake ore showed that ore sorting and dense 
media separation could be effective but would not be able to produce the degree of up-grading 
needed (Grimes, 1973).  These methods were therefore not examined in the preliminary work 
program but could be looked at in the future. 
 
 
Grinding Work Index 
 
A standard Bond ball mill work index measurement was made using a 150 µm closing screen  
A metric value of 16.2 was determined. 
 
 
Gravity concentration 
 
SGS undertook gravity separation tests on the Master Composite using a Mozley Mineral 
Separator at grind sizes of 80% passing 208 µm and 80% passing 108 µm.  SGS also 
completed a Wilfley table test starting with material ground to 100% passing 850 µm with the 
tails ground to -500 µm, re-tabled, tails re-ground to -106 µm and re-tabled.  Summary results 
are provided in Table 21.

approximately 2,000 G (Gauss), 5,000 G, 10,000 G, and 17,000 G on samples of Master 
Composite ground to 80% passing 208 µm and 108 µm.  Results are summarized in Table 22.

Froth Flotation 
 
SGS completed 20 batch flotation tests on the Master, UR, IQ, and LR Composites.  The 
collector that was generally used was LR19 which is a blended reagent developed by 
Lakefield Research for the flotation of Elliot Lake ores in the 1960s (Grimes, 1973) and 
comprising 62% FA2 (a fatty acid), 27% Cytec Aero 855 (a petroleum sulphonate), 9% 
kerosene, and 2% MIBC.  Other collectors that were investigated were cupferron and FS-2 
(Muthuswami et al, 1983) and salicylhydroximate provided by the Tieling Flotation Reagents 
Factory, Liaoning, China. 
 
Tests with LR19 were shown to be substantially superior to all other reagents when applied to 
Appia Master Composite.  Figure 15 summarizes data for flotation test F6 which comprised 
rougher flotation and cleaning stages and was done after stage grinding to 80% passing 135 
µm.  Test F7 done after grinding to 80% passing 80 µm gave identical recovery values.  
Reagent additions were a nominal 1.5 kg/t of LR19 and 1 kg/t of PQ Metso sodium 
metasilicate. 
 

 
Figure 15:  Flotation of Appia ore using LR19 collector 

 
 
Figure 15 also shows very high recovery of pyrite and reasonably effective recovery of the 
LREE at low mass pulls with the HREE and U recovery lagging behind. As discussed later, 



 

- 114 - 

the lower U and HREE recoveries are not a major concern if the flotation tailings are leached 
since uranium and HREE dissolution in a tailings leach are reasonably high. 
 
The LREE and HREE recovery results for a successful beneficiation test (F6) are plotted 
together in Figure 16.  The figure shows that froth flotation performed significantly better at 
recovering the LREE-bearing minerals which are those requiring an aggressive cracking 
process.  WHIMS performed somewhat better than flotation in recovering the HREE-bearing 
minerals however that is not too critical given that a tailings leach is reasonably effective at 
recovering HREE.  There may be a case for a hybrid circuit involving flotation and WHIMS 
or gravity concentration and such possibilities might be investigated at later stages of the 
project development.

Whole Ore Leaching 
 
Two whole ore leach tests were conducted on ore ground to 80% passing 212 µm (test AL-1) 
and 75 µm (test AL-2).  In both cases the leach was performed at 800 C with 50 g/L free acid 
and over 72 h with kinetic sampling.  The results for AL-2 are plotted in Figure 17.

The performance of the LREE in test AL-2 (and other tests) indicates LREE precipitation 
with time.  A possible mechanism is the formation of insoluble LREE double sulphates 
caused by the entry of K and Na into the system by the dissolution of K-feldspar and other 
minerals.  K+Na assays in test AL-2 were 1.3 g/L at the 12 h mark (>90% K, balance Na) and 
increased to 2.3, 3.3, and 4.1 g/L respectively in the 24, 48, and 72 h samples. 
 

 
  Figure 17:  Whole ore leach of Appia ore, 800 C, 50 g/L free acid 
 
 
Since U leaching seemed to be essentially complete after 48 h, such leach times, or shorter, 
would be appropriate for maximization of LREE recovery.  The acid demand for such leach 
times were 57 kg/t and 47 kg/t for the coarse and fine grinds respectively. 
 
 
Flotation Concentrate Leaching 
 
Several different methods of processing the flotation concentrate were investigated including 
simple atmospheric acid leaching, pressure oxidation in which the pyrite was oxidized to 
generate lixiviant solution and simultaneously promote metal dissolution, and sulphuric acid 
baking – a standard way of cracking monazite/bastnaesite minerals. 
 
Agitated Atmospheric Leaching  Flotation concentrate was subjected to a 48 hour long, 

50 g/L sulphuric acid leach procedure at 800 C with kinetic 
sampling.  Not too surprisingly, the U and REE extraction 



 

- 116 - 

data were very similar to those for the whole ore with 
about 30% extraction for La and Ce and about 80% for Y 
and related HREEs. 

 
Pug Leaching  In the 1970s, Rio Algom pilot tested the pug leaching of Elliot Lake ore 

and patented the process (Mather, 1978).  A sample of flotation 
concentrate was mixed as a paste with sulphuric acid and the resulting 
pellets held for 24 hours at a nominal 800 C with moist air passing 
through the pellet bed.  After 24 hours, the ore was slurried with water, 
filtered and the products assayed.  Data showed less than 30% U 
extraction, very low LREE extraction and about 30% HREE extraction. 

 
Pressure Oxidation SGS was instructed to perform a single pressure oxidation (POX) test 

on a flotation concentrate containing 814 g/t of U, 5,877 g/t of TREE, 
and 9.2%S. Test conditions included pre-acidification to pH 1.8 (39 kg/t 
acid added), a temperature of 2100 C and an oxygen overpressure of 
689 kPa (100 psi).  The test was extended over four hours although full 
oxidation of pyrite and uranium extraction was expected in a shorter 
period of time.  It was speculated that some cracking of refractory REE 
minerals might also occur given adequate time. 

 
 In this test, 88% of the S was oxidized, 98% of the U solubilized, along 

with 28% of the TREEs, and 71% of the HREEs.  Y extraction was 
80% reflecting the close association between U mineralization and Y.  
Clearly monazite was not cracked during the POX operation. 

 
Acid Baking   Several acid bake tests were performed on various Appia flotation 

concentrates.  Initial tests indicated that a temperature of 2000 C and an 
acid addition of 1 t/t concentrate, and a 3 hour retention time was 
satisfactory with an acid consumption of 0.3 t/t, U extraction of 98%, 
HREE extraction of 90%, and LREE extraction increasing from 60% 
for La to 90% for Sm. 

  
 A pre-leach and acid bake process, simulating a counter-current leach 

system, was executed in tests AL-7 and AB-6 on a concentrate assaying 
780 g/t U and 13,636 g/t TREE obtained from a flotation process (tests 
F19, F20, and F21) which yielded 10.6% concentrate mass containing 
92% of the S, 31% of the U, 79% of the LREE and 50% of the HREE – 
somewhat inferior results to those of test F6. 

  
 The pre-leach required 105 kg/t of acid.  The acid bake on the pre-leach 

residue was done with a 600 kg/t acid addition and at a temperature of 
2500 C for 3 hours. The subsequent water leach contained 130 kg/t of 
free acid which would, in a counter-current system, be more than 
sufficient for the pre-leach meaning that the fresh acid demand for the 
pre-leach and bake system is about 600 kg/t of concentrate. 



 

- 117 - 

 
 Metal extraction in the AL-7/AB-6 pre-leach and acid bake tests were 

quite satisfactory as illustrated in Figure 18. 
 

 
Figure 18:  Extraction by acid bake of flotation concentrate and atmospheric leach of tails 

 
 
Flotation Tailings Leaching 
 
Samples of the flotation tailings corresponding to the concentrate used in the AL-7/AB-6 pre-
leach and acid bake test were leached for 24 hours at both room temperature and 500 C in 
dilute sulphuric acid in tests AL-9 and AL-10.  The data showed that in both cases metal 
extraction was substantially complete after just 12 hours.  Acid demand was about 27 kg/t.  
The higher temperature leach offered 5% better U extraction and an average of 9% greater 
REE extraction and so that system was selected.  Data are plotted in Figure 18 alongside the 
extraction data for the concentrate acid bake.  
 
 
16.3.6 Solution / Slurry recovery Options and test Results 
 
In the 1950s and on, efficient U recovery from Elliot Lake leach slurry was readily done using 
partial neutralization, liquid solid separation ("LSS"), clarification, and strong base ion 
exchange ("IX") for U extraction.  REE were recovered from the IX barren using solvent 



 

- 118 - 

extraction ("SX") with di-2-ethyl hexyl phosphoric acid ("DEHPA") either directly or after 
partial removal of ferric iron and thorium by precipitation. 
 
A modern approach to U and REE recovery might include LSS followed by SX for U using a 
tertiary amine, raffinate solution adjustment, followed by SX for REE using DEHPA or a 
modern substitute.  An alternative approach, offering substantial capital cost savings, would 
be to dispense with LSS and simply use resin-in-pulp ("RIP") for U as was practiced at many 
earlier plants, is presently used by Paladin Energy (Hladun, 2010), and analyzed and 
advocated by others (Goode and Brown, 2010).  However, to completely eliminate LSS also 
requires the use of RIP for REE recovery. 
 
Limited testwork was done on post-leach metal recovery.  The work showed that 
neutralization of a clear solution to a pH of 3.5 using MgO would precipitate ferric iron and 
more than 70% of the Th without significant loss of U or REE.  The same procedure using 
finely ground CaCO3 was far less effective in that although similar levels of ferric iron and Th 
elimination were obtained, REE losses were significant at pH 2 and were unacceptable by the 
time pH 3.5 was reached.  Limestone precipitation from a slurry, rather than a clear solution 
could be more effective and will be tested in future work. 
 
A limited amount of IX testwork was done in which a pregnant solution was treated by strong 
base IX for U recovery and the barren then treated with Lewatit OC 1026 resin for REE 
adsorption.  This macroporous resin has DEHPA incorporated in the resin and so a RIP 
system analogous to the earlier SX systems could be possible.  HREE extraction was high but 
LREE extraction was low and further work is indicated. 
 
Another option, which was not tested, is the simultaneous extraction of U and the REE by a 
suitable solvent or resin followed by selective stripping/elution or other means of separately 
recovering the two products.  Further testwork is needed to examine this option and other 
aspects of U and REE extraction options – both from clear solution using SX and from slurry 
using RIP. 
 
 
16.3.7 Flowsheet Options and Overall Recovery 
 
The main flowsheet options available are: 

• a simple grind and leach of the Teasdale ore followed by either LSS and SX or RIP for 
U and REE recovery from solution – sequentially or simultaneously 



 

- 119 - 

• a flotation  process to recover a high grade concentrate, acid baking of the concentrate 
and acid leaching of the flotation tailings.  This option could be detailed in several 
ways as follows: 

o separate LSS operations on the acid bake residue and leached tailings and 
inter-linked SX circuits for U and REE recovery in which weakly loaded 
extractant from the tailings circuit is passed on to the higher grade concentrate 
circuit  

o separate inter-linked RIP circuits for the acid bake residue and tailings leach 
circuits 

o joining the concentrate leach and tailings leach pregnant slurries and 
recovering U and REE using either LSS and SX or RIP 

o a common U recovery circuit and separate recoveries of dominantly LREE and 
HREE products from the acid bake and tails leach circuits respectively  

 
The total recovery levels expected from a 36 h whole ore leach on finely ground ore (AL-2), 
allowing for 5% soluble loss of U and 10% loss of REE, are plotted in Figure 19. 
 
Experimental data for the flotation, acid bake, tailings leach circuit have been combined and 
are also presented in Figure 19 along with an estimate of the total overall recovery allowing 
for 5% soluble loss.

16.3.8 Conclusions 
 
Preliminary testwork and analysis indicates that a flotation-concentrate acid bake process 
route combined with a tailings leach can give high extraction of U and REE from Appia's 
Teasdale uranium – rare earth deposit.  It is believed that planned additional testwork and data 
analysis will lead to reduced costs and improved recovery. 
 
A very preliminary estimate of the capital and operating cost of three process options are 
presented in Table 23.  Costs are for the process plant only.

17.  MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
17.1  DEFINITIONS 
 
The classification of Mineral Resources used in this report conforms with the definitions 
provided in the final version of NI 43-101, which came into effect on February 1, 2001, as 
revised on April 8, 2011.  We further confirm that, in arriving at our classification, we have 
followed the guidelines adopted by the Council of the Canadian Institute of Mining 
Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM") Standards.  The relevant definitions for the CIM 
Standards/NI 43-101 are as follows: 
 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural, solid, 
inorganic or fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, 
and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of 
such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The 
location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral 
Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and 
knowledge.  
 
An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity 
and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and 
limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade 
continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered 
through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes. 
 
An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be 
estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application 
of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of 
the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced 
closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 
 
A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well 
established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the 
appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The 
estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to 
confirm both geological and grade continuity. 



 

- 122 - 

A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated 
Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This 
Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 
economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that 
economic extraction can be justified.  A Mineral Reserve includes diluting materials 
and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined. 
 
A Probable Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and 
in some circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a 
Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate information on 
mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. 
 
A Proven Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured 
Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This 
Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 
economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that 
economic extraction is justified.  
 
 

Mineral Resource classification is based on certainty and continuity of geology and grades.  In 
most deposits, there are areas where the uncertainty is greater than in others.  The majority of 
the time, this is directly related to the drilling density.  Areas more densely drilled are usually 
better known and understood than areas with sparser drilling. 
 
 
17.2  TEASDALE LAKE ZONE 
 
17.2.1   BACKGROUND 
 
WGM prepared an initial Mineral Resource estimate for the Teasdale Zone in 2008, and a 
subsequent update in 2011 (Workman and Breede).  Both reports also contain a discussion of 
a historical estimate made by Mr. Doug Sprague, P.Eng., the former Chief Geologist for Rio 
Algom Ltd. at Elliot Lake, and WGM's reported detailed audit of that estimate. 
 
17.2.2   2008 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
A historical resource estimate was prepared by Mr. Doug Sprague, P.Eng., former Chief 
Geologist for Rio Algom Ltd. at Elliot Lake (Sprague).  This estimate, totalling some 17.5 
million tons of uranium mineralization having an average grade of 1.21 lbs U3O8 per short 
ton, is herein described in this report under Section 5.3 Historical Reserves and Resources.  



 

- 123 - 

 
During 2008, WGM carried out a detailed audit of the Sprague resource estimate.  WGM's 
review was based on a combined database encompassing the original 16 historical drill holes 
plus six holes completed by Appia during its winter 2007-08 drilling program.  WGM 
concluded that a search radius of 89 metres (338 feet) and a cut-off grade of 0.65 lbs U3O8/ton 
would produce a resource estimate that approximated that of Mr. Sprague.  The result of 
WGM's audit was that the zone contained approximately 18.5 M tons grading 1.17 lbs 
U3O8/ton for a total of approximately 21.72 M lbs of contained U3O8.  WGM's search radius 
was comfortably within the 400 ft extrapolation distance used historically for reserve 
estimation at the operating mines at Elliot Lake.  WGM was essentially satisfied that the 
Sprague estimate was reasonable based on the information available. 
 
During 2008, WGM also completed an updated uranium resource estimate for the Teasdale 
Lake Zone that was reported in a technical report by Workman and Vasek (2008).  The 
resources were classified at a range of cut-off grades.  The data show that using a cut-off of 
0.60 lbs U3O8/ton results in an Indicated Mineral Resource of 17.4 million tons (15.8 Mt) with 
an average grade of 1.10 lbs U3O8/ton (0.55 kg U3O8/t) and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 
48 million tons (43.5 Mt) at the same grade.  At this cut-off grade, the uranium oxide 
contained in Indicated and Inferred resources was 19.0 Mlbs and 52.7 Mlbs, respectively.  
 
 
17.2.3   2011 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
The 2011 WGM Mineral Resource estimate took in both uranium and rare earth element 
mineralization and was based solely on the six holes previously completed by Appia.  This 
represented a subset of the total 22 holes drilled on the deposit to that point in time. Because 
only these six Appia holes were assayed for rare earths, the Mineral Resource estimate was 
restricted to the area of influence of this data and the historical drill holes were necessarily 
excluded. 
 
No per cent TREE cut-off was used for the reporting of resources, however implicitly there 
was an internal cut-off grade of about 0.05% TREE (i.e. the lowest grade interval included in 
the mineralized envelope at the hanging wall and footwall contacts).  The resource envelop 
was geologically constrained by the geological contacts of the zone as follows: 

• the upper surface of the stratigraphically highest U-bearing conglomerate (reef); and, 

• the under surface of the stratigraphically lowest U-bearing reef. 
 



 

- 124 - 

WGM imposed a 2.44-metre (8 ft) minimum thickness requirement on the Teasdale Zone 
which reflects historical mining practices in the Elliot Lake district.  All of the Appia drill 
hole intersections exceeded this thickness.  
 
 
17.2.4   2013 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
As with the 2011 estimate, the current Mineral Resource estimate takes in both uranium and 
rare earth element mineralization and is based on the previous six holes completed by Appia 
(holes Q-07-01 through Q-08-06 totalling 2,650.2 m), plus the additional 18 holes completed 
during the 2012 exploration program (holes AEC12-01 through AEC12-16 totalling 8,130.2 
m).  Only these collective 24 Appia holes were assayed for rare earths, hence the current 
Mineral Resource estimate has been restricted to the area of influence of this data, and the 
historical drill holes completed by Conecho and others have been necessarily excluded. 
 
The estimate was prepared from a polygonal model using a C$:US$ exchange rate of 1:1 and 
at a cut-off value of $100 per tonne, using a uranium price of US$70/lb U3O8, and a combined 
TREE price of $78/kg. The resource envelop was also geologically constrained by the 
geological contacts of the zone as follows: 

• the hanging wall or upper surface of the stratigraphically highest U-bearing 
conglomerate (Upper Reef or "UR"); and, 

• the foot wall or lower surface of the stratigraphically lowest U-bearing reef (Lower Reef 
or "LR"). 

 
WGM imposed a 2.44-metre (8 ft) minimum thickness requirement on the Teasdale Zone 
which reflects historical mining practices in the Elliot Lake district.  All of the Appia drill 
hole intersections exceeded this thickness.  Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources are 
reported in Tables 24  and 25 as follows:

Notes: Mineral Resources effective 30 July, 2013  
1. Mineral Resources are estimated at a cut-off value of $100 per tonne, using a uranium price of US$70/lb U3O8, a TREE 

price of $78/kg, and a C$:US$ exchange rate of 1:0.9. 
2. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The estimate of Mineral 

Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other 
relevant issues.  

3. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been 
insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource and it is 
uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource category. 

4. The Mineral Resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum standards on 
Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve 
Definitions and adopted by CIM Council December 11, 2005.  These definitions are provided in Section 17.1 of this report. 

5. S.G. of 2.85 tonnes/m3 (or 3.14 tons/m3) was used.         6.  Indicated amounts may not precisely sum due to rounding. 
 

The individual REEs included in the TREE mineral resources are reported as follows in

- 126 - 

Although Conecho's historical drilling of 19 holes during 1954-55 discovered economically 
interesting mineralization beyond the areas drilled by Appia, WGM's estimate does not make 
use of this information because of WGM inability to confirm the data, which is thought to be 
reliable, and data levelling issues principally concerning the lack of analytical data for REEs.  
For this reason, and the fact that the stratabound mineralization is not constrained by Appia's 
current drilling, additional future drilling is expected to enlarge the Mineral Resources 
reported herein which are defined by the drilling completed as of the date of this report.  
Although the amount and grade of additional resources cannot be stated with any confidence, 
most of these additional resources are expected to be of a grade similar to that intersected to 
date and are expected to be added through additional step-out drilling down dip on the 
Matinenda Formation. 
 
 
17.2.5   GENERAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION PROCEDURES 
 
The polygonal model Mineral Resource estimate procedure included: 

• importing/compiling and validation of data from Microsoft Excel to Gemcom GEMS 
v6.2.4 to create a Project database; 

• statistical analysis; 

• validation of geological model for use as resource envelope; 

• compositing assay intervals within the mineralized boundaries - limited to one composite 
per hole; 

• extruding polygons around each drill collar with a radius of 140 and 280 metres, and 
assigning thickness' equivalent to individual composite lengths; 

• reporting volumes and grade in each of the extruded polygons; and, 

• categorizing the Mineral Resources according to NI 43-101 and CIM definitions. 
 

WGM believes that its drill hole database is insufficient in size and number of samples to 
develop reliable variography data to guide the selection of a search ellipse for the Teasdale 
Deposit.  In selecting its maximum polygon size, however, the authors note that Pele 
disclosed several resource estimates for the Eco Ridge Deposit in which it most recently 
reports variogram ranges for U3O8, Nd and Dy of 375 m for the Main Conglomerate Bed and 
450 m for the Hanging Wall Zone.  The Pele resource estimate is classified according to a 
maximum search ellipse of 100 m for Indicated Resources (maximum drill hole spacing of 
200 m).  Inferred Resources were estimated with a maximum search ellipse of 300 m – the 
average hole spacing for Inferred Resources was 320 m for the Main Conglomerate Bed and 
510 m for the Hanging Wall Zone (Cox, Ciuculescu, Altman and Hwozdyk, 2012).   



 

- 127 - 

Historical mining practices demonstrated that a spacing of several hundred metres could be 
used to predict grade.  In light of the geological nature of the deposit, especially its great 
lateral continuity, a polygonal radius of 140 was used by WGM for defining the area of 
influence for Indicated Resources.   The Inferred Resources were calculated with a similarly 
defined maximum polygonal radius of 280 m.  We believe this approach to be balanced and 
conservative given the approach using a considerably larger database for the Eco Ridge 
estimate. 
 
17.2.6  DATABASE 
 
17.2.6.1 General 
 
The data used to generate the Mineral Resource estimates originated from original logs 
provided in Microsoft Word and PDF file format, as well as assay results in Excel format 
supplied by Appia, which WGM then consolidated into a single data source.  A GEMS 
project was established to hold all of the reformatted data to be used in the computations 
necessary for the Mineral Resource estimate. 
 
The Teasdale drill hole database consisted of the six 2011 Appia drill hole collar locations in 
the UTM co-ordinate system and geological descriptions (holes Q-07-01 to Q-07-3, and Q-
08-04 to Q-08-06), along with the eighteen 2012 drill holes numbered AEC12-01 through 16. 
The database consisted of key data such as drill hole collar, survey, assay, and lithological 
information as well as geological codes and 1573 assayed intervals containing values for 
TREE (%) and lbs U3O8/ton (and other elements including: Th (ppm), ThO2 (%), LREE (%), 
HREE (%), La (ppm), Ce (ppm), Nd (ppm), Gd (ppm), Y (ppm), Pr (ppm), Sm (ppm), Eu 
(ppm), Tb (ppm), Dy (ppm), Ho (ppm), Er (ppm), Tm (ppm), Yb (ppm), Lu (ppm), and Hf 
(ppm).  Assay intervals averaged 0.29 m in length, with the smallest interval measuring 0.03 
m and the largest measuring 0.62 m.  Lithological cross-sections of each of the drill holes 
were supplied in PDF format, as well as original digital assay certificates as supplied by 
Actlabs of Ancaster, Ontario. 
 
Like with the Banana Lake sampling previously report in workman and Breede (2011),, the 
distribution of assay intervals within the various rock type units favoured the thicker Upper 
Reef (497 samples) versus the somewhat thinner Lower Reef (347 samples) and the 
Intermediate Quartzite (236 samples).

17.2.6.2 Data Validation 
 
Upon receipt of the data, WGM performed the following validation steps: 

 checking for location and elevation discrepancies  by comparing collar coordinates with 
the copies of the original drill logs received from the site; 

 checking minimum and maximum values for each quality value field and 
confirming/modifying those outside of expected ranges; 

 checking for inconsistency in lithological unit terminology and/or gaps in the 
lithological code; 

 spot checking original assay certificates with information entered in the database; and, 
 checking for gaps, overlaps and out of sequence intervals for both assays and lithology 

tables. 

 
WGM found the database to be in good order and suitable for use in its subsequent Mineral 
Resource estimate.  Some gaps or missing intervals identified were due to unsampled and 
unassayed intervals outside of the mineralized zones.  Suspect data comprised erroneous 
survey data for holes AEC12-07 and AEC12-16, as well as manual data entry errors in the 
assay and lithological interval logs which WGM corrected by manually cross-checking the 
entered data against the original hand-written drill logs.  In the case of the survey data, it was 
revealed that in-field survey QA/QC protocols were not always followed, resulting in some 
poor-quality survey data11.  Consequently, the survey results used for the final interpretation 
were interpreted from the collar orientations, and selected down-hole survey readings.  The 
survey results that were not rational based on WGM's experience were ignored.  The degree 
of uncertainty surrounding the geometry of these two holes, particularly AEC12-16, 
necessarily resulted in a downgrade of mineral resource categorization, as described later in 
this section.  
 
17.2.6.1 Database Management 
 
The drill hole data were imported into a GEMS multi-tabled workspace specifically designed 
to manage collar and interval data.  The project database stored cross-section and level plan 
definitions, such that all data pertaining to the project are contained within the same project 
database.  A copy of the project database is stored in WGM's servers in Toronto. 

                                                 
11  Down-hole survey data is affected by the ambient magnetic properties of the surrounding rocks as well as 

the conditions in the drill-rod string and operator error.  Data that is suspect should be ignored rather than 
being entered into the drill hole record (as it was), and the surveys should be repeated at a slightly different 
depth.

17.2.7  GEOLOGICAL MODELLING PROCEDURES 
 
A single inclined section was defined for the Teasdale Zone which closely paralleled the dip 
of the mineralized zone. The inclined plane dips about -17° SSW, with a strike of 281° to the 
NW.  Figure 20 shows the drill hole intercepts in 3D  and the relative position of the inclined 
plane in 3D space. 
 
 
17.2.8  GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION  
 
The mineralized zones used for the resource estimate are defined by the volume between the 
upper surface of the highest reef and the basal contact of the lowest reef, according to Appia's 
designations.  These intervals are as follows: 

2007-08 Drilling Program

17.2.9  TOPOGRAPHIC SURFACE CREATION  
 
A topographic surface or triangulated irregular network ("TIN") was generated using collar 
elevations of the holes drilled from surface for the entire Teasdale Zone.  This was not seen as 
being crucial for this stage of the Mineral Resource estimate, as the zones would only be 
mined by underground methods. 
 
 
17.2.10  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, COMPOSITING, CAPPING AND 

SPECIFIC GRAVITY  
 
17.2.10.1 Statistical Analysis and Compositing 
 
The original assay intervals varied in length, requiring normalization to a consistent length in 
order to carry out meaningful geostatistics.  A set of equal length 1-metre composites was 
generated from the raw sample intervals within the resource limits.  A total of 212 composites 
were generated.  The statistics of the composites inside the defined mineralized zones for 
TREE and U3O8, which were used for the Mineral Resource estimate, are summarized in 
Table 26.  For its grade distribution analysis, WGM examined the zones as a whole.  The 
results of this study are illustrated in Figures 21 and 22. 
 
The statistical distribution of TREE and U3O8 shows relatively good lognormal distributions.

17.2.10.2 Cut-Off Grade and Grade Capping 
 
In its previous report, WGM concluded that the 2008 Preliminary Economic Assessment 
("PEA") prepared for Pele's Eco Ridge deposit provided useful guidance to Appia concerning 
its exploitation of the Teasdale mineralization.  Specifically, the PEA provided reassurance 
that, given the current metal price forecasts applicable within a reasonable development 
timeframe, the grade of the Teasdale uranium-REE mineralization was sufficient to support an 
economically viable mining operation.  WGM concluded that the challenge for Appia would 
be to demonstrate that sufficient tonnage exists to justify mine development.  WGM did not 
use a cut-off grade in the 2008 Teasdale resource estimate as the value-matrix of the U and 
REE contents would be quite complex to model.  For this current estimate, as with Eco Ridge, 
WGM has opted to impose a "value" cut-off grade in its estimate which is akin to a "grade 
equivalence" to account for the combined grades and value of the U and REEs.  WGM's 
review of the REE and U data indicated that the grades were sufficiently robust and 
continuous to support mining the entire reef section as a single minable zone, whereas 
historical mining focused mainly on the Lower Reef section.  The variability between 
individual REEs also favoured a focus on TREE content rather than individual metals, and 
consequently supported WGM's use of geological constraints rather than a specific cut-off 
grade. 
 
One major consideration in determining future cut-off grades would be whether or not the ore 
from this deposit could be processed in a central milling facility that would accommodate 
neighbouring mining operations in the Elliot Lake camp.  This would significantly reduce 
capital and operating costs.  It is clear that a PEA of the Teasdale Zone is needed to better 
review mining and processing options. 
 
While the resources have been constrained for the resource estimate solely by geological 
marker horizons (boundaries), the hanging wall and footwall zones, immediately above and 
below the mineralized zone, include assays greater than or equal to 500 ppm TREEs and/or 
200 ppm U.  Much of this low grade material will likely be considered internal dilution for 
bulk underground mining (e.g. room and pillar).  These parameters were chosen based on a 
preliminary review of the parameters that would likely determine the economic viability of an 
underground mining operation and comparison to similar projects in the area that are currently 
being mined or are at an advanced stage of study / development. 
 
Due to the low composite sample population, there is insufficient data to support the use of 
high-grade capping at the Teasdale Zone.  Grade capping, also sometimes referred to as top-
cutting, assay grades is commonly used in the Mineral Resource estimation process to limit 



 

- 134 - 

the effect (risk) associated with extremely high assay values since high-grade outliers can 
contribute excessively to the total metal content of the deposit.  Philosophies or approaches to 
establishing and using a grade cap is variable across the industry and includes, for example, 
not using grade caps at all, arbitrarily setting all assay grades greater than a certain value to a 
high grade "limit", choosing the grade cap value to correspond to the 95 percentile in a 
cumulative distribution, evaluation of Mean Grades + multiple levels of Standard Deviations 
and the evaluation of the shape and values of histograms and/or probability plots to identify 
an outlier population.  Another rule of thumb is to set the capping level to lower the top 
10% of the metal content in the deposit.  WGM recommends that further geostatistical 
investigation be conducted as new drilling data becomes available, however, there is no 
historical basis for high-grade capping at the operating mines given the laterally continuous 
nature of the mineralization.  Also, the low coefficient of variation ("C.O.V.") for both TREE 
and U3O8 1-metre composites would suggest that top-capping is unnecessary.  Typically, 
capping is only warranted if the C.O.V. is above 1.0. 
 
The statistical distribution of TREE shows relatively good lognormal distributions, whereas 
U3O8 appears to be exhibit a more bi-modal distribution.  
 
 
17.2.10.3 Density / Specific Gravity 

 
A specific gravity factor of 2.85 tonnes per cubic metre (3.14 tons/m3) was used for volume 
conversion based on 14 samples tested by Appia at the Actlabs laboratory. WGM has 
accepted this SG as an approximation as it compares favourably with those from similar 
deposits in the Elliot Lake area (and was the basis of WGM's 2008 and 2011 resource 
estimate). 
 
WGM recommends that the SG results, like all assays, should also be stored in an assay 
database table for ease of use and comparison purposes.

17.2.11 POLYGONAL MODEL PARAMETERS, GRADE INTERPOLATION AND 
CLASSIFICATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES  

 
17.2.11.1 General 

 
The Mineral Resources have been estimated using the Polygonal method whereby a circular  
area of influence is assigned to each drill hole composite, and from which a volume can be 
calculated using the true thickness of the composite interval. 
 
 
17.2.11.2 Polygonal Model Set-Up and Parameters 

 
The polygonal model was created using the GEMS v.6.2.4 software platform to create two 
sets of polygons around each drill hole composite. The first set of polygons was generated 
based on a 140 m radius of influence and the second set on a 280 m radius.  The area of the 
polygon was determined by the area of influence deemed appropriate for the individual drill 
hole based on drilling density.  The thickness of the polygons, and thus volume, was 
determined by the hanging wall and footwall contacts of the composite.  
 
Polygon data, including area, volume, density, tonnage, grade and hole-id, was stored in a 
multi-tabled workspace in GEMS. 
 
 
17.2.11.3 Grade Interpolation / Bed Composites 

 
Variograms were generated in an attempt to characterize the spatial continuity of the 
mineralization in the defined zones, however, due to the relatively small assay database, 
meaningful variograms could not be computed.  The long history of mining of the Elliot Lake 
uranium deposits provides for a very clear understanding of the geology and the geometry of 
the mineralization.  Consequently, the area of influence and orientation of the polygons were 
based on this geological knowledge, as opposed to variograms.  Grades were thus assigned to 
the polygons based on a single length-weighted average bed composite as described in 
Section 17.4.2. 
 



 

- 136 - 

17.2.11.4 Mineral Resource Classification 
 
To categorize the Mineral Resources, WGM classified each of the smaller polygons (140 m 
radius) as Indicated, and the larger sets of polygons (280 m radius) as Inferred.  Smaller 
polygons which did not intersect adjoining smaller ones, were automatically downgraded to 
the Inferred category due to insufficient drilling density, thus eliminating the less than ideal 
"bull's eye" effect. In the case of drill hole AEC12-16, the associated Indicated Resource 
polygon was downgraded due to poor survey data as described earlier.  
 
All drill holes were included in the resource estimates as the inclusion of the Upper Reef 
("UR") and the Intermediate Quartzite ("IQ") with the Lower Reef ("LR") meant that none 
failed to exceed the minimum 2.44 m vertical thickness used historically when only the LR 
was mined.  WGM recommends that subsequent studies on the Property include preliminary 
underground mining studies to determine the appropriateness of a significantly greater (+/- 9 
m) mining height in light of recent developments in back stabilization and the design of 
mining equipment for moderately inclined orebodies.  Such studies should also consider the 
potential for losses in mining recovery due to mineralized rock left in situ as supporting 
pillars. 
 
Resource polygons associated with drill holes AEC12-12 and 14 were assigned zero grade 
and volume as a result of ground faulting and insufficient mineralization.  The polygons 
associated with AEC12-1 and 1a were downgraded to Inferred Resources due to their close 
proximity to these holes.  For illustration purposes, these zero grade polygons have been 
omitted from the figures below. WGM suggests that additional drilling be carried out near this 
cluster of holes to determine the exact nature of the mineralized disturbance/ground faulting. 
 
The Mineral Resource estimates contained herein do not account for mineability, selectivity, 
mining loss and dilution. 
 
Figure 23 shows the interpolated polygons and categorization on the inclined plane.  The visual 
comparison of polygonal model grades with the 1-metre composite grades shows a reasonable 
correlation between the values.  The orientation of the polygons follows more or less the 
plane of mineralization.  At this early stage of the Teasdale resource model, it is doubtful that 
block modelling of the resource would significantly improve the interpolation.

17.3 BANANA LAKE ZONE 
 
WGM refers the reader to the 2011 Technical Report which details the NI 43-101 compliant 
Mineral Resource estimate for the Banana Lake zone (Workman and Breede, 2011).  The 
Mineral Resource estimate is based on a total of seven (7) diamond drill holes, the results of 
which are summarized in Table 27.

Notes:  
1. Effective April 1, 2011 

2. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The 
estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, 
taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues. 

3. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there 
has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral 
Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or 
Measured Mineral Resource category. 

4. The Mineral Resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the 
CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council November 27, 2010. 

5. S.G. of 2.85 tonnes/m3 (or 3.14 tons/m3) was used. 

6. All tonnage and total lbs U3O8 amounts rounded to nearest thousand or thousandth.  Totals may not add 
up due to rounding 

 
 
 
No additional work has been carried out on the Banana Lake Zone by Appia since the 
disclosure of the foregoing resource estimate.

17.4 ESTABLISHED  HISTORICAL PRACTICES 
 
WGM was unable to find information concerning resource and reserve estimation practices in 
the Elliot Lake mines.  A document was reviewed concerning the practices used at the Agnew 
Lake Mine where "geological reserves" were calculated using a cut-off grade of 0.75 lbs U3O8 
per ton (0.38 kg/t).  "Proven Reserves" were restricted to reserves located within 200 feet 
(61 m) of underground workings and were developed on two or more sides (Agnew Lake 
Mines, 1980).  "Probable Reserves" were uranium-bearing beds located within 200 ft (61 m) 
of workings, but were only developed on one side, or alternatively, were uranium-bearing 
beds with drill hole intersections less than 400 ft (122 m) apart.  "Inferred Reserves" were 
defined as uranium-bearing beds with drill hole intersections greater than 400 ft (122 m) 
apart. 
 
WGM is of the opinion that the foregoing classifications correspond to the CIM-equivalent 
definitions for Proven Reserves, Probable Reserves and Inferred Resources.  WGM's 
discussions with former Elliot Lake mine workers, Bob MacGregor, P.Eng. and Alan 
MacEachern, P.Geo., lead it to conclude that similar estimation practices were used for the 
Elliot Lake mines.  The reliance on data from widely spaced drill holes was common practice 
at the time, and supported by the uniformity of the ore and its stratiform character.  WGM is 
of the opinion that the aforementioned spacing of data points adequately supports the 
foregoing classifications given the excellent grade and thickness continuity of the Elliot Lake 
ores.  
 
Although WGM has not seen specific mention of a dilution grade used for the conversion 
from geological reserves to minable reserves, a document by Agnew Lake Mines Ltd. 
concerning the methods used in the reserve calculation, dated 18 January, 1980, indicates that 
the practice at the Agnew Lake Mine was to use a zero grade for dilution purposes (Agnew 
Lake Mines, 1980).  According to MacEachern, the grade of the hanging wall (HW) and 
footwall (FW) dilution at the Denison Mine ranged from 0.00 to 0.60 lbs U3O8/ton depending 
somewhat on the lithology of the wall rock.  The amount of dilution from the hanging wall 
HW + FW depended on the particular reef(s) being mined and the mining method used, with 
10% being an overall average (total dilution).  The grade of the dilution at Denison ranged 
from 0.00 to 0.60 lbs U3O8/ton depending somewhat on the lithology of the wall rock.  In 
respect to current exploration targets, room and pillar mining of the >6 m Lacnor Reef would 
allow for dilutions of approximately 5 - 7% whereas mining of the 9-metre thick Teasdale 
Lake Zone would necessitate lower dilutions.

18.  ENVIRONMENTAL 
 
WGM believes that a review of the current status of environmental restoration and impact 
mitigation activities in the Elliot Lake is needed to ensure that Appia is fully informed 
regarding the potential collateral costs of mining in this area. 
 
Approximately 2 years after the start of mining termination operations in the Elliot Lake 
camp, the Atomic Energy Control Board ("AECB") decided in October 1992, that proposals 
submitted by Rio Algom Limited and Denison Mines Limited for decommissioning several 
sites should be referred to the Minister of Environment Canada for public review.  At this 
time, the decommissioning of mining projects was becoming more and more of a concern due 
to escalating costs to the Canadian public for the clean-up up of "heritage" sites.  Given the 
fact that the Elliot Lake projects involved uranium, a commodity that was enshrouded in 
political intrigue and a certain degree of societal fear, and the newness of the public review 
process, the decommissioning of the Elliot Lake uranium tailings was foreseen as a major 
undertaking. 
 

 
Plate 14:  Aerial views of the Denison Mine before and after reclamation (from Canadian Nuclear Safety 

Council (photos from the Denison Environmental Services website). 
 
 
In hindsight, the engineering of the decommission process appears to have reflected a desire 
to eradicate any memory of the previous mining at Elliot Lake without any regard to the value 
of the remaining uranium resource, and without any consideration for the future development 
of this resource.  In today's context, this approach seems short-sighted, however the author of 
this report vividly remembers the atmosphere prevailing at the time as one of relegating Elliot 
Lake to the past and looking towards the future through developments in the Athabasca Basin, 
Saskatchewan.

During early 1993, the terms of reference and operating guidelines for the review were 
proposed and a review panel was established.  In recognition that the Ontario Government had 
accepted the responsibility for environmental remediation work at many of the Denison and 
Rio Algom mines12, the review was limited to Denison's proposal to decommission its 
Denison and Stanrock mine tailings facilities and Rio's proposal to decommission its Quirke 
and Panel mine tailings facilities. 
 
By October 1993, draft guidelines had been issued by the panel for the preparation of an 
Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS") by each proponent.  These statements require a 
description of the existing Elliot Lake tailings management areas, the proposed method for 
long-term management of the tailings, and the potential environmental and health impacts of 
these proposals. 
 
An EIS was expected early in 1995 from each of Denison and Rio Algom.  Intervener 
Funding was provided to various public groups to allow them to adequately prepare and 
present input into the environmental review process.  In addition to the release of radioactive 
nuclides such as radon and radium, one of the major concerns was the potential for acid 
generating tailings and waste to contaminate the local watershed.  Some of the other concerns 
were as follows: 

• drying of the tailings and contaminant dust generation; 

• uncovering and oxidation of the tailings and resultant acid generation; 

• water containing solubilized heavy metals seeping out and entering the Serpent River 
water system, and related impacts on water quality, sediments and fish; and, 

• excessive inadvertent exposure of intruders, human and wildlife, to gamma radiation 
from tailings surfaces. 

 
In the case of tailings treatment, water cover to a minimum depth of 5 cm was seen as an 
important means to prevent dust generation and oxidation.  According to Health Canada, 
predictive modelling suggested a need for the sites to be monitored for the next 1,000 to 
10,000 years beyond the present based on the long term radiological impact of the tailings, 
primarily driven by the 1,600-year half life of Ra-226. 

                                                 
12   As the mining operations drew down economically exploitable resources, it was apparent that only the high 

prices negotiated under long term sales agreements with Ontario Hydro could keep the Elliot Lake mines in 
operation.  Public pressure forced Ontario Hydro, an Ontario Crown Corporation, to exercise options to 
terminate its contracts with Denison and Rio Algom.  In exchange, the Ontario Government agreed to assume 
the responsibility for site remediation work at several, but not all, of the former producers' mines.

Health Canada issued a summary of its finding in a summary document entitled 
"Decommissioning of the Quirke/Panel & Stanrock/Denison Uranium Mine Tailings 
Management Areas in Elliot Lake, Ontario".  It contained the following statement dated 
November 16, 1995 by Mr. David Grogan of Health Canada: 
 

"Based on facility design and expected performance, chemical contaminants are 
not expected to be an issue.  While some exposure parameters (e.g. drinking water 
consumption, air intake, fish consumption) are not properly used, they do not 
appear to impact negatively on the choice of the decommissioning option.  The 
conclusion that chemical contaminants are not an issue is dependent upon the 
facility operating as expected.  Monitoring of the performance is essential to 
ensure water quality is not adversely impacted.  No significant radiological 
impacts are anticipated from the decommissioning options chosen by the 
proponents." 

 
The Elliot Lake environmental assessment panel submitted its recommendations to the 
Federal Government during June, 1996 concerning the plans by the two mining companies to 
decommission the mill tailings sites. The panel agreed with the decommissioning proposals 
set out by both companies.  The review panel recommended certain conditions for closing and 
reclaiming the Quirke, Panel, Denison and Stanrock tailings facilities. 
 
Nearly a year later, in April 1997, the Federal Government agreed that the proposals 
submitted by Denison and Rio Algom, and the panel's recommendations should form the 
basis of the decommissioning licences for the uranium waste management areas.  Approval 
was recommended for the licensing process to proceed, and at the end of the year 
decommissioning was proceeding at the specific sites in compliance with regulatory 
guidelines. 
 
Decommissioning operations occurred from 1990 to 1998, and by late 1999 the major site  
decommissioning and reclamation work on the Rio Algom facilities (Stanleigh, Quirke, 
Panel) and the Denison facilities (Stanrock/Can-Met, Denison) was essentially completed.  
Waste management and tailings management areas were stabilized, and most have been 
flooded (tailings at Stanrock were saturated to reduce acid generation but have a dry cover).  
Planned interim monitoring and active management will be maintained until the effluent 
meets discharge criteria without treatment. At that time, the sites will enter into a phase of 
long-term monitoring with care and maintenance. 
 



 
 

- 143 - 

During April 1999, the AECB amended the decommissioning licences for the Denison and 
Stanrock mines to expand the site boundaries to include areas identified in 1998 that exceeded 
the clean-up criteria established for the two sites.  
 
In addition to the Rio Algom mines covered under the AECB decommissioning licence, the 
Spanish American, Milliken, Lacnor, Nordic, Buckles and Pronto Mine facilities were not 
licensed for remedial action.  These facilities were licensed by Rio Algom during 1995 to 
meet AECB requirements to control radioactive materials.  Rio Algom submitted an 
environmental assessment report in 1999 that was reviewed that same year.  During 2000, a 
revised report was expected to be submitted to the AECB with licensing approval expected 
later that year. 
 
Rio Algom and Denison Mines are also monitoring the Serpent River and its watershed to 
assess the environmental impacts of their operations and tailings facilities on the entire 
Serpent River system.  Up to the end of 2004, Denison and Rio Algom have committed over 
$75 million to decommissioning and waste management.  Periodic sampling of background 
and receiving waters is carried out, as well as studies every five years on the biota in the 
watershed and the man-made tailings environments.   Water quality monitoring is on-going.  
Collective annual costs to Denison and Rio Algom for these activities are approximately 
$2 million. 
 
The first of the five-year biota assessments was completed in the fall of 1999 and a report was 
issued in 2000.  The biological activity shows that the decommissioning efforts have been 
successful.  Near-field environmental impacts on the watershed were detectable, as expected, 
in the form of above-background levels of salts, total dissolved solids and some metals.  
Nevertheless, the local fish, benthic invertebrates and wildlife displayed no adverse effects.  
The second stage of data collection was completed during 2004 and a report summarizing the 
findings was released in 2005. 
 
The sustained effort to restore the Elliot Lake watershed to its original condition has been 
costly for all concerned.  Any mine development activities by Appia should be undertaken in 
this context.  While the previous mine sites represent areas already impacted by industrial 
activity, new mine development will likely draw attention which may be disproportionate to 
the impacts contemplated by mine planners.  First Nations communities that are located in 
watersheds down-stream from mining operations may spawn groups that are especially 
resistant to uranium mining.  Alternatively, Appia's engagement of such groups may define 
substantial grounds for co-operation since the previous mining activities have not produced 
adverse health consequences although there have been unsubstantiated claims to the contrary.

Notwithstanding opposition to a renewal of uranium mining in the Elliot Lake area, many of 
the residents of Elliot Lake may in fact welcome the industrial activity as a means of 
increasing property values and stimulating the local economy.  The overall success of the site 
restoration and impact mitigation work carried out by the Province and by the miners should 
be seen as clear evidence that impacts can be managed in an environmentally responsible 
manner.  Careful and enlightened interaction between company representatives and the public 
is required.  The Canadian Nuclear Safety Council, in considering Rio Algom's application 
concerning consolidating the site management under its existing Waste Facility Operating 
Licence, chastised Rio Algom for not doing enough to keep the Public informed of its 
activities (Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, 2004).  Rio Algom has responded with bus 
tours of the sites several times a year and biannual inserts in the local newspapers up-dating 
the community on its efforts.   
 
As of the date of this report, Denison and Rio Tinto maintain a joint webpage at 
http://www.denisonenvironmental.com which is a Denison Environmental Services ("DES") 
webpage providing information on various mining legacy projects undertaken by the 
company.  DES provides information concerning the history and rehabilitation of the former 
uranium mine sites in the Elliot Lake area.  The website contains various presentations made 
in respect to DES activities to local communities and up-dates/maintains means of 
communication between residents and DES. 
 
Clearly, future uranium production from this area will require an inclusive approach that 
builds upon the experiences of the past.  There is no compelling environmental reason why 
uranium mining cannot resume in the Elliot Lake area and indeed the local community 
appears to want the employment opportunities that such activities would bring.  This view has 
been echoed to some extend by officials in the Ontario Ministry of the Environment.  Elliot 
Lake town officials have recently proposed the sale of building lots in the greater Elliot Lake 
area, including the Quirke Lake area, and Appia needs to ensure that all parties are adequately 
informed concerning its mineral exploration activities and the mineral development rights that 
accrue to its mining claims.  Appia should explore alternatives to conventional surface milling 
and processing that would allow sub-surface leaching as was used in the past and/or back-
filling mine openings with tailings.

19.  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
19.1 GENERAL NOTES ON THE URANIUM MARKET 
 
In Workman and Breede (2011), WGM presented a review of Canada's energy history as it 
applies to the commodity market for uranium.  The reader is encouraged to read this 
document which is only summarized here. 
 
The uranium market is neither transparent nor well publicized in the same sense that 
information on the copper or gold markets is easily obtained.  The market, such as it exists, is 
dominated by transactions negotiated in private between uranium miners and nuclear fuel 
producers and energy utilities.  The market is heavily leveraged on public acceptance of 
nuclear electric energy, and major reactor incidents can have strong short term effects on 
uranium pricing.  The uranium market is also very politicized, and it can be difficult to 
unravel the events by which the market has developed.  Great attention is commonly focused 
on the uranium Spot Price, yet the spot market is the discount market where discretionary 
(and usually small) purchases are made.  The casual observer is consequently presented with 
rapidly up-dated information on Spot Market pricing which can be quite volatile.  Most 
energy utilities seek the security of assured uranium supply through long-term contracts 
which are seldom made public, and Term Market pricing is consequently more stable as a 
result.  The surging market for uranium seen in 2006 and 2007 was very similar to that which 
existed 40 years earlier.  The international reaction to the disaster following the Japanese 
tsunami is uncannily similar to that which followed the Three Mile Island accident, though 
the scale is hardly comparable.  Other aspects of the uranium industry are very different.  
With some knowledge of the historical legacy comes some understanding of the current 
potential for escalating prices in the uranium market which are of vital importance to projects 
such as that envisioned by Appia. 
 
There have been several instances of rapidly escalating uranium prices in the past.  As 
Workman and Breede noted, following the deregulation of uranium prospecting in 1948, the 
Government of Canada set a minimum U3O8 purchase price of $2.75 per pound, guaranteed 
for a period of five years, and by 1956 more than 10,000 new radioactive occurrences were 
reported to the Atomic Energy Control Board of Canada.  Despite an embargo imposed by the 
United States of America ("US") in 1967 to protect US domestic uranium producers from 
foreign suppliers, the growing demands of new nuclear-electric utilities and government 
stockpiling programs resulted in a rapid global escalation of uranium prices during the 1970s 
which encouraged exploration.  In infamous Uranium Cartel that Canada participated in with 
France and Australia was effective in establishing a U3O8 floor price for only 18 months in 



 
 

- 146 - 

1972-73, after which the global price escalated beyond the cartel's $4.90 benchmark.  The 
uranium price increase occurred during a time of soaring oil consumption, as well as rapidly 
escalating oil prices as a result of the founding of OPEC and the increased power of those 
member states to establish production schedules and floor prices for petroleum beginning in 
1973.  It is difficult to believe that in March, 1970, a US Presidential Proclamation had 
restricted the flow of Canadian oil into US markets.  The linkage of uranium prices with oil 
prices is imperfect, but nevertheless convincing in the longer term. 
 
In June, 1976, the Canadian Government announced revised uranium resource estimates in a 
report entitled "1975 Assessment of Canada's Uranium Supply and Demand", using a 
maximum price of US $40 per pound of U3O8, equal to the Spot Market price at the time.  
The actual market price for uranium remained above this threshold until January, 1980, 
averaging $42.29 during this 43-month period.  During the same timeframe, the Term Market 
price averaged $42.62, and neither the Spot nor the Term prices seemed to be much affected 
by the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania on 28 March, 1979.  In fairness, 
this was a minor accident resulting in no loss of life, and even 35 years later no illnesses have 
been attributed to the event.  A minor release of radioactivity occurred in the form of steam 
charged with radioactive krypton gas (Kr85) and minor amounts of iodine (I131) even though 
the plan suffered a partial meltdown.  Ironically, this relatively minor incident was widely 
publicized internationally.  The movie "The China Syndrome", concerning a nuclear disaster, 
was released just 12 days before the incident and became a blockbuster.  The accident and the 
movie combined to have far-reaching effects on public opinion, particularly in the United 
States where construction plans for several reactors were cancelled and public concern 
increased about society's dependence on nuclear reactors for electrical energy. 
 
During the 1970s, the price support mechanisms implemented by Canadian and other 
governments had a profound effect in stimulating uranium exploration and mining.  Although 
the effects of over-stimulation were recognized well in advance, and the accumulating global 
stockpile of uranium in various forms was considerable, the rapid downturn in prices at the 
end of 1979 and the abandonment of Government support policies was not fully anticipated.  
The downturn in uranium prices accelerated as economic growth stalled under the weight of 
high interest rates in 1981-83, run-away Government deficits, and collapsing commodity 
prices. The end result of revised energy demand outlooks and cancelled or delayed reactor 
construction, the accumulated uranium stockpiles have taken more than two decades to 
consume.  The net result was depressed prices which bottomed in October and November, 
1991 with a Spot Market price of $7.40 however the industry was sustained by blended 
pricing structures which prevailed under previously negotiated contracts. 
 



 
 

- 147 - 

Public sentiments towards nuclear energy have exerted an effect on nuclear programs as had 
been seen previously as a result of the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania during 
1979.  The Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident on 26 April, 1986, is widely recognized as a 
true disaster caused by either operator error or poor reactor design.  It directly resulted in 31 
deaths and affected tens of millions of people to a greater or lesser degree over a very wide 
region.  Chernobyl may have had a weak affect on uranium prices - over the 2-year period 
following the accident, the Spot Market price declined 9%, however this should be viewed in 
the context of what was already a weak and declining market. 
 
The low prices for uranium that prevailed during the late 1980s and the 1990s, together with 
rising production costs, saw the closure of most of the uranium mines and mills in the US, and 
the closure of all uranium mines in Canada outside of Saskatchewan.  Perhaps nowhere was 
the change in uranium production more dramatic than in the United States as shown in 
Figure 24.  The collapse in US mine output in response to falling prices was dramatic, largely 
due to the lower grade of US uranium resources - less than 1,000 tonnes of uranium was 
produced in 1992.  The mills that these mines supplied were also forced to shut down by a 
combination of feed shortages and cost pressures.  During 2004, six mines were operating in 
the US compared with 430 in 1979.  All production was from in-situ leach plants – no 
conventional uranium mills were operating.

indicate the number of operating mines using the scale at left and mine production is 
shown by the dark line against the scale at right – from the US AEC. 

 
 
The 1990s also saw the gradual depletion of uranium stockpiles.  An upwards 'blip' in 
uranium prices occurred during 1995-96 when the U3O8 price rose briefly above $16 before 
gradually falling off to about $8.75 by November, 1998 and $7.10 by December, 2000. 



 
 

- 148 - 

The 2006-07 rise in uranium pricing did not initially achieve much in the way of recognition.  
It is possible that years of inattention left the investment community lethargic as the increase 
was initially thought to be a minor bump similar to that which  occurred in 1995.  However, 
the fundamentals affecting the uranium market were very different, mainly due to the 
exhaustion of the global stockpile, limited growth in uranium production, growing resistance 
to the conversion of highly enriched uranium ("HEU") to nuclear fuel, growing energy 
requirements in the developing world, and re-emerging demand for nuclear-electric energy 
sources in existing markets.  For the first time, nuclear power was seen as "green" energy as it 
alone offered the potential to satisfy growing base-load energy demands without contributing 
to CO2 emissions. 
 
It is also important, perhaps vitally so, to recognize that the international market is now 
largely unfettered from the political interferences and protectionism that prevailed earlier, and 
typified by US actions to protect its own producers.  Conventional wisdom holds that hedge 
funds participated in uranium purchases during 2007 and were largely responsible for the 
volatility seen in the Spot Market price at that time.  The fall in Term contract prices seen 
during 2008 and the partial recovery seen in 2009 indicates the true strength of the market 
which at the time appeared to be corrective in the range of $50 to $60 per pound of U3O8. 
 
Between June 2010 and February 2011, the Spot Market price escalated from $40.75 to 
$72.00 per pound of U3O8 and the Term Market price increased from $58 to $73 marking 
gains of 77% and 26%, respectively.  The Fukushima Daiichi event on 11 March 2011, the 
result of a 13-metre tsunami and not a nuclear accident in any real meaning of the term, had a 
profound effect on public opinion much as the Chernobyl disaster had earlier.  Erosion in the 
confidence of nuclear power led to suspended projects, shut-down reactors, political posturing 
by anti-nuclear politicians and weakening of uranium prices.  One year later, the Spot and 
Terms prices were $51 and $60, for respective declines of 29% and 18%. 
 
Prices in 2012 and thus far in 2013 have been soft, and the uranium Spot Market price 
according to UxC is US $39.50 per lb of U3O8 as of 10 July, 2013, and the Term Market 
remains stable at $56.50 where the price has remained for several months.  Uranium 
transaction data in difficult to acquire on the internet, however the available information 
suggests that the number of Spot Market transactions thus far in 2013 is substantially lower 
than in previous years.  Together with the stability of the Term Price, the transaction data 
suggests that producers are either unable to commit surplus supply to the discount market, 
have no surplus  to commit or are unwilling to make supply available at the prevailing price.  
In any case, the movement towards lower prices appears to have run its course. 
 



 
 

- 149 - 

One factor that is certainly weighing on the uranium market is the end of the US-Russian 
Megatons to Megawatts Program ("MMP"), an agreement under which 475 tonnes of highly 
enriched (weapons grade) uranium ("HEU") from approximately 19,000 Russian nuclear 
warheads is being down-blended with depleted uranium to produce commercial-grade, low-
enriched uranium ("LEU") for use in nuclear power plants.  Initiated in 1993, the 20-year 
program which terminates at the end of 2013, has provided LEU to the US for use in nuclear 
power plant since June, 1995.  This LEU currently provides for over 10% of the electricity 
requirements of the US at a cost of approximately US $8 billion. 
 
No plans have been enunciated by either party to extend the MMP agreement, however USEC 
Inc. has a multi-year contract with Russia's Techsnabexport ("TENEX") for a 10-year supply 
of LEU.  Under the terms of the agreement, the supply of LEU to USEC will begin in 2013 
and ramp up until it reaches a level in 2015 that is approximately 50% of the level currently 
supplied by TENEX to USEC under the MMP.  With Russian approval, there is an option for 
the US to increase the quantities of LEU acquired up to the same level as the previous HEU 
program, however it is vital to note that, by all measures, this is a conventional purchase 
agreement unlike the MMP.  The quantities supplied under the new contract will come from 
Russia's commercial enrichment activities and not from the down-blending of warhead 
material.  WGM presumes that Russia will supply only that additional LEU in excess of the 
basic agreement that is available and surplus to its own internal needs.  Yet Russia itself is not 
self-sufficient in uranium.  In 2006, Tekhsnabexport and the Russian-Kazakh-Kyrgyz 
uranium mining venture "Zarechnoye" signed a contract to enable the delivery of $1 billion 
worth of uranium to Russia between January, 2007 and 2022.  The Zarechnoye Mine was 
expected to begin uranium production in the third quarter of 2006 at a design capacity of 
1,000 tons of U3O8 per year from a deposit estimated to contain a resource of 19,000 tons.  In 
the project announcement, it is clear that Russia expects to receive as much as an additional 
5,000 tonnes per year from Kazakhstan.  The country increased its production by 26% in 2007 
to 6,637 tonnes of yellow cake, up from 5,281 tonnes the previous year and has remained at 
the forefront in increasing output and becoming the world's leading producer accounting for 
37% of global production with 19,451 t of uranium (22,939 t of U3O8) produced during 2011, 
an increase of 9% over 2010 (USGS Minerals 2011 Yearbook).  Production is forecast at 
30,000 tonnes in 2030 (MacLeod Dixon, 2008).  Given the degree of State control of the 
industry in Kazakhstan, which may conflict with the interests of foreign investors, it will be 
interesting to see whether these ambitious production targets can be achieved  
 
All followers of the market, including uranium commodity specialists, are forecasting higher 
prices at the end of 2013 and significantly higher prices by 2016 due to tightened supply-



 
 

- 150 - 

demand dynamics.  This is mainly the result of new reactor builds which are out-pacing the 
number of old reactors being retired, and the termination of the US-Russia MMP.  In Japan, 
where only two of the nation's 50 reactors are on-line, the restarting of nuclear power stations 
is a key government goal to reduce the import bill for fossil fuel to run conventional stations.  
On 8 July, 2013, operators applied to restart 10 of the idle reactors and some units are 
projected to restart within the next year.  Mr. Kenzo Oshima, a commissioner of Japan's 
Nuclear Regulation Authority, told Reuters "It is hard to imagine that all the applications 
would be rejected, though we don't know what the outcome will be at the moment."  The 
restart of Japan's reactors is seen internationally as a significant vote of confidence in nuclear 
energy.  A collateral benefit to uranium markets is the fact that a restart means that Japan's 
considerable nuclear fuel stockpiles will remain committed to Japan's needs and will not be 
dumped on the market.  
 
 
19.2 NEW URANIUM SUPPLY 
 
According to the World Nuclear Organization, known uranium resources have increased 
almost threefold since 1975, more or less in line with expenditures on uranium exploration.  
Increased exploration expenditures in the future are likely to result in a corresponding 
increase in known resources, even as inflation increases the costs of mining and recovery 
thereby eliminating some resources. 
 
Australia, with approximately 31% of the world's uranium resources, remains a potential 
source of new supply.  Until recently Australia upheld its Three Mine Policy initiated during 
the late 1970s, a law initiated by a national Labour government and vigorously pursued by the 
various State governments that limited the country's uranium industry to a maximum of three 
operating uranium mines at any one time.  The position of the Federal Government softened 
some time ago as it became clear that nuclear energy offered an increasingly greenhouse gas 
conscious world a source of relatively clean energy, notwithstanding environmental concerns 
related to the disposal of mine tailings.  South Australia, with its giant Olympic Dam copper-
uranium-gold deposit, was the first state government to move forward, permitting Australia's 
fourth uranium mine, SXR Uranium One's Honeymoon Mine, an in-situ leach operation (400 
t U3O8/year for 7 yrs).  BHP Billiton Ltd., the owner of Olympic Dam and a significant 
uranium producer on its own, announced plans to triple the mine's output of uranium oxide to 
15,000 tonnes per year, notwithstanding the impact of the accident in 2010 that seriously 
damaged the main production shaft.  This plan was set aside in the wake of the Fukushima 
Daiichi disaster.  Recent activity shows that the South Australia government has essentially 
abandoned the Three Mine Policy, a shift with uncertain impacts, but it seems clear to WGM 



 
 

- 151 - 

that Australia's uranium production is likely to increase over the next decade as many 
deposits have been delineated and brought beyond the feasibility study stage – they are ready 
for development pending only completion of whatever new permitting process emerges.  
These deposits include Jabiluka in the Northern Territory, Yeelirrie (owned by Cameco) and 
Kintyre in Western Australian, and Valhalla in Queensland.  Collectively, the known 
resources in Australia total some 2 Mt of U3O8 ranking it first among uranium resource 
countries.  Australia has the potential to produce more than 20% of world mine production, 
and its federal government believes that the stated resource base substantially understates its 
uranium potential.  As the country has no domestic nuclear energy industry, all of this 
uranium will be for export, and China has been identified as a major new market for 
Australian uranium. 
 
WGM and others believe that renewed interest in nuclear power, partially due to energy 
market growth and partially due to concerns over the greenhouse gas emissions of alternative 
methods of generating base electrical load, will result in an escalation of uranium prices and 
consequently an increase in exploration and development spending on uranium projects.  A 
range of undeveloped or moth-balled deposits are present in the US, the largest being the 
Mount Taylor deposit in the Ambrosia Lake district of New Mexico.  Developed by Gulf 
Minerals Resources Co. in the late 1970s, the deposit has never seen full production.  As with 
other metals, exploration expenditures will lag increased commodity prices, but will thereafter 
tend to track price trends quite closely.  Since the mid-1980s, uranium exploration 
expenditures have been at a virtual standstill except in the Athabasca Basin where a collection 
of established producers and well funded junior companies have persisted due to the high 
grade character of the unconformity-type deposits (high reward/risk ratio).  Improved 
exploration techniques and equipment will assist the industry in finding ever more deeply 
concealed deposits.  Explorers are also active in countries which were not open to western 
companies during the 1970s uranium boom, countries such as Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China 
and Russia.  As mentioned, Australia will be a major focus because of its known potential and 
the change in uranium politics. 
 
Recent discoveries by uranium explorers will add new supply to the market which will likely 
continue over the next decade.  This is occurring both in established camps, such as several 
recent discoveries in Canada's Athabasca Basin, and in emerging areas such as the Dornod 
Deposit being developed in Mongolia (4-5 M lbs U3O8 per year for 10 years).  Kazakhstan 
remains a major producer with ample opportunity to increase its output.  Intensive exploration 
activity in Canada is expected to result in new high grade discoveries and some are currently 



 
 

- 152 - 

developing momentum, such as the Fission Uranium-Alpha Minerals Patterson Lake South 
deposit. 
 
Although uranium mining in Gabon ceased in the late 1990s, and in general French uranium 
production has not been significant for most of the last 20 years, several new discoveries have 
been made in Gabon which are estimated to total approximately 26,000 tons of uranium.  
Areva, the main explorer in the country, maintained in 2009 that it required 30,000 tons to 
justify mine development and it is uncertain that this hurdle has been met.  In neighbouring 
Niger, many companies are active including those from France, Russia, China, India and 
Korea.  In northern Niger, Areva's Imouraren project is slated for production in 2014 or 2015 
at an annual rate of 5,000 tpa of uranium.  In southern Niger, China National Nuclear Corp. 
operates the Azelik uranium mine which has been plagued with labour stoppages.  It is 
expected to ramp up production to 2,500 tpa in 2015 when it is expected to have a total 
resource of some one million tonnes of uranium, and to a level of 4-5,000 tpa by 2020. 
 
In Africa, new mine development in Namibia appears to be a certainty at Rio Tinto's 160 Mt 
Z20 deposit and Swakop Uranium's 205 million tonne Husab Mine (497 ppm U).  A planned 
production rate of 15 Mlbs/year of U3O8 is planned for the Husab Mine which is 90% owned 
by a consortium of companies from China.  Rio Tinto recently suspended temporarily mining 
operations at its money-losing 2,700 tpa13 Rössing Mine.  In its lifetime, Rossing has 
produced more than 266 Mlbs of U3O8 as of year-end 2011 and the Z20 deposit is potentially 
of similar size and grade (350-400 ppm U).  Other, albeit minor, new sources in Africa may 
be developed in such countries as in Botswana (A-Cap Resources's Letlbakane project), the 
Central African Republic (Areva's currently suspended Bakouma Mine), the DRC (Areva's 
Shinkolobwe Mine) and Mali (Rockgate Capital Corp's Faléa Project).  The Letlbakane 
deposit (45 Mt averaging 180 ppm U) is low grade by all accounts and is forecast to produce 
2.2 Mlbs U3O8 (846 t U) per year at an initial cost of US $48.41 per lb U3O8 according to a 
recent preliminary economic assessment. 
  
Leading uranium projects in South America include U3O8 Corp's Kurupung exploration 
project in Guyana (>16 Mlbs U3O8 at 0.08-0.09% U3O8) and the Santa Quitéria phosphate 
deposit in Brazil (est. 1,500 tpa uranium production), as well as a uranium by-product project 
associated with copper production at Codelco's Radomiro Tomic Mine.  U3O8 Corp also has 
uranium interests in Columbia and Argentina but these projects are not advanced.  
Considerable anti-uranium mining pressure exists that is holding back projects in Argentina

and a proposed mine in a UNESCO world heritage site in the Quebrada de Humabuaca area 
has been a lightning rods for protest.  The potential for a few small historical producers to 
reopen if prices increase cannot be ruled out (eg. the Don Otto Mine). 
 
Despite the clear potential for new mine development, many past producers are being 
examined due to looming supply shortages.  About 20% of US uranium production up until 
the mid-1990s came as a by-product from central Florida's phosphate deposits, after which 
time the uranium production became uneconomic.  Higher anticipated uranium prices are 
resulting in a re-examination of this resource for its potential to produce 400 t U/year as well 
as a similar lower-grade uranium-REE deposit in Morocco.  Coal ash is another easily-
accessible though minor uranium resource in many parts of the world, including in China 
where the uranium content of the ash averages approximately 210 ppm in Yunnan Province. 
The Xiaolongtang power station ash heap contains more than over 1000 t of uranium, with 
continuing annual contributions to the heap of about 190 t of uranium.  Metallurgical testing 
is underway to determine the economics of acid leaching which can recover about 70% of the 
uranium. 
 
It is forecast that widespread use of fast breeder reactors could increase the utilisation of 
uranium 50-fold or more.  Breeder reactor are said to produce more fuel than they consume, 
but their construction in the US and elsewhere was cancelled because of the fears surrounding 
their use of plutonium.  These reactors, supplied with natural or depleted uranium in a  "fertile 
blanket" can be operated so that each tonne of ore yields 60 times more energy than in a 
conventional reactor.  The security concerns surrounding the implementation of breeder 
programs and the handling of plutonium-enriched fuel make it unlikely these reactors will be 
widely used, however, it is interesting that Canada's CANDU reactor can in its present form 
consume plutonium-laced or mixed oxide fuel, commonly referred to as "MOX". 
 
The world's power reactors, with a combined installed capacity of some 375 GWe, annually 
require about 68,000 tonnes of uranium.  While this capacity is being run more productively, 
with higher capacity factors and reactor power levels, the total uranium fuel requirement is 
increasing.  The growing number of reactors in service, and increases in overall efficiencies 
are being offset by a trend for larger capacities and higher fuel burn-up, and consequently fuel 
demand is more or less steady.  According to the World  Nuclear Organization, the electricity 
generated by nuclear power increased 3.6-fold from 1980 to 2008 while the uranium used 
increased by a factor of 2.5. 
 



 
 

- 154 - 

The amount of natural uranium (0.7% U235 99.3% U238) required for a given amount of reactor 
fuel (+/- 4% U235) has been reduced somewhat through reducing the amount of the readily 
fissionable 0.7% U235 in the depleted uranium tails from enrichment plants.  The reprocessing 
of used fuel from conventional light water reactors also utilises present resources more 
efficiently.  In 2009, it was estimated that 75% of reactor fuel requirements were being met by 
direct mine output.  The balance was being met from secondary sources such as commercial 
stockpiles, nuclear weapons stockpiles, recycled plutonium and uranium from reprocessing 
used fuel, and some from re-enrichment of depleted uranium tails. 
 
Lastly, the impact of thorium as a reactor fuel should be factored into long-term uranium 
pricing scenarios.  The thorium fuel cycle has some attractive features, and although it is not 
yet in commercial use as uranium is the only fuel currently used, research in India has 
advanced our knowledge of its potential.  Thorium is approximately three times as abundant 
in the earth's crust as uranium.  In 2009, the IAEA provided an estimate of global thorium 
resources at 3.6 million tonnes however this excludes data from much of the world where 
little or no exploration for thorium has occurred.  The IAEA estimates that the actual thorium 
resource available may be as much as 6 Mt.  At this time, thorium can be used as a fuel for 
CANDU reactors or in reactors specially designed for this purpose.  The heavy water 
moderator inherent in the CANDU design make it very efficient in respect to neutron-capture 
provided the reactor is started using a fissile material such as U235 or Pu239.  The Th232 atom 
isotope captures a neutron in the reactor, thus becoming fissile U233, which continues the 
chain reaction.  In the future, some advanced reactor designs are likely to be able to make use 
of thorium on a substantial scale, however at this time the prevalent light water reactors are 
unable to use thorium due to their lower neutron efficiency.  The current reactor population 
and current production technologies create considerable inertia working against the radical 
shift that thorium reactors would bring, and thus the substitution of thorium for uranium is not 
seen as having a measurable impact on uranium markets in the foreseeable future.  The higher 
uranium prices needed to bring about a changeover to thorium would presumably result in a 
flood of new uranium supply at lower prices which would reduce the economic incentive for 
change.  Other factors favouring thorium aside, such as its inability to produce plutonium as a 
by-product and enrichment issues attached to the use of uranium fuel in light water reactors, 
WGM does not foresee thorium use as a threat to development of such uranium projects as 
Appia's Teasdale deposit.

19.3 URANIUM PRICE OUTLOOK 
 
Any analysis of the uranium market must begin with an analysis of price trends.  However, 
while the pricing of other mineral commodities is transparent due to the existence of metal 
retailers and a terminal market/warehouse for which prices quotes are readily available, the 
pricing of uranium has commonly been determined in closed door negotiations between 
producers and energy utilities.  WGM's review of information pertaining to the main Elliot 
Lake producers, Denison Mines Limited and Rio Algom Limited, revealed that the companies 
were willing to divulge delivery prices during the early 1960s, however this willingness 
apparently disappeared as prices escalated such that the companies only advertised sales 
volumes14.  For confidentiality reasons, Cameco does not publish its contracted delivery 
prices in its annual reports.  As a result, it is very difficult to get an unambiguous average 
price for the majority of uranium deliveries, whether as U3O8 or as reactor fuel (UO2). 
 
At about the time Appia's Elliot Lake project was initiated, the Spot Market price on 6 June, 
2007 was US$135 per lb of U3O8 versus approximately $40 at the time of writing this report 
in June, 2013, a price retreat of approximately 70%.  The less volatile Term Market price at 
that time was $95 versus $57 at this date, a retreat of 40%.  However, it important to note that 
the Spot Price is the discount price and not the price at which most uranium is delivered to 
energy utilities.  As of the date of this report, the Spot and Term prices are still recovering 
from the effects of the Fukushima Daiichi tsunami disaster in 2011 which was used by the 
media, anti-nuclear activists, and opposition governments to cast unjustifiable dispersions on 
the nuclear energy industry.  Even Japan, having understandable concerns about reactor safety 
in an area with clear geohazards concerns, has re-stated its support of the industry and 
applications are being studied for the restart of 10 reactors idled since early 2011. 
 
Utilities are intermittently buying in the Spot Market to supplement nuclear fuel supplies 
stockpiled at reactors and to satisfy the need for initial cores at new reactor sites.  Substantial 
new electrical capacity development is going ahead at various nuclear sites and continuing 
upwards pressure on prices seems certain.  The US-Russian HEU Agreement, officially 
named the "Megatons to Megawatts Program", terminates at the end of 2013.  Under this 
agreement, 500 tonnes of highly enriched (weapons grade) uranium ("HEU") from 
approximately 20,000 Russian nuclear warheads is being down-blended to produce 
                                                 
14  The lack of transparency in the uranium market was once more given force by a recent decision concerning 

uranium by the Canadian Government, namely:  "commencing in 2002, Natural Resources Canada has 
decided to suspend the publication of the Average Price of Deliveries under Export Contracts for uranium 
for a period of three to five years, pending a policy review and assessment of market conditions" (NRCan 
website). 



 
 

- 156 - 

commercial-grade, low-enriched uranium ("LEU") for use in nuclear power plants.  The LEU 
is shipped to the US where it is used as nuclear power plant fuel to generate electricity.  
Initiated in 1993, the 20-year program first shipped LEU to the US in June 1995.  At this time 
the warhead-derived LEU from Russia provides over 10% of the electricity requirements of 
the US.  No plans have been enunciated by either party to extend the agreement. 
 
Despite the anti-nuclear political rhetoric present in Europe, and until its recent reversal, 
Japan (which accurately WGM predicted), many new nuclear-electric development projects 
are proceeding more or less on schedule.  Both China and India, neither self-sufficient in 
fossil fuels, are constructing new reactors as quickly as possible due to rapidly escalating  
energy requirements – India's will triple within 25 years. 
 
The last 20 years in uranium market has also witnessed a change-over of Russia from a major 
exporter of surplus uranium from its U3O8 and HEU15 stockpiles to a net importer and is 
seeing the growing commitments of China and India to nuclear energy as competing with its 
own interests.  Developing nations are increasingly turning to nuclear as a reliable provider of 
"green" energy.  Even the energy-rich United Arab Emirates is building its first of several 
planned reactors as a means of providing energy for water desalination plants while freeing 
future oil and gas production for export rather than domestic consumption.  Saudi Arabia is 
planning the construction of a group of reactors for the same purposes.  The future market for 
small modular reactors for remote communities and industrial complexes seems assured to 
contribute to uranium demand.  These factors must be taken into consideration in order to 
have some understanding as to the potential for a project such as is envisioned by Appia. 
 
The uranium price outlook is a function of supply and demand like any other mineral 
commodity.  Unlike other commodities, the demand for uranium is governed by reactor 
requirements which are known both now and for the future lifetime of the nuclear plant. A 
typical 1,000 MW light water reactor requires approximately 800,000 lbs of U3O8 annually, 
depending upon its load factor and burn-up rate.  A typical 1,000 MW plant can supply the 
electricity needs for a city of about 600,000-1 million population.  
 
During 2010, a typical 1,000 MW nuclear reactor came with a price tag of approximately US 
$5.3 billion ($5,300 per kW according to the World Nuclear Organization), and required the 
better part of a decade to permit and construct.  For a light water reactor requiring enriched 

                                                 
15  HEU – highly enriched (weapons grade) uranium containing as much as 90% U235 in contrast with natural 

uranium which contains approximately 0.7% U235 and 99.3% U238.  Note that light water nuclear reactors 
require 3-5% U235 in contrast with CANDU reactors which accept uranium fuel in its natural isotopic ratios.

uranium (LEU), the costs associated with acquiring one kilogram of uranium oxide (UO2) fuel 
in June 2013 was: 
 
 U3O8 purchase: 8.9 kg @ $130/kg $ 1,160. 
 Conversion to U: 7.5 kg @ $11 83. 
 U235 Enrichment: 7.3 SWU @ $120 880. 
 Fuel Fabrication: per kilogram 240. 

  Total * $2,360. 
*source World Nuclear Organization (www.world-nuclear.org) 

 
It is clear from the foregoing analysis that the initial purchase price of U3O8 is only about half 
of the cost of the manufactured uranium fuel except in the case of heavy water reactors which 
do not require enrichment. 
  
Unlike some forms of power generation, power reactors can't usefully be throttled back to 
consume less uranium - they are operated at 100% output, and therefore energy utilities are 
mainly concerned about nuclear fuel supply rather than price risk.  Various estimates exist as 
to the impact of fuel costs on the economic viability of nuclear reactor, however there is a 
general consensus that costs would need to exceed $200 to $500 per pound U3O8 before 
sufficient negatively effects would be experienced to affect decisions regarding reactor 
construction.  It is estimated that a doubling of the U3O8 price from $70/lb to $140/lb would 
increase fuel costs from 0.75 cents per KWh to 1.05 cents per KWh.  In the current pricing 
environment this appears to allow sufficient room for uranium prices to increase significantly 
from present levels. 
 
Figure 25 shows the history of average annual Spot and Term Market prices for U3O8 
beginning in 1968.  The gap between term contract and spot prices reflects persistent 
oversupply during the 1970s and 1980s.  The difference between spot and contract prices was 
at its smallest during 1980.  It decreased temporarily in 1997 and again in 2004.  The historic 
and unusual decoupling of market price and metal inventories during the late 1970s as a result 
of government stockpiling programs was very different from more recent developments in 
uranium markets which, in 2006, saw virtually no surplus inventory available. During mid-
2007, spot prices were approximately $30 higher per pound of U3O8 than the term contract 
price, an inversion that WGM attributed to the absence of substantial quantities of new 
uranium available for long term supply, and thus a simple shortage of long term contracts to 
set a new benchmark price.

Figure 25 Graph of annual average Spot and Term U3O8 prices against actual price received by Canadian 

producers and the annual average oil price.  Data for 2013 is current averaged to mid-May.  Major 
incidents in the energy sector are shown symbolically.  Although NRCan no longer publishes 
realized price data, evidence suggests producers have been substantially protected from the post-
2008 volatility. 

 
 
The speculative participation of hedge funds in buying up the available uranium was widely 
seen as a catalyst to the 2006-07 price run-up.  Interestingly, as uranium prices recovered 
during the period November, 2010 through January, 2011, the spot and term prices again 
inverted with the discount price up to $5.00 more per pound than the $65 term price.  In this 
case, however, the term price rose to match and briefly exceed the discount price before the 
fall-off experienced in mid-March as a result of the tsunami in Japan. 
 
The following graph, Figure 26, shows the foregoing chart adjusted for inflation using the 
Canadian consumer price index and using 2006 dollars.  The peak average annual realized 
price by uranium producers achieved during 1980 was equal to approximately C$133 
(US$116) per pound of U3O8 in 2006 dollars, and was realized on the basis of contracts 
negotiated in previous years.  The sales prices achieved for 1980 came two years after the 
peak spot price.  The earlier negotiations occurred at a time when energy utility companies 
were deeply concerned about continuing price escalations.  It is, however, noteworthy that 
spot market activity at the time of delivery accounted for only a very small fraction of total 
market sales, thus not truly reflecting the amount of uranium actually available in the market 
from accumulating stockpiles.  It is also interesting that spot market activity did not 
significantly increase until into the third year of declining realized prices.

Figure 26: Average annual uranium and oil prices in constant 2006 US Dollars.  Note that the decline in 

realized prices to producers lagged the fall of market prices by approximately 3 years.  The peak 
price of $120 per pound of U3O8 experienced during 2007 remained below the inflation-adjusted 
highs realized during 1976 through 1979.  Also note the large disconnect currently between oil 
prices and uranium prices. 

 
 
Figure 26 demonstrates how having long term supply contracts generally resulted in domestic 
producers being well protected, at least initially, from the slide in uranium prices that 
occurred during the early 1980s.  The data also show that, despite the price drop following the 
tsunami-triggered Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, the average uranium price recovered 
from the initial shock well into 2011 before more recently falling off. 
 
While the underlying data is the same as that used for the foregoing chart, the profound 
effects of the inflationary 1970s and early 1980s can be easily seen.  The graph also shows 
that the price escalation in 2007 did not come close to the inflation-adjusted uranium price 
experienced in the 1970s.  This suggests that the current uranium price seen today is 
extremely inexpensive in historical terms and costly to producers in terms of lost revenue to 
offset production costs.  The graph supports WGM's view that the current pricing 
environment is unsustainable and that prices will sharply rise. 
 
Perceptions of the direction and extent of price movements differed in the early 1980s, and 
again in recent years, when viewed in the different currencies.  The current price of uranium 
must be adjusted somewhat because of the fluctuating value of the US dollar against some 
currencies.  The cost of reactor fuel should therefore be reviewed against a basket of 
currencies including the Canadian dollar, major European currencies, the Chinese Renminbi, 
the South Korean Won and the Japanese Yen.  While WGM has not carried out this type of

review, it nevertheless seems reasonable that in any real terms, currency price fluctuations 
have little impact on the uranium fuel operating costs of power reactors. 
 
At the same time as uranium demand is increasing, uranium mining projects are being slowed 
due to perceived social, political and capital risks.  The permitting process for new uranium 
mining projects in greenfield areas is notorious for its delays, so sharp increases in production 
are unlikely.  If the dynamics of the last uranium boom can be used as a model, lagging 
production will cause uranium prices to stabilize at a much higher price than has been seen 
recently.  Evidence from various sources was reported by the World Nuclear Association to 
show that $40 was a marginal producer price in 2010, illustrating that many producers were 
under stress at that time. 
 
Despite the knowledge that significant undeveloped uranium resources exist, serious 
shortages of U3O8 and reactor fuel have been forecast by commodity analysts.  This view is 
based on a multiplicity of reasons such as: 

• the long time-line between deposit delineation and mine permitting in most countries, 
driven in part by matters of corporate social responsibility, environmental impact 
mitigation and public resistance to uranium mining; 

• the politicization of decisions relating to the due course approval of uranium mining 
projects and pandering to often ill-informed public opinion; 

• legitimate environmental concerns in some areas centring on surface and groundwater 
contamination; 

• unreasonable restrictions on uranium mine development and outright bans on uranium 
mining in some jurisdictions (e.g. affecting the Coles Hill deposit16, Virginia, USA); 

• the relatively low grade of major uranium deposits in some areas or the technical 
challenges of underground mining (e.g. Cigar Lake, Saskatchewan); 

• infrastructure challenges in many uranium-rich provinces such as SW Africa, 
Mongolia and Kazakhstan; 

• resource sovereignty demands requiring production royalties that render the deposits 
uneconomic at anticipated prices; 

 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's ("EIA") May, 2012 annual 
report, the owners and operators of U.S. civilian nuclear power reactors purchased the 

                                                 
16  According to a Virginia Energy Resources (TSX-V VUI) corporate presentation, the Coles Hill deposit in 

Virginia, USA is estimated to contain a NI 43-101 compliant resource of 133 Mlbs of U3O8 at an average 
grade of 0.056% U3O8 (1.14 lbs U3O8/ton) using a 0.025% U3O8 cut-off.

equivalent17 of 58 Mlbs of U3O8 from U.S. and foreign suppliers during 2012, an increase of 
3Mlbs (5%) over the previous year, at a weighted‐average price of $54.99 per pound U3O8.  
The 2012 weighted‐average price represented an increase of 442% compared with the 2001 
weighted‐average price of $10.15 per pound U3O8.  Only 17% of the 2012 delivered uranium 
was of U.S. origin and this was purchased at a higher price of $59.44 per pound.  The uranium 
sourced from foreign sources accounted for 83% of deliveries at a weighted‐average price of 
$54.07 per pound of U3O8 with Australian and Canadian uranium together totalling 35% 
percent of the delivered amount.  Uranium originating in Kazakhstan, Russia and Uzbekistan 
accounted for 29% and the remaining 19% originated from Brazil, China, Malawi, Namibia, 
Niger, South Africa and the Ukraine.  During 2012, 14% of the U3O8 was purchased under 
spot contracts at a weighted‐average price of $51.04 per pound. According to the EIA, the 
remaining 86% was purchased under long‐term contracts at a weighted‐average price of 
$55.65 per pound of U3O8. 
 
While the current low prices have seen U.S. utilities increase their stockpiles from an average 
111.2 Mlbs U3O8 equivalent during 2008-2011 to 120.7 Mlbs in 2012, and increase of 8.6% 
according to EIA data, the inventory represents approximately 2.5 years consumption18 which 
is significantly less than the time required to discover and bring new deposits into production.  
According to the EIA, U.S. utilities have signed contracts for delivery during 2013 of a 
minimum of 45.9 Mlbs of U3O8 and a maximum of 48.8 Mlbs of U3O8 which will leave  the 
utilities with unfilled requirements totalling 8.8 Mlbs during 2013 for which purchases will be 
made on the Spot Market if inventories are not depleted.  The unfilled requirements currently 
total 17.6 Mlbs for 2014 and are approximately 125 Mlbs for 2018. 
 
Given the position of the US as the world's largest consumer of U3O8 and the benchmark set 
by its most recent U3O8 purchases, it is exceedingly difficult to believe that future uranium 
prices will pull back from their current levels.  Indeed, the evidence proves that the current 
Spot Market price has little to do with the average prices currently being realized by uranium 
producers.  During 2012, a period during with the Spot price averaged $48.81 and the Term 
Price averaged $60.58, U.S. utilities signed 34 new purchase contracts with deliveries in 2012 

                                                 
17  The equivalent uranium refers to deliveries of UF6, enriched uranium and other forms that are expressed in 

equivalent U3O8 form. 
18  According to the EIA, U.S. civilian utilities will consume approximately 50 Mlbs of U3O8 equivalent 

during 2013, far in excess of its domestic production of 4.15 Mlbs in 2012.  Market requirements are 
expected to be approximately 47.8 Mlbs in 2014, rising to 55.6 Mlbs in 2015 and averaging 50.6 Mlbs of 
U3O8 equivalent per year during 2016-2022.  Total U.S. production capacity is 27.6 Mlbs if all mines and 
in-situ leach capacity is included for current producers, projects on stand-by, deposits that are in 
development and new operations that are licensed but not yet operating.  



 
 

- 162 - 

of 12 Mlbs of equivalent U3O8 at a weighted‐average price of $55.16 per pound, 31 being 
Spot Market contracts and three being Term Market contracts.  The growing contract deficit 
experienced by U.S. utilities adds pressure to supply sources that will see significant pressure 
as the U.S.-Russia HEU agreement ends.  In this context, and with the looming threat of 
uranium shortages, Appia should experience a significantly higher price regime than exists in 
mid-2013 if the Spot Market price is falsely used as the sole commodity price indicator. 
 
Most uranium market watchers expect increased prices to bring new production into the 
market.  Respondents to a recent survey by the U.S. EIA identified reserves of only 51.8 Mlbs 
of U3O8 at prices of less than $30 per pound, however the reserves increased to 304 Mlbs at 
prices as high as $100 per pound of U3O8.  Notwithstanding hypothetical availabilities, RBC 
Capital Markets currently forecasts Term Market U3O8 prices rising to $75/lb in 2016, and an 
$80 price persisting beyond that to at least 2020.  CIBC Metals & Minerals have forecast 
Term Market prices for U3O8 during 2014 and in the longer term of $65 and $70, respectively.  
Market analysts Raymond James has forecast U3O8 prices to average above $60/lb in 2013, a 
hurdle that may currently seem unlikely, and prices in excess of $70/lb in 2014 and 2015 
before settling to $70/lb in the long-term.  In contrast, BMO Research has slowed the 
expected rate of restarts in Japan and increased secondary supplies due to excess enrichment 
capacity allowing the enrichment companies to underfeed their plants.  Reflecting the reduced 
demand projections for primary mined uranium, BMO Research has further delayed several 
start-up and expansion projects in Australia, Kazakhstan, Niger, Namibia and Tanzania.  The 
net impact is a slight increase in forecast near-term oversupply that results in BMO Research 
now expecting the turnaround in the uranium price to take longer than previously anticipated.  
It is now forecasting the uranium price to average US$52/lb U3O8 in 2014, down from 
US$70/lb previously and US$60/lb in 2015, down from US$70/lb previously.  BMO 
maintains a forecast of the uranium market entering a sustained deficit from 2018 onwards.  
Despite variances in the short term, there is a general consensus that the longer the uranium 
price recovery is forestalled, the steeper the recovery will be. 
 
 
19.4 RARE EARTH METAL PRICE OUTLOOK 
 
The search for REE deposits was energized by ever-increasing demand for these metals in a 
wide range of 'high-tech' applications.  China's decision to restrict exports of REEs to meet 
its own domestic needs initially caused price spikes, but at the end of 2011 and during 2012, 
prices fell.  Domestic consumption of rare earths in the United States (and imports) declined 
significantly in 2011 compared with that of 2010.  Owing to declining supply from China, 



 
 

- 163 - 

prices for most rare-earth products increased significantly in the third and fourth quarters of 
2011.  Consumption generally decreased for cerium compounds used in automotive catalytic 
converters and in glass additives and glass-polishing compounds; rare-earth chlorides used in 
the production of fluid-cracking catalysts for oil refining; rare-earth compounds used in 
automotive catalytic converters and many other applications.  Rare-earth metals and their 
alloys used in armaments and base-metal alloys also saw price declines. Consumption was 
more stable in lighter flints, permanent magnets, pyrophoric alloys, and superalloys, but 
decreased for yttrium compounds.  Demand remained stable for rare earths in many other 
applications, especially automotive catalytic converters, permanent magnets, and rechargeable 
batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles. 
 
Molycorp's rare-earth separation plant at Mountain Pass, California resumed operation in 
2007 and continued to operate throughout 2011 producing bastnäsite concentrates and other 
REE intermediates and refined products from mine stockpiles.  Molycorp commenced with its 
Project Phoenix in 2011, a plan to reopen mining operations and to build new processing 
facilities at the mine, and commenced new mining operations during 2012, returning the US 
to REE producer status (Figure 27).  Molycorp also acquired Canadian REE technology 
company, Neo Material Technologies, a leading REE fabricator with global operations 
including facilities in China.  The Molycorp processing plant at Mountain Pass was in 
operation in the first quarter of 2013.   US consumption however decreased 25% in 2012 over 
2011, partly due to substitution.  In it's 2013 1st quarter report, MolyCorp reported that it sold 
3,274 tonnes of REE product from its various global operations at an average sales price of 
US $44.71 per kilogram.  The product from the Mountain Pass Mine, of which approximately 
47% is Ce, 32% is La, 21% is Nd and Pr and less than 5% is other REOs, was sold at US 
$23/kg.  Although revenues were up 9% over 2012 levels, the company posted a net loss of 
$0.33 per share due to soft REE prices.  Molycorp plans to ramp up to the facility's initial 
planned annual run rate of 19,050 mt of REO equivalent by mid-year 2013 yet it is not 
forecast to develop profitability until 2015. 
 
The considerable excitement that gripped rare earth metal explorers, a relatively recent 
phenomenon, forced governments to suddenly assess the strategic importance of REEs to key 
industrial applications.  The Australian Government's review of national mineral activities for 
2009 does not mention a single rare earth project even though several major discoveries were 
moving towards production.  The Mount Weld Mine, owned by Lynas Corp., is now in 
production and the company's REO refinery in Malaysia is ramping up to an 11,000 tpa rate 
of REO production, to be doubled when its phase 2 program is commissioned later in 2013.

Figure 27:  Global REE production during the period 1983 through 2012. 

 
Global exploration efforts to develop rare earths projects surged in 2011, and investment and 
interest increased dramatically.  Economic assessments continued in North America at Bear 
Lodge in Wyoming; Diamond Creek in Idaho; Elk Creek in Nebraska; Hoidas Lake in 
Saskatchewan, Canada; Kipawa in Quebec, Canada; Lemhi Pass in Idaho-Montana; and 
Nechalacho (Thor Lake) in Canada's Nunavut Territory.  None of these deposits are thought 
to be on the verge of a production decision.  Economic assessments in other locations around 
the world include Dubbo Zirconia in New South Wales, Australia; Kangankunde in Malawi; 
Nolan's Bore Project in the Northern Territory, Australia, and at Steenkampskraal in South 
Africa.  Nolan's Bore is very similar to Mount Weld in respect to the balance of REEs, 
however, it is unlikely to enter production for some time yet. 
 
Most of the production growth, to the 133,000 tonnes produced in 2011 (110,000 t at this 
time), has resulted from increased output from China.  With the USA and Australia returning 
to REE production during 2012, any forecasts of future REE prices must incorporate the 
impact of increasing demand and alternative supplies in the global marketplace 
 
The major uses of the rare metals are summarized in Table 28.  In addition to the uses listed, 
REEs are also used in the defence industry in many applications including precision-guided 
munitions (smart bombs), rangefinder lasers and target designators, detection devices for 
underwater mines, communications, aircraft control mechanisms, high-temperature ceramics 
in jet engines, information displays, radar systems, coatings, optical equipment, sonar 
applications and in electronic counter measure technologies.

price peack experienced in early 2011.  The drops ranged from 75% to 85% in the case of Ce 
and La, respectively, to 58% in the case of Nd, 43% for Pr, 54% for Gd and 90% for Sm, the 
latter dropping from $91 per kilogram for samarium oxide to $9.00 per kilogram.  The decline 
for some heavy rare earth metals was less severe with Tb down 10%, but Y experienced a 
significant 83% drop in value.  Dysprosium and Eu experienced price increases of 2% and 
25%, respectively. 
 
During the early part of the decade, mineral economists and metals market forecasters 
predicted growth in REE demand that in reality has fallen short of expectations.  WGM 
believes this is largely due to the impact of the global financial crisis that initially affected the 
markets during late 2008 (and continues today).  As a result, metal demand declined in the 
west while Chinese growth continued more or less unaffected due to its population and 
growing economy.  India also contributed to increased demand.  The market has certainly 
grown, but clearly not as expected a few short years ago. 
 
On the supply side, the growth in demand was not balanced by increased supply.  Having 
been driven out of production by China's aggressive price cutting in the 1990s, evidence 
suggests that potential producers required time to explore new discoveries, establish 
resources, design new mining operations and secure the necessary operating permits to allow 
the mine to be constructed.  More recently, economic uncertainty has somewhat impeded the 
ability of companies to raise capital for projects.  As a result of the foregoing impacts, REE 
demand has slowly out-stripped supply and created an imbalance.  China, with approximately 
95% of global REE production as a result of its aggressive actions against competitors, is now 
faced with the possibility that it may not be able to satisfy its own fabrication demands.  Even 
less is its ability to meet the global supply shortage that it created.  During 2010, China 
reacted by reducing rare metals exports to Japan, a major manufacturer of products containing 
REEs, and REE prices reacted accordingly.  China remains confronted with the problem of 
balancing competing interests for the foreseeable future. 
 
The need for increased REE production has not gone un-noticed by the international mining 
community.  Typically, the junior mining sector was quick to respond to forecasts made a 
decade ago regarding the current situation.  Old projects and more recent discoveries have 
been revived, and fresh venture financing has been found to support renewed exploration 
projects.  Unfortunately, the financial crisis has negatively impacted several major REE 
projects that sought financing during the crisis.  Within the industry, it was recognized that 
the main beneficiaries of the supply imbalance would be the one or two companies that were 
the first into production.  That race was won by Molycorp, owner of the Mountain Pass Mine 



 
 

- 167 - 

in California and Lynas Corp. owner of the Mount Weld Mine in Western Australia.  At this 
time, investment has been slowed and Arafura Resources' Nolan's Bore REE mine 
developments are behind the schedule originally envisioned by its owners although bulk 
sampling, test concentrate production and pre-leach testing has been completed. 
 
Given the current price decline in REEs, it is doubtful that significant new production will 
commence anytime soon unless the deposit is significant enriched in heavy REEs or the REEs 
can be produced as a co-product with another metal that contributes significantly to the 
revenue stream.  The junior mining sector is poised to bring a handful of REE projects into 
production during the next decade, however a great amount of hyperbole has surrounded 
many of these projects to the affect that the economic realities are often obscured.  Clearly, 
some due diligence is needed by any investor or company interested in this mineral sector. 
 
China's minerals infrastructure that supports the production of rare earth metals is thought to 
be the world's strongest.  Previously, China's position was in the top three, with the other two 
comprising the United States and Japan.  However, in the last decade, China's output has 
soared, with the major effect of lowering prices and driving its competitors out of the market.  
In 2007, China was responsible for 96.8% of global rare earth metal production, most of 
which is from mines located in Inner Mongolia.  The Inner Mongolian Baotou Steel Union 
Co., Ltd. is the largest rare-earth metal manufacturer in China.  Even though about 42% of 
global REE resources and reserves are situated outside of China, its cheap labour and 
Government subsidies ensured that Chinese companies were well supported in respect to 
investing in new mines and processing plants during the 1980s.  This infrastructure included 
rare earth metals research and development laboratories that worked to undercut China's 
rivals.  In the early part of the 1990s, China could produce neodymium very inexpensively for 
the market, resulting in a price drop from $11.70 per kilogram in 1992 to $7.40 in 1996.  In a 
relatively short time, the REE market volume increased from 40,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) 
to 125,000 tpa.  For nearly 20 years, China has pursued a policy to make it the "OPEC of rare 
earth metals".  This goal is probably unachievable given the participation of the US and 
Australia as significant producers supported by REE off-take agreements. 
 
According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics (www.piie.com), China's rare 
metal industry could be characterized by what industry observers call "disorderly 
competition" and "price chaos".  Local firms have engaged in a price war leveraged on 
expanded production.  In 2008, China's annual smelting capacity for REE metal production 
exceeded 200,000 (short) tons, which at the time was more than double global demand.  In 
August, 2009, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a draft policy 



 
 

- 168 - 

recommending an annual export quota of 35,000 tons, improvement in mining and 
environmental practices and a potential ban on exporting five REEs seen to be in short supply 
and essential to China.  The goal seems to have been to consolidate the domestic industry and 
stabilize prices while trying to attract investment in downstream applications and fabrication. 
 
This "disorderly" competition from Chinese producers was the principle reason for the 
closing of the Mountain Pass Mine in California at which time overproduction killed the 
market and drove out higher cost producers.  A very different market exists at this time, 
especially since 2007, with China reducing its REE exports and potentially restricting the 
export of some metals entirely.  China has apparently pursued this policy for two reasons; 
firstly to assure itself of a supply of metals vital to its defence industries and manufacturing 
sectors, and secondly to pressure western manufacturers to establish production facilities in 
China.  The 22 September 2010 embargo of REE exports to Japan in retaliation for Japan 
seizing a Chinese trawler has caused ripple effects through the industry since Japan was 
completely reliant on Chinese sources for metals used in the production of REE magnets.  
Japan's position as a major supplier of magnets to the West has provoked the US Government 
to consider a bill to subsidize the revival of its domestic REE industry.  Due to the increased 
demand for REE metals, Molycorp Inc. has invested approximately $500M in the reopening 
of the Mountain Pass Mine.  Over the past decade, the United States has imported about 87% 
of its lanthanide metals from China.  This clearly will change with Molycorp's "mine-to-
magnets" strategy, including the expansion and modernization of its Mountain Pass 
processing facility and its acquisition of Neo Material Technologies.  Molycorp expects to be 
one of the world's most integrated producers of rare earth products, including oxides, metals, 
alloys and magnets. 
 
Several potential producers are advancing projects towards mining.  One is the Nechalacho 
Project at Thor Lake in the Northwest Territories 100% owned by Avalon Rare Metals Inc. 
("Avalon"), a Canadian junior company.  This deposit, known for more than 20 years, is 
emerging as a major undeveloped REE resource, however the project is challenged by its 
remote location and a lack of infrastructure.  Avalon has advanced the project with the view 
that it is enriched in HREEs, however in order of declining abundance the major metals are 
Ce, Nd, La, Y, Pr and Sa…..   Yttrium is the only HREE metal that is present in 
concentrations above 0.1%.  Nevertheless, the deposit is sizeable at 197 Mt averaging 1.24% 
LREETOTAL and 0.22% HREETOTAL.  Avalon has been well funded and has no debt.  Its plan, 
assessed through a recent scoping study by SNC-Lavalin, is to construct a separation plant 
with an intended production capacity of 25,000 tonnes per annum.  This plant capacity is 
intended to handle the presently contemplated production of 10,000 t/a from Nechalacho, any 



 
 

- 169 - 

future Avalon production increases, and process material from other potential future 
producers, especially those producing chemical precipitates rich in the heavy rare earths. 
 
An effort similar to that of Molycorp sees Rareco moving the past-producing 
Steenkampskraal Mine back towards production in South Africa with a target date a few years 
in the future.  At the same time Arafura Resources is working towards 10,000 t REE/year 
production from Nolan's Bore deposit. 
 
Japan, a major fabricator of REE-bearing goods, imports more than 10,000 tons of rare earth 
metals per year, while about a fifth of the country's total annual consumption is believed to 
enter the country through a thriving black import network, without which Japan would 
already be in a severe supply crisis.  China has been lowering its export quotas for rare earth 
metals by about 6% annually since the start of the decade, with Japan allotted only 38,000 
tonnes in 2009.  Toyota and Honda alone will consume about that quantity and experts in 
Australia have predicted a wider global supply crunch within three years as demand surges 
beyond existing refinery and extraction capacity.  In view of the importance of rare earth 
metals to its economy, the Japanese Government has initiated a search for alternative supply 
sources in Vietnam, Kazakhstan and elsewhere.  The Japanese government has encouraged its 
manufacturers to adopt a supportive role in the financing and development of REE projects 
that is not take-over oriented.  Japan's official development assistance (ODA) strategy calls 
for increased support for mining development in foreign countries, infrastructure development 
in the surrounding areas, active cooperation for technology transfer and protection of the 
environmental. 
 
Japanese companies that are actively seeking REE projects worldwide include the following: 

Sumitomo Corp. at inception, Sumitomo planned to produce REEs in 
Kazakhstan through a joint venture established with state-
owned nuclear power company Kazatomprom.  Using 
Kazatomprom's facilities, REEs will be removed from 
uranium ore left over after uranium has been extracted.  
Annual output was expected to reach 3,000 metric tons in 
2010 (slightly less than 10% of Japan's imports), however 
delays occurred resulting in a revised plan to export 1,500 
tonnes in early 2013.  The current status is uncertain. 

Toyota Tsusho Corp. plans to spend a total of 40 billion yen on natural resources 
development, mainly for rare earths, over the next five years. 
It intends to start extracting the metals from tin ore in 
Indonesia, and it is also considering developing mines in 
such countries as Mongolia. By expanding its rare-earth 
business, the firm hopes to secure stable supplies for 



 
 

- 170 - 

Japanese carmakers like Toyota Motor Corp. 

Marubeni Corp. will start recycling rare earths through a subsidiary. It hopes 
to develop efficient recycling technologies in preparation for 
four or five years down the road, when more hybrid cars will 
be scrapped 

Mitsubishi Corp. entered a partnership with Neo Material Technologies 
("NMT") of Canada to recover by-products such as 
dysprosium and terbium from the Pitinga tin mine in Brazil.  
The two companies intended to form a joint venture to 
acquire the rights to purchase at least 20% of the mine's 
output.  With the take-over of NMT by Molycorp, the status 
of this agreement is uncertain at this time. 

Mitsui & Co. plans to import a large volume of the rare metal from 
Canada. The move comes on the heels of the firm's 
investments in nickel and cobalt - other rare metals essential 
for manufacturing lithium-ion batteries. Mitsui has obtained 
exclusive sales rights to lithium produced at a mine that 
Canada Lithium Corp. owns in the Canadian province of 
Quebec. After shipping samples to potential customers, 
Mitsui plans to start importing around 2,000 metric tons of 
lithium a year from the mine in 2013 for sale to Japanese and 
South Korean manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries. 

 
The nature of the potential crisis over shortages in rare earth metals is more acutely voiced in 
Japan which is a major producer of the REE magnets used in everything from high-
performance electric motors to jewellery.  However, the anticipated shortage of REEs has not 
materialized principally because the magnitude of the demand is relatively small in terms of 
the number of mines that can satisfy global demand.  Efforts by China to dominate the market 
have resulted in some substitution of metals which has retarded demand growth.  In a recent 
article "The Coming Rare Earth Metals Crunch" the writers pointed out that the world 
demand for rare earth metals used in cell phones, hybrid cars, wind turbines and many 
electronic applications was over 110,000 short tons per year, and projected by the US 
Geological Survey to grow some 71% to 188,000 tons by 2012.  This growth did not 
materialize, in part due to the financial crisis.  Global demand has remained at approximately 
110,000 tonnes, and according to the USGS equal to about 0.1% of estimated global resources 
of 110 Mt.   There is clearly no shortage of REEs in general except for certain HREEs which 
are scarce.  The consumption of rare earth metals is expected to grow as the number of uses 
are found.  Each Toyota electric Prius motor requires 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of neodymium, and 
each battery uses 10 to 15 kg (22-33 lb) of lanthanum. That number will nearly double under 
Toyota's current plans to boost the car's fuel economy.  The degree to which future prices will 



 
 

- 171 - 

rally is uncertain.  What is certain is that the major producers have the ability to flood the 
market with many of the rare earth metals most in demand.  In the short term, refinery 
capacity may prove to have more of an influence on price than resource availability. 
 
 
19.5 ENVIRONMENTAL 
 
Uranium mineralization in the Elliot Lake area is relatively low grade and contained in highly 
indurated, conglomeratic host rocks.  At an average grade of 2 lbs of U3O8 per ton of ore, the 
production of one ton of uranium oxide produced 1,000 tons of mine tailings.  The 11 mill-
sites in the Elliot Lake area, with an average area of 230 acres, are estimated to contain a total 
of over 149.3 million tons of tailings (MNDM), which contain low concentrations of naturally 
occurring radioactive elements, including traces of uranium, thorium, radium and other heavy 
metals, especially iron derived from pyrite and pyrrhotite.  A significant amount of REEs is 
thought to be present in the tailings because only yttrium was commercially recovered as a 
by-product of uranium mining.  Radium decay emits the radioactive gas radon (Rn226) and 
other daughter products, such as bismuth (Bi222) and polonium (Po210), which are potential 
health hazards. 
 

Given the foregoing contents, it is clear that any future reclamation of tailings must be geared 
towards: 

• reducing direct gamma radiation from the impoundment area to essentially 
background levels, 

• reducing the radon emanation from the impoundment area to the surrounding 
environment; and, 

• stabilizing the tailings pile to prevent it from contaminating the groundwater through 
erosion, seepage, or water runoff. 

 
Finally, the tailings remedial action must eliminate or minimize the need for additional work 
during on-going monitoring and maintenance program following reclamation.  The two major 
concerns for tailings remediation involve covering the pile and stabilizing the embankment as 
the costs incurred by failure of the tailings cover or destabilization of the embankment can be 
substantial.  Groundwater problems resulting from the exit of contaminated water from an 
inadequately protected tailings pile are difficult to predict, and can be very costly to bring 
under control.  The presence of iron sulphides in the Elliot Lake tailings raises the concern of 
acid generation as a result of oxidative processes.  The tailings contain approximately 5% 
pyrite and minor pyrrhotite.  The oxidation of sulphides lowers the pH of the tailings and 



 
 

- 172 - 

results in enhanced leaching of radioactive metals and other trace heavy metals.  Potential re-
dissolution of radionuclides held as insoluble barium sulphate sludge, a precipitate removed 
during the control of radium with barium chloride, may also result from exposure to acid 
water.  For several decades, site remediation at Elliot Lake has successfully used a water-
cover option to prevent acid generation by excluding oxygen from the tailings while at the 
same time providing a barrier to radon evolution.  This approach requires that the tailings pile 
be uniformly levelled to eliminate the need for internal dikes, thus also reducing the risk of 
water release from internal dike failure. 
 
The restoration costs for decommissioned uranium mines in Canada are given in Table 29.  
These costs, particularly those associated with Blind River deposits (bolded) should serve as a 
guide to Appia in planning its approach to conventional mine development in the Elliot Lake 
area.  However, the possibility of using existing mine workings as a repository for tailings 
should be investigated.

In a meeting with the manager of the Ontario Ministry of the Environment ("MOE") office in 
Sault Ste. Marie on 15 May, 2007, it was reported to WGM that all of the former uranium 
mines in the Elliot Lake area have been decommissioned and all mining and supporting 
infrastructure have been removed from the sites.  The access roads to all sites are gated to 
prevent vehicular access.  The MOE also reported to WGM the following: 

• the Elliot Lake mine sites are under the administrative jurisdiction of the Canadian 
Nuclear Safety Commission ('NSC"), a federal body established for the regulation and 
monitoring of all infrastructure in Canada related to the nuclear industry; 



 
 

- 173 - 

• the environmental monitoring of the decommissioned sites falls within the mandate of 
the Joint Review Commission ("JRC") which is composed of representatives from the 
Ministry of Northern Development and Mines, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the 
MOE and two federal bodies – Environment Canada and the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans; 

• the NSC is the main driver in setting objectives for the JRC; 

• the MOE is aware that uranium exploration has been renewed in the Elliot Lake area 
and that considerable expenditures are being made in the search for new uranium 
deposits; 

• there are no land withdrawals in the Appia project area that would negatively impact 
Appia's  exploration plans; and, 

• subject to explorers meeting statutory requirements, completing the permitting process 
and gaining the required approvals, there are no current regulations or policies that 
would preclude a return to production of any of the decommissioned mines, or the 
mining of new deposits.

20.  DISCUSSION 
 
20.1 GEOLOGY 
 
The Elliot Lake uranium-REE deposits are paleoplacers within which the economic minerals 
are typically deposited in conglomerates at the base of a sedimentary cycle.  The host rocks 
are contained within the Quirke Lake Syncline, a major east-west trending fold structure 
located north of the town of Elliot Lake.  The deposits are stratabound, commonly occurring 
in stacked sheet-like bodies of quartz-pebble conglomerate.  Mineralization is mostly 
disseminated along bedding planes and the highest grades are associated with higher 
concentrations of pyrite and well packed quartz pebbles.  The weight of evidence suggests a 
sedimentary origin for the mineralization.  The district wide presence of brannerite (UTi2O6), 
the main economic mineral, and U-bearing phosphates such as monazite 
([Ce,La,Nd,U,Th]PO4), xenotime (Y-UPO4) and other rare earth minerals relates quite well to 
the weathering of a U-Th-REE enriched (granitic) source.  Pyrite and to a much lesser extent, 
pyrrhotite, are the main minerals associated with uranium, occurring as overgrowths on 
detrital pyrite grains and on uraninite grains altering to coffinite. 
 
The geology of the Appia claims and the Teasdale Deposit is well understood.  Additional 
drilling is needed and will predictably add to the REE and U resource base notwithstanding 
the limited impact of small dikes and structures which are present. 
 
 
20.2 EXPLORATION AND MINERAL RESOURCES 
 
No recent exploration has been completed in the Appia project area prior to 2006.  The last 
major historical exploration programs consisted of deep drilling by Kerr McGee from sites 
along the axis of the Quirke Lake Syncline.  The average hole length was approximately 
1,500 metres (5,000 feet).  The drilling succeeded in testing the uranium-bearing Matinenda 
Fm. at points scattered across the basin at a kilometre-scale spacing (or more).  The uranium-
bearing Lower Reef horizon generally averaging 1.0-1.5 lbs U3O8 per ton was consistently 
encountered – this is in keeping with the general tenor of the deeper mineralization that was 
mined during the later stages of Elliot Lake's mining history.  Most intersections contained a 
few narrow higher grading sections, commonly exceeding 3-4 lbs U3O8 per ton.

WGM drew the following conclusions detailed in Workman and Breede, (2011) based on the 
earlier exploration programs: 

1) Appia's airborne magnetic and MegaTEM electromagnetic survey showed the 
presence of various structures and dikes within the Quirke Lake basin, but its follow-
up IP survey failed to provide useful targets for drilling despite the recommendations 
of the geophysicist who interpreted the data.  No further surface geophysics (mag, 
EM, IP) was recommended by WGM; 

2) WGM's attempts, and subsequent attempts by Appia, to locate the casing of early 
drill holes were both successful in the Banana Lake and Teasdale areas, and some 
holes were used successfully by Appia in 2007 and 2008 to wedge deep secondary 
holes to allow confirmation of previous historical intersections; 

3) In the Teasdale Lake Zone, Appia's 2007-08 winter drilling confirmed historical 
intersections which were concentrated in an area west of Teasdale Lake; 

4) Appia's drilling on the Teasdale Zone allowed WGM to confirm the historical 
resource estimate of former Rio Algom Chief Geologist Doug Sprague as a valid 
expression of the amount of uranium in the Teasdale Zone; 

5) Appia's drilling enlarged the area previously known to contain uranium resources 
and provided the basis for a NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resources estimate, 
including those historical holes which WGM confirmed, comprising an Indicated 
Mineral Resource of 17.4 million tons (15.8 Mt) with an average grade of 1.10 lbs 
U3O8/ton (0.55 kg U3O8/t) and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 48 million tons (43.5 
Mt) at the same grade (Workman and Vasak, 2008); 

6) Appia's drilling formed the basis of a resource estimate for the Banana Lake Zone 
comprising Inferred Resources of 33.42 million tons (30.52 Mt) averaging 0.9 lbs 
U3O8/ton (0.45 kg U3O8/t), a grade that is 20% higher than the historical estimate of  
0.76 lbs U3O8 per ton – (Workman and Breede, 2011); 

7) Excluding historical holes for which REE assay data was lacking, and including 
assay data for the Upper Reef, the Intermediate Quartzite and the Lower Reef, WGM 
re-estimated the Teasdale Mineral Resources as follows in Tables 30 and 31.

8) WGM concluded that the value of the REEs present in the Teasdale Zone will largely 

vest in cerium, lanthanum, neodymium and yttrium which account for 86.3% of the 
total REEs present in the sample population at large. 

9) The commercial viability of REE mineralization was previously demonstrated by the 
historical recovery of yttrium as a by-product of uranium production at the Elliot 
Lake mines.  These operations proved that separate facilities were not required to 
leach the REEs, and that once in solution, yttrium could be easily recovered.  
However the mine operators ignored the other REEs because the market was 
adequately served by deposits elsewhere.  

10) Although the potential quantity and grade of a larger REE resource in the Teasdale 
Zone was conceptual in nature due to insufficient exploration, and inherent 
uncertainties exist that continuing exploration might not delineate a mineral resource, 
WGM concluded that the close association between REEs and U, as shown in Figure 
28, indicated good potential that the area of historical drilling largely excluded from 
the current Appia resource base would contain a significant REE resource, and that a 
simple linear extrapolation would indicate the potential for a resource of some 400 to 
450 Mlbs of total REEs in this historical area at an average grade of approximately 3 
to 4 lbs/ton.

11) The PEA announced by Pele regarding its Eco Ridge Project based on a 9,400 tonne 

per day operation producing 10.7 Mlbs of total rare earth oxides (REOs) and 24.9 
Mlbs of U3O8 over a 14-year mine life and having and internal rate of return of 47% 
could be used as a very approximate measure of the economic basis for pursuing the 
exploration of the Teasdale Deposit due to the similarities of the two projects.  A 
minimum thickness of 1.8 m produced an average thickness of 2.76 m for the main 
resource zone. 

12) The uranium production from all Elliot Lake mines totalled some 362 million pounds 
of U3O8 from approximately 167 million tons of ore predominantly by conventional 
room and pillar mining of the Lower Reef, generally with a mining height of 2.44 
metres19.  In most instances, the average height was not significantly greater than 
this.  WGM and Appia concluded that the discovery of significant REE 
mineralization in the Upper Reef constituted an excellent opportunity to develop a 
larger scale-lower cost underground operation utilizing larger equipment and an 
average mining height of approximately 9.7 metres. 

13) WGM concluded that the Teasdale Deposit was unconstrained by geological 
parameters or by exploration data, and strongly recommended additional diamond 
drilling in the amount of 15,405 m budgeted at $7 million.  WGM also recommended 
additional drilling on the Banana Lake Zone in the amount of 12,800 m budgeted at 
$7.6 million. 

14) The historical uranium resources present on the Appia claims, as follows,  which 
have not been confirmed by Appia, are not compliant with current statutory 
requirements under Canadian Securities regulation NI 43-101, but notwithstanding 
that fact, these estimates by Rio Algom totalling approximately 200 million pounds 
of U3O8 were based on actual mining experience and reasonable assumptions: 

Teasdale Lake Zone 17,458,200 tons at 1.206 lbs U3O8/ton (20,787,200 lbs) 
Gemico Block #3 Zone 42,800,000 tons at  0.38 lbs U3O8/ton (16,264,000 lbs) 
Gemico Block #10 Zone 20,700,000 tons at  0.75 lbs U3O8/ton (15,525,000 lbs) 
Banana Lake Zone 175,800,000 tons at  0.76 lbs U3O8/ton (133,608,000 lbs) 
Canuc Zone 7,000,000 tons at  1.86 lbs U3O8/ton (13,020,000 lbs) 

Total 263,758,200 tons at  0.76 lbs U3O8/ton (199,204,200 lbs) 

 
15) Based on the foregoing, WGM believes there is excellent potential for many of the 

zones to increase in size as the former estimates were highly constrained by the claim 
boundaries of the individual companies, a limitation that no longer exists on the 
Appia Property.  In light of Appia's recent work which shows economically 
interesting REE mineralization occurring in the Upper Reef in addition to what was 
mined previously, WGM believes this also contributes to the mineral potential. 

                                                 
19  The Lacnor Reef, also known as the Lower Reef, was the first conglomerate bed deposited above the 

basement and was generally thin and discontinuous.  In the Lacnor and Milliken Mines, it was mined at an 
average height of 2.44 m (8 ft.).  The Nordic Reef, an overlying conglomerate horizon, was the primary unit 
mined at all the four of the mines located in the Nordic Channel with an average height of 3.0 m (10 ft.).  At 
the Nordic Mine, mining exploited an upper conglomerate horizon known as the Pardee Reef with an average 
mining height of 1.5 m (5 ft.), but reaching thicknesses of 3.0 m (10 ft.) at the Stanleigh Mine. 



 
 

- 178 - 

16) In reviewing how low-grade underground uranium miners achieved success in such 
places as New Mexico, Appia should examine the potential cost savings of 
constructing a central processing facility in co-operation with other potential uranium 
producers in the Elliot Lake area.  Given the high capital cost considerations, and the 
obvious similarities of the ore, there would be obvious benefits if the operators could 
share the cost of processing infrastructure. 

17) Lastly, WGM determined that evidence indicated the presence of considerable, 
readily accessible thorium and REEs present in the tailings from the various Elliot 
Lake mines.  Notwithstanding the environmental, social and political challenges of 
opening the tailings sites to redevelopment, there are few technical challenges in 
leaching the metals from the tailings which are estimated to contain approximately 
0.87 lbs thorium oxide (ThO2) and 0.66 lbs REEs per short ton, much of it contained 
in the mineral monazite (Robertson and Steenland, 1960).  The 180 Mt of ore mined 
and processed would equate to approximately 155 Mlbs of ThO2 in tailings and 120 
Mlbs of REEs, however Prasad and Ruzicka (1992) report that the Denison mill 
recovered some of the thorium and REEs whereas the Rio Algom mill recovered 
very little if any, consequently the amount of contained metal will vary from site to 
site depending on the mine's head grade and the operator.  The value of the thorium 
is highly conditional, largely based on the future development of thorium reactors 
which have been discussed in scientific media since the 1970s, but as far as WGM is 
aware, India is the only country with an established research program.  Interestingly 
however, Canada's CANDU reactor can operate on blended uranium-thorium fuel 
cycles.  Despite the thorium reactor's many advantages, only an extreme shortage of 
uranium fuel would cause a significant technological shift in favour of thorium, and 
so the Elliot Lake thorium resource must be thought of in a long-term, perhaps very 
long-term, context.

21.  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
21.1 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 
 
Appia's exploration to date, carried out under the guidance of WGM, has been successful in 
confirming historical drill hole intersections in both the Banana Lake Zone and the Teasdale 
Zone.  Deep drilling has outlined a NI 43-101 compliant resource in the Banana Lake area 
that is higher grading than previously indicated by historical drilling.  However, it is in the 
Teasdale Zone underlying the western portions of Quirke Lake where Appia's shallower 
drilling has both confirmed and enlarged a historical resource (Tables 32 and 33).

In addition to Lower Reef horizon which has been the main zone mined in the past, the 
discovery of an Upper Reef in this area has allowed Appia to build resource blocks taking in 
both reefs and averaging 9.7 m in thickness.  Compared to the historical average thickness of 
approximately 2.4 m, the potential for renewed mining on this scale allows for larger scaled 
equipment than was used in the past and the economies of scale that can be accomplished as a 
result. 
 
The current Mineral Resources take in both uranium and rare earth element mineralization 
and is based on the six holes totalling 2,650.2 m (8,695 ft) completed by Appia in 2008-09 
and the drilling completed during 2012 which totalled 8,130.2 m (26,673 ft), including 16 
holes from surface, one wedged hole and one abandoned hole.  The current resources do not 
take in some historical Conecho drill holes in the area that do show uranium mineralization, 
but fail to report grades in the Upper Reef (which was not sampled and analysed), and fail to 
report any assays for REEs. 
 
The in-fill drilling to date indicates that it very likely that additional drilling will continue to 
enlarge the zone as well as converting most of the Inferred Resources to Indicated Resources.  
This is a reflection of the relatively uniform character of the stratabound mineralization. 
 
The Elliot Lake uranium deposits can be a major co-producer of REEs, and the value of the 
REEs must be incorporated into any economic model used to evaluate the Teasdale deposit.  
The international market for rare earth metals has increased markedly in the last decade due to 
the advent of new technologies in which REEs play a small but vital role.  China's position as 
the preeminent producer of REEs derives from a combination of official producers which 
account for 98% of global production and illegal miners (black-market producers) which 
account for an uncertain amount of production.  China has acted to shut down illegal 
operators and curb the environmental impact of official producers while at the same time 
restricting exports.  The net effect has been a significant decrease in China's supply of REEs 
to the global market which is probably on the order of 110,000 to 120,000 tonnes of REEs 
annually, and relatively stable over the past few years.  What were initially strong increases in 
REE prices due to the fear of shortages has morphed into what appears to be a well-supplied 
market in the LREEs due to a return to production of US and Australia, and an under-supplied 
market for many of the HREEs.  While it is unlikely that REE prices will re-gain the highs 
seen in recent years, the current prices in mid-2013 suggest a degree of supply-demand 
stability that should allow Appia an acceptable level of certainty for planning purposes. 
 
The current and future global consumption of uranium by nuclear power reactors is 
measurable and predictable, and based on current data, a shortage of uranium for reactor fuel 



 
 

- 181 - 

is forecast for the near future.  The higher uranium prices which are a natural outcome of any 
mineral shortage projects like Appia's which have are well located in respect to infrastructure. 
 
Without doubt, the Elliot Lake deposits offer the potential for a stable, long term supply of 
uranium oxide and rare earth metals.  WGM believes that the world will not indefinitely 
ignore the presence of more than 200 million pounds of readily extractable uranium remaining 
in the Elliot Lake deposits, and many times that in terms of rare earth metal content.  
 
 
21.2 MINERAL PROCESSING 
 
It has been demonstrated that the uranium and REE mineralization are interrelated and can be 
mined without changes to the basic mining plan.  The metallurgy of Elliot Lake uranium 
mineralization is well known in respect to its milling and leaching characteristics, including 
the application of bacteria leach technology to uranium.  Evidence based on the historical 
recovery of yttrium proves that REE recovery can utilize much of the same processing 
technology as that used for uranium production. 
 
Based on the preliminary metallurgical testing, the favoured flowsheet option includes a 
simple grind, a flotation process to recover a high grade concentrate, acid baking of the 
flotation concentrate and acid leaching of the flotation tailings with the total recovery levels 
expected from a 36-hour whole ore leach on finely ground ores as shown by the green line in 
Figure 29 together with the test results from other flowsheet trials.  This approach can result 
in a high extraction of U (~90%) and most REEs (80-90%) from Appia's Teasdale U-REE 
deposit.  It is believed that planned additional testwork and data analysis will substantiate 
these data and probably lead to reduced overall processing costs and improved recovery. 

Figure 29:   Green line illustrates recoveries for the favoured 
processing option compared to whole ore leaching

21.3 OTHER PROJECT FACTORS 
 
Being located in a brownfields area that has been impacted by a long history of uranium and 
REE mining and production, and characterized as brownfields project, the Appia project 
should be more easily permitted than any similar greenfields project.  The Appia project also 
has additional positive attributes such as: 

1) the previous mining has demonstrated that uranium tailings can be stabilized and 
managed such that the impacts are successfully mitigated without serious adverse 
consequences for the local environment; 

2) Appia's Teasdale Deposit is close to the Cameco uranium refinery situated west of 
Elliot Lake near the town of Blind River; 

3) the mineralization is stratabound with excellent lateral grade and thickness 
continuity; 

4) the associated REE production is another potential revenue generator that could 
exceed the value of uranium production; 

5) mine rock conditions were favourable for underground development and their 
engineering properties are well understood; 

6) the average thickness of the deposit is approximately 3 times greater than the average 
thickness mined in the past which should result in commensurate reductions in 
mining costs; 

7) Appia bears no responsibility for potential environmental legacy issues in the future 
arising out of previous mining activities; 

8) other companies delineating new uranium and REE resources in the area, such as 
Pele Mountain Resources, as well as companies such as Denison Mines and Rio 
Algom which continue to hold significant Mineral Resources, may present 
opportunities for joint mill ownership or toll milling; 

9) proximity to the Panel Mine which offers the potential for shaft revitalization and 
underground openings for mine infrastructure as well as in-stope leaching and waste 
disposal; 

10) the project is located in Ontario, Canada, in an area that has a long mining tradition 
and in an investor-friendly jurisdiction that supports flow-through financing; 

11) a hard-working and knowledgeable local labour force lives in northern Ontario; 
12) excellent year-round project access and close to major supply centres; 
13) the property is large, extending over an area adjacent to and down-dip of former 

mine workings; and, 

14) the potential to develop a large scale thorium resource (+REEs) from Elliot Lake 
tailings is a potential future consideration since India and some other countries are 
now working on the engineering challenges of using thorium fuel. 

 



 
 

- 183 - 

WGM previously determined though its discussions with government representatives in Sault 
Ste. Marie, there are no impediments in the mining and environmental statutes that would 
constitute fatal flaws to the Appia project.  There are no land withdrawals in the Appia project 
area that would negatively impact Appia's exploration plans.  However, it is clear that the 
new Ontario Mining Act imposes on Appia a duty to consult with local stakeholders prior to 
undertaking advanced exploration programs which would include diamond drilling.  Recent 
changes in the Mining Act are intended to avoid future conflicts, and do not impose a need for 
Appia to give up any of its mineral rights.  Local stakeholders are expected to discuss any 
concerns in good faith and not un-necessarily impede exploration. 
 
In its previous discussions with local mining engineer, Bob MacGregor who has been active 
with Pele Mountain Resources, WGM understands that the residents of Elliot Lake and its 
Chamber of Commerce are intensely interested in the new jobs and tax revenue that renewed 
mining would bring to the town.

22.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
22.1 EXPLORATION 
 
It is clear that the 2012 in-fill and step-out drilling on the Teasdale Deposit has enjoyed a high 
degree of success in confirming the resources where they were predicted by the geological 
model.  Inferred resources were up-graded to Indicated Resources and additional resources 
were defined.  Appia should continue its drilling of the deposit in accordance with the general 
provisions of the previous recommendations which envisioned a total of 39 diamond drill 
holes totalling 15,405 m.  Of this, Appia has completed 16 holes totalling 8,130.2 m (26,673 
feet), and effectively generated intersections at 14 of the points previously recommended.  
Appia's drilling included some areas not previously recommended, however with positive 
results, these have contributed to the mineral resources in areas that were originally thought to 
have lower priority. 
 
WGM's original drilling program envisioned winter operations to facilitate drilling from ice 
platforms.  Appia has recently used a barge to move the drill between sites and demonstrated 
the ability to produce representative and useful intersections from the same drill set-up.  In 
this context, WGM has reconfigured its drilling proposal to account to the exploration results 
to date, to reflect the use of a barge for drill moves and to reduce the number of drill moves by 
using the same site to "cone-drill"  drill multiple holes from the same set-up in much the same 
manner as underground drilling is designed.  The relatively shallow dip of the mineralized 
horizons (reefs) allows a significant amount of flexibility regarding drilling angles and drill 
hole bearings.  As an example, whereas drilling down dip is generally frowned upon as it can 
produce unrepresentative and misleadingly long intersections, drilling down dip at -70° on the 
Teasdale Zone produces an intersection angle of 50° which is within the range of what would 
be considered "acceptable". 
 
WGM recommended drill sites and hole orientations have been confirmed through 3D 
computer modelling.  WGM's proposal for the next drilling program follows in Table 34. 
 
The locations for the drill holes proposed in the next (2014) drilling program are shown in 
Figure 30.  The proposed drilling is predominantly intended to add Inferred Resources to the 
Appia project rather than to up-grade Inferred Resources to Indicated Resources.  Some up-
grading will occur as a natural consequence of the overlapping of spheres of drill hole 
influence.  An increase in mineral resources will allow for better project planning insofar as a 
future NI 43-101 compliant preliminary economic assessment is concerned because the 
inclusion of Inferred Resources are allowed in such studies whereas higher level feasibilities 



 
 

- 185 - 

are only permitted to use Indicated and Measured Resources.  Appia understands that 
additional in-fill drilling will be required in the future to support feasibility-level studies. 
 
A budget for the drilling is provided in the following section based on the experience gained

All drill core must be logged and analysed for U and REEs in accordance with established 
industry practices.  Core recovery has been excellent to date at 95% or better.  In respect to 
the additional cost of down-hole radiometric surveying, WGM does not see a significant 
technical advantage in down-hole spectrometer logging over the use of a hand-held 
spectrometer on the drill core, however down-hole surveying should be used if core 
recoveries are less than optimal.  All drill core samples should be analysed for uranium using 
a solvent (acid) extraction process rather than by neutron activation analysis which measures 
total contained uranium rather than leachable uranium.  All samples should be analysed for 
REEs using a conventional technique and for trace elements using an ICP-based multi-
element technique.

22.2 METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
In light of the encouraging results that have come from the most recent components of the 
metallurgical testing program carried out by SGS Lakefield, additional testing is 
recommended to focus on the preleach and acid bake testing of the flotation concentrate.  
Additional testing should address uranium and REE recovery to identify and design the most 
logical processing option to extract the metals from the leached slurry. 
 
 
22.3 MINERAL ECONOMICS 
 
Appia should undertake a preliminary economic assessment as soon as the metallurgical 
testing program establishes a well defined flowsheet for the processing of Teasdale ore. 
 
The supply and demand fundamentals of the uranium market are dynamic, but subject to 
easily quantified measurements since the nuclear fuel demands of power reactors can be 
forecast based on electrical generating capacity.  Like new uranium mines, reactors also 
require considerable time for planning and construction and this allows surpluses and deficits 
in uranium markets to be forecast with a high degree of certainty relative to other mineral 
commodities.  Nevertheless, uranium deposits are becoming increasingly difficult to find, and 
the permitting of such deposits is requiring longer and longer lead times.  If past experience is 
a measure, uranium fuel fabricating infrastructure is likely to lag mine output.  Over the 
longer term, key factors will be substantially increased demand due to new reactor builds 
balanced against increasing production from Australia and Kazakhstan, and new production 
coming from countries such as Mongolia that had little or no output in the past.  As a medium 
term goal, Appia should undertake a detailed review of the uranium industry to ensure its 
understands the market as it is foreseen to develop in the next two decades. 
 
The recent findings of the World Nuclear Association, which meets every two years (most 
recently in September 2011), should be taken as a guide to overall plans, however in this 
period of great economic turmoil, the forecasts of most experts contain a wide area of 
uncertainty between high market and low market scenarios.  WGM is uncertain whether the 
current findings are useful in this economic climate, and so Appia's economic study should be 
completed no sooner than the 2013 year end. 
 
 
 



 
 

- 188 - 

22.4 PUBLIC DIALOGUE 
 
Appia must act proactively to ensure that its activities are consistent with government 
regulations and policies.  Appia should open direct contact with the Elliot Lake Joint Review 
Commission and its constituent members, the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and 
Mines ("MNDM"), the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, the Ontario Ministry of the 
Environment, the (Federal) Environment Canada and the Federal Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans. 
 
The new Ontario Mining Act came into force in early 2013.  The new law and its regulations 
do not directly affect Appia's mineral rights or land tenure rights.  However, as stated 
previously in Workman and Breede (2011), the new law includes sections mandating that 
Appia file an Exploration Plan ("EP") with the MNDM and consult with First Nations ("FN") 
representatives prior to executing its exploration plans.  Upon receipt of the EP, the MNDM 
which will place Appia in touch with the relevant FN representative who will review the plan 
in respect to its impact on the FN.  It is unclear how this will affect Appia's exploration 
activities, however all diamond drilling work must be the subject of an EP and a 30-day 
review period.  The law and its attendant discussion papers also state that FN do not have a 
right of refusal insofar as approving or disapproving the EP or by holding Appia hostage to 
negotiating an interest in the mineral rights held by the company.  The intent of the 
"consultation" is to ensure that Appia and the FN are aware of each other's concerns and that 
Appia has the opportunity to mitigate impacts.  Many exploration companies have found a 
ready and willing workforce in the FN communities close to the exploration site.  As Appia's 
work is mainly drilling in brownfields areas that are not treaty land or land subject to a land 
claim, WGM understands that very little consultative work is actually required, however 
Appia's management should familiarize itself with the new laws.  First Nations ("FN") 
communities are located in watersheds down-stream from the former mining operations.  
Early consultation is recommended with FN representatives to ensure an inclusive rather than 
exclusive dialogue.  Marginalizing this community may spawn groups that are especially 
resistant to uranium mining.  Appia should develop an open dialogue with Pele Mountain 
Resources which may be in the same situation in respect to its nearby project.  Future 
development planning will require that Appia study the implications of new law and, if 
deemed necessary, engage suitable counsel to give it guidance relevant to its planning 
process. 
  
As the Elliot Lake mine sites are under the administrative jurisdiction of the Canadian 
Nuclear Safety Commission ('NSC"), Appia should also contact this federal body to ensure 



 
 

- 189 - 

that its activities are known to those responsible for overseeing the regulation and monitoring 
of the Elliot Lake nuclear infrastructure, and for setting objectives for the Joint Review 
Commission. 
 
 
22.5 OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
WGM tenders the following recommendations which have been numbered for convenience. 
 

1) The uranium and REE Mineral Resources of the Teasdale Deposit should be up-
dated after the recommended drilling is completed. 
 

2) An attempt should be made through Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) archives 
and other sources including library records (microfiche and digital records) to 
assemble a complete production and exploration history for the Elliot Lake camp.  
This should include purchasing copies of all published books, reports and other 
information on the history of Elliot Lake. 

 
3) Additional work needs to be done to precisely determine the locations for new drill 

sites to test and enlarge the Banana Lake Mineral Resources.  A budget for 
approximately 10-15,000 m of drilling is needed to adequately test the Banana Lake 
Zone.  This drilling should be staged in accordance with a long-term plan, but 
Banana Lake drilling is considered to be a second priority task at this time with 
Teasdale Zone drilling considered to be a first priority.  However, as Appia's drilling 
to date has essentially confirmed the viability of the historical estimate made by Rio 
Algom, there is clear potential for defining nearly 200 Mlbs of U3O8 in this zone.  

 
4) Where practical in the Banana Lake Zone, the redrilling of the existing Kerr McGee 

holes and wedging from such holes is justified as a means of quickly and cost-
effectively building a uranium resource base in some areas of the Appia property.  
During 2008, Appia has enjoyed some success in pursuing this approach.  Wedging 
off-hole at a distance of 500 m above the Matinenda Formation should produce 
additional intersections at least 50 m away from the initial pierce point.  By using 
multiple wedged holes in this way, the variability of mineralization can be tested and 
the resource potential assessed at a significantly lower cost that redrilling from 
surface. 

 



 
 

- 190 - 

5) The feasibility of using the existing abandoned Panel Mine workings for the disposal 
of waste rock, tailings or any other purpose largely hinges on whether they are 
assessable which in turn depends on the means of access and whether they are dry or 
flooded.  The question needs to be answered as a necessary component of any future 
feasibility-level study. 

 
6) A dialogue should be initiated with Pele Mountain Resources to explore the 

feasibility of constructing a central milling and processing facility for Elliot Lake 
ores as a means of improving the economic viability of individual projects.  All 
discussions would necessarily be contingent on the discovery of a resource base of 
sufficient size and grade to justify a production decision. 

 
7) A dialogue should be initiated with government authorities to determine how best 

Appia can carry forward its exploration on certain of its claims that now have 
restricted access due to on-going impact mitigation work, and are thus subject to 
restrictions on surface activities.

23.  PROGRAM BUDGET 
 
In the past, WGM has recommended a staged exploration program that, over time, has 
minimized risk by building slowly from the established facts concerning the historical work.   
This began with Appia's early drilling of the Teasdale and Banana Lake Zones, its follow-up 
work on the mineralogy of the uranium-bearing zones, its identification of associated REE 
mineralization, the re-estimation of the Teasdale mineral resources based on a combination of 
current and historical data, and finally, Appia's recent drilling on the Teasdale Zone which 
has substantially increased the Mineral Resources and increased the level of confidence 
overall in the project. 
 
WGM proposes a budget of C $7,153,000 for a multi-year exploration project according to 
the following budget (Table 35).  WGM believes that this exploration is justified based on the 
positive results of Appia's exploration programs completed to date, however, the 
recommended program is divided into first and second priority drilling programs: a high 
priority 14-hole (7,750 m) program on the Teasdale Zone and a lower priority multi-phase 
(17,600 m) program on the Banana Lake Zone comprising 8 deep holes from surface and 8 
wedged holes.  In carrying out this work, drilling on the Teasdale Lake Zone offers Appia the 
greatest potential for adding value to the project in the form of NI 43-101 compliant uranium 
and rare metal Mineral Resources.  WGM has also included a secondary budget for additional 
public consultations, contracted metallurgical testing, data acquisition, a preliminary 
economic assessment based on an up-dated Mineral Resource estimate and a new technical 
report compliant with NI 43-101 (Table 36).  
 
The proposed exploration work will substantially exceed Appia's needs insofar as exploration 
assessment requirements are concerned.  All costs are in Canadian dollars.    To place this 
budget in context, it represents an investment of less than 10 cents (Canadian $0.10) per 
pound of historical uranium oxide resources on the Appia exploration property if the previous 
estimates of Rio Algom and others can be shown to be correct.  It represents an investment of 
16 cents per pound (Canadian $0.16) per pound of uranium oxide resources currently outlined 
to NI 43-101 standards on the Appia Property. 
 
Although it is of secondary interest at this time, the proposed Banana Lake drilling, 
comprising 8 deep drill holes and 8 wedged holes, is required to test the northerly, westerly 
and south-easterly extensions of mineralization originally discovered by Kerr McGee and 
recently confirmed by Appia.  For planning purposes, three phases of drilling are proposed for 
budgetary and cash flow reasons.  This program should be executed in a flexible manner that 



 
 

- 192 - 

is responsive to actual results.  Drill hole locations do not significantly influence length, but 
certainly may influence overall results in respect to uranium contents.  Careful attention to the 
geology of the uranium-bearing zones (reefs) is required.  In some areas, the hole locations 
may allow for slightly shallower uranium intersections as the zone is traced to the north and 
away from the centre of the basin, but drill site elevation (above sea level) will probably have 
a greater impact on hole length.  A budget is also provided for wedging off the new holes to 
allow Appia to develop additional cuts through mineralization using the original hole as a 
pilot.  These wedged holes can be used to demonstrate grade and thickness continuity.

In respect to drilling the Teasdale Lake Zone, WGM has previously recommended that 
Appia's exploration program be staged so that, over time, risk can be minimized by building 
slowly from the established facts concerning the historical work.  A program of 14 diamond 
drill holes (7,750 m) is proposed on approximate 200-400 m spacings to enable delineation of 
additional Inferred Resources for uranium and REEs while allowing for some up-grading of 
Inferred Resources to the Indicated category20.  All of the proposed holes are located on the 
shoreline of Quirke Lake, or inland.  The locations of certain holes may be amended or 
eliminated as the drilling progresses, however, the overall amount of drilling should not vary 
significantly from that proposed herein. 
 
The obliquely angled holes recommended in the table with shoreline set-ups are intended to 
replace holes that would otherwise have to be drilled from winter ice.  Some of the proposed 
drilling could be accomplished during the winter using ice platforms as soon as the winter ice 
thickens to the point where it will can support a work crew.  While this might provide for 
greater flexibility in drill hole locations, and provide for some cost savings in terms of 
reducing hole lengths, additional costs would be incurred for helicopter support and 
controlling the environmental impact of run-off from the drilling fluids which otherwise 

                                                 
20  It must also be noted that the confidence level of Mineral Resources, as defined under NI 43-101, is also dependent on 

market forces, especially the Term Market.  WGM does not view Spot Market activity as relevant in the context of the 
Appia Project. 



 
 

- 194 - 

would drain directly into the lake.  A budget of $120,000 would also be required for the 
labour involved in flooding and maintaining the ice. 
 
On-going exploration should be directed at developing a separate budget for confirmation of 
uranium resources in other mineralized zones such as the Canuc Zone and in the Gemico 
Zones.  In WGM's view, an initial budget for 2,000 to 3,000 m of drilling costing 
approximately $750,000 to $1.5 million would be appropriate for such purposes.  Future 
drilling on Gemico Block 3 will require approval from the federal Nuclear Safety 
Commission to allow Denison to grant Appia the right to drill.  As the area of interest is 
located near a major road, and is not in an area of tailings or other former mine infrastructure, 
WGM foresees no reason why such approval would be denied. 
 
The project is ambitious and it requires favourable uranium market conditions, but it is 
prefaced on what WGM believes is an excellent opportunity to revitalize an area that has been 
long overlooked.  If the outcome of the on-going drilling in the Teasdale Zone is positive, 
continued in-fill and step-out drilling down-dip will be required to up-grade the confidence

Executive Summary 

A scoping level beneficiation study was conducted on samples from the Teasdale property located in the 

Elliot Lake area, Ontario, at the request of Watt, Griffis and McOuat Limited on behalf of Appia Energy 

Corp. The purpose of the study was to identify a processing route that could recover the majority of the 

uranium, thorium and rare earth bearing minerals while rejecting a significant amount of the major gangue 

mineral quartz. The beneficiation study consisted of head sample chemical analysis, mineralogical 

characterization, gravity separation, magnetic separation and flotation testing. 

The summary head assays for the four test composites are shown in Table 1. 

 
Table 1: Head Assay Summary 

 
 

A QEMSCANTM mineralogical examination indicated that the major phases present in these composites 

were quartz (63.8-67.4%), K-feldspars (12.2-16.8%), micas (9.6-12.6%), and pyrite (2.6-10%). Electron 

Microprobe Analysis (EMPA) revealed that the main Rare Earth Element (REE)-bearing minerals were 

monazite and allanite, and the U-Th minerals included uranothorite-thorite [(Th,U)SiO4], altered uraninite 

(UO2), and coffinite [U(SiO4)1-x(OH)4x] . The monazite is generally over 60% free and liberated but the 

allanite has more complex particles at 100% passing 100 mesh (150 µm). The U-Th minerals are 

generally poorly liberated but they are moderately to well exposed. 

A Bond ball mill grindablity test was performed at 100 mesh (150 µm) and showed that the Master 

Composite was moderately hard with a metric work index of 16.2 kWh/t. 

Metallurgical testwork included gravity separation, magnetic separation and flotation. Gravity separation 

using a Mozley Shaking Table on a sample that was 80% passing 208 µm demonstrated U, Th and REE 

upgrading. The combined Mozely gravity concentrates recovered 52% U, 61% Th and 59% Total Rare 

Earth Element (TREE) in 7% mass. A significant amount of U, Th and TREE losses was found to deport 

in the -38 µm fraction of the gravity tailings. The combined Mozely gravity concentrate and -38 µm of the 

gravity tailings recovered 75% U, 81% Th and 79% TREE in 26% mass. A finer grind resulted in similar 

results. 

Gravity separation using the Wilfley Table to evaluate the amenability of the Gekko IPJ was completed. A 

specific procedure, Gekko 296A, was provided by the client and followed. The results demonstrated

possible gangue rejection at a coarse size. The combined Wilfley concentrate and the slime recovered 

77% U, 84% Th and 78% TREE in 36% mass. The Gekko IPJ was not recommended as a pre-

concentration method because the client reviewed the results and determined the recovery of U and REE 

was below their target. 

Wet High Intensity Magnetic Separation (WHIMS) at 2,000 to 20,000 Gauss on a sample that was 80% 

passing 208 µm was performed. The cumulative magnetics recovered 61% U, 74% Th and 78% TREE in 

9% mass. Further scavenging of the non-magnetics by flotation would likely improve recovery. A finer 

grind did not improve the WHIMS results. 

Flotation flowsheet development was carried out on the Master composite. Variability testing on the 

Lower Reef (LR), Upper Reef (UR) and Intermediate Quartzite (IR) composites were completed using the 

conditions established with the Master composite. The best results on the Master composite were 

achieved in F6 using collector LR19. The F6 rougher concentrate recovered 79% U, 92% Th and 92% 

TREE in 20% mass. Results of variability flotation tests (F9, F16 and F17) and F6 are shown in Table 2. 

Table 2: Variability Flotation Comparison 

 
 

Pyrite removal prior to U-Th-TREE flotation as well as on a leached residue was completed. Greater than 

90% S was removed in either approach. 

Recommendations for future work include: 

 Investigate the effects of desliming; 

 Investigate collector type – FA2 in place of LR19; 

 A combination of gravity or magnetic separation and flotation.

Introduction 

A proposal for mineralogical, beneficiation, and hydrometallurgical testwork on quartz pebble 

conglomerate samples from the Elliot Lake area was issued on October 16th, 2012 and approved the next 

day. The scope of beneficiation testwork consisted of gravity separation, magnetic separation and 

flotation. The testwork was initiated in December, 2012 and was carried out over the following three 

months with the objective of assessing the recoverability of uranium, thorium and rare earth elements. 

This report presents the beneficiation testwork results. 

The test program was conducted under the direction of Mr. John Goode on behalf of Watts, Griffis and 

McOuat Limited and Appia Energy Corp. Results were provided to him for review and guidance as they 

became available.

Testwork Summary 

1. Sample Receipt and Preparation 

A total of five shipments were received at the SGS Lakefield site from October to November 2012. The 

first and second shipments were assay rejects from Actlabs and the client decided not to use them for 

testwork after reviewing the inventory list. The 3rd to 5th shipments were ¼ drill core samples containing 

30.8 kg, 55.3 kg and 78.4 kg of material with assigned internal receipt number 0059-Nov12, 0081-Nov12 

and 0158-Nov12, respectively. Table 3 summarises the information of received samples. 

Table 3: Inventory of As-Received Sample 

 
 

The sample preparation flowsheet is presented in Figure 1. Three composites representing Upper reef 

(UR), Intermediate quartzite (IQ) and Lower reef (LR) were separately sorted out from the 3rd to 5th 

shipments. Each Composite was combined, homogenized and stage-crushed to 100% passing 6 mesh 

(3.35 mm) and 500 g was riffled out followed by further splitting for head assay, mineralogical 

examination and for bio-leaching amenability test. The Master Composite (MC) was composited from 31.4 

kg UR, 16.5 kg IQ and 16.5 kg LR. It was combined, homogenized and rotary split into 2 kg test charges. 

The remaining 51.8 kg UR, 27.1 kg IQ and 27.1 kg LR Composites were reserved separately for 

variability testwork.

The head samples of three composites were stage-crushed to 100% passing 100 mesh (150 µm) and 

screened into three size fractions (+75, -75/+38 and -38 µm) for mineralogical study. The detailed 

QEMSCAN results are issued in a separate SGS report (CALR-13849-002-MI5007-Dec12) and only the 

main findings are highlighted here. 

The modal analyses obtained for each composite are presented in Table 5 and graphically shown in 

Figure 2. All three samples (LR Comp, UR Comp and IQ Comp) are composed of quartz (63.8-67.4%), K-

feldspars (12.2-16.8%), micas (9.6-12.6%), pyrite (2.6-10%), along with minor to trace amounts of rutile, 

carbonates, other oxides and other minerals. Monazite, bastnaesite, allanite and U-Th phases are 

present in trace amounts.

Figure 2: Mineral Abundance of Each Composite 

 
Liberation and association data for U-Th minerals, Monazite, Allanite and Pyrite are present in Figures 3 

to 6. 

Major observations are as follows: 

 Free and liberated U-Th minerals account for 41%, 21% and 19% for the LR, UR and IQ, 
respectively (Figure 3). Most of the U-Th minerals occur as complex particles (terniary and 
quaterniary middlings) (49%, 66% and 61%), minor middlings with monazite (5%, 4% and 12%), 
quartz/feldspars (<4%).  Liberation generally increases significantly from the +75 to -38 um 
fraction.  

 Mineral exposure data show that LR and UR have similar values with >30% exposed particles at 
68% and 64%, respectively.  U-Th minerals are better exposed at 86% in the IQ sample.  Thus, 
the potential for leaching the U from these phases is better for IQ. Thus, although the U-Th 
minerals are poorly liberated, they are moderately to well exposed. 

 Free (a mineral with ≥ 95% surface exposure) and liberated (a mineral with ≥ 80% but <95% 
surface exposure) monazite account for 59%, 68% and 62% for the LR, UR and IQ, respectively 
(Figure 4). The remainder occurs as complex particles (29%, 22% and 28%) and quartz/feldspars 
(<6%).  

 Free and liberated allanite account for 35%, 63% and 54% for the LR, UR and IQ, respectively 
(Figure 5). The majority of the remainder occurs as complex particles (53%, 25% and 40%) and 
quartz/feldspars (6%, 9% and 4%). 

 Free and liberated pyrite account for 95%, 94% and 97% for the LR, UR and IQ, respectively 
(Figure 6).

EMPA of the U-Th phase reveals that the UR and IQ composites contain mainly uranothorite-thorite 

[(Th,U)SiO4]. The LR Comp contains altered uraninite (UO2), coffinite [U(SiO4)1-x(OH)4x] and uranothorite-

thorite [(Th,U)SiO4]. Brannerite was tentatively identified during the SEM examination of the samples as 

micrometric inclusions in various minerals. 

EMPA was carried out on monazite to determine the chemistry of the mineral in the three composites.  

The average values of the main REE (Ce, La and Nd) vary slightly among monazite in the three 

composites. Monazite contains trace amounts of Y (0.14%, 0.49% and 0.11% in LR, UR and IQ, 

respectively). Th was found to range from 2.00%, 3.44% and 1.27% in LR, UR and IQ, respectively. It is 

critical to note that monazite does not carry U. 

The grade-recovery curves represent the ideal and potential maximum recovery for physical separation 

(gravity, flotation) of the specific mineral and not chemical recovery (leaching). 

At a K80 of 75 μm mineralogy indicates U-Th minerals are capable of the following grades and recoveries:  

 grades between 94% and 76% for recoveries of 41% to 71%, respectively, for the LR; 

 grades between 95% and 65% for recoveries of 21% to 73%, respectively, for UR; 

 grades between 98% and 70% for mineral recoveries of 19% to 89%, respectively, for IQ. 

The grade-recovery curve representing each composite indicates monazite: 

 grades between 96% and 77% for recoveries of 59% to 89%, respectively, for the LR; 

 grades between 96% and 82% for recoveries of 68% to 93%, respectively, for UR; 

 grades between 97% and 80% for mineral recoveries of 62% to 92%, respectively, for IQ. 

2.3. Bond Ball Mill Grindability Testing 

The Bond ball mill grindability test was performed on the Master Composite using a 100 mesh (150 µm) 

closing screen. The results are summarized in Table 6 and compared to the SGS database in Figure 7. 

The Master Composite can be categorized as moderately hard. The test details are presented in 

Appendix A.

3. Beneficiation Testing 

3.1. Gravity Separation – Mozley Shaking Table 

Two gravity separation tests at different sizes were performed on the Master Composite using a Mozley 

Shaking Table. Results are presented in Table 7. The gravity results were similar for grind sizes of 80% 

passing 208 µm in G1 and 108 µm in G2. Over half of the U, Th and TREE was recovered in the gravity 

concentrate in approximately 7% mass. The G1 cumulative gravity concentrate 1-2 recovered 52% U, 

61% Th, 84% S and 59% TREE in 7% mass. The middlings were less than head grade and would likely 

be combined with the tailings. The tailings for each test was further screened into three fractions (+75, -

75/+38 and -38 µm) to investigate the potential of preferential U, Th and TREE deportment by size. The 

U, Th and TREE were found to deport into the -38 µm fraction. The combined gravity concentrate and the 

-38 µm fraction of the gravity tailings recovered 75% U, 81% Th and 79% TREE in 26% mass. Further 

upgrading of the -38 µm fraction of the gravity tailings may be possible. The losses in the middlings and 

the coarser fraction (+38 µm) of the gravity tailings could be due to poor liberation.

3.2. Gravity Separation – Gekko 296A Procedure 

A large scale gravity test was carried out on ~15 kg of the Master Composite with a Wilfley Table 

following the Gekko 296A procedure. The objective was to assess the amenability of the samples to the 

Gekko IPJ. The tabling procedure replicates the expected recovery that could be achieved by the IPJ. 

The feed was first stage-ground to 100% passing 20 mesh (850 µm). The ground sample was then fed 

across a Wilfley Table to collect a first concentrate. The combined middling and tailings was screen at 35 

mesh (500 µm) with the oversize stage-ground to 100% pasing 500 µm size. These materials were tabled 

again to collect a second concentrate. The tailings from the second Wilfley Table pass were stage-ground 

to 100% passing 106 µm and passed through a cyclone for desliming. The underflow of the cyclone was 

tabled and a third concentrate was collected. A total of three concentrates, a gravity tailing and one slime 

product were collected and submitted for assay. The results of the test are summarized in Table 8.  

Table 8: Gravity Separation Results – Wilfley Table at Progressive Grind 

 

Gravity separation using a Wilfley Table achieved similar results as with a Mozley Table. The combined 

gravity concentrate 1-3 recovered 73% U, 81% Th and 75% TREE in 33% mass. Excessive losses to the 

tailings could be due to liberation or in fines not recovered by gravity. Further screening of the tailings and 

upgrading using alternative beneficiation such as flotation could result in further recovery increases or 

upgrading.

3.3. Magnetic Separation-WHIMS 

The magnetic separation tests were carried out with two ~ 100g charges of the Master Composite which 

were ground to a P80 of 208 µm in M1 and 108 µm in M2. The ground sample was pulped, well mixed, 

and fed through a wet high intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS) at intensities of 2A (~2,000 Gauss), 

5A (5,000 Gauss), 10A (10,000 Gauss) and 20A (17,000 Gauss), respectively. Results are presented in 

Table 9. The 20A non-magnetics of each test was screened into three fractions (+75, -75/+38 and -38µm) 

to further investigate the U and REE deportment by size. 

Table 9: Magnetic Separation Results  

 

The majority of mass (>90%) reported to the non-magnetics. Results between the two grind sizes were 

similar. The M1 combined magnetics recovered 61% U, 74% Th and 78% TREE in 9% mass. Magnetic 

separation resulted in greater U and Th recoveries than gravity separation. The U and Th bearing 

minerals are more susceptible to magnetic separation than gravity separation. Magnetic separation could 

be considered as part of the flowsheet but further scavenging of the non-magnetics by using an 

alternative process, such as flotation, would be required. 

3.4. Flotation 

A total of 20 batch flotation tests were performed on the Master, LR, UR and IQ composites and one 

flotation test was conducted on an acid leach residue (F18). Collector LR19 was evaluated in tests F1, F2 

and F4 at different pH values as well as with and without pre-floating pyrite. In test F3, Cupferron and FS-

2 as the collectors were compared against Salicycylhydroxamate (SHD), a Chinese hydroxamate reagent 

effective on other REE ores, in F5, but these tests showed inferior performance for U, Th and TREE. 

Subsequent testwork used LR19 to evaluate pulp pH, primary grind size, sulphide pre-float, desliming, 

modifiers and depressants, collector addition rate and the pulp density. Tests F9 and F10 were carried 

out on the LR composite in a 28L flotation cell. Cleaning was performed on the F10 rougher concentrate. 

Tests F16 and F17 were conducted on the separate UR and IQ comp in a 28L flotation cell. Tests F19, 

F20 and F21 were performed on the Master composite with different conditioning time and air flow rate. A

10% mass pull was targeted to generate concentrate for subsequent hydrometallurgical tests. Rougher 

conditions are presented in Table 10.  

Table 10: Summary of Rougher Flotation Conditions 

 

 
Figure 8 to Figure 10 compare the mass-recovery relationships for U, Th, and TREE of the best test 

results achieved on the Master composite. Note that tests F6, F7 and F15 are cleaner tests and F13 is a 

rougher kinetics test.  The rougher and the cleaner flotation results are presented in Table 11 and Table 

12, respectively.

The following observations and conclusions can be drawn based on the flotation tests: 

 The U, Th and TREE grade of the slime in F8 was higher than the feed. The minus 38 µm fraction 
of the rougher tailings was grade higher than the +38 µm fraction. This indicates that the U, Th 
and TREE-bearing minerals were preferentially distributed in the finer fraction; 

 Flotation using LR19 (62% FA2, 27% Aero 855, 9% Kerosene and 2% MIBC) at a pH  range of 
6.0 to 6.5 in F4 test resulted in reduced selectivity; 

 Pyrite was readily removed by using Potassium Amyl Xanthate (PAX). The pyrite concentrate 
recovered ~91-92% S in ~5% mass. The U upgraded ~ 3 times and the TREE upgraded ~ 1.5-2.0 
times in the sulphide concentrate indicating that PAX recovers U and REO since mineralogy 
indicates mineral association of U and TREE with sulphide;  

 Cupferron and Flotinor FS-2, evaluated in test F3, showed no selectivity; 

 Salicyclhydromate(SHD), evaluated in F5, resulted in low recoveries; 

 Additional flotation time and collection dosage are required to achieve U rougher recovery greater 
than 90%. Subsequent cleaning rejects a significant amount of U;  

 Primary grind size at 80% passing 135 µm in F6 versus 80 µm in F7 indicate no effect on 
metallurgy; 

 Oxalic acid in F11 and F13 tests and sodium fluorosilicate in F12 did not improve selectivity;  

 Flotation results on LR, UR and IQ Composites (tests F9, F16 and F17) were comparable to the 
Master Composite, and the results of variability flotation tests are summarized in Table 2;

 The change of conditioning time and air low rate in F19-F21 tests did not improve metallurgy; 

 The best rougher flotation results on Master composite were achieved in test F6. The feed was 
ground to a P80 of 135 µm and it used 500 g/t sodium silicate and stage-added 1425 g/t LR19 and 
26 g/t DF250 for floating 29 minutes. The rougher concentrate recovered 79% U, 92% Th and 
92% TREE in 20% mass; 

 Flotation only is the recommended processing route as it achieved better results than gravity or 
magnetic separation; 

 Test F18 was performed on acid leach residues with the purpose of recovering pyrite. The 
sulphide concentrate grading 34.6% S with 91% recoveries in 26% mass was achieved. Pyrite 
removal via flotation on leach residue is possible. This can be an alternative option to pyrite 
flotation prior to U-Th-TREE flotation

Conclusions and Recommendations 

Four composites (LR, UR, IR and Master Composite) were prepared using samples from the Elliot Lake 

deposit. Bond ball mill grindability, gravity separation, magnetic separation and flotation testwork were 

completed.  

Mineralogical examination indicated that the major phases present in these composites are quartz (63.8-

67.4%), K-feldspars (12.2-16.8%), micas (9.6-12.6%), pyrite (2.6-10%). Monazite, bastnaesite, allanite 

and U-Th phases are present in trace amounts. EMPA reveals that the main REE-bearing minerals are 

monazite and allanite, and the U-Th minerals include uranothorite-thorite [(Th,U)SiO4], altered uraninite 

(UO2), and coffinite [U(SiO4)1-x(OH)4x]. Monazite is over 60% free and liberated at 100% passing 100 

mesh (150 µm). The U-Th minerals are generally poorly liberated.. 

The Bond ball mill grindability test performed at 100 mesh (150 µm) identified the Master Composite as 

moderately hard with a metric work index of 16.2 kWh/t. 

Gravity separation using a Mozley Table and a Wilfley Table, and magnetic separation with WHIMS 

achieved limited upgrading for U, Th and REE-bearing minerals, and would need a scavenging stage to 

further process the tailings for better recoveries. Gravity and magnetic separation were successful in 

recovering greater than 50% U, Th and TREE in a small amount of mass (10%). Additional scavenging by 

flotation is required. 

The rougher flotation with LR19 and sodium silicate at a P80 of 135 µm achieved reasonable metallurgical 

results for the Master Composite. The F6 rougher concentrate recovered 79% U, 92% Th and 92% TREE 

in 20% mass.  

Recommendations for future work include 

 Investigate the effects of desliming; 

 Consider the combination of gravity or magnetic separation and flotation; 

 Optimize the LR19 dosage; 

 Evaluated collector FA2 in place of LR19.

Introduction 

SGS Minerals Services in Lakefield, Ontario was requested to complete a metallurgical and mineralogical 

test program examining uranium and rare earth element recovery from a sample of quartz pebble 

conglomerate from the Teasdale Property by Appia Energy Corporation (Appia). 

The test program was requested by Mr. Al Workman, of Watts, Griffis and McOuat Ltd (WGM), which is 

providing project management and consulting services to Appia, on behalf of Mr. Tom Drivas of Appia.  

The work was directed by Mr. John Goode, consultant to WGM.  Following receipt of the samples, the 

program comprised sample preparation, head analysis, mineralogy, beneficiation, agitated leach tests, 

acid curing tests, and acid bake water leach tests. 

This report summarizes the tests performed under SGS Project 13849-001 and references work 

performed under SGS Project 13849-002 and reported in SGS Report "An Investigation into Beneficiation 

Testwork to Assess the Recoverability of Uranium and Rare Earth Elements from the Teasdale Property" 

on June 5, 2013. 

Results were provided to Mr. Goode as they became available throughout the course of the testwork.

Testwork Summary 

1. Sample Receipt and Description 

SGS received a total of five shipments of material from the Teasdale Property in October and November 

2012.  The first two shipments contained assay rejects from Actlabs and were ultimately not used in any 

tests conducted at SGS because this material was very fine and could not be used to create 

representative composite samples of the mineralization for testing purposes.  The final shipments 

contained a total of 172.4 kg of quarter core samples (Sample Receipts 0059-NOV12, 0081-NOV12, and 

0158-NOV12).  These shipments represented three composite samples covering the Upper Reef (UR, 

51.8 kg), Intermediate Quartz (IQ, 27.1 kg), and Lower Reef (LR, 27.1 kg) zones and one Master 

Composite (66.4 kg) made in the same ratio as the three composite samples. 

2. Sample Preparation 

The samples from each of the zones identified by Appia (UR, IQ, and LR) were blended and crushed to 

100% passing 6 mesh (3.35 mm) with samples obtained for bio-leach, head assay, mineralogical testing, 

and future variability testing.  A portion of each of these composites was also blended to produce the 

Master Composite sample.  A small portion of each of the four composite samples (UR, IQ, LR, and 

Master Comp) were submitted for detailed chemical analysis, which included whole rock analysis, 

REE-ICP Scan, total sulphur, S=, and gold analysis.  The analytical results are reproduced in Table 1.  

Total rare earth element (TREE) grades ranged from 1050 g/t (IQ) to 2190 g/t (UR) with the Master Comp 

containing 1680 g/t TREE.  Uranium content ranged from 120 g/t (IQ) to 520 g/t (LR) with the Master 

Comp containing 270 g/t U. 

Flotation tests were conducted by SGS as reported in "Beneficiation Testwork to Asses the Recoverability 

of Uranium and Rare Earth Elements from the Teasdale Property" and flotation products were blended 

into composite concentrates and tails for hydrometallurgical work.  Conc1 and Tails1 were made up of the 

concentrate and tails streams of flotation tests F9, F16, and F17.  Conc2 and Tails2 were made up of the 

concentrate and tails streams of flotation tests F19, F20, and F21.  Analytical results from the flotation 

products are presented in Table 2.  Flotation tests F19, F20, and F21 had a much better separation of 

rare earths from impurities with a TREE concentrate grade of 13650 g/t (Conc2) compared to 6150 g/t for 

tests F9, F16, and F17 producing Conc1.

3. Test Procedures 

3.1. Leach Test Program 

A bench leach test program was conducted using the Master Comp and flotation products as feed.  

Charges of 1 kg charges of the Master Comp were ground in a ball mill at 50% (w/w) solids to achieve a 

target grind size and then filtered for tests using the whole ore as feed.  Charges of varying size were 

used without further grinding for tests using the flotation products as feed.  The various feeds and grind 

time as well as target or actual grind size data are presented in Table 3.  Test conditions are listed in 

Table 4.

Table 4  AL Test Conditions 

 

Test AL-1RL was a two-stage releach test performed on the final residue from AL-1 to examine 

redissolution of double sulphate salts possibly precipitated during AL-1 (and similarly in AL-2).  The first 

stage was a neutralization of the leach residue in a 40 g/L sodium hydroxide lixiviant run at 70ºC and 

40% (w/w) solids with additional sodium hydroxide additions to maintain pH 9 or greater for one hour 

before filtration and residue washing.  The second stage was a leach of the neutralized solids in a 1 N 

hydrochloric acid lixiviant run at ambient temperature and 40% (w/w) solids for two hours before filtration. 

Test POX-1 was a pressure leach test run at 210ºC, 30% (w/w) solids, preacidulated to pH 1.8 with an 

oxygen over-pressure of ~700 kPa for four hours. 

Samples of the reaction slurry for Tests AL-1 and AL-2 were obtained at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours (final) 

after the test reached operating temperature and all acid had been added.  Samples of the reaction slurry 

for Tests AL-3, AL-4, AL-5, and AL-6 were obtained at 12 and 24 hours after the test reached operating 

temperature and all acid had been added.  Samples of the reaction slurry for Tests AL-9 and AL-10 were 

obtained at 4 and 12 hours after the test reached operating temperature and all acid had been added.  

Kinetic samples were not taken in Tests AL-1RL, AL-7, and AL-8.  The samples from Tests AL-1, AL-2, 

AL-9, and AL-10 were filtered with the PLS submitted for a rare earth element scan (REE), iron, and

iron(II) and the residue was dried and submitted for REE.  The samples from Tests AL-3, AL-4, AL-5, and 

AL-6 were filtered with the PLS submitted for REE, iron, iron(II), and sulphate and the residue was dried 

and submitted for REE and total sulphur.  The samples from Test POX-1 were filtered with the PLS 

submitted for uranium, iron, and iron(II) and the residue was dried and submitted for uranium, total 

sulphur, and S=. 

Samples of the reaction slurry for Test POX-1 were obtained at one and two hours after the test reached 

operating temperature and all acid had been added. 

At the conclusion of Tests AL-1, AL-2, AL-9, and AL-10 the entire slurry was filtered with a sample of the 

PLS being assayed for REE, a 30-element ICP Scan, and iron(II).  The residue was dried and submitted 

for REE.  The final slurry of Test AL-1RL was filtered with a sample of the PLS being assayed for REE 

while the residue was dried and submitted for REE as well.  The final slurry of Tests AL-3, AL-4, AL-5, 

and AL-6 was filtered with a sample of the PLS being assayed for REE, ICP, iron(II), and sulphate.  The 

residue was dried and submitted for REE, iron, sodium, potassium, and total sulphur.  The final slurry of 

Tests AL-7 and AL-8 was filtered with a sample of the PLS being assayed for REE, ICP, and iron(II).  The 

residue of AL-7 was used as feed for AB-6 and the residue of AL-8 was stored. 

The final slurry of Test POX-1 was filtered with a sample of the PLS being assayed for REE, ICP, and 

iron(II).  The residue was dried and submitted for REE, total sulphur, and S=. 

3.2. Acid Pug Leach Tests 

One test, AP-1, was performed on a 400 g dry equivalent sample of wet (23% moisture) Conc1 feed.  

During this acid pug test, the wet feed was mixed with the equivalent of 40 kg/t sulphuric acid (dry sample 

basis) and placed in a column maintained at 70ºC with high-humidity air being pumped through the 

material for 24 hours.  The contents of the column were then discharged into a leach reaction kettle with 

water at approximately 50% (w/w) solids and ambient temperature for an additional one hour with no pH 

or ORP control.  At the conclusion of the test, the entire slurry was filtered with a sample of the PLS being 

assayed for REE, ICP, iron(II), and sulphate.  The residue was dried and submitted for REE, iron, sodium, 

potassium, and total sulphur.  The procedure was developed based on US Patent 4,131,6391. 

3.3. Acid Bake Water Leach Tests 

Bench acid bake and water leach tests were conducted using flotation products as feed.  Test conditions 

are listed in Table 5.

Table 5  AB Test Conditions 

 

The acid bake portion of Test AB-5 was run on the residue from a roast and water leach test which used 

Conc1 as the original feed.  AB-5 was run in parallel with an acid leach test (AL-6) to compare each 

extraction method. 

The acid bake portion of Test AB-6 was run on the residue from acid leach Test AL-7 which used Conc2 

as the original feed.  AB-6 was run to evaluate acid pre-leaching and PLS recycling, with the PLS of this 

test being forwarded to acid leach test AL-8. 

Upon removal from the furnace, the acid-baked solids were allowed to cool before being manually 

pulverized and then placed in a leach reaction kettle with water at 10% (w/w) solids on an original dry 

feed basis.  The temperature was maintained at 90ºC and the pH was maintained below pH 1.5 for the 

four-hour duration of the water leach. 

At the conclusion of the leach portion of Tests AB-1, AB-2, AB-3, and AB-4 the entire leach slurry was 

filtered with a sample of PLS being assayed for REE, silicon, phosphorous, iron, aluminum, calcium, 

manganese, chloride, and fluoride.  The residue was washed and a sample of the wash was assayed for 

cerium, yttrium, phosphorous, and iron.  The residue was dried and submitted REE by ICP-MS, silicon, 

phosphorous, iron, aluminum, calcium, manganese, chloride, fluoride, total sulphur, cerium, lanthanum, 

neodymium, and praseodymium. 

At the conclusion of the leach portion of Test AB-5 the entire leach slurry was filtered with a sample of 

PLS being assayed for REE, ICP, and silicon.  The residue was washed and a sample of the wash was 

assayed for cerium, yttrium, and iron.  The residue was dried and submitted for REE by ICP-MS and total 

sulphur. 

At the conclusion of the leach portion of Test AB-6 the entire leach slurry was filtered with a sample of 

PLS being assayed for REE and ICP.  The residue was washed and dried before being submitted for 

REE by ICP-MS and iron.

3.4. Roast and Water Leach Test 

One test was performed on a 400 g dry equivalent sample of wet (23% moisture) Conc1 feed.  The wet 

feed was placed in a preheated muffle furnace at 750ºC for two hours.  Upon removal from the furnace, 

the roasted solids were allowed to cool before being manually pulverized and then placed in a leach 

reaction kettle with water at 10% (w/w) solids on an original dry feed basis.  The temperature was 

maintained at 90ºC and the pH was not controlled for the four-hour duration of the water leach.  At the 

conclusion of the test, the entire slurry was filtered with a sample of the PLS being assayed for REE, 

silicon, and iron.  The residue was washed and a sample of the wash was assayed for cerium, yttrium, 

and iron.  The residue was dried and submitted for REE by ICP-MS, total sulphur, and S=.  The residue of 

this test was used as feed for Tests AL-6 and AB-5. 

3.5. Liquor Neutralization and Ion Exchange (IX) Tests 

A series of neutralization tests were performed on a combined PLS resulting from the leach tests.  Assay 

results from the combined PLS can be found in Table 6.  For one of these tests, the combined PLS was 

placed in a 1000 mL reaction kettle and agitated at ambient temperature for a one hour reaction time.  

The pH was increased to pH 2 using a 20% (w/w) limestone slurry.  Two other tests were performed using 

the same feed in a 500 mL reaction kettle at 40ºC in a stepwise pH neutralization.  pH targets were 2.0, 

2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, and 6.0 with a 30 minute stabilization period between targets.  One of these 

tests investigated the use of magnesium oxide as a 25% (w/w) slurry and the other test made use of a 

25% (w/w) slurry of limestone. 

A solution sample for Neut-1 was taken from the final filtrate and assayed for uranium, neodymium and

One uranium ion exchange test was performed to remove uranium from the neutralized combined PLS 

(UIX-1).  This test used 600 mL of the filtrate from Neut-1 with a measured pH of approximately pH 2.1.  

The solution was contacted with 3 mL wet settled resin (wsr) (5 mL wsr/L filtrate) using Ambersep 920U in 

sulphate form for 90 min for each contact.  The Neut-1 filtrate contained 281 mg/L uranium, 42 mg/L 

neodymium and 4630 mg/L iron.  This filtrate was subjected to five consecutive contacts with fresh resin 

at the same ratio for each contact.  A sample of the solution was collected after each contact and 

submitted for uranium and iron assays with the bulk of the final filtrate forwarded to the final solution 

neutralization test (Neut-4).  The resin for each contact was screened out and dried with the weight 

recorded. 

One neutralization test was performed using the barren solution from a uranium ion exchange test (UIX-1 

Barren).  The UIX-1 filtrate after the fifth and final contact contained 14 mg/L uranium and 3980 mg/L iron.  

This barren solution was placed in a 500 mL reaction kettle and heated to 40ºC.  The pH was slowly 

adjusted using a 25% (w/w) magnesium oxide slurry holding for ten minutes at various pH points to allow 

the reaction to stabilize before proceeding to pH 3.0 and filtering the resulting slurry.  A solution sample 

was taken for REE, ICP, and iron(II) with the bulk of the solution forwarded to the rare earth element ion 

exchange testwork (REEIX-1). 

A series of rare earth element ion exchange contacts were performed to selectively recover rare earth 

elements from the neutralized UIX-1 Barren solution (Neut-4 filtrate).  This test used the filtrate from 

Neut-4 with a measured pH of approximately pH 3.1 and contacted it with OC1026 ion exchange resin at 

ratios of 120 mL wsr/L barren, 60.0 mL wsr/L barren, and 20.0 mL wsr/L barren using 100 mL, 180 mL, 

and 180 mL of filtrate, respectively.  Each contact was two hours in duration in agitated flasks at ambient 

temperature.  Complete assay results for the Neut-4 filtrate can be found in Table 15.  Key assay results 

are summarized in Table 7.

Table 8  Whole Ore Master Comp Extraction Results 

 

Sulphuric acid addition for Tests AL-1 and AL-2 were 69.1 kg/t and 62.0 kg/t on a dry feed basis, 

respectively.  Acid consumed was 45.6 kg/t and 35.4 kg/t respectively for AL-1 and AL-2.  Sodium 

chlorate addition for these tests was 0.8 kg/t and 0.4 kg/t on a dry feed basis, respectively.  Metal 

extractions were similar for the two tests with only slight benefits apparent with AL-2 conditions (stage 

grinding to 75 µm target P80). 

Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the timed elemental extractions for AL-1 and AL-2, respectively.  In each test 

there was a significant drop in rare earth extraction, particularly the light rare earths from 48 h to 72 h.  

This was presumed to be due to the precipitation of insoluble double sulphate salts towards the end of the 

leaching time.  Rare earth elements form double sulphate salts when cations such as K and Na are 

present.  Potassium in the leach PLS was found to increase from 1.2 g/L to 3.9 g/L from 12 h to 72 h of 

leaching in AL-1 and similarly from 1.9 g/L to 4.8 g/L in AL-2.  Sodium was also present at about 

300 mg/L in each test after 72 h.

Figure 2 AL-2 Elemental Extraction  

 
An alkaline wash followed by HCl releach of AL-1 residue was performed in attempt to redissolve the 

precipitated double sulphate salts.  When adding the releach stage to the AL-1 residue, there was 

36.8 kg/t hydrochloric acid addition on a dry feed basis.  Overall metal extractions from the combined 

leach-releach test were generally comparable to the original results obtained with Test AL-1 (Figure 3), 

indicating the loss in LREE was either not due to double sulphate precipitation or the releach scheme was 

not effective in redissolving the salts.

4.2.1. Atmospheric Leach of Flotation Concentrate 

In AL-3 the flotation concentrate was leached with sulphuric acid addition of 138 kg/t and 0.6 kg/t sodium 

chlorate.  Elemental extractions from the flotation concentrate are shown in Figure 5.  Uranium extraction 

was 93% after 12 h and 96% after 48 h of leaching.  Final LREE extraction was between 30% and 50% 

with extractions generally increasing with increasing atomic number to ~85% for the HREE.  After 

24 hours of leaching there was little further increase in either U or REE extraction.

4.2.2. Pressure Oxidation 

A batch pressure oxidation (POX) test was done on the flotation concentrate (Conc1), at 210ºC with 

700 kPa oxygen overpressure for four hours at a pulp density of 30% solids by weight.  The slurry was 

preconditioned to pH 1.8 prior to POX using 39.3 kg/t of sulphuric acid.  Greater than 90% sulphide 

oxidation was achieved, generating 250 kg/t of acid of which 104 kg/t remained as free acid, 110 kg/t as 

sulphate associated with dissolved species and 57 kg/t as insoluble sulphate in the leach residue.   

The uranium dissolution and sulphide oxidation kinetics are illustrated in Figure 6. 

 
Figure 6  Uranium Leach and Sulphide Oxidation Kinetics 

 

After two hours uranium dissolution was greater than 98% and 90% of the sulphides had been oxidized.  

Under the conditions tested, complete sulphide oxidation was expected – additional tests will be required 

to confirm the incomplete oxidation and determine why there was ~0.7% residual sulphide in the leach 

residue.  The ferric:ferrous iron ratio of the POX PLS decreased from 0.25 to ~230 from one hour to four

hours and just 20 mg/L ferrous iron suggests that the oxidation was more complete than the sulphide 

analyses showed and perhaps the sulphide assay was positively biased by insoluble sulphate 

compounds (alunite, barite etc.).  Additional work would be required to confirm this. 

The REE extraction is shown in Figure 7, with similar extractions compared to the atmospheric leach of 

the flotation concentrate; LREE extraction ranging from 20-40% and HREE from 40-80% in POX-1 

compared to acid leach LREE extraction ranging from 30-50% and HREE from 50-85%.

4.2.4. Acid Bake and Water Leach 

Results from the series of acid bake and water leach tests on the flotation concentrate (Conc1) are listed 

in Table 10 and shown in Figure 9.  The highest extractions were with 1000 kg/t acid addition, and 

comparable for 200ºC and 300ºC, however acid consumed was much lower at 200ºC; 599 kg/t versus 

886 kg/t at 300ºC.  Presumably the difference is due to acid decomposed and released in off-gasses at 

the higher temperature.  Reducing the acid dosage to 300 kg/t resulted in a 20% reduction in LREE 

extraction and a 10% reduction in HREE extraction.

Figure 9  Acid Bake Water Leach Extractions 

4.2.5. Roasting 

Flotation concentrate (Conc1) was roasted at 750ºC for 2 hours and then water leached.  There was no 

significant elemental extraction in the water leached at neutral pH (~8.5-9).   

The roasted, water leached residue was then subjected to acid baking at 250ºC with 300 kg/t acid 

addition (AB-5).  The acid bake results were comparable to those under similar conditions without prior 

roasting, as illustrated in Figure 10.  Uranium (and thorium) extractions were negatively impacted by the 

roasting step and REE extractions were largely unaffected with expectation of HREE which were slightly 

lower after roasting.

The roasted, water leached residue was also subjected to atmospheric acid leaching (AL-6) in 50 g/L 

sulphuric acid at 80ºC for 48 hours.  Leach extractions are plotted in Figure 11 and it is evident that 

roasting of the concentrate prior to atmospheric acid leaching negatively affected the leach efficiency of U 

and REE.  Acid consumption was reduced by ~25% by roasting, from ~100 kg/t for AL-3 to 75 kg/t for  

AL-6.

Results for the tests performed using the flotation Tails1 as feed are presented in Table 11. 

Table 11  Flotation Tails1 Extraction Results 

 

Sulphuric acid addition for Tests AL-4 and AL-5 were 27.7 kg/t and 27.2 kg/t on a dry feed basis, 

respectively and 15.5 kg/t and 13.4 kg/t H2SO4 was consumed in each test, respectively.  Sodium 

chlorate addition for Test AL-5 was 0.4 kg/t on a dry feed basis, while no addition was required for 

Test AL-4.  Metal extractions were notably increased with AL-4 conditions (leach temperature of 50ºC). 

Figure 13 shows the final leach extraction of Tests AL-4 and AL-5 by element.  The saw-tooth effect in the 

graph is a result of the leach residue assaying below the detection limit for many of the elements (for 

those that are reported as ">" in Table 11 the residue was below analytical detection limit).

4.4. Flotation Conc2 Leach Results 

A second flotation concentrate (Conc2) was used for a series of tests to evaluate a counter-current 

preleach arrangement.  The concentrate was first leached under atmospheric conditions (AL-7) and the 

residue from that acid baked and water leached (AB-6).  The water leach PLS was then used in a 

preleach of fresh concentrate (AL-8). 

Results for the tests performed using the flotation Conc2 as feed are presented in Table 12. 

Table 12  Flotation Conc2 Extraction Results 

 

Sulphuric acid addition for Test AL-7 was 105 kg/t on a dry feed basis, with 74 kg/t consumed.  Sodium 

chlorate addition for Test AL-7 was 0.9 kg/t on a dry feed basis.  Metal extractions were low with 16% 

LREE extraction and 53% HREE extraction. 

Acid baking of the preleached residue of AL-7 resulted in an additional 466 kg/t sulphuric acid consumed 

on a dry feed basis.  Overall metal extractions were significantly improved with the acid bake test and 

slightly improved over a similar direct acid bake test on a similar feed.  Combined preleach and acid bake 

extractions were 95% for both LREE and HREE.  This can be compared to the results obtained from AB-3 

which achieved extractions of 67% for LREE and 83% for HREE.

Performing an acid leach using fresh Conc2 feed and the PLS from AB-6 required an additional 35.6 kg/t 

sulphuric acid addition on a dry feed basis resulting in a slurry pH of ~1.2.  Sodium chlorate addition was 

2.8 kg/t on a dry feed basis.  Metal extractions in this test were higher than those found in AL-7, indicating 

the additional acid may not have been required and the residual acid after baking could be sufficient for 

the preleach, additional testing will be required to confirm this. 

Figure 14 shows the final leach extraction of Tests AL-7 and AL-8 and includes the overall extraction of 

Test AL-7 with acid bake (AB-6) by element.

Sulphuric acid addition for Tests AL-9 and AL-10 were 36.6 kg/t and 37.7 kg/t on a dry feed basis, 

respectively and 13.4 kg/t and 20.4 kg/t acid was consumed in each test, respectively.  Sodium chlorate 

addition for Test AL-9 was 0.6 kg/t on a dry feed basis while no addition was required for Test AL-10.  

Metal extractions were notably increased with AL-10 conditions (leach temperature of 50ºC).

The data for Neut-2 and Neut-3 are plotted in Figure 16 and Figure 17, respectively.  The precipitation 

data was calculated using a sodium tie and the feed solution and filtrate assays.  This calculation leads to 

some negative precipitation values due to the use of calculated concentrations of the elements under 

investigation.  In order to compose a complete mass balance, additional testing without intermediate 

sampling at pH intervals will be required, which would be able to fully define the extent of precipitation at 

the target pH.  The precipitation extents could be derived based on both solids and solution assays in 

such a test.

As expected, a much greater amount of limestone (as in Neut-3) is required to achieve the same pH 

target when compared to using magnesium oxide (as in Neut-2) as the pH modifier with all other 

conditions remaining the same.  Limestone resulted in greater losses of many elements of interest at all 

comparable pH points during the tests.  Magnesium oxide proved to be more effective at iron and thorium 

removal with 57% of the iron and 72% of the thorium precipitated at pH 3.5 with limited losses of the other 

elements being tracked.  At the same pH, limestone precipitated similar amounts of iron and thorium but 

also resulted in losses up to 55% of the REE. 

The pH 2.0 neutralized PLS (Neut-1) was used for uranium ion-exchange testing.  The PLS was 

contacted at various resin to solution ratios using Ambersep 920U SO4 strong base anion exchange 

resin.  Results for the uranium ion exchange test are presented in Table 17. 

Table 17  Uranium Ion Exchange Assay Results 

 

Uranium in solution was steadily reduced from 281 mg/L in the feed to 14 mg/L in the barren solution after 

five contacts with fresh Ambersep 920U resin in sulphate form for 95% extraction in five stages.  Iron was 

also reduced slightly from 4630 mg/L to 3980 mg/L implying some loading of anion ferric sulphate 

species.  The pH remained fairly stable around pH 2.  A uranium loading isotherm is shown in Figure 18, 

the results show that uranium may be extracted effectively from the PLS using ion-exchange.  Additional 

testing will be required to optimize the process and select the most ideal resin.

The UIX barren solution was then contacted with OC1026 resin (a DEHPA impregnated resin 

manufactured by Lewatit) to extract REE.  Resin to solution ratios of 120, 60 and 20 mL/L were used in 

two-hour contacts on a vibratory shaker.  The resin tended to float and stick to the sides of the vessels 

and thus generally had poor solution to resin contact.  The test results are listed in Table 18 and plotted in 

Figure 19.  Generally poor loading of the LREE was observed, but significant loading of HREE was 

measured.  As expected, an increase in the resin:liquor ratio resulted in increased loading.    Additional 

tests will be required to optimize IX extraction of REE from the PLS.

Conclusions and Recommendations 

Whole Ore Leaching 

Two whole ore leach tests were conducted on ore ground to 80% passing 212 µm (test AL-1) and 75 µm 

(test AL-2).  In both cases the leach was performed at 80ºC with 50 g/L free acid and over 72 hours with 

kinetic sampling.  The test results indicate that LREE precipitation occurs with increased leach time.  A 

possible mechanism is the formation of insoluble LREE double sulphates caused by the entry of K and 

Na into the system by the dissolution of K-feldspar and other minerals.  An attempt to convert the 

hypothetical double sulphates to a soluble form failed and more testing is indicated.  Since U leaching 

seemed to be essentially complete (~95% extraction) after 48 hours, such leach times, or shorter, would 

be appropriate for the maximization of LREE recovery.  The acid consumptions for these tests were 46 

kg/t and 35 kg/t for the coarse and fine grinds, respectively.  LREE extraction was 14% and 16% for AL-1 

and AL-2, respectively.  HREE extraction was 71% and 74% for AL-1 and AL-2, respectively.  

Flotation Concentrate Leaching 

Several different methods of processing the flotation concentrate were investigated including simple 

atmospheric acid leaching, pressure oxidation in which the pyrite was oxidized to generate lixiviant 

solution and simultaneously promote metal dissolution, and sulphuric acid baking – a standard way of 

cracking monazite/bastnaesite minerals. 

Flotation concentrate was subjected to a 50 g/L sulphuric acid leach procedure for 48 h at 80ºC with 

kinetic sampling.  Not too surprisingly, the U and REE extraction data were very similar to those for the 

whole ore leaching with about 30% extraction for La and Ce and about 80% for Y and related HREE. 

A sample of flotation concentrate was mixed as a paste with sulphuric acid and the resulting pellets held 

for 24 hours at a nominal 80ºC with moist air passing through the pellet bed.  After 24 hours the ore was 

slurried with water, filtered and the products assayed.  Data showed less than 30% U extraction, very low 

LREE extraction and about 30% HREE extraction. 

A single pressure oxidation (POX) test on a flotation concentrate containing 814 g/t of U, 5877 g/t of 

TREE, and 9.2% S was performed. Test conditions included pre-acidification to pH 1.8 (39 kg/t acid 

added), a temperature of 210ºC and an oxygen overpressure of ~700 kPa (100 psi).  The test was 

extended over four hours although full oxidation of pyrite and uranium extraction was expected in a 

shorter period of time.  It was speculated that some cracking of refractory REE minerals might also occur 

given adequate time.  In this test, 92% of the sulphide was oxidized, 98% of the U solubilized, along with 

28% of the TREE, and 70% of the HREE.  Y extraction was 80% reflecting the close association between 

U mineralization and Y.  Clearly monazite was not cracked during POX.

Several acid bake tests were performed on Appia flotation concentrates.  Initial tests indicated that a 

temperature of 200ºC and an acid addition of 1 t/t concentrate, and a three hour retention time was 

satisfactory with an acid consumption of 600 kg/t, U extraction of 98%, HREE extraction of 92%, and 

LREE extraction ranging from 56% for La to 90% for Sm.  A pre-leach and acid bake process, simulating 

a counter-current leach system, was executed in tests AL-7 and AB-6 on a concentrate assaying 780 g/t 

U and 13636 g/t TREE.  The flotation concentrate yielded 10.6% of the feed mass containing 92% of 

the S, 31% of the U, 79% of the LREE and 50% of the HREE.  The pre-leach required 74 kg/t of acid 

(105 kg/t acid added).  The acid bake on the pre-leach residue was done with a 600 kg/t acid addition and 

at a temperature of 250ºC for three hours. The subsequent water leach contained 133 kg/t of free acid 

which should, in a counter-current system, be more than sufficient for the pre-leach meaning that the 

fresh acid demand for the pre-leach and bake system is about 600 kg/t of concentrate. 

Flotation Tailings Leaching 

Samples of the flotation tailings corresponding to the concentrate used in the AL-7/AB-6 pre-leach and 

acid bake test were leached for 24 h at both room temperature and 50ºC in dilute sulphuric acid in tests 

AL-9 and AL-10.  In both cases, the data showed metal extraction was substantially complete after just 

12 h.  Acid consumption was about 15-20 kg/t.  The higher temperature leach offered 5% better U 

extraction (89% vs. 94%) and an average of 9% greater REE extraction (77% Y extraction at room 

temperature and 89% at 50ºC; and 44% Nd extraction at room temperature and 51% at 50ºC).   

U and REE Recovery from Solution  

A combined PLS was neutralized using both limestone and MgO.  Limestone led to significant losses of 

REE as compared to MgO with similar levels of Fe (and Al, Th etc) removal.  PLS was neutralized to 

pH 2.0 and then contacted with a strong base anion exchange resin to extract uranium and this led to 

95% extraction of uranium in five successive contacts with fresh resin in each contact.  The UIX barren 

was further neutralized to pH 3.0 and then contacted with a DEHPA impregnated resin to extract REE.  

LREE were not extracted to a high degree but HREE extraction was near 85%.  Further IX work is 

needed to define conditions, probably counter-current extraction, where IX for all REE would be effective.  

Alternative resins should also be examined. 

Recommendations 

Additional testing should focus on the preleach and acid bake leach flowsheet on the flotation concentrate 

in order to further optimize the process and confirm the acid requirements.  Additionally, testing to 

optimize the atmospheric leach of the flotation tailings is recommended.  An additional test program 

examining uranium and REE recovery also needs be done to further optimize that part of the process and 

identify the most logical processing scheme (i.e. a combined resin-in-pulp recovery, separate resin-in-pulp 

recovery or liquid solid separation followed by SX recovery).  Solid-liquid separation and rheology testing

27

should also be done on relevant process streams – depending on the selected flowsheet – to provide 

related process design criteria.   

The goal of the additional work will be to further define and optimize the pre-leach, bake, and tailings 

leach processes and identify an effective method for the recovery of U and REE from the leached slurry.

Procedure: 1. The sample was ground to the desired P80 and the mill discharge pan filtered
2. A small sample was cut for %H2O determination (~50 g)
3. The wet wt. of feed was recorded along with the kettle tare weight, slurry the solids and agitate kettle
4. The Slurry was brought to desired temperature (if required)
5. The pH or FA was adjusted to target level with H2SO4; all acid additions were recorded (beware of foaming, add acid sl
7. Small amounts of 200 g/L NaClO3 were added to achieve ORP target
8. Records of pH, emf, Temp were kept throughout the test, H2SO4 was added to keep constant pH (with acid requiremen
9. The reactor contents were sampled at 12, 24, 48 hrs using 60 mL syringe

10. The pulp sample weight was recorded, then filtered
11. Solids were washed with 60 mL pH 2.0 water, then 60 mL DI water (DO NOT LET CAKE CRACK or repulp)
12. The filtrate weight and SG was recorded, along w/ pH, FA and ORP if sufficient volume permitted
13. Dry solids and filtrate were submitted for analysis, the wash solution was rejected 
14. After completion of the test the reactor was allowed to cool (if at T) and agitation was stopped
15. The final weight of vessel was recorded and the contents filtered and washed once with 300 mL pH 2.0 water, 3 times w
16. The filtration rate was recorded along with notes on residue and liquor colour
17. The filtrate weight and SG was recorded, along w/ pH, FA and ORP

Project No.: 13849-001 Project Technologist:
Client: Appia Energy Corp Date of Test:

Test ID: 500g

Objective: To conduct a sulphuric acid leach test on a uranium ore
To study the kinetics of uranium dissolution under various conditions

Feed: Tails 2
Grind: N/A 50% solids in lab ball mill

(note time/kg, weight charged, % solids in mill and mill size/type)

Procedure: 1. The sample was ground to the desired P80 and the mill discharge pan filtered
2. A small sample was cut for %H2O determination (~50 g)
3. The wet wt. of feed was recorded along with the kettle tare weight, slurry the solids and agitate kettle
4. The Slurry was brought to desired temperature (if required)
5. The pH or FA was adjusted to target level with H2SO4; all acid additions were recorded (beware of foaming, add acid slowly)
7. Small amounts of 200 g/L NaClO3 were added to achieve ORP target
8. Records of pH, emf, Temp were kept throughout the test, H2SO4 was added to keep constant pH (with acid requirement recorded)
9. The reactor contents were sampled at 4, 12, 24 hrs using 60 mL syringe

10. The pulp sample weight was recorded, then filtered
11. Solids were washed with 60 mL pH 2.0 water, then 60 mL DI water (DO NOT LET CAKE CRACK or repulp)
12. The filtrate weight and SG was recorded, along w/ pH, FA and ORP if sufficient volume permitted
13. Dry solids and filtrate were submitted for analysis, the wash solution was rejected 
14. After completion of the test the reactor was allowed to cool (if at T) and agitation was stopped
15. The final weight of vessel was recorded and the contents filtered and washed once with 300 mL pH 2.0 water, 3 times with 300 mL DI
16. The filtration rate was recorded along with notes on residue and liquor colour
17. The filtrate weight and SG was recorded, along w/ pH, FA and ORP
18. Dry solids and filtrate were submitted for analysis, the wash solution was rejected 

All pulp samples must be labeled "NORM" for Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material

Objective: To conduct a sulphuric acid leach test on a uranium ore
To study the kinetics of uranium dissolution under various conditions

Feed: Conc 1
Grind: -- 50% solids in lab ball mill

(note time/kg, weight charged, % solids in mill and mill size/type)

Procedure: 1. The sample was ground to the desired P80 and the mill discharge pan filtered
2. A small sample was cut for %H2O determination (~50 g)
3. The wet wt. of feed was recorded along with the kettle tare weight, slurry the solids and agitate kettle
4. The Slurry was brought to desired temperature (if required)
5. The pH or FA was adjusted to target level with H2SO4; all acid additions were recorded (beware of foaming, add acid slowly)
7. Small amounts of 200 g/L NaClO3 were added to achieve ORP target
8. Records of pH, emf, Temp were kept throughout the test, H2SO4 was added to keep constant pH (with acid requirement recorded)
9. The reactor contents were sampled at 12, 24, 48 hrs using 60 mL syringe

10. The pulp sample weight was recorded, then filtered
11. Solids were washed with 60 mL pH 2.0 water, then 60 mL DI water (DO NOT LET CAKE CRACK or repulp)
12. The filtrate weight and SG was recorded, along w/ pH, FA and ORP if sufficient volume permitted
13. Dry solids and filtrate were submitted for analysis, the wash solution was rejected 
14. After completion of the test the reactor was allowed to cool (if at T) and agitation was stopped
15. The final weight of vessel was recorded and the contents filtered and washed once with 300 mL pH 2.0 water, 3 times with 300 mL DI
16. The filtration rate was recorded along with notes on residue and liquor colour
17. The filtrate weight and SG was recorded, along w/ pH, FA and ORP
18. Dry solids and filtrate were submitted for analysis, the wash solution was rejected 

All pulp samples must be labeled "NORM" for Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material

Date: 04-Mar-13
Test: POX 1 13849-001 Technologist: D. Matthews

Purpose: To determine the effect of grind size on kinetic oxidation. 

Sample: Combined Conc Grind: as received K80 ~  40 micron
LIMS 03431 Feb

Procedure: The feed pulp sample was placed into an autoclave vessel.
The pulp was mixed with a mechanical stirrer.
The pulp was adjusted to pH1.8 using concentrated sulphuric acid and maintained for 30 minutes.
The vessel was then sealed and heat up began.
Once the sample was at oxygen over pressure was applied.

Kinetic pulp samples were removed from the autoclave, via a bomb sampler, at 60 and 120 minutes.
The kinetic samples were weighed and immediately filtered.
The filtrates were collected and submitted for assays.
The filtercakes were displacement washed several times with fresh water.
The wash solutions were discarded. The filtercakes were dried, weighed, and submitted for assays.

After 240 minutes at temperature and pressure the autoclave was cooled to ~80°C.
The oxygen pressure was bleed off.
The autoclave was opened and the hot pulp was quickly filtered.
The filtrate was collected and a sample was submitted for assays.
The filtercake was displacement washed several times with DI water.
The wash solutions were discarded. The filtercake was dried, weighed, and submitted for assays.

Procedure: 1. The sample was ground to the desired P80 and the mill discharge pan filtered
2. A small sample was cut for %H2O determination (~50 g)
3. The wet wt. of feed was recorded and sulphuric acid was added to 40 kg/t with acid addition recorded.
4. The Slurry was charged to a column and brought to desired temperature (if required)
5. Low flow air was saturated with water vapour by sparging through a pair of flasks containing water before being injected into the column.
6. After 24 hours, the column was discharged and the total weight of the acidic solids was recorded.
7. the kettle tare weigh was recorded and the solids were slurried to target.
8. The slurry was mixed for one hour with pH, ORP, and temperature measurements recorded at regular intervals.

13. After completion of the test the reactor was allowed to cool (if at T) and agitation was stopped
14. The final weight of vessel was recorded and the contents filtered and washed once with 300 mL pH 2.0 water, 3 times with 300 mL DI
15. The filtration rate was recorded along with notes on residue and liquor colour
16. The filtrate weight and SG was recorded, along w/ pH, FA and ORP
17. Dry solids and filtrate were submitted for analysis, the wash solution was rejected 

All pulp samples must be labeled "NORM" for Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material

Procedure: 1. The sample was ground to the desired P80 and the mill discharge pan filtered
2. A small sample was cut for %H2O determination (~50 g)
3. The wet wt. of feed was recorded along with the kettle tare weight, slurry the solids and agitate kettle
4. The Slurry was brought to desired temperature (if required)
5. The pH or FA was adjusted to target level with H2SO4; all acid additions were recorded (beware of foaming, add acid slowly)
7. Small amounts of 200 g/L NaClO3 were added to achieve ORP target
8. Records of pH, emf, Temp were kept throughout the test, H2SO4 was added to keep constant pH (with acid requirement recorded)
9. The reactor contents were sampled at 12, 24, 48 hrs using 60 mL syringe

10. The pulp sample weight was recorded, then filtered
11. Solids were washed with 60 mL pH 2.0 water, then 60 mL DI water (DO NOT LET CAKE CRACK or repulp)
12. The filtrate weight and SG was recorded, along w/ pH, FA and ORP if sufficient volume permitted
13. Dry solids and filtrate were submitted for analysis, the wash solution was rejected 
14. After completion of the test the reactor was allowed to cool (if at T) and agitation was stopped
15. The final weight of vessel was recorded and the contents filtered and washed once with 300 mL pH 2.0 water, 3 times with 300 mL DI
16. The filtration rate was recorded along with notes on residue and liquor colour
17. The filtrate weight and SG was recorded, along w/ pH, FA and ORP

Acid Bake Comments:

The filtered unwashed wet cake from AL-7 was combined with the specified amount of sulphuric acid in a crucible (record tare 
weight of crucible) inside a fumehood. The paste was made homogeneous.
The paste was cured for 1 hour
The muffle furnace was heated to 250ºC
After curing, the ore/acid mixture was placed in a muffle furnace at temperature and baked for 3 hours.
After 3 hours at temperature, the furnace was turned off and allowed to cool to room temperature.

316.1

Weighed calcined sample in crucible, transfered calcine to mortar and pulverized if necessary.
Acid Baked solids were pulped to 10% solids in DI water in a 2L Pyrex reaction kettle.
A lid and condenser was attached to the kettle and a Teflon impellor/mechanical mixer setup was used to agitate the slurry.  
The slurry was heated to 90°C via heating mantle/temperature controller setup.  pH was maintained below 1.5
After 4 hours at temperature, the pulp was weighed, filtered.  The solids were washed with 60mL of DI water, the PLS and first 
wash were stored and a sample sent for assay. The cake was then repulped once and displacement washed with 3 x 300 mL DI 
water.
Final solids were dried to constant mass.  Final PLS, wash and soilds were assayed per the table below
Free acid and sg of the Final Solution was determined.

4. The Slurry was brought to desired temperature (if required)
5. The pH or FA was adjusted to target level with H2SO4; all acid additions were recorded (beware of foaming, add acid slowly)
7. Small amounts of 200 g/L NaClO3 were added to achieve ORP target
8. Records of pH, emf, Temp were kept throughout the test, H2SO4 was added to keep constant pH (with acid requirement recorded)
9. The reactor contents were sampled at 6 hrs using 60 mL syringe

10. The pulp sample weight was recorded, then filtered
11. Solids were washed with 60 mL pH 2.0 water, then 60 mL DI water (DO NOT LET CAKE CRACK or repulp)
12. The filtrate weight and SG was recorded, along w/ pH, FA and ORP if sufficient volume permitted
13. Filtrate was submitted for analysis, the wash solution was stored
14. After completion of the test the reactor was allowed to cool (if at T) and agitation was stopped
15. The final weight of vessel was recorded and the contents filtered and not washed
16. The filtration rate was recorded along with notes on residue and liquor colour
17. The filtrate weight and SG was recorded, along w/ pH, FA and ORP
18. Wet cake solids were stored and filtrate was submitted for analysis

350 mL of Solution was placed in a 500 mL Pyrex reactor equipped with at least 1 baffle. The solution was agitated with a Teflon 
impellor and mechanical mixer.  The pulp was heated to 40 deg C.
MgO slurry (25 % solids) was added stepwise to get to pH levels of  2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0.  Slurry was held at each pH 
for 30 min.
Liquor samples were taken at each pH step.  (25 or 30 mL syringe, filter & collect PLS, return unwashed residue to reactor).  A drop 
of conc. H2SO4 was added to each filtrate.

The pulp was filtered and the filtration time was noted.  Wash the solids with DI water.  Save sample of wash solution. Save washed 
wet cake for further testwork (do not submit for assay).

350 mL of Solution was placed in a 500 mL Pyrex reactor equipped with at least 1 baffle. The solution was agitated with a Teflon 
impellor and mechanical mixer.  The pulp was heated to 40 deg C.
Limestone slurry (25 % solids) was added stepwise to get to pH levels of  2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0.  Slurry was held at each 
pH for 30 min.
Liquor samples were taken at each pH step.  (25 or 30 mL syringe, filter & collect PLS, return unwashed residue to reactor).  A drop 
of conc. H2SO4 was added to each filtrate.

The pulp was filtered and the filtration time was noted.  Wash the solids with DI water.  Save sample of wash solution. Save washed 
wet cake for further testwork (do not submit for assay).

Take the UIX barren in a suitable (500 mL) reaction flask and heat to 40ºC.
MgO slurry (25 % solids) was added stepwise to get to pH levels of  3.0.  MgO was added slowly over 1 hour and held at pH 3 for 1 
h.  MgO addition was recorded.
The slurry was filtered and solids washed.  Wash solution was discarded, PLS was recovered and stored for REE IX
