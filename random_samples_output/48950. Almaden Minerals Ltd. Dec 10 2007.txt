1.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

 This report documents the update to the mineral resource on the Elk property 
based on additional 2006 diamond drilling.  Sections of a previously 43-101 
compliant resource report, dated April 6 2006, amended March 15, 2007, 
dealing with parts of the project that have not changed are repeated here in 
their entirety for completeness. 

 The Elk property owned by Almaden Minerals Ltd. ('Almaden') is located 40 
km west of Okanagan Lake approximately midway between Merritt and 
Peachland.  Access to the claims is via the Okanagan Connector (HWY 97C), 
east from Merritt for 55 km to the Elkhart interchange at Elkhart Lodge. 

 The property consists of 18 contiguous mineral claims and one mining lease 
covering 12,277 hectares. The 4 post, 2 post and fractional claims were 
converted to the computer based MTO claim cells in 2005. 

 The property was first discovered in the early 1900's when several short adits 
were excavated exploring narrow quartz veins hosting lead-zinc-silver-gold 
mineralization.  The area was staked by several companies in the 1960's and 
70's when the near by Brenda Mine was being developed.  The current 
property was staked in 1986 by Cordilleran Engineering Ltd. for Fairfield 
Minerals Ltd. after discovering gold-bearing pyritic quartz veins by 
prospecting in clear-cut logged areas.  Prospecting, soil and stream 
geochemistry, geophysics, trenching and drilling have since discovered a 
number of gold bearing quartz veins.  From 1992 to 1994 a total of 14,720 
tonnes have been mined from the Siwash North open pit, on the B vein, 
recovering a total of 1,481,000 grams (47,600 ozs) of gold.  A decline 985 m 
in length was developed on the Siwash B vein and several areas were test 
mined between 1993 and 1995 producing an additional 120,000 grams (3,860 
ozs) of gold from 1,780 tonnes of material mined. 

 The Elk property is underlain by Upper Triassic volcanics and sediments of 
the Nicola Group and by Middle Jurassic granites and granodiorites of the 
Osprey Lake Batholith.  Gold-silver mineralization is hosted primarily by pyritic 
quartz veins and stringers within altered granite and in some cases volcanic 
rocks.  To date a total of eight mineralized vein systems have been 
discovered on the property.  Of these two main veins the Siwash North B Vein 
and WD Veins have been extensively diamond drilled.  The Siwash North B 
vein has been drill tested and mined by both open pit and underground 
methods over 950 m strike length.  The dip is a shallow -20o near surface and 
steepens to -60o at depth.  The WD vein is more or less parallel to the B vein 
about 150 m to the north.  Drilling has followed the WD vein for 600 m along 
strike and 350 m down dip. 



Page 2 

 The 2006 exploration program on the Elk claims consisted of diamond drilling, 
core logging and sampling.  A total of 8,873 metres of NQ diamond drilling in 
58 holes was carried out in the Siwash North area to further test the WD, B 
and in the Siwash East area to test mineralization exposed by trenching.  
Excavator trenching was undertaken in the Elusive Creek area and a soil 
sample survey was carried out on the new claims on the northwest side of the 
property.

 Giroux Consultants Ltd. has been retained to provide an update to the 
resource present on the Elk Property. Giroux last visited the property and 
examined drill core, on July 11, 2007. 

 Quality assurance and quality control on the property has changed with time.  
Prior to 2000 the entire core was shipped for assay.  At Acme about one out 
of every 20 samples was re-assayed. In addition a limited amount of check 
assays were shipped to Chemex for reanalysis.  From 2000 to 2006 every 
twentieth sample was duplicated by taking a quarter split and assigning it the 
next sequential sample number.   Blank samples were submitted to the lab at 
the same frequency as the duplicates. The blanks were taken from unaltered 
granodiorite core that contained no quartz veining.  In addition Acme routinely 
re-assays splits from pulps and rejects.  During the 2003 to 2006 drill 
programs a set of prepared standards obtained from CDN Resource 
Laboratories was introduced into the assay stream.  The results of the QA\QC 
program instituted on the Elk property has shown reasonable reproducibility, 
no analytical or sampling bias and large random errors consistent with high 
grade gold deposits. 

 Gold assays were examined using graphical and statistical techniques and as 
a result capped at 302 g Au/t (8.8 oz/t).  A total of 12 assays were capped.  
For this update a different approach was applied to the resource estimate.  
Almaden geologists modeled a total of 25 separate mineralized structures on 
cross sections and combined these sections to from three dimensional solids.  
The mineralized solids were grouped geographically into 3 vein sets: B-Veins, 
WD-Veins and Other veins not related to B or WD.  Composites were formed 
at 0.5 m intervals that honoured the solid boundaries.  Semivariograms were 
produced for structures with sufficient data to model.  A block model 
consisting of blocks 10 m E-W, 2.5 m N-S and 5 m vertical was superimposed 
over the solids with blocks coded for the percentage of each solid present.  
Gold grade was interpolated into each block with some proportion of 
mineralized structure present by ordinary kriging.  Blocks were classified as 
measured, indicated or inferred based on semivariogram parameters.  
Results were presented as grade-tonnage tables for the mineralized portion 
of the blocks.  This resource represents the mineral present if one could mine 
to the limits of the three dimensional solids.  No external dilution has been 
applied.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

This report on the Mineral Resource on the Elk Property, Siwash Project was completed 
at the request of Almaden Minerals Ltd.  The purpose of this study was to update the 
mineral resource for the Siwash North B Vein and WD vein, using the additional drill 
hole information collected in 2006. 

The report is based on the available data and literature supplied by Almaden.  The 
property was last visited on July 11, 2007 by G. Giroux where drill core and surface 
outcrops were examined.  No samples of core or trenches were taken during this site 
visit.

3.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

3.1 Location and Access  

The Elk property is located 40 km west of Okanagan Lake in southern British Columbia, 
approximately midway between the towns of Merritt and Peachland, within the 
Similkameen Mining Division (see Figure 1).   

The Centre of the Property is located at latitude 49o 50' N and longitude 120 o 19' W.  
The property straddles the NTS map sheets 082E071, 092H078 to 80 and 092H089. 

Access to the claims is excellent, by following the Okanagan Connector (HWY 97C) 
east from Merritt for 55 km to the Elkhart interchange.  If approaching from the east the 
same Highway would be followed some 55 km west from Peachland.  This highway 
passes through the northern most claims in the property (see Figure 2).  From the 
Elkhart interchange gravel roads and trails provide access to most parts of the claim 
block.

    
3.2 Claim Information 

The Elk property consists of 18 contiguous mineral claims and one mining lease 
covering 12,277 hectares (Table 1).  Initial staking was undertaken in November 1988 
(160 units) with additions in early 1987 (60 units), 1988 (32 units) and 1989 (199 units).  
A block comprising 72 units was optioned from Mr. Donald Agur of Summerland, B.C. in 
October, 1988. Claim acquisition and subsequent work were conducted by Cordilleran 
Engineering Ltd. for Fairfield Minerals Ltd. until April 1995 when Fairfield assumed 
operations. Placer Dome Inc. entered into an option agreement on the property in 
March 1988 and withdrew in March 1991. Fairfield Minerals merged with Almaden 
Resources Corporation in February 2002 and the claims were transferred to the 
amalgamated company Almaden Minerals Ltd.  The claims are 100% owned by 



Page 5 

Almaden Minerals Ltd. with the exception of the Agur Option block (72 units) on the 
south side of the property, which is subject to 1% NSR from production.

The 4 post, 2 post and fractional claims were converted to the computer based 
MTO claim cells in 2005.

3.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The Elk property is located within the Trepanege Plateau highlands on heavily forested 
hilly terrain.  Elevations range from 1300 to 1750 m above sea level.  The area is 
blanketed by a layer of glacial till, of varying thickness and as a result outcrop is scarce.

Forest cover consists mainly of lodge pole pine with some balsam, sub-alpine fir and 
spruce.  Alders are confined to along streams and in marshes.

The climate in the claim area is common to the Okanagan Highlands ecosection with 
moderately short warm summers and cold winters.  Temperatures range from 13o to 18o
C in the summer months of July to September and -5 o to -12 o C in the winter months of 
December to February.  Precipitation averages about 500 mm per year with the wettest 
months of June and December averaging about 60 mm. 

The main industries within the area are cattle ranching and logging.  Recreational 
fishing is available on small lakes within the area.  The dense forest cover also supports 
hunting of deer, moose and game birds. 

The Okanagan Connector (Highway 97C) crosses the northern limit of the claims and 
provides excellent access to both the coast and the interior.  A single phase power line 
ends at Elkhart Lodge two kilometres from the mine site.  The major city of Kelowna is 
located 70 km east of the property and has a large labour force, airport, supplies and 
equipment. 

5.0 HISTORY 

The history for this property has been summarized well in the assessment reports 
submitted by W. Jakubowski (Jakubowski, 2005) and is reproduced here.  

"During the first half of the 20th century the El Paso adit was driven into volcanic rocks in 
the area currently covered by the claim with tenure number 516759.  Quartz vein-hosted 
lead-zinc-silver-gold mineralization was encountered.  No production of ore was 
achieved.

Between 1955 and 1995 Don Agur of Summerland, B.C. prospected and trenched the 
north and west parts of the present Elk property area, as well as to the south along 
Siwash Creek. 

Phelps Dodge Corporation of Canada Ltd. carried out copper exploration during 1972 
which included mapping and soil geochemistry in the area of the present claims with 
tenure #'s 516759 and 516757. 

Utah Mines Ltd. conducted mapping, geochemistry, IP geophysics and trenching to 
evaluate copper mineralization on their Siwash claim group which, in part, covered the 
present tenure # 516759. 



Page 9 

Brenda Mines Ltd. worked on the Siwash claim group, which included the area now 
comprising the southern part of the Elk property.  A rigorous copper exploration program 
including mapping, soil geochemistry, geophysics, trenching and diamond drilling was 
undertaken between 1979 and 1981.  Work was done on the area currently covered by 
the claims with tenure #'s 516755, 516757 and 516759. 

Exploration for molybdenum was undertaken by Cominco Ltd. during 1980, on the 
claims with tenure #'s 516727, 516731, 516733 and 516740. Work included geological 
mapping and soil geochemistry. 

No significant discoveries resulted from any of the above programs. 

The Elk 1 to 27 claims (present claim tenure #'s 516733, 516740, 516743, and 516759) 
were staked in November 1986 by Cordilleran Engineering Ltd. for Fairfield Minerals Ltd. 
to cover new showings of gold-silver mineralization hosted in pyritic quartz veins cutting 
a granite batholith and andesite dykes.  Preliminary hand trenching and soil sampling 
were conducted. 

During 1987, widespread and detailed grid soil sampling programs were undertaken to 
define areas anomalous in gold.  Nine trenches, totalling 1528m, were excavated in two 
areas (Discovery and South Showings) to test soil geochemical targets, and exposed 
quartz veins and altered breccias hosted in granite.  IP, magnetometer and VLF-EM 
geophysical surveys were carried out over the trenched areas.  The Elk 28 to 30 claims 
(present claim tenure #'s 516740, 516759, and 516761) were staked in September 1987 
to acquire ground along projections of favourable geochemical trends. 

The 1988 program included collection of 2246 soil samples on the claims acquired in 
1987 and trenching in Siwash North and Elusive Creek areas.  Four kilometres of road 
was constructed for access and eleven trenches totalling 2884 metres which exposed 
quartz vein-hosted gold mineralization were mapped and sampled.  The Elk 31 to 37 
claims (present claim tenure #'s 516732, 516757, 516759, and 516755) were staked to 
cover adjacent favourable areas. 

During the 1989 field season, the Elk 38 to 73 claims (present claim tenure #'s 516727, 
516731, 516732, 516755, and 516781) were staked to cover projections of anomalous 
soil geochemical trends.  Fifty line-km of VLF-EM and magnetometer surveys were 
carried out in the Siwash Lake and Siwash North areas and 4865 soil samples were 
collected on the new claims.  A total of 56.25 km of baseline was cut to provide control 
for soil sampling and geophysical surveys.  In the South Showing, Siwash North and 
Siwash Lake areas 2223 linear metres of bedrock were exposed in 25 trenches.  The 
high grade gold bearing quartz vein system in the Siwash North area was further 
delineated over a strike length of 750m.  Twelve diamond drill holes (752m) tested the 
down dip continuity of this system.  The drill core was logged, split sampled and 
photographed.  Samples were shipped to Acme Analytical Labs for assay and analysis.  
All diamond drill core has been stored on site. 

During 1990 5168.34m of HQ diamond drilling in 58 holes was carried out in the Siwash 
North area on 50 m grid spacing.  Quartz vein hosted gold mineralization in the Siwash 
North area was further exposed by seven trenches and three stripped areas totalling 544 
linear metres. Diamond drilling in the Siwash Lake area consisted of 259.08m of HQ 
core in four drill holes (SLD90-56 to 59).  Six trenches and one stripped area totalling 



Page 10 

607 linear metres of bedrock exposure were excavated in the Siwash Lake area. Soil 
sampling on the northern Elk claims was concentrated in the Siwash Lake area where 
250 fill-in samples were collected around anomalous coarse grid stations.  One 
thousand two hundred and fifty-four grid soil samples were collected on southern Elk 
claims.  Magnetometer and VLF-EM surveys (50 line km) were carried out on the Agur 
Option area on flagged lines 100m apart.  

Exploration on the Elk claims during the 1991 field season consisted of diamond drilling, 
trenching and aerial photography.  Thirty seven new holes were drilled and two were 
deepened for a total of 6608.38m in the Siwash North area to test down dip and on-
strike continuity of quartz vein-hosted gold mineralization discovered by previous work.  
The drill core was logged at 1:50 and 1:100 scales, photographed and sampled.  Five 
hundred and ninety eight samples were taken and sent to Acme Analytical Labs for gold 
assay and analysis.  One trench was dug in the End Zone, 200m southwest of Siwash 
Lake, to further expose a quartz vein discovered by trenching in 1990.  The vein is 
continuous across the entire length of the 45m trench.  Thirty two rock chip samples 
were collected and sent to Acme for gold assay and analysis. 

An area four by eight kilometres centered over the Siwash North area was aerially 
photographed in colour and black and white, at 1:8,000 and 1:15,000 scales. 

During 1992, a bulk sample was extracted from an open pit on the Siwash vein in the 
Siwash North area.  It totalled 2,040 tonnes (2240 tons) and averaged 137.7 g/t (4.016 
oz/t) gold.   A small crushing/sampling plant was installed for grade control.   
The bulk sample was shipped to Noranda's Horne smelter in Rouyn-Noranda, PQ for 
metallurgical testing and smelting. 

A total of 79 reverse-circulation holes were drilled in September and October to test for 
further open pitable reserves.  A total of 223 reverse circulation chip samples were 
shipped to Acme Analytical Labs for assay and analysis. 

In 1993 open pit mining continued with the extraction of 3,387 tonnes (3733 tons) of bulk 
sample material grading 105.6 g/t (3.080 oz/t) Au.  Eleven reverse-circulation drill holes 
totalling 942 metres tested the vein to the south and east of the open pit.  The material 
was crushed on site to minus 6 inches and then shipped to ASARCO's smelter in 
Helena, Montana. 

A portal was collared on June 28 and 480 metres of decline was driven at -15 percent to 
access high-grade shoots.  Two vein drifts were developed for test mining, the 1570 
level on the steeply dipping limb of the vein, and the 1611 level immediately down dip 
from the central core of the open pit on the flat dipping limb.  Drifting on the 1570 level 
produced about 140 tonnes (154 tons) of ore grading 38 g/t (1.108oz/t), whereupon the 
drift was abandoned and refilled due to poor ground conditions.  Three raises at 5 metre 
centres, totalling 36 metres in length, were driven up dip from the 1611 level drift. 
Following development of the raises, the quartz vein was stoped from the pillars 
producing about 315 tonnes (347 tons) of ore grading approximately 70 g/t (2.042 oz/t ) 
Au.

In 1994 the Company received a small mine permit, the open pit was expanded and 
9,180 tonnes (10,119 tons) of ore grading 91.5 g/t  (2.669 oz/t) were extracted.  
Underground, the 1611 level drift was extended to the west.  Five raises were added and 



Page 11 

the existing ones lengthened to the 1620m elevation.  Approximately 1,200 tonnes (1323 
tons) of quartz vein material grading about 78 g/ton (2.275 oz/t) Au was extracted.  An 
underground diamond drilling program was carried out between April 7 and May 31, with 
5,011m of core drilled in 84 holes from the existing decline to define ore reserves.  A 
total of 448 core samples were collected. 

Further underground development was undertaken on completion of the open pit, with 
the main decline being extended 330 metres.  A second decline branched east from the 
main ramp, for a length of 185 metres.  Test mining was carried out on two levels.  A 
longhole stoping test on the 1584 level produced 95 tonnes (105 tons) at 16.5 g/t 
(0.481oz/t) from drifting on the ore.  Longhole blasting produced excessive dilution and 
most of the material remains in the stope.  On the 1589 level, a shrinkage stope test was 
undertaken.  Stoping proceeded about 6 metres up dip along the 30 metre length of the 
drift.  About 105 tonnes (116 tons) at 15 g/t (0.438 oz/t) Au were hauled to surface.  
However, much of the material remains in the stope. 

Exploration on the Elk claims in 1995 consisted almost entirely of diamond drilling.  Two 
hundred and seventeen underground diamond drill holes (7,612 m) were drilled from the 
decline ramp in the vein footwall, between April 13 and August 12, to test grade and 
continuity of the mineralized zone.   A total of 918 core samples were collected from 
underground holes and sent to Acme Analytical Laboratories for gold assay and 
analysis.

Surface diamond drilling was undertaken between June 21 and September 22.  In the 
Siwash North area, 70 holes were drilled (4,645 metres).  In the Lake Zone area, 7 holes 
(477m) were completed.  Two holes (102m) were drilled on the Great Wall Zone, and 
four holes on the End Zone (187m).  Six holes were drilled on Discovery Showing and 
nine holes on the South Showing areas (397m and 481m respectively).  In all, 6289 
metres were drilled in 98 surface holes.  A total of 581 core samples were collected and 
sent to Acme Analytical Labs for assay and analysis. 

A small trench measuring about 10m along strike and 4m wide was dug at the Great 
Wall Zone to test the grade of a quartz vein encountered during road construction.  A ten 
centimetre vein trending 55 degrees and dipping 60 degrees to the south was exposed. 
Two 0.5m square panel samples were taken across the vein and returned grades of 
0.51g/t (0.015 oz/t)and 0.99 g/t (0.029 oz/t) Au. A total of 38 soil geochemical samples 
were taken to the east of the clear-cut in the Siwash North area.  Prospecting in areas of 
anomalous samples uncovered quartz vein float which assayed 47.35 g/t (1.381 oz/t) 
Au. Two test pits were dug in the southern South Showing area.   

The 1996 program consisted of 6,946.34m of NQ diamond drilling in 88 holes.  Five 
holes were drilled in the Siwash North Deep B area (1120.14m).  The mineralized 
structure was intersected in all holes.  The proposed Phase 5.5 open pit, east of the 
existing pit, was detail drilled with 1997.02m of NQ core in 38 holes.  This allowed the 
definition of an indicated resource of 503,000gm Au (16,200 oz) for the area of the 
proposed pit. The WD zone, located 200m north of the Siwash B zone structure, was 
tested with 25 holes in 2308.84m resulting in an inferred resource block of 569,000 gm 
Au (18,290 oz). The source of the anomalous soil geochemistry in the East Slope area 
was evaluated with 9 holes (564.39m) with poor results.  Four holes (399.08m) were 
drilled to test the source of the anomalous soil geochemistry and VLF conductor in the 
Gold Creek East area.  Numerous small veins with poor to moderate values were 



Page 12 

intersected.  The source of the anomalous soil geochemistry in the Gold Creek West 
area was evaluated with 7 NQ holes (556.87m).  A mineralized quartz vein was 
intersected with 11.8 g/t (0.381 oz) over a true width of 0.5m.  A total of 1161 core 
samples were sent to Acme Analytical Laboratories for gold analysis.  The area 
immediately to the south and east of the Siwash North drill grid was detail soil sampled 
at 25 X 50m spacing for a total of 367samples. 

Reclamation and site cleanup was undertaken during 1997.  The overburden cover was 
completed on the East waste dump and much of the mine equipment was transported to 
Savona, B.C. for storage or sale.   Limited prospecting, sampling and environmental 
monitoring were carried out between 1997 and 1999 on the Elk property. 

During 2000 twelve NQ diamond drill holes (1414m) tested the WD, B Zone and Gold 
Creek vein systems. Four holes were drilled into the WD zone to expand the then 
current 18,000 oz inferred resource block.  The WD veins were intersected in all holes 
close to the projected depths with grades up to 41.03 g/t Au over a true width of 0.50m.  
The area of the proposed Phase 5.5 open pit located about 200m to the east of the 
existing pit had been drilled extensively to establish a resource estimate for pit planning 
purposes.  Three holes were drilled on the east side of the proposed pit to increase the 
sample density. The Gold Creek West vein, located approximately 450m southwest of 
the existing open pit, was first drilled in 1996.  Five holes were drilled to test the vein 
continuity at 50m intervals between sections 1700E and 1890E.  The vein was 
intersected at the projected location with grades up to 16.55g/t Au over a true width of 
0.50m.  The vein steepens from about -30o on sections 1750E and 1700E to -60o on 
section 1840E and east.  The exploration field camp located on Camp Creek that was 
used from 1987 to 1996 was completely disassembled.  

A trenching program was carried out in the Siwash East area during October of 2001.  A 
total of six trenches with a cumulative length of 202 meters located the source of 
mineralized quartz float discovered by prospecting.  The trenches exposed narrow 
quartz veins adjacent to an east-west trending andesite dyke with grades of up to 21.7 
g/t Au from a 0.5 by 0.5 meter panel sample. 

During the 2002 field season twenty six NQ diamond drill holes (4496m) tested the WD, 
B Zone, Gold Creek West and Bullion Creek vein systems. Seven holes were drilled into 
the WD zone to determine the extent of the known shoot.  The WD veins were 
intersected in all holes close to the projected depths with grades up to 91.22 g/t Au over 
a true width of 0.50m.  Eleven holes were drilled into the Deep B shoot located 
immediately below the existing underground development to fill-in the drill spacing to 
less than 25 meters and to define the perimeter of the known mineralization.  Two holes 
were drilled on the west side of the existing open pit to help determine the feasibility of a 
pit expansion to the west. The Gold Creek West vein located approximately 450m 
southwest of the existing open pit was tested with four holes in two 50 meter step-outs to 
the west of the existing grid.  Two holes were drilled into the Bullion Creek structure 
located 700 meters to the north of the open pit to test a geochemical anomaly. 

In 2003, a total of 6570 meters of NQ diamond drilling in 30 holes was carried out in the 
Siwash North area to further test the WD zone.  A sub parallel vein, the WD2 vein, was 
intersected about 30m below the WD vein on the west side of the grid and found to 
contain significant gold grades."

 6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING  

6.1 Regional Geology (taken from King and Minfile Database) 

The Elk property, located within the Intermontane tectonic belt of south-central British 
Columbia, is underlain by Upper Triassic volcanics and sediments of the Nicola Group 
and by Middle Jurassic granites and granodiorites of the Osprey Lake batholith (see 
Figure 1).  The contact between the Nicola and Osprey Lake batholith trends NNE 
across the western part of the claim block.  Early Tertiary quartz feldspar porphyry 
dykes and stocks from the Otter Intrusives occur within the property.  Breccias 
consisting of rounded volcanic, dioritic and granite fragments in a granitic matrix cross 
cut Nicola, Osprey Lake and Otter rocks.  The breccia units, which may be parts of 
major fault structures, form elongate bodies 5 to 30 metres wide striking north-easterly.  
The youngest units mapped on the property are andesite dykes which cut all of the 
above lithologies. 

6.2 Local Geology  

Nicola Group lithologies mapped on the Elk property consist of dark greyish green 
massive, basaltic andesite (some porphyritic containing pyroxene and/or amphibole 
phenocrysts and some containing 0.5 mm laminae of sand-sized black grains); pale 
grey-green siliceous laminated tuff; and brownish green to pale green agglomerates 
containing fragments from 5-50 cm in size.

The Osprey Lake batholith is composed of pinkish grey, medium to coarse-grained, 
equagranular quartz monzonite to granodiorite.  Pink, sugary textured aplite dykes often 
cut the quartz monzonite.  Less common quartz diorite stocks, thought to be related to 
the batholith, and dykes of quartz monzonite and hornblende-biotite-quartz monzonite 
occur locally.

The Otter Intrusions are made up of quartz feldspar porphyry, feldspar porphyry and 
quartz-biotite-feldspar dykes and stocks. 

The younger andesite dykes are dark greyish green, fine grained and vary in thickness 
from 30 cm to 5 metres.  Mineralization appears to be spatially associated with these 
(Tertiary?) andesite dykes which are locally cut by quartz veins. 

6.3 Alteration 

The Nicola volcanics and sediments are occasionally silicified, carbonatized or epidote 
altered.  Within the Osprey Lake batholith alteration consists of weak to strong 
propylitic, argillic, phyllic and silicic assemblages.  The Otter quartz feldspar porphyry is 
extensively clay altered while the andesite dykes are commonly muscovite-altered with 
brown weathering. 

Stronger alteration generally accompanies higher gold grades.  The following types of 
alteration have been recognized in the granitic rocks found on the Elk property, namely:  



Page 14 

 propylitic – light green with biotite and hornblende altered to chlorite and 
plagioclase saussuritized.  In volcanics the colour is generally olive green and the 
rocks are soft. 

 argillic – bleached rock with plagioclase white and clay altered and potassium 
feldspar slightly altered.  Volcanics are bleached to light green or grey. 

 sericitic – pale green with a micaceous sheen with plagioclase altered to sericite.  
This style of alteration is often associated with quartz veins and appears to be 
the lowest grade alteration associated with gold mineralization. 

 potassium feldspar stable phyllic – light pink green or yellowish with potassium 
feldspar fresh, pink and blocky.  Plagioclase and mafic minerals are altered to 
fine-grained quartz-sericite-pyrite.  This style of alteration is often associated with 
gold mineralization in veins. 

 phyllic – generally grey, fine-grained quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration usually 
associated with gold bearing quartz veins. 

 advanced argillic – often sheared and white in colour with most or all feldspar 
destroyed and quartz free-floating.  Often associated with quartz veins.  Volcanic 
rocks are white or blue in colour. 

 silicic – quartz veining or replacement with moderate conchoidal fractures. 

There is a strong symmetrical zoning reported for alteration surrounding quartz veins, 
ranging outward from vein  to advanced argillic to phyllic to potassium feldspar stable 
phyllic to argillic to propylitic. 

Locally and apparently unrelated to mineralization potassic alteration, skarnification and 
silicification are evident. 

6.4 Structure 

The Nicola volcanics and sediments on the west side of the Elk property dip 
approximately 60o W and form the east limb of a syncline trending roughly north-south 
and with axis about 5 km west of the property. The contact between Nicola volcanics 
and Osprey Lake granodiorite trends NNE and dips irregularly and moderately to the 
east.

Several prominent linear features occupied by Siwash Creek, Elusive Creek and an 
unnamed creek trend north to northeast. Subtle east-northeast lineaments interpreted 
from air photographs are thought to be vein structures occurring within the granitic rocks 
of the Osprey Lake Batholith. 

A fracture/fault system striking 60o to 80o and dipping from 20o to 75o to the southeast 
controls the predominant Siwash North Vein System made up of the WD, B, A, E and X 
veins.  A second fracture set located about 400 metres southwest of the Siwash North 
system strikes 110o to 160o and dips 45o to 60o southwest, hosts the Gold Creek West 
Zone.



Page 15 

Peter Lewis examined exposures of the Siwash North vein in the open pit area and 
concluded the veins could be divided into three segments (Lewis, 2000).  The western 
most segment consists of sub-parallel, southeast dipping, en-echelon veins 
concentrated within a 10 m wide zone.  The central segment consists of a single south-
dipping structure.  The eastern segment consists of several sub-parallel splays.  Both 
the western and central segments dip to the south at shallow angles near surface 
(about 20o) and steepen abruptly to 60o to 70o below the open pit or below 1625 
elevation.  Veins in the eastern segment have consistent moderate dips. 

7.0 DEPOSIT TYPE 

Gold mineralization found on the Elk property occurs within narrow, structurally 
controlled pyritic gold-silver bearing quartz veins with characteristics similar to 
mesothermal deposits.  Mesothermal deposits are defined by Park and MacDiarmid 
(Park and MacDiarmid, 1964) as deposits formed at moderate temperatures (200-300o
C) and pressures.

Fluid inclusion studies (Geiger, 2000) indicate a lithostatic pressure of 2.5 kilo bars and 
a minimum temperature of formation of 250o C which would be indicative of a depth of 
approximately 7 km.

The veins occur in granitic rocks near the contact between a major batholith and 
basaltic volcanic rocks.  The gold-silver mineralization is thought to be Tertiary in age 
and associated with the intrusion of the Tertiary Otter dykes and stocks. 

7.1 Geologic Model 

The geological block model for Siwash was based on the structural interpretation of the 
various veins (see Figure 3).  The main Siwash North B vein system was modeled using 
the recorded structure as a guide.  The RBF fault was used to separate the vein into a 
western segment striking more or less grid east-west and an eastern segment (B East) 
striking N 60o E dipping about 20o S.  The western segment was further subdivided into 
a near surface flat dipping (20o S) segment labelled B Flat which extends from surface 
down to 1610 elevation and a more steeply dipping segment below 1610 elevation 
dipping about 60o S labelled B Steep. 

8.0 MINERALIZATION  

Gold-silver mineralization on the Elk property is hosted primarily by pyritic quartz veins 
and stringers within altered granite and in some cases volcanic rocks.  Cross cutting 
relationships have indicated the veins are Tertiary in age and quite possibly related to 
the Tertiary Otter Intrusions.

Gold occurs primarily as fine grained native gold (less than 50 microns) in fine flakes 
within quartz, in quartz-pyrite stockworks and in fractures within veins.  Gold is closely 
associated with pyrite with minor minerals such as chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, 
tetrahedrite and pyrrhotite sometimes present. 

Gangue mineralogy consists of quartz and altered wall rock clasts with minor amounts 
of ankerite, calcite, barite and fluorite occurring locally. 

To date eight mineralized vein systems have been identified by either drilling, trenching 
or prospecting on the Siwash (Elk) Property.  These systems have been discussed in 
detail in King, 2001 and will not be reproduced here.  The two main veins systems for 
which a resource has been calculated are the Siwash North and WD veins (see Figure 
4).

The Siwash North B Vein is the most significant vein on the property at this time and 
has been drill tested and mined by both open pit and underground methods.  This vein 
has been traced over 950 m of strike length along a north-easterly direction and ranges 
in width from 0.1 to 3 m in true width.  The dip is shallow averaging about 20o near 
surface and below about 1610 elevation the dip steepens to from 60 to 75o.   The vein 
begins near the volcanic/granodiorite contact and extends eastward in granodiorite as a 
more or less discrete vein.  As the vein approaches and crosses the granodiorite/quartz 
monzonite contact it splits into a number of splays labelled Ba, Bb, Bc etc. 

A number of individual ore shoots have been delineated by extensive diamond drilling, 
both from surface and underground.  The most prominent of these shoots has been 
called the Mother Shoot and is located near the western end of the Siwash North B Vein 
within the granodiorite.  This Mother Shoot is about 200 m in length and has been 
mined near surface in an open pit and tested at depth by underground development.

Along strike several other veins numbered A, C, D, E, F and X have been identified over 
short intervals but are not considered in this resource estimate. 

The second vein of interest is the WD vein located roughly parallel to the B vein some 
140 m north.  This structure has been trace over 600 m along strike and 350 m down 
dip by surface diamond drilling.  True widths vary from .3 to 1.2 m.  A second lower vein 
labelled WD2 or WDb has been identified on a number of sections but at this time is still 
too discontinuous to estimate.

9.0 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Surface and Underground Exploration 

The various exploration programs completed on this property from 1986 to 2000 have 
been described in detail by L. King (King, 2001) and are not reproduced here.  The 
following table contains a summary of the kind and amount of exploration completed up 
to 2000.  In 2004 property work consisted of minor trenching and road building, 15.8 km.

9.2 Mining Summary (Jakubowski, 2000) 

During 1992 a small open pit (Bulk Sample) was excavated to mine the near surface 
exposure of the Siwash B vein.  In this area the vein is shallow dipping with high gold 
grades and an average thickness of 0.3 m.  The mining procedure was highly selective 
and tightly controlled using small equipment.  The bulk sample totalled 2,040 tonnes 
(2240 tons) and averaged 137.7 g/t (4.016 oz/t) gold.   A small crushing/sampling plant 
was installed to provide grade control.  Ore was shipped to Noranda's Horne smelter in 
Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec for metallurgical testing and smelting. 

In 1993 open pit mining continued with the extraction of 3,387 tonnes (3733 tons) of 
bulk sample material grading 105.6 g/t (3.080 oz/t) Au.  The material was crushed on 
site to minus 6 inches and then shipped to ASARCO's smelter in Helena, Montana. 

In 1994, the Company received a mining permit and the open pit was expanded and 
9,180 tonnes (10,119 tons) of ore grading 91.5 gm/t (2.669 oz/t) were extracted. 

From 1992 to 1994 a total of 14,720 tonnes of vein material was mined from the top 40 
metres of the B Vein producing 1,481,000 gms (47,600 ozs) of gold.  A total of about 
1.25 million tonnes of waste was taken from the hanging wall of the vein to allow 
extraction.  The average grade of mined vein material was 100.6 g/t (2.93 oz/ton) gold. 

In 1993 a program of underground development was initiated to test both the shallow 
and more steeply dipping portions of the B Vein.  A decline, 985 m in length was driven 
at -15o in the footwall of the B Vein to access high grade gold shoots. Two vein drifts 
were developed for test mining, one on the 1570 level to access the steeply dipping limb 
of the vein, and a second on the 1611 level immediately down dip from the central core 
of the open pit on the flat dipping limb. Drifting on the 1570 level produced about 140 
tonnes (154 tons) of ore grading 36 gm Au/t (1.1 oz/t), whereupon the drift was 
abandoned and refilled due to poor ground conditions. Three raises at 5 metre centres, 
totaling 36 metres in length were driven up dip off the 1611 level drift. Following 



Page 20 

development of the raises, the quartz vein was stoped from the pillars producing about 
315 tonnes (347 tons) of ore grading approximately 70 gm/t (2.042 oz/t) Au. A total of 
175 m of drifting on veins was completed on four levels.

During 1994, the 1611 level drift was extended to the west. Five raises were added and 
the existing ones lengthened to the 1620m elevation. Approximately 1,200 tonnes (1323 
tons) of quartz vein material, grading about 78 gm/t (2.275 oz/ton) Au, were extracted.  
An underground diamond drilling program was carried out between April 7 and May 31, 
with 5,000 m of core drilled in 84 holes from the existing decline to define ore reserves. 
A total of 448 core samples were collected. 

Further underground development was undertaken on completion of the open pit, with 
the main decline extended 330 metres.  A second decline branched east from the main 
ramp, for a length of 185 metres. Test mining was carried out on two levels.  A longhole 
stoping test on the 1584 level produced 95 tonnes (105 tons) at 16.5 gm/t (0.48 oz/ton) 
from drifting on the ore.  Longhole blasting produced excessive dilution and most of the 
material remains in the stope.  On the 1589 level, a shrinkage stope test was 
undertaken. Stoping was completed about 6 metres up dip along the 30 metre length of 
the drift.  About 105 tonnes (116 tons) at 15 gm/t (0.438 oz/t) Au were hauled to 
surface, however, much of the material remains in the stope. 

In 1995 a mining engineer, J. McCormack was retained to summarize the Reserves and 
Project Economics of the Siwash Gold Mine.  He concluded that the test mining showed 
the hanging wall ground conditions within 1.5 to 2 m of the vein are poor due to 
extensive faulting, jointing and intense alteration.  As a result all underground openings 
require substantial support during mining operations.  McCormack recommended panel 
stoping for flatter lying ore bodies and conventional cut and fill for steeply dipping veins.  
McCormack further concluded that concern over ground conditions, vein continuity and 
a limited reserve made committing to an underground production program risky at that 
time.  A summary of the mining production is reproduced from the report by J. 
McCormack, 1995 as Table 3 and a plan is shown as Figure 5.

and the production from 1993 on was shipped to the Asarco smelter at Helena, 
Montana for processing as a high grade silica flux. 

9.3 2006 Exploration Program 

The 2006 exploration program on the Elk claims consisted of diamond drilling, core 
logging and sampling.  A total of 8873 meters of NQ diamond drilling in 58 holes was 
carried out in the Siwash North area to further test the WD, B and in the Siwash East 
area to test mineralization exposed by trenching.  Excavator trenching was undertaken 
in the Elusive Creek area and a soil sample survey was carried out on the new claims 
on the northwest side of the property. The trenching and soil sampling programs are 
not described in this report.

10.0 DRILLING 

Drilling completed prior to 2005 has been summarized in previous reports see Giroux, 
2004.    The 2005 exploration program on the Elk claims consisted of diamond drilling, 
core logging and sampling.   A total of 8,395 meters of NQ diamond drilling in 36 holes 
was carried out in the Siwash North area to further test the WD, B and Siwash Lake 
zones.  A field camp was built approximately two kilometers south of the mine site to 
house the crew during the drill program.

The 2006 drill program is described by Jakubowski  

"Selected assay results listed below in Table 5.  Seventeen holes were drilled into the B 
and Deep B (B zone below 1400m elevation) zones between 2040E and 2520E to 
extend the known mineralization down dip and along strike.

Thirty seven holes were drilled into the WD zone to define the near surface vein and 
gold grade continuity. 

The Siwash East area mineralization exposed by trenching was tested with four holes 
on a fifty meter grid. 

The B zone was intersected at or near the projected location in all holes.  The Deep B 
zone (the B zone below 1400m elevation) was intersected at the projected locations and 
appears to flatten at depth to -30 degrees (sections 2040E and 2140E).  The Deep C 
vein, defined on section 2140E in 2005, was found not to be continuous to depth. The 
2006 drilling confirms the southwest trend of the Deep B high grade shoot between 
sections 2040E and 2140E and remains open at depth.

The B zone between 2260E and 2520E also flattens in dip at depth to -25 degrees.  
Numerous low grade quartz stringers were intersected over wide intervals below the B 
zone.

The WD zones to the west of the north-northwest trending RB fault were tested by 12 
holes between 2135E and 2285E.  All the holes intersected the WD system, which is 
made up of two to four sub-parallel veins (WD, WD2, WD3, WD4) dipping 45 degrees to 
the south over a twenty to forty meter width.  Twenty five holes were drilled to the east 
of the RB fault between 2320E and 2720E all of which intersected the WD veins at the 
projected locations. 

The WD vein system dips about -55 degrees to the south on the east side of the RB 
fault and flattens to about -25 degrees above the 1580m elevation. The WD vein system 
is made up of two to three sub parallel veins: the WD vein which occasionally splits into 
two closely spaced veins (WDa and WDb) and the WD2 about 25m below.  All holes 
intersected the veins at the targeted locations.

Four holes were drilled into the Siwash East zone on two fences fifty meters apart 
between 4100E and 4150E.  They were targeted to intersect mineralized quartz veins 
50 meters down-dip from veins exposed on surface.  The veins occur adjacent to an 
andesite dyke that trends about 65 degrees and dips -65 degrees to the south. The 
veins are discontinuous and have been noted on the north side of the dyke that splits 
and varies in width from one to three meters.  The drill holes intersected mineralized 
quartz veins in all four holes but no significant grades were returned."

11.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

The drilling and sampling at Siwash has been completed under the supervision of 
Qualified Person Wojtek Jakubowski since 1987.  Sections covering sampling methods 
and analytical procedures have been taken from Jakubowski, 2000.  These procedures 
have been continued on all drill programs up to and including 2006. 

Drill sites were leveled and prepared using an excavator or tractor and sumps were dug 
to contain cuttings. The skid mounted drill was moved between sites using a tractor. 
Water was pumped to the drill from Bullion Creek, Gold Creek and the open pit.

Upon receipt, the core was washed, footage blocks converted to metres, and the 
recovery, RQD (rock quality determination), hardness, and degree of breakage were 
measured.  All core was photographed at four boxes to the frame, and selected 
intervals were photographed at five frames per core box. The geology, geotechnical 
information, and sample intervals were logged onto hand-held HP200LX palm-top 
computers, and were later down-loaded onto a desktop computer.

All samples were split and every twentieth sample was quartered for duplicate analysis 
as part of the quality control process. Samples were shipped to Acme Analytical 
Laboratories Ltd. in Vancouver, B.C. and assayed or analyzed for gold. Thirty element 
ICP analysis was also performed on samples containing quartz vein.  

Specific gravity measurements using a scale were made on selected mineralized zones.  
Drill hole orientations were measured at surface with a transit or Brunton compass, and 
downhole with a Sperry Sun single shot camera (1989-2003) and with an Icefield down 
hole survey tool (2004-2005). On completion of the hole, the casing was removed and 
replaced with a section of 2.5 inch diameter PVC pipe.  The drill hole collar locations 
were surveyed relative to pre-established control points using an EDM and theodolite.

12.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

As in previous drill campaigns drill core samples were shipped to Acme Analytical 
Laboratories in Vancouver for gold analysis.  Sample preparation and analysis methods 
varied based on material sampled. All samples were split and every twentieth sample 
was quartered for quality control purposes.

Samples that were expected to have significant gold content were split and half the core 
was submitted to the lab, in contrast to previous years when the entire core was 
assayed.  Typically, this material consisted of quartz vein with or without wall rock, at 
least 10 to 1 cm thick with a minimum of 10% sulphide (or traces of visible gold). These 
samples were crushed in their entirety to -3/16" and coarse pulverized to -1/16".  Two kg 
of the -1/16" material was split out and pulverized to 99% finer than -150 mesh and 
sieved on a 150 mesh screen.  One Assay Ton (1 AT) of the -150 mesh fraction was 
assayed for gold and silver, and was combined with the weighted result of gold and 
silver fire assays of the entire coarse fraction, to give total gold and silver values.  ICP 
analysis for 35 elements was also carried out on a 0.50 gm sample of -100 mesh 



Page 27 

material. This technique is referred to as the Sieve and Assay method. Selected high 
grade intercepts were checked by re-sampling from the reject and assaying for gold by 
the same method.

Samples which were expected to be of lower grade were comprised of half the core split 
along its length. This material usually consisted of quartz vein material less than I0 cm 
thick with less than 10% sulphide, and/or wall rock.  At the lab the entire sample was 
crushed to -3/16", then 2 kg were split out and coarse pulverized to -1/16".   A 250 gm 
split was then taken and pulverized to -100 mesh.  A one-assay ton (1 AT) sample was 
fire assayed for gold and silver. Thirty-five element ICP analysis was usually carried out.  
Higher grade intercepts were re-assayed using the Sieve and Assay method described 
above.

Samples that were not expected to carry high gold values, typically stringers with 
varying sulfide in alteration, or material of scientific interest, were split in half prior to 
shipping. After shipment to the lab the entire sample was crushed to -3/16", 250 gm of 
sample split out and pulverized to -100 mesh.  A 20 gm sample of the -100 mesh 
material was analyzed for Au by ICP-MS using acid extraction.  Samples that returned 
higher than expected values were assayed using the next higher confidence sampling 
procedure. These assays generally returned values lower than the originals. This may 
be due to the larger sample size reducing the nugget effect.

13.0 DATA VERIFICTION 

Data verification programs completed prior to 2006 have been described in earlier 43-
101 reports (see Giroux, 2006). 

13.1 2006 

The QA/QC program used in 2006 is described by Qualified Person, Jakubowski who 
supervised it.

"All drill core samples were split in order to leave half of the sample for future check 
sampling or inspection.  Samples from the first sixteen holes were variably sent for 
G1DX, 3A or G6 analysis. Beginning with drill hole SND06-462, all samples were sent 
for G1DX and G6 analysis.  A large number of comparative gold results were 
generated. A direct comparison is shown on Figure 6.  The overall correlation appears 
to be fairly good, particularly below 10g/t.  Above that level scatter increases, which can 
be attributed to nugget effect at higher grades. The plot of % Variability vs Average 
Grade (Figure 7) indicates that the variability between values at the lower end of the 
scale (<10g/t) is much greater than that for values at the higher end.

Half of every thirtieth sample was given the next sequential sample number and sent to 
the laboratory as a duplicate.  All of these samples were analyzed using a wet chemical 
technique and most were submitted for fire assay.  The results are presented in Table 6 
and Figure 8.  The variability between wet geochemical results ranges from 2.8% to 
197.1% (mean 72.5%) while for fire assay results on the same samples the variability 
ranges from 0% to 178.9% (mean 46.8%). All but one fire assay pair have variabilities 
less than 110%. This range in variabilities indicates that there is a strong nugget effect.

Blank samples were submitted to the laboratory with the same frequency as the 
duplicates. The blank samples were taken from unaltered granodiorite or quartz 
monzonite core that contained no quartz veining.  The purpose of including blanks in the 
sample stream was to confirm that no contamination occurred in the sampling or 
analysis procedures. One sample, SED06449-6, had a marginally higher value (76.5ppb 
Au) but it is not significant.  The results for all the blank samples analyzed since 2000 
are shown in Table 7.

Acme Analytical Laboratories routinely re-sampled and re-analyzed pulps and rejects as 
part of their analytical procedure.  The results for 2006 are given in Table 8 and Figures 
9 and 10.  The average variability of the wet geochemical numbers is twice that of the 
assay numbers (88% vs 42%) but the variability amongst all the numbers (six analyses 
per sample) is 112.5%.  The range in percent variability among the wet geochemical 
numbers is 0.6% to 275.7%, while that for the fire assay numbers is narrower, 4.62% to 
133.33%.  High variability numbers indicate a strong nugget effect, particularly in 
samples analyzed by fire assay.  The high variability among all the results and in the 
wet geochemical results is probably due to the difference in sample weight – 0.5gm for 
wet geochemical analysis vs 30gm for fire assay.

Standard pulp samples were introduced into the sample stream, by both Almaden 
Minerals Ltd. and Acme, to check the consistency of the assay laboratory procedures.  
Almaden used three standards (9.78+/- 0.53 g/t, 33.5 +/- 1.7 g/t and 35.25 +/- 1.21 g/t) 
during 2006, purchased from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Delta, BC.  Initially, a 
fifteen gram aliquot of one of these standards was submitted to Acme with each blank 
and duplicate sample.  This was later increased to 30 grams. The results are tabulated 
in Table 9.  The mean of 26 wet chemical values for the 9780ppb pulp is 8416.7ppb, 
and the variability between these values is 65.4%. For the 23 assay values for the same 
pulp the mean is 9.83g/t, and the variability is 19.74%. In general, the wet geochemical 
results (0.5gm sample) deviated from the mean much more than the fire assay results 
(15 to 30gm sample), probably because of the much smaller sample size.

NOTE: The deviation from a standard value was derived as follows: If the analytical result fell within the range of the 
  standard value  plus or minus the error  (34.04-36.46 gm/t or 9.22-10.28 gm/t) a zero deviation was assigned. 
  For the results above the upper limit or below the lower limit the percent deviation was calculated.

A number of samples were selected for check assaying by ALS Chemex laboratories in 
Vancouver.  The pulps were sent from Acme to Chemex and assayed for gold.  The 
samples were then re-numbered and returned to Acme for re-assay.  Figure 11 
indicates that, with two exceptions, Acme's repeatability is satisfactory. Examination of 
Figure 12 shows that there is more variability in the 2006 results (6 of 13 results with > 
50% variability) than in previous years (7 of 67 results with > 50% variability).

The results from the QA/QC tests indicate no analytical bias from the laboratories, no 
contamination and in general large random errors attached to duplicate samples.  
These large errors are to be expected in this style of mineralization where nugget 
effects are extreme.  These tests explain why the sampling procedure at Siwash has 
developed over the years with lower precision geochemical ICP analysis for gold at 
lower levels, fire assay analysis for higher grade mineralization and metallic screen 
analysis for the samples with highest gold grades.  The results of these tests combined 
with the production history for this property indicate the data base is of sufficient quality 
to produce a reliable resource estimate.

15.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Since 1990 a number of companies have completed preliminary metallurgical test on 
Siwash samples including: 
 - 1990 – Placer Dome Inc. completed gravity and cyanidation testing 
 - 1992 – Brenda Mines Ltd. carried out gravity, flotation, cyanidation, acid-

base accounting and ICP analysis of the tails 
- 1992 – Bacon & Donaldson carried out gravity, flotation, cyanidation and 
acid base accounting 

 - 1993 – McGill University completed gravity testing 

R.M. Samuels summarized the metallurgical tests in a 1993 report (Samuels, 1993) to 
Fairfield Minerals as follows: 

 "The test results showed that the ore is free-milling and the gold is readily 
amenable to  recovery by gravity/flotation or gravity/cyanidation processes.  Recoveries 
in excess of  95% are predicted with recoveries of 99.5% achieved from a composite 
sample using a gravity/flotation circuit.  There are no deleterious elements in sufficient 
quantity to cause environmental or marketing problems and waste rock products are 
non-acid generating. 

The ore is of medium hardness with a work index of 10.9 kwh/ton.  Silver 
recoveries were 98.8% from gravity/flotation circuits and would be a viable by-product at 
silver to gold rations of 1:1.  Limited test work on tailings showed poor settling rates 
which may increase the operation costs." 

Samuels recommended treatment of the ore by a gravity/flotation circuit. 

16.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE   

16.1 Statistics for Resource Estimation 

The 2007 update on the Elk Property resource included the 54 diamond drill holes 
completed in 2006 (from SND06450 to SND06503) (see Figure 13).  The total number 
of holes in the data base was 853.  For the 2007 resource update a new geologic model 
was developed by Almaden geologists, with 25 separate structures modelled.  The 
individual statistics for each structure are shown below in Table 11.

For the purpose of statistical review and determining capping levels the veins were 
combined in the following groups:  

  WD veins (Codes 30 to 38)  
B veins (Codes 40 to 48)
Remaining Veins (Codes 39, 50 to 56) 
Waste (Code 99) 

Lognormal cumulative frequency plots were produced for each group of veins.

A total of 6 overlapping lognormal gold populations were found within the B Vein 
system.  Table 12 summarizes the parameters for these populations. Population 1 is 
considered erratic high grade and can be capped at 2 standard deviations above the 
mean of population 2.  A total of 2 assays were capped at 19.8 oz Au/t (679 g Au/t).

For this combination of other veins a capping level of 2 standard deviations above the 
mean of population 3 was used to mitigate the spreading of high values.  A total of 10 
gold assays were capped at 1.0 oz Au/t (34.3 g Au/t). 

All other assays not included in the Veins mentioned above and located outside the 
mineralized solids were grouped together and classed as waste.

For assays in waste a cap of 2 standard deviations above the mean of population 5 was 
selected to stop the spread of extremely high grades in the waste blocks.  A total of 243 
assays outside the mineralized solids were capped at 0.32 oz Au/t (11 g Au/t).

16.2 Compositing 

Drill holes were compared to the various mineralized vein solids and the point at which 
holes entered and left each solid was recorded.  Uniform down hole composites 0.5 m 
in length were formed to honour the mineralized solid boundaries.  Composites less 
than 0.25 m at the edge of solids were combined with the closest composite to form a 
uniform support of 0.5 ± 0.25 m.  A summary of the gold statistics from the composited 
veins is shown as Table 17.  Where veins were modelled but not assayed a value of 
0.0005 oz/t was inserted.  As a result the number of composites increases and average 
grades drop from individual assays. 

The WD and WDA veins were combined for modelling.

16.3 Semivariogram Analysis 

Pairwise relative semivariograms for gold were produced for the veins with enough 
information to model.  The B Vein (Code 40) was subdivided into a flat near surface 
zone and a deeper more steeply dipping zone based on a composites north location.  
Composites coded 40 were part of the flat zone if north of 3350 N and part of the steep 
zone if  3350 N.  Vein BM1 (Code 41) also had sufficient data to model.  The WD and 
WDA veins (Code 30) also had sufficient data to model.  Finally gold composites not 
included in any of the mineralized solids were modelled as waste.  In all veins 
anisotropy was demonstrated and nested spherical models fit to the data. In each case 
the best continuity was along strike and down dip.  For the across dip direction there 
was insufficient data to determine a model so a nominal 2.5 and 5.0 m were used for 
ranges.  Within waste a single isotropic nested spherical model was applied.

The remaining veins were assigned one of the above models based on their geographic 
position, strike and dip.  Veins 31 to 37 used the WD model.  Veins 39, 47, 50-53 and 
56 used the B vein (code 40) flat model.  Veins 42, 44, 48, 54 and 55 used the B vein 
(code 40) steep model.  Vein 46 used the B vein Flat model north of 3350 N and the B 
vein Steep model south of 3350 N.

16.4 Block Model Estimation  

Interpolation of gold grades into blocks was completed using ordinary kriging.  Blocks 
were estimated if they contained any percentage of vein material.  The semivariogram 
and search ellipse varied according to the vein being estimated (see Table 9).  A 
separate kriging run was completed for each vein using only the composites within that 
vein.  Pass 1 required a minimum of 4 composites to make an estimate.  Passes 2 to 4 
required finding only 2 composites, to make an estimate.  In all cases the maximum 
number of composites allowed was 12 and if more than 12 were found the closest 12 
were used.  The orientation and dimensions of the search ellipses were determined by 
the appropriate semivariograms.  For Pass 1 the dimensions were equal to ¼ of the 
semivariogram ranges in each direction.  Pass 2 used ½ the range, Pass 3 used the full 
range and Pass 4 used twice the range. 

After the grades for vein material was estimated all blocks containing some proportion 
of vein but less than 100% were re-estimated for dilution. The waste proportion of the 
block was estimated from all composites lying outside the veins.  Using this approach a 
reasonable grade for dilution could be established, based on the assays closest to the 
block.  In some cases, high gold grades sit outside the modelled veins and are included 
in this waste estimate.

16.5 Specific Gravity 

Specific gravities were assumed to be 2.75 for sulphide ore, 2.5 for oxide ore, or were 
calculated from the Fe, Pb, Cu, Zn contents of the samples when these element 
analyses were available. The specific gravities of 30 mineralized samples were also 
measured at the exploration site with a scale using weights in air and water.  A 
comparison of the measured specific gravities with the calculated is shown as Figure 
18.  There is good agreement (correlation coefficient of 0.661) and no bias indicated 
with samples scattering on either side of the equal value line. 

Each intersection in the 2D approach and each one metre composite in the 3D 
approach had an assigned specific gravity.  Inverse distance squared was used to 
interpolate specific gravity into each block in both models.

16.6 Classification 

16.61 Introduction 

Based on the study herein reported, delineated mineralization of the Elk Project is 
classified as a resource according to the following definition from National Instrument 
43-101 and CIM (2005): 

"In this Instrument, the terms "mineral resource", "inferred mineral resource", 
"indicated mineral resource" and "measured mineral resource" have the meanings 
ascribed to those terms by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum, as the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves adopted by CIM Council, as those definitions may be amended." 

The terms Measured, Indicated and Inferred are defined by CIM (2005) as follows: 

"A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural 
solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including 
base and precious metals, coal and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's 
crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has 
reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, 
estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge." 

"The term Mineral Resource covers mineralization and natural material of 
intrinsic economic interest which has been identified and estimated through 
exploration and sampling and within which Mineral Reserves may 
subsequently be defined by the consideration and application of technical, 
economic, legal, environmental, socio-economic and governmental factors.  
The phrase 'reasonable prospects for economic extraction' implies a 
judgement by the Qualified Person in respect of the technical and economic 
factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction.  A Mineral 
Resource is an inventory of mineralization that under realistically assumed 
and justifiable technical and economic conditions might become economically 
extractable.  These assumptions must be presented explicitly in both public 
and technical reports." 

Inferred Mineral Resource 
"An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for 

which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of 
geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not 
verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on limited 
information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, workings and drill holes." 

"Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral 
Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral 
Resource will be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as 
a result of continued exploration.  Confidence in the estimate is insufficient to 
allow the meaningful application of technical and economic parameters or to 



Page 52 

enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public disclosure.  
Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from estimates forming the 
basis of feasibility or other economic studies." 

Indicated Mineral Resource 
"An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for 

which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, 
can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate 
application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning 
and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based 
on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and 
grade continuity to be reasonably assumed." 

"Mineralization may be classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource by the 
Qualified Person when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are 
such as to allow confident interpretation of the geological framework and to 
reasonably assume the continuity of mineralization.  The Qualified Person 
must recognize the importance of the Indicated Mineral Resource category to 
the advancement of the feasibility of the project.  An Indicated Mineral 
Resource estimate is of sufficient quality to support a Preliminary Feasibility 
Study which can serve as the basis for major development decisions." 

Measured Mineral Resource 
"A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for 

which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics 
are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient 
to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to 
support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the 
deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling 
and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are 
spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity." 

"Mineralization or other natural material of economic interest may be 
classified as a Measured Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the 
nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such that the tonnage and 
grade of the mineralization can be estimated to within close limits and that 
variation from the estimate would not significantly affect potential economic 
viability.  This category requires a high level of confidence in, and 
understanding of, the geology and controls of the mineral deposit."

16.62 Results  

The geologic continuity at Siwash is excellent with the main B and WD veins clearly 
identified in all drill holes and at predicted locations in almost all cases.  The geologic 
continuity for the minor veins and vein splays is not as consistent with some veins 
pinching and disappearing from section to section.  Grade continuity can be quantified 
by semivariogram analysis with the directions and distances of maximum gold continuity 
determined for each vein. 

Classification of individual kriged blocks was based on a measure of the grade 
continuity, namely the semivariograms.  Blocks estimated during pass one with search 
ellipse limited to ¼ the semivariogram range, were classed measured.  Those estimated 
during pass 2 at ½ the range were classed as indicated.  All others were classed as 
inferred.

The results are presented as grade-tonnage tables for the mineralized portion of the 
blocks.  In other words the resource available if one could mine to the 3D Solid 
boundaries.  The resource is summarized at a series of possible open pit cutoffs below 
in Table 20 for all blocks above the 1580 level that might be accessible to an open pit 
and at some underground cutoffs in Table 21 for all blocks below the 1580 level that 
might be accessible to underground extraction.

The same resource can be tabulated with dilution applied for mining an entire block (10 
m x 2.5 m x 5 m).  The results are summarized for material above the 1580 level in 
Table 22 and below the 1580 level in Table 23.   

The actual tonnes and grade for both possible mining scenarios is probably between 
these two estimates.  Certainly some dilution will occur but probably not the entire block.

17.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

There is no other relevant data at this time. 

18.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Based on additional diamond drilling on the Elk Property completed in 2006 the 
resource present was re-estimated using geostatistical procedures.   

For this update a different approach was applied to the resource estimate.  Almaden 
geologists modeled a total of 25 separate mineralized structures on cross sections and 
combined these sections to from three dimensional solids.  The mineralized solids were 
grouped geographically into 3 vein sets: B-Veins, WD-Veins and Other veins not related 
to B or WD.  Composites were formed at 0.5 m intervals that honoured the solid 
boundaries.  Semivariograms were produced for structures with sufficient data to model.  
A block model consisting of blocks 10 m E-W, 2.5 m N-S and 5 m vertical was 
superimposed over the solids with blocks coded for the percentage of each solid 
present.  Gold grade was interpolated into each block with some proportion of 
mineralized structure present by ordinary kriging.  Blocks were classified as measured, 
indicated or inferred based on semivariogram parameters.  Results are summarized 
below at the various categories for the mineralized portion of the blocks.  This resource 
represents the mineral present if one could mine to the limits of the three dimensional 
solids.  No external dilution has been applied.  The resource is tabulated for a 1 g/t Au 
cutoff.

19.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Based on the results estimated for the Elk Vein Resource a preliminary economic 
assessment should be completed using reasonable metal prices and mining costs to 
determine the economic viability of this project.  This estimate is estimated to cost about 
$50,000.
