1 SUMMARY 
 
This technical report ("Report") was prepared by A.C.A. Howe International Limited ("Howe") 
at the request of Mr. Gary Powers, President & CEO of Sono Resources Inc. ("Sono"). This 
report is specific to the standards dictated by National Instrument 43-101, companion policy 
NI43-101CP and Form 43-101F (Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects) in respect to the 
Bear Claims ("Property") and focuses on Howe's assessment of the exploration potential of the 
known gold mineralised zones and the potential for additional mineralization occurrences within 
the Property area. 
 
Sono is a US public company that is listed on the OTCQB-SRCI and is incorporated in the state 
of Nevada with corporate offices located at Park Place, Suite 880-666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, 
BC.  Sono is engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of gold and 
copper projects located in North America and Africa. 
 
The Property is comprised of 46 contiguous state mineral estate claims located in Circle Mining 
District of Alaska.  The Property is centred at approximately UTM 580,000mE and 7,269,000mN 
(WGS84 Zone 6N 65°32'00" N, 145°15'30" W). 
 
The Bear Claims are located in east central Alaska, 120 miles northeast of Fairbanks (Figure 1). 
The Bear Claims consist of 46 contiguous unpatented state mining claims (Figure 2) covering 
approximately 1,960 hectares (4,840 acres).  
 
On May 4th, 2012 Sono announced that it had completed a  share exchange agreement, 
dated April 26, 2012 (the "Agreement"), with Alaska Metals Corp. ("Alaska Metals"), a 
British Columbia based private company, w h e r e b y  each of the shareholders of Alaska 
Metals (each a "Vendor" and collectively, the "Vendors"), Sono has acquired all of the 
issued and outstanding shares of Alaska Metals in exchange for the issuance of 12,500,000 
restricted shares of common stock of Sono to the Vendors on a pro rata basis in accordance 
with each Vendor's percentage ownership in Alaska  Metals.  Alaska Metals is the sole 
shareholder of Alaska Metals & Mining Corp.("AMM") , an Alaska company, which is the 
holder of the right to acquire a 100% interest in and to 46 contiguous state mineral estate 
claims covering approximately 4,840 acres (the "Bear Claims") located in central Alaska 
120 miles northeast of Fairbanks, Alaska in the Central Mining District. 
 
As a result of the closing of the Agreement, Alaska Metals has become Sono's direct 
wholly owned subsidiary and Alaska Metals & Mining Corp. ("AMM") has become 
Sono's indirect wholly owned subsidiary. 
 
The Bear Claims Property is held in the names of Wayne Michael Peppler and Wayne Louis 
Peppler of Fairbanks, Alaska whereby they own a 100% interest in the claims.   
 
AMM entered into an option agreement with Wayne Louis Peppler and Wayne Michael Peppler 
("the Vendors") dated September 21, 2010 whereby the Vendors granted an exclusive lease and 
option agreement to AMM to acquire a 100% interest in all of the Bear Claims ("the Property").  
AMM's obligations were: 



 

iii 
 

 
 On the 24th November 2010 after signing the Vendors were paid $25,000.00 upon receipt 

of the Title Opinion; 
 On the 5th May 2011 $25,000.00 was paid to the Vendors; 
 On the 13th September 2011 $25,000.00 was paid in accordance with 3 (a) (iii) of the 

Agreement; 
 The next property payment of $75,000.00 is due on the 24th November 2012 in 

accordance with 3 (a) (iv); 
 At the election of AMM either: 

  a. On November 24, 2013 $3,000,000.00 is to be paid; or 
  b. A further $3,150,000.00 is to be paid as follows: 
   i) a further $75,000.00 on the 24th November 2013; 
   ii) a further $75,000.00 on the 24th November 2014; 
   iii) a further $3,000,000.00 on the 24th November 2015 
 
AMM will pay the Vendors a further US$2,000,000 in aggregate within six months of the receipt 
and the approval by any applicable securities regulator of a National Instrument 43-101 Technical 
Report containing a measured and indicated resource estimate of at least 500,000 ounces of gold 
or a measured and indicated resource estimate of gold and other minerals having a value of at 
least 500,000 ounces of gold. 
 
Placer gold mining in the Circle area has been continuous since 1893 and it is estimated that 1 
million ounces of gold have been recovered.  Placer mining remains active in all of the drainages 
that surround the Bear Claims, in particular, Miller Creek to the southeast, Mammoth Creek to 
the east, Porcupine Creek to the north and Bonanza Creek to the west. 
 
The only systematic exploration program within the Bear Claims was carried out was by BHP-
Utah International in 1990 and 1991.  This exploration work consisted of geological mapping, 
and soil and rock sampling as part of a larger program carried out on additional claims held by 
BHP at that time. This work included 1,321 soil samples and 287 rock samples. 
 
A trench located approximately 30 metres west of the road exposure along the Steese Highway 
was cleared by previous claim holders, Dale Mathews and Wayne Peppler Sr. 
 
The area is underlain by a sequence of Paleozoic-age metasedimentary and metavolcanic schists. 
The main sequences are referred to as, in chronological order, Lower Schist, Middle Schist and 
Quartzite, Upper Quartzite, Upper Schist and Thrust Plate Schist. These units trend in a 
northwest direction and have been intruded by a series of Cretaceous and Tertiary granite and 
granodiorite stocks and plugs and minor mafic dikes.  Most of the contacts between the schist 
units are mapped as thrust faults with south-southwest throw.  
 
The Porcupine Dome Antiform is a regional west-northwest trending structural feature that is 
offset by a series of parallel northeast trending high angle faults. The continental scale Tintina 
Fault Zone is about 5 km to the north of the Property. 
 
The main rock unit within the Bear Claims is the Lower Schist. These rocks consist of quartz-
muscovite and quartz-feldspar-chlorite-muscovite schist. Overlying this unit is the Middle Schist 
and Quartzite that consists of similar schist lithologies with interbedded quartzite. The latter has 



 

iv 
 

been intruded by a Tertiary mafic dike as well as quartz monzonite to granodiorite dikes exposed 
along a road cut on the Steese Highway. 
 
The Porcupine Dome Antiform is the main structural feature on the Property and it is along strike 
with a series of Tertiary intrusives that occur east of the Property. At least four parallel high angle 
NNE trending faults traverse the Property and are interpreted to have up to 4 kilometres of 
displacement to the northeast. Two northwest trending faults, Miller House and Brown Bear, 
have been mapped by BHP-Utah geologists. 
 
Howe has visited the Property and has reviewed the Property data generated by BHP-Utah in 
1991, including the soil and rock sampling surveys and airborne geophysics databases and maps. 
The author believes that the information and data presented to Howe by AMM are a reasonable 
and accurate representation of the Property and mineralization and are of sufficient quality to 
provide the basis for the conclusions and recommendations reached in this report. 
 
Previous work has shown that broad areas of geochemically anomalous gold occur in the Bear 
Claims. Gold occurs in association with arsenic and bismuth and appears to be structurally 
controlled. These observations are somewhat analogous to the producing Pogo mine 250 km (160 
miles) east. The presence of mineralized quartz monzonite dikes and a coincident resistivity 
anomaly is encouraging and may indicate a deeper mineralized intrusive body. Mapping, 
structural analysis and observations from placer miners in the area suggest the quartz-vein hosted 
mineralization may be focussed on the intersection of high angle faults and low angle thrust 
plates.  Check sampling by Arengi (2010) failed to reproduce values reported in previous grab 
sampling, however, geochemically anomalous values as well as an Au-As-Bi association was 
reproduced.  
 
In August 2011, Howe completed a re-interpretation of the original ADGGS aeromagnetic data 
that overlies the Property.  These data are useful for the identification of targets for RIRGS 
deposits.  The re-interpretation of the original ADGGS aeromagnetic data that overlies the 
Property has shown that the presence of large intrusive bodies associated with RIRGS deposits 
may be present on the Property.  Follow up conventional and MMI soil sampling has produced 
anomalous Au, As and Bi over the interpreted intrusive body.  The correlation of the soil 
geochemical results with the interpreted intrusive body suggests that gold mineralization may be 
present at depth. 
 
There is no reason to consider that the previous results are misrepresented. Howe is of the 
opinion that additional MMI sampling would likely refine the outline and size of the intrusive 
body.  Past exploration results are encouraging and the Bear Claims represent a good grass-roots 
exploration target with good access.  Further work is recommended, however, each stage of 
exploration should be contingent upon favourable results from the previous stage. 
 
Based on the available technical data, previous exploration history and current Sono exploration 
work, it is Howe's opinion that the Property warrants additional work and that Howe concurs 
with the exploration work program considered by Sono.  The proposed exploration program is 
described below: 
 



 

v 
 

1. Sono proposes to complete a ground IP survey over the interpreted intrusive body defined 
from the airborne geophysical re-interpretation study.  A total of 30 line km of IP at a line 
spacing of 100m is proposed; and, 

 
2. Sono proposes to complete detail geological mapping and the completion of additional 

MMI soil geochemical surveys over the proposed IP grid. 
 
The above IP survey and MMI soil geochemical survey will allow Sono to identify drilling 
targets for the Phase 2 work program. 
 
It is expected that the recommended Phase 1 work program would be completed by Sono within a 
four (4) month time frame.  A budget of approximately $230,000 is estimated for the Phase 1 
work program.   
 
Pending favourable results from the Phase 1 work program, Sono's proposed Phase 2 would 
consist of a detailed drilling program is estimated to cost $450,000.   
 
The estimated cost of the recommended Phase 1 and 2 work program is as follows: 
 
Phase 1 
 
IP survey (40 line km @ $4,625 per line km all inclusive)   $   185,000 
MMI soil sampling survey       $     30,000 
Geological mapping        $     15,000 
 
       Phase 1 Subtotal $    230,000 
 
Phase 2 
 
Diamond Drill Program (2,000m @ $150/m all incl.)   $   300,000 
Diamond Drill Program Assays (2000 @$30/sample)   $     60,000 
Exploration Capital Costs (lodging, vehicles etc.)    $     50,000 
Exploration Personnel and Consumables (2 months)    $     40,000 
 
       Phase 2 Subtotal  $    450,000 
 
      Phase 1 and 2 total  $    680,000

2.4 Units and Currency 
 
The Metric System or SI System is the primary system of measure and length used in this Report 
and is generally expressed in kilometres, metres and centimetres; volume is expressed as cubic 
metres, mass expressed as metric tonnes, area as hectares, and zinc, copper and lead grades as 
percent or parts per million. The precious metal grades are generally expressed as grams/tonne 
but may also be in parts per billion or parts per million. Conversions from the SI or Metric 
System to the Imperial System are provided below and quoted where practical. Many of the 
geologic publications and more recent work assessment files now use the SI system but older 
work assessment files almost exclusively refer to the Imperial System. Metals and minerals 
acronyms in this report conform to mineral industry accepted usage and the reader is directed to 
an online source at www.maden.hacettepe.edu.tr/dmmrt/index.html. 
 
Conversion factors utilized in this report include: 

 1 troy ounce/ton = 34.2857 grams/tonne 
 1 gram/tonne = 0.0292 troy ounces/ton 
 1 troy ounce = 31.1035 grams 
 1 gram = 0.0322 troy ounces 
 1 pound = 0.4536 kilograms 
 1 foot = 0.3048 metres 
 1 mile = 1.609 kilometres 
 1 acre = 0.4047 hectares 
 1 square mile = 2.590 square kilometres 

 
The term gram/tonne or g/t is expressed as "gram per tonne" where 1 gram/tonne = 1 ppm (part 
per million) = 1,000 ppb (part per billion). Other abbreviations include ppb = parts per billion; 
ppm = parts per million; oz/t = ounce per short ton; Moz = million ounces; Mt = million tonne; t 
= tonne (1,000 kilograms); SG = specific gravity; lb/t = pound/ton; and, st = short ton (2,000 
pounds). 
 
Dollars are expressed in US currency (US$) unless otherwise noted. 
 
Unless otherwise noted, Universal Transverse Mercator ("UTM") coordinates are provided in the 
datum of WGS84 Zone 6 North.

The Bear Claims consist of 46 contiguous unpatented state mining claims (Figure 2) covering 
approximately 1,960 hectares (4,840 acres).  
 

 
Figure 1. Property Location. 
 
There are no royalties, back-in rights or other agreements or encumbrances to which the Bear 
Claims are subject.  Permits are not required to conduct exploration work such as geological 
mapping and sampling, but are required for conducting trenching, pitting and drilling. Sono has 
acquired the required permits from the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Survey 
to conduct future exploration work on the Bear Claims. 
 
In Howe's opinion, there no significant factors and/or risks that may affect access, title or the 
right or ability to perform work on the Property.

Five of the claims show a partial overlap with existing claims.  The claim owners have informed 
Howe that the owners of those claims are amenable to an option arrangement that would include 
work on the Bear Claims.

The expiration date for each claim is annually, complying that all paperwork is due by the last 
day of November and that the lease payments (i.e. mining rent) on the claims are paid in full.  On 
September 30, 2011, a total of US$5,075 was paid to the State of Alaska Department of Natural 
Resources for the 2012 lease payments.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
5.1 Accessibility 
 
The claims are accessed year round from Fairbanks via the Steese Highway (Alaska Highway 6) 
for a distance of 190 kilometres (120 miles).  The Steese Highway is a secondary improved road, 
which transects the Property along the south and east.  An unimproved bush road assesses the 
north end of the claims.  The nearest settlement is at Central, a distance of 19 kilometres (12 
miles) east the Property.  
 
 
5.2 Climate 
 
The weather is typical of central Alaska, long cold winters and short summers.  Average winter 
temperature in Fairbanks is -21 degrees Celsius and average summer temperature is 15 degrees. 
Snow cover lasts from about mid-October to late April.  The area lies within the zone of 
permanent permafrost. 
 
 
5.3 Infrastructure 
 
There is no power in the area and water is readily available from the many bounding creeks.  The 
nearby town of Central Alaska has a population of 134 and has a local airport.   
 
 
5.4 Physiography 
 
The Property lies over an elevation of from 520 to 1100 metres above sea level (1700 to 3590 
feet). Tree line is about 820 metres (2700 feet). Below this elevation vegetation consists of 
spruce, birch and dwarf willow and above it is alpine tundra.  
 
 
5.5 Environmental Liabilities 
 
Howe is not aware of any environmental liabilities to which the Bear Claims may be subject to.   
 
Given the isolated location of the project, the environmental impact of the exploration program is 
minimal.  As per the mining industry's best management practice guidelines for all aspects of 
mineral exploration any environmental remediation required at this stage would comprise of 
back-filling drill pad and drill sumps, removal drill casing and de-commissioning of any 
buildings and camps.

6 PROPERTY HISTORY 
 
Placer gold mining in the Circle area has been continuous since 1893 and it is estimated that 1 
million ounces of gold have been recovered.  Placer mining remains active in all of the drainages 
that surround the Bear Claims, in particular, Miller Creek to the southeast, Mammoth Creek to 
the east, Porcupine Creek to the north and Bonanza Creek to the west. 
 
The only systematic exploration program within the Bear Claims was carried out by BHP-Utah 
International in 1990 and 1991.  This exploration work consisted of geological mapping, and soil 
and rock sampling as part of a larger program carried out on additional claims held by BHP at 
that time. This work included 1,321 soil samples and 287 rock samples. 
 
A trench located approximately 30 metres west of the road exposure along the Steese Highway 
was cleared by previous claim holders, Dale Mathews and Wayne Peppler Sr. 
 
A number of samples were collected by the claim holders at various times since the 1980's; these 
results are discussed in Section 12.0. There has been no exploration work carried out on the 
Property since 1991. 
 
 
6.1 BHP-Utah Work - 1991 
 
The only reported exploration on the Property was by BHP-Utah in 1991.  This work included 
geological mapping, detailed soil sampling along three grids labelled PDA-2,3 and 4 (Figure 3), 
follow up rock sampling on the soil grids (Figure 4) and channel sampling carried out in 5 areas 
labelled as ST-1 to ST-5. Details of this work are illustrated in Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8.

Figure 6. Road cut and trench sampling by BHP-Utah on the Bear Claims. 

 
A total of 1,321 soil samples were collected along approximately 180 line-kilometres (110 line-
miles) at approximate 135 metre (440 foot) intervals.  Details of sample locations and line 
spacing are not available. Samples were collected using a 1.2 metre long (4 foot) auger and 0.5 
metre (1.5 foot) shovel and often included soil and rock fragments. Several broad arsenic 
anomalies of >100 ppm with smaller overlapping gold anomalies (>20 ppb) were delineated. 
Figure 5 shows the only soil geochemical survey contoured results that is available from BHP-
Utah.  
 
A total of 852 rock samples were collected by BHP-Utah as part of a follow up lithogeochemical 
sampling program to the soil sampling program.  BHP-Utah's lithogeochemical sampling 
program was carried out over the coincident gold/arsenic soil anomalies. Sample location and 
results for arsenic and gold are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. Several parallel, 
discontinuous northwest trending gold anomalies (>20 ppb) 600 metres and 900 metres long were 
delineated. The highest value was 1.99 g/t Au from grid PDA-3. 
 
Detailed rock sampling was also carried out as follows (Figures 5 and 6): 
 

 24 channel chip samples at 3 metre (10 foot) intervals from a trench (91-1) located 30 
metres north of the Steese Highway 



 

18 
 

 218 channel-chip samples at 6 metre (20 foot) intervals along road cut ST-1 

 70 channel-chip samples at 6 metre intervals at ST-2 

 31 channel-chip samples at 6 metres intervals at ST-3 

 29 channel-chip samples at 6 metre intervals at ST-4 

 31 channel-chip samples at 6 metre intervals at ST-5 

 
A number of rock samples were geochemically anomalous, i.e. >100 ppb Au (0.10 g/t) over 3 to 
6 metre intervals, including 0.4 g/t Au over 12 metres at ST-1. The highest gold value in these 
samples was 1.15 g/t Au from a grab sample in trench 91-1. 
 
Wayne Peppler Sr. and Ron Thole (personal communication) have both stated independently to 
Howe that there is a quartz vein zone in the NE corner of T8N, R12E, section 10.  Thole reported 
a grab sample from that area returned >3.0 g/t Au.  Details for this sample are not available. 
 
 
6.2 Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys 
 
An airborne geophysical survey was carried out by Fugro Airborne Services and Stevens 
Exploration Management Corp. for the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys 
("ADGGS") in the Circle Mining District in 1993.  The survey was helicopter-supported and 
included aeromagnetic and EM methods flown at an elevation of 30 metres (100 feet) along line 
spacing of  400 metres (1,320 feet) in an area that included the Bear Claims.  A re-interpretation 
of the original aeromagnetic data was carried out by ADGGS in 2004 whereby a large resistivity 
anomaly was delineated over the current Property (Figure 7).  The coincidence of this resistivity 
anomaly with low tenor gold mineralization possibly associated with an intrusive is compelling.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
7.1 Regional Geology 
 
The area is underlain by a sequence of Paleozoic-age metasedimentary and metavolcanic schists. 
The main sequences are referred to as, in chronological order, Lower Schist, Middle Schist and 
Quartzite, Upper Quartzite, Upper Schist and Thrust Plate Schist. These units trend in a northwest 
direction and have been intruded by a series of Cretaceous and Tertiary granite and granodiorite 
stocks and plugs and minor mafic dikes (Figure 8). Most of the contacts between the schist units 
are mapped as thrust faults with south-southwest throw.  
 
The Porcupine Dome Antiform is a regional west-northwest trending structural feature that is 
offset by a series of parallel northeast trending high angle faults. The continental scale Tintina 
Fault Zone is about 5 km to the north of the Property. 
 

 
Figure 8. Regional Geology.

7.2 Property Geology 
 
The main rock unit within the Bear Claims is the Lower Schist. These rocks consist of quartz-
muscovite and quartz-feldspar-chlorite-muscovite schist. Overlying this unit is the Middle Schist 
and Quartzite that consists of similar schist lithologies with interbedded quartzite. The latter has 
been intruded by a Tertiary mafic dike as well as quartz monzonite to granodiorite dikes exposed 
along a road cut on the Steese Highway (Figure 9). 
 
The Porcupine Dome Antiform is the main structural feature on the Property and it is along strike 
with a series of Tertiary intrusives that occur east of the Property. At least four parallel high angle 
NNE trending faults traverse the Property and are interpreted to have up to 4 kilometres of 
displacement to the northeast. Two northwest trending faults, Miller House and Brown Bear, 
have been mapped by BHP geologists.

7.3 Mineralization 
 
Thole and Lockwood (1991) described the following types of gold mineralisation on the 
Property: 
 

 Quartz veins: folded and boudined, crosscutting to stockwork, crosscutting with Fe and 
Mn-oxides, base metal-rich; 

 Fracture controlled arsenopyrite replacement; 

 Mineralized quartz-monzonite dikes; 

 Clay-rich shear zones ("gouge"). 

 
A soil geochemical survey carried out by BHP-Utah in 1991 outlined a broad 8 km2 (3 mi2)) 
arsenic anomaly (>100 ppm) with locally coincident anomalous gold and bismuth.  Information 
for this work is incomplete.  
 
In addition to this grid sampling, a number of reconnaissance rock samples have been collected 
over the years.  Results from this sampling with >1000 ppb Au (0.03 oz/t) are presented in Table 
2.  Exact locations for some of the samples are not available.

8 DEPOSIT TYPE MODELS 
 
The gold mineralization defined to date on the Bear Claims property has geologic and 
geochemical signatures that are analogous to the Pogo deposit discovered by Teck.  These 
similarities include: 
 

 schists intruded by younger granite and granodiorite stocks and plugs, 
 gold mineralization associated with quartz veins, 
 Au-As-Bi geochemical signature. 

 
In addition, gold mineralization at the Bear Claims also occurs in narrow quartz monzonite dikes. 
On the basis of the above features the gold mineralization is attributed to an intrusive origin.  
 
As such, two deposit type models are proposed for the Bear Claims, intrusion related gold deposit 
such as the Pogo Deposit and reduced intrusion related gold deposits respectively. 
 
 
8.1 Overview of the Pogo Gold Deposit 
 
The Pogo gold deposit in eastern Alaska is defined as an intrusion-related gold deposit by Smith 
et al. (1999), in particular, contains quartz lodes with characteristics typical of a classic, shear 
zone-hosted, orogenic gold deposit. 
 
Gold-bearing veins within the Liese zone of the Pogo deposit display a two-stage evolutionary 
history that records temporal variation in kinematics, fluid chemistry and temperature. Several 
stacked shallow northwest-dipping shear veins are developed at Pogo, and collectively comprise 
the Liese Zone. Veins consist of: (1) early, narrow biotite-bearing shear veins; (2) white quartz 
veins with pyrite-arsenopyrite bands, referred to as main stage quartz veins, that have sericite-Fe-
Mg carbonate alteration envelopes and which exploit the early shear veins; and (3) extension 
veins that form as steeper offshoots from the main stage veins (Smith et al. 1999).  
 
The presence and orientation of oblique fabrics developed in the older biotite-bearing shear veins 
are indicative of top-to-the-south displacement under ductile to semi-brittle conditions at higher 
temperatures.  In contrast, the orientation of the extension veins and local sigmoidal shapes 
indicate a component of top-to-the-northwest normal displacement on the main stage veins in 
their present orientation, and brittle to semi-brittle conditions of formation.  Dolomite-sericite 
alteration surrounding main stage veins may represent late to post-mineral hydrothermal fluid 
exploitation of vein margins during ongoing normal displacement along vein systems Smith et al. 
(1999).   
 
All types of veining overprint 107–106 Ma, post-metamorphic granitic dykes.  Molybdenite in 
main stage quartz assemblages has returned Re-Os ages of 104.2±1.1 Ma, significantly older than 
96 to 91 Ma 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained from vein alteration assemblages that may reflect thermal 
resetting during post-mineral fault related hydrothermal activity, magmatism and/or retrograde 
cooling of the lithologic sequence.  Unlike typical mesothermal shear vein hosted gold systems, 
Pogo is temporally and tectonically separated from metamorphic deformation events, and has a 
comparable kinematic and geometric architecture to Cretaceous plutonic gold deposits in the 



 

24 
 

region Smith et al. (1999).  As such, Smith et al. (1999) have interpreted the Pogo deposit to have 
formed during a regional Cretaceous extensional event during multi-stage exploitation of 
extensional fault surfaces by hydrothermal fluid from a cooling magmatic source. 
 
 
8.2 Reduced Intrusion Related Gold Deposits 
 
The following section is taken from the Geological Survey of Canada's ("GSC") website 
(http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/mindep/synth_dep/gold/rirgs/index_e.php#geol. 
 
Reduced intrusion-related gold systems (RIRGS) are characterized by widespread arrays of 
sheeted auriferous quartz veins that preferentially form in the brittle carapace at the top of small 
plutons, where they form bulk-tonnage, low-grade Au deposits characterized by a Au-Bi-Te-W 
metal assemblage, such as the Fort Knox and Dublin Gulch deposits. RIRGS also include a wide 
range of intrusion-related mineral deposit styles (skarns, replacements, veins) that form within the 
region of hydrothermal infl uence surrounding the causative pluton, and are characterized by 
proximal Au-W-As and distal Ag-Pb-Zn metal associations, thereby generating a zoned mineral 
system. Plutons that generate RIRGS form in tectonic settings characterized by weak post-
collisional extension behind a thickened continental margin. Such settings are also conducive to 
the formation of W deposits, and thereby generate a regional Au-W metallogenic association, but 
individual plutons can generate both W and Au deposits. Associated magmas are diverse and 
have characteristics of I-, S-, and A-type granitoids. The most prolifi c Au systems comprise 
metaluminous, moderately reduced, moderately fractionated, biotite>>hornblende>pyroxene 
quartz monzonites that have mixed with volatile-rich lamprophyric melts. The magmas have a 
reduced primary oxidation state that form ilmenite-series plutons. This reduced state causes 
associated sulphide assemblages to be characterized by pyrrhotite, and quartz veins that host 
methane-rich inclusions. RIRGS mostly form at a depth of 5 to 7 km and generate mineralizing 
fluids that are low salinity, aqueous carbonic in composition and are, therefore, unlike typical 
porphyry Cu deposits. The RIRGS class was developed on well-studied examples in Yukon and 
Alaska. Other suggested Canadian examples are in southeastern British Columbia and New 
Brunswick; numerous global examples have been suggested, but many are controversial.

9 EXPLORATION 
 
The following sub-sections describe the exploration work carried out on the Bear Claims property 
by Alaska Metals Corp in 2011. 
 
 
9.1 Airborne Geophysical Data Re-Interpretation and Results 
 
In August 2011, Howe completed a re-interpretation of the original ADGGS aeromagnetic data 
that overlies the Property as stated in Section 6.2.  These data are useful for the identification of 
targets for RIRGS deposits. 
 
The geophysical re-interpretation was carried out by Mr. Jeremy Brett, M.Sc., P.Geo, Senior 
Geophysical Consultant with MPH Consulting Limited of Toronto, Ontario Canada. 
 
The data was imported into Geosoft software and the following airborne geophysical data re-
interpretation work was completed: 
 

 Total magnetic intensity data; and, 
 7200Hz frequency domain EM data (Apparent resistivity) 

 
9.1.1 Total Magnetic Intensity Data Interpretation 
 
According to Brett (2011), a subtle ~80 nanoTesla ESE-WNW trending discrete magnetic 
anomaly highs are also present on the Circle Property with km-scale (3km long by 1km wide) 
strike-lengths.  These conform to an idealized model for felsic intrusions associated with RIRGS 
deposits.  Positive magnetic anomalies may be due to elevated magnetite content in the felsic 
intrusions.  These felsic intrusives appear to be structurally controlled by an ESE-WNW trending 
regional fault/fracture pattern, which is roughly parallel to axis of a possible large 25km+ (?) 
strike-length elongated intrusive stock, that lies >2.5km to the NE of the Property.  The discrete 
magnetic highs on the Property may coincide with sub-cover (schist) alteration caps with possible 
low-grade gold and sulfide mineralization.  Fault / structural trends inferred by the magnetic data 
are to the NE-SW, E-W and ESE-WNW (115° azimuth) (Brett, 2011) (Figure 10). 
 
Magnetic modelling was carried out by Bret (2011) in order to establish the possible depth to the 
intrusives.  The magnetic modelling was focused along the L10000 and L10010 and the modelled 
depth are from 100m to 125m respectively. 
 
9.1.2 Resistivity Data Interpretation 
 
According to Brett (2011), a general E-W to ESE-WNW trending 10km-scale apparent resistivity 
anomaly low is present on the Property, consisting of smaller km-scale resistivity lows, trending 
ENE-WSW and ESE-WNW (070° and 115° azimuths respectively), which may be due to 
fracturing/faulting and alteration along these directions.  These data suggest that the apparent 
resistivity component of a ground Induced Polarization (IP) survey may be useful for identifying 
discrete faults/fractures and mineralization zones.

The identified target areas are part of a cluster of 15 of these short strike-length magnetic 
anomalies are present along a ESE-WNW trending corridor, parallel to a larger possible intrusive 
stock to the NE, outside of the Property. 
 
The target area is topographically a hill top. 
 
An IP grid has been recommended and has been identified in red on all maps for the 3km long by 
1km wide intrusive body.  This survey is recommended for the identification of faults/structures, 
alteration and mineralization within and around the intrusive body. 
 
 
9.2 Soil Geochemical Survey 
 
In 2011, AMM collected a total of 128 conventional soil geochemical samples were collected 
from a total of seven(7) E-W trending lines spaced from 100m to as far as 500m (Figure 12).  The 
conventional soil geochemical traverse lines were positioned in such a fashion in order to obtain 
soil geochemical values over the 3km by 1km wide re-interpreted airborne ground magnetic and 
EM geophysical target that occurs on the Property.  Each conventional soil geochemical sample 
was collected at a nominal 25m spacing along each cross-line (Figures 14 to 18).  Approximately 
1kg of sample was collected to a depth of 0.30m.  Each conventional soil geochemical sample 
was inserted into a polystyrene plastic bag that was then labelled with the sample number and 
UTM coordinate.  The conventional soil samples were then labelled with the sample number and 
line grid coordinate.  The conventional soil samples were then securely sealed for dispatch to 
SGS Canada in Toronto Ontario for sample analysis.  Sample preparation, analyses and security 
is discussed in Section 11. 
 
 
9.2.1 Results of the Conventional Soil Geochemical Sampling Program 
 
Of the 128 soil samples, sample L6-07 (in Area B) returned an anomalous gold value of 235ppb 
Au and As value of 553ppb As.  Several additional soil samples have coincident anomalous Au 
and As values (Figures 17 and 18). 
 
The anomalous Au and As sample points suggest that it correlates with the external boundary of 
the geophysically interpreted southeastern boundary of the intrusive body (see Figures 15 to 18).  
 
The Area A sampling grid's Line 11 has several anomalous Au soil sample points with values 
<85ppb Au which coincide with the northern edge interpreted intrusive body and structures 
(Figure 15 and 16).

9.3 MMI Soil Survey 
 
In 2011, AMM collected a total of 52 MMI orientation soil geochemical samples were collected 
from a total of two N-S trending cross lines spaced at 100m.  The MMI soil geochemical traverse 
lines were positioned in such a fashion in order to obtain soil geochemical values over the 3km 
long by 1km wide re-interpreted airborne ground magnetic and EM geophysical target that occurs 
on the Property.  Each MMI soil geochemical sample was collected at 25m spacing along each 
cross-line.  Approximately 300g of sample was collected to a depth of 0.30m for each.  Each 
MMI soil geochemical sample was inserted into a plastic bag that was then labelled with the 
sample number and UTM coordinate.  The MMI samples were then labelled with the sample 
number and line grid coordinate.  The MMI soil samples were then securely sealed for dispatch to 
SGS Canada in Toronto Ontario for sample analysis.  Sample preparation, analyses and security 
is discussed in Section 11. 
 
 
9.3.1 Results of the MMI Soil Geochemical Sampling Program 
 
Of the 52 soil samples, two returned gold values > 5ppb ppb Au along both cross-lines and are 
associated with the northern and southern boundary of the interpreted intrusive.  As well, several 
anaomalous As (>800ppb As) and Bi (>3ppb Bi) zones were identified and are located along the 
northern and southern margins of the intrusive body.  The Au, As and Bi MMI anomalies would 
suggest that they correlate with the internal boundary of the geophysically interpreted intrusive 
body (see Figures 19, 20 and 21).

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
 
11.1 BHP-Utah Sampling Programs 
 
It is presumed by Howe that all BHP-Utah sample collection was completed in a manner 
consistent with current industry standard sampling techniques.  
 
 
11.2 AMM Sampling Programs 
 
It is presumed by Howe that all of AMM's sample collection was completed in a manner 
consistent with current industry standard sampling techniques.  AMM submitted both MMI soil 
geochemical and rock samples from the Property to SGS Canada ("SGS") in Toronto Ontario for 
sample preparation and analysis.  SGS is an ISO 9000:2008 registered laboratory. 
 
 
11.3 MMI Soil Samples 
 
Each MMI soil geochemical sample was collected by AMM personnel at 25m spacing along each 
cross-line.  Approximately 300g of sample was collected to a depth of 0.30m for each.  Each 
MMI soil geochemical sample was inserted into a plastic bag that was then labelled with the 
sample number and UTM coordinate.  The MMI samples were then labelled with the sample 
number and line grid coordinate.  The MMI soil samples were then securely sealed for dispatch to 
SGS Canada in Toronto Ontario for sample analysis 
 
 
11.3.1 MMI Background Information 
 
The following sub-section is an extract from the SGS website 
(http://www.geochem.sgs.com/mmi-theory.htm). 
 
"Mobile Metal Ions ("MMI") is a term used to describe ions which have moved in the weathering 
zone and that are only weakly or loosely adsorbed by surface soil particles. It has now been 
proven in a Canadian Mining Industry Research Organization ("CAMIRO") study using Pb 
isotopes that these Mobile Metal Ions are transported from deeply-buried ore bodies to the 
surface.  Scientists from around the world have been studying this phenomenon for many years.  
 
Convection, electrochemistry, diffusion, capillary rise and seismic pumping are some of the 
theories which have been put forward.  However, research and case studies over known ore-
bodies have shown that mobile metal ions accumulate in surface soils above mineralization, 
indicating that the metals are derived from oxidation of the mineralization source.  Capillary rise 
is thought to be a very important process in the near surface environment (above the water table) 
which is responsible for maintenance of anomalies.  Figure 22 below demonstrates a hypothetical 
model by which mobile ions are released from ore bodies through a convective mechanism, 
migrate vertically and accumulate in surface soils. 
 



 

42 
 

 
 

Figure 22. MMI Convective Mechanism (source: SGS Canada) 
 
 
As the ions reach the surface, they attach themselves weakly (adsorb) to the soil particles.  These 
are the ions that are measured by the MMI™ technique to find mineralization at depths.  The 
weakly attached ions are at very low concentrations.  Because the ions have recently arrived to 
the surface they provide a precise 'signal' directly above the ore bodies.  
 
When the mobile metal ions have arrived at the surface they have a limited lifetime as 'mobile' 
ions. At the surface the ions are subject to weathering and are bound up by soil forming processes 
(i.e. they become part of the soil).  The diagram below demonstrates this process. Note that bound 
ions are subject to lateral movement away from the mineralization. The mobile ions, however, do 
not move away from the source (mineralization) because they have a limited lifetime before they 
are converted to a bound form. 
 
By only measuring the mobile metal ions in the surface soils, MMI™ geochemistry will produce 
very sharp responses (anomalies) directly over the source of mobile ions, as seen in Figure 23 
below.  This source is ore-bodies at depth, which emit metal ions, which make up that ore-body.  
For example a Cu, Pb, Zn base metal deposit will emit (release) Cu, Pb and Zn ions".

11.3.2 MMI Sample Preparation and Analysis 
 
AMM submitted Mobile Metal Ion™ ("MMI") soil geochemical samples from the Property to 
SGS Canada Inc's Mineral Services laboratory ("SGS Canada") located in Toronto, Canada for 
preparation and analysis.  SGS Canada is an industry recognised and accredited lab (ISO/IEC 
17025) and accepted global provider of assaying and analytical testing services for mining and 
mineral exploration companies.  The SGS Canada Toronto facility is a full-service sample 
preparation and analytical facility that serves the North American continent.   
 
MMI sample preparation consisted of weighing and conventional drying if required as the soil 
samples were treated as pulps (no crushing, pulverizing).  The sample pulp was then sent to the 
wet chemistry laboratory for analysis.   
 
The MMI analysis procedure consists of adding a 50g aliquot of MMI extractant in this case the 
MMI-M extractant package to 50g of the sample (i.e. soil).  After 24 hours, the supernatant liquid 
is centrifuged and then analysed via Induced Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry ("ICP-MS").  
The MMI-M extractant package is a 53 element suite.  The elements analysed and their detection 
ranges are presented in Table 3 below:

12 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
12.1 AMM Quality Assurance/ Quality Control 
 
Sono has not yet conducted any geological sampling on the Property. Howe recommends that 
when Sono initiates exploration on the Property, it should implement quality assurance/quality 
control (QA-QC) procedures that include the insertion of certified reference materials (standards), 
duplicates and sample blanks. Check assays should also be submitted to a second laboratory. 
 
 
12.2 Due Diligence Sampling 
 
From September 28 to October 1, 2010, Mr. Joseph Arengi, P.Geo  completed a site visit to the 
Property on behalf of AMM in order to complete a due diligence review.  
 
A series of composite grab samples were collected by Howe from the road cut along the Steese 
Highway as well as various locations along a 4 kilometre traverse across the claims.  Sample 
details are summarized in Table 4 below and locations are shown in Figure 9:

The verification rock samples were submitted to ALS Chemex Laboratories in Fairbanks Alaska 
for a 33 element four acid digestion and inductively coupled plasma analysis (ME-ICP41).  In 
addition, gold was analyzed by fire assay with atomic absorption finish using a 50 gram sample 
(Au-AA24).

Arengi's 10 grab samples provide an independent confirmation of the presence of gold on the 
Property.  None of the samples returned gold values that would be considered economically 
significant; however, the tenor of geochemically anomalous values as well as the Au-As-Bi 
association was reproduced.   Analytical certificates are presented in Appendix A. 
 
 
12.2.1 Howe site visit and Data Verification 
 
During the site visit, Howe did not collect any duplicate soil or rock samples for check sampling 
purposes.  Howe conducted a spot check comparison of approximately 10% of AMM's 
conventional and MMI analytical data against available digital scans/PDF/Excel files of 
laboratory certificates to verify accuracy and completeness.  No errors were detected.  Howe also 
reviewed and analysed the QA-QC data provided by both ALS Chemex and SGS Canada and 
found no apparent issues with the analytical data and results. 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 

49 
 

 
13 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
Howe is aware that a majority of the claims surrounding and contiguous with the Bear Claims 
Property have been staked by Fairbanks Gold Mining Inc. which is a subsidiary of Kinross Gold.   
 
However, it is not known if any other significant exploration programs or properties in the 
immediate area of the Bear Claims Property are being carried out at this time. 
 
 
 
 



 

50 
 

 
14 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
Sono has conducted no mineral processing metallurgical testing on gold mineralization from the 
Property.  
 
 
 



 

51 
 

 
15 MINERAL RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
No NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource and reserve estimates have been completed for gold 
mineralization on the Bear Claims property. 
 
 



 

52 
 

 
16 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
There is no other relevant information on the Bear Claims property known to Howe that if 
undisclosed would make this Report misleading or would make this Report more understandable.  
 
 



 

53 
 

 
17 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Howe has visited the Property and has reviewed the Property data generated by BHP-Utah in 
1991, including the soil and rock sampling surveys and airborne geophysics databases and maps. 
The authors believe that the information and data presented to Howe by Sono are a reasonable 
and accurate representation of the Property and mineralization and are of sufficient quality to 
provide the basis for the conclusions and recommendations reached in this report. 
 
Previous work has shown that broad areas of geochemically anomalous gold occur in the Bear 
Claims. Gold occurs in association with arsenic and bismuth and appears to be structurally 
controlled. These observations are somewhat analogous to the producing Pogo mine 250 km (160 
miles) east. The presence of mineralized quartz monzonite dikes and a coincident resistivity 
anomaly is encouraging and may indicate a deeper mineralized intrusive body. Mapping, 
structural analysis and observations from placer miners in the area suggest the quartz-vein hosted 
mineralization may be focussed on the intersection of high angle faults and low angle thrust 
plates.  Check sampling by Arengi failed to reproduce values reported in previous grab sampling, 
however, geochemically anomalous values as well as an Au-As-Bi association was reproduced.  
 
The re-interpretation of the original ADGGS aeromagnetic data that overlies the Property has 
shown that the presence of several intrusive bodies associated with RIRGS deposits may be 
present on the Property of which the largest is 3km long by 1km wide.  Follow up conventional 
and MMI soil sampling has produced anomalous Au, As and Bi over the interpreted intrusive 
body.  The correlation of the soil geochemical results with the interpreted intrusive body suggests 
that gold mineralization may be present. 
 
There is no reason to consider that the previous results are misrepresented. Howe is of the opinion 
that additional MMI sampling would likely refine the outline and size of the intrusive body.  Past 
exploration results are encouraging and the Bear Claims represent a good grass-roots exploration 
target with good access.  Further work is recommended, however, each stage of exploration 
should be contingent upon favourable results from the previous stage. 
 
 



 

54 
 

 
18 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Based on the available technical data, previous exploration history and Sono's exploration work 
to date, it is Howe's opinion that the Property warrants additional work and that Howe concurs 
with the exploration work program considered by Sono.  The proposed exploration program is 
described below: 
 

1. Sono proposes to complete a ground IP survey over the interpreted intrusive body defined 
from the airborne geophysical re-interpretation study.  A total of 40 line km of IP at a line 
spacing of 100m is proposed; and, 

 
2. Sono proposes to complete detail geological mapping and the completion of additional 

MMI soil geochemical surveys over the proposed IP grid. 
 
The above IP survey and MMI soil geochemical survey will allow Sono to identify drilling 
targets for the Phase 2 work program. 
 
It is expected that the recommended Phase 1 work program would be completed by Sono within a 
four (4) month time frame.  A budget of approximately $300,000 is estimated for the Phase 1 
work program.   
 
Pending favourable results from the Phase 1 work program, Sono's proposed Phase 2 would 
consist of a detailed drilling program is estimated to cost $450,000.   
 
The estimated cost of the recommended Phase 1 and 2 work program is as follows: 
 
Phase 1 
 
IP survey (40 line km @ $4,625 per line km all inclusive)   $   185,000 
MMI soil sampling survey       $     30,000 
Geological mapping        $     15,000 
 
       Phase 1 Subtotal $    230,000 
 
Phase 2 
 
Diamond Drill Program (2,000m @ $150/m all incl.)   $   300,000 
Diamond Drill Program Assays (2000 @$30/sample)   $     60,000 
Exploration Capital Costs (lodging, vehicles etc.)    $     50,000 
Exploration Personnel and Consumables (2 months)    $     40,000 
 
       Phase 2 Subtotal  $    450,000 
 
      Phase 1 and 2 total  $    680,000
