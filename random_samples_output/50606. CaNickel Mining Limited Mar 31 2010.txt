1 Summary 
 

This report presents an updated statement of Reserves and Resource for the Bucko Lake Mine 

based on drilling results obtained from surface and underground drilling completed on the 

property in 2007 and 2008. It provides technical documentation regarding the design and 

modeling assumptions used to update Resources based on work completed in-house by 

Crowflight and independently verified by P&E and to update Reserves based on design work 

undertaken by Python Mining Consultants (PMC) of Hamilton, Ontario. As such the reserves and 

resources presented in this report are considered to be an update to NI 43-101 compliant 

resources presented in April 2007.  

1.1 Location 
The Bucko Lake property (Bucko Deposit, Bucko) is located near the town of Wabowden, 

Manitoba, approximately 105 km southwest of Thompson. Crowflight Minerals Incorporated 

(Crowflight) has the exclusive right to acquire a 100% undivided interest from Xstrata Nickel, a 

business unit of Falconbridge Limited. The Bucko property consists of one Mining Lease, ML–

031, totaling 546 hectares. Drilling on the Bucko property has delineated a mineral resource, 

containing nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum, palladium and gold. 

1.2 2004 to 2005 Review 
On June 15, 2004 Crowflight entered into an agreement with Xstrata Nickel (Xstrata - formerly 

Falconbridge Limited) to acquire and develop the Bucko Deposit and explore properties in the 

Thompson Nickel Belt. Under the terms of the agreement, Crowflight had the right to earn up to 

a 100% interest in the Bucko Lake resource block (portion of mining lease hosting the known 

deposit) by incurring expenditures of $25 million to complete a bankable feasibility study and 

secure project financing. 

1.3 2005 to 2007 Review 
From 2005 to 2007 the Company conducted a variety of work activities designed to advance the 

project towards the completion of a Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS).  In January 2006, Micon 

International Limited (Micon) completed a feasibility study and compiled an associated NI 43-

101 Technical Report entitled "Feasibility Study for the Bucko Lake Project, Wabowden, 

Manitoba" detailing the design and costing of an underground mining operation and associated 

infrastructure, including process facilities, to produce a flotation concentrate. This feasibility 

study was based on a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate filed by P & E Mining Consultants 

Inc. (P&E) issued in December 2005 which incorporated drilling completed on the property up 

until October 2005. Based on these resources and design criteria identified in the Micon report, 

life-of-mine mineral reserves using a cut-off grade of 1.5% Ni were estimated to be 1,685,000 

tonnes grading 1.92% Ni and 0.14% copper.

In December 2006, Micon was contracted to assist in revising the feasibility study to incorporate 

updates and some changes to the project with the objective of producing an updated Bankable 

Feasibility Study (Updated BFS) document. The document entitled, "Technical Report on the 

Updated Bucko Lake Nickel Project Feasibility Study, Wabowden Manitoba" was filed on Sedar 

on April 24, 2007 and included revisions including a fixed and firm mining contract, a definitive 

concentrate off-take agreement and the actual purchase of used facilities and equipment 

comprising a hoist, headframe, mill building and most of the required process equipment. 

Results from additional drilling completed in 2006 were used by Crowflight and P&E to update 

NI 43-101 compliant resources at Bucko. Based on design criteria identified in the BFS 

document, life-of-mine mineral reserves using a cut-off grade of 1.4% Ni were determined to be 

2,395,834 tonnes grading 1.84% Ni and 0.14% copper. 

1.4 2007 to 2008 Review 
On January 31, 2007, Crowflight entered into an amended Agreement with Xstrata Nickel that 

provided Crowflight the right to: (1) earn a 100% interest in mining lease ML-031 which contains 

the Bucko Lake Nickel Deposit and a 5.5 kilometer area surrounding the Bucko Deposit; and (2) 

earn a 100% interest in all of the advanced-stage exploration ground previously the subject of 

the separate Thompson Nickel Belt (TNB) South and TNB North Agreements. Under the terms of 

this amended agreement the company currently maintains approximately 580 square kilometers 

of mining property in the Thompson Nickel Belt. 

Based on an Agreement dated July 11, 2007, the Company has secured a definitive offtake 

agreement to sell 100% of its nickel concentrates from the Bucko Lake Mine at commercially 

competitive terms to Xstrata Nickel for the duration of the mine life, originally anticipated to be 

approximately seven years based on original feasibility study reserves. Under the terms of the 

agreement Xstrata expects to take delivery of between 30,000 and 40,000 dry metric tonnes 

(DMT) of nickel concentrates pre year containing an annual average of 11.1 million pounds of 

payable nickel. 

In 2008, the Company completed construction of mine and mill facilities at Bucko and 

commenced production from the 1000' mining level. Commissioning of the mill was initiated in 

November 2008 and was completed in January 2009. Since commencing operations at Bucko, 

Crowflight has achieved several milestones including: 

• Repayment of debt associated with construction and commissioning of plant and 

underground workings;  

• Production and delivery of marketable nickel concentrate; and 

• Development of the first main high-grade zones of production.  

At year end production of ore from the 1000' mining level was limited to development in ore in 

preparation for longhole sublevel stoping. As no significant amounts of material had been

removed from reserve blocks as of the effective date of this report, no attempts were made to 

reconcile reserves with amounts extracted to year end. The effective date of this reserve and 

resource update is December 31, 2008. 

 

1.5 2008 Statement of Reserves and Resources 
Activities in 2008 have resulted in a review of the project with the objective of optimizing future 

production.  Repayment of project debt, updated operating and capital costs, and additional 

drilling were considered from the standpoint of their impact on project economics.  This review 

has lead to an updated production scenario based on the permitted extraction of 1000 tonnes 

per day from a mining reserve utilizing 1.25% nickel cutoff. Table 1 presents a statement of 

updated reserves and resources.

The mineral reserve and resource estimates presented in this report have been prepared in 

accordance with the "CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves", 

adopted by the CIM Council on December 11, 2005, and the "CIM Estimation of Mineral 

Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines", adopted by CIM Council on 

November 23, 2003. The estimates use geostatistical and/or classical methods to interpret and 

interpolate, plus economic and mining parameters determined in accordance with NI43-101 

requirements. 

1.6 Conclusions and Recommendations 
The current forecast for 2009 at Bucko is to produce 9.1 million pounds of payable nickel from 

359,000 tonnes grading 1.65% nickel at a projected cash cost of US$3.61 per pound. Surface and 

underground drilling conducted in 2007 and 2008 has confirmed the continuity and distribution 

of mineralization in areas of planned production between the 1000' and 800' mining levels 

between sections 513 and 521 north. In addition drilling has provided additional information 

regarding the extent and continuity of mineralization in the hinge zone and at depth on the west 

limb resulting in an expansion of Inferred and Indicated Resources. 

Areas currently identified having opportunity for reserves and resources increases at Bucko 

include: 

The Hinge Zone is a folded extension of the main zone trending in a west to easterly strike 

orientation known to host shoots of high-grade nickel sulphide mineralization. Historically, 

interpretation of this area had been constrained due to the lack of suitable underground drilling 

locations. Recent infill drilling indicates that mineralization in this portion of the deposit is more 

consistent than previously interpreted. New access afforded by development planned for 

completion in 2009 will provide access to properly evaluate the potential of this area. 

The West Limb is the main zone hosting the bulk of current reserves and remains open at depth 

and to the south. Drilling targeting elevated grade x thickness trends in the upper portions of 

the mine has to date been successful in the conversion of resources to reserves. Additional 

drilling along defined trends of elevated nickel grade x thickness in this area retains high 

potential for the additional conversion of reserves and expansion of resources. 

In the Footwall Zone, a new nickel mineralized horizon was intersected during the course of 

infill drilling and driving footwall development on 1,000 foot level in 2008. It has been 

interpreted that this horizon ties in with mineralization intersected by historical exploration drill 

holes intersecting a broad interval of mineralized ultramafic near the southern limit of drilling on 

the 1,400 foot level. This area has now been intersected by underground development on 1,000 

foot and 900 foot levels and by a total of six underground holes outlining an Inferred Resource 

of approximately 1.2 million tonnes grading 1.31% nickel. Encouraging drilling results such as 

those returned from hole M77-14 which intersected 6.09 metres grading 1.65% nickel define the 

current limit of known mineralization associated with this promising exploration area.

1.7 Plans for 2009: 
Additional infill drilling from the 1000' level exploration drift is ongoing with the goal of 

completing the delineation of reserves associated with the west limb of the deposit between 

the 1000' and 800' levels. Drilling from the ramp on the 450' level is planned to obtain 

geotechnical data sufficient to complete the crown pillar design and delineate reserves between 

the 450' and 600' mining levels. Access provided by new mine development will be utilized to 

test portions of the hinge zone and footwall zone, previously not testable from the 

underground. A total of 20,000 metres of underground drilling is planned at Bucko in 2009.

4 Property Description and Location 
On January 31, 2007, Crowflight entered into an Agreement with Xstrata Nickel (Xstrata) that 

provided Crowflight the right to: (1) earn a 100% interest in mining lease ML-031 which contains 

the Bucko Lake Nickel Deposit and a 5.5 kilometer area surrounding the Bucko Deposit; and (2) 

earn a 100% interest in all of the advanced-stage exploration ground previously the subject of the 

separate Thompson Nickel Belt (TNB) South and TNB North Agreements.  As of the effective date 

of this report, property maintained by Crowflight and covered by this Agreement totaled 

approximately 580 square kilometers.

4.1 Location 
The Bucko Mine Property is located approximately 4.5 km southwest of the town of Wabowden, 

Manitoba, 105 km south of Thompson or 640 km north of Winnipeg off highway 6.  Figure 1 

depicts the location of the property and the interpreted outline of theThompson Nickel Belt. 

4.2 Tenure 
The Bucko property consists of a single mineral lease (ML 31) covering 556 Ha.  The approximate 

central UTM NAD83 (Zone 14) coordinate for the property is: 522,200E; 6,081,600N.  All known 

mineralized zones, mineral resources, mineral reserves, mine workings and current and 

proposed tailings and waste rock deposition areas are located within the boundary of this lease. 

In Manitoba, a ML-031 has a term of 21 years and requires that the party holding such lease 

make annual payments of CAD$8.00 per hectare if in production, or if not in production, at the 

annual rate of CAD$12.00 per hectare. Mining leases which terminate after the initial 21 year 

period can be renewed for an additional 21 year period on into perpetuity through the payment 

of the annual CAD$8.00 or CAD$12.00 per hectare fee. One of the conditions required of 

recording a mining lease is that the boundary of the area under application be surveyed by a 

Manitoba Land Surveyor. Mining  Lease ML-031 was recorded in 1992 and is up for renewal in 

April of 2013. Crowflight also maintains surface rights for Mining Lease 31, under a separate 

lease agreement with the province of Manitoba ensuring no restriction to access or 

development on the property. 

4.3 Xstrata Lease Transfer Agreement 
Under the terms of the jointly signed Bucko Lake Deposit Lease Transfer Agreement (LTA), in 

July 2007, Crowflight earned a 100% interest in the Bucko Lake Nickel Deposit Mining Lease ML-

031 having honoured its expenditure commitments and having completed a Bankable Feasibility 

Study.  On the exercise of its rights to acquire its interest in the property, Crowflight issued 

2,000,000 shares to Xstrata. The issuance of these shares was a condition dating back to the 

original and amended versions of the Agreement governing the Bucko Deposit and Mining 

Lease.  

Crowflight's 100% interest in ML-031 is subject to a Back-in Right whereby should Crowflight 

outline a Threshold Deposit - a new Deposit (outside of the currently known Bucko Resources) 

exceeding 200,000,000 pounds of nickel in Measured and Indicated Resources - Xstrata would 

have the right to Back-in for a 50% interest and to become the operator of the new Threshold 

Deposit by paying to Crowflight an amount equal to the aggregate of all direct expenditures 

which were incurred by Crowflight in carrying out Mining Operations on the Bucko Lake Lease 

outside of the Bucko Resource Block prior to the date of exercise of the Back-in Right.  

Under the terms of the LTA, production from the property is subject to a 2.5% Net Smelter 

Return royalty payable to Xstrata net of all charges and penalties for smelting and refining, 

insurance premiums, and sampling and assay charges incurred after the minerals, metals or

metal concentrates have left site. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  excluded from any Net 

Smelter Return payments, are any proceeds which relate to mineral products sold in any month 

in which the average official daily London Metal Exchange Nickel Grade "A" cash quotation is 

less than U.S. $6.00 per pound.

4.4 Liabilities 
The authors of this report are not aware of any significant liabilities associated with the current 

and proposed activities at site. Baseline environmental studies and an evaluation of the acid 

generating capacity of the tails has been completed by Wardrop Environmental (Wardrop) and 

effective control measures have been proposed and put in place.  

4.5 Permitting 
Currently the company has all permits in place to conduct operations on the property. Tailings 

from milling operations are currently being stored in a land based Interim Tailings Storage 

Facility (ITSF) permitted by the Province of Manitoba for the period of 1 year following the onset 

of production discharge.  

The Company has applied for permission to deposit tailings in the shallow water filled basin 

occupied by Bucko Lake. This application falls under chapter 12 of the Federal Mining Metals 

and Effluent Act and is considered to bethe engineering best practice for longer term tailings 

storage. The proposal minimized the impact on the environment, and limits the potential for 

future acid drainage. 

  

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and 

Physiography 

5.1 Accessibility Local Resources and Infrastructure: 

The Bucko Deposit is located near the town of Wabowden, Manitoba, 105 km southwest of 

Thompson, Manitoba.  Wabowden is a small town of about 550 people with electrical and 

telephone service, a post office and a single gas station. The Town of Wabowden is serviced by a 

5 km long all-weather road from Provincial Highway 6, one of two main, north-south highways in 

the province. The Bucko site is accessed by an all weather gravel road built in 1970 and recently 

upgraded by Crowflight. .  The Falconbridge Manibridge Mine property (operated in the 1970's 

and since inactive) is situated about 30 km southwest of Bucko Lake by existing roads.

Figure 3. Bucko Site Plan 

 

 

The property is in close proximity to electrical and telephone services and the Hudson Bay 

Railway (a subsidiary of Omnitrax - formerly CNR) passes within 1.5 km to the west of the Bucko 

Deposit shaftThe Bucko deposit is situated under Bucko Lake, a small body of shallow water that 

does not exceed 2.0 m depth at its deepest point, 5 km south of Wabowden.  The lake is not 

surrounded by any cottages and is understood to be an area of little interest to the local 

inhabitants. Figure 3 depicts a site plan of operations showing the relative position of surface 

and underground installations. 

 

5.2 Climate and Physiography: 
The climate is typical of northern areas within the Canadian Shield with long winters and short 

but warm to hot summers.  Average temperatures range from a low average of -25 ºC in January 

to a high average of +17 ºC in July.  The average number of frost free days is 104. The annual 

precipitation averages 315 cm of rain and 147.5 cm of snow.  The average low, high and mean

mineralization was discovered in a 1964 drill program (3,720 m) that tested high priority 

geophysical targets. By 1970, some 53-drill holes totaling about 21,050 m had been drilled. At 

that time, a decision was made to go underground and conduct an exploration program.

consisting of 12,739 m of coring in 61 holes was completed. The shaft was sunk in the footwall 

gneisses although the exploration drifting crossed through the mineralization-hosting ultramafic 

unit into the hangingwall gneisses where the bulk of the development occurred.  The 

mineralized zone was intersected by the drift at the extreme south end of the zone but no 

substantial development was completed within the body.  In 1974 the shaft was capped, 

allowed to flood and the site demobilized. By late 1974 the property had become dormant.  

Additional geophysical work was completed in 1990 and 6,880 m of additional drilling was 

completed in 9 holes and three wedges (Falconbridge 1994). The reported drilling in and around 

the Bucko Lake deposit, between 1972 and 1994, by Falconbridge and CMML consisted of some 

130 surface drill holes totaling 43,091 m. 

In 2000, Nuinsco Resources Ltd. conducted a 4,628 m due-diligence drill program in 13-holes to 

confirm some of the Falconbridge results and to test the continuity and projection of certain 

zones of nickel mineralization. Nuinsco carried out an additional 2,500 m of diamond drilling in 

the first quarter of 2001. 

 

6.1 History of Crowflight at Bucko 
Crowflight has conducted drill programs on the property since it became involved with the 

project in 2004, initially in 2005 with technical assistance from operating partner Falconbridge. 

From 2004 to 2007, drilling on the property was restricted to surface diamond drilling. During 

this period, 77 holes totaling 32,246 meters were drilled to in-fill areas of known mineralization, 

expand resources and reserves, and to obtain bulk sample material for metallurgical testing. In 

2008, Crowflight gained access to historical underground workings on the 1000' mining level and 

conducted a program of underground infill drilling with the objective of delineating reserves in 

areas of planned initial production while obtaining additional geotechnical information 

concerning ground conditions. Crowflight achieved first production from Bucko in September of 

2008 and is ramping up towards full production in 2009. 

 

6.2 Historical Mineral Reserve and Resource Estimates: 
Since discovery of mineralization at Bucko Lake, numerous historical resource/reserve 

studies have been conducted. Prior to 2001, most were completed as part of in-house 

studies undertaken by Falconbridge looking at options to exploit the deposit at various 

cut-offs and mining scenarios. These historical estimates are presented below in Table 3.

Estimates: 

National Instrument 43-101 compliant statements of reserves and resources accompanied by 

reports have been completed on the deposit in 2001 by Roscoe Postle and Associates (RPA) for 

Nuinsco Resources, in 2005 and 2006 by P&E Mining Consultants Inc. (P&E) for Crowflight 

Minerals. These estimates have in turn been updated by Crowflight and independently verified 

by P&E in 2007 and 2008. These updates are presented and discussed further in section 17 of 

this report.

7 Geological Setting 
 

The description of the geology used in this report was is based on the description included in the 

Updated BFS study filed on Sedar on April 24, 2007. Since the release of this report, ongoing 

drilling on the Bucko Lake Property has resulted in an updated resource estimate which has 

been prepared by Crowflight and independently verified by P & E for presentation in this report. 

7.1 Regional Geology 
The Thompson Nickel Belt is a 10 km to 35 km wide belt of variably reworked Archean basement 

gneisses and early Proterozoic cover rocks between the Superior and Churchill Provinces in 

northern Manitoba. Strong gravity and magnetic expressions allow delineation of the belt and 

permit its extension beneath platformal cover. It is comprised of gneisses, metasedimentary, 

metavolcanic and ultramafic rocks and felsic plutons. Most of the metasedimentary, 

metavolcanic and ultramafic rocks are on the western side of the belt, which also contains the 

known nickel deposits. The intermediate to felsic gneisses are stratiform in character and have a 

complex tectonic and metamorphic history. They show an earlier Archean granulite facies and a 

pervasive retrograde Proterozoic amphibolite facies metamorphism. A minimum of two 

structural events has been recognized. Earlier folding produced tight, sub-horizontally plunging 

synclinal structures. Later cross folding produced sub-vertically plunging folds. 

The nickel sulphide deposits are genetically and spatially related to the serpentinite sills of the 

ultramafic group of rocks. Their present distribution however, is the result of re-mobilization 

during the long and complex tectonic history of the Thompson Belt. Sulphides occur as 

interstitial grains in the serpentinite, as massive and inclusion bearing sulphides on the contact 

between the serpentinite and the country rocks and as stringers or veins in the serpentinite and 

country rocks. 

7.1.1 Metasediments 

 The metasedimentary-metavolcanic assemblages are long, thin, complexly deformed bands. 

Some are younger and others coeval with the gneisses. Metasedimentary sequences include 

siliceous, calcareous, pelitic and ferruginous rocks of high metamorphic grade and complex 

metamorphic histories.  

7.1.2 Metavolcanics 

The metavolcanic pile consists of pillowed and massive meta-basalt flows. They are 

recrystallized to amphibolites and no primary textures are evident. Associated are magnesian 

meta-basalt and minor ultramafic flows. Field relationships suggest that the metavolcanic rocks 

are coeval with the metasedimentary rocks.

17

7.1.3 Ultramafics 

The ultramafic rocks have been divided into serpentinite and ultramafic amphibolite units, both 

of which occur as sheet-like or lenticular concordant bodies in the gneisses. They range from 

dunite to peridotite to pyroxenite in composition. The general character of the ultramafic rocks 

suggests that they were originally intruded as sills and are early "Hudsonian" or "pre Hudsonian" 

in age.  

7.2 Historical Production: 
A review of available historical production records by Crowflight and Falconbridge (now Xstrata 

Nickel) personnel indicates that approximately 28 billion pounds of nickel has been produced 

from various mining operations, including the Manibridge, Thompson, Pipe and Birchtree mines 

in the Thompson Nickel Belt.  Currently producing mines include the Thompson and Birchtree 

Mines. Past Producers include the Pipe, Soab and Manibridge deposits. Individual mine tonnage 

and grade data are difficult to obtain. Eckstrand (1996) estimated a reserve for the entire belt of 

89 million tonnes at 2.5% Ni and 0.13% Cu for a total of 4.9 billion pounds of contained nickel 

plus 255 million pounds of contained copper. Most of this reserve is understood to be contained 

within the Thompson Mine. Major nickel sulphide deposits of the Thompson Nickel Belt are 

shown in Figure 4. 

7.3 Local Geology 
The Bucko Lake property is underlain by Archean gneisses and Proterozoic ultramafic intrusive 

rocks. The Archean magmatite gneisses have been subdivided into granite gneiss, amphibole 

gneiss and amphibolite. Granitic gneisses are primarily quartz and potassium feldspar with less 

than 25% mafic minerals. Amphibole gneisses are 25% to 50% amphibole with the remainder 

quartz and feldspar. Amphibolites contain more than 60% amphibole. 

The Archean gneisses were intruded by Aphebian ultramafic sills including the Bucko Lake 

ultramafic which hosts the nickel mineralization on the property. The Bucko Lake ultramafic sill 

is on the northeast flank of the Resting Lake intrusion. The footwall contact of the deposit comes 

in close contact to granodiorite gneiss associated with this intrusion. The Bucko Lake ultramafic 

sill is primarily composed of metamorphosed peridotite and dunite with lesser amounts of 

olivine orthopyroxenite, poikilitic harzburgite, orthopyroxenite and amphibole bearing 

peridotite.  It is a hook shaped body dipping steeply (75˚ to 80˚) to the east. It is approximately 

20m wide at the south end, gradually increasing to over 150 m wide at the north end where it is 

wraps around the nose of a synformal fold structure plunging steeply to the south. The Bucko 

Lake Sill has been traced near surface over a north-south strike length of approximately 800m.

Contacts of the ultramafic rocks with the surrounding country rocks are usually obscured by 

alteration, shearing or late stage pegmatite dikes. Blocks of amphibolite rich gneiss called 

plagioclase amphibole, ranging from a few metres to over 30 metres in width, occur in the 

northern part of the ultramafic sill. The larger xenoliths occur within a distinct bulge or keel in 

the footwall of the ultramafics adjacent to the Hinge Zone. These blocks appear to be xenoliths 

of country rock incorporated into the sill during its emplacement. 

The sill has undergone two stages of metasomatic alteration. First was the serpentinization of 

the olivine with concurrent alteration of the orthopyroxene to anthophyllite, tremolite and 

phlogopite. The second stage of alteration, which is superimposed on the serpentinized 

ultramafics, occurs as envelopes around pegmatite dikes and fractures. The envelopes range 

from centimeters to meters in width and consist of an outer zone of talc and tremolite, a central 

zone of fibrous tremolite and an inner zone of phlogopite and minor anthophyllite. Similar 

alteration zones were studied in detail by Coats (1966) at the M11A ultramafic sill, located 

approximately 3 km northeast of Bucko Lake and were also noted by Coats et al (1976) at the 

Manibridge Mine, 24 km southwest of Bucko Lake.  The local geology of the Bucko Deposit is 

depicted on the previous page in (Figure 5).  

8 Deposit Type and Model 
Manitoba's nickel deposits are concentrated in the Thompson Nickel Belt, although there has 

been significant production from deposits outside the belt such as those associated with gabbro 

intrusions at Lynn Lake. The Nickel Belt forms part of the "Churchill-Superior Boundary Zone", a 

pronounced linear break separating the Archean Superior and Proterozoic Churchill Provinces. 

This zone has a distinctive gravity and magnetic signature. 

Rock units within the Nickel Belt are subdivided into an eastern migmatitic gneiss unit and a 

narrower zone of metasediments and metavolcanics along the Belt's western margin. A major 

fault zone, referred to as the Setting Lake Lineament, forms the western boundary of the Nickel 

Belt. The Nickel Belt rocks are highly deformed, with up to three phases of folding. Nickel 

deposits in the Belt fall into three major categories: 

1. Thompson-style mineralization consisting of a laterally extensive, strongly deformed 

massive sulphide horizon within a characteristic metasedimentary sequence (Thompson 

Band Sediments). This is an important deposit style in the Nickel Belt. The high-grade 

(2.75% Ni), very large tonnage Thompson deposits provide the bulk of Inco's Manitoba 

production. 

2. Birchtree-style mineralization consisting of brecciated semi-massive to massive 

structurally remobilized nickel sulphide mineralization associated with brecciated 

terminations to mineralized ultramafic intrusions.  



65 Queen Street West, Suite 815

3. Disseminated to semi-massive sulphides in serpentinized peridotite. These tend to be 

large tonnage, low-grade deposits but may contain higher grade cores within a low 

tonnage host. Host serpentinite may occur within 

gneiss units (e.g. Bucko).

 

Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between the categories

Bucko consists of disseminated to net textured nickel sulphides ranging in concentration from 1

50% by volume which are locally re

along contacts with pegmatite and gneiss.  In some respects the deposit is typical of komatiitic 

dunite-associated deposits described by Lesher and Groves (1984). 

Sulphide mineralogy consists of, in order of relative abundance, pentlandite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, 

chalcopyrite with minor mackinawite, violarite and cubanite (Goode 1985). The abundance of 

copper and associated platinum, palladium and gold elements is relatively low in contrast to 

komatiite hosted nickel sulphide deposits located elsewhere in the world. It has been postulated 

that Cu and PGE's were lost during intense metasomatic alteration next to Granitic dykes.

9 Mineralization 
Three principal areas of nickel mineralization are currently recognized within the Bucko Deposit, 

as shown in (Figure 7). 

In the (West Limb) or western limb of the structure, the Lower, Middle and Upper Zones follow 

interpreted continuity in elevated mineralization between drill intercepts through corresponding 

portions of the intrusion. Two corridors of elevated nickel grade x thickness within this area are 

referred to as the North and South Trends. 

 The (Hinge Zone) occupies the "hinge" area between the western and eastern fold limbs and 

represents the northernmost portion of the deposit and consists of three zones of 

mineralization interpreted to be folded extensions to the Lower, Middle and Upper Zone 

observed on the West Limb. 

Occurring in a footwall position to the West Limb, a new nickel mineralized horizon was 

intersected during the course of infill drilling and driving footwall development on 1,000 foot 

level in 2008. This zone, referred to as the (Footwall Zone) is interpreted to ties in with 

mineralization intersected by historical exploration drill holes near the southern limit of drilling 

on the 1,400 foot level.

9.1 Description of Resource Domains 
Interpreted domains are typically parallel to the contacts of the ultramafic body although in 

some instances they can run slightly sub-parallel to the primary lithological contacts. They 

appear to be controlled by some structural feature close to, but not completely parallel to the 

lithological contact, perhaps an axial plane foliation. Each domain typically contains lenses of 

much higher grade material.  The high-grade lenses appear to follow the steep southerly plunge 

of the fold structure. 

When the deposit mineralization is constrained at a very low cut-off, the mineralization tends to 

converge into one large domain.  As the cut-off grade is increased, there is a segregation of the 

mineralization into three distinct separate domains. All domains exhibit similar grade 

distribution and mineralogy. The mineralized domains were interpreted without respect for 

mining requirements.  

The Lower Domain occurs near the western or footwall contact of the ultramafic sill and wraps 

around a south plunging synform extending into the Hinge Zone located on the north limb of the 

fold. Vertically this mineralization has been traced from 2,900 m to the 2,200 m elevation, 

where it appears to remain open for further expansion at depth. Within the Lower Domain, 

three steep south plunging trends of higher grade mineralization are observed. These trends 

appear to be roughly parallel to the plunge of the main, deposit scale fold structure. Two trends 

of higher grade mineralization are observed in the western limb of the intrusion. These have 

been termed respectively the North, and South Trends. A third trend of higher grade 

mineralization located in the keel or nose of the main intrusion scale fold structure is also noted. 

This mineralization is spatially associated with plagioclase amphibolite xenoliths 

The Middle Domain is located within the central portion of the ultramafic sill between the 

Upper and Lower Domains and runs roughly parallel to them. It can be traced from the 2,800 m 

elevation to the 2,200 m elevation where it also remains open for further expansion at depth. As 

in the Lower Domain, three steep south plunging trends of higher grade mineralization are 

observed. Unlike the Lower Domain however, the North trend on the west limb exhibits a lesser 

degree of overall continuity. 

The Upper Domain is located close to the eastern or hangingwall contact of the ultramafic sill. It 

can be traced from the 2,800 m elevation to the 2,200 m elevation where it remains open for 

further expansion at depth. Continuity of the Upper Domain diminishes towards the southern 

portion of the west limb.  The thickness of the Upper Domain is highly variable, but in general 

increases in thickness on the north limb side of the Hinge Zone fold. Continuity in higher grade 

higher grade mineralization observed occurs in the keel portion of the hinge zone.

10 Exploration 
Since acquiring the property in 2004, Crowflight has funded several programs of advanced 

exploration and diamond drilling on the Property. The first program was conducted from 

October, 2004 to April 30, 2005 with field work overseen by operator Falconbridge Ltd. on 

behalf of Crowflight. Since May of 2005, Crowflight has conducted programs of infill and 

exploration drilling at the deposit with the goal of further defining and expanding the resources 

of the deposit. Work completed to date includes the drilling of 157 surface and underground 

diamond drill holes and analysis of drill core totaling 45,929 metres, line-cutting, surface and 

borehole electromagnetic surveying (on selected holes), surface and airborne magnetic surveys, 

borehole directional surveys, petrographic studies and a bathymetric survey of the lake bottom.  

10.1 2004 to 2005 Activities 
In 2004/2005, 30 holes for a total of 14,056 metres were completed. The results of this program 

were used by P&E Mining Consultants of Brampton, Ontario (P&E) to produce a NI 43-101 

compliant report regarding an updated resource estimate for the deposit. The report entitled 

"Updated Resource Estimate on the Bucko Lake Property, The Pas Mining District, Manitoba, 

Canada" was completed in December of 2005 and filed on SEDAR on February 2, 2006. The 

mineable portion of the Indicated Resource at the 1.5% nickel cutoff from the January 2006 P&E 

report was used to determine an updated Measured Reserve for the deposit. This reserve was 

incorporated into a technical report prepared by Micon, entitled "Feasibility Study for the Bucko 

Lake Nickel Deposit, Wabowden Manitoba", released in January 2006.  The P&E report 

highlighted several areas at Bucko where additional drilling could result in further resource 

expansion. In response to these recommendations, Crowflight undertook a program of drilling in 

2006 with the goal of further enhancing the economics of project.

10.2 2006 to 2007 Activities 
In 2006, a total of 13,549 metres in 29 holes were completed. Drilling completed up until the 

end of October 2006 was used to update resources estimates at Bucko. This update completed 

by P&E was released on December 7, 2006 and detailed in a technical report (Updated BFS) filed 

on SEDAR on April 24, 2007. Stope design and mine sequence sequencing based on the updated 

resource was modeled in February 2007 by AST. 

During the period between November 2006 and April 2007, 4 additional surface exploration 

holes were completed at Bucko targeting extensions to mineralization associated with the West 

Limb at depth, and areas of opportunity in the Hinge Zone.  Results from these holes were not 

available for inclusion in the November 2006 update, but have been included in the current 

update. 

10.3 2008 Activities 
In 2008, drilling at Bucko focused on the completion of the first phase of definition drilling from 

the 1,000' mining level. As of the effective date of this report, 80 holes for a total of 13,659 

metres of underground drilling had been completed. Results from this program were used to 

update the mineral inventory at Bucko presented in this report.

10.4 Exploration Plans: 
Underground exploration and infill drilling remains focused on upgrading and increasing 

reserves and resources. Currently, a second phase of underground definition and exploration 

drilling is in progress.  

Areas of identified exploration opportunity at Bucko include: 

The Hinge Zone is a folded extension of the main zone trending in a west to easterly strike 

orientation known to host shoots of high-grade nickel sulphide mineralization. Historically, 

interpretation of this area had been constrained due to the lack of suitable underground drilling 

locations. Recent infill drilling indicates that mineralization in this portion of the deposit is more 

consistent than previously interpreted. New access afforded by development planned for 

completion in 2009 will provide access to properly evaluate the potential of this area. 

The West Limb is the main zone hosting the bulk of current reserves and remains open at depth 

and to the south. Drilling targeting high-grade thickness trends in the upper portions of the mine 

has to date been successful in the conversion of resources to reserves. Additional drilling along 

defined trends of elevated nickel grade and thickness in this area retains high potential for the 

additional conversion of reserves and expansion of resources. 

In the Footwall Zone, a new nickel mineralized horizon was intersected during the course of 

infill drilling and driving footwall development on 1,000 foot level in 2008. It has been 

interpreted that this horizon ties in with mineralization intersected by historical exploration drill 

holes intersecting a broad interval of mineralized ultramafic near the southern limit of drilling on 

the 1,400 foot level. This area has now been intersected by underground development on 1,000 

foot and 900 foot levels and by a total of six underground holes outlining an Inferred Resource 

of approximately 1.2 million tonnes grading 1.31% nickel. Encouraging drilling results such as 

those returned from hole M77-14 which intersected 6.09 metres grading 1.65% nickel define the 

current limit of known mineralization associated with this promising exploration area.

11 Drilling 
Crowflight has been drilling at the Bucko Deposit since December, 2004 and as of the effective 

date of this report had completed 157 holes totaling 45,905 meters. During this period 

approximately 12,040 assays were taken. All diamond drill programs have been designed, 

managed, logged, sampled and interpreted by employees or consultants of Crowflight.  

Drilling to date has resulted in an overall increase in tonnes and grade in the Measured, 

Indicated and Inferred Resource categories. Design work completed using the Measured and 

Indicated portions of this resource has resulted in an increase in the Proven and Probable 

Reserve categories.  

Drilling was completed from both surface and underground collar locations. Holes drilled from 

surface typically collected NQ diameter core. Core collected from underground drilling collected 

BQTK diameter core. The majority of surface drill holes completed by Crowflight have been 

surveyed by DGPS to determine their collar positions recorded as UTM coordinates using a NAD 

83 Zone 14 projection system. These coordinates are then converted to a local mine coordinate 

system based on an orthographic projection system with an assigned shaft elevation of 3048 

metres, and easting and northing translated without rotation by deducting 520,000 metres from 

the UTM Easting, and subtracting 6,000,000 from the UTM northing. The local grid system is 

used for surface and underground engineering design and resource modeling. Underground drill 

hole collares are spotted and aligned prior to completion using standard underground survey 

methods and picked up once again following completion of drilling at each set-up. Table 4 

provides a listing of holes completed by Crowflight to date. 

Downhole surveys are completed in all holes at 30 metre intervals using an electronic single shot 

survey instrument such as (Reflex EZ-Shot ® or Flex-it®) which accurately measures azimuth, 

inclination, magnetic tool face angle, gravity roll angle, magnetic field strength and temperature. 

Azimuth measurements from the tool are based on measurements of magnetic field strength. 

Due to the presence of magnetic minerals in the ore zones at Bucko, careful review of all 

magnetic field strength data is undertaken to ensure inaccurate azimuth readings are culled 

from the drill database. During the period between 2004 and 2006, a number of drill holes were 

re-surveyed using a Reflex Maxibor instrument.  

All core was logged on site either at the Core facility located at the Bucko Mine site or 

exploration core shack located in Wabowden and is stored on a secured compound in 

Wabowden.  Drilling core recovery averages 99.5%. Core is logged directly into a secure SQL 

server based drill database using software developed for use in conjunction with AMINE® the 

company's current standard engineering design software platform. The Amine logger software 

ensures the use of standard codes rock types, minerals, alteration and structure.  

Geotechnical logging to determine core recovery, RQD and other geotechnical parameters is 

completed on site by a geotechnician following procedures outlined by Golder Associates Ltd

(Golders) for the purposes of determining rock mass rating (RMR) for encountered rock types at 

Bucko. All logging information is uploaded to a central drill database located at site where it can 

be accessed and utilized for geological interpretation and engineering design use. 

Once core has been logged and proper tags and marks on the core are put in place in 

preparation for sampling, all core is photographed first wet then dry. The photographs are 

stored on Crowflight's central server located at on site. Access to the central server and the drill 

database is limited to authorized geology personnel only. 

The historical Falconbridge drill database was audited by independent consultants, P&E in 2005 

and determined to be accurate with respect to position, geology and assay information. 

Information from the historical Falconbridge database reconciles well with information from 

recent drilling programs and underground mapping, including several breakthrough holes 

identified in 2008 on the 1000' mining level.    

Drilling, core sampling, analysis, and quality control procedures have been adopted from 

standard procedures developed by Falconbridge entitled "Thompson Nickel Belt South – 

Diamond Drill Standard Procedures, an adaptation of the El Morrow Protocol Generic Drill Site 

Standard Operating Procedures and the Raglan Diamond Drill Standard Procedures Manual". 

This document is available and understood by all Crowflight Staff.  

Drill sites were inspected upon completion by Crowflight personnel, and cleaned if necessary. 

Manitoba Conservation officers were notified upon the completion of drilling for post drilling 

site inspection for all surface holes. All casings of completed holes were left in the hole and 

capped. Site locations were marked with a stake and aluminum tags affixed indicating hole 

number, depth, azimuth, and dip. Underground holes were plugged and marked with metal tags 

containing hole name information.

resolution of individual vein orientations is considered normal and considered to be of little 

impact to resource estimation at Bucko.

12 Sampling 
The core sampling method applied by Crowflight from 2004 to 2008 follows procedure as set 

forth in Falconbridge's Thompson Nickel Belt South Diamond Drill Standard Procedures, an 

adaptation of the El Morro Protocol, the Noranda Generic Drill Site Standard Operating 

Procedures and the Raglan Diamond Drill Standard Procedures Manual. Under this protocol core 

is sampled over a maximum sample length of 1.5 metres / 0.3 meter minimum. Sampled 

intervals do not overlap geological contacts or changes in concentration of mineralization. On 

average, core recovery is 95% in mineralized zones. Zones of poor core recovery tend to occur in 

areas overprinted by structure and alteration. These zones also are known to contain some 

sulphide veining. It is possible that sulphide content may in some cases be underestimated due 

to core recovery issues in these instances. The impact of this is not considered by the authors to 

be material. 

13 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
Core samples are prepared on site by employees of Crowflight at our secure core facilities in 

Wabowden. Sample material is obtained from diamond drill coring which includes NQ sized core 

for most surface drill holes and BQTK sized core from underground drilling. NQ core from 

surface drilling is sawn in half by diamond saws as is select BQTK core that is kept from 

underground drilling. The majority of samples taken from BQTK core from underground infill 

drilling is whole sampled after it has been photographed in the manner described in the 

previous section. Samples are packaged with tags inserted and shipped in shrink wrap bound 

pallets consisting of rice sacks containing individual samples for preparation at independent 

accredited commercial laboratories. 

13.1 Primary Laboratory 
All core samples obtained in 2008 were sent to ALS Chemex in Thunder Bay for preparation and 

were subsequently analyzed by ALS Chemex in Vancouver.  ALS Chemex is a reputable 

international laboratory who has provided analytical services to the mining and mineral 

exploration industry in more than 15 countries.  All ALS Chemex laboratories in Canada are 

registered under ISO 9001:2000 quality standard.   

13.2 Analytical Procedures 
Upon arrival at the ALS Chemex preparation facility in Thunder Bay, Ontario, samples are 

received, verified against the submittal forms and weighed. Samples are entered into, and 

progress is monitored by the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). The entire 

sample is crushed in a jaw crusher to 75% passing -10 mesh (2 mm). Sieve tests are completed 

periodically to monitor grain size variation. Samples are split in a riffle splitter to achieve a 200 

to 225 g split. The sample splits are pulverized using a ring mill for approximately two minutes to 

achieve 85% passing -200 mesh. The pulp is sealed in paper envelopes with the affixed digital 

label and shipped via courier to the ALS Chemex analytical laboratory in Vancouver. A

confirmation of shipping, including submittal form number, number of samples, and waybill 

number is e-mailed from the sample preparation laboratory to the Crowflight QAQC geologist. 

Upon arrival at the ALS analytical facility in Vancouver, the pulps are once again verified against 

the submittal form, and logged as 'received' into the SGS LIMS. Samples are then posted to the 

laboratory's secure website where their progress may be monitored by selected Crowflight staff 

with secure access permission. For Ni, Cu, Co, Pb, Zn, Fe and S, 0.2 g of the pulp is fused with 2.6 

g of sodium peroxide at 650°C. The resulting melt is cooled and dissolved in dilute nitric acid. 

The solution is analyzed by ICP-AES and the results corrected for spectral interference. 

Calibration solutions for the ICP-AES must be prepared in a similar fashion to achieve matrix 

matching. Detection limits are 0.01% for both Ni and Cu, and 0.001% for Co.  

13.3 QAQC 

ALS manages its internal QAQC as per operational procedures that ensure proper tracking of 

samples during sample preparation is followed and proper calibration of its analytical 

equipment is achieved. Results from each batch of samples prepared by ALS are presented in a 

certificate of analysis that is accompanied by a QAQC statement. This is provided to ensure that 

the lab's internal QACQ procedures are transparent and effective. 

With regards to Crowflight's standard internal QAQC measures, one control standard was 

inserted every 25 samples and one blank were inserted per 40 samples. During the 2004-2008 

drill programs, a total of 12,724 samples were collected including core samples, standards and 

core blanks. During the 2008 drill program 6,266 assay samples were collected. A total of 77 

blanks 53 duplicated and 243 reference matched standards were used. 

Results were periodically reviewed and appropriate action taken when problems were detected 

as outlined in the Noranda QA/QC protocol.  Upon final review of 2008 data, a total of 26 

sample QAQC issues were identified and corrected; 22 related to data entry errors and 4 related 

to lab error. A summary failures and corrective measured taken during the 2008 program is 

summarized in Table 7. Figure 15, Figure 16, Figure 17, Figure 18 and Figure 19 present QAQC 

data collected for all blanks and standards collected during 2008. Outliers from the accepted 

range are included in the Table of Failures presented below.

14 Data Verification 
Quality control measures and data verification procedures in place conform to industry best 

practices. Crowflight's qualified person, Greg Collins has verified the data used in this update 

and considers it to be of sufficient quality to be relied upon for the purposed of this report. 

The Bucko Lake property was visited by Mr. Eugene Puritch, P.Eng., on February 07, 2005, in 

order to conduct data verification sampling on the existing drill core and become familiar with 

the physical attributes of the site.  There were eight assay samples collected from drill core. An 

attempt was made to sample intervals from a variety of low and high-grade material. The 

chosen sample intervals were then sampled by collecting the quarter core remaining core 

portion after sawing the normally remaining half core. The samples were then documented, 

bagged, and sealed with fiber tape and were hand delivered to ALS Chemex, in Mississauga, 

Ontario.

At no time, prior to the time of sampling, were any employees or other associates of Crowflight 

advised as to the location or identification of any of the samples to be collected by Mr. Puritch. 

All samples remained with Mr. Puritch until submission to the Chemex Laboratory. The assay 

results are shown in Table and compared to original results. There is excellent agreement 

between the two sets of assay data for %Ni. 

 

15 Adjacent Properties: 
Since 2004, Crowflight has been actively exploring property peripheral to the Bucko Lake 

Deposit. From 2004 to the end of 2008 the company had completed 89 holes totaling 31,052 

metres, and undertaken geophysical survey work including borehole EM, surface and airborne 

time domain EM surveys, surface and airborne magnetic surveys that have lead to the successful 

discovery and definition of inferred resources at a number of satellite deposits located near 

current operations at Bucko. Table 9 presents a summary of NI 43-101 compliant resources 

disclosed for each deposit.

(rounded to nearest 1000 tonnes) 

** Inferred Resources at Bowden and Apex were disclosed in a press release issued September 17, 

2007(rounded to nearest 1000 tonnes) 

 

The Inferred resources defined at these deposits are considered to represent future exploration 

opportunity for the Company. Due to the lower level of confidence on the quality of defined 

resources and the preliminary stage of their respective economic evaluations, resources 

associated with these deposits have not been considered in the determination of updated 

reserves and resources at Bucko. 

 

16 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
In 2008, Crowflight commissioned a 1000 tonne per day milling facility at the Bucko Site. All 

production from Bucko is to be processed at this facility to produce a nickel sulphide 

concentrate that is shipped under the terms of an off-take agreement with Xstrata dated July 

11, 2007 to smelting facilities owned by Xstrata located in Sudbury, Ontario. As of the effective 

date of this report, insufficient operating information was available to update mineral process 

assumptions. 

A number of metallurgical testing campaigns have been conducted on samples of Bucko Deposit 

mineralized material over the years.  The majority of the historical work was completed on 

behalf of Falconbridge by Lakefield Research, now SGS-Lakefield Laboratories (SGS-L), Lakefield,

Ontario during the 1960s and 1970s.  More recently, additional work was undertaken in 1991, 

also by SGS-L for Falconbridge.  

Design of the Bucko Mill facility involved detailed studies of mineralogy, mineral process and 

design conducted by a number of parties acting on behalf of the Company. This work, 

coordinated and supervised by Micon is presented in the Updated BFS study filed by the 

company on Sedar, April 24, 2007 and is summarized further in the following sections.  

16.1 2005 to 2006 Metallurgical Test Work 
In 2005 to 2007, a program of metallurgical test work was performed by G&T Metallurgical 

laboratories, Kamloops, British Columbia (G&T).  The metallurgical process design for the Bucko 

mill is predominantly based on the G&T program that was completed in 2005.  In November 

2006 a new metallurgical sample comprising three major types of mineralization was 

transported to G&T by Crowflight.  The purpose of this new test program was to optimize 

certain processing parameters and to investigate further the effect of different types of MgO 

mineralization on the metallurgical performance. The results of this test work have been 

incorporated into key assumptions used in this report, discussed in detail in the following 

section. 

 

16.2 2006 to 2007 G&T Testwork Program 
In 2006 a sample comprised of 160 half sawn core intervals of representatively mineralized rock 

weighing approximately 380 kg was submitted to G&T. This composite sample is considered to 

be more representative than the previous sample prepared for the 2005 program, due to the 

greater number of samples taken and the greater spatial distribution of samples throughout the 

Deposit. Figure  shows the Bucko Deposit mineral resource and the drill and metallurgical 

sample locations for both the 2005 and 2006/07 metallurgical test programs.

Figure 15. Long Section Showing the 2006/07 Metallurgical Sample Location 

 

 

The relative abundance of samples included in the bulk sample at specific grades was 

determined using a log normal distribution curve targeting a 2% bulk composite grade (see 

Figure 20). The sample was further sub-characterized based on three mineralogically distinct ore 

types, presented below in Table 10. Ore Type 1 is characteristic of unaltered peridotite 

consisting of fine disseminated interstitial to incipient net textured nickel sulphide 

mineralization in a relatively homogenous gangue assemblage consisting of orthopyroxene and 

amorphous serpentine minerals. When this rock is observed to contain greater than 50% 

fracture controlled to pervasive talc/ tremolite/phlogopite/anthophyllite alteration by volume, it 

was classed as Ore Type 2. Ore Type 3 consists of fracture controlled to semi-massive nickel 

sulphide mineralization occurring along the margins of, and within the interior of, cross-cutting 

pegmatite dykes observed throughout the ore body.

16.3 Design Process 
The 2006/2007 metallurgical program of testing was designed for advanced flow sheet 

development for Bucko Lake mineralization. The primary objectives of this program were: 

• Determine the mineralogical constraints of the previously developed Bucko Lake process.  

• Optimize metallurgical performance at coarser primary grind. 

• Optimize reagent dosages in an effort to reduce reagent costs. 

This program was designed to utilize, as a baseline, the previously developed process for 

recovering a bulk nickel concentrate. As an initial step, a mineralogical assessment of the flow 

sheet developed to date, was performed prior to metallurgical testing. The test program 

assumes using a single composite comprising a split of all the samples for the 

development/optimizing work.  

The work completed in 2007 confirmed that high addition rates of starch depressants in the 

rougher circuit are necessary for efficient mineral separation. A batch test undertaken during 

this phase of work used a test protocol developed in the 2005 program with the exception of 

using a single frother, no concentrate regrind and soda ash addition. The metallurgical result of 

this test (20% Ni grade at 81% Ni Recovery) was a marked improvement over the 2005 work. 

Following the success of this test, the three ore type samples were tested under these 

conditions. Results from these batch tests are presented below in Table 11 with respect to nickel 

recovery, concentrate grade (% nickel) and quality (% MgO).

16.4 Metallurgical Recoveries 
The modeling of metallurgical results from test work conducted on the composite metallurgical 

sample from the Bucko Deposit has produced a number of statistically significant relationships.

Historical work and the G&T variability tests have shown that there is a positive feed grade to 

recovery relationship which is illustrated in Figure 21. In an attempt to estimate the recoveries 

for different feed grades, the G&T variability data were plotted using concentrate grade over 

feed grade (c/f) for the abscissa and recovery for the ordinate.

Using the models developed for the metallurgical composite sample, the nickel upgrade

different MgO contents and nickel feed grades. Results from this test work are further compared 

in the Figure 22 to the 2005 results and the historical results.  The results show that recoveries in 

excess of 80% can be achieved from material ranging in feed head grade from 1.25% nickel to 

2.1% nickel.

16.5 Concentrate Quality 
The multi-element final concentrate analyses for seven of the G&T locked cycle tests are 

presented in Figure 23. In general, the quality of the Bucko Lake nickel concentrate is 

characterized by its high-grade nickel content relative to its potentially problematic MgO.  

Process Selection 

The process selected in the Updated BFS to produce a single primarily nickel concentrate is 

based on the interpretation of the results from the historic and 2005-2007 metallurgical test 

work programs. The selection criteria of the stand-alone processing facility followed a simple 

approach using conventional processing unit operations. The basic process selected comprises 

primary crushing, grinding to 80% passing 98 microns, flotation to produce a single bulk 

concentrate, concentrate dewatering and tailings disposal. 

16.6 Off-take Agreement 
An Off-take agreement between Crowflight and Xstrata dated July 12, 2007 defines the payment 

terms for Xstrata purchase of Crowflight nickel concentrate from the Bucko Mine property. 

Payable metals and smelter penalties for non-conforming elements used in this report are 

defined according to the terms of this agreement.

17 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates: 
Results from a program of surface and underground drilling completed on the property from 

2007 to 2008 were used to produce an updated mineral resource and reserve estimate for 

Bucko. Crowflight updates its resource/reserve statement annually and this report provides 

technical support for the December 31, 2008 update. Mineral resources listed in this report are 

exclusive of reserves unless otherwise specified.  

Based on interpretation of drill results, geological information and updated information 

regarding capital and operating costs available at year end, fully diluted Proven and Probable 

Reserves at Bucko have increased to 3,708,393 tonnes grading 1.45% nickel. This represents a 

22% increase in contained nickel over the 2007 Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS).  

Table 13 presents an updated statement of Reserves and Resources prepared in accordance 

with NI 43-101 guidelines.

17.1 Mineral Resource 
The resource estimates presented in this report were prepared by Crowflight personnel under 

the supervision of Greg Collins, Vice President of exploration for Crowflight and Qualified Person 

for the project in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metal, and Petroleum (CIM) 

definition standards regarding Mineral Resources and Reserves.  

Determination of mineral resources was based on geostatistical block modeling using Gemcom 

Software utilizing the inverse distance squared method for grade interpolation. Estimates were 

based on information from 285 surface and underground diamond drill holes. Composite 

lengths were based on a 1.5 metre ideal interval within resource domain solids. The bulk density 

of nickel mineralized material was based on bulk density measurements where data was 

available and a calculated determination of bulk density proportionate to a formula based on 

nickel content where data was absent. Nickel model interpolation values were primarily 

established in the Measured Resource category based on a 20 metre diameter search ellipse, 

Indicated Resources based on a 35 metre diameter search ellipse and Inferred Resources based 

on a 200 metre diameter search ellipse. Interpreted geological contacts and at a 1.0% nickel cut-

off grade were used to constrain domains used in the interpolation model.  

17.2 Database 
All drilling data was entered and reviewed by Crowflight after being verified as per company  

QAQC procedures.   A Gemcom database was constructed consisting of 285 diamond drill holes 

of which 141 were drilled from underground and 144 were drilled from surface.  Drill hole collar 

location and down hole surveys have been checked and deficiencies were corrected against new 

GPS surveys and database verifications wherever possible. The database was verified in 

Gemcom and corrections were made in order to bring it to an error free status. 

17.3 Data Verification 

A total of 19,591 assay values are contained in the updated database. QAQC verification of all 

assay data added as part of the 2007-2008 drilling program was completed.  A total of 22 data 

errors were observed and corrected (Table 7) , with the overall impact to the database being 

negligible. Figure 15,Figure 16,Figure 17, Figure 18, and Figure 19 present QAQC data collected 

for all blanks and standards collected during 2008. Assay data from approximately 99% of the 

Nuinsco 2000 - 2001 and 100% of the Crowflight 2004 – 2008 assay data has been verified, 

representing approximately 68% of the total database. 

Database verification was also performed on drill hole collar locations, down-hole surveys and 

assay intervals. Corrections to surface drill hole collar locations and elevation were made based 

on location as determined by a DGPS survey and a high resolution LIDAR topographic survey 

completed over the site area in 2007. Down-hole surveys were inspected and corrected where 

obvious input errors occurred. Any out of sequence or overlapping assay intervals were also 

checked and adjusted.

17.4 Domain Interpretation 
Domain boundaries were determined from grade boundary interpretation constrained by 

lithological and structural controls determined from visual inspection of drill hole sections and 

level plans. These resource domains were physically created by computer screen digitizing on 

drill hole level plan sections in Gemcom by Crowflight personnel.  The outlines were influenced 

by the selection of mineralized material above 1.00% Ni that demonstrated a lithological and 

structural zonal continuity along strike and down dip and that had a reasonable expectation of 

being profitably mined.  In some cases, mineralization below 1.00% Ni was included for the 

purpose of maintaining zonal continuity. On each section, polyline interpretations were digitized 

from drill hole to drill hole but were not extended more than 25 m into untested territory.  The 

interpreted polylines from each section were wireframed in Gemcom into 3-dimensional solids.  

The resulting solids (domains) were used for statistical analysis, grade interpolation, rock coding 

and resource reporting purposes.   

Previous updates (November 2005, December 2006) were based on three principal domains 

discussed in the previous section regarding geology and referred to respectively as Lower, 

Middle and Upper domain. The 2008 update expands upon this basis of interpretation with the 

further division of these original domains into Lower, Middle and Upper domains specific to 

each of the West Limb and Hinge Zone trends. In addition, new domains modeling the 

distribution of Pegmatite, and low grade material occurring peripheral to original resource 

domains were created. In total, nine domains were used to constrain interpolation runs for the 

updated block model. 

17.5 Rock Type Determination 
The rock types used for the resource model were coded from the mineralized domain 

solids.  The list of rock codes used follows: 

Rock Code   Description  

  0  Air  

  5  Pegmatite  

10  Lower Mineralized Domain (West Limb) 

15  Lower Mineralized Domain (Hinge Zone)  

20  Middle Mineralized Domain (West Limb) 

25  Middle Mineralized Domain (Hinge Zone) 

30  Upper Mineralized Domain (West Limb) 

35  Upper Mineralized Domain (Hinge Zone)

40  Low Grade Domain (West Limb) 

45  Low Grade Domain (Hinge Zone) 

99  Waste Rock 

17.6 Composites  
Length weighted composites were generated for the drill hole data that fell within the 

constraints of the above-mentioned domains.  These length adjusted composites were 

calculated for Ni and Cu and were compiled over ideal 1.50 m lengths starting at the first point 

of intersection between the drill hole and the hangingwall of the 3-D zonal constraint ending at 

the last point of exit.  Un-assayed intervals were introduced with a 0.25% Ni background grade 

so as to provide a representative value to low-grade internal dilution. The composite data was 

transferred to Gemcom extraction files for the grade interpolation as an X, Y, Z, Ni, Cu files for 

each domain 

17.7 Grade Capping 
Grade capping was investigated utilizing the raw assay values in the database within each 

domain to ensure that the possible influence of erratic high values did not bias the database.  

Extraction files were created for constrained Ni and Cu data within each mineralized domain.  

From these extraction files, log normal histograms and log normal probability plots were 

generated for each domain group.  Based on these plots, nickel values in excess of 8%, and 

copper values in excess of 1% were deemed to be effective values for grade capping to minimize 

the impact of these samples on the grade model.  

17.8 Variography  
Variography was undertaken in 2008 on the constrained domain composites with limited 

success. The application of variography is limited due to the inconsistently variable nature of the 

deposit within individual mineral envelopes. This inconsistency results in unrepresentative 

comparative volumes that do not generate meaningful variograms. However, reasonable 

mineralized multi-sectional continuity and grade was observed, in the Lower, Middle and Upper 

domains, to invoke sufficient confidence in search ellipse orientations consistent with the 

principle orientations of the modeled domains. 

17.9 Bulk Density 
The bulk density used for the resource model was derived from measurements of test work 

performed by ALS Chemex of Mississauga, Ontario in 2006.  A review of the relationship 

between sulphur and nickel content established a positive linear correlation between the level 

of mineralization and observed bulk density.  Based on this relationship, an equation was 

utilized to assign a modeled bulk density value to those assay samples in the database where no 

bulk density measurements had been taken. Figure 24 depicts this relationship and presents the 

formula used to populate the historical assay database with representative bulk density values.

Figure 24. Bulk Density vs. Nickel Content 

 

 

A total of 2,830 bulk density measurements were taken from core samples collected in 2006. 

The average bulk density of samples containing greater than 1.4% nickel was 2.93 g/cm³, with 

values of density ranging from 5.57 g/cm³ to 2.42 g/cm³. 

17.10 Block Modeling 
A block model framework was created in Gemcom consisting of 59,148,000 blocks that were 2 

metres in X direction, 2 metres in Y direction and 2m in Z direction.  There were 265 columns (X), 

465 rows (Y) and 480 levels (Z). The model was not rotated.  Separate block models were 

created for rock type, bulk density, resource classification, Ni and Cu. A new block model 

assigning values of rock mass rating or RMR was created based on drill hole geotechnical data to 

assist with engineering design at the mine. 

The 2008 model was designed on a Selective Mining Unit (SMU) basis for greater consistency 

with use of current design practise. As such, no percent model was created. Blocks occupying

more than 50% within each domain were coded accordingly so that no volumetric overlap in 

block coding between domains could occur.  As a result, the domain boundaries are properly 

represented by the block model on a scale practical for design and extraction. 

The Ni and Cu composites were extracted from the Microsoft Access database composite table 

into separate files for each Mineralized Zone.  Inverse distance squared grade interpolation 

(1/d

) was utilized in three interpolation passes to determine Measured, Indicated, and Inferred 

classifications.  Ni and Cu grade blocks were interpolated using the following parameters:

17.11 Resource Classification 
For the purposes of this resource estimate, classifications were initially derived from the 

Measured Indicated and Inferred search ranges and interpolation parameters from Table 14.  

Any grade block coded as Measured was denoted with code 1, Indicated was denoted with code 

2 and Inferred as code 3. Additional small areas of Indicated and inferred material adjacent to or 

in between Measured and Indicated blocks were manually re-coded, so that consistent zones of 

classified material could be established.

The mineralization classification distribution at a 0.001% Ni cut-off for all domains is as follows: 

• Measured Grade Blocks  240,576     (5%) 

• Indicated Grade Blocks  1,984,467  (40%) 

• Inferred Grade Blocks  2,680,197  (55.0%)  

• Total Grade Blocks  4,905,240  (100.0%)   

 

17.12 Resource Estimate 
The Mineralized Zone resource estimate was derived by applying Ni cut-off grades to the block 

model and reporting the resulting tonnes and grade for potential mineable areas.  The following 

calculations demonstrate the rationale supporting the 1.0% Ni cut-off grades that determine the 

potentially economic portion of the mineralized domains.  Ni cut-off grade calculation 

parameters are listed in Table 15.  

 

Table 15. Ni Cut-Off Grade Calculation Parameters (All currency is $US) 

Parameter  Value 

Ni Price $6.00/lb  

Mining Cost $45/tonne 

Process Cost  $17/tonne 

Process Recovery  81.0%  

G/A $5/tonne 

Concentrate Shipping $60/tonne 

Concentration Ratio 10:1 

Smelter Treatment Charge $125/tonne 

Smelter Payables 90.0%  

Refining Charges $0.60/lb Ni 

 

Therefore: [($45 + $17 + $5) + (($60 + $125)/10))] / [(($6.00 x 81% x 90%) - $0.60) x 

22.046] = 0.973%   (Use 1.0% Ni) 

The above data were derived from the Micon Preliminary Assessment Study, October 22, 2004 

and recent metallurgical test work and are considered to be reasonable. This rounded 1.0% Ni

• Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The estimate of mineral 

resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other 

relevant issues. 

• The quantity and grade of reported inferred resources in this estimation are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient 
exploration to define these inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource and it is uncertain if further 

exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured mineral resource category. 

 

The mineral resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 

Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines 

prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council 

December 11, 2005. 

17.13 Resource Sensitivity 
Resource estimate sensitivity is presented in Table 17.  This was derived by applying a series of 

increasing Ni cut-off grades to the nine domains which constrain the grade model. In this table, 

resources are shown inclusive of reserves.

17.14 Confirmation of Resource Estimate 
The block model was first reviewed by visual inspection using sections and plan slices to ensure 

that grade interpolation honors the data and the domain boundaries. As a test of the 

reasonableness of the estimate, the block model was queried at a 0.001% Ni cut off grade, with 

blocks in all classifications summed and their grades weight averaged.  This average is the 

average grade of all blocks within the mineralized domain. The values of the interpolated grades 

for the block model were compared to the length weighted capped average grades and average 

grade of composites of all samples from within the domain. The results are presented in Table 

18. 

Table 18. Comparison of Capped Assays, Composites and Block Model Average Grade 

Category Ni (%) Cu (%) 

Capped Assays 0.68 0.05 

Composites 0.60 0.04 

Block Model 0.50 0.05 

 

The comparison above shows the average grade of all the blocks in the domain to be very close 

to the weighted average of all capped assays and composites used for grade estimation. This 

analysis illustrates that through the interpolation of the resource data set the average grade 

calculated at each step for all of the data were consistent with the average grade for all of the 

original capped data. Therefore the data set does not appear to have been biased at any stage 

by the data interpolation process, including grade capping. 

17.15 Independent Verification of Resources 
Resource updates at Bucko were independently reviewed by Eugene Puritch, P.Eng. of P&E 

Mining Consultants Inc. ("P&E") of Brampton, Ontario. P&E conducted a verification of the 

estimates prepared by Crowflight and was able to replicate the results within an acceptable 

margin of variance and has concluded that the methodology employed by Crowflight is 

consistent with industry standards.

17.16 Mining Reserves 
Mining Reserves presented in this report were derived from the mineable portion of the 

3,651,098 tonne measured and indicated resource grading 1.76% Ni as defined by a cut-off 

grade of 1.25% Ni. They represent the portion of the Measured and Indicated mineral resources 

that have been subject to a detailed economic assessment undertaken by Crowflight and its 

independent mining consultant, Python Mining Consultants (Python). Stope design, 

underground development and all volumetric queries were created by Python using the 

computerized mine design software package, Surpac. Estimates for volumetrics and tonnage 

calculations were verified by Crowflight using the deposit modeling and resource estimation 

software package, Gemcom.  

Mine design factors used in the reserve estimate are consistent with standard industry practices 

for base metal deposits. They include: 

• Utilization of the resource block model as a basis for stope design. A full block approach 

was utilized with stope shells based on the full block.  Block sizing is 2mW x 2mD x 2mH 

which is smaller than the minimum mining width.   

• The stopes are defined by a 1.25% nickel cut-off grade within the ultramafic zone.  

Stopes are defined by grade boundaries, not geological contacts.   

• The parameters for the minimum mining width were based on a 1:1 ratio for pillar 

requirements using a minimum sill width of 2.4 metres. Minimum pillar width allowed 

was 2.4 metres.  Sill level heights are approximately 30m from floor to floor with an 

estimated drill-hole length of 30m along dip.  

• Conversion of resources to reserves was considered the following factors: mining, 

dilution and recovery, mucking recovery, allowance for backfill gouging, accountability 

parameters and break-even mining costs. The economic analysis includes capital, 

development and operating costs.  

• Dilution was modeled to be 12% with an average nickel grade of 0.8% nickel.  Block 

model queries conducted by Crowflight on the Python Stope design indicated a block 

model calculated dilution grade of 0.8% nickel.  

• Mining of the reserve was based on longhole extraction methods.  

• Mining method includes the use of consolidated backfill and sequencing based on a 

series of primary and secondary stopes to achieve complete recovery of the modeled 

reserve. 

•  Crowflight began the extraction and process of ores from the deposit in September of 

2008 via the completion of initial overcut and undercut development. As of the effective

17.17 Other factors with Material Influence on Reserves: 
It is assumed for purposes of this report that life of mine tailing deposition will use Bucko Lake 

as the site for subaqueous tailings storage. This method is accepted as an industry best practice 

for potentially acid generating tailings. In 2005 the Company started a process with the federal 

and provincial governments to remove Bucko Lake from the list of lakes under Schedule 2 of the 

Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER).  Currently the company has secured permits to 

operate at Bucko using a temporary land based Interim Tailings Storage Facility (ITSF), permitted 

by the provincial government for the period of one year. Under the current timeline for 

permitting, the company expects to obtain full federal permitting for use of Bucko Lake in 2010.

In the event that such permitting is not obtained, the company is evaluating other means of 

tailings storage including expansion of the current ITSF.

19 Interpretation and Conclusions 
This report serves as supporting technical documentation for Crowflight's annual mineral 

resource and reserve statement and for the Company's Annual Information Form. The report is 

intended to conform to the structure of NI43-101 Form 1.  

The following conclusions may be drawn from this technical review: 

• Results from a program of underground infill drilling completed in 2008 are consistent 

with feasibility reserve estimates. This drilling has enabled Crowflight establish proven 

reserves for areas of initial production at Bucko. 

• Reduced operating costs, favourable exchange rates, completed construction of site 

facilities, refinement of the life of mine plan  and removal of project debt have enabled 

reduction in reserve cut-off grades. This reduction of cut-off grade has contributed to an 

increase to reserves, having positive impact on pounds of nickel produced, mine life and 

project NPV. The updated reserve presented in this report represents a 22% increase in 

contained nickel when compared to reserves presented in the 2007 Updated BFS 

Report. 

• Opportunity to further expand reserves via the conversion of resources and the 

exploration of extensions to the deposit is good.  

 

19.1 Discussion of Results from Infill Program 
The results from 2008 infill and exploration drilling programs at Bucko have confirmed 

expectations with respect to geology, ground conditions and distribution of mineralization. 

When comparing 2008 estimates of mineral resource with 2006 estimates in areas infilled at a 

similar Ni cut-off (1.4% nickel cutoff was used in the 2007 Updated BFS resource estimates) 

areas upgraded from an Indicated class to a Measured resource category resulted in a 6.3% drop 

in tonnes and a 3.0% increase in grade. This difference is well within expected variance, and 

provides confidence in the feasibility design.  The chart depicted in Figure 25 illustrates the net 

change in terms of contained nickel between the current update, and the 2006 Updated BFS 

Resource at similar Ni grade cut-offs.

19.2 Increased Reserves 
Since commencing operations at Bucko, Crowflight has achieved several milestones including 

the repayment of debt associated with construction and commissioning of plant and 

underground workings, development of the first main zones of commercial production and 

production and delivery of concentrate as per design specifics. These activities have enabled 

Crowflight to review its reserves under these modified conditions. 

 At current metal prices forecast operating costs for 2009 based on an average production rate 

of 1000 per day remain sufficiently low to sustain operations at Bucko at design rates of 

production. Using a longer term outlook regarding the price of nickel at US $6.00, mining and 

milling of the reserves presented in this report at the current permitted average production rate 

of 1,000 tonnes per day would generate net income of $325 million over an 11 year design life.  

19.3 Opportunity to Expand Reserves and Resources 
Within current resource categories, excellent opportunity remains to further increase reserves 

by upgrading resources in the hinge and main zones. From an exploration standpoint, a new 

mineralized horizon has been identified in a footwall position to the main deposit. As well, the 

ore body remains open for additional resource expansion at depth.  

The following chart (Figure 27) presents a relationship between meters drilled in mineralized 

ultramafic and reserves per level. The chart suggests that there is opportunity to increase 

reserves on poorly infilled levels by the completion of additional drilling. 

Figure 27. Drilling and Reserves 

 

Prospective elevated nickel grade thickness  trends at Bucko remain open for additional 

resource expansion at depth on the West Limb, Hinge Zone, and Footwall zone trends. Drilling 

along these trends in the upper portions of the mine has been successful to date in growing 

resources and converting resources to reserves.  Additional exploration targeting these trends is 

recommended. Figure 28 depicts and isometric 3D view of the projected mineralized surface

20 Recommendations 
 

Additional underground drilling is required to replace and expand reserves along planned 

corridors of mining in preparation for final stope design, sequencing and mining. Plans in 2009 

include the drilling of approximately 20,000 metres to achieve the following objectives: 

• Phase 2 Underground Drilling Program – Completion of approximately 7,500m in 35 

holes completed from the 1000' level exploration drift. The objective of this program is 

to establish proven reserves in advance of development and mining scheduled in 2009.  

• Phase 3 Ramp Drilling Program – Completion of approximately 3,500 metres in 22 holes 

to facilitate the completion of crown pillar design on the 450' level and delineate 

approximately 180,000 tonnes located between the 450' and 550' levels. Once 

completed by mid 2009 mining of these areas will commence via the surface ramp. 

• Hinge Zone Drilling – Underground access afforded by level development on the 900' 

level will be used to infill drill a large panel of Indicated Resources in the hinge zone 

areas between the 1000' and 800' mining levels by the completion of 6,500 metres in 25 

holes. This area maintains high potential for the conversion of this resource to 

additional mining reserves. 

• Underground Exploration – 2500 metres of drilling is planned in 2009 to further 

investigate the resource potential of the Footwall Zone between the 1000' and 1400' 

mining levels. This program would be completed from the hanging wall exploration drift.     

As production progresses, utilize ongoing grade control information to reconcile production 

statistics with the resource model to further refine data regarding variance in the grade model 

and actual stope dilution. Based on this data, assumptions regarding dilution and recovery may 

be reviewed.

21 Additional Requirements for Development and Production 

Properties 
Python Mining Consultants (Python) was hired by Crowflight to review existing mine 

infrastructure and updated information regarding operating and capital costs to update the 

mine design and scheduling plan at the deposit.  The work consisted of designing stopes and 

development based on the updated geological block model presented in this report.  Diluted 

mining reserves were determined to be 3.7 million tonnes grading 1.45% nickel.  

Crowflight owns and operates its mine and mill facilities at Bucko Lake. Crowflight commenced 

production during the fourth quarter of 2008 and expects to produce approximately 9.1 million 

pounds of nickel in 2009. 

21.1 Existing Infrastructure 
Mining operations at Bucko make use of existing mining and milling infrastructure. Current 

infrastructure incorporated in this report: 

• Fully refurbished 340 metre deep 3 compartment timbered shaft and hoist. The 

timbered shaft has three compartments, each compartment measuring 1.8 m by 1.8 m.  

Two of the compartments will be used for hoisting with the remaining compartment to 

be used as a man-way to surface. 

• Existing development on the 1000'L consisting of a shaft station and a hangingwall 

exploration drift (on the same level).  In 2008, Crowflight added approximately 1,200 

metres of pre-production development, completed a vent raise to surface, and 

constructed a new ore pass system. 

• In 2008 Crowflight began driving a surface and internal ramp system to connect 

underground production levels. At year end, approximately 800 metres of this system 

had been completed. 

• 110 ft high headframe with ore storage bin and 8 ft Nordberg hoist, 5 ton capacity 

hoisting skips and conveyance - in service since September of 2007. 

• Low Cost electrical power supplied by Manitoba Hydro connected to site in August 2007. 

• 80 person office and dry complex  

• Crusher complex and conveyance system to provide feed from coarse ore bin in head 

frame to mill. In service since September 2008 

• Surface repair shop and warehouse in service since November 2008.

• Fully commissioned 1000 tonne per day mill facility consisting of Rod and Ball mill, 

standard flotation and cleaner circuits and Larox filter system. In service since 

November 2008. 

• Land based interim tailings basin and tailings delivery and water reclaim system.  

 

21.2 Mine Design 
Mining operations are designed for an average underground extraction rate of 1,000 tonnes of 

ore per day, 500 tonnes of waste.  Access to the mine is from an existing 340 metre timbered 3 

compartment shaft, each compartment measuring 1.8 m by 1.8m. Two of the compartments are 

used for hoisting with the remaining compartment used as a man-way to surface. 

Mining levels are accessed via an internal ramp. In the upper portions of the mine an orepass 

system will be used to move ore to the loading pocket in the shaft. Some haulage to surface via 

trucks is planned for mining in the uppermost levels of the deposit, prior to breakthrough of the 

orepass system.  A grizzly and rock breaker station has been installed to control oversize muck 

and handle trucked ore. Mining levels are currently designed with 30m spacing; however 

flexibility exists in the design to modify where advantageous.  

The internal ramp has a design 15% grade and is approximately 4.2 m wide by 4.5 m high, 

located in the mining footwall. The internal ramp is designed to connect to a ramp driven from 

surface enabling the conveyance materials, men and equipment underground.   Remuck stations 

and safety bays will be excavated during the mining of the ramp. The safety bays will measure 

1.5 m by 2.0 m and will be driven every 30 m for all the ramp systems. 

All primary footwall development is located in competent gneissic rock outside mineralized 

zones of ultramafic rock. Development in footwall rocks will require the installation of 

mechanical rock bolts and screen in the back. Development through mineralized zones in 

ultramafic occurs in a less competent medium. Ground support in ultramafic requires 

installation of fully grouted re-bar and screen as a means of primary support, and cable bolting 

as required to provide secondary support.  

Ventilation from surface to levels above the 1000' mining level is provided by 3 metre by 3 

metre inclined vent raise and 2 -  200 H.P. fans heated with a 22 million BTU propane heater. 

Below the 1000' level drop raises between ramp levels will connect to the existing surface vent 

raise on 1000' level providing primary ventilation to lower portions the mine. 

Pumping of mine water is handled via a 100 H.P. 10 stage pump located on the 1000' level. A 

400 H.P. is in place as a back-up. Mine waters are pumped to surface where they are introduced 

to the tailings pump box and discharged to tailings.

Phone: 416-861-5900  Fax: 416-861-8165 

79

Electricity is delivered to the underground via  two 4160 V cables in the shaft and  stepped down 

to 600 V using a 1000 kVA transformer located on the 1000'and 400' levels. A 2 MW diesel 

generator is installed on site for backup power capable of running mill essentials and 

underground hoist, fans and pumps. 

Compressed air is supplied to the underground with four 700 cfm 150 H.P. Gardener Denver 

compressors located in the hoist building on surface.  

21.2.1 Mining Method 

The mining method selected by Crowflight is longhole open stoping with sublevel access on 30 

m intervals. The stopes are to be backfilled with cemented hydraulic fill and development waste. 

The sublevels will be connected via an internal ramp. Maximum stope dimensions were defined 

as 20 metres wide by 20 metres long by 30 metres high. Backfill will be introduced underground 

via a series of drill holes and HDPE piping located in the ramp. 

21.2.2 Infrastructure 

A garage/shop facility, a permanent refuge station, fuel storage and loading facility, powder and 

cap magazines will be located on the 1000 Level. The dimensions of these facilities are as 

follows: 

• Detonator magazine (4 m x 4 m x 4 m), at least 8 m from the powder magazine. 

• Powder magazine (7 m x 5.5 m x 5 m). 

• Refuge station (5.5 m x 5 m x 6 m). 

• Workshop (5.5 m x 5 m x 8 m). 

• Fuel bay (5.5 m x 5 m x 8 m). 

• Rock breaker station (3.8 m x 3.8 m x 5 m). 

There will be one sump per level for trapping and containing water inflows. The sumps will be 

interconnected by boreholes to pumping stations located on the 400, 1000 and 1800 Levels for 

removal of the mine water to the surface mill. Each sump will measure 2.4 m wide by 2.4 m high 

by 3.8 m deep. 

21.2.3 Level and Stope Design 

Level development consists of haulage drifts driven parallel to the footwall contact connecting 

to the internal ramp and ventilation system. Access to stoping areas is afforded by cross-cuts 

from the footwall haulage drift into the mineralized ultramafic. Stopes are to be mined using 

longhole open stoping methods, typically starting in the hanging wall position and retreating 

towards the footwall. Overcuts, intersections and draw point areas are to be supported by fully 



Crowflight Minerals Inc.

80

grouted cable bolts, with an anticipated use of up to 25% shotcrete coverage in ultramafic 

development.  

Once extracted, stopes will be filled with cemented hydraulic backfill and development waste. 

The excavated quantities of waste rock, partially mineralized ultramafics and the ore were 

scheduled taking into account maximum flexibility with multiple faces and a reduced delay due 

to backfill curing. All lateral development is designed to be 4.0 metres wide by 4.2 metres high. 

21.2.4 Development 

The existing shaft provides access to production areas on the 400' and 1000' levels. The ramp 

connecting the internal mining levels to surface provides access to upper portions of the 

deposit. Mining above the 1000'L will utilize an ore pass system feeding the loading pocket in 

the shaft on the 1000' (2740 metre) level where practical, and make use of trucks to either haul 

material directly to surface or to the loading pocket on the 1000' level. From the 1000' level the 

internal ramp will be extended below the 1000'L down to the 1900' (2350 metre) level (to 

access mining levels in the lower portion of the mine. Muck produced below the 1000' level will 

be trucked via the internal ramp up to the loading pocket on the 1000' level. General Mine 

layout is shown in Figure 29, Figure 30, and Figure 31.

21.2.5 Stoping Considerations 

Stopes will be mined via conventional longhole methods. The minimum mining width considered 

was 2.4m. All overcut and draw point locations will be supported with 8' resin rebar and screen 

as primary support, and fully grouted 20' and 30' cable bolts for secondary support. Where 

necessary, secondary support may be complimented with the use of shotcrete and screen 

straps. Drilling up-holes from sill horizons in areas that do not reach the sill above has also been 

considered to maximize recovery. 

In general the stope sequence rules are: 

1. Drill 

2. Load/Blast 

3. Muck 

4. Fill 

5. Cure (28 days)

83

Stoping areas have been identified as primary and secondary with respect to reserves.  These 

are areas which will be mined according to the following criteria: 

• Ore development for each stope must be complete above and below the stope. 

• Maximum stope dimensions are 20m wide x 20m long x 30m high.   

• Each 20 m long stope must be mined and filled from the periphery of the Deposit and in 

general the minng sequence retreats towards more central access. 

• Stopes that run parallel to each other along strike will be mined and filled moving from the 

hangingwall to the footwall. 

21.2.6 Mine Schedule 

The design criteria used to develop the mine plan are as follows: an advance rate is 3.8 metres 

per day in any single heading, and each stope can produce up to 500 tonnes per day. The 

following activities were included in the stoping process: Longhole drilling – 350 m/day, Loading 

explosives – 1,800 t/d (explosive tonnes), Mucking – 1000 t/d (mined tonnes), Filling – 600 t/d 

(backfill tonnes) and a 28-day curing period. 

The mining equipment resources used in preparing the following mine schedule include: 

• Two 30 tonne capacity haulage trucks 

• Two 6 cubic yard LHDs 

• Two bolting crews with scissor lift 

• Two drill jumbos 

• Two longhole drills 

• Two development crews 

• Two stoping crews 

• One backfill crew 

Undercut access on the 1000' mining level and overcut development on the 900'L is in place to 

commence mining of the first commercial design stopes in early 2009. In 2009 production at 

Bucko will be focused on extraction of primary and secondary stopes from the first commercial 

mining zone (South Zone), primary stopes from the second commercial mining zone (North 

Zone) on 1000, and initial stopes on the 900' mining level. Access afforded by the ramp from 

surface will enable mining from the 500' mining level once the crown pillar has been stabilized 

during second quarter of 2009. Beyond 2009 into 2010, the mining sequence consists of 

development on mining levels upward from the 1000'L toward surface. In 2010 the internal 

ramp will be driven below the 1000' level, where mining from the 1600' level and 1900' level

21.2.7 Geotechnical Considerations 

Geotechnical parameters presented in the 2007 Updated BFS were considered for the purposes 

of mine design and support in this report. The mine design layout for Bucko Lake maintains that 

the maximum stope dimensions for open stoping is 20 m wide by 20 m long by 30 m high.  The 

stope stability assessment completed using the Mathews Method was revisited based on the 

updated rock mass classifications expected in the stoping areas. The results from the updated 

stope stability assessment are consistent with the previous Golder study (November 2005) and 

indicate that the initial stope dimensions for open stoping ranged in rankings from stable to 

requiring support to potentially caving. 

Additional Work Completed since 2007: 

• The development of a geotechnical model to infer rock mass quality, an assessment of 

rock support requirements, an assessment of stope stability to evaluate stope 

dimensions, and stability assessments for the four proposed crown pillars at the site. 

• Confirmation of bedrock elevation in the vicinity of the Crown Pillar via review of a 

seismic refraction survey and completion of 4 holes in 2006. 

• Creation and update of a Rock Mass Rating geotechnical model based on 14,000 

detailed geotechnical measurements from core. 

• Confirmation of material properties through material strength tests completed on rock 

samples submitted from core and underground workings. 

• Development and implementation of standard ground support procedures 

• Test mining of low grade material located near the southern extremity of mineralization 

on the 1000' mining level

21.3 Milling Operations 
The installed processing plant was based on the design resulting from the updated metallurgical 

testwork program discussed in Section 16.0 of this document.  The design of the concentrator 

comprises primary crushing, rod milling, ball milling, flotation, concentrate dewatering and 

tailings disposal.  The concentrator is currently designed to produce a nickel sulphide flotation 

concentrate at a rate of 1,000 tonnes per day, but can be expanded to the rate of 1,500 tonnes 

per day with a minimum capital investment and amended permitting. A simplified sketch of the 

milling process is shown below in Figure 32.

21.3.2 Crushing and Storage Area 

The ore from the underground mine is hoisted to surface and stored in the coarse ore shaft bin.  

The underground run of mine ore is sized through a jaw crusher and cone crusher, series of 

transfer conveyor belts and vibratory triple deck screen. The 32x22 inch Jaw crusher sizes the 

material to 125 mm.  The 5 foot crusher then sizes the mill feed product to ½ inch or less and is 

directed to a 12 m diameter by 20 m high fine ore bin.  Thefine ore bin holds a live capacity of 

1,500 tonnes.  A fixed magnet is installed at the head-end of the coarse ore conveyor to remove 

tramp steel.   Four vibrating feeders located under the fine ore bin are used to feed the crushed 

ore at a controlled rate, via a 0.61 m wide conveyor, to the rod mill, which is situated in the 

main mill building.  A weightometer is installed on the mill feed belt. 

21.3.3 Grinding  

The grinding circuit comprises a 9 x 12 foot rod mill equipped with a 450 hp motor followed by a 

12 x 16 foot ball mill equipped with 1500 hp motor. The discharge product from both mills is 

pumped from the cyclone feed pumpbox to a cyclone cluster from which the overflow sizing 

80% passing 98 microns is routed to the flotation circuit. The underflow from the cyclone 

cluster, comprising two 457 mm diameter cyclones, is recycled to the ball mill.  

21.3.4 Flotation Circuit  

The flotation circuit comprises a rougher/scavenger stage (5 x 300 ft
3
 cells) and three cleaner 

stages. The cleaner circuits consist of 5 x 50 ft
3
 primary cells, 3 x 50 ft

3
 secondary cells and 2 x 50 

ft
3
 tertiary cells. The rougher circuit is fed from the second of two 1.8 m wide by 3.7 m high 

conditioners, which are used to mix the initial dose of reagents with the grinding circuit product.

The tailings product from the scavenger cells is combined with the primary cleaner tailings and 

pumped to either the tailings dam or the backfill plant. The tertiary cleaner concentrate is the 

final product and is pumped to the concentrate thickener and filter section for dewatering. The 

routing of the intermediate flotation streams within the flotation circuit is portrayed visually on 

the flowsheet.   

21.3.5 Concentrate Dewatering  

The overflow from the 5 m diameter thickener discharges into the process water tank while the 

underflow is pumped to the 5.1 m diameter concentrate stock tank.  The concentrate stock tank 

is sized to hold 18 hours of flotation concentrate. The thickener operates continuously while the 

filter circuit operates only 12 hours per day. 

The thickened concentrate is pumped at a controlled rate from the stock tank and fed to a Larox 

Filter. The filtrate product (filter cake) from the Larox Filter is recovered containing 

approximately 8% moisture, is emptied into a concentrate load out storage areas located below. 

The concentrate is periodically loaded into trucks and transported to concentrate handling 

facilities in Winnipeg before it is transferred to rail for shipment to smelting facilities owned by 

Xstrata in Sudbury 

21.3.6 Backfill Plant 

The backfill plant is designed to supply the underground mine with hydraulic backfill. A 

dedicated pump attached to the final tailing pump box delivers tailings to the backfill cyclone 

cluster.  The backfill cyclone cluster comprises three operating and one standby hydrocyclone.  

The cyclone overflow, containing approximately15% solids by weight, gravitates to the flotation 

tailings pumpbox while the underflow, containing about 70% solids, discharges onto the backfill 

dewatering screen. The undersize from the screen is pumped back to the flotation tailings 

pumpbox and the oversize is conveyed to a stockpile.  This stockpiled material is reclaimed using 

a front end loader and mixed with water and cement in the backfill slurry batch mixing tank.   

When required underground the hydraulic backfill gravitates from the batch mixing tank 

through a borehole to the underground distribution system. 

 

21.3.7 Reagents 

The reagents used in the flotation circuit are: 

• Isopropyl Xanthate (collector); 500 g/t float feed or 500 kg/d.  

• Dowfroth 250 (frother); 27 g/t float feed or 27 kg/d. 

• MIBC (frother); 120 g/t float feed or 120 kg/d. 

• Sodium Sulphydrate (NaHS); 125 g/t float feed or 125 kg/d.

• PE26 - CMC (gangue depressant); 1,300 g/t or 1,300 kg/d. 

• Aero Promoter 3418A (collector); 10 g/t or 10 kg/d. 

The flocculent recommended from metallurgical testing for concentrate thickening is: 

• Superfloc A130 (Flocculent); 10 g/t of concentrate or 0.8 kg/d. 

Suitable storage, make-up systems and dosing facilities have been included within scope of the 

process plant and infrastructure design.  

21.3.8 Plant Utilities, Services and Water Systems 

A low-pressure air blower, plant air compressor and instrument air compressor with ancillaries 

have been included within the scope of concentrator building services. 

The reclaim water pumps and line from the tailings deposition area feed the 7 m diameter by 7 

m high process water tank, which is situated near the main process building. Process water 

pumps (100 mm x 75 mm) are utilized to feed the process water distribution system.  

Emergency water demand (fire fighting) is also supplied from the process water tank. Fresh 

water in the plant is used for the potable water system, gland seal water and the fresh water 

distribution system. 

21.4 Production Forecast 
The Bucko mine is planned to support production of approximately 359,000 tonnes in 2009, 

after which production of 363,000 tonnes per year for the duration of mine life is forecast based 

on the production scenario considered in this report.  

 

21.5 Market Assumptions 
Under the terms of an Offtake Agreement with Xstrata – all concentrate to be produced from 

the deposit will be shipped to Xstrata under payment terms specified in the Agreement. These 

terms are subject to fluctuations in the spot market price for nickel. 

Under the terms of the Agreement, a net smelter return (NSR) is payable to Xstrata on the 

proceeds of production for all nickel sold at a monthly averaged daily spot price that is greater 

than U.S. $6.00. This NSR is not payable for product sold at metal prices less than US $6.00. 

Sensitivity models used in this report have taken this into consideration.  

21.6 Contracts 
Table presents a list of contracts in place that enable the mining, concentrating, transportation 

and handling, and refining of all products from the Bucko Mine site. These contracts and rate 

structures are consistent with industry norms and are reflected in the costs used to determine 

reserves presented in this report.

21.7 Environmental Considerations 
The company has filed a site closure plan with the Manitoba Department of Mines. As part of 

this plan, the Company has posted bonds to ensure proper site reclamation is completed 

following mine closure. 

The company is also operating on a 1 year permit to store tailings in a surface interim tailings 

storage facility. It is the understanding of Crowflight that the permit can be extended by 

Crowflight but an application to extend the facility must be submitted to the Manitoba 

provincial government. In addition, Crowflight continues to work with its stakeholders and the 

federal government to allow Crowflight to use Bucko Lake as a tailings storage facility. 

Crowflight is confident that it will receive this permit although there is a risk that this permit will 

not be granted. 

Company activities are subject to extensive federal, provincial and local laws and regulations 

governing environmental protection and employee health and safety. Environmental legislation 

is evolving in a manner that is creating stricter standards, while enforcement, fines and penalties 

for non-compliance are more stringent.  The cost of compliance with changes in governmental 

regulations has the potential to reduce the profitability of operations.  Further, any failure to 

comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations could have significant adverse effects on 

Crowflight, including the suspension or cessation of operations. 

21.8 Taxes 
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this 

method, future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between 

the financial statement carrying values and the income tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are 

measured using the substantively enacted income tax rates and laws that are expected to be in 

effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on future income tax 

assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the

Phone: 416-861-5900  Fax: 416-861-8165 

92

date of enactment or substantive enactment of the change. When the future realization of 

income tax assets does not meet the test of being more likely than not to occur, a valuation 

allowance in the amount of the potential future benefit is taken and no net asset is recognized. 

 

21.9 Economic Analysis 

21.9.1 Basis of Evaluation 

Python and Crowflight have developed a mining plan around existing facilities at the Bucko site 

to extract and treat 1,000 t/d of nickel ore.  Based on a total of 3,708,393 reserve tonnes grading 

1.45, a mine life of 11 years is considered. 

The estimates of metal production, capital costs and operating costs are combined in the 

discounted cash flow evaluation. The base case metal prices are presented in Table 24.  

Table 24. Metal Prices 

Nickel US$6.00/lb 

Copper US$1.50/lb 

Cobalt US$12/lb 

Platinum US$880/oz 

Palladium US$230/oz 

Rhodium US$1,000/oz 

Gold US$700oz 

 

The base case unit prices for nickel, copper, platinum, palladium and gold are below the average 

market price for the last three calendar years (2006 to 2008) and reflect the company's current 

long term outlook on metal prices. A Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rate of 1.20 has 

been assumed. The results of the base case cash flow evaluation are summarized in the 

following table (Table 25) showing life-of-mine totals.

 Metal sales revenue is for payable nickel only. 

 

Factors assumed in the creation of the cash flow model include: 

• Sunk costs to the end of 2008 are not included but subsequent actual expenditures are 
included. 

• Payment of applicable royalties. 

 

Capital costs are taken from the sustaining development (primary and secondary) estimated 

described in section 23. Operating costs are derived from the detailed build up of personnel, 

supplies and services required to maintain continuous operation of the facility.  Local personnel 

salary and overhead rates applied are considered to be current for northern Manitoba and 

compare reasonably to those rates in effect at other mining operations in the area. All unit rates 

for significant operating supplies are based on quotes received from suppliers.

94

The production rates and metal content are based upon the feasibility mine plan and recovery 

rates are supported by recent metallurgical testing. 

21.9.2 Royalties and Taxes 

Xstrata is entitled to a 2.5% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty payable at nickel prices equal to or 

greater than $US6.00 per pound.  Xstrata is not entitled to any royalty below nickel prices of 

US$6.00 /lb. 

21.9.3 Discounted Cash Flow Model 

The detailed discounted cash flow for the base case is presented at the end of this section in 

Error! Reference source not found.. As no pre-production capital is required due to the 

completion of project construction and commissioning and repayment of project debt, 

calculation of IRR becomes irrelevant. 

21.9.4 Sensitivity Study and Risk Analysis 

Sensitivity analysis has been applied to the base case cash flow by varying the following 

parameters: 

• Nickel price,  

• Nickel grade,  

• Operating costs,  

• Currency exchange rate.  

 

Figure 33, Figure 34, and Figure 35 present the NPV sensitivities at various discount rates 

compared to the base case. All figures present project NPV sensitivity as the base used in the 

feasibility report is varied positively or negatively from -20% to +20%.  The NPV is most sensitive 

to changes in nickel price, nickel feed grade, and the US$ to CAD$ currency exchange rate and 

least sensitive to changes in operating costs.
