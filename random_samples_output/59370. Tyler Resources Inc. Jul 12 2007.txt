EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The 6,488 ha Bahuerachi Project located in Chihuahua State, Mexico has been explored 
intermittently by Tyler Resources Inc. since 1993 when it was first acquired as a near-surface 
copper oxide deposit. Tyler is the sole owner of the property. 
 
Tyler Resources Inc. has retained Associated Geosciences Ltd. (AGL) to complete an updated 
independent mineral resource estimate on the property and consequent technical report as 
required by National Instrument 43-101. 
 
On May 23, 2007 (filed on SEDAR) Tyler Resources Inc. released a resource estimate for 
Bahuerachi Deposit prepared by Associated Geosciences Ltd. The public disclosure of a 
resource estimate on a material property where there has been >100% change from a previously 
reported mineral resource estimate triggers a requirement within National Instrument 43-101 to 
complete and file an independent technical report in support of the resource estimate within 45 
days.  
 
A summary of the Bahuerachi Deposit resource estimate which forms the subject of this report 
follows:

The formula used to estimate the copper equivalent cut-offs and copper and copper-zinc 
equivalent grades for the Bahuerachi Deposit is as follows: 
 

CuZnEq(%)=((((Cu%x10xLb_KgxPrice_CuxRec_Cu)+(Mo%x10xLb_KgxPrice_MoxRe
c_Mo)+(Zn%x10xLb_KgxPrice_MoxRec_Zn)+(Au_g/txPrice_Au/Oz-
gxRec_Au)+(Ag_g/txPrice_Ag/Oz-gxRec_Ag))/Price_Cu)/(Lb_Kg x 10)) 

 
The formula incorporates the five principal elements of economic interest; copper, 
molybdenum, gold, silver and zinc. The formula does not incorporate recoveries (ie assumes a 
100% recovery of all metals) and is based on pricing assumptions which reflect a reasonable 
net-back price at the mine gate at current metal values.

The determination of metal equivalents may vary between companies and AGL has uses the 
following pricing assumptions: 
 

Pricing Assumptions In the Copper 
Equivalent Calculation 

Metal Commodity Prices 
Copper (Cu) US$1.50/lb 

Molybdenum (Mo) US$15.00/lb 
Gold (Au) US$550/oz 

Silver (Ag) US$10/oz 
Zinc (Zn) US$0.80/lb 

 
During the preparation of this report a number of errors were identified in the copper equivalent 
formula including an incorrect conversion factor where a conversion of kilogram to pounds 
(Troy) was used instead of pounds (Avoir), an incomplete term in the denominator and the 
misplacement of a bracket. The impact of the error affected the contribution of metal values to 
the copper equivalent grade. 
 
Subsequent to the May 23, 2007 press-release, at the request of Tyler, a number of changes 
were made to make the resource estimate more useful to the on-going scoping study. Gold was 
added to the calculation of copper equivalent at a price of US$550/oz. The price of silver was 
increased from US$7/oz to US$10/oz and the price of molybdenum increased form US$10/lb to 
US$15/lb. As well a copper-zinc equivalent grade was calculated for each copper and copper 
equivalent cut-off using a price of US$0.80/lb. 
 
The formula was subsequently corrected and the mineral resources presented in this report have 
been updated to reflect the corrected formula and the requested changes.  
 
Where a final mineral resource estimate supported by a technical report differs from a 
previously disclosed estimate, NI 43-101 requires that the two estimates be reconciled.  
 
While the overall tonnes and grade at any copper only cut-off remained the same the revised 
numbers reflect a lower copper equivalent grade at any particular copper cut-off value.  
 
AGL recommends that Tyler Resources continues to advance the scoping study currently 
underway. 
 
The proposed budget of C$ is reasonable and warranted. 
 
This report was prepared under the direction of Keit h McCandlish, P.Geol., Vice President & 
General Manager, Associated Geosciences Ltd. ("AGL").  
 
The effective date of this report is July 09, 2007.

Updated Resource Estimate:  Project No.: 2007CM10 Final Report  
Tyler Resources Inc. Bahuerachi Property,  
Chihuahua St ate, Mexico 
   

Prepared for: Tyler Resources Inc.  1 
 

 
  Effective Date: July 9, 2007 

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
The 6,488 ha Bahuerachi Deposit located in Chihuahua State, Mexico has been explored 
intermittently by Tyler Resources Inc. since 1993 when it was first acquired for its potential as a 
near-surface copper-oxide deposit. Tyler is the sole owner of the claims which constitute the 
Bahuerachi property through its wholly owned Mexican subsidiary Recursos Tyler S.A. De C.V. 
 
Associated Geosciences Ltd. (AGL) has been retained by Tyler Resources Inc. to provide 
geological consulting expertise to the  the Bahuerachi Project. This technical report supports an 
updated mineral resource estimate for the Bahuerachi Deposit. This was disclosed by Tyler 
Resources Inc. on May 23, 2007. 
 
The project is comprised of a mineralized (Cu-Au-Mo +/- Ag, Zn, Pb) calc-alkaline porphyry-
skarn complex of Laramide age, intruding Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary strata. The main 
zone is composed of three related porphyry lobes, the Main Zone porphyry, South/Goat porphyry 
and the North porphyry lobe. The total strike length of the mineralized porphyry complex is 
approximately 4 km with widths ranging between less than 100 m to in excess of 500 m. 
 
A number of other mineralized occurrences have also been identified on the property and consist 
of additional skarn targets (North Skarn); other base and precious metal mineralized skarns with 
mesothermal quartz veining overprint (San Juan, San Marcos, Cuesta Colorada) as well as distal 
epithermal style systems (Los Alisos). 
 
The public disclosure of a resource estimate on a material property where there has been >100% 
change from a previously reported mineral resource estimate triggers a requirement within 
National Instrument 43-101 to complete and file an independent technical report in support of the 
resource estimate within 45 days. 
 
The current technical report was prepared to conform to the requirements of the National 
Instrument 43-101 and the TSX Venture Exchange for an independent report supporting the 
issuance of a new mineral resource estimate on a material property.    
 
During the preparation of this report a number of errors were identified in the copper equivalent 
formula which affected the contribution of metal values to the copper equivalent grade. The 
mineral resources presented in this report have been updated to reflect the corrected formula. 
 
1.1 Reliance on Other Experts 
 
Numerous authors have contributed to the preparation of this technical report including staff 
from Tyler Resources Inc. and Associated Geosciences Ltd.

2003. The data relating to these programs was summarized in a technical report prepared by 
Associated Mining Consultants Ltd. dated November 27, 2003 entitled: 
 

Technical Report and Summary Valuation of the Tyler Resources 
Inc. Bahuerachi Property Chihuahua State, Mexico 

 
Programs since 2003 consisted of a Phase 1 drill program consisting of 12 short diamond drill 
holes totaling 1,084 m in April to June of 2004, subsequently followed by a larger Phase 2 
program of combined core and reverse circulation drilling which started in September 2004 and 
continues to this day with in excess of 42,000 m drilled in an additional 200+ holes. 
 
In November 2006, Associated Geosciences Ltd. completed a mineral resource estimate for the 
Bahuerachi Deposit.  The results are summarized in a report entitled "Resource Estimate: Tyler 
Resource Inc., Bahuerachi Deposit, Chihuahua State, Mexico." 
 
1.3 Disclaimers

2.0  PROPERTY LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION 
 
2.1 Property Location 
 
Bahuerachi lies in southwestern Chihuahua State, Mexico, about 5 km northeast of the Sinaloa 
state boundary (Figure 2.1). The closest town is La Reforma, Sinaloa, located some 8 km to the 
south. A small village of less than 100 inhabitants (Bahuerachi) is located on the western portion 
of the permit area. The property is also located some 25 km west of the El Sauzal gold mine 
owned by Glamis Gold Ltd. 
 
2.2 Property Description 
 
The Property presently consists of six mining concessions totaling 6,488 ha as follows: 
 
Table 2.1: Bahuerachi Concessions 

Concession Title Number Area (ha) Date Issued Expiry Type 
Bahuerachi T 211781 500 2000 July 2050 Exploitation 
Bahuerachi Dos T 215572 2,788 2002 March 2052 Exploitation 
Bahuerachi Tres T 215511 30 2002 February 2008 Exploration 
Bahuerachi Cuatro T 226593 1,237.54 2006 February 2056 Exploitation 
Bahuerachi Cinco T 225440 1,938.89 2005 September 2011 Exploration 
Bahuerachi Seis  T 226595 300 2006 February 2056 Exploitation 

 
The original Bahuerachi property was acquired by Tyler Resources Inc. on behalf of a Joint-
Venture between Tyler and Golden Rule Resources Inc. (subsequently CDG Investments Inc.) in 
1994 from a Mexican national, Ing. Luis Palafox. The Bahuerachi Dos property was acquired by 
staking by the joint-venture in 1995 and the Bahuerachi Tres concession was staked in 2002 
(Figure 2.2). The Bahuerachi Cuatro, Cinco and Seis were subsequently acquired by staking in 
2005 and 2006 
 
The original two concessions were the subject of an earn-in option agreement whereby 
Tyler/CDG could earn up to a 95% working interest by expending US$2,000,000 in exploration. 
Upon earning a 95% working interest in the claims, the Joint-Venture then had the option to 
convert the underlying property vendors 5% residual interest to a 10% net profits interest (NPI), 
which could be purchased for $500,000.  
 
In 2003, Tyler Resources consolidated title of the property by purchasing the CDG interest in the 
Joint-Venture for 13,336,000 shares of Tyler Resources at a deemed value of CDN$0.06. 
 
The 1998 formal Agreement recognized that the joint venture had earned an 83.39% interest into 
the claims and contemplated that the joint-venture would earn 1% of the 16.61% interest still 
held by the original property owner for every further US$100,000 spent on exploration for a 
period of five years. The five year period was further extended in 2003 by three additional years, 
to October 2006, with an increase of the purchase price for the 10% NPI from $500,000 to 
$700,000. Exploration expenditures since signing of the 1998 Agreement have totaled well in

excess of $10 million, allowing for the completion of Tyler's earn- in requirements into the 
Bahuerachi 1 and 2 titles. 
 
In October of 2006, Tyler Resources elected to convert the underlying property vendor to a 10% 
NPI and purchased the royalty, extinguishing all further obligations to third parties and acquiring 
ownership and title to 100% of the Bahuerachi 1 and 2 claims, while maintaining 100% 
ownwership of the Bahuerachi 3 to 6 claims.

2.3 Summary of Mexican Mining Law 
 
The Republic of the United States of Mexico has a well established system of mineral land 
tenure. Mexican mining law is based on Article 27 of the Constitution which establishes that all 
minerals found on Mexican territory are owned by the federal repub lic. The Mining Law of 1992 
and the current Regulations (enabled in 1999) regulate or administer Article 27. All land in 
Mexico is available for claiming other than existing mining concessions or applications, areas 
reserved from mining, maritime zones and certain federally regulated areas. 
 
The term concession refers to mining lots which may be of two types. An exploration concession 
has a six year permit period while an exploitation title is valid for 50 years and renewable for one 
additional period. At any time during the term of an exploration concession the holder may apply 
for an exploitation permit. The two concession types have a different tax regime.

All concessions must be registered with the Public Registry of Mining. Title to a concession is 
evidenced through registration of the issuance. Concessions have maintenance obligations 
comprised of assessment work commitments and the payment of mining duties.  
 
Only Mexican nationals or Mexican incorporated companies (there are no restrictions on foreign 
ownership of such entities) may hold concessions. 
 
Assessment work reports must be filed in May of each year. The Mining Regulations specify the 
minimum obligations required for exploration and exploitation concessions. Mining duties are 
based on the size of the concession and the number of years held. Mining duties are payable in 
advance in January and July of each year.  
 
Concessions holders do not automatically acquire surface rights and access permission must be 
negotiated with the landowner. Tyler Resources has negotiated unrestricted surface access rights 
to all of its priority exploration targets with the local agrarian community for a period of 10 years 
(to 2016). 
 
2.4 Permits and Liabilities 
 
Annual environmental reports have been filed for the property since work began in 1996 and the 
last inspection on the property was conducted by government officials in 2006, during the 
current drilling program.  
 
The current round of exploratory and definition drilling and the building of the necessary access 
roads is be adequately covered by the existing permit ("Informe Preventivo"), the latest version 
of which was submitted and approved in 2006 for the current exploration work.  
 
Tyler is responsible for the maintenance in good standing of the claims under Mexican Mining 
Law, including all statutory filings and tax payments. Tyler currently pays annual mining duties 
of approximately $12,000 and taxes of approximately $16,500. Current expenditures are 
sufficient to address work assessment requirements through the foreseeable future.

2.5 Accessibility, Climate, Physiography, Local Resources and Infrastructure  
 
2.5.1 Accessibility 
 
Access to the property is by secondary unpaved roads from the local supply and administrative 
center of Choix, Sinaloa. Access to Choix from Highway 15, the Main Coast Highway, is via El 
Fuerte from either El Carrizo (106 km) or from Los Mochis (126 km). Commercial air service is 
available to Los Mochis. 
 
The 4-5 hour drive to Bahuerachi from Choix includes a short ferry crossing over the Rio Fuerte 
which has recently been flooded by the construction of an irrigation/hydroelectric dam. This dam 
now generates electrical power close to the property, an important consideration in terms of an 
eventual mining operation. Access to the property is possible year round through the state 
maintained all-weather gravel road linking Choix (Sinaloa) to Urique (Chihuahua). This road 
services the village of Bahuerachi located on the western edge of the permit area. Access to the 
project's main mineralized zone from the village of Bahuerachi was constructed during the Joint- 
Venture's 1996-97 drilling program and is in relatively good condition with only a few areas that

tend to wash out during the rainy season. With a minimum amount of seasonal upkeep, travel to 
the camp and the main mineralized zone is possible year round by four wheel drive vehicles. 
 
Access throughout the property is by a network of drill and access roads as well as foot/burro 
trails, including well developed trails in Arroyo Reforma and several major tributary drainages.  
 
Access to the area is also possible using an all weather road from the city of Choix to the El 
Sauzal project located roughly 25 km to the west of Bahuerachi. From El Sauzal, the road 
network connects in the regional administrative center of Cienneguita, with roads allowing 
access to Baheurachi from the North. The importance of this road is the presence of a bridge 
across Rio Fuerte with a maximum load rate of 35 t, making access to its northern shore possible 
without using the ferry services that have occasionally bottlenecked access to the project area to 
date.  
 
2.5.2 Climate and Physiography 
 
The climate on the property is typical of this area of the Sierra Madre with a dry, arid climate for 
most of the year punctuated by typically heavy rains during the period from September to 
November. The terrain is rugged to extreme, rising abruptly from main valleys at about 200 m 
ASL to peaks at 1,300 m. 
 
2.5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
A limited population base is present on and around the property which is primarily engaged in 
subsistence farming and small-scale cattle ranching. There is no local industry and people have 
been steadily leaving the area due to lack of work. 
 
The closest town, La Reforma, offers limited health services (nursing station) as well as 
phone/fax services and a poorly stocked country store selling essential supplies. Supplies such as 
food, electrical/mechanical supplies and fuel are typically sourced out of the cities of Choix, El 
Fuerte or Los Mochis where a wide range of products can be found. Supply trips to supply 
centers from the property can usually be completed in one to two days either using the southern 
or northern routes.  
 
Electrical power is not presently available on the property and the closest hydroelectric power 
generating facility is located roughly 25 km to the south west of the property, at Huites on the El 
Fuerte River. The amount of power generated at that facility and its availability are not known to 
the authors. The current power grid extends to the village of La Reforma, 8 km south of the 
property. 
 
The closest railway link to the property is located roughly 25 km to the west of the property. 
 
Water is present year round on the property in the major arroyos, such as Arroyo Reforma which 
crosses the property in a north-south direction.

A significant camp facility has been built over the years by Tyler Resources at the Main Zone. It 
is comprised of a large restored stone house with a tin roof with kitchen and eating quarters as 
well as sleeping quarters. The camp can easily accommodate up to 70 people in air conditioned 
concrete and tin roof buildings. Adequate sanitary facilities, core sawing and storage areas, 
laundry and drying facilities have also been constructed on site. Fuel storage areas with proper 
spill containment areas have been built which can accommodate up to 5,000 L of gasoline, 
10,000 L of diesel and 16,000 L of water. Electricity on site is provided by a 70 kW diesel 
generator and a 35 kW backup diesel generator. 
 
Drinking water is available either by filtering water from local arroyos or obtained from an 
artesian well which was drilled at the camp and has been tested for its use as drinking water.

3.0 PROPERTY HISTORY 
 
3.1 Exploration 
 
3.1.1 Exploration Prior to 1994 
 
The property has numerous and extensive historical workings reportedly dating back to the late 
1700's under Spanish colonial rule. Mining at that time was directed towards the extraction and 
treatment of surface and underground copper oxide ores that were treated on site with the use of 
wood-fired blast furnaces. The highest density of these surface and underground workings are 
located in what is now known as the 'Main Zone'. Grab samples of oxide mineralization from 
historical workings often grade in the 10%-30% copper range. Although it is not known if gold 
and silver were historically recovered at the property, it is noted that the highest density of 
workings occur in the southern portion of the system and where the highest precious metal 
values have been recognized at surface to date. 
 
Abundant slag from historical smelting activity is found in a number of areas on the property, 
namely at the Main Zone camp, Colome, the village of Bahuerachi itself and along Arroyo San 
Francisco, near the southern end of the Mina Mexicana zone as recognized to date. 
 
The area has reportedly first been evaluated for its potential to host a porphyry copper deposit by 
Asarco in the 1970's. At that time, Asarco reportedly drilled eight widely spaced holes, some of 
which intersected high grade copper oxide mineralization. Asarco's regional exploration efforts, 
which included work on the Santo Thomas and Piedras Verdes deposits in the area, were 
terminated at about that time. Luis Palafox, (formerly with Asarco) staked the Bahuerachi 
property in 1992 and offered it to the Joint-Venture in 1993. 
 
Although, according to available records, the property has been visited by numerous large 
companies over the years, little actual modern exploration work has been done previous to 
Tyler's programs and none of this work was conducted outside of the original showing (now the 
Main Zone). 
 
3.1.2 Exploration Since 1994 
 
Significant changes since the Joint-Venture programs began (1994) include development of road 
access, recognition of much larger mineralized systems as well as the discovery of new types and 
styles of mineralization. 
 
The initial focus of exploration by the Joint-Venture in 1994 was two-fold. Initial drilling was to 
define a small SX-EW (solvent extraction-electrowinning) near surface copper oxide resource 
within the Main Zone. Regional prospecting programs were conducted intermittently to expand 
the Main Zone as well as find additional mineralized zones. Small regional work programs were 
also undertaken over the years to evaluate multiple other showing in the area of Bahuerachi.

The discovery of the El Sauzal gold deposit some 25 km to the east of Bahuerachi in 1996 
provided the drive to evaluate mineralization of other types than the previously considered 
copper-oxide showings. Evaluation of potential for base and precious metals on the property 
since 1996 has resulted in the discovery of multiple gold and base metal occurrences that were 
previously undocumented. 
 
The 1997 drilling campaign at Bahuerachi was conducted to evaluate the near surface copper-
oxide potential of the property. In the absence of better geological controls, it was conducted on 
a theoretical 50 m centre grid to cover an area of roughly 400 m by 200 m over what was 
believed to be the core of the mineralized system. Initial holes were planned as vertical holes to 
evaluate a possible near-surface, sub-horizontal zone of copper oxide enrichment (oxide 
blanket). Although mineralization was found to be widespread, even outside the higher grade 
replacement zones, drill hole location and drilling directions did not allow for adequate testing of 
the higher grade zones or the mineralized intrusion as defined by subsequent work. Core 
recovery also reportedly averaged only 70% over the program with heavy losses in altered, 
mineralized sections as well as within intrusive sections. 
 
Plotting of the 1997 drill holes on the 2001 geological map shows that 10 of the 18 holes were 
located in the sediments and volcanics outside of the main skarns or mineralized dacitic intrusion 
(quartz- feldspar porphyry or QFP). Only two holes were collared in the high grade replacement 
skarn zones but were poorly oriented in terms of recently established geological controls. 
Regardless of this deficiency, results of the 2001 drilling include the following reported statistics 
which remain valid in the context of future exploration on the property: cumulative    166 m of 
drill intersections in the exoskarn averaged 1.17% copper with a range of 0.23%-2.34% copper, 
cumulative 111 m in altered andesites (and sediments) was found to average 0.58% copper with 
a range of 0.28%-0.86% copper and a cumulative 59.7 m of intersections of copper 
mineralization in the altered dacitic intrusion was found to grade 0.67% copper with a range of 
0.28%-1.28% copper. All of these ranges are well within the type of values expected within an 
economic porphyry style system and associated high grade skarn zones. Only in a few limited 
instances were assays for other elements (Au, Ag, Zn) carried out in 1997. 
 
Other prospecting programs conducted during this period allowed for the accumulation of local 
to regional scale data which has greatly enhanced the understanding of the mineralization and its 
potential at Bahuerachi. A greater understanding of regional stratigraphy and structure allows for 
the integration of punctual data and evaluation of overall potent ial for each occurrence. 
Numerous mineralized showings have been identified on the property outside of the Main Zone 
(Colome, Mina Mexicana, Los Alisos, Cuesta Colorada, San Juan, San Marcos) (Figure 4.1). All 
of those showings are considered genetically related to some degree.  
 
The purpose of the 2001 surface exploration program was to examine known showings with the 
objective of determining geological controls and settings for existing mineralization. Previous 
datasets from prospecting programs offered punctual data in terms of mineralized occurrences 
but without further mapping, this data could not adequately be used to outline the potential of 
any one area as true widths of mineralized systems could not be determined with reasonable

certainty. The 2001 program was successful in outlining minimum surface length and widths for 
mineralization at the Main Zone (west skarn), Mina Mexicana and Los Alisos. It also provided 
for greater understanding of the geological context and controls on the known mineralization and 
as such, created the base necessary for drilling recommendations on the property.

The Main Zone, San Juan, Colome and Cuesta Colorada are all directly (spatially) associated 
with quartz- feldspar porphyry intrusions. 
 
A short program was conducted in August of 2003 in conjunction with a number of field 
property visits with third parties. The short program centered around the partial rehabilitation of 
a historical adit which penetrated the intrusion and related skarns underneath the Main Zone for a 
significant distance. The program objectives were to collect data at depth which in conjunction 
with the 2001 surface data would allow for the generation of an interpretative cross-section 
across the system.

In January of 2004, a full spectrum (magnetics, electromagnetics and radiometrics) helicopter 
borne airborne geophysical survey with 100 m line spacing was flown to cover the main 
Bahuerachi claims where a significant porphyry/skarn complex had been identified by surface 
mapping. The results of the survey outlined a faint magnetic response over the known porphyry, 
and a number of other regional scale targets were identified that warranted follow up work. 
 
In April of 2004, a short core drilling program consisting of 12 drill holes for a total of 1,084 m 
was conducted to test for continuation at depth of mineralized porphyry and skarn units mapped 
and sampled at surface. The program successfully confirmed continuation at depths of all 
mineralized units recognized at surface over a strike length of approximately 800 m. The success 
of this program laid the basis for the expanded follow up phase II drill program whose objective 
it was to test the entire length of the known porphyry complex, as well as conduct first pass 
drilling of other targets identified by previous and ongoing work. 
 
The Phase II drill program began in September of 2004 and has been ongoing to the present. 
Over this period, sufficient data was obtained from the drilling in the Main Zone to estimate a 
mineral resource in the Main Zone. 
 
In total from September 2004 to October 21st, 2006, 71 reverse circulation drill holes were 
drilled for a total of 9,407 m and 93 diamond drill holes were completed for a total of 27,250 m. 
Drilling is currently ongoing.

4.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
4.1  Regional Geology 
 
The geology of northwestern Mexico is dominated by the Sierra Madre Occidental, a belt of 
Cretaceous to Tertiary volcanic rocks extending southeasterly from the US border for 1,400 km. 
These rocks comprise a lower (45 to 100 million year old) sequence of andesitic flows and 
pyroclastic rocks, uncomformably overlain by a distinctive, upper (27 to 34 million year old) 
ignimbrite complex. The upper complex, probably the most extensive of its type on earth, is up 
to 1 km thick. A thick sequence of Triassic-Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary rocks is exposed 
between the Pacific Coast and the western slopes of the Sierra Madre. Cretaceous and Tertiary 
intrusive rocks occur in a belt, 60 km-100 km wide, immediately inland of the coast. 
 
4.2 Property Geology 
 
At the property scale, a large range of the units previously described are exposed by the presence 
of an erosional window through the late Tertiary volcanic sequence.   
 
At the base of the sequence, the Triassic-Cretaceous age volcano-sedimentary units are well 
exposed and consist of interbedded sediments (conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones), carbonates 
and limy sediments as well as andesitic volcanic flows. Field observations where bedding 
relationships can readily be observed indicate that these units were folded although fold 
geometry and amplitude have not yet been defined. Evidence for thrusting is also present on a 
regional scale. 
 
These units are locally overlain by the Tertiary andesitic, pyroclastic and ignimbrite flows and 
are intruded by a series of intrusions ranging in composition from dioritic to rhyolitic. 
 
An important intrusive complex consisting of multiple intrusive phases ranging in composition 
from mafic (dioritic/andesitic) to felsic (rhyolitic) is present on the property. Regionally, the core 
of this complex is exposed over a north-south distance of at least 10 km by a minimum width of 
3 km although its total extent is not known at present. The best exposures of this complex occur 
along arroyo Reforma from the north end of the Property to the town of La Reforma and then 
southerly to the El Fuerte River. Most of the intrusive complex consists of fault bound (post 
emplacement faults?) dyke like bodies with a volumetrically dominant dacitic core. 
 
The main body of interest at Bahuerachi consists of a 4 km long predominantly dacitic 
mineralized porphyry intrusion of Laramide age (+/- 65.7 million years) cut by post mineral 
dykes of andesitic to rhyolitic composition which post date the mineralization. The geochemistry 
of the complex indicates a typical calc-alkaline intrusive system. Sulphide bearing garnet to 
pyroxene dominated skarn bodies are found both on the edges of and within the porphyry 
complex itself (exoskarns and endoskarns), and typically carry higher grades of copper, silver, 
gold and zinc than the associated porphyry bodies.

Current mapping and drilling data as well as preliminary evaluation of chemical/metal zoning 
over the 4 km of strike length of the complex would suggest that the larger porphyry body has 
been faulted, and that displacement along fault boundaries are exposing different emplacement 
levels or depths for the South/Goat porphyry (deepest), the Main Zone porphyry and the North 
porphyry (top of system). At this time, only the main Zone Porphyry has been drilled in 
sufficient detail to allow for a mineral resource estimate. 
 
Large scale faulting is observed on the property and some of the late faults have been intruded by 
flow-banded rhyolite dykes. Important fault systems occur in both roughly north-south and east-
west directions. Important displacement in the >100 m range can be inferred using the 
unconformity at the base of the Tertiary ignimbrite complex as a marker horizon. To  the north-
east of the property, Cretaceous carbonate units and sedimentary rocks can be seen at the same 
topographic level as tertiary ignimbrites across the valley of arroyo Cieneguita which marks a 
major north-south fault structure. This particular fault structure, which is well exposed in the dry 
creek bed, is characterized by a thick section of coarse, polymictic fault breccia. The importance 
of faulting is crucial in terms of the exploration model as creating zones of structural weakness 
and/or dilation propitious for the emplacement of magmas and subsequent mineralizing fluids.

5.0 DEPOSIT TYPE 
 
The numerous occurrences of mineralization identified to date on the property can all genetically 
be tied into an intrusion driven/hosted porphyry-style and related epithermal mineralization 
model. The genetic model used as a reference for continued exploration on the property and the 
relationships between known mineralized zones to date are illustrated in Figure 5.1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

From: Kirkham, R.V. and Sinclair, W.D., 1996. 

Figure 5.1: Geological Model Bahuerachi 
 
The Main Zone, Colome and Mina Mexicana are interpreted to be at the 'porphyry' level while 
other zones such as Cuesta Colorada, San Juan are distal to the core of the system. 
 
Within the context of this model, the Main Zone area represents a low-grade, mineralized 
porphyry core and associated base and precious metal skarn system. Colome and Mina 
Mexicana, as described below, are also considered to be representative of this type of 
mineralization.  
 
Distal base/precious metal rich skarns and mesothermal vein systems are seen at San Marcos, 
San Juan and Cuesta Colorada.

The Los Alisos gold-silver epithermal breccia system is considered a distal hydrothermal system 
related to late hydrothermal phases associated with intrusion emplacement. It is hosted within 
volcano-sedimentary rocks of Cretaceous age. Examples of economically significant gold-silver 
epithermal deposits or advanced projects in Mexico are numerous and include Reyna De Oro, 
Venturina, the Ocampo camp, Dolores and Tayoltita.   
 
Known deposits which are used as models for further exploration on the property include the 
Grasberg copper-gold deposits of West Papua, and the Bingham porphyry copper-gold and 
associated base metal skarn deposits of the south-western United States. In particular, the 
geological environments of the Grasberg and Bingham deposits have many similarities to the 
Bahuerachi district where alkalic intrusive complexes intrude folded limestone strata and are 
associated with porphyry-style and skarn related copper-gold mineralization. 
 
Even with limited development and exploration in the area, a significant amount of exploration 
and mining activity has or presently is taking place in the general area of the Bahuerachi 
Property. 
 
Past producers in the Bahuerachi area include Lluvia De Oro (Au-Ag) and La Reforma (Au-Ag-
Pb-Zn-Cu). The El Sauzal gold deposit discovered in 1995 by Francisco Gold is located 25 km 
east from the Property has been put into production by Glamis Gold Ltd. This deposit is a high 
sulphidation oxidized gold-bearing vein system hosted in volcano sedimentary rocks with a 
reported total resource base of 3.3 million ounces of gold at a 0.5 g/t gold cutoff. 
 
Both the Alcaparra system and the Santo Thomas property, located within 15 km to the south of 
Bahuerachi have previously been evaluated as potentially economic porphyry type system, 
although with limited success to date.  
 
The Lluvia De Oro mine, a past producer located less than 1 km south of the south-east corner of 
the Bahuerachi Property, has a recorded production of 100,000 t grading 95 g/t Au and 850 g/t 
Ag from structurally controlled high grade bonanza style shoots/veins and mantos in limestones. 
Remaining lower grade resources within silica replaced limestones has been reported as 1.37 Mt 
grading 1.99 g/t Au and 22.75 g/t Ag. Little to no modern exploration has been conducted on site 
since the final phase of mining in the 1950's. Lluvia De Oro is hosted in similar units as those 
seen on the Property and both the host lithologies as well as important structural features 
bounding the deposit have been observed to continue onto Bahuerachi. 
 
The La Reforma mine which was operated by Penoles until the late 1970's consisted of a 
predominantly sediment hosted massive sulphide skarn body associated with a quartz feldspar 
porphyry dyke. Reported production was 2 Mt grading 0.4 g/t Au, 91.6 g/t Ag, 0.63% Cu, 1.9% 
Pb and 7.4% Zn. The Reforma mine was located roughly 6 km to the south of the Bahuerachi 
Property. No intrusion hosted copper mineralization, stockwork or endoskarn mineralization was 
reported at La Reforma.

6.0 MINERALIZATION 
 
There are presently eight identified zones of mineralization on the property as well as a few early 
stage prospects. Each of the zones is described in greater detail below. Of these, only the Main 
Zone porphyry has seen any significant trenching work, mapping, and has had sufficient drilling 
conducted on it to reach the stage of an initial resource estimation. Widely-spaced drilling has 
been carried out at a number of the other prospects (South Porphyry, North Porphyry/Colome, 
Los Alisos, North Skarn). The limited drilling in each of the areas has identified new mineralized 
occurrences; however at this stage the targets outside of the Main Zone porphyry remain open 
and insufficient drilling has been carried out to bring the targets to the resource stage. 
 
The main porphyry complex at Bahuerachi is exposed over 4 km of strike length, with widths 
varying from tens of metres to in excess of 600 m-700 m. It is currently interpreted that the Main 
Complex itself has been structurally dismembered into three major porphyry lobes (Main Zone 
porphyry, South/Goat porphyry and North porphyry) each of which is now exposed at surface 
but represent different paleodepth levels. This working hypothesis is supported by observations 
relating to metal zoning, porphyry textures and stratigraphic relationships. Metal zoning includes 
generally higher grade molybdenum values representing deeper emplacement levels in the south, 
with copper/zinc ratios showing increasing zinc levels to the north, a typical deep to shallow 
zonation. Porphyritic rocks exhibit more holocrystallline textures in the south (deeper), coarse 
crowded porphyry in the central portion of the complex (Main Zone porphyry) and finer grained 
(shallow) phases in the north. Finally, while the porphyry stocks in the South/Goat porphyry and 
Main Zone porphyry are typical intrusions, they have been observed to sill out in flat lying sheets 
in the North porphyry. Stratigraphy, mostly the main limestone-marble marker unit and related 
high grade skarns, shows a downdropping in the 100+ metre range at the fault boundary between 
the Main Porphyry Zone and North porphyry. 
 
Exploration implications that arise from the current observation are that the South/Goat porphyry 
remains a valid target for Mo dominated Mo-Cu-Ag intrusive hosted mineralization, while the 
North porphyry may remain prospective for extensions of the Main Zone porphyry at depth. 
High grade skarns typical of the Main Zone have already been identified by drilling in the North 
porphyry area at depth.

6.1 Main Zone Porphyry (Cu-Au-Mo +/- Ag, Zn, Pb) 
 
Through the main drilled porphyry zone, several phases of porphyry have been identified. They 
are, in order of importance, 1) Coarse crowded quartz- feldspar porphyry (QFP) with an aphanitic 
matrix, 2) coarse crowded QFP with a hollocrystalline matrix, and 3) feldspar-biotte +/- 
hornblende porphyry with an aphanitic matrix. These are all cut by post-mineral rhyolite and 
andesite dikes. Coarse crowded QFP with aphanitic matrix has been identified as the best host 
for copper mineralization, with wide zones of high grade porphyry (>0.7% copper) being 
common, with grades locally in excess of 3% copper and related gold and silver. This unit 
exhibits variable potassic and phyllic alteration as well as variable quartz veining. 
Hollocrystaline QFP typically has copper grades up to at least 0.8% Cu but is generally low 
grade, with a background around 0.1%-0.2 % copper. Later feldspar-biotite porphyry phases are 
generally barren, although, locally may host quartz-chalcopyrite veins demonstrating a late 
copper pulse. These units are more completely described below. 
 
6.1.1 Intrusive Rocks 
 
6.1.1.1 Quartz Feldspar Porphyry (QFP) 
 
Rocks designated as feldspar-quartz-biotite +/- hornblende porphyry (QFP) show a considerable 
range in phenocryst abundance and size, and occur in matrixes ranging from aphanatic to 
hollocrystalline.  Four readily distinguishable phases of QFP have been mapped and recognized 
in drill core. In simplified geology maps, these phases are grouped together as the 
undifferentiated QFP complex.  
 

1. Coarse crowded QFP (>30% phenocrysts). 
2. Non crowded QFP (<30% phenocrysts). 
3. Fine grained QFP. 
4. Porphyritic to equigranular QFP with a hollocrystalline ground mass. 

 
6.1.1.2 Hornblende Porphyry 
 
This porphyry phase is similar to the normal QFP, however fine laths of hornblende can be seen 
through the unit constituting 5%-15% of the rock. This unit can locally be mineralized. 
 
6.1.1.3 Feldspar Porphyry (FP) 
 
The last significant intrusive phase in the porphyry complex consists of a quartz deficient 
feldspar porphyry unit (FP) which has not been observed to be affected by significant alteration 
and has always cut previous, mineralized porphyry units. Cross cutting relationships show it to 
be a late phase of porphyry which was emplaced after or very late with regards to the main 
mineralizing events.

6.1.1.4 Diorite 
 
Diorites are an equigranular intrusive phase with no free quartz, 40%-60% plagioclase feldspars, 
hornblende and biotite. It is typically magnetic with fine grained magnetite disseminated 
throughout. This unit has not been observed to carry mineralization, is relatively fresh and 
exhibits no alteration. It is a late phase that has been observed to cross cuts other mineralized 
units. 
 
6.1.2 Post Mineralization Dikes 
  
A number of rhyolite and andesite (younger) dykes cut the mineralized system in a generally 
north south trending corridor. Rhyolite dikes are the most abundant and are light to dark grey, 
aphanitic to locally porphyrytic, and typically exhibit intrusive flow banding. They have been 
observed in the district to cut and intrude the base of the tertiary Upper Volcanic sequence. They 
contain phenocrysts of feldspar (typically K-feldspar)â€“quartz-biotite-hornblende and, locally 
may contain minor magnetite. These are cut by andesite dikes which are fine to medium grained 
with textures ranging from aphanitic to porhyritic and light to dark gray or green in color. A less 
abundant generation of fine grained quartz eye â€“ biotite- feldspar rhyolite dikes are interpreted to 
be the youngest dikes, and are locally cut by andesite dikes. 
 
The post mineral dykes are typically barren, however, in the near surface oxidation profile, 
copper oxides were deposited within the dykes in the form of tennorite, malachite and azurite.   
 
There are abundant post mineral dikes throughout the east part of the property, including through 
the Colome and San Juan-San Marcos prospects and the east side of the main QFP and porphyry 
copper zone. While these dikes may represent a significant amount of dilution in some areas they 
do not affect a large portion of the Main Zone, especially along the west side of the mineralized 
complex. 
 
6.1.3 Skarns. 
 
Generally high-grade skarns have been observed and intersected in drilling crossing three major 
lithological units.  Endoskarns, which are typically garnet rich, form both as sheets within zones 
of brecciation in the porphyry as well as discontinuous pods. Exoskarns are typically well 
developed in either the limestone/marble units, in which case they tend to be garnet dominated, 
very high grade and restricted to zones tens of metres thick along the contact of the limestone 
and porphyry, or can be seen to be developed in the calc-silicate sedimentary package underlying 
the limestone units, in which case they tend to be dominated by pyroxene with minor garnets. 
Skarn development tends to be less restricted in the calc-silicate units, however grades in this 
skarn type tend to be somewhat lower than in the garnet dominated skarns. 
 
All skarn units are cut by abundant anhydrite flooding and veining, with anhydrite constituting 
anywhere from a few percent to locally in excess of 30% of the skarn groundmass.

6.1.4 Sheeted Quartz Veins and Mineralized Intrusion 
 
Disseminated sulphide mineralization (chalcopyrite, molybdenite and minor bornite) can locally 
be observed in the Main Zone porphyry, however the majority of the mineralization is related to 
a number of sulphide bearing quartz vein stockworks and locally quartz poor and sulphide rich 
stockworks. A number of these stockwork types have been recognized in mapping and in drill 
core and are described in rough chronological order below. While cross cutting relationships 
between these vein types usually hold, some overlaps indicate complex emplacement and 
overlapping of the different mineralizing pulses. In a general sense, the following events 
representing mineralized pulses can be observed: 
 

1. Disseminated pyrite-chalcopyrite-molybdenite in porphyry groundmass. 
2. Pyrite-chalcopyrite bearing quartz veins. 
3. Quartz, chalcopyrite-molybdenite, minor pyrite stockworks. 
4. Sheeted quartz veins with molybdenite and minor chalcopyrite. 
5. Sulphide bearing (chalcopyrite) stockworks and silica flooding. 
6. Chlorite (replacing fine grained biotite) dominated breccia pipes crosscutting all 

previous units and mineralized stockworks. 
7. Molybdenite sulphide stockwork, cutting late breccias. 

 
Anhydrite veining and locally flooding events appear to have been reoccurring at different 
phases of the mineralizing pulses. 
 
Alteration varies in intensity from strongly potassic in the core of the system (development of 
secondary orthoclase and biotite, anhydrite flooding) commonly overprinted by a later phyllic 
alteration phase, to an extensive propyllitic halo dominated by pyrite, silicification, epidote and 
minor sericite. Due to post mineral faulting, proximal and distal alterations are often juxtaposed 
without transition across fault boundaries. Other alteration minerals seen at some of the transition 
phases include magnetite, chlorite and tourmaline. 
 
6.1.5 Mineralized Sediments. 
 
The host volcano-sedimentary sequence is locally known to carry significant grades of copper 
mineralization to a distance of up to 250 m away from the main mineralized porphyry complex 
in the Main Zone. At surface, this is mostly seen as networks of millimeter to centimeter sized 
chrysocolla/azurite filled fractures in altered medium to fine grained sediments and volcanic 
rocks (andesites). Mineralized sheeted quartz veins are common in both the footwall and 
hangingwall sedimentary package to the main zone porphyry, with veining density varying from 
a few veins per metre to in excess of 100+ veins per metre.  Deep weathering is common in the 
sedimentary units, resulting in a locally well developed leach cap underlain by a copper oxide 
rich profile which transitions into a chalcocite blanket which varies in thickness from a few 
metres to in excess of 100 m.

6.2 South Porphyry Lobe/Mina Mexicana (Cu-Au) 
 
The South Zone porphyry contains a large variety of intrus ive phases. In addition to the property 
wide rhyolite and andesite dikes, the South Zone also contains several phases of QFP, a 
porphyritic hornblende-feldspar phase, and equigranular diorite. The intrusive complex in the 
south is roughly 1.3 km in strike length with widths ranging between 200 to 500 m. 
 
While the typical coarse crowded porphyry which is volumetrically dominant in the Main Zone 
porphyry has been observed at surface and intersected in drilling in the southern area, the 
dominant porphyry phase is holocrystalline and generally coarser grained in nature. Mineralized 
quartz vein stockworks cut both the crowded and holocrystalline QFP. Significant skarn 
development has been identified in the South Porphyry in the area known as Mina Mexicana. 
 
A total of 14 combined reverse circulation and diamond drill holes have been drilled in the 
southern porphyry and Mina Mexican System, confirming the presence of widespread Cu-Mo-
Ag mineralization which will require follow up drilling. 
 
The most significant drill intersections to date in the South/Goat porphyry include 59 m grading 
0.41% copper, 6.3 g/t silver and 0.007% molybdenum (DDH BAH-72) and 39.8 m grading 
0.36% copper, 0.03 g/t gold, 2.7 g/t silver and 0.007% molybdenum (DDH BAH-70) in porphyry 
and 117.3 m grading 0.31% copper, 0.02 g/t gold and 4.2 g/t silver in skarn dominated 
mineralization at Mina Mexicana (DDH BAH-34). 
 
6.3 North Porphyry Lobe/Colome (Cu-Au) 
 
The North pophyry lobe is an extensive zone of porphyry emplacement occurring as stocks, 
dykes and sills. It is currently interpreted that the North porphyry area represents a faulted and 
downdropped northwards extension of the Main Zone porphyry. Near surface, low grade copper 
dominated mineralization has been outlined in porphyry and veined sediments by wide spaced 
shallow drilling, and current drilling is currently focused on targeting the high grade mineralized 
skarn units at depth which correlate well with known skarns from the Main Zone porphyry. 
Alteration is generally stronger surrounding the high grade skarn units with well in excess of 
100-150 + metres of strong calc-silicate development in the sediments and weakly mineralized 
skarning developed around the target high grade mineralized skarn units. 
 
The North porphyry lobe covers an area of roughly 2.3 km in strike length, with widths ranging 
from 200 m - 700 m. 
 
The northern limit of the North pophyry zone is an area where the porphyry bodies are in contact 
with a thick limestone unit, forming sporadically mineralized skarns over a strike length in 
excess of 1.2 km (Colome area). To date, the skarn units have been found to contain various 
amounts of locally high grade copper, zinc, gold and silver mineralization. The mineralization to 
date has generally been of a discontinuous nature.

Approximately 21 drill holes (core and RC) totaling in excess of 6,000 m have been drilled in the 
North Porphyry Zone, with the most significant intersections including 121.6 m grading 0.5% 
copper, 6.1 g/t silver and 0.008% molybdenum (DDH BAH-90) and 59.15 m grading 0.59% 
copper, 9.2 g/t silver and 0.87% zinc in skarn (DDH BAH-96).  
 
6.4 Los Alisos (Au-Ag) 
 
The Los Alisos area is located some 1,200 m to the west of the Main Zone and topographically 
higher by roughly 300 m. The core of the mineralized zone as it is known to date is located some 
100 m from the access road to the Main Zone, and is now accessible by drill access roads leading 
up to the mineralized area.   
 
The Los Alisos system consists of a broad epithermal quartz stockwork-breccia zone hosted in 
sediments and andesitic volcanic/volcaniclastic rocks. The core zone of strong 
brecciation/veining/silicification has been mapped over 150 m in length by 60 m in width. A 
broader area of alteration and mineralization roughly 500 m in length by 150 m in width has 
been outlined around the core zone.  
 
Previous surface sampling across a  representative section returned a composite value of 3.15 g/t 
gold and 19 g/t silver across a minimum interpreted true width of 21 m. Historical grab samples 
in this area have returned grades of up to 7.2 g/t gold, 200 g/t silver, 10.70% zinc and 10% lead.   
 
Reverse circulation drill holes 05-RC-8 to 11 were drilled to do a first pass testing of the Los 
Alisos epithermal system. The following intersections confirmed the mineralized nature of the 
zone.

Drill holes RC 8 to 11 were drilled on two fences located 50 m apart and trending across the 
main veins as mapped at surface. All holes intersected strong quartz vein and veinlet stockwork 
zone alteration. The zone of stockworking, which contains anomalous to low grade silver and 
gold mineralization was identified over 50 m in strike length, across approximately 30 m in 
width and to a maximum tested depth of 65 m. Holes RC 8 and 9 intersected high-grade 
mineralization related to quartz vein emplacement in a coarse grained, altered porphyritic 
volcanic rock. Holes RC 8 and 9 intersected high grade bonanza style mineralization whereas 
Holes RC 10 and 11 intersected weakly mineralized zones.

Los Alisos represents the discovery of a new style of mineralization at Bahuerachi and illustrates 
the target rich environment of the property. Further work will be planned to follow up on this 
discovery, including trenching and diamond drilling as the Main Zone exploration schedule 
allows. 
 
6.5 San Juan (Ag, Pb, Zn) 
 
Data from the San Juan prospect previous to 2003 was summarized in a previous report. New 
data for work conducted since 2003 is presented here. 
  
The San Juan prospect contains an old adit and a few small working. Mineralization consists of 
centimeter size blebs and disseminations of galena and sphalerite with traces of chalcopyrite, and 
occurs in carbonate-quartz-calc silicate-sulfide veins, calc-silicate altered marble, and coarse 
bleached marble adjacent to a porphyry contact. The known zone with sulfides has been traced 
over a 50 m long by 25 m wide area and the zone is open to the southwest and along the intrusive 
contact to the east and west. 
 
The zone contains 4 or 5 high grade 'veins' composed of coarse crystals of calcite and fine 
grained pale green calcite, minor pale green pyroxene, and minor green fibrous-radiating 
vesuvianite or pyroxene, and 5%-15% blebs and clots 1 cm-15 cm in size of galena and 
sphalerite. These veins trend 155Âº to 161Â° and dip steeply to the west. Surrounding these veins, 
disseminated galena and sphalerite occur in dense fine grained calc-silicate altered rock and 
coarse bleached marble. This lower grade halo has been traced continuously for over a width of 
12 m and it is inferred to be at least 25 m wide. 
 
In 2001 nine grab samples were taken from within the adit and from the dump in front of the 
adit. These samples show the mineralization is dominated by high Pb (>5%) and Zn (0.5 to 
>5%), moderate Ag (13 to 151 g/t), and elevated Au (trace to 0.2 g/t) and Cd (trace to >0.1%). 
 
In September 2006 representative chip samples have been taken across and slightly oblique to 
the zone. One set was taken in the adit, roughly perpendicular to the main vein and returned 
2.3% Pb, 1.5% Zn, 17.2 g/t Ag, and 0.03 g/t Au over 10 m (samples 645963 to 67). A 2.1 m chip 
samples across the main vein contained 11.6% Pb, 0.5% Zn, 57.9 g/t Ag, and 0.07 g/t Au 
(sample 645968). A second set of chip samples was taken along a small cliff southwest of the 
adit and returned 0.86% Pb, 0.73% Zn, and 4.8 g/t Ag over 12 m. Chip sample locations are 
shown on Figure 6.2, and the results are presented in Table 6.3. The preliminary assessment of 
the zone indicates there is an area at least 50 m long by 25 m wide with low grade Pb and Zn 
mineralization, around 0.8 to 2.3% Pb and 0.7 to 1.5% Zn, centered on a narrow, roughly 2 m 
wide, higher grade core with up to 11% Pb, 3% Zn, and 58 g/t Ag. 
  
The area has potential for more San Juan style mineralization. A modest dipping limestone unit 
wraps around the steeply dipping topography in the area and has been traced discontinuously all 
the way from San Juan to near the San Marcos showing (roughly 1700 m). Much of the 
limestone bed has been altered to fine grained light green 'calc-silicate rock' plus quartz and

locally fine grained garnet and diopside (epidote, actinolite, quartz, calcite, vesuvianite). 
Numerous areas with minor galena-chalcopyrite and sphalerite have been seen along the zone. 
Several dikes and bodies of QFP occur adjacent to the favorable bed creating a geologic setting 
similar to that at San Juan.

6.6 San Marcos (Cu, Au, Ag, Zn, Pb) 
 
Data from the San Marcos prospect prior to 2003 was summarized in a previous report. New data 
for work conducted since 2003 is presented here. 
 
The San Marcos prospect is located in the south east part of the property and host at least two 
historic adits and other minor workings. Exposure in the area is poor and very little prospecting 
has been done outside the main workings. Past workings are focused along a gently dipping 
quartz-carbonate-sulfide vein. The Upper Adits contain two openings connecting to a roughly    
10 m by 18 m oval shaped room with a few short irregular workings off of it. The Lower Adit 
follows the main quartz vein and is about 35 m long.

blebs within the quartz-carbonate vein in the Lower Adit. 
 
 
In September 2006 the zone was sketch mapped and 20 chips samples were taken (Fig. 6.4, 6.5). 
Several chip samples were taken across the main quartz veins and samples were taken in the 
surrounding calc-silicate altered rocks which contain minor quartz veins, sulfides, and locally 
Cu-oxides. Sampling was designed to determine the average grade of the high-grade vein as well 
as grades in the adjacent wall rocks to help evaluate the width potential of the zone.

 Figure 6.5:  Sketch map of the San Marcos workings showing geology and chip 

sample locations. 
 
The main quartz-carbonate vein at San Marcos is 2 m to 4 m wide, strikes roughly east west 
(between 76Âº-110Âº) and dips to the north at 48Âº-60Âº. The vein has been traced for 80 m along 
strike and is lost under cover at both ends. The vein is exposed over a vertical extent of 50 m and 
is open at depth. The vein is composed mostly of white to clear sugary quartz with patchy calcite 
and about 2%-8% chalcopyrite-pyrite-specularite-galena occurring as 1 cm-5 cm blebs within 
quartz-carbonate. The margins of the vein are locally brecciated with angular to sub angular 
wallrock clasts cemented in a quartz-carbonate matrix. A second north to northwest trending 
(160Âº), steeply dipping vein intersects the main vein in the Upper Adit. This vein is 80 cm wide 
and contains blebs of galena and chalcopyrite. Patchy small irregular quartz veins occur in the 
rocks surrounding the main veins. Seven chip samples were collected from the main vein, 
ranging from 1.3 m-4 m in length (samples 645925, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 43). The seven samples 
average 1.7% Cu (range 0.6%-3.2%), 0.43% Pb (range 0.01%-2.79%), 0.07% Zn, (range 0.02 to 
0.14%), 79.6 g/t Ag, (range 17.7 to 208 g/t), and 0.12 g/t Au (range 0.008 to 0.67 g/t). Additional 
chip samples from a relatively complex area at the Upper adit where two or more veins intersect 
contain 0.05%-3.2% Cu, 0.01%-0.8% Pb, 21 g/t-477 g/t Ag, and 0.01 g/t-0.07 g/t Au (samples 
645924, 30, 32, 35). 
 
Wallrocks surrounding the veins are green to multicolored calc-silicate to fine grain skarn. They 
appear to be composed mostly of epidote, garnet, pyroxene and salmon colored feldspar(?). The

protolith is uncertain. Chip sampling of wallrocks immediately north of the main vein near the 
upper adit returned an average of 0.8% Cu, 0.2% Pb, 223 g/t Ag, and 0.03 g/t Au over 8 m 
(samples 645927, 28, 29, 31). A 2 m chip sample of wallrock just south of the upper adit 
returned 1.5% Cu, 0.2% Pb, 0.1% Zn, 8.8 g/t Ag, and 0.01 g/t Au (sample 645926). In this area 
significant mineralization occurs over a width of at least 20 m and is open. At the lower adit 
wallrocks to the north of the vein average 0.1% Cu, 7.6 g/t Ag, and 0.01 g/t Au over 6 m 
(samples 645940, 41, 42) and a 1.5 chip sample south of the vein contained 1.2% Cu and 0.2% 
Zn.  
 
Chip sampling results confirm the relatively high grade nature of the main vein at San Marcos 
and also demonstrate good potential for larger zones of mineralization surrounding the main 
vein. The presence of high silver content in the main vein and in the rocks surrounding the vein 
is significant. 
 
The San Marcos veins cut calc-silicate alteration, and therefore post date it. The relationship, if 
any, to calc-silicate or skarn formation is unknown and the origin of the veins is uncertain. The 
veins do not contain epithermal textures and it is suspected that they are deeper and higher 
temperature than epithermal veins. The veins share some common characteristics with some of 
the quartz-carbonate-sulfide veins in the Butte district, Montana, which are thought to have 
formed at relatively deep levels peripheral to or above a porphyry-Cu related hydrothermal 
system.

6.7 Cuesta Colorada (Cu, Au, Ag, Zn, Pb) 
 
Data from the Cuesta Colorada prospect previous to 2003 was summarized in a previous report.  
New data for work conducted since 2003 is presented here. 
 
Cuesta Colorada is located in the south part of the property adjacent to a large prominent knob of 
gray limestone. Only one small adit is known in the area and very little exploration work has 
been conducted. 
 
Along a saddle on the north side of the limestone knob beds of limestone, skarn, with minor 
sandstone and conglomerate are exposed. The beds strike 110Â° to 155Â° and dip 25Â° to 32Â° to the 
northeast. Minor mineralization occurs at the upper contact of the main limestone bed, where 
massive limestone is interbedded with sandstone and conglomerate, then gives way upsection to 
a thick sequence of conglomerate-sandstone-silt or mudstone. Skarn to fine grained calc-silicate 
alteration has partially replaced limestone beds, and silicification and calc-silicate minerals 
locally occur in the matrix of quartz rich sandstones and conglomerates. Individual skarn beds 
are 10 cm to about 1 m thick, and most outcrops contain about 30% skarn beds and 70% 
limestone or sandstone beds. Pale green fine grained pyroxene, epidote, fine grained garnet, 
quartz, and locally pyrite, galena, and chalcopyrite have been identified in the skarn beds. Many 
of the skarn beds contain minor green Cu-oxide stains. Silicification and quartz veins are notable 
in the sandstone and conglomerate and in marble on the east side of the saddle. 
  
An adit occurs 100 m northeast of the saddle and contains a 10 cm-20 cm wide E-W trending 
quartz vein plus minor zones of silicification and patchy zones of weathered Fe, Cu, and Zn 
oxides with minor pale green pyroxene skarn. Malachite, azurite, smithsonite, chalcopyrite, and 
galena have been identified at the adit. The quartz vein consists of white to clear granular quartz 
with euhedral quartz crystals and possibly contained about 5%-10% sulfides prior to weathering. 
Quartz veining is relatively abundant in the limestone adjacent to the adit, and a 2 m wide vein 
which strikes 170Â° and dips 78Â° east is exposed 40 m south of the adit. The quartz veins have 
similar sugary textures and sulfide mineralogy as the veins at San Marco, although they contain 
more abundant euhedral quartz crystals and open space vugs.   
 
A feldspar-biotite-hornblende-quartz porphyry is exposed 75 m east of the adit. The porphyry is 
chlorite altered and no veins were observed. The extent of the porphyry has not been determined. 
 
Eight chip samples were taken across variably skarned limestone or sandstone-conglomerate 
bearing outcrop in the Saddle area, 4 samples were taken in the adit, and one chip sample was 
taken from the quartz vein south of the adit. The eight samples from the saddle area contained 
0.1%-3% Zn, trace to 0.4% Cu, 2 g/t-162 g/t Ag, and trace to 0.2 g/t Au (samples 645944 to 51). 
These samples were taken over a 75. Sampling within the small adit contained a length weighted 
average of 4.7% Zn, 0.91% Pb, 0.37% Cu, 61.5 g/t Ag, and 0.16 g/ t Au over 5.5 m (samples 
645952, 53, 54). A composite grab from a 30 cm wide quartz vein in the adit returned 1.55 g/t 
Au, 98 g/t Ag, 1.4% Pb, 0.15% Zn, and 0.08% Cu (samples 645955). A 2 m wide quartz vein 
located 40 m south of the adit returned 0.34 g/t Au, 51.4 g/t Ag, 0.14% Cu, 0.22% Pb, and 0.47% 
Zn over 1.5 m (sample 645956).

 Figure 6.7: Sketch map of the Cuesta Colorada propect showing simplified geology 

and sample locations.  
 
A prominent and very linear limestone cliff on the east side of Cuesta Colorada is likely a fault 
scarp. Exposure is very limited around this suspected fault, but steeply dipping NNW trending 
fractures are abundant in the limestone along the scarp. Limited outcrop suggests there is 
limestone to the west of the fault and porphyry to the east. Skarning and quartz veining appear to 
increase to the east, and the limestone becomes bleached and marbleized to the east, indicating a 
heat source on the east side. Although no large zones of potentially economic mineralization are 
currently exposed at Cuesta Colorada the zone around the adit is poorly exposed and has seen 
very little exploration work. The covered limestone-porphyry contact adjacent to the adit is

6.8 North Skarn Area 
 
Massive skarn zones, related to an extensive copper- in-soil anomaly, were identified over an area 
of roughly 500 m by 800 m in the north central part of the property. Topography reveals massive 
skarn replacement formations over 240 m vertically. Other skarn zones are known in the area and 
mapping is ongoing to tie in the known skarn outcrops with other showings over a target area in 
excess of 1 km by 1 km. 
 
Results from first pass drilling at the North Skarn confirmed that the target hosts locally 
significant copper mineralization, including 19.5 m grading 0.57% copper, as well as locally 
elevated values of silver, gold and molybdenum. These findings are consistent with the 
identification of a new mineralized center distinct from the Main Zone where the bulk of the 
drilling has been conducted to date.

True widths are interpreted to be 90-100% of intervals as quoted. 
 
The North Skarn occurrence represents a large scale target with significant amounts of metal 
transport, recrystallization and replacement of local hosts rocks. Further work in this area 
consists of regional reinterpretation of surface and drill data, as well as additional surface 
mapping and sampling. The skarn itself may be caused by the presence of a new unexposed 
porphyry system as a driver to the skarn formation, as is seen in the Main Zone to the south east. 
 
6.9 Other Showings 
 
Numerous other mineralized showings, both of skarn type copper/zinc, mesothermal style veins 
and hydrothermal gold-silver dominated mineralization have been summarily sampled on the 
property. Surface work continues in these areas as the Company expands its efforts to bring 
forward other sizeable exploration targets to the drill stage.  
 
Mineral occurrences identitfied to date are consistent with the typical distribution and zoning of 
mineralization in a classical porphyry district with the more volatile elements (zinc, silver, gold) 
being deposited in intermediate to distal settings around the main porphyry system which acts as 
a regional heat source for the introduction and remobilization of metals on a regional basis.

7.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 

7.1 2001 Sampling 
 
Sampling during the 2001 program was conducted within the Main Zone as representative, 
continuous chip samples in 11 sections. Grab samples have been treated as point data which do 
not allow for true width/grade determinations. 
 
Four sections within the Main Zone were partially re-sampled in duplicate during 2001 with one 
set of samples collected by a third party consultant who maintained custody of samples during 
the program. Comparison analysis of the assay results by Associated Mining Consultants Ltd. 
confirms that sampling methodology was adequate during the program and that sample results 
were reliable. 
 
Estimates of minimum interpreted true widths for continuous chip sample sections was made by 
consensus by the three geologists involved on the project and have taken into account the 
following factors: geology, topography, geological controls on mineralization and degree of 
exposure along particula r sections. 
 
Sample security and integrity during the field program and subsequent transport of samples to 
the ALS-Chemex lab facilities to Hermosillo was insured through the use of individually 
numbered, tamper proof plastic tags. No issues of tampering or missing tags were reported by the 
Hermosillo lab upon receipt of the samples from the field and samples were in the custody of 
Tyler personnel at all times before delivery to ALS-Chemex. 
 
7.2 2003 Underground Sampling 
 
Underground channel/chip samples were collected by staff from Mineras Cascabel S.A. de C.V. 
(a consulting/exploration services group based in Hermosillo, Mexico) and Tyler Resources Inc. 
Keith McCandlish, P.Geol. was present during the sample collection phase. 
 
Approximately 280 m of adit was cleaned by the removal of bat guano (dry bat guano may be a 
significant health risk due to the presence of the histoplasmosis parasite) and permitting dammed 
water to freely exit. One wall of the adit was cleaned of all secondary oxide mineralization to 
expose a fresh face. The secondary oxides are clear evidence of continued leaching of copper and 
zinc minerals from the host rock.  
 
Continuous chip samples ranging in length between 1 m-2 m were chiseled by hand from the 
freshly exposed wall and collected in a sample rig placed directly under the sample interval. The 
hard nature of the host material precluded this being considered as a true channel sample, 
however, in AGL's opinion the samples are representative.

The figure below depicts the drillhole distribution throughout the resonance area:

7.4 Drilling Methods  
 
Drilling on the project comprises both reverse circulation and diamond drilling methods. Tyler 
currently has two contractors on site: Drift Exploration Drilling Inc. operating as Conservation 
De Queretaro S.A. de C.V. (reverse circulation) and B.D.W. International Drilling of Mexico 
S.A. de C.V. 
 
A total of 222 holes have been captured in the database utilized for geological modeling, with 
22499 sample analysis and 4324 geological entries made. 
 
Procedures in drilling the holes on the Bahuerachi project were as follows: 
 

â€¢ The Geologist set out the holes in an area accessible to the drill rigs and marked by a steel 
peg on the planned position of the hole;

â€¢ The pads are subsequently prepared by bulldozing with the supervision of the Geologist 
and the Drill operator to obtain a level platform to position the drill rig on; 

â€¢ The boreholes are drilled according to the geologist instructions and core or chips are laid 
out for inspection by the geologist. 

â€¢ Geologist would instruct the hole to be stopped. 
â€¢ The hole position would be surveyed by ground survey methods.  Dip and azimuth angles 

would be measured, and for some deeper holes a down hole survey would be done.    
â€¢ Geologist would log holes and prepare and dispatch samples for analysis. 

 
Table 7.1 depicts the various drilling campaigns done on the project area.  It can be seen from 
this table that drilling increased on the Bahuerachi project over time not only by total length 
drilled, number of holes drilled (RC and DD holes) but there was also an increase in total depth 
drilled. The 2007 holes are excluded from this as drilling is continuing. 
 
Figure 7.2 depicts the drillhole distribution throughout the project area color coded per year of 
drilling. 
 
7.4.1 Diamond Drilling 
 
The diamond drill holes are typically collared by HQ diameter (63,20mm core diameter) and 
reduced when competent rock is intersected to NQ diameter (47,30mm core diameter). The top 
portion of the borehole is typically steel cased to prevent caving of the borehole and deflecting of 
the latter. The diamond-drilled cores are recovered in 3m core runs. The core is placed in 1m 
length wooden coreboxes with depths indicated by wooden tags and writing.

7.4.2 Analysis of Down Hole Surveys 
 
There were 44 diamond drilled holes surveyed down hole (14%).  Of these surveys 6 were done 
to the holes drilled in the 2005 drilling campaign, 32 surveys to holes drilled in 2006 (73%) and 
6 of the 2007 holes (14%).  
 
Down hole surveying was done to 25 of the 54 holes drilled deeper than 250 meters (46%), and 
to 20 of 34 holes deeper than 400 meters (59%), and 9 of the 11 holes drilled in access of 500 
meters (82%).  Figures 7.3 and 7.4 plot the difference between measured and planned position of 
the holes. 
 
From these charts it is clear that holes drilled did not deviate more than 20 meters from the 
planned position.  From the linear equation it can be seen that the average deviation for holes up 
to 400 meters is 10 meters or 2.4% of total depth.  The total deviation for all the holes that were 
surveyed were 2.8% compared to length drilled.  The deviations are mostly attributed to changes 
in dip rather than azimuth. 
 
It is in this author's opinion that these deviations are not excessive, and that holes drilled to 
depths greater than 200 meters should routinely be surveyed down the hole. The total deviation 
at this depth is expected to be less than 5 meters.

8.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
Associated Mining Consultants Ltd. prepared a letter report dated June 09, 2004 with 
recommendations for the implementation of a quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) 
program for the handling of drilling samples from the Phase II exploration program at 
Bahuerachi. Prior to this, Tyler Resources Inc. did not have a systematic on-going quality 
assurance (QA) program in place for the Bahuerachi project. Some quality control (QC) was 
provided by independent data verification as well as the laboratory's internal procedures. 
 
Quality assurance (QA) refers to a plan for implementing practices which ensure that appropriate 
measures have been taken to ensure sample integrity, appropriate sample preparation and 
analytical methods, and internal and external checks of the accuracy and precision of assay data. 
Part of quality assurance is making sure that the laboratory follows, and reports on, its own 
internal quality assurance and quality control procedures.  
 
Quality control (QC) refers to the actual procedures used to verify the accuracy and precision of 
the data received. 
 
As the Bahuerachi exploration project proceeds, Tyler Resources has implemented a 
comprehensive QA/QC program to ensure the validity of the sample analytical data.  
 
Tyler has now implemented a program of geotechnical logging including the determination of 
the rock quality designation (RQD) as well as fracture density, type and filling. 
 
8.1 Prior Practices 
 
During Phase I drilling, HQ (or NQ) sized core wass transported in open boxes from the drill site 
to the camp core logging facility. The core recovery is calculated and the core is geologically 
logged. Samples intervals are marked by the geologist and are generally constrained by 
lithological breaks. Sample intervals were as great as 2 m due to poor core recovery. 
 
The poor condition of the core suggested that core recovery estimates were a "best guess". 
 
The core from the marked sample intervals was cut in half using a diamond saw by a site 
geologist. 
 
The poor, "rubbly", condition of the core makes accurate sampling difficult and Tyler is 
cautioned that some of the assays from Phase I drilling should be considered as indicative of the 
presence of mineralization but not necessarily representative of the grade of any particular 
interval.  
 
Obviously where there has been good core recovery, greater than 80%-85%, there can be a 
reasonable expectation that the grade is representative of that cored interval. However, where 
variable recoveries or areas of poor recovery exceeding 2-3 runs occur then it becomes difficult

to extrapolate the grade over an extended interval. Another issue arises when a zone of good 
recovery between areas of poor recovery occur which can lead to loss of depth control in the 
sample. 
 
The samples are then bagged and a number of sample bags are placed together in rice sacks and 
sealed with individual number tamper proof security seals.  Rice sacks are security tagged. On a 
regular basis samples are transported to the town of Choix where they are transferred to a vehicle 
provided by the sample preparation facility in Hermosillo, Mexico. 
 
At the ALS-Chemex sample preparation facility, the received samples were weighed, dried and 
crushed to 70 % <2 mm. After riffle splitting the coarse samples were pulverized to 85 % <75 
Âµm and shipped to the ALS-Chemex facility in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for 
analysis. 
 
The samples undergo a multi-element geochemical analysis procedure for 34 elements (Method 
Code ME-ICP 41). This involves an aqua regia partial digestion followed by an instrumental 
analytical method, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. This method may 
under-report certain elements such as aluminum, calcium, chromium, potassium and magnesium 
(as well as many resistate elements) due to the partial digestion and should not be used to 
develop any geochemical ratios using these elements. 
 
Gold (Au) is determined using a 30 g fire-assay with an atomic absorption finish (Method Code 
Au-AA23). Where the multi-element procedure indicates that the concentration of copper (Cu), 
lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) are >10,000 ppm (or 1 %) or 100 ppm in the case of silver (Ag), then 
these samples are re-analyzed using an ore grade methodology (Method Codes Cu, Ag, Pb or Zn-
AA46). This involves an aqua regia digestion followed by an atomic absorption finish. 
 
8.2 Current Practices 
 
Two components of external quality control have been implemented. These involve the use of 
"Standards" or "Reference Controls" as well as a program based on the submission of duplicate 
samples. 
 
8.2.1 Standards 
 
Standards or reference controls for various metals can be readily purchased in Canada from 
CANMET. These samples are very finely ground and readily obvious when submitted with core 
or other geochemical samples. If the sample preparation facility is in-house or independent of the 
laboratory then these standards can be inserted at that stage as a check on the laboratory. This 
procedure will eventually fail if the standards appear different from the local lithologies as the 
laboratory will eventually determine the expected value of the standards and there will be a 
tendency (conscious or otherwise) to report the required values.

Therefore, standards (at a minimum of two concentrations, low and high) should be prepared 
from local materials whenever possible. Local standards will also minimize potential matrix 
effects from different source materials. AMCL recommended a sample of QFP for a high-grade 
standard and a sample of the sediments for a low-grade standard. Care should be chosen in 
selecting a sample that does not contain a significant iron content as this causes well documented 
interferences in ICP analytical methods. The sample volume should be sufficient to last for a 
substantial period of exploration. 
 
High and low-grade certified standards have been prepared under the supervision of Mr. Barry 
Smee, P.Geol. 
 
8.2.2 Duplicate Samples 
 
A program of duplicate samples is the preferred system for ensuring the accuracy and precision 
of the analytical data. The following practices have been implemented for the Bahuerachi 
project: 
 

â€¢ In this case, where the sample preparation facility is not 
independent of the laboratory, both laboratory pulps (assay 
rejects) and coarse rejects should be returned to Tyler Resources. 
Approximately 5 %-10 % of these, covering a range of lithologies 
and concentrations (of all of the principal elements of interest), 
should be re-submitted to the primary laboratory in new bags with 
new numbers for re-analysis. The assay repeats will check 
analytical errors and the coarse rejects will check sample 
preparation and analytical errors. 

 
â€¢ Approximately 5% of the core sample intervals should be split and 

submitted to the sample preparation facility under different sample 
numbers. A limited number of laboratory pulps and coarse rejects 
from these samples should be submitted to a second laboratory as 
an external check on laboratory bias. 

 
Field sampling procedures are appropriate and sample quality has improved with better core 
recovery. 
 
The analytical procedures currently used by Tyler resources are generally appropriate for this 
stage of exploration. The potentially mineralized samples comprise various lithologies which 
have been variably altered, undergone metasomatic processes (skarn) and may be comprised of 
oxidized material (Â± secondary sulphides such as chalcocite) as well as primary sulphide 
minerals.

The basic aqua regia digestion should be adequate for most samples, however, multi-acid 
digestion should be tried on several duplicate samples from the next program to ensure complete 
reporting of the elements of interest. 
 
Due to the presence of variable degrees of oxidation, samples should be submitted (on a routine 
basis for) for total sulphur vs sulphide sulphur. 
 
Where there is good core recovery in the oxidized zone, Tyler Resources has initiated the 
selective use of sequential copper analyses as well as ICP. Sequential copper analyses report 
sulfuric acid soluble copper (nonsulphide), cyanide soluble copper, and total copper. This type of 
analysis produces data that may be very valuable to a major considering involvement in the 
project. 
 
10,000 ppm is the upper detection limit for copper, zinc and lead using Method Code ME-ICP41. 
Tyler Resources should re-analyze samples containing concentrations of these elements >5,000 
ppm (possibly 2,500 ppm in the case of copper) using an atomic absorption (AAS) method. 
 
The majority of the recommendations of this report have been implemented with the exception of 
copper sequential analysis and geotechnical logging. Tyler has implemented these last two 
recommendations as of the date of the report.

9.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
9.1 Independent Data Verification 
 
Data verification for the August 2003 underground sampling program was carried out, 
independently, by Keith McCandlish, P.Geol., of Associated Mining Consultants Ltd. (AMCL).  
 
The samples were bagged, labeled, sealed and returned to the base camp. At the camp the 
samples were opened and logged, photographed and representative chips collected for mineral 
identification by J.P. Jutras. Keith McCandlish selected eleven samples from different lithologies 
which were then split in the field and the split re-bagged with a different field sample number. 
Tyler was not permitted to observe this procedure. All of the samples bags were sealed by Keith 
McCandlish and subsequent ly placed in 20 L plastic pails which were then sealed using AMCL 
tamper proof seals. The pails were shipped by burro to the village of La Reforma and by truck to 
the ALS-Chemex sample preparation facility in Hermosillo, Mexico accompanied at all times by 
the authors. Some plastic pails were opened and inspected by Mexican Federal Police in a 
routine drug inspection. Opened pails were re-sealed and all were delivered to ALS-Chemex. 
 
At the ALS-Chemex sample preparation facility, the received samples were weighed, dried and 
crushed to 70% <2 mm. After riffle splitting the coarse samples were the samples were 
pulverized to 85% <75Âµm and shipped to the ALS-Chemex facility in North Vancouver, British 
Columbia, Canada. 
 
The samples were subjected to two analytical procedures: gold was determined using a 30 g fire 
assay fusion with an atomic absorption spectroscopic finish (Method Code Au-AA25). The 
samples were also subject to analysis for 34 individual elements using a single acid (aqua regia) 
digestion followed by analysis by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy 
(Method Code ME-ICP41). 
 
Some discrepancies in the analytical results between the original samples and the field splits 
were considered to be of significance, not withstanding the coarse nature of the mineralization 
and the crude method of field splitting (cone and quarter). Coarse rejects of the split samples 
were shipped from the ALS-Chemex facility in Hermosillo directly to SGS-Lakefield in 
Lakefield, Ontario. As well, pulp rejects of the same samples were shipped from ALS-Chemex 
in North Vancouver to SGS-Lakefield. 
 
These samples were analyzed for gold using a 30 g fire assay fusion with a gravimetric finish. 
The remnant material was subject to a three acid digestion with analytical determination for 
copper, zinc, and silver by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). A multi-acid digestion was chosen since it 
results in a more complete digestion of the host material (particularly important given the 
complex mineralogy) and should result in more representative results.

As a result of this check assay program, it was determined that the discrepancies in results were 
due to the coarse nature of the mineralization and poor sampling technique (in terms of field 
splitting) rather than any problem with sample preparation or analytical method.  
 
AMCL also selected two drill holes (04BAH-DDH4 and 04BAH-DDH 7) from Phase I drilling 
(May-June, 2004) for re-sampling as they had reasonable recoveries over a range of intervals. 
Selected sample intervals (which had already been submitted to the laboratory) were chosen to 
cover a range of lithological types and potential copper concentrations (based on the observed 
presence or absence of various, multiple copper oxide and sulphide minerals). The remaining 
half core was resawn, sampled and submitted to the laboratory using different sample numbers. 
The samples were mixed in with other core samples being shipped at the same time. Coarse 
rejects and laboratory pulps from these samples as well as the original core split were be sent to a 
second laboratory for analyses.  
 
At the ALS-Chemex sample preparation facility in Hermosillo, Mexico the received drilling 
samples were weighed, dried and crushed to 70% <2 mm. After riffle splitting the coarse 
samples were pulverized to 85% <75Âµm and shipped to the ALS-Chemex facility in North 
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for analysis. On occasion samples were shipped to the 
ALS-Chemex facility in Durango, Mexico. 
 
The samples undergo a multi-element geochemical analysis for 34 elements (Method Code ME-
ICP 41). This involves an aqua regia (nitric acid or HNO3 and hydrochloric acid or HCl) partial 
digestion followed by the determination of elemental concentration using an instrumental 
analytical method: inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). This 
method will under-report certain elements such as aluminum, calcium, chromium, potassium and 
magnesium (as well as many resistate elements) due to the partial digestion and should not be 
used to develop any geochemical ratios using these elements. 
 
Gold (Au) is determined using a 30 g fire-assay pre-concentration with an atomic absorption 
finish (Method Code Au-AA23). 
 
Where the multi-element procedure indicates that the concentration of copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and 
zinc (Zn) are >10,000 ppm (1%) or >100 ppm in the case of silver (Ag), then these samples are 
re-analyzed using an ore grade methodology (Method Codes Cu, Ag, Pb or Zn-AA46). This 
involves an aqua regia digestion followed by an atomic absorption finish. In all cases, the partial 
aqua regia digestion may under-report the concentrations of base metals, depending on 
mineralogy, however, previous analytical work requested by AMCL for Tyler suggests that the 
single acid digestion is complete, at least for copper and zinc.  
 
Laboratory pulp samples provide a check on the laboratory performance while coarse reject 
samples provide a check on both the sample preparation facility as well as the laboratory.

In the case of Tyler original sample number 258346 and AMCL Â¼ core replicate sample number 
258960, ALS-Chemex did not ship the original coarse reject or laboratory pulp material 
corresponding to sample number 258346 to SGS-Lakefield. 
 
Coarse reject and laboratory pulp material corresponding to Tyler original sample number 
258356 were sent to SGS-Lakefield in error. There is no associated Â¼ core replicate sample. This 
data is still useful and has been included as an additional (14th sample). 
 
The analytical techniques used by SGS-Lakefield were chosen by AMCL to mimic the 
procedures used by ALS-Chemex as closely as possible. 
 
Coarse reject samples are re-crushed, if required, to 90% - 95% <2mm. The crushed samples are 
riffle split in a Jones riffle to obtain a 200 g sample. The split sample is milled using a ring and 
puck and then transferred to a vibratory mill for final milling. Samples are milled to 90% - 95% 
passing 200 mesh. 
 
The samples undergo a multi-element geochemical analysis procedure for 32 elements (Method 
Code ICP12B). This analytical procedure is very similar to that used by ALS-Chemex and 
described above. 
 
Copper and zinc were also reported using an ore grade methodology involving an aqua regia 
digestion followed by an atomic absorption finish (Method Code AA70) in addition to the 
ICP12B procedure. SGS-Lakefield was requested to remove 10,000 ppm upper detection limits 
that they normally place on this method for consistency of reporting with the ALS-Chemex 
results. This upper detection limit is only in place due to the single acid digestion. 
 
Silver which can be reported as part of this multi-element suite (and was by ALS-Chemex) was 
analyzed by SGS Lakefield using a different methodology. Gallium (Ga), boron (B), mercury 
(Hg), sulfur (S), thallium (Tl) and uranium (U) were reported by ALS-Chemex but not by SGS-
Lakefield. Lithium (Li), tin (Sn), yttrium (Y) and zirconium (Zr) were reported by SGS-
Lakefield but not by ALS-Chemex. 
 
Gold (Au) was determined using a 30 g fire-assay pre-concentration with an inductively coupled 
plasma-emission spectroscopic finish (Method Code FAI303). 
 
Silver (Ag) was determined using an aqua regia digestion with an atomic absorption finish 
(Method Code AAS12E). 
 
The results of all the analyses have been compiled in a single Excelï£¨ spreadsheet which is 
attached to this letter report. 
 
The correlation between the original Tyler assay data from ALS-Chemex and the coarse reject 
and laboratory pulp re-analysis at SGS-Lakefield across all of the elements analyzed is excellent.

As well, correlation between the Â¼ core replicate samples analyzed at ALS-Chemex and the pulp 
and coarse reject analysis at SGS-Lakefield is generally very good. Two Â¼ core replicate 
samples (258963, 258962) showed an unacceptable degree of variability in copper results 
between the ALS-Chemex analysis and both the SGS-Lakefield analyses of the laboratory pulp 
and coarse reject. One Â¼ core replicated sample showed an unacceptable degree of variability 
between the SGS-Lakefield coarse reject analysis and the other two analyses. Duplicates and 
duplicate analyses by different methods report within a very narrow range. In all three cases, the 
coarse reject analysis completed by SGS-Lakefield most closely correlates with the analytical 
results for the original Â¼ core sample possibly suggesting a minor sample preparation problem at 
ALS-Chemex. These were all submitted to ALS-Chemex in the same shipment. While this is a 
minor issue, it does point out the importance of on-going QA/QC procedures. 
 
Different Â¼ core samples are not the same sample and may, particularly in gold assays, aid in 
establishing the presence of a nugget effect. The correlation between the Â¼ core replicate 
samples and the original Tyler Â¼ core sample assay data is generally very good, suggesting that 
there is no nugget effect present as would be expected in this type of geological environment.  
 
9.1.1 Recommendations 
 

C There is no reason that Tyler Resources should not continue to use the facilities of 
ALS-Chemex. 

 
C ALS-Chemex should be instructed to report the results of internal duplicate 

analyses on all assay certificates. 
 
During the Phase II drilling Tyler implemented the QA/QC program described previously in 
Section 8.0. This program was successful in identifying and correcting a significant mix-up in 
sample numbering at the laboratory. AGL has had full access to all of this information and 
approximately 10% of the assay database was checked against the original assay certificates. 
 
9.2 Review of Analytical Database for Resource Modeling 
 
9.2.1 Sampling 
 
A total of 22,300 samples were submitted for analysis.  These samples were from Diamond 
Drilling (14,573) as well as Reverse Circulation Drilling (7,727).  No Analytical data was 
received for the 1997 series of holes. Table 9.1 depicts numbers of samples submitted over time 
for the Diamond drill holes and RC holes.  From the samples a total of 65% were submitted from 
Diamond drill holes.

Sampling for both sets of drilling were submitted to the same laboratory (ALS Chemex) and the 
results were entered into the spreadsheets for both the RC and diamond drilling holes.  The 
samples were analyzed for the following elements using XRF: 
 

â€¢ Au ppm, Ag ppm, Al %, As ppm, B ppm, Ba ppm, Be ppm, Bi ppm, Ca %, Cd ppm, Co 
ppm, Cr ppm, Cu ppm, Fe %, Ga ppm, Hg ppm, K %, La ppm, Mg %, Mn ppm, Mo ppm, 
Na %, Ni ppm, P ppm, Pb ppm, S %, Sb ppm, Sc ppm, Sr ppm, Ti %, Tl ppm, U ppm, V 
ppm, W ppm, Zn ppm. 

 
The following values were calculated from the analysis: 
 

â€¢ Cu %, Zn %, Pb %. 
 
9.2.2 Validation of Sampling and Check Samples 
 
A total of 962 (4.3%) of the samples were directed toward quality control.  Table 9.2 provides an 
overview of these samples.  Samples were submitted for check analysis (2.8%), Blank samples 
(0.5%) and 3 types of standards (1.0%), on a regular basis.

Looking at the individual statistics we see that there is a good correlation between the original 
and check samples submitted for analysis.  This correlation is depicted in Table 9.3 where the 
average grade, minimum and maximum grades for the two data sets are given.

From the graphs above it is clear that there is a good correlation and repeatability in the samples 
that has been put in for check analys is.  The sample "spread" is small.  Ag, Cu, Fe, and Pb a R2 
greater then 0.9, Au a R2 greater than .85 and Mo and Zn  a R2 greater than  0.7. 
 
It is in this author's opinion that the check samples show a good repeatability and that their 
spread is to be expected for detailed statistical and special statistical analysis.  It has to be noted 
though that the check samples represent only a small portion (2.8%) of the total sample 
population.  For this reason it is suggested that in the future at least every 20th sample (or 5%) 
for both RC and DD holes be submitted for repeats.   
 
9.2.2.1 Validation of QAQC Blank and Standards samples 
 
Figures 9.2(A-G) below depict the blank samples as well as the 3 standards samples (standard, 
moderate grade and cutoff grades).  One sample was omitted from the figures for the Au (g/t), 
Ag(g/t) and Fe% and 2 samples for the Pb% and Cu%, for display purposes.  These omitted 
samples are outliers. 
 
It is in the Authors opinion that there were good sample and assay procedures and practices when 
looking at the Blank and Standards samples.  Each sample grouping has a small spread and is 
consistently of similar grades.

10.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
A 60 day regional field program in 1998 was carried out around the Bahuerachi Property. 
Numerous showings were visited and sampled over an area of some 400 km2 and regional 
mapping was carried out which enhanced the geological knowledge base for the property itself.   
 
Although numerous copper and gold showings occur on a regional scale around the property, 
none are at an advanced exploration stage and Bahuerachi remains the most mature target in the 
area.

11.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
11.1 Process Research Associates Ltd 
 
Six metallurgical composites were prepared from drill core intervals representing four zones of 
primarily copper (Cu) mineralization. The four mineralized zones consisted of hypogene-
porphyry (HP), hypogene-skarn (HS), chalcocite blanket (CC) and oxidized skarn (OS). All of 
the samples were subjected to standard batch froth flotation procedures to recover sulfide 
minerals. In addition, preliminary acid leach tests were performed on samples from the oxidized 
zones (CC, OS). 
 
The Table below shows the head assay of the six metallurgical (MET) composites, which 
consisted of two composites from each of the HP and HS zones, and one each from the CC and 
OS zones. 
 
Table 11.1: Head Assay Grades 

Test Feed Head Assay Grades 

ID Au, g/t Au, g/t Cu, % Fe, % ST, % 

MET-1 (HP1) 0.03 3 0.46 2.37 1.70 

MET-2 (HP2) 0.01 2 0.23 1.57 1.80 

MET-3 (HS1) 0.09 11 1.24 11.5 14.9 

MET-4 (HS2) 0.18 15 2.07 21.5 9.64 

MET-5 (CC) 0.01 3 1.14 4.74 1.40 

MET-6 (OS) 0.18 23 2.62 18.7 1.24 

 
The skarns show higher copper and gold values with elevated iron and zinc mineral contents. 
Open cycle flotation of HP and HS sulphide zones recovered from 92% to 98% of the copper to 
the bulk concentrate. The tests showed good recoveries at a relatively coarse particle size of 80% 
passing (P80) of 120 Âµm to 160 Âµm, and further room to decrease grinding requirements may 
exist. Regrinding and flotation cleaning of the sulphide zones showed that HS material produced 
excellent concentrate grades of 34% Cu that also contained 1.8% Zn, up to 2.5 g/t gold and 142 
g/t silver.  
 
Cleaning of the hyprogene (HP) zone was also responsive with >75% Cu recoveries at a final 
grade of 19% Cu, 0.92% Mo, 0.5 g/t Au and up to 86 g/t Ag. However, the Mo separation will 
require many cleaning stages at a finer regrind and a much larger scale of testing. Preliminary 
HP results indicate that further upgrading is possible using modified flotation procedures, which 
should include additional cleaning stages and reagent substitution.

The CC zone produced good concentrate grades with flotation, but due to the relatively high 
degree of sulphide oxidation present the corresponding open cycle rougher copper recovery was 
only âˆ¼55%. Similarly the OS zone showed a recovery of 34%. Consequently, both these oxidized 
zones (CC, OS) were evaluated using sulphuric acid leaching of the flotation tailings, as well as 
direct leaching of whole ore at various grinds. The results show that approximately 80% of the 
oxide-copper present in the flotation tailing can be leaching into solution for subsequent 
recovery. This would indicate that a combination of flotation to recover sulfide copper and acid 
leaching of flotation tailing to recover oxidized copper can be considered for the CC and OS 
material. Alternately, whole-ore leaching of these oxidized zones provided 48% to 80% in 
copper recovery depending on the procedures used. This offers an opportunity to investigate 
heap leaching, possibly in conjunction with bio-heap leaching for improving the dissolution of 
copper from the sulfide mineralization that is also present.  
 
The results from the preliminary metallurgical investigation show that all of the zones test from 
Bahuerachi responded well to standard processing procedures. Further work is warranted to 
optimize procedures and forward the program in conjunction with the property exploration.

12.0 GEOLOGICAL MODELING AND GEOSTATISTICS 
 
12.1 Mineral Resource Data Collection 
 
12.1.1 Survey Data 
 
No new aerial survey was done for this report.  The survey done in late 2005 to early 2006 was 
used.  Satellite imagery provided by Photoset was used to generate a digital terrain model with a 
resolution of 2m over the entire project.  Drillholes were surveyed using ground survey methods, 
and reduced to the map coordinates.  There were some discrepancies related to the collar 
coordinates and the topographical plan.  The problems related to the local surveyor not reducing 
the coordinates in a consistent manner.  The data was re-reduced but, there were collars that still 
did not plot on the topographical data.  Collar elevations were adjusted to topography for 
proposes of resource modeling. 
 
A new satellite image will be obtained in 2007 but, AGL's strategy recommends that survey 
procedures be reviewed and data reduction supervised by an external consultant. 
 
12.1.2 Resource Database 
 
The resource was evaluated by two drilling techniques i.e. predominantly diamond drilling 
(33,809.45 meters) and a smaller meterage of reverse circulation drilling (11,675.41 meters). 
Data was captured into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and subsequently loaded in Surpac Vision 
software, into a Microsoft Access database.  The database consists of a number of tables, each of 
which contains a number of fields of data. Each table will have many rows with each row 
containing the data fields.  Tables included in the database are Collar, Survey, Sample and 
Lithology. 
 
When data is loaded into the database there were validation checked done to ensure database 
integrity.  The validation routines checked for the following errors or inconsistencies: 
 

â€¢ Holes missing for sample and survey and lihology tables; 
â€¢ Overlapping sample and lithology intercepts; 
â€¢ Data deeper that maximum depth set out in the collar table; 
â€¢ Sampling data outside limits set on element grades (upper and lower); 
â€¢ Valid entries for lithology coding.

12.2 Geological Modeling 
 
The project area comprises a sedimentary sequence.  This sequence dips 20Â° to 60Â° to the west.  
The base of this sequence in the project area comprises a quarts-pyrite epidote altered fine 
grained clastic sedimentary rocks.  This is overlain by siliceous and calcareous bedded 
sedimentary rocks with 10-90% calc-silicates plus quartz, feldspar and anhydrate alteration.  
Locally this is underlain by a marble unit (limestone in places) with local fracture controlled 
sulfide veins and pods of skarn.  Above this unit we find fine grained sedimentary rock with 
sheeted quart veinlets.   
 
To the west there is a steeply dipping fault dipping to the west that forms the boundary of a 
quartz-pyrite-epidote altered andesite volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. 
 
Two types of skarn were logged in the area.  The one a garnet-pyroxene anhydrite-sulfide skarn 
and the other a mineralized pyroxene +/- garnet skarn (this unit generally is found in the 
calcareous-siliceous bedded sedimentary rocks). The Skarn comprises lenses of up to some 10m 
in thickness.   
 
There is a quartz feldspar porphyry (QFP) dyke or intrusion that has moderately to strong quartz, 
pyrite-chalcopyrite +/- bornite +/- Mo stockworks.  The QFP zones are generally steeply dipping 
to the west to north nest at neat vertical to 75Â°.  The QFP is massive in places that to a true 
thickness of some 400 m down to lenses a few meters thick.  
 
There are some post mineralization rhyolite and andesite dykes present. 
 
There were 29 sections between 25 - 100 m spacing on 2 grid orientations (east to west (14) and 
north-west to south east (15)) obtained from the geologist charge of the project.  These sections 
formed the base / template of the modeling and the understanding of the lithological controls.  
Furthermore to control the modeling a surface geological map was received to further control the 
geological modeling done in Surpac Vision. 
  
12.2.1 Principles 
 
Drillholes were displayed on screen coded according to various lithological and or grade 
boundaries to aid modeling.  The computer model constructed for the main project area was 
based on the geological interpreted sections developed by the geologists on site. Rock type, QFP 
and skarn and intrusive dykes and fault traces were delineated on cross-sections and digitized in 
true 3D by selecting on the actual drillhole trace. These drillholes were in the background.  The 
surface geology was accounted for by the use of the surface mapping plan.  During this process 
the geologist in charge of the project sat in and guided the interpretation. 
 
The lithological units were all assigned a code that was used to distinguish one unit from the 
other on color.  These codes are depicted in Table 12.1.

12.2.2 Structural Control 
 
A method incorporating solids modeling of the sectional interpreted sections was used to model / 
wireframe each section to the correspond ing next section.  The result of this is a solid model or 
envelope of the modeled entity so that volumes could be obtained, or these solids are used as 
constraints during the resource modeling process. 
 
The mineralization is controlled by fault structures, as these contacts sometimes cut off 
mineralization depending on the age of the fault.  The first step in the modeling process was to 
delineate these fault boundaries or blocks.  This was the first attempt in understanding the 
deposit not only on single sections but from section to section includes linking the surface fault 
traces. 
 
In general in order of importance there are three areas one to the north, a central and southern 
area, that are separated by large fault structures striking east to west.  The next major faults in the 
area are the north south trending faults and the bounded fault to the west that forms the boundary 
between the sedimentary (east) and volcaniclastic sequence to the West.  There are numerous 
smaller faults that strike north-west to south-east.  Figure 12.1 depicts the fault blocks.

Figure 12.1: Fault blocks 
 
12.2.3 Model Boundaries 
 
Solids modeling was incorporated to model the lithological units in the model area.   
 
Each of the fault blocks was selected and the lithological units that are within this fault block 
were then split out into separate files.  These files (fault blocks) were then modeled separately.  
The sedimentary and volcaniclastic sequences was modeled first as this forms the underlying 
structure of the geological model.   
 
The QFP and skarn units were then modeled as they have little or no effect on the sedimentary or 
volcaniclastic sequence.  The andesite and rhyolite dykes were also modeled at this stage. 
 
Figure 12.2 depicts the solids model for the project area.

12.3 Statistical Analysis of Sample Data 
 
During the loading of the database, checks were done to validate the data.  Surveys were checked 
by plotting these holes on the topographical digital terrain model (DTM). 
 
From the 222 holed drilled 137 were diamond drilling and these holes produced 14,573 samples.  
Of the 85 RC holes 7,727 samples were obtained.  Of the sample data 8.4% was obtained from 
the 2007 drilling, 61.6% was obtained from the 2006 drilling, 24.4% from the 2005 drilling and 
5.5% from the 2004 drilling.  No sample data was received for the 1997 drilling.  
 
For purposes of this report the RC and DD holes were combined.

12.3.1 Sampling and Compositing 
 
The statistics for the sample lengths were taken from 21,269 samples, with an average sampling 
length of 2.012 m and 2 % samples are longer than 3.92 m (see Table 12.2). The maximum 
sample length is 201.2 m, but this sample was captured for lithological purposes.  The largest 
sample that was obtained for analytical purposes was 13.5 m.

12.3.1.1 Global Statistical Analysis and Cutting of High Grade Values 
 
Global statistical, spacial statistical work and grade estimation was only performed on the quartz 
feldspar porphyry, skarn, upper sediment, marble, calc silicate, and lower sediment units.   
 
Based on the sample length results obtained it was decided tha t compositing to a length of 2 m 
would be appropriate as this figure was the average sample width.    
 
The sample population contains a number of high grade sample values for all elements studied 
that would tend to over- influence the kriging process when estimating the model block grades.  
For this reason high grade values for each element were cut to the 99th percentile value.  This 
level was selected by running various cut values at increasingly lower percentile values.  A 
decision was made to use the 99th percentile as at this point the mean grade is affected 
minimally, but there is a large decrease in the variation and the coefficient of variation. 
 
The Statistics of each element is given in tables in the following section. 
 
Various statistical results are found in the tables.

â€¢ Percentiles are the grade at which the specified cumulative frequency percentage 
of the sample values occurs. The median is 50%. To determine the X percentile 
out of Y data points, X/100 * Y is used. If the Y is a even number, the next 
sample is (Y + 1) is added to Y and the total divide by 2. X percentile = (Y + 
(Y+1))/2 
 

â€¢ The mean is the arithmetic average of the data and is computed by dividing the 
sum of a set of data by the number of data points. 

 

â€¢ The variance describes the variability of the distribution or the spread of the data 

 

â€¢ The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance. 
 

â€¢ The skewness is a measure of the symmetry of the distribution. In a normal 
distribution, where the distribution is symmetric, the skewness is zero. The 
skewness is negative for dis tributions tailing to the left and positive for 
distributions tailing to the right. 
 

â€¢ The kurtosis is a measure of how peaked the distribution is, or the steepness of 
ascent near the mode of the distribution. It has a value of zero in a normal 
distribution and so is a good test for distribution normality. Most gold deposits 
display a very steep curve near the mode of the distribution so the value for the 
kurtosis can be expected to be quite high. 
 

â€¢ The coefficient of variation is a measure of the relative variation of the data and is 
calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean of the distribution. It 
provides a very useful guide to the variability of the data and their subsequent 
suitability for use in geostatistics or variogram analysis. As a general rule, those 
distributions with a coefficient of variation less than one should produce a 
reasonable variogram model; if the coefficient of variation is greater than one it 
implies that the data are quite variable and it is difficult to produce a good 
variogram model; if the coefficient of variation is greater than two there is 
virtually no chance of producing a good variogram model. 

 
12.4 Assessment of Grade Continuity â€“ Spatial Statistics 
 
Spatial statistics or variography is a recognized means of determining grade continuity in various 
directions.  This is done by comparing sample pairs with each other at various distances and

plotting the average variance at each of these distances.  A mathematical equation is then fitted 
on the graph.   
 
This process is done in various directions, as continuity changes depending on the direction 
being evaluated.  By comparing the various directions with each other one gets 3 principal 
directions each perpendicular to each other, a major, semi-major and minor direction.  By 
calculating the anisotropy ratio or ratios between Major/Semi-Major direction and Major/Minor 
directions we can determine the importance that each of the directions have on the grade 
interpolation. 
 
12.4.1 Variography 
 
Since the orientation of the mineralized zones is different for each unit as well as for each 
element they all had to be done separately.  Tabled below are the results of all the statistics as 
well as the variogram analysis. 
 
Having fitted a variogram curve we obtain a nugget sill and range values.   Using these values 
we can compare an estimated and an original grade, this process is known as validation.  For 
each data point a Kriged grade can be calculated and compared with the measured grade. There 
are several key points to look for in this output. The summary statistics of the Kriging errors give 
the variance of the actual Kriging errors along with the theoretical Kriging variance. If the 
variogram model is a good model for the data set used, then these two values will be within 15% 
of each other. The mean of the actual Kriging errors is also given and should be very close to 
zero. Finally, the percentage of the Kriging errors within two standard deviations of the mean 
should be about 95%, indicating that the spread of Kriging errors is not very large. The above 
output meets all of these criteria, so the variogram model used is appropriate for the data set 
used.

12.5 Block Modeling 
 
The computer model containing the structural fault blocks, lithological units, Mineralized 
envelopes grade information and specific gravity was loaded into the block model. 
 
12.5.1 Block Model Dimensions 
 
The block model origin and extents were chosen to cover the whole of the Bahuerachi Main zone 
project area.  Block sizes or dimensions were chosen to reflect the results of the special statistics 
as well as drillhole and data density as well as mining method that would be employed.  A 
technique called sub blocking was used to accurately model the structural and geological 
complexity of the model area.  Table 12.44 below depicts the parameters used in the block 
modeling process.

Min. Block Size 7.5 7.5 5 

Rotation 0.000 0.000 0.000 

 
12.5.2 Structural and Geological Constraints 
 
Spatial constraints were created that represent each and every structural block and lithological 
unit.  Attributes were created and these constraints were then used to assign fault blocks, as well 
as the lithological codes.  Assigning the lithological units with the lithological codes was done in 
the following order. 
 
1. Fine grained sedimentary rock - 1 
2. Marble - 2 
3. Siliceous and calcareous bedded sedimentary rocks - 3 
4. Fine grained clastic sedimentary rocks - 4 
5. Andesite volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks - 5 
6. Quartz feldspar porphyry - 6  
7. Skarn - 8 
8. Rhyolite dykes -9 
9. Andesite dykes -10 
10. Air â€“ 0

In this way the blocks previously assigned would be overwritten by subsequent assigning.    
 
12.5.3 Grade Interpolation 
 
Grade was interpola ted using ordinary Kriging.  This interpolation method was selected because 
data distribution and density was sufficient for interpolating using OK, good variograms were 
obtained during the special statistical part of the project and reasonable to good validation was 
obtained. 
 
Each element was individually interpolated in each of the QFP and Skarn units.  Tables 12.45 
(A-F) below depict the Kriging parameters used during the interpolation of grades into the block 
model.  A minimum of 5 samples and a maximum of 15 samples were used in determining block 
grade.

Estimation is done for each block by doing a number of point estimations and then averaged to 
give a block average or block grade.  This process is called discretisation an for the estimation a 
discretisation of 3 x 3 x 1 was used for the 30 x 30 x 10 user block size.  This has the effect that 
points at 10 x 10 x 10 were used (homogeneous axis lengths in all directions).  
 
During the estimation we also add attributes based on the data used during the estimation process 
of each block.  These include for each element, the closest sample, average distance of samples 
used, number of samples used as well as the Kriging Variance.  
 
12.5.4 In Situ (Bulk) Density 
 
A few bulk densities (g/cm3) were obtained for each lithological unit.  These were then averaged 
to obtain a density figure to assign to an attribute for calculation of the tonnage from the volume.  
Table 12.46 below depicts the values used during the project.

12.5.6 Validation 
 
Validation is the process of looking at the interpolated grade, geological constraints and input 
data to measure how successful the interpolation was. There are various ways in validating the 
results obtained.  
 
Kriging efficiency (KE): 
Kriging efficiency = [(Block Variance) â€“ (Kriging error variance)] /  
(Block Variance).   This formula means that efficiency ranges between +1 and -1.  
 
Block Variance is the theoretical variance that was obtained during the interpolation of grades.  
This value is obtained by integrating the variogram function over the sample support that you are 
Kriging into. In this formula if the Kriging error variance is larger than the block variance then 
you have a negative efficiency, indicating that the estimates obtained are not reliable.  If the

efficiency is negative then one usually has two real options: increase your block size and the 
number of data you use to Krige, or replace your Kriged estimates with a single global mean 
value.  
 
The kriging efficiency was calculated for the Cu estimation. The results obtained was all greater 
than 0.  It was this assumed that the interpolation parameters, were acceptable.  
 
12.5.6.1 Graphically 
 
In Surpac VisionTM the block model was colour coded on various elements and then compared to 
the drillhole information/composite values.  The geometry of the interpolated blocks was also 
examined against the solid models.   
 
The graphical validation was successful and higher grades are found in the region of high grade 
drill holes and vice versa.  The interpolation was acceptable using graphical methods.  The result 
of the graphical validation for one section is given in Figure 12.259. Looking at say the skarn 
unit, one can follow low (blue) medium (green) and higher grade (red) drillhole grades as well as 
interpolated grade in the block model that is comparable.

Figure 12.259:  Graphical validation for a typ ical section 

 
12.5.6.2 Graphing 
 
The last method that was used to determine the acceptability of the interpolated grades is by 
comparing the composite grades with those of the interpolated grade along various section lines.  
Furthermore plotting these and displaying the volume of material in each section and relating this 
to the number of samples used in the interpolation.   
 
One would expect where large volume of interpolated blocks are one would get more sample 
data, and where you have higher grades in the composite samples, one would expect to see no 
increase in the average grade of the interpolated grades. 
 
The graphing also yielded positive results with higher composite sample grades reporting higher 
interpolated blocks and where larger volumes are obtained in the model, there is an increase in 
the number of composite samples.  Figures 12.261 â€“ 12.300 depict the graphing validation used 
in this project; these are for each element and for both the QFP and Skarn zones.

13.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

13.1 Mineral Resource Estimate 
 
AGL has completed a mineral resource estimate for the Bahuerachi Deposit which has been 
classified in the measured, indicated and inferred categories of mineral resources based on the 
CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 
 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic 
or fossilized organic material in or on the earth's crust in such form and quantity 
and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and 
continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from 
specific geological evidence and knowledge. 

 
This definition suggests that it is necessary to apply an economic cut-off grade even at an early 
stage of resource estimation. It is the considered opinion of AGL that mineralized material below 
a copper equivalent cut-of grade of 0.20% at Bahuerachi can not be considered as mineral 
resources as they are potentially uneconomic. The CIM definitions for resource categories are 
defined following: 
 

An "Inferred Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological 
evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, 
geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and 
sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 
 
An "Indicated Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics, can be 
estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate 
application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and 
evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, 
and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity 
to be reasonably assumed. 
 
A "Measured Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so 
well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the 
appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The 
estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing

information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough 
to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 
 

13.2 Mineral Resource Estimates with Copper Only Cut-Off 
 
A summary of the mineral resources of the Bahuerachi Deposit at =0.20 % copper only cut-off 
with a copper and copper-zinc equivalent grade (incorporating all of the elements of potentially 
economic interest) for comparative purposes follows (Table: X.X):

The substantial contribution of zinc to the overall metal value of the Bahuerachi Deposit should

13.4 Metal Equivalents 
 
AGL has reported the mineral resource estimate for the polymetallic Bahuerachi Deposit  at 
various copper equivalent (CuEq) cut-off grades =0.20%. The copper equivalent cut-off 
incorporates the contribution of all of the potentially economic metals excluding zinc. Copper 
equivalent (CuEq) and copper-zinc (CuZnEq) equivalent grades have been estimated for each 
copper equivalent cut-off at the request of Tyler Resources Inc. Form 43-101F1 states that: 
 

"when the grade for a polymetallic mineral resource or mineral reserve is 
reported as a metal equivalent, report the individual grades of each metal, and 
consider and report the recoveries, refinery costs and all other relevant 
conversion factors in addition to metal prices and the date and sources of such 
prices." 

 
Information or data regarding recoveries, mining costs, treatment charges, refining costs, etc. 
does not, generally, become available until a project has been the subject of at least a scoping 
level study or, more generally, a pre-feasibility assessment. A scoping level study of the 
Bahuerachi Deposit is currently underway. 
 
While AGL accepts that metal equivalents can be a useful tool for the mining professional in 
assessing the comparative merits of different projects, the reader is cautioned that metal 
equivalent grades calculated as part of a resource assessment can be misleading unless all of the 
relevant data used in the calculations are fully understood and that the calculations are on an 
equivalent basis. AGL has reported all of the individual metal grades. 
The formula used to estimate the copper equivalent cut-offs and copper and copper-zinc 
equivalent grades for the Bahuerachi Deposit is as follows:

CuZnEq(%)=((((Cu%x10xLb_KgxPrice_CuxRec_Cu)+(Mo%x10xLb_KgxPrice_MoxRec_
Mo)+(Zn%x10xLb_KgxPrice_MoxRec_Zn)+(Au_g/txPrice_Au/Oz-
gxRec_Au)+(Ag_g/txPrice_Ag/Oz-gxRec_Ag))/Price_Cu)/(Lb_Kg x 10)) 

 
or: 
 

CuZnEq(%)=((((Cu*10*2.204622622*1.5)+(Mo*10*2.204622622*15)+(Zn*10*2.204622
622*0.8)+(Au*(550/31.10348))+(Ag*(10/31.10348)))/1.5)/(2.204622622*10)) 

 
The formula incorporates the five principal elements of economic interest; copper, molybdenum, 
gold, silver and zinc. The formula does not incorporate recoveries (ie assumes a 100% recovery 
of all metals) and is based on pricing assumptions which reflect a reasonable net-back price at 
the mine gate at current metal values. In determining the copper equivalent cut-offs the zinc 
values were set to zero.  
 
The pricing assumptions used in the formula were provided by Tyler Resources and are as 
follows: 
 

Table 13.13:      Pricing Assumptions In 
the Copper Equivalent  

Metal Commodity Prices 
Copper (Cu) US$1.50/lb 

Molybdenum (Mo) US$15.00/lb 
Gold (Au) US$550/oz 

Silver (Ag) US$10/oz 
Zinc (Zn) US$0.80/lb 

 
The conversion factors used were; 1 kilogram (kg) =2.2046226 avoir pounds (lb) and 1 Troy 
ounce (oz) = 31.10348 gram (g). 
 
As an example, using a =0.20% CuEq in the measured mineral resource category the input 
grades to the formula would be: 0.39% Cu, 0.008% Mo, 0.04 g/t Au, 3.42 g/t Ag and 0.41% Zn 
yielding a copper equivalent grade of 0.53% and a copper zinc equivalent grade of 0.75%. 
 
On May 23, 2007 (filed on SEDAR) Tyler Resources Inc. released a resource estimate for the 
Bahuerachi Deposit prepared by Associated Geosciences Ltd.. The public disclosure of a 
resource estimate on a material property where there has been >100% change from a previously 
reported mineral resource estimate triggers a requirement within National Instrument 43-101 to 
complete and file an independent technical report in support of the resource estimate within 45 
days.  
 
During the preparation of this report a number of errors were identified in the copper equivalent 
formula including an incorrect conversion factor where a conversion of kilogram to pounds 
(Troy) was used instead of pounds (Avoir), an incomplete term in the denominator and the 
misplacement of a bracket. The impact of the error affected the contribution of metal values to 
the copper equivalent grade.

July 9, 2007   

 

 
Subsequent to the press-release, at the request of Tyler, a number of changes were made to make 
the resource estimate more useful to the scoping study. Gold was added to the calculation of 
copper equivalent at a price of US$550/oz. The price of silver was increased from US$7/oz to 
US$10/oz and the price of molybdenum increased from US$10/lb to US$15/lb. As well a 
copper-zinc equivalent grade was calculated for each copper and copper equivalent cut-off using 
a price of US$0.80/lb. 
 
The formula was subsequently corrected and the mineral resources presented in this report have 
been updated to reflect the corrected formula and the requested changes.  
 
Where a final mineral resource estimate supported by a technical report differs from a previously 
disclosed estimate, NI 43-101 requires that the two estimates be reconciled.  
 
The overall tonnes and grades at a 0% copper equivalent cut-off for the individual elements in all 
mineral resource categories have not changed, however, the revised numbers reflect a reduction 
of the tonnes and an increase in the copper grades assigned at various copper equivalent cut-offs 
(particularly above a 0.20% CuEq). There has also been a slight reduction in the copper 
equivalent grade at any particular copper and copper equivalent cut-off. 
 
13.5 Resource Classification 
 
The resource was classified into measured, indicated and inferred category.  This categorization 
was based on various factors.   These factors included the variogram ranges obtained, sample to 
block estimation distances and number of samples used in the estimation process for the Cu 
values which are deemed to be the most important for this project.  Table 13.14 below depicts 
the classification criteria used for the resource.

16.0 INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
16.1 Interpretations  
 

â€¢ Work to date has outlined a mineralized complex with overall surface widths and 
grades comparable to that of historical or present economic producers within a 
mineralized porphyry-style complex. Both high grade skarns and a stockworked, 
mineralized porphyritic intrusion of significant extent have been outlined by 
surface work to date on the Main Zone of the property. 
 

â€¢ The presence of mineralized outcrops over a wide topographic range along the 
system, relatively numerous and extensive historical underground workings and 
the 1997 drilling data outline the fact that significant continuity  both at depth, 
and, areally can be expected within the system.   
 

â€¢ The presence of mineralization similar to or potentially genetically related to that 
seen at the Main Zone outline ore forming processes active over an area of more 
than 25 km2. 
 

â€¢ In many instances, the isolated nature of particular mineralized zones is a function 
of lack of data at this time. The potential exists for the Mina Mexicana, Main 
Zone and Colome showings to all be part of a larger complex which would span 
some 3.5 km in length and up to1 km in width. Several areas have been 
demonstrated to contain mineralization of potentially economic grade. Similarly, 
potential continuity between the San Juan and San Marcos occurrences as well as 
between the Cuesta Colorada and Los Alisos occurrences are promising 
exploration targets. Numerous other grassroots stage copper and gold occurrences 
have been identified on the property. 

 
16.2 Conclusions  
 

â€¢ Sufficient resources have been identified to warrant continued exploration and to 
complete a scoping level study of the merits of placing the project into 
production. 

 
â€¢ During the preparation of this report a number of errors were identified in the 

copper equivalent formula which affected the contribution of metal values to the 
copper equivalent grade. The formula was subsequently corrected and the mineral 
resources presented in this report have been updated to reflect the corrected 
formula and the requested changes.

â€¢ Where a final mineral resource estimate supported by a technical report differs 
from a previously disclosed estimate, NI 43-101 requires that the two estimates be 
reconciled.  

 
â€¢ The overall tonnes and grades at a 0% copper equivalent cut-off for the individual 

elements in all mineral resource categories have not changed, however, the 
revised numbers reflect a reduction of the tonnes and an increase in the copper 
grades assigned at various copper equivalent cut-offs (particularly above a 0.20% 
CuEq). There has also been a slight reduction in the copper equivalent grade at 
any particular copper and copper equivalent cut-off. 

 
â€¢ There continue to be survey issues relating to drill hole collar elevations that 

require a very high level of field supervision of data reduction.

17.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

â€¢ The scoping level study currently underway should be completed to 
establish the viability of project development. 

 
â€¢ Further in-fill drilling will be required to upgrade the mineral resource 

categories reported here- in. 
 

â€¢ Further drilling will be required to assess the grade and tonnage of the 
mineralized sedimentary units and the chalcocite blanket. 

 
â€¢ The reduction of field survey data should be supervised by an 

independent expatriate surveyor.
