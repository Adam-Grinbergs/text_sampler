1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The project area straddles the northern spur of the Goldsmith Mountain, southeast of 
the confluence of Boyd Creek and the Incommapleaux River.  The lower portions of the 
property are covered with a dense forest of fir, spruce, cedar, pine, and alder.  The 
underbrush is mostly willow, alder and devil's club.  Thin overburden occurs on the 
higher elevations and above tree line of the claims. 

The MAMMOTH Property is within the northern part of the Badshot Range, which is 
within the rugged Selkirk Mountains, 20 km north of Camborne and 70 km southeast of 
Revelstoke, British Columbia. (Figure 1 & 2). 

The coordinates of the claims are 50o 52' 30" N latitude and 117o 34' 10" W longitude 
and are located on NTS Map Sheet 93 K/13 BC. 

The topography of the project area is steep to extremely rugged, consisting of ridges 
trending roughly east west, generally parallel to the drainage pattern.  Relief is of the 
order of 2133 m vertically with the highest mountains approaching 2743m.  Steep faced 
cirques, knife-edge ridges, and cliffs over 100m are common above 1200m.

The project area lies within a series of lower Paleozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks 
of the Lardeau Group, which is underlain by the Badshot Formation and Hamill Group. 

The claims were acquired by: Silver Phoenix Resources Inc. of Canoe B.C. from William 
Murray of Canoe and Leland Voll.  Access is via helicopter from Revelstoke.   

Access is via about 50 km of gravel road north from Nakusp to Camborne.  From 
Camborne, the property can be reached by Jet boat on the Incommapleaux River.  At 
this point a steep trail commences a steep 3500 ft climb up a narrow ridge then drops 
500 ft to the main (BIG Showing).  A logging road runs just west of the property. 

Three main areas of mineralization occur on the property: 
 1. The Big showing formerly the Ruby Silver Showing. 
 2. The Scout Showing 
 3. The Mammoth Showing 

The Big Showing consists of two zones of galena-sphalerite mineralization, which 
occurs as patches and disseminations over widths of 4.57-7.62 m (lower) and 3.05-
12.19m (upper) and is within the hinge zone of a parasitic anticlinal fold.  The lower 
zone occurs at 1400-2133 metres and the upper zone occurs at 1463-1508 metres.  
Assays for both zones are reported at 10% lead, 1% zinc and 0.5-oz/ton silver.   

Leask (1984) suggests there is evidence for a distal volcanogenic origin.  The 
mechanism for deposition is similar to that which produced the Red Sea Brines in 
Africa.

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 4



The Scout Showing consists of galena, sphalerite, and pyrite, which occur within the 
silicified carbonates of the hinge zone as patches and disseminations.  Massive 
galena shoots up to 1.5 metres wide and 7.64 metres long were en countered in the 
Scout 76 metre long drift.  The showings occur at 1768-1829 metres.  Assays 
reported from the Scout Showing run as high as 55.5% lead, 58.4 oz/ton silver and 
0.1 oz/ton gold, Newton Emmons, 1914.   A grab sample reported in Leask 1984, ran 
19.6% lead, 14.1 oz/ton silver and 0.092 oz/ton gold. 

The Mammoth Showing consists of several showings of galena, sphalerite, 
tetrahedrite, and argentite in flat lying cross fractures in the carbonate unit within 33 
metres of the Scout Fault.  The showings are located at elevations of 2255 to 2438 
metres.

Discovery of the initial showing on this property was in the summer of 1906 by the 
Edward Ballie Syndicate of Nelson B.C.  Production amounted (Mammoth) to 765 
tonnes of hand sorted "ore" that yielded 249 grams of gold, 484 kilograms of silver, 
23 tonnes of lead and 1.95 tonnes of zinc (MINFILE).  Several adits and small 
diggings occur on the property. 

Property evaluations and reserve calculations by H.A. Simmons (International) 
Ltd. and W.J. Olsson Associates Ltd. were carried out.  Reserves, presumably in 
the Big Showing, were estimated at 239,885 tons probable at 22 oz/ton Ag. And 
439,693 possible at 14 oz/ton Ag plus values of gold lead and zinc.  The MINFILE 
Inventory Report for February 28, 2002 report for 1987 on the Big Showing 
217,620 tonnes Ag Indicated @ 754.00 g/t and 398,833 tonnes Ag Inferred @ 
480.00 g/t. (MINFILE Database 2002). 

The author cannot confirm these results, as they do not conform to the N.I. 
43-101 section.  These results can only be considered as historical and are 
only presented in that context.  The author cannot find in the literature any 
evidence of drilling in the Big Showing area.  

In 2005 the author conducted sampling in the area of the SCOUT showing and results 
are:

Clearly it can be concluded that there are some economic grades in this area.

The 2005 assessment work done totaled $9,529.

In 1987 a field study was conducted to further evaluate the Mammoth Claim Group on 
Mount Goldsmith.  The results showed promise for the mining of minerals such as silver 
and gold, (Letter to Shareholders Campbell Island Mines Ltd. Annual Report 1987). 

The project warrants continued exploration.  The following program is recommended: 

A Phase I program should include a detailed compilation of all data on the property.
Most of the pre-existing data is not digital and not in any consistent coordinate system.
This compilation should be done prior to the field-work. Satellite imagery and detailed 
topography should also be purchased. Road building should be considered prior to 
drilling.

Phase I should also include detailed mapping and sampling. 

No geophysics or drilling is recommended for Phase I.  The above program is estimated 
to cost CAD $ 77,831.

The 2006 assessment work done totaled $10,000 

In 2007 Discovery Consultants of Vernon BC contracted R. I. Thompson to conduct 
mapping and sampling of the Big Showing Area.  His report is reproduced as Appendix 
I. His conclusions are not inconsistent with the authors.  The author did not 
examine the Big Showing in 2005. An assessment report is being compiled. 

The 2007 assessment work done totaled $9,569.15 

The purpose of the study is to identify geological structures.  Structures that may be 
associated with gold occurrences in a belt of mostly mixed Paleozoic sediments and 
minor greenstones. 

Numerous geological features, mostly linear and curvilinear, are identified.  Most are 
considered likely to represent structures in bedrock.

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 6

The principle recommendation is to review the location of known base metal and silver 
occurrences in relation to the linears and other features identified from this study.



Features, especially major linears associated with gold, silver or base metal, can then 
be used to guide further exploration.   A study of the glacial eskers and drumlins can aid 
in geochemical sampling.   Large curvilinears or circular features are useful for targeting 
regional uplifts.  These uplifts can be important in the search for buried intrusives.  
Major linears especially where they may form a regional rift is an excellent exploration 
tool in the search for these types of deposits. 

Features that are promising for gold, silver or base metal occurrences include: 
Intersection points of major linears. 

Linear offsets. 

Areas where linears are abundant and of sufficient length to suggest a regional break. 

Areas where there are abundant linears of all types suggesting block faulting. 

A two Phase success orientated program should include a detailed compilation of all 
data on the property. 

Phase 1. 
Most of the pre-existing data is not digital and not in any consistent coordinate system.
Existing maps should be scanned and digitized.  Detailed air photos and satellite 
images should be acquired. 

1. Provisions should be made to gain better access to the property this would 
include building a road. 

2. All existing soil and geophysics grids should be re-located and plotted in the 
UTM coordinate system. 

3. Detailed mapping and sampling should be done on the three mineralized 
zones.  Old adits should be located etc. 

   Estimated Cost $249,306
Phase 2: 
  1.  A geophysical survey consisting of EM and VLF.  The lower levels as well as 
the upper levels of the property should be investigated. 

  2.  Trenching followed by drilling can then proceed. 
    
   Estimated Cost $510,000

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

2.1 Qualified Person and Participating Personnel

The following report was commissioned by Silver Phoenix Resources Inc. to summarize 
the geology and mineralization of the MAMMOTH gold property near Revelstoke in 
northeastern British Columbia.  James A. Turner was retained to summarise the 
geology, structure and gold potential for MAMMOTH Property in a form consistent with 
NI 43-101.  In December 2006 Silver Phoenix Resources Inc. commissioned James A. 
Turner, P.Geo., to conduct a Linear Interpretation of SPOT-5 satellite data of the 
MAMMOTH Project. James A. Turner is the sole author of this report.  

2.2 Terms, Definitions and Units  

All costs contained in this report are denominated in Canadian dollars. The term "ppm" 
refers to parts per million or grams per metric tonne and "ppb" refers to parts per billion 
or milligrams per metric tonne. The symbol "%"refers to weight percent unless stated 
otherwise.  All other units are imperial except where noted.  Cell claims refers to claims 
acquired by map "staking".  These cells can be acquired over the Government of British 
Columbia' s website MTO Online (www.mtonline.gov.bc.ca/).  A group of cells form a 
claim.  In the MAMMOTH area a cell is about 40 ha.  Legacy claims are ground staked 
claims acquired before map staking came into force.

2.3 Source Documents 

Limited previous data were also reviewed and incorporated as noted, including records 
of previous drifting, mining, trenching, rock-chip sampling and of a soil geochemistry 
survey completed between 1980 and 1984 by operators not affiliated with Silver 
Phoenix Resources.  Previous assessment reports were also relied upon. 

2.4 Limitations, Restrictions and Assumptions 

James A. Turner did not fully audit or test the accuracy or completeness of data 
collected by Silver Phoenix.  In addition, Silver Phoenix Resources have informed the 
author that, to the best of their knowledge, no events have occurred, other than those 
taken into account in the report, which might, in their opinion, cause us to change our 
views.

2.5 Scope of Review 

To accomplish this review, James A. Turner, was asked to complete an evaluation of 
the exploration history, geology, mineralization and gold potential and conduct a Linear 
Interpretation of SPOT-5 satellite data of the MAMMOTH Property controlled by Silver 
Phoenix Resources Inc. of Canada.  James A. Turner has no financial or other interests 
in Silver Phoenix Resources or the property. 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 8



James A. Turner completed 1 day of rock-chip sampling in the project area in August 
2005; 6 rock-chip samples were collected.  No metallurgical testing was conducted.  
James A. Turner has done a brief review of legal documentation and ownership and has 
assumed that the presented facts are correct. 

2.6 Purpose of Investigation

This report describes the features observed from a study of an SPOT-5 
Satellite image over the MAMMOTH Project Area.  The study was 
commissioned by William Murray of Canoe B.C., Canada. 

This study consists of four parts: 

Part 1: Focuses on Satellite imagery, the task was to make detail maps of 
the area. All the data was corrected using a second order ortho-
correction using TRIM data. Various filters and enhancements were 
done to create a useable image with a resolution of 2.5 metres.  The 
final images were then used to generate maps of the area.

Part 2: Focuses on outlining the linears observed on the satellite image 
maps. The task was to trace linears on the images and then transfer 
them into AutoCad drawings.

Part 3: Focuses on identification of linear features, the task is to identify 
linear features that may be indicative of faults and fractures in 
bedrock.  Precious and Base metal deposits are associated with 
structures of various types, including major rifting and uplifting.

Part 4: Focuses on the compilation of all data completed by the various 
government agencies, the task is to analyse the results of the above 
study and combine them with certain supplied data, such as 
geophysics and geology. Part 4 is not included with this report.

Image Description

The Satellite scene was Geocoded, using a first order algorithim.  The 
data was also levelled to show a spectral resolution of 0-255 greyscale.  
The resulting image was then filtered and enhanced and used as a base 
to make maps of the area.  The SPOT-5 image covers the entire area.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 9

Information sources provided in the references section of this report and the authors' 
examination has been relied upon in preparing the current summary.  This has been 
supplemented by meetings with senior staff and on-site with the owner of the claims. On 
August 22, 2005, a site visit was conducted on the MAMMOTH Property. 



In arriving at our conclusions, we reviewed and relied to some extent upon the 
documents listed in the reference section of this report.  Some drawings were obtained 
from a report by:  I. Braovic, which were based on original mine and assay plans.  The
author did not obtain original plans or assays.  The author also reviewed the preliminary 
results from the 2007 silt and rock geochemical survey conducted by Discovery 
consultants. 

4.0 CHARACTERISTICS AND USES OF SATELLITE DATA 

SPOT-5
The following description is from the SPOT-5 website
http://spot5.cnes.fr/gb/index2.htm

The SPOT satellites orbit the Earth at an altitude of 822 kilometres at the Equator. To 
maintain a constant resolution, this orbit is circular.  To be able to acquire images of any 
point on the globe, the orbit is near polar. In other words, because of the Earth's rotation 
the sub-satellite point follows a regular pattern of ground tracks on the Earth's surface. 
The orbit is also phased so that the satellite passes over the same point every 26 days. 
The satellite thus repeats the same ground tracks and the maximum distance between 
adjacent tracks at the Equator is 108 kilometres. The combined field of view of the two 
instruments in twin-vertical configuration is 117 kilometres, so the entire Earth can be 
covered in a single 26-day cycle. 
Lastly, the orbit is Sun-synchronous so that solar illumination conditions vary as little as 
possible. The orbital plane forms a constant angle relative to the Sun direction and the 
satellite passes over any given point at the same local time within two minutes. The 
Equator crossing time is 10:30 a.m.

SPOT satellite ground tracks (one day)

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 10

SPOT 5 will join SPOT 1, SPOT 2 and SPOT 4 on the same orbit. Each satellite is 
phased relative to the others to optimize repeat image acquisition and to allow receiving 
stations and the CMP operations control centre to track the satellites without introducing 
additional operational constraints. 



The satellite reaches its final orbital position after a series of manoeuvres. The orbit 
emplacement strategy, which allows for the degree of orbit injection error due to the 
launch vehicle and for constraints imposed by operations on the other SPOT satellites, 
is designed to keep the positioning phase as short as possible and to conserve 
propellant for manoeuvres. 

Spectral bands for Earth observation applications are selected on the basis of: 
spectral response-that is, the specific nature of signals reflected or emitted across a 
range of wavelengths-of features of interest, for example rocks and soils, vegetation, 
deserts, snow, moisture and urban areas
atmospheric transparency and transmission stability, which can only be sufficiently 
ensured within certain spectral "windows"
SPOT 5 bands in the visible and short-wave infrared portions of the spectrum are 
identical to those on SPOT 4:

panchromatic (wide band): 0.49 to 0.69 µm
visible B0: 0.43 to 0.47 µm (on VEGETATION only)
visible B1: 0.50 to 0.59 µm
visible B2: 0.61 to 0.68 µm
visible B3: 0.78 to 0.89 µm
short-wave infrared (SWIR): 1.58 to 1.75 µm

Spectral bands and resolution of SPOT 5 instruments  

*Imagery at a resolution of 2.5 metres in the 
panchromatic band is obtained using a sampling 
concept unique to SPOT 5, called Supermode. This 
concept processes two 5-metre panchromatic images 
acquired simultaneously to generate a single image at 
a resolution of 2.5 metres. 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 11



The new SPOT 5 satellite is designed to ensure SPOT data users continuity of service, 
enhanced image quality and improved services. 

The two new HRG instruments, derived from the HRVIR instruments on SPOT 4, offer 
higher resolution: 2.5 metres to 5 metres in panchromatic mode and 10 metres in 
multispectral mode. Imagery at a resolution of 2.5 metres is generated using a new 
sampling concept dubbed "Supermode".
SPOT 5 features a new HRS imaging instrument operating in panchromatic mode. HRS 
points forward and aft of the satellite, giving it the ability to acquire stereo-pair images 
almost simultaneously to map relief.

SPOT 5 is also carrying the recurrent VEGETATION 2 instrument and the DORIS 
instrument.

The SPOT 5 bus is also derived from SPOT 4. A new star tracker will improve image 
location accuracy from 350 metres on previous satellites to just 50 metres.

Terms Used to Describe Linear Features 

Linear features shown on the satellite imagery are caused by geomorphic 
features and tonal contrast or differences.  Typically linears on an image 
indicate: topographic features (rivers, streams, glacial deposits, etc.) 
and/or bedrock features (changes in rock or soil type, structural breaks, 
etc.).  Linear features can be enhanced or suppressed using a variety of 
filters.   Definitions used in this section are summarised below. 

A linear feature expresses line-like characteristics of surface features or 
roughness without structural implications. 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 14

A curvilinear feature expresses full or partial circular features on an 
image without inferring structure. 



A lineament is a mappable feature or series of linear features that align in 
a straight or slightly curving manner and are distinctive from the patterns 
of adjacent features.  Generally a lineament expresses a subsurface, 
structural phenomenon. 

A linear intersection is a point where two or more linears or lineaments 
intersect.

North-South and East-West linears are referred to as such and labelled 
"N-S" and "E-W" respectively.  The convention adopted for naming linears 
that are not trending along the cardinal points of the compass is to refer to 
their north-hemisphere orientation.  For example, a linear trending 
Northeast-Southwest is labelled "NE" and referred to as "Northeast" (i.e. 
not "Southwest"). 

5.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION (Figure 1 & 2) 

5.1  Location

The MAMMOTH Property is within the northern part of the Badshot Range, which is 
within the rugged Selkirk Mountains, 20 km north of Camborne, British Columbia. 

The coordinates of the claims are 50o 52' 30" N latitude and 117o 34' 10" W longitude 
and are located on NTS Map Sheet 93 K/13 BC.  This map is presented on the UTM 
projection in grid zone 11.  The horizontal datum is NAD 83 and the vertical datum is 
NGVD 1929.

5.2 Property Description

The property forms a continuous block of 4 mineral claims totaling 1285.524 hectares 
and is located in the Revelstoke Mining Division of central British Columbia. Three of 
these claims are legacy claims the Big Showing, Mammoth and Scout, the Ruby Silver

Mineral claims in British Columbia may be kept in good standing by applying 
assessment work, on or before the anniversary date.   The date of a purchase and sale 
agreement is February 14, 2003.  There are two vendors under this agreement; Bill 
Murray and Leland Voll. 

6.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

6.1  Access 

Access is via about 50 km of gravel road north from Nakusp to Camborne , thence by 
logging road.  From Camborne the property can be reached by Jet boat on the 
Incommapleaux River.  At this point a steep trail commences a steep 1067 m climb up a 
narrow ridge then drops 152 m to the main (BIG Showing).  In August the Mammoth 
showing was visited via helicopter from Revelstoke.  Logging roads provide access to 
some areas near Camborne.  As at the time of the property visit these roads were 
grown over.  Logging activity occurred some 20 years earlier. 

6.2   Climate and Physiography 

The project area straddles the northern spur of the Goldsmith Mountain, southeast of 
the confluence of Boyd Creek and the Incommapleaux River.  The lower portions of the 
property are covered with a dense forest of fir, spruce, cedar, pine, and alder.  The 
underbrush is mostly willow, alder and devil's club.  Very few outcrops occur in the area, 
which is covered by thick layers (up to 200 m) of drift and glacial till.  Thin overburden 
occurs on the higher elevations and above tree line of the claims. 

The topography of the project area is steep to extremely rugged, consisting of ridges 
trending roughly east west, generally parallel to the drainage pattern.  Relief is of the 
order of 2133 m vertically with the highest mountains approaching 2743 m.  Steep faced 
cirques, knife-edge ridges, and cliffs over 100 m are common above 1219 m.

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 16



The area is within the Interior Wet Belt where precipitation exceeds an average of 100 
cm per year.  Winters, in the area are usually severe and bring several feet of snow-
pack.  The highest average temperatures occur in July at 23o C and average lowest 
temperatures occur in January at –20o C (night).   

The field season lasts from early June to the latter part of October.

6.3  Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Nakusp (pop. 3,000), is one of the administrative and logistical centres of the region and 
offers many basic services such as food stores, fuel and lumber supplies.  Hellicopter 
services and small aircraft are also available.  Nakusp is connected to the south via 
highway 5 and to the north via highway 6.  Revelstoke (pop. 9000) is the major city in 
the area.  It is serviced by road, and rail from Vancouver. 
There are no apparent serious impediments to exploration in the form of surface rights 
alienation, but this would require careful checking before any development work was 
contemplated. At present, electrical power is not available on the property, but power 
lines are within 40 km.  In the event of mining activities, there appear to be ample sites 
for processing facilities, waste storage areas, or tailing ponds. 

7.0 HISTORY 

Discovery of the initial showing on this property was in the summer of 1906 by the 
Edward Ballie Syndicate of Nelson B.C.  Production amounted (Mammoth) to 765 
tonnes of hand sorted "ore" that yielded 249 grams of gold, 484 kilograms of silver, 
23 tonnes of lead and 1.95 tonnes of zinc (MINFILE).  The Big Showing is listed in 
MINFILE as the 12th largest major silver deposit in the province with no production. 
The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company (now Teck-Cominco) optioned the 
property in the summer of 1913 but little work was done before 1914.

In circa 1920 a tunnel was started and a description follows, from the Report of the 
minister of mines for 1920: SEE Figure 2. 

"The vein outcrops on the west side of the creek and is somewhat similar to 
character to that of the Scout, except that the sulphides are exposed on the 
surface, due to the action of erosion at this point keeping pace with that of 
oxidation.  It conforms to the stratification of the enclosing rocks and can be 
traced for many thousands of feet. The surface exposure at the outcrop is rightly 
called a "big showing." the width of the mineralized ledge being about 50 feet in 
which a considerable quantity of galena occurs in patches and disseminations in a 
quartz gangue. The Intervening bands of barren material are stained to places with 
oxide of Iron.  At this point the line of the surface cuts the vein at an angle which is 
hot normal to the dip; hence the true width is not represented and is about 20 feet. 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 17

Ore can be traced for some distance up the hill until the vein becomes covered.  It is 
reported that ore has been found in a precipitous bluff near the summit.  A sample of the 



galena from the surface ran: Gold, trace; silve,r 1.6 oz.; lead, 23.5 per cent.; zinc, 1.5 
per cent.  A sample of the iron-stained ledge-matter ran: Gold, trace; silver, trace; lead, 
nill; zlnc, 4 per cent. 

At an elevation of about 5,000 feet and at a vertical distance of 300 feet below the 
surface showing a tunnel has been driven for 171 feet.  The first 66 feet of which follows 
a course of S 20O E., and the next 105 feet due south.  In driving this tunnel they did 
not allow for the dip of the vein, and it is therefore in the foot-wall side.  When this was 
recognized a crosscut was started at a point 126 feet from the portal and was driven in 
a direction of N 80O  E. for 42 feet; it was abandoned within about 20 feet of the vein. 
For prospecting purposes this tunnel-site is well chosen, but for operating the property 
on a large scale a more favourable site might be obtainable at a lower altitude and in a 
more accessible place." 

The advent of World War I halted exploration on the property. The ground became 
open in 1973 when the Leask Syndicate staked it. Their claims lapsed in the fall of 
1977 but were re-staked in the spring of 1978: the claims lapsed on May 28th 1979.
On May 29th, 1979 eighteen units were located using the modified grid system.
Detailed mapping and prospecting commenced in the first part of June 1979 and 
continued until the end of July 1979. An additional 4 units comprising the Goldy 
group were tied on to the existing group July 21st, 1979.  

In the early 1980's, the Big Showing and the Scout were re-staked as the A to F 
group of six 2-post claims.  The property was held by P. F. Explorations Ltd. and 
subsequently optioned to summer 90 Resources Ltd. and re-optioned to New 
Campbell Island Mines Ltd.  Work in the following years included geological 
mapping and geochemical soil and rock sampling.  

Property evaluations and reserve calculations by H.A. Simmons (International) 
Ltd. and W.J. Olsson Associates Ltd. were carried out.  Reserves, presumably in 
the Big Showing, were estimated at 239,885 tons probable at 22 oz/ton Ag. And 
439,693 possible at 14 oz/ton Ag plus values of gold lead and zinc.  The MINFILE 
Inventory Report for February 28, 2002 report for 1987 on the Big Showing 
217,620 tonnes Ag Indicated @ 754.00 g/t and 398,833 tonnes Ag Inferred @ 
480.00 g/t. (MINFILE Database 2002). 

The author cannot confirm these results, as they do not conform to the N.I. 
43-101.  These results can only be considered as historical and are only 
presented in that context.  The author cannot find in the literature any 
evidence of drilling on the MAMMOTH PROPERTY.  

In 1987 a field study to further evaluate the Mammoth Claim Group on Mount 
Goldsmith.  The results showed promise for the mining of minerals such as silver and 
gold, (Letter to Shareholders Campbell Island Mines Ltd. Annual Report 1987). 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 18



In 2005 James A Turner, in the company of Bill Murray et al. conducted a property visit
to the Mammoth property for the purpose of writing an assessment report.  The results 
of this report are in BC Assessment Report # 28321.  A summary is presented 
throughout this report. 

Mr. Thompson while detail mapping collected 17 samples that were analysed for 35 
element ICP.  The results, although preliminary, show anomalous to strong values in 
Ag, Pb, Zn and Cu.

8.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING as summarized by Leask 1984 

8.1 Regional Geological Setting (Figure 3) 

The MAMMOTH Property, formerly the Ruby Silver and Goldy claim groups is located in 
the Lardeau portion of the Kootenay Are. Regional geology was compiled by Peter 
Read for the Geological Survey of Canada at a scale of 1:250,000.

The project area of this study lies within a series of lower Paleozoic sedimentary and 
volcanic rocks of the Lardeau Group, which is underlain by the Badshot Formation and 
Hamill Group. These regional units are described below. 

Hamill Group (Lower Cambrian) 

Hamill group comprises a thick sequence of quartzitic rocks beneath the Badshot 
Formation.  One member, the Marsh Adams Formation outcrops north of Boyd Creek 
where it contacts the Battle Range Batholith disconformably. The Marsh Adams 
Formation consists of quartzite, micaceous quartzite and phyllite. This is overlain by the 
Mohican Formation which consists of phyllite and limestone. 

Badshot Formation (Lower Cambrian) 

The Badshot Formation overlies the Mohican Formation conformably. The lithology 
consists mainly of grey, thick bedded to massive micritic limestone.  Lenses of marble 
are observed within the limestone and commonly contain black argillaceous material.
Algal pellets and Archeocyathids have been found in several locations by James T. 
Files (1964).  The northern extent of the Badshot Formation is just north of the 
confluence between Boyd Creek and the Incommapleaux River. It has thinned 
down to a few tons of feet at this point from a thickness of over 900 feet (274.74 
m) southeast of Duncan Lake.  

Lardeau Group (lower Paleozoic) 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 19

Lardeau Group overlies the Badshot limestone and includes a great thickness 
of sedimentary and volcanic rocks. This sequence is un-fossiliferous and highly 
deformed. Detailed stratigraphy (Fyles and Eastwood, 1962) was determined 



by sufficient observations of graded bedding between the Alkolkolex River and 
the Incommapleaux River.  Only the lowermost member the Index Formation is 
of interest in this study-because it hosts the Ruby Silver and Goldy 
mineralization and comprises all the units mapped on the 1:10,000 detailed 
property maps.

Battle Range Intrusions (Cretaceous) 

Battle Range Batholith intrudes the Hamill and Lardeau groups about three 
miles north of the Ruby silver showing. The intrusion is composite; the southern 
portion consists of a biotite-hornblende quartz monzonite containing sodic 
andesine but the main body of the batholith is a muscovite-biotite granodiorite 
with calcic oligoclase. A pyritiferous alaskite is present in the central portion of 
the batholith. 

8.2 Project Geology (Figure 4)  

Overall structure on detailed map consists of a series of nearly upright folds within 
the lower Paleozoic Lardeau group. Observations of graded bedding; (Fyles and 
Eastwood, 1962) have served to indicate the stratigraphic order, as no fossils have 
been found in this group to date. All members except the uppermost unit, unit 4, 
exhibit lateral facies changes between the lithologies contained within them 
lithologies present in stratigraphic succession from lowest to highest are 
(1)  Unit1A, a quartz, grit and green gritty phyllitic, 
(2)  Unit 1B, gray-green and light green phyllit ic siltstone, 
(3) Unit 2A, lead-zinc mineralization with associated silicification, 
(4) Unit 2B, mangano-siderite with massive magnetite-hematite and lead
zinc,
(5) Unit 3A, gray sugary limestone, 
(6) Unit 3B, gray graphitic limestone with thinly interbedded dark graphit ic             
phyl l i tes,
(7)  Unit 4, dark green phyllite to and greenstone.  

Stratigraphy: 

Stratigraphy of the Index Formation sedimentary and volcanic rocks is well exposed on 
the Ruby Silver and Goldy claims in the amphitheater-like basins and on the narrow 
ridges. Dips are moderate to steep to the northeast, with some dip slopes being formed 
on the north facing slopes as a result of bedding and foliation orientation. 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 20

Unit 1, the lowermost member of the index Formation, is a mixture of quartz grit and 
green, chloritic, gritty phyllite; it has a thickness of approximately 800 feet. An upper 
sub--unit (Unit 1B) of gray-green and light green phyllite is lenticular in morphology and 
is not continuously present. This unit has a maximum thickness of 120 feet. In some 
places the contact between gritty phyllite and upper gray-green and light green phyllite 
is distinct, in other places it is gradational. Lenticular manganiferous siderite (Unit 2B), 
meta-chert and associated lead-zinc mineralization (Unit 2A) occur at the contact 



between Unit 1B and Unit 3A, a gray sugary limestone. This gray sugary limestone 
forms the lower part of Unit 3, the major carbonate unit. 

This lower division appears bleached near the lower contact and locally has a white 
sugary appearance. In other places, particularly on the ridge between the Ruby Silver 
and Goldy claims, rusty lenticular, lenses that contain up to two percent disseminated 
crystals of magnetite are found within the sugary limestone. The intermediate division, 
Unit 3B, is a gray graphitic limestone with thinly, interbedded dark graphitic phyllites and 
has, a maximum thickness of approximately 300 feet. 

The uppermost unit is a dark green phyllite and greenstone with rare pillows (Fyles and 
Eastwood, 1962).  This submarine volcanic unit is approximately 150 feet thick and 
conformably overlies the carbonate. 

8.3 Structure (Figure12)

Regionally, the stratified rocks of this area lie on the western limb of the Purcell 
Anticlinorium (Reesor, 1973).  Three phases of folding give rise to the map patterns 
observed.

The first phase of folding resulted in the recumbent southeast plunging 
Alkokolex Anticline (Fyles, 1962), which closes, to the northeast.  Sparse 
evidence of this event is preserved but where it exists, it is marked by 
rootless, isoclinal folds with well-developed axial plane foliation. Well-
developed cleavage, likely due to shear folding of the first event fans around 
phase two fold axes to some degree. 

Second phase folds are macroscopic and ubiquitous, and are largely 
responsible for the map distribution of rock units. These folds are commonly 
asymmetric with the majority being isoclinal. The F2 fold axes are defined on 
the stereo net plot by poles to F1 and F2 axial plane cleavage and minor 
fold axes. Some incompetent units are repeated within themselves by 
isoclinal folding as is well displayed on the precipitous cliff north of Goat Creek.  
Complexities of these structures are often so great that the original stratigraphy is 
no longer decipherable.  Competent units tend to be broken into lenses surrounded 
by well-cleaved incompetent, micaceous units.  Observed thicknesses give little 
indication of original stratigraphic thickness because of the high degree of flowage.
Some homoclines have been formed by attenuation during the later progression of 
the second folding event. 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 21

Only the lower overturned limb of the Alkokolex Anticline is observed in the study 
area, thus the stratigraphic sequence 13 overturned. The first two phases of folding 
were nearly coaxial with a trend of 148 degrees azimuth and plunge of 10 degrees. 
The two phases of folding are interpreted as a simple progression of a single stress 
configuration.  Later stages have deformed phase two axial planes and fold axes 



slightly about a roughly easterly trending fold axis with a plunge of 60 degrees. 

The observed faulting episode was post phase two folding and likely resulted from 
the natural progression of the stress condition that gave rise to F1 and F2 folds 
because the fault planes are nearly parallel to F2 axial planes. All observed fold 
vergences were consistent with the geologic and structural interpretation shown in 
Figure 1A. 

9.0 DEPOSIT TYPES modified after Leask 1984 

Lower Index formation clastics (Unit 1A) formed under conditions of high 
cratonic relief and were likely basinal slope deposits. The chlorite rich gray-
green and light green phyllitic siltstone likely reflects a deeper basin 
environment. Overlapping lateral facies changes resulted from multiple 
transgressions and regressions, although structural complexity complicates 
this interpretation. Massive chlorite at the base of the silicified ore zone 
(Unit 2A) reflects hydrothermal activity in the basin. Lead-zinc mineralization 
associated with silicification is precipitated from metalliferous brines 
originating from fissures at some depth in the basin. The manganiferous 
siderite horizon is generally stratigraphically y coincident with the lead-zinc 
mineralization but was precipitated more distally from the source of 
metalliferous brines. 

Speculatively, rates of influx of hydrothermal brines may have varied 
because of sea level changes and subsequent changes in hydrostatic head 
in the fissure system (Degens Ross, 1970). Mineralizing episodes appear to 
have been fairly closely followed by either uplift or regression of the sea. 
Gray micritic limestone (Unit 3A) was apparently deposited above the 
carbonate compensation depth, in an off-shelf environment, as pelagic ooze. 
Rusty lenticular lenses that contain up to two percent disseminated 
magnetite are present at several horizons within the gray limestone. These 
rusty horizons possibly represent several pauses in carbonate deposition 
with concomitant formation of insoluble residue by carbonate dissolution 
along these unconformities.  Transgressions of the sea resulted in more 
stagnant, deeper water conditions and deposition of graphitic carbonate with thinly 
interbedded black graphitic phyllites (Unit 3B).  Sea level regression followed, and
deposition of pelagic oozes became dominant again. 

Unit 4, volcanic greenstone and dark green phyllite formed in a submarine 
environment as flow rocks because rare pillows arc found. 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 22

10.0 MINERALIZATION, ALTERATION AND EXPLORATION

Three main areas of mineralization occur on the property: 
      1.  The Big Showing formerly the Ruby Silver Showing. 
      2.  The Scout Showing 



3. The Mammoth Showing 

The Big Showing consists two zones of galena-sphalerite mineralization, which 
occurs as patches and disseminations over widths of 15-25 feet (lower) and 10-40 
feet (upper) and is within the hinge zone of a parasitic anticlinal fold.  The lower zone 
occurs at 4600-4700 feet and the upper zone occurs at 4800-4950 feet.  Assays for 
both zones are reported at 10% lead, 1% zinc and 0.5 oz/ton silver.   

Leask (1984) suggests there is evidence for a distal volcanogenic origin.  The 
mechanism for deposition is similar to that which produced the Red Sea Brines in 
Africa.

The Scout Showing consists of galena, sphalerite, and pyrite, which occur within the 
silicified carbonates of the hinge zone as patches and disseminations.  Massive 
galena shoots up to 5 feet wide and 25 feet long were encountered in the Scout 76 
m long drift.  The showings occur at 1768-1829 metres.  Assays reported from the 
Scout Showing run as high as 55.5% lead, 58. 4 oz/ton silver and 0.1 oz/ton gold, 
Newton Emmons, 1914.   A sample reported in Leask 1984, ran 19.6% lead, 14.1 
oz/ton silver and 0.092 oz/ton gold. 

The Mammoth Showing consists of several showings of galena, sphalerite, 
tetrahedrite, and argentite in flat lying cross fractures in the carbonate unit within 33 
metres of the Scout Fault.  The showings are located at elevations of 2256 to 2438 
metres.

The Scout Fault apparently served as a conduit for digenetic mineralizing fluids that 
deposited sulphides along this structural trap.  These fluids are likely responsible for 
the massive silicification of the fault zone (Leask 1984). 

The Mammoth showings were observed and sampled by the writer in September 
2005.

10.1 Exploration (2005)

In the spring of 2005 Bill Murray and a helper conducted work for 6 days on the property:  

Work Performed: prospecting 

Date started June 3 /2006 
Date finished August 25/2006 

"I  Spent one day working on the Southeast side. 
The terrene is very steep, were able to travel a long way on the 4 wheeler as there is a logging 
road that cuts through the corner of the property .  The bush is very heavy going from the road to 
the property and then gets very steep. Spent most of the day in the trees. Did not find anything of 
interest.  

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 23



B] Spent one day working on the Northeast end of property. 
Not as steep in this area but did not find anything of interest other than an old claim post just off 
the road. 

C] Spent the day on the Northwest end of the property west of the creek. Terrene is very steep in 
this area and the only way to prospect it would be to come down from the top with a safety rope. 
Found lots of float. 

D] Spent one day working on the North end of property. 
Found some small veins in a couple spots on the east side of the creek about 300 meters from the 
road and 130 to 150 meters above the creek. Flagged the location. Took some samples but did 
not have them assayed. It was very steep going and we had to use a rope to get back down. 

E] Spent one day on the west side at north end of the property . There is an old trail on this side 
of the property that goes all the way to the top. We did not make it all the way to the top as we 
did not have enough time. Got just below what looked like an old helicopter landing. The trail is 
very steep and takes just about as long to go down as it does to go up.  The terrene is too steep 
here to put in a 4 wheeler trail. We found some float that someone earlier had flagged, did not 
take any samples. 

F]   Spent one day with helicopter on the southwest side with Jim Turner, and two other helpers 
and collected samples from and around some old workings. The terrene is very steep in this area. 
There is an old cabin still standing about 200 feet above the old workings and above the tree 
line."

In August, 2005 James A. Turner, P.Geo. Bill Murray and two prospectors examined the 
Mammoth Showings.

10.2  Exploration 2007 

In 2007 Discovery Consultants of Vernon BC contracted R. I. Thompson to conduct 
mapping and sampling of the Big Showing Area.  His report is reproduced as Appendix 
I. His conclusions are not inconsistent with the authors.  The author did not 
examine the Big Showing in 2005.  An assessment report is being compiled. 

Conclusions: after Thompson 

"This preliminary examination of the Big Showing and its vicinity suggests the 
following geological history:

 1) Lower Paleozoic hot spring activity associated with sea floor deposition of iron-
rich carbonate rocks as well as local concentrations of base and precious metals.  

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 24

2) Middle Jurassic (ca. 180 Ma) folding and metamorphism with attendant thinning of 
fold limbs and thickening of fold hinge zones.  



3) Sulphide-rich horizons are mobilized during folding, and crystallize in open spaces 
created by brittle deformation.

Location of the Big Showing on a steep dipping, long fold limb suggests structural 
thinning along the limb will have limited tonnage potential.  Local thickening of the host 
iron-rich marble succession into lenses up to 30 m wide and 100 long, has occurred in 
response to the competency contrast between the marble and adjacent, more 
competent siliceous phyllite. Despite limited along-dip extent, these lenses of marble 
may have significant strike length parallel to the trend of local fold axes.

The hinges of major fold structures provide the most fertile areas to explore for 
economic grades and tonnages of base metals.  An interpreted synclinal hinge, 
observed on the south-facing slope of the "peak 2179" showing, is such a structure and 
deserves assessment.  

The implication that base metals were originally laid down as stratigraphically controlled 
deposits (SEDEX-type) suggests the Big Showing is part of a regional system of fault 
controlled basins within the Lardeau trough. Exploration of iron-rich carbonate 
successions in the region could prove fruitful".

11.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

All geochemical sampling, of the MAMMOTH Property i.e. soil, rock and trench, was 
conducted by well-respected and competent geologists and geological engineers (see 
list of references). Details of sampling methods are found in the assessment reports 
describing each of the projects.  Sample sites were tagged in the field. Sample intervals 
were normally 5-20 metres apart. While previous grids were not found, most are over-
grown; the writer is of the opinion that the sampling method used was adequate 
considering the nature of the project and industry standards at the time. 

12.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY  

All trench and rock samples taken by James A. Turner were placed in plastic bags and 
closed with ties. Acme Analytical Laboratories Inc. completed the analysis.  The 
geochemical results were transmitted to the writer via e-mail.  Samples were delivered 
via the writer directly to the Lab. 

The rock samples were prepared by air-drying, then crushing to 10-mesh (<2 mm); a 
250 g portion was pulverized to 200-mesh (<75 microns). The sample pulps will be in 
locked facility for long-term storage.  Access to this facility is only through the particular 
Laboratory.

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 25

At Acme Analytical Laboratories, the samples were analyzed for 32 elements using two 
methods. Gold content was determined to the 0.2 ppb level using the Acme Group 3A 
wet digestion method. A 10 g sample was digested in Aqua Regia, and analyzed by 



Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass 
Spectroscopy (ICP-MS) finish. The Acme Group 1 D multi-element method was used on 
a minimum 1 g pulp to determine other elements and gold to the ppm level. In this 
method, the samples were digested in hot Aqua Regia and analyzed by Inductively 
Coupled Plasma Atomic 'Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). 

13.0 DATA VERIFICATION  

No sample data verification other than those provided by TSL (blanks, standards, 
duplicates) was included in the 2005 program.

These samples were taken in the area thought to be at or along strike from the SCOUT 
showing.  An adit was found: it was approx. 2m square at the opening and drifted down 
at an angle of 25-30o into the hill.  It appeared to be 3-5 m deep.  Some offset drifting 
was done, presumably to follow the structure.  The stratigraphy appeared to be 
stratabound galena, sphalerite and some chalcopyrite, mineralization.  It is not known if 
any production came from this adit.

The writer is familiar with the geochemical database and has verified locations of 
anomalies reported in the data with values as reported in the original assessment 



reports. Much of the sampling was done prior to implementation of National Instrument 
43-101 quality control measures and data verification procedures applied at that time 
may have varied from those now required under the Instrument. However, the 
analytical procedures and industry standards used at the time are considered 
adequate.

The writer has not verified the targets set out in the interpretation as snow conditions 
prevented a site visit.  A site visit is scheduled when weather conditions improve.  

14 .0  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The Property contains several high-grade silver, lead and zinc showings that are related 
to events similar to a distal volcanogenic model. 

The Big Showing; 
1)            Is a distal volcanogenic type 
2) Has been subjected to deformation and shearing 

The Scout and Mammoth Showings; 
3) Are related to a fault 
4) Have some stratabound component 

15.0  INTERPRETATION OF THE SPOT-5 IMAGE

Methods Applied

For this study, all major and minor linear features were outlined on the 
SPOT_5 image. The linears were then digitized using AutoCad 2005.  
While many features can be identified from the images, caution must be 
exercised in interpreting satellite data without follow-up field investigation 
or "ground truthing". Only ground investigation can determine whether 
features are structural, geological, topographic or cultural. 

Description of Linear Features

Linear and curvilinear features have been grouped by orientation and 
described in general terms below. The more significant individual linear 
and curvilinear features are labelled on Figures 6 to 9. Figure10 is a 
compilation of all linear features.  Figure11 are rose diagrams for each 
feature described below. The areas listed in above have been selected 
with the understanding that interpretation of structure from satellite images 
is only one of the numerous methods used in any exploration program. 
The localities listed below should be reviewed in the light of other data, 
particularly data derived from on-site examination. 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 27

- North-South and East-West linear features (Figure 6) Count 84 and 43 



 These linears are not abundant in the map area.  Linear NS-1 is 6 
km long and occurs in the northeast part of the SPOT-5 image; no 
EW linears occur here. Linear EW-1 is ~6 km long and occurs near 
the northwest boundary of the image area.  There are two areas 
where both NS and EW linears are abundant, near the Mammoth 
and near the Alma occurrences.

North—South linears trend from 3500 to 0000 azimuth and EW linears 
trend 0800 to 1000 azimuth.

- Northwest linear features (Figure 7) Count 193 
NW linears are the most abundant in the map area. Six linears or 
linear composites have been identified NW1-6.  Most linears are 
less than 3 km in length but several continuous linears can be 
traced for up to 6.5 km. i.e. NW-6. Most of these linears occur in the 
central portion of the image area, just southeast and southwest of 
the boundary of the claims. The ranges of NW linears are 3000 to 
3300 azimuth, with most of the linears in the 3100 to 3200.

- Northeast linear features (Figure 7) Count 56 
NE linears are not abundant on the image area. Most linears are 
short in the 1-2 km range. However Linear NE-1 is 6 km long.  It 
occurs in the Alma area, several NW linears also occur here. Linear 
intersections occur with NE-1 and NW-2-4.  Most linears occur at 
0400-0700 azimuth but they range from about 0300 to 0800 azimuth. 

- North-Northwest linear features (Figure 8) Count 109 
NNW linears are the second most abundant on the image area.
Linear NNW-1 can be traced continuously over 6km as linear NNW-
4 can be traced for 5 km.  Linears NNW- 2 and 3 are discontinuous 
and occur south and southeast of the Mammoth deposit.  High 
density linears also occur here. The linears range from 3200 to 3600
azimuth, but most are in the 3300 to 3400 range.

- North-Northeast linear features (Figure 8) Count=93 
NNE linears are mostly <3 km on the image area. One linear, 
NNE-4, can be traced discontinuously for up to 14 km.  This linear 
occurs in the north western part of the map area.  This linear 
intersects several NNW linears in the Mammoth area. North-
Northeast linears trends are over several azimuths from 0000 to 
0500, but most are in the 0100 to 0200 range. 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 28

- West Northwest linear features (Figure 9) Count 67
These linears are also not abundant in the map area and are 
generally <3 km length.  Only one linear is in the 4 km range i.e. 
WNW-1.  Several of these linears are discontinuous i.e. WNW -2 



and pass through the Mammoth property.   West Northwest linears 
trend from 2800 to 3000 azimuth but most trend 2800 to 3000.

- East Northeast linear features (Figure 9) Count 25 
These linears are not abundant in the map area.  They trend from 
0600 to 0900  azimuth, but most trend 0700 to 0800.

-  Curvilinear features 
  There are no curvilinear features recognized in the image area. 

Use of Linears

The greatest value of the satellite and magnetic features described in this 
report is to be derived from observing linears most closely related to 
precious or base metal occurrences or to geochemical anomalies. 
Features so identified can then be used to guide further exploration. 

The following structural features are considered positive for precious or 
base metal exploration: 

- rift valleys or evidence of hoarst and graben structures in the 
basement
-  linear intersections particularly those associated with the above 
-  areas of dense linears of all types 
-  small circular features especially those near linear intersections

16.0 CONCLUSIONS

Inspection of the various linear directions and the density of the linears (Figure 10, 11)
suggest that there are three areas of the study area that are prospective for base metal 
deposits.  The preferred orientation of linears is Northwest-Southeast, a direction of 
regional geologic trends.  Local orientations also suggest this preferred trend.  The 
Fergusson silver deposits are evident along this trend. 

1. The area outlined by the polygon 445605 E, 5632833 N to 453825 
E 5625792 N has several showings of silver and or gold.  The 
Camborne camp is near this area. 

2. The area outlined by the polygon 455500 E, 5631966 N to 
461412E, 5625295 N also has several showings and is located 
almost directly east of area 1. 

James A. Turner, P.Geo    MAMMOTH Property, B.C. 29

3. The are of the MAMMOTH property has also an abundance of 
linears of all types.  Mineralization here definitely occur along 
northwest-southeast faults.



A caution that all linears are not exposed and may be under 
overburden particularly in the Incomappleax River valley between 
area 1 and 2.  All possible linears may not get mapped. 

The mineralization that occurs in the area does have a preferred orientation.
Geologic mapping suggests that several prospective horizons occur on and 
around the property for silver enriched base metal deposits.  There exists 
sufficient evidence that more mineralization can be found on the MAMMOTH 
property.  

17.0 DATE 

The effective date of this report is December 6, 2007 

18.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

A two Phase success orientated program should include a detailed compilation of all 
data on the property. 

Phase 1. 

1. Most of the pre-existing data is not digital and not in any consistent coordinate 
system.

2. Existing maps should be scanned and digitized.

3. Detailed air photos and satellite images should be acquired. 

4. Provisions should be made to gain better access to the property this would 
include building a road. 

5. All existing soil and geophysics grids should be re-located and plotted in the 
UTM coordinate system. 

6. Detailed mapping and sampling should be done on the three mineralized 
zones.  Old adits should be located etc. 

Phase 2: 

  1.  A geophysical survey consisting of EM and VLF.  The lower levels as well as 
the upper levels of the property should be investigated. 

  2.  Trenching followed by drilling can then proceed.

Summary:

� Mineralization is hosted in an iron-rich carbonate succession of variable 
thickness.

� This succession is proximal to green, variegated phyllite. 

� A stratiform SEDEX-type origin is probable, based on the presence and extent of 
the host iron-rich carbonate.

� Tight, upright folds have influenced the distribution of the host iron-rich 
carbonate, creating "pinch and swell" shapes along fold limbs and complex
thickened zones in fold hinges. 

� Sulphide minerals, principally galena, pyrite and pyrrhotite occur as 
disseminations, crystal aggregates and vein fillings. 

� Steep terrain limits accessibility and mobility making cost versus benefit a crucial
concern when planning further evaluation of the area.

Recommendations:

� Comprehensive chip sampling in and around the Big Showing to better assess the 
economic potential of this occurrence. 

� Detailed mapping and chip sampling of the "peak 2176" and "gossan" showings 
to assess grade and tonnage potential (near-vertical exposures will require support 
from an experienced alpinist).

� Detailed geological mapping of the Fe-rich marble succession with emphasis on 
outlining the size, extent and grade of mineralized zones in addition to the known 
showings.

� A cost-benefit analysis of exploration, including drilling, of the Big Showing in 
light of the logistical challenges such a program would encounter.

� Reconnaissance north and south along the Big Showing trend, in search of more
accessible zones of mineralization.

Introduction:

The Big Showing (TN 390111) is located in northwest trending drainage near the 

confluence of the Incomappleux River with Boyd Creek (Fig. 1 in pocket).  Logging road 

access from Beaton, at the head of Northeast Arm, Upper Arrow Lake, has been 

interrupted by a slide. Helicopter access to the property from Revelstoke requires 

approximately 0.8-1.0 hr round trip.

A fly camp was established July 24, 2007 and removed the morning of July 27th. 

Two days were spent in the vicinity of the "peak 2179" showing1 (Figs. 1 and 2), 

evaluating rock types and structural styles, prospecting along-trend of the showing, and 

sampling the iron-rich marble succession. The third day was spent on the Big Showing 

(Figs. 1 and 5), chip sampling a 16m cross section at the level of the Big Showing portal, 

and assessing the geological setting of the showing. 

Persons working in the area will benefit from having had experience traversing 

steep terrain; fixed ropes are advisable in some areas, and the assistance of an 

experienced alpinist is recommended (for safety and ease of accessibility) if mineralized

cliff-face exposures are to be evaluated. 

Former camp and helicopter-landing locations (UTM 11, 458815E and 

5635964N) are overgrown and inaccessible; the trail leading from the Big Showing 

northwest, along contour, to the previously established camp area is similarly overgrown 

and would require a significant effort to rehabilitate.

There are no appropriate camp areas near the Big Showing. Helicopter access 

requires toe-in landing procedures. 

A helicopter accessible, dry2 camp site (used for this evaluation) is located in a 

depression on the ridge due west of the Big Showing (ref. map in pocket, station no. 249; 

2020m). The "peak 2179" showing is accessible from it; however the Big Showing is not.

1 Informal name adopted for purposes of this report.

Regional Geological Setting: 
The Big Showing occurs within a succession of iron-rich carbonate rocks adjacent

to green, variegated phyllite (Figs. 1 and 2).  They belong to the lower Paleozoic Lardeau 

Group, a succession of highly folded and metamorphosed carbonaceous phyllite, volcanic 

rocks, carbonate rocks, and gritty quartzite that forms a concave east, arcuate fold belt 

extending from Revelstoke, south along Trout, Duncan and Kootenay Lakes to Salmo,

B.C. This belt is called the Kootenay Arc, and is host to several past producing mines and 

many base- and precious-metal occurrences.

phyllite. See figure 4 for detail.

Relationship between Mineralization, Iron-rich Carbonate, and Structure:
The concentration of base- and precious-metals in this region was a two-part 

process:

1) deposition of metal-rich layers in an iron-rich carbonate succession that accumulated

on the sea floor, perhaps in a restricted basin proximal to active faults; and 

2) mobilization and selective concentration of metal-rich layers during folding and 

metamorphism.

These two events were separated by a significant period of time: deposition of the metal-

rich rocks occurred in the Paleozoic Period, some time between 540Ma and 360 Ma; 

folding and metamorphism much later, approximately 180 million ago. 

The Big Showing (Figs. 1, sta. no. 257), the "peak 2179" showing (Figs. 1 and 2), 

and the newly discovered "gossan showing" (Fig. 1, sta. nos. 246-7) are hosted by a 

rusty-weathering iron-rich marble succession (Fig. 3). Constituent rock types are 

described in the map legend (Fig. 1). The distribution of iron-rich carbonate is regional, 

extending well beyond property limits, and supports the notion of regional stratigraphic 

control on the distribution of rocks having potential for sulphide concentrations.

mineralization. Here, contorted layers of marble, and siliceous pelitic marble 
illustrate the structural complexity observed at the outcrop scale.

Tight, upright folds visible in cliff-face exposures adjacent to the "peak 2179" 

showing (Fig. 4), illustrate the dominant structural pattern. In this style of folding, rock 

material is redistributed: fold limbs are thinned as material flows along them and into the 

fold hinge-zone where excess rock accumulates in a complex "crumple" of faulted, 

smaller scale folds.

narrow synclinal keel, illustrate thickening in fold hinges as a product of material
flow along fold limbs.  "Pinch and swell" structures occur in the thin layer of 
marble bounded by more competent green phyllite.  This exposure is along strike 
and approximately 500m south of the Big Showing and provides an explanation
for the lenticular shape of the showing.

The ideal setting from an exploration viewpoint is a fold hinge where thin, 

sulphide-rich layers are structurally thickened. This may apply to the "peak 2179" 

showing where it extends down-dip toward an inferred synclinal hinge zone (Fig. 4).

Economic Potential:
Big Showing:

The Big Showing is lenticular in shape and occurs on a major fold limb (Figs. 1 

and 5).  Hence, potential for substantial structural thickening of the mineralized rocks is 

limited.

Figure 5: View south showing the lenticular shape of the Big Showing; the portal 
is located immediately above the small snow patch at head of arrow. 
Concentrations of galena, pyrite and pyrrhotite occur in the siliceous marble. An
upper mineralized zone (not accessed) forms a second, lenticular zone with the 
grey-banded marble unit separating it from the Big Showing. See figure 3 for the 
inferred along-strike location of Big Showing to the south.

Galena, pyrite and pyrrhotite form veins, coarse-crystalline mineral aggregates 

and disseminations in siliceous, iron-rich marble. The primary zone of mineralization

appears to be a 1 to 2 meter thick layer that forms the hangingwall flank of an adit that 

follows its strike (Figs. 6 and 7).  A 16m width of rusty-weathering iron-rich siliceous 

marble was chip sampled at the level of the portal (Figs. 1 and 6; Table 1).

At the outcrop scale, the iron-rich, siliceous carbonate host behaved in a brittle 

fashion relative to enveloping marble (Fig. 8). Open spaces created by fracturing acted as 

local crystallization nodes for metal-rich fluids, providing for concentration of sulfide 

minerals along with secondary quartz and carbonate.

Figure 8: Lens of rusty-brown siliceous marble, bounded by green phyllite 
(below) and iron-rich marble (above), illustrating the influence of competency on 
structural style. The less competent phyllite and marble have flowed along 
fractures into the brittle siliceous marble. Secondary quartz, calcite and sulphide 
minerals form fracture fillings.  Openings along fractures in brittle rocks are ideal 
sites for deposition of remobilized sulphide minerals.

The economic significance of the Big Showing is limited by its structural setting 

on the limb of a major fold.  Its shape and size are controlled by the contrast in 

competency between the host iron-rich marble, and the more competent green phyllite 

units flanking it (Fig. 1). Figure 4 illustrates the "pinch and swell" character of the host

marble (seen along strike about 1 km south of the Big Showing), with swells reaching up 

to 30m in thickness and the pinches narrowing to about 5m or less. Although one can 

expect the locally thickened "swells" of marble to have significant strike length (into the 

9

slope) parallel to fold axes, the shape and size of asymmetric, S-shaped (faulted) folds in 

the phyllite beneath the marble (e.g. Fig. 4) place severe limitations on thickness in the 

dip direction (along the slope).  These structural limitations should be carefully 

considered and investigated in any follow-up exploration initiatives. 

"Peak 2176" showing:

Access to the "peak 2176" showing was limited by cliff-hanging exposure.

Location of the prospective layer for base metals is presumed to be 40 m (east of) station 

241 (Figs. 1 and 4).   Host rocks are the same iron-rich carbonate succession as hosts the 

Big Showing, however, no zone of significant Pb or Zn mineralization was encountered 

along ridge exposures east to station 241.

The inferred zone of interest is well displayed in figures 2 and 4, as a thin 

(approximately 2-5 m) layer that can be traced from the ridge crest, down slope into a 

thickened "molar tooth" shaped zone interpreted as the hinge of a syncline.  The dark 

rusty weathering character of the zone is consistent with mineralized rocks observed 

elsewhere.  If this interpretation is correct, then structural thickening will have increased 

the economic potential of this zone.

Given the nature of exposure (Fig. 4), proper sampling and assessment will 

require technical climbing ability and the support of an alpinist capable of providing safe 

belays.

Five, half-meter chip samples were taken from the host marble, along the ridge 

crest (Table 1; Fig. 1: sta. 250-4). Disseminated pyrite and flecks of possible galena were 

observed, however no significant mineralization was evident.

Gossan showing:

A gossan, at least 10 m long (along strike) and 1 to 2 m thick (Fig. 1: sta. 247), 

was encountered north, along strike of the "peak 2176" showing. Deep limonitic 

weathering characterizes the showing with one aggregate of medium crystalline galena

observed. Hand samples were taken for analysis (Table 1; Fig. 9). The true size and 

extent of this showing remains to be determined.

Figure 9: Gossan showing (along strike and north of the "peak 2179" showing). 
Zone is at least 10 m long and 1 to 2 m wide (ref. map in pocket). It is hosted by 
grey-banded marble.

Conclusions:
This preliminary examination of the Big Showing and its vicinity suggests the 

following geological history: 

1) Lower Paleozoic hot spring activity associated with sea floor deposition of iron-rich 
carbonate rocks as well as local concentrations of base and precious metals.

2) Middle Jurassic (ca. 180 Ma) folding and metamorphism with attendant thinning of 
fold limbs and thickening of fold hinge zones. 

3) Sulphide-rich horizons are mobilized during folding, and crystallize in open spaces 
created by brittle deformation.

Location of the Big Showing on a steep dipping, long fold limb suggests structural 

thinning along the limb will have limited tonnage potential.  Local thickening of the host 

iron-rich marble succession into lenses up to 30 m wide and 100 long, has occurred in 

response to the competency contrast between the marble and adjacent, more competent

siliceous phyllite. Despite limited along-dip extent, these lenses of marble may have 

significant strike length parallel to the trend of local fold axes. 

The hinges of major fold structures provide the most fertile areas to explore for 

economic grades and tonnages of base metals.  An interpreted synclinal hinge, observed 

on the south-facing slope of the "peak 2179" showing, is such a structure and deserves 

assessment.

The implication that base metals were originally laid down as stratigraphically

controlled deposits (SEDEX-type) suggests the Big Showing is part of a regional system

of fault controlled basins within the Lardeau trough. Exploration of iron-rich carbonate 

successions in the region could prove fruitful.
