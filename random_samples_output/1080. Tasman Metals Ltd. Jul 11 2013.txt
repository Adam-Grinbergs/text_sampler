1. SUMMARY 

 
Reed Leyton Consulting ("ReedLeyton") was requested by Tasman Metals Ltd. ("Tasman") to provide a Technical 

Report that meets the requirements of Canadian National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"), for the Olserum rare 

earth element (REE) project, located in the vicinity of the village of Gamleby, southeastern Sweden. Olserum is an 

exploration project ("the Project") for REE's associated with a hydrothermally overprinted REE-bearing meta-

sediment.   

 

This report has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines provided in NI 43-101 technical report, Standards 

of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, dated June 30, 2011. The Qualified Person responsible for this report is Mr. 

Geoff Reed ("the Author"), Senior Consulting Geologist for Reed Leyton. Mr. Reed completed a site visit the week 

of June 10, 2012, to review existing geology, core logging and the project setting. 

 

Tasman holds its mineral properties indirectly through its 100% owned subsidiary, Tasmet AB. Tasmet AB holds a 

100% interest in six mineral claims that together form the Olserum Project. In October 2011, Tasman purchased 

one of the six Olserum mineral claims outright from a private UK registered company, Norrsken Energy Ltd for a 

total consideration of 37,746 fully paid shares in Tasman Metals Ltd.   

 

The project area is located in the municipally of Västervik which lies within the county of Kalmar, southeast 

Sweden. It is located approximately 220 km southwest of the Swedish Capital Stockholm and 30 km northwest of 

the port town of Västervik. 

  

The Olserum property has an undulating terrain at an average elevation of about 60m ASL. Pine and spruce 

dominates the vegetation with minor birch, alder and oak. Outcrops are abundant throughout the area and the 

property has a network of gravel roads connected to the main road together with an active railway which passes 

though the property.  

  

Olserum has a temperate climate with warm pleasant summers and moderately cold winters. The winters are 

variable with snowfall depending on the particular year. Scandinavia, like the rest of north-western Europe, is 

influenced by the Gulf Stream which moderates the climate. Olserum receives 40-70 mm of rainfall per month. 

 

Olserum is part of the Västervik formation which is a siliciclastic metasedimentary succession and was deposited in 

a delta environment between ~1.88 – 1.85 Ga at the southern Svecofennian continental margin. Following 

deposition, the Västervik formation was subsided and suffered high temperature / low pressure metamorphism 

when granites belonging to the Trans-Scandinavian Igneous Belt (TIB) intruded the sedimentary sequence. The 

Västervik Formation is a syncline with horizontal fold axis, up to 5 km thick and 50 km in length and trends 

northwest-southeast. Olserum lies as a window in the northwestern edge completely surrounded by TIB granites. 

Primary sedimentary structures have been documented in several places around the Västervik Formation together 

with observations of heavy mineral beds. 

  

At Olserum, metamorphic grade has obliterated primary structures seen elsewhere around the Västervik 

Formation. The metasedimentary sequence in Olserum trends E-W, is approximately 600m by length and up to 

100m wide. Its contacts towards the TIB granite are steep dipping towards north followed by thrusts faulting in 

the TIB at its northern contacts. The principal lithologies that comprise the Olserum metasedimentary sequence 

are predominantly biotite/amphibole bearing quartzite, quartzitic gneiss and gneiss being interpreted as former 

psammites, together with a biotite/magnetite bearing quartzite, being interpreted as former heavy mineral beds 

and now as placer deposits.

The REE mineralization at Olserum is mainly hosted by the minerals monazite and xenotime. Apatite occurs in 

abundance but is only a minor REE carrier. Metamorphic events accompanied by metasomatism have 

hydrothermally overprinted REE-bearing metasediment. Although apatite, monazite and xenotime likely existed as 

primary minerals, studies suggest that the phosphate minerals are of metamorphic origin, formed by 

hydrothermal processes. Monazite and xenotime occurs abundant as inclusions in apatite, biotite and minor 

amphibolites but also as medium grained and coarse grained subhedral to euhedral grains in patches, veins and 

breccias. It is interpreted that apatite has formerly been a major REE carrier but was leached during 

metamorphism and precipitated monazite and xenotime hosted as inclusions in apatite. The inclusions occur 

mainly in the core of the apatites which suggest that the inclusions in the rims has at some stage been leached out 

and precipitated within the rock. 

 

Due to the metamorphic and hydrothermal overprint the rare earth bearing phosphates have been widely 

distributed throughout the metasedimentary package, resulting in low grade but large tonnage mineralization 

with high percentage of heavy rare earth elements (HREE). The heavy rare earth elements are mainly situated in 

xenotime. The highest REE grade is associated with magnetite bands and veins hosted in biotite and/or amphibole 

rich quartzites. The host rock itself is mineralized through inclusions of monazite and xenotime in biotite and 

through thin irregular magnetite veins. This leads to the identification of mainly one domain, the 

Metasedimentary (MSED) which itself is mineralized and host to the sub-units Biotite-Magnetite-Rare earth 

bearing unit (BMR) and Biotite-Magnetite-Rare Earth-Skarny unit (BMRS). 

 

A new Mineral Resource Estimate for Total Rare Earth Oxides ("TREO"), Total Heavy Rare Earth Oxides ("HREO") 

and Total Light Rare Earth Oxides ("LREO") is shown in Table 1-2 at varying cut-off grades.  ReedLeyton however 

recommends 0.4% TREO as the appropriate applied cut-off for comparative purposes.  This Mineral Resource 

Estimate has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum 

("CIM") Definition Standards as adopted on November 27th 2010.  The Project consists of an exploration property 

and it does not contain Mineral Reserves as defined by CIM standards.   

 

The Mineral Resource Estimate was prepared using the following steps: data validation; data preparation; 

geological interpretation and modelling; establishment of block models; compositing of assay intervals; 

exploratory data analysis of TREO; variogram analysis; derivation of kriging plan and boundary conditions; grade 

interpolation of TREO; validation of TREO grade estimates; classification of estimates with respect to Canadian 

Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM") guidelines; and then resource tabulation and resource 

reporting.  

 

Classification was applied based on geological confidence, data quality and grade variability. 

 

Mineral Resources were modeled by ReedLeyton Consulting applying six different total rare earth oxide (TREO) 

cut-off grades, with a base-case resource estimated using a TREO cut-off of 0.4% (Table 1 and 2). At this cut-off, 

Olserum hosts an Indicated Mineral Resource of 4.5 million tonnes grading 0.60% TREO and an Inferred Mineral 

Resource of 3.3 million tonnes grading 0.63% TREO both with 34% of the TREO being the higher value HREO.  

Table 3 and Table 4 provide the grade averages for rare earth oxides at the various cut-offs. 

 

The calculated tonnage figures are literal, whereas the accuracy of the technique suggests that the values should 

be rounded to better reflect the order of accuracy. Hence the author has rounded the mineralisation tonnage to 

the nearest ten thousand tonnes as shown on Table 1 and 2. 

 

In order to demonstrate that the mineralization as estimated in the block model has a reasonable expectation of 

being mined at some time in the foreseeable future, ReedLeyton completed a mining optimisation exercise.  As 



 

 

Reed Leyton Consulting                                                                                                 Tasman Metals Ltd

the mining concept for the Olserum Deposit is currently surface mining, Whittle® software was used to generate a 

conceptual pit shell.  Notwithstanding the pit optimisation exercise, it has not resulted in an engineered and 

operational open-pit mine design.  Operating assumptions used for the Whittle® pit shell are provided in Section 

14 below, and were based on the operating assumptions known from Tasman's more advanced Norra Karr REE 

project that lies 100km northwest of Olserum with similar grade and surface aspect. 

 

Overall, ReedLeyton considers these assumptions are fair for the purpose of determining reasonable prospects for 

economic extraction of the Olserum deposit but do not demonstrate that the mineralization is economic, since the 

exercise is not at the level of a Preliminary Economic Assessment and does not conform to the studies required for 

a Preliminary Economic Assessment.  

 

ReedLeyton found that, apart from a portion of the mineralization that falls below the pit shells prepared, the 

majority of the resource block model reports from within the pit shell.  The resource reporting below the pit shell 

is not considered impaired (and was not removed from the resource estimated herein) as it is of a grade that can 

be considered for possible future underground extraction (should the confidence in the resource estimates be 

improved).

Notes: 
 

1 Total Rare Earth Oxides (TREO) includes: La2O3, Ce2O3, Pr2O3, Nd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb2O3, Dy2O3, Ho2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, Lu2O3, 
Y2O3 

2 Heavy Rare Earth Oxides (HREO) includes: Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb2O3, Dy2O3, Ho2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, Lu2O3, Y2O3 

3 The calculated resource is sensitive to cut-off grade which will be influenced by metallurgical operating costs.  Bench scale metallurgical 
tests were completed on an Olserum composite sample by Swedish consultants Minpro AB in 2005.   

4 The mineral resource estimate was completed by Mr. Geoffrey Reed, Senior Consulting Geologist of ReedLeyton Consultants Pty Ltd, and 
is based on geological and geochemical data supplied by Tasman, audited by Mr. Reed.  Mr. Reed is an independent qualified person for 
the purposes of NI 43-101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators. 

5 The resource estimate has been classified as an Indicated and  Inferred Resource based on the distance-space between sample data within 
the current deposit outline. Variograms were obtained from the variography study of TREO, with the continuity analysis showing a 
reasonable fit model in the major and semi major direction for the mineralised domains. 

6 The resource estimate is based on: 

-  A database of 31 drill holes totalling 5,297m of diamond drilling completed by Tasman and the previous owner IGE  Nordic since 2004 
where samples were composited on 1m lengths.  All Assays by Tasman and IGE Nordic were completed at ALS Chemex's 
Vancouver Laboratory. 

-  Specific gravity (SG) has an overall mean of 2.70 g/cc from 458 SG readings. The mean of the mineralisation of 2.82 g/cc was used in 
the estimate and a mean of the host rock of 2.67 g/cc was used in the estimate 

-  Block model was estimated by ordinary kriging interpolation method on blocks 5m (x) x 20m (y) x 10m (z). 

-  Beneficiation test work has been completed at Olserum.  Magnetic and gravity tests produced a 5.5% TREO grade concentrate with 
78% recovery.  Optimization  is in progress.  Hydrometallurgy tests are in progress and no information was available at the time of 
this resource calculation, however the xenotime/monazite mineralogy has been a previous source of REE's and processing 
method is well known. 

7  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resource estimates do not account 
for mineability, selectivity, mining loss and dilution. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have the 
economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  

 

The author confirmed with Directors of Tasman Metals Ltd that no material activity has taken place with regard to 

the projects since the author's visit.  The author believes that the site visit is still current, and that there is no 

material change since then to the information in this report.

3. RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

This Technical Report is based on reports, plans and tabulations provided by Tasman either directly from the 

exploration offices, or from reports by other organisations whose work is the property of Tasman. The historical 

work outlined in this report is based on published sources and unpublished reports, maps and data provided by 

Tasman. The data has been reviewed by Tasman to ensure its quality and accuracy. ReedLeyton have exercised all  

due care in reviewing the documents provided and attempted to verify the quality and accuracy of the data. It is 

believed that the supplied information and assumptions are factual and correct and that the interpretations are 

reasonable and there is no reason to believe that any material facts have been withheld.      

 

ReedLeyton has independently calculated Mineral Resources for the Olserum deposit by using both historical and 

Tasman's drilling and assay data. Data used for this calculation was provided in a database formed by Tasman. 

Reference to original data sources showed this database to be both correct and complete.  

 

This Technical Report was prepared for Tasman by ReedLeyton and is based on information prepared by other 

parties. ReedLeyton has gained information provided in the following report: 

 IGE, 2007. The Rare Earth Deposit Olserum Sweden. IGE Nordic AB internal report.  

 
While it is apparent that the work of the IGE Nordic was completed in a very methodical and highly professional 

manner, ReedLeyton Consulting has not independently verified the accuracy and completeness of all of the 

information and data utilised by the IGE Nordic in its original estimates. 

 

Personnel from ReedLeyton travelled to the Olserum Project with representatives from Tasman in June 2012. 

During this visit, a thorough validation of hole collar positions was undertaken using GPS. 16 drill holes from 14 

drill hole positions were checked and found to be accurately surveyed. Drill collar orientation was also checked 

and found to be consistent with the drill database as supplied to the author. Key geological features were 

surveyed during this visit such as magnetite, apatite and monazite-rich outcrops. These were later reconciled with 

the extrapolated positions from the drill hole logging and found to correlate well. 

 

The author also travelled to the core archive facilities of the Swedish Geological Survey in Malå where Tasman's 

core is securely stored. Five holes were selected by ReedLeyton for re-logging which were laid out in their entirety 

and logged. The re-logging of these holes confirmed the correlation of the higher grade zones with zones of higher 

apatite/monazite intensity and subsequently assisted in the interpretation of the high grade domains within the 

broader resource area. ReedLeyton checked a random amount of hard copy logs against the data provided in the 

database. These did not indicate any issue with data integrity.   

 

In the acquisition of Olserum from Norrsken Energy Ltd an access database was handed over which included drill 

hole collar, assay, deviation survey and logging done by IGE Nordic from their 2004-2005 drilling project. All 

original files including assay certificates are also in Tasman's possession.  The author is of the opinion that these 

documents are authentic.  Adequate validation of this data was completed by Mr Geoff Reed.  

 

While ReedLeyton has relied upon the above noted work, information and advice of other persons to prepare this 

Technical Report, Geoff Reed, the Qualified Person responsible for the preparation of this Technical Report does 

not disclaim any responsibility for the Technical Report on such basis. Mr. Reed has taken the steps which are 

appropriate, in his professional judgment, to ensure that that such work, information and advice relied upon is 

sound.

Mineral law information and claim documentation was provided by Tasman staff, and confirmed via the Mining 

Inspectorate of Sweden website (www.bergsstaten.se). ReedLeyton believes that this information is reliable for 

use in this report, without a need to further independently verify its accuracy. ReedLeyton has not conducted land 

status evaluations, and has relied upon Tasman's statements regarding property status, legal title, and 

environmental compliance for the Project. As such ReedLeyton and Geoff Reed, the Qualified Person responsible 

for the preparation of this Technical Report, disclaim responsibility for Section 4 of this Technical Report which is 

based entirely on such information and statements.

Swedish Mining Laws and Regulations 

Swedish mining laws pertaining to mineral exploration changed profoundly in 1992 when the new Minerals Act of 

1991 (effective July 1 1992) for the first time allowed foreign ownership of mineral title in Sweden. The right of the 

Swedish state to acquire 50 per cent of a mine was repealed a year later. Exploration permits and mining licences 

approved before July 1 1992 are governed by the Minerals Act of 1974 that does not permit foreign ownership of 

mineral title or surface rights.  

 

Further amendments were enacted in 1998 that include the requirement that the results of subsequent 

exploration work had to be reported upon surrender of the claims. However, upon request, these submissions 



 

 

Reed Leyton Consulting                                                                                                 Tasman Metals Ltd

were subject to a confidentiality period of up to four years. As a result of these changes, there are little or no 

exploration data in the public domain on claims that were worked in the years 1992 to 1998.  

 

Rules and regulations pertaining to mining exploration in Sweden are clearly outlined in the "Guide to Mineral 

Legislation and Regulations in Sweden" (2000) available from the offices or the website of the Geological Survey 

(www.sgu.se). The Mining Inspectorate of Sweden provides clear directives, available from the Inspectorate 

website (www.bergsstaten.se), for conducting exploration. Another useful link that summarizes these laws and 

guidelines is A Guide to Mineral Legislation and Regulations:  (http://www.geonord.org/law/minlageng.html)  

 

Tasman has, or will address all requirements before undertaking any exploration activities. Tasman has the rights 

to access the property, and no restrictions or limitations as defined for work on the projects are evident. Tasman 

has the obligation to outline a work program and gain permission from landholders prior to accessing the 

properties, and to provide compensation for any ground-disturbing work conducted.  

 

Exploration permits are granted for specified areas that are judged by the Mining Inspectorate to be of suitable 

shape and size that they are capable of being explored in "an appropriate manner". The current rules do not 

require annual minimum expenditures on claims, but a land fee is due upon first application for an exploration 

permit in the amount of SEK20/hectare, covering an initial period of three years. If a claim or part of a claim is 

abandoned within 11 or 23 months of its granting date SEK16 or SEK10, respectively (of the original SEK20 fee) per 

abandoned hectare become refundable.  

 

It is possible to extend the time a claim is held to a total of 15 years after the date of the original granting, but the 

annual fees per hectare increase substantially: SEK21/year/hectare for years four to six, SEK50/year/hectare for 

years seven to ten, and SEK100/year/hectare for years eleven to fifteen. No further extension of mineral 

exploration permits is allowed after year 15. The high fees in the later years discourage excessive claim holdings 

deemed to be of little value by the holder. An exploitation concession (mining permit) can be applied for at any 

time while a claim is in good standing, and may be granted for a period of up to 25 years.  

 

An exploration permit (undersökningstillstånd) gives access to the land and an exclusive right to explore within 

the permit area. It does not entitle the holder to undertake exploration work in contravention of any 

environmental regulations that apply to the area. Applications for exemptions are normally made to the County 

Administrative Board.  

 
An exploration permit is granted for a specific area where a successful discovery is likely to be made. It should be 

of a suitable shape and size and no larger than may be expected to be explored by the permit holder in an 

appropriate manner. Normally, permits for areas larger than a total of 100 hectares are not granted to private 

individuals. A permit is to be granted if there is reason to assume that exploration in the area may lead to the 

discovery of a concession mineral.  

 

Compensation must be paid by the permit holder for damage or encroachment caused by exploration work.  

 

When an exploration permit expires without an exploitation concession being granted, the results of the 

exploration work undertaken must be reported to the Mining Inspector.  Exploration permits are applied for in 

paper to the mining inspector, using a map and list of coordinates that define the boundaries of the area in 

question; the metal being sought must also be stated.

An exploitation concession (bearbetningskoncession) gives the holder the right to exploit a proven, extractable 

mineral deposit for a period of 25 years, which may be prolonged. Permits and concessions under the Minerals Act 

may be transferred with the permission of the Mining Inspector.  

 

An exploitation concession relates to a distinct area, designated on the basis of the location and extent of a 

proven mineral deposit, and is normally valid for 25 years. A concession may be granted when a mineral deposit is 

discovered which is probably technically and economically recoverable during the period of the concession, and if 

the nature and position of the deposit does not make it inappropriate to grant a concession. Special provisions 

apply to concessions relating to oil and gaseous hydrocarbons.  Under the provisions of the Environmental Code, 

an application for an exploitation concession is to be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment. 

Applications are considered in consultation with the County Administrative Board, taking into account whether 

the site is acceptable from an environmental point of view.  

 

Under the rules of the Environmental Code, a special environmental impact assessment for the mining operation 

must always be submitted to the Environmental Court, which examines the impact of the operation on the 

environment in a broad sense. The Court also stipulates the conditions which the operation is to meet.  

 

Land needed for exploitation is normally acquired by the mining company through contracts of sale or leases. If 

there is a contract of sale, a property registration procedure must generally be undertaken through the Land 

Survey authority in order for registration of title to be granted.  

 

Before any land, inside or outside the concession area, may be used. It has to be designated by the Mining 

Inspector (markanvisning). This procedure usually regulates the compensation etc. to be paid to affected 

landowners, normally on the basis of an agreement between the company and the landowners, together with any 

other parties whose rights may be affected.  

 

Mining companies (limited companies) pay corporations tax at a rate of 22% under the same rules as every other 

company. Accordingly, there are no special taxation rules for such companies. A royalty is paid on the value of 

minerals produced at a rate of 0.2%, which is shared between the landholder and the State each receiving 0.15% 

and 0.05% respectively.  

 

The application fee for an exploration permit is SEK500 for each area of 2,000 hectares or part thereof. The 

exploration fee varies for different concession minerals and for different periods of validity. The application fee for 

an exploitation concession is SEK 6,000 per area.  

Environmental Liability and Permitting 

There are no known outstanding environmental liabilities on any of the licenses and, as required by Swedish law, 

all landowners identified by Tasman have been informed by the Swedish Inspectorate of Mines (Bergsstaten) that 

an exploration license has been applied for in accordance with Chapters 1.1 and 2 of the Mineral Act.

5. ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE and 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

General 

The Olserum property has an undulating terrain at an average elevation of about 60m ASL. Vegetation is 

dominated by pine and spruce with only minor deciduous trees like birch, alder and oak. Modest amounts of 

shrubby undergrowth occur. Outcrop is abundant throughout the area.  

 

Olserum has a temperate climate with warm pleasant summers and moderately cold winters. Winters are variable 

in southern Sweden with snowfall depending on the particular year. Scandinavia, like the rest of north-western 

Europe, is influenced by the Gulf Stream which moderates the climate; the winter climate at this latitude would 

roughly be equivalent that in North America at about 5 to 10 degrees latitude further south. Except during periods 

of extreme winter conditions, the author is of the opinion that work could be carried out on this property on a 

year-round basis. Olserum receives on an average between 40-70 mm of precipitation per month. 

 

The property is accessible by road from Stockholm on highway E22 approximately 250km south to the town of 

Gamleby, which lies in the archipelago of the Baltic east coast. 10km north of Gamleby a gravel road accesses 

Olserum from the main road to the centre of the property, a total distance of about 12 km. An active railway 

passes through the property and transports goods to the port in the town of Västervik which lies 30km to the 

southeast of Olserum.   

 

Olserum is very close to infrastructure, services, electricity, supplies and a skilled and educated labour force. The 

city of Västervik lies about 30 km southeast of Olserum and has a population in excess of 20,000. The city is also 

the seat of Västervik municipality (kommun) hosting a population of 36,000 and is part of the larger Kalmar 

County (Län) which contains a population in excess of 230,000. The city is accessible by highway, rail or boat.  

 

Northwest of Olserum, about 65 km along main road 35, lays the city of Linköping, boasting a population around 

100,000. This city dates back 700 years and is known for its university and high tech industries, including the SAAB 

aircraft plant. 

Climate 

The climate is comparatively temperate, considering that Sweden is located at such a northern latitude. The 

climate is typical of Fennoscandia with cool summers and cold winters.The principal moderating influences are the 

Gulf Stream and the prevailing westerly winds, which blow in from the relatively warm Atlantic Ocean. In winter 

these influences are offset by cold air masses that sweep in from the east.  

Accessibility 

Field work in the area involving geochemical sampling and geological mapping is restricted to the Swedish summer 

(May to November), while drilling and geophysical surveying may be performed year round.  Road access to all 

projects is via all-weather bitumen roads to the more major town centres, and then via secondary gravelled roads 

and forestry access tracks. 

Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The principal land use in the area is forestry. All social and industrial needs and services such as accommodation, 

provisions, supplies, communications etc. are readily and commercially available.  They are of high standard,

typical of the modern industrial democracy that is Sweden.  The national power grid extends throughout the 

region; branch lines provide electricity to even the most remote hamlets.  Water resources are plentiful. See

Physiography 

The landscape was sculpted by extensive glaciers to form shallow lakes and extensive boggy lowlands during the 

most recent ice age, spanning a period between three and ten thousand years ago.  Broad valleys were scoured 

out in the direction of glacial transport flanking low-lying hills underlain by resistant rocks. The landscape of 

Sweden is dominated by low rolling hills (70 percent) and flat lowlands (30 percent) comprised of bogs and lakes. 

Hills are mostly covered by glacial moraine and sands and forested, primarily with birch and pine.

6. HISTORY 

The Olserum property is a recent discovery by Swedish standards, first identified in the 50's during a regional 

exploration program. Several companies conducted exploration parallel to each other. However, it was not 

until the company 'Stora Kopparberg AB' investigated uranium in association with iron ore that Olserum was 

discovered. A number of uranium mineralized areas were discovered but none of economic importance.          

Historical Deposit Ownership and Exploration 

In the 70's, the Swedish Geological Survey (SGU) continued to explore the sedimentary package around 

Västervik for uranium.  The exploration included boulder hunting, radiometric and magnetic ground surveys, 

mapping and sampling. An attempt to classify the different types of uranium mineralisation was also 

completed. Uranium mineralisation was interpreted as mainly associated with magnetite bearing heavy 

mineral beds hosted in quartzitic gneisses. Apatite and monazite were identified together with anomalous 

values of yttrium, but was not investigated further for rare earths due to lack of demand at that time.  

 

In 1990 SGU followed up earlier exploration with an attempt to identify and classify rare earth occurrences in 

Sweden. The previous exploration had only assayed for yttrium and not all REE's, and in 1991 SGU followed up 

with site visits and sampling locations where anomalous yttrium assays or favorable REE geology was situated. 

Hence the rare earth mineralisation in Olserum was discovered in close association with the uranium and 

magnetite bearing heavy mineral beds. 

 

In 2003 the Swedish exploration company IGE Nordic AB claimed Olserum and commenced a drilling program. 

By 2005 a total of 5130 meters in 31 drill holes had been completed at Olserum and adjacent areas.  An 

internal mineral resource was calculated by IGE Nordic AB based on 15 drill holes, gave an indicated mineral 

resource of 2.8 million tonnes @ 0.83% TREO.  This resource is historical in nature, does not meet the 

definitions of "mineral resource" or "indicated mineral resource" under the CIM Definition Standards on 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves and cannot be relied upon.  This resource is superseded by the 

resource as provided within this document in Chapter 14.      

   

Additionally, IGE Nordic also completed a small scale test to prepare a mineral concentrate. This work was 

performed by Minpro in Stråssa, Sweden, who managed to produce a concentrate of weighing only 5% of the 

initial mass that contained 14% TREO at a recovery of 59%.

** The historical estimates quoted above are based on a report titled: "The Rare Earth Deposit Olserum, Sweden." By IGE Nordic AB 

(Internal Report. 2007) where the estimate is described as a Mineraltillgång Indikerad (Indicated Mineral Resource).  The resource was 

calculated using a wireframe method within the Micromine software, with a cut-off grade of 0.3% TREO and a minimum width of 4 metres.  

 

Data used in calculating these Historic Mineral Resource Estimates is historical in nature and was not compiled  

in accordance with CIM standards. ReedLeyton Consulting has not completed sufficient exploration to verify 

the estimates or to classify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource.  ReedLeyton Consulting is not 

treating them as CIM defined resources or reserves verified by a Qualified Person, and the historical estimate 

should not be relied upon. Other than the Mineral Resource Estimate provided in Section 14 of this Technical 

Report, ReedLeyton Consulting does not have, and is not aware of, any more recent estimates.

7. GEOLOGICAL SETTING and MINERALISATION 

Regional Geology 

The Olserum REE mineralization is located in southeast Sweden about 10 km NW of the small town of Gamleby 

which lies upon the Baltic coast. It was discovered during uranium exploration in the 1950's and was 

investigated for its rare earth content in the 1990's. 

 

The Olserum area is part of the Västervik Formation which is a metasedimentary succession that formed in the 

southernmost edge of the Svecofennian domain.  The sequence was deposited between ~1.88-1.85 Ga, as 

recently determined by detrital zircon U-Pb analyses (Kleinhanns et al., 2012). The sediments have 

accumulated in tide dominated estuaries, river dominated deltas and in wave dominated shallow water 

environments within a back-arc basin as a response to a northward subduction zone (Sultan and Plink-

Björklund, 2006).  

 

Following deposition, the Västervik formation subsided and was intruded by granitoid melts between 1.85-1.8 

Ga referred to as the Småland Granite belonging to the TransScandinavian Igneous Belt (TIB). The psammitic to 

pelitic sedimentary succession suffered high temperature / low pressure metamorphism which transformed 

the sequence to mica-bearing quartzites, gneisses and metapelites. However, primary sedimentary structures 

can still be observed in numerous places around the Västervik Formation. Within the sequence, intercalations 

of former black sand horizons rich in iron oxides occur in various abundance and thickness. The black sands are 

interpreted as alluvial deposits and being the dominant host to the rare earth mineralization. The Västervik 

Formation is at least 5 km thick and approximately 50 km in length. It is through a major compression event 

from the northeast-southwest formed as a syncline with a horizontal fold-axis trending northwest – southeast. 

Local Geology  

Olserum lies as a window in the north-western edge of the Västervik Formation completely surrounded by 

Småland granites. The surrounding granite is a red coloured, medium grained, generally massive to weakly 

foliated, mica deficient granite with minor disseminated magnetite. The granite has meter thick bands of 

conformable biotite rich gneisses and also abundant late irregular quartz veins. Some meter thick bands of REE 

bearing metasediment is locally tectonically intruded close to the contacts.   

 

The Olserum metasediment trends generally E-W, is approximately 600m long and up to 100m wide. It has a 

total surface area of approximately 30 000 m
2 

(3 hectares). Amphibolite metamorphic grade has obliterated all 

primary sedimentary structures in Olserum which can be observed in several other places around the Västervik 

Formation. The contacts between the Olserum metasedimentary sequence and the Småland Granite are steep 

dipping towards north. Diamond drilling shows that the northern contact dips around 80 degrees towards 

north-northeast but also thrust faulting in the granite at its northern contact. The southern granite contact is 

more gradational but has been poorly investigated by drilling. 

 

The dominant lithologies within the metasedimentary sequence are biotite/amphibole bearing quartzites, 

quartzitic gneiss and gneiss being interpreted as former psammites together with biotite/magnetite/apatite 

rich layers hosted in quartzite being interpreted as placer deposits. Extensive metasomatism accompanied 

metamorphic events leading to hydrothermal overprint and redistribution of the black sand horizons and the 

REE bearing phases. Therefore the REE bearing phosphate minerals are distributed throughout the

metasedimentary package at Olserum, with high grade REE in the magnetite rich layers and low grade REE in 

the adjacent quartzites and gneisses.  

 

The most abundant REE bearing minerals at Olserum are the phosphates monazite and xenotime. Apatite 

occurs in abundance but studies show that apatite only carries REE to a minor extent. All three phosphates are 

of metamorphic origin, formed by hydrothermal processes although a primary detrital origin is probable. 

Monazite and xenotime occur as inclusions in apatite and biotite and to a minor extent within amphiboles. It is 

suggested that apatite was a major carrier of REE but was leached during metamorphism, and monazite and 

xenotime was precipitated as inclusions in apatite. Due to the absence of monazite and xenotime in the rims of 

the apatite crystals, it is interpreted that any inclusions in the rims were leached out and precipitated 

elsewhere within the rock. Monazite and xenotime also occurs as medium grained to coarse grained subhedral 

to euhedral crystals in magnetite rich layers, veins and patches. The highest REE grades are associated with the 

magnetite rich bands and veins hosted in biotite/amphibole bearing quartzites. However, the host rock to the 

magnetite rich layers is REE bearing itself through fine grained inclusions of monazite and xenotime in biotite 

and amphiboles and through irregular magnetite veins and patches.

Major Rock Types 

Granite (GRA) 

The metasediment in Olserum is surrounded by younger granites that belong to the TransScandinavian Igneous 

Belt. It is a red, medium grained, massive to foliated rock. It has low biotite content and usually has weak 

magnetite dissemination. Quartz veins are abundant as are biotite and sillimanite rich layers. Occasionally 

granite is incorporated in the metasediment and at the northern contact overlapping of granite and 

metasediment is common together with occasional layers of high grade rare earth bearing units.    

Gneiss (GNE) 

Within the meta-sediment, particularly when close to the granite contact, the rock is more metamorphosed 

and has a more pronounced gneissic texture. The gneiss has often a clear granite component and is usually a 

red-grey gneissic rock. At the contacts, the granite and the gneiss often overlap, and there may be intruded 

magnetite layers rich in rare earth bearing minerals. This, together with mineralised filled fissures and veins 

due to remobilisation, makes the gneiss in part an anomalous rare earth enriched unit. It is not included within 

the Mineral Resource

- 28 - 

Metasediment (MSED) 

This domain is the predominant rock type that incorporates all other rock units that belong to the sedimentary 

sequence. MSED may carry REE bearing minerals, and is therefore included within the Mineral Resource.  

 

All of the rock types that comprise the metasedimentary unit (excluding the magnetite bearing layers) are 

generally variations of different proportions of quartz, feldspar, mica and amphiboles. The MSED is separated 

from gneiss texturally, with a stronger foliation in gneiss, and visually from quartzites by the higher quartz 

content. The difference is often very gradational. However, geochemically the rock types are very similar to 

each other and can in many cases not be distinguished.   

 

The metasediment is generally a grey, medium grained foliated rock consisting predominantly of quartz with 

varying amounts of biotite and plagioclase. Accessory minerals are cordierite, sillimanite, chlorite, magnetite 

and amphibole. Drilling shows that metasediment carries much of the the REE's, with monazite and xenotime 

common. The highest grades are associated with magnetite rich layers but mineralization also appears with 

magnetite rich veins, patches and as inclusions in biotite and amphiboles. It is often granitized towards the 

contacts where it becomes a gneiss.  

Quartzite (QZT) 

This is a quartz rich unit within the MSED domain. Plagioclase is low to absent, biotite can occur in abundance. 

Some amphiboles can also be present, but if together with magnetite it would be logged as the BMR unit 

described below. Although the QZT is sometimes difficult to distinguish from MSED, it is often found around 

the magnetite rich layers, being the host rock to BMR. The QZT rock type itself is regularly REE mineralized and 

thus part of the Mineral Resource. 

Biotite, Magnetite and Rare Earth Element bearing rock (BMR) 

The BMR unit represents the interpreted heavy mineral placer deposits. Due to the subsequent 

metamorphism, primary features do not exist and the layers have been recrystallized and remobilised. Its 

relatively ductile character has resulted in the BMR unit having an irregular distribution, and is seen as patches, 

veins, breccias and conformable layers within the metasedimentary unit. 

 

The mineralogy of the unit is mainly composed of quartz, biotite, amphibole, cordierite, magnetite, apatite, 

monazite and xenotime. The unit is not consistent in grade or mineralogy and has therefore been subdivided 

into a magnetite poor unit (Biotite, Rare earth bearing rock, BR) and a amphibole skarny unit (Biotite, 

Magnetite, Skarny, REE bearing rock, BMSR).  BMSR can be followed most consistently through the area due to 

the characteristic amphiboles, and is often associated with high grade mineralization. 

 
Apatite often occurs as medium grained to very coarse grained subhedral to euhedral crystals. Occasionally, 

medium grained to coarse grained subhedral/euhedral monazite and xenotime is seen although not in same 

abundance as apatite. Studies show that the apatite has a significant amount of fine grained inclusions of 

mainly monazite and xenotime. Apatite seems to be low in REE and the main carrier is monazite and xenotime. 

Monazite appears as single crystals, as inclusions and as fissure and inter-granular fillings. It has been shown 

that biotite, which occurs in abundance, can carry inclusions of monazite and possible xenotime in significant 

amounts. These inclusions also seem to exist in the amphiboles.

- 29 - 

Gneiss Type 1 (GNE1) 

This second type of gneiss occurs as gradational variation of from the above more quartzitic meta-sediment 

and the more granitic gneiss. It has a gneissic texture but is often more dull grey and blurry by the naked eye. 

This unit occurs at the granite contact zone also but is most common in the meta-sediment and adjacent to the 

above gneiss. As in both the meta-sediment and the gneiss above, patches, veins, fissures and layers of rare 

earth bearing minerals occurs in varying amounts throughout the unit, making GNE1 general higher in grade 

than above gneiss, although a large variation in grade exists. GNE1 is considered belonging to the MSED 

domain and therefore is included in the Mineral Resource when appropriate. 

Mineralization 

A study of the Olserum mineralization was completed by Freiberg University during 2012. The study included 

petrographic description of 18 polished thin sections by transmitted light microscopy. Additionally, six samples 

were chosen for further petrographic analyses on a Mineral Liberation Analyzer (MLA) together with an 

Electron MicroProbe (EMP) for mineral analysis of the REE bearing phases. The results presented below are the 

results of samples taken in well mineralized intervals and thus may not represent the overall petrography and 

mineralization. It is though believed that the different styles of mineralization presented here exist in various 

amounts throughout the Mineral Resource.  

 

The characteristics of the major minerals are described in the order of relative abundance. The minerals 

included are apatite, quartz, biotite, amphibole, monazite and xenotime. Furthermore, cordierite, magnetite 

and chlorite occur in minor amount.  

Apatite 

Apatite occurs as subhedral to euhedral prismatic crystals, up to several centimeters in size but also as fine 

grained inter-granular infillings. It is abundant in all samples and exists in all paragenetic and textural 

associations. The majority of apatite displays a significant amount of crystallographically oriented inclusions of 

monazite and xenotime. The inclusions are more abundant in the core of the crystals than along the edges. 

Figure 10 is sample OLR12002b and shows brecciated fabric with cm sized apatite and monazite crystals in a 

groundmass of biotite and quartz with minor chlorite and amphiboles. Figure 10 displays Back Scattered 

Electron (BSE) images showing abundant monazite and xenotime inclusions in apatite together with monazite / 

apatite and monazite / xenotime intergrowth. Table 8 is mineral assays on apatite performed by the EMP. The 

mineral chemistry shows that the apatite TREO grades are low, often around 0.5%.

Quartz 

Quartz is an abundant mineral with a high textural diversity. It occurs as recrystallized blasts and agglomerates 

as well as fine grained groundmass and as intergranular infill. Quartz is often recrystallized and shows 

undulatory extinction. Quartz plays only a minor role in comparison to apatite and biotite with regard to 

monazite and xenotime inclusions. 

Biotite 

Biotite appears in small to several cm thick massive bands as well as disseminated crystals, intergranular 

infillings and nests. Biotite occurs in abundance and can carry considerable amounts of monazite and xenotime 

inclusions together with minor zircon.  

Amphibole 

Generally, amphiboles forms radial aggregates of subhedral to anhedral crystals. The composition suggests 

amphiboles from the gedrite series, often rich in iron. It occurs with textural diversity as massive, patches, 

intergranular infillings and as disseminations. Inclusions of monazite and xenotime can occur.  

Monazite 

There are generally two textural types recognized in thin section. One as cm sized subhedral crystals and the 

other as minute inclusions in apatite, biotite, cordierite and minor amphibole. In addition, it occurs as very fine 

grained vein fillings. Th and U content often produces radiation haloes. Figure 11 shows U and Th content

based on 30 spot analyses in sample OLR12002b. From the diagram it can be seen that Th content range from 

0.3 – 4 wt%. The U content is very low. The TREO / HREO diagram show high content of TREO in all analyzed 

spots. The HREO is around 2 wt% and suggest that the majority of the HREO in Olserum is situated in xenotime.

Xenotime 

Of the selected samples there are no fine grained fissure fillings observed. Otherwise xenotime show a similar 

behavior to that of monazite. Furthermore there are no radiation haloes present. Detailed mineral chemistry 

has not been able to be performed on xenotime due to lack of reference material.

8. DEPOSIT TYPES 

Olserum is best described as a hydrothermally overprinted REE bearing metasediment deposit. The 

mineralization consists of the REE bearing phosphates monazite and xenotime which are hosted in magnetite 

rich layers/veins and occurs as coarse grained minerals of monazite/xenotime and as fine grained abundant 

inclusions in apatite, biotite or as patches suggesting an epigenetic crystallization promoted by metasomatic 

fluid percolation. It is interpreted that the magnetite rich layers were former heavy mineral beds, thus 

suggesting the Olserum precursor was a placer deposit which been subsequent metamorphosed and 

hydrothermally overprinted. Apatite, monazite and xenotime are found in rocks of nearly every metamorphic 

grade and have a wide P-T stability range. 

 

Placer deposits are sand, silt and cobble size sediments deposited in streams, rivers and beaches and are also 

referred to as alluvial deposits. In order to accumulate in placers deposits minerals needs to be denser than 

quartz and resistant to weathering processes.  A typical compound of placer material is black sand which is a 

mixture of iron oxides like magnetite, hematite and ilmenite together with heavy minerals like monazite, 

zircon, rutile, xenotime, chromite amongst others. 

 

Globally, monazite alluvial accumulations are a valuable type of REE and Th deposits. Monazite's high specific 

gravity and resistant to chemical weathering account for its association in placer deposits. Monazite weathers 

from alkaline crystalline rocks from the surrounding region and is transported downstream and deposited by 

alluvial processes. India has large monazite rich sand deposits but deposits also exist in many other places, for 

example Madagascar and South Africa.

9. EXPLORATION 

Prior to the involvement of Tasman Metals Ltd in the Olserum project, the most significant exploration was 

undertaken by Swedish mining company IGE Nordic AB in the period 2003-2006 (See Figures 12-14) .  

IGE Nordic AB (2003 – 2008) 

From 2003 to 2006, IGE Nordic AB undertook surface mapping, rock chip sampling, a small ground magnetic 

survey, drilled 31 holes, calculated an internal Mineral Resource and completed metallurgical testing.  The 

drilling program is described in Section 10 below, internal Mineral Resource in Section 6 above and 

metallurgical testing in Section 13 below.  

 

Figure 12 below shows the locations in outcrop of magnetite as mapped by IGE Nordic AB in 2005 on a local 

grid.  The drilled area lies centrally within the map.  Magnetite was deemed a significant exploration indicator.

Norrsken Energy Ltd (2008 – 2011) 

UK registered Norrsken Energy Ltd acquired the Olserum project in 2088 from IGE Nordic AB, with a view to 

pursuing uranium exploration.  IGE Nordic AB remained a shareholder in Norrsken Energy Ltd.  Norrsken 

Energy Ltd completed no work on the project. 

Tasman Metals Ltd (2011 – 2013) 

Following acquisition of the Olserum project, Tasman has reviewed and interpreted historic information, 

undertaken field mapping and grab sampling over the historic resource area, completed a small drilling 

program, identified samples in drill core for mineralogical analysis and prepared and dispatched samples for 

metallurgical testing.  Tasman's drilling program is described in Section 10 below. 

 

Grab sample locations are given in Figure 15.  Samples were taken to confirm the tenor of mineralized outcrops 

around the area of interest.

10. DRILLING 

IGE Nordic AB (2003 – 2008) 

During 2004 to 2005 a total of 5130 meters in 31 drill holes had been completed at Olserum and adjacent 

areas. The bulk of drilling was done at the Olserum prospect where it tested perpendicular to strike on a profile 

spacing of approximately 40m.  Two drill holes were usually drilled on every profile, generally 40m apart down 

dip. 12 of the drill holes were drilled from north towards south and three drill holes were drilled from south 

towards north with various dips.   

 

Results from this drilling program were provided in full to Tasman Metals Ltd.  Most drill collars remain visible 

in the field today and drill core is securely stored with the Geological Survey of Sweden. 

Tasman Metals Ltd (2011 – 2013) 

During 2012 Tasman drilled 5 diamond drill holes totaling 997m in order to confirm the previous drilling by IGE 

Nordic. Two of the drill holes were drilled as twin holes, two holes was drilled in existing profiles and one drill 

hole in-between profiles. Field mapping over the area was completed and grab samples taken to confirm the 

mineralized outcrops. 

 

Of the 997m of drilling, 10.94m was overburden drilling, the remaining 986.06m being core.  The drilling 

contractor was GeoGruppen using BQTK (40.7 mm) core barrels on a Diamec 252 drill rig built on a six wheeled 

truck. The objectives were to confirm the historic drilling by making two twin holes and to make infill drilling 

with additionally three holes. Drilling was conducted on two shift basis seven days a week. A total of 459 

samples for assays were collected.   

 

Of the 15 historic drill holes drilled by IGE Nordic, Tasman staff has re-logged every hole and done infill 

sampling where needed. The hole numbers from the historic holes starts with the abbreviation OL followed by 

the year (04 or 05) and ends with the hole number. The same is done for the holes drilled by Tasman with the 

exception of the abbreviation which instead is OLR. 

 

All of the holes drilled by Tasman except one have been deviation surveyed by a Reflex Gyro together with 11 

of the historic holes. The start azimuth was determined with Reflex EZ-Trac. A summary of the drilling is shown 

in Table 10 and location of the drill holes is shown in Figure 16.

Core Recovery and Quality 

Core recovery was determined prior to logging and sampling on standard core recovery forms. Core recovery 

was generally very good, close to 100%. The rock competence is generally high. Fractured rock is encountered 

in local fault zones and particular at the northern granite contact.   

Core Orientation 

All five of the drill holes in 2012 program used the Reflex ACT II RD core orientation tool. Principal foliation and 

magnetite horizons were intersected at medium to high angle to the long core axis depending on the dip of the 

drill hole. This suggests that where the drill hole dip was lower and correspond to a high angle intersection of 

the foliation. The true thickness was closer of drilled thickness than vice versa.

Collar Location Surveys 

Drill holes were laid out with the aid of a GPS with hole spacing confirmed by tape and compass. The Swedish 

company Metria AB (Swedish land survey) conducted a DGPS survey during which the location of all 5 holes 

drilled by Tasman in 2012 where measured with an accuracy of between 0.05 and 0.2 m (XYZ). In addition, a 

majority of the historic holes were controlled measured at the same time to confirm the historic coordinates. 

All of the checked historic drill hole coordinates were confirmed as accurate and were not needed to be 

updated.

Downhole Surveys 

The drill holes in 2004/2005 drill program conducted by IGE were surveyed by a magnetic survey tool with 

station readings every 5 m. 

  

Due to the locally high magnetic disturbance Tasman used instead the Reflex GYRO tool with station readings 

every 3 m for the 2012 drilling program. Four of the five drill holes were surveyed. OLR12005 could not be 

surveyed due to a blockage. Tasman also re-surveyed 11 of the total 15 historic holes in order to get better 

quality data. Two of the historic drill holes are missing (OL0510 and OL0516) and could not be surveyed and 

another two drill holes (OL0511 and OL0519) could not be surveyed due to plugged holes. So in total 15 out of 

20 drill holes that make up the Mineral Resource are GYRO surveyed. The surveys were carried out using a 

winch mounted on a four wheel bike. The Reflex GYRO survey was controlled checked by the site geologist 

during surveying. Once the survey was finished the data was transferred from the Reflex GYRO's memory into 

the field PC. 

 

The collar azimuth was determined by surveying the top 20 m of the drill holes using the magnetic instrument 

Reflex EZ-Trac. In a few cases there were suspicion that magnetic disturbance could affect the azimuth reading. 

Therefore several holes were control checked by Metria making a DGPS survey on the azimuth of the casing.

11. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS and SECURITY 

Surface Sampling 

Nine surface samples were collected by Tasman geologists on mineralized outcrops from the Olserum project. 

The samples are not considered representative and have been superseded by Tasman's drilling data. The 

samples covered mostly the main mineralized outcrops within the resource.  

 

In addition, the Author collected two rock samples from the main mineralized outcrop within the central part 

of Olserum as part of his preparation of the NI43-101 report. The analyses and description of theses samples 

are provided in Table 12. Surface sampling by Mr Geoff Reed does not contribute to the Mineral Resource 

calculation contained within this report.

Drill Core Handling and Sample Preparation 

Core Handling 

At every run where possible, the drill crew drew a down hole orientation line on the core when the core was 

still left in the inner tube. Drill core was then placed by the drill crew in labeled wooden core trays together 

with depth blocks indicating the start and end of each run. Core trays were then transported to the closest 

access road and picked up by the site geologist for transportation to the logging facilities. 

 

Geotechnical logging was carried out by Tasman's geologist who pieced the core together before measuring, 

marked every meter with permanent markers and controlled checked it with drillers depth blocks.

Core Logging 

The historic drill core from 2004 – 2005 year drill program is stored at SGU's drill core archive in Malå and was 

re-logged and infill sampled by Tasman staff. During logging, the sample intervals were checked and corrected 

where needed.  

 

The 2012 drill program by Tasman was logged in Tasman's own facilities at the town of Gränna, some 150 km 

west of Olserum.  

 

Geotechnical logging of the core was carried out using customized logging sheets designed by Itasca 

Consultants AB. RQD, RMR and Q measurements and core orientation readings (when present) were taken 

prior to the geological logging. All original paper drill logs are kept on file. 

 

Geological logging was carried out on paper forms and later transferred into Excel spreadsheets. The logging 

captured the borehole number, collar position, date drilled, 'from-to' intervals, grain size, Color, rock type 

description, mineralization and lithological codes.    

 

Once geologically logged, core was then measured both magnetically using a handheld magnetic susceptibility 

meter and radiometrically with a RedEye Personal Radiation Detector. After marking the sample intervals, the 

core was photographed wet using a digital camera mounted on a tripod. Core pallets were sent to the certified 

laboratory ALS Chemex in Piteå in regular batches via independent contractor for sample preparation.

The total number of samples is 965. A total of 53 standard samples were inserted at a rate of approximately 1 

in 18 resulting in approximately 5.5% of the submitted samples being standards. In addition, a total of 151 

samples were taken as field duplicates, reject duplicates, check samples and blanks which make up 15.6% of 

the total samples. Excluding standards, field duplicates, reject duplicates, blanks and check samples 761 

samples totaling 1114.47m of the core was sampled.   
 

Length of the sampled units varies from 0.15 – 2.50m as sampling respected lithological boundaries.  Core was 

split by diamond saw at the ALS facilities in Öjebyn.  One quarter of the core was placed in a numbered plastic 

bag together with the corresponding sample ticket and the other three quarters was left in the core tray.  The 

core was cut taking in consideration the main foliation/banding of the rock. When it was possible to 

reassemble the core, the same quarter of the core was submitted for assay. The residual three quarters of drill 

core was viewed by the author in the SGU secure archive.  The archive is a key access only facility and there is 

no evidence that samples have been disturbed in any way since cutting. 

Density Measurements 

Rock density measurements using the Archimedes principle (dry & wet mass and water displacement) were 

taken for every sample of the core from the 2012 drilling program. The density device comprised a 5 kg 

electronic scale below which a water bucket was placed. Attached to the scale, inside the water bucket was a 

core sampler holder. The density method is as follows: 

 The balance is always reset to 0.00 g before each reading. 

 A dry length of core was placed on the scale and a record of the mass of the core in air was done. 

 The sample was then put on the core sampler holder in the water filled bucket and the mass of the 

sample under water was done. 

 The formula for calculating the density (specific gravity=SG) is: 

SG =  Mass in Air   

Mass in Air – Mass in Water 

All information was recorded on density measurement papers and put in digitally to Excel spreadsheet.  

Sample Quality 

ReedLeyton believes that the sampling methods and approach employed by Tasman are reasonable for this 

style of mineralization and consistent with industry standards. The samples are representative and there 

appears to be no discernible sample biases introduced during sampling.  The rocks on the property are fresh 

with little or no secondary minerals on the surfaces that would enhance metal values. 

 

Cutting of core and dispatch to the ALS Chemex laboratory in Sweden is in keeping with industry practice and 

security of the delivery chain is more than adequate.  All drilling and subsequent sampling and assaying during 

the 2012 drilling program was completed by independent persons and at no time was an officer, director or 

associate of Tasman involved.

Core Sample Preparation 

The author is independently familiar with the personnel and practices of the ALS Chemex facility in Piteå. 

Sweden.  All drilling samples were prepared by ALS Chemex in Öjebyn and analyzed by ALS Chemex in 

Vancouver. Canada. This laboratory is ISO accredited (ISO/IEC 17025) and, in addition, has been accredited by 

Standards Council of Canada as a proficiency testing provider for specific mineral analysis parameters by 

successful participation in proficiency tests. 

Crushing  

On arrival at the ALS Chemex facility in Piteå, Tasman's drill core samples were cross checked with paperwork 

emailed by Tasman's geological staff, then sawed, dried and weighed.  Samples that require crushing are dried 

at 110-120 C and then crushed with either an oscillating jaw crusher or a roll crusher.  The entire sample is 

crushed, but depending on the method only a portion of the crushed material may be carried through to the 

pulverizing stage. 

 

That amount, typically 250 g to 1 kg is subdivided from the main sample by use of a riffle splitter. If splitting is 

required a substantial part of the sample (the "reject" or spare) remains.  

Pulverizing  

After crushing, 250 g of was subdivided from the main sample by riffle splitter.  This 250 g was then pulverized 

using a ring mill with a specification that greater than 85% of the sample should pass through a 75 micron (200 

mesh) screen. 

Approximately 10-15 g of the pulverized sample was then shipped to the ALS Chemex assay laboratory in 

Vancouver, Canada for analysis.  The remainder of the crush reject and pulp are stored at ALS Chemex in Piteå. 

 

All sample preparation and assaying during the 2012 drilling programs was completed by independent persons 

and at no time was an officer, director or associate of Tasman involved.  

Sample Analysis 

All samples taken during Tasman's 2012 diamond drilling program at Olserum were analyzed at ALS Chemex in 

Vancouver, Canada using the ME-MS81 method as described below. REE rich samples that exceeded the 

reporting limit of the ME-MS81 method were further assayed by ICP-MS method ME-MS81h.  A total of 8 of 

the samples were re-analyzed for rare earths.   

 

The analytical specification for the ME-MS81 method is: A prepared sample (0.200 g) is added to lithium 

metaborate flux (0.90 g), mixed well and fused in a furnace at 1000°C. The resulting melt is then cooled and 

dissolved in 100 mL of 4% HNO3 / 2% HCl solution. This solution is then analyzed by inductively coupled plasma 

- mass spectrometry. 

 

Twenty nine samples, representing all significant rock types were also analyzed by a multi element ICP-MS 

method (ALS Chemex method ME-MS81d) to gain further whole rock element data.  This method is a 

combination of ME-MS81 and ME-ICP06 which adds 13 major elements so rock types can be determined.

For further details of all the procedures employed by ALS the reader is referred to the following website: 

www.alsglobal.com/Regions/Search.aspx.    ALS's website cites the following certifications:  

"....* NATA Accreditation (No. 825) – Accreditation is assessed to ISO/IEC Guide 25 "General Requirements for 

the Competence of Calibration and Testing Laboratories" 

 *   ALS has certification to AS/NZS ISO 9001:2000 (No. 6112) 

 * ALS has in place a Quality Management System that is structured to conform to the requirements of 

ISO 9002. This covers aspects such as Contract Review. Document and Data Control. Inspection and 

Testing. Calibration. Corrective and Preventative Action. Internal Audits and Training."  

ReedLeyton considers that sample preparation and analysis procedures for all core samples are of industry 

standard and should minimize sample error and bias.  

Tasman QA/QC 

Standards 

Tasman purchased one registered standard for REE's from Ore Research and Exploration PL (OREAS) 

(www.ore.com.au). In addition OREAS have on Tasman's request prepared two certified internal REE standards 

based on one low grade composite and one high grade composite from Tasman's project Norra Kärr. These 

standards were inserted to the sample stream at a rate of approximately 1 in 18, resulting in approximately 

5.5% of the submitted samples being standards.  These samples allowed Tasman to monitor the quality of 

assays during the drilling program.  A review of this standard data was completed by ReedLeyton as 

summarized in table 15 demonstrating that accuracy and precision of data was adequate during the duration 

of the drilling program and no regular bias is present within the data.  Any slight assay bias suggests an under 

reporting of grade rather than over reporting. 

 

In addition, ALS Chemex routinely inserts standard and blank samples into every sample batch.  This QC data 

was supplied to Tasman and subsequently to ReedLeyton.  A review of this data did not suggest any 

inconsistency in sample quality.

Field Duplicates 

As part of the quality control process, Tasman took 43 field duplicate samples at a rate of 1 in 22 

resulting in approximately 4.5% of the submitted samples being field duplicates. These samples allow 

Tasman to monitor the homogeneity of REE in the core. Any variation between parent sample and field 

duplicate sample could be accounted for by coarse grained mineralization influencing sample quality.    All 

QA/QC data for this Project has been deemed acceptable for the purposes of the Mineral Resource estimation.

Core and Sample Security 

ReedLeyton has discussed core and sample handling procedures with key geological and technical personnel. 

On the basis of these discussions, ReedLeyton believes that all core was well and securely packed and stored 

prior to transportation to the laboratory for processing. As a result ReedLeyton considers sample security to be 

adequate.  

 

ReedLeyton also understands that at no time was an officer, director or associate of Tasman involved in the 

sample preparation or analytical work and an independent laboratory was employed for sample preparation 

and analysis. It is therefore ReedLeyton's belief that it is highly unlikely that an officer, director or associate 

would have had the opportunity to contaminate the sample data. 

 

The plastic bags containing samples where then handed over  to  ALS Chemex preparation laboratory in Piteå.  

 

The rocks on the property are fresh with little or no secondary minerals on the surfaces that would enhance 

metal values. 

 

Cutting of core and dispatch to the ALS Chemex laboratory in Sweden is in keeping with industry practice. and 

security of the delivery chain is more than adequate.  All drilling and subsequent sampling and assaying during 

the 2012 drilling program was completed by independent persons and at no time was an officer, director or 

associate of Tasman involved.

12. DATA VERIFICATION 

Site Visit 

Personnel from ReedLeyton travelled to the Olserum Project with representatives from Tasman in June 2012. 

During this visit, a thorough validation of hole collar positions was undertaken using GPS. 16 drill holes from 14 

drill hole positions were checked and found to be accurately surveyed. Drill collar orientation was also checked 

and found to be consistent with the drill database as supplied to the author. Key geological features were 

surveyed during this visit such as magnetite, apatite and monazite-rich outcrops. These were later reconciled 

with the extrapolated positions from the drill hole logging and found to correlate well. 

 

The author also travelled to the core archive facilities of the Swedish Geological Survey where Tasman's core is 

securely stored. Five holes were selected by ReedLeyton for re-logging which were laid out in their entirety and 

logged. The re-logging of these holes confirmed the correlation of the higher grade zones with zones of higher 

apatite/monazite intensity and subsequently assisted in the interpretation of the high grade domains within 

the broader resource area. ReedLeyton checked a random amount of hard copy logs against the data provided 

in the database. These did not indicate any issue with data integrity.

Database Validation 

In the acquisition of Olserum from Norrsken Energy Ltd an access database were handed over which included 

drill hole collar, Assay, deviation survey and logging done by IGE Nordic from their 2004-2005 drilling project. 

All original files including assay certificate is also in Tasman's possession.  The author is of the opinion that 

these documents are authentic.  Adequate validation of this data was completed Mr Geoff Reed.  

 
ReedLeyton completed a full review of Tasman's drill hole database which included a review of all available 

assay certificates, drill logs, sample books and historical database. ReedLeyton found robust records allowing 

easy data auditing.  A comparison was made between assay certificates for the 18 holes used in this Mineral 

Resource and the Tasman digital database.   

 

During this review and audit by ReedLeyton, a number of observations were noted, these include: 

Field checking of drill holes locations demonstrated accuracy in all cases; 

 Down hole survey certificates are available. Field checking, original drill logs, and database were all 

consistent showing the appropriate angle and inclination of the drill holes completed;   

 Sample intervals were correct for assays entered.   

 The assay certificates, drill logs and sample sheets were available for all drill holes;  

 Loading of assay data from laboratory certificates was correct; 

 During the 2012 drilling program, Tasman assayed all intervals for REE by the same analytical methods 

at the same laboratory;   

 Approximately 1609m out of the total 3944.05m of the drilling was not sampled. as they were drilled 

into the host granite;

During this audit, no issues with the conversion of the database were identified. 

Quality Control Data 

Assayers ALS Chemex automatically employed standards and blanks in their normal assay procedure. Tasman 

included their own standards in the sample stream in addition to ALS Chemex's internal practice.  

 

Tasman has documented its duplicate-assay and analytical control program and demonstrated that there is no 

evidence of major systematic errors or bias in that data. 

Assessment of Project Database 

The audit of Tasman's data collection procedures and resultant database by ReedLeyton has resulted in a 

digital database that is supported by verified certified assay certificates, original drill logs and sample books. 

ReedLeyton has high confidence the REE assays used in the Mineral Resource Calculation are correct and were 

verified using the drill log and sample books. As comparison of the assay certificates and drill hole logs show 

consistency for the 2004/2005 and 2012 drill holes. ReedLeyton believes there is sufficient data to enable their 

use in a Mineral Resource estimate.  

 

The un-sampled zones within the deposit appear to be insignificant to the deposit and only contain zones of 

low grade mineralization. As a result, ReedLeyton believes these zones should be classified as internal waste 

zones of different rock type in any resource calculation. 

 

Based on data supplied, ReedLeyton believes that the analytical data has sufficient accuracy to enable a 

resource estimate for Olserum deposit. 

Check Sampling by ReedLeyton 

ReedLeyton independently re-sampled 78 intervals of 2004/2005 and 2012 year drill program.  A range of rare 

earth elements assay values were selected independently by ReedLeyton from borehole intervals to review 

potential variance over a range of grades. These samples were independently selected and requested by 

ReedLeyton to be dispatched and assayed at ALS – Chemex Pitea. The analytical method applied was ALS 

Chemex suite ME-MS81, a lithium borate fusion technique which is recommended for REE analysis. 

 

Final results were received by the author via direct email from ALS Chemex on 31 August 2012.  The raw data, 

analysis certificate and supporting QC data were received. Figure 25 provides analytical values for Y, comparing 

the original sample value versus the check sample value. There is very good agreement between the individual 

samples over a range of grades. 

 

All QAQC data for this project has been deemed acceptable for the purposes of estimation.

Density 

A total of 458 bulk density determinations have been completed with a range of values between 2.35 g/cc and 

3.86 g/cc. The majority of determinations range from 2.6 g/cc to 2.9 g/cc (Figure 26).  ReedLeyton has also 

divided the bulk density determinations by domain. The mean of the mineralization of 2.83 g/cc was used for 

the estimate (Figure 27).  The density determinations were calculated wet and dry weight volume 

determinations. Figure 27 confirms that the majority of the determinations average 2.7 t/m
3
.  The average for 

the waste rock determinations was 2.67 t/m

13.  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Following the discovery of significant mineralization at Olserum, IGE Nordic AB commissioned beneficiation 

tests to produce a physical concentrate.   

Minpro AB (www.minpro.se) was selected as the processing research laboratory.  Minpro is a Swedish 

production and consulting company working with research and process development in the field of minerals, 

mining and recycling. Minpro are well equipped and skilled for handling and dressing of ores and minerals and 

remain active in Sweden today.   

The Author has sighted the original processing report (in Swedish) plus an English translation of this report, and 

the working/analytical sheets that describe the recovery process.   The Author is of the opinion that these 

documents are authentic and represent work completed to a high standard.  Adequate validation of this data 

was completed by Mr Geoff Reed.  Furthermore, during checking of drill core the Author sighted numerous 

labelled locations in core where quarter core sample had been taken for the processing research.   

In 2005, Minpro was asked to conduct bench scale concentration tests on a composite sample from Olserum. 

The aim was to investigate the possibility to make a physical mineral concentrate, thus substantially lower the 

tonnage needed to be transported for further processing.  Simple gravity methods were considered worthy of 

first tests, due to the density contrast provided by the xenotime and monazite mineralization.   

 

The tests included two attempts with gravimetric concentration at bench scale. A 23 kg composite sample of 

quarter core from four drill holes was crushed to -5 mm in jaw and cone crushers. The first test was done using 

a Mozley separator (comparable to a shaking table) and the procedure was as follows. 

 

One representative sample of 1 kg was ground to -300 μm. The sample was passed through a weak magnetic 

separator to remove magnetite.  The non magnetic portion was screened into one fine grained and one coarse 

grained fraction at 106 μm.  The two fractions were then separated gravimetrically on a Mozley-separator in 

order to recover the heavy minerals. 

 

When combining the two fractions (coarse and fine) a concentrate of 14% of the total mass grading 5.5% rare 

earth oxide, recovering 76% of the REE's was produced.  The concentration of the fine grained fraction yielded 

a concentrate of 4.5% of the total mass grading 13.7%, recovering 59% of the REE's. 

 

The second test used a Falcon centrifuge as a gravimetric separator. The 1 kg sample was ground to -300 μm. 

The total sample was then separated in the centrifuge. Due to the lack of previous separation into fractions, 

the method performed poorly. 

 

The unoptimised Mozley-separator tests show excellent potential for recovery of a high value mineral 

concentrate from Olserum mineralization.  The results are in line with REE projects being explored elsewhere 

with monazite/xenotime mineralogy (Northern Minerals Ltd, Namibia Rare Earths Ltd).   

 

Tasman Metals Ltd has commissioned additional beneficiation testwork in the laboratories of the Geological 

Survey of Finland (GTK).  Representative core sample has been provided to GTK.  Mineral concentrate 

produced in beneficiation is planned to be used in future hydrometallurgical research.

No hydrometallurgical testing has been completed on the Olserum deposit.  Whilst hydrometallurgical 

methods present a key risk area in for REE projects, monazite/xenotime has a well established caustic leaching 

process as provided in Figure 28 below.

14. MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

The Mineral Resources estimated and disclosed herein supersede the Historic Mineral Resources as quoted in 

Section 6 above and apply current practices and assumptions.  

Resource Data 

Drilling Data 

 Thirty Six (36) diamond drill holes totalling 6,127.1m drilled into the Olserum area in 2003- 2005 and 

2012.  

 Data relating to the collar locations, drill collar orientations and drill hole surveys were sighted by the 

Geoff Reed in sections and plans of the day.  Individual hard copy data of down hole surveys or assays 

were sighted.   

 Geoff Reed inspected the area with the Issuer's personnel and was able to locate many 2012 drill hole 

collars, and selected 2003 -2005 collars.  

 Due to the locally high magnetic disturbance Tasman used instead the Reflex GYRO tool with station 

readings every 3 m for the 2012 drilling program. Four of the five drill holes were surveyed. OLR12005 

could not be surveyed due to a blockage in the hole. Tasman also re-surveyed 11 of the total 15 

historic holes in order to get better quality data. Two of the historic drill holes are missing (OL0510 

and OL0516) and could not be surveyed and another two drill holes (OL0511 and OL0519) could not 

be surveyed due to plugged holes. So in total 15 out of 20 drill holes that make up the Mineral 

Resource are GYRO surveyed.  

 All drill core for Eighteen (18) in Resource diamond drill holes has been located by the Issuer's staff in 

Granna, Sweden. Core from 11 holes has been inspected by Geoff Reed including 1 twin hole 

OLO0514.    

 Eighteen (18) diamond drill holes were included in the current mineral resource estimation.  Twin 

Holes not included in the resource calculation included OLO0514 and OLO0403.

Database Integrity 

 Capture of digital data was completed by the Issuer's staff.  Hard copy data has been verified and all 

data is stored in a database and managed by the Issuer. 

 Drilling data from drill programs were transferred in digital format by the Issuer's staff.   

 Digital data has been both randomly and systematically checked by the author and shown to be 

correct using a number of checks listed below.  Assay data in original laboratory sheets has not been 

sighted from the 2003-2005 drilling program.  

 Digital data used in the current study has been checked and found to be accurate using the following 

checks. 

o Check for duplicate collars. 

o Check for twin holes. Two twin holes. 

o Check for statistically anomalous down-hole surveys. 

o Check for overlapping assays 

o Check for zero-length assays 

o Checks for holes bottomed in ore 

o Check for assay values successively the same. 

o Check for assay spikes. 

 The digital data was compiled directly into Microsoft Excel by the Issuer, validated in Microsoft Access 

and exported into a csv format. The database was then imported into Maptek Vulcan software in the 

csv format. 

 The database for Olserum was condensed to Twenty (20) drill holes, which provided the verified 

information for compositing (specifically the collar, Survey, lithology and assay tables). The database 

included drill holes with recorded collar elevation.  

Drill Spacing 

 Thirty two (32) drill holes for 6,127.7m of diamond drilling were drilled at Olserum. 20 drill holes 

intersected mineralisation and were subsequently assayed.   

 Hole spacing was completed on a 40 metre by 40 metre drill pattern. 

 For wire framing purposes 291 degrees strike was considered the optimal orientation. Strike of 

mineralisation varied from 280 degrees to 300 degrees  

 Polygons were created every 40m through the twenty 20 resource drill holes at the project. 

Drilling Orientation 

 Holes have been drilled mostly at two orientations 20 degrees and 200 degrees at Olserum.

 Due to the amount of drilling and orientation, the true thickness is generally considered to be 80% of 

drilled thickness. 

 The likelihood that mineralisation is developed in an orientation other than that interpreted is 

considered to be low.  

Chemical Analysis 

 A total of 2262 samples from 36 drill holes were analysed in total at Olserum for diamond drill holes.  

 A total of 1737 samples from 18 drill holes were analysed in total at Olserum for diamond drill holes 

with the current resource estimation.  

 All samples taken during Tasman's 2012 diamond drilling program at Olserum were analyzed at ALS 

Chemex in Vancouver, Canada using the ME-MS81 method as described below. Rare earth rich 

samples that exceeded the reporting limit of the ME-MS81 method were further assayed by ICP-MS 

method ME-MS81h. A total of 8 of the samples were re-analyzed for rare earths.   

 The analytical specification for the ME-MS81 method is: A prepared sample (0.200 g) is added to 

lithium metaborate flux (0.90 g), mixed well and fused in a furnace at 1000°C. The resulting melt is 

then cooled and dissolved in 100 mL of 4% HNO3 / 2% HCl solution. This solution is then analyzed by 

inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry." 

Sample Length 

 All holes drilled at Olserum were sampled with an average of one (1) metre intervals. Check sampling 

by the Issuer at the request of the author used identical sample intervals. 

 Composites of the drill hole assays are generated using Maptek Vulcan software with run lengths of 1 

metre. 

 These composites honour the geological wireframes. Checking was undertaken by generating an Isis 

file and visually inspecting the result of the composite. 

 Specific components of the compositing include 

o Run Lengths of 1 metre; 

o Data Fields for all REEs were composited; 

o The composite file was then applied a tag for each composite with the character (gr(a 

to d) and rm(a to f)) in the 'bound' column. This new composite isis file was called 

olrrmgrsc.feb.isis and used in the estimation process.

Relative Density 

 Using the bulk density ("BD") density default function of Vulcan, the variable BD was populated.  

 The value 2.82 was run according to density test work by the Issuer previously attributed to various 

assays within the geology database. The author has created a file with an average BD taken between 

various TREO % grades within the resource. A value of 2.67 was attributed to waste blocks outside the 

resource. 

Geological Model 

 Mineral Resources has been calculated by the author on the bearing of 291 degree strike.  

 The project was drilled within an area approximately 400m x 100-150m.  

 The mineralization was intersected on all the drilling sections and is so far known to at least a depth of 

250m below the surface. 

 Mineralization strikes NW-SE and dips varies between 70 and 85 degrees to the NE. 

 Mineralization is present as six main mineralized bodies.  

 Two block model were constructed, named olr_feb13.bmf and olr_feb13_ok.bmg. The parameters 

used in the setup file olr_feb13.bdf for Olserum.  

 The block model was created using the one bdf file. This original block model contained only default 

values except for the variable domain, which was populated in relation to the six mineralized 

wireframes and four waste (granite) wireframes in which the blocks resided in. 

 A rotation of 21 Bearing, 0 Plunge and 0 Dip was applied. 

 Parent block size was 5m x 20m x 10m with sub blocks at 1m x 4m x 2m, with the mineralization 

limited to 5m X 20m x 10m. 

 The variables include the type and their default values before estimation. 

Wire Framing 

 Using the above drill hole data, wireframing of the geological boundaries were performed by joining 

digitized section outlines at a 40m spacing.  

 The digitized sections are snapped to drill holes within +/-20m influence using lithological boundaries 

for wireframe domains at Olserum. 

 Vertical plane sections were digitised at 200 degree orientation at 40 m spacing. There is sufficient 

evidence for continuity of the mineralised envelope between sections. 

 All modeled wireframes were checked in plan, cross section, long section and 3D rotated views  

 All geological wireframes were checked for crossing, inconsistencies and closure.

Grade Interpolation 

 Grade interpolation was undertaken using inverse distance and ordinary kriging defined by the 

domain wireframes. The allocations of composites were calculated using a hard boundary at the 

domain wireframes.   

 Using Maptek Vulcan's Estimation Editor the grade estimation was run for Olserum. Variables were 

populated using one single search ellipses with no cutoff to the mineralized domains.  

 Constant parameters used in this block definition file (bdf) and block estimation file (bef) include:

Minimum Width 

 No minimum width has been applied in the estimation of the Olserum Mineral Resources. 

Cut-off Grade 

 Cut-off grades between 0.2% and 0.7% have been assumed for the Mineral Resource estimation as 

provided in Table 27.  The range of cut-off grades are in keeping with those used in similar REE 

projects that have a predominance of heavy REE's. 

Additional Variables 

Once the estimations had run, a number of additional variables were added or calculated. These variables 

included: 

 The category variable, category. A script, resourcecatflagged.bcf was run on the block model. This 

script looked at the nearest neighbor distance variable ("samdis"). If samdis was >0, then the category 

variable was set to inf (inferred). This variable was used to classify the resource. 

 Using the BD density calculation function of Vulcan the variable bd was populated. The script was run 

according to density test work by the Issuer previously attributed to various assays within the geology 

database. The author has created a script file with an average BD taken between various TREO grades.

Mining Assumptions 

 The Olserum resource extends from surface to depth in a subvertical fashion.  Due to the 

shallow/near surface nature of much of the resource, open pit mining is considered likely.  Due to the 

heavy REE enriched nature of the mineralization, underground mining may be viable, should the 

resource confidence be increased and mineralization demonstrated to be economic.   

Metallurgical Assumptions   

 Gravity and magnetic processing was completed by a well known Swedish research facility.  Recovery 

of 76% was achieved in single pass unoptimized testing.  An acceptable recovery in excess of 75% may 

be assumed.  Further beneficiation testwork is in progress at the time of writing.  

 Hydrometallurgical testwork has not been substantially initiated by Tasman. While this remains an 

area of risk, the monazite/xenotime mineralogy has an established caustic flow sheet.  The minerals 

have been a prior source of REE's and ReedLeyton believes the limited data negatives effects the 

Mineral Resource. 

Expectation of Resource Being Mined 

 In order to demonstrate that the mineralization as estimated in the block model has a reasonable 

expectation of being mined at some time in the foreseeable future, ReedLeyton completed a mining 

optimisation exercise.   

 As the mining concept for the Olserum Deposit is currently surface mining, Whittle® software was 

used to generate a conceptual pit shell.  Notwithstanding the pit optimisation exercise, it has not 

resulted in an engineered and operational open-pit mine design.   

 Operating assumptions used for the Whittle® pit shell were based on the Preliminary Economic 

Assessment data from Tasman's more advanced Norra Karr REE project that lies 100km northwest of 

Olserum with similar grade and surface aspect. 

 The economic assumptions used to derive the optimised pit shell include: 

o Stripping Cost $tonne mined $3.66 

o Mining Cost $/tonne mined $3.66 

o Processing Cost $/tonne ore $41.48 

o REO Recovery 80.0% 

o Discount to TREO Basket Price 38.0% (accounts for REO separation charge) 

o Discounted TREO Price $31.0 kg 

o 5 percent mining loss, 5 percent for mining dilution 

o Exchange rate US$1 : CA$1 

 Overall, ReedLeyton considers these assumptions are fair for the purpose of determining reasonable 

prospects for economic extraction of the Olserum deposit but do not demonstrate that the 

mineralization is economic, since the exercise is not at the level of a Preliminary Economic Assessment 

and does not conform to the studies required for a Preliminary Economic Assessment.  

 Optimised pit shell was calculated using a cut-off grade of 0.17% TREO and contained 6.3 million 

tonnes at an average grade of 0.526% TREO. Waste within the pit shell was 11.5 million tonnes at an 

average strip ratio of 1.84 tonnes of waste per tonne of ore.  The optimised pit achieved a depth of 

185m below surface.  

 ReedLeyton found that, apart from a portion of the mineralization that falls below the pit shells as 

defined by the Whittle® model, the majority of the resource reports within the pit shell.  The resource

reporting below the pit shell is not considered impaired (and was not removed from the resource 

estimated herein) as it is of a grade that can be considered for possible future underground extraction 

(should the confidence in the resource estimates be improved).  

 ReedLeyton is unaware of any issues that materially and negatively affect the Mineral Resource 

estimate at Olserum.  These conclusions are based on the following:  

o The Company has represented that mineral rights have secure title.  

o There are no known marketing, political or taxation limitations.  

o There are no known infrastructure limitations.  

o There are no issues with respect to environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-

economic, marketing, political or other relevant factors that ReedLeyton is aware of that 

would materially affect the Mineral Resource.  

Mineral Resource Estimate 

This Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared in accordance with the CIM Definition Standards adopted 

on November 27th 2010. The classification of the resource at the appropriate levels of confidence are 

considered appropriate on the basis of drill hole spacing, sample interval, geological interpretation and all 

currently available assay data. 

 

Mineral Resources were modeled by ReedLeyton Consulting applying six different total rare earth oxide (TREO) 

cut-off grades, with a base-case resource estimated using a TREO cut-off of 0.4% (Table 26 - and 27 ). At this 

cut-off, Olserum hosts an Indicated Mineral Resource of 4.5 million tonnes grading 0.60% TREO and an Inferred 

Mineral Resource of 3.3 million tonnes grading 0.63% TREO both with 34% of the TREO being the higher value 

HREO (heavy rare earth oxide).  Table 28 and Table 29 provide the grade averages for rare earth oxides at the 

various cut-offs.

The calculated tonnage figures are literal, whereas the accuracy of the technique suggests that the values 
should be rounded to better reflect the order of accuracy. Hence the author has rounded the mineralisation 
tonnage to the nearest ten thousand tonnes as shown on Table 26 and 27.

3 The calculated resource is sensitive to cut-off grade which will be influenced by metallurgical operating costs.  Bench scale 
metallurgical tests were completed on an Olserum composite sample by Swedish consultants Minpro AB in 2005.   

4 The mineral resource estimate was completed by Mr Geoffrey Reed, Senior Consulting Geologist of ReedLeyton Consultants Pty Ltd, 
and is based on geological and geochemical data supplied by Tasman, audited by Mr Reed.  Mr Reed is an independent qualified 
person for the purposes of NI 43-101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators.  

5 The resource estimate has been classified as an Indicated and  Inferred Resource based on the distance-space between sample data 
within the current deposit outline. Variograms were obtained from the variography study of TREO, with the continuity analysis 
showing a reasonable fit model in the major and semi major direction for the mineralised domains. 

6 The resource estimate is based on: 

-  A database of 31 drill holes totalling 5,297m of diamond drilling completed by Tasman and the previous owner IGE  since 2004 
where samples were composited on 1m lengths.  All Assays by Tasman and IGE were completed at ALS Chemex's Vancouver 
Laboratory. 

-  Specific gravity (SG) has an overall mean of 2.70 g/cc from 458 SG readings. The mean of the mineralisation of 2.82 g/cc was 
used in the estimate and a mean of the host rock of 2.67 g/cc was used in the estimate 

-  Block model was estimated by ordinary kriging interpolation method on blocks 5m (x) x 20m (y) x 10m (z). 

-  Beneficiation test work has been completed at Olserum.  Magnetic and gravity tests produced a 5.5% TREO grade concentrate 
with 78% recovery.  Optimization  is in progress.  Hydrometallurgy tests are in progress and no information was available at 
the time of this resource calculation, however the xenotime/monazite mineralogy has been a previous source of REE's and

processing method is well known. 

7 Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resource estimates do not 
account for mineability, selectivity, mining loss and dilution. inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to 
have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  

Discussion 

The drill-defined Mineral Resource at Olserum begins at surface and is open at depth and to the east.  The 

resources comprise parallel bodies of mineralization, with lower grade intervening material, trending 

approximately east-west and dipping steeply to the north. Host rock to mineralization is a biotite and 

amphibole bearing foliated quartzite, with veins and patches of magnetite.  It is interpreted that mineralization 

may represent heavy mineral sediments which have been subsequently metamorphosed and folded. 

 Mineral Resources has been calculated by the author on the bearing of 291 degree strike.  

 The project was drilled within an area approximately 400m x 100-150m.  

 The mineralization was intersected on all the drilling sections and is so far known to at least a depth of 

250m below the surface. 

 Mineralization strikes NW-SE. and dips varies between 70 and 85 degrees to the NE. 

 Mineralization is present as six main mineralized bodies. 

 The sample spacing is approximately 40m x 40m x 1.0m.  

 No mining parameters are attached. 

 The mineralization is remains open laterally and at depth. 

CIM Definition Standards 

Following the enclosed audit of historical data, Tasman data, the compiled Tasman drilling database and the 

subsequent calculation of Mineral Resources, the quoted Mineral Resources at  Olserum are subdivided into 

CIM-compliant indicated and inferred categories on the basis of the close density of drilling, checked grades 

and inter-hole continuity.  

It is the opinion of the author that this Mineral Resource estimate for Olserum satisfies the definitions 

Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources as per the CIM Definition Standards adopted November 27
th

, 2010.

20. ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES. PERMITTING and SOCIAL or COMMUNITY 

IMPACT 

Environmental Permitting Requirements 

The Swedish Environmental Code is a combined code which contains general requirements for the environment, 

land and water use, environmental impact assessments. The code also enables European Directives e.g. the water 

frame work directive to be incorporated into Swedish law. The code also regulates areas of national interest 

including Natura 2000 areas, reindeer herding and mineral deposits. The ESIA chapter in the code summarizes the 

legal requirements for an EISA. More information can be found in sub-decrees from different authorities. The 

Swedish legislation requires the applicant to undertake an environmental (and social) assessment (in Swedish 

"MKB") at two different stages during the development of a mining project.  

 

The first MKB is produced when applying for an exploitation concession in accordance with the Minerals Act (SFS 

1194:45) from the Mining Inspectorate of Sweden ("Bergsstaten"). Although the exploitation concession follows 

the Minerals Act a MKB must be performed according to the requirements of the Swedish Environmental Code 

(1998:808). The produced MKB however, is to some extent simplified, e.g. no alternatives are needed to be 

presented or explored. The emphasis of the MKB is only to demonstrate that there are no obvious conflicts and 

that mining operation is possible with a minimum of impact on the surrounding land uses. The assessment is based 

on early project design information ("PEA" information). When granted, the company gets the sole right to the 

deposit for 25 years which at the end of the period may be extended further. Stakeholders also have the right to 

appeal to a higher court. Stakeholder consultation is in general not required but is recommended, and the County 

Administrative Board as well as the local municipalities (local environmental authorities) will provide comment on 

the MKB. Approval of the exploitation concession is required prior to submitting an application for an 

environmental permit to mine ("extraction permit") to the Land and Environmental Court (In Swedish "Mark och 

miljödomstol").  

 

The environmental permit application, under the terms of the Environment Code (SFS 1998:808), also requires an 

MKB. But an extended one, which is based on a more defined (definite) project description ("PFS" or "FS" level) 

than the MKB prepared for the exploitation concession application. Several alternative ways of mining, TMF 

designs and locations etc. must also be evaluated and described as well as transportation and processing options, 

noise and vibration etc. The environmental permit application must also be followed by a technical description 

which describes the future operations in detail. Again, the application is evaluated by the Swedish Land and 

Environmental Court with input from various regulatory authorities, the County Administrative Board, 

Municipalities, Swedish EPA etc. Stakeholder consultation is required during the application process. Once granted, 

mining operations can be started. Stakeholders also have the right to appeal the permit to a higher court.

No capital or operating costs have been provided by the issuer.   

 

22. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

No economic analysis has been provided by the issuer.   

 

23. ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

There are no known operators of any directly adjacent property or locally adjacent properties. 

 

24. OTHER RELEVANT DATA and INFORMATION 

There is no other relevant data or information relating to the Olserum Project. 

 

25. INTERPRETATION and CONCLUSIONS 

The following interpretations and conclusions have been made on the Olserum deposit from the findings of the 

Technical Report: 

 

 The deposit has resources of sufficient quality that warrants additional investigation. 

 A Mineral Resource estimate using an Ordinary Krieged interpolation method was completed by 

ReedLeyton. The Mineral Resource estimate in this Technical Report is reported using cut off grades 

which are deemed appropriate for the style of mineralization and the current state of the Mineral 

Resources.  

 Of importance for mine planning, the model accommodates in situ and contact dilution but excludes 

mining dilution. Block size is similar (1 x 5 x 2 meters) to expected small-mining units conventionally used 

in this type of deposit and appropriate for an open pit mine.   

 It is the opinion of the author that the Mineral Resources estimates for Olserum satisfy the definition of 

Mineral Resource as per the CIM Definition Standards adopted on or November 27th 2010.   

 Potential for increasing of the Mineral Resources are good with mineralization open down dip, which 

requires further drilling to investigate potential.

26.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

The recommendations provided here are based on observations in the Mineral Resource estimate detailed in 

Section 14. 

 

ReedLeyton recommends that Tasman complete in-fill drilling to increase the Mineral Resource confidence 

categorization of areas currently defined as Indicated to Measured. ReedLeyton estimates an additional 3000 m of 

in-fill and extensional drilling would be recommended, tightening the drill spacing to 20m sections and infilling 

some sections to 20m spacing to confirm inter-hole continuity in and around faulted zones.  Deep drilling to 

ascertain the depth of the Olserum is also recommended.   

 

Such drilling can be used to provide geotech data regarding rock stability in the area of the proposed pit.  

Additional holes may be required away from the mineralized area. 

 
Table 33: Olserum Follow Up Drilling Program 

FOLLOW UP DRILLING UNITS COST (CAD) 

10 x 300m DDH on infill sections $120/m $360,000 

4 x 200m DDH for geotech $120/m $96,000 

Geology, Logging, core cutting, support, geotech  $250,000 

TOTAL   $706,000 

 
A program of expanded mineralogical and metallurgical research is recommended to determine extractability of 

the REE's that are present at Olserum and identify preferred processing pathways for follow up research.  This data 

will be key for any potential future Preliminary Economic Assessment, in combination with other technical and 

economic information.  Expanded processing information shall also be required to increase the confidence of 

resources to measured status. 

 
Table 34: Olserum Metallurgical Test Program 

METALLURGICAL TESTING UNITS COST (CAD) UNITS COST (CAD) 

First metallurgical tests - beneficiation $100,000/test $100,000 

Detailed Mineralogy $25,000/test $25,000 

Follow up metallurgy testing - beneficiation $100,000/test $200,000 

Metallurgical tests - hydrometallurgy $50,000/test $200,000 

TOTAL   $525,000 

 

Success in metallurgical research will provide encouragement to move towards bulk sampling and establishment of 
a pilot plant on site. 
 
A Preliminary Economic Assessment that studies potential mining, processing, tailing disposal, community impact 
and environmental scenarios for Olserum and the associated cost centres is recommended pending the successful 
extraction of REE's in metallurgical trials.
