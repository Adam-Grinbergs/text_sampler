Executive Summary 
 

Introduction 

The Rönnbäcken Nickel Project (Rönnbäcken or the Project), owned by Nickel Mountain AB, is 
located in the northwest part of Sweden, about 20 km to the south of the village of Tärnaby, 
Västerbotten County. The Project comprises three discrete sulphide nickel deposits; Rönnbäcksnäset, 
Vinberget and Sundsberget.  

This report comprises a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) of Rönnbäcken and has been 
prepared by SRK Consulting (Sweden) AB (SRK) on behalf of Nickel Mountain Resources AB (the 
Company), the parent company of Nickel Mountain AB. This Technical Report conforms to National 
Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101). SRK most recently 
visited the property on 7 February 2011. 

As part of its work, SRK has prepared independent Mineral Resource estimates for Rönnbäcksnäset 
and Vinberget. In addition, SRK has reviewed all other technical work completed on the Project by the 
Company and its other contractors and consultants to a sufficient level to enable SRK to present its 
own opinions on the Project and to derive an audited NPV for this. 

The Company has initiated a pre-feasibility study on the Project and subject to the results of this, 
expects to commence a feasibility study in Q3 2012. 

Geology 

The Project is located in the Swedish Caledonian mountains and is hosted by rocks which formed 
approximately 400-510 million years ago. The geology in the Rönnbäcken area is dominated by the 
Köli Nappe consisting of phyllite and felsic to mafic metavolcanics and nickel bearing ultramafic 
rocks. The ultramafic rocks occur as lenses of various sizes over the Project area together cover an 
area of roughly 15 km2.  

The nickel-sulphide mineralization which is the target of the proposed mining operation is hosted by 
serpentines, tectonically displaced from the mantle into the crust, and is considered to be of epigenetic 
origin and to have formed during the release of nickel from olivine through a process of alteration and 
serpentinization of the precursor dunite and peridotite rocks. 

The Rönnbäcksnäset deposit comprises two separate serpentinized orebodies separated by between 
80 m and 140 m of chloritic phyllite. The orebodies dip at approximately 45° west in the north and 
flatten out into a bowl shaped geometry to a dip of roughly 30° north in the southwest. The deposit has 
a strike length of roughly 2.4 km and a width of up to 400 m at its widest point.  

The Vinberget deposit comprises a single homogeneous serpentinized tabular-shaped orebody (up to 
350 m thick, 300 m wide and 700 m long) which dips steeply to the northeast and plunges to the 
northwest. 

The Sundsberget deposit consists of a single serpentinite body that strikes in a north-northeast to 
south-southwest orientation and dips at roughly 30° to the north-northwest. The deposit extends for 
roughly 1.2 km along strike and is between 500 m and 600 m in width.

Mineral Resources 

Table 1 below presents the Mineral Resource Statements for the Project as a whole, combining the 
SRK statement for Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget, and the Mitchell River Group Statement for 
Sundsberget, which SRK has audited. As is typical of ultramafic-hosted disseminated nickel sulphide 
deposits, nickel is contained both in nickel sulphides and in silicates such as olivine and pyroxene. 
Conventionally with these deposits the reported nickel grades and recoveries are "Total Ni" which 
incorporates both the nickel in sulphides and silicates. For Rönnbäcken however, an analysis of the 
nickel in sulphide has been carried out through the use an analytical technique utilising a weak acid 
digest. Hence the term Ni-AC. This has enabled evaluation of the project based on the metallurgical 
performance of the nickel in sulphides only, rather than considering the deportment of nickel in both 
sulphides and silicates. The rational is that a high proportion of the sulphide nickel is recovered in the 
flotation process whereas the non-sulphide nickel reports predominantly to tailings. The Ni-AC results 
here are referred to in this Executive Summary report as "Sulphide Ni" grades and recoveries. 

Table 2 presents the iron resource for the Project. This has been classified as Inferred to reflect the 
current preliminary status of the mineralogical work. Specifically, in SRK's opinion, more information 
is required to be collected to enable the proportion of the total Fe that has potential to be recoverable 
in a concentrate to be determined to the level of confidence required by a higher category. 

Both are presented according to CIM Guidelines for the reporting of Mineral Resources.

Mine Optimisation, Design and Scheduling 

SRK generated pit tonnages and grades for scheduling purposes for each of the three deposits, based 
on the above resource models and cost and geotechnical assumptions as presented in the body of this 
report. The following key parameters were used in the optimisation process.

It is currently envisaged that ore production will commence simultaneously at Rönnbäcksnäset and 
Vinberget, with full production achieved in Year 2. Mining at Sundsberget will then commence in 
Year 5 and reach full production by the time the Vinberget deposit is depleted. The overall strip ratio 
is 0.72 (waste:ore). 

 

Figure 1: Production schedule 

 
The current study assumes contract mining using 700 t hydraulic shovels with 34 m3 buckets and 225 t 
haul trucks. 

Metallurgical Testwork 

A comprehensive test work program has been undertaken on the nickel sulphides to determine the 
mineralogical, comminution and metallurgical properties of the various mineralised zones within the 
deposit.   

The purpose of the test work program was to develop a process flow sheet that maximises recovery of 
nickel and cobalt whilst minimising the incorporation of penalty elements (eg magnesia) at the lowest 
achievable project risk. 

Recent test work has established that a nickel feed grade of 0.17% total nickel or 0.1% Sulphide Ni, 
can produce a concentrate with a grade of 28% at an 80% recovery of Sulphide Ni. 



SRK Consulting – Executive Summary 
Rönnbäcken PEA  Page v 

P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx April 2011 

Historical testwork was initially carried out by Boliden during the 1970s where a lab and large scale 
4000t pilot program, facilitated by test pit mining, achieved 26 to 34% nickel grade and 67 to 73% 
sulphide nickel recovery. Typically a primary grind of P80 44μm was required.  Autogenous grinding 
was used, comparing favourably to rod and ball milling. 

Phases 1-3 of labwork conducted by the Company largely at Outotec Finland's Research Center in 
Pori, indicated that a closed circuit recovery of 78% was possible at 28% grade.  Composites 
representing the first few years of production were used and ground to a P80 of 50μm.  This was 
demonstrated through minipilot operation, with a grade of 22% nickel at 80% recovery using the 
flowsheet in Figure 2. 

 

Figure 2: Simplified flow sheet 

Followup laboratory-scale testwork based at Outotec has indicated that concentrates with a grade of 
28% nickel at 80% sulphide nickel recovery could be produced from the same composite samples used 
in the minipilot operation.  These improvements were realised by introducing a new combination of 
flotation variables, most significantly a new reagent regime, along with slight changes to the 
flowsheet. A typical primary grind of P80 50μm was used. 

Process and Infrastructure Design 

The currently assumed Rönnbäcken concentrator design (Figure 3) consists of crushing, grinding, 
flotation, and dewatering steps, typical of concentrator operations in Sweden and Finland. SRK notes 
that a project in the region of a similar nature, in terms capital expenditure and process route, has 
recently been completed by the same engineering firm and that the process plant for this project is now 
operational.

Figure 3: Concentrator layout, Oblique View 

 
The conceptual concentrator design is derived from a conventional flowsheet, similar to that in other 
operations which successfully treat disseminated low-grade nickel sulphides. This design together with 
capital and operating cost estimates for the concentrator, has been prepared by Outotec AB (Sweden). 
The mill will have a capacity of 30 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) or 3,750 tonnes per hour (tph), 
and will produce approximately 95,000 tpa of nickel concentrate at 28% Ni. 

The processing plant site location has been selected to be in close proximity to the Rönnbäcksnäset 
deposit and the planned tailings management facility.  The plant layout has been chosen to utilize the 
natural geography and topography of the area (Figure 4).

Figure 4: Proposed Site Layout 

 
The key infrastructure required to support the Project as currently envisaged will comprise: 

 14 km of access road upgrading from the E12 highway to the project site. The associated costs 
will be negotiated with the Swedish Transport Administration; 

 4 km of 144kV power line to tie into the external grid, plus a 160 MW receiving main station 
220 V (four transformers), with internal electrical grid and substations to service the process 
plant, tailings area and mines; 

 mine roads connecting to the concentrator, waste dumps and tailings dam, including two 
causeways across the Gardiken reservoir;

 a 15 ha industrial pad for the process plant site; 

 a 2 km coffer dam protecting the Sundsberget pit from the reservoir; 

 buildings inclusive of changerooms, offices, restaurants, mechanical and electrical workshops, 
truck workshops, heated and cold storage facilities; and 

 a sewage treatment plant and recycling facilities.

Tailings Management 

The proposed design for the tailings management facility (TMF) is to construct a cluster of three cells 
that will require the construction of four dams, south of the Rönnbäcksnäset pit in Lake Gardiken, a 
hydro-electric reservoir. Deposition of the tailings will be achieved by spigotting the tailings over the 
TMF to maximise the storage capacity. Two clarification ponds will be constructed at both ends of the 
TMF. Tailings will be subject to a thickening process to produce a bulk dry density estimated at 1550 
kg/m3 and a top surface sloping of 4o, producing a tailings volume of up to 340 Mm3.

Figure 6: Proposed layout of the Project TMF 

 
Preliminary investigations on the waste rock and tailings indicate that there is low potential for 
development of acid rock drainage, although further testwork is required to confirm this.  

Environmental Considerations and Permitting 

There are four types of permits necessary to develop a deposit from the exploration stage to the 
development stage in Sweden. These are: exploration permits, exploitation concessions, environmental 
permits and building permits. The Company holds exploration permits for all three deposits. 
Exploitation concessions have been granted over the Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset deposits, 
supported by environmental impact assessment studies and an application for an exploitation 
concession over the Sundsberget deposit will be submitted during Q2 2011. Applications for 
remaining permits, environmental and building permits, will be submitted to the regulatory authorities 
in Q3 2012 and Q1 2014, respectively, supported by the appropriate studies in each case. SRK notes 
that final access to land and water areas is a process of negotiation that the Company will need to 
undertake and must be finalized before filing an application for an environmental permit, which has to 
be granted before mining operations can begin.  

Accepting the level of study and available information, the environmental impacts of the proposed 
project are not deemed significant. Following cessation of operations, the area is expected to return to 
a prior-to-intervention state except for the presence of pit lakes and new topographic highs from the 
storage facilities for waste rock and tailings, which shall be rehabilitated.   

Social and economic impacts will largely be positive particularly through new job creation, increased 
economy of the region and increased tax revenue to local authorities. Potential negative impacts stem 
from loss of land for other uses, e.g. reindeer herding, dwellings, recreational activities, fishing, and 
hunting. A present, artificial hydro-electric water reservoir will partly be occupied by tailings and 
embankments resulting in a slight loss of  storage capacity, which reduces the ability to keep water 
volume from summertime to wintertime, with a limited loss of power value (SEK 3M annually) for the 
producer as power in wintertime is priced higher than in summertime. However, the overall annual 
power production is not expected to be reduced. Eventual compensation measures will be negotiated 
with affected parties.

Economic Analysis 

SRK has constructed a pre-tax, pre-finance Technical Economic Model (TEM) to derive a Net Present 
Value (NPV) for the Project. The TEM is based on the technical assumptions developed from work 
undertaken by SRK and the Company, which SRK has reviewed and adjusted where appropriate. 

The economic analysis contained in this report is partially based on Inferred Mineral Resources, and is 
preliminary in nature. Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have 
mining and economic considerations applied to them and to be categorized as Mineral Reserves. There 
is no certainty that the production and economic forecasts on which this Preliminary Assessment is 
based will be realised. 

The economic analysis has been undertaken using US Dollar (USD) as the base currency. Any 
Swedish Krona (SEK) or Euro (EUR) derived costs have been converted at the exchange rates 
indicated in the Table 4 below, which summarises all of the key financial assumptions made. Table 5 
to Table 8 similarly summarise the technical and cost assumptions made and derived by SRK.

Cashflow projection and Project valuation 

SRK's NPV has been derived by the application of Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) techniques to the 
pre-tax, pre-finance cash flow. In summary, at a Ni price of USD9/lb and an 8% discount rate the 
Project has an NPV of USD316M. A summary of the results of the cash flow modelling and valuation 
are presented in Table 9 and Figure 8.

SRK Comments/Recommendations 

SRK has made several recommendations regarding work that it considers should be undertaken as part 
of the pre-feasibility study now planned, which are included later in this report. SRK is confident that 
should this be included then the technical and economic viability of the Project will be properly 
assessed.  

Most notably SRK has recommended that:-  

 Further assessment of the technical viability and economics of recovering of magnetite from the 
flotation tailings be undertaken as this has the potential to significantly improve the economics 
of the Project.  

 Exploration drilling be continued to evaluate the potential that still exists within the existing 
exploration permit areas.  Notably, in addition to target areas which are separate from the three 
currently identified resource areas, the Rönnbäcksnäset and Sundsberget deposits remain open 
at depth. 

Certainly, in SRK's opinion, the commissioning of a pre-feasibility study is justified by the potential 
of the Project and the timing and budgets proposed for this by the Company are reasonable given the 
work planned to be undertaken. Further, whilst the justification for a full feasibility study following 
this will be dependent upon the results of the pre-feasibility study, the preliminary budget proposed for 
this is of the correct order of magnitude for a Project of this nature and location.

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT FOR THE 
RÖNNBÄCKEN NICKEL PROJECT, SWEDEN 

 

1 INTRODUCTION 

This report comprises a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) of the Rönnbäcken Nickel 
Project (Rönnbäcken or the Project) and has been prepared on behalf of Nickel Mountain 
Resources AB (Nickel Mountain or the Company), the parent company of Nickel Mountain 
AB which is the project owner by SRK Consulting (Sweden) AB (SRK). The Company's 
primary focus is development of the Project, which comprises three nickel deposits, 
Rönnbäcksnäset, Vinberget and Sundsberget, all located in the northwest part of Sweden. 

SRK has prepared independent Mineral Resource estimates for Rönnbäcksnäset and 
Vinberget. In addition SRK has reviewed all other technical work completed on the Project 
by the Company and its other contractors and consultants to a sufficient level to enable SRK 
to present its own opinions on the Project and to derive an audited NPV for this. Notably, as 
part of this, SRK has reviewed the Mineral Resource estimate for the Sundsberget deposit 
that was undertaken by Mitchell River Group (MRG) with an effective date of 27 October, 
2010. 

The Project is at a conceptual stage but it is currently envisaged that it will comprise three 
open pit mines feeding a single conventional flotation processing operation and producing a 
concentrate product in which nickel sulphides will represent the commodity of primary 
value. 

The work undertaken by SRK in compiling this report has been managed by Mr Johan 
Bradley (CGeol FGS, EurGeol) and reviewed by Dr Mike Armitage (CGeol FGS, CEng 
MIoM3). Both Mr Johan Bradley and Dr Armitage are Qualified Persons (QP) as defined in 
National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators (NI 43-101). 

The details of the various contributing authors and their respective areas of technical 
responsibility are presented in Table 14 below.

2 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

Sections 3 to 12 of this report are to some degree extracts from the Company's report 
entitled "Technical Report On The Preliminary Assessment Of Rönnbäcken Nickel Project, 
Sweden, dated 6th November 2009" (the Scott Wilson PA Report), which was prepared by 
Jason J. Cox, Wayne W. Valliant, and Kevin C. Scott of Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle 
Associates Inc. on behalf of IGE Nordic AB (IGE), owners of the Project at the time and 
parent company of Nickel Mountain AB. 

The opinions and conclusions presented in the Scott Wilson PA Report are based largely on 
information and technical reports provided to the authors by the Company and its 
consultants. The additional information reviewed in preparing this report has also largely 
been provided directly by the Company and its associated consultants, contractors and 
business partners.

Notwithstanding the above comment, SRK has conducted face to face meetings with those 
consultants responsible for certain technical aspects of the Project. This included the 
exploration data capture undertaken by Company staff, mining and infrastructure aspects 
undertaken by Rolf Ritzén of Ritzén Consult, environmental and social impact assessments 
undertaken by Per Broman of Per B Consult and tailings management facility design 
undertaken by Tom Lundgren of Ambiental. 

SRK has also confirmed that the mineral resources reported herein are within the exploration 
permit boundaries given below and that the exploration permits and exploitation concessions 
as presented by the Company reflect the publicly available information at the Mining 
Inspectorate of Sweden. SRK has not, however, conducted any legal due diligence on the 
ownership of the exploration permits or exploitation concessions themselves.  

3 PROPERTY LOCATION & DESCRIPTION 

The Rönnbäcken Nickel Project is located 40 km by road south-southeast of Tärnaby, 
Storuman Municipality, Västerbotten County, as illustrated in Figure 10 and Figure 11. The 
Rönnbäcken K nr 1 exploitation concession is on Vinberget on the mainland south of Lake 
Gardiken. The Rönnbäcken K nr 2 exploitation concession is located on what now is an 
island, Rönnbäcksnäset, in Lake Gardiken. The island was created in 1963 when a hydro 
power station was built and raised the water levels. SRK understands that the Company 
intends to submit an application for an additional exploitation concession to cover the 
Sundsberget deposit on the mainland, directly to the north of Rönnbäcksnäset, on a hill 
called Sundsberget. The properties are centred at approximately: 

 RT 90 2.5 gon v; 148200E, 726600N 

 SWEREF 99 lat long (WGS84); north latitude 65°29'43"; west longitude 15°24'58" 

3.1 Property Description 

The Project currently comprises three discrete deposits: Rönnbäcksnäset, Vinberget and 
Sundsberget, located within and surrounded by two exploitation concessions and 7 
contiguous exploration permits, see Figure 11 below. The Vinberget deposit is located within 
the Rönnbäcksjön nr 1 exploration permit and is covered by the Rönnbäcken K nr 1 
exploitation concession. The Rönnbäcksnäset deposit is located within the Rönnbäcksjön 
nr 8 exploration permit and covered by the Rönnbäcken K nr 2 exploitation concession. The 
Sundsberget deposit is located within the Rönnbäcksjön nr 7 exploration permit. 

Notably, the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) classified the Rönnbäcken nickel deposits 
as "an Area of National Interest for Mineral Extraction" on 25 August 2010. Deposits of 
national interest are assessed and selected by SGU with reference to certain criteria relating 
to, for example, community development and emergency supply preparedness. Chapter 3, 
Section 7, paragraph 2, of the Environmental Code states that for such areas, the extraction 
interest shall be protected against measures that may be prejudicial to extraction.

3.2 Property Ownership 

There are four types of permits necessary to develop a deposit from the exploration stage to 
the development stage in Sweden. These are: exploration permits, exploitation concessions, 
environmental permits, and building permits. For the purpose of this report, the exploration 
permits and exploitation concessions are all that are required to provide the Company with 
exclusive mineral rights to the properties in question. Notwithstanding this, SRK notes that 
final access to land and water areas is a process of negotiation that the Company will need to 
undertake and must be finalized before filing an application for an environmental permit. No 
estimate of the cost of this has been included in the TEM presented later in this report. 
However, given the low population density and current land use in the Project area, SRK 
does not anticipate these costs to be material, although further study will be necessary, 
particularly with regard to reindeer husbandry (see also Section 17.9 Environmental 
Management). 

On June 2, 2010, the Company and IGE Resources AB entered into an agreement with 
Mitchell River Group Pty Ltd. ("MRG") of Australia (the "MRG Agreement") to form a 
strategic partnership with MRG of Australia.  MRG has an experienced technical team that 
has conducted the work of resource evaluation,metallurgy, permitting, feasibility studies and 
project management for the developments of the Sally Malay nickel project in Western 
Australia, the Munali nickel project in Zambia and the Santa Rita nickel project in Brazil. 

Pursuant to the MRG Agreement, MRG agreed to provide experienced personnel, systems 
and technical resources for the development of the Rönnbäcken Nickel Project for an initial 
term of 18 months, commencing June 2010 and in return MRG received an option to acquire 
a 10% interest in the Project (the "Rönnbäcken Option") for an agreed upon cash payment.  
Pursuant to the MRG Agreement, MRG was entitled to accrue costs incurred during the term 
of the MRG Agreement and offset such costs against the cash payment.  Such costs not paid 
by the Company would accrue as a loan to the Company to a maximum amount of 
US$500,000 and would either be offset against the cash payment to exercise the option or be 
repaid by the Company.  To secure this loan, the Company agreed to grant MRG a fixed and 
floating charge over all assets of the Company (subsequently amended on March 21, 2011 to 
10% of the assets of Nickel Mountain AB).  Pursuant to the terms of the MRG Agreement, a 
steering committee was established comprised of experienced personnel from MRG and an 
equal number of representatives of the Company, and in consultation with the Company 
supervises the scope of work and provides strategic and technical advice to the Company.  
MRG is a resource investment group that specialises in the evaluation and development of 
base metal projects.  MRG provides funding and management for early stage resource 
projects, and has a strong value development track record in nickel projects.  Overall control 
of the Rönnbäcken Nickel Project remains with the Company.  The MRG Agreement was 
amended on March 2, 2011 by an amending agreement entered into among IGE Resources, 
the Company and MRG and provides that upon the filing of a final prospectus by the 
Company with any Canadian securities commission (the "Effective Date") the terms of the 
MRG Agreement will be amended to as follows: 

(a) after the initial public offering closing ("IPO Closing"), ongoing costs and expenses 
incurred by MRG on the Project will be charged to the Company; 



SRK Consulting (Sweden) AB 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 8 

File ref: P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

(b) the Company will no longer grant MRG a fixed and floating charge over all the assets 
of the Company and any charge registered by MRG shall be discharged; 

(c) all accrued costs and fees incurred by MRG up until the date of the IPO Closing will 
be paid by may be satisfied by cash or Shares of the Company; 

(d) MRG's Rönnbäcken Option to acquire a 10% interest in the Project will be replaced 
with a new option such that MRG will have the option to acquire that number of 
shares in the capital of the Company owned by IGE Resources AB equal to 10% of the 
issued capital in the Company immediately prior to the issue of securities of the 
Company pursuant to its initial public offeringIPO for the agreed upon cash payment; 
and 

(e) upon the Effective Date MRG will relinquish all right, title and interest to the 
Rönnbäcken Option and the Project pursuant to the MRG Agreement. 

The Rönnbäcken property consists of seven granted exploration permits (Rönnbäcksjön nr 1 
and Rönnbäcksjön nr 3 to nr 8), totalling 3,767 ha. Exploration permits are granted initially 
for three years, with possible extensions of up to 15 years. Annual fees for the first three year 
period are SEK4, SEK6, and SEK10/ha in each successive year. Table 15 summarizes the 
status of the Project exploration permits.

Applications for exploitation concessions for Vinberget (Rönnbäcken K nr 1) and 
Rönnbäcksnäset (Rönnbäcken K nr 2) were granted by the Swedish Mining Inspector on 
23 June 2010, see Figure 11 above. An exploitation concession (Bearbetningskoncession) 
gives the holder the right to exploit a proven, extractable mineral deposit for a period of 25 
years, which may be extended. The exploitation concession is the next step in mine 
permitting after the granting of an exploration permit.

There is no requirement to legally survey the boundaries of exploitation concessions in 
Sweden; instead boundaries are assigned Swedish RT90 coordinates by the Inspector of 
Mines on granting. The coordinates, in the Swedish RT90 system, of the exploitation 
concessions are presented in Table 17 below.

3.3 Additional Permits and Payments 

SRK is not aware of any special royalties in addition to the 0.20% royalties prescribed by the 
Swedish Mining Act, back-in-rights, payments or any other agreements associated with the 
Rönnbäcken Project.  

SRK is not aware of any environmental liabilities associated with the Rönnbäcken project. 

4 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, INFRASTRUCTURE 

4.1 Property Access 

4.1.1 International Access 

The nearest airport to the Project is Hemavan Tärnaby Airport in Hemavan, 19 km northwest 
of Tärnaby and roughly 40 km from the project area. The airport has daily flights to and 
from Stockholm depending on the season (Figure 14).

Figure 14: Hemavan-Tärnaby Airport 

 

4.1.2 Regional and Local Access 

The Project can be accessed from both north and south from highway E12. From the north 
via the town Tärnaby (E12), it is necessary to travel west for 9 km and then on gravel roads 
approximately 31 km passing the community of Ängesdal on the way to the project site. 
From the E12 in the south, over the Ajaure hydro dam, it is approximately 14 km of gravel 
road to the Project site. 

4.2 Physiography and Climate 

4.2.1 Physiography 

The elevation within the exploration permits ranges from 395 metres above sea level (masl) 
to 666 masl; that is, a difference of about 270 m from the lowest to the highest point. The 
exploration permits are in low mountain terrain which for the most part is covered by 
coniferous forest, principally spruce and pine trees, except for some higher areas in which 
birch trees predominate.  

Lake Gardiken surrounds the island of Rönnbäcksnäset and is controlled by Gardiken hydro 
power station which is located at the Lake Gardiken outlet in Umeälven approximately 
300 km from the river mouth. Water levels throughout the year may vary by as much as 
20 m.

The continental glaciation movement direction in the area is from the southeast. The till 
cover in the exploration permit is generally thin, but can be up to 20 m thick in some places. 
The most frequent type of exposed lithology in the area is ultramafic rock, as this rock type 
has been more resistant to glacial erosion compared to the surrounding phyllites.

of Vinberget 

 

4.2.2 Climate 

Northern Sweden belongs to the temperate coniferous-mixed forest zone (Köppen 
classification) with cold, wet winters, where the mean temperature of the warmest month is 
no lower than 10°C and that of the coldest month no higher than -3°C, and where the 
precipitation is, on average, moderate in all seasons. 

Between the years 1961 and 1990, the average annual temperature in Hemavan (about 15 km 
northwest of Tärnaby) was -0.5°C, with an average precipitation of 745 mm/year. Annual 
precipitation in the Lappland Mountains ranges between 1,000 mm and 1,500 mm. The mean 
winter temperature (December-January) in Tärnaby is -11.5°C, with occasional low 
temperatures of -40°C. Bogs, lakes and rivers are typically frozen for four to five months of 
the year. 

Exploration work can also be conducted during the winter by taking advantage of the frozen 
ground, which minimises environmental impact during access. Notwithstanding this, should 
the Project be put into operation, it should be able to operate throughout the entire year. 

Northern Sweden has aspects of both maritime and continental climate depending on the 
direction of airflow. When westerly winds from the Atlantic Gulf Stream prevail, the 
weather is warm and clear. When airflow is from the east, the Asian continental airflow 
prevails resulting in severe cold in winter and dry heat in summer. The mean temperature in 
northern Sweden is several degrees higher than that of other areas in these latitudes such as 
Siberia and southern Greenland due to the moderating effect of the Atlantic Ocean and the 
Baltic Sea.

4.3 Local Resources and Regional Infrastructure 

The Ajaure hydro power plant, rated for 85 MW, is located upstream of Lake Gardiken, 
approximately 12 km from the Project site by gravel road. European route E12 is 14 km from 
the Project site, running in a southeast-northwest direction connecting Storuman to the port 
of Mo i Rana in Norway. This port is 166 km distant and is the closest of three within 500 
km. The nearest rail access is at the town of Storuman, 107 km to the southeast. Water is 
plentiful around the site, but permission must be obtained to use it.

4.4 Surface Rights 

For the purposes of this report, all surface rights are covered by the Rönnbäcksjön 
exploration permits and Rönnbäcken exploitation concessions as detailed in Table 15 and 
Table 17 above. Additional permitting is required prior to commencement of mining 
operations and a discussion of these is presented in Section 17.9, Environmental 
Management, below. In addition, a discussion of potential tailings storage area, potential 
waste storage area and potential processing plant sites are included in Section 17 below.

5 HISTORY 

The chromite exploration campaign undertaken during the Second World War resulted in a 
discovery of nickel rich sulphides in ultramafic rocks collected in the Björkvattnet-
Seimajaure region. Some extraction test work for nickel was undertaken without success. 

The Boliden Mining Company (Boliden) first staked exploration permits in two areas in 
1942. Metallurgical tests to recover nickel were performed in the 1960s with promising 
results. Nickel metal prices were rising at the time and a number of companies began to 
explore in the mountain chain and investigated assay techniques for nickel. 

In the 1970s, Professor P. G. Kihlstedt at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in 
Stockholm conducted research studies on the extraction of nickel from the peridotites and 
serpentinites from the Caledonian mountain chain. The work was funded by the Board for 
Technical Development (STU, today NUTEC), The Northland Fund (Norrlandsfonden), and 
a private company which was part of the Johnson Group. Three diamond drillholes were 
drilled at the Murfjället, Graipisvare, and Rotiken properties funded by the Northland Fund. 
The cores were used for metallurgical test work. Boliden drilled one core hole in 1972 along 
the road below the Vinberget deposit. The core intersected 125 m of serpentinite and was 
used for metallurgical tests at KTH in Stockholm and Boliden. The surveys were 
supplemented by studies of the possible by-products, including magnesite and brucite, for 
extraction of magnesium. 

Boliden performed extensive studies during the 1970s on the sulphide nickel-bearing 
ultramafic rocks along the Caledonian mountain chain. In Rönnbäcken, grab samples were 
taken by blasting of exposed outcrops (68 samples in total). The samples were distributed 
over the exposed outcrops on Vinberget and on parts of Rönnbäcksnäset. The samples were 
analyzed for sulphur, total nickel, and bromine-methanol-soluble nickel. The latter was 
intended to determine the proportion of nickel present in nickel sulphides. Metallurgical tests 
were carried out on some of the samples. 

Boliden drilled a total of 21 holes in the area. Apart from the hole below Vinberget Hill, the 
company drilled 20 core holes on the Rönnbäcksnäset Island. The holes on Rönnbäcksnäset 
consisted mainly of short vertical holes of approximately 10 m, one vertical hole down to 50 
m, and one inclined hole (50°) to 81.4 m. Analysis was conducted on sulphur, total nickel, 
and bromine-methanol-soluble nickel. The boreholes were not drilled for the purpose of 
producing a resource estimate but rather just to highlight the vertical distribution of nickel 
sulphides. Analysis was made in intervals of 10  cm to 5 m. No significant leaching of 
sulphide nickel was detected at surface. The leaching of nickel in sulphides was to a depth of 
less than 0.5 cm to 1.0 cm which correlates to the weathering that also could visually be seen 
in the colour, brown to greyish, of the surface. 

Pilot mining of 4,000 t in an open pit was conducted by Boliden in 1974 adjacent to the road 
below Vinberget. The average grade of the bulk sample was 0.21% Ni, 0.11% Ni in 
sulphide, and 0.07% S. The sample was used for metallurgical test work in Boliden's pilot 
plant in Boliden which produced nickel concentrates grading 26% Ni to 34% Ni, 1.5% Co, 
5 g/t Au, and 2 g/t combined PGM at a sulphide nickel recovery of 67% to 73%. SRK notes 
that the grades of this sample are not representative of the current resource at the 
Rönnbäcken project.

The investigations in outcrops, core drilling, and beneficiation experiments were compiled 
and used for an application of exploitation concessions (called "Utmål" at the time, later 
replaced by the new term "Bearbetningskoncession") submitted in 1976 for an area on 
Rönnbäcksnäset and one area on Vinberget. 

An exploitation concession was only granted to those restricted areas where the drillholes 
and pilot mine were located, and not the parts that were sampled in outcrops. The 
exploitation concessions Rönnbäck nr 26 and nr 59 were granted to Boliden in 1982 
following the application in 1976. In 1990-1993, Boliden held an exploration permit in 
connection with the exploitation concessions, but no exploration was carried out. The 
exploitation concessions were released in 2003 by a notification of withdrawal from Boliden. 

IGE Resources AB was granted the Rönnbäcksjön nr 1 exploration permit in the area around 
Vinberget in 2005, which was later transferred to its subsidiary Nickel Mountain Resources 
AB in 2007. The remaining exploration permits were granted to the Company in 2007, 2009 
and 2010 and the exploitation concessions in June 2010. 

The Company carried out ground magnetic surveys and core drilling on Vinberget and 
Rönnbäcksnäset in the spring of 2008. In addition, metallurgical testwork was carried out on 
drill core material and material from Boliden's historic test mining pit. A first NI 43-101 
compliant report inclusive of a Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by Scott Wilson 
Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. and was published in April 2009.  

Geological mapping, geophysical surveys and outcrop sampling around the Project area was 
conducted in the summer of 2009 and the Scott Wilson PA Report was then completed in 
November 2009. Three new exploration permits were also granted, Rönnbäckssjön nr 5-7, 
during 2009. 

From the mapping and sampling carried out during the summer of 2009, several potential 
drill targets were identified. Drilling commenced at Sundsberget at the end of 2009 and 
following this, on several other targets in the Project area. A reconnaissance ground 
magnetic survey was then conducted in 2010, covering a large part of the Project area.  

On 12 February 2010 two exploitation concession applications were submitted to the Mining 
Inspectorate of Sweden (Bergsstaten), namely Rönnbäcken K nr 1 (Vinberget) and 
Rönnbäcken K nr 2 (Rönnbäcksnäset). These exploitation concessions were granted on 
23 June 2010, and took legal effect on 22 October 2010, due to an appeals process. On 
granting of the exploitation concessions, an extension to the exploration permit 
Rönnbäcksjön nr 2 was also granted, now called Rönnbäcksjön nr 8. 

On 5 October 2010, the Rönnbäcken exploration permits and exploitation concessions were 
transferred to Nickel Mountain AB.

6 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

6.1 Regional Geology 

The Project is located in the Swedish Caledonian mountain chain which formed 
approximately 400-510 million years ago with the closure of the lapetus Ocean, previously 
formed during the late Precambrian off the continent of Baltica. It is generally believed that 
the ocean crust moved downward along a subduction zone, with simultaneous build-up of 
sediment-filled basins linked to island arcs along the marginal zones of the ocean. The 
closure of the lapetus Ocean and eventual collision between the two continents Baltica and 
Laurentia, created an extensive rock complex that was then thrusted over the Fennoscandian 
shield. These units are termed allochthons, subdivided into nappe and nappe complexes, and 
may have been transported several hundreds of kilometres to the east or southeast over the 
shield. The top nappe is usually associated with the longest transport distance, while the 
lower units tend to be more local. Alpine-type ultramafic rocks are tectonically displaced 
from the mantle into the crust. They occur along nappe boundaries in the Scandinavian 
Caledonides and most frequently in the Upper Allochtonous which host the Seve and Köli 
nappes. The regional geology is illustrated in Figure 18 and Figure 19 below.

6.2 Local Geology 

The geology in the Rönnbäcken area is dominated by the Köli Nappe which is situated near 
the border to the Seve Nappe in the east. The Köli Nappe includes rocks of greenschist 
metamorphic facies and the Seve Nappe rocks, which are of higher metamorphic facies, 
mainly amphibolite facies. The rocks in the Köli Nappe include the Tjopasi Group which in 
the Rönnbäcken area consist primarily of phyllite and felsic to mafic metavolcanics and 
nickel bearing ultramafic rocks. The ultramafic rocks occur as lenses of various sizes over an 
area of approximately 15 km2. The complex folding has resulted in local variations in strike 
and dip. The ultramafic rocks are serpentinized, which is seen in the colour of the weathering 
surface. The most serpentinized rock is often grey, while more olivine and pyroxene rich 
rocks have a more brownish colour. The rocks vary from massive lenses to compositional 
layered rocks to erosion products such as serpentinite conglomerates and sandstones. In 
general, the ultramafic rocks are more serpentinized in the Köli Nappe, while the Seve 
Nappe consists of rocks that are more olivine and pyroxene rich and also contain less nickel 
in sulphides. Figure 20 illustrates the local geology.

6.3 Property Geology 

The geology in the immediate Project area comprises highly serpentinized rocks which have 
been the target for the exploration of sulphide nickel mineralization. Some of the ultramafic 
lenses known in the area are less serpentinized and are therefore of less interest for nickel 
sulphide mineralization. 

The Vinberget deposit comprises a homogeneous serpentinized tabular-shaped deposit up to 
350 m thick, 300 m wide and 700 m long. The serpentinite is steeply dipping to the northeast 
and plunges to the northwest. The mineralization is surrounded mainly by graphite bearing 
pelitic phyllite with intense quartz veining. A zone of soapstone between 1to 5 m wide has 
been intersected at the contact between the mineralisation and the phyllite. The foliation of 
the phyllite follows the contact zone. 

The serpentinite in the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit occurs as two horizons separated by 80 m to 
140 m of chloritic phyllite. The horizons dip approximately 45° west in the north and flattens 
out into a bowl shaped geometry to a dip of roughly 30° north in the southwest. The deposit 
has a strike length of roughly 2.4 km and a width of up to 400 m at its widest point. The 
upper horizon is thin and of less economic interest and is likely not present in the 
southwestern area. It is overlain by pelitic phyllites, while chlorite dominates altered phyllite 
between the upper and lower slab. The lower serpentinite horizon that is of economic interest 
is divided into four units: 

1.  Upper serpentinite unit. 

2.  Lower serpentinite unit. 

3.  Mafic intrusion unit (pyroxenite). 

4.  Low sulphur unit. 

The mafic intrusion is found mainly between the upper and lower serpentinite unit 
throughout the area. The low sulphur unit is found in the two western sections in the 
Rönnbäcksnäset south area. Below the lower serpentinite horizon, pelitic phyllites occurs. In 
the phyllite, minor quartz conglomerate horizons occur within a couple of metres of the 
serpentinite contact. 

The Sundsberget deposit consists of a single serpentinite body that strikes in a north-
northeast to south-southwest orientation and dips roughly 30° to the north-northwest. The 
deposit measures roughly 1.2 km along strike and 500 to 600 m in width. The serpentinite is 
overlain mainly by chloritic phyllite and pelitic phyllites. Below the serpentinite, in the 
footwall pelitic phyllites dominates but as at Rönnbäcksnäset there also quartz conglomerate 
horizons. There are mafic intrusions within the serpentine unit, but the geometry of these is 
not yet certain. 

Talc alteration zones are a common feature at the contacts zones between serpentinite and 
country rock in all three deposits.

7 DEPOSIT TYPE 

Mineralization in the project area is hosted by serpentine and is mainly of an epigenetic, 
nickel-sulphide type, with minor magmatic nickel sulphides. Nickel was originally located 
mainly in the olivine lattice in the ultramafic rocks, such as dunites and peridotites. 

Due to serpentinization of the olivine, the nickel in the olivine was released and nickel 
bearing sulphides were formed depending on sulphur availability. Olivine in the ultramafic 
rocks is magnesium-dominant and contains up to 0.5% NiO. Serpentinization of ultramafic 
rocks and the olivine occurs through the supply of water, S, and CO2. The reaction can be 
summarised as follows: 

Olivine (Ni) + H2O + S2 + CO2 → Serpentinite + Brucite + Carbonates + Fe3O4 + NixSy* + H2 

* Ni-rich sulphides 

By experimental studies, synthetic nickel bearing olivine has been serpentinized at 350°C 
under a pressure of 2 kbar by adding sulphur and water. Olivine was transformed to 
serpentinite, brucite, and magnetite, and nickel rich sulphides were formed such as millerite 
(NiS), pentlandite ((Fe, Ni)9 S8), heazlewoodite (Ni3S2), and bravoite ((Fe, Ni, Co) S2). Low 
sulphur fugacity favours the formation of heazlewoodite and nickel rich magnetite. At higher 
sulphur fugacity, lower nickel values are found in magnetite, including iron sulphides as 
pyrite. Dehydration experiments (at 500°C) have shown that, based on the presence of 
brucite and serpentine, it is possible to get reformation of new olivine which is more 
magnesium rich than the original olivine. This is interpreted as magnetite and pentlandite 
being stable during the created metamorphic conditions.  

8 MINERALIZATION 

8.1 Background 

To date, the majority of work to characterise the nature of mineralisation in the Project area 
has been undertaken on samples collected from the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits. 
As such, the following sections of this report focus on these deposits. The initial indication 
from visual inspection of drill core, multi-element ICP analysis and metallurgical testwork is 
that the nickel sulphide mineralisation at Sundsberget is of a similar character to that at 
Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget. 

The nickel sulphide mineralization in the Project area is hosted in serpentinized ultramafic 
rocks, which were altered from dunites and peridotites. The gangue mineralogy is dominated 
by antigorite, olivine, pyroxene, chlorite, carbonates (mainly calcite and dolomite), 
magnetite, and chromite.

Rönnbäcken PEA Page 22 

File ref: P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

The dominating nickel-rich sulphides in the deposits Rönnbäcksnäset, Sundsberget and 
Vinberget are heazlewoodite (Ni3S2), pentlandite (Fe,Ni,Co)9S8, often containing more than 
40% Ni and various amounts of Co, and to a lesser extent millerite (NiS). Other minerals 
found are cobaltite (CoAsS) and maucherite (Ni11As8), which probably are the most frequent 
arsenic bearing minerals. The dominating cobalt bearing minerals are pentlandite, millerite, 
and cobaltite. Only traces of pyrrhotite and pyrite are present. Nickel is also found in various 
amounts in olivine, serpentine, magnetite, and brucite. 

In Vinberget, pentlandite dominates as the most frequent nickel rich sulphide. In 
Rönnbäcksnäset and Sundsberget, however, the mineralization is more variable, both in 
terms of grade, nickel sulphide species and host rock type. In some parts, heazlewoodite 
dominates and in other areas pentlandite occurs as the most frequent nickel sulphide.  

The elements arsenic, gold, and sulphur are not unique to any of the lithologies and may 
have been introduced later or have been remobilized. Overall, the nickel sulphides are fine 
grained (often about 25 μm) and occur as individual grains in serpentine or oxides or as 
mineral aggregates together with other nickel sulphides or magnetite. 

8.2 Specific Mineralogical Studies 

Various mineralogical investigations have been carried out by Ekström Mineral AB 
(Ekström), Xstrata Process Support (Xstrata), Outotec Research Oy (Outotec research centre, 
or ORC), Finland, Qumex Material Teknik AB (Qumex), and more recently by the 
Geological Survey of Finland (GTK). The results of this work are summarised below. 

EKSTRÖM - OPTICAL MICROSCOPY 

Eleven samples from six drill cores, two from Rönnbäcksnäset and four from Vinberget, 
were sent to Ekström for basic mineralogical thin section study and for Scanning Electron 
Microscope/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) analysis of the sulphides. 

Rock forming minerals 

All of the samples were found to be dominated by serpentine, except one sample from 
Rönnbäcksnäset (RON 5801) which was found to be dominated by chlorite with lesser 
pyroxene. Carbonate was found to be common in samples from Vinberget. Chrysotile 
asbestos was identified in three of the samples. 

Opaque oxides 

Magnetite and chromite dominate the opaque minerals, with magnetite formed as an 
alteration product from chromite during the serpentinization process. 

Sulphides 

Pentlandite and heazlewoodite were identified in all samples except RON 5801, with 
pentlandite as the dominant sulphide phase. Accessory and rare sulphide phases are detailed 
below. The results of the study are illustrated in Table 18 to Table 20.

EKSTRÖM - QUALITATIVE FIBRE MEASUREMENT 

Two samples of diamond drill core from VIN30 at 219.2 m and RON58 at 52.3 m were 
selected for qualitative analysis of fibres, and examined with optical microscopy by Ekström 
for light refraction, anisotropy, angle of extinction, elongation, and pleochroism. Both 
samples showed the same optical properties as chrysotile. 

XSTRATA - QEMSCAN AND EPMA 

Mineralogical studies were performed by Xstrata using Quantitative Elevation of Materials 
by Scanning Electron Microscope (QEMSCAM) and Electron Probe Micro Analysis 
(EPMA) on four composite samples. The samples were composed of a quarter of the core 
and crushed and successively sieved to avoid the finest fraction.

The objective of the study was to characterise the Ni bearing species in each composite and 
to produce quantitative measurements of Ni deportment as a basis for comparison to total 
nickel and sulphide nickel chemical assays. The assays were completed at ALS Chemex in 
Vancouver Canada and at Labtium in Finland. Modal mineralogy, grain size distributions, 
and mineral composition data was also presented as part of the study. 

The modal abundance of gangue and sulphide minerals present in each sample is presented is 
presented in Figure 21 and Figure 22 below.

Figure 22: Sulphide Mineralogy in selected samples 

Modal analysis highlighted minor mineralogical differences between the RON53 and VIN30 
samples, including a higher percentage of carbonates in the VIN samples and the presence of 
brucite in the RON samples. The samples were also found to vary with respect to the 
proportion and type of Ni (Fe) sulphide as indicated above. Cobalt was found to occur in 
solid solution in pentlandite and millerite. A few cobaltite grains were also found. 

The following observations were made with respect to these Ni deportment calculations: 

 Gangue minerals (oxide + silicate) contributed approximately 30% of the total Ni in 
the VIN30 samples, and 40% of the total Ni in the RON53 samples. 

 The major Ni bearing sulphide in the two RON53 samples was millerite. A minor 
amount of the nickel was contributed from pentlandite and heazlewoodite. 

 The two VIN30 samples had different proportions of Ni-bearing sulphide species. 
VIN20 20-16 m contained much more heazlewoodite, compared to VIN30 192-198 m, 
which was dominated by pentlandite. 

One of the key objectives of the mineralogical study performed by Xstrata was to assess the 
reliability of assays, both in terms of total Ni and sulphide Ni. Analyses was completed on 
nine size fractions from VIN30 (20 to 26 m) plus the coarse fraction (-600/-300 μm) from the 
remaining composite. 

Reconciliation between total nickel chemical assays and calculated total nickel assays from 
the mineralogical analyses was found to be, in general, very good. The analyses were 
completed on the 9 size fractions from VIN30 20-26 m, plus the coarse fraction 
(-600/+300 μm) from the remaining three composites. The difference between measured and 
calculated total nickel was found to be less than 0.02% in nine of the twelve measurements. 
In one of the twelve comparisons the difference was marginally greater than 0.03%Ni.

A reconciliation between sulphide nickel content as determined from chemical assays and 
sulphide nickel content calculated from mineralogy was completed on the same twelve 
samples. Seven of the twelve measurements compared very well (within 0.01% Ni), while 
the chemical assay and calculated assay differed by 0.03-0.06% Ni in the remaining five 
samples. These results are summarised in Figure 23 below. 

SRK notes that comparison of calculated sulphide Ni determined from the mineralogical 
measurements was made against sulphide Ni assays performed at ALS Chemex using 
method ME-OG62. A comparison against sulphide Ni assays performed at Labtium using 
ammonium citrate hydrogen peroxide leach with ICP-AES finish (method code 240P), may 
have been more appropriate given that this is the Company's principal laboratory and assay 
method used for determination of sulphide nickel Rönnbäcken.

Nickel sulphide grain size distribution was assessed as part of the Xstrata study. The size 
fraction chosen for measurement was -600/+300μm, coarser than the liberation state, so as to 
ensure all textures and original grain sizes were maintained. QEMSCAN measurements of 
Ni-bearing sulphides were isolated and plotted as a distribution. All nickel-bearing sulphide 
species were combined and are referred to as Ni (Fe) Sulphide. A total of 11,121 Ni (Fe) 
Sulphide particles were included in this analysis. The grain size distributions of Ni (Fe) 
sulphide for each of the four samples given in Table 22 are presented in Figure 24 below. 

The results of the work indicated that the majority of nickel-bearing sulphides fall within the 
range of 15 to 50 μm with averages closer to 25 μm.

QUMEX - QUANTITATIVE FIBRE MEASUREMENT 

Samples were collected from particularly fibrous-rich parts in the cores and sent to Qumex 
for quantitative analysis of fibres. The samples were prepared, crushed, and pulverized for 
the standard intervals, for assaying of two metre core length. The samples were evaluated 
using an electron microscope with a magnification of 250 times, with 25 fields per sample 
evaluated regarding fibre content (volume units).

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF FINLAND (GTK) MODAL MINERALOGY STUDY 

A selection of samples including 48 thin section samples from Rönnbäcksnäset and 
Vinberget, and 32 drill core samples from Sundsberget were sent to GTK for modal 
mineralogy study by Mineral Liberation Analyser and measurement by XMOD-std. One thin 
section was prepared by for each of the drill core samples submitted from each deposit. The 
results are illustrated below. 

While serpentine is the dominant gangue mineral in all three deposits, there are slight 
differences in gangue mineralogy, with more pyroxene and chlorite at Rönnbäcksnäset and 
Sundsberget than at Vinberget.  Talc occurs at the footwall contacts. 

The modal abundance of magnetite is relatively constant in all three deposits, with slightly 
higher levels at Sundsberget.  Pentlandite dominates the sulphide mineralogy at Vinberget 
while Heazlewoodite is more prevalent at Rönnbäcksnäset and Sundsberget.

File ref: P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

The thin sections are regarded as indicative of modal abundance and SRK understands that 
more definitive mineralogy work is planned for work programmes going forward.

9 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Introduction 

Exploration programmes carried out to date at the Project have comprised geological 
mapping, outcrop sampling, ground magnetic surveys, magnetic susceptibility surveys and 
drilling programmes.  

9.2 Geological Mapping and Sampling 

The Company sampled serpentinite outcrops in the Rönnbäcken area for the first time in the 
summer of 2005 within the framework of a regional sampling programme. The programme 
included tests on several exploration permit along the borders of the Caledonian mountains 
with the objective of testing the serpentinites for potential nickel, platinum, and palladium. 

The Klumpliklumpen, Rotiken and Fjelkaområdet areas were tested in addition to 
Rönnbäcken. In total, approximately 70 samples were taken of which five were from 
Rönnbäcksnäset, four from the Rönnbäcksjön nr. 1 exploration permit, and one sample from 
the Rönnbäcksjön nr 4 exploration permit. In 2007, an additional 30 samples were collected 
by the Company, the emphasis this time being the serpentinite outcrops within the 
exploration permits Rönnbäcksjön nr 3 and nr 4. 

In the summer of 2009, the Company mapped approximately 15 km2 and collected 117 
samples for analyses by the ammonium citrate method for Ni, Co, Cu, and S in an attempt to 
identify ultramafic rocks suitable for future drill targets. Twenty-three of the samples 
returned values greater than 1,000 ppm (0.1%) Ni as determined by ammonium citrate 
method (Ni-AC). In addition to analysis of nickel in sulphides, analysis of major elements, 
trace elements and precious metals were performed as well as surveys of specific gravity and 
magnetic susceptibility. 

In total, the Company has now collected 157 rock samples from within the Rönnbäcken 
permits. 

9.3 Geophysics 

9.3.1 Magnetic susceptibility and specific gravity surveys 

Much of the magnetite in the project area is secondary, having formed during the process of 
serpentinization, and as such, has been used by the Company's geologists as an exploration 
tool in the field as well as during the core logging to identify areas of serpentinization and 
possible nickel sulphide mineralisation.  

Magnetic susceptibility measurements on core were initially taken routinely every metre, on 
every bag of coarse rejects, as well as on outcrops during the geological mapping 
programme. 

 

 



SRK Consulting (Sweden) AB 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 33 

File ref: P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

Measurements were taken with an SM-20 Magnetic Susceptibility Meter from GF 
Instruments, a hand-held instrument with a sensitivity of 1x10-6 SI units. The measurement 
gives relative readings and no corrections have been made for geometry or volume of the 
sample bags of coarse reject from the sample preparation of drill cores or rocks (see also 
Section 10.8 below).  

Field susceptibility surveys were carried out at Vinberget to identify the presence and extent 
of serpentinization of ultramafics in the project area. Measurements were taken at ten metre 
intervals on 20 m section lines. At each surveyed point, two measurements were taken 
separated by a distance of 10 to 20 cm on a flat surface of the outcrop. Sections were 
surveyed between 390N to 2140N in the Vinberget local grid. These surveys were carried 
out during July and August 2008 and a total of approximately 450 measurements collected 
from an area of approximately 17 ha were taken. 

In 2009, magnetic susceptibility surveys were taken on all outcrops mapped on the 
Rönnbäcken project. A total of 2,287 readings were taken. 

9.3.2 Ground magnetic surveys 

Between 2008 and 2010, ground magnetic surveys were performed with a GEM system, 
GSM-19T proton magnetometer. Measurements were taken at ten metre intervals along 
sections some 100 m or 200 m apart. For the reconnaissance survey of the Project area, 
measurements were taken at twenty metre intervals on 500 m sections.  The results of the 
ground magnetic surveys for each deposit are illustrated in Figure 31, Figure 32 and Figure 
33 respectively. Low magnetic areas, blue in Figure 32, are caused by rough topography and 
a consequent absence of data. 

Vinberget 

The first ground magnetic surveys at Vinberget were carried out in the spring of 2008 on the 
southwest side of the deposit. The survey covered sections 0 to 1200N, with additional more 
detailed measurements taken from sections 550N to 950N to better understand the 
horseshoe-shaped serpentinite outcrop south of Vinberget. During the same period in the 
summer of 2008, surveys were expanded to also cover the north side of Vinberget. 

In 2009, additional surveys were carried out to cover the remainder of the ultramafic rocks in 
the Rönnbäcksjön nr 1 exploration permit. In total, approximately 25 line-km have now been 
surveyed at Vinberget. 

Rönnbäcksnäset 

During the spring of 2008, ground magnetic surveys at Rönnbäcksnäset were carried out 
over sections 0 to 500E in the south area and 0 to 1300N in the north area. During the 
summer of 2008, the survey was expanded to cover sections 100W to 600W in the south 
area. Towards the end of the drill programme, the survey was extended further south to assist 
locating "satellite holes" RON205 and RON206. After completion of the drilling 
programme, the survey was extended in several areas to facilitate planning of the next phase 
of diamond drilling. In 2009, additional surveys were carried out to cover the remainder of 
the ultramafic rocks in the Rönnbäcksnäset area. A total of approximately 64 line-km have 
been surveyed at Rönnbäcksnäset.

Sundsberget 

A ground magnetic survey was carried out at Sundsberget in 2009 over an area of roughly 
3 km2 and using 10 m station spacing on 100 m spaced sections, totalling approximately 
21 line-km.

9.4 Geochemistry 

The only geochemical surveys performed in the area were the rock geochemistry 
programmes described above. 

9.5 Exploration Potential 

Exploration to date has focused principally on the Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset deposits 
and more recently on Sundsberget. 

The Rönnbäcksnäset deposit is open down dip of the existing drill data and the pit 
optimisation studies undertaken by SRK and described later in this report show the potential 
to increase the resources in this direction. SRK understands that the Company has recently 
drill tested the depth extension of mineralisation at Rönnbäcksnäset, that these holes have 
intersected serpentinite at expected depths and that initial indications are sulphide nickel 
grades are broadly consistent with the rest of Rönnbäcksnäset. Final assay results and a 
revised geological model from this phase of drilling are pending. 

Based on surface sampling and interpretation of ground magnetic data, the Company has 
drilled at three target areas outside the main deposits; Area 11, -13 and -7. Two of these 
targets (Area 11 and Area 7) are reported by the Company to have returned encouraging 
results and may add to the Project mineral resource indue course, should continued 
exploration activity at these sites prove to be successful (Figure 34). A discussion of the 
preliminary results obtained for each area is provided below.

Figure 34: Bedrock map illustrating exploration drilling in the Project area 
outside the main deposits. 

 
Area 7 

Two holes (VIN125-126) were drilled on a large ultramafic outcrop of rock northwest of the 
Vinberget deposit. Only two holes has been drilled to-date on the southern border of this 
outcrop, but, initial results from these holes are encouraging, and justify further drilling in 
this area in order to determine its potential.  

Area 11 

Four holes (RON207-210) were drilled on an outcrop of ultramafic rock on Rönnbäcksnäset 
Island, located just opposite to the Sundsberget deposit. The holes were drilled on the 
western side of the outcrop at a spacing of approximately 100 m. The positive assay results 
from this area justify further drilling in the area in order to determine the resource.

Area 13 

The last area to be drilled is situated east of the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit. Six holes 
(RON211-216) have been drilled to test out the eastern side of the island. Assay results and 
core logging do not indicate any strong serpentinization in the area. 

The following tables give the drill-hole coordinates and assay results for the drill-holes from 
area 7 and 11.

10 DRILLING 

10.1 Introduction 

The Company reported that a total of 21 historic holes were drilled by Boliden in the 1970s 
for 443.5 m.  

The Company commenced its Phase 1 drilling campaign, comprising approximately 
8,000 m, in April 2008. Phase 2, also approximately 8,000 m, started in October 2008, with 
drilling completed in January 2009. Subsequent to this, a drill programme was initiated in 
December 2009 and continued during 2010. Drilling at Rönnbäcksnäset was on-going during 
SRK's field visit in February 2011. All drilling has been diamond core drilling.  

All diamond drilling by the Company to date has been performed by the contactor Styrud 
Arctic AB (Styrud), previously known as Bergteamet AB and RATE Diamantborrning AB. 
Initially, two Onram 1000 drill rigs were used. These were later changed to Atlas Copco 
DIAMEC U6 rigs. Both drill rig types were mounted on Morooka 1500 band dumpers to 
drill BTW core (42 mm). Drilling in the Project area has consistently been undertaken using 
environmentally certified hydraulic fluids to minimise environmental impacts in the event of 
leakage.

The Rönnbäcken drillhole database provided by the Company and used by SRK to derive the 
mineral resource estimates for Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget includes information for 110 
drillholes, for a total of 17,193.35 m. The database does not include any holes drilled by 
Boliden and as such no historic drill data was used. The drillhole database provided by MRG 
for review by SRK included 33 drillholes for a total of 7,111 m.

Due to an absence of supporting information at the time of the Mineral Resource Estimate 
(MRE) conducted by SRK, certain drillholes were excluded from the database as received 
from the Company, as presented below in Table 27. In the majority of cases, drill holes 
lacking information were drilled during the winter 2009 programme with results pending. 

A summary of drillholes, total metres drill and associated total number of nickel assays 
(ammonium citrate method) used to derive the mineral resource estimates presented in this 
report is summarised in Table 26 below.

10.2 Vinberget 

Steep slopes on either side of the Vinberget ridge dictated the drilling pattern at Vinberget. 
Drilling was carried out in fans from a several positions at the top of the ridge and designed 
to achieve a horizontal distance between holes of 50 to 60 m at a downhole depth of 150 m. 
The drillhole locations are shown in Figure 37. 

The Company reports that drilling conditions were for the most part favourable, with 
occasional clay zones causing bogging of the drill rods, particularly when drilling towards 
the southwest. 

 

Figure 36: Vinberget drillhole collar locations 

10.3 Rönnbäcksnäset 

Drilling began on Rönnbäcksnäset northeast with three drill holes at 50 m intervals along 
100 m sections. Thereafter, a fourth hole was drilled in every second section to check for a 
possible downward extension of the mineralization and to investigate the associated 
magnetic anomaly. The drillhole locations are shown in Figure 37. 

Drilling conditions at Rönnbäcksnäset were found to be more variable than in Vinberget 
given the lower competency of some units.

10.4 Sundsberget 

The drillhole database supplied by MRG shows that drilling at Sundsberget was carried out 
on a 200 m line spacing with an approximate 80 m across strike spacing.  The drillhole 
locations are shown in Figure 38.

10.5 Casing 

The Company has indicated that casings above ground level were cut in accordance with 
Swedish Association of Mines, Mineral and Metal Producers' (SveMin) guidelines to less 
than 10 cm above ground, and sealed with the cap stamped with the drillhole number. SRK 
was however unable to confirm this due to the depth of snow cover at the time of the site 
visit. 

10.6 Downhole Surveys 

All the deviation surveys were performed using a Reflex Maxibor II instrument which 
measures the trace of the drillhole with optical technology. Surveys from Vinberget and 
Rönnbäcksnäset were mainly carried out by Company staff and, to a lesser extent, by 
contractors Sten Wikström, Skellefteå Bergsupport AB and/or Elin Broström, Styrud. 

The database received by SRK from the Company includes 50 holes from Vinberget, for a 
total of 3512 records and 54 holes from Rönnbäcksnäset for a total of 2949 records. 

The database received by SRK from MRG includes 33 holes from Sundsberget, for a total of 
2064 records. These surveys were mainly carried out by Company staff and, to a lesser 
extent, by contractor Sten Wikström.

10.7 Collar Surveys 

Drillhole locations were set out using a hand-held GPS. The collars were later surveyed by 
Tyréns and Mikael Norén using Leica System 1200 GPS technology, using the following 
projection and with the following measurement accuracy as presented in the final report, 
2008-11-03: 

 plan projection: RT 90 2,5 gon V 0:-15; 
 accuracy in plan projection ±2 to 3 cm; 
 vertical projeciton: RH 70; and 
 accuracy in vertical projection ±3 to 4 cm. 
 
The Company indicated that drill collar azimuths were calculated from two survey points, 
one from the top of the casing and another at the top of a 3 m long steel rod that were put 
down 1 m inside the casing.  
 
Holes drilled after 2008-11-03 were surveyed by hand-held Garmin 60csx GPS only. A list 
of these holes is presented in Table 28 below.

10.8 Core Logging 

A Company geologist or field technician inspected drill core at the site during drilling on a 
continuous basis and stopped the drilling at a predetermined depth in mineralized material or 
at a particular lithological intersection. The drill contractor was responsible for transportation 
of the drill core to the Company's core archive and logging facility in Skellefteå. 



SRK Consulting (Sweden) AB 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 45 

File ref: P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

The core was photographed and logged at the Company's logging facility. All of the 
Company's drill cores were logged by staff members or sub-contractors to capture relevant 
geological and geophysical (susceptibility logs) information. The geologic logging intervals 
were based on lithological variations in the rock and in addition a qualitative estimate of 
fibrous asbestiform mineral content was noted. 

Rock Quality Designation (RQD) measurements were taken on the basis of the assay 
intervals (roughly every 2 m).  

Initially, magnetic susceptibility was measured at every metre in mafic and ultramafic 
intersections, using a SM-20 instrument manufactured by GF Instruments. This procedure 
was abandoned in the 2009-2010 drilling campaign, with susceptibility measurements 
henceforth being taken only on coarse rejects representing assayed intervals. The database 
received by SRK from the Company contains a total of 2,703 magnetic susceptibility 
measurements from Rönnbäcksnäset drill core and 3,414 from Vinberget drill core. Magnetic 
susceptibility data was not supplied by MRG for the Sundsberget deposit. 

Density measurements were carried out by Company staff members or sub-contractors at the 
core logging facility using the water immersion method on unsealed drill core. Within the 
serpentinite, density measurements were taken at every assayed interval (every 2 m). 
Representative density measurements were also taken for the main waste rock lithologies. 
The Company database contains a total of 2,701 measurements for Rönnbäcksnäset, 3,416 
measurements for Vinberget and 2,972 measurements for Sundsberget, as reported by MRG. 

The specific gravity of the core was measured to obtain densities for use in the resource 
estimation procedure but also to get a value of the degree of serpentinization. The 
transformation of olivine to serpentine lowers the density from greater than 3.0 g/cm3 to 
2.7 g/cm3. For similar reasons, the magnetic susceptibility has been surveyed on drill core, 
outcrops, and on sample bags of the coarse rejects from the sample preparation. Magnetite is 
formed as a secondary product during serpentinization. 

All core logging data was recorded onto paper and later entered into Microsoft Excel 
spreadsheets. A hardcopy check list was prepared and completed as standard for each 
drillhole by the supervising geologist / technician to maintain data capture protocols. 

10.9 Interpretation of Results 

On the basis of the Company's drilling, mineralisation wireframes were digitized by SRK for 
Rönnbäcksnäset Vinberget using Datamine software. 

Rönnbäcksnäset is the larger of the two mineralised wireframes and contains the most 

drillhole intercepts. It measures 2.5 km along strike, 1.6 km on a 16⁰ azimuth, in the 
northwest, and 1.2 km along strike on an 85⁰ azimuth in the southeast. The south-eastern 
portion has a maximum true thickness of roughly 350 m and dips at 25⁰ towards the north-
northwest, while the northeast portion has a maximum true thickness of roughly 60m and 

dips at 40⁰ towards the west-northwest. 

The Rönnbäcksnäset wireframe was modelled to an elevation of -1m (ASL), and contains 
337.4 Mm3 of material.  



SRK Consulting (Sweden) AB 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 46 

File ref: P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

Vinberget measures 686 m along strike, on an azimuth of 321⁰, and 300 m across strike at 

the widest point. It was modeled to a depth of 307m (ASL), with a sub-vertical dip. The 
Vinberget wireframe contains 22.3 Mm3 of material. 

On the basis of the Company's drilling, a single mineralisation wireframe was digitized by 
MRG for Sundsberget again using Datamine software. Sundsberget measures 1,200 m along 

strike on an azimuth of 10⁰, and 500 to 600 m across strike at the widest point. It was 

modeled to a maximum down dip depth of approximately 500 m from surface, with a dip of 
40° to the west and contains 183.5 Mm3 of material. 

11 SAMPLING METHODS, APPROACH AND ANALYSIS 

11.1 Background 

The nickel sulphide mineralisation is relatively evenly disseminated and fine grained. Cobalt, 
gold, platinum, and palladium may also contribute to the value of the deposits, however, 
their distribution is less well understood. Magnetite is also evenly distributed at low grades 
throughout the serpentinites in all three deposits and the Company has recently initiated 
studies into the recovery of a magnetite concentrate.  

11.2 Samples for Assay 

All serpentinite core intersections were sampled, along with most of the weakly mineralised 
mafic unit at Rönnbäcksnäset to ensure that all sulphide nickel mineralisation was entirely 
captured.  

The core was marked for sampling by Company staff geologists or sub-contracting 
technicians, starting at the contact of the mineralization and then every two metres beginning 
at the first even numbered metre. Consequently every sample at the footwall and hanging 
wall of the mineralized material represents a non-regular length. 

Two metre sample intervals were initially selected to better understand the distribution of the 
accessory mineralization and to provide sufficient detail to correlate possible layered 
ultramafics. Sample intervals and numbers were either recorded onto paper and then entered 
into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, or entered directly into Microsoft Excel. SRK considers 
that the Company has sampled the host serpentinite in an unbiased fashion using a consistent 
technique for all intersections. 

Once assay results were issued by the laboratory (Labtium) in Excel format, they were 
merged with the sample interval data in Excel by either the Company's exploration manager 
or the project geologist. The merged files were imported into Micromine and validated. 

SRK notes that no systematic logging of core recovery has been carried out by the Company. 
However, serpentinite intersections in drill core observed during the field visit to 
Rönnbäcken and the Company's core logging and storage facilities in Skellefteå in 2010, 
showed very good recovery and generally good quality core. SRK does not consider core 
loss to be a material issue with regards resource estimation in this case.

area (Photo represents core from hole 16 at a depth of 275 m, Sundsberget) 

11.3 Thin Section Samples 

SRK understands that samples were systematically collected by the Company for thin 
section work at approximately 40 m intervals. 

11.4 Samples for Metallurgical Tests 

Two samples of 20 to 30 kg each were taken from the old Boliden test pit and were tested at 
Minpro AB. The pit is located at the road one kilometre north of the drilled area at 
Vinberget. The sample was a composite sample comprised of small fragments collected from 
throughout the pit.  

In an early stage of the drill programme, five samples of 30 to 35 kg each were taken for new 
tests at the Outokumpu Research Centre (ORC), three from Vinberget and two from 
Rönnbäcksnäset. The three samples collected from Vinberget comprise coarse reject from 
the sample preparation of two drillholes, VIN30 and VIN29. The sample from VIN30 
represented one lower grade zone higher up and one higher grade zone deeper down in the 
hole. A third similar type of sample was collected in VIN29. At Rönnbäcksnäset, two 
samples were collected from drillhole RON53 in the same way as in VIN30. RON53 is 
located in the north-eastern part of the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit. For the second phase of 
testing at ORC, two composite samples were prepared using coarse rejects from the two 
drilled areas at the end of the drill programme.

At Vinberget, all sample rejects were composited into a 2.5 t sample from selected holes. 
The 1,008 sample intervals and 1,216 m of core drilling represented intersected the 
mineralization at depths of between 630m to 500 MASL. At Rönnbäcksnäset, the samples 
were selected from coarse rejects from 15 core holes drilled in the south-western part of 
Rönnbäcksnäset. 

The samples were split in two halves, with one half included in the sample. A total of 264 
samples were included, weighing 366 kg and representing 528 m core drilling. This in turn 
represents approximately two years of production from the area down to 400 MASL. The 
sample was dominated by the upper pyroxene bearing serpentinite and comprises relatively 
little of the higher grade lower serpentinite zone with similarities to the Vinberget 
serpentinite. The sample also does not include any of the low grade mafic intrusion material 
or the low grade zone with almost no sulphides. 

SRK has recommended to the Company that it does further work to clarify metallurgical 
sample provenance (hole number, interval and sample weight) for more samples to support 
future studies and specifically to verify metallurgical representation, to understand test work 
results in the context of deposit geology and to provide support to core sample assays via 
reconciliation of concentrate grade with original sample grade. 

12 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

12.1 Introduction 

The sample preparation was conducted by a company independent of the Company, namely 
ALS Chemex in Piteå, Sweden.  

The aim of the sampling has been to delineate mineralization that could be recovered by 
established metallurgical methods, i.e., flotation of sulphide minerals. The adapted assay 
technique was therefore a partial-leach that selectively dissolves nickel in sulphides and 
leaves the nickel bearing silicates and oxides unaffected. As the sulphur content is low, 
analyses of sulphur must be performed by methods with low detection limits, better than or 
equal to 0.01% S. 

As the selective nickel leaching technique is not an accredited method for assaying nickel in 
sulphides, other accepted methods were included in the assay package such as Aqua Regia 
leach and Near Total Four Acid Leach. To support the values of the grades of nickel in 
sulphides, mineralogical studies and metallurgical tests were also carried out by the 
Company and are discussed elsewhere in this report.  

Sulphur assays from Four Acid and Aqua Regia digestion give higher sulphur values, when 
compared with associated sulphur-AC results. Sulphur assays using the ammonium citrate 
technique are thought to dissolve the free milled and the exposed sulphides at oxide and 
silicate mineral surfaces and thereby present a better indication of the nickel sulphides 
amenable to recovery by conventional milling and flotation techniques.

12.2 Chain of Custody and Sample Preparation 

The drill contractor was responsible for transportation of the drill core from site to the 
Company's core archive and logging facility in Skellefteå. 

During the logging stage, the core was measured and sample intervals selected by staff 
geologists or sub-contracting technicians for sample analyses. These intervals were marked 
on the core and on the core boxes. 

ALS Sweden AB, a subsidiary of ALS Chemex (ALS), was contracted to split the core and 
carry out the sample preparation. A separate room for sample preparation was set up for the 
Project as a precaution against the health risks associated with asbestos.  

The samples were logged in the tracking system, weighed, and split with a diamond saw 
(Almonte Core Saw). One half of the sawed core was treated according to ALS code PREP-
31, which included drying and crushing to 70% -2 mm (Tyler 9 mesh, US Std Nr 10). A split 
of up to 300 g was taken and pulverized to 85% -75 μm (Tyler 200 mesh, US Std Nr 200). 
The 300 g sample pulp was then split in two or three subsamples and sent to two different 
primary assay laboratories (Labtium and ALS Chemex). A third laboratory (ACME) was 
used for the control assays. 

The remainder of the coarse reject was labelled with the analytical number and stored at the 
assay laboratories. After a holding period at the laboratories, all of the rejects and pulps were 
returned to the the Company storage facility in Skellefteå. The pulps at Labtium Oy in 
Rovaniemi, Finland (Labtium), duplicates of the pulps stored in Skellefteå, have been 
discarded. 

A more detailed description of the sample preparation process is illustrated in the flowchart 
in Figure 40. Note that the sample split was modified to up to 300 g instead of 250 g.

12.3 Sample Analysis 

Two assay laboratories were contracted for the analyses: Labtium in Rovaniemi, Finland, 
and ALS in Vancouver, Canada. Check analyses were mainly performed by Acme 
Analytical Laboratories Ltd (Acme) in Vancouver, Canada. The analyses carried out by the 
three laboratories are summarised Table 29 and Table 30 below.

For exploration programmes during the past 12 months, the ME-ICP61 method was replaced 
by a "Complete Characterisation Package" which includes the methods ME-ICP06, ME-
4ACD81, ME-MS81. The new package is intended to provide additional information on rock 
type to aid in the geological interpretation. 

The database received by SRK from the Company, contained a total of 6,747 analyses, of  
which 6,125 related to primary core samples while 622, or 10%, comprised a variety of 
QA/QC analyses. This is considered by SRK to be a reasonable number of check assays. A 
summary of the analyses is presented in Table 31 below. MRG report a total of 293 QA/QC 
analyses, being 10% of the assays, for Sundsberegt.

SRK notes that for low grade sulphide deposits such as Rönnbäcken, the silicate nickel 
contribution to the nickel assay can be significant.  For this reason the Company has elected 
to characterise both the total and sulphide nickel content, the latter by partial leach methods, 
namely Labtium's 240P method (ammonium citrate and hydrogen peroxide). Further 
discussion of this is presented in Appendix 1 (Example Comparison of Analysis Methods). 

12.3.1 Labtium 

Labtium has FINAS T025 accreditation ISO/IEC 17025:2005. According to FINAS, "a 
laboratory's fulfilment of the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025:2005 means the laboratory 
meets both the technical competence requirements and management system requirements 
that are necessary for it to consistently deliver technically valid test results and calibrations. 
The management system requirements in ISO/IEC 17025:2005 are written in language 
relevant to laboratory operations and meet the principles of ISO 9001:2008 Quality 
Management Systems Requirements and are aligned with its pertinent requirements". This 
accreditation represents a higher standard than ISO 9001:2000. According to the website of 
Labtium, "Labtium's quality system fulfills the requirements of the Standards Council of 
Canada (CAN-P-1579), Guidelines for Accreditation of Mineral Analysis Testing 
Laboratories". However, the ammonium citrate leach procedure is not covered by the 
accreditation as the method is relatively new to Labtium.

Ammonium citrate hydrogen peroxide leach (AC), Labtium code 240P, is described as 
follows. A 0.15 g subsample is leached in a mixture of ammonium citrate and hydrogen 
peroxide (1:2; total volume 15 mL). The leach is done on a shaking table for two hours at 
room temperature. The solution is decanted from the sample powder directly after the leach. 
The solutions are diluted (5:1) and measured with ICP atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-
AES). It is a partial leach and is selective at dissolving nickel, cobalt, and copper from 
sulphide mineral species while leaving those elements in silicates unaffected. The detection 
limits are 10 ppm. 

This method was used to determine the recoverable nickel content for this Project, that is, 
specifically to obtain accurate estimates of the metals that can be recovered by established 
metallurgical methods, such as flotation. 

Aqua regia digestion, laboratory code 510P at Labtium, is described as follows. A 0.15 g 
subsample is digested with aqua regia (3:1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 
concentrated nitric acid) by heating at 90°C in an aluminium-heating block for 1.5 hours and 
diluted to 15 mL with water. An aliquot is centrifuged before instrumental analysis. Aqua 
regia is a partial leach for silicates, but is an almost complete leach for sulphides and oxides. 
It is a much better leach for this Project than the "near total" leach, however, as silicates are 
partially dissolved, even this method will overestimate the metal content. It is mainly 
included as a comparison to the sulphide nickel method for the sulphur content and other 
elements, such as arsenic, that can exist in sulphide phases. 

The results from Labtium are reported with three significant digits (zero uncounted) or <X 
where X is the detection limit. The latter is preferable to the ALS reporting method, even if 
the last digits are not significant. 

The Company report that for the 2009-2010 exploration programme, aqua regia digestion has 
been abandoned in preference for the 240P method. 

12.3.2 ALS 

ALS is accredited by ISO 9001:2000 overall and conforms to the requirements of CAN-P-
1579 and CAN-P-4E (ISO/IEC 17025:2005) by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) for 
a number of specific test procedures, including the two methods employed by the Company. 

ALS code ME-ICP81 requires the pulp to be digested with perchloric, nitric, hydrofluoric, 
and hydrochloric acids (HNO3-HClO4-HF-HCl). The residue is topped up with dilute 
hydrochloric acid and the resulting solution is analyzed by ICP-AES. Results are corrected 
for spectral inter-element interferences. Four acid digestions are able to dissolve most 
minerals. However, although the term "near-total" is used, depending on the sample matrix, 
not all elements are quantitatively extracted. Therefore, the leach is less useful to the Project 
as an estimate of recoverable metals. It is mainly included to demonstrate the need of the 
partial leach method and to provide an extra check of sulphur content. The elements 
analyzed and ranges of the procedure are shown in Table 32.

Table 32: Analytes and Ranges of ME-ICP81 

 

More detailed descriptions of ALS codes ME-4ACD81 and ME-MS81 follow.  For ME-
4ACD81, a prepared sample (0.25 g) is digested with perchloric, nitric, hydrofluoric and 
hydrochloric acids. The residue is topped up with dilute hydrochloric acid and the resulting 
solution is analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. The 
results are corrected for spectral inter element interferences. For ME-MS81, a prepared 
sample (0.200 g) is added to lithium metaborate flux (0.90 g), mixed well and fused in a 
furnace at 1000°C. The resulting melt is then cooled and dissolved in 100 mL of 4% nitric 
acid. This solution is then analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.

The results from ALS are reported by increments of the detection limits. For example, if the 
detection limit is 1, the result given is <1, 1, 2, 3, etc, with some exceptions such as Pb (<2, 
2, 3, 4, etc.). 

12.3.3 ACME 

Acme is accredited as complying with ISO 9001:2000. Check assays were mostly done at 
Acme using the four acid digestion and ammonium citrate methods. 

12.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QAQC) 

The Company Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QA/QC) programme comprised 
submitting sample blanks, standard reference samples, sample duplicates, and inter-
laboratory check samples. The approximate rate of sample submissions is summarized in 
Table 34 below. 

Table 34: QC Sample Frequency 

Sample Type Frequency 

Blank 1/50 

UM-4 (Reference material) 1/50 

Duplicate 1/25 

Interlab Check Assays 1/50 

 

Additional checks were done on near total and total nickel on coarse rejects. In addition, the 
laboratories performed analyses of duplicates, in-house standards, etc, which were also 
forwarded to the Company. The QA/QC results from the laboratory were checked as they 
were returned. 

12.4.1 Sample Blanks 

For the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits, the Company submitted 142 sample blanks 
into the sample stream to check for contamination and drift. The blanks were prepared from 
pale coloured granite and were inserted by the sample preparation laboratory (ALS Chemex, 
Piteå). For Sundsberget, MRG report that 72 sample blanks were submitted into the sample 
stream to check for contamination and drift. The blanks were prepared from pale coloured 
granite and were inserted by the sample preparation laboratory (ALS Chemex, Piteå). Of the 
72, 56 were also analysed through Labtium.  

The relevant checks are for Ni, Ni-AC, and Co-AC and their detection limits are 1 ppm, 
10 ppm, and 1 ppm, respectively.

12.4.2 Reference Material 

Reference samples were inserted in the sample stream to check the accuracy of the assay 
laboratory. Reference UM-4 sample was purchased from CANMET Mining and Mineral 
Sciences Laboratories (CANMET) and originated from the Werner Lake - Gordon Lake 
district of north-western Ontario, Canada. The reference sample is intended as a reference 
material for the determination of ascorbic acid/hydrogen peroxide-soluble copper, nickel, 
and cobalt in ultramafic rocks. There are no certified standards for the sulphide selective 
leach method used, mostly due to the lack of laboratories offering such analytical services. 
Therefore, no Round Robin Test was done and no performance gates were recommended 
which are normally based on the Round Robin statistics. The reference grades recommended 
by CANMET are 0.19% Ni and 0.007% Co. 

For the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits, the Company submitted 126 UM-4 samples 
for analysis by the ammonium citrate method (Ni- AC) described in Section 12.3.1 above. 
For Sundsberget, MRG report that Nickel Mountain submitted 72 UM-4 samples for analysis 
of which 60 were also analysed through Labtium by the ammonium citrate method (Ni-AC). 

12.4.3 Duplicate Pulp Samples 

For the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits the Company renumbered and submitted 201 
sample pulps to Labtium for assay as duplicates. For Sundsberget, MRG report that the 
Company renumbered and submitted 126 sample pulps to Labtium for assay as duplicates. 

12.4.4 Duplicate Coarse Reject Samples 

In the case of the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits, 28 samples of coarse rejects were 
renumbered and resubmitted for assay to test if the 70% -2 mm crush size would achieve 
repeatable results. For Sundsberget, MRG report that 116 samples were assayed as 
laboratory repeats. 

12.4.5 Interlaboratory Check Assays 

For the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits a total of 123 samples originally assayed at 
Labtium were submitted for assay at Acme principally as a check on the accuracy of the Ni-
AC results. For Sundsberget, MRG report that 33 samples were assayed at Acme. 

12.4.6 SRK Consulting Duplicate Samples 

During a visit to the Company's exploration office and core archive facilities in Skellefteå, 
SRK collected 16 sample pulps at random from the sample pulp archive originating from the 
Project area. These sample pulps were re-bagged, assigned a new sample numbers and sent 
to Labtium for assay by method code 240P. 

12.4.7 Density Measurements 

The specific gravity was measured at ALS Chemex (Piteå) on a total of 79 samples using the 
water immersion method. Of these samples, 44 were from Vinberget and 35 from 
Rönnbäcksnäset. MRG report that 2972 samples were measured by the Company at its base 
in Skellefteå using the water immersion method.

12.5 Security 

12.5.1 Storage Of Drill Cores 

Drill core, coarse rejects, and pulps are stored in a locked unheated storage building inside a 
fenced area at the Company's core depot in Skellefteå and a second secure facility at 
Bastuträsk. 

12.5.2 Database 

All project data are stored on the Company's exploration office server, with data backup. In 
addition, a full version of the database is managed through MRG in Perth, Western Australia, 
using industry standard DataShedTM software. 

12.6 Summary comments 

In SRK's opinion, the Company has developed appropriate logging and sample preparation 
procedures that enable the logical flow of the core from the drill rig through to sample 
dispatch; the core shed, logging, sampling and preparation facilities are clean, organised and 
appear well managed; appropriate security procedures are in place and the assaying has been 
carried out using appropriate techniques and by qualified laboratories.  

13 DATA VERIFICATION 

13.1 Introduction 

The following sections present SRK's analysis of the QAQC data provided by the Company 
for Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits. This includes blanks, reference material and 
duplicates as described above. The results of the QAQC have not been split into the 
individual deposits, but include all data supplied to SRK for both deposits combined. 

13.2 Reference Material (UM-4) 

Figure 41 shows the performance of the Labtium laboratory analysis of Ni-AC in reference 
material UM-4. The majority of results lie within 5% of the reference grade recommended 
by CANMET (0.19% Ni), there does not appear to be a bias over time and the results appear 
to be evenly distributed about the recommended grade. 

Figure 13-2 shows the performance of the Labtium laboratory analysis of Co-AC in 
reference material UM-4. The majority of results lie within plus 10% to minus 5% of the 
reference grade recommended by CANMET (0.007% Co) but the results exhibit a slight 
positive skew and appear to be distributed around plus 5% of the recommended grade. There 
does not, however, appear to be a bias over time.

Summary - Standards 

The results of the QAQC standards show that the majority of the samples fall within an 
acceptable range relative to the nickel and cobalt grades recommended by CANMET. Given 
that CANMET's recommended grades of the UM-4 reference material were obtained 
through a different dissolution procedure compared the methodology used by Labtium 
(ascorbic acid hydrogen peroxide leach as opposed to ammonium citrate hydrogen peroxide 
leach), SRK considers that these results indicate acceptable accuracy of assays for nickel and 
cobalt in sulphides. 

However, SRK notes that in addition to being referenced against a different assay method, 
the recommended nickel grade of the UM-4 reference material lies well above typical 
sulphide nickel grades found in the Project serpentinites. SRK has recommended therefore 
that the Company considers creating reference material from a composite of Rönnbäcken 
serpentinite as a more suitable means of gauging future exploration Ni-AC assay precision. 

13.3 Blanks 

Figure 11 shows the performance of the Labtium laboratory analysis of Ni-AC in sample 
blanks. The Company replaced all results reporting at less than the detection limit to 0.5 
times the detection limit, or 5 ppm Ni-AC. A total of 11 samples (8 %) had laboratory results 
which were at or above the detection limit of 10 ppm Ni-AC. Four samples (3%) assayed 
greater than twice the detection limit; that is, >20 ppm Ni-AC. 

The results indicate a potential for minor contamination during sample preparation at ALS 
Chemex or instrument drift during assaying at Labtium. The grouped nature of slightly high 
results may indicate periods in which the routine cleaning of equipment between samples 
was not undertaken thoroughly. An alternative explanation, though perhaps more unlikely, 
could be that minor silicate Ni from mafic minerals in the granite was leached in these 
instances.

Figure 44 shows the performance of the Labtium laboratory analysis of Co-AC in sample 
blanks. The Company replaced all results reporting at less than the detection limit to 0.5 
times the detection limit, or 5 ppm Co-AC. All samples returned values below detection 
limit. 

 

Figure 44: Sample Blanks Co-AC 

Summary - Blanks 

In SRK's opinion, the results of the sample blank assays indicate an acceptable level of 
contamination and drift at the sample laboratories. SRK has, however, recommended to the 
Company that it considers using barren quartz material for sample blanks to eliminate any 
potential for contamination of Ni from mafic minerals in the granite currently used as sample 
blank. 

13.4 Duplicates 

Figure 45 and Figure 46 show the results of the laboratory duplicates for Ni-AC and Co-AC. 
The duplicate samples show a strong correlation to the original sample and in SRK's 
opinion, sample preparation and analysis shows an acceptable level of repeatability.

13.5 Duplicate Coarse Reject Samples 

Figure 47 and Figure 48 show the results of the coarse reject duplicates for Ni-AC and Co-
AC. The coarse reject duplicate samples show a strong correlation to the original sample. In 
SRK's opinion, Ni-AC and Co-AC grades in coarse rejects exhibit an acceptable level of 
repeatability.

13.6 Interlaboratory Check Assays 

Figure 49 shows the results of the control analysis for Ni-AC carried out at Acme, against 
the original Ni-AC analysis carried out at Labtium. The control assays display a strong 
correlation to the original assays, with similar mean grades of 1126 ppm Ni-AC and 1133 
ppm Ni-AC for Acme and Labtium respectively. In SRK's opinion, the inter-laboratory 
check assays performed at Acme provide good support for Ni-AC assays carried out by 
Labtium.

Figure 49: Control samples Ni-AC Labtium against Ni-AC Acme 

13.7 SRK Consulting Duplicate Samples 

Table 35 details assay results received by SRK for 16 pulp samples sent to Labtium for 
analysis by method code 240P. Corresponding original assay results are presented for 
comparison. Results below detection have been amended to half the detection limit for 
consistency with the Company's data. 

Figure 50 and Figure 51 illustreate the results of SRK's duplicate sample analysis for Ni-AC 
and Co-AC carried out at Labtium by method 240P, against the Company's original Ni-AC 
and Co-AC analysis carried out at Labtium using the same method. SRK duplicates display a 
strong correlation to the original assays, with similar mean grades of 1116 ppm Ni-AC and 
1064 ppm Ni-AC, and 42 ppm Co-AC and 43 ppm Co-AC for SRK duplicates and originals 
respectively. 

The number of duplicate samples selected by SRK represents a very small proportion of the 
overall number of Ni-AC and Co-AC analysis carried out on the Project to date. 
Notwithstanding this, the results add further support to the repeatability of Labtium's 240P 
method for nickel and cobalt.

13.9 MRG QAQC Analysis – Sundsberget 

For the Sundsberget deposit, MRG undertook an analysis of the QAQC data provided by the 
Company. This includes blanks, reference material and duplicates as described above.  

For a detailed description of the results obtained the reader is directed to the MRE report 
generated by MRG. MRG concluded that the results of the Sundsberget QA/QC were 
acceptable and within the accepted accuracy and precision limits and that the database 
supplied by the Company was suitable for use in the Mineral Resource estimate for 
Sundsberget. 

13.10 Summary Comments 

SRK is of the opinion that the assay and density information available of sufficient quality to 
support the estimates of mineral resources presented later in this report.

16 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

16.1 Introduction 

This section of the report describes the work undertaken by SRK in developing Mineral 
Resource Statements for the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits. SRK's initial Mineral 
Resource estimate was produced in April 2010, at which time this was restricted to 
mineralisation which SRK considered had reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction by only reporting that material which fell within an optimised pit outline 
generated using parameters appropriate at that time. These parameters have, however, been 
updated for use in this current study and while no additional assay data has been supplied to 
SRK by the Company since the generation of the April 2010 models, the pit optimisation has 
therefore been re-run and the Mineral Resource estimate re-reported using the resulting 
outline. In addition, and due to the potential for recovery of a magnetite product, Fe has for 
the first time also been interpolated into the models.

SRK has also reviewed the work undertaken by MRG in generating a Mineral Resource 
Statement for the Sundsberget deposit and has included a description and opinion on the 
results and the quality of the work in the following sections. The reader is however directed 
to the Mineral Resource Estimation report completed by MRG for a more detailed 
description of the methodology applied. 

16.2 Statistical Analysis and Geological Domaining 

16.2.1 Introduction 

A statistical study of the data made available for the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits 
was undertaken to determine suitable geological domains to be used. It was clear that the 
dominant Ni mineralisation is limited to the serpentinite body at both the Rönnbäcksnäset 
and Vinberget deposits and that there is a hard contact with the host rock metasediments. 
Internal mafic units also contain low levels of Ni mineralisation that are present at 
Rönnbäcksnäset in addition to internal zones of non mineralised serpentinite that are present 
at Rönnbäcksnäset. The Vinberget deposit is a single body of serpentinite that does not 
contain any inclusions of mafics or internal non mineralised zones within the serpentinite. 

16.2.2 Rönnbäcksnäset 

The Rönnbäcksnäset deposit consists of a single serpentinite body that strikes in an east-west 
orientation in the south-western portion of the deposit and a north-south orientation in the 
north-eastern portion of the deposit. Figure 53 shows the drillhole distribution and solid 
wireframe created for the serpentinite body and Figure 54 shows the histogram of Ni-AC 
assays associated with the mineralised serpentinite body. As shown in Figure 54, two clear 
populations of data exist in the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit. Figure 55 shows the probability plot 
for Ni-AC for the same data with grade breaks being evident at 0.04% Ni-AC, 0.08% Ni-AC 
and 0.15% Ni-AC. When applying the identified grade breaks to the drillhole file, it is clear 
that a low grade domain exists in the north-eastern portion of the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit on 
the hanging wall side of the serpentinite body. Figure 56 shows a cross section containing 
drillholes RON54, RON53 and RON64 with the low grade Ni-AC domain being highlighted. 
The section shown also highlights the mafic units within the serpentinite.  

The Ni-AC distribution of the identified grade domains for the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit are 
shown in Figure 57 to Figure 60. The histograms show a near normal distribution within the 
mineralised serpentinite with the exception of a small low grade tail within the high grade 
population. This is related to individual low grade samples that cannot be domained out. 
Conversely, the mafic domain and internal waste domain show a high grade tail where 
individual samples occur within the larger modelled domain.

16.2.3 Vinberget 

The Vinberget deposit consists of a single serpentinite body that strikes in a northwest-
southeast orientation. Figure 61 shows the drillhole distribution and solid wireframe created 
for the serpentinite body and Figure 62 shows the histogram of Ni-AC assays associated with 
the mineralised serpentinite body. As shown in Figure 62, a near normal population of data 
exists in the Vinberget deposit. Figure 63 shows the probability plot for Ni-AC for the same 
data with subtle grade breaks being evident at 0.075% Ni-AC and 0.12% Ni-AC. When 
applying the identified grade breaks to the drillhole file, no clear trends in the mineralisation 
are observed. This is shown in Figure 64. The serpentinite body has therefore not been 
domained in any greater detail.

16.3 Geological Modelling and Block Model Creation 

The geological modelling was conducted in Datamine Studio 3 software and comprised the 
following: 

 importing the collar, survey, assay and geology data into Datamine to create a 
desurveyed drillhole file; 

 importing the topography data file; 
 the creation of mineralisation wireframes based on the logged serpentinite body and 

the grade domains outlined above; and 

 the creation of an empty block model coded by zone to distinguish the different 
geological domains identified (Figure 65 to Figure 67 and Table 36). 

  The empty block model created used a parent cell size of 50mN by 50mE by 10mZ 
for the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit and a 25mN by 25mE by 10mZ for the Vinberget 

deposit, representing a division of the current drillhole spacing observed at each 

deposit (Table 37). 

Table 36 shows the coding applied to the various geological domains in the Rönnbäcksnäset 

and Vinberget geological models. 

 

Table 37 shows the block model parameters used to build the empty block models for the 

Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits.

16.4 Available Data 

The Rönnbäcksnäset deposit consists of 54 diamond drillholes for a total of 7,770 drilled 
meters. Of this, 5,124 drilled meters have been assayed for Ni-AC. The Vinberget deposit 
consists of 38 diamond drillholes for a total of 7,602 drilled meters. Of this, 6,723 drilled 
meters have been assayed for Ni-AC.  This is summarised in Table 38 below.

16.5 Data Validation 

All available data was validated through the production of histograms and scatterplots and 
through the use of the Datamine drillhole validation tools upon creation of a desurveyed 
drillhole file. Twenty drillholes were removed from the database (17 drillholes from 
Vinberget and three from Rönnbäcksnäset) due to a lack of associated survey, assay and/or 
geological data, but no additional errors were found in the data files provided. SRK is 
satisfied that the data is suitable to be used in the Mineral Resource Estimate.

16.6 Raw Statistics 

Table 39 shows the raw statistics for the domains modelled at the Rönnbäcksnäset and 
Vinberget deposits. The main serpentinite zones are highlighted in red. As shown, the mean 
Ni-AC grade of the Rönnbäcksnäset high grade serpentinite is 0.111% and the mean grade of 
the low grade serpentinite is 0.054%. The mean grade of the Vinberget serpentinite is 
0.131% Ni-AC. 

The Coefficient of Variation (CoV) can be used to describe the shape of the distribution and 
is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. A CoV greater than one 
indicates the presence of some erratic high values that may have a significant impact on the 
final estimation. Within the main serpentinite domains, Table 39 shows that CoV values are 
very low, being 0.23 and 0.25 respectively and indicating the low variability of the data.

16.7 Compositing 

Data compositing is commonly undertaken to reduce the inherent variability that exists 
within the population and to generate samples more appropriate to the scale of the mining 
operation envisaged. It is also necessary for the estimation process, as all samples are 
assumed to be of equal weighting, and should therefore be of equal length. 

The majority of samples in both the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget drillhole files are 2 m in 
length with smaller samples being present at the geological contacts. Due to the very low 
CoV observed in the database and the near normal populations shown in the histograms of 
the raw data, all samples have been composited to 2 m as increasing the sample to a larger 
composite length has little impact on the variability of the database.

16.8 Density Analysis 

A comprehensive density dataset has been generated by the Company using the methodology 
described in Section 10.8. In total, 2,701 density measurements are present for the 
Rönnbäcksnäset domains and 3,416 density measurements are present for the Vinberget 
domains. Table 41 shows the breakdown of samples per domain for Rönnbäcksnäset and 
Vinberget deposits.  Density measurements have also been acquired for the waste domains 
allowing accurate tonnages to be determined for all material types.

16.9 Geostatistical Analyses 

16.9.1 Variography 

The 2 m composited drillhole database, coded by the modelled domains, was imported into 
ISATIS software for the geostatistical analysis. Variography was attempted on the main 
serpentinite ore domain (151), but due to the low number of samples and poor variograms 
produced in the low grade serpentinite domain (152) and the waste domains, variography 
was not possible and those produced for domain 151 were utilised in the interpolation of all 
other domains.

Directional experimental semi-variograms were produced for Ni-AC and Co-AC for the 
Rönnbäcksnäset deposit and omni directional experimental semi-variograms were produced 
for the Vinberget deposit. Directional semi-variograms were produced for Rönnbäcksnäset 
due to the interpreted dip and strike direction observed for the serpentinite body. Omni 
directional semi-variograms were produced for Vinberget due to the apparent lack of 
mineralisation trends in the sub-vertical serpentinite body. The directional semi variograms 
that were attempted for Vinberget, using a near vertical dip to the search ellipse, produced 
near identical ranges and structures in the down-dip, along strike and down-hole directions 
indicating the appropriateness of an omni directional variogram. 

The semi-variograms were produced using a 2 m (composite length) lag in the downhole / 
omni directional direction allowing the short-scale structures and nugget variance to be 
determined. Along strike and down-dip variograms for the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit were 
then produced with the nugget fixed from the downhole variogram, and using a lag spacing 
of 100 m with a 50% tolerance being applied to the lag spacing. 

Variograms were not produced for Fe with the Fe estimation using the variogram parameters 
determined for the Ni-AC data.   

Two sets of variograms were produced for the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit to better model the 
change in strike direction of the serpentinite body. 

Figure 68 shows the plane used to define the directional variography for the northeast 

portion of the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit, using a 016⁰ azimuth, 40⁰ dip to the west and a 45⁰ 

plunge.

Variograms produced for Co-AC showed similar structures and ranges. 

Density was modelled using omni directional semi variograms. These are shown in Figure 
77 to Figure 79. 

The results of the variography are shown in Table 42 and Table 43. 

All variograms generated can be found in Appendix 1.

16.9.2 Summary 

The directional experimental semi-variograms produced for Rönnbäcksnäset northeast 
allowed the generation of very robust variogram models to be generated in the downhole 
and down-dip directions (40° to the west) for Ni-AC and Co-AC. Along strike (016°) 
variograms were however poor, with little or no structure being observed.  

The directional experimental semi-variograms produced for Rönnbäcksnäset southeast 
allowed the generation of very robust variogram models to be generated in the downhole 
and down-dip directions (25° to the north) for Ni-AC and Co-AC. Along strike (085°) 
variograms were also modelled for Ni-AC with a simple two structure spherical model. Co-
AC variograms were however poor in the along strike direction. 

The omni directional experimental semi-variograms produced for Vinberget allowed the 
generation of very robust variogram models to be generated for Ni-AC and Co-AC.  

Similarly, the omni directional experimental semi-variograms produced for Rönnbäcksnäset 
and Vinberget allowed the generation of very robust variogram models to be generated for 
density. 

The results of the variography were used in the interpolation to assign the appropriate 
weighting to the samples pairs being utilised to calculate the block model grade. The total 
ranges modelled have also been used to help define the optimum search parameters and the 
search ellipse dimensions used in the interpolation. Ideally, sample pairs that fall within the 
range of the variogram where a strong covariance exists between the sample pairs should be 
utilised if the data allows. Applying a 2/3rd rule to the total range of the variograms in the 
search ellipse dimensions forces the interpolation to use samples where covariance between 
samples exists. As a result of the variography, ordinary kriging (OK) was deemed the most 
appropriate interpolation technique to be applied to Ni-AC, Co-AC and density.

16.10 Quantitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (QKNA) 

To better define the ideal search parameters used in the interpolation, Quantitative Kriging 
Neighbourhood Analysis (QKNA) was also undertaken on the data.

16.10.1 QKNA Process 

QKNA, as presented by Vann et al (2003), is used to refine the search parameters in the 
interpolation process to help ensure 'conditional unbiasedness' in the resulting estimates. 
'Conditional unbiasedness' is defined by David (1977) as "…on average, all blocks Z which 
are estimated to have a grade equal to Zo will have that grade". The criteria considered 
when evaluating a search area through QKNA, in order of priority, are (Vann et al 2003): 

 the slope of regression of the 'true' block grade on the 'estimated' block grade; 
 the weight of the mean for a simple kriging; 
 the distribution of kriging weights, and proportion of negative weights; and 
 the kriging variance. 

Under the assumption that the variogram is valid, and the regression is linear, the regression 
between the 'true' and 'estimated' blocks can be calculated. The actual scatter plot can 
never be demonstrated, as the 'true' grades are never known, but the covariance between 
'true' and 'estimated' blocks can be calculated. The slope of regression should be as close to 
one as possible, implying conditional unbiasedness. If the slope of regression equals one, the 
estimated block grade will approximately equate to the unknown 'true' block grades (Vann 
et al, 2003). 

During OK, the sum of the kriging weights is equal to one. When Simple Kriging (SK) is 
used, the sum of kriging weights is not constrained to add up to one, with the remaining 
kriging weight being allocated to the mean grade of the input data. Therefore, not only the 
data within the search area is used to krige the block grade, but the mean grade of the input 
data also influences the final block grade. The kriging weight assigned to the input data 
mean grade is termed "the weight of the mean". The weight of the mean of a SK is a good 
indication of the search area as it shows the influence of the Screen Effect. A sample is 
'screened' if another sample lies between it and the point being estimated, causing the 
weight of the screened sample to be reduced. The Screen Effect is stronger when there are 
high levels of continuity denoted by the variogram. A high nugget effect (low continuity) 
will allow weights to be spread far from a block in order to reduce bias (Vann et al 2003). 
The weight of the mean for a SK demonstrates the strength of the Screen Effect the larger 
the weight of the mean, the weaker the Screen Effect will be. The general rule is that the 
weight of the mean should be as close to zero as possible. QKNA is a balancing act between 
maximising the slope of regression, and minimising the weight of the mean for a SK (Vann 
et al, 2003). The margins of an optimised search will contain samples with very small or 
slightly negative weights. Visual checks of the search area should be made in order to verify 
this. The proportion of negative weights in the search area should be less than 5% (Vann et 
al 2003). 

QKNA provides a useful technique that uses mathematically sound tools to optimise a 
search area. It is an invaluable step in determining the correct search area for any estimation 
or simulation exercise.

16.10.2 Interpolation Process 

Neighbourhood tests were run on ore domains 151 and 152 for Rönnbäcksnäset and domain 
151 for Vinberget with the search ellipse dimensions being fixed against the optimum 
ranges identified in the variography and as highlighted in Table 44. Search ellipse range 
parameters were not tested in the QKNA process due to the robust variograms produced 
highlighting the optimum search ranges that should be used.  

Should an insufficient number of blocks be estimated using the optimum ellipse ranges, 
additional QKNA scenarios should be run to test the optimum ellipse dimensions at an 
increasing ellipse size. This was however, not necessary and all QKNA models were based 
on a first pass interpolation. 

Table 45 outlines the chosen parameters used in the QKNA tests.

The neighbourhood run was checked to ensure that an adequate number of blocks were 
filled ensuring that meaningful results were generated. The slope of regression was 
estimated into the individual models and each QKNA run compared. The results of the 
QKNA checks are shown in Table 46. As shown, a high number of blocks have been 
estimated using the optimum search parameters defined with a relatively high mean slope of 
regression in Rönnbäcksnäset (0.6 and 0.4) and a high mean slope of regression in Vinberget 
(0.85).

The distribution of Ni-AC slope of regression values is shown in Figure 80 to Figure 82 for 
Rönnbäcksnäset. A high slope of regression (>0.8) can be seen around well-informed blocks 
with the slope of regression value decreasing towards the base of the model where the 
blocks are less well-informed with sample data. The slope of regression data shows that the 
southwest portion of the deposit is better informed with data than the northeast portion of 
the deposit, despite the closer drill spacing in the northeast portion of the deposit.

16.11 Block Modelling 

16.11.1 Interpolation 

An empty block model was generated using the lithology wireframes with block dimensions 
as shown in Table 47. These block dimensions approximate half the drillhole spacing at 
Rönnbäcksnäset northeast and at Vinberget. Due to the low nugget effect observed at the 
Rönnbäcksnäset deposit, it is deemed appropriate to use blocks smaller than half the 
drillhole spacing at Rönnbäcksnäset southwest as it is assumed that blocks that are not 
supported by drillhole intersections are supported by data within the short scale range 
observed in the variograms. The results of the QKNA study also highlight that the blocks in 
the Rönnbäcksnäset southwest deposit are well supported by data. A block height of 10 m 
was chosen, being the assumed working bench height of the operating pit. Table 47 
summarizes the block model parameters.

Grades of Ni-AC, Co-AC and Ni-Total were interpolated into the model using OK and the 
kriging parameters given in Table 42 and Table 43. Ni-Total was interpolated using the Ni-
AC kriging parameters and represents the nickel present in both silicate and sulphide phases. 

All domains were interpolated using OK, with the mafic units and internal waste domains at 
Rönnbäcksnäset utilising the variography data determined for the main serpentinite domain 
(151). 

16.11.2 Search Ellipse Parameters 

The dip and strike of the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit varies, with the strike changing from a 
near east-west orientation in the southwest to a near north-south orientation in the northeast. 
Due to the varying nature of the strike, it was necessary to either divide the deposit into two 
separate domains based on strike, or use the dynamic anisotropy function in Datamine 
Studio 3 to move the search ellipse with the changing strike direction.  Dividing the deposit 
into unique domains based on strike, would have resulted in an artificial "hard" boundary 
between the northeast and southwest portions of the deposit beingan inaccurate 
representation of Rönnbäcksnäset geology, given that the nature of Ni-AC mineralisation 
appears to be consistent across these strike change boundaries. As such, dynamic anisotropy 
was selected to provide a continuous estimation and honour the observed geological 
structure in the estimation process.  

Dynamic anisotropy uses angle data generated from the orebody wireframe to assign dip and 
dip direction to every block in the model. The search ellipse is rotated upon estimation of 
the block by honouring the associated dip and dip direction of that block. Figure 85 shows 
the search ellipse generated at various points of the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit, with the dip 
and strike of the ellipse corresponding with the dip and strike of the orebody wireframe.

The Vinberget deposit used an isotropic search ellipse of 100 by 100 by 100 m. This is 
shown in Figure 86. 

 

Figure 86: First pass search ellipses used in the interpolation of Vinberget 
(looking north, search ellipse radii measures 100 m) 

Three different grade estimation runs with specific sample criteria were undertaken. The 
first run uses the parameters determined by the QKNA testwork and is considered the 
optimum set of interpolation parameters. The second run doubles the dimensions of the 
search ellipse and the third run multiplies the original search ellipse by a factor of ten and 
reduces the minimum number of samples required to estimate the block grades. The third 
run is designed to estimate any blocks not estimated in runs one and two and therefore, 
decreases the confidence in the estimation results. This is due to the search ellipse looking 
for samples that are greatly outside the geostatistical range of the samples as shown in the 
geostatistical analysis.  

Table 48 shows the search ellipse parameters used for the three estimation runs.

16.11.3 Block Model Validation 

The block model has been validated using the following techniques: 

 visual inspection of block grades in plan and section and comparison with drillhole 
grades; 

 comparison of global mean block grades and sample grades. 

Visual Validation 

Figure 87 to Figure 89 show examples of the visual validation checks between block Ni-AC 
grades and the input composite Ni-AC grade for the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit. The grades 
follow the strike and dip of the orebody showing that the search ellipse orientation has been 
used appropriately with Figure 89 showing that the grade has been interpolated through the 
change of strike of the serpentinite body.

homogenous nature of the Ni-AC distribution, grade trends are difficult to pick. However, 
from the cross section, long section and plan view, it is clear that the block model grades 
correspond well with the composite sample grades.

Global mean grade comparison 

Table 49 shows a comparison of the global block mean grades with the global sample means 
grades for Ni-AC, Co-AC and density.  

Overall, SRK is confident that the interpolated grades are a reasonable reflection of the 
available sample data with the key grade fields being well within acceptable limits.

16.12 Mineral Resource Classification 

The definitions given in the following section are taken from the 2000 Canadian Institute of 
Mining Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions' guidelines on Mineral Resources and 
Reserves, and comply with the requirements of National Instrument 43-101.

16.12.1 CIM Definitions 

Mineral Resource 

Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into 
Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower 
level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource. An Indicated 
Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than an Inferred Mineral Resource but 
has a lower level of confidence than a Measured Mineral Resource. 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized 
organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, 
grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated 
or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. 

The term Mineral Resource covers mineralisation and natural material of intrinsic economic 
interest which has been identified and estimated through exploration and sampling and 
within which Mineral Reserves may subsequently be defined by the consideration and 
application of technical, economic, legal, environmental, socio-economic and governmental 
factors. The phrase 'reasonable prospects for economic extraction' implies a judgement by 
the Qualified Person in respect of the technical and economic factors likely to influence the 
prospect of economic extraction. A Mineral Resource is an inventory of mineralisation that, 
under realistically assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, might become 
economically extractable. These assumptions must be presented explicitly in both public and 
technical reports. 

Inferred Mineral Resource 

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 
grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling 
and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is 
based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. 

Due to the uncertainty which may attach to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be 
assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an 
Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration. Confidence in 
the estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical and economic 
parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public disclosure. 
Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from estimates forming the basis of feasibility 
or other economic studies.

Indicated Mineral Resource 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 
grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level 
of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic 
parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the 
deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity 
to be reasonably assumed. 

Mineralisation may be classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person 
when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such as to allow confident 
interpretation of the geological framework and to reasonably assume the continuity of 
mineralisation. The Qualified Person must recognize the importance of the Indicated 
Mineral Resource category to the advancement of the feasibility of the project. An Indicated 
Mineral Resource estimate is of sufficient quality to support a Preliminary Feasibility Study 
which can serve as the basis for major development decisions. 

Measured Mineral Resource 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade 
or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling 
and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm 
both geological and grade continuity. 

Mineralisation or other natural material of economic interest may be classified as a 
Measured Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the nature, quality, quantity and 
distribution of data are such that the tonnage and grade of the mineralisation can be 
estimated to within close limits and that variation from the estimate would not significantly 
affect potential economic viability. This category requires a high level of confidence in, and 
understanding of, the geology and controls of the mineral deposit. 

16.12.2 Classification 

Introduction 

To classify the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits, the following key indicators were 
used: 

 geological complexity; 

 quality of data used in the estimation: 

o QAQC, density analysis 

 



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 105 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx   April 2011 

 results of the geostatistical analysis 

o variography, and 
o QKNA results; and 

 quality of the estimated block model. 

Geological Complexity 

Due to the large amount of drill data, it is possible to see clear geological continuity between 
sections and deduce a clear geological model for both the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget 
deposits with all of the mineralisation occurring within the serpentinite body. The drill 
spacing has allowed for the interpretation of a continuous zone of mafic material with a low 
associated Ni-AC grade. Internal waste pods have been interpreted that are harder to join 
from adjacent sections, but these are limited in number and form a small part of the overall 
serpentinite body.  

A statistical study of the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget data shows a very low variability in 
the grade distribution with near normal populations of data being present. A continuous low 
grade serpentinite unit has been identified from the statistical study that was subsequently 
domained as a separate unit. 

It is the opinion of SRK that the associated risk relating to geological complexity is low. 

Quality of the Data used in the Estimation 

Quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) checks were implemented throughout the 
assaying period that included the insertion of standards, blanks, laboratory duplicates and 
the use of an umpire laboratory. A full analysis of the QAQC can be found in Appendix 2 
but overall SRK is confident that the results of the QAQC analysis have validated the 
accuracy of the database being used to generate the Mineral Resource Estimate. 

A comprehensive dataset of density has also been generated by the Company throughout the 
sampling period that has enabled SRK to estimate density into the model using OK. SRK is 
therefore confident that the associated tonnages estimated for the Rönnbäcksnäset and 
Vinberget deposits should be reasonable. 

Results of the Geostatistical Analysis 

The data used in the geostatistical analysis resulted in robust variogram models being 
produced for both Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget. This enabled the nugget and short-scale 
variation in grade to be determined with a high level of confidence. The detailed 
variography allowed for the determination of appropriate search ellipse parameters to be 
determined through the application of multiple QKNA tests prior to the grade interpolation. 

Quality of the Estimated Block Model 

The validation tools show that the input data used to estimate the model is replicated in the 
estimation. Mean grades of the block model and composites are comparable for all modelled 
domains.

Classification Approach 

Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget have been classified as containing Measured, Indicated and 
Inferred Resources.  

Measured Resources have been limited to Vinberget due to the closer drill spacing that has 
resulted in well supported block estimates as highlighted by the following criteria: 

 very low geological complexity; 
 drillhole spacing of much less than the 2/3rd geostatistical range; 
 all blocks were estimated in search volume one, using the optimum search parameters 

determined; and 

 slope of regression values dominantly greater than 0.8. 

Indicated Resources have been given on the basis of all the information above, except with a 
slope of regression dominantly greater than 0.5. Indicated Resources at Rönnbäcksnäset 
have been extended approximately 100 m down dip of the last drillhole intersection on the 
section line. 

Inferred Resources at Rönnbäcksnäset have been calculated by extending the Indicated 
boundary 50 m down-dip and by including areas where internal waste pods are defined and 
unsupported by more than two drillholes on a section line. 

In all cases, the above have been used to model zones for the each of the classification 
categories for each deposit rather than to assign this on a block by block basis. 

Figure 93 shows the Rönnbäcksnäset block model coloured by classification and Figure 94 
shows the Vinberget block model coloured by classification.

16.13 Pit Optimisation 

To determine the final Mineral Resource Statement, and so as to comply with the CIM 
guidelines, the resulting blocks have been subjected to a Whittle pit optimisation exercise to 
determine the proportion of the material defined that has a reasonable prospect of economic 
extraction. This exercise is not intended to generate a Mineral Reserve and is purely used 
here to assist in determining the maximum likely extent of any open pit.  

The Whittle optimisation requires the input of reasonable processing and mining cost 
parameters in addition to appropriate pit slope angles and processing recoveries. Table 50 
shows the assumptions applied in the Whittle optimisation.  

The Whittle optimisation has assumed that the serpentinite domains (151 and 152) are to be 
treated as the key potential ore material types.

16.14 Mineral Resource Statement 

The Mineral Resource Statement generated by SRK has been restricted to all classified 
material falling within the Whittle shell representing a metal price of USD11/lb and through 
the application of the parameters outlined in Section 16.13. SRK assumed a nickel price of 
USD11.00/lb in a Whittle open pit optimisation exercise to limit the material reported to that 
which SRK considers has reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction and applied 
a cut off grade of 0.031% Ni-AC representing the calculated marginal cut off grade for the 
deposits. The USD11.00/lb nickel price includes a 30% premium above the consensus long-
term nickel price, determined from over 30 market forecasts. 

Table 51 shows the resulting Mineral Resource Statement for Ni and Co, for 
Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget. Due to the large relative proportion of non-sulphide nickel 
in the Ronnbacken ores, resources are reported in terms of sulphide (AC) nickel along with 
the more conventional total nickel. A high proportion of the sulphide nickel is recovered in 
the flotation process whereas the non-sulphide nickel reports predominantly to tailings. 

Table 52 presents the iron resource. This has been classified as Inferred to reflect the current 
preliminary status of the mineralogical work. Specifically, in SRK's opinion, more 
information is required to be collected to enable the proportion of the total Fe that has 
potential to be recoverable in a concentrate to be determined to the level of confidence 
required by a higher category. The magnetite iron content of the feed has been estimated 
using available Satmagan analyses of a number of samples from Vinberget and Sundsberget 
where the measured magnetic susceptibilities is greater than 50% of the maximum value 
measured and by applying 72.4% iron content of magnetite. In the context of the limited

available data, the conversion factor used for total Fe grade to contained magnetite at 
Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset is 67%. 

The effective date for these statements is 25 February 2011. 

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic 
viability. Notwithstanding this, neither SRK nor the Company are aware of any factors 
(environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or 
other relevant factors) that could materially affect the potential of these to be exploited.

93.2 Mt with mean grades of 0.103% Ni-AC and 0.003% Co-AC. All Fe mineralisation, 
with a mean grade of 5.44% has been classified as Inferred to reflect the current preliminary 
status of the metallurgical testwork on the magnetite concentrate potential.

The Mineral Resource Statement above includes material domained as mafic material 
(domain 205) at Rönnbäcksnäset. This material, equating to 12 Mt or 3% of the total 
resource and with a mean grade of 0.052% Ni-AC has been included due to the presence 
within this of potentially recoverable Ni above the calculated marginal cut off grade. At 
present, it is the understanding of SRK that the metallurgical testwork does not include the 
mafic material type but SRK considers the inclusion of this material in the Mineral Resource 
Statement to be justified and that it represents potential upside to the project.

16.15 Grade Tonnage Curves 

Grade-tonnage curves for Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget are shown in Figure 97 and Figure 

98 for Ni-AC%. The curve shows the relationship between the modelled tonnage and grade 

at increasing Ni-AC% cut-offs.  

The Rönnbäcksnäset grade-tonnage curve shows a gentle decreasing tonnage with an 
associated gentle increasing Ni-AC% grade up to a Ni-AC cut off of approximately 0.09%. 
This low grade material relates to the low grade serpentinite unit at Rönnbäcksnäset 
northeast. Above a cut off of 0.09% Ni-AC, the tonnage drops from approximately 225 Mt 
with an associated sharp increase in Ni-AC%. 

The Vinberget grade-tonnage curve shows that all material is above the marginal cut off 
grade of 0.031% Ni-AC with a steadily dropping tonnage and increasing Ni-AC% from 
approximately 0.1% Ni-AC cut off.

16.16 Exploration Potential 

There are several million tonnes of additional mineralised material within the Whittle pit 
shell at Rönnbäcksnäset that has not been included in SRK's Mineral Resource Statement as 
it occurs in areas where more drilling is required to support sufficiently reliable estimates of 
tonnage and grade. This material, however, has a good chance of being potentially economic 
and adding to the mineral resource presented here following further drilling. 

The Company is currently undertaking drilling at Rönnbäcksnäset to target down dip 
extensions to the mineralisation that was identified as potentially economic through an 
optimisation exercise which includes the above material. SRK considers this work justified 
by the potential and that further such optimisation exercises will justify more drilling 
programmes which may add to the Mineral Resource even further in due course. 

16.17 Comparisons with SRK's 2010 SRK Mineral Resource Estimate 

The differences between the current Mineral Resource Statement given above and that 
produced in April 2010 are principally a result of an increase in the metal price (from 
USD9/lb to USD11/lb) and minor adjustments to other technical parameters used in the pit 
optimisation process. 

The Whittle parameters applied to the April 2010 Mineral Resource Estimation are shown in 
Table 53, while the April 2010 Mineral Resource Statement itself is shown in Table 54. 

The changes in optimisation parameters results in an increase of 29.6 Mt of ore and a 
marginal drop in Ni-AC grade from 0.108% to 0.104%.  This drop in grade is a direct result 
of the drop in calculated marginal cut off grade from 0.048% to 0.031% and the inclusion of 
lower grade material.

16.18 MRG Sundsberget Summary 

16.18.1 Introduction 

The following section describes the work undertaken by MRG in generating its Mineral 
Resource Statement for Sundsberget. SRK has reviewed the raw data used in the geological 
modelling, and the techniques applied in the Mineral Resource estimation process, and has 
not found any significant errors or concerns. The quality of the work undertaken by MRG is 
considered by SRK to be appropriate and that the results obtained to be representative of the 
data available. Notwithstanding this, SRK considers the Inferred classification category 
reported by MRG for Sundsberget to be conservative in view of the supporting data. SRK 
note however that this classification does not impact on the current level of study.  

16.18.2 Statistical Analysis and Geological Domaining 

MRG digitised a single mineralisation wireframe using Gemcom software. Sundsberget 

measures 1,200m along strike, on an azimuth of 10⁰, and 500 to 600m across strike at the 

widest point. It was modeled to a maximum down dip depth of approximately 500m from 
surface, with a dip of 40° to the west. A near normal population of data exists for Ni-AC 
within the mineralized serpentinite, this being similar to the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget 
deposits. Subtle grade breaks are observed in the data population at 0.05% Ni-AC and 0.1% 
Ni-AC. The lower boundary has been used to define the serpentinite body into two domains 
in addition to the generation of a barren pyroxenite unit within the main serpentinite body. A 
cross sectional interpretation of the key geological domains is shown in Figure 100.  

Table 55 shows the summary statistics for the various domains identified by MRG. As 
shown, the mean grade of the mineralized serpentinite and the associated CoV are similar to 
those derived for Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget with a mean grade of 0.099% Ni-AC.

Table 56 shows the 2m composite statistics for Sundsberget. Due to the majority of the 
samples being 2m in length, the compositing process has a minimal impact on the grade 
variance with only a small drop in the CoV from the raw to composite statistics.

16.18.3 Geostatistical Study 

MRG undertook a geostatistical study in line with that undertaken by SRK. MRG modelled 
an omni directional variogram for Ni-AC using a lag spacing of 2m to enable the nugget to 
be fixed and modelled directional variograms in the strike (0°) and dip directions (35° dip at 
270° azimuth) using a 100m lag spacing. No plunge to the mineralisation was identified. 

The variography showed a down-dip and along strike range to the Ni mineralisation of 350m 
with a relative nugget of 25.6%. The results of the geostatistical study are similar to those 
obtained for the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits and enabled MRG to justifiably use 
OK as the interpolation method. 

MRG also estimated Fe using the variogram parameters determined for Ni-AC. 

16.18.4 Mineral Resource Estimation 

MRG created a block model with block dimensions approximating half of the drillhole 
spacing in the X and Y directions, equating to block sizes of 50m by 100m. A 10m block 
height was chosen being the assumed working bench height of the operating pit. Grades of 
Ni-AC, Co-AC and Ni-Total were interpolated using OK. MRG used a primary search 
ellipse of 250m along strike by 250m down dip by 83m across strike, this being less than the 
geostatistical range and ensuring that sample pairs with a strong covariance are used in the 
interpolation. A minimum of 12 samples and a maximum of 36 samples was used in the 
interpolation and it was ensured that more than one hole was used in each block estimate by 
restricting the maximum number of samples from a single borehole to eight. SRK considers 
this technique to be appropriate. MRG used an expanding search ellipse to estimate blocks 
that remained un-estimated after the primary interpolation.

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx   April 2011 

16.18.5 Block Model Validation 

MRG compared the original composite and resulting block model mean grades and found 
these to compare well. This is backed up by a visual validation of the samples and block 
data and through the generation of sectional validation licences. SRK ran its own checks on 
the input and output data and agrees with MRG's findings.  It is also worth noting that 93% 
of the blocks were estimated using the primary search criteria. 

16.18.6 Classification 

With the exception of the results of a QKNA study, MRG utilised the same classification 
criteria to that of SRK and as discussed in previous sections of this report. In summary, 
MRG found that the Sundsberget deposit showed clear geological continuity with all of the 
mineralisation occurring within the serpentinite body. Internal waste zones were identified 
but in the opinion of MRG require additional drilling confirm their orientations and nature. 
MRG concluded that through a statistical study, Sundsberget shows a very low variability in 
its grade distribution and that a continuous low grade domain was identified and modelled as 
a separate domain from the main mineralised serpentinite. MRG concluded that the results 
of the QA/QC validated the accuracy of the database and that the geostatistical study 
resulted in reasonable variogram models with the nugget and short scale variation in grade 
being determined with a comfortable level of confidence.  

Validation undertaken by MRG showed that the input data used to estimate the model 
corresponds with the output block model grades. Notwithstanding this, however, MRG 
reported only an Inferred Mineral Resource due to the uncertainty associated with the 
geometry and continuity of the pyroxenite and barren serpentine zones. 

Similar in approach to SRK, and to determine the material with reasonable prospects for 
eventual economic extraction, MRG then subjected the Sundsberget model to a Whittle pit 
optimisation analysis using the assumptions highlighted in Table 58.

16.18.7 MRG Mineral Resource Statement 

Table 59 shows the Mineral Resource Statement generated by MRG for the Sundsberget 
deposit. This has been restricted to all classified material falling within the Whittle shell 
representing a nickel price of USD9/lb and through the application of the parameters 
outlined in Section 16.18.6 and through selecting a mining throughput of 10 Mtpa. MRG 
assumed a nickel price of USD9.00/lb in a Whittle open pit optimisation exercise to limit the 
material reported to that which it considered had reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction and applied a cut-off grade of 0.05% Ni-AC representing the calculated marginal 
cut-off grade for the deposits. The Mineral Resource Statement generated by MRG has an 
effective date of 27 October 2010. 

The magnetite iron content of the feed has been estimated using available Satmagan 
analyses of a number of samples from Vinberget and Sundsberget where the measured 
magnetic susceptibilities is greater than 50% of the maximum value measured and by 
applying 72.4% iron content of magnetite. In the context of the limited available data, the 
conversion factor used by SRK for total Fe grade to contained magnetite at Sundsberget is 
64%.

16.18.8 SRK Summary 

SRK has undertaken a review of the raw data used and the techniques applied by MRG in 
generating its Mineral Resource estimate. In SRK's opinion the quality of the work 
undertaken was appropriate and the overall process similar in style and content to that 
undertaken by SRK on the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits. The geology and style 
of mineralisation exhibited at Sundsberget is similar to that at Rönnbäcksnäset and 
Vinberget, being of low geological complexity with a drill spacing that has enabled robust 
statistical and geostatistical studies to be undertaken that has resulted in a reliable Mineral 
Resource estimate. The Company has generated good quality data that is suitable for use in 
the interpolation and that is validated through the QA/QC tests employed.  

MRG reported the Mineral Resource entirely as Inferred, rather than Measured or Indicated  
due to the uncertainty regarding the geometry of the internal barren pyroxenite zones. SRK 
has reviewed these internal zones and believes that the interpretation undertaken by MRG 
has enabled a reasonable and continuous three dimensional solid to be created. The internal 
zones modelled by MRG represent approximately 12% of the total tonnage within the 
optimised Whittle pit shell and SRK feels that the clear geological continuity of the 
mineralised Serpentinite unit and the quality of the data could support an Indicated 
classification. 

Notwithstanding these comments, SRK has not re-classified the Sundsberget deposit for the 
purposes of this study but has included these mineral resources in its technical and economic 
analyses presented in the following sections and does recommend that this aspect be 
reviewed and re-considered when these estimates are next updated. In summary, SRK 
considers MRG's estimates of tonnage and grade to be reliable but that its classification is 
conservative. 

16.19 Combined SRK-MRG Mineral Resource Statement 

Table 60 and Table 61 below present the Mineral Resource Statements for the Project as a 
whole, combining the SRK statement for Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget, and the Mitchell 
River Group Statement for Sundsberget, which SRK has audited. 

Table 61 presents the iron resource. This has been classified as Inferred to reflect the current 
preliminary status of the mineralogical work. Specifically, in SRK's opinion, more 
information is required to be collected to enable the proportion of the total Fe that has 
potential to be recoverable in a concentrate to be determined to the level of confidence 
required by a higher category.

17 OTHER RELEVANT DATA & INFORMATION 

Introduction 

The Company currently envisages that the Rönnbäcknäset, Vinberget and Sundsberget 
deposits will all be exploited using open pit mining techniques.  It is intended to use 
conventional mining methods including drilling, blasting, loading with hydraulic shovels 
and hauling with off highway dump trucks. 

During the course of this study, SRK has completed a number of mining engineering 
activities including: 

 the development of Whittle input models for all three deposits; 

 the optimisation of the three deposits using updated costs and processing parameters; 

 the generation of bench tonnages and grades for scheduling purposes; and 

 a review of the resulting mining schedules. 

17.1 Mine Optimisation, Design and Scheduling 

17.1.1 Optimisation Parameters 

Block Models 

The geological block models used for the Rönnbäcknäset and Vinberget optimisations are 
those developed by SRK in April 2010 while that used for the Sundsberget deposit is the 
one produced by MRG in October 2010 and validated by SRK in 2011. 

These models have been modified to include generic waste and air blocks and the required 
optimisation fields have been added to each.  This work was completed in Datamine before 
Whittle MOD and PAR files were exported, ready for the optimisation process. 

The models are all on different frameworks and as there is a reasonable geographic distance 
between the deposits, it was therefore decided to treat each deposit as a separate entity for 
the purposes of the optimisation.  Although it is unlikely to make a significant difference, 
combining these three models in a multi-mine scenario in due course would add a further 
level of completeness to the study. 

The table below shows the general statistics for the three Whittle models used.  There is a 
discrepancy in the cobalt grades for the Sundsberget model in that they are not reported in 
the same units as those for the other models.  However, cobalt has not been considered in 
the optimisation process, therefore this discrepancy does not need to be considered. The 
Sundsberget grid is also different to that used for the other deposits, but again this is not an 
issue for this study.

Geotechnical Parameters 

Geotechnical parameters have been derived by SRK and differ for each pit.  There are also 
no footwall/hangingwall variations.  The overall slope angles which have been used are: 

Rönnbäcksnäset: 48⁰ 

Vinberget:  50⁰ 

Sundsberget:  49⁰ 

                                                      
1 The Nickel grades are expressed in percent and represent the nickel in the sulphide phase only.  Nickel content is therefore 
in the same units as the nickel bearing rock, in this case tonnes. 
2 The cobalt grades for the Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget deposits are expressed in percent, in the same fashion as the 
nickel grades.  The cobalt grades in the Sundsberget model are expressed in parts per million.

Mining Parameters 

The following mining parameters have been used in the optimisation process. 

Base Mining Cost (at Reference Block - RFBK): USD1.35/t mined 
Incremental mining cost above RFBK:   USD0.05/t/10 m 
Incremental mining cost below RFBK:   USD0.07/t/10 m 
Mining Recovery:     95% 
Mining Dilution:     2.5% 
 
SRK was provided with an expected range of mining costs for the operation of between 
USD1.72/t and USD1.96/t.  This range was based on the assumption that a contract mining 
fleet would be utilised and matches SRK's expectation based on experience with similar 
operations in the region.     

Given the proximity of the deposits, and the fact that the same mining method will be used 
for all three, it was considered appropriate to use the same base mining cost for all three 
deposits.   

Processing Parameters 

Although other elements are present in the geological models, only nickel has been 
considered in the optimisations.  Cobalt and the other elements should be considered in 
future optimisation work if more metallurgical information becomes available. 

The following processing parameters have been used for the optimisation process. 

Ni Processing Recovery:    80% 
Processing Cost:     USD4.96/t processed 
Transport Cost:     USD0.10/t processed 
General & Administration Cost:   USD0.40/t processed 
Concentrate Grade:     25% 

Economic Parameters 

The following economic parameters have been used in the optimisation process. 

Nickel Price:     USD9/lb 
Discount Rate:    0% 
Government Royalty:    0.05% 
Private Royalty:    0.15% 
Smelter Cost:     USD1.14/lb 
Smelter Recovery    100%

Optimisation Constraints 

No geographic restrictions have been placed on any of the optimisations.  The Sundsberget 
deposit runs under Lake Gardiken in the south and it has been assumed that a pit wall dam 
will be constructed in this area to allow mining of this material.  Although not included in 
this optimisation process, the cost of construction of the pit wall dam has been included in 
the TEM.   

17.1.2 Optimisation Results 

Introduction 

For each deposit, two sets of optimisations were conducted, each with a different nickel 
price.  Both were then transferred into Datamine for the generation of bench tonnages and 
grades for scheduling. 

Whittle results 

Given the preliminary nature of the study, no subjective selection of Whittle shells has been 
undertaken.  The shells chosen for further analysis are the ones that returned the highest pit 
value; naturally, this occurs where the Revenue Factor (RF) = 1.  Future optimisation should 
consider other shells along the various optimisation curves, and take into consideration 
incremental stripping ratios and mining costs. 

The Whittle results for the three depositsare shown below in Figure 101 to Figure 103 and 
the shells chosen for each deposit are: 

Rönnbäcksnäset: Shell 32 RF=1 

Vinberget:  Shell 33 RF=1 

Sundsberget:  Shell 27 RF=1.22 

The optimum shell for Sundsberget is shell 27 which has a RF of 1.22.  The reason this shell 
is optimal is because all of the RF from 0.96 to 1.22 produce the same shell.  In other words, 
the shell at RF=1 is the same shell as that produced at RF=1.22.

17.1.3 Pit Tonnages and Grades 

Cut-off Grade Calculation 

SRK generated pit tonnages and grades for scheduling purposes for each of the three 
deposits.  It has been assumed that the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit will be mined in two phases 
with the deposit divided along the north-south line at easting 1,481,000.  The other two 
deposits (Vinberget and Sundsberget) have been scheduled as though they are mined in a 
single stage, that is, without cutbacks. 

Two cut-off grades are relevant to most open pit operations.  These are the breakeven cut-off 
grade and the incremental (or marginal) cut-off grade.  The breakeven cut-off grade takes 
into account all mining and processing costs and represents the minimum grade of material 
that should be mined in order to pay for all mining and processing activities, including the 
mining of waste material to access the material in question.  The material which is above 
this grade is referred to as ore, or sometimes high grade ore. 

The incremental cut-off grade represents the minimum grade of material that should be 
mined in order to pay for processing costs only.  This assumes that the material has been 
mined as waste in order to reach higher grade material below it.  The material is now at 
surface and as the higher grade material has paid for the mining costs, the eventual 
processing / stockpiling strategy can be reassessed.  If the grade is higher than the 
incremental cut-off grade then it is economic to process.  Typically, it would be stockpiled 
and treated in periods where there is insufficient higher grade material being mined, or at the 
end of the mine life when all of the higher grade material has been depleted.  The material 
with a grade above the incremental cut-off grade but below the breakeven cut-off grade is 
generally referred to as low grade or marginal material.  



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 127 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx   April 2011 

Cut-off grades were calculated for each of the deposits, based on the whittle results and 
input parameters.  Table 63 below shows the calculated cut-off grades for each of the 
deposits. 

Table 63: Cut-off grades for each deposit 

 Rönnbäcksnäset Vinberget Sundsberget 

Breakeven Cut-off Grade 
(Ni-AC %) 

0.0651% 0.0578% 0.0607% 

Incremental Cut-off Grade 
(Ni-AC %) 

0.0395% 0.0395% 0.0395% 

 

The incremental cut-off grades are the same for all three deposits.  This is expected as all 
deposits are using the same processing plant, concentrate transport system and smelter.  In 
reality, this cut-off grade would be slightly different for each deposit, once transport costs 
for ore to the processing plant are taken into account, however the applied level of detail is 
deemed sufficient for the purposes of this study. 

Tonnage and Grade Reporting 

The selected Whittle shells were imported into Datamine and the tonnages and grade of 
material above the respective cut-offs were derived. Table 64 below shows these results for 
each pit.  Vinberget and Sundsberget do not have any low grade material within the pit 
shells.   

Table 64: Scheduled Tonnages and Grades 

 Rönnbäcksnäset Vinberget Sundsberget 

Ore Tonnes 268.9 mt 57.1 mt 178.9 mt 

Ore Ni Grade 0.1063% 0.133% 0.104%

Total Tonnes 515.5 mt 80.3 mt 274.5 mt 

Total Volume3  187.8 m BCM 29.5 m BCM 96.2 m BCM 

 

The total Rönnbäcken project contains 504.9 Mt of material at a mean grade of 0.109% Ni-
AC and 0.0035% Co above the breakeven cut-off and within the optimum pit shells.  In 
addition, there are 28.7 Mt of marginal material and 336.7 Mt of waste.   

The above tonnages have been further split into bench tonnages and grades, with 
Rönnbäcksnäset also being divided into two phases (as discussed above) and provided to 
Rolf Ritzén of Ritzén Consult for scheduling purposes.

17.1.4 Mining Schedule 

The mining schedules were developed by Ritzén Consult and have been reviewed by SRK. 
The final schedule received was entitled Project Rönnbäcken Production Schedule March 
2011.xlsx. 

While there is a slight discrepancy between the total material mined in the schedule and that 
reported in the bench tonnages provided by SRK, the difference is less than 1% and not 
material.  The mining schedule has considered low grade material in the Rönnbäcksnäset pit 
as ore.  Consideration should be given to the adoption of suitable cut-off grade and 
stockpiling strategies in the future. 

 

 Figure 104: Total Material Mined 

 
Figure 104 shows mining commencing in Year 0 with 7.1 Mt of pre-stripping occurring at 
Rönnbäcksnäset and a further 500,000 t of pre-stripping at Vinberget. Some 2.7 Mt are also 
scheduled to be stripped from Sundsberget in 2011, although mining of this deposit then 
ceases until Year 5.  SRK understands that the Company intends to use this material for road 
and pad construction. 

Ore production commences in Year 1 at both Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget and full ore 
production is achieved in Year 2.  Marginal material from Rönnbäcksnäset has been 
stockpiled during the first six years of operation.  This allows the higher grade material from 
Vinberget to be preferentially treated, increasing the feed grade in the early years and 
increasing the NPV of the project.  Although additional costs will be incurred at the end of 
the project due to the re-handling of the marginal material, this is offset by the increased 
grade during the early years.

Figure 105: Total Material Mined by Pit 

 
The Sundsberget deposit is recommenced in Year 5 and is in full production by the time the 
Vinberget deposit is depleted.  This is a reasonable strategy and ensures consistent supply of 
ore to the processing plant. 

The maximum mining rate is achieved in Year 2 and is sustained at similar levels until Year 
8.  The ramp up period is aggressive, but should be obtainable assuming: 

 the contractor is established and has personnel and equipment that can be moved from 
another operation. 

 site infrastructure can be constructed in time to meet utilisation demand. 

 access roads, particularly to Vinberget, can be established in time. 

The second part of the schedule sees a drop in material moved from Year 9 to Year 12, but a 
substantial increase over the following three years.  This difference will need to be 
addressed and removed in future work, either through the use of additional cutbacks in 
Rönnbäcksnäset and Sundsberget, or by refinement of the use of contract mining equipment 
as it is unlikely that contractors would be willing to commit additional resources to the 
project for such a short period of time.  Despite this, the schedule is in SRK's opinion 
reasonable and achievable. 

Ore supply is fixed at 30 Mtpa from Year 2 onwards (Figure 106).  Stockpiles have been 
used to improve the feed grade in the first several years of operation by deferring the 
processing of low grade material until the end of the mine life.  This approach allows high 
grade ore to be preferentially fed and is a sound mining practice.

17.1.5 Mining Equipment Selection 

Rolf Ritzen of Ritzen Consult has prepared a mining equipment list on behalf of the 
Company. The base assumption for the TEM is that a contract workforce will be used for 
the mining operations.  This would seem to be a logical choice given the large number of 
mining contractors and experience in contract mining in Sweden.  However, given the 
relatively long mine life, and the large volume of material to be mined, SRK has 
recommended to the Company that consideration also be given to converting to an owner-
mining operation as the feasibility studies are progressed. 

Another possibility would be to grant a 5 year + 1 year mining contract.  This will allow the 
contractor a reasonable amount of time to recoup any initial capital outlay and will also 
allow the client to consider options for owner mining. 

Initial studies suggest that the loading units will be 700 t hydraulic shovels with 34 m3 
buckets.  These would be matched with 225 t haul trucks.  These are a reasonable 
combination for the volume of material scheduled in each period. 

Allowances have been made for auxiliary equipment including wheel loaders, track dozers, 
graders water trucks and cranes.  At this stage, no indication of specific numbers of these 
machines has been provided, however, given the assumption of a mining contractor, this is 
not critical at this stage of the study. 

 

 



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 131 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx   April 2011 

SRK has noted some minor absences in the mining equipment list, particularly lighting 
plants.  While mining equipment is equipped with onboard lighting, this is not sufficient, 
particularly in a country where the winter months are accompanied by long periods of 
darkness.  Adequate lighting is required for safe operation, particularly on waste dumps and 
ore stockpiles.  Improved lighting conditions also aid in the minimisation of mining dilution 
by better allowing the identification of ore/waste contacts or marker tape. 

In general, however, the proposed size and type of mining equipment would appear to be 
adequate for this style of operation and as such, no adjustments to the assumptions proposed 
by the Company have been made in the TEM. 

17.1.6 Mine Workforce 

A manning schedule has been provided and has been incorporated into the TEM.  This 
workforce schedule relies on the assumption of contract mining, which SRK considers to be 
reasonable. 

17.1.7 Operating Costs 

Table 65shows the unit costs which were provided to SRK for the various mining activities.  
These costs have been derived from first principles by Ritzen Consult, who has compared 
these with other operations in Sweden.  Although SRK considers these operating costs to be 
low, they are within the expected range and well within the tolerances of the study 
parameters. 

Table 65: Unit operating costs for the mining operation 

 Unit Cost / t (SEK) Unit Cost / t (USD) 

Drilling 1.19 0.149 

Blasting 1.98 0.248 

Loading 1.01 0.126 

Hauling 2.55 0.32 

Personnel 2.53 0.32 

Auxiliary Equipment 0.99 0.124 

Mine Services 0.90 0.11 

Administration 0.28 0.035 

Maintenance 0.52 0.065 

Contractor Margin (15%) 1.79 0.224 

Total 13.74 1.72 

 

17.1.8 Capital Requirements 

Assuming that mining will be undertaken by a contractor, much of the capital for the mining 
operation is removed.  However, there are still a number of items of mining infrastructure 
which will need to be provided by the owner, including: 

 office facilities; 

 warehouse facilities (possibly included in processing if mining contractor provides 
their own warehousing for mobile equipment components); 



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 132 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx   April 2011 

 workshop facility (possibly supplied by mining contractor – although the contract 
rates would be increased); 

 communications facilities*; 

 lunch/change out facilities; 

 explosives magazines*; 

 water storage facilities; 

 fuel and lube storage facilities (should the contractor supply their own fuel and lube 
facility, the client will still require a small fuel store for light vehicles and other client 
owned ancillary equipment)*; 

 emergency response centre/equipment*; 

 first aid post*; and 

 power and water supply. 

Those aspects marked with an asterisk (*) do not appear to have been considered by the 
Company in developing mining capital costs assumptions. Whilst SRK recognises that 
provision for these items should be included, the cost of these is not considered material and 
no adjustment to the TEM has been made for the purposes of this study. Notwithstanding 
this, SRK recommends that these costs are included in the next phase of study. 

17.1.9 Other Considerations 

The Sundsberget deposit partially underlies Lake Gardiken at its southern end.  In order to 
extract this material, it will be necessary to construct a dyke or retaining wall around the 
edge of the pit prior to excavation.  While technically feasible given the shallow depth of the 
lake in this area, this exercise will need to be carefully planned, scheduled and budgeted for 
in future assessments of the project. 

17.1.10 Conclusion 

From a technical perspective the Rönnbäcken project appears to be feasible and achievable, 
in the context of the information available and the level of study.  The project is proposed to 
be a standard contract operated truck/shovel operation.  Given the developed mining culture 
and industry in Sweden and the nature and size of the deposit, from a technical mining 
perspective, SRK does not foresee any major issues that would prevent the operation from 
commencing.   

17.1.11 Recommendations 

Based on the results of this study, SRK has recommended to the Company that the 
following aspects of the operation be studied further as the Project is further assessed: 

 A conventional truck/shovel mining operation has been proposed for the operation.  
Other mining methods may be applicable for the operation and a review of these 
should be completed.   

 The three deposits have been optimised using separate stand-alone models.  This was 
done because of the close proximity of the deposits.  Although it is unlikely to make a 



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 133 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx   April 2011 

significant difference in the overall result, reoptimising these deposits using a multi-
mine configuration would add an additional level of completeness to the project. 

 Although present in the geological models, cobalt and other elements have not been 
included in the optimisation process.  These elements should be included in future 
optimisations as additional metallurgical test work is completed.   

 Separate ore transport costs have not been considered for each pit during the 
optimisation process.  This should be examined and included in future optimisations 
to reflect the different ore haulage distances.  The most economical method to haul 
ore from Vinberget should also be considered.  This may include smaller haul trucks 
or even road trucks hauling from a stockpile at the pit edge. 

 A reduction in waste stripping occurs in Years 10 to 14 of the schedule, but then the 
stripping increases dramatically over the following three years.  If possible, the use of 
cutbacks should be examined in more detail to try to remove this inconsistency, and 
bring waste stripping forward, in order to balance out the mining fleet. 

 Contract mining has been assumed for the operation.  While this is common practice 
in Sweden, given the life and size of the operation, consideration should be given to 
implementing an owner mining operation after an initial term of contract mining.  
Allowances for contract management and client technical services personnel also 
need to be made in the proposed manning numbers. 

 Although some ancillary equipment has been included, there are some absences.  
These will need to be included in future work. 

 Consideration needs to be given to the source, production and amount of sheeting 
material which will be required for road maintenance, given the length of proposed 
roads on the site, and the climate of the region. 

17.2 Geotechnical Design Criteria 

17.2.1 Slope Angle Estimation 

For this preliminary economic assessment, indicative overall slope angles on a lithology 
basis were estimated using rock mass classification ratings derived from photologging of 
selected borehole core carried out by Gary Dempers of Dempers and Seymour Pty Ltd 
(D&S) and reviewed by SRK. 

A total of 35 boreholes (7,649 m) were logged to provide input to produce Laubscher 
Mining Rock Mass Ratings (MRMR) for the three deposits; 14 for Rönnbäcken (North and 
South; 2,603 m), 9 for Sundsberget (2,743 m) and 12 for Vinberget (2,303 m).  The MRMR 
classification system used the fracture frequency, intact rock strength and the joint condition 
to calculate values for each interval.  The calculated MRMR values are adjusted to account 
for the potential effects of mining and exposure. MRMR adjustments were applied as 
follows: 

Weathering – 1.0 
Stress – 1.0 
Orientation – 0.9 
Blasting – 0.95 



SRK Consulting

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx   April 2011 

The unadjusted and adjusted MRMR value for each lithology at each deposit was calculated 
using mean, lower and upper quartile values for fracture frequency, intact rock strength and 
joint condition.  The Haines-Terbrugge empirical slope design chart, which related adjusted 
MRMR to slope angle and slope height for specified factors of safety, was used to estimate 
to estimate slope angles.  A maximum vertical slope height per lithology of 160 m and a 
nominal factor of safety of 1.2 was used.  

The results of this evaluation are presented in Table 66 for the mean and lower quartile 
values only. Given the preliminary nature of the study and the method by which the slope 
angles have been estimated, SRK considers it inappropriate to consider the use of slope 
angles derived from the upper quartile of the data set. The minor lithologies, such as the 
conglomerate, are not shown as they do not make up a significant proportion of the slope.  
SRK has reviewed the methodology used to estimate slope angles and considers this to be to 
internationally accepted standards and appropriate for a preliminary economic assessment.

17.2.2 Recommended Slope Angles for Pit Optimisation 

In order to use these individual lithology slope angles to develop an overall slope angle for 
pit optimisation, SRK overlaid Whittle shell profiles on geology sections and constructed pit 
slopes from the floor of the Whittle shell to the crest using the individual lithology slope 
angles. This is illustrated in Figure 107 for a cross section through the Rönnbäcken deposit. 
The results for all cross sections analysed in this way are presented in Table 67.

SRK notes that for Rönnbäcken and Sundsberget the footwall dip is relatively shallow and 
the pit walls follow the dip of the orebody. The dip of the Vinberget deposit is steeper and 
consequently the angle of the footwall slope is also steeper. Using the data gathered from the 
individual section analysis there appears to be little difference to overall slope angle whether 
using minimum or average slope angles.  However, the influence of groundwater and the 
close proximity of Lake Gardiken remains to be evaluated with regard to stability of the pit 
walls. As such, SRK has chosen to use the lower bound slope angles for the PEA. The 
recommended maximum overall footwall and hangingwall slope angles for pit optimisation 
are: 

Rönnbäcken – 48° 
Vinberget – 50° 
Sundsberget – 49° 

Furthermore detailed geotechnical investigations comprising the drilling of specific 
orientated geotechnical boreholes together with field and laboratory rock testing and 
detailed structural and hydrogeological interpretation will be required to advance the project 
to the next phase. This will allow slope angles to be optimised and bench/berm 
configurations to be designed, taking into consideration the interaction of rock structure and 
groundwater with the pit slopes.

17.3 Waste Rock Management 

The preliminary waste rock dump design and location has been carried out on behalf of the 
Company by Ritzen Consult. The details of the waste rock dumps (WRD) are limited in the 
documents reviewed by SRK. The Company has indicated that the WRD will have an 

average height of 50 to 70 m and a slope angle of 1:5⁰. The proposed locations of the WRD 
in proximity of the each of the proposed pits is considered by SRK to be reasonable. 

The acidic rock drainage (ARD) potenetial from the waste rock dumps is discussed in 
Section 17.6 below. 

17.4 Metallurgical Testwork and Plant Design 

17.4.1 Metallurgical Testwork 

Historical Testwork 

Previously published reviews of the historical metallurgical testwork conducted on various 
samples from the Rönnbäcken area have indicated that nickel can be recovered into 
commercially acceptable sulphide concentrates at nickel recoveries between 67 and 73% 
and at concentrate grades of 26 to 34% Ni. Typically, a primary grind of P80 44 μm was 
required. 

Initial bench scale studies were performed in the early 1970s by the Royal Institute of 
Technology in Stockholm.  Standard flotation tests were performed on three different 
samples from the Rönnbäcken area and the nickel concentrates produced contained 31% Ni 
to 47% Ni, 1.5% Co to 2.8% Co, 4 g/t Au to 8 g/t Au, and some minor platinum group 
metals (PGM) at recoveries reported to be 80% of the sulphide nickel. 

In 1974, Boliden carried out test mining in the Rönnbäcken area and conducted pilot 
flotation testing.  Nickel concentrates containing 26% Ni to 34% Ni, 1.5% Co, 5 g/t Au, and 
2 g/t combined PGM at a recovery of 67% to 73% were produced.  In addition, grinding was 
tested using both a rod mill – pebble mill and autogenous (AG) mill – pebble mill circuits.  
The best metallurgical results were obtained using AG – pebble mill circuit with a P80 of 44 
μm.  The total energy consumption using two-stage fully AG grinding was reported to be 
approximately 25 kWh/t. 

The suitability of autogenous grinding was confirmed by industrial scale testing at a Boliden 
concentrator and demonstrated that Vinberget ore media were very competent, comparing 
favourably with ore from the Aitik copper mine which utilises the large diameter AG mill – 
pebble mill grinding circuit. 

The gold grades in the concentrate from initial testwork were assumed to be the result of 
contamination and not representative of gold in concentrate from the Project. 

Minpro Tests 2007 

In 2007, standard bench scale flotation tests were performed at Minpro AB (Minpro) 
laboratories on a sample taken used in the earlier Boliden investigations.  Despite the earlier 
work, two coarser primary grind sizes, P80 80 and 60 μm were investigated. 



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 138 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx   April 2011 

Minpro reported total nickel (NiT) rather than only sulphide nickel (NiS) in its report.  Even 
at the low head grade of 0.10% NiS , concentrate grades as high as 25% Ni were achieved.  
The best tests resulted in a recovery of sulphide nickel to the rougher concentrate of 90%. 
After two stages of cleaning in an open circuit test, a concentrate grading 18% Ni was 
produced at approximately 77% recovery (estimated due to assays reported as NiT). 

Outotec Research Centre (ORC) Tests – ORC Phase 1 Testing 2008 

In 2008, five 25 kg samples from the drilling campaign were sent by the Company to the 
Outotec Research Centre (ORC) in Finland. The samples were collected from two drillholes 
at Vinberget (VIN29 and VIN30) and one drillhole at Rönnbäcksnäset (RON53).  The 
samples provided were half core that had been crushed to -2 mm. In addition, a reference 
sample was provided from the Boliden test pit near Vinberget which had previously been 
used in the Minpro tests. 

The range of nickel analyses of the five samples was 0.104% to 0.153% NiS and 0.182% to 
0.202% NiT, using bromine methanol (BM) assay methods for determination of sulphide 
nickel and four acid digestion for total nickel.  The samples were also assayed for NiS 
content by AC method at Labtium, Finland, and by for NiT content by both four acid 
digestion at ALS, Vancouver, and aqua regia digestion at Labtium, Finland,.  The assay 
methods compared reasonably well.  The comparative results are presented in Table 68. 

Table 68: Assay Method Comparison 

 

 
During this phase of testing, ORC conducted a total of 14 standard rougher flotation tests 
using primary grinds of approximately P80 80, 50 and 40 μm to determine the best grind 
size.  The reagents used were potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) as collector, a standard 
dispersant, Dowfroth 250, and sulphuric acid for pH control. 

The results from the first phase ORC testing could be summarized as follows: 

 Sulphide nickel recovery to rougher concentrate ranged from 75% to 85%. 

 Improved results were achieved at the finer grind sizes. 

 The two assaying methods, ammonium citrate and bromine methanol, provided 
similar results. 

 The rougher concentrate typically contained approximately 1% Nis and contained 
many liberated gangue minerals. 

 Sedimentation of solids in the tailings was slow but manageable.

In addition to this preliminary work, standard grinding tests on two individual core samples, 
one each from Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset, gave Bond ball mill work index values of 
17.5 kWh/t and 16.4 kWh/t, respectively.  These results characterize the ore as medium-hard 
in a typical ball milling size range, with Rönnbäcksnäset slightly softer than Vinberget. 

ORC Phase 2 Testing 2009 

Phase 2 of the ORC test program commenced in March 2009 and finished in July 2009.  The 
objective of this testing was to produce higher grade concentrates in laboratory scale batch 
flotation tests while improving operating costs. 

Two composite samples representing the Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset deposits were 
prepared by the Company and sent to ORC. The composite sample assays are detailed in 
Table 69 below. 

Table 69: Composite sample assays from ORC Phase 2 Testing 2009 

 %NiS  %CoS  %NiT  %CoT  %FeT MgO 

Vinberget  0.118 0.006 0.177 0.009 5.36 35.6 

Rönnbäcksnäset 0.117 0.002 0.189 0.009 5.31 34.8 

 

This test work focused on standard flotation tests using a finer grind.  Initial tests were 
conducted at a P80 50μm, while in the later stages the grind size was varied between P80 
38μm and 31μm.  The reagent additions were modified throughout the testing using the 
following general scheme: 

 PAX as a collector; 

 Dowfroth 250 as a frother; 

 H2SO4 as a pH modifier;  

 Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) as a dispersant or MgO depressant (predominantly 
for Viberget); and 

 a second standard dispersant (predominantly for Rönnbäcksnäset ore). 

A total of 18 rougher flotation tests and 14 cleaner flotation tests were conducted on the two 
composite samples and were limited to open circuit batch tests.  

The finer grind sizes, P80 38 μm and 31 μm, produced much better results than coarser 
grinding.  Concentrate grades of between 25% and 35% were produced at overall sulphide 
nickel recoveries of 50% to 60%. Typical rougher recoveries at the finer grind were 77% to 
83%, and typical cleaner recoveries were 66% to 70%.  The results for the Vinberget sample 
were generally slightly better than those for the Rönnbäcksnäset composite at lower 
concentrate grades, however, at a grade of 28% Ni, the recovery from both composites was 
similar.

Following this testwork Outotec simulated closed circuit metallurgical performance in a 
commercial plant using HSC Chemistry®, steady state simulation software, by using the 
kinetic information from the laboratory results for the Vinberget ore only.  The results were 
validated against the open circuit results.  Laboratory locked cycle tests were not performed 
but the company made the decision to verify the simulations by closed circuit minipilot 
testing (see Phase 4 testing below).  Based on the simulation work, after four stages of 
cleaning, ORC predicted that a cleaner concentrate would contain 28% Ni at 74.5% 
recovery and approximately 1.0% Co.  

Other potential payable metals include gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. There are only 
minor quantities of these metals in the ore, so it is unlikely that these will contribute much 
revenue and, therefore, they have not generally been assayed for in the test work.  The 
estimated recoveries based on the very limited data available from one test at ORC are 20% 
recovery of Au and Ag, and 35% recovery of Pt and Pd 

ORC Phase 3 Testing 2009-2010 

The phase 3 testing at ORC, was performed in November 2009 through to March 2010 to 
investigate the effects of a coarser primary grind prior to rougher flotation followed by 
cleaning incorporating concentrate regrinding.  The primary grind was P80 50 to 60 μm.  In 
summary batch flotation gave a recovery of 65% at 25% nickel grade.  Overall the results of 
these batch flotation tests indicated an improvement in metallurgical performance and, using 
the simulation methodology previously described, the predicted performance in a 
commercial plant was 78% nickel recovery at a 28% concentrate grade. 

GTK Phase 4 Mini pilot plant testing 2010 

In March 2010, phase 4 mini pilot plant testing was performed at the Geological Survey of 
Finland Mineral Processing laboratories (GTK) in Finland using a 50 : 50 blend of samples 
of Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset ores.  The composite used in the phase 1 to 3 tests was 
exhausted in early 2010 and a second composite blend (Comp 2) of 50:50 Vinberget and 
Rönnbäcksnäset ore was made.   

The Comp 2 analysis was 0.128 % NiS and 0.203 % NT, 0.004% CoS and 0.011 % CoT, and 
0.074% S. 

Laboratory tests were performed on Comp 2 to compare the flotation response with Comp 1.  
In general the nickel recovery was below that achieved with Comp 1 by approximately 10%.  
No specific reason was identified for this effect. 

In the mini-pilot tests 1300 kg of sample was used in six 10-hour tests, over a six day 
period.  Typically, the feed rate was 21 to 22 kg/hour. 

The grinding circuit product size was P80 45 to 60 μm over the testing period.  A number of 
circuit configurations and reagent regimes were tested and the best results were achieved 
with four stages of cleaning (Figure 108).  The best results in terms of nickel recovery were 
80% at a grade of 22.3 % Ni, with 75% recovery achieved at a 25.8% Ni grade. 

It would be expected that the results in a larger pilot plant, incorporating full stream recycle 
would improve these results.

ORC Phase 4 testing of Sundsberget 

Preliminary laboratory testing of ore from Sundsberget was performed in 2010.  Test results 
indicated a similar metallurgical response to that achieved with the blends of Vinberget and 
Rönnbäcksnäset ores and consequently for this evaluation SRK considers it reasonable to 
apply similar nickel recovery and grade predictions to Sundsberget ore. 

Further more extensive testing of blends containing this ore type is planned.  

ORC Phase 4 Testing 2010 

Further laboratory testing of the Comp 2 blend of Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset were 
performed in 2010 to investigate the effects of alternative reagent regimes and lower reagent 
dosages and to try and reduce the MgO content of the concentrate.  In general terms, further 
improvements in the nickel grade – recovery relationship were achieved with up to 28% 
nickel grade achieved at recoveries equivalent to 80% in closed circuit, as demonstrated in 
scaling up from laboratory to minipilot during the minipilot campaign. This indicates that 
there is scope to use different reagents and reduce the reagent dosages without adversely 
affecting metallurgical performance.  This work was still ongoing in mid-March 2011.

Magnetite recovery from flotation tailings 

Preliminary testwork to investigate the recovery of a magnetite concentrate from the 
sulphide flotation tailings was performed in late 2010 and early 2011.  In order to avoid 
complications with the sulphide flotation, preliminary magnetic separation tests were 
performed on head samples of both Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset ores.  Consequently, the 
levels of nickel, cobalt and sulphur in the magnetite concentrate are likely to be higher than

would be expected from the testing or treatment of flotation tailings.  Samples typically 
contained 5 to 6% Fe and most of the recoverable iron is in the form of magnetite.   

Initial tests have focused on low intensity magnetic separation (LIMS), using roughing and 
up to three stages of cleaning followed by desliming and/or reverse flotation.  Published 
results to date have indicated that 53% of the contained iron (approaching 80% of the 
magnetite) can be recovered in to a low grade iron concentrate (57% Fe) with minimal 
sulphur.  Ultrafine grinding at a P80 of 20 microns has been required due to the fine mineral 
grain sizing. 

Further tests have been performed and it has been reported by the Company that improved 
concentrate grades up to 62.4% Fe have been achieved at 70% magnetite recovery (Figure 
111).  

While the concentrate grade is in the lower range of marketable concentrates and the 
currently predicted impurity levels are high, further testwork is planned to investigate the 
improvement of both the iron grade and the reduction of impurities, principally SiO2, MgO 
and Cr2O3) to acceptable levels. Table 70 lists the key assays achieved in testwork, and the 
potential values achievable, calculated by extrapolation.  It is important to note that these 
values are not guaranteed and have to be verified by further testwork.

It is worthwhile noting that assays for P and S impurities are very low. 

Preliminary reverse flotation testwork has been inefficient, with poor removal of magnesium 
silicates.  The next phase of testwork will investigate additional processing options 
including desliming dispersion, alternate collectors and pH adjustment in combination with 
concentrate regrinding and reverse flotation.  

Future Metallurgical Testwork 

Additional laboratory testing, mini pilot testing and full scale pilot testing is planned for 
2011 and 2012.  This testing is required to: 

 finalise the optimum flowsheet for blends of the three main ore types, Vinberget, 
Rönnbäcksnäset and Sunsberget; 

 further investigate the reduction of penalty elements, particularly MgO and As, in the 
nickel concentrate; 

 improve metallurgical performance in terms of both nickel concentrate grade and 
nickel recovery, and to confirm the extrapolated metallurgical performance for the 
three ore types; 

 finalise the reagent regime and consumption figures; 

 finalise the circuit and metallurgical performance of the magnetite recovery circuit; 

 test a wide range of samples from across the different ore bodies (variability testing); 

 finalise the plant design parameters; and 

 provide final design data for equipment such as regrinding, thickeners and filters. 

Testing should include pilot scale testing of the circuit using blends of the three main ore 
types. 

Comminution testwork will be required to confirm the application of autogenous grinding 
and for sizing of the crushing and grinding circuits.  The requirements should be discussed

with the major equipment suppliers and should include internationally recognised testing 
methods and if possible large scale grinding tests using the different ore types. 

Concentrates from pilot plant test work may also be used to produce larger amounts of 
concentrate for negotiation with smelters for off-take agreements. 

17.4.2 Mineralogy 

Mineralogical work has been a mix of qualitative and quantitative work, consisting of 
optical microscopy examinations, and SEM analysis of the various minerals observed, 
together with Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA) of feeds, and selected concentrates and 
tails. The work has been based on composite samples from each major deposit comprising 
the resource. 

The mineralogical assay of magnetite was approximately 6%. This figure is used in 
magnetite recovery studies. 

Vinberget Sample  

The predominant mineral in the Vinberget sample is antigorite, but significant amounts of 
chlorite are also present suggesting that altered peridotite or pyroxenite rock types exist in 
addition to serpentinites.  Diopside was also found, which was not present in samples 
studied earlier. 

Pentlandite, (Ni,Fe)9S8, is the main Ni-sulphide, but some heazlewoodite, Ni3S2, is also 
present in the Vinberget sample.  Heazlewoodite occurs mainly as lamellae in pentlandite.  
Based on optical observations the pentlandite to heazlewoodite ratio is approximately 3 to 1.  
Antigorite contains trace amounts of nickel, at an average of 0.1% Ni.  Magnetite and 
chromite also contain low amounts of nickel. 

The total nickel content of the Vinberget sample was assayed as 0.177% Ni.  Sulphide 
nickel was measured as 0.118% Ni, using the BM method. This indicates that 67% of the 
nickel is in sulphide form, and 33% is in non-sulphides. 

Optical microscopy examinations showed that 50% of the nickel sulphides were liberated at 
<45 μm, 65% at <38 μm, and 90% at <20 μm.  MLA showed that 91% liberation is achieved 
at a 38 μm grind.  This indicated that a primary grind of approximately P80 45 μm was 
required to achieve the necessary liberation and that regrinding will be required in the 
flotation cleaner circuits to produce acceptable Ni concentrate grades.  The predominant 
unliberated particles were identified as binaries with serpentine (antigorite). 

Rönnbäcksnäset Sample 

In the Rönnbäcksnäset sample, antigorite was found to predominate, but with heazlewoodite 
as the dominant sulphide.  The grain size was found to vary mainly from 10 to 100 μm, 
while very small grains of Co-pentlandite and maucherite were encountered together with 
heazlewoodite. 

Heazlewoodite is the main Ni-sulphide, while only a couple of pentlandite grains were 
found and, in each case, they were Co-rich.  Heazlewoodite was found to occur mainly as

locked grains with antigorite and, to a lesser degree, with magnetite.  No pyrite or pyrrhotite 
was noted. 

The total nickel content of the Rönnbäcksnäset sample was assayed as 0.189% Ni, with 
sulphide nickel measured at 0.117% Ni, using the BM method.  This indicates that 62% of 
the nickel is in sulphide form, and 38% is in non-sulphides. 

Again the optical microscopy work indicates that a relatively fine grind is required for good 
liberation. MLA work shows 89% liberation at a grind of 39 μm.  Both methods indicate 
that relatively high grade concentrates can be produced. 

Sundsberget Sample 

The Sunsberget sample consists mainly of the serpentine mineral, antigorite.  The remainder 
of the sample is mainly composed of diopside, chlorite, magnetite, chromite and magnesite.  
Tiny amounts of carbonates, olivine, chromium-bearing magnetite, Ni-sulphides and 
maucherite are also present. Heazlewoodite is the main nickel sulphide, containing 
approximately 54% of the total nickel.  Pentlandite is the secondary nickel sulphide 
containing approximately 11% of the total nickel.  The remaining nickel is contained in 
magnetite (19%) and silicates. 

The total nickel content of the Sundsberget sample was assayed as 0.190% Ni, with sulphide 
nickel measured at 0.112% Ni, using the BM method.  This indicates that 59% of the nickel 
is in sulphide form. 

Iron is present as magnetite (66%) and serpentine (23%).  The MgO% is nearly 36%. 

As with the Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset samples, the nickel grain size was found to vary 
mainly from 10 to 100 μm. 

17.4.3 Concentrate Quality 

The quality of concentrates, in terms of nickel content, produced from the various testing 
programmes has been high.  Results from minipilot campaign are shown in Figure 112, 
Figure 113 and Figure 114.  It should be noted that this concentrate would be considered 
fairly unique amongst Ni concentrates as it has a high Ni content and very low Fe content, 
owing to the high percentage of Ni contained in heazlewoodite (Ni3S2).

Figure 112: Major Assays in Concentrate from Minipilot Testing 

 
Preliminary terms have been received from a number of smelters around the world.  From 
these terms and as noted in previous reviews, the main concern will be with the high content 
of MgO in the concentrate, which can attract penalties, depending on the smelter.  Based on 
the results to date it is likely that the concentrate would be penalized by some smelters.   

Minor elements include Co, Al, Cu, Cr and Ca.  The concentrate is unusually rich in cobalt 
compared to typical Ni concentrates. Trace elements of concern include arsenic and 
antimony. 

The As content may attract a penalty depending upon the smelter treating the concentrate. It 
may be possible that the attractiveness of the high Ni:Fe ratio will offset potential 
disadvantages from MgO, SiO2, and As. Impurities such as Pb and Zn are often associated 
with sulphide nickel deposits.  At Ronnbacken these elements do not appear to be in 
sufficiently high concentration to require special treatment at downstream facilities.  
However, levels of Hg at <10 ppm in concentrate have been found, which may require 
removal downstream.  This potential issue can be resolved by way of mercury removal 
technology, which is commercially available. 

Other elements, such as Sb and Mn, have been noted at levels <500 ppm which should not 
incur significant commercial penalties and Cr has been noted at levels <1000 ppm which 
should also be manageable at downstream smelters. 

Further testwork is planned to investigate the possibility of reducing these impurity levels. 

Precious and platinum group metals are present at close to payable levels, depending on the 
grade of concentrate produced.

A certificate of the analysis at the highest grade in the minipilot series shown is included in 
Appendix B. 

17.4.4 Metallurgical Performance 

In general, based on the results of the batch flotation and the mini pilot tests, together with 
the ORC simulations, the metallurgical performance of nickel in a commercial plant should 
be around 80% sulphide nickel recovery at 28% nickel grade. 

17.4.5 Mineral Processing 

The currently assumed Rönnbäcken flow sheet consists of crushing, grinding, flotation, and 
dewatering steps typical of Scandinavian concentrator operations. The conceptual 
concentrator design, together with capital and operating cost estimates, has been prepared by 
Outotec AB (Sweden). The mill will have a capacity of 30 Mtpa or 3,750 tph, and will 
produce approximately 95,000 tpa of nickel concentrate at 28% Ni.  

The mining schedule indicates that a blend of ore will be produced from the three ore 
deposits, predominantly Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset in the first four to five years and 
Rönnbäcksnäset and Sundsberget in subsequent years.  The Vinberget ore has a slightly 
higher Ni grade than the other two ore bodies and consequently the plant feed grade will be 
approximately 0.116% Ni in years 1 to 5 and approximately 0.103% Ni in later years when 
Rönnbäcksnäset and Sundsberget ore is processed. 

The plant will be split into two parallel streams.  In each stream ore will be blended and 
crushed to less than 300 mm in a gyratory crusher and sent to a coarse ore stockpile.  Ore 
will be fed from the stockpile by apron feeders onto belt conveyors to feed the two parallel 
grinding circuits each comprising a primary autogenous grinding mill (AG) and two 
secondary pebble mills.  The pebble mills are fed directly from the discharge of the primary 
mills and pebbles will be extracted automatically from the AG mills as required.  The

concentrator will operate 8,000 hours per year (91.3% availability) at a feed rate of 
nominally 2,000 tph to each grinding line. 

The grinding circuit product will be classified using hydrocyclones.  Hydrocyclone 
underflow will gravitate back to the pebble mills and overflow will report by gravity to the 
rougher conditioning prior to flotation.   

A dispersant will be added directly to the grinding mills, along with collector. Water will be 
further added to the conditioners to reach an optimal pulp density of approximately 30% 
solids. Sulphuric acid will be used to modify the pH.  Additional reagents will be added to 
the flotation circuit as required.  

The conditioned slurry will be pumped to rougher flotation consisting of several 500 m3 
flotation cells.  Flotation tailings will be pumped to the tailings paste thickeners, located at 
the tailings pond site. 

The rougher concentrate, approximately 5% to 10% by weight of the feed, will be pumped 
to the concentrate regrind circuit from where it will be pumped to a four stage cleaner 
flotation circuit consisting of 200 m3 , 100 m3, 50 m3 and 10 m3 flotation cells. 

A final nickel concentrate grading approximately 28% Ni will be produced. 

The final concentrate will be pumped to two concentrate thickeners from where it will be 
pumped to a single concentrate holding tank.  The concentrate will be dewatered in two 
pressure filters.  The filter cake will report to a concentrate loading system for bulk shipping 
by truck.  

Final tailings will be pumped to a paste plant for creating paste for disposal at the tailings 
dam, the water will be mainly reclaimed in the thickeners and recycled back to the plant, 
primarily to the grinding circuit. 

SRK considers the flowsheet to be a conventional flotation concentrator utilising the 
accepted Scandinavian autogenous style grinding circuit configuration.  The use of large 
flotation cells has been shown to maintain or improve metallurgical performance, while 
reducing maintenance and power costs.

17.4.6 Processing Plant Location and Layout 

The processing plant site location has been selected to be in close proximity to the 
Rönnbäcksnäset deposit and the planned tailings management facility (TMF). 

The plant layout has been chosen to utilize the natural geography and topography of the 
area. The proposed location is suitable for the size of the plant and the proposed layout 
provides for a conventional flow of material from the crusher to the milling and gravity 
section, to the flotation plant, and finally to the concentrate handling and tailings handling 
parts of the plant. 

The preliminary location selected is on Rönnbäcksnäset to the northwest of the 
Rönnbäcksnäset proposed pit, as illustrated in Figure 116. 

An initial plant layout has been prepared by Outotec AB and is shown in Figure 117 and 
Figure 118.

17.4.7 Infrastructure 

A preliminary assessment of the external infrastructure, power supply, transport links, 
shipping facilities has been made and in SRK's opinion there are no major issues that would 
affect project development.

17.4.8 Capital Costs 

The process plant, TMF (excluding dam construction) and associated infrastructure capital 
costs, based on the treatment of 30 Mtpa of Run of Mine (RoM) ore, have been estimated by 
Outotec Sweden AB, to a scoping study level of accuracy, using budget quotations for major 
equipment and in-house data base costs for other items, are presented in Table 71.  A 25% 
contingency has been applied to all general costs, with 20% applied to specific equipment 
items for which quotes were received.  The costs do not include the equipment required for 
magnetite recovery.  SRK considers these costs to be acceptable based on the information 
available.

17.4.9 Operating Costs 

The processing operating costs for the plant, based on the treatment of 30 Mtpa of RoM ore, 
have been estimated by Outotec Sweden AB.  SRK concurs with this estimate. The 
operating cost summary is presented in Table 72.

17.4.10 Concentrate Grade 

Most nickel concentrates are predominantly pentlandite and range in nickel content from 5% 
to 15% nickel.  The mineralogy of the Rönnbäcken ores allows nickel concentrate grades to 
be relatively high grade in comparison with other operations (Figure 121).  This nickel 
concentrate grade is achievable through conventional grinding and flotation.  Most sulphide 
nickel ores (Sudbury, Norilsk, Jinchuan) contain a mixture of pentlandite and iron sulphides 
- typically pyrite and pyrrhotite - which form finely textured mineral aggregates that can be 
difficult to liberate.  Pentlandite needs to be separated from gangue, pyrite and nickel 
containing pyrrhotite which limits the typical nickel grade of concentrates to typically 7% to 
15%.   

 

Figure 121: Comparison of Rönnbäcken concentrate grade with other 
operations 

The Rönnbäcken serpentinites are distinct from other well-known nickel sulphide ores, due 
to the presence of nickel-rich sulphide minerals, specifically; heazlewoodite (71-75% 
nickel), pentlandite of 35-44% nickel (typically 32-35% nickel) and minor amounts of

millerite (61-65% nickel).  In addition, iron sulphides, such as pyrite and pyrrhotite, are 
almost completely absent.

17.5 Infrastructure 

Overview 

The technical and cost assumption for Project infrastructure were prepared for the Company 
by Tommy Schönfeldt of WSP Environmental, Skellefteå and summarized in the 
spreadsheet "Nickel Mountain kalkyl infrastruktur rev 20110208". In developing the 
technical and cost assumptions for the Project, SRK understands that WSP has drawn on this 
recent experience and also information provided to WSP by the Company, particularly with 
regard to exising public roads. 

As part of this work, WSP prepared a high-level design for roads, buildings, electrical 
infrastructure. Costs associated with contractor barracks were assumed by WSP to be part of 
the Owner's Cost and as such were excluded from design and cost estimation. 

Site layout is illustrated in Figure 116 above, and a summary of infrastructure capital cost 
estimates are presented in Table 73 below. Table 74 presents a summary of shared 
infrastructure between mining operations at each of the three proposed pits.

Contingencies of between 20% and 25 % have been applied to infrasture capital costs. SRK 
consider these assumptions to be reasonable and have incorporated these into the TEM. 

WSP has not assumed any costs for transport of mine waste material and overburden for 
construction of infrastructure. Unit mining operating costs for haulage to the waste dump 
have been applied to the total tonnage of waste rock mined at the operation and these costs 
are assumed to cover transport to each area of construction as and when required. SRK notes 
that costs of waste material transport for construction may be higher than the cost of 
transport to the waste rock dump, given necessary selection and compaction of material. In 
general however, this may be a reasonable assumption for this level of study and provided 
that sufficient material of the desired quality can be sourced from on-site mining activities.

Public Roads 

During operation, nickel concentrate production is expected to average around 90 ktpa. In 
accordance with currently regulations, a 40 t payload is assumed, which implies between six 
and 8 round-trips per day. 

Road traffic related to transport of consumables, chemicals (including acid) and spare parts 
to the mine is assumed to be in the range to 14 to 20 trucks per day. Transport of fuel for is 
expected to be in the range one to two trucks per day. 

In total, the Company estimates that between 21 to 30 trucks per day may be required to 
access the Project site, although for certain periods during the construction years, the 
volume of traffic to and from site may be greater. 

At present, no consideration has been given to transport of waste material for construction 
either from or to site. 

Access to the Project site is currently along the east side of Lake Gardiken, via a narrow 
public gravel road. The road connects to highway E12 at its northern and southern end.  
From the proposed Rönnbäcken industrial area to this local road the distance to highway 
E12 is 14 km in a southerly direction and 31 km in a northerly direction.  

To meet the demands of heavy traffic during mining and construction the road going south, 
must be upgrade to meet year around two way road standard "BK1". The gravel road going 
north, must also be upgraded to meet year around personal commuting traffic and small 
truck transports from the airport and local business in Tärnaby/Hemavan. The Swedish 
Transport Administration (Trafikverket Region Nord) typically organises construction and 
upgrading of public roads. The costs for this however, are typically shared between the 
Company and the State after negotiations. Estimated costs for upgrading public roads are 
estimated at SEK109M.

Rönnbäcken Resource Estimate Page 162 

File Ref P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx   April 2011 

Part of the existing gravel road connection to highway E12 passes over the Ajaure 
hydropower dam. The dam wall is built to meet BK1 standard. In addition, the dam was 
reinforced during to support heavy traffic during construction of the nearby Gejmån 
hydropower dam. The Company has not allowed for any provision for upgrades to the 
public road at the Ajaure hydropower dam. 

During operation, the volume of heavy traffic is estimated at between 17 and 25 trucks per 
day, including concentrate transport and mine/plant comsumables. 

Mine Roads 

A road profile with a lane width of 21 m and 2 x 5 m dikes has been adopted, with waste 
rock of an average height of 3.0 m, with a surface of 30 cm crushed rock at 0/40 mm. The 
road embankment across lake Gardiken between Sundsberget and Rönnbäcksnäset includes 
a number of culverts, designed to withstand a flow rate of 325 m3/s. 

Industrial Area Pad 

The area of the industrial pad at the concentrator and workshops is assumed to be 15 ha, of 
which 7.5 ha will be tarmac paved. The area for the changing rooms and offices is assumed 
to be 2.5 ha, of which 1 ha is assumed to be tarmac paved. 

WSP has assumed that 50% of the total costs associated with establishing the industrial pad 
are included as capital costs in the construction of the concentrator. 

Sundsberget Pit Wall Dam 

The current life of mine (LoM) plan assumes that mining at the south end of Sundsberget 
will be carried out within an area currently covered within and below the seasonal variation 
of Lake Gardiken. As such, construction of a retaining dam wall will be necessary. The 
construction of the dam may require a cofferdam prior to initiate the construction of the 
dam, depending on the level of Lake Gardiken during the construction period. 

It is assumed that the dam itself will compose a core of sheet piling, with an embankment of 
waste rock and overburden. The dam has an average height of about 27 m and a length of 
approximately 2 km. The Company has estimated the cost of construction of this dam to be 
USD24M. SRK notes that this cost will be strongly dependent on prevailing ground 
conditions and that this capital cost may increase following further ground investigation.  

Buildings 

WSP has assumed a total work force, including contractors, of between 250 and 300 people. 
Buildings include provision for dressing room, office, restaurant, mechanical and electrical 
workshop, truck workshops, heated and cold storage, a sewage treatment plant and recycling 
facilities are also included.  

Capital cost assumptions include construction, soil and foundation engineering, electrical, 
plumbing and HVAC installations.

File Ref P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx   April 2011 

Electrical Power Supply 

WSP has considered a complete electrical power grid system for mining and the processing 
plant, assuming a power demand of 160 MW. Specifically, capital cost assumptions include 
the incoming line and receiving main station 220 V (four transformers), all electrical grid 
and substations to the drive systems for crushers, mills, flotation, tailings pumping, fresh 
water and dewatering for the Project open pits. 

17.6 Tailings Management 

The current mine plan for the three pits estimates a total ore production of 528 Mt which 
will essentially become tailings once processed. Should a magnetite concentrate also be 
produced at the operation, the total tonnage of tailings may be closer to 500 Mt. Figure 122 
provides a conceptual illustration of the Project layout during operation. 

 

Figure 122: Conceptual layout of the Project during operation 

 
The tailings will be subject to a thickening process to produce a bulk dry density estimated 
at 1550 kg/m3 once deposited. This density will therefore produce a tailings volume of up to 
340 Mm3 that will be stored in the tailings impoundment. The proposed design for the TMF 
is to construct a cluster of three cells that will require the construction of four dams located 
west of the Rönnbäcksnäset island in Lake Gardiken (Figure 123). 

Deposition of the tailings will be achieved by spigotting the tailings over the TMF to 
maximise the storage capacity. Two clarification ponds will be constructed at both ends of 
the TMF and are identified as CP-1 and CP-2 in Figure 123.

The two internal tailings dams for cell 1B will have an estimated average height of 25 m and 
lengths of 700 and 1,100 m. The south dam for cell 1A will have a dam with an average 
height estimated at 40 m and a length of 2,800 m. The dam at the north end of Cell 1C will 
be about 800 m long and have an average height of 55 m. The two internal dams will 
eventually be covered by tailings once Cell 1C is in operation. 

 

Figure 123: Proposed design layout of the Rönnbäcken TMF 

 
The proposed dam design consists of a pervious rockfill dam that will not restrict the 
movement of pore water between the deposited tailings and the dam. It is designed to retain 
the tailings particles and act as a drain. The dams will include a filter zone on the tailings 
side for restricting the movement of fine particles with the groundwater flow. The current 
approach is to import filter material from a source located roughly 30 km from the mine site. 
Figure 124 below presents a cross-section of the proposed dam design. 

Irrespective of siting and mitigation measures, there will be a surplus of water in and on the 
impounded tailings. The runoff of this water will either flow through the drainage system or 
the decanting outlet or seep through the dam. Some of that water will reach the downstream 
lake and river system. To minimize the transport of particles via surface runoff, the decanted 
water will pass a clarification pond where most of the suspended particles settle.  

Pore water from the tailings will eventually be released into the lake via the dam drainage 
system due to lake level fluctuations, excess pore water from the tailings deposition and 
from precipitation. The quantity and quality of that water is difficult to estimate at this stage 
because of limited information. There are plans however to investigate the concentrations of 
particles and potential contaminants in these effluent waters as well as the annual loads of 
them to the river system. Additionally, seepage analysis through the dams and geochemical 
testing such as leaching tests are scheduled for the subsequent phase of the project. This will 
be an important background for the coming EIA study that accompanies the permit 
applications.

During the construction period of the tailings impoundment, there will be periods when the 
external, regulated water level will be higher than the surface of the tailings immediately 
close to the dam. Lake water will infiltrate the tailings impoundment during that period and 
come in contact with the tailings in that situation. The adjustment of the water level inside 
the impoundment would control the hydraulic gradient across the dam, but it will not 
prevent the water inside the impoundment to come in contact with the tailings. The potential 
for contamination will be dependent on the properties of the tailings. As mentioned above, it 
is difficult at this stage to estimate the level of contamination as additional characterisation 
is required before making predictions. The possible transport of suspended solides and the 
risk of contaminated water from the tailings should therefore be assessed and the 
consequences of mitigating measures on the operation costs be evaluated.

The two clarification ponds will have to be designed as water retaining dams in order to be 
able to control the water turn over rate and the internal water level and to retain suspended 
solids from surface runoff from the deposited tailings. They will also require a water barrier 
such as a liner or a low permeability barrier within the dam and potentially some grouting in 
the bedrock. These dams will have to be designed to cover the 20 m high water fluctuation 
in the lake plus the minimum water column along the dam alignments. As with the other 
dams, cofferdams may be required for construction at least for some parts of the dam 
lengths. The construction of such dams will also require the inclusion of a low permeability 
component to retain the water. Construction control will also be greater for such dams 
because of their water retaining requirements. Information provided by the Company's 
design team indicates that the cost to construct the two clarification ponds would be 
included in the cost to construct the tailings dam. SRK estimates that construction cost for 
the clarification ponds would typically be in order of USD15M or more depending on the 
site conditions. This capital cost provision has been included in the TEM. 

The details of the tailings dams and their construction are at present limited. The 
construction of the dams will require cofferdams to isolate the foundation elements from the 
lake water. Cofferdams are not mentioned in the reviewed documents. The dam and 
cofferdam materials could represents a combined volume in the order of 30 Mm3 based on 
the schematic details provided for review. 

Capital Cost Estimate for TMF Construction  

The capital costs provided by the Company estimates tailings distribution system at 
USD92M (see Table 71 above), construction costs for tailings dam and clarification ponds 
of USD107M and an additional USD6M for the excavation and stockpiling of the 
overburden material from beneath the dams. 

In the context of the level of detail provided, SRK estimates the cost to construct the tailings 
dams at about USD150M, excluding the distribution system for the tailings and excluding 
construction costs for the clarification ponds.SRK's cost assumptions for this have been 
incorporated into the TEM and profiled by applying 20% in the pre-production years and 
following this, 10% bi-annually until Year 16.  

SRK notes that the Company has assumed that the costs of placing waste rock at the dams 
for dam construction will incur the same cost as hauling the waste rock to the dumps. 
Hauling waste rock to the dump is usually limited to loading, hauling and dumping. Dam 
construction will usually require selecting the material and involves spreading and 
compacting the material once hauled and dumped. Travel conditions (road width, turning 
area, slopes, surface conditions, etc) and distances will also contribute to increase the unit 
cost of waste rock material as dam material. Dam construction will require greater efforts 
and thus present a higher comparable cost than hauling waste rock material to the waste rock 
dumps. 

Sub-aerial deposition of thickened tailings has been the selected process as a measure to 
increase the density of the tailings once deposited. Thicken tailings has the benefit of 
reducing the storage requirements, the time for consolidation and segregation of the tailings 
particles. Total operating cost estimates of USD0.14/t, for preparation and pumping of 
tailings were prepared by Outotec. SRK considers these costs to be reasonable.

Recirculation of the pore water from the TMF could introduce accumulation of 
contaminants over time. The accumulated contaminant will eventually reach the lake water 
given the pervious nature of the tailings dams. High contaminant levels could require 
treatment at the clarification ponds, thus potentially adding to operating and/or closure costs. 
For instance, a water treatment could eventually be required for removing those 
contaminants.  

The location of the TMF is inside a fresh water lake that was created by a hydro-electric 
dam. Although the lake is man-made, it remains that it is clean water that currently supports 
a fish population which is another issue that will need to be addressed. This fact indicates 
that the investment costs should include costs for compensation for loss of values of fishing, 
as discussed in later sections of this report. 

Summary and SRK Comments 

In summary, SRK considers that the construction costs for the tailings dams and the 
clarification ponds have been underestimated. The cost estimate does not itemise separately 
the dams for the clarification ponds and the cofferdams that would be required for dam 
construction. Additionally, the cost estimate is based on the assumption that waste rock 
material used for dam construction will have the same cost as waste rock disposal in the 
dumps. Accordingly, for the purpose of the TEM presented in thie report, SRK has adjusted 
the capital cost estimate for dam construction (USD165M) to include a 15 MUSD provision 
for clarification pond construction and USD150M for tailings dam construction. 

Operating cost assumptions for tailings management are considered to be appropriate. 

Further investigation is required to confirm the acid generating and metal leach potential of 
the tailings. This presents a particular area of risk given the location of the TMF in Lake 
Gardiken and a permeable dam wall. 

SRK notes that the Swedish authority responsible for granting the Project an exploitation 
concession, the Mining Inspectorate, has issued the required permits and/or approvals for the 
Project to proceed to the next phase of permitting based on the environmental impact 
assessments (MKB) submitted with the exploitation concession applications for 
Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget.

17.7 Acid Rock Drainage and Metal Leaching (ARDML) 

Background 

Preliminary acid rock drainage and metal leaching studies of tailings and waste rock 
material at Rönnbäcken have been carried out by Tom Lundgren of Ambiental Ltd. 

It is stated in the Ambiental (2011) memorandum that: 

'The process of permitting the mining of the Rönnbäcken ore deposits according to the 

Environmental Act will to a large extent be based on evaluations of the risk that waste 

deposits from the operation will generate acid leachates that contaminate the groundwater 

or the downstream surface waters with trace elements'. These evaluations are made at three 

stages where the first stage results in a classification of the waste in "inert" or "not inert 

waste". This is conducted with respect to the potential to generate acid and to hold 

potentially harmful substances.  If classified as "inert" the waste is judged not to need any 

more detailed investigations with regard to its environmental properties.  

At this stage, the "acid generating" aspect is based entirely on the concentration of sulfur. 

If it is lower than 0.1 % by weight it is judged not to be able to produce acid irrespective of 

its content of neutralizing agents. If the percentage of sulfur is higher than 1 %, special 

studies have to be carried out in order to show if and how much acid will be produced and 

what the quality is of the resulting leachate in terms of dissolved, potentially hazardous 

elements. If the sulfur concentration is between 0.1 and 1.0 %, the internal ability of the 

waste to neutralize the acid shall be considered. This is accomplished by a standardized 

procedure called acid base accounting (ABA) where the potential to produce acid is 

calculated from the sulfur concentration and the neutralizing capacity is measured by 

titration with acid. The procedure is defined and described in the standard prEN 15875. If 

the ratio between the neutralizing potential and the acid potential in the sample is higher 

than 3 (and the sulfur content < 1%), the waste is classified as "inert". 

If the waste is not classified as "inert", a permit for disposal of the waste (Environmental 

Protection Act) must be based on a prognosis of the amount of acid and potentially 

hazardous elements that will be produced from the deposit. Such a prognosis should be 

based on kinetic tests such as column leaching tests and humidity cell tests'. 

The exploration surveys of the Rönnbäcken ore deposits have shown that the sulfur content 

of the waste rock is variable, between 0.38 and 0.02%, but that the tailings is well below 

0.1 %. In conjunction with the ABA assessment the tailings will be classified as "inert" 

waste and it is stated that no kinetic tests are needed for this waste type. However, results 

from the analysis of the tailings decant water indicates high levels of sulfate in solution, 

>1,300 mg/L, that could imply the potential oxidation of any sulfides present yet from the 

metallurgical testing the ore has a high buffering pH, that requires pH correction during the 

processing of the ore. This pH correction was undertaken with sulfuric acid, reported at 

12 kg/t of ore, and this addition could explain the excess of sulfate ions observed. In more 

recent process tests, this consumption of sulfuric acid has been reduced to less than 2 kg/t of 

ore. SRK would therefore recommend that further analysis of the new tailings decant water 

is undertaken  to confirm the material's 'inert' classification.  



SRK Consulting

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

For the other waste rocks it is less clear as to their classification due to the minimal 

sampling and characterisation undertaken to date. 

The samples 

The sampling procedure is also described in Ambiental (2011) as follows. Key aspects are 

underlined:  

'The samples used for the ABA-tests are master (composite) samples collected from rock 

cores taken at the exploration drillings for the Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset nickel 

deposits. These cores were taken to delineate the ore bodies. Hence, they were taken in the 

mineralized zone (ore) and in close vicinity to the ore (waste rock). Therefore these rock 

cores do not represent the whole rock mass that will be excavated if the ore body will be 

exploited. The extent of the waste rock volume will be defined at a later stage of the project 

when supplementary studies of the ARD potential have to be carried out. 

The program for sampling was established with the objective to compose a set of samples 

that are representative for those parts of the waste rock types that were found in the 

exploration rock cores with the highest sulfur content of the two ore deposits Vinberget and 

Rönnbäcksnäset. Based on core log data the exploration geologists identified four main 

types of rock types that are present in the immediate vicinity of the ore bodies at Vinberget 

and Rönnbäcksnäset. They were named "Mafic" (felsic-mafic metavulcanite, pyroxenite), 

"Sed" (phyllitic schist of the regular type for the area), "G-Sed" (graphite schist) and "K-

sed" (chlorite schist). The exploration geologists made a selection of cores that represent 

the four "high-sulfur" main types of waste rock at both exploration areas and from these 

cores 10 subsamples were randomly selected for each of the four master samples 

representing the respective waste rock type. The master samples were delivered to the 

Swedish Geotechnical Institute for acid-base-accounting according to the standard prEN 

15875.  

The above extract describes the sample selection procedure for Rönnbäcken. It is clear that 

the assessment is still in the early stages of development and further work needs to be 

completed to define the waste rock. 

Compilation of the acid-base accounting results 

The results of the acid-base-accounting were reported by the Swedish Geotechnical Institute. 

Table 75 is a compilation of that report, which also includes acid-base-accounting on a 

sample of tailings that was retrieved from a mini-pilot test on thickening of tailings from the 

Vinberget and Rönnbäcksnäset ore resources. 

The two samples having a neutralization potential ratio (NPR) that is lower than the 

stipulated value 3 for "inert" waste are marked with red.

Sedimentary waste rock "K-sed" 0,02 0.015 0.85 0.83 56 

 

Conclusions 

As shown in Table 75, the tailings have a very low content of sulfur and a relatively high 

neutralization capacity. The neutralization potential ratio (NPR) of 28 is high enough to 

ensure that ARD will not be generated from this waste. The same is valid for the rock waste 

type called "K-sed" which must be designated as having a very low potential to form acid. 

However, the sulfur content of the remaining three "worst case" waste rock types is 

substantially higher, in the order of 0.3-0.4 %.  

The worst case sulfur concentrations are considered to be low or moderately high but high 

enough to be subjected to further evaluation according to the regulation. One of these, the 

ordinary schist ("Sed") has a high enough neutralization potential to be classified as "inert 

waste". In order to be prepared for possible ARD problems, the other two waste rock types 

should be subject to further studies using kinetic tests. 

As was emphasized in the introduction, this study is preliminary and indicative. Further 

sampling has to be accomplished of both tailings and waste rock when more specified 

information is available regarding the waste materials that actually will be generated. A 

specific programme should be developed in order to achieve a high degree of representation 

of the samples that are chosen for future studies. 

Recommendations 

On the basis of the studies undertaken and rerpot by Ambiental (2011), SRK would 

recommend the following work to be undertaken: 

 A full programme of sampling and testing. The sampling program should take 
advantage of existing exploration drillhole assay data available in order to determine 

the variability of sulfur within the waste rock units. In addition, sampling should be 

undertaken from geotechnical drilling in the waste rock in order to fully characterise 

the bulk of the waste. Sample testing should include the following: 

o Whole Rock Assay (through multi acid digestion or similar); 

o Acid Base Accounting (in accordance with prEN15873); 

o two stage deionised water leach testing (in accordance with EN12457-3); 

o Net Acid Generation (NAG) testing (in accordance with EGI, 2002);

o Mineralogical Assessment; and 

o humidity cell testwork (if deemed necessary). 

 Kinetic characterisation testing of any materials subsequently not classified as inert to 
determine their long term stability.  

 

17.8  Water Management 

17.8.1 Hydrological Setting 

The project area is located in low mountain terrain with an average precipitation of around 
750 mm/year and up to 2.7 mm/day or 97 mm/month for July when the most precipitation 
occurs (FAO, 2011).  Rainfall events are mainly frontal or orographic.  The annual snow-
melt, which generally occurs in April or May, is also an important consideration when sizing 
surface water control infrastructure. 

No site specific groundwater data has yet been collected at Rönnbäcken and so the current 
hydrogeological interpretation of the site relies on the current geological understanding, 
publically available data and SRK's experience in similar deposits in Scandinavia and other 
areas of the world.  Further work will be required at the next stage of investigation in order 
to better define the hydrogeological understanding and make an assessment of the potential 
implications on pit water management, water supply and water and tailings dams.  

The geology of the Rönnbäcken deposits and surrounding area are discussed in detail in 
previous sections of this report. Broadly, geology at Rönnbäcken comprises mainly 
greenschist and amphibolite metamorphic facies, phyllites, metavolcanics, metasediments 
and serpentinised ultramafic rocks, in which the nickel sulphides are hosted.  Matrix 
permeability in the majority of these rocks is likely to be on the whole low and therefore 
groundwater flow in the bedrock will be almost exclusively limited to fractures associated 
with faults and jointing, which in turn is likely to be mainly structurally controlled although 
lithological differences will have an influence on the nature of fracture properties and 
development.   

The basement rocks in the area belong to two significant nappe complexes, formed during a 
continental collision.  As in the rest of the Caledonides, the bedrock of this region is 
therefore structurally complex, with a significant amount of large-scale folding and faulting.  
Brittle structures have the potential to be highly transmissive and it is the nature and 
distribution of local and regional brittle structures that is likely to be the dominant 
controlling factor for groundwater flow in the area.  The basement rock is overlain by a 
generally thin (generally <5 m but <20 m in some isolated locations) cover of overburden 
sediments.  The permeability of these sediments is likely to be variable, but they are unlikely 
to be significant in terms of groundwater inflows to mining operations due to their limited 
thickness.  Hydraulic properties of the overburden and bedrock formations will require 
further investigation at the next stage of investigation including structural interpretation, as 
discussed in below.

Some initial surface water catchment analysis has been undertaken by the Company as part 
of initial options studies for the location of the proposed TMF.  This study showed 
catchment areas for surface water courses in the vicinity of the proposed deposits to be 
generally small (<50 km2).  However, the steep topography and relatively impermeable 
basement in many areas may lead to rapid run-off during snow-melt or rainfall events 
leading to temporarily high (flashy) surface water flows. 

17.8.2 Pit water management 

The deposits at Rönnbäcken are adjacent to, or surrounded by in the case of 
Rönnbäcksnäset, Lake Gardiken which has formed behind the Gardiken hydro-electric 
power station dam, approximately 20 km to the east.  Furthermore, it is understood that all 
three proposed pits will progress below the level of the lake.  Thus the lake will provide a 
constant source of water for pit inflows (constant head boundary) should a permeable 
pathway exist between the pit and the lake.  Although the permeability of the unfractured 
rockmass surrounding the proposed pits is likely to be low, discrete fractures provide the 
potential for locally significant inflows to the pit, which could be sudden and impact on 
mining operations.   

The role of groundwater on pit slope stability is as yet unknown.   

Significant further investigation is therefore required in order to: 

 estimate groundwater inflows to the pits, including the potential for a hydraulic 
pathway between the lake and the pits, and to derive a cost effective solution for 
control of these inflows; and   

 evaluate potential pore water pressures in the pit slopes and the feasibility of any 
depressurisation required.   

Such an investigation would require structural analysis and interpretation as well as an 
investigative hydrogeological field programme, ideally including discrete interval testing 
such as double packer or spinner tests.  These structural and hydrogeological investigations 
would be best undertaken in tandem with the geotechnical field programme for reasons of 
cost effectiveness and data sharing.   

Site-specific climatological data will be required as the project progresses as the 
mountainous terrain may mean that some climatic variables differ between site and the 
nearest long-term weather station at Hemavan.  It is therefore recommendable that at least 
one weather station be installed on-site as soon as practically possible.  A surface water 
study will be required in order to evaluate surface water inflows to the pit and to size sump 
equipment and pit perimeter bunding or ditches.   

The bedrock aquifer may provide yields of groundwater sufficient to supply the mine's 
potable water supply demand, although this would require further investigation.

17.8.3 Mineral Processing 

The make-up water requirement is expected to be up to 500 m3/h.  Make-up water will be 
sourced from Lake Gardiken, the total storage capacity of which is 875 Mm3.  Abstraction 
of groundwater to meet water supply demand is not feasible due to the relatively low 
permeability of the bedrock.  Water supply is therefore more of a permitting issue than a 
technical issue.  However, a seasonal site water balance will be required in order to define 
accurately the make-up water requirement. 

17.8.4 Infrastructure 

Flood lines will need to be derived at the next stage of investigation to help with siting of 
mine infrastructure.  A stormwater drain system will need to be designed for surface water 
protection of infrastructure, especially asphalted areas and roads. 

Sediment control structures will need to be sized and located according to predicted 
discharge of site run-off. 

Seepage from waste dumps, tailings storage and any water retention dams will also need to 
be assessed. 

17.8.5 Environment 

Baseline monitoring of streamflows, lake levels and surface water quality will need to be 
commenced as the project moves to the next development phase.   

A network of groundwater monitoring boreholes for baseline monitoring of groundwater 
levels and quality will need to be installed.  As with the hydrogeological investigations, 
discussed in Section 17.8.1 above, this might be best done in conjunction with geotechnical 
drilling, if possible. 

The potential impacts of mining on groundwater and surface waters will be assessed upon 
completion of surface water and groundwater investigations discussed in Section 17.8.1 and 
in conjunction with baseline monitoring data.  For this reason, it is essential that baseline 
water monitoring be commenced well before any engineering feasibility study analysis is 
required.  

17.8.6 Risks and Opportunities 

No site specific data relating to the water environment has been collected to date.  A high 
degree of uncertainty therefore surrounds water management requirements and risk at 
present.  This applies especially to the risk of significant hydraulic connection between the 
proposed pits and Lake Gardiken. Therefore potential costs for water management, 
particularly dewatering of the pits, may be significantly underestimated.

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

Further hydrological investigation will be required at the next stage of investigation to 
define: 

 pit inflows from groundwater and surface water; 

 piezometric surfaces in the pit slopes and optimised solutions for reduction of slope 
pore water pressures if required; 

 surface water protection and management requirements for mine infrastructure i.e. 
diversions, bunds, culverts, settling ponds etc.; 

 seasonal site water balance; 

 seepage from waste dumps and tailings storage facility including environmental 
impact assessment; and 

 recovery of water levels after mine closure. 

Recording of groundwater strikes and other anecdotal drilling information during initial 
resource drilling can provide useful data for initial desk-based groundwater studies.  This 
will allow the development of a more targeted groundwater investigation programme, thus 
saving costs in the long-run.  Some significant cost savings might also be derived from the 
development of an integrated hydrogeological and geotechnical field campaign.  

17.9 Environmental Management 

17.9.1 Introduction 

This section highlights the key issues identified in the Environmental Assessment reports 
(Miljökonsekvensbeskrivning, MKB) for Rönnbäcksnäset and Vinberget and the draft 
version of the Sundsberget MKB, which was made available to SRK.  

SRK's comments on the status of these issues is given along with an indication of whether 
any of the issues are considered material to the project and how the issues are being 
managed. 

17.9.2 Swedish regulatory requirements 

The following regulatory requirements apply before mining operations can be started in 
Sweden. 

Exploration Permits: Under the Minerals Act (1991:45) exploration licenses are issued by 
the Mining Inspectorate of Sweden (in Swedish: Bergsstaten), giving the holder a 
preferential right to an exploitation concession for the area and minerals covered by the 
exploration permit at a later stage. An exploration permit furthermore secures the holder 
access to land for exploration work that does not damage the environment or the land use. 

Exploitation Concessions: Exploitation of a property for concession minerals requires an 
exploitation concession under the Minerals Act, which is issued by the Mining Inspectorate 
of Sweden. An exploitation concession is granted if there is a probability for economic 
exploitation of the deposit and if the site is considered appropriate from a mining and 
environmental point of view. The latter requirement calls for an Environmental Impact 



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 176 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

Assessment (EIA) to be included in the application, and if relevant also an assessment on the 
impact on reindeer herding. An exploitation concession normally secures the holder the right 
to carry out mineral exploitation for a 25 year period. A decision by the Mining Inspectorate 
upon a concession application may be appealed to the Government. 

Environmental Permits: In addition to an exploitation concession, mining activities require 
an environmental permit under the Swedish Environmental Code (1998:808, in Swedish: 
Miljöbalken), which is issued by the Environmental Court (in Swedish: Miljödomstolen). 
The permit will define the conditions for the design, building, operation and closure of a 
mining installation. The permit application must be supported by a comprehensive EIA, 
which includes formal consultations with stakeholders. Decisions by the Environmental 
Court may (with leave to appeal) be appealed to the Environmental Court of Appeal and 
further to the Supreme Court. Construction activities within water areas (such as tailings 
dam, clarification pond), requires special considerations in the application for an 
environmental permit. One such consideration is the right of disposition of the water, which 
the Company must have before the application is submitted. Right of disposition of the 
water is normally obtained by acquisition of the land where the water works will take place 
or through an easement granted either by the landowner or by an authority. 

In addition to the above mentioned permits, mining activities require an agreement with the 
landowner(s) or a decision by the Mining Inspectorate regarding designation of land above 
ground to be used for the activities.  

A building permit is also needed under the terms of the Planning and Building Act 
(1987:10). The permit is issued by the local authority. 

The process of permitting a mining operation in Sweden is graphically illustrated in Figure 
125 below.

17.9.3 Permit Status for the Rönnbäcken Nickel Project 

Key milestones concerning the Project deposits include: 

 Full biophysical, physical, socio-economic baseline commenced in summer 2009 and 
are ongoing. 

 Exploitation concessions granted by the Mines Inspector (Bergsstaten) for the

 The Project presupposes the construction of a tailings dam including clarification 
pond, and access road banks within a natural water area. To carry out such activities 

within water areas requires a "water permit" in accordance with the Environmental 

code. The required right to apply remains to be secured by acquiring the area in 

question from the landowner or to receive an easement to the area from the 

Landowner.

17.9.4 Baseline Studies 

Baseline studies are a series of surveys and studies to categorise the biophysical, 
infrastructure, social, socio-economic, and economic condition of an area prior the 
implementation of a proposed investment. This is to ensure all possible interactions of a 
project's activities can be properly assessed on pre-existing conditions. A critical result of 
the baseline studies is to identify key indicators which will be used in monitoring programs 
to assess the processes of change in spatial, economic, social and environmental conditions 
caused by the project. 

 

Baseline studies are a series of surveys and studies to categorise the biophysical, 
infrastructure, social, socio-economic and economic condition of an area prior to the 
implementation of a proposed investment. This is to enable the possible interactions of a 
project's activities can be properly assessed with respect to pre-existing conditions. A 
critical result of the baseline studies is to identify key indicators that will be used in future 
monitoring programs to assess the processes of change in spatial, economic, social and 
environmental conditions caused by the project. 

Baseline studies were implemented in 2009 and are ongoing, in anticipation of developing 
the environmental permit application, planned to be submitted to the Environmental Court in 
2012. 

Table 77 lists the baseline categories as defined by EU legislation and the corresponding 
categories under Swedish legislation, what categories were investigated for the Rönnbäcken 
Nickel Project and which consultancy performed the works. . Figure 126 illustrates the 
geographical extent of the studies carried out to date in the Project area.

17.9.5 Status of land and water access rights 

Whilst land and water rights are not an issue at this stage of the Project, it is critical to 
obtaining approval to mine to demonstrate confirmation of right of access to water and land.  
Water rights for those areas directly impacted by drawdown of water from the pits must be 
obtained prior to submission of the environmental permit application, whilst land access 
rights must be obtained before construction commences. 

 

 



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 181 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

Demonstration of the right to water directly impacted by drawdown is required as a 
prerequisite for submittal of the environmental permit application to the Environmental 
Court. Demonstration of the land access agreements for all lands required for a project, 
including land within the exploitation concession and land required for project infrastructure 
if outside the exploitation concession is required before a permit can be validated. 

As such, it is planned that water rights will be in place in advance of submitting the 
application for permit to mine in 2012. 

17.9.6 Opposing Interests and Zero Alternative 

A key part of assessing the impacts of a project is to consider other activities which could or 
would otherwise take place and the 'Zero Alternative', that is, should the project not go 
ahead. 

Should the project not go ahead, all key biophysical, social and economic indicators will 
remain the same including maintaining the same trends. That is;  

 the biophysical baseline condition will remain unchanged; 

 reindeer herding will continue without externally driven change (to their grazing 
area); 

 the risk to water resources and water catchment area will continue as it is today; 

 social and recreational use of the area shall continue (berry and mushroom picking,  
snowmobile use, hunting) 

 no significant alternative economic activity will be established; 

 the economic and demographic decline of the area shall continue; 

 the creation of new employment opportunities and (significant) contribution to the 
local economy shall not take place. 

For the Project location, the following opposing interests have been identified and are listed 
below, together with comments on the nature of impacts and possible strategies to resolve 
conflicting issues: 

 Reindeer husbandry and Sami culture - A discussion is presented in Section 18.7.8. 

 Hydro-power industry – an intrest to cooperate as the project develops. 

 Permanent and temporary residences – full impacts not yet fully understood. Options 
remain open as how best to compensate such stakeholders. 

 Hunting and fishing – compensation to be offered to those directly impacted. 

 Nature values – the project footprint impacts on some areas of High Nature Values, 
Class 1, which may be eligible for protective status, and Class 2, which may have Red 
Listed Species present, see Figure 127. 

 Cultural values – no major values directly impacted by the Project;noise from 
operations may cause an indirect impact on part of the heritage value area. 

 Outdoor recreational activities – some loss of recreational opportunity will result.

17.9.7 Socio-Economic Benefits 

The following socio-economic benefits are expected to arise from the execution of the 
project:  

 new employment will be created directly at the mine (direct employment); 

 new employment will be created in the local economy (indirect employment); 

 local economic activity will increase; 

 taxes and other revenue for the public sector will increase; 

 infrastructure such as roads and energy supply infrastructure will be improved; 

 municipal services such as education, health care and other public services will 
improve; 

 there will be improved international exposure of the region for other investors, 
including other mining companies; 

 demographic and other social parameters will improve through the movement of 
workers and their families into the area; 



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 183 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

 the availability of goods, services and operations in the region will improve; and 

 tourism will long term (post mining) benefit from improved and increased housing 
and infrastructure in tourist centres Hemavan and Tärnaby.  

According to the MKB, the impact of the operations on the social economy has been 
assessed to be positive. The population and the labour market have demonstrated a steep 
downward trend during recent decades. The Company has assumed that the planned 
operations will result in approximately 250 to 300 direct employment opportunities at full 
production and including contractors and sub-contractors. Additional indirect employment 
opportunities will be created via subcontractors and service industries in the surrounding 
communities. This in turn will lead to increased local economic activity and increased taxes 
and revenue for the public sector. 

It is expected that improved infrastructure and demand for social services will also result 
from the establishment of the mine, and in turn will lead to increased interest from regional 
and/or international investors or various types. The establishment of the mine may result in 
an overall improvement in the population trend through employees and their families 
moving to the region. 

17.9.8 Key environmental and social issues 

The key environmental and social issues identified through a review of the Project MKB's 
and other available data are summarized below with the exception of mine closure and 
rehabilitation, which is discussed in Section 17.10.  SRK's review of available 
documentation has not identified any further issues likely to be material to the project. 

Water 

The Project is not expected to lead to any reduction in the water quality of the area, due to 
integrating water protection measures in project design, such as diversion dikes, collection 
ditches, all runoff water within the mine and pits areas and any infiltration water into the pits 
being collected and pumped to the clarification pond, effectively preventing any potentially 
contaminated water from leaving the site.  

The Rönnbäcken river, southeast of the Rönnbäcksnäset deposit is an important trout 
breeding river and as such will not be impacted and will retain its functionality. However, 
due to the presence of the TMF Rönnbäcken will need to be extended with a new outlet into 
Atjiken. 

The placement of the TMF in Gorkotjärn-Stenträsk, which is a part of Gardiken reservoir 
reduces water storing capacity of the reservoir by some 4-5% (estimated at some 40 Mm3), 
resulting in a limited loss of revenue from hydro-power production. This loss of revenue is 
due to the reduced ability to keep water volume from summertime to wintertime, with a 
limited loss of power value (SEK 3M annually) for the producer as power in wintertime is 
priced higher than in summertime. However, the overall annual power production is not 
expected to be reduced. The Company have assumed a capital cost estimate of SEK 58M to 
compensate the hydro-power company for loss of capacity in the Gardiken reservoir. After 
decommissioning of the operations, however, it may be possible to return up to 30Mm3 of 
water storing capacity to the reservoir by connecting it to the water-filled open pits.  



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 184 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

The placement of the TMF also results in the loss of bottom fauna and fish habitat. 
However, Gardiken is classified as a heavily modified water body under the EUs Water 
Framework Directive, with annual water level amplitude of some 20m. This means that the 
banks of the lake presents significant challenges for the natural bio-diversity to establish, 
notably bottom fauna.  

The three pits and waste rock management facilities cause some loss of water catchment 
area with a corresponding loss of direct water runoff into Gardiken, which however is fully 
compensated by increased flows via other routes. Runoff from the waste rock management 
facilities and precipitation in the pits, along with groundwater infiltration, will be directed to 
the clarification pond for use in process plant. 

Groundwater drawdown around the pits is estimated to extend some 50 m, although along 
fracture zones it may extend further. Sealing of such fracture zones by cement injection may 
be necessary and would limit such drawdown. Given the low pressure gradient and low 
hydraulic conductivity, impacts to groundwater are judged to be little. 

Landscape 

The operations will lead to significant changes to the existing landscape. Pit lakes and new 
topographic highs from the waste rock and tailings storage facilities will remain once 
operations cease. These need not be negative impacts, especially as acid rock drainage 
potentials will be mitigated through design of the facilities including how they are closed. 
With capping and re-vegetation these new topographic highs may return value to local 
stakeholders by replicating the pre-existing vegetation.

Employment & economy 

As with many inland communities in the north of Sweden, Storuman Municipality has been 
experiencing depopulation over recent decades. This trend shows no sign of abating. Quality 
of life through rewarding employment opportunities is one of the key reasons for this trend. 



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 185 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

The Project may halt or even partially reverse this trend through the employment creation 
when the operations are in full production. 

This provides the Municipality of Storuman some 20 years to develop the business and 
commercial sectors and to diversify the economy, using the Project as an economic driver. 

Reindeer husbandry 

Rönnbäcken is located in an area which includes prime land for Vapstens reindeer 
husbandry all-year round. An impact assessment including limited social aspects was made 
in cooperation with Vapsten Sameby to better understand potential impacts and to identify 
potential mitigation measures. A key concern is whether the project will irreversibly impact 
on Vapsten Sameby's ability to continue reindeer husbandry practices in the future. Because 
of this Vapsten Sameby has objected to and is opposed to the establishment of the Project. 

Parts of the Project area are classified as a 'Core Area' of National Interest for Reindeer 
Husbandry. A reindeer migration route passes Rönnbäcken, utilised twice per year. 
Consequently the Project may result in: 

 reduced grazing land, including increased risk for predation due to reindeer being 
concentrated on a smaller grazing area; 

 impact to the migration route; 

 disturbance to reindeer through project activities; 

 likely increase in man-hours to compensate for the changes to husbandry patterns; 

 increased risk of traffic accidents involving reindeer; 

 increased need for supplementary feed. 

Potential mitigation measures identified included: 

 creating a specific communication channel created between the Company and 
Vapsten Sameby; 

 knowledge sharing such that Company employees understand the specifics of reindeer 
husbandry how their work may impact upon it and for the Sameby members to learn 
about the proposed mining operations to better aid planning reindeer husbandry 
activities in the area; 

 localisation and design of project infrastructure to reduce as much as feasible 
intrusion into grazing and migratory lands, and to integrate project infrastructure with 
the natural environment; 

 construction of fences to prevent reindeer, in particular those unmarked, moving into 
neighbouring Samebyar; 

 construction of a new migratory path around Rönnbäcken; 

 protection and care of valuable lichen areas where in proximity to project 
infrastructure; 

 timing of project activities to take into consideration particularly sensitive periods for 
reindeer husbandry; 



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 186 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

 support for any additional labour or other resources required as a consequence of the 
project; and 

 a rehabilitation and revegetation plan such that post-closure the Sameby can continue 
reindeer husbandry across the area. 

The Company intends to continue the dialogue with the Vapsten Sameby to further refine 
mitigation measures with a view to ensure reindeer husbandry can continue effectively at the 
same time as mining operations take place. 

The majority of impacts occur during construction when site preparation takes place and 
infrastructure, roads and transport corridors are built. This largely includes land clearance 
which has a profound impact on local biodiversity, and will cause change to the currently 
quiet and peaceful nature of the area.  

During operations, sustained activities, such as heavy vehicle transport, blasting, excavation, 
transport and crushing of ore, deposition of waste rock and tailings, leads to a consistent 
level of impact including noise, dust, vibration, blast waves and regulated discharges to 
water and air and unregulated discharges to soil. These cause impacts based on intensity, 
frequency, duration and consequence of the activity.  

For Rönnbäcknäset, Vinberget and Sundsberget such impacts can be mitigated or reduced to 
acceptable levels. 

A small number of permanent and temporary residences and properties will need to be 
acquired purchased to mitigate any risk to people and/or property from blasting and mining 
activities.  

Following cessation of mining activities, most impact cease and conditions will gradually 
return to the prior to Project circumstances. However, there will be residual impacts in the 
form of pits lakes and topographic highs formed by the waste rock storage facilities and 
tailings storage facility. 

17.9.9 Conclusion 

Impacts to the natural environment in the vicinity of the planned project occur mostly during 
construction, continuing to a lesser extent through operations. Once the mines closed and are 
rehabilitated, impacts largely cease. 

Rönnbäcknäset, Vinberget and Sundsberget are all located in the same geographic, geo-
political and biophysical area. By and large, they have the same type of topography, 
biodiversity, fall under the governmental jurisdiction from a National to Municipal level, 
and have very similar to identical social aspects. 

The population density is low and aged. Hydro-power generation and forestry are the most 
important economic sector active in the area. 

There are no areas afforded protected status. Species with vulnerable, near-threatened and 
threatened status are found in the region. Otters have not been reported. 



SRK Consulting 
Rönnbäcken PEA Page 187 

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

The environmental impacts of the proposed project are not deemed significant and a range 
of measures are available to mitigate and/or reduce such impacts. Following cessation of 
operations, the area is expected to return to a prior-to-intervention state except for the 
presence of pit lakes and new topographic highs from the waste storage facilities and tailings 
storage facility, which shall be rehabilitated with vegetation. 

The Project area includes areas of national interest for three purposes: Reindeer husbandry, 
valuable deposits for mineral supply, and outdoor activities. The Project area also 
approaches an area of national interest for cultural heritage values. . 

The Company's activities, in particular land take, will impact these areas, except for 
valuable mineral deposits, for which the Project will contribute. Regarding the reindeer 
herding, such compensation measures will be negotiated with the Vapsten Sameby 
(Reindeer Village). 

Social and economic impacts are largely positive particularly through new job creation, 
increased economy of the region and increased tax revenue to local authorities. Potential 
negative impacts stem from the having to relocate a number of dwellings in the area due to 
risk from blasting and other mining activities. Increased transport on roads, safety and 
disturbances from mining activities are other social impacts. 

SRK Recommendations 

The most significant recommendation is that the social, environmental and economic aspects 
of the project are continued to be assessed as the project development plan matures. This 
assessment should include all parts of the project, including the mines, process plant, waste 
streams, on- and off-site transport, etc. Feedback from any significant socio-economic and 
environmental issues identified incorporated into the design process. This includes the 
results of proactive, voluntary and formal stakeholder consultation. 

Other, more specific recommendations are that the Company should: 

 perform detailed impact assessment against a final project description (project freeze) 
per mine and collectively; 

 assess the cumulative impacts of project aspects and with other projects in the area; 

 review and test key project aspects, such as water balance, blasting, noise dust and 
vibration, 

 detailed modelling of the water balance including how groundwater and surface water 
flow will be influenced by the project, detailed models of possible dispersion halos 
around the waste rock and tailings storage facilities, 

 detailed modelling of airborne particulate matter transport. 

 perform a micro- and macro-economic benefits assessment for the project as a whole; 

 perform dedicated social impact assessment, focussing on local and regional impacts; 

 design project wide environmental monitoring program including costing for water, 
air and climate, biodiversity; and

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

 design social impact and community liaison monitoring programmes for reindeer 
herding, community development and social cohesion in cooperation with relevant 
authorities. 

17.10 Mine Closure 

Implementation of the EU Directive relating to wastes from extractive industries (Directive 
2006/21/EC) into Swedish law has resulted in the requirement for mine operators to submit 
a preliminary plan for closure with the environmental permit application (Section 17.9.2).  
This closure plan and the associated costs will be approved by the Environmental Court.  
The operator must then make provision for a financial guarantee to cover the reclamation 
costs should it not be able to fulfil its duties.  The guarantee is required for the actual area of 
land affected and as such is linked in part to the LoM schedule.  During operation, the actual 
disturbance will be reported to the authorities and the increase in the closure provision will 
be determined accordingly.  If progressive rehabilitation is undertaken, the cost for this can 
be withdrawn from the bond upon acceptance by the regulatory authority appointed by the 
Environmental Court.  The closure costs and associated bond will be reviewed when the 
closure plan is reviewed, at least once every three years. 

For the purposes of the MKB supporting the Project mine permit application, there is no 
requirement to present a closure plan in any detail. As a consequence, the level of closure 
planning available for review by SRK is limited.  

WRD Closure 

Closure of the WRD will require stable slopes for the long term. It is often the practice to 
slope the dumps to the slope required for post-closure. It also enables progressive 
reclamation of the dumps as deposition is completed over portions of the dumps. Slope of 
3H:1V are often adopted for final slopes for WRD. 

The estimated closure cost has not been detailed in the documents reviewed by SRK. It is 
however stated that covering the WRD fully with a soil cover would have an excessive cost 
and this has consequently been rejected by the Company as an option. The proposed 
approach is limited to a discussion of optional concepts. It is important that the closure of 
the WRD be detailed in future studies for detailed costing.  

TMF Closure 

The details for the proposed closure of the TMF are limited to very broad concepts that 
could require considerable efforts and/or involve long term involvement. The closure plan 
should be developed using proven technologies and methods as it would facilitate the 
permitting process and improve the level of confidence in the cost estimates. 

Summary 

Despite a lack of closure planning detail available for review, SRK considers that the cost 
estimates proposed by the Company are of the correct order of magnitude. Technical and 
cost assumptions supporting the closure plan should be refined during the next level of 
study. Table 78 below lists the closure costs by area.

The Company intends to market the Rönnbäcken concentrate to nickel smelters globally. To 
place this in context, a brief overview of the nickel sulphide concentrate markets follows.

The dominant source of nickel throughout the last century has been sulphide concentrates, 
from sources such as Vale's (formerly Inco) operations in the well-known Sudbury Basin 
and at Thompson, Manitoba, from Xstrata`s (formerly Falconbridge) Sudbury operations, 
and from Norilsk's huge complex in Siberia and its other sites in the Kola peninsula of 
northwestern Russia. The Finnish operation, Outokumpu (now Norilsk-owned), brought 
additional mining, smelting and refining capacity on-stream, as did Western Mining 
Corporation (WMC), now BHP Billiton's Nickel West, at its Kalgoorlie smelter and 
Freemantle refinery.  In China, Jinchuan has steadily increased capacity through phased 
expansions, as has Jilin. Notably, all of these operations were originally integrated; sourcing 
nickel from their own mine operations. However, all of these are now mature operations 
suffering from declining mine resources and grades, difficult or expensive mine expansion, 
and increasing costs; the latter is especially true of western operations such as those in 
Canada. In order to minimise unit costs and maximise both plant capacity utilisation and 
extra revenue generation, these operations have, for a number of years, sought outside 
sources of concentrates to smelt and refine. An additional part of the costs saving realized 
through treatment of third party concentrates comes from deferral of investment in new 
mine exploration/discovery and development, and the corresponding avoidance of 
associated risk, all of which can be very significant, especially in fluctuating metal markets. 

The growth of world nickel demand in the last decade, indeed of demand in all 
commodities, has been driven to a large extent by China, and to a lesser extent by India. 
Forecasts of supply-demand balances in the early to mid-2000s predicted a massive shortfall 
in supply. This resulted in the start-up of many small sulphide mining operations around the 
world, especially in Australia. Most of these were too small to support smelting and refining 
facilities on their own. However, a natural synergy between these new, small sources of 
nickel, and the underutilisation of capacity at existing sulphide smelters/refiners was quickly 
recognised. The result has been the growth of trade in the sale of nickel concentrates from a 
relatively small portion of world nickel supply (less than 5%) to an estimated 15% of 
currently nickel supply. The nett effect is that currently, there exists a very real, competitive 
marketplace for the sale of nickel concentrates produced from smaller operations. 

The other type of ore from which nickel is produced is lateritic, or oxide (non-sulphide) 
ores. They are treated either by hydrometallurgical processes ( Murrin-Murrin, Goro) or via 
reducing pyrometallurgical techniques (Koniambo), depending on the specific type of 
laterite ore sourced. To date these resources have proved difficult to exploit with numerous 
technical problems resulting in higher capital and operating costs than originally envisaged.  
Relatively high nickel prices will probably be required to to support these projects in the 
long term.  Despite this, as sulphide resources continue to decline, it is likely that these types 
of ores will be a significant source of future nickel production. Sulphide operations, whether 
integrated or not, will benefit from this situation.  They have the advantages of long 
established smelting/refining operations which have little requirement for new capital, and 
very low technical risk.  In summary, they will continue to have available capacity for third 
party concentrates and hence will be able to take advantage of the higher metal prices.   As 
such, small nickel sulphide concentrate producers, selling to existing smelters/refiners will 
have an excellent opportunity in the current and future marketplace for supplying 
concentrates to integrated operations facing declining supply from captive sources.

Figure 130: Growing gap in nickel concentrate supply 
 

A key part of the synergy between independent concentrate producers and smelter/refiners is 
defined in the smelting-refining marketing contracts that exist between these parties. First, 
unlike the copper concentrate market, there is no standard form or structure of contract, and 
there is no transparent marketplace. The contract terms are negotiated individually and tend 
to be confidential. There are differences between the capabilities of each smelter and each 
refinery which may be reflected in the terms offered. These differences may show up in the 
percentage of payable metal (Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Ag or PGM) the smelter/refiner is prepared to 
pay for. The grade of the concentrate will be important for more than just the obvious 
calculation of gross metal value. The level of minor elements such as As, Hg, Sb, F and Cl 
can affect the smelter/ refiner's ability to safely handle the material. Levels of MgO in the 
range of 4% - 8% are likely to trigger extra costs at the smelter; these may be passed back to 
the concentrate supplier. Blending a concentrate, containing higher than normal levels of 
impurities, with other concentrates typically reduces any processing problems, allowing for 
treatment. Use of removal systems, as for mercury, can facilitate successful treatment. 
However, there may be thresholds for these or other elements, above which a smelter may 
not be prepared to accept. A marketing contract needs to recognise all of these issues and 
outline how they will be dealt with, especially during the start-up period when quality 
control of the final concentrateis likely to be less stable. Contracts can be relatively simple, 
or quite complicated. The format will affect the level of risk and return to each of the two 
parties as prices vary over time. Some contracts provide for price participation wherein the 
smelter/refiner receives a share of the higher returns at higher metal prices. Most contracts 
are for life of mine, but others have an expiration date. While the latter allows for a better 
reflection of changing markets over time, it creates an unpredictable risk for each party. 
Other items, such as transport of concentrate from the concentrator to the smelter may 
absorb a significant portion of the metal value of the concentrate, especially at low prices 
and/or with low payable metal grades. On the other hand, some contracts provide a transport 
credit to the supplier. As a general rule, risk (such as price risk) is passed on to the 
concentrate supplier, who needs to ensure his operation`s viability during periods of low 
metal prices. The flexible format of contracts allows for tailoring each contract to the needs 
of both parties and the particular analysis of the concentrate. Ultimately, the result is one of 
informed negotiation. While the lack of transparency in nickel concentrate markets may be 
disconcerting, a body of knowledge has developed over the years within the industry which 
ensures a fair and competitive result.

The market for custom concentrates is comprised of the following traditional, established 
smelter/refiners of Vale (Sudbury, Canada), Xstrata (Falconbridge, Canada), and Norilsk 
(Harjavalta, Finland), and the more recent participants of Jinchuan (China), Votorantim 
(Fortaleza, Brazil) and Jilin (China). Vale has announced the future shutdown of smelting at 
Thompson, Manitoba, thus removing one potential smelter from the list. It is likely that Vale 
will use their new hydrometallurgical facility at Argentia, Newfoundland, Canada, to 
process custom concentrates, thus replacing Thompson as a custom operation.  However 
little is known about the requirements or limits in terms of quantity and quality of third party 
concentrate which Argentia will be prepared to handle. There is a reasonable understanding 
of the capabilities of the traditional smelter/refiners. Sulphide smelting employs two basic 
processes, flash smelting and roast/reduction. It is likely that with either process, blending of 
Rönnbäcken concentrate will be required in order to handle its low natural fuel level (low 
Fe, S), high MgO level, and possibly to reduce As, Sb or Hg levels. Flash smelters may be 
less sensitive to As than roast-reduction smelters (Xstrata). The volume and nature of the 
other concentrates being handled by a smelter at a given time will affect the extent to which 
blending of Rönnbäcken, or other adjustments to processing, will be necessary. Note that the 
accuracy and applicability of these comments, and those following, are heavily influenced 
by the current and forecast concentrate supply-demand situation (quantity and quality) at 
each smelter/refiner, a situation which is in a constant state of change.  

With the pending shutdown of Vale's Thompson operation, only Xstrata's Falconbridge 
smelter will be using roast–reduction. This process provides excellent metal recoveries, 
particularly for cobalt, but has high power costs. It can recover all payable metals – Ni, Cu, 
Co, Au, Ag or PGM, subject to the usual minimum deductions, but it is sensitive to high 
MgO, and As. The smelter is located just outside Sudbury, Ontario, requiring rail (or road) 
transport from a port such as Quebec City or Montreal, Quebec. The facility has a well-
established group experienced in receiving, sampling, handling, blending and smelting 
custom concentrates along with their own captive concentrates, which operates under a 
business philosophy of including the treatment of custom materials. It is estimated that 
Xstrata would seek about 15 ktpa contained nickel from custom sources under long-term 
contracts (this encompasses most if not all of the Rönnbäcken production). 

Vale`s Sudbury smelter is also experienced in all aspects of custom concentrate treatment. It 
uses its own proprietary flash smelting process requiring oxygen, generated on-site. Ni, Cu 
and Au, Ag or PGM recoveries are competitive, but cobalt recoveries are lower than most of 
the other facilities. As for the Xstrata smelter, labour costs are high. Despite this, and the 
600 km inland transport from Quebec City (the smelter is located just on the opposite side of 
Sudbury from the Falconbridge smelter), Vale has, in the past, succeeded in acquiring 
custom concentrates against competition from Xstrata and Norilsk (Harjavalta). Custom 
concentrates have allowed deferral of capital investment in Vale`s Sudbury mines - capital 
which is now being put back into those mines. With this investment, but with Voisey`s Bay 
concentrates being sent to Argentia by 2013 and Thompson concentrate being sent to 
Sudbury, the future nett demand for custom concentrate at Vale's Sudbury smelter needs to 
be determined.

In Newfoundland, Vale is constructing a hydro-metallurgical facility with a capacity of 
60,000 tpa Ni, to treat concentrate from Voisey's Bay. The Rönnbäcken concentrate, with its 
high nickel grade compared to that of the Voisey's Bay concentrate, and low PGM content, 
would make an attractive alternative feed at Argentia, as hydrometallurgical processing does 
not have the capability to refine PGM.  The facility would, however, need to be modified to 
accommodate concentrates with higher impurity levels, including MgO. 

The Norilsk smelter at Harjavalta has been treating third party custom concentrates longer 
than all others, and is well equipped to do so. Having no nearby captive ore sources, it is 
effectively a fully custom smelter. It uses the Outokumpu double flash furnace for both 
smelting and converting (the DON process). It employs a slag cleaning unit to improve 
metal recoveries, especially that of cobalt. Very competitive for Ni and Co, the smelter is 
less so for Cu and Au, Ag or PGM`s. However, it is close to port facilites, and is the closest 
smelter to Rönnbäcken, advantageous in terms of transportation costs and work-in-process 
inventory considerations.  

The Fortaleza smelter in Brazil treats concentrate from Mirabela's new Santa Rita mine. 
Fortaleza uses the Outokumpu DON process, with the mattes shipped to and refined at 
Harjavalta.  There is potential to provide additional concentrate to make up any shortfall. 
Moreover, Mirabela is studying the possibility of constructing a smelter to treat its own 
concentrates, rather than shippin to third parties.  The smelter is limited in its capacity to 
accept higher MgO levels. Fortaleza`s total concentrate capacity is limited, and without the 
new smelter, could treat only part of Rönnbäcken's output.  

China offers a good potential for off-take as a number of nickel concentrates from Australia 
and Spain are currently smelted there.  The major nickel producer, Jinchuan, operates three 
smelters in China.  At its largest smelting facility in Gansu, Jinchuan has capability of 
processing 350,000 tpa concentrate using a modified WMC smelter design, which itself was 
based on the early Outokumpu flash process. Metal recovery capability is competitive. 
Jinchuan has offered terms which have been very favourable to the supplier at times and has 
successfully sourced feed globally from third parties in Australia, Spain and Zambia. It has 
publicly stated that it will expand its smelting/refining capacity to meet China's needs, but 
cannot source adequate nickel supplies in China, thus suggesting it might wish to absorb all 
of the output of an external supplier such as Rönnbäcken.  Jinchuan's facilities have the 

capability to take MgO-bearing feeds. 

Jilin has recently doubled the capacity of its Ausmelt smelter with capacity of 200,000 tpa of 
concentrates to produce 15,000 tpa of nickel in nickel-copper matte.  Some capacity for third 
party feeds may thus exist. 

The grade of Rönnbäcken concentrate needs discussion in light of the smelting/refining 
processors in the marketplace. The likely need for blending has already been mentioned. 
Most striking is the high nickel content at 28%. This ranks the concentrate grade as one of 
the highest available in the nickel business, captive or custom (Figure 131).

Rönnbäcken PEA Page 194

Figure 131: Comparison of nickel grade in nickel concentrates 

Secondly, with a relatively low Fe content at 9-10%, the Ni/Fe ratio is very high. In the 
smelting process the iron (Fe) creates slag which causes nickel losses. However, with a low 
Fe content, the slag quantities and hence nickel (and cobalt) losses should also be very low. 
This indicates that Rönnbäcken concentrate should realise the highest possible nickel 
accountabilities, at least 93%.  Cobalt accountabilities should also be very good. The high 
grade, of course, also helps reduce the costs of transportation, handling and smelting on a 
unit cost basis ( USD/lb nickel).  The precious metal content, which, although low, may be 
sufficient to attract some accountability and revenue, particularly at higher prices. 
Considering the structure of typical custom concentrate contracts, the high grades indicate 
that this concentrate should be able to carry costs and charges over the whole range of 
foreseeable prices, and be able to survive the price lows while generating excellent returns 
to both parties at higher prices. The extent to which the grade advantage is offset by the need 
to blend or handle penalty elements must be determined through discussion and negotiation 
with each potential smelter/refiner.  

The planned production rate should provide Rönnbäcken with some flexibility in 
negotiations and help in attracting competitive terms. Each of the four larger smelter/refiners 
has the capacity to handle all the production. However, as a hedge against strikes or other 
disruptions to production, Rönnbäcken could, for example, split the tonnage between two or 
more smelters.  The split volume would still be sufficient to be attractive to a 
smelter/refiner. 

In summary, a significant market has developed over the last 20 years for custom 
concentrates, one which is forecast to grow. Annual volumes of 25 kt nickel contained are 
near ideal quantities with which to engage in this market. High grades allow a concentrate 
supplier to better carry extra costs of processing, if any, such as for penalty elements, while 
surviving periods of low prices. Returns to the supplier of the concentrate are subject to 
confirmation through final and binding negotiation with the smelter/refiners.  With its very

high grade and near ideal tonnage, Rönnbäcken concentrate should be very competitive in 
the custom concentrate marketplace. 

17.12 Concentrate transport 

During operation, nickel concentrate production is expected to average around 90 ktpa. In 
accordance with currently regulations, a 40 t payload is assumed, which implies between 6 
and 8 round-trips per day. 

The concentrate is intended to be shipped in bulk to international customers. The location of 
smelters sourcing custom concentrates is illustrated in Figure 132. 

 

Figure 132: The locations of smelters sourcing custom concentrates 

 
The Project site is located some 31 km away from highway E12 via public gravel roads to 
the north and 14 km via public gravel roads to the south. Highway E12 provides good access 
to the Port of Mo i Rana and Mosjoen in Norway at the Atlantic coast, and the Swedish 
ports of Umeå and Skelleftehamn on the Gulf of Bothnia. The distance from site to the port 
at Mo i Rana is 166 km and Umeå and Skelleftehamn ports are 355 km and 347 km 
respectively. These ports support year round shipping. 

With export shipments likely to international customers, Mo i Rana is the most favourable 
port. Mo i Rana has experience from bulk export, although mainly iron concentrates, and 
can allow up to 80,000 t vessels.  An indicative loading cost of USD5/t has been used, which 
is in line with other, similar, projects.  

Indicative bids for the land transport from Rönnbäcken to Mo i Rana have been received 
from four sources ranging between SEK150 and SEK175/t. These cost indications are based 
on a payload of 40 t/truck. The governing regulations stipulate a maximum weight of 60 t 
and length 25.25 m.

A second alternative for bulk export is to use the port at Mosjoen, close to Mo i Rana, where 
the authorities are expanding the existing port as well as building a new port for industrial 
purposes, including mineral handling. 

Both these two ports are well located, especially if the proposed railway between Umeå and 
Mo i Rana becomes a reality sometime in the future.  

Regarding sea freight costs there are different patterns for nickel concentrates and iron 
concentrates. In Europe, nickel concentrates are traditionally sold on a CIF basis while iron 
concentrates are sold on an FOB basis. The implication is that for nickel concentrates the 
seller has to absorb the sea freight costs . 

For Rönnbäcken an average sea freight cost of USD44/t has been applied. 

17.13 Preliminary Project Schedule 

A preliminary Project development schedule has been developed by the Company and 
suggests that production is expected to begin during Q2 2016 (Figure 133). 

 

Figure 133: Preliminary Project Development Schedule, developed by the 
Company 

 
This schedule assumes that the environmental permit application will be submitted during 
Q3 2012 upon completion of the Pre-Feasibility Study, and that approval will take 7 
quarters.  The Feasibility Study will be conducted during this time, completing a significant 
amount of detailed engineering and initiating procurement for long lead items such as mills, 
crushers and transformers. Thereafter and subject to approval of all the necessary permitting, 
the Company expect construction to commence in Q2 2014 and to last for approximately 
two years. 

SRK notes that achieving the construction timeframe will be dependent upon early ordering 
of long lead items and the delivery periods prevailing at that time. The development 
schedule will be re-assessed during the course of the Pre-Feasibility Study.

17.14 Economic Analysis 

17.14.1 Introduction 

SRK has constructed a TEM to derive a Net Present Value (NPV) for the Rönnbäcken 
Nickel Project. The TEM is based on the technical assumptions developed by both the 
Company and from work undertaken by SRK, as commented on in the previous sections of 
this report. The Company has provided SRK with the processing physical parameters, 
refining/smelting charges and various assumptions for operating and capital costs. SRK has 
reviewed these assumptions and has adjusted these where appropriate to reflect the views as 
presented in previous sections of this report.  
 
The economic analysis contained in this report is partially based on Inferred Mineral 
Resources, and is preliminary in nature. Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too 
geologically speculative to have mining and economic considerations applied to them and to 
be categorized as Mineral Reserves. There is no certainty that the reserves development, 
production, and economic forecasts on which this Preliminary Assessment is based will be 
realised. 

17.14.2 Valuation Process 

General Assumptions 

The model is based on production from three open pit mines (Rönnbäcksnäset, Vinberget 
and Sundsberget), feeding a single process stream with a maximum annual throughput of 
30Mtpa and housed within a single processing plant. The plant produces a nickel-cobalt 
flotation concentrate. Concentrates are transported from site to port via road. 

As part of the NI 43-101 process, SRK has constructed a pre-tax and pre-finance TEM and 
assumes: 

 the valuation currency is US Dollar (USD), with any Swedish Krona (SEK) or Euro 
(EUR) derived costs being converted at a SEK:USD exchange rate of 8:1 and 
USD:EUR exchange rate of 1.125:1; 

 a base case discount rate of 8%; 

 the TEM is in real 2011 terms and no nominal model is presented; 

 due to the uncertainty of when this project may be brought into production, the start 
of mining is assumed to be from 'Year 1' with two pre-production years ('Year -1' 

and 'Year -2') for the set up of basic mine infrastructure and access; 

 discounting of cashflows starts in year -2;  

 working capital based on 25% of the operating costs from the first year of production; 
and 

 sustaining capital based on approximately 2% of site asset value. 

The TEM considers the revenue and cost implications of recovered nickel and cobalt in a 
flotation concentrate.

Mining Physical Assumptions  

A summary of the combined mass movement of material from all three pits is presented in 
Table 80 below. A discussion of material movement by pit is presented in Section 17.1 
above. 

In order to maximise grade during the initial production years, marginal material from the 
Rönnbäcksnäset deposit has been stockpiled in the waste dump areas during the first six 
years of operation. The TEM assumes this material will be processed in the final three years 
of production.

Other Operating Costs 

Table 86 presents the total mineral royalty, G&A and total closure cost provision, including 
on-going rehabilitation. In addition, the Company has assumed an employment grant of 
USD8,250 per employee and per year for a total of three years at the start of operations. This 
amounts to a total revenue to the Project of USD3.4M and has been included in the TEM.

17.14.4 Capital costs 

Introduction 

The capital costs estimated by the Company have been review by SRK and adjusted where 
appropriate to reflect SRK's views. These costs total USD1548M. SRK notes the following: 

 contingencies of between 20% and 25% have been applied to capital cost associated 
with the process plant and infrastructure (roads, buildings and electrical); 

 capital costs have been profiled with roughly 75% of expenditure occurring in pre-
production years and the remaining 25% occurring in the first year of production; and 

 no capital costs have been assumed for mining equipment. 

Figure 136 illustrates a breakdown of the envisaged capital expenditure over the life of mine 
and split between the major cost centres. The total provision for sustaining capital over the 
LoM is USD280M.

17.14.5 Cash flow projections 

A valuation of the Project has been derived based on the application of Discounted Cash 
Flow (DCF) techniques to the pre-tax, pre-finance cash flow based on the inputs and 
assumptions presented in this and previous sections of this report. All figures are presented 
in real terms.  

In summary, at a Ni price of USD9/lb and an 8% discount rate the project has an NPV of 
USD316M for production of a nickel-cobalt concentrate. A summary of the results of the 
cash flow modelling and valuation are presented in Table 90 and Figure 137. A summary 
cashflow is presented in Table 91.

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

19.1 Risks and Opportunities 

In undertaking the technical and economic appraisal of the Project, certain risks and 
opportunities relating to the development of the project have been identified, the most 
material of which are commented on below. 

19.1.1 Risks 

There are a number of risks inherent to the mining industry, including the stability of the 
markets, uncertainties related to Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation, equipment 
and production performance. The specific risks SRK has identified relating to Rönnbacken 
are summarised below. 

 Deposition of tailings into an existing lake, the Gardiken hydroelectric reservoir, will 
involve technical challenges during design and construction of the tailings dam, given 
the seasonal oscillations of the lake water level. These lake level oscillations will also 
present challenges during operation and post closure, to ensure that any flushing of 
pore water within the permeable dam wall does not results in the transport of 
contaminants and excess suspended solids into the lake. Further, it is not clear at this 
stage how re-habilitation of the tailings area will be carried out and it is suspected by 
the Company that this may require new and innovative methods. 

 The edges of the Sundsberget and Rönnbäcksnäset open pits will lie close to the edge 
of the lake. Geotechnical and hydrogeological studies of the charater of the bedrock in 
these areas is at an early stage and hence water influx and effect on pit slope stability 
are as yet poorly understood. 

 The mine road between the Sundsberget pit and the process plant on Rönnbäcksnäset 
Island, will pass over the lake at a narrow point, where the rate of water through-flow 
is highest. The road will be constructed using a series of culverts, which will be 
required to withstand seasonal flooding. 

19.1.2 Opportunities 

SRK consider there to be specific opportunity to improve project economics as follows: 

 Technical, cost and marketing assumptions relating to the recovery of magnetite from 
the flotation tailings, concentration of this and possible conversion to a pellet product 
are at an early stage of development. Should the exsiting technical challenges be 
overcome, a magnetite product could markedly improve the economics of the Project. 
Certainly, this potential should be studied in the next phase of work. 

 Exploration drilling should be progressed to evaluate the potential that still exists 
within the existing exploration permit areas.  In addition, the Rönnbäcksnäset and 
Sundsberget deposits are open at depth. 

 Metallurgical performance could be improved to produce a higher grade Ni 
concentrate, which may attract improved terms including payability for precious 
metals and platinum group metals.

File Ref:  P:\SE355 Rönnbäcken PEA\Project\Final Report\SE355_Rönnbäcken PEA_final.docx  April 2011 

 As tailings design is at an early stage, optimisation could further reduce capital cost 
requirements. 

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Based on the review of available data and the results of the work carried out as part of this 
study, SRK recommends that work on the Project continue to pre-feasibility stage.  

Specifically, SRK offers the following recommendations: 

 Geophysical surveys to define optimal locations for geotechnical and hydrogeological 
drilling. 

 Hydrogeological drilling around the pit and around the project site generally to 
characterise hydrogeological regimes.  Data analysis and predictive modelling, where 
appropriate. 

 Geotechnical drilling to provide additional information for the mine rock mass 
models, to select locations for surface infrastructure and to characterise stability of pit 
walls and tailings dam locations. 

 Comminution drilling to provide large diameter core for comminution domaining 
characterisation, variability and autogenous grinding testwork. 

 Lab-scale metallurgical work to optimise nickel and magnetite byproduct flowsheet 
development for designated ore blends and to characterise variability across the 
resource, including mineralogy. 

 Further geometallurgical domaining of the resource, based on geochemistry, 
mineralogy and metallurgical testing to feed into mining and metallurgical planning 
activities. 

 Scheduling and sequencing of construction (tailings dams, pit dams, infrastructure) 
relative to the mine plan to confirm availability of mobile mining equipment, material 
quantity/quality and appropriate costing.

SRK understands that the Company propose to carry out a two phase programme of work in 
order to advance the Project through a pre-feasibility study. 

The Company has derived a budget for Phase 1 to be USD11.3M and contingent on this, to 
be followed by Phase 2 at an estimated cost of USD12.1M. The Company anticipates 
commencing Phase 1 in May 2011, with completion by late 2011. Subject to the results of 
Phase 1, Phase 2 is expected to start in late 2011, with completion by mid-2012.  

For the period between completion of Phase 2 and December 2012, the Company estimates 
overhead costs to be approximately USD950,000. 

A breakdown of these costs is presented in Table 94. SRK considers these costs and 
proposed timing of the study phases reasonable. 

Subject to the results of the pre-feasibility study, the Company expects to commence the 
technical work necessary to support a Feasibility study on the Project during 2012.  The 
Company has drafted a preliminary budget for this work, which is presented in Table 95 
below. Whilst this budget is at a high level and subject to amendment given the current stage 
of development of the Project, SRK considers this estimate to be of the correct order of 
magnitude for a Project of this nature and location.

Example Comparison of Analysis Methods 

It is important to note that for low grade sulphide deposits such as Rönnbäcken, the non-
sulphide nickel content can be significant.  For this reason the Company has elected to 
characterise both the total and sulphide nickel content, the latter by partial leach methods.  
For high volume, low grade assays the Labtium 240P method was selected (ammonium 
citrate and hydrogen peroxide in Figure below).  Please note the data shown in the Figure 
below do not relate to the Rönnbäcken Project.

Comparative analytical data for the AC Ni and BM Ni methods are presented below.  AC Ni 
analyses have been used in the geological sampling in order to identify sulphide nickel, 
while BM Ni has been used in the metallurgical program.  The two methods are compared 
here for another Scandinavian ultramafic deposit, showing good agreement (both axes are 
scaled in ppm).
