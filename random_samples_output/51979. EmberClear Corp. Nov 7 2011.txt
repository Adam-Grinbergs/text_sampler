ITEM 1 SUMMARY 
 

 
1.1 INTRODUCTION 

The following National Instrument 43-101- Standards for Mineral Disclosure Report (NI 
43-101) was prepared by Summit Engineering, Inc. (Summit) for EmberClear Corp. 
(EmberClear).  It addresses the coal geology and potential tonnage of the properties 
controlled in the project area, which is located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania.  The 
project location can be found on Figure 1 (page 13) of this report.  The total project area 
covers approximately 560 acres. 
 

 
1.2 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 

The property area covered by the report is called the Good Spring Property and consists 
of approximately 560 acres.  The property is located in the southwestern portion of 
Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania on portions of the Tremont and Pine Grove United 
States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 Minute quadrangle maps and is shown on the 
Project Location Map, Figure 5 (page 24).  The property is bounded to the north by State 
Route 125 and Interstate I-81, to the west by Main Street, to the south by County Route 
209 and to the east by East Franklin Road. 
 
This project area in Schuylkill County lies in the Southern Anthracite coalfield of eastern 
Pennsylvania and is a small portion of the Valley and Ridge physiographic province of 
the Appalachian Highlands.  The geologic structure of the area is characterized by folds 
and faults (mostly low-angle folded thrust faults).  Anticline and syncline axes run in a 
southwest-northeast direction with fault lines throughout.  This region is mostly rolling 
highland with some sections being more extreme along the edges of the coal fields.  The 
lower regions of rock exhibit both parallel and cross laminated  beds of well-cemented 
material that seem to thin slightly to the east.  The middle regions contain rock beds that 
are tabular, lenticular, irregular and wedge shaped.  It, too, exhibits both parallel- and 
cross-laminated strata.  The upper portions of rock crop out along the slopes of the 
synclines.  This part has been eroded over time.  These beds are also parallel and cross 
laminated and are tabular, lenticular, irregular, and wedge shaped, as well. 
 
The troughs in this region tend to be deep with steep sideslopes.  The amplitude of the 
folds can range from 2 inches to 5,000 feet.  The type of fold varies from disharmonic to 
parallel.  The surface elevation range within the property is approximately 1,050 – 1,380 
feet above sea level.  Soil information from the USDA-NRCS shows much of the area to 
be poorly to moderately well drained with the coal overwash being well drained.

1.3 OWNERSHIP 

Previous surface and mineral ownership, leases and agreements have been acquired on 
the property by S&R Coal Company, One Summit Real Estate, L.P., Rausch Creek Land, 
L.P., RCMS Investments, L.P., Garrett Group, L.P. and Schuylkill Co. Industrial 
Development Authority for mining rights necessary to conduct surface and underground 
mining operations within the property. 
 
At the present time there is one (1) existing Pennsylvania Department of Environmental 
Protection (PADEP) permit on the property.  The permit is currently owned by Summit 
Anthracite, Inc. and the permit number is 54851336.  Mining has not occurred on mining 
permit number 54851336 since 2002.  EmberClear has submitted a permit transfer 
application with the PADEP.  By acquiring mining permit number 54851336 via a permit 
transfer, EmberClear will have the legal right to mine the coal presently permitted under 
this permit. 
 
There is no relationship between Summit and Summit Anthracite, Inc.  Prior to preparing 
this NI 43-101 report for EmberClear, Summit had no knowledge of Summit Anthracite, 
Inc. 
 

 
1.4 GEOLOGY 

All of the coal seams or layers in Pennsylvania were originally deposited as virtually flat-
lying beds.  Subsequent periods of mountain building however have folded and broken 
the rocks to varying degrees.  In the anthracite area the layers have been bent into large 
folds and occasionally broken along great cracks or faults in the earth. 
 
The Good Spring Property is within the western end of Pennsylvania's Southern 
Anthracite Field which is dominated by synclines and associated anticlines that 
collectively form the Minersville Synclinorium.  The anthracite seams are contained 
within Pennsylvanian age rocks, more specifically the Llewellyn formation and the 
Pottsville formation.  The geologic structure within the property is complex, consisting of 
generally asymmetrical northeast-southwest striking synclines whose structure is 
modified by a series of faults.  The fault-system is the area dominated by thrust faults and 
the faults have had a significant effect on the anthracite coal deposits.  Folding and 
faulting has increased the amount of coal available beneath a given property area, 
particularly where properties are situated over synclines and anticlines.  The steep incline 
of the seams provides for a longer northwest – to – southeast dimension for the seams as 
opposed to that same northwest – to – southeast dimension for horizontal seams. 
 
The Good Spring Property is centered above the Donaldson syncline.  The Donaldson 
syncline contains all the typical anthracite seams of the Llewellyn and Pottsville

formations.  See Figure 3 (page 15) for a schematic geologic cross section of the 
anthracite region showing folded and faulted coal strata. 
 
As evidenced by the results of previous and current drilling and research on the Good 
Spring Property and adjacent properties, there are at least twenty-three (23) coal seams 
that may be present within the project area that may be considered as potential tonnage.  
At the apex of the Donaldson syncline these coal seams are approximately 313 feet from 
the surface for the upper most seam (Peach Mountain) to approximately 3,682 feet for the 
lower most seam (Lykens Valley #6).  The characteristics of each of the twenty-three 
(23) coal seams evaluated in this report are provided in Table 3 (page 41) and in Item 7.4 
(page 42) of this report.   
 
Summit's potential tonnage evaluation indicates that there is a range of approximately 
100 million to 216 million potential tons on the Good Spring Property in the twenty-three 
(23) coal seams evaluated so far.  At this time, due to insufficient exploration, the 
Potential Tonnage Estimates stated are conceptual in nature and cannot be defined as a 
mineral resource.  It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being 
delineated as a mineral resource. 
 
The coal quality analyzed within the Good Spring Property from EmberClear's drilling 
program as of September 2, 2011 meets the average range values for anthracite coal. The 
range of values for fixed carbon for all seams analyzed as of September 2, 2011 is from 
68.32 percent to 81.42 percent; the range of values for volatile matter for all seams 
analyzed as of September 2, 2011 is from 6.57 percent to 7.58 percent; the range of 
values for ash content for all seams analyzed as of September 2, 2011 is from 12.01 
percent to 24.48  percent; the range of values for sulfur content for all seams analyzed as 
of September 2, 2011 is from 0.54 percent to 0.87 percent and the range of values for 
BTU for all seams analyzed as of September 2, 2011 is from 11,361 to 13,334.  All 
samples were analyzed on a dry basis.   
 
Figure 3 (page 15) shows the general geology of the Good Spring Property and a 3D 
geology cross section of the property.

1.5 EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT 

EmberClear is in the process of acquiring the Summit Anthracite, Inc. mining permit 
number 54851336 via a permit transfer application from the PADEP.   
 
The Good Spring Property consists of over 560 acres which is bounded to the north by 
State Route 125 and Interstate I-81, to the west by Main Street, to the south by County 
Route 209 and to the east by East Franklin Road.  The property is located in the 
southwestern portion of Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania on portions of the Tremont and 
Pine Grove USGS 7.5 Minute quadrangle maps and is shown on the Project Location 
Map, Figure 5 (page 24).   
 
This NI 43-101 evaluates the potential tonnage in the Good Spring Property.  This report 
will also address the financial considerations of the reclamation liabilities associated with 
mining permit number 54851336 and the proposed drilling program to upgrade the 
potential tonnage to resources and then to reserves.  Based on the property's complex 
geology, none of the potential tonnage can be classified as resources because the tonnage 
does not meet the requirements of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) Paper 88-21; 
or as reserves because neither a preliminary feasibility nor feasibility study has been 
completed on the project. 
 
As of September 2, 2011, twenty-one (21) existing coreholes have been bored within 
and/or adjacent to the Good Spring Property area by previous owners.  EmberClear's own 
drilling program began in May 2011 for which four (4) bore holes have been started as of 
September 2, 2011.  A description of these holes is attached in Table 1 (page 17), the 
location of these holes are shown on Figure 4 (page 18). 
 
Four (4) geologic cross sections are located in Appendix A of this report.  The location of 
the geologic cross sections is shown on Figure 4 (page 18). 
 
The first geologic cross section consists of existing coreholes PA-07, PA-09, PA-05, PA-
03 and PA-13 which are within 1,500 ft. of the Good Spring Property.  The second 
geologic cross section consists of USGS columnar section 013, coreholes PA-05, PA-11, 
PA-06 and USGS columnar section 014 which are within 1,135 ft. of the Good Spring 
Property.  The third geologic cross section consists of the four (4) geologic columnar 
sections from the USGS within 4000 feet of the Good Spring Property.  The fourth 
geologic cross section consists of USGS columnar section 013, boreholes GS-1-11, GS-
2-11, GS-4-11 and USGS columnar section 016 for which the GS boreholes are located 
on the Good Spring Property and the USGS columnar sections are located within 3,850 
ft.

1.6 STATUS OF OPERATIONS 

Summit Anthracite, Inc. currently owns PADEP mining permit number 54851336.  The 
last mining to take place on this permit occurred in 2002.  EmberClear is in the process of 
acquiring this permit via a permit transfer application with the PADEP. 
 

 
1.7 CONCLUSIONS 

Summit's potential tonnage evaluation indicates that there is a range of approximately 
100 million to 216 million potential tons on the Good Spring Property in the twenty-three 
(23) coal seams evaluated so far.   At this time, due to insufficient exploration, the 
Potential Tonnage Estimates stated are conceptual in nature and cannot be defined as a 
mineral resource.  It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being 
delineated as a mineral resource. 
 
Information regarding the coal quality on the coal seams is limited and is discussed in 
more detail in Item 13.3 (page 69). 
 
Potential tonnage for the Four Foot, Lykens Valley #3 and Lykens Valley #6 coal seams 
were not included in the estimated total of potential tonnage because no existing borehole 
or geologic data could be found to demonstrate that these coal seams are present within 
the Good Spring Property.  However, with further exploration these coal seams maybe 
identified and added to the resource category. 
 
Summit estimates the total reclamation liability for the Good Spring Property to be forty-
seven thousand ($47,000) while the total bonding required is approximately forty-seven 
thousand ($47,000) dollars. 
 
EmberClear has access to a preparation plant to process deep mine coal and a unit train 
loadout facility to transport the coal within the Good Spring Property. 
 
EmberClear has submitted a permit amendment application to the PADEP to add 
potential tonnage to be mined by EmberClear on the existing permit number 54851336. 
 

 
1.8 RECOMMENDATIONS 

The information as reviewed, along with historic coal production on the Good Spring 
Property and adjacent properties warrants further drilling to establish potential tons, coal 
quality and to potentially reclassify coal into the resource category.

Furthermore, it is recommended that the following actions be pursued: 
 

1) Complete the current exploration/drilling within the Good Spring Property to 
firm up the potential tonnage and coal quality within the property.  Locations 
of the holes to be completed in the current program can found on Figure 12 
(page 60).  

2) Evaluate the results of the current exploration program on the Good Spring 
Property and update the potential tonnage base and the coal quality. 

3) Contingent upon the successful estimation of coal resources following the 
current exploration program perform a scoping level study and a preliminary 
economic assessment. 

4) If warranted, based on results of the current drilling program and a scoping 
level study, complete the proposed drill holes indicated as future drill holes on 
the illustration labeled "Future Exploration Holes", located in Appendix A of 
this report.  This program includes the data spacing required under the 
Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) Paper 88-21 that could bring the 
potential tonnage up to an indicated resource classification. 

5) Continue to pursue the necessary PADEP permit amendment to add deep 
mine potential tonnage to mining permit number 54851336.

4.2 OWNERSHIP 

4.2.1 MINING RIGHTS 
 
EmberClear has acquired the surface and mineral rights to all the tracts associated with the 
Good Spring Property.  Providing proof of the legal right to mine is mandatory as part of the 
permitting process in Pennsylvania.  This prevents problems that might delay planned mining 
operations.  Summit was provided copies of the deeds and agreement of sale associated with 
the tracts of land within the Good Spring Property by EmberClear.  Summit has conducted an 
independent third party review of the deeds and agreement of sale and believes them to be NI 
43-101 compliant. 
 

 
4.2.2 LOCATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE 

Infrastructure and other features have been digitized from a 1" = 6000' scale USGS 
topographic quadrangle map in a computer-based GIS format.  A composite map is shown in 
Figure 6 (page 28).

4.2.3 ROYALTY RATES 
 
The Good Spring Property lies within the Porter & Frailey Township tax districts of 
Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania.  While the surface rights and mineral rights to the 
property are owned/controlled by EmberClear; if surface mining is conducted on the 
Rausch Creek Land, L.P. (Rausch Creek) or RCMS Investments, L.P. (RCMS) former 
tracts, additional royalty payments other than the purchase price are required. 
 
To the extent that EmberClear removes coal by surface stripping from either the Rausch 
Creek or RCMS former tracts, such mined coal whether removed or sold will be subject 
to a per ton royalty equal to the greater of: (i) Six Dollars ($6.00) per ton; (ii) Ten percent 
(10%) of the selling price of the coal to third parties; or (iii) Ten percent (10%) of the fair 
market value if the coal is used for internal purposes.  The fair market value is to be 
determined by an independent qualified appraiser acceptable to both parties. 
 

 
4.2.4 EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES  

A search of available environmental records was conducted by Summit through 
Environmental Data Resources, Inc (EDR). The report was designed to assist parties 
seeking to meet the search requirements of EPA's Standards and Practices for All 
Appropriate Inquiries (40 CFR Part 312), the ASTM Standard Practice for Environmental 
Site Assessments (E 1527-05) or custom requirements developed for the evaluation of 
environmental risk associated with a parcel of real estate. 
 
The reports generated by EDR are too voluminous and repetitive to be incorporated into 
this report but a summary of the report is as follows: 
 
The report presents the results of a desktop database search for Recognized 
Environmental Conditions (REC) conducted by Summit regarding property located in 
Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. This database search was conducted without site visits 
and only represents a search of government databases as reported to Summit by 
Environmental Data Resources, Inc. (Milford, CT). None of the items identified in the 
report are considered to reach the level of an "environmental condition" or are expected 
to have a significant impact on current or planned uses of the Good Spring property 
controlled by EmberClear.

NI 43-101 Technical Report –EmberClear Reserves Inc. 
October 25, 2011   26  
 

Items of Environmental Note  
 
•  The database searches revealed numerous REC sites within the study area, primarily 

due to the fact there are many past mining operations in the vicinity (see attached 
"Database Search Results" map, Figure 6 (page 28). The databases, from which 
information was found, included ARCHIVE AST ( Archive Assistant), CDL 
(Clandestine Drug Lab), LUST (Leaking Underground Storage Tank), MINES (Mine 
Safety & Health Administration – "MSHA"), NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge 
Elimination System), RCRA- CESQG (Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity 
Generators), RCRA-SQG (Small Quantity Generators) and UST ( Underground 
Storage Tanks). This information included general permit information and MSHA 
citations. Detailed citation information is not listed and is beyond the scope of this 
investigation. It should be noted that MSHA citations listed are not environmental in 
nature.  

 
De Minimis Conditions  
 
•  Mine sites, due to the nature of the business, often store and use containers of oil, 

lubricants, petroleum-based cleaners, and fuel for equipment. These containers 
typically ranged in size from approximately one (1) to 55 gallons.  

 
Sites Not Mapped  
 
• Because of limited address information, several potential REC sites are listed based 

on their location on a particular highway, or within a certain city or county (see Item 
23.1.1 (page 89) of this report. Most of these sites represent former service stations or 
other service-oriented businesses that are located along the area's major highways 
and on private property typically not associated with the Good Spring Property. 
Detailed information on these sites is not provided by the database and is beyond the 
scope of this investigation. 

 
Refer to Table 2 (page 27) for the reclamation liability estimates for mining permit 
number 54851336 that currently exists on the Good Spring Property. These reclamation 
liabilities were acquired from the PADEP permit for the Tracey Slope Mine.

4.2.5 PERMITTING 

There is currently one (1) permit controlled by Summit Anthracite, Inc. within the Good 
Spring Property area.  Mining permit number 54851336 is the only permit on the Good 
Spring Property in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania.  No coal has been mined from this 
permit since 2002.  EmberClear Reserves Inc. has submitted a permit transfer application 
to the PADEP for mining permit number 54851336 in order to transfer the permit from 
Summit Anthracite, Inc.   
 
Details of the previous mining that has taken place within the Good Spring Property are 
included in Item 6 (page 33) of this report. 
 

 
4.3 LOCATION OF POTENTIAL TONNAGE 

The Good Spring Property is located in the southwestern portion of Schuylkill County, 
Pennsylvania on portions of the Tremont and Pine Grove United States Geological 
Survey (USGS) 7.5 Minute quadrangle maps and is shown on the Project Location Map, 
Figure 5 (page 24).    The property is bounded to the north by State Route 125 and 
Interstate I-81, to the west by Main Street, to the south by County Route 209 and to the 
east by East Franklin Road. 
  
The seams evaluated include Peach Mountain, Little Tracy, Tracy, Little Diamond, 
Diamond, Orchard, Primrose, Holmes, Four Foot, Mammoth Top Split, Mammoth 
Middle Split, Mammoth Bottom Spilt, Skidmore, Seven Foot, Buck Mountain, Scotty 
Steel #3, Scotty Steel #2, Lykens Valley #1, Lykens Valley #2, Lykens Valley #3, 
Lykens Valley #4, Lykens Valley #5 and Lykens Valley #6. 
 
The potential tonnage on the Good Spring Property is owned by EmberClear.  Summit 
has estimated that there is a range of approximately 100 million to 216 million potential 
tons on the Good Spring Property.  At this time, due to insufficient exploration, the 
Potential Tonnage Estimates stated are conceptual in nature and cannot be defined as a 
mineral resource.  It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being 
delineated as a mineral resource.

ITEM 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 

 
5.1 TOPOGRAPHY, ELEVATION AND VEGETATION 

The Good Spring Property is situated at approximately Latitude 40° 37' 31" and 
Longitude 76° 27' 50" (coordinate system – NAD 83, Pennsylvania South) in Porter and 
Frailey Townships of Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The surface elevation of this 
property ranges from 1140 to 1320 feet above sea level. 
 
The Good Spring Property is located within the western end of Pennsylvania's Southern 
Anthracite field which is dominated by synclines that collectively form the Minersville 
Synclinorium. Specifically, the property is centered above the Donaldson Syncline and 
contains all the typical formations of the Pennsylvania aged Llewellyn and Pottsville 
formations.  
 
The general slope of the property is from the south to the north, where Good Spring 
Creek cuts through the northern edge. Good Spring Creek is a tributary of Swatara Creek, 
which is classified by the state of Pennsylvania as a cold water fishery. Swatara Creek is 
part of the Susquehanna/Chesapeake River Basin.  Swatara Creek has been listed by the 
PADEP as a low quality stream. 
 
Approximately 34 percent (189 acres) of the site consists of barren industrial lands

5.2 ACCESSIBILITY AND AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE 

Schuylkill County is located in eastern Pennsylvania in fairly close proximity to New 
York City, Philadelphia and Baltimore. The county population as of July 2009 was 
146,952, with 63 percent considered urban and 37 percent rural. The Good Spring 
Property is located 6.4 miles from Tremont, 18.2 miles from Pottsville and 45.6 miles 
from Harrisburg. The Good Spring Property is located in a rural area that is sparsely 
populated.  Interstate 81, which runs through the property, allows for easy access to the 
major east coast metropolitan areas. 
 
This property is bounded to the north by State Highway 125, to the south by U.S. Route 
209, to the west by State Route 4011 (Main Street) and Interstate 81 runs through the 
property. There is one permitted entrance (by the Pennsylvania Department of 
Transportation) which is off of State Route 4011. This entrance is the property's only 
means of ingress/egress. The property does have several dirt roads that cut through 
adjacent properties to the south and connect to State Route 4011 and U.S. Route 209. 
However, there is no permanent easement in place to allow access to the property from 
these roads.  
 
There is also access to the Reading and Northern Railroad (RBMN) which has spur lines 
that bisect the property. These spurs are equipped with loading facilities on the property 
which are operational and in good condition. The Reading and Northern Railroad is a 
regional railroad in eastern Pennsylvania that operates over 300 miles of track and 
primarily hauls coal from the anthracite producing regions of eastern Pennsylvania. This 
railroad system has multiple connections to the Norfolk Southern Railway and 
connections to other rail systems. This rail system would allow for anthracite deliveries to 
all points within the United States and abroad. See Figure 7- Reading and Northern Rail 
System Map, page 32.

previous companies that undertook exploration on the Good Spring Property is located in 
Table 1 (page 17). 
 

 
6.3 HISTORICAL POTENTIAL RESOURCE OR RESERVE ESTIMATES 

There were no historical potential resource or reserve estimates used by Summit in 
preparation of this report that were in accordance with the categories set out in Item 2.4 
of NI 43-101.  Based on EmberClear's drilling program as of September 2, 2011 and 
using historical data from published geological reports the geology type of the Good 
Spring Property is "Complex".   Previous resource or reserve estimates on the Good 
Spring Property did not follow the guidelines for this "Geology Type" as specified in 
Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) Paper 88-21.   
 

 
6.4 HISTORICAL PRODUCTION 

The most recent production records from the state of Pennsylvania are through the end of 
2009.  As of December 31, 2009, the PADEP listed 72 permitted anthracite mining 
operations in Pennsylvania, all of which are in Schuylkill County or surrounding 
counties. The counties surrounding and adjacent to Schuylkill County are Carbon, 
Luzerne, Columbia, Northumberland, Dauphin, Lebanon, Berks and Lehigh Counties. In 
2009 they were 5 permitted anthracite coal deep mines and 23 permitted anthracite 
surface mines, making a total of 28 mines permitted in the adjacent counties. The total 
anthracite production in surrounding counties was approximately 2.1 million tons in that 
same year.  
 
According to PADEP they were 6 anthracite deep mines and 38 anthracite surface mines 
in Schuylkill County in 2009. From these mines approximately 47,000 tons were 
produced in the deep mines while another 760,000 were produced in the surface mines of 
the County in 2009. Thus a total of about 807,000 tons of anthracite coal was produced in 
Schuylkill County alone in 2009. 
 
The total number of employees in the state was 393 on anthracite surface mines working 
a total of 766,422 hours in 2009. For deep mines, they were 91 people working a total of 
158,235 hours in the state of Pennsylvania in 2009.

Property since 2002. 
 
ITEM 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 

 
7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

Pennsylvania is composed of six (6) distinct physiographic regions. They are, listed from 
the southeast corner to the northwest corner, the Atlantic Coastal Plain Province, the 
Piedmont Province, the New England Province, the Valley and Ridge Province, the 
Appalachian Plateau Province and the Central Lowlands Province. 
 
A majority of the rocks exposed at the surface in Pennsylvania are sedimentary and were 
deposited during the Paleozoic Era. Almost all metamorphic and igneous rocks are 
confined to the southeast portion of the state. A total of four (4) orogenies have affected 
the rocks of Pennsylvania – the Greenville orogeny, the Taconic orogeny, the Acadian 
orogeny and the Appalachian orogeny. The Appalachian event has left the most evidence 
and has continued to shape the state's landscape. Pennsylvania coal distribution is shown 
in Figure 8 (page 37). The Main Bituminous Field is located in the western portion of the 
state while the primary anthracite fields are located in the eastern portion. 
 
The Good Spring Property is located in the Valley and Ridge Province. This province is 
the second largest in the state and is where the Pennsylvania anthracite fields are located. 
The rocks here are severely folded and contain numerous anticlines and synclines that 
plunge and fold over each other. There are also numerous thrust faults that complicate the 
geology. Most of the deformation is the result of continent to continent collision during 
the Appalachian orogeny. 
 
There are seven (7) distinct regions of the Valley and Ridge Province. The subject 
property is located in the Anthracite Upland Region. This geologically complex region 
contains the Pennsylvania anthracite fields.  
 
Schuylkill County lies within the Anthracite Upland Region of the Valley and Ridge 
physiographic province. The landform consists of a series of northeasterly trending 
parallel canoe-shaped valleys and steep-sided ridges cut through in numerous places by 
water courses.  The property is situated in the southwest section of Pennsylvania's 
Southern Anthracite Field, which is one of the four defined fields in eastern 
Pennsylvania. See Figure 8 (page 37).

The Southern Anthracite field of Pennsylvania consist of late Devonian, Mississippian 
and Pennsylvanian age rocks.  These formations are from oldest to youngest late 
Devonian Catskill, Mississippian Pocono and Mauch Chunk, Early Pennsylvanian 
Pottsville and Middle to Late Pennsylvanian Llewellyn.  The Southern Anthracite Field 
lies within the Minersville Synclinorium which includes many double plunging 
enechelon anticlines and synclines and has been broken by numerous thrust and bedding 
faults.  High angle faulting has also been mapped within the Minersville Synclinorium.

7.2 LOCAL AND PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

Within the southern half of the Tremont Quadrangle, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, 
which includes the Southern Anthracite Field, a sequence of rocks of late Devonian, 
Mississippian and Pennsylvanian age, more than 11,000 feet thick, is exposed. These 
Paleozoic rocks are overlain in many areas by a varying thickness of unconsolidated 
sediments of Quaternary age. This entire sequence of rocks accumulated in a continental 
environment. 
 
The Southern Anthracite field is located on a limb of the Minersville Synclinorium. The 
limb is folded into many doubly plunging anticlines and synclines and is broken by 
thrust, tear and bedding faults. The trend of the folds ranges from N 65° E to N 85° E. 
The fault system within the Pennsylvanian age rocks is dominated by a series of low 
angle folded thrust faults that are truncated by later high angle thrust and tear faults and 
paralleled by bedding faults. The folded faults developed before and/or during an early 
episode of folding and the other faults developed near the end of this episode or during a 
later episode of deformation. 
 
Rock formations at the Good Spring Property are of Pennsylvanian Age and consist of 
elements of the Llewellyn and Pottsville formations (the Pottsville formation consists of 
the Sharp Mountain, Schuylkill and Tumbling Run members) as shown on Figure 10 
(page 46). The Llewellyn formation is composed of shale, siltstone, quartzite and 
conglomerate. The Pottsville formation is made up chiefly of conglomerate, sandstone, 
siltstone, shale and coal. 
 
The coal in this area is anthracite ranging from 75 to 88 percent fixed carbon and 4.5 to 
6.5 percent volatile matter on a dry basis. All present coal beds have similar physical as 
well as chemical characteristics. The sulfur content of the coals ranges from 0.6 to 1.5 
percent, the ash content ranges from 9.7 to 20.2 and the BTU ranges from 12,000 to 
13,500 on a dry basis. There are approximately sixty (60) coal beds known to exist in the 
Pottsville and Llewellyn formations and at least twenty-three (23) are present within the 
property area.

7.3 DESCRIPTION OF SURROUNDING ROCK TYPES 
 
Strata within the area of interest consist of conglomerates, sandstone, siltstone, shale, red 
beds and coals of the Pennsylvanian System (Llewellyn and Pottsville formations). The 
rocks of the Llewellyn formation cap the slopes and trough in the EmberClear property 
area with the Pottsville formation underlying.  Rocks of the Llewellyn formation outcrop 
within said property.  
 
Typically in the Southern Anthracite coalfields of Pennsylvania, the rock units are 
divided into multiple sub-sections.  The Schuylkill member and Sharp Mountain member 
cover the Pottsville seams covered in this report, and the Post-Pottsville (Llewellyn 
formation) rocks cover the remaining seams in this report.   
 
The conglomerate beds of the Schuylkill member are quartz-pebble and are consistently 
gray in color.  The basal unit contains quartz and quartzite-pebbles, conglomeratic 
quartzose sandstone, quartzose sandstone and subgraywacke interbedded with siltstone 
and shale with some beds of coal.  Veins of white to grey quartz and quartzite run 
throughout.  The subgraywacke tends to contain a large amount of carbonaceous material 
like vegetable matter.  The siltstone of the Schuylkill member is quartzose and micaceous 
with some clay and carbonaceous material, while the shale is clayey or silty and high in 
carbonaceous material.  Ironstone nodules are common in this shale. 
 
The Sharp Mountain member has conglomerate beds of quartz-pebble and cobble with 
some mixing of conglomeratic quartzose sandstone, siltstone and shale and coal beds.  Its 
basal conglomerate contains veins of quartz and quartzite.  It exhibits some traces of 
sandstone, siltstone, shale, schist, gneiss, and granite in some areas.  The quartzose rock 
can contain chert, mica, and other rock fragments. 
 
The Llewellyn formation contains shale, siltstone, quartzose sandstone, subgraywacke, 
conglomeratic quartzose sandstone, quartz-pebble conglomerate, and coal beds.  It is 
predominantly course clastic material such as sandstone, subgraywacke, and granule and 
small-pebble conglomerates. 
 
The conglomerate sandstone and siltstone/shale facies are commonly the lithology 
immediately above or below the coal seams. 
 
Table 3 (page 41) depicts the major coal seams, approximate average thickness, seam 
parting (if any) and the description of the underlying and overlying rock deposits.

7.5 COAL QUALITIES 
 
Coal quality information has been acquired for this report from the afore-mentioned 
studies and reports sourced from the USGS and the PAGS and from EmberClear's 
current drilling program as of September 2, 2011. The information came from drillholes 
in the Southern Anthracite field of Pennsylvania. The information acquired by Summit 
was enough to interpret coal qualities for a majority of the coal seams for the EmberClear 
property area along the Donaldson syncline, but more exploration would be needed to 
explore qualities of all twenty-three (23) of the coal seams more accurately throughout 
the property. Table 4 (page 69) summarizes the average quality data as determined from 
the potential tonnage used. A description of the coal qualities and methods to obtain them 
are discussed in more detail in Item 11 (page 61) of this report.

ITEM 8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
8.1 MINERAL DEPOSIT TYPE 
 
The definition of "Deposit Type" for coal properties is different from that applied to other 
types of geologic deposits.  Criteria applied to coal deposits for the purposes of 
determination of coal resources and reserves include both "Geology Type" as well as 
"Deposit Type".  For coal deposits this is an important concept because the classification 
of a coal deposit as a particular type determines the range limiting criteria that may be 
applied during estimation of reserves and resources. 
 
"Geology Type" for coal deposits is a parameter that is specified in Geological Survey of 
Canada (GSC) Paper 88-21, which is a guideline reference for coal deposits as specified 
in NI 43-101.  "Geology Type" is a definition of the amount of geological complexity, 
usually imposed by the structural complexity of the area, and classification of a coal 
deposit by "Geology Type" determines the approach to be used for the resource/reserve 
estimation procedures and the limits to be applied to certain key estimation criteria.  The 
identification of a particular "Geology Type" for a coal property defines the confidence 
that can be placed in the extrapolation of data values away from a particular point of 
reference such as drill hole. 
 
The classification scheme of GSC Paper 88-21 is similar to many other international coal 
classification systems, but it has one significant difference.  This system is designed to 
accommodate differences in degree of tectonic deformation of different coal deposits in 
Canada.  The four classes of geologic complexity, from lowest to highest are: Low, 
Moderate, Complex and Severe.  Based on EmberClear's drilling program as of 
September 2, 2011 and using historical data from published geological reports the 
geology type of the EmberClear Good Spring Property is "Complex".   
 
"Deposit Type" as defined in GSC Paper 88-21 refers to the extraction method most 
suited to the coal deposit.  There are four categories, which are: Surface, Underground, 
Non-Conventional and Sterilized. 
 
The EmberClear Good Spring Property coal sequence, based on the reported coal 
thicknesses and depth of the coal occurrence below the ground surface within the project 
area, is considered to be an "Underground Resource of Future Interest" deposit type. 
 
The primary coal seams that have been historically mined in close proximity to the 
project area are, in a stratigraphic ascending order, the Lykens Valley #6, Lykens Valley 
#5, Lykens Valley #4, Lykens Valley #3, Lykens Valley #2, Lykens Valley #1, Scotty 
Steel #2, Scotty Steel #3, Buck Mountain, Seven Foot, Skidmore, Mammoth Bottom

Split, Mammoth Middle Split, Mammoth Top Split, Four Foot, Holmes, Primrose, 
Orchard, Diamond, Little Diamond, Tracy, Little Tracy, and Peach Mountain.  
 
It should be noted that all of these seams may vary in depth below the surface and 
thickness within the project area. The depositional environment of coal seams can 
produce inconsistent characteristics with regard to coal quality, thickness and coal 
partings. Some seams tend to be more consistent in both character and depth than others. 
The way to determine these characteristics for each seam is to perform good thorough 
testing of samples for the seam quality and analysis of drillhole and other geologic 
information.  It should be noted that all depths referred to are reported as being 
perpendicular to the surface at the axis of the syncline. 
 
8.2 GEOLOGICAL MODELING AND EXPLORATION PROGRAM 
 
The site specific geology of the project area has been characterized by using geologic 
cross-sections and data collected from columnar sections produced by the United States 
Geological Survey and the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural 
Resources/Geological Survey.  Summit also received additional subsurface information 
from EmberClear generated from known drillholes on nearby mining operations.     
 
The depths (perpendicular to the surface at the approximate intersection of the ground 
surface and the axis of the syncline) listed for the coal seams are an average taken from 
the geologic cross-sections created from the drilling logs described above, which may or 
may not have been surveyed precisely. The exact depth of each coal seam from this 
drillhole data depends on the accuracy of the drill collar location, whether it was 
surveyed or spotted on a topographic map, the angle of the drilling with respect to 
horizontal and the slope of the ground/seams, and other factors. 
 
The drillhole data was supplied to Summit by EmberClear from previous drilling 
programs and EmberClear's current drilling program as of September 2, 2011, acquired 
from sources at the USGS and PAGS and other public sources, backed up by research, 
and/or acquired from adjacent permits. Using these drillholes Summit correlated the 
seams with respect to depths, thicknesses, shapes and locations, which allows Summit to 
perform calculations such as volumes.

9.2 RELEVANT INFORMATION OF EXPLORATION DATA 
 
Based on the property's complex geology, none of the potential tonnage can be classified 
as resources because the tonnage does not meet the requirements of the Geological 
Survey of Canada (GSC) Paper 88-21; or as reserves because neither a preliminary 
feasibility nor feasibility study has been completed on the project. 
 
Upon review of existing site conditions, Summit believes that there are no active mining 
operations currently being conducted on the Good Spring Property and that there exists 
potential tonnage in the property area in the Peach Mountain, Little Tracy, Tracy, Little 
Diamond, Diamond, Orchard, Primrose, Holmes, Four Foot, Mammoth Top Split, 
Mammoth Middle Split, Mammoth Bottom Spilt, Skidmore, Seven Foot, Buck Mountain, 
Scotty Steel #3, Scotty Steel #2, Lykens Valley #1,  Lykens Valley #2, Lykens Valley #3, 
Lykens Valley #4, Lykens Valley #5 and Lykens Valley #6 coal seams. 
 
The Good Spring Property consists of approximately 560 acres, located in Schuylkill 
County, Pennsylvania.  EmberClear has obtained one (1) exploration permit from the 
PADEP within the property area.  Additional exploration permits will need to be obtained 
from the PADEP in order to complete the drilling program.  As of September 2, 2011, 
Summit has acquired twenty-one (21) drill holes from EmberClear that have been drilled 
by previous owners within and/or adjacent to the Good Spring Property.  EmberClear's 
own drilling program began in May 2011 for which four (4) drill holes have been started 
as of September 2, 2011.  The preliminary information from those four (4) drill holes is 
included in this report.  A description of all these drill holes is attached in Table 1 (page 
17).  Four (4) geologic columnar sections from the USGS within 4000 feet of the Good 
Spring Property have been located.  The columnar sections were compiled by the USGS 
from measurements taken of coal seams and other lithologies within slope shaft cuts, 
mine works and surface mining pits.  These measurements were then adjusted in 
conjunction with the coinciding seam dip angle to ascertain a true seam thickness.  The 
USGS then correlated the data to produce cross sectional lithology.  A cross section of 
these columnar sections is shown in Appendix A of this report.  The location of the four 
(4) geologic columnar sections can be found on Figure 11 (page 56). 
 
Existing deep mine maps were used to help evaluate the true thicknesses of the coal 
seams that have been mined within and adjacent to the Good Spring Property.  The 
existing deep mine maps were also used to determine approximately how many tons of 
coal for those coal seams have been mined and not considered potential tons.

9.3 SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION OF EXPLORATION 
INFORMATION 
 
The twenty-one (21) existing coreholes located within/or adjacent to the Good Spring 
Property were only drilled approximately 140 feet to 350 feet below the surface; 
therefore, only intercepting 1 to 5 of the coal seams that outcrop on the Good Spring 
Property.  All but a few of these coreholes were completed in 1975 and 1976.   
 
The four (4) geologic columnar sections are located from 530 feet to 4000 feet away from 
the Good Spring Property, but are the closest geologic columnar sections to be found.  
Information from these geologic columnar sections is limited because they do not 
intersect every coal seam being evaluated on the Good Spring Property.  Section USGS 
013 only intersects 11 of the 23 coal seams being evaluated.  Section USGS 014 only 
intersects 19 of the 23 coal seams being evaluated.  Section USGS 015 only intersects 6 
of the 23 coal seams being evaluated.  Section USGS 016 only intersects 11 of the 23 
coal seams being evaluated.  
 
Of the four (4) EmberClear boreholes drilled as of September 2, 2011 only GS-2-11 has 
been drilled to the depth of the lowest coal seam being evaluated on the Good Spring 
Property.  The other three (3) boreholes have been drilled between 1400 and 1740 feet 
below the surface elevation.  Only a portion of boreholes GS-2-11 and GS-4-11 have 
been geophysically logged.  The coal seams intersected in the four (4) EmberClear 
boreholes drilled as of September 2, 2011 are preliminary and have not yet been validated 
although a preliminary assessment of coal thicknesses has been made of the portions of 
holes GS-2-11 and GS-4-11 that were geophysically logged. 
 
The information obtained from the existing deep mine maps is surveyed information and 
is accurate.  However, the deep mine maps only have information on the coal seams that 
outcrop within and/or adjacent to the Good Spring Property. 
 
 
ITEM 10 DRILLING 
 
10.1 TYPE OF DRILLING 
 
10.1.1 DRILLING PROCEDURES  
 
Typically exploration holes in the region are by rotary drilling methods.  The rotary 
exploration holes are often followed by standard NX core drilling procedures whereby all 
core recovered is laid out on the ground and/or in core trays in a set interval or on a run-
by-run basis.  In either case, both lithological and geotechnical logging are easily 
facilitated.  All coal seams, and strata up to 10 feet above and 10 feet below the coal 



    
 
             Summit Engineering, Inc. 
  
             

NI 43-101 Technical Report –EmberClear Reserves Inc.

seams, are packed into lockable core boxes for transport to a designated secure core shed.  
In addition, for surface mine permits, and underground face up areas, all strata of the 
entire pertinent corehole(s) that is to be disturbed area also stored in lockable core boxes 
and transported to a designated secure core shed to facilitate mandatory geochemical 
testing as part of the permitting process. 
 
10.1.2 DRILLING LENGTH  
 
Drilling length is typically a factor of both the surface (collar) elevation where the 
drilling is to commence, and the bottom-most elevation of the coal seam to be analyzed 
where drilling will cease. Surface elevations can vary along the property from 
approximately 1160 feet to 1320 feet above sea level, while coal seams vary in elevation 
from 313 feet to 3628 feet below the surface elevation.  Therefore, the minimum and 
maximum expected depth of drilling within the project area should between 75 feet to 
3628 feet respectively. 
 
10.1.3 ORIENTATION OF MINERAL  
 
The property area is located within the western end of Pennsylvania's Southern 
Anthracite Field which is dominated by synclines, and their associated anticlines, that 
collectively form the Minersville Synclinorium.  The anthracite seams are contained 
within Pennsylvanian age rocks, more specifically the Llewellyn Formation and the 
Pottsville Formation.  The geologic structure within the property is complex, consisting 
of generally asymmetrical northeast-southwest striking synclines whose structure is 
modified by a series of faults.  The fault-system is the area dominated by thrust faults and 
the faults have had a significant effect on the anthracite coal potential tonnage.  Folding 
and faulting has increased the amount of coal available beneath a given property area, 
particularly where properties are situated over synclines and anticline.  The steep incline 
of the seams provides for a longer northwest – to – southeast dimension for the seams as 
opposed to that same northwest – to – southeast dimension for horizontal seams. 
 
The Good Spring Property is centered above the Donaldson syncline.  The Donaldson 
syncline contains all the typical anthracite seams of the Llewellyn and Pottsville 
Formations.  See Figure 3 (page 15) for a schematic block diagram of the anthracite 
region showing folded and faulted coal strata.

10.2 EXTENT OF DRILLING 
 
The extent of drilling within and/or adjacent to the project area has been characterized by 
the drilling of twenty-one (21) known coreholes by previous owners.  These coreholes 
were drilled between 140 and 350 feet below the surface and most were completed in 
1975 and 1976.  EmberClear's own drilling program began in May 2011 for which four 
(4) boreholes have been started as of September 2, 2011.  Limited coal quality data is 
available. 
 
As of September 2, 2011, EmberClear's drilling program has consisted of drilling 
borehole GS-1-11 down to approximately 1,550 feet below the surface elevation, drilling 
borehole GS-2-11 down to approximately 3,440 feet below the surface elevation, drilling 
borehole GS-4-11 down to approximately 1,740 feet below the surface elevation and 
drilling borehole GS-9-11 down to approximately 1,400 feet below the surface elevation.  
Boreholes GS-1-11 and GS-9-11 have been drilled using the diamond core drilling 
method, while boreholes GS-2-11 and GS-4-11 have been drilled using the air/mud rotary 
method of drilling.  Portions of boreholes GS-2-11 and GS-4-11 have been geophysically 
logged.  The depths and thicknesses from the coal seams intercepted in each of the four 
(4) boreholes as of September 2, 2011 have been used in the evaluation of the coal seam 
potential tonnage calculations.  The coal seams intercepted in boreholes GS-1-11 and GS-
9-11 as of September 2, 2011 have been taken to HawkMtn Labs for coal quality 
analysis.  Those coal quality results have been incorporated into the range of coal quality 
provided in this report. 
 
EmberClear plans to continue their drilling program within the Good Spring Property.  
The additional exploration drilling located within the Good Spring Property area will 
allow for more distinct classification of all the coal seams, in both the Good Spring 
Property and for expanding the EmberClear property potential tonnage base in the area 
for the future.  EmberClear has obtained one (1) exploration permit from the PADEP in 
order to begin the proposed drilling program.  Additional exploration permits from the 
PADEP will be required in order to complete EmberClear's drilling program.  See Figure 
12 (page 60) for the location of the proposed exploration holes and the existing 
boreholes.    
 
A summary of the existing drillholes used for this report is provided in Table 1 (page 17) 
within this report.

ITEM 11   SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
11.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION METHODS 
 
Historically, all sampling and analysis was completed by previous property owners.  
Sampling methods varied by company and intended use.  Reports exist that describe the 
results of the sampling analysis.  Most of the samples collected were for testing for 
metallurgical coal.   
 
The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) publishes the most inclusive 
reference to analytical procedures.  This publication, which is revised annually, provides 
extensive information concerning generally accepted methods of laboratory analysis.  
ASTM also provides standards for sampling and some information concerning sample 
handling.

by, HawkMtn Labs Inc., 201 West Clay Avenue, Hazle Township, PA 18202 USA, 
phone number (570) 455-6011, sampling method protocols were established.  All core 
was cleaned with water, measured, fully described, photographed, place in plastic core 
sleeves, stapled shut, labeled, then stored in labeled core boxes that were secured.  
Precaution was taken to assure clean samples for analysis.  The selected coal seams were 
boxed separately from adjacent non-coal strata.  In some instances, coaly roof and floor 
that would likely be included in the ROM product was also included in the coal boxes for 
testing.   All coal cores were stored in a manner to prevent overheating from sun 
exposure.  The coal boxes were inventoried by an EmberClear project field representative 
and picked-up on site by a HawkMtn Labs Courier.  A Chain of Custody form was then 
completed, checked and signed by both the project field representative and the HawkMtn 
Labs Courier.   
 
11.2 INTEGRITY OF SAMPLING PROCESS 
 
On-the-job monitoring and training of staff ensures that correct procedures and best 
practice methods are being continually employed.  All lab equipment and instrumentation 
is routinely checked and calibrated. 
 
Each coal seam will be represented by 3 to 5 discrete samples.  The discrete samples will 
demonstrate the variability of the coal for that seam.  The discrete samples representing 
the top & bottom split of the coal seam may include transition material contaminating the 
coal and will be prepared by a sink float separation to separate the rock from the coal 
providing accurate characterization from the analysis.  The middle split discrete samples 
that are determined to be composed of pure coal will be analyzed without sink float 
separation.  These un-separated specimens will represent the inherent quality of the coal.  
These non separated samples will also provide an opportunity to conduct trace analysis 
for chlorine, mercury, or other trace elements for which the sink float separation will 
prevent determination because of contamination concerns from a specific gravity 
solution.  This analysis will be performed at the discretion of the client.

A Seam Composite Sample will be constructed from a portion of the discrete samples as 
to represent the coal seam on a whole.  The composite sample will be prepared by sink 
float separation with a more comprehensive combustion, chemical & physical 
characterization of the recovery fraction.  The sink float analysis will allow for a most 
accurate estimation of recoverable coal from the coal seam.  The combustion analysis, 
Prox/Ultimate will provide a complete assay of the combustion properties providing for 
typical specification required for thermal consumption and metallurgical use.  The ash 
chemistry and ash fusion analysis and calculated indexes will provide pertinent 
information defining the ash composition and slagging properties.  This information is 
useful for any slagging process such as that used in IGCC power generation or slagging 
boilers.  Ash chemistry characterization also lends to the specification for metallurgical 
coal uses.  The physical hardness properties of the coal will be defined by the Hardgrove 
Grindability Index (HGI) which characterizes the hardness of the coal against of known 
coals.  The index is used to design pulverizing equipment; to assess the ware coal has on 
such equipment, and is often a specification for commercial orders.     
 

1. The Chain of Custody is checked against the received core boxes. Visual 
observations & documentation will be conducted and the following information 
recorded for each core box on a Core Specimen Receipt Form.  This will be 
included with the final reporting certificates.  

 
a. Measurements of the coal seam lengths and geologic angularity of 

antiform/syniform in degrees or ratio. 
b. Condition of the stratum integrity: solid, broken, or fractured. 
c. The presence of inherent contamination from transition stratum or 

interlaced slate & shale called lamination.  
d. Photograph documentation of the core specimen and box to include lid 

with field documentation.   
e. Any other pertinent information.   

 
2. Determine physical dimensional analysis on bisectional cuts or slices of core 

specimen to represent the predominant stratum characteristics of the core for each 
box, approximately 10'.  Up to four representative samples will be taken to 
represent each box. 

 
a. The following measurement will be documented: 

i. Diameter & Length 
ii. Mass as received and Mass Dry 

b. The following will then be calculated from cross-sectional specimen: 
i. As Received Moisture  

ii. Unit weight in pounds per cubic ft. (pcf)

October 25, 2011   64  
 

3. The full seam will then be evaluated for division into discrete sample fractions, 
typically representing, if possible, equal length portions of the entire coal seam. 
Top and Bottom split will generally need S&F separation and the Middle split 
will be considered pure as guilder by the dry unit weight of the specimen and the 
visual observation of the absence of lamination and other forms of contamination.   
The representative core length and  position must be recorded for each discrete 
sample with the following ID: 

 
i. Top Split 

ii. Middle Split #1, #2, #3... 
iii. Bottom Split 
iv. Length of core represented by each discrete sample. 
v. Along with Seam ID, Core Box ID, Depths… 

 
Note: The objective of dividing the seam into discrete samples is to provide insight into 
the variability of the coal seam and to obtain at least one pure core specimen for discrete 
analysis as to represent the inherent quality to the coal seam.  The pure specimen will 
also afford the opportunity for the analysis of chlorine & mercury or other trace 
constituents which are not possible on sink float separated specimens due to 
contamination.  Seam fractions which are fragmented and intermixed with transition 
stratum of rock or layers of contamination of shale and slate, called lamination, will 
require a sink float analysis to accurately characterize the quality and recoverable coal 
from the represented coal seam.  
  

4. The discrete seam samples can now be logged into Laboratory Information 
Management System (LIMS), for the predetermined testing as determined from 
above recommendations. 

 
5. The discrete samples will be lightly crushed and split into representative fractions 

of nominal amounts as follows: 
 

a. 0.5 to 1.0 Kg for discrete analysis Package A 
b. 1.0 to 2.0 Kg for discrete analysis Package B 
c. 0.5 to 1.0 Kg for construction of Seam Composite Sample 
d. The remaining discrete sample portion will be retained in reserve 

 
6. The Seam Composite Sample will be constructed of equal positions of the discrete 

samples unless the discrete samples do not equally represent the coal seam.  In 
this case the Seam Composite Sample will be constructed on a mass proportion 
basis to accurately represent the coal seam on a whole.

7. The Seam Composite Sample will be analyzed as followed: 
a. Sink Float preparation: 

i. Size +/- 60 mesh. 
ii. Separation of +60 mesh @ 1.65 specific gravity, Zinc Chloride salt 

solution. 
iii. Ash on sink

i. Prox/Ultimate analysis 

ii. Ash chemistry with calculated index 
iii. Ash fusion Reducing Atmosphere 
iv. Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) 

 
11.3 SECURITY METHODS 
 
In coal work it is unusual to employ security methods (other than those described in the 
chain-of-custody procedures) for the shipping and storage of samples, because coal is a 
low value bulk commodity.  It is the author's opinion that the sample preparation, 
security measures and analytical procedures as reported to Summit for this property, were 
sufficient to ensure representative sampling results.

ITEM 12   DATA VERIFICATION 
 
12.1 SOURCES OF DATA 
 
Summit reviewed the "Reserve Narrative For Future Fuels, LLC, EmberClear Reserve 
Inc. Reserves, Porter & Frailey Townships, Schuylkill County, PA:" prepared by Mining 
& Environmental Engineers, the "EmberClear Resource Estimate-Preliminary Draft" 
prepared by Performance Engineering, LLC, data provided by PAGS, data provided by 
the USGS, data provided by PADEP and data provided by EmberClear.  Based on a 
review of the available information and Summit's knowledge of the area and past mining 
activities, Summit concludes that the historical data is both valid and representative of the 
Good Spring Property. 
 
12.2 SITE VISIT 
 
On October 6, 2011, Phil Lucas, of Summit and author of this report, conducted a site 
visit to the Good Spring Property.  On March 30, June 21, August 23-24 and October 6 of 
2011, Jim Canterbury of Summit, conducted site visits to the Good Spring Property.  On 
August 23-24, 2011, Warren Evenson conducted a site visit of the property.  During the 
visits, pictures of the property were taken and are included in Item 9 of this report.  Also, 
on June 21, 2011 Jim Canterbury conducted a site visit to the HawkMtn Labs Inc. lab. 
 
The author is of the opinion his knowledge of the property, the data contained in the 
technical report, the historical data provided by EmberClear and the geologic and coal 
quality testing data from the 2011 drilling program as of September 2, 2011 are sufficient 
to support the conclusions presented in this Technical Report.  
 
 
ITEM 13   MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
13.1 REGIONAL COAL QUALITY 
 
The anthracite coal industry in eastern Pennsylvania is made up of four (4) fields with 
production from eight counties. Those fields are the Northern Field, the Eastern Middle 
Field, the Western Middle Field and the Southern Field.   
 
The amount of coal available for mining in the anthracite fields has been increased 
locally by folding and repetition of strata by thrust faulting. Parts of many anthracite beds 
in the troughs of synclines are below the present limits of mining. Mining operations 
have benefitted greatly from the fault duplication of thick economically important 
anthracite beds at or near the surface.  



    
 
             Summit Engineering, Inc. 
  
             

NI 43-101 Technical Report –EmberClear Reserves Inc. 
October 25, 2011   68  
 

Mining of coal in the anthracite fields has been negatively impacted by (a) bedding, tear 
or thrust faults whose displacements are smaller or slightly greater than the thickness of 
the respective coal seams; (b) large faults that have macerated the coal; (c) large faults 
that displace coal seams to unknown locations and reduce the effectiveness of continuous 
underground tunneling; (d) the squeezing of coal or pinch-outs; (e) small folds where the 
coal has been sheared, thinned or thickened; and (f) areas of macerated or broken coal on 
crests, in troughs or on limbs of folds, often called shear zones. 
 
The coal quality analyzed within the Good Spring Property from EmberClear's drilling 
program as of September 2, 2011 meets the range values for anthracite coal in this area. 
The range values for fixed carbon in this area range from 75 to 88 percent; the range 
values for volatile matter in this area range from 4.5 to 6.5 percent; the range values for 
ash content in this area range from 9.7 to 20.2 percent; the range values for sulfur content 
in this area range from 0.6 to 1.5 percent and the range values for BTU in this area range 
from 12,000 to 13,500.  All sample ranges are analyzed on a dry basis.   
 
13.2 DATA SOURCES AND MODELING METHOD 

The method used to estimate in-situ quality of coal by mining block were determined 
using laboratory analyses of coal samples, available primarily from exploratory drill 
holes. See Table 1 (page 17) for a listing of the twenty-one (21) available coreholes that 
were made available for this property area from previous owners and the four (4) 
boreholes from EmberClear's drilling program.   
 
The coal quality data was tabulated on a seam-by-seam basis for individual potential 
tonnage areas on computer spreadsheets to determine the basic statistical parameters 
(average, maximum, minimum) of the data sets.  This work was done on the same in-
seam, dry basis as the original laboratory data.  The arithmetic averages by area were 
then used to represent the quality of the potential tonnage. 
 
In cases where a laboratory test result was judged to be anomalous, and most certainly 
un-representative of the seam quality within the potential tonnage area (based on other 
more competing data), the anomalous data was not used in the computation of the area 
averages. 
 
Several of the potentially mineable coal seams did not have any drillhole quality analysis 
available, in these cases an attempt was made to estimate coal quality from previous 
production analysis. 
 
Report users should understand that there are limitations to the use of the average coal 
quality estimations presented herein. The amount of seam quality data available to 
represent individual potential tonnage blocks is generally variable. Where only limited

data is available to represent coal quality, additional sampling and laboratory testing is 
recommended to confirm the potential tonnage yield and quality projections.  For some of 
the coal seams, even where sufficient drilling exists, there can be significant quality 
variation between drill holes. 
 
13.3 PROPERTY COAL QUALITY 
 
Table 4 represents Summit's estimate of the composite anthracite coal quality on the coal 
seams within the Good Spring Property area using data from EmberClear's drilling 
program as of September 2, 2011.  The values in Table 4 could be good representative 
average values of the coal quality of the Good Spring Property evaluated by Summit, but 
further exploration and testing would be needed to verify this.  The results listed in Table 
4 are on a dry basis.

ITEM 14 MINERAL POTENTIAL TONNAGE ESTIMATES 
 
14.1 DATA SOURCES AND MODELING METHOD 
 
EmberClear, PADEP and PAGS supplied the geologic data that was used in the potential 
tonnage estimates by Summit. This data primarily consisted of prospect information 
from: previous drilling programs; USGS Professional Paper 602; and EmberClear's 
current drilling program, notations, seam mapping, prior reserve reports, geologic 
columnar sections and exploratory drill holes. This information was supplied mainly in 
digital and paper format. Copies of most of the original drillers' logs and drillhole quality 
analysis were also acquired.

Graphic stratigraphic columns were generated for all exploration holes located on the 
property and coal seam correlations were established using cross-sectional techniques.  
Geophysical logs, when available, were used to provide verification of seam correlation.  
The correlated coal seams were tagged in a digital lithologic database, which was then 
used in conjunction with other available coal thickness data to generate coal thicknesses 
for each coal seam of interest.  
 
To determine the thickness of each coal seam to use for the low end range and the high 
end range, an analysis was completed.  All known thicknesses obtained from the data 
utilized have been placed in Table 3 (page 41).  The number of thicknesses for each coal 
seam was then separated in half.  The lower half of the thicknesses was averaged and that 
number was used for the low range thickness number.  The upper half of the thickness 
was averaged and that number was used for the high end range thickness number.  If 
there were an odd number of known thicknesses for a coal seam, the middle thickness 
was used in the average of both the low end range and the high end range.  All 
thicknesses used are estimated true thicknesses. 
 
The coal volumetric calculations were determined by using the axial length of the 
projected middle of the coal seam along the presumed location of the coal seam, 
indicated in cross section, times the seam width within the property perpendicular to the 
cross section times the average coal thickness.  For coal seams not outcropping on the 
Good Spring Property the cross sectional area was truncated at the property line.  For coal 
seams that have previously been mined, the linear distance along the cross section of the 
coal seam was adjusted based on the mine maps.  The axial length of the project middle 
of the coal seam and the seam width the property perpendicular to the cross section is 
shown by Sections L, M and N on Figures 14 (page 72) and 15 (page 73). The above 
cross sections and their locations have been taken from the USGS - Miscellaneous 
Geological Investigations Map(s) I-528; Sheet 3 of 6, sheet 4 of 6 and sheet 6 of 6. 
 
Then a factor of ninety (90) pounds per cubic foot coal density was used to calculate the 
coal seam potential tonnage. 
 
Table 3 (page 41) shows the known thicknesses for each coal seam, the low range 
thickness used in the calculations, the high range thickness used in the calculations, the 
axial length of each coal seam and the width of each coal seam used in calculating the 
low range tonnage and high range tonnage shown in Table 3 (page 41).  The estimated 
areas that have been deep mined in the Good Spring Property have been removed from 
the seam width distances. 
 
Furthermore, digital terrain models of surface topography were created and utilized for 
the Summit report. Surface topography information was downloaded from the USGS GIS

database in DEM format for each quadrangle. This data was converted to the NAD 83, 
Pennsylvania South coordinate system and surface grids for the project area were built to 
allow currently existing ground contours to be generated in cases were ground contours 
were needed. 
 
Summit believes its estimates of potential tonnage classifications as reported here in this 
report are 43-101 compliant. Summit used all of the information available to them to 
prepare this report. The maps used in this report were designed by Summit.

14.2 MINERAL POTENTIAL TONNAGE CALCULATION PARAMETERS 
 
Potential tonnage on the Good Spring property was classified as deep mineable potential 
tonnage. 
The deep mining potential tonnage criteria are:   
• The minimum deep mining potential tonnage block is 250,000 tons, considered on a 

case-by-case basis.   
• Ninety (90) pounds per cubic foot coal density is used to calculate the in-situ tonnage 

of coal. 
 
14.3 RESULTS OF POTENTIAL TONNAGE ESTIMATION 
 
Based on the property's complex geology, none of the potential tonnage can be classified 
as resources because the tonnage does not meet the requirements of the Geological 
Survey of Canada (GSC) Paper 88-21; or as reserves because neither a preliminary 
feasibility nor feasibility study has been completed on the project. 
 
A summary of results for the potential tonnage study conducted by Summit is shown in 
Table 6 (page 82) for the Good Spring Property.  The potential tonnage estimates in this 
report are broken down in amounts according to coal seams.   
 
The results of the potential tonnage are based on the existing state and federal 
environmental laws and regulations as of the date of this NI 43-101 report.  There are no 
known environmental laws, permitting guidelines or state or federal regulations that 
would affect the estimated potential tonnage. 
 
Potential tonnage for the Four Foot, Lykens Valley #3, and Lykens Valley #6 coal seams 
were not included in the estimated total of potential tonnage.  No existing borehole or 
geologic data could be found to demonstrate that these coal seams are present within the 
Good Spring Property.  However, with further exploration these coal seams maybe 
identified and included in the potential tonnage category.

At this time, due to insufficient exploration, the Potential Tonnage Estimates stated in 
Table 6 are conceptual in nature and cannot be defined as a mineral resource.  It is 
uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral 
resource.

ITEM 18   PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
There is an existing infrastructure available to the Good Spring Property.  Vehicular 
access to the property is via Interstate 81 and State Route 125.  The Reading and 
Northern Railroad system has rail lines that connect the property to the ports on the 
Atlantic Ocean.  Electrical power is abundant in the area. 
 
 
ITEM 19   MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 
 
The Department of Energy (DOE) short term outlook for US coal consumption projects 
that increases in electricity demand and natural gas prices will contribute to coal 
regaining a larger share of base load generation in 2011. According to the DOE, nearly 
4,300 megawatts of new coal-fired generators will be online by the end of 2011, which 
will add to the demand for thermal coal. Projected coal consumption in the electric power 
sector increased by almost three percent in 2010. A seven percent overall increase is 
projected by 2011 to meet continued growth in consumption and exports. 
 
Long term coal production, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) is 
projected to vary based on different assumed policies with regard to greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions. The no GHG concern case illustrates a sizable increase in coal 
production. In 2030, coal production in the no GHG concern model is twenty (20) percent 
higher than in other models. The impact on long term coal use would depend on details of

policies such as the allocation of emissions allowance and the inclusion of policies to 
encourage the use of other fuels.    
 
In any case, electric power consumption in the US is forecast to increase by one percent 
per year through the year 2030. The use of coal fired electricity generation is only 
projected to decrease moderately from 49% to 47% by 2030. 
 
The Anthracite coal found on the Good Spring Property has the potential to be sold into 
the iron and steel making industry as pulverized coal injection (PCI). 
 
While the United States (U.S.) has experienced consistent coal production and growth, 
some projections show a decline over the next several years as many mines exhaust their 
better reserves.  Coal operators, particularly underground operators will have to deal with 
the burden and costs of additional compliance due to the poor safety performance of 
some. Also, surface mine operations will deal with continued pressure from 
environmental activists and the courts.   Higher compliance costs may in fact force some 
operators to close thus freeing up manpower and equipment for those who remain in 
business.   
 
Economic growth in emerging Asia is expected to be a driver of large increases in 
thermal and metallurgical coal.  Through 2015, approximately 390 gigawatts of new coal-
fueled generation are expected to be built globally, requiring 1.2 billion tones of annual 
coal supply.  Global steel production is expected to rise more than 30 percent during that 
time, requiring approximately 300 million tones of additional metallurgical coal supply 
annually. 
 
At the time of the preparation of this Technical Report, EmberClear had not executed any 
coal sales agreements for the future anticipated production from the Good Spring 
property. Coal delivery to customers from the Good Spring property will be via truck, rail 
or seaborne.  
 
  
ITEM 20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR        
COMMUNITY IMPACT 
 
20.1 GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Recent issues related to the coal industry such as the Sago mine disaster, the Upper Big 
Branch mine disaster, selenium issues, the Clean Water Act and the controversy 
surrounding mountain top/surface mining have led to renewed interest by lawmakers and 
environmental activists.

The subject property is located within the regulatory jurisdictional boundaries of the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Baltimore District.  While the Baltimore District has 
not faced the legal challenges from environmental groups regarding surface mining 
Section 404 permits as has the USACE Huntington District, the Baltimore District has 
likely been affected by the lawsuits.  The Huntington District has been the subject of 
numerous lawsuits filed by environmental groups regarding issued permits as well as 
programmatic procedures such as the issuance of Public Notices of Section 404 
Individual Permits.   
 
While the government has routinely lost at the federal District Court level, the decisions 
have typically been appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals (Pennsylvania is 
located in the Third Circuit). Typically, the lower court decisions have been overturned. 
However, due to the time lapse between the lower court decision and the appeals court 
reversal, USACE has changed their policies and procedures making the process less 
efficient.  The changes to policies and procedures have not been limited to the 
Huntington District as other districts regulating surface coal mining have typically 
implemented the changes to some extent.   
 
Nationwide Permit 21 (NWP 21), which was most recently issued by USACE on March 
18, 2007 to regulate Surface Coal Mining Activities was suspended on June 18, 2010 in 
the Appalachian regions of Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and 
West Virginia.  Therefore, the only permitting avenues for surface mining activities at 
this time in these areas are Section 404 Individual Permits or Nationwide Permit 49 if the 
project is re-mining and meets the strict acreage requirements of this permit. 
 
On February 16, 2011, USACE published in the Federal Register its proposal to re-issue 
NWPs for another 5 year term (Fed. Reg. Vol. 76, No. 32, pp. 9174 - 9207).  Although 
the current version of NWP 21 is suspended, USACE proposed issuance of a restricted 
version of NWP 21.  USACE offered three options for comment as part of the Federal 
Register notice: 
 

1. Do not reissue NWP 21. 
2. The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than ½ acre of non-tidal waters of 

the United States including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, 
unless for intermittent and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 
300 linear foot limit.  This NWP would not authorize discharges of dredged or fill 
material into waters of the United States associated with the construction of valley 
fills.   

3. The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than ½ acre of non-tidal waters of 
the United States, including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, 
unless for intermittent and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 
300 linear foot limit.

NI 43-101 Technical Report –EmberClear Reserves Inc. 
October 25, 2011   86  
 

Option 2 is preferred by USACE.  This option would not authorize the construction of 
valley fills in jurisdictional waters but would provide a direct avenue for the construction 
of ponds, stream or road crossings, etc.  The new NWPs should be issued prior to 
expiration of the current NWPs (March 18, 2012). 
 
In addition to the obstacles facing Section 404 permitting associated with litigation and 
adverse court decisions in West Virginia, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) has recently taken a greater role in permitting.  The agency has routinely 
commented on proposed projects and threatened the veto of several Section 404 permits.  
The agency's objections center on stream impairment, proposed mitigation, and water 
quality, specifically conductivity and total dissolved solids.  Pennsylvania is subject to 
the same EPA region (Region 3) that has been very actively involved in West Virginia 
and recently used its veto authority to revoke the previously issued Section 404 permit for 
the Spruce No. 1 Mine in Logan County, WV.     
 
EPA has essentially forced coal companies to accept very extensive and expensive water 
and benthic monitoring programs in exchange for release of Section 404 permits for 
surface mining activities.  These monitoring plans have typically included a conductivity 
threshold that increases the monitoring frequency and requires best management practices 
be implemented if surpassed.  
 
EPA has also begun conducting a review of all Section 404 applications for compliance 
with the Clean Water Act Section 404 (b) (1) Guidelines and avoidance of impacts on 
downstream water quality. The focus on water quality impacts may lead to extensive 
operational changes, including but not limited to selective handling of strata, fill 
compaction, increased water monitoring, and water quality remediation. EPA's 
involvement in the Section 404 permitting process will lead to a more expensive 
permitting process with no certainty of permit issuance. 
 
EPA's interest in water quality is not limited to Section 404 permitting.  The agency has 
also been very involved in the permitting of wastewater discharges (Section 402 or 
NPDES permits).  EPA has oversight authority of states with primacy programs to issue 
NPDES permits.  EPA has routinely commented on or objected to these permits.   
 
In December 2008, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) 
issued a statement regarding the 100 foot stream buffer zone rule. This rule attempts to 
clarify that the 100 foot buffer zone does not apply to hollow fills.  However, this new 
rule will require a fill minimization plan to document that the stream impacts have been 
minimized. The fill minimization routine is currently being assessed by OSM, USACE, 
and the coal industry for use in Kentucky Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act 
(SMCRA) permits.

On December 22, 2008, on behalf of 8 environmental groups, a lawsuit was filed in D.C. 
District Court challenging approval of the 100 foot stream buffer zone rule. The suit 
names the United States Department of the Interior, OSM, and the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as defendants. Two claims are filed against 
each agency alleging that the rule fails to explain alternatives and that it violates both 
SMCRA and the Clean Water Act (CWA).  
OSM is currently preparing a revised stream buffer zone rule. 
 
On June 11, 2009 the USACE, DOI, and the EPA entered into a Memorandum of 
Understanding regarding oversight of Appalachian surface coal mining projects. The 
memorandum required the USACE and EPA to take the following steps by the end of 
2009: 
• Issue a public notice to preclude use of Nationwide Permit 21 for authorization of 

discharge of dredged or fill material into streams for surface coal mining. 

• USACE and EPA, in coordination with United States Fish and Wildlife Services, will 
develop guidance to strengthen the environmental review of surface coal mining 
projects under the Clean Water Act Section 404 (b) (1) guidance. 

• Work with the states to strengthen oversight and review of Section 401 water quality 
certification and Section 402 NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination 
System) permits. 

• Develop guidance regarding evaluation of impacts to streams and evaluation to

• Clarify applicability of waste treatment exemption. 
 

By the end of 2009, DOI was to have taken the following steps under the memorandum: 
 
• If stream buffer zone rule is vacated, issue guidance clarifying application of the 

1983 stream buffer zone provisions. 
 

• The OSM will re-evaluate and determine how to more effectively conduct oversight 
of the states. 
 

• The OSM will remove impediments to its ability to require correction of state 
application permit deficits.  
 

Again, the design and permit methodology along with mining practices for large scale 
surface mines are likely to be impacted by increased timing and costs. Mining 
professionals to date have been able to find a means of meeting the requirements of both

the regulations and the courts in order to continue mining in a reasonable and cost 
effective way. 
 
20.2 SITE-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

According to the Appalachian Regional Commission, Schuylkill County is an 
Appalachian county.  Therefore, NWP 21 is not currently valid to authorize surface 
mining activities within the project area.  Any proposed impact to jurisdictional waters 
would require authorization under NWP 49 if a re-mining project or a Section 404 
Individual Permit.     
 
The subject property is located along Good Spring Creek of Swatara Creek, a tributary of 
the Susquehanna River.  Based on Pennsylvania's 2010 303(d) list, Good Spring Creek is 
an impaired stream for siltation and metals.  The suspected source of both impairments is 
Abandoned Mine Drainage.  Because the stream is impaired for mining related pollutants, 
any new discharge to the impaired stream will require a Section 402 Individual Permit as 
Pennsylvania's NPDES General Permit for coal mining is not valid for discharges to 
impaired streams.   
 
The projected deep mining on the Good Spring Property could proceed without the need 
for USACE 404 permits.

ITEM 25   INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
While compiling the information in this NI 43-101, Summit has reached the following 
interpretations and conclusions: 
 
Summit's potential tonnage evaluation indicates that there is a range of approximately 
100 million to 216 million potential tons on the Good Spring Property.  At this time, due 
to insufficient exploration, the Potential Tonnage Estimates stated are conceptual in 
nature and cannot be defined as a mineral resource.  It is uncertain if further exploration

will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.  However, with further 
exploration the potential tonnage may be expanded. 

 
• Potential tonnage for the Four Foot, Lykens Valley #3 and Lykens Valley #6 coal 

seams were not included in the estimated total of potential tonnage because no 
existing borehole or geologic data could be found to demonstrate that these coal 
seams are present within the Good Spring Property.  However, with further 
exploration these coal seams maybe identified. 
 

• In Table 2 (page 27), Summit estimated the reclamation liabilities for the one (1) 
permit owned by Summit Anthracite, Inc.  The permit number is 54851336 and the 
total reclamation surety bonding is approximately $47,000.00.  By acquiring mining 
permit number 54851336, EmberClear will obtain permitted deep mine potential 
tonnage, access to a preparation plant and a unit train loadout facility. 

 
 
ITEM 26   RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
The information, as reviewed, along with historical coal production on the Good Spring 
Property and adjacent properties warrants further drilling to establish potential tons, coal 
quality and to potentially reclassify coal into the resource category. To accomplish these 
goals the following is recommended: 
 

1) Complete the current exploration/drilling within the Good Spring Property to 
firm up the potential tonnage and coal quality within the property.  Locations 
of the holes to be completed in the current program can found on Figure 12 
(page 60).  

2) Evaluate the results of the current exploration program on the Good Spring 
Property and update the potential tonnage base and the coal quality. 

3) Contingent upon the successful estimation of coal resources following the 
current exploration program perform a scoping level study and a preliminary 
economic assessment. 

4) If warranted, based on results of the current drilling program and a scoping 
level study, complete the proposed drill holes indicated as future drill holes on 
the illustration labeled "Future Exploration Holes", located in Appendix A of 
this report.  This program includes the data spacing required under the 
Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) Paper 88-21 that could bring the 
potential tonnage up to an indicated resource classification. 

5) Continue to pursue the necessary PADEP permit amendment to add deep 
mine potential tonnage to mining permit number 54851336.
