3.0 SUMMARY

At the request of Mr. Alan Matthews, President of Kernow Resources & Developments Ltd.

on behalf of Kernow-St Elias Joint Venture, WAI were engaged to prepare a Mineral

Resource estimation in compliance with National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101), on the

Gralheira gold-silver property in northern Portugal. WAI also visited the property during

which time the underground adit was inspected, drill core facility was visited, core inspected

and samples removed for check assaying.

Gralheira consists of an anastomosing network of easterly trending quartz veinlets, generally

narrower than 30cm, within a 20 to 30m wide shear zone in Late Paleozoic mica schist.

Concentration of gold-bearing veinlets in the shear zone varies from trace to about 10%.

The Gralheira Prospect, which forms the subject of this report, has been explored by drilling

(126 holes totalling 23,799m for 3,623 samples) and underground sampling from a 350m

long adit and 7 crosscuts aggregating about 200m.

Based on the site visit, review of technical information filed on Sedar (including 3 previously

submitted 43-101 reports, most recently by Brophy in 2005) and the preliminary resource

modelling exercise, a resource estimate has been produced which the author has included in

this report. Since the previous submission (Brophy 2005) a total of 10 drill holes and 5,220m

have been completed and the geological database, as recommended by Brophy (2005), has

also been generated as part of the resource estimation contained in this report.

The property is owned 100% by Kernow Mining Portugal – Prospecc áo Mineria, Sociedade

Unipessoal Ltd., (certificate number 506150348, dated May 8, 2002) a wholly owned

Portuguese subsidiary of Kernow Resources and Developments Ltd. on behalf of the

Kernow-St Elias Joint Venture.

Kernow Resources and Developments Ltd, on behalf of the Kernow-St Elias Joint Venture

and Kernow Mining, are holders of the Experimental Mining Licence. St Elias Mines Ltd

have fulfilled the obligations of an Optionee agreement and earned a 51% interest in the

property. They have sent notice to Kernow declaring that they will not take up the second

option to acquire a further 24% interest in the property.

The Property is currently held as an Experimental Mining Licence MNCEX0106 assigned and

granted to Kernow Mining Portugal Prospecc áo Mineria, Sociedade Unipessoal Ltd., on

May 25, 2007 for a period of 3 years.

Under the terms of the contract Kernow is required to expend 750,000 over the life of the 3

year contract by completing work programmes as defined and shown in Appendix 1.



WAI/61-0465 2 15
th
January 2008

During October/November 2007 a resource model and estimation was completed for the

Gralheira gold deposit by Wardell Armstrong International (WAI). The work completed during

this exercise can be summarised as follows:

Input and validation of Kernow drilling data including the most recent 23 drill holes

(2005) to form an up to date sample database;

Input and validation of underground adit assay data (not including that from raise

and cross-cuts);

Inclusion of all drill hole data in the wireframe model;

Examination of the pre-2005 intersections, minor, re-interpretation of structure in

order to exclude low grade samples from the wireframe model;

Creation of a geological block model; and

Resource evaluation.

Three-dimensional models of the FA, F1, F2 and F3 mineralised zones were generated with

respect to the drill hole and adit data.

In the development of block models, a minimum mining width of 1.2m was applied. For

thicker parts of the mineralised zones, in excess of 2.4m wide, the internal block structure

reflected grade variations on a 1.2m wide basis. The block model structure was rotated so

as to conform to the overall predominant orientation of the mineralised zones.

Evaluation of the deposit, for the 4 modelled mineralised zones, at cut off grades (COG's) of

0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6g/t (with the application of top-cut) is summarised in the table below:

The resources have been classified on the following basis:

Measured resources pertain to a 30m high block of ground around the adit opening;

Indicated resources pertain to blocks of ground which have drill hole intersections at

30 – 50m apart; and

The remainder of the deposit, interpolated using drillholes with a larger search

ellipse, has been allocated as Inferred.

During the interpolation of the grade, a horizontal/vertical anisotropy of 1:2 was applied,

consistent with geostatistical analysis.

A summary of the available resource, as of November 2007, in the combined Measured and

Indicated category at 6g/t COG (with application of top-cut) equates to some 142kt at a

grade of 8.97g/t Au and 34.12g/t Ag and contains 1,276kg (41,010oz) of Au and 4,850kg

(155,924oz) of Ag. The Inferred resource is 159kt at a grade of 8.84g/t Au and 16.00g/t Ag,

which contains 1,409kg (45,310oz) of Au and 2,584kg (83,076oz) of Ag.

Conversely with 0g/t COG the combined Measured and Indicated category equates to some

2,239kt at grade of 2.43g/t Au and 11.80g/t Ag and contains 5,434kg (174,705oz) of Au and

26,423kg (849,504oz) of Ag. The Inferred resource is 7,663kt at a grade of 1.61g/t Au and

8.55g/t Ag, which contains 12,370kg (397,696oz) of Au and 65,515kg (2,106,340oz) of Ag.

The removal of top-cut from the 6g/t cut-off grade produces the following results whereby the

combined Measured and Indicated category equates to some 142kt at grade of 10.88g/t Au

and contains 1,547kg (49,733oz) of Au. The Inferred resource is 159kt at grade of 9.94g/t

Au, which contains 1,586kg (50,984oz) of Au.

5.0 DISCLAMER

WAI has reviewed and evaluated data provided by Kernow and their consultants, relevant to

the Gralheira property, and has drawn its own conclusions therefrom, augmented by its

direct field examination, sampling and assay analysis. WAI has not carried out any

independent exploration work or drilled any holes but has carried out limited check sampling

and assaying of drillhole core.

WAI has estimated the Mineral Resources at Gralheira, and has reviewed previous

estimates (RTZ-BRGM, Brophy), examined the procedures used and reviewed in-house

procedures in arriving at statements. While exercising all reasonable diligence in checking

and confirming them, WAI has relied upon the data presented by Kernow in formulating its

opinion.

The metallurgical, geological, mineralisation, exploration technique and certain procedural

descriptions, figures and tables used in this report are taken from reports prepared by and

provided by Kernow and their consultants. .

WAI has undertaken the resource modelling exercise in accordance with the Australasian

Code for Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves Reporting of Exploration Results (The JORC

Code 2004 Edition), that complies with the Canadian Institute of Mining, (November 14,

2004): CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, necessary to

be compliant with NI 43-101.

Accordingly Mineral Resources have been classified as either Measured, Indicated or

Inferred depending on the density of data, the level of confidence ascribed to the data by the

authors and the results of geostatistical analysis.

6.2 History of the Tenure of the Property Relative to Kernow

The Property (Exploration License CC4-00 19-06-00) was acquired by Kernow by way of a

Purchase Agreement on October 30, 2001 from Target Europe (Spain) S.A. de C.V., a

wholly owned subsidiary of Target Europe Corp, for 800,000 Kernow shares and a further

750,000 Kernow shares upon the commencement of commercial production.



WAI/61-0465 9 15
th
January 2008

The property was subject to the right of acquisition from Target Europe by Tellis Gold Mining

Company. On November 8, 2002 this right was assigned to Kernow by Tellis through the

repayment of Tellis' costs, estimated to be USD$30,729, via a promissory note bearing an

interest rate of 3% per annum which was payable on or before December 31, 2003. This

note was able to be converted to Kernow shares by the election of either party. Kernow

converted the loan in May of 2003. In addition to the repayment of expenditures, Kernow

was obligated to continue funding the on-going drilling expenses estimated to be

USD$34,271 as of October 16, 2001, which was done.

On February 27, 2002 Kernow entered into a letter agreement with St Elias Mines Ltd.

whereby the Company granted St. Elias an option to earn a 51% interest in the Gralheira-

Jales Property. St. Elias could earn this option in consideration of cash payments totalling

CDN$50,000, and incurring exploration expenditures of not less that CDN$1,500,000 and

issuing an aggregate of 500,000 shares over a three year period. The minimum 1st year

expenditure commitment (on or before June 30, 2003) was CDN$400,000 with Kernow as

the operator of the project. In addition, St. Elias could elect to earn a further 24% in the

Property in consideration of additional cash payments totalling CDN$100,000, incurring

additional exploration expenditures of not less that CDN$2,500,000 and issuing an additional

aggregate of 1,000,000 shares over a three year period.

St Elias have fulfilled the obligations of the Optionee agreement and have earned a 51%

interest in the property. They have given notice to Kernow declaring that they will not take up

the second option to acquire a further 24% interest in the property.

15.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY

15.1 Pre-2002

None of the sample preparation methods and analytical details for work conducted by British

Petroleum Minerals and subsequently by RTZ-BRGM are available for review. However, it

has been assumed, as would be expected from these respected organisations, that industry

standards were applied.

15.5 WAI Check Samples

During the site visits WAI collected 8 samples from 7 diamond core drill holes. Samples

were selected by WAI and the core marked before being cut by Kernow Mining using a

diamond saw under the supervision of WAI. All samples were placed in sealed plastic

weave bags and weighed. The samples were couriered to WAI for preparation and

forwarding to SGS (Canada) for laboratory analysis using fire assay techniques. WAI

conducted a separate AAS check analysis on splits from the same samples. All samples

were logged by WAI before being crushed and split. The sample details are shown in Table

15.1 below:

Each sample was prepared in the same manner. An initial crushing stage reduced particle

size to 2mm, the sample was then homogenised and pulverised prior to a 100g sub-sample

being split. The 100g sample was further split with 75g used for Fire Assay and 25g for AAS

analysis. The Fire Assay analysis was undertaken at SGS laboratory in Canada while the

AAS was conducted at the Wheal Jane Laboratory (UK); both facilities are accredited to

ISO9001 and ISO17025 standards.

The sample results and their comparison to previous results are shown in Table 15.2 Below:

The primary WAI check analyses has been conducted by fire assay to replicate the original

assay analysis. WAI has also conducted an internal check analysis (second round) by the

AAS method that shows a very good comparison to the WAI Primary Check Analysis. The

results for the AAS work are shown in Table 15.3 below:

WA08 5.1 12.2 6.0 11.0 15.7 -10.7

The difference in the test results from the AAS analysis is believed to be a consequence of

larger trial sizes being used in the second set. AAS also produces elevated Ag values

(compared to the Fire Assay) and this is suspected to be due to small trial sizes being used

during the original Ag analysis. WAI considers that the AAS analysis be used only as a

measure of 'confidence' and comparison to the more relevant Fire Assay analysis.

As can be seen from the results in Table 15.2 the samples collected by WAI confirmed the

presence of gold mineralisation from the respective samples taken. The absolute values for

gold grade varied between the two sets of data and it appears that a nugget effect may be

responsible for this variation. It is noted that previous sample checks have also identified

variable results. WAI also considers that a percentage of the gold may be refractory and is

reflected in the variability of the two stages of wet (AAS) analysis. Sample size is also likely

to have a bearing on assay repeatability with each stage of assay using a reducing sample

weight. Notwithstanding the variability illustrated in Table 15.2 (+15.8 to -27.3%) WAI is of

the opinion that the check assays confirm the presence of Au and Ag mineralisation at an

acceptable order of magnitude considering the sample size and mineralisation type.

16.0 DATA VERIFICATION

The Gralheira project was visited by Senior WAI personnel in August and September 2007.

During this site visit WAI examined selected diamond drill core from several exploration

programmes, concentrating on the more recent Kernow drill core, and copies of the historical

database and analytical data.

16.1 Pre-2002 QA/QC

None of the analytical methodologies, quality control and other relevant parameters for work

conducted by British Petroleum Minerals and subsequently by RTZ-BRGM are available for

review. However, it would be expected from these respected organisations that the work

was undertaken to industry standards and as such be treated as correct and accurate to the

best knowledge of the author.

16.2 Kernow QA/QC

Core was recovered from the holes by standard wire-line techniques and placed directly in

core boxes before being transported from the drill site to the core-storage facility where it

was logged and sampled.

During Kernow's drill programmes, all drill core submitted for analysis (varying from 0.1 to

1.0m dependent upon geological/mineralisation features) was split with a diamond rock saw

with one half submitted to the analytical lab and the other half retained for future reference.

Subsequent check sampling and testwork have resulted in only quarter core or in some

cases no core remaining for certain intersections. However, in line with industry standard

expectations these sections are documented and noted on the core boxes where applicable.

Samples were weighed and sealed in plastic rice sacks before being transported by

airfreight to Canada. Samples were shipped to ALS Chemex labs in Vancouver and also to

SGS/XRAL Labs in Toronto, both of which are ISO9002-certified companies. All of the

original samples from the T–series holes were submitted to ALS Chemex Laboratories in

Toronto, Ontario.

Kernow submitted 14 samples from the T-series holes and analysed them for gold (1 assay

ton, AA finish) and silver plus 26 elements by ICP. It should be noted that samples T3, 7, 8

and 12 were screened for metallic gold in case there was a nugget gold affect.

For the verification sampling completed by Kernow, four samples were submitted to

American Assay Labs in Reno Nevada and analysed for gold and silver and multi-element

analysis. The general sample preparation methodology utilized by American Assay Labs as

well as the detailed analytical results are also found in Appendix A of Howe 2002.



WAI/61-0465 22 15
th
January 2008

Drilling and sampling of the KMP series' holes was carried out under the direct supervision

of Mr. Alan Matthews, president of Kernow Resources and Developments Ltd. Based on an

inspection of the core, the consistency of assay results with previous campaigns of drilling,

and the quality control/quality assurance procedures detailed herein, this author has no

reason to doubt the integrity of the information generated in this most recent campaign of

drilling.

16.3 Database Checks

From raw data provided to WAI by Kernow a drillhole database was constructed to enable a

resource model and estimate to be constructed. This work is detailed and clarified in

Section 19.0.

16.6 Kernow Sampling QC for the April-August 2005 Sampling Programmes

The following samples were submitted to the SGS Laboratory (Canada) by OMAC for check

assay analysis, and represented a broad spectrum of those taken during the summer 2005

drilling programme. The majority of the samples comprised pulps and are summarised in

In addition ¼ core was taken from the following samples and sent to OMAC for Cyanide

Digestion in an attempt to mitigate any nugget effect. The samples were selected on the

basis that following "visual" inspection, grades reported were lower than expected. The

Sample number K1682 was observed to be anomalous, with laboratory analysis returning

assay values of 7.722g/t Au in the first instance and 6.966g/t Au on a laboratory repeat from

Job Number 05L063/38. There was no visible mineralisation in the core and the values for

As, Zn, and Pb were very low (200ppm). The section of core in question was split to ¼ and

sent for assay as K1682R (Job number 06C008/3). The As, Pb and Zn values were lower

but in line with the original. The gold assay returned 0.184 g/t Au more in line with the core

observation.

As part of the late 2005 check programmes the following samples were selected for re-assay

and forwarded by OMAC to SGS (Canada). The results are listed in Table 16.5 below:

18.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

18.1 Introduction

Previous metallurgical testwork was conducted by RTZ-BRGM and Cogema-EDM in

1989/90 & 1998 and from 1994 to 1998 respectively. In summary it was determined that

gold at Gralheira is free milling and a recovery of around 92% could be expected using

standard flotation technology.

BRGM RTZ produced three reports regarding the metallurgy of the Gralheira ore as detailed

below:

DAM/MIN/89 no 1040- 17 October 1989

DAM/MIN/90 no 600/IR- 18 June 1990

DAM/MIN/90 no 1138- 29 November 1990

RTZ in their Pre feasibility study refers to the information contained in the above studies and

note the following parameters to be applied:

Size of grind d80 = 100 micron (µm)

Ph Natural

Xanthate 200g/t + 20g/t

Pine oil 60 g/t

In addition they outline the Bond Work Index as being 13.63 kWh/short ton and suggest that

the grind size should be d80=125 microns (µm).

The mill flow sheet is proposed with ROM feed to a semi-autogenous mill and the product to

a collection tank to mix with product from a ball mill. Mixed product then passes over a DMS

screen, oversize returns to the ball mill and undersize passes to a conditioning tank and on

to a bank of float cells consisting of 'roughers', 'cleaners' and 'scavengers'. The final product

passes to a thickener tank and water from the thickener is reclaimed. The under flow

passes to a filter and the final product is dried and sent for smelting.

Waste from the last bank of float cells passes to a cyclone designed to split <40µm, which

passes to tailings and >40µm which passes to a thickener. Water from the thickener passes

to water reclamation and the under-flow passes to a cement plant to produce fill for the

stopes.

18.1.1 DAM/MIN/89 no 1040- 17 October 1989

Information from this report was used in the Pre-feasibility study. The tests used two

samples, EM1 and EM2 comprising 49.6kg and 48.2kg respectively, obtained from a

composite of drill core from the J series of holes. The calculated grade of EM1 was 6.55g/t

Au and of EM2 was 10.07g/t Au. EM2 contained a sample from J13 at 133.2g/t Au and from

J 19 at 32.2g/t Au.

Metallurgical and mineralogical examinations were undertaken and tests for gravity

concentration, flotation and cyanidation were completed.

18.1.1.1 Gravity

A two stage test was made, initially with a Wilfley No 2-1/2 size using 25kg of material. The

concentrate from the Wilfley was passed to a smaller Wilfley-Denver 13.A. Both EM1 and

EM2 were tested, though no assay values are given and even though the geologists

observed free gold in the core, none was seen on the tables. It was recommended to

complete another test on a larger (1-10t) sample. Each test produced a concentrate

representing between 0.38% and 1.05% of the mass treated.

18.1.1.2 Flotation

Tests were made at various grind sizes using a composite of EM1 and EM2. Varying pH

values were used. The flotation reagents used were pine oil and AXK.

Using the natural pH of 8.3 recovery of gold for EM1 was 97.8% and 93.4% for EM2. With

the pH adjusted to 6.5 recovery of gold for EM1 was 98.19% and 90.02 % for EM2.

18.1.1.3 Cyanidation

48 hour bottle roll tests were carried out on samples of EM1 (481g) and EM2 (486g). The

samples were ground to 100% passing 100µm and rolled for 48 hours. EM1 showed a

69.23% recovery of gold (silver 23.5%) and consumed 1.49kg/t NaCN. EM2 showed a gold

recovery of 86.78% (silver 93.5%) and consumed 2.2 kg/t NaCN.

Note: these tests were on the ore and not a concentrate.

18.1.2 DAM/MIN/90 no 600/IR- 18 June 1990

This study was a follow up to the previous report and was conducted to optimise the milling

and flotation conditions. These data were again used in the Pre-feasibility study and the

testwork consisted of two composites taken from face samples in the Gallery.



WAI/61-0465 32 15
th
January 2008

Composite 1 used material from samples GR006 through GR035 which when composited

came to a weight of 150kg and a calculated grade of 9.35 g/t. The assayed head grade was

reported by ANAMET in Bristol as 6.52g/t Au and 31.7g/t Ag.

Composite 2 used a selection of samples from the face of the gallery and also a composite

of several of the samples taken "up" the vein in the gallery. This sample assayed at 5.92g/t

Au and 32.8g/t Ag.

Composite 3 was a mixture of samples 2 and 3.

Composite 1 was used for three float tests at varying sizes. The best result was a

Concentrate 157.42g/t for 85.3% recovery at d80=100µm. A note is made in the text that it

is "impossible" with conventional milling to grind below d80=100µm.

Composite 2 was used to determine the Bond Work index of 13.63kWh/short ton.

Composite 3 was not ready for analysis.

18.1.3 DAM/MIN/90 no 1138- 29 November 1990

This study was undertaken to verify that flotation was the best method to apply to the

recovery of gold and silver at Gralheira. The results obtained provide the parameters for the

construction of a pilot plant.

Under the conditions of the operations as defined the following can be noted:

Recovery by weight of concentrate 5 to 8%

Grade of Concentrate 150 g/t Au

Recovery 85 to 90%

The study following up on earlier work is designed to define the best operating parameters

for flotation including:

Grind size

Quality and quantity of reagents

Time of flotation etc.

The report appears to be the continuation of the report DAM/MIN/90 no 600/IR-18 June

1990. The sample composites are described as being the same as those in DAM/MIN/90 no

600/IR- 18 June 1990. It is noted that the samples in Composite 3 comprise samples taken

up the vein.



WAI/61-0465 33 15
th
January 2008

Importantly the grade of Composite 1, analysed by ANAMET and reported as 6.52g/t Au, is

calculated and shown to be 9.35g/t Au by the geological assays and 9.56g/t Au by flotation

and cyanidation in this study. Note is also made that ANAMET had difficulty in arriving at a

grade for Composite 3 with one grade being reported as 17g/t Au.

A mercury amalgamation test was conducted on Composite 3 and results showed a content

of 10g/t and 28g/t indicating the presence of free gold.

Many flotation tests at varying grinds and using varying reagents were conducted with the

following considerations:

The best collector was seen as Amyl Xanthate of Potassium at 120 g/t (KAX);

The use of copper sulphate at 100g/t optimises the recovery to 95%;

The grind is d80 =100µm; and

Grinding times are defined.

Cyanidation of the concentrates was undertaken and 84.5 % recovery was noted.

18.1.4 BP Minerals/Rio Tinto Zinc/BRGM (1985-1990)

The following information is taken almost verbatim from Titaro & Brady (2002), Section

5.3.2.3 BP Minerals/Rio Tinto Zinc/BRGM (1985-1990), iv. Preliminary Metallurgical Testing.

In 1998, the BRGM performed preliminary metallurgical test work on two drill core composite

samples (about 50kg each) from the Gralheira deposit. The two composites, with head

grades of 7.55g/t Au and 9.30g/t Au were each split into several individual samples.

Gravity recovery tests were conducted because the site geologists had reported visible gold

during core logging. For both samples, Wilfley tables, in two stages, were used to produce a

gravity concentrate that yielded no visible gold. It was suggested that much larger samples

(1 - 10t) would be required in order to examine the potential of gravity separation more

accurately.

Flotation tests were conducted on both samples. The aim was to reproduce the conditions

of the Jales' mill, located near Gralheira. In the first instance, tests were conducted at the

natural pH of the sample pulps, 8.3, and the flotation gold recoveries for the two samples

were 98% and 93%. Since the Jales' mill was fed with acidic mine water, its flotation pH was

6.5 and the tests were repeated using sulphuric acid to achieve that pH. The gold

recoveries were 98% and 90%.



WAI/61-0465 34 15

January 2008

The sulphide concentrate contained the following values:

Gold, g/t 144

Silver, g/t 508

Cu, weight % 0.50

Fe, weight % 24.77

Pb, weight % 7.78

Zn, weight % 6.33

As, weight % 6.33

S, weight % 26.52

Bi, weight % 0.067

Sb, weight % <0.001

No attempt was made to optimise the flotation parameters and no work was conducted to

determine the gold recovery attainable from the flotation concentrate. The purpose of this

preliminary work was to determine if floatation works on the gold ores.

Bottle roll tests were conducted to examine the effectiveness of cyanidation on the whole ore

with a grind of 73% minus 80µm. After 48 hours, gold recoveries were 69% and 87% for the

two samples. For the first sample, with a head grade of 88.09 g/t Ag, the silver recovery was

23%. The second sample had a head grade of 7.51 g/t Ag and the silver recovery was 93%.

18.1.5 COGEMA/EDM (1994-98)

Further metallurgical testwork was conducted between 1994-1998 by the Societie des Mines

du Bourneix (Cogema) and Empressa de Desenvolvimento Miniero (EDM). A summary of

this work is presented below;

Cogema-EDM re-sampled the adit faces (presumably the back or floor), obtaining results

that are consistent with, albeit slightly higher grade than, results obtained by RTZ-BRGM,

and calculated an uncut grade of 8.0g/t Au (5.8g/t when cut to 25g/t) across 1.26m along a

length of 349m (the length of the adit). In addition, the crosscuts were sampled to test bulk-

tonnage potential of the deposit. The average grade of the crosscuts is 3.38g/t Au across an

average width of 7.21m.

A series of 8 bulk samples (AM 1 to AM 8) weighing between 170 and 500kg were collected

from the adit at intervals of approximately 50m. Assay results ranged from a low of 1.3g/t Au

to a maximum of 35.0g/t Au. Metallurgical test work was done on two of the bulk samples,

AM 1 and AM 2 (sample details are shown in Table 18.1 below). Six flotation tests on the

first sample yielded recoveries ranging from 98.7% to 99.1%; one test on the second yielded

a recovery of 98.1%. Cyanidation tests done on the flotation concentrates yielded

recoveries of 93.8% to 96.1%.

Cogema further detail the parameters for a milling circuit, based on the treatment of 110ktpa.

The ROM is screened; 'undersize' being crushed and oversize joining a feed belt to cone

crusher. A SAG mill works in a closed circuit with a ball mill and cyclone classifier. A grind

of d80=120µm is stipulated (BRGM stated that the optimum is d80=100µm and that it is

impossible to achieve anything less). Feed from the milling circuit is fed to a conditioning

tank and subsequently to two banks of float cells. The concentrate from the float is fed to a

thickener before being leached in a counter current cyanide leach operation. Feed passes

at 40% solid, it is aerated and kept at pH 11 by the addition of chalk. Liquor is retained for

48 hours.

It is evident that, to date, limited metallurgical testwork has been completed at Gralheira and

although results have suggested a relatively straightforward process route, and promising

recovery values, these should be treated as scoping level at best.

As has been suggested by previous authors there is a considerable amount of metallurgical

testwork to be undertaken at Gralheira to provide the level of confidence required to advance

the project and assist in the conversion of mineral resources to ore reserves.

19.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE

19.1 Introduction

This section is based solely on the preliminary resource estimations undertaken by WAI and

in accordance with the criteria outlined by Kernow Mining.

19.1.1 Work Completed

The initial resource modelling exercise can be summarised as follows:

Input and validation of Kernow drilling data including the most recent 23 drill holes

(2005) to form an up to date sample database;

Input and validation of underground adit assay data (not including that from raise

and cross-cuts);

Inclusion of all drill hole data to generate the wireframe models;

Examination of the pre-2005 intersections, minor re-interpretation of structure in

order to exclude low grade samples from the wireframe models;

Creation of geological block model; and

Resource evaluation and estimation.

19.1.2 Methodology

Three-dimensional models of the FA, F1, F2 and F3 mineralised zones were formed with

respect to the drillhole data. Insignificant alterations in the interpretation were made in order

to exclude low grade samples from the wireframe model.

In the development of block models, a minimum mining width of 1.2m was applied to each of

the identified mineralised bodies FA, F1, F2 and F3. For thicker parts of the mineralised

zones, in excess of 2.4m wide, the internal block structure reflected grade variations on a

1.2m wide basis. The block model structure was rotated so as to conform to the overall

predominant orientation of the ore zones.

The resources have been classified as follows:

Measured resources pertain to a 30m high block of ground around the adit opening;

Indicated resources pertain to blocks of ground which have drill hole intersections

30 – 50m apart; and

The remainder of the deposit, interpolated using drillholes with a larger search

ellipse, has been allocated to the Inferred category.



WAI/61-0465 37 15
th
January 2008

During the interpolation of the grade, a horizontal:vertical anisotropy of 1:2 was applied,

consistent with geostatistical analysis.

19.1.3 Sample Data Processing

19.1.3.1 Drillhole Database

The data base was compiled from the records of various drilling programmes all of which

were then imported to Datamine®, and are summarised in Table 19.1. The "2005 Kernow"

sample set represents the most up to date data.

Total 126 3,623 23,799

Statistical plots have been prepared for these groups of samples (Appendix 3). These show

similar approximately log-normal populations for Au grades.

19.1.3.2 Underground Channel Samples

Two sets of channel samples were obtained, which had been taken by RTZ in the adit on the

695m elevation. One set was obtained for face samples, and another set taken from the

back. Separate statistical plots were also obtained for these two sets of samples, and

indicated similar Au grade populations. It is understood that other underground samples

have been taken, for faces, connecting cross-cuts and raises but have not been included in

the present valuation. It is apparent that the RTZ underground samples seem to be under-

reporting Au grades. However, as these were the only samples currently available that

could be properly spatially positioned, WAI considers it valid to utilise them, and produce

what is probably a conservative resource estimate, in the vicinity of the adit.

The adit channel samples cover a strike length of approximately 360m.

19.1.3.3 Interpretation and Structural Analysis

The current interpretation is based on four specific individual mineralised shear zone vein

structures, generally containing intercepts with a grade greater than 3g/t. The four overall



WAI/61-0465 38 15
th
January 2008

mineralised shear zone structures were identified, demarcated and identified as FA, F1, F2

and F3. Initial allocation of these structures came from identification of specific intersections

by Kernow geologists. Sectional outlines of the orebodies, generated in accordance with

drillhole data, were reviewed and showed that, in some instances, total intersection width

could be reduced and some low grade samples excluded from evaluation. Exclusion of low

grade samples has provided better continuity of the high grade areas inside the wireframe

model and has facilitated an increase in top cutting levels to limit the influence of high grade

outliers.

In general, the most recent 2005 drilling programme supports earlier structural interpretation

insofar as no new mineralised zones have been identified. Minor alterations have been

made within the F3 mineralised zone interpretation on cross sections 9 and 10, and between

cross sections 21 and 22. A summary of the different intersections by section and by drill

hole are summarised in Table 19.2.

The structural interpretations are shown on the sections presented in Appendix 4. The

mineralised zones have generally been extended down-dip for a distance of approximately

50m below the bottom-most intersection. The overall predominant dip of the structures is

±80°, with a strike orientation of approximately 100° (east-west).

Variographic analysis has shown that the strike variograms give a range of 60m and about

double this value for the dip. This anisotropy was applied in the grade interpolation.

For interpolation purposes, 1.2m long composites were created within each defined

intersection. Additional 'complete intersection' composites were also created for

interpolation of the narrow vein portions of each structure.

19.1.5 Geological Modelling

For this resource review a volumetric block model was constructed for the mineralised zone



WAI/61-0465 41 15
th
January 2008

structures. The parent block size selected for these block model structures was 30m

horizontally (along-strike) and 60m vertically. The whole block model system was rotated

10° about the Z-axis, and 10° about the rotated X-axis, so that blocks would be aligned

practically parallel with the vein structures.

Details of the overall model framework are shown in Table 19.5 below:

Table 19.5: Model Prototype

Size Number Extend Origin

X 30 78 2,340 45,571

Y 1.2 200 240 200,240

Z 60 11 660 245

When the initial volumetric block model was created, the overall width of each part of each

mineralised structure also was calculated. Those parts less than 2.4m (double the 1.2m

minimum mining width) were demarcated as 'narrow'. In the subsequent grade interpolation,

these narrow parts were interpolated with complete composites across the nearby

intersections. All other parts were interpolated from 1.2m long composites. Therefore,

overall procedure preserved a cross-structure selectivity of approximately 1.2m.

WAI has used a specific gravity of 2.7t/m
3
but would recommend that the specific gravity is

determined for each vein structures in order to confirm the validity of this value and to adjust

any resource figures as necessary.

The grade interpolation parameters used are summarised in Table 19.6 below:

The classification for Measured resources restricted this category to a small block on the F2

structure, within the vicinity of the underground adit. This block measured approximately



WAI/61-0465 42 15
th
January 2008

300m along-strike and 30m vertically, a total of 15m extended above and below the adit

level.

Automatically produced by the interpolation process, the resource classification provided a

very complicated mosaic of Inferred and Indicated blocks. This was considered as an

unsatisfactory result and an alternative classification was made by manually outlining areas

having 30–50 drill hole intersection spacing and holding most of the automatically Indicated

classified blocks. The rest of the deposit was considered as Inferred. The resultant

classification is represented by solid simple shaped areas of Indicated surrounded by

Inferred, with a small Measured resource proximal to the adit. The total amount of Measured

and Indicated resources defined by this method is 2,239kt Table 19.8 (no COG) which is

almost identical to the automatic classification result of 2,230kt.

In addition, intersections with grades above 0.5g/t, but external to the interpreted structures,

were also extended short distances (7.5m vertically and 15m horizontally) and these blocks

were allocated to Inferred resources.

19.1.6 Resource Evaluation

An evaluation of the resultant block model is summarised in the Table 19.7 overleaf.

The Gralheira resource as of November 2007, in the combined Measured and Indicated

categories at 3g/t COG comprised 599kt at grade of 5.27g/t Au and 23.18g/t Ag and

contained 3,160kg (101,593oz) of Au; 13,890kg (446,567oz) of Ag. The Inferred resources

are 975kt at grades of 4.72g/t Au and 15g/t Ag, which contained 4,597kg (147,786oz) of Au;

As can be seen from the graph presented as Figure 19.2 above, the contained metal (Au)

reduces sharply above a 1.0g/t Au cut-off until it begins to level off at around 5.0g/t. At this

point approximately 1,742kg (56,007oz) Au (Measured and Indicated) and a further 1,409kg

(45,300oz) Au (Inferred) are contained within the resource envelope from 227kt and 149kt

ore respectively. At 0g/t cut-off the contained metal is approximately 5,434kg (174,705oz)

Au (Measured and Indicated) and a further 12,370kg (397,696oz) Au (Inferred).

The result of this analysis is that the current resource estimate contains some 572,401oz Au

at 0g/t cut-off (636,978oz without application of top-cut) and that the 1Moz deposit alluded to

by previous authors is difficult to reconcile against the preliminary model based on the

current database.

21.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

Previous authors have highlighted the dichotomy exhibited by:

o the assay values from underground face/bulk samples when compared

with drill core assay samples; and

o check assaying and replication from drill core samples.

Whilst WAI largely concurs with these views, discrepancies are not uncommon in a

deposit with this style of mineralisation. Equally the bulk sampling data is fairly

limited (in the context of the entire strike length) and in the absence of further

supporting evidence WAI believes that it is not unreasonable to acknowledge the

validity of the drill hole data for preliminary resource estimation at this stage of the

project. Furthermore, if this assessment holds true then the resource estimate

could be considered conservative;

The dichotomies discussed above may be explained by laboratory imprecision due

to the gold often occurring in very narrow (1-3cm) and probably very high-grade

veins. This is supported by crosscut maps that indicate multi-gram gold assays

across 1.2m intervals that include only one 1 to 3cm wide quartz veinlet. The

mineralised part of the entire sample sent to the laboratory is thus so small that it

will likely be missed or underrepresented in the <200g split of the crushed rock that

is typically collected by the laboratory for analysis. This conclusion is also

supported by the large variances (historically as much as >100%) in quarter-core

check assays from drill core;

Nevertheless high grade narrow vein ( 2m) Au deposits generally suffer from high

dilution and a decrease from the resource to reserve phase. What was evident

from inspection of a limited amount of the historical drill core is that some of the

sampled widths in the mineralised zones were probably too large and any

resampling should comprise smaller plies therein. This is particularly relevant to the

RTZ sampling (primarily 1.0m intervals) and to a lesser extent the Cogema stages,

though the latter sampling is more limited. This is illustrated below;



WAI/61-0465 51 15
th
January 2008

Figure 21.1: Preferred Sampling Interval

As can be seen from Figure 21.1 above, some of the Historical Sampling indicates

a wider mineralised intersection though probably at a lower grade due to dilution

from outside the mineralised zone. However, the more recent Kernow sampling (K

series) are much improved with sampling intervals honouring geological boundaries

and intervals down to 0.30m. Nevertheless even within these sampled intervals the

Au may still be carried in narrow (<5cm) quartz veins with the ubiquitous occurrence

of either arsenopyrite, sphalerite and/or galena. Furthermore this sampling clearly

demonstrates that intervals either side of mineralised sections carry little if any Au

grade. In addition to this, if anomalous levels of As, Pb or Zn were noted

'unmineralised' intervals the sample was re-examined and re-assayed if deemed

necessary.

Continuity in grade and width (both along strike and dip) is very dependent on the

density of data, usually from drilling but continuity and grade is better represented

from more reliable underground workings ("drill for structure, drift for grade").

However, with a strike length of some 2km it is logistically difficult at this stage to

undertake underground development to cover the entire deposit, thus continuity is

determined from drill hole data. Nevertheless, grade variability remains an issue

that requires further investigation through underground drifting and drilling before a

more reliable resolution is achieved;

As a result of the above there is generally a low tonnage per vertical metre of the

mineralised body. This often equates to a labour intensive operation with high

development costs that can only be supported by a deposit of sufficient size or

grade;

Check analyses conducted by WAI, and previous consultants, have confirmed the

presence of gold mineralisation, though assay repeatability is sometimes difficult

due to the likely nugget effect and typical morphology of narrow vein gold deposits;



WAI/61-0465 52 15
th
January 2008

Results of the Titan-24 geophysical survey conducted by Quantec Geophysical in

2005 suggest that mineralisation at Gralheira extends to a depth of at least 500m

below surface, and potentially beyond this. This is to some extent supported by the

fact that at the adjacent Jales property mineralisation was mined to a depth of 600m

below surface and remained open. At this stage the preliminary resource estimate

has only been completed to approximately 450m below surface according to the

density of available data and deepest drill hole intersection. However, the majority

of the current resource is located between surface and depths of 250 and 350m, it

should also be noted that there is a paucity of drillhole data at depth in the west of

the deposit;

WAI has undertaken a resource modelling exercise culminating in a resource

estimate undertaken in accordance with the JORC Code (2004). It should be noted

that WAI have only used drill hole and adit data in this resource model and

estimation, the raise and cross-cut data having been excluded.. However, the

result is that the resource estimation in the vicinity of the adit is likely to be rather

conservative;

Three-dimensional models of the FA, F1, F2 and F3 mineralised zones were formed

with respect to the drill hole data. Insignificant alterations in the interpretation were

made in order to exclude low grade samples from wireframe model;

In the development of block models, a minimum mining width of 1.2m was applied

to each of the identified mineralised bodies (FA, F1, F2 and F3). For thicker parts

of the mineralised zones (>2.4m wide) the internal block structure reflected grade

variations on a 1.2m wide basis. The block model structure was rotated so as to

conform to the overall predominant orientation of the ore zones.

The data base was compiled from the records of various drilling programmes all of

which were then imported to Datamine®, a further 2 sets of channel samples (face

and back samples taken by RTZ in the adit on the 695m elevation) were obtained

and imported into the database,:

The current interpretation is based on four specific individual mineralised shear

zone vein structures, generally containing intercepts with a grade greater than 3g/t

Au. The four overall mineralised shear zone structures were identified, and

demarcated, and numbered as FA, F1, F2 and F3. Initial allocation of these

structures came from identification of specific intersections by Kernow geologists.

Sectional outlines (perimeters) of the mineralised zones, generated in accordance

with drill hole data, were reviewed and showed that in some instances total

intersection width could be reduced and some low grade samples excluded from

evaluation. Exclusion of low grade samples has provided better continuity of the

high grade areas inside the wireframe model and has facilitated an increase in top

cutting levels to limit the influence of high grade outliers;

Geostatistical analysis and decile analysis have been used to define the most

appropriate top-cut levels for each mineralised zone structure;

A volumetric block model was constructed for the mineralised zone structures. The



WAI/61-0465 53 15
th
January 2008

parent block size selected for these block model structures was 30m horizontally

(along-strike) and 60m vertically. The whole block model system was rotated 10°

about the Z-axis, and 10° about the rotated X-axis, so that blocks would be aligned

practically parallel with the vein structures;

Automatically produced by the interpolation process, the resource classification

provided a very complicated mosaic of Inferred and Indicated blocks. This was

considered an unsatisfactory result and an alternative classification was made by

manually outlining areas having 30–50 drill hole intersection spacing and holding

most of the automatically Indicated classified blocks;

According to the WAI resource estimation the contained Au (metal content) for

increasing cut-of grades is summarised in Table 21.1 below; and graphically

represented in Figure 21.2 following:

Figure 21.2: Comparison of Contained Metal and Cut-Off Grade



WAI/61-0465 54 15
th
January 2008

As can clearly be seen from the above figure, the contained metal (Au oz) reduces

with the application of a cut-off grade, raising the cut-off grade decreases the

contained metal as lower grade areas are excluded. A cut-off grade is the lowest

grade of material that can be mined and processed considering all applicable costs,

without incurring a loss or gaining a profit. This is only realised when all necessary

technical work has been investigated and the optimum cut-off grade for economic

extraction has been calculated. It should be noted that 'top cut' (also known as

grade capping) is applied to reduce the influence of extreme values on continuity

analyses and grade estimation (see Table 19.4); and

Previous authors (Brophy) have alluded to the possible presence of "higher-grade

steeply raking ore shoots (>5g/t) separated by intervening lower-grade (1 to 4g/t)

material". The preliminary resource modelling conducted by WAI (2007) shows little

evidence for these 'high grade ore shoots' though exclusion of low grade areas

does provide better continuity of the high grade portions of the wireframes.

However, a much greater density of data is likely to be required, with increased

depth to intersections, before this conclusion can be fully realised. Furthermore the

Jales mine was operated to a depth of 600m below surface and is believed to have

focused on higher grade sections.

Following positive results from recent (Kernow) drill core intersections, the Titan-24

geophysical survey and the WAI preliminary resource modelling it is evident that Gralheira is

a deposit that warrants further investigation (through extension to the underground adit and

additional exploration drilling to both test potential extension at depth and to the west and to

infill areas within the current Inferred category to improve confidence) before a worthwhile

technical exercise, in the form of a Scoping/Feasibility Study, is conducted.



WAI/61-0465 55 15

22.0 RECOMMENDATIONS

WAI would make the following recommendations to Kernow Mining:

WAI understands that Kernow Mining intends to proceed with further exploration in

the form of an extension to the adit and further exploration drilling as well as initial

engineering and metallurgical studies leading to a Pre-feasibility study. WAI

supports this conclusion by Kernow Mining for the initial phases;

Based on limited testwork it is suggested that most of the Au is non-refractory,

although associated with elevated levels of As, thus WAI recommends a rigorous

programme of testwork to confirm the processing characteristics of the mineralised

zones. The extension to the adit will permit the taking of the metallurgical samples

that are needed;

At this stage it may also be prudent to investigate rudimentary technical work

(scoping level) in the investigation of associated mining costs, including local labour

and consumables, and the analysis of requirements (equipment, consumables etc.)

for a 300 to 500tpd operation:

WAI has provided Kernow Mining with section and plan views of the block model,

colour coded by confidence category (Measured, Indicated and Inferred). These

should be used to help prioritize the drilling which will be targeted to infill and

upgrade mineral resources and used for the Pre-feasibility study;

Allied to this it is recommended that Kernow undertake further deposit evaluation

and interpretation, both in terms of mineralisation and structure, to enable more

accurate and detailed modelling to be completed and the inclusion of 'hard'

boundaries. This work can be undertaken in parallel to underground drilling and

drifting;

It is also suggested that where possible old core is inspected along the mineralised

intersections recognised in the resource model to assess the implications of

inaccurate sampling intervals. Where possible it is worth re-sampling a more

representative mineralised intersection and then to update the resource

model/estimate; however, this may prove impossible as many of the mineralised

sections have been subjected to numerous re-sampling with only ¼ core, or no core

at all, remaining;

WAI has used a specific gravity of 2.7t/m
3
but would recommend that the specific

gravity is determined for each vein structures in order to confirm the validity of this

value and to adjust any resource figures as necessary;

Several previous authors have highlighted the undervaluing of grade in drill holes

compared to adit bulk sampling. Whilst this is not in dispute the adit sampling is still

limited and requires further investigation, as well as extension to the adit, to be

completely comparable and representative. It should also be remembered that

although additional sampling (be it from drill hole or adit) should improve confidence

levels and variography it is likely to alter grade and interval/thickness i.e. updated



WAI/61-0465 56 15
th
January 2008

resources as a result of increased data may increase or decrease;

WAI concur with Brophy (2005) that an extension to the adit system to the west, of

some 350m is warranted along with cross-cuts at 50m intervals as well as the

recommendation for complete re-mapping and re-sampling of the existing adit

system;

Determining a significant amount of Measured resource at Gralheira will require a

considerable amount of drilling as well as extension to the adit system. However, it

is WAI's belief that a significant amount of Measured resource will likely not be

needed for a Pre-feasibility study, though additional drilling will improve future

variogram modelling. It would be more prudent to concentrate on the areas of

Inferred resources in an attempt to improve confidence and thence classification;

and

With a now complete resource model and sample/assay database it is possible for

Kernow to update resources as more data becomes available. WAI is of the

opinion that the project still requires further and detailed resource evaluations to be

continued and, subject to positive exploration results could develop into a viable

small-scale mining project.

WAI has reviewed the exploration programmes' results for the Gralheira property and

estimated a mineral resource for the deposit. In light of the observations made herein it is

WAI's opinion that the Gralheira project merits further exploration and, pending positive

results should progress further with engineering studies leading to a Pre-feasibility study.

current as of 7

December 2007. The information concerning the mineral resource estimate

is current as of 7
