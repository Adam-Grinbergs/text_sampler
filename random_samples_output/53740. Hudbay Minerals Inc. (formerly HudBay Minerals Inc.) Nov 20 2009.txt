1 SUMMARY 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

INTRODUCTION 

Hudson Bay Mining & Smelting Co., Limited (HBMS), a wholly owned 

subsidiary of HudBay Minerals Inc. (HudBay), completed this technical report on 

the Lalor deposit, near Snow Lake, Manitoba for HudBay that conforms to the 

CIM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves definitions referred to in National 

Instrument (NI) 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. HudBay is 

an integrated Canadian mining company that produces zinc, copper, gold, silver, 

and zinc oxides from mines and plants in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario and 

Michigan. Hudson Bay Exploration and Development Company Limited (HBED) 

performs the mineral exploration tasks on behalf of HudBay. 

 

This report represents an update of information pertaining to the Lalor deposit 

previously disclosed in a NI 43-101 report dated September 19, 2008. Additional 

drilling has resulted in a large portion of the zinc rich base metal Inferred 

resources being converted to Indicated resources and the first time disclosure of 

a conceptual estimate on the potential gold zones at Lalor.  

 

HudBay's operations in Flin Flon, Manitoba include the 777 Mine, Trout Lake 

Mine, ore concentrator, zinc plant, and copper smelter. Operations in Snow Lake, 

Manitoba, include the Chisel North Mine on care and maintenance and a 

mothballed ore concentrator both anticipated to reopen in early 2010. Lalor is 

located approximately 18 km by road west of the town of Snow Lake, Manitoba.  

 

In 2007 Lalor was considered primarily a zinc deposit with local copper, gold, 

silver and lead mineralization that occurs along a stratiform sulphide horizon. 

Since discovery in 2007, a total of 86 parent holes, 49 wedge offsets and 

numerous holes were deepened on the property and have identified the potential 

for extensive gold zones in addition to the zinc rich mineral resources. 

 

Mineralization of the zinc rich base metal zones occur as disseminated to 

solid sulphides consisting of medium to coarse grained sphalerite, pyrite and 

chalcopyrite with lesser amounts of galena and arsenopyrite. Precious metal 

intersections of the Lalor potential gold zones contain low amounts of iron

NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 1-2 

sulphide (4% to 5% on average) that is in the form of pyrite, pyrrhotite and 

chalcopyrite. Generally minor amounts of galena and sphalerite occur. 

 

HudBay owns 100% of the interest in the property, through a group of five 

contiguous HBED claims and eight HBMS mineral leases.  

 

The mineral resource and potential gold conceptual estimates were prepared 

by Robert Carter, P. Eng., HBMS Senior Mines Analyst, who is a Qualified 

Person as per NI 43-101 under the direct supervision of Kimberley Proctor, 

P.Geo., HBMS Superintendent Mines Technical Services, also a Qualified 

Person as per NI 43-101. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

The mineral resource estimate for the Lalor Deposit is compliant with 

regulations and guidelines set out in NI 43-101. The results of this estimate, 

which covers six separate lenses of mineralization, are shown in Table 1-1 

below.

Notes:  
1. CIM definitions were followed for the estimation of mineral resources. 
2. Mineral resources are estimated at ZNEQ cut-off of 4% (ZNEQ% equals Zn% + Cu% x 

2.352 + Au g/t x 0.867 + Ag g/t x 0.014) and a minimum two metre true width. 
3. Long term $US metal prices of $700/oz gold, $12.00/oz silver, $2.00/lb copper and   

$0.85/lb zinc were used for the estimation of ZNEQ. 
4. Metal recovery assumptions of 65% gold, 60% silver, 90% copper and 90% zinc were 

used for the estimation of ZNEQ. 
5. Specific gravity measurements were taken on a large portion of the samples, where 

actual measurements were not available stoichiometric values were calculated. 

 

In addition to the mineral resources at Lalor, a conceptual estimate of the 

potential gold zones outside the mineral resources was completed. The potential 

gold zones are conceptual in nature and to date there has been insufficient 

exploration to define a mineral resource compliant with NI 43-101. It is uncertain

if further exploration will result in the target deposit being delineated as a mineral 

resource. The results of this potential gold zones estimate by zone are shown in 

Table 1-2.

In the opinion of the author the drilling information was acquired using 

procedures that meet or exceed industry best practices. HBED and HBMS 

personnel were diligent in monitoring quality control assaying results. 

 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

The author makes the following recommendations: 

 

1. Continue with current QA/QC program and closely monitor the gold 
assay results at the HBMS laboratory and the third party laboratory. 

 
2. Continue with the bulk density measurements of the drill core. 

 
3. Continue with "Activities at the Lalor Deposit" 

 

ACTIVITIES AT THE LALOR DEPOSIT 

The following activities are proceeding on the Lalor deposit: 

 

1. An approximate 10% of the samples assayed by Acme as part of 
the gold assay program completed in September 2009 are being 
prepared for shipment to an additional third party laboratory for 
verification.

2. On October 8, 2009 HudBay approved an $85 million expenditure 
to fund the Lalor project Phase 1, which is a production ramp from 
its Chisel North mine to the Lalor deposit. The ramp is expected to 
provide early production of zinc-rich material and access to the 
potential gold zones for additional underground exploration. 
HudBay also plans to complete a pre-feasibility study by the end of 
this year and a feasibility study in 2010.  

 
3. A diamond drill program from surface is underway to test the 

potential gold zones variability and continuity of a 100 m by 100 m 
area on 25 m drill hole spacings. This drilling program is estimated 
to be completed by December 31, 2009 with 9,600 m at a cost of 
$2.5 million. 

 
4. Ongoing exploration efforts are underway to identity additional 

mineralization and define extensions to current mineralization. A 
program of 6,100 m is planned to test this potential from October to 
December 2009 at a cost of $1.5 million. 

 

TECHNICAL SUMMARY 

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

The Lalor deposit is located approximately 18 km by road west of the town of 

Snow Lake, Manitoba. The nearest larger centres (5,000+) are Flin Flon (215 

km), The Pas (200 km) and Thompson (230 km), all accessible by paved 

highway. The nearest full service commercial airport is located at Baker's 

Narrows, near Flin Flon, approximately 200 km from Lalor. The nearest 

international airport is located in Winnipeg, approximately 700 km from Snow 

Lake. There is no rail in the immediate area of Lalor or Snow Lake. The nearest 

rail access is at Wekusko siding, approximately 65 km southeast of Lalor. 

 

LAND TENURE 

HudBay owns a 100% interest in the property. Five contiguous claims held by 

HBED encompass the majority of the Lalor deposit and the southerly up-plunge 

extension of the mineralization lies within eight HBMS mineral leases. The five 

HBED claims cover an area totaling 765 ha and are in good standing. The eight 

Order in Council (OIC) HBMS mineral leases total 152 ha.

SITE INFRASTRUCTURE 

The only infrastructure at the Lalor site is an exploration road. 

 

HBMS owns an ore concentrator approximately 18 km from Lalor, currently 

mothballed and is anticipated to reopen in early 2010. The mill operated five days 

per week at 1,300 short tons per milling day, processing ore from the Chisel 

North Mine. The mill has two circuits, with design capacities of 1,000 stpd and 

2,400 stpd. 

 

HBMS has a permitted tailings storage facility at Anderson Lake, located 

approximately three kilometres from the Snow Lake concentrator and 18 km from 

Lalor. As of December 2006, using a modified deposition plan, tailings remaining 

capacity was estimated at 7.5 million tonnes.  

 

HBMS operates a mine water pump station for the Chisel North Mine area at 

the north end of Chisel Lake. The pipeline from this pump station follows 

Provincial Road (PR) #395 and terminates approximately three kilometres from 

Lalor at the Chisel North minesite. There is a parallel recirculating line used to 

prevent freezing. The pump station typically operates at 130 USgpm during 

winter when Chisel North Mine was in full production and provided mine process 

water and wash water for the mine. 

 

In addition, HBMS recently commissioned a 2,000 USgpm water treatment 

plant at Chisel Lake, approximately seven kilometers by road from Lalor. The 

treatment plant is being operated at 1,000 USgpm (peak 1,600 USgpm) to treat 

Chisel North Mine discharge water and water from the Chisel Lake open pit. Both 

water sources contain elevated suspended and dissolved metals which require 

pH adjustment. Treated water is discharged to the environment south of the 

Chisel Lake open pit. 

 

Manitoba Hydro services the Chisel Lake Mine area with a 110 kV overhead 

transmission line, running approximately parallel with PR #395. Voltage is 

stepped down to 6,000 V using an HBMS-owned substation at the termination of 

the Manitoba Hydro line. The HBMS substation was installed in the 1950s. 

 

Power from the main substation is stepped up to 21 kV using a modern 

substation and is fed to the Chisel North minesite via a four kilometre long

overhead transmission line. Power is stepped down to 4,160 V / 550 V at the 

Chisel North substation, located at the Chisel North minesite.  

 

HBMS operates a zinc and copper metallurgical plant in Flin Flon, Manitoba, 

approximately 215 km from Lalor. Present capacities are 115,000 tpa refined zinc 

and 80,000 tpa copper anode. Copper anode is refined at HudBay's White Pine 

refinery in Michigan. 

 

HISTORY 

The Snow Lake area has a long exploration and mining history. Exploration in 

the Chisel Basin has been active since 1955. The Chisel Basin area is a large 

geologically controlled area and has hosted producing mines for nearly 50 years. 

HBMS has played an integral part in this history since the late 1950s by operating 

nine mines in the area including Photo Lake, Rod, Chisel Lake and Chisel Open 

Pit, Stall Lake, Osborne Lake, Spruce Point, Ghost Lake, Anderson Lake, and 

Chisel North.  

 

The Snow Lake concentrator was commissioned in 1979 and operated 

continuously until shutdown in early 1993 as a result of the depletion of the 

Chisel Open Pit and Stall Lake mines. The concentrator was reopened in 1994 to 

process ore from the Photo Lake Mine and continued to process ore from the 

Chisel North Mine until February 2009. Anticipated reopening is in early 2010.  

 

In early 2007, drill hole DUB168 was drilled almost vertically to test a 2003 

surveyed Crone Geophysics deep penetrating pulse electromagnetic anomaly 

and intersected a band of conductive mineralization between 781.74 m and 

826.87 m (45.13 m). Assay results show 0.30% Cu and 7.62% Zn over the 45.13 

m, including 0.19% Cu and 17.26% Zn over 16.45 m. Drilling at Lalor has been 

continuous since the discovery of mineralization on the property. 

 

GEOLOGY 

REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The Lalor property lies in the eastern (Snow Lake) portion of the 

Paleoproterozoic Flin Flon Greenstone Belt and is overlain by a thin veneer of 

Pleistocene glacial/fluvial sediments. Located within the Trans-Hudson Orogen, 

the Flin Flon Belt consists of a variety of distinct 1.92 to 1.87 Ga 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 1-7 

tectonostratigraphic assemblages including juvenile arc, back-arc, ocean-floor 

and ocean-island and evolved volcanic arc assemblages that were amalgamated 

to form an accretionary collage (named the Amisk Collage) prior to the 

emplacement of voluminous intermediate to granitoid plutons and generally 

subsequent deformation. The volcanic assemblages consist of mafic to felsic 

volcanic rocks with intercalated volcanogenic sedimentary rocks. The younger 

plutons and coeval successor arc volcanics, volcaniclastic, and sedimentary 

successor basin rocks include the older, largely marine turbidites of the 

Burntwood Group and the terrestrial metasedimentary sequences of the Missi 

Group. 

 

The Flin Flon Belt is in fault and /or gradational contact with the Kisseynew 

Domain metasedimentary gneisses to the north and is unconformably overlain by 

the Phanerozoic cover of sandstone and dolostones to the south. Regional 

metamorphism at 1.82 to 1.81 Ga formed mineral assemblages in the Flin Flon 

Belt that range from prehnite-pumpellyite to middle amphibolite facies in the east 

and upper amphibolite facies in the north and west. 

 

The Snow Lake portion of the Flin Flon Belt is dominated by fold-thrust style 

tectonics that is atypical of western and central portions of the belt. It is a south-

verging, northeast dipping imbricate that was thrust over the previously 

amalgamated collage of oceanic and arc rocks to the west. The thrust package of 

the Snow Lake area has been modified by 1.82 to 1.81 Ga regional 

metamorphism to lower to middle almandine-amphibolite facies mineral 

assemblages. 

 

Intrusions in the belt are divided into pre-, syn- and post tectonic varieties 

where the pre-tectonic group includes intrusions that are coeval with the volcanic 

rocks, as well as those that crosscut volcanic and Missi supracrustal rocks. 

Numerous mafic to ultramafic dykes intrude the volcanic rocks. 

 

LOCAL AND PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

The Snow Lake arc assemblage, which hosts the producing and past-

producing mines in the Snow Lake area, is a 20 km wide by 6 km thick section 

that records a temporal evolution in geodynamic setting from 'primitive arc' 

(Anderson sequence to the south) to 'mature arc' (Chisel sequence) to 'arc-rift' 

(Snow Creek sequence to the northeast). The 'mature arc' Chisel sequence that 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 1-8 

hosts the zinc rich Chisel, Ghost, Chisel North, and Lalor deposits typically 

contains thin and discontinuous volcaniclastic deposits and intermediate to felsic 

flow-dome complexes. 

 

The Chisel sequence is lithologically diverse and displays rapid lateral facies 

variations and abundant volcaniclastic rocks. Mafic and felsic flows both exhibit 

evolved geochemical characteristics (relative to the unevolved underlying 

Anderson sequence) consistent with one of, or a combination of, the following: 

within-plate enrichment, derivation from a more fertile mantle source, lower 

average extents of melting at greater depths, and contamination from older 

crustal fragments. These rocks have undergone metamorphism at the lower to 

middle almandine-amphibolite facies.  

 

Rock units in the hanging wall of the Lalor deposit typically reflect this 

diversity and variation in rock types that include mafic and felsic volcanic and 

volocaniclastic units, mafic wacke, fragmental units of various grain sizes, and 

crystal tuff units 

 

The Lalor deposit is similar to other massive sulphide bodies in the Chisel 

sequence (Chisel Lake, Ghost Lake, Chisel North, and Photo Lake), and lies 

along the same stratigraphic horizon as the Chisel Lake and Chisel North 

deposits. It is interpreted that the top of the zone is near a decollement contact.  

 

The most common dyke intrusion throughout these rocks is a fine grained 

feldspar-phyric gabbro to diorite. The Chisel Lake pluton, a late 1.8 km by 9.8 km 

layered ultramafic intrusion, truncates the main lens of the Chisel Lake massive 

sulphide deposit but is not seen in any of the Lalor drill core.  

 

The footwall rocks have extensive hydrothermal alteration and metamorphic 

recrystallization has produced rather exotic aluminous mineral assemblages. 

These assemblages include chlorite dominant schists, sericite dominant schists, 

and cordierite+anthophyllite gneisses. Other minerals indicative of hydrothermal 

alteration that occur extensively throughout these rather simplified rock 

assemblages include quartz, feldspar, kyanite, biotite, garnet, staurolite, 

hornblende, and carbonate. Clinopyroxene, gahnite and anhydrite also occur 

locally. These assemblages are typical of metamorphosed footwall hydrothermal 

alteration commonly associated with volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS)

deposits and are similar to that at the other massive sulphide deposits in the 

Chisel Lake area. 

 

The mineralization is relatively flat lying, trends 270° to 310° azimuth and dips 

between 15° to 30° to the north. 

 

MINERAL RESOURCES  

HBMS has prepared a mineral resource estimate for the Lalor deposit for 

HudBay. The estimate was carried out using a block model method constrained 

by wireframe grade-shell models, with ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation. 

 

The grade estimation was constrained using wireframe models of the zinc rich 

base metal mineralized zones using geologically interpreted copper and zinc 

mineralized intersections with a 4% ZNEQ cut-off and a minimum width of two 

metres. The wireframes were interpreted from diamond drill information collected 

by HBED. In total, six stacked lenses or zones of zinc-rich polymetallic near solid 

to solid sulphide mineralization were identified, approximately 570 m to 1,160 m 

below surface, occurring at or near the top of hydrothermally altered felsic rocks. 

 

The drill hole database contains 86 parent holes and 49 wedge offsets, 

totalling 118,473 m of drilling. All information used in the estimation of the mineral 

resources was extracted directly from the HBMS acQuire database management 

system managed by the Mines Technical Services (MTS) department. 

 

Prior to compositing high-grade samples of gold and silver were capped, 

according to zone. Samples were composited into two meter lengths prior to 

grade estimation. High grade composites for all the metals were restricted during 

the grade interpolation by limiting the search distance. 

 

Geostatisitcal analyses of the composites were used to evaluate search 

parameters and search ellipsoids for use in the grade estimation. The 

orientations for the ellipsoids were derived from the variography process. The 

major search distance is parallel to the plunge of the mineralization, the minor 

search distance is parallel to the strike of the mineralization, and the vertical 

search distance corresponds to the thickness of the mineralization. 

 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 1-10 

Bulk density values, measured for the majority of the samples, were used in 

weighting the composite grades and were applied for the estimation of tonnage.  

 

The block model was constrained by interpreted 3D wireframes of the 

mineralized zones. Gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead, and iron grades and specific 

gravity were estimated into blocks using OK interpolation. Zone intersections 

were selected based on a minimum 4% ZNEQ over a two metre core length. The 

ZNEQ was calculated from metal price and metal recovery assumptions, with 

economic contributions from gold, silver, copper and zinc. Each block was 

assigned a ZNEQ and an associated dollar value equivalent. 

 

Validation exercises were carried out on the block model grade estimates. 

These validation exercises included: 

 

a. Inspection of the OK block model grades in plan and section views 
in comparison to drill hole grades; 

 
b. Comparison of the global mean grades based on nearest 

neighbour, inverse distance squared weighted and OK estimation 
methods; 

 
c. Swath plot comparisons of the estimation methods; 
 
d. Comparison to September 2008 mineral resource estimate. 

 

Mineral resources have been classified according to CIM Definition Standards 

on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM definitions), as incorporated in 

NI 43-101. All blocks estimated during the grade interpolation were assigned at 

least an Inferred category. Blocks estimated by at least three drill holes and less 

than 50 m from the nearest composite were generally qualified as Indicated 

resources. The blocks were then inspected in plan view to define a reasonably 

coherent volume of Indicated blocks with a more or less uniform density of 

drilling. Isolated Indicated blocks outside this volume were manually downgraded 

to Inferred.  

 

MINERAL PROCESSING 

A Phase 1 metallurgical testwork program on the Lalor deposit was completed 

in May 2009 by SGS Canada Incorporated (SGS) in Vancouver, British 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 1-11 

Columbia. The purpose of the testwork was to perform a preliminary evaluation of 

the basic mineral composition and associations, and to determine if there would 

be any issues treating the mineralization by conventional methods. A total of 637 

samples from 9 holes with a total weight of 1,616.6 kg were collected and 

designated in to one of nine different mineralization types by HBMS and HBED. 

 

SGS prepared these nine mineralization types prior to making eight test 

charges. The nine mineralization types were representative of base metal and 

precious metal intersections from the Lalor deposit at the time of collection. 

 

The Lalor zinc rich base metal resource is mainly coarse grained copper, zinc, 

lead, gold and silver mineralization exhibiting good response to conventional 

metallurgy. The iron sulphide content, mainly pyrite is high. Lead is present as 

galena, copper almost exclusively as chalcopyrite (with minor bornite) and zinc 

as sphalerite (with very minor zinc spinels). 

 

All charges responded very well to conventional flotation and very good 

copper/zinc separation was obtained with over 90% of the copper recovered to 

the copper rougher concentrates and approximately 90% of the zinc recovered to 

the zinc rougher concentrates. Separation was achieved at a rather coarse 

primary grind size (K80 of 100 µm). 

 

Smeltable copper concentrates with high copper recoveries were obtained 

from some charges, but the copper concentrate grades of the remaining charges 

were relatively low due to the high lead content in the concentrates though the 

copper recoveries were high. 

 

Good quality zinc cleaner concentrates were obtained from all eight charges 

at good recoveries. The zinc recoveries in open circuit were 83.2% - 88.2% at 

53.0% - 62.5% Zn grades. 

 

After a review of the SGS data, it was concluded: 

 

• The Lalor mineralization is typical to the base metal ores mined in the 

Chisel Basin. 

 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 1-12 

• The mineralization is mostly coarse grained and exhibits a high degree 

of liberation at a relatively coarse grind (100 µm). This would normally 

indicate that a very good metallurgical response can be expected with 

this mineralization. However, high iron content is also evident and this 

may lead to a more difficult upgrading of concentrates. 

 

• The high degree of mineral liberation has led SGS to predict excellent 

copper and zinc recoveries for the Lalor deposit. 

 

• Grind data indicates work indexes are similar to most of the ores 

HBMS treats. 

 

• Phase II metallurgical testing is required. 

 

SOCIO-ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

There are no known issues with local communities or indigenous peoples.  

The population and workforce of Snow Lake, Manitoba, would benefit from the 

potential exploration of these resources.  

 

UMA Engineering Ltd. conducted a vegetation study as part of an EIS in the 

area of Lalor in September 2007. A portion of the survey involved ground truthing 

in order to confirm the presence or absence of endangered, threatened or special 

concern species within the project area, and also to conduct an inventory of 

botanical species within the project area in support of a desktop review. No 

endangered or protected species were observed during the field program. 

 

LALOR POTENTIAL GOLD ZONES 

The Lalor potential gold zones estimates are conceptual in nature and to date 

there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource compliant 

with NI 43-101. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target deposit 

being delineated as a mineral resource. HBMS prepared the potential gold zones 

estimates for the Lalor deposit for HudBay. The potential estimate was carried 

out using a block model constrained by wireframe grade-shells, with inverse 

distance squared weighted (IDW) interpolation. 

 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 1-13 

The grade estimation was constrained using wireframe models of the 

potential gold zones, using geologically interpreted precious metal intersections 

with a 1.0 g/t gold cut-off over a two metre core length, to determine the zone 

outlines for continuity purposes to build the 3D wireframes. The wireframes were 

interpreted from diamond drill information collected by HBED. In total five stacked 

lenses or zones of gold mineralization were identified either in contact with or 

entirely separate to the zinc rich base metal resources, 715 m to 1,175 m below 

surface, occurring at or near the top of hydrothermally altered felsic rocks. 

 

All information used in the conceptual estimate of the potential gold zones 

was extracted from the same HBMS acQuire database management system as 

for the zinc rich mineral resources.  

 

Prior to compositing high grade samples of all the metals were capped, based 

on the statistical analysis of the data per each zone. Samples were composited 

into full length composites from hanging wall to footwall contact while honouring 

the interpreted potential gold mineralized zone boundaries.  

 

The limited drilling of the potential gold on the property and number of 

composites was insufficient to detect a direction of maximum continuity. The 

search parameters and orientations for the ellipsoids were derived from the 

interpreted potential gold wireframes. The major search distance is parallel to the 

plunge of the mineralization, the minor search distance is parallel to the strike of 

the mineralization, and the vertical search distance corresponds to the thickness 

of the mineralization.  

 

Bulk density values, measured for over half the samples, were used in 

weighting the composite grades and were also applied for the estimation of 

tonnage ranges. 

 

Gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead, and iron grades and specific gravity were 

estimated into blocks using IDW interpolation. 

 

The limited amount of drilling to date, lack of perceived continuity and the 

variability of the high-grade precious metal intersections of the potential gold 

zones precludes their inclusion into the current mineral resource estimate. The

Page 1-14 

potential gold zones at Lalor require testing of the near distance variability. This 

testing will help characterize the deposit for mineralization type and continuity.

2 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF 
REFERENCE 

Hudson Bay Mining & Smelting Co., Limited (HBMS), a wholly owned 

subsidiary of HudBay Minerals Inc. (HudBay), completed this technical report on 

the Lalor deposit, near Snow Lake, Manitoba for HudBay that conforms to the 

CIM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves definitions referred to in National 

Instrument (NI) 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  

 

HudBay is an integrated Canadian mining company that produces zinc, 

copper, gold, silver, and zinc oxides from mines and plants in Manitoba, 

Saskatchewan, Ontario and Michigan. Hudson Bay Exploration and Development 

Company Limited (HBED) performs the mineral exploration tasks on behalf of 

HudBay. 

 

This report represents an update of information pertaining to the Lalor deposit 

previously disclosed in a NI 43-101 report dated September 2008. Additional 

drilling has resulted in a large portion of the zinc rich base metal Inferred 

resources being converted to Indicated resources and the first time disclosure of 

a conceptual estimate on the potential gold zones at Lalor.  

 

HudBay's operations in Flin Flon, Manitoba include the 777 Mine, Trout Lake 

Mine, ore concentrator, zinc plant, and copper smelter. Operations in Snow Lake, 

Manitoba, include the Chisel North Mine on care and maintenance and a 

mothballed ore concentrator that are anticipated to reopen in early 2010. Lalor is 

located approximately 18 km by road west of the town of Snow Lake, Manitoba.  

 

In 2007 Lalor was considered primarily a zinc deposit with local copper, gold, 

silver and lead mineralization that occurs along a stratiform sulphide horizon. 

Since discovery in 2007, a total of 86 parent holes, 49 wedge offsets and 

numerous holes were deepened on the property and have identified the potential 

for extensive gold zones in addition to the zinc rich mineral resources. 

 

Mineralization of the zinc rich base metal zones occur as disseminated to 

solid sulphides consisting of medium to coarse grained sphalerite, pyrite and 

chalcopyrite with lesser amounts of galena and arsenopyrite. Precious metal

Page 2-2 

intersections of the Lalor potential gold zones contain low amounts of iron 

sulphide (4% to 5% on average) that is in the form of pyrite, pyrrhotite and 

chalcopyrite. Generally minor amounts of galena and sphalerite occur. 

 

HudBay owns 100% of the interest in the property, through a group of five 

contiguous HBED claims and eight HBMS mineral leases.  

 

The mineral resource and potential gold conceptual estimates were prepared 

by Robert Carter, P. Eng., HBMS Senior Mines Analyst, who is a Qualified 

Person as per NI 43-101 under the direct supervision of Kimberley Proctor, 

P.Geo., HBMS Superintendent Mines Technical Services, also a Qualified

Page 4-4 

The mineral claims have a work commitment of C$25/ha per year and filing 

fees of C$12/claim per year, which must be submitted with application to renew. 

Field work is carried out and a Report of Work is submitted to the Ministry of 

Manitoba Science, Technology, Energy and Mines (the Manitoba government) 

office for assessment credits. Assessment credits can be used towards the work 

commitment of any claim within a 3,200 ha area of the claim where the original 

work was incurred. Claims can be renewed for any number of years provided 

sufficient assessment credits exist and are applied, to meet the work required 

over the number of years being renewed. 

 

The mineral leases are Order in Council (OIC) leases that have a term of 21 

years. An annual payment of C$10.50/ha or C$193 minimum payment is due 

over the 21 year term. Annual tax of C$10 per lease is due by December 31 of 

each year. There is no work commitment on an OIC lease. 

 

LAND USE PERMITTING 

A general permit is held by HBED for the construction of the Lalor exploration 

road (GP59093). In addition, HBMS holds a quarry lease for a source of roadbed 

material (QL-928).  Table 4-3 shows the permit status for the Lalor property.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

ACCESSIBILITY 

The Lalor deposit is located approximately 215 km by road east of Flin Flon 

and 18 km by road west of the community of Snow Lake, Manitoba. Access to 

the deposit is from Provincial Road (PR) #395, a gravel road off PR #392, which 

joins the town of Snow Lake and PR #39 (Figure 5-1). From PR #395 there is an 

approximate three km exploration road into the site to support the continuing 

exploration of the deposit. 

 

CLIMATE 

The Snow Lake area has a typical mid-continental climate, with short 

summers and long, cold winters. Climate generally has only a minor effect on 

local exploration and mining activities. 

 

The nearest Environment Canada weather station is located near Baker's 

Narrows at the Flin Flon airport, approximately 16 km southeast of Flin Flon, and 

approximately 100 km west of the Lalor deposit. The average annual temperature 

at the Baker's Narrows weather station is 0.1°C. The average summer 

temperature is approximately 17°C, and the average winter temperature is -14°C. 

The lowest monthly average temperature occurs in January at -21.1°C, and the 

highest monthly average temperature is in July at 18.3°C. Freeze-up of small 

bays and lakes occurs in mid-November, with breakup occurring in mid-May. 

There is an average of 115 frost-free days. 

 

On average 45.7 cm of precipitation falls annually, 35% as snow. Since 1960, 

extreme monthly precipitations have been zero to a high of 18.11 cm, with a 

maximum daily precipitation of 7.82 cm. Average monthly winds for the area 

range from 10 km/hr to 13 km/hr, with 40% of the winds originating from the 

northwest, northeast or north.

LOCAL RESOURCES 

The nearest community is the town of Snow Lake, Manitoba, located 

approximately 18 km from Lalor. The community of 837 (2006 census) has 355 

private dwellings, of which 325 are single-detached or semi-detached houses 

and 30 are apartments. There are two cottage subdivisions located on Wekusko 

Lake along PR #391, as well as residences at Herb Lake Landing, approximately 

40 km south of the town. There are also a small number of seasonal remote 

cottages located near lakes throughout the area. 

 

Snow Lake community services include a health facility staffed with two 

doctors, a grocery store, two hotel/motels, three service stations, a kindergarten 

to grade 12 school, a hockey arena, a five-sheet curling rink and a nine-hole golf 

course. 

 

The nearest larger centres (5,000+) are Flin Flon (215 km), The Pas (200 km) 

and Thompson (230 km), all accessible by paved highway. There is a 1,100 m x 

20 m unserviced gravel municipal airstrip located approximately 30 km from Lalor 

along PR #394. A small craft charter service operates out of the community of 

Snow Lake, where small planes and helicopters can be chartered. Rental 

vehicles are available at the Flin Flon airport. The nearest full service commercial 

airport is located at Baker's Narrows, near Flin Flon, approximately 200 km from 

Lalor. The nearest international airport is located in Winnipeg, approximately 700 

km from Snow Lake. 

 

There is no rail in the immediate area of Lalor or Snow Lake. The nearest rail 

access is at Wekusko siding, approximately 65 km southeast of Lalor.  Wekusko 

is accessible by an all-weather road. A gravel rail bed (ties and rail removed) 

connects the Snow Lake concentrator to Chisel Lake Mine, and continues to a 

rail line at Optic Lake siding, approximately 65 km west of Chisel Lake. Optic 

Lake is not road accessible.

INFRASTRUCTURE 

The only infrastructure at the Lalor site is an exploration road. 

 

HBMS operates a zinc and copper metallurgical plant in Flin Flon, Manitoba, 

approximately 215 km from Lalor. Present capacities are 115,000 tpa refined zinc 

and 80,000 tpa copper anode. Copper anode is refined at HudBay's White Pine 

refinery in Michigan. 

 

HBMS owns an ore concentrator approximately 18 km from Lalor, currently 

mothballed and is anticipated to reopen in early 2010. The mill operated five days 

per week at 1,300 short tons per milling day, processing ore from the Chisel 

North Mine. The mill has two circuits, with design capacities of 1,000 stpd and 

2,400 stpd. 

 

The concentrator had one circuit operational and was only producing zinc 

concentrate when mothballed. It was historically capable of producing copper, 

zinc and lead concentrates. The tailings are either dry-filtered or slurried and 

deposited at the Anderson Lake tailings pond. Concentrates were hauled by truck 

to HBMS metallurgical facilities in Flin Flon. 

 

HBMS has a permitted tailings storage facility at Anderson Lake, located 

approximately three kilometres from the Snow Lake concentrator and 18 km from 

Lalor. As of December 2006, using a modified deposition plan, tailings remaining 

capacity was estimated at 7.5 million tonnes. 

 

HBMS operates a mine water pump station for Chisel North Mine at the north 

end of Chisel Lake. The pipeline from this pump station follows PR #395 and 

terminates approximately three kilometres from Lalor at the Chisel North 

minesite. There is a parallel recirculating line used to prevent freezing. The pump 

station typically operated at 130 USgpm during winter when Chisel North Mine 

was in full production and provided mine process water and wash water for 

Chisel North Mine. 

 

In addition, HBMS recently commissioned a 2,000 USgpm water treatment 

plant at Chisel Lake, approximately seven kilometers by road from Lalor. The 

treatment plant was being operated at 1,000 USgpm (peak 1,600 USgpm) to

treat Chisel North Mine discharge water and water from the Chisel Lake open pit. 

Both water sources contain elevated amounts of suspended and dissolved 

metals which require pH adjustment. Treated water is discharged to the 

environment south of the Chisel Lake open pit. 

 

Manitoba Hydro services the Chisel Lake Mine with a 110 kV overhead 

transmission line, running approximately parallel with PR #395. Voltage is 

stepped down to 6,000 V using an HBMS-owned substation at the termination of 

the Manitoba Hydro line.  

 

Power from the main substation is stepped up to 21 kV using a modern 

substation and is fed to the Chisel North minesite via a four kilometre long 

overhead transmission line. Power is stepped down to 4,160 V / 550 V at the 

Chisel North substation, located at the Chisel North minesite.  

 

PHYSIOGRAPHY  

The deposit is located in the Boreal Shield Ecozone, the largest ecozone in 

Canada, extending as a broad inverted arch from northern Saskatchewan east to 

Newfoundland.  The area of Lalor and surrounding water bodies (Snow, File, 

Woosey, Anderson and Wekusko lakes) are located in the Churchill River Upland 

Ecoregion in the Wekusko Ecodistrict. The dominant soils are well to excessively 

drained dystic brunisols that have developed on shallow, sandy and stony 

veneers of water-worked glacial till overlying bedrock. Significant areas consist of 

peat-filled depressions with very poorly drained Typic and Terric Fibrisolic and 

Mesisolic Organic soils overlying loamy to clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. 

 

The property area is approximately 300 m ASL, with depressional lowlands, 

and has gentle relief that rarely exceeds 10 m, consisting of ridged to hummocky 

sloping rocks (Figure 5-2).

6 HISTORY 

The Snow Lake area has a long exploration and mining history. The Lalor 

deposit was discovered in 2007. 

 

EXPLORATION IN THE CHISEL BASIN AREA 

Exploration in the Chisel Basin has been active since 1955. The Chisel Basin 

area has hosted three producing mines, namely, Chisel Lake, Chisel Open Pit 

and Chisel North. All three mines have very similar lithological and mineralogical 

features. This basin is also the host of the Lalor deposit. 

 

In early 2007, drill hole DUB168 was drilled almost vertically to test a 2003 

surveyed Crone Geophysics deep penetrating pulse electromagnetic anomaly 

and intersected a band of conductive mineralization between 781.74 m and 

826.87 m (45.13 m). Assay results include 0.30% Cu and 7.62% Zn over the 

45.13 m, including 0.19% Cu and 17.26% Zn over 16.45 m. Drilling at Lalor has 

been continuous since the discovery of mineralization on the property. 

 

HISTORICAL MINING IN THE SNOW LAKE AREA 

The Snow Lake area has had an active mining history for more than 50 years. 

HBMS has played an integral part in this history since the late 1950s by operating 

nine mines in the area including Photo Lake, Rod, Chisel Lake and Chisel Open 

Pit, Stall Lake, Osborne Lake, Spruce Point, Ghost Lake, Anderson Lake, and on 

care and maintenance Chisel North. 

 

The Snow Lake concentrator was commissioned in 1979 and operated 

continuously until shutdown in early 1993 as a result of the depletion of the 

Chisel Open Pit and Stall Lake mines. The concentrator was reopened in 1994 to 

process ore from the Photo Lake Mine and continued to process ore from the 

Chisel North Mine until February 2009. Anticipated reopening is in early 2010 

along with the Chisel North Mine.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The Lalor property lies in the eastern (Snow Lake) portion of the 

Paleoproterozoic Flin Flon Greenstone Belt (Figure 7-1) and is overlain by a thin 

veneer of Pleistocene glacial/fluvial sediments. Located within the Trans-Hudson 

Orogen, the Flin Flon Belt consists of a variety of distinct 1.92 to 1.87 Ga 

tectonostratigraphic assemblages including juvenile arc, back-arc, ocean-floor 

and ocean-island and evolved volcanic arc assemblages that were amalgamated 

to form an accretionary collage (named the Amisk Collage) prior to the 

emplacement of voluminous intermediate to granitoid plutons and generally 

subsequent deformation (Syme et al., 1998). The volcanic assemblages consist 

of mafic to felsic volcanic rocks with intercalated volcanogenic sedimentary rocks. 

The younger plutons and coeval successor arc volcanics, volcaniclastic, and 

sedimentary successor basin rocks include the older, largely marine turbidites of 

the Burntwood Group and the terrestrial metasedimentary sequences of the Missi 

Group. 

 

The Flin Flon Belt is in fault and /or gradational contact with the Kisseynew 

Domain metasedimentary gneisses to the north and is unconformably overlain by 

the Phanerozoic cover of sandstone and dolostones to the south (Figure 7-2). 

Regional metamorphism at 1.82 to 1.81 Ga formed mineral assemblages in the 

Flin Flon belt that range from prehnite-pumpellyite to middle amphibolite facies in 

the east and upper amphibolite facies in the north and west (David and Machado, 

1996; Froese and Moore, 1980; Syme et al., 1998). 

 

The Snow Lake portion of the Flin Flon belt is dominated by fold-thrust style 

tectonics that is atypical of western and central portions of the belt. It is a south-

verging, northeast dipping imbricate that was thrust over the previously 

amalgamated collage of oceanic and arc rocks to the west (Bailes and Galley, 

1999). The thrust package of the Snow Lake area has been modified by 1.82 to 

1.81 Ga regional metamorphism to lower to middle almandine-amphibolite facies 

mineral assemblages (David and Machado, 1996; Froese and Moore, 1980).

Intrusions in the belt are divided into pre-, syn- and post tectonic varieties 

where the pre-tectonic group includes intrusions that are coeval with the volcanic 

rocks, as well as those that crosscut volcanic and Missi supracrustal rocks. 

Numerous mafic to ultramafic dykes intrude the volcanic rocks. 

 

LOCAL AND PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

The Snow Lake arc assemblage (Figures 7-3 and 7-4) that hosts the 

producing and past-producing mines in the Snow Lake area is a 20 km wide by 6 

km thick section that records a temporal evolution in geodynamic setting from 

'primitive arc' (Anderson sequence to the south) to 'mature arc' (Chisel 

sequence) to 'arc-rift' (Snow Creek sequence to the northeast, Bailes and Galley, 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 7-4 

 

2007). The 'mature arc' Chisel sequence that hosts the zinc rich Chisel, Ghost, 

Chisel North, and Lalor deposits typically contains thin and discontinuous 

volcaniclastic deposits and intermediate to felsic flow-dome complexes. 

 

The Chisel sequence is lithologically diverse and displays rapid lateral facies 

variations and abundant volcaniclastic rocks. Mafic and felsic flows both exhibit 

evolved geochemical characteristics (relative to the unevolved underlying 

Anderson sequence) consistent with one of, or a combination of, the following: 

within-plate enrichment, derivation from a more fertile mantle source, lower 

average extents of melting at greater depths, and contamination from older 

crustal fragments. These rocks have undergone metamorphism at the lower to 

middle almandine-amphibolite facies.  

 

Rock units in the hanging wall of the Lalor deposit typically reflect this 

diversity and variation in rock types that include mafic and felsic volcanic and 

volocaniclastic units, mafic wacke, fragmental units of various grain sizes, and 

crystal tuff units.

Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 7-7 

 

The Lalor deposit is similar to other massive sulphide bodies in the Chisel 

sequence (Chisel Lake, Ghost Lake, Chisel North, and Photo Lake), and lies 

along the same stratigraphic horizon as the Chisel Lake and Chisel North 

deposits. It is interpreted that the top of the zone is near a decollement contact 

with the overturned hanging wall rocks.  

 

The most common dyke intrusion throughout these rocks is a fine grained 

feldspar-phyric gabbro to diorite. The Chisel Lake pluton, a late 1.8 km by 9.8 km 

layered ultramafic intrusion (Bailes and Galley, 2007), truncates the main lens of 

the Chisel Lake massive sulphide deposit but is not seen in any of the Lalor drill 

core. 

 

The extensive hydrothermal alteration and metamorphic recrystallization of 

the footwall rocks has produced some exotic aluminous mineral assemblages. 

These assemblages include chlorite and sericite dominant schists and 

cordierite+anthophyllite gneisses. Other minerals indicative of hydrothermal 

alteration that occur extensively throughout these rock assemblages include 

quartz, feldspar, kyanite, biotite, garnet, staurolite, hornblende, and carbonate. 

Clinopyroxene, gahnite and anhydrite also occur locally. These assemblages are 

typical of metamorphosed footwall hydrothermal alteration commonly associated 

with volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits and are similar to that at the 

other massive sulphide deposits in the Chisel Lake area. 

 

 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 8-1 

8 DEPOSIT TYPE 

Lalor is interpreted as a VMS deposit that precipitated at or near the seafloor 

in association with contemporaneous volcanism, forming a stratabound 

accumulation of sulphide minerals. VMS deposits typically form during periods of 

rifting along volcanic arcs, fore arcs, and in extensional back arc basins. Rifting 

causes extension and thinning of the crust, providing the high heat source 

required to generate and sustain a high-temperature hydrothermal system 

(Franklin et al., 2005). 

 

The location of VMS deposits is often controlled by synvolcanic faults and 

fissures, which permit a focused discharge of hydrothermal fluids. A typical 

deposit will include the massive mineralization located proximal to the active 

hydrothermal vent, footwall stockwork mineralization, and distal products, which 

are typically thin but extensive. Footwall, and less commonly, hanging wall 

semiconformable alteration zones are produced by high temperature water-rock 

interactions (Franklin et al., 2005). 

 

The depositional environment for the mineralization at Lalor is similar to that 

of present and past producing base metal deposits in felsic to mafic volcanic and 

volcaniclastic rocks in the Snow Lake mining camp. The deposit appears to have 

an extensive associated hydrothermal alteration pipe.

Page 9-1 

9 MINERALIZATION 

The Lalor VMS deposit is flat lying, with zinc mineralization beginning at 

approximately 570 m from surface and extending to a depth of approximately 

1,160 m. The mineralization trends about 270° to 310° azimuth and dips between 

15° and 30° to the north. It has a lateral extent of about 900 m in the north-south 

direction and 700 m in the east-west direction. 

 

Sulphide mineralization is pyrite and sphalerite. In the near solid (semi-

massive) to solid (massive) sulphide sections, pyrite occurs as fine to coarse 

grained crystals ranging one to six millimetres and averages two to three 

millimeters in size. Sphalerite occurs interstitial to the pyrite. A crude bedding or 

lamination is locally discernable between these two sulphide minerals. Near solid 

coarse grained sphalerite zones occur locally as bands or boudins that strongly 

suggest that remobilization took place during metamorphism. 

 

Disseminated blebs and stringers of pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite occur locally 

within the massive sulphides, adjacent to and generally in the footwall of the 

massive sulphides. The hydrothermally altered rocks in the footwall commonly 

contain some very low concentrations of sulphide minerals.  

 

Some sections of massive pyrrhotite occur, but these tend to give way to 

pyrite-sphalerite-dominant zones. 

 

Six distinct stacked zinc rich mineralized zones have been interpreted within 

the Lalor deposit based on the Zinc Equivalency (ZNEQ) of 4% over a minimum 

two metre interval (Table 9-1). 

 

The top two lenses of the stacked base metal zones (coded as Zone 11 and 

10) have higher grade zinc and iron content. The footwall lenses coded as Zones 

20, 30, 31 and 40 have moderate to high zinc grades hosted in near solid 

sulphides containing higher grade gold and locally appreciable amounts of 

copper.  

 

Overall, Zones 10 and 20 have the largest extent and volume of 

mineralization. Zone 10 extends approximately 450 m in the east-west and 600 m

Gold and silver enriched zones occur near the margins of the sulphide lenses 

and in local silicified footwall alteration. These silicified areas often correlate with 

disseminated to stringer chalcopyrite and galena, whether together or 

independent of each other. This association has been confirmed in thin section. 

 

Magnetite is not common, often less than 1% and less than one millimetre in 

size, but can range up to 5% and from one to three millimeters in size when 

associated with rhyolites of the hanging wall and felsic gneisses of the footwall.  

Magnetite rarely occurs as porphyroblasts in chlorite schists, sometimes up to 

one centimetre in size. Galena occurs as disseminations mostly in the altered 

footwall rock and at or near the immediate hanging wall of the massive sulphide 

sections. Arsenopyrite is present, but rare. Gahnite, like galena, is locally present 

in the altered country rocks and often seems to be in vein-like structures. 

 

POTENTIAL GOLD ZONES MINERALIZATION 

Notable gold and silver rich zones have also been intersected outside the 

current zinc rich mineral resources on the property. The precious metal 

mineralization begins at approximately 715 m from surface and extends to a 

depth of approximately 1,175 m. The mineralization trends about 270° to 310°

azimuth and dips between 15° to 30° to the north. The precious metal zones 

have lateral extents of 870 m in the north-south direction and 420 m in the east-

west direction.  

 

Precious metal intersections of the Lalor potential gold zones contain low 

amounts of iron sulphide (4% to 5% on average) that is in the form of pyrite, 

pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. Generally minor amounts of galena and sphalerite 

occur. The intersections display no distinct marker horizons other than being 

extensively altered to form rather exotic mineral assemblages. 

 

Initial polished thin section inspections have identified electrum with pyrite, 

galena, chalcopyrite, bornite and tetrahedrite/sulphosalt. Host rocks tend to be 

rather diverse. They include amphibolite, chlorite and carbonate schist, carbonate 

rich rocks (skarn), calc-silicates, silicified zones, cordierite and anthophyllite-

bearing gneisses, and quartz veins. Quartz veins that contain tiny (< 1 mm) 

specks of disseminated galena tend to have higher gold values than other variety 

of quartz vein. 

 

Five stacked gold lenses or zones of low sulphide either in contact with 

entirely separate to the zinc rich base metal resources were interpreted (Table 9-

2).  

 

The interpreted potential gold zones are generally co-parallel and /or separate 

to the zinc rich base metal mineral resource zones. However, potential gold 

zones locally merge, overlap and cut through zinc rich base metal resources as is 

the case with potential gold Zones 21, 25 and 26.

10 EXPLORATION 

Exploration in the Lalor deposit area is conducted by HBED, which is the 

exploration subsidiary of HudBay located in Flin Flon. A field office, including core 

logging and storage facilities, is situated on the HBMS Snow Lake concentrator 

site.  

 

In 2003, a Crone Geophysics high power time-domain electromagnetic (EM) 

system experimental survey was conducted over the deepest portion 

(approximately 600 m vertical depth) of the Chisel North Mine. The survey was 

designed and interpreted by HBED and was conducted by Koop Geotechnical 

Services Inc. The survey provided conclusive evidence that the system could 

detect conductive bodies at depths greater than 500 m and it was decided to 

extend the survey coverage further down-dip and down-plunge of the known 

mineralized lenses. A double-wired transmitter loop measuring two kilometres by 

two kilometres was used to maximize the EM field strength. The survey results 

were interpreted using three-dimensional computer modeling software. The 

model indicated a highly conductive, shallow-dipping zone at a vertical depth of 

800 m. The Lalor drilling began in March 2007 to test the geophysical anomaly, 

and diamond drill hole DUB168 intersected conductive sulphides at a depth of 

approximately 780 m. Drilling is ongoing and has been continuous since the 

discovery hole. 

 

Time-domain borehole EM surveys with three dimensional probes are 

routinely conducted on drill holes. The survey results identify any off-hole 

conductors that have been missed and indicate direction to the target as well as 

the dimensions and the attitude of the conductor. The survey also may detect any 

possible conductors which lie past the end of the hole allowing the geologist to 

know whether or not the hole should be deepened. 

 

Exploration since the disclosed September 2008 NI 43-101 technical report 

has focused on delineating the Inferred resource, confirming the continuity of the 

mineralization down plunge, and testing the notable precious metal intersections 

in the footwall horizon.

11 DRILLING 

The Lalor drilling began in March 2007 to test an electromagnetic anomaly 

and the first hole DUB168 intersected appreciable widths of zinc rich massive 

sulphides. Drilling is ongoing and has been continuous since the discovery hole. 

This report contains drilling information as of a September 15, 2009 cut-off date. 

 

The majority of the drilling on the property is by near vertical holes were the 

sample length is approximately equal to the true thickness because of the flat 

lying nature of the Lalor deposit.  

 

All diamond drilling was completed from surface retrieving whole core sizes of 

BQ and NQ. Wedge offsets and associated directional drilling were completed on 

parent holes, resulting in time and cost savings over drilling a new hole from 

surface. Wedging and directional drilling were used at Lalor for acquiring 

metallurgical sample and delineation purposes. For delineation purposes, wedge 

offsets are oriented towards specific targets selected by the geologists along a 

path calculated by the directional drilling technicians. In metallurgical sampling 

wedge offsets are unoriented and the wedge is set just above the zone that is to 

be sampled such that the core sample collected is generally within 10 m to 20 m 

of the parent hole intersection. As many as seven wedge offsets have been 

completed from one parent hole. 

 

All of the parent drill holes used for wedge offsets at Lalor are NQ size due to 

the size of the wedging and directional drilling equipment used. Tech Directional 

Services Inc. of Newfoundland is the contractor operating the Devico directional 

drilling system. The Devico system allows for the collection of AQ core from an 

NQ hole throughout the steering process. An offset of up to 20° per 30 m of hole 

can be achieved with this system. Core recovery is generally greater than 90%.  

 

The first step in the wedging process is to backfill the hole with cement so as 

not to leave space in the parent below the wedge. An expandable wedge retainer 

(plug) is then set in the parent hole at a predetermined depth and a wooden block 

is placed on top of the wedge. A non-retrievable steel wedge is set into the 

wooden block and is held in place by the axe head of the wedge that splits the 

wooden block. This, plus the swelling of the wood as it hydrates, holds the 

wooden block tightly in place and subsequently keeps the wedge oriented 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 11-2 

properly. The wedge face is oriented using an orientation tool in the wedge 

dropper and a downhole survey tool by the directional drilling technicians to 

achieve the desired direction. 

 

A bullnose bit is used to kick off the wedge and start a new hole. No core is 

recovered in this process. The bullnose is generally used for five metres of 

drilling, just enough to get past the steel wedge and establish a new hole. A 

wedge will allow up to a two degree deviation from the parent hole. The natural 

bend of the steel rods and core barrel as they drill past the wedge increases the 

amount of deviation from the wedge.  

 

For metallurgical samples, after bullnose drilling, the NQ drilling is allowed to 

proceed off the wedge for 40 m to 80 m or more until the sample is collected. The 

hole is then cemented and the process can be repeated higher up the hole. 

 

For delineation drilling purposes, once a wedge offset is established from the 

parent hole (usually 12 m to 15 m past the wedge), the directional drilling 

technicians use the Devico system to steer the hole towards the drill target. 

Generally the system is used for short distances and then normal NQ drilling is 

resumed. 

 

At the time of the cut-off date for this report, there was wedging from 27 

parent holes. 

 

Core recovery at Lalor is near 100% on all holes. 

 

Table 11-1 presents a summary of diamond drill holes with assay results as of 

September 15, 2009.

SURVEYING 

PROPERTY GRID AND DRILL HOLE COLLARS 

In August 2007, Manitoba land surveyors, Balchen & Kulchycki Surveys 

(Balchen & Kulchycki), established control points at the Lalor property using a 

Trimble R8 RTK DGPS system, rated as subdecimetre in accuracy. The survey 

consisted of locating the coordinates of the property grid and 14 drill hole collars. 

Coordinates are reported in UTM NAD83. 

 

HBMS has conducted numerous field trips to survey drill hole collars 

completed after August 2007. The surveys were conducted using a Trimble 5800 

RTK DGPS. The base stations were set up on a point previously surveyed by 

Balchen & Kulchycki at the edge of PR #395, approximately 3.3 km from the 

drilling area. Collars were then surveyed with a rover unit linked to the base via 

radio. During the survey the equipment's reliability was checked by surveying 

three of the benchmark sets established by Balchen & Kulchycki in the drilling 

area. In each case, the difference between the two sets of coordinates was less 

than two centimetres. Drill hole collars previously surveyed by Balchen & 

Kulchycki were check surveyed and discrepancies were negligible.

NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 11-4 

Sixteen of the total parent drill hole collars were not surveyed as of 

September 15, 2009 because the drill platforms are covering the collars while 

drilling another hole. The location of the currently drilled hole was used in these 

cases. 

 

All diamond drill holes were proposed and collared based on the property 

grid, which was referenced from baselines in the area that were cut every 1,230 

m. Chain and turning boards were used to establish the grid on 91 m centres. 

 

The location of the drill holes is shown in Figure 11-1 in relation to the base 

metal mineralized outlines. The holes were originally drilled at 200 m to 400 m 

spacing across the geophysical target to outline the overall deposit extents. The 

deposit is currently drilled at less than 50 m in the middle of the base metal zones 

and 75 m to 125 m spacing along the perimeter. The majority of holes are drilled 

near vertical and tend to deviate towards the southwest direction. Figure 11-2 

illustrates the Lalor deposit drill holes and the zinc rich mineralized zone outlines 

in plan view. Figure 11-3 illustrates the Lalor deposit drill holes and mineralized 

wireframes in 3D view. 

 

DOWNHOLE SURVEY 

Downhole surveys were completed using a Reflex EZ-Shot® (Reflex) 

instrument. Surveys were completed at regular intervals of 30 m to 50 m down 

the hole. 

 

The Reflex instrument measures the azimuth relative to the earth's magnetic 

field and records the dip of the hole. The magnetic field strength is checked for 

possible magnetic interference, where magnetic rock or material close to the 

instrument affects the magnetic field strength and magnetic azimuth readings. 

 

The normal magnetic field strength for the deposit is 5,800 nT to 6,000 nT, 

established in an area free of magnetic effects. The Reflex instrument is 

calibrated based on the normal field strength and flashes when the magnetic 

strength is greater or less than 1,000 nT from normal. The geologist validates the 

survey results and will accept or reject the magnetic azimuth reading.

A gyro survey was completed at the Lalor deposit site in February 2009 to 

check the accuracy of the Reflex readings. The survey was conducted by Sperry 

Drilling Services, which is a division of Halliburton Group Canada. Four drill holes 

were selected for the survey and differences between the Reflex and the gyro 

survey were less than 1% at the end of the drill holes. The gyro surveys have 

confirmed that the magnetic Reflex survey is accurate and reliable method of 

downhole surveying at the Lalor deposit.

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

The rock is drilled using a diamond bit. Whole core is retrieved from the drill 

string six metre core barrel. The drill helper removes the core from the barrel and 

places the core in boxes that are labeled by hole and box number. Distance tags 

are placed at appropriate locations.  

 

The core boxes are picked up every morning from the drill site by a HBED 

technician or by diamond drillers at the end of the night shift and delivered to the 

core logging facility near the Snow Lake concentrator. Technicians sort the core 

boxes by specific hole number and place the core on the outdoor core racks 

readily available for the core logging geologist.  

 

The geologist and /or technician transfer the core from the racks to the core 

logging tables as the logging progresses. The geologist orients the core to fit 

matching pieces and marks one metre intervals on the core with a grease pencil. 

The intervals are compared to the diamond drillers' down-the-hole tags and any 

conflicts with the metreage differences are resolved if necessary. Core boxes are 

labeled with aluminum tagging containing the drill hole number, box number and 

the corresponding downhole distances for each box. Photographing of the 

diamond drill core began on a regular basis in January 2009. 

 

The core is initially logged for lithology and then descriptively for grain size, 

foliation, minor units, alteration minerals and intensity, faults, rock quality 

designation (RQD), joints and contacts. Core is logged into an on-site North Face 

Software Ltd. 2003 version Lagger program (Lagger) which is later uploaded to 

the main Lalor acQuire database. The acQuire database is directly linked to the 

MineSight resource block modeling program for evaluation. 

 

Sample intervals are then determined by both lithology and a visual estimate 

of the sulphide mineralization. Samples are also taken when intense alteration, 

quartz veining, flooding and siliceous areas are encountered as they may be 

indicative of precious metal occurrences. As a general rule, sample intervals are 

approximately one metre, though the length varies depending on lithology or type 

of mineralization. In no cases are samples taken from intervals less than 10 cm.  

 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 12-2 

In all holes, the mineralized material is sampled from upper through to lower 

mineralized contacts. The geologist identifies higher and lower grade portions of 

the mineralized zone in an attempt to sample similar grade material and break 

sample lengths at these contacts. 

 

A minimum one shoulder sample is taken on either side of the zone to check 

for mineralization in the country rock, and at times sampling is taken continuously 

from the upper mineralized zone through to the lower zone. 

 

Once sample intervals are selected, estimated sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and 

pyrite percentages are recorded in a sample tag book with a unique sample 

number for each sample interval. The samples are labeled on the core and are 

recorded in the sample booklet. 

 

All sample intervals are taken to a cutting facility and are sawn in half by a 

diamond saw. Half of the core is placed into a plastic bag with its unique sample 

identification tag. During this process, as part of the QA/QC protocols, blanks and 

standards are submitted into the sample stream as per the geologist instruction 

at regular intervals of every 20 samples. In addition, one duplicate analysis is 

requested every 20 samples. The other half of the core is returned to the core 

box and subsequently re-racked in the Snow Lake concentrator yard. 

 

The bagged samples are placed in a burlap bag or plastic pails and a 

submittal sheet is prepared by the geologist or technician. Samples are delivered 

to the Flin Flon assay laboratory by HBED personnel and are checked by 

laboratory personnel to ensure that the samples match the submittal sheet.  

 

A total of 30,886 samples from 86 drill holes and 49 wedges were submitted 

to the Flin Flon assay lab for analysis. The average length for these sample 

intervals is 0.83 m. 

 

Geochemical samples are taken every 30 m to 50 m on every rock type for 

full spectrum analysis. 

 

Bulk density measurements are taken on samples selected for assaying, 

which included weakly mineralized shoulder samples on either side of the 

mineralized zone. The measurement methodology consists of, first, weighing the 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 12-3 

half split sample in air. Then, the sample is suspended in a tub filled with water 

by a chain on the underside of the scale in such a way that it did not touch the 

sides of the water-filled tub and the weight of the submerged sample was 

recorded. The sample is contained in a wire basket for both weighing procedures. 

The determination of the specific gravity (SG) is calculated from measured values 

as follows: 

 

SG = A / (A-B) 

 

Where, 

 

A = (Weight of sample and basket in air – Weight of basket in air) 

 

B = (Weight of sample and basket in water suspended – Weight of basket in 

water) 

 

Measurements were in grams and it was assumed that the water was 1.0 

g/cm
3
 at room temperature. 

 

In the author's opinion, the HBED sampling method and approach is industry 

standard. There are no drilling, sampling or recovery factors observed that could 

materially impact on the accuracy and reliability of the results.

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 

The Lalor samples were all prepared and analyzed by HBMS at the Flin Flon, 

Manitoba assay laboratory. As part of HBMS QA/QC measures, pulp duplicates 

are sent to Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd. (Acme) in Vancouver, BC for 

comparison and verification purposes. 

 

HBMS LABORATORY SAMPLE PREPARATION 
PROCEDURES 

All samples arriving at the HBMS laboratory are checked against the 

geologist's sample submission sheets. Laboratory analytical work sheets are 

generated for the analysis areas. Any wet samples are dried at 105°C as per 

industry standard. The core samples are crushed to (-)10 mesh then split to 

approximately 250 g, pulverized to about 90% passing, (-)150 mesh and placed 

into labelled bags. Crusher and pulverizer checks are conducted daily to ensure 

there is no excessive wear on the crusher plates and pulverizer pots. For every 

22 samples received the laboratory inserts a blank and QC into the batch as part 

of the laboratory's internal QC checks. 

 

As of January 1, 2009 the remaining crushed core sample (coarse reject) not 

used for grade analysis is returned to the sample bag and stored at the HBED 

Hangar for future reference. 

 

HBMS LABORATORY ANALYSIS PROCEDURES 

The samples were analyzed for the following elements: gold, silver, copper, 

zinc, lead, iron, arsenic and nickel. Base metal and silver assaying was 

completed by aqua regia digestion and read by a simultaneous ICP unit. The 

gold analysis was completed on each sample by atomic absorption spectrometry 

(AAS) after fire assay lead collection. As of May 1, 2009 all samples with gold 

values (AAS) > 10 g/t are re-assayed using a gravimetric finish. Detection limits 

of the ICP and AAS are shown in Table 13.1.

the calibration standards for the AAS and ICP are certified and traceable. Each is 

received with a certificate of analysis. Both the AAS and ICP are serviced twice 

per year by the instrument manufactures qualified service representative to 

ensure that the instruments meet original design specifications. 

 

The Flin Flon assay laboratory has been participating in CANMET PTP/MAL 

round robin testing since 2000. PTP/MAL is a requirement for laboratories that 

are ISO 17025 certified. The laboratory also has been participating since 2002 in 

round robin testing conducted by GEOSTATS of Australia.  

 

Sample pulps are kept in secure storage after analysis. Pulps are only 

released to HBED after all data is validated. HBED personnel retrieve the 

designated pulps (approximately 1 out of every 20 samples) for submittal to 

Acme as part of their QA/QC measures. 

 

ACME LABORATORY ANALYSIS PROCEDURES 

Acme performed a multi-element assay (Group 7AR) measured on an ICP 

emission spectrograph after aqua regia digestion, and gold analysis (Group 601)

samples reported > 10 g/t by fire assay were then gravimetrically finished (Group 

601+612) as instructed by HBMS. 

 

For the multi-element assay, aliquots of 1.000 ± 0.002 g are weighed into 100 

mL volumetric flasks. Acme's QA/QC protocol requires one pulp duplicate to 

monitor analytical precision and a blank and aliquot of in-house reference 

material to monitor accuracy in each batch of 36 samples. 30 mL of Aqua Regia, 

a 1:1:1 mixture of ACS grade concentrated HCl, concentrated HNO3 and de-

mineralised H2O, is added to each sample. Samples are digested for one hour in 

a hot water bath (> 95°C). After cooling for 3 hrs, solutions are made up to 

volume (100 mL) with dilute (5%) HCl. Very high-grade samples may require a 1g 

to 250 mL or 0.25 g to 250 mL sample/solution ratio for accurate determination. 

Acme's QA/QC protocol requires simultaneous digestion of a reagent blank 

inserted in each batch. Sample solutions are aspirated into a Spectro Ciros 

Vision ICP emission spectrograph (ES) to determine 23 elements. Raw and final 

data from the ICP-ES undergoes a final verification by a British Columbia 

Certified Assayer who then signs the Analytical Report before it is released to the 

client. This 23 multi-element assay has detection limits displayed in Table 13.2. 

 

For the gold analysis, one assay ton aliquots (29.2 g) are weighed into fire 

assay crucibles. Smaller aliquots of ¼ or ½ assay ton may be required with 

difficult ore matrices. The sample aliquot is custom blended with fire assay fluxes, 

PbO litharge and a silver inquart. Firing the charge at 1050°C liberates Au, Ag ± 

PGEs that report to the molten Pb-metal phase. After cooling the Pb button is 

recovered, placed in a cupel, and fired at 950°C to render an Ag ± Au ± PGEs 

dore bead. The bead is weighed and parted (i.e. leached in 1 mL of hot HNO3) to 

dissolve silver leaving a gold sponge. Adding 10mL of HCl dissolves the Au ± 

PGE sponge. Solutions are analysed for gold on a Jarrel-Ash Atomcomp model 

975 ICP emission spectrometer. Gold in excess of 30 g/t forms a large sponge 

that can be weighed (gravimetric finish). An analytical batch is comprised of 34 

samples. 

 

As part of Acme's QA/QC protocol, a sample-prep blank is inserted as the first 

sample and carried through all stages of preparation to analysis as well as a pulp 

duplicate to monitor analytical precision. Two reagent blanks are inserted in each 

batch to measure background, and aliquots of Rocklabs Certified Reference 

Materials to monitor accuracy. Raw and final data undergo a final verification by a

BLANKS 

Two types of blanks have been inserted into the mainstream of assays for 

both the HBMS and Acme laboratories. One consists of fist size chunks of granite 

collected from a nearby road cut and the other a certified blank. As mentioned 

above, blanks are submitted into the sample stream as per the geologist 

instruction at regular intervals of every 20 samples. When fine pulps are 

resubmitted to either the HBMS or Acme laboratories, preference is given to the 

use of the certified blanks and often inserted immediately after higher grade 

material. 

 

STANDARDS 

PRIOR TO MAY 2009 

Several reference standards were used by HBED and are identified in Table 

13-3. These standards are certified by Ore Research & Exploration PTY Ltd. 

(ORE) of Australia. The polymetallic sulphide reference standards were prepared 

from material supplied by HBMS and vary from low grade through to very high 

grade copper and zinc samples. As mentioned above, standards are submitted 

into the sample stream as per the geologist instruction at regular intervals one of 

every 20 samples, independent of the estimated grade.

MAY 2009 

In addition to the above mentioned standards, two gold certified standards 

were purchased from Rocklabs of Australia in May 2009 and are identified in 

Table 13-4. The certified value of these standards is higher in gold value than the 

above mentioned standards used prior to May 2009. With discovery of higher 

grade gold intersections within designated zones, the purchase of these 

additional standards was warranted. The gold reference standards were 

submitted appropriately as part of a duplicate check program designed to 

recheck gold results at both the HBMS and Acme laboratories. These samples 

have been inserted into the fine pulp rechecks by the Qualified Persons.

14 DATA VERIFICATION 

QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 

A total of 30,886 samples from 86 parent holes and 49 wedges were sawn 

and submitted to the HBMS laboratory for assay. In addition to these samples, 

1,617 blanks and 1,601 reference standards were inserted and submitted into the 

mainstream of samples, representing approximately 10.4% of the samples from 

drilling.  

 

Assays of fine pulp material, or duplicate samples, were run by the HBMS 

laboratory on 1,088 of the submitted samples. Duplicate samples were analyzed 

by the HBMS laboratory then shipped to Acme for comparison and verification 

purposes as part of the external QA/QC process. 

 

BLANKS 

A total of 1,617 blank non-mineralized granite samples and certified blanks 

were submitted to the HBMS laboratory to test for cross-contamination from 

sample to sample. Of the 1,617 samples assayed, 679 reported nil values for 

gold, 1,584 reported nil values for silver, 1,577 reported nil values for copper and 

1,421 reported nil values for zinc and are summarized in Table 14-1.

CERTIFIED STANDARDS 

The reference standard analyses from the HBMS Flin Flon assay laboratory 

for all standards show good precision of the laboratory between the copper and 

zinc best values. However, many of the Series 4 zinc results are lower than the 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 14-2 

reference standard best values, due to the use by the HBMS laboratory of aqua 

regia digestion rather than total digestion that was used during certification of the 

Series 4 values. Certification for the Series 5 values was done solely by aqua 

regia. Nonetheless, the lower values returned for the Series 4 standards suggest 

a slight conservatism of the zinc values used for the mineral resource estimate. 

 

Of the 1,601 reference standards submitted, five were from Series 3, 284 

from Series 4 and 1,310 Series 5. Two of the reference standards were not from 

Series 3, 4 or 5.

GOLD 

With the discovery of the precious metal intersections and focused diamond 

drilling on potential gold zones over the past few months, there has been 

particular attention placed on the assay results of the gold duplicates between 

laboratories and quantification of assay differences due to analytical methods. 

Historically the HBMS laboratory uses atomic absorption spectrometry after fire 

assay and the Acme laboratory uses an ICP emission spectrometry after fire 

assay. Although the R
2
 value for gold has been quite high, a slight bias was 

suspected when sample results were plotted against a 1:1 correlation line (see 

Figure 14.1). Acme results appeared to be reporting slightly lower than HBMS 

results.  

 

To test for bias, an additional 1,839 fine pulp rejects from the potential gold 

zone drill holes were shipped to the Acme laboratory for analysis. This larger 

data set was considered to be more representative of the potential gold zone 

expected values. The shipment included 61 certified blanks inserted immediately 

after the higher grade gold samples and 100 certified standards inserted

approximately every 20th sample. Analytically all samples were to be ICP-ES 

after fire assay and those samples reporting > 10 g/t were then required to be 

gravimetrically finished. 

 

Figure 14-5 displays the comparison of the 1,839 gold check assays from 

HBMS and Acme laboratories. Results appear good based on a calculated R
2
 

value of 0.9721. However of the 1839 check assays, 73.6% of the assays 

reported from Acme were slightly lower in value in comparison to HBMS 

regardless of the grade class. A detailed analysis of the results is seen in Table 

14.2.

mineral resources and potential gold zones: 

 

 Priority 1  Acme gold assay results 

 Priority 2  HBMS gold assay results adjusted as follows 

  Assay values < 10 g/t downgraded 10% 

     Assay values 10 to 30 g/t downgraded 16% 

     Assay values > 30 g/t downgraded 10% 

 

The QA/QC program is ongoing and is being monitored closely. Over the next 

few months 10% of the 1,839 fine pulp rejects analyzed by Acme will be sent to 

another independent third party laboratory for analysis as a check on the Acme 

results. 

 

DRILL HOLE DATABASE MANAGEMENT 

Drill hole data (header, geological intervals, sample intervals, and QAQC) are 

logged by the geologists into the local Lagger database for the project. Drill hole 

validation is performed within Lagger to check for validity of reported lengths, 

geology intervals, and sample intervals such that there are no overlapping 

intervals, duplicate sample numbers, etc. Specific gravity measurements and 

geotechnical details are stored within Excel spreadsheets. Once the drill hole 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 14-7 

data has been reviewed by the on-site project geologist the Lagger and SG files 

are emailed to the HBED Lagger database manager. 

 

On receipt of the Lagger log, the HBED database manager also checks for 

inconsistencies with the data. Drill hole locations and other header data are 

double checked against the records (grid maps, UTM maps, and daily drill 

reports). On receipt of the analytical request, the sheet is reviewed by the 

database manager to ensure it is uniquely identified and properly completed. The 

QC sheet is also examined to ensure the sheet and the Lagger log are in 

agreement (project number, number of samples, spelling of sample numbers, 

misspelled duplicates, mistaken duplicates). Any discrepancies are brought to 

the attention of the project geologist or the core technician. Once the HBED 

project manager is satisfied with the drill hole input data, the Lagger database 

project files are stored on the HBMS network and then uploaded to the HBMS 

acQuire database management system monitored by the Mines Technical 

Services (MTS) department. All information is stored and linked directly to the 

original logging input sheets from Lagger kept in PDF format. 

 

On receipt of the printed daily report from the HBMS laboratory, the analytical 

results for assay intervals are uploaded directly into the acQuire database 

system using the sample number as the identifier. QC results are examined and 

any discrepancies are flagged and reported either back to the laboratory or to the 

HBED database manager. The HBED database manager also compares the 

analytical results to the logged visual estimates for copper, zinc and iron. 

Discrepancies are brought to the attention of the project geologist and re-

assaying may be requested if the significance of the interval is warranted. 

 

Assay results from the external Acme laboratory are kept in the acQuire 

database as unique identified variables. This information is readily available and 

can be easily charted directly from the database system. 

 

Drill core is stored at the HBED Hangar site near Flin Flon and at the core 

logging facility near the Snow Lake concentrator. Fine pulp rejects are kept in 

perpetuity in lidded plastic pails at the HBED Hangar.

MINERAL RESOURCE DATABASE MANAGEMENT 

All information used in the estimation of the mineral resources and potential 

gold zones was extracted directly from the HBMS acQuire database 

management system managed by the MTS department. The MineSight software 

package used for the 3D modeling and grade interpolation downloads 

information directly from this database.  

 

In the author's opinion, the drill hole and assay database is acceptable for 

resource estimation.

16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 

A Phase 1 metallurgical testwork program on the Lalor deposit was completed 

in May 2009 by SGS Canada Incorporated (SGS) in Vancouver, British 

Columbia. The purpose of the testwork was to perform a preliminary evaluation of 

the deposit to establish the basic mineral composition and associations, and to 

determine if there would be any issues treating the mineralization by conventional 

methods. SGS has been established in Canada since 1948 and has since built 

upon its unique capabilities in grinding and flotation to emerge as an industry 

leader in a full range of metallurgical testing services. 

 

A total of 637 samples from 9 holes with a total weight of 1,616.6 kg were 

received by SGS on October 15, 2008. The samples were weighed and 

inventoried. Each sample was identified as one of nine different mineralization 

types by HBMS and HBED (see summary Table 16-1). SGS was instructed to 

prepare these nine mineralization types prior to making eight test charges. The 

nine mineralization types were representative of base metal and precious metal 

intersections from the Lalor deposit at the time of collection.

Page 16-2 

Some 379 samples representing the nine mineralization types were selected 

from 637 inventoried samples. Individual samples in each mineralization type 

were combined to make nine composites. Each of the nine composites was 

crushed to minus ½ inch. 

 

A 20 kg charge after homogenizing was split by riffling from each of the four 

mineralization types, A, B, 10Au and 20Au, for Bond Rod Mill Work Index testing. 

The remaining material (after taking Bond Rod Mill Work Index testing samples) 

and the other 5 composites, 20C, 40C, D, E, and Contact Gangue, were then 

each staged crushed to (-)6 mesh. A 15 kg charge after homogenizing was taken 

by riffling from each of the four mineralization types. A, B, 10Au and 20 Au were 

used for Bond Ball Mill Work Index testing. 

 

All of the nine composites were then staged crushed to (-)10 mesh and 

homogenized to make eight test charges for gravity concentration and flotation 

testing. Duplicate head samples of each of the nine composites were cut and 

sent for chemical assays and mineralogical analyses. These nine homogenized 

samples were used to create eight blended test charges. The following four base 

metal test charges were made first: 

 

Charge 1 – Type A sample plus gangue 

Charge 2 – Type B sample plus Type E and gangue 

Charge 3 – Combined Type A & B 

Charge 4 – Combined Type A, B, C, D and E 

 

Due to the occurrence of substantial gold in the immediate hanging wall and 

footwall of some base metal intersections, SGS was directed to blend the base 

metal charges by adding homogenized 10Au and 20Au to each of charges 1 

through 4 to create charges 5 to 8. 

 

Chemical assays and ICP scan were conducted on the test charges. The 

head assay results of the eight test charges are shown in Table 16-2.

Mineralogical work was conducted on the eight test charges. A total of four 

polished sections were prepared for analysis by QEMSCAN. The analytical 

method used was Particle Mineralogical Analysis (PMA), a two dimensional scan 

of the surface of the polished section, and a Sparse Mineral Search where only 

the target minerals were sough to boost the mineralogical statistics on the 

minerals of value. A total of 1.4 million particles were analysed containing 155 

million analytical points. The pixel spacing was 1.5 to 3 microns, the minimum 

grain size detectable. 

 

The data described in Table 16-3 details the modal abundance of the mineral 

constituents in the eight test charges.

The Lalor zinc rich base metal resource is mainly coarse grained 

copper/zinc/lead/gold/silver mineralization exhibiting good response to 

conventional metallurgy. The iron sulphide content, mainly pyrite is high. Lead is 

present as galena, copper almost exclusively as chalcopyrite (with minor bornite) 

and zinc as sphalerite (with very minor zinc spinels). 

 

Grindability testing resulted in Bond Ball Mill Work Indices (BWI) of 10.2 to 

13.4 kWh/t. 

 

There was a moderate response to gravity concentration for gold with gravity 

concentrates at grades of 31.7 to 91.6 g/t achieved. 

 

All charges responded very well to conventional flotation and very good 

copper/zinc separation was obtained with over 90% of the copper recovered to 

the copper rougher concentrates and approximately 90% of the zinc recovered to 

the zinc rougher concentrates. Separation was achieved at a rather coarse 

primary grind size (K80 of 100 µm). 

 

Smeltable copper concentrates with high copper recoveries were obtained 

from some charges, but the copper concentrate grades of the remaining charges 

were relatively low due to the high lead content in the concentrates though the 

copper recoveries were high.  

 

Good quality zinc cleaner concentrates were obtained from all eight charges 

at good recoveries. The zinc recoveries in open circuit were 83.2% - 88.2% at 

53.0% - 62.5% Zn grades. 

 

Results of two-stage copper and zinc cleaner testing are shown in Table 16-4.

After a review of the SGS data, it was concluded by HBMS: 

 

• The Lalor mineralization is typical to the base metal ores mined in the 

Chisel Basin. 

 

• The mineralization is mostly coarse grained and exhibits a high degree 

of liberation at a relatively coarse grind (100 µm). This would normally

Page 16-7 

indicate that a very good metallurgical response can be expected with 

this mineralization. However, high iron content is also evident and this 

may lead to a more difficult upgrading of concentrates. 

 

• The high degree of mineral liberation has led SGS to predict excellent 

copper and zinc recoveries for the Lalor deposit. 

 

• Grind data indicates work indexes are similar to most of the ores 

HBMS treats. 

 

• Phase II metallurgical testing is required. 

 

PHASE II METALLURGICAL TESTING PROGRAM 
OBJECTIVES 

 

BASE METAL ZONE 

The objective is to produce three saleable copper/lead/zinc concentrates at 

high recoveries with maximizing gold and silver metal recoveries. A flowsheet will 

be developed. 

 

GOLD ZONE 

The objective is to determine the best processing method and then optimize 

the metallurgical performance using standard gold ore processing methods 

including gravity, flotation and cyanidation leaching. A flowsheet will be 

developed. 

 

BLENDED ZONES 

The objective is to determine the best processing method from blended 

material to produce three saleable copper/lead/zinc concentrates at high 

recoveries with maximizing gold and silver metal recoveries. A single flowsheet 

will be developed. 

 

Phase II metallurgical testwork is expected to be completed in the second 

quarter of 2010.

17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL 
RESERVE ESTIMATES 

ZINC RICH BASE METAL MINERAL RESOURCES SUMMARY 

The Lalor zinc rich base metal estimate was prepared by Robert Carter, 

P.Eng., HBMS, under the direct supervision of Kimberley Proctor, P.Geo., HBMS. 

The estimate was completed using MineSight 4.60-01 block modeling software in 

UTM NAD83 coordinates (MineSight). The block model was constrained by 

interpreted 3D wireframes of the zinc rich base metal mineralized zones. Gold, 

silver, copper, zinc, lead, and iron grades and specific gravity were estimated into 

blocks using Ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolation. Zone intersections were 

selected based on a minimum 4% Zinc Equivalency formula (ZNEQ) over a two 

metre core length. The ZNEQ was calculated from metal price and metal 

recovery assumptions, with economic contributions from gold, silver, copper and 

zinc. Each block was assigned a ZNEQ and an associated dollar value 

equivalent. 

 

The mineral resource estimate, at the 4% ZNEQ cut-off, is summarized in 

Table 17-1 below:

Notes:  
1. CIM definitions were followed for the estimation of mineral resources. 
2. Mineral resources are estimated at ZNEQ cut-off of 4% (ZNEQ% equals Zn% + Cu% x 

2.352 + Au g/t x 0.867 + Ag g/t x 0.014) and a minimum two metre true width. 
3. Long term $US metal prices of $700/oz gold, $12.00/oz silver, $2.00/lb copper and 

$0.85/lb zinc were used for the estimation of ZNEQ. 
4. Metal recovery assumptions of 65% gold, 60% silver, 90% copper and 90% zinc were 

used for the estimation of ZNEQ. 
5. Specific gravity measurements were taken on a large portion of the samples, where 

actual measurements were not available stoichiometric values were calculated.

ZINC EQUIVALENCY 

Due to the polymetallic nature of the Lalor deposit, a ZNEQ formula was 

derived based on metal price and metal recovery assumptions supplied by 

HudBay (Table 17-2). 

 

ZNEQ% = Zn% + ((Cu% x (Cu Value in US$ per %)/(Zn Value in US$ per %)) 

x (Cu Recovery/Zn Recovery) + ((Au g/t x (Au Value in US$ per g/t)/(Zn Value in 

US$ per %)) x (Au Recovery/Zn Recovery)) + ((Ag g/t x (Ag Value in US$ per 

g/t)/(Zn Value in US$ per %)) x (Ag Recovery/Zn Recovery)) 

 

TABLE 17-2   METAL PRICE AND METAL RECOVERY ASSUMPTIONS 

HudBay Minerals Inc. – Lalor Deposit 

 

Product Metal Price (US$) Metal Recovery (%) US$ Equivalent 

Gold 700.00/oz 65 14.63 per g/t 

Silver 12.00/oz 60 0.23 per g/t 

Copper 2.00/lb 90 39.68 per % 

Zinc 0.85/lb 90 16.87 per % 

 

The metal prices are based on HudBay long term equilibrium assumptions of 

the metal market. The metal recovery assumptions are in line with the Chisel 

North, Trout Lake and 777 Mines, and concentrators at Snow Lake and Flin Flon, 

Manitoba, operated by HBMS. An exchange rate of 1.10 C$ per US$ is assumed. 

 

In selecting drill hole intersections for the mineral resource estimate, a 

minimum of 4% ZNEQ over a two metre core length, or 8 m%, was required. This 

equates to US$67.48/t of metal value using the metal price and metal recovery 

assumptions in the ZNEQ formula. 

 

The minimum US$67.48/t of metal value is justified from the operating costs 

at Chisel North Mine, which are on the order of C$70/t for low angle post pillar cut 

and fill mining method. 

 

The Lalor zinc rich base metal deposit is a natural occurrence of copper and 

zinc mineralization and in most cases the contacts are defined as the boundary 

between potentially economic massive sulphide material and weakly mineralized

Page 17-3 

low grade mineralization with no economic potential. This is similar to the 

adjacent Chisel North Mine where generally no hard cut-off is required for 

resource estimation. No sensitivities for cut-off grade determination were 

therefore completed on the zinc rich base metal zones and it was assumed that 

there is no base metal mineral resource at grades lower than the applied 

minimum ZNEQ. 

 

WIREFRAME MODELS 

Copper and zinc mineralized intersections were geologically interpreted and 

assays were integer coded to reflect the particular lens of mineralization. In total, 

six stacked lenses or zones of zinc-rich polymetallic near solid to solid sulphide 

mineralization were identified, approximately 570 m to 1,160 m below surface, 

occurring at or near the top of hydrothermally altered felsic rocks. 

 

Zinc rich base metal mineralization at Lalor is generally near solid (semi-

massive) to solid (massive) sulphides, but portions can be disseminated to 

stringer sulphides, with no distinct marker horizons other than being extensively 

altered and recrystallized by metamorphism to form a rather exotic mineral 

assemblage in the footwall rocks. 

 

The zinc rich mineralization associated with each zone was interpreted into 

three-dimensional wireframes based on the ZNEQ of 4% over a minimum two 

metre interval. The interpreted lenses were built by digitizing polylines around the 

mineralization on 25 m spaced vertical sections cut at an azimuth of 040°. 

Polylines were linked with tag strings and triangulated to create three-

dimensional wireframe solids (see plan view showing mineralized outlines in 

Figure 17-1 and three dimensional views in Figures 17-2 and 17-3). Polyline 

interpretations were verified in a second direction 90° to the primary at 130° 

azimuth. In general, the mineralization was projected either less than half the drill 

hole spacing or halfway to a low grade or unmineralized hole along the perimeter 

of the lens. Wireframe volumes and drilling information, shown in Table 17-3, 

have been validated in MineSight, with no errors.

The top two lenses of the stacked base metal zones (coded as Zone 11 and 

10) with higher grade zinc and iron content have similar trend and dip at 310°/     

-30°. Zone 11 appears to be a thin high-grade zinc splay off Zone 10, which is 

consistent with what has been geologically modeled and mined at the Chisel 

North Mine. Zone 11 is located 2.5 m to 20 m to the hanging wall of Zone 10. 

 

The footwall lenses coded as Zones 20, 30, 31 and 40 have moderate to high 

zinc grades hosted in near solid sulphides containing higher grade gold and 

locally appreciable amounts of copper. These lenses have a similar trend and dip 

at 270°/-20°. 

 

Overall, Zones 10 and 20 have the largest extent and volume of 

mineralization. Zone 10 covers approximately 450 m in the east-west and 600 m 

in the north-south direction and Zone 20, 450 m in the east-west and 900 m in 

the north-south direction.

Specific gravities were measured by HBED geologists and technicians on 

84% of the sampled assay intervals included in the zinc rich base metal resource 

estimation for a total of 1,649 measurements. A summary of all the measured SG 

values incorporated into the resource estimation is displayed in Table 17-4.

The measured SG values were compared to calculated stoichiometric values 

for each sample for confirmation. A simple XY plot of the comparison is shown in 

Figure 17-4 with a derived R
2
 value of 0.9066, indicating a high degree of 

correlation between the values. The stoichiometric method uses the assayed 

percentages of copper, zinc, lead, iron and arsenic to calculate the percentage of 

chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, pyrite and arsenopyrite, respectively, in each 

sample. Stoichiometric (calculated) density and proportions of each metal by 

mineral type are shown in Table 17-5. The percentage of elemental copper, zinc, 

lead and arsenic in each mineral is added, where the total for each sample must 

add to 100%, so the remainder (1 subtract total metals measured) was assumed 

to be gangue material with a 2.70 SG.

RESOURCE ASSAY STATISTICS 

A total of 1,958 mineralized assay intervals from 58 parent drill holes and 31 

wedge offsets were selected as defining the zones of zinc rich base metal 

mineralization on the property. The remainder of the holes are located on the 

fringe of the deposit and are either not mineralized or contain weak mineralization 

not meeting the ZNEQ cut-off criteria, or were drilled for metallurgical purposes.

CAPPING OF HIGH GRADES 

In order to avoid any disproportionate influence of random, anomalously high 

grade assays on the resource average grade, histograms, cumulative frequency 

log probability charts, cutting curves, and decile analysis charts were created to 

examine the assay grade distribution within the zinc rich mineralized lenses and 

assess the need for grade capping. Skewness and high-grade outliers to the 

distribution can lead to overestimation of average grades unless some means of 

moderating the effect of the highest grade samples is applied. A common method 

for accomplishing this is by top cutting (or cap) high assays at some 

predetermined level prior to grade estimation. In reviewing the assay statistics by 

zone it was decided to cap high grade gold assays for each zone, while the high 

grade silver assays were only capped for Zones 10, 20 and 31. The capped 

value and the number of affected assays are shown in Table 17-8. High-grade 

assays were capped prior to compositing.

COMPOSITE CONTROL INTERVALS 

After capping, assay samples were weighted by SG and composited into two 

metre downhole lengths while honouring the interpreted mineralized zone 

boundaries. Compositing of downhole assays results in a fractional length for the 

last sample in a given zone. Where this length is less than one metre, it was 

average weighted with the adjacent up-the-hole composite. Table 17-9 shows the 

composite summary information by zone and metal type used in estimating the 

resource. Data analysis was conducted by creating probability and histogram 

plots of the selected data as shown in Appendix 2.

COMPOSITE RESTRICTION 

A review of the probability and histogram plots from the composite data 

showed some high grade values were spatially discontinuous from the remainder 

of the data set and there was justification of restricting these higher grade values 

by limiting their search distance. The high grade values shown in Table 17-10 

were restricted to a 30 m influence for grade interpolation, which is approximately 

half the drill hole spacing.

MINERALIZATION CONTINUITY AND VARIOGRAPHY 

Correlograms, using MineSight software, were completed on the gold, silver, 

copper, zinc, lead, iron and SG composites. Combined composite data from 

Zones 10 and 11 were used in the correlograms, as well as combined composite 

data from Zones 30, 31 and 40. Zone 20 with the greatest number of composites 

was modeled independently. The reason for combining composites from zones 

for the variography process was to increase the number of composites from like 

mineralization and as a result get a better feel for the spatial continuity. Zones 10 

and 11 have a similar mineralized trend with higher zinc and iron percentages 

than in the other zones, whereas Zones 30, 31 and 40 have similar mineralized 

trends with moderate zinc and disseminated to near solid sulphide material. Prior 

to combining the composites they were spatially moved so pairs between the 

zones were not developed. 

 

Correlograms were generated to determine the orientation and spatial 

continuity of the composited mineralization and bulk density. A summary of the 

results is shown in Table 17-11, with plots presented in Appendix 3.

BLOCK MODELING 

One three-dimensional block model was constructed that contained all zones 

of mineralization using MineSight on UTM NAD83 coordinates with an origin at 

429,000 m east, 6,083,000 m north and 350 RL elevation. Block dimensions of 

10 m by 10 m by 10 m were selected based on the average width of the resource

wireframes, as well anticipation of the smallest mining unit based on the current 

underground mining practices at the Chisel North Mine. Block model geometry 

and parameters are provided in Table 17-12.  The model encompasses a volume 

of 28 billion m
3
 and extends to -1400 elevation (1,750 m elevation from surface).

GRADE INTERPOLATION AND SEARCH STRATEGY 

The interpolation of the Lalor zinc rich resource estimation model was 

completed on the capped composites using restriction searches to a distance of 

30 m by the following estimation methods: nearest neighbour (NN), inverse 

distance squared weighted (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK). 

 

The estimates using NN and two iterations using IDW and OK were 

completed on each zone. The first iteration was designed to estimate a block 

using the search distance parameters and minimum number of composites when 

the criteria in Table 17-13 were met. The second pass reduced the search 

distance and increased the minimum number of composites, with the exception 

of Zone 11, in an attempt to more closely model the local composite grades. In 

both passes, a minimum of two drill holes were required to estimate a block. The 

minimum and maximum number of composites was directed by the average 

thickness of the mineralization in each zone.

Rotation angles for the ellipsoid were derived from the variography process, 

which closely resembles the average strike and dip of the zones. The major 

search distance is parallel to the plunge of the mineralization, the minor search 

distance is parallel to the strike of the mineralization, and the vertical search 

distance corresponds to the thickness of the mineralization.  

 

BLOCK MODEL VALIDATION 

The Lalor zinc rich resource estimate was validated by the following methods: 

• Inspection of the OK block model grades in plan and section views 

in comparison to the drill hole grades 

• Comparison of the global mean grades based on NN, IDW and OK 

estimation methods 

• Swath plot comparisons of the estimation methods 

• Comparison to September 2008 mineral resource estimate. 

 

VISUAL COMPARISON 

The block models were checked in plan and section views to compare block 

grades with the drill hole grades, and ensure that the interpolation honoured the 

composites. The visual comparisons of block grades with composite grades of

the gold, silver, copper and zinc showed a good correlation between the values 

(example shown in Figure 17-5).

GLOBAL COMPARISON 

The global block model estimation for the OK method was compared to the 

global estimation of the NN and IDW model values, as illustrated in Table 17-14. 

 

TABLE 17-14 GLOBAL COMPARISON BY ESTIMATION METHOD 

HudBay Minerals Inc. – Lalor Deposit 

       

Method Tonnes Au (g/t) Ag (g/t) Cu (%) Zn (%) SG 

NN 17,080,000 1.69 26.40 0.71 8.66 3.67 

IDW 17,473,000 1.49 24.69 0.65 9.14 3.72 

OK 17,321,000 1.51 24.56 0.64 8.90 3.69 

 

The OK and IDW methods provide similar results with less than a 1% grade 

difference. The OK and NN methods in general have comparable results, with 

slightly lower tonnes and higher gold, silver and copper values for the NN 

method. This is common for comparisons of this type owing to the smoothing that 

usually occurs in an IDW or OK type of estimate. A comparison of the individual 

zones gave similar results. 

 

SWATH PLOTS 

Swath plots were generated to assess the model for global bias by comparing 

OK values with NN and IDW values of the estimated blocks on elevation and 

north-south (northings) throughout the deposit (Figures 17-6 and 17-7).  The IDW 

and OK models appear to show a smoothing of the grades compared to NN 

method. The swath plot results show a good comparison among the three 

methods, particularly within the main portions of the deposit as indicated by the 

tonnage graph. Grade estimates show the greatest differences along the 

interpreted mineralized boundaries with limited tonnes, and within areas of lower 

data density.

COMPARISON TO SEPTEMBER 2008 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

In September 19, 2008 a NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate 

verified by Scott Wilson RPA on the Lalor deposit reported an indicated mineral 

resource of 3.4 million tonnes and an inferred mineral resource of 13.2 million 

tonnes. This resource estimate included assay information from 28 parent and 

five wedge holes defining six stacked zones of zinc rich mineralization on the 

property. The October 8, 2009 mineral resource estimate of the zinc rich 

mineralization at Lalor includes assay information from 58 parent and 31 wedge 

holes defining the same six stacked zones of zinc rich mineralization with an 

indicated mineral resource of 12.3 million tonnes and an inferred mineral 

resource of 5.0 million tonnes. The estimates are category compared in Table 17-

15 and 17-16.

The differences in tonnage, gold and silver are largely attributed to the 

addition of 30 parent holes and 26 wedge offsets that were drilled on the deposit 

since the September 19, 2008 estimate. Gold and silver grade differences are 

also due to QA/QC issues with the gold mentioned in Section 14 and 

reinterpretation of the 3D wireframe in Zone 20. Reinterpretation of Zone 20 has 

reallocated some assay intervals along the contacts of Zone 20 to potential gold

Zone 21. More details of the potential gold mineral deposit at Lalor is addressed 

in Section 18 Other Relevant Data and Information. 

 

MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 

Mineral resources have been classified according to the CIM Definition 

Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM definitions), as 

incorporated in NI 43-101. Resource blocks are classified as Indicated or 

Inferred, depending upon the confidence level of the resource based on 

experience with similar base metal deposits and the spatial continuity of the 

mineralization. No Measured Resources have been defined to date. 

 

Classification of the Indicated Resource is defined from the block model as 

follows: 

• Blocks estimated in the second pass 

• Blocks estimated by composites from at least three drill holes 

• Distance to closest composite is less than or equal to 50 m 

 

Although some areas of the zones fit the Indicated Resource criteria, a 

detailed review resulted in reclassification of proposed Indicated Resources to 

Inferred since Indicated Resource blocks must be contiguous and intersect with a 

minimum of two drill holes in order to eliminate the clustering of Indicated blocks 

surrounding one drill hole.  

 

The remainder of the blocks within the interpreted Zones were classified as 

Inferred Resources. There were no blocks assigned to the Measured category 

  

The location of Indicated and Inferred Resources for Zones 10, 20 and 30, as 

well as the Inferred Resources for Zones 11, 31 and 40 of the Lalor deposit are 

shown in Figures 17-8 to 17-13.

Notes:  
1. CIM definitions were followed for the estimation of mineral resources. 
2. Mineral resources are estimated at a ZNEQ cut-off of 4% (ZNEQ% equals Zn% + Cu% x 

2.352 + Au g/t x 0.867 + Ag g/t x 0.014) and a minimum two metre true width. 
3. Long term $US metal prices of $700/oz gold, $12.00/oz silver, $2.00/lb copper and   

$0.85/lb zinc were used for the estimation of ZNEQ. 
4. Metal recovery assumptions of 65% gold, 60% silver, 90% copper and 90% zinc were 

used for the estimation of ZNEQ. 
5. Specific gravity measurements were taken on a large portion of the samples, where 

actual measurements were not available stoichiometric values were calculated. 

 

Mineral resource estimates by classification and zone are tabulated in Tables 

17-18 and 17-19.

MINERAL RESERVES 

No pre-feasibility or feasibility study has been completed to allow conversion 

of the mineral resources to mineral reserves. Consequently no mineral reserves 

exist at the Lalor deposit at the present time.

18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND 
INFORMATION 

LALOR POTENTIAL GOLD ZONES 

The Lalor potential gold zones estimate is conceptual in nature and to date 

there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource compliant 

with National Instrument 43-101. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in 

the target deposit being delineated as a mineral resource. 

 

The Lalor potential gold zones estimate was prepared by Robert Carter, 

P.Eng., HBMS, under the direct supervision of Kimberley Proctor, P.Geo., HBMS. 

The estimate was completed using MineSight 4.60-01 block modeling software in 

UTM NAD83 coordinates. The block model was constrained by interpreted 3D 

wireframes of the gold mineralized zones. A 1.0 g/t gold cut-off over a two metre 

core length was used to determine the zone outlines for continuity purposes to 

build the 3D wireframes. Gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead, and iron grades and 

specific gravity were estimated into blocks using IDW interpolation. 

 

The potential gold zones estimate by zone, at the 1.0 g/t gold cut-off, is 

summarized by ranges in Table 18-1 below:

WIREFRAME MODELS 

Mineralized precious metal intersections were geologically interpreted and 

assays were integer coded to reflect the particular lens of mineralization. In total, 

five stacked lenses or zones of low sulphide precious metal intersections are 

either in contact with or occur as separate zones to the zinc rich base metal 

resources. The gold bearing zones occur 715 m to 1,175 m below surface, at or 

near the top of hydrothermally altered felsic rocks. 

 

Precious metal intersections of the Lalor potential gold zones contain low 

amounts of iron sulphide (4% to 5% on average) that is in the form of pyrite, 

pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. Generally minor amounts of galena and sphalerite 

occur. The intersections display no distinct marker horizons other than being 

extensively altered to form rather exotic mineral assemblages. 

 

The mineralization associated with each potential gold zone was interpreted 

into 3D wireframes based on the 1.0 g/t cut-off over a minimum two metre 

interval. The interpreted lenses were built by digitizing polylines around the 

mineralization on 25 m spaced vertical sections cut at azimuth of 040°. Polylines 

were linked with tag strings and triangulated to create 3D wireframe solids (see 

plan view showing mineralized outlines in Figure 18-1 and 3D views in Figures 

18-2 and 18-3 of the potential gold zones). Polyline interpretations were verified 

in a second direction 90° to the primary at 130° azimuth. In general, the 

mineralization was projected either less than half the drill hole spacing or halfway 

to a low grade or unmineralized hole along the perimeter of the lens. Wireframe 

volumes and drilling information, shown in Table 18-2 have been validated in 

MineSight, with no errors. 

 

The interpreted potential gold is generally co-parallel and is separate to the 

zinc rich base metal mineral resource zones. However, potential gold zones 

locally merge, overlap and cut through zinc rich base metal resources as is the 

case with potential gold Zones 21, 25 and 26. 

 

Although the interpretation of the potential gold Zones 21, 25 and 26 either 

merge, overlap or cut through zinc rich base metal zones the wireframes were 

intersected and any overlapping volume was removed from the corresponding

double counting of tonnes.

west and 570 m in the north-south direction and potential gold Zone 25, 360 m in 

the east-west and 850 m in the north-south direction. All the potential gold zones 

have similar trends and dip between 270° to 290°/-15° to -20°.

BULK DENSITY 

Specific gravities were measured by HBED geologists and technicians on 

61% of the sampled assay intervals included in the potential gold zones for a 

total of 879 measurements. A summary of all the measured SG values that were 

part of the potential gold zones is displayed in Table 18-3.

The measured SG values were compared to calculated stoichiometric values 

and samples not SG measured were stoichiometric calculated similarly to the 

zinc rich base metal mineral resource in Section 18 Bulk Density. 

 

POTENTIAL GOLD ASSAY STATISTICS 

The gold emplacement and interpretation of potential gold Zones 21 and 25 

where they either merge, overlap or cut through the zinc rich Zone 20 resource 

and the associated gold and silver assays in these circumstances were coded as 

potential gold Zones 21 and 25. It is not the author's interpretation that the 

associated copper, zinc, lead, iron and SG values in the mentioned 

circumstances were deposited or emplaced in this merging, overlapping or cross 

cutting fashion were not coded as potential gold Zones 21 or 25. Therefore the 

gold and silver assay statistics of the potential gold Zones 21 and 25 have more 

records than the copper, zinc, lead, iron and SG values.

Page 18-10 

A total of 1,820 mineralized assay intervals from 45 parent drill holes and 21 

wedge offsets were selected as defining the precious metal mineralization for the 

potential gold zones on the property. The copper, zinc, lead, iron and SG values 

were selected as defining the potential gold zones from 1,452 mineralized assay 

intervals. The remainder of the holes are located on the fringe of the potential 

gold zone deposit and are either not gold mineralized, contain weak 

mineralization, coded as the zinc rich mineral resources or were drilled for 

metallurgical purposes. 

 

Samples were grouped according to their interpreted potential gold 

mineralization zones. Sample statistics of the assayed information are shown in 

Table 18-4. Data analysis was conducted by creating probability and histogram 

plots of the selected data.

CAPPING OF HIGH GRADES 

In order to avoid any disproportionate influence of random, anomalously high 

grade assays on the conceptual estimate of the potential average grade, 

histograms, cumulative frequency log probability charts, cutting curves, and 

decile analysis charts were created to examine the assay grade distribution 

within the potential gold zones and assess the need for grade capping. 

Skewness and high-grade outliers to the distribution can lead to overestimation of 

average grades unless some means of moderating the effect of the highest grade 

samples is applied. A common method for accomplishing this is by top cutting (or 

cap) high assays at some predetermined level prior to grade interpolation. In 

reviewing the assay statistics by zone high grade assays and SG for each 

potential gold zone were capped. The capped value and the number of affected 

assays are shown in Table 18-5. Capping was applied prior to compositing.

COMPOSITE CONTROL INTERVALS 

After the capping criteria was applied, assay samples were weighted by SG 

and composited into full length composites from hanging wall to footwall contact 

while honouring the interpreted potential gold mineralized zone boundaries. This 

method of full length compositing naturally reduces the grade variability. Table 

18-6 shows the composite summary information by potential gold zone and metal 

type used in the conceptual estimate.

maximum continuity. As a result, a kriged conceptual estimate model was not 

used for the interpolation. With an increase in the number of composites by 

additional drilling, variography should again be attempted.  

 

BLOCK MODELLING 

One three-dimensional block model was constructed that contained all 

potential gold zones of mineralization using MineSight on UTM NAD83 with the 

same coordinates and geometries for the zinc rich mineral resource as discussed 

in Section 18 Block Modeling. 

 

GRADE INTERPOLATION AND SEARCH STRATEGY 

The interpolation plan of the Lalor potential gold zones conceptual estimate 

was completed on the capped composites by inverse distance squared weighted 

(IDW). 

 

The conceptual estimate was interpolated with two iterations of IDW for each 

potential gold zone. An ellipsoid with rotation angles as defined in Table 18-7 was 

used which conformed to the interpreted mineralization trend of the potential gold 

zones.

The first iteration was designed to estimate a block using the search distance 

parameters and minimum number of composites when the criteria in Table 18-8 

were met. The second pass reduced the search distance and increased the 

minimum number of composites, in an attempt to more closely model the local

SUMMARY OF LALOR POTENTIAL GOLD ZONES 

The Lalor potential gold zones estimate is conceptual in nature and to date 

there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource compliant 

with National Instrument 43-101. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in 

the target deposit being delineated as a mineral resource. 

 

The potential gold zones estimate by zone, at the 1.0 g/t gold cut-off, is 

summarized by ranges in Table 18-9 below:

DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL GOLD ZONES 

The limited amount of drilling to date, lack of perceived continuity and the 

variability of the high-grade precious metal intersections of the potential gold 

zones precludes their inclusion into the current mineral resource estimate. The 

potential gold zones at Lalor require testing of the near distance variability. This 

testing will help characterize the deposit for mineralization type and continuity.  

 

SOCIO-ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF EXPLORATION 
ACTIVITIES 

There are no known issues with local communities or indigenous peoples. 

There is strong community support, as the population and workforce of Snow 

Lake would benefit from the potential exploitation of these resources.  

 

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE 

The predominant vegetation in the region of the Lalor deposit is black spruce 

and jack pine, with a scrub layer and ground cover of lichens and mosses.  This 

vegetation is typical of the boreal forest in bedrock dominated terrain. Many 

bedrock areas have a patchy cover of small-growth trembling aspen, jack pine 

stands, areas of birch, or grass or shrub dominated vegetation. 

 



Lalor Deposit, Snow Lake, Manitoba 
NI 43-101 Technical Report 

 
 

 

 
 

Page 18-21 

The bog peatlands have stunted black spruce, moss, and shrub vegetation, 

while fens have sedge, brown moss, shrub and tamarack vegetation in varying 

mixtures. 

 

Wildlife in the region includes barren-ground caribou, moose, black bear, lynx, 

wolf, beaver, muskrat, snowshoe hare and red-backed vole.  Bird species include 

raven, common loon, spruce grouse, bald eagle, gray jay, hawk owl, and 

waterfowl, including ducks and geese. 

 

UMA Engineering Ltd. (Samoiloff, 2008) conducted a vegetation study as part 

of an EIS in the area of Lalor in September 2007. A portion of the survey involved 

ground truthing in order to confirm the presence or absence of endangered, 

threatened or special concern species within the project area, and also to 

conduct an inventory of botanical species within the project area in support of a 

desktop review.  No endangered or protected species were observed during the 

field program. 

 

RELATIONSHIP TO CURRENT MINING OPERATIONS 

Lalor is a key focus for HudBay, as it is located just three kilometres away 

from an existing road and mine and 18 km away from concentrate processing 

facilities. 

 

MARKETS 

The principal commodities at Lalor are freely traded, at prices that are widely 

known, so that prospects for sale of any production are virtually assured.

3. Long term $US metal prices of $700/oz gold, $12.00/oz silver, $2.00/lb copper and   

$0.85/lb zinc were used for the estimation of ZNEQ. 
4. Metal recovery assumptions of 65% gold, 60% silver, 90% copper and 90% zinc were 

used for the estimation of ZNEQ. 
5. Specific gravity measurements were taken on a large portion of the samples, where 

actual measurements were not available stoichiometric values were calculated. 

 

In addition to the mineral resources at Lalor, a conceptual estimate of the 

potential gold zones outside the mineral resources was completed. The potential 

gold zones are conceptual in nature and to date there has been insufficient 

exploration to define a mineral resource compliant with NI 43-101. It is uncertain 

if further exploration will result in the target deposit being delineated as a mineral 

resource. The results of this potential gold zones estimate by zone are shown in 

Table 19-2.

In the opinion of the author the drilling information was acquired using 

procedures that meet or exceed industry best practices. HBED and HBMS 

personnel were diligent in monitoring quality control assaying results. 

 

In the opinion of the author the additional drilling since the previously 

disclosed NI 43-101 report dated September 19, 2008 has exceeded the original 

expectations and as a result a large portion of the zinc rich base metal Inferred 

resources has been converted to Indicated resources and the first time disclosure 

of a conceptual estimate on the potential gold zones at Lalor.

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 

The author makes the following recommendations: 

 

1. Continue with current QA/QC program and closely monitor the gold 
assay results at the HBMS laboratory and the third party laboratory. 

 
2. Continue with the bulk density measurements of the drill core. 

 
3. Continue with "Activities at the Lalor Deposit" 

 

ACTIVITIES AT THE LALOR DEPOSIT 

The following activities are proceeding on the Lalor deposit: 

 

1. An approximate 10% of the samples assayed by Acme as part of 
the gold assay program completed in September 2009 are being 
prepared for shipment to an additional third party laboratory for 
verification.  

 
2. On October 8, 2009 HudBay approved an $85 million expenditure 

to fund the Lalor project Phase 1, which is a production ramp from 
its Chisel North mine to the Lalor deposit. The ramp is expected to 
provide early production of zinc-rich material and access to the 
potential gold zones for additional underground exploration. 
HudBay also plans to complete a pre-feasibility study by the end of 
this year and a feasibility study in 2010.  

 
3. A diamond drill program from surface is underway to test the 

potential gold zones variability and continuity of a 100 m by 100 m 
area on 25 m drill hole spacings. This drilling program is estimated 
to be completed by December 31, 2009 with 9,600 m at a cost of 
$2.5 million. 

 
4. Ongoing exploration efforts are underway to identity additional 

mineralization and define extensions to current mineralization. A 
program of 6,100 m from surface is planned to test this potential 
from October to December 2009 at a cost of $1.5 million.
