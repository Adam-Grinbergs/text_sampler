3.0 SUMMARY 

This technical report was commissioned by Lomiko Resources Inc to support their 
application for Tier 2 status on the TSX venture exchange 

The Big Nak property consists of the adjoining claim groups of Joss'alun and NAK, 
which collectively cover a total area of about 3,232 ha situated in the Atlin mining 
division of northern British Columbia some 80 km south, south-east of the town of Atlin. 
The initial discovery of the Joss'alun copper showing in 2002 was by geologists of the 
BC Geological Survey. Claim staking and subsequent exploration programs by Copper 
Ridge Explorations Inc, Tenajon Resource Corp and Imperial Metals Corp led to a further 
three copper showings being discovered.   

Imperial Metals Corp carried out a nine-hole 1,517 m diamond-drilling program with 
targets based on copper anomalies of a soil geochemical program. The drilling yielded 
encouraging core intercepts ranging from 68.06 m of 0.21% Cu, 17.75 m of 0.94% Cu, 
53.45 m of 0.34% Cu and 57.03 m of 0.10% Cu. 

Lomiko has entered into option agreement with Imperial Metals Corp and Copper Ridge 
Explorations Inc holders of the two overall claim blocks, which have been consolidated 
from the original claims. 

It is believed that mineralization on Big Nak suggests a classic Cypress-type environment 
for VMS copper mineralization with accompanying footwall stringer mineralization and 
alteration. Assay results show a close correspondence among visible sulphides and weak 
to moderate IP chargeability anomalies. 

A Phase I non-contingent budget estimated at $220,000 and a Phase II success contingent 
program estimated to cost  $245,000 is warranted and recommended.  Phase I would 
consist mapping, soil sampling, airborne Mag-EM survey and IP surveys. A Phase II 
program contingent on a successful Phase I program would consist of a 750 m core-
drilling program to test zones of higher chargeability and other prospective areas 
identified in the Phase I work is estimated to cost $245,000.  The total estimated costs for 
Phase I and II is $465,000.

7.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

7.1 Accessibility 
The property is accessible via helicopter, which can be chartered year round in the town 
of Atlin.  

7.2 Climate 
The area is in a relatively heavy snow belt with cold winters and moderate summers. The 
exploration season extends from early June to late September. 

7.3 Infrastructure 
There is no known infrastructure or mine workings on the property or nearby.  Sufficient 
water should be available for diamond drilling. The property lies in a broad U-shaped 
valley and there are sufficient surface areas available for potential waste disposal areas 
and process plant sites. The town of Atlin is the nearest population centre  

7.4 Physiography  
The claim area is mostly in the alpine zone, elevations range from 1,160 to 1,709 m.  

8.0 HISTORY 

8.1 Discovery 
BC Geological Survey geologists discovered the Joss'alun showing in the late summer of 
2002. A BC Government news conference was advertised for a September 13 release to 
provide the details of the discovery location. The Joss'alun showing Knack 1 & 2 were 
staked by Copper Ridge Explorations Inc and  approximately 2 km of prospective 
stratigraphy to the northwest was staked by Tenajon Resource Corp. ("Tenajon") on 
September 13, 2003, Imperial Metals acquired the D claims (D1-12) by way of staking, 
to cover about 2 km of prospective stratigraphy to the southeast of the Joss'alun showing 
on the following day. 

8.2 Prior Tenure 
On January 17, 2004, Copper Ridge purchased the Tenajon claims, subject to a 1% NSR, 
50% of which may be purchased by Copper Ridge for $250,000. Imperial then 
consolidated the three companies' positions by way of an option to earn 100% of the 
Copper Ridge and Tenajon claims, subject to the underlying agreement between Copper 
Ridge and Tenajon and also subject to the issuance of cash and shares to Copper Ridge 
and a 2% Net Operating Profits Royalty on the Knack 1 and 2 and D 1-12 claims.  

In 2004, Copper Ridge signed an agreement with Norsemont Mining Inc. whereby 
Norsemont would have the right to earn up to a 75% interest in the Joss'alun Property by 
issuing shares and making payments to Copper Ridge and completing a feasibility study. 



- 9 - 

8.2 Former Issuers Exploration 
Work completed by Imperial Metals during the summer of 2003 included a 1500 sample 
soil geochemical survey followed by a nine hole diamond drilling program to investigate 
the copper anomalies in the soils. Expenses for this program, as reported by Imperial 
Metals to Copper Ridge amounted to $365,651 (S. Robertson, Imperial Metals, pers. 
com.). Imperial Metals terminated its option in February 2004.  

During the period September 12 to 24, Norsemont completed a program of 4.55 km of 
line cutting and 4.6 km of IP surveying. The work was carried out under the direction of 
Copper Ridge and was contracted out to Aurora Geosciences of Whitehorse, Yukon.  

The IP surveys were completed over the Joss'alun showing and results showed a good 
correlation between chargeability and the drill-intersected mineralization on the Joss'alun 
showing. The cost for this program amounted to $44,808. In December 2005, Norsemont 
terminated its option to earn an interest in the Property. 

8.3 Others' Exploration 
The geology of the area of the Joss'alun project is described in Mihalynuk (2002) and 
Mihalynuk et al (2003). Regional work has been described by Mihalynuk and others in 
several publications arising from the Atlin Targeted Geoscience Initiative program – 
References.  

Work completed in 2003 included a Private-Public Partnership with the BC government, 
funded by Imperial Metals, including additional work on the Joss'alun property and 
regionally by Mitch Mihalynuk and his crew. Further work is described in a paper in the 
2003 Fieldwork publication (Mihalynuk, et.al. 2004).  

8.4 Issuer Exploration 
Lomiko has not completed any work on the Big Nak Property. 

9.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

9.1 Regional Geology 
The Big Nak property is situated in the Cache Creek terrane of the Canadian Cordillera. 
The Cache Creek oceanic crustal rocks are separated from the Laberge Group and 
overlying Sloko Group to the southwest by the Nahlin Fault and are bisected by the 
Silver Salmon Fault to the northeast of the Big Nak property (Mihalynuk 2002). 

9.2 Local Geology 
Cache Creek Group underlies the area of the Big Nak property.  Outcrops are moderate to 
well exposed on ridges but the valleys are characterized by talus and felsenmeer often 
covered by alpine vegetation,  

 



- 10 - 

9.3 Property Geology 
The Big Nak property is underlain by the Mississippian to Early Jurassic Cache Creek terrane 
with the dominant rock types being harzburgite, gabbro, submarine basalt flows, flow 
breccia, tuffaceous rocks and coarse, quartz-rich clastic strata (Mihalynuk, 2002) as shown in 
Figure 6. The rocks are exposed as an oblique section through an oceanic crustal sequence 
with the upper part of the section to the south and deeper rocks exposed to the north.  

Ultramafic Rocks 

The lower member of the crustal stratigraphic sequence is exposed at the far north end of 
the Property. It is comprised of harzburgite with lesser dunite. The chemistry and fabric 
of these rocks is consistent with mantle origin (Mihalynuk, 2002). The rocks are easily 
identified in hand specimen, weathering a distinct orange (harzburgite) or buff-dun 
(dunite) colour. They are often entirely serpentinized although they retain the weathering 
characteristics of resistant, large orthopyroxene phenocrysts within a matrix of olivine, 
giving a "knobby" appearance. 

Gabbro 

Gabbro is seen intermixed with the upper part of the ultramafic sequence, both as large 
boulders (to 100 m across or more) within highly serpentinized rocks and in intrusive 
contact. Above the ultramafics, gabbro occurs as a blocky, competent rock.  

Mafic Volcanics 

The mafic volcanic rocks occur as a thick sequence of typical submarine volcanic 
deposits. The base of the unit is a series of basaltic flows with hyaloclastite texture, 
interpillow lime mud and chert. The pillows are commonly 1 – 2 m across and individual 
pillow flows are on the order of 3 – 10 m thick. Up section, volcanic breccia is more 
common, intermixed with the massive pillow flows. Tuff content increases up section, 
with the finer dust and crystal tuffs observed near the top of the volcanic sequence. 

Both the Joss'alun and Box Lake showings are hosted in the pillowed flows and breccias 
in the lower section of the volcanic unit. As the copper mineralization appears to be at 
least in part syngenetic, determining the origin of the host rocks is important. The overall 
stratigraphy suggests that these rocks were formed in a spreading ridge setting (typical of 
Cypress type deposits). Some of the lithogeochemical work completed by Mihalynuk 
(personal comm., 2003) suggests back arc formation (potential for Kuroko type deposits). 

Neither model has yet been ruled out, although polymetallic mineralization, typical of 
Kuroko deposits, has not been identified on the Property. 

Clastic Sediments 

A thick sedimentary package unconformably overlies the mafic volcanics. This unit is 
dominated by coarse boulder and chert pebble conglomerates but has a significant 
component of quartz rich wackes and siltstones. The generally rounded cobbles and 



- 11 - 

boulders are derived from widely variable sources including chert, limestone, sandstone, 
volcanics and intrusives. Mihalynuk (2002) concludes that much of the source material 
for the clastic unit is the underlying Cache Creek terrane and suggests a deposition age of 
Triassic – Jurassic. No significant copper mineralization has been observed within this 
unit. 

Nakina River Stock and related porphyritic rocks. 

A small portion of a large hornblende-biotite granodiorite is exposed on the Property to 
the south of Jos Peak. It is reported by Mihalynuk (2002) to be part of the Nakina River 
Stock and is dated at Middle Jurassic. In several other areas of the Property small plugs 
or dykes of a very coarsely porphyritic phase related to the stock are observed. The 
plagioclase phenocrysts are up to 5 cm long and commonly over 1 cm long.

10.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The geological setting at Big Nak and the observed mineralization suggests a classic 
Cypress-type environment for massive seafloor VMS copper mineralization with 
accompanying footwall stringer mineralization and alteration. These deposits are 
commonly found in tholeiitic or calc-alkaline pillowed marine basalts and occur near a 
transition with overlying argillaceous sediments and chert.  Many of the deposits appear 
to be structurally controlled, with clusters of lenses aligned near steep normal faults.  

Cypress type deposits are typically comprised of one or more lenses of massive pyrite 
and chalcopyrite mineralization underlain by a well-developed pipe-shaped stockwork 
zone. Common associated minerals include marcasite and sphalerite while galena is less 
common.  The core of the stockwork zone is often characterized by intense, chlorite, 
sericite, carbonate and silica alteration, which can grade out into weaker albite and illite 
alteration. 

Cypress type deposits range widely in size but on average contain about 1.7 % Cu, 0 to 
33 g/t Ag, 0 to 1.9 g/t Au and 0 to 2.1 % Zn. 

11.0 MINERALIZATION 

Copper mineralization on the Property is relatively widespread. Four main showings 
occur on the property; Joss'alun, Jennusty, Bor Lake, and Box – Figure 2. In addition to 
those showings described below, malachite staining in the mafic volcanic rocks was 
commonly observed across the entire property. Small occurrences of chalcopyrite within 
gabbro have also been observed and appear to be remobilization of copper from the 
nearby volcanics. 

Joss'alun has exposed copper mineralization over a 110 m x 45 m wide zone on surface 
trending NNW and over a wider length in drill hole intercepts. Surface grab samples have 
returned up to 10% copper whereas the best drill intercept from hole NAK-03-05 
returned 1.15% Cu over 6.92 m apparent core length.  The Jennusty showing has copper 
mineralization exposed over a 20 m strike with widths of approximately 2 m. Bor 
showing is described as of equal size to Joss'alun but of lower grade.  Bor and Box Lake 
are less explored occurrences. All occurrences exhibit pod like mineralization, which is 
commonly described for Cypress type VMS mineralization.  

11.1 Joss'alun 
The original discovery of copper mineralization on the Joss'alun property continues to be 
the most significant. A full description of this showing is given in Mihalynuk, 2003. 
Selected grab samples have returned grades of over 10% copper and several grab samples 
have been collected with grades in the multiple percent range. Copper is present as 
chalcopyrite as disseminations, fracture fillings and pillow rinds. Evidence for both 
syngenetic and epigenetic mineralization is present although it is not unexpected that 
syngenetic mineralization would be commonly remobilized in this setting. 



- 13 - 

The most significant mode of occurrence for copper is the massive pods that form 
interstitially in the pillowed flows and flow breccias. The best copper mineralization is 
concentrated at the base of the mafic unit, with grade generally decreasing up section. 
The very poddy mineralization at Joss'alun prompted a program to conduct detailed 
sampling over the exposed area. The sampling on Joss'alun showing from the 2003 
program in Figure 4 shows grids, which relate to the claim boundaries plot in Figure 6. 

11.2 Box Lake 
The Box Lake showing lies some 2.0 km to the ESE of Joss'alun. The copper 
mineralization is equally widespread but in far less concentration than at Joss'alun. One 
possible explanation for this is that the stratigraphy exposed is higher level and perhaps 
the best mineralization is not exposed at surface in this area. It is also possible that this is 
on the periphery, along strike, of the mineralizing system as pyrite is in much greater 
abundance at Box Lake than in other volcanic hosted copper showings. Mineralization 
observed at Box Lake was either weak or only observed in talus (float) and therefore it is 
difficult to give a full assessment of this area. More work is required for this showing. 

11.3 Jennusty 
The Jennusty showing lies 1.7 km to the NNW of Joss'alun. The very rusty outcrop is 
visually distinct and can be easily seen from several kilometres distance. Small amounts 
of chalcopyrite and malachite were discovered in a highly oxidized gabbro host. 
Although the initial indications were that this was a very significant showing, subsequent 
work has proven the gabbroic host to be a knocker of limited size hosted within a 
serpentinite. 

11.4 Bor 
The Bor showing lies 2.25 km to the NW of Joss'alun. Chalcopyrite and pyrite 
mineralization are hosted within a series of brittle structures in gabbro. The strike of the 
host structures varies from 080 to 115 degrees. Mineralization is poddy and although up 
to 1 m wide, is discontinuous. Of the gabbro hosted copper showings discovered at 
Joss'alun, BOR is certainly the strongest, with some size potential. Three grab samples 
were collected at the showings, returning grades of 0.54% copper and 5.10% copper. The 
third sample returned "below detection limit" for copper. 

12.0 EXPLORATION 

12.1 Geochemical survey by prior issuer 
Initial exploration in July 2003, by Imperial Metals, on the property was a geochemical 
survey in of a 38 km grid made up of 31 north-south lines and three east-west tie-lines 
laid out to provide full coverage of those areas expected to have a significant potential for 
sulphide mineralization. Grid control was maintained by use of hand held GPS receivers. 
Figure 5 shows the layout at a small scale. Three contractor personnel from Coureur de 
Bois Ltd of Whitehorse carried out the grid work.

1,518 soil samples were multi element assayed and plots draughted for copper, zinc, gold 
and cobalt. Figure 5 shows the copper data.  

Anomalous copper results were found to correspond well with the mapped boundaries of 
the mafic volcanics in the Joss'alun area and found in the general vicinity of mafic 
stratigraphy elsewhere. 

Zinc results were found to weakly mirror the copper results in areas of overlying the 
volcanic stratigraphy although rarely associated with high zinc values in the gabbro.  

Gold anomalies were not coincident with copper and deemed to be an entirely separate 
population.  Cobalt results showed only weak anomalies in a few area and did not appear 
to have a good correlation with copper despite the association in many Cypress-type 
VMS deposits. 

Copper seems to be the best pathfinder for copper mineralization on the property. 

12.2 Prospecting and Mapping by prior issuer 
Preliminary prospecting resulted in the discovery of the Box lake and Jennusty copper 
showings to the south-east and north-west of the Joss'alun discovery. A later 1:10 000 
geological mapping over the whole of the property led to the discovery of the BOR 
structurally hosted copper mineralization. 

12.3 Geophysical Survey by prior issuer 
A five-person crew from Aurora Geosciences of Whitehorse, Yukon was contracted in 
September 2004 to carryout a programme of 4.55 km of line cutting and 4.7 km of IP 
surveying. Copper Ridge Explorations Inc by virtue of their then tenure of the claim area 
to be drilled, supervised the work. 

 The grid consisted of a 700 m baseline at an azimuth of 130o, and seven cross lines, 
ranging from 450 m to 750 m in length. The base line had Pickets were placed at 50 m 
intervals on the base line and 25 m intervals on the cross lines. The IP survey used a pole-
dipole array with 25 m dipole spacing and spacings of n=1 to n=6. Full survey details are 
reported in Belcourt (2005). The IP line grid and the 2003 drill holes targeted to test the 
Joss'alun showing are shown in Figure 6. Comparison of Figures 5 and 6 show the 
coincidence of the geochem Cu anomalies with the IP lines and drill holes. The modelled 
chargeability for six of the lines, L200E through to L300W, is shown below in Figures 7 
and 8.

Superimposed on the sections are the approximate locations of the drill holes, although it must 
be remembered that these holes are up to 50 m off section and some are oblique to the sections. 
The +0.5% copper intervals are shown on the sections. 

There is a clear correlation on L0E and L100W between the copper mineralized zones 
defined by drilling and a weak to moderate chargeability response. This correlation 
demonstrates that it is reasonable to conclude that the chargeability results could be 
reflecting disseminated to stockwork copper mineralization with concentrations in the 
range of 1% to 3% chalcopyrite, with minor narrow lenses of massive sulphide. Pyrite 
generally occurs with the chalcopyrite, but in subordinate amounts. These concentrations 
of predominantly disseminated sulphides would be consistent with the levels of 
chargeability reported in the survey.    
 
There are no other minerals reported in the drill logs that would be likely to give a 
chargeability effect. 
 
Of particular interest are zones of anomalously high chargeability on L200W and L300W 
– Figure 7 – south of the base line that could indicate a continuation of the sulphide 
mineralization. These anomalies represent a possible extension of the stockwork copper 
mineralization to the west. 
 
There are also variations in resistivity along all of the lines surveyed, although these 
variations show less readily correlated with known mineralization. In general, the 
southern portions of each section have higher resistivity, while the northern ends are 
lower resistivity. This could reflect an increase in ultramafic rocks and serpentinization, 
which would significantly reduce resistivity, to the north. 
 
Aurora Geosciences, who carried out the IP survey, are contractors. 

12.4 Lomiko exploration 
Lomiko Resources have not carried out any exploration on the property. 

13.0 DIAMOND DRILLING BY PRIOR ISSUER 

In 2003, a nine hole, 1517 m drilling programme was completed with drill sites and 
targets based on the copper anomalies of the prior soil geochemical survey. Figure 6 
shows the drill-holes sites and directions relative to the IP grid and claims Knack 1 and 2 
boundaries. 
 
The seven holes NAK-03-03 through NAK-03-09 targeted mineralization at the Joss'alun 
showing – Figure 6. Holes NAK-03-03 through NAK-03-07 intersected widespread 
copper mineralization hosted in the mafic volcanic stratigraphy. Copper occurs as 
stringers, disseminations and pods of mainly chalcopyrite with pyrite. Hole NAK-03-08 
intersected minor disseminated copper mineralization, but was drilled in a due south 
direction so could well have intersected the volcanic stratigraphy too high up in the 



- 21 - 

section. NAK-03-09, the most easterly drill hole, is also thought to have penetrated the 
volcanic stratigraphy too high to test the main copper bearing horizon. 

The two holes NAK-03-01 and NAK-03-02 were drilled to target the gabbro-hosted 
mineralization at the Jennusty showing. While these holes did intersect some minor 
chalcopyrite mineralization in gabbro, they were stopped short of their projected targets 
owing to difficult drilling conditions. All of the holes were on ground then held by 
Copper Ridge Explorations and now the subject of an option agreement with Lomiko 
Resources Inc.

The drilling therefore was successful in demonstrating the presence of significant widths 
of footwall stringer and semi-massive lenses of copper mineralization along at least a 
200 m strike length within the mafic volcanic unit. The mineralization is open both ways 
along strike and down dip. It is considered premature to estimate either mineralization 
orientation or dip such that a true thickness could be quoted. 

Drilling was carried out by Falcon Diamond Drilling from 31 August to 15 September 
2003. Core size was BQ drilled by thin-wall core bit. 

Lomiko Resources Inc has not completed any exploration drilling work on the Big Nak 
Property

14.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

14.1 Soils  
For the Imperil Metals Corp 2003 soil sampling program, a three-man crew from Coureur 
Des Bois Ltd., based in Whitehorse, installed a grid over the property, to provide full 
geochemical coverage over those areas expected to have significant potential for sulphide 
mineralization. Three east west tie lines were tight-chained and picketed while the north 
south lines were hip chained and slope corrected. Each member of the crew was equipped 
with a hand-held GPS unit and frequently checked the line placement to ensure accuracy. 
Stations were marked every 25 m over the entire grid with the exception of some lines 
near the Joss'alun showing where sample spacing was tightened up to 10 m.  
 
Soil was sampled over the entire grid area, except areas of boggy or extremely rocky 
ground. Samples were collected using shovels and mattocks with the average sample 
depth of 30 to 50 cm below surface. The material collected was usually 'B' horizon 
although the very poorly developed soil profile often made the distinction of different soil 
horizons difficult. 
 
All soil samples were placed into standard Kraft paper bags and labelled in the field. 
Labels reflected the grid location where the sample was collected. They were sorted, 
dried and stored in a tent at the camp until a large enough suite of samples was available 
to be packaged up and shipped. The samples were catalogued and sent by Greyhound to 
Acme Analytical Laboratory in Vancouver. A total of 1,518 soil and 50 talus samples 
were collected and analyzed. 
 
Any sample bias from collection either from line deviation or soil horizon is not 
considered significant for the requirements of the preliminary survey.  

14.2 Core  
Core was split on site and the traditional half, after bagging and labelling, sent for assay 
and the other half stored in the core box. However, no report was either prepared or 
issued for the drill program. However, we have confidence in that the program was under 
the control of a professional geologist.  

15.0 SAMPLING PREPARATION ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

All samples (soil, rock, core) collected by Imperial Metals Corp and Copper Ridge 
Explorations Inc were analyzed at Acme Analytical Laboratory Ltd in Vancouver.  
Samples were collected according to industry standards and were shipped in secure 
containers to the laboratory. 
 
Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd is currently certified with ISO 9001:2000 accreditation 
and was the first commercial geochemical analysis and assaying lab in North America to 
be accredited.  
  



- 23 - 

Initial analysis for all samples was by multi-element ICP or ICP-MS analysis.  Soil and 
sediments were sieved to -80 mesh. Rock and drill core samples are jaw crushed to 70% 
passing 10 mesh, a 250 gm riffle split was then pulverized to 95% passing 150 mesh in a 
mild-steel ring-and-puck mill.  Samples were digested in a modified Aqua Regia solution. 
Samples exceeding the standard threshold level for copper were assayed by ICP or ICP-
MS analysis  .  
 
Additionally Acme used sample prep blanks for controls as well as repeat pulps and also  
-10 mesh reject samples 

16.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

16.1 Core  
The author, accompanied by Greg Dawson P. Geo., of Copper Ridge Explorations Inc 
and Julia Madsen geologist working for Aurum Geological Consultants Inc., visited the 
Joss'alun property September 13, 2004 to inspect drill core from the Imperial Metals 
Corp drilling program completed in 2003. Unfortunately, the lack of either a core splitter 
or core saw on the property at the time of the visit prevented the author from taking check 
samples. 
 
However, visual inspection of the half core of DDH-03-03, showed sufficient visible 
chalcopyrite mineralization in the core to support the reported grade of 12.06% Cu over 
0.30 m high-grade assay result for the increment 103.26-103.56 m. 
 
Core from hole DDH-03-05 was also examined for the section 236.70-33.62 m which 
returned a weighted assay of 1.15% Cu. Again there was sufficient disseminated and 
massive chalcopyrite observed in the core to substantiate the high assay values. 
 
The author has no reason to believe that the data reported on by past operators is not 
substantially accurate.  

16.2 Soil Sampling 
The author did not take any check soil samples deeming that the 2003 grid was now too 
indistinct to follow.  

17.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The author was unable to find any reports or data on the adjoining claims of John 
MacFarland and there are no other relevant claims. 

18.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The Big Nak project is at an early stage of exploration with no significant body of 
mineralization identified to date; no metallurgical testing has been carried out. 



- 24 - 

19.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

There is no mineral resource or reserve estimate for the Big Nak property. 

20.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

To the author's knowledge, there is no other relevant data or information that is not 
reported here which could mislead the reader.  

21.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

21.1 Interpretation 
Results of the soil geochemical survey completed at Joss'alun in 2003 were successful in 
identifying areas of surface copper mineralization. Known showings produce strong 
anomalies with little displacement from the bedrock source other than minor down-slope 
dispersion. The 2003 drill program successfully demonstrated the potential for the 
discovery of a large stockwork or feeder-type copper deposit that would typically be 
expected to occur beneath a massive sulphide deposit. 
 
The Cypress-type VMS deposit model appears to be the most suitable given the current 
information available. Considering the remote location of the property and the grades 
typical of Cypress-type deposits, a minimum target size could be in the five to ten million 
tonne range. 

The actual copper assay results in drill core, as superimposed on sections 100W and 0E – 
Figures 7 and 8 – demonstrate a reasonably close correspondence between sulphide 
content, as represented by percent copper, and weak to moderate chargeability. Given the 
likely total percent of sulphides in the rock, for the most part probably less than 3 to 5 %, 
and the relatively coarse nature of the sulphide disseminations, in stockworks or narrow, 
massive lenses, the weak to moderate chargeability values are in the range that might be 
expected. 

21.2 Conclusion   
When comparing the modeled chargeability from lines 0E and 100W with L200W and 
L300W shown in Figs 7 and 8 there is a strong suggestion that sulphide mineralization 
continues in that direction, as indicated by zones of higher chargeability. This 
mineralization could be either structurally or stratigraphically controlled, or some 
combination of the two. Given the higher chargeability values to the west, the sulphide 
mineralization could be more intense in this direction. 

22.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Based on the conclusions and previous work results, an airborne magnetics-
electromagnetic survey completion is justified over the entire property. This should be 
followed by further IP surveys extending the area surveyed to date.  Contingent on 



- 25 - 

successful results of a Phase I program, a success contingent Phase II consisting of 750 m 
of core diamond drilling should be completed. 

22.1 Phase 1   
Phase I should consist of a helicopter-borne magnetic electromagnetic survey over the 
entire property. The magnetics will be helpful in defining the ultramafic and mafic 
volcanic rock stratigraphy and related structures while the electromagnetic survey should 
detect any near-surface massive sulphide mineralization. Subsequent to interpreting the 
airborne survey data, the IP survey should be expanded. Lines 0E, L100E, and L 100W, 
200W should each be extended for 300 m to the northeast. Other anomalies interpreted 
from the airborne surveys should also be covered. Particularly any anomalies associated 
with the known surface mineralization at Jennusty, Bor, and Box Lake mineralized zones. 
 
In addition, the soil grid should be extended to the east to cover an area of anomalous 
copper and gold in soils outlined by the reconnaissance soil sampling done by Imperial 
Metals. At the same time, the favourable mafic stratigraphy should be prospected and 
mapped to the east and west of the current mapping.  

22.2 Phase 2   
A contingent, four hole, 750 m core drilling program is recommended to test the zones of 
higher chargeability as outlined on L200W and L300W plus additional high chargeability 
zones defined by the Phase I portion of the program recommended in this report. The 
objective of the program would be to identify zones of higher-grade copper 
mineralization, and to determine the structural and stratigraphic controls on that 
mineralization.
