1 Summary 

1.1 Introduction 

The purpose of this technical report is to support the mineral resource estimate released July 31
st
, 2015 in 

accordance with the guidelines of National Instrument 43-101. This report updates and supersedes the 

previous mineral resource estimate (Davis et al., 2014) based on additional data from the Phase IV drill 

program. The mineral resource estimate in this Technical Report represents a substantial change from 

the previous estimate (Davis et al., 2014) which was used as the basis for the updated Preliminary 

Economic Assessment ("PEA") detailed in the Technical Report dated February 13, 2015 (Kuchling et al., 

2015). Hence, that PEA is no longer current and will not be carried forward. 

The mineral resource estimate and associated information in this report was prepared under the direction 

of Robert Sim, P.Geo, SIM Geological Inc. (SGI), Bruce Davis, FAusIMM, BD Resource Consulting, Inc. 

and Bruce Smith, MAusIMM CP(Geo). Based on education, work experience relevant to this style of 

mineralization and deposit type, and membership in a recognized professional organization, both Mr. Sim 

and Mr. Davis are independent Qualified Persons ("QP") and Mr. Smith is a non-independent QP, within 

the requirements of NI 43-101 for the purpose of the report.  

1.2 Project Description 

The Chinchillas Project is located in the Puna region of northwestern Argentina, in the province of Jujuy, 

department of Rinconada, approximately 280 kilometres from the provincial capital of San Salvador de 

Jujuy.   

The Project is composed of three contiguous claims, totaling 2,043 hectares.  Golden Arrow holds a 

100% interest in the claims, with a commitment for a $1.2M payment to the vendors of the Chinchilla and 

Chinchilla I Minas upon the commencement of commercial production. 

Access to the Chinchillas Project is by paved road to the town of Abra Pampa via National Route No. 9 

and then 66 kilometres west across public gravel roads, through the village of Santo Domingo. Santo 

Domingo is equipped with electricity, natural gas, and water services. Abra Pampa has a hospital, and, 

along with San Salvador, provides other supplies necessary for exploration.  

The topography of the Project area is large rounded hills surrounding an elliptical depression, with an 

altitude ranging from 4,000 to 4,200 masl. 

1.3 History 

The Chinchillas Project area was first prospected and mined on a small scale in the eighteenth century by 

Jesuit missionaries and, in the late 1960's, there was a period of small underground production by a local 

company using adits and tunnels. In 1994, Aranlee Resources conducted surface sampling and drilled 

seven reverse circulation drill holes for a total of 780 metres.  Silex Argentina, a subsidiary of Apex Silver, 

acquired the property and began exploration in 2004.  Silex completed 2,220 metres of drilling in seven 

holes.  

In early 2011 Golden Arrow personnel identified the Chinchillas Project as a potential advanced-stage 

acquisition target. The Company completed an option agreement with the underlying landowners in 

August of the same year.   Exploration work commenced in the spring of 2012 following community 

relations meetings and approval of work permits. Golden Arrow has since completed four phases of 

exploration and drilling and published four Technical Reports detailing resource estimates and preliminary 

economic assessments, all of which are filed on SEDAR.

1.4 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

The Chinchillas silver-lead-zinc deposit is located in the Puna geological belt. Stratigraphy in the belt 

includes metamorphosed Proterozoic sediments in the basement, through Paleozoic marine back-arc 

sediments, to more recent volcanic sequences and continental sediments. The Puna is the most 

important terrane in Jujuy Province for mineral deposits, including: mesothermal quartz veins with native 

gold and base metals; polymetallic quartz-sulphide veins with base and precious metals; gold, tin and 

copper placer deposits; SEDEX deposits with lead-zinc-silver and; Bolivian-type tin-silver sulphide veins 

related to intrusive stocks.   

The Chinchillas deposit is located in a dacitic volcanic centre. The deposit formed at a dilational fault jog 

within a regional scale east-west trending fault structure where an explosive volcanic vent has cut through 

marine meta-sedimentary basement rocks.  The resulting topographic depression or diatreme volcanic 

throat is elliptical in shape, approximately two kilometres long by 1.6 kilometres wide, and infilled with 

pyroclastic rocks (breccias and tuffs). At the contact between pyroclastic volcanics and basement 

metasediments, a wide zone of hydraulic fracturing and brecciation of the basement has formed.  Dacite 

dome lavas and subvolcanics intrude on the southern margin of the basin at the contact between 

metasediments and pyroclastics. 

The Chinchillas deposit has significant silver-lead-zinc mineralization in four main areas: the Silver 

Mantos and Mantos Basement zones in the west part of the project, and the Socavon del Diablo and 

Socavon Basement zones in the east part.  

The Silver Mantos zone is situated in the western third of the basin, covering an area of approximately 30 

hectares. Shallow disseminated silver mineralization occurs within clay altered pyroclastic breccias and 

tuffs. This is concentrated in layers or "mantos" that average greater than 20 metres in thickness and are 

generally situated between the surface and 100 metres depth.  A significant new mantos zone has also 

been defined between 170 and 230 metres depth, and it remains open to expansion. 

Located below the Silver Mantos, the Mantos Basement comprises an area 320 metres wide and up to 

120 metres thick, with an average thickness of 80 metres.  It is hosted entirely within the basement pelites 

and sandstones and is comprised predominantly of breccias, crackle breccias with minor small veinlets, 

fracture filling and mineralized structures. Mineralization within the Mantos Basement is open to 

expansion downdip in some areas to the east and south. 

The Socavon del Diablo zone is situated in the eastern third of the basin and defined by drilling over an 

area of approximately five hectares. Mineralization is generally lower in silver content and higher in zinc 

grade, and is dominated by manto-style disseminated sulphides within favorable shallow dipping volcanic 

tuff horizons.   

The Socavon Basement zone is mainly hosted within the Ordovician interbedded pelite and sandstone 

basement, situated to the northeast of the main Socavon zone. Immediately to the east of the dacite 

dome that limits the Socavon, biotitic horizontal tuffs are covering the newly discovered south expansion 

of the Socavon Basement zone. Here, the mineralization is hosted in open space breccias filled with 

argentiferous galena plus a stockworking of sphalerite-siderite-galena which in places carries low grade 

silver-zinc mineralization along widths of over 300 metres. 

1.5 Deposit Types 

The Chinchillas deposit is considered to be part of the Bolivian tin-silver-zinc belt that extends from the 

San Rafael tin-copper deposit in southern Peru into the Puna region of Jujuy.  Deposits with similar 

environments and styles of mineralization include San Cristóbal, Potosí, Pulacayo and Pirquitas. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 3 

 

These deposits are generally characterized by intrusion of dacite dome complexes with mineralization 

hosted in shears and breccias within the dacite domes and / or within shears and breccias within the host 

rocks.  More rarely, as in the case of Chinchillas and San Cristóbal, the deposits also contain 

disseminated flat lying manto bodies within sediments and pyroclastic rocks that are cut by the "feeder" 

shears. All the deposits are known to have large vertical extents. 

1.6 Exploration and Drilling 

Golden Arrow's surface exploration program in 2011 and 2012 included detailed mapping with a special 

emphasis on structures, rock chip sampling, trenching and talus sampling.  These programs identified the 

major structural zones, the strong east-west control on basin formation, and new mineralized target 

areas.   These interpretations defined drill targets for the Phase I and Phase II drill programs.   In 2013 

the Company completed geophysical surveys (IP/Resistivity, CSAMT, Magnetics) and a re-interpretation 

of the 2008 IP as well as collected 453 soil samples and 174 rock chip samples in a surface exploration 

program.    The work resulted in the identification of new structural zones and areas of mineralization 

around the existing deposit, and the identification of a new target area to the south, called Chinchillas 

South.   

Golden Arrow has completed four drilling programs.  The first drilling phase, conducted in May and June 

2012, included 27 drill holes for 3,224 metres of drilling.  The second, conducted between November 

2012 and February 2013, included 49 drill holes and 7,278 metres of drilling.  Between February 24
th
 

2014 and June 17
th
 2014, Golden Arrow completed a Phase III drill program including 38 drill holes and 

8,985 metres.  The most recent drilling was the Phase IV program, conducted between November 2014 

and April 2015, which included 55 drill holes with 11,175 metres length. 

Prior to Golden Arrow's work, Silex Argentina S.A. drilled seven core holes on the property for a total of 

2,220 metres.   Therefore the drill database supplied by Golden Arrow contains 176 core drill holes 

representing a total of 32,881 metres.  

No other type of drilling or surface sampling was used in the resource estimate. 

1.7 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

All drilling was completed by professional drilling companies using standard industry methods.   

The database from Silex lacks results from several certified reference materials (CRMs or standards), but 

re-sampling work conducted by Golden Arrow validates the Silex data and the results have been 

incorporated into the resource database.  

Sample and assay procedures applied by Golden Arrow in the drilling program are consistent with 

generally accepted industry best practices. The statistical analysis of quality control data show good 

accuracy and precision with no significant contamination. It is the opinion of the authors that the data are 

suitable for the estimation of resources. 

1.8 Data Verification 

No material sample bias was identified by the QPs during the review of the drill data and assays. 

Observation of the drill core during the site visits and inspection and validation of the data collected 

convinced the QP's that the drill data are adequate for the estimation of Inferred and Indicated resources. 

1.9 Metallurgy 

A metallurgical test program was initiated in January 2013 and continued in stages, with the most recent 

work completed in July 2014.  The test work is undertaken by Bureau Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd.,

Inspectorate Metallurgical Division, ("Inspectorate") of Richmond, B.C Canada, under the direction of Mr. 

John R. W. Fox, B.Sc., P.Eng. of Laurion Inc., independent consultant to the Company and a Qualified 

Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101.  The most recent testing program included locked-cycle 

testing, providing the most representative view of the overall metallurgical performance of the samples to

The metallurgical test work program will continue as the project progresses, and in the future will include 

samples from the Socavon Basement. For the purposes of this resource estimate the metallurgical 

parameters and recoveries for the Socavon Basement are assumed to be the same as the Mantos 

Basement, based on similarities in geology and mineralization.    

1.10 Resource Estimate 

The mineral resource has been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM Estimation of 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practices Guidelines (November, 2003) and reported 

according to the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, (CIM, 2014) in 

accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators' (CSA) National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") 

(CSA, 2011).  

Estimations were made from 3D block models based on geostatistical applications using commercial 

mine planning software (MineSight® v10.0-2).  The model uses a nominal block size of 10 x 10 x 5 m 

(LxWxH).  

The resource estimate has been generated from drill hole sample assay results and the interpretation of a 

geologic model which relates to the spatial distribution of silver, lead and zinc. Interpolation 

characteristics were defined based on the geology, drill hole spacing, and geostatistical analysis of the 

data.  The resources were classified according to their proximity to sample data locations. 

Table 1-2 summarizes the estimate of Mineral Resources for the Chinchillas Project.  

Mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. The 

estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 5 

 

taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred 

resources are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to classify these Inferred 

resources as Indicated or Measured, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them 

to an Indicated or Measured category. 

Due to the polymetallic nature of the deposit, mineral resources were calculated on a silver-equivalent 

basis (AgEq) using the formula: AgEq = Ag g/t + (Pb% ∗ 36.09) + (Zn% * 36.09). Silver equivalents 

(AgEq) are calculated in model blocks, for use in the floating cone algorithm, using the contributions of 

silver, lead and zinc and include adjustments for metallurgical recoveries. There are no adjustments for 

mining losses or dilution. Since this is a resource limiting pit shell, and the fact that mineral resources 

must show reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, an elevated silver price of $25 per 

ounce was used to generate the pit shell. 

The following technical and economic parameters were used (all prices are in US dollars):  

• Metal prices for Silver Equivalent calculation: silver $19/oz, lead $1/lb, zinc $1/lb 

• Metal price used to generate resource limiting pit shell: silver $25/oz  

• Recoveries: 90% silver equivalent. 

• Mining cost: $2.45/t 

• Process cost: $16/t 

• General and Adminstrative ("G&A"): $8.30/t 

• Pit slope: 45 degrees 

Based on a $19/oz silver price, the base cut-off grade for the resource is estimated to be 45 g/t silver 

equivalent.

Notes to Table 1-2: 

 Totals may not add correctly due to rounding 

 Mineral resources are contained within a pit shell generated using a silver price of $25/oz. 

 Silver equivalent grades, and the base case cut-off grade of 45g/t AgEq, are based on metal prices of 
$19/oz silver and $1/lb for Lead and Zinc.  

 Mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability.  

 The quantity and grade of reported Inferred resources are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient 
exploration to classify these Inferred resources as Indicated or Measured, and it is uncertain if further 
exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured category. 

1.11 Conclusions and Recommendations 

There is a good understanding of the geology and mineralization of the deposit, and the resource model 

is a reasonable reflection of deposit geology.  Exploration activities have been carried out in accordance 

with industry standard best practices and are suitable to support resource estimates. Sampling and 

assaying include appropriate quality assurance and control procedures.  The resource model developed 

for the Chinchillas deposit uses accepted modeling and grade estimation methods.  

The estimated Indicated resource, using a cut-off grade of 45 g/t of equivalent silver, is 25.9 Mt with 

grades of 77.2 g/t silver, 0.66% lead, and 0.66% zinc. A further Inferred resource of 47.1 Mt, with grades 

of 50.2 g/t silver, 0.52% lead, and 0.64% zinc, has been estimated using the same cut-off grade. 

Potential remains to expand the current resource and to define new resources.  This expanded resource 

estimate and recent metallurgical testing warrants updating the economic study for the Chinchillas 

deposit. A further economic evaluation beyond a PEA level study, such as a Feasibility Study ("FS") or 

Pre-Feasibility Study ("PFS"), will require upgrading of the resource categories.  Additional metallurgical 

testing will be required to confirm the optimum processing for all mineralization types. 

 A further 10,000 metres of infill drilling is recommended to upgrade resources from the Inferred to 

Indicated categories. In addition, in preparation for a Feasibility Study, the authors recommend 5,000 

metres of condemnation, metallurgical, geotechnical and hydrogeological drilling and additional detailed 

metallurgical testing.  The estimated budget for these items including the infill drill program is $4.8M.  

Golden Arrow should also continue its social and environmental programs and initiate the mine permitting 

process.

2 Introduction 

2.1 Introduction and Terms of Reference 

Golden Arrow Resources Corporation ("Golden Arrow") is a Vancouver-based exploration company that 

trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol GRG.  The Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 

("Chinchillas" or "the Project") in Jujuy Province, Argentina, is the flagship project for the Company.   

Golden Arrow is a member of the Grosso Group: a management company specialized in resource 

exploration in Argentina since 1993. 

Golden Arrow commissioned independent consultants Bruce Davis, Ph.D., F.AusIMM of BD Resource 

Consulting Inc. and Robert Sim, P.Geo., of SIM Geological Inc., and non-independent consultant Bruce 

Smith, MSc, Chartered Professional Geologist, MAusIMM, to provide an updated mineral resource 

estimate for the Chinchillas Project.  Dr. Davis, Mr. Sim and Mr. Smith are qualified persons within the 

meaning of Canadian Securities Administrator's National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for 

Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101") and Form 43-101F. The scope of work consisted of auditing the database, 

including aspects of data quality, review of the geologic model, development of a block model, and 

determination of reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction of the mineral resources in the 

Project, in accordance to the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, 

(CIM, 2014). Dr. Davis conducted geostatistical analysis of the drill data and directed and validated the 

grade estimation in the block model. Mr. Sim constructed the resource model, and Mr. Smith provided the 

geological interpretation.  

The purpose of this technical report is to support the mineral resource estimate released July 31

4 Property Description and Location 

4.1 Location 

The Chinchillas Project is located in the Puna region of northwestern Argentina, in the province of Jujuy, 

department of Rinconada, approximately 280 kilometres from the provincial capital of San Salvador de 

Jujuy.  The property is centred at approximately at 3,473,150E and 7,512,360N (Gauss Kruger, 

Argentina, Posgar Zone 3; 22⁰30′13″ S, 66°15′39″ W) at elevations ranging from 4,000 to 4,200 masl. 

 

Figure 4-1: Location of the Chinchillas Project and Other Projects and Mines in the District.  

The Chinchillas Project is located within the Bolivian tin-silver-lead-zinc belt (Figure 4-1) which extends 

into northern Argentina. Similar projects in the district include Silver Standard Resources Inc.'s Mina 

Pirquitas, located approximately 30 kilometres southwest of Chinchillas, and Sumitomo's San Cristobal 

Mine in Bolivia.  

4.2 Land Tenure 

4.2.1 Exploitation Concessions 

Exploitation concessions in Argentina are called "Minas". Minas are defined by the following categories: 

First Category Minas include substances such as gold, silver, platinum, iron, lead, copper, zinc, 

aluminium, lithium, potassium, etc. and Second Category Minas comprise substances such as precious 

stones in river beds, any metal not included in the first category and others.  



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 11 

 

The Mina is comprised of one or more "pertenencias" which are units of mining properties. Pertenencias 

must be rectangular in shape. In disseminated deposits such as Chinchillas, the pertenencias can 

encompass up to 100 hectares. The mining property fee or "canon" for a Mina is ARS$3,200 per 

pertenencia per year.   

Individuals are entitled to explore for, exploit and dispose of Minas as owners by means of a legal licence 

or legal concession granted by the competent authority under the provisions of the Argentine Mining 

Code. The legal concessions granted for the exploitation of Minas are valid for an undetermined period of 

time, and are considered "real property" giving the concessionaire the right to recover metals from the 

subsurface vertically underneath the concession, provided that the title holder complies with the 

obligations set out in the Argentine Mining Code. 

The Chinchillas Project consists of three contiguous First Category Minas that cover an area of 

approximately 2,042.56 hectares (See Figure 4-2): 

Table 4-1:  Chinchillas Exploitation Concessions 

Concession File No Area (hectares) 

Chinchilla 469-M-56 329 

Chinchilla I 079-D-96 830.98 

Chinchilla II 1943-V-2013 882.58 

 

The Chinchilla Mina is broken down into four pertenencias, while the Chinchilla I Mina has 9 pertenencias 

and Chinchilla II has 9 pertenencias.  All Minas are valid and in good standing.   

4.2.2 Option Agreement 

As of July 2015, the Company, through its wholly-owned Argentine subsidiary, Valle del Cura S.A., 

("VDC") has completed option payments to earn a 100% interest in the Chinchilla and Chinchilla I 

properties, to a total of US$1,866,000 paid. 

The Company must make an additional payment of US$1,200,000 to the vendors upon the 

commencement of commercial production on these two properties. 

The Chinchilla II Mina was acquired directly by VDC and is not subject to option payments.

4.2.3 Surface Rights 

Golden Arrow has agreements with the surface owners in the area of the Minas and will renew such 

agreements as necessary on an ongoing basis, or look to purchase them outright.   

4.3 Permitting 

Government permits required to conduct exploration and drilling on the Chinchillas Project have been 

obtained. (For additional details please refer to section 20.1.1.)

4.4 Environmental liabilities 

Prior to initiating work on the Chinchilla Mina, an inspection was performed by the mining and 

environmental authorities regarding potential pre-existing environmental liabilities. There are remnants of 

historic mining activities in the Project area, such as small buildings, small areas of workings excavated in 

the 1960`s, historic drilling platforms, trenches and holes. All of these liabilities were declared as pre-

existing in the Company`s Environmental Impact Assessment report ("EIA") for the Chinchilla Mina, there 

were no findings and/or requests by the environmental authorities, and the Chinchilla EIA report was 

approved.   

4.5 Factors and risks 

To the extent known, there are no additional factors or risks that may affect the access, title, right or 

ability to perform work on the Chinchillas Project.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 

The Chinchillas Project is accessed primarily by National Route No. 9 from the provincial capital of San 

Salvador de Jujuy, northwards along the Humahuaca River to the town of Abra Pampa. The route 

continues along Provincial Route No. 7 westward for 66 kilometres, through the village of Santo Domingo. 

The roads are maintained by the Province and are accessible year round. Several temporary rivers cross 

the route so four wheel drive vehicles are recommended in the rainy season. 

A second route to the Project is more appropriate for heavy transport vehicles, and is used by traffic to 

the Pirquitas mine situated 30 kilometres to the southwest of Chinchillas. This route follows National 

Route No. 9 northwards from San Salvador de Jujuy to Purmamarca, then turns northwest on paved road 

No. 52 to the town of Susques. From there, National Route No. 40 heads to Provincial Route No. 70 that 

leads to the Project at the Fundiciones mountain pass (Figure 5-1). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure 5-1: Location Map with Access Routes to the Project Area. 

5.1 Physiography, Climate and Vegetation 
 

The Chinchillas Project area has an elliptical, caldera-like shape with steep rolling hills surrounding the 

caldera depression. It is located near the Fundiciones mountain pass, with the Rinconada and Carahuasi 

ranges extending from north to south. Elevations range from about 4,000 to 4,200 masl. The highest 

elevation in the area is Cerro Granada (5,696 masl) 28 kilometres to the southwest. 

The climate is arid to semi-arid, tropical-subtropical influenced by high desert (Blasco, 2011). Rain is 

scarce and mainly occurs during the rainy season (November – March), with a mean precipitation of 300 

millimetres per annum. The annual mean temperature is 18°C, however during the winter it ranges from 

-7.7 ºC to 7.5 ºC. Dry and windy conditions often prevail in the area. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 15 

 

The Uquillayoc river runs through the Project area, and is fed by many tributaries. Water volume in the 

Uquillayoc is sufficient to be the main source of water for the village of Santo Domingo (Blasco, 2011). 

Vegetation  is  patchy  to  sparse  and  consists  of  xerophilous  and  steppe  bushes  like  iro  (Festuca 

ortophylia), and coirón (Stipachrysophylla). Acantoliphia haustata is the predominant species with the 

Yareta (Azorella compacta), less frequent. The tola (Parastrepia ssp) and small trees like the queñoa 

(Polylepis tomentella) can be found in depressions (Blasco, 2011). 

Animal species found in the area include mammals such as llamas, puna foxes and vizcachas, as well as 

several mice species, chinchillas and ferrets. Other fauna in the area include lizards, and birds such as 

small rheas, owls, ducks, condors and falcons (Blasco, 2011). 

5.2 Local resources and infrastructure 

Chinchillas is located in the rural zone of Rinconada department. Rinconada has an approximate 

population of 2,500 people. It covers an area of 6,407 square kilometres and has basic public services 

including a police department and health center. The main communities in the department are: Pan de 

Azúcar, Nuevo Pirquitas, Antiguyo, Carahuasi, Casa Colorada, Casti, Ciénaga Grande, Cincel, Rosario 

de Coyaguayma, Esquina Blanca, Laguna Larga, Lagunillas de Pozuelos, Lagunita, Loma Blanca, 

Orosmayo, Liviara, Tiomayo, Ojo de Agua, Pozuelos, Ramadas, Santo Domingo, Uquillayoc and 

Vizcachayoc (Blasco, 2011). 

Golden Arrow's exploration camp is located in the village of Santo Domingo, at an elevation of 4,000 

masl. Santo Domingo is a small community with a school, church, bus transportation, electricity, natural 

gas and water services. Most people in the village are ranchers (sheep and llamas) while others work in 

larger towns like Abra Pampa or Rinconada.  During exploration work periods supplies are obtained from 

Abra Pampa and San Salvador de Jujuy. 

Golden Arrow has invested in building enhancements, and has installed two gas tanks to supply natural 

gas in the village. Health care services are available in Orosmayo or Rinconada, both 30 kilometers 

away. The nearest hospital is located in Abra Pampa, 66 kilometres away. 

Field infrastructure at the Project includes two office containers, a core logging facility, a core cutting 

machine, three storage tents, two cisterns for diesel fuel (7,000 and 10,000 litres) and four warehouses of 

144 square metres each, for the storage of the core boxes, including a bathroom for personnel.  

Electricity is provided by a 46kva diesel generator. Water supply for domestic and human consumption 

comes from public service and mineral water purchases.

6 History 

Chinchillas was first prospected and mined in small scale in the eighteenth century by Jesuit 

missionaries.  Relicts of ancient furnaces used to melt lead and silver can still be found at the Project 

area (Kulemeyer, 2011). In 1956 Mr. Antonio Mercado requested a concession based on the discovery of 

galena veins in the basement rock. In 1968, the mine was sold to Ing. Pichetti who later formed the 

Sociedad Pirquihuasi Company together with the Pirquitas Company, and some adits and tunnels were 

opened for small scale production. In 1982 the mine license expired and the mine was acquired by Shell 

CAPSA S.A. From December 1982 to 1989 consulting geologist for Shell, Jorge Daroca, carried out some 

exploration work and after Shell dropped the property, Mr. Daroca requested it for himself, convinced of 

the good potential of the area (Daroca, undated). Roads, remnants of infrastructure, and minor 

underground workings remain from this activity but no records of this work are available. 

In 1994, Aranlee Resources conducted surface sampling and drilled seven reverse circulation drill holes 

for a total of 780 metres. Assay results from this work are available, but there are no samples for re-

analysis or quality control information, therefore the data have not been incorporated into the resource 

estimate. Locations of drill holes are shown in Figure 10-1. 

In 2004 Silex Argentina, a subsidiary of Apex Silver, conducted preliminary reconnaissance work 

including trenching, pitting and surface sampling, with a total of 165 samples taken.  Between October 

2007  and  July  2008,  40  manual  pits  and  nine  trenches  were  sampled.  Surface mapping was also 

completed at different scales across the Chinchillas property. A total of 1,036 surface samples were 

collected by Silex before drilling 2,220 metres in seven diamond drill holes (Figure 10-1). Drill hole 

samples were taken at one or two metre intervals. Drill hole locations and a summary of intercepts are 

available in Appendix I. Silex had planned to drill 22 holes but cut the program short during the 2008-2009 

financial crisis. In early 2009 Apex entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and with a payment due on 

the property, opted to drop Chinchillas in favor of its more advanced El Quevar project. The core from the 

Silex drill program remains at Chinchillas (Silex, 2008 and Caranza and Carlson, 2012). 

At the beginning of 2008, Quantec Geoscience Argentina S.A. ("Quantec") performed a 16 kilometre IP 

resistivity survey, comprising nine sections. The pole-dipole interval was 50 metres with 300 metres depth 

readings (Figure 6-1). The objective of the program was to detect and delineate sulphides related to an 

intermediate to high-sulphidation epithermal system. The data were presented as pseudo-sections and 

2D inversions of apparent resistivity and chargeability, with 2D level plan maps from 3,900m to 4,250m 

(Quantec, 2008). The mineralized zones at Chinchillas do not appear to be related to chargeability, and to 

date the IP data have been of limited use. However there is a strong resistivity contrast between volcanic 

units and basement schists and resistivity data have been an effective tool for imaging the volcanic 

diatreme shape (Figure 6-2).

In early 2011 Golden Arrow personnel identified the Chinchillas Project as a potential advanced-stage 

acquisition target. Following a property tour and a review of existing data, the Company completed an 

option  agreement  with  the  underlying  land  owners  in  August  of  the  same  year. Golden Arrow 

subsequently initiated community relations meetings with the local communities at Santo Domingo, 

Livaria, and Rinconada as well as with the individual land owners, and submitted a new environmental 

impact statement for exploration drilling. The Government of Jujuy convened meetings of the Provincial 

Environmental Management Unit ("La Unidad de Gestión Ambiental Provincial" or "UGAMP") to approve 

the environmental impact statement and work plans (see Chapter 20 for additional information). At the 

UGAMP meeting, all environmental, community, political and mining representatives agreed to Golden 

Arrow's exploration plan. The plan was approved in March 2012 for a period of two years and exploration 

work commenced. Golden Arrow has since completed four phases of exploration and drilling (see 

Chapters 9 and 10 for details) and published four Technical Reports detailing resource estimates and 

preliminary economic assessments, all of which are filed on SEDAR.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

7.1 Regional Geology 
 

The Chinchillas silver-lead-zinc deposit is located in the north-northeast to south-southwest trending Puna 

geological belt in the western half of Jujuy province (Figure 7.1). 

 

Figure 7-1: Jujuy Regional Geology Map with Geologic Terranes by Age, and Location of the 

Chinchillas Project. 

The elevation of the Puna ranges from 3,900 to 6,700 masl. Basement rocks include Proterozoic 

sediments exhibiting medium to low grade metamorphism. A series of units unconformably overly the 

basement rocks, including Paleozoic (Acoite Formation) marine sediments deposited in an early to middle 

Ordivician back arc basin that are overlain by Silurian to Devonian sediments (Board et al., 2011). The 

Puna was subjected to compressive events in the Late Ordovician to Early Devonian and Paleogene. 

However, by the late Miocene a basin and range geomorphology had developed and this resulted in the 

development of andesitic to dacitic stratovolcanoes and large caldera structures with associated 

extensive ignimbrites. (Soler et al., 2007; Board et al., 2011). This volcanic activity, and its associated 

mineral deposits, was concentrated along certain corridors defined by lineaments such as Coranzuli-

Lipez, El Toro-Olacapato and Arizaro (See Figure 7-2) (Ramos, 1999, Coira et al., 2004, Gorustovich et 

al., 2011).  

In recent times, geological activity in the Puna belt has included basaltic volcanism, continental 

sedimentation and the creation of salt flats, or salars. The Puna is the most important terrane in Jujuy

Province for mineral deposits, including: lithium and borate salar deposits; mesothermal quartz veins with 

native gold and base metals; polymetallic quartz-sulphide veins with base and precious metals; gold, tin 

and copper placer deposits; SEDEX deposits with lead-zinc-silver; and, Bolivian-type tin-silver-lead-zinc 

sulphide vein deposits related to intrusive stocks. (Board et al., 2011)

7.2 District Geology 

The Chinchillas deposit is located in the southern part of the Rinconada Range (Figure 7-3). The range 

has a regional north-northeast to south-southwest trend and is delimited by thrust faults to the west and 

east. Various Miocene age volcanic dome complexes with associated hydrothermal alteration exist in the 

area, including Cerro Redondo, Pan de Azucar, Rachaite, and the Chinchillas dome complex. High angle 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project

faulting and folding also characterize the area. Chinchillas is located within a structural window at the 

intersection of northwest fracturing associated with the Lipez-Coranzuli regional lineament and east-west 

controlling structure and lesser northeast trending structures. 

The Chinchillas deposit is hosted by the Ordovician Acoite Formation, described by Board et.al., (2011), 

as a strongly folded package of low-grade metamorphosed marine sandstone, siltstone and minor shale 

beds. Deformation and folding of these sediments occurred during the Ocloyic Phase (Coira et al., 2004) 

of late the Ordovician and they are overlain by Cretaceous marine clastic sediments through a major 

unconformity. These sediments are then overlain by Oligocene to middle Miocene volcanic, continental 

sedimentary and volcaniclastic lithologies.

Deposit.  (Main structures and trends are also shown.) (Modified from Caffe 2002)

7.3 Property Geology 
 

The Chinchillas deposit is located in a dacitic volcanic centre with an age of 13±1 Ma (Caffe and Coira, 

2008) as product of a phreatomagmatic diatreme. The deposit was controlled by a dilational fault within a 

regional scale east-west trending fault structure. At the dilation zone an explosive volcanic vent has cut 

through marine meta-sedimentary Ordovician basement rocks.  The resulting topographic depression or 

diatreme volcanic throat is elliptical in shape, approximately two kilometres long by 1.6 kilometres wide, 

and infilled with pyroclastic rocks (breccias and tuffs). At the contact between pyroclastic volcanics and 

basement metasediments a wide zone of hydraulic fracturing and brecciation of the basement has 

formed.  Dacite dome lavas and subvolcanics intrude on the southern margin of the basin at the contact 

between metasediments and pyroclastics (Figures 7-4 and 7-5).

basement rocks, the volcaniclastic sequence infilling the depression, and the dacite domes flanking the 

southern border of the deposit.)

Projected to Surface. 

7.3.1 Marine Sedimentary Basement Sequence 
 

The Chinchillas basin basement lithology (Figures 7-6 and 7-7) is composed of a succession of 

interbedded layers of fine-grained marine sandstones and pelites with minor layers of carbonaceous 

shale. The formation has a low grade of metamorphism and is faulted with local folding. This sedimentary 

sequence corresponds to the Acoite Formation, of Ordovician age. The Miocene phreatomagmatic 

explosion produced an intense fracturing and brecciation of the basement that now is in contact with the 

tuffs and breccias that filled the caldera. The fractured and brecciated basement has a thickness of up to 

150 metres and is the main host of basement mineralization.  

The same basement sequence is found in the Chinchillas South area, up to 1.5 kilometres south of the 

Socavon and Silver Mantos areas, and also hosts mineralization (Figure 7-5).

7.3.2 Pyroclastic  Breccias and Tuffs 

The pyroclastic breccias and tuffs erupted from the volcanic centre and filled in the resulting depression, 

contouring the vent walls. This most likely occurred via airfall deposition and flows of ignimbrites as there 

is no observed evidence of water-lain deposits or sediments. The pyroclastic breccias and tuffs are 

generally similar in composition and vary mainly in clast size and the ratio of matrix of volcanic, basement 

and dacite clasts. Contacts between flows are subtle with often just a change in clast size as evidence. 

The pyroclastics mantle the topography, infilling the basin and dipping moderately towards the centre. 

Contacts between the underlying basement sediments and breccias are sharp. The breccias and tuffs are 

mainly matrix-supported but sometimes clast-supported. The clasts are sub-rounded to angular and vary 

from fine grained to large metre-scale blocks. The clast compositions are predominantly re-worked 

pyroclastic tuffs, lava fragments, and intrusive fragments of dacitic composition, with lithoclasts of 

sedimentary basement pelite or sandstone. Most of the volcanic clasts and matrix are altered by intense 

hydrothermal activity, whereas the sedimentary basement clasts are generally better preserved (Figure 

7-8). 

 

Figure 7-8: Typical Chinchillas Medium Grained Pyroclastic Breccia with Dacitic Volcanic Clasts 

Dominant and Secondary Dark Grey Clasts of Basement Sandstone and Pelite. 

In some surface outcrops and drill holes, particularly at Socavon del Diablo, a characteristic coarse 

grained clast-supported breccia is observed (Figure 7-9). Clast type and composition is similar to the rest 

of the pyroclastics within the basin, with dacitic volcanic fragments and lesser pelite and sandstone clasts. 

Clasts range from two to 40 centimetres in diameter. Within the matrix and between clasts there are often 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 26 

 

voids, large vugs and sulphide mineralization cementing the breccia. Previous companies focused on 

these breccias and they have often been interpreted as hydrothermal explosion breccias (i.e. Caffe and 

Coira, 2008). These coarse clast-supported breccias are volumetrically minor within the project areas. An 

alternative interpretation is that these breccias are not of hydrothermal origin, rather just a coarse-grained 

pyroclastic breccia, possibly originating near vents within the basin. 

Some drill holes intercepted dykes of tuff-like clastic volcanics at depth intruding into the brecciated 

basement rocks. These feeders conduits range from centimetres to several metres (Figure 7-10).  In other 

cases, blocks of basement rocks of up to 20 metres within the pile of the pyroclastic tuffs and breccias are 

interpreted as collapses of the host rock inside the diatreme during its formation ("roof pendant").  

In the Chinchillas South area (Figure 7-11), recent drilling confirmed the presence of argillic altered tuffs 

and breccias sub-outcropping or covered by recent sediments. These tuffs, located outside the main 

basin of Chinchillas, may be related to an additional volcanic center or a ring tuff surrounding the volcanic 

center.

7.3.3 Dacite Domes 
 

Three main dacite domes outcrop along the southeast edge of the Chinchillas basin between the 

pyroclastic breccias and basement contact. The domes have a medium to fine grained porphyrytic texture 

with phenocrysts of quartz, (35 to 45 percent) plagioclase, biotite and minor sanidine (Caffe and Coira, 

2008). The dacite domes are generally massive in texture with limited flow banding and some flow 

brecciation along the margins. Drilling confirms that the dacite outcrops are part of larger bodies located 

below the Socavon del Diablo area. At surface they lie horizontally above tuff breccias (Figure 7-12). 

 

Figure 7-12: Showing Contact Between Dacite Flow Overlaying the Tuff Breccias.  

7.4 Alteration 

Typical hydrothermal alteration is described below separately for basement sedimentary sequences and 

pyroclastic volcanics and dacites. 

7.4.1 Alteration in the Marine Sedimentary Basement 

In the basement sedimentary sequence, mineralization is restricted to breccias, fracture filling, and 

veinlets with different frequency or intensity. Alteration of the host pelite or sandstone in general is very 

weak, with carbonate, clay and chlorite alterations close to sheared structures, with abundant siderite 

filling fractures and minor oxides of iron and manganese observed on fractures. Disseminated crystalline 

pyrite is abundant and is syngenetic with the sediments. To date there has been no detailed petrographic 

studies completed on the basement and there may be micro-crystalline pervasive alteration that is not 

easily visible in hand specimen. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 29 

 

7.4.2 Alteration in Pyroclastic Tuffs and Breccias 

The pyroclastic tuffs and breccias have undergone several different types of alteration, including:  clay 

alteration, sericitization, silicification, and carbonate alteration mainly as siderite. The most extensive 

alteration is the clay alteration with feldspars, silica and pumiceous fragments altered to different 

assemblages including quartz-adularia-sericite, illite-quartz-sulphides or siderite-sphalerite-pyrite. Biotites 

are commonly altered to sericite-kaolonite-quartz assemblages (Caffe, 2013). There is also extensive fine 

grained silicification within the suite of rocks. The clay alteration, sericitization and silicification are 

somewhat contemporaneous as they are observed to overprint each other, indicating that the alteration of 

these rocks was a prolonged and variable event, probably over a range of temperatures and depths. 

Carbonate alteration is locally pervasive and appears late in most thin sections studied (Marshall and 

Mustard, 2012). Plagioclasts are commonly replaced by siderite and illite (Caffe, 2013).  

7.4.3 Alteration in the Dacitic Domes 

The porphyritic dacites were hydrothermally altered to sericite and siderite with minor silicification. 

Alteration is more developed in the matrix and in the plagioclasts (Caffe, 2013). 

7.5 Mineralization 

Mineralization at Chinchillas is dominated by silver with lesser amounts of lead and zinc. Mineralization 

occurs as disseminated sulphides and matrix infilling within the volcanic tuffs and as matrix and fracture 

filling in breccias within the basement meta-sediments. There are rarely mineralized shears, veinlets or 

vein-like structures within the dacites and volcanics. Within the basement lithologies shears and 

structures are more commonly mineralized. Depth of oxidation is just a few metres within the volcanics 

and is insignificant within the basement rocks. Silver, lead and zinc bearing minerals include silver 

sulfosalts, freibergite, boulangerite, tetrahedrite, schalenblende, sphalerite (zinc and iron), and galena 

(including argentiferous examples). Associated mineral assemblages include chalcopyrite, quartz, pyrite, 

siderite, limonites, manganese oxides, cerusite, smithsonite, anglesite and malachite (Marshall and 

Mustard, 2012 and Coira et al., 1993). 

7.5.1 Main Mineralized Zones 

The resource model for the Chinchillas deposit, as defined to date, includes significant silver-lead-zinc 

mineralization in four main areas: the Silver Mantos and Mantos Basement zones in the west part of the 

project, and the Socavon del Diablo and Socavon Basement zones in the east part (Figure 7-13). The 

main structural elements controlling the location of mineralization are: the inverted cone shape of the 

volcanic diatreme forming the contact between basement sediments and overlying volcanic rocks; and 

the dominant east-west and subordinate north-west, north and north-northeast trending structures that 

control formation of the Chinchillas volcanic centre (Figure 7-5). The phreatomagmatic explosion that 

produced the diatreme generated a symmetrical cylindrical shaped caldera, with mineralized brecciated 

basement rocks along the contacts and horizontal layers in the tuffs with disseminated mineralization 

(Figure 7-13).

Figure 7-13: Typical West to East Cross Section of Chinchillas Showing Relations Between 

Mineralized Zones and Dacite 

7.5.1.1 Silver Mantos  

Located in the upper part of the western area of the deposit, the Silver Mantos zone comprises an area of 

approximately 30 hectares (700 metres by 450 metres) and is currently defined by 71 drill holes, with drill 

hole spacing between 30 and 100 metres (Figure 7-14).  Phase IV drilling expanded the resource area to 

the north across the creek and to the south-east defining a new manto body at lower depths.  

Mineralization is disseminated in several shallow (± 5⁰) dipping layers hosted within clay altered 

pyroclastic tuffs and breccias (Figure 7-15). The mineralization occurs between surface and 100 metres 

depth in mantos that range between two and 60 metres thick, averaging greater than 20 metres in 

thickness. These layers are open for expansion to the east. Phase IV drilling defined an additional layer at 

170 to 230 metres deep, referred to as "Deep Manto". The Deep Manto was defined by 12 drill holes in 

the south-east part of the Silver Mantos and remains open for expansion (Figure 7-16). 

Good continuity of the mantos mineralized layers is noted from hole to hole. Petrographic studies on 

samples from the Chinchillas Project area indicate that silver occurs mostly in silver sulphosalts, such as 

freibergite, boulangerite and tetrahedrite, which occur as black fine-grained and disseminated crystals 

with galena and sphalerite in the volcanic tuffs (Marshall and Mustard, 2012 and Ma and Redfearn, 2014). 

Sulphide mineralization is also occasionally noted as matrix infill of breccia structures and open spaces in 

coarser tuffs.  

The geometry of the Silver Mantos (near surface and shallow dip towards the center of the basin) is 

thought to be controlled by the paleo-water table, where mineralizing fluids or gases have percolated up 

through the volcanic pile, and/or along the basement contact, and precipitated upon contact with surface 

waters whose geometry would have reflected the basin topography. In the Silver Mantos area it is thought 

that several main structures control the development of the Chinchillas volcanic centre and mineralization. 

The dominant east-west fault and subordinate north and north-northeast faults all intersect at depth and 

may be the conduits or primary feeder system for mineralization at Silver Mantos.

7.5.1.2 Mantos Basement 

Located below the Silver Mantos, the Mantos Basement comprises an area 320 metres wide and up to 

120 metres thick, with an average thickness of 80 metres, dipping from surface at approximately 40 

degrees to the north (Figure 7-14). The zone has been traced down dip approximately 350 metres. The 

Mantos Basement is hosted entirely within the basement pelites and sandstones and is comprised 

predominantly of breccias, crackle breccias with minor small veinlets, fracture filling and mineralized 

structures (Figure 7-17).  The Mantos Basement is currently defined by 35 drill holes, with drill hole 

spacing ranging from 50 to 70 metres. 

The mineralized breccias within the Mantos Basement are aligned along the contact between the 

basement meta-sediments and the overlying pyroclastic breccias. The control on mineralization is thought 

to be a result of two complementary structural features. 

During the violent eruption and development of the volcanic center the basement rocks on the margins of 

the volcanic diatreme underwent a process of intense fracturing and brecciation.  This created space for 

mineralizing fluids to deposit silver-lead-zinc sulphides as infill and breccia cement during, and post, 

volcanism. 

The location of the Chinchillas volcanic center is coincident with major east–west and subordinate north- 

south and north-northeast secondary structures and it is likely that the development of the volcanism and 

emplacement of the dacite intrusion were controlled by these structures. These structures are thought to 

be "feeders" or mineralizing conduits. 

Mineralization within the Mantos Basement is open to expansion downdip in some areas to the east and 

to the south.

7.5.1.3 Socavon del Diablo 

The Socavon del Diablo zone ("Socavon") is located in the eastern area of the deposit (Figure 7-18), 

where 21 drill holes have defined a mineralized area of approximately five hectares (300 metres by 180 

metres). Drill hole spacing ranges from 30 to 70 metres. Mineralization is dominated by manto-style 

disseminated sulphides within favorable shallow dipping volcanic tuff horizons.  

 

Figure 7-18: Socavon del Diablo and Socavon Basement Zones with Drill Hole Locations and 

Mineralized Zones Projected to Surface. 

Mineral occurrences, textures, alteration and ore types within the volcaniclastic lithologies are similar to 

those described for the Silver Mantos target (Section 7.5.1.1), but the mineralization is thought to be 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 35 

 

related to a different fluid event. There may have been a different vent source within the volcanic centre 

as the Socavon del Diablo mineralization is generally lower in silver and higher in zinc content. 

The mineralization at Socavon is apparently controlled by the intersection of the major basin-forming 

east-west fault and cross-cutting north trending subordinate structure. At this junction old workings, 

including a tunnel and surface cut, exposed a small face of coarse, vuggy breccia with clasts up to a half 

metre in diameter cemented by silver-lead-zinc mineralized sulphides (Figure 7-9). This was typically 

interpreted by previous explorers as a hydrothermal breccia. Drilling has confirmed this breccia to be 

volumetrically small and it forms only a minor part of the Socavon mineralized area. The majority of the 

mineralization occurs as disseminated sulphides within pyroclastic tuffs similar to the Silver Mantos. The 

shape of the greater mineralization at Socavon is an inverted cone structure which is probably controlled 

by intersecting faults allowing upward percolating fluids to contact the surface water table.  

There is limited potential to expand the Socavon zone to the north and east.  

7.5.1.4 Socavon Basement 

The Socavon Basement zone is mainly hosted within the Ordovician interbedded pelite and sandstone 

basement. This zone was originally defined by nine drill holes (CGA-28, -29, -71, -85, 98, 13, 75, 107 and 

115) situated northeast of the main Socavon zone (Figure 7-18). Drilling during Phase IV expanded this 

zone at deeper levels to the south and to the west. The Socavon del Diablo zone is limited to the east by 

a dacitic dome structure that at depth intruded in the tuff units but at surface flowed over the tuffs (Figure 

7-12). Immediately to the east of this dacite dome, biotitic horizontal tuffs of up to 80 metres deep are 

covering the newly discovered south expansion of the Socavon Basement zone. Here, the mineralization 

is hosted in open spaces breccias filled with argentiferous galena plus a stockworking of sphalerite-

siderite-galena with a total thickness of up to 320 metres. The breccias have some high grade Ag-Pb 

zones which were intercepted in five holes (CGA160, CGA-166, CGA-170, CGA-179 and CGA-181) with 

widths between two and six metres (Table 7-1). Additional drilling is necessary to define the shape of 

these breccias. The stockworking carries low grade silver-zinc mineralization along considerable widths, 

such as 319 metres averaging 21 g/t silver and 0.6 % zinc as intersected in CGA-181.

The Socavon Basement zone was also expanded to the north-west (Figure 7-18) where mineralization 

was encountered at the contact between the basement rocks and upper volcanic tuffs. Additionally, this 

zone includes limited breccia and veinlet hosted mineralization within dacite sub-volcanics (Figure 7-19).

7.5.2 Chinchillas South Area 

The Chinchillas South area is located immediately south of the outcropping dacite domes in an area of 

1.2 by 1.2 kilometres (Figure 7-5). Magnetic, IP/Resistivity and CSMAT geophysical surveys carried out 

during 2013, plus detailed geological mapping, defined a series of targets that were tested with nine core 

holes in the Phase III drill program. This drilling encountered wide zones of low grade silver-zinc-lead 

mineralization. The current resource estimate does not include any of the drilling in Chinchillas South 

area. Mineralization is open in all directions and additional drilling is required. This area represents an 

important target for future exploration.  

7.5.2.1 Mn Breccia Target 

Within the Chinchillas South area, the "Mn Breccia" target (Figure 7-20) was tested with three holes. It is a 

breccia outcropping over an area 600 by 300 metres with a distinct triangular shape. The clasts in the 

breccia are fragments of pelites and sandstones from the basement with manganese-iron oxides filling 

open spaces and coating the clasts. The limited drilling on this target intersected mineralization over a 

wide zone, including 84 metres averaging 26 g/t silver and 0.7% zinc in hole CGA-124,  and 15 metres 

averaging 181 g/t silver and 1.1% lead in hole CGA-113.    

7.5.2.2 Pascua Target 

The Pascua target (Figure 7-20) is located 1.2 kilometres south of Socavon del Diablo and was 

delineated based on large geophysical anomalies with no detectable surface expression. In each of four 

holes in this area low grade mineralization was encountered throughout the brecciated basement rocks, 

including prolific microveinlets of sphalerite, galena and siderite in each hole. These basement rocks are 

partially covered by pyroclastic tuff breccias. Outcrops of basement rocks on the south edge of this target 

show silver-lead-zinc mineralization in the form of sub-parallel veinlets in a similar situation to the 

outcrops south of the Mantos Basement.

7.5.3 Resource Expansion and Other Target Areas 

Mineralization at Chinchillas in the Silver Mantos, Mantos Basement, Socavon Basement and Socavon 

del Diablo are still open to expansion, particularly the deeper zones of Silver Mantos and Socovon 

Basement. The Chinchillas South area provides further potential to add significant resources to the 

project. Other targets with only a few drill holes provide significant scope for increasing the size of the 

resource, including: the northern slope of the basin; the area between the Silver Mantos and Socavon 

zones; and the dacite domes. Figure 7-21 below summarizes the main areas and targets for future 

drilling.

The rest of the area within the concessions remains untested, however it has the potential of being 

mineralized and could include additional future targets.

8 Deposit Types 

The Chinchillas deposit is considered to be part of the Bolivian tin-silver-zinc belt which occupies the 

back-arc portion of the central Andes and extends from the San Rafael tin-copper deposit in southern 

Peru to northern Argentina (Figure 8-1). The Bolivian tin-silver deposits are associated typically with felsic 

volcanic domes of broadly rhyodacitic composition (Cunningham et al., 1991). The Chinchillas deposit is 

modeled as a Tertiary aged diatreme volcanic center that has intruded the Paleozoic basement low grade 

metamorphic sediments. The resulting depression, filled with volcanic breccias and tuffs is approximately 

1.5 kilometres in diameter. Mineralization occurs within the basin, hosted in favorable volcanic tuff units, 

on the margins of the basin within footwall sediments and across the sediments-volcanic contacts as on 

structural zones. The mineralization occurs mostly as disseminations, veinlets and matrix filling. 

 

 

Figure 8-1: Bolivian Tin-Silver-Zinc Belt with Major Deposits 

The Chinchillas Project geology has some similarities to the San Cristóbal Mine in Bolivia where silver- 

zinc-lead is mined from an open pit with a mineralized dacite dome complex and also mineralization 

disseminated in adjacent basin-filling sediments. The San Cristóbal mine has estimated reserves (June 

30
th
, 2011) of 285 million tonnes, grading 1.41% zinc, 0.48% lead, and 53.0 g/t silver 

(www.minerasancristobal.com, Sept 1
st
 2015).   Chinchillas has similarities to many other nearby Bolivian-

type tin-silver-zinc deposits, namely: Potosí (Local co-operative miners and UNESCO mining world 

heritage site in Bolivia) and Pulacayo (27 million ounces of silver in Probable reserve at March 1
st
, 2013; 

www.apogeesilver.com, Sept 1
st
 2015) and Pirquitas (Silver Standard Resources Inc., 38 million ounces 

of Silver in Probable reserves at Dec 31
st
 2014, www.silverstandard.com, Sept 1

st
 2015).  



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 40 

 

Each of the nearby deposits has some similar characteristics to Chinchillas, and several have mining 

histories spanning hundreds of years.  The  study  of  these  nearby  deposits  has  helped  in  the 

understanding of Chinchillas and forms the basis for continuing exploration (Figure 8-2). In particular, all 

the deposits are known to have large vertical extents, with both Potosí and Pulacayo mined over 1,000 

metres of vertical extent, implying that there could be potential for additional mineralization at depth at 

Chinchillas.  

 

Figure 8-2: Simplified Model of Important Bolivian-style Sn-Ag-Zn-(Pb) Deposits and the 

Chinchillas Deposit.  

Most of these deposits are characterized by the intrusion of dacite dome complexes with mineralization 

hosted in shears and breccias within the dacite domes and / or within shears and breccias within the host 

rocks. At Pulacayo, Potosí and San Cristóbal, where associated domes are present there has been 

significant mineralization found within the domes.  More rarely, as in the case of Chinchillas and San 

Cristóbal, the deposits include disseminated mineralization in flat lying manto bodies within sediments 

and pyroclastic rocks. Chinchillas demonstrates phreatomagmatic diatreme morphology associated with a 

dome structure, as shown in Figure 8-3.

9 Exploration 

Exploration conducted by Golden Arrow since 2011 includes detailed mapping, sampling and geophysics 

to aid in the targeting of drill holes. Special emphasis was placed on mapping lithologies, alteration and 

structures to understand the controls of the mineralization. In the basement rocks bedding, foliation and 

brecciation were recorded.  

A handheld X-ray Fluorescence ("XRF") analyzer is used to measure approximate silver, lead and zinc 

values in all prospective outcrops. A total of 2,609 points were recorded. Additionally 1,491 rock samples 

were collected and assayed including chip and channel samples. At Chinchillas South and north of 

Socavon del Diablo, (Figure 9.1) 502 soil samples were collected, 151 of them were assayed and the 

remainder were checked with the handheld XRF analyzer.

Five trenches were completed at Chinchillas with an excavator. Two were located at the southern contact 

of Silver Mantos close to holes CGA-81 and CGA-82 (see Figure 7.14) to sample the tuff unit and the 

contact with the basement. Another trench was dug 120 metres east of hole CGA-31 (see Figure 7.18) 

and north of the creek at a small showing of a breccia with iron oxides. A breccia with a N20E strike 

assayed 178 g/t silver over 0.9 metres. It was one of the first indications of mineralization on the north 

side of the creek.  Two additional trenches were excavated north and east of hole CGA-158 at the 

northern contact between the tuffs with the basement.   

Talus sampling was carried out on the north of the Socavon del Diablo and west of the Mantos 

Basement,, and on the south margin of the dacitic dome. Results on the north area showed anomalous 

values of silver, lead and zinc, and later drilling successfully intersected mineralization in holes CGA-59, 

CGA-75, CGA-107 and CGA-115 (see Figure 7.18). A grid of soil samples was also completed at 

Chinchillas South.  

The 2013 geophysical surveys (IP/Resistivity, CSAMT, Magnetics) together with the re-interpretation of 

the 2008 IP survey was useful for targeting the Chinchillas South area, detecting deep structures and 

define the contact between the tuff unit and basement rocks.

10 Drilling 

10.1 Summary 

Six drill programs have been completed on the Chinchillas property (Table 10-1).  Aranlee Resources 

completed the first program in 1994, which included seven RC holes (CH1 to CH7). The results from the 

Aranlee holes were not used in any resource modeling as there is no quality control data.

Appendices I and II provide tables of the location and orientation of drill holes at the Chinchillas Project, 

for historic and Golden Arrow drilling, respectively. Figure 10-1 shows the location of drill holes. 

10.2 Silex Argentina S.A. Drilling 

The seven core holes drilled by Silex were HQ3 size (6.11cm diameter). Silex conducted a basic QA/QC 

program including blank, duplicate and SRM samples. Golden Arrow re-surveyed all the Silex drill collars 

using a differential GPS ("DGPS").  The remaining half core was re-logged and quarter core re-sampled 

at intervals for additional quality control checks. The Silex drilling cut two target zones. Holes CHD-10 and 

CHD-12 cut mineralized Socavon del Diablo breccias.  Holes CHD-14, CHD-15 and CHD-16 targeted 

deep mineralization at the centre of the volcanic throat. The holes averaged 350 metres in length and 

were unsuccessful at locating significant deep mineralization, however holes CHD-15 and CHD-16 did cut 

the Silver Mantos target at shallow depths (between five and 55 metres). These Silver Mantos intercepts 

were interpreted as narrow vertical structures.  Subsequent re-logging by Golden Arrow re-interpreted 

these intercepts as disseminated flat lying mineralization within pyroclastic tuffs and breccias.

10.3 Golden Arrow Drilling 

10.3.1 Methodology 

Energold Argentina S.A. ("Energold") was the contract diamond driller for Golden Arrow throughout Phase 

I and II drilling.   All drill core was HQ diameter (6.35 centimetre) except for 21 holes, (CGA-44, 53, 55,57, 

59, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 72, 73, 74, 77, 81, 82, 85, 87, 89 and 91) which were drilled with the S-3 rig 

with HQ diameter up to 150 metres deep and then reduced to NTW diameter (5.71 centimetre) until the 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 47 

 

end of the hole.  Phase III and IV drilling were performed by Falcon Drilling Argentina using HQ and HQ3 

(6.35 and 6.11 centimetre) diameter core except for holes CGA-127, CGA-149, CGA-170 and CGA-181, 

which were reduced to NQ (4.76 centimetre) to reach deeper depths.   

The drill cores were extracted and placed in appropriate boxes marked with drill hole number and the 

depth in metres. The boxes were transported by trained personnel from Golden Arrow. The contractor 

performed the measurement of the down hole deviation of the hole using single shot reflex instruments at 

50 metre intervals down the hole. Once finished (depth, azimuth, dip), the information was transferred to 

Golden Arrow geologists in digital format. Following completion, the drill pad was cleaned and a PVC tube 

was cemented at the drill collar with hole number, depth and azimuth inscribed on a metal ticket. 

The Golden Arrow drilling team followed a detailed written drilling and safety protocol for handling drill 

core (see Chapter 11). Once the core boxes reached the core shed, they were reviewed and organized. 

Measurements of recovery of every metre of the core and geotechnical measurements (fracture 

frequencies and RQD) were recorded. The cores in the boxes were subsequently photographed. Select 

intervals were temporarily removed for measurement of specific gravity. Golden Arrow staff recorded 

geological descriptions and marked the samples at one metre intervals in mineralized zones and two 

metre intervals in areas with no expected mineralization. The core was split using an electric saw and 

sampled according to marked intervals. 

10.3.2 Program Details 

Golden Arrow's first drilling program, conducted between May 2
nd

 and June 26
th

 2012, included 27 drill 

holes for 3,224.5 metres of drilling (CGA-17 to CGA-43). The program included one diamond drill core rig 

with the team working 24 hours in two shifts. 

The second drilling program, conducted between November 14
th
 2012 and February 27

th
 2013, included 

49 drill holes and 7,277.5 metres of drilling (CGA-44 to CGA-92). Hole CGA-51 had low recoveries within 

mineralized zones. Hole CGA-92 was re-drilled in the same location. The second phase drill program 

used two diamond drill core rigs with the team working 24 hours in two shifts. 

The third drilling program conducted in the first half of 2014 was performed with a track mounted drill rig. 

On hole CGA-96 the rods were trapped at 194.3 metres, ending in mineralization. The hole was re-drilled 

as hole CGA-126. A similar situation occurred at hole CGA-112, which was re-drilled as hole CGA-112B.   

The fourth drilling program was conducted from November 5
th
 2014 until April 9

th
 2015 with the same 

track mounted drill rig. Due to issues with drilling, holes CGA-171 and CGA-174 were re-drilled as CGA-

171B and CGA-174B respectively.  

The average recovery from the 30,661.1 metres drilled by Golden Arrow was 94 percent, including the 

first six metres where recovery was commonly less than 50 percent. 

Appendix III includes summary tables of the mineralized intercepts from all drill programs.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

The following details the sample preparation, analysis and security details used by Golden Arrow in the 

Phase IV drill campaign.  For details of methodologies used by Silex Argentina and Golden Arrow in 

earlier drill campaigns, the reader is referred to Chapter 11 of the previous technical reports (Davis and 

Howie, 2013; Davis et al., 2014). 

11.1 Sampling Method and Approach 

For details of Golden Arrow drilling procedures please refer to Section 10.3.1. Subsequent to drilling, the 

core was placed in wooden boxes and Golden Arrow´s technicians measured the recovery and RQD. A 

handheld XRF analyzer was used to measure approximate silver, lead and zinc values every metre. 

These results were useful to identify mineralized intervals and check subsequent assay values.  

All core in boxes was photographed and the specific gravity was measured every 10 to 20 metres (see 

Section 11.5). The core was logged and samples were marked with an interval of one metre in 

mineralized zones and two metres in areas with no expected mineralization. Intervals deemed to have 

low or no mineralization had pulps composited by the laboratory prior to analysis, using equal masses, 

with the resulting composite samples representing two to six metre intervals.     

Except for some intervals of holes CGA-166, CGA-168, CGA-169, CGA-170 and CGA-171B where no 

mineralization was expected, the rest of the holes were sampled and assayed in their entirety. The core 

was marked and cut in half for sampling using a diamond saw. Half the core was returned to the box 

while the other half was bagged.  Corresponding tags were inserted, one in the plastic sample bag and 

the second in the wooden box. Quality control samples were inserted in sample bags and allocated in 

order for the laboratory to have a control sample in every batch.  

11.2 Sample Custody and Security 

Samples bags were placed in larger sacks (between six and ten samples per sack) and were sealed. 

Sealing numbers were recorded in the Chain of Custody database. The sacks were shipped by private 

truck to the Alex Stewart (Assayers) Argentina S.A. laboratory in Mendoza, ("Alex Stewart") where the 

sample preparation and analysis was performed.  

Samples were received by the laboratory and the reception was reported to Golden Arrow. No damage or 

missing samples were ever reported during transportation. 

11.3 Sample Preparation 

Samples were prepared by method P-5 which includes drying the samples at 90°C, crushing the entire 

sample up to 80 percent passing 10 mesh, splitting 1,000 grams with a Jones riffle splitter and pulverizing 

to 95 percent passing 140 mesh. The pulverized material or pulp was then sampled and 200 grams of 

pulp was sent to the laboratory. In the case of the composites, equal masses of correlative sample pulps 

were combined to form the composite.  

11.4 Sample Analysis 

Alex Stewart was the primary laboratory and ALS in Peru ("ALS") was used as the secondary laboratory 

(see Section 11.6.5 for details). All samples were tested for a suite of 39 elements including silver, lead 

and zinc by a four acid digestion method and analysis by Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometry, 

("ICP") method ICP-MA-39). Silver greater than 200 ppm was assayed by fire assay using a 50 gram 

sample with gravimetric finish (method Ag4A-50).  Lead and zinc greater than 10,000 ppm were re-

assayed by an oxidizing acid digestion for ore grade material and reading by ICP (method ICP-ORE).  



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 49 

 

Alex Stewart is an international laboratory certified under ISO 9001:2008, ISO 17025:2008 and ISO 

14001: 2004. 

11.5 Specific Gravity 

During the Phase IV drill program, Golden Arrow collected 692 samples of core approximately ten 

centimeters long every 15 metres to determine specific gravity ("SG"). Samples were dried for two hours 

at 90°C in an electric oven. After cooling, the samples were sealed with a plastic film to cover the entire 

piece of core. The weight of the plastic was ignored in the calculations since the volume was insignificant 

(less than 1 gram of plastic film compared with the 900 gram average weight of each sample). The 

samples were weighed in air and then weighed in water while hanging from a frame. The results from 692 

samples produced an average specific gravity of 2.37, but as expected, the SG values of the basement 

rocks and dacites (2.59 and 2.40 respectively) were greater than the volcanic tuffs (2.13). The overall 

average SG from samples collected on Phases II, III and IV was 2.59 for the basement rocks, 2.40 for the 

dacites and 2.10 for the tuffs. One outlier SG of 9.6 in a tuff was removed from the calculations due to a 

likely error in the measurements. The formula applied for the calculation was: 

SG =   (Weight in air) / (Weight in water) 

The following graphic shows the specific gravity results of Phases II, III and IV drilling.

11.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

The same Quality Assurance and Quality Control ("QA/QC") system established for the previous drilling 

phases was used in this fourth drilling phase. The system specifies the procedures for handling and 

sampling of the core, the logging, the QC samples to include in the batches and the procedure for the 

chain of custody.  QC samples, including blanks, duplicates and certified reference materials ("CRM's"), 

were inserted in the field in each batch of samples, to check the precision and accuracy of the laboratory. 

A total of 1431 quality control samples were inserted as shown in Table 11-1.

11.6.1 Blanks 

Coarse and fine blanks were used to detect contamination problems and cross labeling in the process. 

The blank used was not a certified material from a vendor but was made from a tuff breccia with 

essentially no silver mineralization and low grade base metals values. It was sampled by Golden Arrow 

personnel and assayed by Alex Stewart Assayers showing the following grades:

GA67298 <0.5 42 200 

GA67299 <0.5 59 84 

AVERAGE <0.5 66 173 

 

An internal certificate was produced (BL-CH-1G) with these averages. The blank material used for QC 

purposes was not certified by a round robin process at several accredited laboratories; however, assay 

QC results indicate the material appears to be sufficiently homogeneous to detect sample contamination.  

The acceptance values were three times the reference value. In the case of the silver the acceptance 

value was three times the detection limit (1.5 ppm silver).  



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 51 

 

From the 211 coarse blank samples, there were nine outliers in silver, lead and zinc as shown in Figure 

11-2. Following the internal protocol, coarse rejects of these samples plus two samples above and two 

below were re-assayed. In all cases, values were confirmed. The original weight of the samples was 

coincident with the weight of the blanks. However, the colour of the pulps and rejects of the outlier blanks 

were not coincident with the colour of the typical blanks. After investigation, it was concluded that the 

outlier "blank" samples were incorrectly obtained from a bag of mineralized hand rock specimens instead 

of the bag with the blank tuff material. Actions were taken to avoid this error in future.  

 

 

Figure 11-2: Silver Values in Coarse Blanks (BL-CH-1G)  

The fine blanks were made from the fine rejects of coarse blanks of the previous drilling phase. The 

original assays were averaged and an internal report was produced (BL-CH-2F). Average values were: 

<0.5 ppm silver, 23 ppm lead and 69 ppm of zinc. The acceptance values were three times the reference 

value.  

During the present drilling phase, a total of 214 fine blanks were inserted in the batches as part of the QC 

program. Silver values were always below the acceptance limit of 1.5 g/t silver. Lead and zinc values 

were also below the acceptance limit except for five outliers in lead with values between 82 and 201 ppm 

and two outliers in zinc with values between 261 and 265 ppm. These values might reflect some 

contamination in the laboratory but the absolute values, even though higher than the acceptance limit, 

were not deemed to be significant.

11.6.2 Field Duplicates 

Field duplicates were intended to check the homogeneity of the mineralization, sampling errors in the 

splitting and any cross labeling of samples. They were generated by cutting the samples in half, so the 

duplicate and its original each represent one quarter of the entire core. A total of 209 pairs of field 

duplicates were produced during Phase IV drilling. 

The pairs with values close to the lower detection limit were removed due to the poor repeatability of 

results. The criterion applied was six times the lower detection limit, which corresponds to 3 ppm of silver, 

12 ppm of lead and 6 ppm of zinc. The same criterion was applied for the coarse and fine duplicates and 

for the comparison between the primary and secondary laboratories. 

For the evaluation of the data, three types of graphics were produces: X/Y with the Coefficient of 

Determination R
2
 (Figure 11-3), the Mean Percentage Difference (MPD) versus average grade (Figure 

11-4) and the Accumulated MPD (Figure 11-5). The MPD is calculated as the percentage of Ix1-x2I / 

(x1+x2)/2.  

A pair of field duplicates of hole CGA-135 from 140 to 141 metres showed the greatest difference with 

161 g/t silver and 4926 g/t lead versus the duplicate with 630 g/t silver and 18400 g/t lead. Re-assay of 

these samples confirmed the previous values. The reason of such difference is attributed to the presence 

of a fracture subparallel to the core filled with coarse galena. The two sub-samples probably host different 

amounts of the argentiferous galena. By removing this pair of duplicates the Coefficient of Determination 

R2 increase to 0.924 in silver and 0.77 in lead.

Figure 11-4: MPD vs Average Value for Field Duplicates (Ag values) 

By removing the pair of duplicates mentioned before, the field duplicates from the Phase IV drilling show 

a similar correlation to the previous Phases II and III drill programs (Davis et al, 2014). Table 11-3 shows 

the different statistical values from the three drilling phases. In the Phase IV drilling campaign, the 

percentage of pairs with less than 30% MPD decreased to 60 in silver, remained similar in lead and 

increased to 84 in the case of the zinc.

During the previous drilling program, several pairs of field duplicates with a difference of more than thirty 

percent for one metal were re-assayed and in all cases the original values were confirmed. The 

differences are, therefore, attributed to the variability of the mineralization.

11.6.3 Coarse and Fine Duplicates 

During the Phase IV drill program, coarse and fine duplicates were incorporated in the quality control 

process. A total of 125 of the coarse rejects (at 10 mesh) were re-labeled with a new number, re-assayed 

at Alex Stewart and considered as coarse duplicates. The same procedure was applied to 277 fine rejects 

(pulps) and these were considered as fine duplicates. Assay of the fine duplicates is not intended to 

validate the assay process since each part of the duplicate pair was assayed in the same lab. 

Figure 11-5 shows a summary of all three types of duplicates for the silver. Curves for lead and zinc show 

similar tendency as for the silver.

11.6.4 Certified Reference Materials 

A set of Certified Reference Materials ("CRM") was used to check the accuracy and precision of the 

laboratory. The same three reference materials used during Phase III were used during this Phase IV. 

They were: 1-CH, 2-CH and 3-CH. These were originally prepared by ACME-Mendoza at the request of 

Golden Arrow from rejects of previous drill core from the Chinchillas Project. The 1-CH and 2-CH 

standards have low (41g/t) and intermediate (146g/t) silver grades and were packaged in 30 gm

envelopes because they do not require fire assay. 3-CH with high silver content (862 g/t) was packaged 

in 120 gm envelopes to accommodate the larger sample requirements of the fire assay testing.  

A total of 78 CRM of 1-CH, 78 of 2-CH and 72 of CH-3 were inserted along the Phase IV drilling. All 

assay results from the 1-CH fell within three standard deviations (Figure 11-6). In the case of the 2-CH  

there is one value outside three standard deviations, (Figure 11-6) which is in process of re-analysis 

along with two samples immediately before and after in the assay stream. The results of the assays of 3-

CH fell within two standard deviations (Figure 11-7).

Figure 11-7: Silver Values from Reference Material 3-CH 

Lead reference materials 1-CH to 3-CH show lower precision in the last batch of holes, numbers CGA-

170 to CGA-182 (Figure 11-9). To assess the situation 198 samples are being re-analyzed. Results from 

this remedial program are outstanding at this time. Any changes to the final results for these samples are 

not likely to have any material impact on the resource estimate.

Figure 11-8: Lead Values from Reference Materials 1-CH, 2-CH and 3-CH 

In the case of the zinc, reference materials 2-CH and 3-CH were assayed by method ICP-MA and all 

values are within ± two standard deviations, except for one sample below the three standard deviation 

limit (Figures 11-9 and 11-10). Reference material 1-CH was assayed by method ICP-ORE. The CRM 

shows a possible bias in the values from the last batch of samples. The re-assay program in process for 

the lead samples includes samples >1% zinc.

11.6.5 Secondary Laboratory for Checks 

ALS Peru was used as secondary laboratory. A total of 181 pulps were sent to ALS to be tested by 

method ME-ICP61 based on a four acid digestion and reading by ICP. Samples greater than one percent 

lead or zinc were re-tested using ore grade method Pb-OG62 and Zn-OG62. Samples in the range of 

100-1,500 ppm silver were re-assayed by ore grade method Ag-OG62 which uses an Aqua Regia 

digestion and ICP or AAS ("Atomic Absorption Spectrometry") analytical finish. Samples above 1,500 ppm 

silver were re-assayed by fire assay with gravimetric finish (method Ag-GRA21). ALS Peru is part of an 

international laboratory system and has ISO 9001:2008 and 17025:2005 certifications.  

As with the field/coarse/fine duplicates, the lab duplicate pairs with values close to the lower limit of 

detection were removed due to the poor precision of results, leaving only the greater than three ppm 

silver values.  

Figure 11-11 shows the comparison for the silver-lead-zinc values. The curve of lead values reflects the 

same difference as reported for the reference material.

12 Data Verification 

12.1 Database Validation 

12.1.1 Collar Coordinate Validation 

Validation of collar elevation data was done by comparing elevations from DGPS field surveys against the 

satellite photo digital elevation model ("DEM"). Precision of the DGPS is between 15 and 70 centimetres. 

The GeoEye high resolution stereo ortho-rectified DEM purchased by GRG provided elevation values for 

comparison. Most elevation differences in the collars were less than one metre. The largest difference 

occurred in three aligned holes (CGA-143, CGA-149 and CGA-153) where differences between 3.6 and 

4.3 metres with the DEM are due to a local depression in the terrain because of a small drainage.  

12.1.2 Down-Hole Survey Validation 

Before the beginning of Phase III drilling it was noted that the correction of the magnetic declination 

between true north and magnetic north was correct in angle but had the opposite direction. For this 

reason, all azimuths of drill holes of Phases I and II were corrected by 13 degrees counterclockwise. No 

other adjustments were necessary for the other drilling phases. 

The down-hole survey data were validated by searching for large discrepancies between the dip and 

azimuth reading against the previous reading. No significant discrepancies were found.  

12.1.3 Assay Verification 

All the collars, surveys, geology and assays were exported from Micromine Geobank software into 

EXCEL® files and then into Minesight® software. The validation process of Geobank confirms that each 

sample ID is associated with a drillhole, there are no identical sample ID's, all FROM_TO data are zero or 

positive and no interval can exceed the total depth of the hole. To validate the data, the following checks 

were confirmed: 

 The maximum depth of samples were checked against hole depth; 

 The values of less than the detection limit were converted into a positive number one-half the 

detection limit; 

 The highest silver values and at least one random value from each drill hole were checked 

against the original assay certificate 

 The units were converted from parts per million (ppm) into percent (%) for lead and zinc values 

Two methods of analysis were used for silver. Initially, samples were analysed using a four acid digestion 

followed by ICP. Samples with silver values greater than 200 ppm were further analyzed by fire assay on 

a 50 gram sample charge with a gravimetric finish.   

Core recovery averaged just over 95%. The more friable tuff unit had an average recovery of 93.8%. The 

Dacite average recovery was 97.9% while the basement unit average was 96.6%. There is no indication 

that grade is related to core recovery. 

Following the completion of the mineral resource model, the sample data from 8 randomly selected drill 

holes completed between 2012 and 2015, representing approximately 5% of the holes in the database, 

was exported from MineSight® for validation purposes. The silver, lead and zinc grades were manually 

compared to the values listed in certified assay certificates provided from the lab. Of the 1,232 samples 

checked, no errors were identified. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 62 

 

Silex drillhole assay data were validated as reported in a previous Technical Report (Davis et al, 2013).  

12.2 QA/QC protocol 
 

A review of the QA/QC protocols was conducted prior to drilling and formalized in a detailed QA/QC 

manual developed by Golden Arrow. Onsite reviews were conducted during drilling phases (years 2012, 

2013, 2014,) by QP Bruce Smith. The procedures for core processing, the insertion of blanks and 

standards, and for the duplicate sampling regime were examined. The QA/QC program has been 

conducted in accordance with industry best practice as described in Section 11 of this report.  

12.3 Geological Data Verification and Interpretation 

While several geology variables were captured during core logging, only lithology was built into the 

geological model. Therefore, geology data verification was limited to determining that the lithology 

designation was correct in each sample interval.  This included the following: 

 

 From – to intervals for gaps, overlaps and duplicated intervals; 

 Collar and sample identification mismatches; 

 Correct geology codes. 

 

A geological legend was provided by Golden Arrow and compared to the values logged in the database. 

Data were loaded into modeling software and examined for discrepancies in logging. Errors were fixed 

after consultation with field geologists. The geological models were constructed in collaboration between 

Golden Arrow field geologists, Chief Geologist Hugo Caranza and QP Bruce Smith. Initial geological 

modelling was exported to DXF for inclusion in MineSight. 

The geological model is reasonable and adequate for use in the 2015 resource estimate. 

12.4 Conclusion 

No material sample bias was identified by the QP's during the review of the drill data and assays. 

Observation of the drill core during the site visits and inspection and validation of the data collected 

convinced the QP's that the drill data is adequate for the estimation of Inferred and Indicated resources.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

A metallurgical test program was initiated in January 2013 and continued in stages, with the most recent 

work completed in July 2014.  The test work is undertaken by Bureau Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd,                                       

Inspectorate Metallurgical Division ("Inspectorate") of Richmond, B.C Canada, under the direction of Mr. 

John R. W. Fox, B.Sc., P.Eng. of Laurion Inc., independent consultant to the Company and a Qualified 

Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101.  To date all testing has been bench-scale. Results from 

the early test work stages are summarized in the previous technical report (Kuchling et.al., 2014).   

The following is a summary of the most recent testing program, on composite samples from the Silver 

Mantos zone, ("MAN-2") the Socavon del Diablo Zone ("SOC-2") and the Mantos Basement zone ("BAS-

1"). This program included locked cycle testing, providing the most representative view of the overall 

metallurgical performance of the samples to date.  The following summary is excerpted from the final 

report titled "2014 Project Report on Metallurgical Testing on the Chinchillas Project" prepared by Bureau 

Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd,   Inspectorate Metallurgical Division (Chen and Redfearn, 2014):   

[Seven core] samples [received on October 15, 2013 weighing 102 kg] were air dried and 

separated into three composites.  Each composite was individually crushed to 6 mesh, mixed and 

split into the required samples for testing. Silver contents range from 94.2 to 150.6 g/tonne and 

base metals include lead and zinc. 

In this testing program, it was confirmed that Chinchillas samples are usually amenable to 

conventional lead and zinc flotation process. For most of the samples, the majority of Ag was 

recovered in Pb circuit. Overall Ag, Pb, and Zn recoveries are above 95%. Most products cleaned 

well. Upgrading of composites BAS-1, MAN-2, and SOC-2 generated Pb products with grades 

ranging from 65% to 79% Pb while Zn products graded 52 to 62%.  

Locked cycle tests on three samples (BAS-1, MAN-2, and SOC-2) proved that very high Ag and 

Pb recoveries in Pb circuit can be achieved along with good Pb grades. For composites BAS-1 

and SOC-2, good Zn concentrates grading 51.8% and 60.1% respectively were obtained. The 

overall metallurgical performance is summarized in the following table:

The metallurgical test work program will continue as the project progresses, and in the future will include 

samples from the Socavon Basement, which is a newly defined zone. For the purposes of this resource 

estimate the metallurgical parameters and recoveries for the Socavon Basement are assumed to be the 

same as the Mantos Basement, based on similarities in geology and mineralization.

14 Mineral Resource Estimates 

14.1 Introduction 

This chapter describes an update to the mineral resource model for the Chinchillas deposit located in 

Jujuy Province, Argentina. The resource estimate is based on a database provided by Golden Arrow 

Resources Corporation on July 8, 2015 which includes drill hole sample data and a series of 3D 

(wireframe) objects representing the distribution of various lithologic units and the surface topography. 

This mineral resource estimate was prepared under the direction of Robert Sim, P.Geo, SIM Geological 

Inc. ("SGI"), with the assistance of Bruce Davis, FAusIMM, BD Resource Consulting, Inc. ("BDRC"). 

Based on education, work experience relevant to this style of mineralization and deposit type, and 

membership in a recognized professional organization, both Sim and Davis are independent Qualified 

Persons within the requirements of National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) for the purpose of the mineral 

resource estimate contained in this report.  

The mineral resource has been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM Estimation of 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practices Guidelines (CIM, 2003) and is reported in 

accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators' ("CSA") NI 43-101 (CSA, 2011). Mineral 

resources are not mineral reserves and they do not have demonstrated economic viability. Bruce Davis 

was involved in the generation of two previous resource models for the Chinchillas project (Davis and 

Howie, 2013, Davis et. al, 2014). 

Estimations are made from 3D block models based on geostatistical applications using commercial mine 

planning software (MineSight
®
 v10.0-2).  The project limits are based on metric UTM coordinates.  The 

nominal block size in the model is 10 x 10 x 5 m (LxWxH). Sample data is derived from diamond drill core 

holes dating back to 2007. The majority of drilling on the property has been conducted by Golden Arrow 

since 2012. 

The resource estimate has been generated from drill hole sample assay results and the interpretation of a 

geologic model which relates to the spatial distribution of silver, lead and zinc. Interpolation 

characteristics were defined based on the geology, drill hole spacing, and geostatistical analysis of the 

data.  The resources were classified according to their proximity to sample data locations and were 

reported, as required by NI 43-101, according to the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and 

Mineral Reserves (CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions, 2014). All prices are listed in US 

dollars. 

14.2 Available Data 

On July 8, 2015, Golden Arrow provided the drill hole database in a series of spreadsheet (Excel™) files 

containing collar and survey data as well as assay results and geologic information. Also provided were 

3D interpretations, in DXF format, representing the various lithologic units in the deposit area. These data 

were formatted and imported into MineSight®. Silver, lead and zinc mineralization occurs in two areas on 

the property which, for the purposes of grade estimation, are separated into a western area termed 

"Mantos" and eastern termed "Socavon" (see 14.5.4).  The Mantos area includes the Silver Mantos and 

Mantos Basement mineralized zones, while the Socavon includes the Socavon del Diablo and Socavon 

Basement zones, as described in section 7.5.1.  Elevated silver, lead and zinc grades tend to occur 

together throughout the deposit area and, as a result, equivalent silver grades are utilized in the 

generation and reporting of mineral resources at Chinchillas. 

The database contains a total of 176 diamond drill (core) holes with a cumulative length of 32,881 m.  The 

distribution of drilling relative to the surface topography is shown in Figure 14-1. A total of 55 new drill 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 66 

 

holes have been completed since the previous resource estimate was generated in August 2014. The 

distribution of these new drill holes is shown in Figure 14-2. The most recent drilling program has 

expanded the mineralization laterally and at depth in both the Mantos and Socavon areas.   

 

Figure 14-1: Isometric View Showing the Distribution of Silver Grades in Drilling 

 

Figure 14-2: Isometric View Showing the Distribution of New Drilling Completed Since the 

Previous Resource Estimate Completed in October 2014 

There are a total of 24,033 individual samples in the assay database. The majority of these samples have 

been analyzed by ICP for a suite of 39 elements. The silver, lead and zinc data has been extracted from 

the main database and imported into MineSight in the development of the resource model. A total of 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 67 

 

1,109 metres of drilling (3.4%) has not been sampled and analyzed. The majority of these unsampled 

intervals occur in overburden and the others represent intervals with no core recovery. There have been 

no adjustments to the database to account for these missing samples – they are ignored during the 

development of the resource model. 

The database also contains a total of 1,673 samples that have been tested for bulk density. These 

samples were obtained from core selected at approximately 15 metre intervals down most drill holes 

giving a relatively consistent distribution of density data throughout the deposit areas.  

Individual assay sample intervals range from 0.1 metres to 10 metres, and average 1.32 m in length. 77% 

of the samples are exactly one metre in length and 19% of the samples are two metres long. Values 

analyzed below the detection limit (<DL) were assigned values equal to one half of the detection limit 

(½DL). The basic statistical summary of the assay sample data is shown in Table 14-1

Statistics for silver, lead and zinc are weighted by sample length. 

Core recovery averaged just over 95%. The more friable tuff unit had an average recovery of 93.8%. The 

dacite average recovery was 97.9% while the basement unit average was 96.6%. There was no 

indication of a relationship between core recovery and grade.  

14.3 Geologic Model, Domains and Coding 

The Chinchillas deposit is interpreted to be formed as a result of a Tertiary aged diatreme intrusion into a 

host of Paleozoic basement schists. Heat from the intrusion resulted in mineralization in the form of 

disseminations, veinlets and matrix filling within the volcanic breccias and tuffs as well as within the 

originals schists. 

Geologists from Golden Arrow provided a series of 3D wireframe domains representing the various 

lithologic units present on the property. The general distribution of these units is shown in cross section in 

Figure 14-3. Note that higher-grade silver (and lead and zinc) mineralization occurs predominantly in the 

tuffaceous phase of the intrusive rocks and also within the brecciated zone in the underlying basement 

schists. However, relatively high grade mineralization can be found in all rock types.   

There are no significant zones of oxidation or supergene enrichment and overburden tends to be non-

existent or, when present, less than five metres in thickness.

NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 68 

 

 

Figure 14-3: Vertical Cross Section Showing Rock Types and Silver Grades in Drilling    

14.4 Compositing 

Compositing of drill hole samples is carried out in order to standardize the database for further statistical 

evaluation.  This step eliminates any effect related to the sample length that may exist in the data. 

To retain the original characteristics of the underlying data, a composite length is selected which 

reasonably reflects the average original sample length.  The generation of longer composites results in 

some degree of smoothing which could mask certain features of the data.  Sample intervals are relatively 

consistent in the database: 77% of the samples are exactly one metre in length and 19% of the samples 

are two metres long. As a result, a standard composite length of one metre has been applied to the 

sample data. 

Drill hole composites are length-weighted and have been generated down-the-hole; this means that 

composites begin at the top of each hole and are generated at 1-m intervals down the length of the hole. 

Several holes were randomly selected and the composited values were checked for accuracy. No errors 

were found. 

14.5 Exploratory Data Analysis 

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves the statistical summarization of the database in order to better 

understand the characteristics of the data that may control grade.  One of the main purposes of this 

exercise is to determine if there is evidence of spatial distinctions in grade which may require the 

separation and isolation of domains during interpolation.  The application of separate domains prevents 

unwanted mixing of data during grade interpolation so that the resulting grade model will better reflect the 

unique properties of the deposit. However, applying domain boundaries in areas where the data are not 

statistically unique may impose a bias in the distribution of grades in the model.   

A domain boundary, which segregates the data during interpolation, is typically applied if the average 

grade in one domain is significantly different from that of another domain.  A boundary may also be 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 69 

 

applied where there is evidence that a significant change in the grade distribution exists across a geologic 

contact. 

14.5.1 Basic Statistics by Lithology Domain 

Basic statistics for the distributions of silver, lead and zinc were generated by lithology type and are 

presented in the boxplots below (Figures 14-4 to 14-6). 

The distributions are similar for all three metals; higher grades in the Tuff and Basement Breccia but 

relatively high grades can also be found in the Dacite and Basement rocks. Higher zinc grades are 

present in the Socavon area.

NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 70 

 

 

Figure 14-6: Boxplots Showing Zinc by Lithology Type 

14.5.2 Contact Profiles 

Contact profiles evaluate the nature of grade trends between two domains: they graphically display the 

average grades at increasing distances from the contact boundary. Those contact profiles that show a 

marked difference in grade across a domain boundary indicate that the two datasets should be isolated 

during interpolation. Conversely, if a more gradual change in grade occurs across a contact, the 

introduction of a hard boundary (e.g., segregation during interpolation) may result in a much different 

trend in the grade model; in this case, the change in grade between domains in the model is often more 

abrupt than the trends seen in the raw data. Finally, a flat contact profile indicates no grade changes 

across the boundary; in this case, hard or soft domain boundaries will produce similar results in the 

model. 

Contact profiles were generated to evaluate the change in grades across prominent lithologic types. The 

results for silver, lead and zinc are quite similar. Examples of the results for silver are shown in the figures 

below. 

Figure 14-7 shows similar or transitional changes in grade between the Basement Breccia verses the 

Basement rocks and the Tuff verses the Dacite.

Figure 14-7: Contact Profiles of Silver by Lithology Type 

The distributions shown in Figure 14-8 show an abrupt change in grade between the Tuff and Basement 

Breccia but essentially no difference between the Tuff and Basement rocks.

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 72 

 

14.5.3 Modeling Implications 

The results of the EDA indicate that elevated grades tend to occur in the Tuff and Basement Breccia 

rocks but high grades can also occur in the other lithologic types. The contact profiles suggest that abrupt 

changes in grade occur between some rock types. However, visual review of the data shows that in some 

areas there are sharp changes in grade at lithologic contacts but in other areas, high-grades persist 

across these boundaries. Overall, the distribution of grades in the deposit tends to occur near the contact 

between the intrusive volcanic phases and the host schist rocks and mineralization can occur in any and 

all rock types. Therefore, lithologic type is not a distinct control over the distribution of mineralization in 

this deposit. 

14.5.4 Generation of Grade Probability Shell 

In most parts of the deposit there is a relatively strong correlation between silver, lead and zinc, with silver 

as the main economic contributor. Parts of Socavon are quite rich in zinc and relatively low in silver 

content. All metals contribute to the economic potential of the project and, as a result, these are 

combined, in a general way, for use in the generation of the grade probability shell domain. The combined 

"silver equivalent" (AgEq) grades are calculated for all composited sample intervals based on the 

following assumptions: 

 Silver price: $19/oz Ag 

 Lead price: $1/lb Pb 

 Zinc price: $1/lb Zn 

 AgEq = Au g/t + (Pb% ∗ 36.09) + ( Zn% * 36.09) 

Indicator values are assigned to samples using a grade threshold of 20 g/t AgEq. This threshold is below 

the economic cut-off, ensuring that some internal dilution is appropriately retained in the model, but this 

provides a reasonable segregation of mineralized and unmineralized rocks. Probability estimates were 

made in model blocks using ordinary kriging, and a shell was created that enveloped areas, within a 

maximum distance of 100 metres from drilling, where there is a >50% probability that the grade will 

exceed 20 g/t AgEq. Note that separate indicator variograms were generated for the main Mantos and

resulting probability shell is shown in Figure 14-9.

14.5.5 Conclusions 

Ultimately, the distributions of silver, lead and zinc in the resource model are controlled using the silver 

equivalent probability shell as a hard boundary domain, meaning sample data inside and outside of the 

domain is not mixed during block grade interpolation. 

14.6 Bulk Density Data 

Specific gravity (SG) measurements were conducted on a total of 1,673 drill core samples from the 

various drill programs using the methodology described in section 11.5.   These SG measurements are 

utilized as bulk densities to generate resource tonnages from the block block model. Individual density 

(SG) measurements range from 1.5 t/m
3
 to 2.91 t.m

3
 and average 2.34t/m

3
. Note that one anomalous (or 

incorrect) value of 9.50t/m
3
 was removed from the database.  

The available density data was loaded into MineSight® and reviewed. It is quite evident that variations in 

rock density occur in the various lithologic units. The density of the Tuff averages 2.09 t/m
3
 and the Dacite 

is 2.38 t/m
3
. The underlying Basement Breccia and Basement rocks are similar with averages of 2.58 t/m

3
 

and 2.61t/m
3
 respectively. Density measurements have been taken at approximately 15 metre intervals 

down the majority of the drill holes. The volume and distribution of density data is considered to be 

sufficient to allow for direct interpolation of density values into model blocks. The lithologic domains are 

used to control the distribution of density data during this process. 

14.7 Evaluation of Outlier Grades 

Histograms and probability plots of the distribution of all elements were reviewed in order to identify the 

existence of anomalous outlier grades in the composite database. Potential outlier samples were visually 

reviewed to determine their location in relation to the surrounding data. It was decided that anomalous 

samples would be controlled, in most cases, using a combination of traditional top-cutting and outlier 

limitations. Samples above the outlier limit threshold grades are restricted to a maximum distance of 

influence during interpolation of 75 metres when interpolating silver grades and 50 metres for lead and

NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 74 

 

zinc. This difference in the range of influence is a reflection of the somewhat lower degree of continuity in 

the distribution of lead and zinc compared to silver in the deposit. 

The various controls applied to potentially anomalous sample data are summarized in Table 14-2. In the 

main Mantos area, these measures have resulted in a reduction in contained metal of four percent for 

silver, two percent for lead and one percent for zinc. In the Socavon area, contained silver is reduced by 

five percent, lead by four percent and zinc by 0.5 percent. The proportion of metal lost in the model due to 

these controls is considered appropriate for all elements.

14.8 Variography 

The degree of spatial variability in a mineral deposit depends on both the distance and direction between 

points of comparison. Typically, the variability between samples increases as the distance between those 

samples increases. If the degree of variability is related to the direction of comparison, then the deposit is 

said to exhibit anisotropic tendencies which can be summarized with the search ellipse. The semi-

variogram is a common function used to measure the spatial variability within a deposit. 

The components of the variogram include the nugget, the sill, and the range. Often samples compared 

over very short distances, even samples compared from the same location, show some degree of 

variability. As a result, the curve of the variogram often begins at some point on the y-axis above the 

origin: this point is called the nugget. The nugget is a measure of not only the natural variability of the 

data over very short distances, but also a measure of the variability which can be introduced due to errors 

during sample collection, preparation, and the assay process.  

The amount of variability between samples typically increases as the distance between the samples 

increases.  Eventually, the degree of variability between samples reaches a constant, maximum value; 

this is called the sill, and the distance between samples at which this occurs is called the range.

The spatial evaluation of the data in this report was conducted using a correlogram rather than the 

traditional variogram. The correlogram is normalized to the variance of the data and is less sensitive to 

outlier values, generally giving better results. 

Correlograms were generated using the commercial software package SAGE 2001© (Isaaks & Co.). 

Multidirectional correlograms were generated for the three metals in each of the Mantos and Socavon 

areas. Correlograms were generated using data inside of the probability shell domain and these were 

used when interpolating grades both inside and outside of the shell domain. The results are summarized 

in Table 14-3.

14.9 Model Setup and Limits 

A block model was initialized in MineSight® and the dimensions are shown in Table 14-4. The extents of 

the block model are represented by the purple rectangle shown in  

Figure 14-9. The selection of a nominal block size measuring 10 x 10 x 5 m is considered appropriate 

with respect to the current drill hole spacing and the application of open pit mining methods.

Blocks in the model were coded on a majority basis with the various lithologic and probability shell 

domains. During this stage, blocks along a domain boundary are coded if >50% of the block occurs within 

the boundaries of that domain.   

The proportion of blocks which occur below the topographic surfaces are also calculated and stored in the 

model as individual percentage items.  These values are used as weighting factors to determining the in-

situ resources for the deposit. 

14.10 Interpolation Parameters 

The block model grades for all elements are estimated using ordinary kriging ("OK"). The results of the 

OK estimation are compared with the Hermitian Polynomial Change of Support method, also referred to 

as the Discrete Gaussian Correction. This method is described in greater detail in Section 14-11.   

The Chinchillas OK models were generated with a relatively limited number of samples in order to match 

the change of support or Herco (HERmitian COrrection) grade distribution.  This approach reduces the 

amount of smoothing or averaging in the model and, while there may be some uncertainty on a localized 

scale, this approach produces reliable estimations of the recoverable grade and tonnage for the overall 

deposit. 

All grade estimations use length-weighted composite drill hole sample data.  The interpolation parameters 

are summarized in Tables 14-5, 14-6 and 14-7.

Specific gravity estimates were made in model blocks using the inverse distance weighting to the power 

of two ("ID2") interpolation method. Densities are estimated with a maximum of two composites per drill 

hole and a maximum of six composites in total. The lithology domains provide hard boundary conditions 

during estimation and samples below 1.75t/m
3
 excluded as these are considered to be anomalous.  

14.11 Validation 

The results of the modeling process were validated using several methods.  These include a thorough 

visual review of the model grades in relation to the underlying drill hole sample grades, comparisons with 

the change of support model, comparisons with other estimation methods, and grade distribution 

comparisons using swath plots. 

14.11.1 Visual Inspection 

A detailed visual inspection of the block model was conducted in both section and plan to ensure the 

desired results following interpolation.  This included confirmation of the proper coding of blocks within the 

various domains.  The distribution of block grades were compared relative to the drill hole samples in 

order to ensure the proper representation in the model.   

14.11.2 Model Checks for Change of Support 

The relative degree of smoothing in the block model estimates is evaluated using the Discrete Gaussian 

Correction; it is also referred to as the Hermitian Polynomial Change of Support method (Journel and 

Huijbregts, 1978). With this method, the distribution of the hypothetical block grades can be directly 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 78 

 

compared to the estimated OK model through the use of pseudo-grade/tonnage curves. Adjustments are 

made to the block model interpolation parameters until an acceptable match is made with the Herco 

(HERmitian COrrection) distribution. In general, the estimated model should be slightly higher in tonnage 

and slightly lower in grade when compared to the Herco distribution at the projected cut-off grade. These 

differences account for selectivity and other potential ore-handling issues which commonly occur during 

mining. 

The Herco distribution is derived from the declustered composite grades which are adjusted to account 

for the change in support, moving from smaller drill hole composite samples to the larger blocks in the 

model. The transformation results in a less-skewed distribution, but it has the same mean as the original 

declustered samples. 

All modeled elements were validated using the Herco approach, even though selectivity (and the 

economic contribution) is primarily dependent on the silver content. All models show an appropriate 

degree of correlation with the Herco distributions. Examples from the silver, lead and zinc models inside 

the probability shell domain are shown in Figures 14-10, 14-11 and 14-12, respectively.

14.11.3 Comparison of Interpolation Methods 

For comparison purposes, additional grade models were generated using both the inverse distance 

weighted ("ID") and nearest neighbour ("NN") interpolation methods (Note: The NN model was created 

using data composited to five metre intervals).  The results of these models are compared to the OK 

models at a series of cut-off grades in a series of grade/tonnage graphs.  Examples of blocks inside the 

probability shell are shown in Figures 14-13, 14-14 and 14-15. Overall, there is very good correlation 

between the models.  Reproduction of the model using different methods tends to increase the 

confidence in the overall resource.

14.11.4 Swath Plots (Drift Analysis) 

A swath plot is a graphical display of the grade distribution derived from a series of bands, or swaths, 

generated in several directions throughout the deposit. Using the swath plot, grade variations from the OK 

model are compared to the distribution derived from the declustered NN grade model. 

On a local scale, the NN model does not provide reliable estimations of grade, but, on a much larger 

scale, it represents an unbiased estimate of the grade distribution based on the underlying data. 

Therefore, if the OK model is unbiased, the grade trends may show local fluctuations on a swath plot, but 

the overall trend should be similar to the NN distribution of grade. 

Swath plots were generated in three orthogonal directions for the distributions of all modeled elements. 

There is very good agreement between all of the models. Examples of the silver, lead and zinc models 

inside the probability shell are shown in Figures 14-16, 14-17 and 14-18. The degree of smoothing in the 

OK model is evident in the peaks and valleys.

14.12 Resource Classification 

The mineral resources for the Chinchillas deposit were classified in accordance with the CIM Definition 

Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM Standing Committee on Reserve 

Definitions, 2014). The classification parameters are defined in relation to the distance to sample data 

and are intended to encompass zones of reasonably continuous mineralization.  

Measured resources are defined as material in which the continuity of mineralization is demonstrated by 

the drilling.  Similarly, Indicated resources are defined as material in which the continuity of mineralization 

can be reasonably assumed by the drilling. At this stage of project evaluation, the current distribution of 

drilling information is insufficient to define resources in the Measured category. Based on statistical 

analysis of drilling information and the level of understanding of the geologic environment, continuity of 

mineralization can be reasonably assumed by drilling spaced at 50 metre intervals. Areas of the deposit 

that consistently meet the criteria were manually outlined with interpreted wireframe domains that are 

used to classify blocks in the model. This approach ensures that the consistency and continuity is 

retained in the distribution of these higher-level resources. There has been a reduction in the amount of 

Indicated resources in the main Mantos area; the previous approach to classification had several patches 

of resources in the Indicated category that were restricted around individual drill holes. This type of 

distribution does not exhibit the desired level of continuity of mineralization required for higher-level 

resources. 

Indicator variograms generated from silver equivalent sample data shows continuity of mineralization at 

the projected base cut-off grade of 40g/t AgEq of over 100 metres in some directions. Based on these 

results, resources are included in the Inferred category if they are within a maximum distance of 75 

metres from a drill hole. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 84 

 

Indicated Resources – Model blocks that are delineated by drilling with holes spaced on a nominal 50 

metre grid pattern.   

Inferred Resources – Model blocks which do not meet the criteria for Indicated resources but are within 

a maximum distance of 75 metre from a drill hole.        

The distribution of resources in the Indicated and Inferred categories is shown in Figure 14-19.

Categories 

14.13 Mineral Resources 

The estimate of mineral resources is restricted within a pit shell that has been generated using technical 

and economic factors that are felt to be appropriate for an operation of this type and location. Many of 

these factors are derived from Silver Standard's nearby Pirquitas Mine.  

Due to the polymetallic nature of the deposit, mineral resources are calculated on a silver-equivalent 

basis using the same parameters as described previously in Section 14.5.4 of this report. Silver 

equivalents (AgEq) are calculated in model blocks, for use in the floating cone algorithm, using the 

contributions of silver, lead and zinc and include adjustments for metallurgical recoveries. There are no 

adjustments for mining losses or dilution. Since this is a resource limiting pit shell, and the fact that 

mineral resources must show reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, an elevated silver 

price of $25 per ounce is used to generate the pit shell. This approach, and the prices used, is similar to 

that used by Silver Standard.   

The following technical and economic parameters were used:  

 Metal prices for Silver Equivalent calculation: silver $19/oz, lead $1/lb, zinc $1/lb 

 Metal price used to generate resource limiting pit shell: silver $25/oz  

 Recoveries: 90% silver equivalent. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 85 

 

 Mining cost: $2.45/t 

 Process cost: $16/t 

 G&A: $8.30/t 

 Pit slope: 45 degrees 

Based on a $19/oz silver price, the base cut-off grade for the resource is estimated to be 45 g/t silver 

equivalent. Mineral resources are listed in Table 14-8. The distribution of mineral resources is shown in 

Figure 14-20.  

There are no known factors related to environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 

marketing, or political issues which could materially affect the mineral resource.

Mineral Resources do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resources are contained 
within a pit shell generated using a silver price of $25/oz. Silver equivalent grades, and the base case 
cut-off grade of 45g/t AgEq, are based on metal prices of $19/oz silver and $1/lb for lead and zinc.  

 

In order to be consistent with previous resource estimates, these are segregated, using the lithologic 

domains, into various types corresponding to the main mineralized zones described in Chapter 7.5.1, as 

shown in Table 14-10.

Mineral Resources do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resources are contained within a 
pit shell generated using a silver price of $25/oz. Silver equivalent grades, and the base case cut-off grade 
of 45g/t AgEq, are based on metal prices of $19/oz silver and $1/lb for lead and zinc.  

 

14.14 Comparison with previous estimate 

The previous resource estimate was generated in October 2014. Table 14-11 compares the previous 

resource estimate with the current one.

resource. 

 

A reduction in the silver grade and increase in zinc grade in the Indicated category is the result of two 

factors; First, recent drilling has resulted in upgrading of a portion of Socavon to the Indicated category. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 88 

 

Second, adjustments in the designation of resources in the Indicated category in the main Mantos area 

has downgraded some deeper and peripheral mineralization to the Inferred category. 

There has been a significant increase in Inferred resources, primarily the result of additional drilling in the 

Socavon area. 

There are several significant changes made in the approach to resource classification and reporting 

parameters as listed below: 

1. Classification of Inferred resources has been increased from a maximum distance of 50 metres 

from drilling to 75 metres. 

2. The classification of Indicated resources has resulted in a somewhat more restricted volume in 

the Mantos area and an addition of Indicated resources in the Socavon area.  

3. The old resource limiting pit shell was based on NSR calculations using $35/oz silver and $2/lb 

lead and zinc prices. The current resource is contained within a pit shell assuming $25/oz silver 

price. 

4. The old resource is tabulated based on equivalent silver grades calculated using $22/oz silver 

and $1/lb lead and zinc. The new resource is based on silver equivalent grades using $19/oz 

silver and $1/lb for lead and zinc. 

5. The old resource uses a 40g/t AgEq cut-off threshold where the new resource uses a 45g/tAgEq 

grade. 

6. While rock type domain names are similar the interpretations have changed the volumes and 

configurations of the different domains making direct comparisons impossible. 

In order to show a more direct comparison of resources, the new model has been subjected to the old 

parameters. The results are presented in Table 14-12 and the resource limiting pit shells are shown in 

Figure 14-21.

those listed in Table 14-8, also indicating that there has been an increase in resources as a result of the 

recently competed drilling program.

19 Market Studies and Contracts 

No marketing studies have been completed at this stage and Golden Arrow has not entered into any 

contracts. 

19.1 Commodity Pricing 

Resources reported in Chapter 14 are summarized using silver equivalent grades calculated using metal 

prices of $19/oz silver and $1/lb for lead and zinc. These commodity price assumptions were developed 

by Golden Arrow using a review of recent comparable peer reports and projected price information and 

were deemed reasonable by the Qualified Person.

20 Environmental Studies, Permitting, and Social or Community Impact 

The majority of this chapter was part of the last Technical Report detailing the updated PEA (Kuchling et 

al., 2015).  Due to the substantial change in resources detailed in this report, the previous report is no 

longer considered current; however most of the information contained in this chapter is still relevant to the 

mineral resource estimate and on-going work at the Project.  Therefore the chapter has been reviewed 

and updated by the Qualified Person to reflect the current status and information relevant to the current 

mineral resource estimate. 

The Company has made considerable efforts in environmental programs and community engagement. 

The following presents a brief summary of the environmental aspects, permitting and social or community 

impacts of the work program to date.   

20.1 Environmental  

20.1.1 Drilling Permit Process 

In Jujuy province drill permits are issued following the completion and acceptance of an Environmental 

Impact Assessment report. The EIA is submitted for review to the Provincial Environmental Management 

Unit, or UGAMP. The UGAMP is a multi-stakeholder group chaired by a technical appointee from the 

Mining Department who recommends approval or rejection of the EIA and related work application to the 

provincial mining authorities. Meetings are held to allow UGAMP members to review the proposed 

materials with members of the Company.   UGAMP representatives reviewing the work applications for 

the Chinchillas Project have included:  

 Local Communities of Santo Domingo, Orosmayo, Liviara 

 Municipal Commissioners of Rinconada and Mina Pirquitas 

 Mining Workers Unions 

 Provincial Department of Water Resources 

 Provincial Department of Mines – Mining Police  

 Provincial Secretary of Environmental Management Provincial College of Geologists 

 Provincial Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Policies 

 Provincial Department of Human Rights  

 National University of Jujuy 

 Chamber Mining Jujuy 

 National Parks Administration 

 Corporation for the Development of Laguna de Pozuelos  

 Provincial Secretary of Public Health 

 Provincial Department of Agriculture and Livestock Control 

 Provincial Department of Industry and Commerce 

 Representatives from Golden Arrow. 

Once the UGAMP process is successfully completed the EIA is accepted and an Environmental Impact 

Declaration ("DIA" for Declaración de Impacto Ambiental in Spanish) is awarded.  These are valid for a 

two-year period, after which they must be renewed in order for drilling to continue.   



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 96 

 

The Chinchillas Project consists of three contiguous properties (minas) as described in Chapter 4. Golden 

Arrow completed the UGAMP process for the Chinchilla mina and received its first DIA in March 2012. 

Following a second UGAMP, this permit was renewed in March 2014 for a further two years. Golden 

Arrow received the first DIA for the Chinchilla I property in July 2013 following a successful UGAMP 

process. Following a second UGAMP, the Chinchilla I permit was renewed in June 2015. Chinchilla II 

property received its first DIA in December 2014.  

 

20.1.2 Surface Monitoring 

In accordance with Argentinean national and provincial legislation, Golden Arrow maintains environmental 

programs that include: Fauna and Flora Monitoring; Archeological, Cultural and Historical Patrimony 

Monitoring; Meteorological Monitoring, and; Surface Water Quality Monitoring Programs.  Field surveys 

have been undertaken in which local residents from Santo Domingo participated and assisted with data 

collection.  

The goal of the Fauna and Flora Monitoring Program is to develop baseline data and to be able to 

evaluate any changes to protected fauna and flora species over time. 

The Archeological, Cultural and Historical Patrimony Monitoring Program is undertaken to identify objects 

and/or areas that have to be protected and preserved from exploration activities due to cultural and 

historical value, in coordination with the Secretary of Culture.   

Weather data are collected via a meteorological station installed by Golden Arrow at the Chinchillas 

Project as part of the Meteorological Monitoring Program.   

The goal of the Surface Water Quality Monitoring Program is to develop baseline data and evaluate the 

quality of hydrological resources. Samples of surface water are collected and analyzed for baseline 

reference.  

20.1.3 Laguna de los Pozuelos 

Situated approximately 25 kilometres northeast of Chinchillas is the "Laguna de los Pozuelos", a National 

Natural Monument protected by the "Administracion de Parques Nacionales" (National Parks 

Administration) as well as a RAMSAR Wetland of International Importance and the core zone of a 

Biosphere Reserve.  It covers a surface of approximately 16,000 hectares and in this area all economic 

activities, including mining, are prohibited.  

Argentina has established 13 Biosphere reserves recognized under UNESCO's Man and Biosphere 

Programme.  "Biosphere reserves are sites established by countries and recognized under UNESCO's 

Man and the Biosphere ("MAB") Programme to promote sustainable development based on local 

community efforts and sound science." (www.unesco.org)  The Pozuelos Biosphere Reserve core zone is 

surrounded by a buffer zone of approximately 380,000 hectares that is administered by the Jujuy multi-

sector organization Corporation for the Development of the Pozuelos Basin  (CODEPO, for Corporación 

para el Desarrollo de la Cuenca de Pozuelos in Spanish).  As shown in Figure 20.1, the Secretaria de 

Minería GIS data indicate that the Chinchillas project is partially located inside the buffer zone, while 

boundaries provided by the Universidad Nacional de Jujuy (UNJU) follow the UNESCO model and divide 

the buffer zone into an outer transition zone and internal buffer zone, with the Chinchillas property located 

outside of both zones.   Although neither are definitive, the Ministry data of the buffer outline is the most 

recent and has been adopted for this report.  In either case, economic activities, including mining and 

exploration, are allowed in these areas, following the UGAMP process described above and the mine 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 97 

 

permitting process described in section 20.2.   Furthermore, consultants Knight Piésold advised the 

Company that in their opinion proper and conscientious development of the Chinchillas deposit can be 

done in accordance with the UNESCO objectives in a manner that will not impact the conservation values 

of the Laguna de Pozuelos.  Knight Piésold does not believe the Reserve buffer zone designation 

represents an impediment to the continued development of the Chinchillas deposit (Kuchling et. al, 2014).

20.1.4 Historic Liabilities 

Some remnants of historic mining activities in the Project area, such as small buildings and historic drilling 

platforms, trenches, tunnels and holes, still exists in the area. All of these liabilities were declared as pre-

existing in the Company's EIA report for the Project. 

20.2 Social & Community Aspects 

In accordance with Argentinean national and provincial legislation, Golden Arrow maintains Information 

and Consulting Programs, and Social Sustainability Programs.   

The aim of the Information and Consulting Program is to establish clear and direct lines of communication 

with local inhabitants and stakeholders such as Aboriginal Communities leaders and Municipal 

Commissioners. 

The goals of the Social Sustainability Program are to contribute to local development of infrastructure and 

to help local inhabitants to develop new skills and potential commercial activities that can support mining 

activities development in the area. 

Golden Arrow has been working closely with local authorities and communities since 2011. The area of 

influence of the Project includes the communities of Santo Domingo, Liviara, and Orosmayo. In general, 

the communities are engaged in rural activities and their settlement patterns and spatial dispersion is 

associated with pastoral activity. Golden Arrow has designed and implemented a Community Relations 

Plan for long-term cooperation with the local communities. At this early stage of work the communities of 

Liviara and Orosmayo have been consulted and informed about the Company's works and plans, but the 

immediate area of the Chinchillas Project is part of the Santo Domingo community and this community 

has participated most actively in the Project plans and works.   

Golden Arrow regularly participates in community assemblies to discuss hiring personnel, benefits and 

other improvements to the community.  

In addition, Golden Arrow has established access agreements with local landowners in the Chinchillas 

Project area. 

20.3 Mine Permitting 

Golden Arrow has reviewed the process for mine permitting in order to facilitate the timely completion of 

the process once a positive feasibility study for the project is completed.   

The legal framework for mine permitting is derived mainly from the second section of the Mining Code of 

Argentina and its supporting National Law No. 24.585. The institutional framework for the permitting 

process is driven by stipulations in Law No. 24.585, with technical Support of UGAMP and the National 

Mining Secretariat who is advised in turn by the National Unit of Environmental Management (UGAN for 

La Unidad de Gestión Ambiental Nacional in Spanish).  

The main focus of permitting is the detailed EIA, which must be submitted prior to commencement of 

operations. Upon successful review of the EIA and a UGAMP process similar to that described in section 

20.1, authorities issue the DIA.  Annex III of Law 24.585 establishes the minimum contents of the EIA, 

which must include: 

 Description of the Environment (physical, biological, and socio-economic) 

 Project Description 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 99 

 

 Description of Environmental Impacts 

 Environmental Management Plan (which includes measures and actions to prevent and mitigate 

environmental impact) 

 Plan of Action on Environmental Contingencies, and 

 Methodology Used. 

20.4 Mine Closure 

There is no current mine closure plan as there is no current applicable mine plan.

23 Adjacent Properties 

Silver Standard Resources Inc´s Pirquitas silver-zinc mine is located approximately 30 kilometres to the 

southwest of the Chinchillas Project in Jujuy province. Pirquitas' 2014 mineral resources and reserves 

summary includes proven and probable reserves of 40.8 million ounces of silver
1
. As outlined in Section 

8, Pirquitas and Chinchillas share some geologic characteristics. The host rocks and mineralization in the 

Mantos and Socovon Basement zones at Chinchillas are similar in style to the Pirquitas deposit 

mineralization.  As such, the Pirquitas deposit provides an important exploration model for the Chinchillas 

Project.  

Glencore Xstrata's Aguilar silver, lead, zinc mine is located 90 kilometres southeast of Chinchillas within 

the same province of Jujuy. Glencore published 2014 proven and probable reserves of 3.4Mt at 4.9% 

zinc, 5.6% lead and 120 g/t silver
2
. Aguilar has been in almost constant production for 80 years. Lead 

concentrates produced from the mine are treated in Aguilar's smelter in Palpala, Jujuy and the zinc 

concentrate is treated at the AR Zinc smelter, located in Santa Fe province, in central Argentina. Although 

the Aguilar deposit has different geology (mineralization is hosted in a skarn re-mobilized sedex 

environment) the mine gives important indications of logistics and economic costs of mining in Jujuy and 

Argentina, as well as examples of potential alternative ore processing in Argentina. 

Properties directly adjacent to the Chinchillas Project include: mina 543-M-2006 to the south, cateo 855-

S-2007 to the west, mina 1943-V-13 to the northwest, mina 1784-M-2012 to the north-northwest, mina 

1497-M-2010 to the north, mina 1644-R-2011 to the northeast, and cateo 854-S-2007 to the east. Mineral 

deposits of real or potential economic significance are not known to exist on these properties.  

Mr. Bruce Smith has visited Pirquitas and Aguilar mines to compare the geology with Chinchillas. 

Resource and Reserve information for Pirquitas and Aguilar deposits has been obtained from Silver 

Standard´s and Glencore's public data on their respective websites. This information was not considered 

during the resource estimation and is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization at the Chinchillas 

Project.

25 Interpretations and Conclusions 

All exploration data, methods and resource estimates detailed in this report were completed to be 

compliant with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 as set forth in CIM Definition Standards for Mineral 

Resources and Mineral Reserves, (CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions, 2014).  

The Phase IV drill program completed by the Company from November 2014 to July 2015 was designed 

to follow the recommendations from the updated PEA study (Kuchling et al., 2015), which included 

11,000 metres of drilling to define the limits of the deposit and convert Inferred resources to the Measured 

and Indicated classifications, as well as 5,000 metres of condemnation, metallurgical, geotechnical and 

hydrogeological drilling, in order to prepare the project for a pre-feasibility or feasibility study.  However 

the results obtained as the Phase IV drill program progressed indicated that new mineralization was being 

encountered around and below the deposit, and the limits of the deposit were not reached in all areas 

despite the completion of over 11,000 metres of drilling.  It was decided to postpone the remaining 5,000 

metre condemnation metallurgical and geotechnical program until after the completion of a new resource 

estimate and a re-evaluation of program requirements.   Results from the drilling resulted in a substantial 

increase in resources but not an upgrade of a significant portion to higher categories, as was originally 

planned.  

The authors conclude that: 

 There is a good understanding of the geology and mineralization of the deposit.  

 Exploration drilling, sampling, sample preparation, assaying, specific gravity measurements and 

drill hole surveys have been carried out in accordance with industry standard best practices and 

are suitable to support resource estimates. Sampling and assaying include appropriate quality 

assurance and control procedures. 

 The resource model developed for the Chinchillas deposit uses accepted modeling and grade 

estimation methods. The model is a reasonable reflection of deposit geology. 

 The estimated Indicated resource using a cut-off grade of 45 g/t of equivalent silver is 25.9 Mt 

with grades of 77.2 g/t silver, 0.66% lead, and 0.66% zinc. A further Inferred resource of 47.1 Mt 

with grades of 50.2 g/t silver, 0.52% lead, and 0.64% zinc has been estimated using the same 

cut-off grade. 

 Metallurgical studies, including locked-cycle tests, have been completed on representative 

samples. The results indicate that the recovery of silver, lead, and zinc is likely to be very good. 

Additional metallurgical testing will be required to confirm the optimum processing for all 

mineralization types.   

 Based on conclusions in the previous PEA (Kuchling, 2015), the expanded resource estimate in 

this report warrants updating the economic study of the Chinchillas deposit. 

 Upgrading of the resource categories will be required to further advance the project to feasibility. 

 Potential remains to expand the current resource, and to define new resources on the property.

26 Recommendations 

The Phase IV exploration drill program and re-estimation of resources for the deposit has added 

significantly to the resource base.    A new economic study is required to evaluate the impact of these 

new resources and the current economic and market conditions on the project design and viability. A 

detailed evaluation such as Feasibility Study ("FS") or Pre-Feasibility Study ("PFS"), will require 

converting Inferred resources to the Measured and/or Indicated classification through an in-fill drill 

program.   

The following activities are recommended to advance the Chinchillas Project:  

 Update the existing PEA based on the results of the Phase IV exploration program  

 Initiate Feasibility Study or Pre-Feasibility Study.  In preparation for that study, the following is 

recommended: 

o A further 10,000 metres of infill drilling to convert Inferred resources to the Indicated 

classification.   The estimated budget is $3M. 

o 5,000 metres of condemnation, metallurgical, geotechnical and hydrogeological drilling. 

The estimated cost is $1.5M 

o Continue with metallurgical testing.  The estimated cost $0.3M. 

o Golden Arrow should continue with its social and environmental programs 

o Initiation of the mine permitting process.   

A detailed plan and budget for a PFS or FS is recommended once the above work programs are 

complete.
