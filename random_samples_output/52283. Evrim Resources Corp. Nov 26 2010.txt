                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

1.0  SUMMARY 

 

Evrim Metals Corporation ("Evrim"), a Vancouver, British Columbia-based 

natural resources company, has entered into an agreement with Kiska Metals 

Corporation ("Kiska") (TSX.V: KSK) to acquire the rights to Kiska's La Noria 

exploration project, located in a metallogenically important region of Mexico. The 

La Noria project includes two contiguous mineral concessions totalling 18,453 

hectares. Kennecott Exploration Company ("Kennecott") through its Mexican 

subsidiary holds a 2% net smelter return royalty on the property. The property 

surrounds but does not include the Azulitas NI43-101 compliant resource of 5.6 Mt 

@ 0.9% Cu equivalent (Ghayem et al., 2008).  

La Noria is located in central Sinaloa State, situated within the foothills of the 

Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains at elevations of between 160 and 250 m a.s.l. 

The project area is located along the western flank of a NNW-trending, Laramide-

age, Cretaceous – Paleocene granitic batholithic zone, which extends through 

Sinaloa and Sonora states, and which hosts major porphyry copper deposits along 

its eastern flanks (e.g., Cananea and La Caridad). The claims are underlain 

predominantly by equigranular intrusive rocks mapped regionally as 

undifferentiated Late Cretaceous granodiorite. Small, medium- to coarse-grained 

and locally porphyritic quartz monzonite intrusive bodies are spatially associated 

with areas of Cu-Mo-Ag mineralization on the La Noria property.   

La Noria represents an early-stage exploration project. The main targets on 

the property are breccia-hosted, disseminated and structurally-controlled, intrusion-

related Cu-Mo-Ag mineralization. Initial work on the property by Kennecott in 

2004/2005, and subsequent work by Geoinformatics Exploration Inc. 

("Geoinformatics") (Geoinformatics merged with Rimfire Minerals Corporation 

(TSX.V: RFM) in 2009 to form Kiska Metals Corporation) between 2006 and 



5 
 

                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

2008, has included stream sediment, soil and rock sampling, hand trenching, 

airborne magnetic and ground IP/resistivity geophysical surveys and the 

completion in 2007/2008 of 12 HQ diamond drill holes totalling 2901.5 m (9519 

feet). This work identified several areas of anomalous Cu, Mo, Ag ± Pb, Zn and 

Au geochemistry in soil, rock and stream sediment samples, as well as areas of Cu-

Mo-Ag mineralization in outcrop and in drill core. Work to date has focused on 

five areas of interest, including Los Laureles (and its SE extension, "East 

Breccia"), El Zapote, El Tiro, El Naranjo and El Cobrozo. Of these, Los Laureles 

is the most advanced. Here, Cu-Mo-Ag mineralization is hosted within quartz-

tourmaline-magnetite-sulphide matrix breccia which is exposed discontinuously 

within an ~ 1100 x 100-800 m, NW-trending zone of elevated Cu-Mo±Au in soils. 

Five drill holes totalling 1276.7 metres (4189 ft) completed at Los Laureles 

intersected mineralized intervals including 44 m @ 0.53% Cu, 0.12% Mo and 8.3 

g/t Ag (DDLL-08-05) and 70.2 m @ 0.13% Cu, 0.16% Mo and 15.8 g/t Ag 

(DDLL-07-03). Mineralization encountered in drilling at Los Laureles remains 

open at depth and along strike.  

Within the El Naranjo area, six drill holes totalling 1424.5 m (4673 feet) 

tested a ~ 1600 x 100 - 300 m, ENE-trending zone of elevated Cu±(Mo, Au, As, 

Ag) in soil, rock and stream sediment samples. Broad areas of elevated Cu and Ag 

were encountered in this drilling, e.g., 52 m @ 0.15% Cu and 3.7 g/t Ag (DDEN-

07-04). A single, 200 m-long drill hole completed adjacent to the Azulitas property 

in the western claim area intersected elevated Cu ± Mo.           

Exploration work completed by Kennecott and Geoinformatics between 2005 

and early 2008 on the La Noria concession, including all aspects of the collection, 

handling and assaying of soil, stream sediment, rock and core samples met or 

exceeded industry best practices according to technical reports by SRK (Ham, 

2006; Ghayem et al., 2008). All sample anayses have been completed by ALS 



6 
 

                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

Chemex, North Vancouver, British Columbia, an internationally accredited (ISO 

17025:2005) analytical laboratory. Preparation of samples collected by 

Geoinformatics was completed at the ALS Chemex preparation facility in 

Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, prior to shipment of pulps to Canada. Samples were 

analyzed for Au by fire assay-atomic absorption and for a suite of 33 elements by 

four-acid digestion and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.  

Quality control measures implemented by Kennecott at La Noria exceeded 

industry best practices (Ham, 2006). Geoinformatics implemented quality control 

procedures similar to those developed by Kennecott (Ghayem et al., 2008). 

External and internal quality control data collected between 2005 and early 2008 

on the property were analyzed by SRK (Ghayem et al., 2008) who concluded that 

assay data produced by ALS Chemex were generally reliable. QA/QC reports 

pertaining to 2008 data from the La Noria property similarly suggest that analytical 

data (Cu, Au) are reliable and accurate.  

Exploration work completed to date on the property has identified areas of 

potential economic interest. Further work is warranted and recommended. A 

program would consist of geological mapping and prospecting of the El Zapote

and El Tiro soil anomalies, including trenching of anomalous zones of existing

soil geochemistry is proposed. Further work would focus on the Los Laureles

breccia including detailed mapping and sampling within the Los Laureles and East

Breccia zones and the completion of Induced Polarization (IP) and ground magnetics

surveys over the entire system including the East Breccia. Diamond drilling would

consist of follow up along strike and down dip of successful 2008 drilling results on

the western portion of the Los Laureles breccia and diamond drill testing of targets

delineated over the eastern portion of the Los Laureles breccia zone. The estimated

budget to complete the first phase work is $701,944 USD.

2.0  INTRODUCTION  

 

At the request of Paddy Nicol, President and Chief Executive Officer of 

Evrim Metals Corporation, a private corporation registered in British Columbia 

with its Registered Office at Suite 600, 850 West Pender Street in Vancouver, the 

author has been retained to provide a Technical Report describing the La Noria 

exploration project located in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, for the purpose of 

listing the Company on the Canadian Natural Resources Limited Exchange and to 

satisfy the requirements of the British Columbia Securities Commission and 

National Instrument 43-101. Evrim has entered into an agreement with Kiska 

Metals Corporation to acquire the rights to the La Noria project. Kiska formed in 

2009 through the merger of Rimfire Minerals Corp. and Geoinformatics 

Exploration Inc. Geoinformatics acquired the rights to the La Noria project in 2006 

from the Mexican subsidiary of Kennecott Exploration Company, who retain a 2% 

net smelter return royalty on the property.  

The subject property includes two contiguous claims situated along the 

western flank of a NNW-trending, Cretaceous-Paleocene granitic batholithic zone 

that extends north from Sinaloa through Sonora, forming part of the Laramide 

orogeny (Gastil et al., 1992). The mineral potential in the area is for magmatic-

hydrothermal Cu-Mo-Ag and potentially Au mineralization. This report provides a 

summary of all technical and scientific information regarding the La Noria mineral 

project held by Kiska Metals Corporation, the plans of operation for the project, as 

well as an opinion of the exploration potential and recommendations for further 

work.   

Technical information presented in this report is a summary from published 

and unpublished technical data, including corporate presentations, technical reports 

and other data made available by Kiska to the author, of data collected during a site

visit by the author to the project, and of information obtained through discussions 

with Kiska personnel. The author has no reason to doubt the reliability of the 

information provided by Kiska. All references cited are listed in Section 21.0 of 

this report. 

A personal visit was made by the author to the La Noria project during May 

19th – 22nd, 2010. The visit comprised evaluation of the main areas of geological 

interest and a review of the work completed by Kiska (Geoinformatics) personnel 

at these sites, including review of drill core from a sub-set of holes and a partial 

review of other field work, including mapping, sampling and trenching. The author 

was accompanied during the property visit by Kiska project manager and geologist 

Rene Romero. The purpose of the site visit was to evaluate the mineral potential on 

the property and to assess the extent and quality of work completed to date by 

Kiska (Geoinformatics).

4.0  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

 

The La Noria Cu-Mo-Ag property, the subject of this report, is located 

approximately 60 km northeast of the city of Mazatlán, in south-central Sinaloa 

State, Mexico (Fig. 1). Mazatlan is a commercial centre, port and tourist 

destination, with an international airport. The property, centred at 106° 70' West 

Longitude and 23° 35' North Latitude, consists of 2 contiguous mining concessions 

totalling 18,453.20 hectares (~ 184 km2) (Fig. 2; Table 1). The boundaries of the 

La Noria and El Tiro concessions have been legally surveyed in accordance with 

Mexican government requirements. There are currently twenty-one smaller mining 

lots within the La Noria mining concession covering an area of 24.39 km2 which 

do not form part of the La Noria project (stippled areas, Fig. 2). These claims host 

the Azulitas NI43-101 compliant mineral resource of 5.6 Mt @ 0.9% Cu 

equivalent (Ghayem et al., 2008).  

The La Noria and El Tiro concessions are 100% owned by Kiska Metals 

Corporation ("Kiska") (TSX.V: KSK) through its wholly owned Mexican 

subsidiary Minera Geoinformatica S.A. de C.V. (Table 1), with Kennecott 

Exploration Company ("Kennecott") through its Mexican subsidiary, Minera 

Kennecott S.A. de C.V., holding a 2% net smelter return royalty on the La Noria 

and El Tiro claims. The property (excluding the El Tiro concession, which was 

granted in 2009) was originally acquired by Geoinformatics Exploration Inc. 

("Geoinformatics") in May, 2006 as part of a strategic alliance with Kennecott. In 

August, 2009 Geoinformatics merged with Rimfire Minerals Corporation (TSX.V: 

RFM) forming Kiska Metals Corporation.

 Evrim Metals Corporation ("Evrim") has entered into an agreement with 

Kiska Metals Corporation to acquire the rights to ten projects in Mexico including 

the La Noria project. The terms of the agreement between Evrim and Kiska are 

based on an initial share payment and performance based shares and/or cash 

payments. The initial purchase price for the Mexico assets and a proprietary dataset 

is $1,000,000 paid in 2,000,000 common shares of Evrim. The performance shares 

or cash payments, as they apply to the La Noria project, include 10,000 common 

shares per year every September 17th until 2015, or, in the event that Evrim 

successfully options, joint ventures, or negotiates an earn in agreement with a third 

party, Evrim will pay 50,000 shares for every year of the third party agreement, 

until September 17th, 2015.  In the event of a sale of at least 51% interest in La 

Noria, or the exercise of an option or earn in to acquire 51% interest in to the 

project, Evrim will issue 250,000 shares, or can elect to pay $250,000.  In the event 

of a positive decision to put a deposit on La Noria into development based on a 

positive feasibility study, Evrim will issue an additional 1,000,000 common shares 

to Kiska. 

 Surface rights do not form part of the ownership and separate agreements 

with local landowners are required to conduct exploration work including drilling 

and road building on the property.     

Several areas of mineralization have been identified within the La Noria and 

El Tiro concessions during multiple early-stage exploration campaigns through 



12 
 

                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

prospecting, geophysical surveys, soil, rock and stream sediment sampling and 

diamond drilling. The main areas of interest defined to date on the project include 

the Los Laureles, El Tiro, El Naranjo, El Zapote and El Cobrozo targets (Fig. 2). 

Of these, the most advanced is Los Laureles which consists of a > 500 m long, 

NW-trending, structurally-controlled tourmaline-quartz matrix intrusive breccia, 

which cuts granodiorite and quartz monzonite characterized by equigranular to, 

locally, sub-porphyritic to porphyritic textures.  

Kiska informed the author that exploration work carried out on the property 

discussed herein, including sampling, drilling, geophysics, trenching and access 

road construction related to drilling, was completed in accordance with regulations 

related to exploration activities in the state of Sinaloa. Permits to perform work 

such as drilling and road building in Mexico require environmental and 

archaeological studies and written agreements with local land holders. This 

documentation is submitted to the Secretaria de Medio Ambiente del Gobierno as 

part of the application process for a final work permit. Such permits have been 

obtained by Kiska for work in the Los Laureles, El Naranjo and El Zapote areas. 

Permits have not been solicited to date for the El Tiro nor El Cobrozo areas.  

The Presidio River transects the La Noria claim and in 2008 a dam was 

completed 13 km downstream of the property. This project is not expected to have 

an impact on any future exploration work on the property.  

Taxes are payable every 6 months to maintain the claims in good standing. 

Currently, the annual property tax payments total $CDN 39,743.66.  In addition, 

there are annual work expenditures that must be met which are based on fixed rates 

associated with the size and age of each claim. Excess work expenditures can be 

forwarded indefinitely and the La Noria concession presently has a large surplus 

and does not require work related expenditures for several years.  The El Tiro 

claim requires approximately $25,500 ($US) in expenditures during 2010.

5.0  ACCESS, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFASTRUCTURE AND 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

The property is situated in hilly to moderately rugged terrain in the foothills 

of the Sierra Madre Mountains within the Rio Presidio watershed. Elevations on 

the property range between ~ 160 and 250 m a.s.l. The property area is 

characterized by a semi-tropical climate with a short wet season extending from 

mid-June to mid-September and a longer dry season throughout the remainder of 

the year. The weather during the property visit (May) was characterized by hot 

sunny days with moderate humidity and temperatures in the mid- to high- 30s to 

low-40s. Vegetation consists mainly of mesquite, thorny bushes and shrubs, with 

deciduous trees and cacti.  

The property is accessed via paved highway 15 north from Mazatlán ~ 10 km 

to the town of Habal, then ~ 23 km NE along paved and well-maintained 2-wheel 

drive dirt roads to the town of La Noria and a further ~ 19 km to the village of El 

Placer within the property limits where Kiska maintains a core storage and logging 

facility. Within the property a network of unpaved good condition roads and foot 

and animal trails provides reasonable access to most parts of the property. Dense 

thorny under bush impedes access by foot to some areas. The property can be 

worked year round, however during the rainy season road and foot access to some 

areas would be hampered by high river levels and thick foliage.  

Surface ownership in the area is held by several individual owners. During 

past work programs, contracts allowing access and work on private land have been 

entered into on an individual basis as needed.  

Few supplies are available in the small neighboring communities and the 

main supply centre for the project is Mazatlán. The new dam along Rio Presidio 13 

km downstream of the property will supply water for irrigation and industry. 



14 
 

                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

Power lines service a number of small villages that are located within the project 

area. No permanent exploration camp has been constructed on site and during past 

programs Kiska (Geoinformatics) personnel have travelled daily to and from 

Mazatlán. A rented house in the village of El Placer serves as core storage and 

logging facility. The most important local resource is the availability of an able and 

willing work force. The local economy based mainly on subsistence farming is 

associated with low employment levels during much of the year.  

 

6.0  HISTORY  
 

The property history described herein prior to Geoinformatics involvement is 

taken in large part from Ham (2006). The details of subsequent work programs are 

summarized in large part from unpublished Kiska corporate reports and data and 

from discussions with Kiska personnel.  

Little information is available on the history of exploration of the La Noria 

claims prior to the work by Kennecott. There are minor workings on the property 

near the Las Minas area by local farmers and residents, which have primarily been 

for gold mineralization. Some panning of gold in the local creeks near the Las 

Minas prospect by the local community has also been reported to the Kennecott 

exploration staff (Ham, 2006). These areas were not visited by the author during 

the property evaluation. In the 1960's, the concession was held by the Guggenheim 

Consortium, an American investment group focused on base-metal exploration, 

extraction and processing in NW Mexico and elsewhere (www.funding 

universe.com/company-history/Grupo-Mexico-SA-de-CV-Company-

History.html). The Guggenheim group identified several areas of mineralization on 

the property and undertook a nine-hole drill campaign in 1965 targeting the 

Azulitas prospect (Fig. 2), which reportedly returned positive results (Ham, 2006). 



15 
 

                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

However no data or drill core is available from this program and thus this work 

cannot be validated and therefore is not considered further here.  

Minera Kennecott S.A. de C.V., a Mexican subsidiary of Kennecott, took 

possession of the property in May 2004 and undertook a preliminary exploration 

program which included soil, stream and rock chip sampling, an airborne magnetic 

geophysical survey completed over the entire La Noria concession and internal 

claims, minor bulldozer trenching, geological mapping and a follow-up twelve-

hole (2,444 m) HQ drill program in 2005 (Ham, 2006). This work was mainly 

conducted within the Azulitas and neighboring Las Minas and La Verde properties, 

which do not form part of the current La Noria concession held by Kiska. Minor 

soil, rock and stream-sediment sampling was conducted on the La Noria 

concession during this program (Ham, 2006). Drilling by Kennecott included six 

holes drilled into the Azulitas prospect, four holes completed at the Las Minas 

prospect, ~ 1.5 km WSW of Azulitas, and two holes investigating other targets in 

the Azulitas-Las Minas area. None of these holes lie within the current property. 

Mineralization encountered in this drilling included 165.8 m at 0.76% Cu, 0.03% 

Mo, 0.1 g/t Au and 14.4 g/t Ag in drill hole DDLN05-03 (Ham, 2006).  

In the second half of 2005 Kennecott undertook a regional sampling program, 

which encompassed much of the La Noria claim (Ham, 2006), during which 199 

stream sediment samples were collected. This stream sediment sampling program 

identified nine areas of interest defined by elevated Cu and/or Au, Mo, Pb and Zn 

contents in stream sediment samples. Areas identified within the La Noria 

concession include the El Zapote, Los Laureles, El Naranjo and El Cobrozo targets 

(Fig. 2). Follow-up work carried out by Kennecott in the same year included soil 

and rock chip sampling at El Naranjo and rock chip sampling at El Zapote. Soil 

sampling along widely-spaced, N-S oriented grid lines at El Naranjo delineated a 

2.0 x 0.4 km, NE-trending zone of >300 ppm Cu in soils (elevated Cu contents in 



16 
 

                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

soils ranged from 296 to 990 ppm: Ham, 2006). Rock samples from this area 

contained between 111 and 1385 ppm Cu. Preliminary mapping in the El Naranjo 

area by Kennecott identified a NE-trending sericitic alteration zone corresponding 

with the area of elevated Cu in soils (Ham, 2006, and references therein). A limited 

number of rock chip samples were collected in the El Zapote area but failed to 

return results of economic interest.  

Kennecott decided late in 2005 that the results of the drilling and related work 

did not meet its corporate investment criteria and the property was transferred to 

Geoinformatics at this time (Ham, 2006). 

Since acquiring the property in late 2005, Kiska (work performed as 

Geoinformatics) preformed property-wide exploration including soil-sampling 

surveys, induced polarization (IP) ground geophysics over select areas, hand 

trenching, preliminary geological mapping of limited extent, access road 

construction and HQ-diameter diamond drilling. In 2006, Kiska (Geoinformatics) 

drilled 11 diamond drill holes (2039 m) on the Azulitas property which does not 

form part of the current holdings (Ghayem et al., 2008).  An additional 17 holes 

(3941 m) were completed in 2007 (Ghayem et al., 2008) and 4 holes (1475 m) in 

2008. Of the 2007/2008 drilling, 12 holes totalling 2901.5 m (9519 feet) were 

completed within the La Noria concession currently held by Kiska and reported on 

here (Ghayem et al., 2008 and unpublished data provided by Kiska). Five of these 

holes were drilled at the Los Laureles prospect, six at the El Naranjo prospect and 

one drill hole was completed ~ 100 metres east of the Las Minas II claim on the La 

Noria concession in the Azulitas area. In 2008 and 2009 Kiska (Geoinformatics) 

did not renew their option agreements on the La Verde, Las Minas, El Cascabel 

and Azulitas claims (the Azulitas, Las Minas and contiguous properties internal to 

the La Noria concession). In 2009 the El Tiro concession was granted. Current 

holdings of Kiska include the La Noria and El Tiro concessions (Fig. 2).

7.0  GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 

7.1 Regional Geology 

 

 (Extracted from Ham, 2006) 

 

The La Noria 

property is located on 

the western flank of a 

NNW-trending 

Cretaceous – Paleocene 

granitic batholithic zone 

that extends through 

Sinaloa and Sonora 

states. Laramide 

porphyry copper 

deposits are associated 

with the eastern flanks 

of this batholithic zone 

in Sonora (e.g., Cananea 

and La Caridad; Fig. 3). 

Porphyry copper deposits 

extend into the south-

western USA (Arizona, New Mexico) and lie within the magmatic arc terrain of 

the western USA (Fig. 4; Hildebrand et al., 2000). The Laramide orogeny involved 

ENE- to WSW-directed shortening during the Late Cretaceous to early Eocene 

(i.e., between ~80-40 Ma "million years ago") that gave rise to the Rocky 

Mountain fold and thrust belt in Canada, the Laramide block uplifts in the USA 

and development of the Sierra Oriental fold and thrust belt in Mexico (Coney and 

Reynolds, 1977; Bird, 2002). The magmatic arc was relatively stationary on the 

western side of Baja California from about 120-105 Ma but slowly migrated to 

Sonora at about 90 Ma. From ~ 80 Ma, the subducting plate (Farallon plate) 

shallowed (Coney and Reynolds, 1977) leading to arc migration eastward. As a 

result, widespread magmatism shifted rapidly to the east, which resulted in a shift 

of calc-alkaline to progressively more alkaline rocks in the east (Damon et al, 

1983; Valencia-Moreno et al., 2003). Numerous mineral deposits are related to this 

magmatism in the USA (southern New Mexico, Arizona) and Mexico (such as La 

Caridad dated ~55 Ma, Valencia et al., 2005; Staude & Barton, 2001). Progressive 

southwest retreat and steepening of the subducting plate began about 50 Ma 

resulting in uplift of the North American plate (Bird, 2002). From about ~40-20 

Ma calc-alkaline magmatism dominated much of central and western Mexico. This 

stage marks the beginning of orogenic collapse/slab roll back in north western 

Mexico and core complex formation with northeast-southwest directed extension 

(Bird, 2002). From about 20 Ma, local stress fields were dominated by the 

northwest movement of the Pacific plate resulting in predominantly dextral shear 

along the orogenic margin.  

The significance of the Laramide orogeny and younger plate movement is that 

the orientation of the major structures across both the southwestern United States 

and western Mexico are dominated by NW-SE- and NE-SW - trending structures. 

The distribution of porphyry copper (±Mo, ±Au) centres within Mexico and

                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

contiguous USA has a strong northwest trend (following the overall trend of the 

arc) (Figs. 3 and 4) and mineralization is related to magmatism associated with the 

Laramide orogeny (Staude & Barton, 2001). From northern Mexico to west-central 

Arizona, a 650 

km-long belt of 

copper bearing 

plutons coincides 

with NW-trending 

structures that are 

intersected by NE-

trending structures 

(Hildenbrand et 

al., 2000). Within 

this copper belt 

mineralization is 

hosted by plutons 

that are on or 

adjacent to major 

NW- and NE-

striking faults 

(Hildenbrand et 

al., 2000).

7.2  Property Geology   

 

(Extracted in part from Ham, 2006) 

 

The geological setting within the La Noria and El Tiro concessions was first 

documented by Secretaría de Economía, Carta Geológico-Minera La Noria F13-

A26 (1983) and La Ciudad F13-A27 (1983) and parts of the property have 

subsequently been described by Ham (2006) and Ghayem et al. (2008, and 

references therein). The La Noria concession is located on the western margin of a 

Cretaceous – Paleocene granitic batholith which intrudes Cretaceous and Paleozoic 

metamorphosed sedimentary rocks (Fig. 5). This rock package was uplifted and is 

overlain by late Paleogene and Neogene volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Regional 

scale NW- and NE-striking normal faults, interpreted as reactivated Cretaceous 

structures that developed during the Laramide orogeny, and lineaments interpreted 

remotely occur in the area of the claims (Fig. 5), suggesting that the geological and 

structural setting of the property is similar to other areas of the Laramides. 

Outcrop on the property is mainly limited to creeks, hill tops and road cuts, 

however is of sufficient abundance to provide a general picture of the geological 

setting. The property is underlain predominantly by intrusive rocks, mapped 

regionally as undifferentiated Late Cretaceous granodiorite (Fig. 5). Permo-

Carboniferous metasedimentary strata underlie the south-central part of the claims, 

while Early Cretaceous, intermediate composition, metavolcanic rocks are 

documented in the north-western corner of the property. Field observations (this 

study; see also Ham, 2006: Azulitas area) indicate that medium-grained, 

intermediate composition intrusions underlie most of the property and that minor, 

intermediate to felsic composition, fine- and coarse-grained and porphyritic, 

probable calc-alkaline intrusions also occur on the claims. The main rock types are  



21

                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

granodiorite, monzonite to quartz monzonite and granite. Distinctly porphyritic 

quartz monzonite, characterized by the presence of feldspar phenocrysts up to ~ 1 

cm in length, occurs at the Los Laureles prospect, and quartz-eye porphyry sub-

crop was noted at one location in the El Zapote area. Compositional and textural 

variations amongst the intrusive suite may represent multiple intrusive events.   

Most intrusive rocks noted on the property vary from fresh to weakly altered 

and weathered, however areas of strong alteration were observed locally, and a 

deeply weathered (i.e., >30 m) profile encountered in drill hole DDLL08-05 at the 

Los Laureles prospect appears to reflect a remnant supergene zone of unknown age 

and extent.   

The distribution of hydrothermal alteration and mineralization on the property 

suggests that structural controls were probably important during hydrothermal 

activity and related mineral deposition. A prominent NNW-trending normal fault 

passes ~ 5 km west of the property, which divides Cenozoic volcanic deposits to 

the west from Cretaceous intrusive rocks. The latest movement along this structure 

presumably post-dates the hydrothermal activity documented on the claims. Less 

prominent NE- and NW-trending faults and circular structures of unknown age 

have been interpreted within the claims (Fig. 5). Ham (2006, and references 

therein) interpret the main structural trends on the project as NE, ENE, EW. A few 

joints and quartz veinlets measured during the property visit were found to strike 

NW and N. At the El Naranjo prospect, the main area of anomalous geochemistry 

trends ~ ENE. The WNW – ESE (~ 100°) alignment of alteration at the El Tiro 

prospect (evident as a series of small topographic highs which correspond with 

zones of oxidation and silicification) and the overall NW- to WNW-trend of the 

mineralized zone and adjacent west-dipping fault interpreted at the Los Laureles 

prospect, suggest that WNW- to NW-oriented structures may have been important 



23 
 

                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

to mineralization. A WNW-trending, moderately west-dipping syn-mineral fault 

has also been documented at the Las Minas prospect (Ham, 2006: Fig. 13).   

 

8.0  DEPOSIT TYPES 

 

Preliminary investigations by Kennecott and Kiska (Geoinformatics) suggest 

that the La Noria property is most prospective for discovery of structurally-

controlled, breccia- and fracture-related Cu-Mo-Ag mineralization, possibly of 

porphyry-related Cu (±Mo) magmatic-hydrothermal affinity. The intrusive 

environment and inferred Late Cretaceous age of intrusive rocks at La Noria (i.e., 

Laramide age; associated with Cu±Mo porphyry and skarn deposits in 

northwestern Mexico and southwestern USA; Staude and Barton, 2001) and the 

occurrence of alteration and mineralization characteristic of porphyry Cu-Mo 

systems (e.g., Seedorff et al., 2005) lends support to this interpretation. A number 

of anomalous Au values in samples collected on the property (e.g., Ham, 2006) and 

reported on adjacent claims (Strickland, 2008) suggest that the La Noria property 

may also be prospective for discovery of vein-related and structurally-controlled 

Au mineralization.   

 

9.0  MINERALIZATION 

 

The La Noria property currently contains five main areas of interest at 

different stages of early exploration. Historically, work in the area has focused on 

the Azulitas property and surrounding prospects (e.g., Ghayem et al., 2008) which 

do not lie within the current La Noria property. Nevertheless, mineralization at 

Azulitas is well documented and shares some characteristics with that recognized 

on the claims, and therefore a brief review of Azulitas, taken from Ham (2006), is 



24 
 

                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

provided here. Azulitas comprises Cu-Mo-Ag±(Au)±(Pb,Zn) mineralization 

associated with chalcopyrite, pyrite, molybdenite, minor bornite, sphalerite and 

galena hosted within a zone of variably fractured and altered quartz monzonite. 

Locally, minor clast-supported breccias are developed. Alteration associated with 

mineralization at Azulitas includes a potassic assemblage of biotite + magnetite ± 

K-feldspar ± quartz. Biotite is progressively replaced by chlorite ± actinolite to 

more distal zones where biotite is completely replaced by chlorite (propylitic 

zone). Early potassic alteration is overprinted by sericite-chlorite-quartz 

(intermediate argillic) to sericite-quartz-pyrite (phyllic) alteration assemblages. 

Tourmaline rosettes occur within and adjacent to quartz veins and brecciated clasts 

and are typically associated with the youngest fractures.    

Mineralization identified to date on the La Noria concession includes 

intrusive-hosted, structurally-controlled, fracture- and breccia-related Cu-Mo-Ag 

mineralization. The main sulphides noted include pyrite, chalcopyrite, molybdenite 

and minor bornite. Secondary copper minerals are common in some areas. 

Alteration types recognized on the property include potassic (noted during the 

property visit as K-feldspar replacing breccia fragments and host intrusive rocks at 

Los Laureles), quartz-sericite ("phyllic"), quartz flooding ± magnetite, argillic and 

chloritic±epidote ("propylitic"). Magnetite occurs in association with tourmaline-

quartz breccias and siliceous alteration zones at Los Laureles and has been noted in 

association with potassic alteration at the Azulitas occurrence (Ham, 2006). 

Primary magnetite appears to have been largely destroyed in intrusive rocks within 

areas of hydrothermal activity, as suggested by the lack of magnetism in 

moderately to strongly altered rocks on the property. Although exposure is limited 

in many areas of the property, much of the property appears to be underlain by 

relatively fresh or weakly altered intrusive rocks.

9.1  Los Laureles 

 

Los Laureles is the most advanced of the five exploration targets defined to 

date on the property. The area was first identified by Kennecott in 2005 on the 



26 
 

                     La Noria Cu‐Mo‐Ag project, Sinaloa Mexico 

basis of an anomalous stream sediment result of 235 ppm Cu (Ham, 2006). Five 

HQ diamond drill holes totalling 1276.7 m (4189 feet) completed at Los Laureles 

in 2007/ 2008 tested breccia-related Cu-Mo-Ag mineralization exposed at surface 

along a segment of a NW-trending Cu-Mo±Au soil anomaly. Mineralization 

exposed in outcrop and encountered in drilling is hosted by quartz-

tourmaline±pyrite±magnetite-matrix, intrusive breccia (Fig. 6a). Breccias grade 

outward into fractured and weakly-brecciated, equigranular granodiorite and 

equigranular to porphyritic, plagioclase-K-feldspar-quartz-hornblende-(biotite) 

quartz monzonite (Fig. 6b). Interpretations by Kiska are that the mineralization at 

Los Laureles is associated with a west-dipping, downward-tapering pipe (Fig. 7).  

Drill hole DDLL08-05 (44 m @ 0.53% Cu, 0.12% Mo, 8.3 g/t Ag; Table 2) 

from the Los Laureles area was reviewed by the author during the property visit. 

This hole intersected mineralized intrusive breccia, which grades downward into 

zones of fracturing and quartz-tourmaline and pyritic veining. The main sulphides 

noted include pyrite, chalcopyrite, molybdenite and minor bornite (Fig. 6c). 

Abundant secondary Cu minerals were noted in the upper part of the hole where 

chalcopyrite was absent. Hydrothermal alteration and veining in this hole include 

quartz-tourmaline veinlets with K-feldspar halos, suggesting that secondary K-

feldspar and quartz-tourmaline alteration (and mineralization) may have been 

coeval. Secondary K-feldspar was also noted along the margins of breccia clasts 

(Fig. 6d), as halos to magnetite-pyrite veinlets and altering host intrusive rocks. 

Sericite and chlorite alteration, the latter best developed marginal to the main 

mineralized zone, also characterize this hole. The presence of hydrothermal 

magnetite in breccias and veinlets, which locally imparts a strong magnetism on 

the mineralized zone, may account for an airborne magnetic high centred at Los 

Laureles. Near the collar of DDLL08-03 in the Los Laureles area magnetite occurs 

in a silicified zone as very coarse, acicular needles up to ~ 30 cm in length.

28 
 

Relatively high-grade mineralization encountered in the upper part of drill 

hole DDLL08-05 corresponds with a zone of strong oxidation and development of 

secondary copper oxides and sulfides. Oxidation, extending from the top of the 

hole to ~ 95 m, is characterized by locally intense argillic and secondary Fe-oxide 

and hydroxide minerals including jarosite and hematite veinlets (Fig. 6e). Copper 

minerals noted include malachite, azurite and chalcocite (?). Pyrite and 

molybdenite were noted in this part of hole DDLL-08-05 but chalcopyrite was not, 

suggesting that if originally present it may have been converted to secondary 

minerals during the oxidation event. Continuing down hole are alternating zones of 

brecciated and fractured quartz monzonite with generally lower (Cu, Mo) grades. 

Narrow intervals associated with higher Cu grades encountered in the lower part of 

the hole correspond to mineralized breccia zones.  

Although intrusive rocks noted on the property are predominantly medium- to 

coarse-grained and equigranular, porphyritic to sub-porphyritic quartz monzonite 

Fig. 7. Interpretive cross-section, Los Laureles prospect (Unpublished data, Kiska Metals Corp.).

occurs in close spatial proximity to mineralization at Los Laureles (Fig. 6f). This 

spatial proximity may indicate a genetic link between this intrusive unit and Cu-

Mo-Ag mineralization at Los Laureles.    

SE of the main area of drilling at Los Laureles, elevated Cu±Mo values in 

soils along a ~ 500 m, ESE-trending zone, referred to as East Breccia, correspond 

with an area where breccias have been mapped in outcrop. This area has not been 

drill tested.  

 

9.2  El Tiro 

 

El Tiro, centred approximately 4 km ESE of the central Los Laureles area, is a 

relatively early-stage target, characterized by a broad, ~ NW-trending area of 

elevated Cu in soils, bordered to the east by areas of elevated Mo in soils. Work to 

date in this area has included collection of soil, stream sediment and limited rock 

chip samples. A traverse across the southern part of the El Tiro Cu soil anomaly 

during the property visit identified weakly to moderately chlorite ± epidote (i.e., 

propylitic) altered, medium-grained, moderately magnetic diorite or granodiorite in 

outcrop and subcrop. Mineralization noted within this unit included minor 

disseminated pyrite and, at one location, minor fracture-controlled neotocite (?) 

(Fig. 8a). The area visited corresponds to a N- to NE-trending airborne magnetic 

high (Ham, 2006), possibly the geophysical expression of the diorite/granodiorite. 

Further to the east, coarse-grained, weakly magnetic, biotite-bearing ~ granite is 

exposed along the Juananica River.    

A WNW-trending series of topographic highs occurs SW of and parallel to 

the main area of elevated Cu in soils in the El Tiro area. This zone is characterized 

by silicification, sericitic alteration, minor, narrow, quartz-tourmaline veinlets and 

locally strongly developed Fe-oxides. The WNW trend of this alteration suggests 

that it may be controlled along a WNW fault structure.

9.3  El Zapote 

 

El Zapote is an early stage target, located approximately 3 km north of Los 

Laureles. This prospect was initially identified by Kennecott in 2005 through 

stream sediment sampling, which returned <5 to 944 ppb Au, 39 to 299 ppm Cu 

and 2 to 90 ppm Mo (Ham, 2006). The main area of interest, situated within a low-

lying area immediately east of the Presidio River is a multi-element (Zn-Pb-Ag-

Mo-As±Cu-Au) soil geochemical anomaly. A second, smaller area of interest 

straddling the Presidio River and centred ~ 1.5 km to the WSW of the main 

anomaly is defined by elevated Zn-Pb±Au-Ag in soils. The El Zapote area is 

widely overburden covered, however preliminary geological interpretations by 

Kiska suggest that a granodiorite (stock ?) underlies the central part of the main

soil anomaly, bordered to the east by a granitic pegmatite and small quartz 

porphyry bodies. A traverse across the area during the property visit did not 

identify pegmatitic rocks. Rocks noted included medium-grained, equigranular, 

biotite-bearing granodiorite and, at one location, a small exposure of quartz - 

feldspar porphyry. Intrusive rocks noted in the area were weakly chlorite altered 

or, rarely, strongly sericitically altered. Minor intrusive hosted pyrite, chalcopyrite 

and fracture-controlled molybdenite, as well as several, scattered occurrences of 

fracture-controlled malachite, and a few narrow (<2 cm) quartz veins with 

malachite, were noted within the El Zapote grid. Along the north side of the 

Presidio River in the western part of the grid, samples from a ~ 280 m exposure of 

fractured, weakly limonitic and weakly chlorite altered, medium-grained 

granodiorite returned assay values of between 4 and 2280 ppm Mo and 55 and 

1415 ppm Cu from semi-continuous sampling (Figs. 8b, c). Copper and 

molybdenum values in samples collected along this zone reflect minor chalcopyrite 

and molybdenite along fractures and hosted by rare, narrow quartz veinlets.         

   

9.4  El Naranjo 

 

The El Naranjo prospect, located ~ 2.5 km SW of Los Laureles (Fig. 2), 

corresponds with an ENE-trending zone of elevated Cu±(Mo, Au, As, Ag) in soils 

and rocks (Au values in rocks <5 to 6790 ppb). This area was initially identified by 

Kennecott in 2005, where stream sediments returned Cu values of 461 and 599 

ppm (Ham, 2006). The area corresponds spatially with a prominent NE-trending 

magnetic low and with a zone of sericitic alteration (Ham, 2006). Six HQ drill 

holes totalling 1424.5 m (4673 feet), completed in 2007 by Kiska 

(Geoinformatics), tested the soil anomaly along a ~ 1.0 km length. Drilling 

intercepted wide intervals of elevated Cu and Ag (Table 2) associated with minor, 

fracture-controlled chalcopyrite. A traverse through the El Naranjo area during the 



32 
 

property visit identified medium- to fine-grained granodiorite and quartz 

monzonite, locally affected by strong sericite alteration, and cut by minor quartz-

tourmaline-matrix breccia and rare quartz veinlets. Minor malachite and 

molybdenite along fractures were noted locally (Fig. 8d).          

 

9.5  El Cobrozo 

 

The El Cobrozo prospect is located in the NE corner of the claims, ~ 5 km 

northeast of Los Laureles (Fig. 2). This area was identified by Kennecott on the 

basis of an anomalous stream sediment sample result of 258 ppm Cu. The area was 

not visited by the author during the property exam but was noted to correspond 

with a color anomaly. 

 

10.0  EXPLORATION 

 

10.1  2004/2005 Exploration work by Kennecott  

 

The details of exploration work completed by Kennecott during 2004 and 

2005, including work carried out on the La Noria concession, were presented in a 

technical report prepared by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. in April 2006 (Ham, 

2006). Work completed on the La Noria concession by Kennecott included a 

helicopter-borne aeromagnetic geophysical survey, covering the entire La Noria 

claim (Fig. 9), limited geological mapping and collection of 118 soil, 167 stream 

sediment and 233 rock samples. Sampling by Kennecott identified several areas of 

interest on the current claims including the Los Laureles, El Zapote, El Naranjo 

and El Cobrozo target areas (Figs. 10a, b; Ham, 2006).



33 
 

 

 Grid-based soil sampling and rock sampling by Kennecott at the El Naranjo 

prospect (Ham, 2006) identified an area of elevated Cu (Figs. 10a, b). The 2005 

program by Kennecott culminated in completion of 12 HQ diamond drill holes in 

the Azulitas and Las Minas areas (Ham, 2006). None of these holes are located 

within the current property boundary.   

 

10.2 2006 – 2008 Exploration Work by Kiska (Geoinformatics) 

 

 Following transfer of the property in early 2006 from Kennecott to 

Geoinformatics (Ghayem et al., 2008), exploration work completed between

property. 



35 
 

March 2006 and 2008 on the La Noria and El Tiro1 concessions included collection 

and analysis of 4084 soil and 1060 rock samples, including float, grab, chip and 

channel samples, hand trenching, 8 lines of ground IP/Resistivity geophysics 

totalling 14.4 km, completed over the Los Laureles, El Naranjo and El Zapote 

areas (Van Reed and Szidarovsky, 2008), reconnaissance geological mapping and, 

in 2007 and 2008, completion of 12 HQ-diameter diamond drill holes totalling 

2901.5 m (9519 feet) (Fig.11). Access trails were built to accommodate drilling. 

Drilling included 6 holes (1425 m) completed at the El Naranjo prospect, testing a 

ENE-trending zone of anomalous soil, rock and stream sediment geochemistry, 5 

holes (1277 m) at Los Laureles, which targeted mineralized breccias exposed at 

surface which correspond with anomalous soil and rock geochemistry, and one 200

Noria property (Fig. 11). Areas drill tested also correspond with geophysical 

targets and mineralization exposed at surface.  

 

10.2.1 Soil geochemistry 

Between 2006 and 2008 a total of 4084 soil samples, covering 2354 hectares 

were collected by Geoinformatics technicians on the La Noria and El Tiro 

concessions. Sampling included 1197 soils collected from a contiguous, ~ 656 

hectare area covering the Las Laureles and El Naranjo areas, 912 soils covering ~ 

976 hectares collected in the El Tiro area, 982 soils (~ 472 hectares) collected in 

the El Zapote area and 993 soils collected within a ~ 250 hectare area surrounding 

the Azulitas, Las Minas and El Verde concessions (mainly extension of lines onto 

the La Noria claim from soil grids centred over these showings; Fig. 11). Soil 

sampling was completed along 100 m-spaced grid lines at 100 and 50 m intervals 

in the Las Laureles, El Naranjo, El Tiro and El Zapote areas and at 25 m sample 

intervals adjacent to the Azulitas area in the western part of the claims. Soil 

sampling by Kiska (Geoinformatics) in the El Naranjo area expanded upon widely-

spaced soil coverage completed by Kennecott in this area in 2005 (Ham, 2006). No 

soil sampling prior to 2006 is known to have taken place at Los Laureles, El Tiro 

or El Zapote. Samples were collected at depths of between 10 and 30 cm from B-

horizon material where available. Sample sites were located by hand held GPS. 

Sample locations were not marked in the field.  

Soil sample results include areas of elevated Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ag, Au and 

other elements (Figs. 13-16). Correlation coefficients suggest Au-Ag-As-Bi-

(Mo,Pb,Cu,Sb) and Zn-Cd-Mn-Pb-(Ag,Sb,Cu,Mg) groupings (Fig. 12). 

 



37 
 

Soil sampling in the Los Laureles area identified a ~ 1100 x 100-800 m, NW-

trending area of elevated Cu (≥500 ppm)-Mo±Au in soils with a central zone of 

>1000 ppm Cu (Fig. 13). Elevated Zn, Pb, Ag and Sb also occur locally in soils 

within this area. The central part of this anomaly corresponds with Cu-Mo-Ag 

mineralization identified in outcrop and drilling at the prospect. A second area 

defined by Cu ≥500 ppm ± Mo in soils extends ~ 500 m to the ESE. This area, 

referred to as "East Breccia", has not been tested by drilling.   

In the El Tiro area soil sampling has been completed over a ~ 3 x 3 km grid, 

centred ~ 4 km ESE of the Los Laureles prospect (Fig. 14). Within the El Tiro grid 

a ~ 2.5 x 1.2 km, NW-trending zone of >250 ppm Cu in soils has been identified, 

with a central zone of ≥500 ppm Cu in soils. Elevated Mo (≥25 ppm) occurs in 

soils in two areas east of the Cu zone (Fig. 14). Scattered, elevated Ag, Zn and Au 

contents in soils also occur within the El Tiro grid.  

In the El Zapote area, centred ~ 3 km north of Los Laureles, soil sampling 

over a ~ 5 km2 area has delineated an ~ 800 x 800 m zone of elevated Zn-Pb-Ag-

Mo-As±(Cu-Au) and a second ~ 500 x 500m area, located ~ 2.5 km to the SW, of 

elevated Zn±Pb±Au±Ag in soils (Fig. 15). Copper contents in soils here are mostly 

≥250 ppm.

At the El Naranjo prospect soil sampling by Kiska (Geoinformatics) has 

outlined a ~ 1600 x 100 – 300 m, ENE- to NE-trending area of elevated Cu (>500 

ppm) in soils hosting a central zone of >1000 ppm Cu (Fig. 16). Scattered, elevated 

Au (individual values between <5 and 1175 ppb), Mo, Ag and As (strong in the 

SW corner of the grid) in soils occur locally within this area. This area of 

anomalous soil geochemistry in part overlies the area of high Cu contents in soils 

reported by Ham (2006) (Fig. 10). 

Soil sampling by Kiska (Geoinformatics) adjacent to the Azulitas/Las Minas 

claims identified areas of elevated Au, Ag, Pb, Zn, As (Cu, Mo ± Bi, Sb) in soils 

NE and SW of the Azulitas prospect. 

 

10.2.2 Rock geochemistry  

Between 2006 and 2008, 1060 rock samples were collected by Kiska 

(Geoinformatics) personnel on the La Noria property, including grab, chip, channel 

and float samples. Sampling was focused in the El Naranjo (458) and El Zapote 

(434) areas (Fig. 11). Samples were collected along road cuts, from surface 

outcrops, in shallow hand trenches and from historical adits. Rock chips were 

primarily collected during the mapping and soil geochemical sampling program. 

Channel samples were collected along road cuts and elsewhere in areas deemed by 

Kiska (Geoinformatics) personnel to be prospective, with higher density sampling 

in exposed gossan-like weathering profiles or where any secondary or supergene 

mineralization was noted.  

A review of two channel sample sites in the El Zapote and El Naranjo areas 

suggests that these samples represent "composite chips" rather than true 

"channels", i.e., evidence for continuous extraction of material along a "channel"  



42

43 
 

was not observed at the two sites visited. As such, they may less accurately 

represent the average grade of the sampled lengths than is implied using the term 

"channel". Hand trenches visited in the El Naranjo area were back filled, and thus 

no assessment of the nature or quality of these samples is provided here. No 

geological notes pertaining to the trenches were made available to the author and 

therefore the significance of the sample results is uncertain.   

Elevated Cu and Mo values are associated with rocks collected from several 

areas of the property. At the Los Laureles prospect, rock samples returned values 

of between <1 and 14,250 ppm Cu and <1 and 1750 ppm Mo (Fig. 13). Copper and 

Mo contents of rocks collected at El Tiro were generally low with the exception of 

1480 ppm Mo in one sample (Fig. 14) and weakly elevated Cu values (≤ 639 ppm 

Cu) associated with a few samples from this area collected by Kennecott. At El 

Zapote, Cu contents in rocks range between 7 and 2690 ppm. Most samples 

analyzed contain <250 ppm Cu. Molybdenum values between 4 and 2280 ppm 

were returned from a series of "channel" samples (average value of 175 samples 

collected over a ~ 250 m interval was 0.03% Mo) from fractured, weakly-altered 

granodiorite, exposed at the western extent of the El Zapote soil grid (Figs. 8b, c 

and 15). In the El Naranjo area, where 458 rock samples were collected, mostly 

from hand trenches excavated at the northern end of the area of drilling, results 

include values of between 5 to 14,700 ppm Cu and <1 and 755 ppm Mo (most < 5 

ppm Mo). Several samples in the El Naranjo area contain >1000 ppm Cu.      

Gold contents in rock samples from the La Noria property are mostly low 

(i.e., <250 ppb). The highest values are from the El Naranjo and Los Laureles 

areas. Five grab samples from the El Naranjo prospect returned values ranging 

between 0.5 g/t and 6.8 g/t Au while at Los Laureles, one grab sample returned 

1165 ppb Au.  



44 
 

10.2.3  Geological mapping 

Although initial geological mapping and interpretations have been completed 

in some areas of the property, this work is very preliminary in nature and is not 

discussed in detail here. The geological setting is mainly intrusive, however several 

distinct intrusive units occur on the property and breccia zones are associated with 

some of the mineralized areas (e.g., Los Laureles). 

 

10.2.4  Geophysics  

In addition to the airborne magnetic survey flown by Kennecott over the 

property in 2004 (Fig.9; Ham, 2006), geophysical work completed on the La Noria 

property has included completion of 14.4 line-kilometres of 100 m spacing dipole-

dipole IP and resistivity. This work was completed between November and 

December, 2007 in a reconnaissance fashion along 8, 1800 metre-long, variably 

oriented lines in the Los Laureles, El Naranjo and El Zapote areas (Fig. 11). The 

survey was completed by Zonge Engineering and Research Organization Inc., 

Tucson, Arizona. The methods and results of this survey are described in detail in 

Van Reed and Szidarovsky (2008). IP and resistivity pseudosections and modeled 

data are presented in Appendix A. Three lines (lines 7, 8 and 14) completed at the 

Los Laureles prospect identified a shallow IP response which corresponds 

approximately with the mineralized breccia identified on surface and in drilling in 

this area. A deep IP source is postulated by Van Reed and Szidarovsky (2008) at 

the southern end of line 14 at Los Laureles. IP/resistivity data collected along two 

lines (lines 3 and 6) in the El Naranjo area reveal a shallow chargeability anomaly 

centred at about station 800 on line 6. Modeled data appear to suggest that this 

feature deepens to the west. Line 9, completed in the El Zapote area, reveals a 

broad chargeability anomaly at depth. This area corresponds approximately with an 



45 
 

aeromagnetic low central to the zone of anomalous soil geochemistry identified in 

the area. Resistivity data collected in conjunction with the IP survey in general 

shows little variation (Van Reed and Szidarovsky, 2008). 

 

10.2.5  Summary of exploration work completed by Geoinformatics 

The work completed to date by Kiska (Geoinformatics) has highlighted 

several areas of interest including base- and precious-metal concentrations in soil 

and rock samples. In general, soil and rock sampling in conjunction with the 

airborne magnetic survey provide a good database on which to further evaluate the 

property and on which to target drilling.  

 

11.0  DRILLING 

 

In 2007 and 2008 Kiska (Geoinformatics) completed twelve HQ-diameter 

diamond drill holes totalling 2901.5 m (9519 feet) on the La Noria property. 

Drilling included six holes in the El Naranjo area, which tested a NE-trending zone 

of elevated Cu in soils, rocks and stream sediments, 5 holes drilled at the Los 

Laureles showing, testing a NW-trending zone of mineralized tourmaline-quartz-

magnetite - matrix intrusive breccia associated with anomalous Cu-Mo±Au in 

soils, rocks and stream sediments, and a single hole drilled ~ 100 m east of the 

Azulitas claim (Fig. 11). Drilling was completed by Godbe Drilling LLC of 

Montrose, CO, operating in Mexico under Perforaciones Godbe de Mexico S.A. de 

C.V. Kiska (Geoinformatics) used the same field and drilling procedures as used 

by Kennecott at Azulitas (Ghayem et al., 2008).   



46 
 

   Drill hole locations were established 

with hand held GPS and hole azimuth and 

dip were determined with a compass. 

Down hole deviations were monitored 

using a Reflex EZ-Shot tool on regular 50 

m intervals. Upon completion, drill hole 

collars were surveyed using hand held 

GPS and marked with cement blocks 

inscribed with the hole number and PVC 

pipe (Fig. 17). Boxed core from all holes 

completed is currently stored on the property in a rented core storage facility in the 

town of El Placer. Drilling data are summarized in Table 3. A summary of 

analytical results from drilling is presented in Table 2. 
 

Table 3. List of 2007-2008 drill holes. 

 

Drilling in the Los Laureles area tested mineralization exposed at surface, 

where rock samples contain up to 1.4% Cu, 0.17% Mo and 1 g/t Au. This drilling

breccia and adjacent, variably mineralized, fractured and weakly brecciated 

equigranular granodiorite and equigranular to porphyritic quartz monzonite. The 

main area of brecciation intersected in drilling has been interpreted by Kiska 

geologists as a west-dipping, downward-tapering, structurally-controlled zone 

adjacent to a NW-striking, moderately W-dipping fault (Fig. 7). Significant drill 

intersections from the Los Laureles area (Table 2) include hole DDLL08-05, which 

returned 96 m @ 0.26% Cu, 0.07% Mo and 12.6 ppm Ag, including 44 m @ 

0.53% Cu, 0.12% Mo and 8.3 g/t Ag. This hole intersected mineralized breccia 

from surface to a depth of ~ 50 m, followed by a wide zone of fracturing and weak 

brecciation hosting variable mineralization. Sulphides present include pyrite, 

chalcopyrite, chalcocite (?) and minor bornite. Mineralization encountered to a 

depth of ~ 35 m occurs within a strongly oxidized zone. Deeper in the hole, 

secondary copper minerals diminish. Hole DDLL-07-03, the northerly-most hole 

completed at Los Laureles, intersected 70.2 m @ 0.13% Cu, 0.16% Mo and 15.8 

g/t Ag (Table 2). Drilling down dip and to the west of mineralization exposed at 

surface and encountered in shallow drill holes intersected narrow zones of similar-

grade mineralization (e.g., DDLL07-02: 8 m @ 0.30% Cu, 0.23% Mo; Fig. 7). 

Drill core from Los Laureles contained between <5 and 1000 ppb Au, with most 

samples containing <50 ppb Au.     

A breccia zone mapped ESE of the area of drilling at Los Laureles (East 

Breccia) and associated with elevated Cu ± Mo in soils remains untested by 

drilling. The approximate alignment of the Los Laureles area with alteration zones 

in the El Tiro area to the ESE may reflect shared structural controls along an 

inferred EW to ESE corridor.          

Drilling in the El Naranjo area tested inferred mineralization subjacent to an 

ENE- to NE-trending Cu soil, rock and stream sediment anomaly. Drill holes were 

collared at ~ 100 to 300 m spacing and completed to depths of between ~ 200 and 



48 
 

300 m, testing ~ 1.0 km strike along the zone of anomalous geochemistry in the El 

Naranjo area (Fig. 16). Drilling at El Naranjo intersected wide zones of anomalous 

Cu ± Ag, e.g., 52 m @ 0.15% Cu and 3.7 g/t Ag in hole DDEN-07-04 (Table 2). 

Interpretations by Kiska geologists (Pers. Comm., Rene Romero, May 2010) are 

that the main zone of inferred mineralization may not have been intercepted in this 

drilling.    

Drill hole DDLN07-18, collared ~ 100 m east of the Las Minas II claim 

boundary in the western part of the La Noria concession (Fig. 11), tested 

anomalous Cu and Au in soils. This hole intersected a ~90 m interval of 

geochemically anomalous Cu values (i.e., 100 – 1400 ppm).  

 

12.0  SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 

12.1 Historical Sampling 
 

There are no records of the sample preparation, analyses and security 

procedures used prior to Kennecott.  

 

12.2 Sampling by Kennecott 
 

Rock, soil, stream sediment and drill core sampling methods and procedures 

used by Kennecott, including all aspects of the field sampling and sample 

description, handling of samples and preparation for dispatch to the assay 

laboratory, are described by Ham (2006). According to Ham (2006), Kennecott 

geologists rigorously followed the internal sampling procedures in accordance with 

their quality control protocols for all soil, rock, channel, stream sediment, and drill 

core samples.   



49 
 

12.3 Sampling by Kiska (Geoinformatics)  
 

Kiska informed the author that Geoinformatics followed all of the sampling 

and sample handling procedures developed by Kennecott during the 2006 through 

2008 exploration campaigns, consistent with reporting in 2008 by SRK (Ghayem 

et al., 2008).  

Between 2006 and 2008 a total of 4084 soil samples covering ~ 2354 hectares 

were collected by Geoinformatics technicians supervised by qualified geologists on 

the La Noria and El Tiro concessions (Fig. 11). Soil samples were collected at 25, 

50 and 100 m intervals along 100 m-spaced, NS-oriented lines (Fig. 11). On 

average, 450 grams of B-horizon soil was collected at each sample site, typically 

from depths of between 10 and 30 cm. Samples were placed in porous cloth bags. 

Sample locations were not marked in the field.   

Between 2006 and 2008 Geoinformatics personnel also collected a total of 

1060 rock samples, mainly from the El Naranjo and El Zapote areas, including 

grab, chip, channel and float samples. Samples were collected along road cuts, 

from surface outcrops, in shallow hand trenches and from historical adits. Rock 

chips were primarily collected during the mapping and soil geochemical sampling 

program.  

A large number of samples (~ 715), reported as channel samples were 

collected from shallow hand trenches and along semi-continuous rock exposures in 

the El Naranjo and El Zapote areas. Two channel sample locations were reviewed 

by the author during the property visit, including one site in the El Naranjo area 

and a second site in the El Zapote area. At both locations evidence of continuous 

"channel" sampling was not observed and, in the opinion of the author, samples are 

better described as composite chips across the stated sample widths. A hand trench 



50 
 

visited in the El Naranjo area consisted of a ~ 0.3 to 0.5m wide x ~ 0.5 m deep 

excavation. It had been back-filled and the author was informed by Kiska that hand 

trenches are routinely back-filled on the property as is requested by local residents. 

The author was also informed that sample descriptions were generally not collected 

during trench sampling but that trench samples represent continuous chips or 

channels of bedrock. The author has no reason to believe that this sampling was 

not carried out in accordance with industry standards. 

A total of 2809 core samples were collected from drilling completed on the 

La Noria concession during the 2007 and 2008 programs. Depending on 

mineralization present, sample intervals were between 1 and 3 m. Holes were 

sampled over their entire lengths including across visibly non-mineralized 

material, sampled for consistency. All drill core was sampled by sawing the core in 

half and sending half for assay and storing the other half in boxes on site, with 

sample intervals and numbers appropriately labeled and marked with numbered 

tags stapled to boxes. All handling and sampling of core was supervised by Kiska 

(Geoinformatics) geologists. The core sampling method employed and sample 

intervals used as described to the author and as evident from the core examined are 

considered by the author appropriate for the style of mineralization encountered in 

drilling and being targeted on the property. The core sampling methods employed 

would in the author's opinion effectively capture the average grades and provide 

an accurate representation of the mineralization present without overrepresentation 

of any higher grade intervals.  

Kiska has informed the author that no know recovery factors could impact the 

reliability or accuracy of the drill results.     

The sample composite assays listed in Table 2 may not reflect true widths of 

mineralization. The orientations of mineralized zones encountered in drilling at El 



51 
 

Naranjo are unknown and thus true widths are undetermined. Current 

interpretations of mineralization at Los Laureles suggest that drill intercepts may 

approximately represent true widths (Fig. 7).    
 

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

 

Kiska has informed the author that sample practices implemented by 

Geoinformatics on the La Noria project between 2006 and 2008 were the same as 

those developed and implemented by Kennecott on the La Noria project (Ham, 

2006). This is consistent with information reported previous by SRK (Ghayem et 

al., 2008). No documentation was made available to the author to indicate the 

security measures taken to ensure chain of custody of all samples submitted for 

analysis. However, the following information relating to sample handling was 

provided. Core samples sent for analyses were labeled, bagged, sealed with plastic 

cable ties and placed in sacks appropriately labeled with sample numbers and 

addresses and sealed. ALS-Chemex picked samples up at site for transport to their 

preparation laboratory in Hermosillo. If Chemex transportation was unavailable 

samples were transported by Kiska (Geoinformatics) personnel to Mazatlan where 

they were shipped via DHL to the ALS-Chemex Hermosillo preparation laboratory 

(Ignacio Salazar #688 Col. Viñedos, Hermosillo, Sonora, 83127). Prior to shipment 

of pulps for analysis to ALS-Chemex in North Vancouver, B.C., samples were 

crushed to ninety percent passing -10 mesh screen (CRU-32). A sub-sample of 

1,000 grams was prepared using a riffle splitter (SPL-21) and pulverized to eighty-

five percent passing -75 micron (PUL-32). One hundred grams of each pulverized 

sample were shipped directly to the ALS-Chemex laboratory in North Vancouver 

for assaying using two separate analytical procedures.

The ALS Chemex North Vancouver laboratory is a fully equipped analytical 

laboratory (http://www.alsglobal.com) accredited to ISO 17025:2005 by the 

Standards Council of Canada for a number of specific test procedures, including 

fire assay for gold with atomic absorption and gravimetric finish, multi-element 

inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy ("ICP-AES") and 

atomic absorption assays for silver, copper, lead and zinc. Drill core, rock, soil and 

stream sediment samples submitted by Kiska (Geoinformatics) were prepared 

using industry standard procedures. Gold was assayed using a standard fire assay 

procedure and atomic absorption finish (method code: Au-AA23) on thirty gram 

charges. A suite of thirty-three elements was analyzed by four-acid digestion and 

ICP-AES (method code ME-ICP61) on 0.5 gram sub-samples. Elements exceeding 

concentration limits of ICP-AES were re-assayed by single element aqua regia 

digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry (method code element-AA46).  

The quality assurance and quality control program implemented by Kennecott 

during exploration work conducted on the La Noria project prior to 2006 exceeded 

industry best practices as reviewed by SRK in 2006 (Ham, 2006). Geoinformatics 

implemented the same quality control procedures during work completed in 2006 

to early 2008 (Ghayem et al., 2008) and the author was informed by Kiska that 

these same practices continued to be implemented during the balance of work 

undertaken in 2008. Control samples were inserted in all batches of twenty samples 

submitted for preparation and assaying at a rate of one blank, one project specific 

standard and one duplicate. The duplicate sample was prepared by the preparation 

laboratory from coarsely crushed sample prior to pulverization. The sample blank 

was sourced from a quarry near the village of San Marco and consisted of visibly 

un-mineralized rhyolite porphyry, sized manually to replicate core fragments. 

Geoinformatics chose to use commercially available certified control samples. 

Three copper-gold certified control sample types were purchased from CDN 



53 
 

Resources Laboratories Ltd. (www.cdnlabs.com; #2, 20148 - 102nd Avenue, 

Langley, B.C., Canada, V1M 4B4, 604-882-8422). Geoinformatics also relied on 

the internal control measures implemented by the primary laboratory. 

External and internal quality control data collected between 2005 to early 

2008 by Geoinformatics and Kennecott covering all exploration work on the La 

Noria property (both internal claims, which currently do not form part of the La 

Noria project, and the current La Noria and El Tiro concessions) were evaluated by 

SRK (Ghayem et al., 2008) who concluded that in general, copper, molybdenum 

and silver values can be reasonably reproduced from coarse reject duplicates and 

pulp replicate assays, suggesting that the assay results reported by ALS-Chemex 

are generally reliable. In addition, Kiska made available to the author two quality 

control reports pertaining to the analysis of 2008 quality control data from the La 

Noria property (Geoinformatics, 2008a, b). These reports, appended to this 

technical report (Appendix B), are consistent with the general conclusion that 

analytical data produced by ALS-Chemex from samples submitted by 

Geoinformatics from the La Noria property are reliable.  

Although the author has not independently verified the quality of the 2007 

and 2008 analytical data, earlier Technical reporting by SRK and QA/QC reports 

provided to the author by Kiska (Geoinformatics) suggest that the quality of the 

data is within acceptable limits and that Kiska (Geoinformatics) used sampling, 

sample preparation and analytical procedures adequate and compatible with 

industry standards for an early-stage exploration project.

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

 

The author conducted a site visit to the La Noria project May 19th to 22nd, 

2010. The visit comprised evaluation of the main areas of geological interest and a 

review of the work completed by Kiska (Geoinformatics) personnel at these sites, 

including review of drill core from a sub-set of holes and a review of areas of other 

field work including mapping, sampling and trenching. The author was 

accompanied during the property visit by Kiska project manager and geologist 

Rene Romero.  

While check assays were not carried out by the author on samples from the La 

Noria project, the identification of visible copper ± molybdenite mineralization at 

several locations in drill core and outcrop clearly indicates the presence, at least 

locally, of Cu- ± Mo-bearing material on this project. In drill core examined, 

anomalous Cu and Mo assay values were, in most cases, associated with intervals 

of visible Cu (chalcopyrite, secondary Cu minerals, bornite) and/or Mo 

(molybdenite) mineralization. Copper and/or Molybdenum mineralization was 

noted in the field at most sites visited that were associated with anomalous rock 

sample results.  

There is a lack of sampling details attached to a percentage of the work 

reviewed, in particular the lack of descriptive data associated with trench sampling, 

however the sampling and analytical procedures followed, as reported to the author 

by Kiska, in the opinion of the author, are reliable. Core sampling and handling 

procedures as described to the author and evident from drill core examined, in the 

opinion of the author, meet or exceed industry standards.   

In addition, sampling protocols and other sampling handling procedures put in 

place by Kiska (Geoinformatics) during work completed by Geoinformatics in 

2006 to early 2008 were evaluated and are reported on in SRK Consulting 



55 
 

(Canada) Inc. technical reports (Ham, 2006; Ghayem et al., 2008). Although these 

reports include work completed on the Azulitas and surrounding claim blocks, 

which do not form part of the current property, they also incorporate sampling and 

other work carried out by Geoinformatics and Kennecott on the La Noria 

concession during this period. The authors of these reports express the opinion that 

field procedures used by Geoinformatics met or exceeded industry best practices.  

All analyses reported on here have been conducted by an internationally 

recognized and accredited laboratory (ALS-Chemex Laboratories). External and 

internal quality control data collected between 2005 to early 2008 by 

Geoinformatics and Kennecott covering all exploration work on the La Noria 

property (both internal claims and the current La Noria concession) were evaluated 

by SRK (Ghayem et al., 2008) who concluded that in general, copper, 

molybdenum and silver values the assay results reported by ALS-Chemex are 

generally reliable. Quality control reports pertaining to the analysis of quality 

control data for 2008 from the La Noria property (Geoinformatics, 2008a, b) 

further suggest that analytical data (Cu, Au) produced by ALS-Chemex are 

reliable. Analytical data in the form of electronic data bases provided to the author 

by Kiska and reported on here have been checked for consistency against PDF files 

of original ALS-Chemex analytical certificates.          
   

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

 

Third party claims are located within the boundaries of the La Noria 

concession (Fig. 2). This group of claims hosts the NI43-101 compliant Azulitas 

mineral resource (5.63 Mt @ 0.90% Cu equivalent using a 0.30% Cu-eq. cut-off: 

Ghayem et al., 2008). The following description of mineralization at Azulitas is 

taken from Ghayem et al. (2008). Mineralization comprises breccia and fracture-



56 
 

related polymetallic sulphides contained within a granodiorite intrusion with minor 

monzonite porphyry phases. Surface drilling and outcrop has delineated a steeply 

plunging pipe-like sulphide body measuring approximately 300 m in its long axis 

by 50 m. Hence, the main deposit is structurally controlled. The main sulphides are 

chalcopyrite, pyrite, molybdenite, pyrrhotite with minor bornite, sphalerite and 

galena. In the periphery of the body, sulphides fill fracture sets that locally grade 

into minor clast-supported breccias. The deposit exhibits classic early potassic 

alteration characterized by biotite-magnetite-K-feldspar-quartz-chalcopyrite 

alteration assemblages, overprinted by later sericite-chlorite-quartz (intermediate 

argillic) to sericite-quartz-pyrite (phyllic) alteration assemblages. Molybdenum is 

subordinate to the copper mineralization and exhibits no direct relationship to 

chalcopyrite mineralization. It occurs as coarse infill within brecciated and highly 

fractured portions of the mineralized system, typically within intense sericite-

chlorite altered zones. 

Immediately north of and contiguous with the La Noria property is the  

Chapalota property of Riversi de Resources Inc. (TSX-V. RRI) currently optioned 

to Arcus Development Group Inc. (TSX-V .ADG). Arcus is explori ng this earl y-

stage project for mesothermal vein-related gold mineralization (Strikland, 2008).   

The information discussed in relation to these properties is not necessarily 

indicative of the mineralization on the La Noria concession. 

 

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

 

No metallurgical test work has been conducted on any samples from the La 

Noria Concession.  

 



57 
 

17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

 

The La Noria property represents an early-stage exploration project. At this 

time no mineral resource or reserve has been established on the La Noria 

concession. 
 

18.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

 

No relevant data or information has knowingly been omitted by the author. 
 

19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 

The author has received and reviewed technical data from exploration 

programs completed in 2006 – 2008 by Kiska Metals Corporation 

(Geoinformatics) on their La Noria property, Sinaloa State, Mexico. The work 

completed includes grid-based soil sampling, rock sampling, IP/resistivity ground 

geophysical surveys, preliminary geological mapping and follow-up diamond 

drilling at three locations. The work focused on five areas of interest, including the 

Los Laureles, El Zapote, El Tiro, El Naranjo and El Cobrozo areas. The most 

advanced target on the project is the Los Laureles prospect, located in the east-

central part of the claims. Five HQ-diameter diamond drill holes totalling 1276.7 m 

(4189 feet) were completed at Los Laureles testing breccia-related Cu-Mo-Ag 

mineralization exposed in outcrop and located within a ~ 1100 m x 100-800 m 

wide zone of elevated Cu-Mo±Au geochemistry in soils. Drill results from Los 

Laureles included 44 m @ 0.53% Cu, 0.12% Mo and 8.3 g/t Ag. Breccia-related 

mineralization encountered in drilling at Los Laureles remains open at depth and 

along strike. A review of drill core from the Los Laureles area revealed that higher-



58 
 

grade, near-surface copper mineralization in hole DDLL-08-05 in part reflects a 

supergene enrichment zone. IP data may indicate a deep sulphide zone at Los 

Laureles.  

Six HQ diamond drill holes totalling 1424.5 m (4673 feet) were completed at 

the El Naranjo prospect, centred ~ 2.5 km SW of Los Laureles. Drilling tested a 

ENE- to NE-trending zone of elevated Cu and other metals in soil, rock and stream 

sediment samples, extending ~ 1600 m. Widely-spaced drilling along ~ 1.0 km of 

this zone encountering broad intersections of anomalous Cu ± Ag, e.g., 52 m @ 

0.15% Cu and 3.7 g/t Ag. The significance of drill results at El Naranjo is unclear.     

Soil sampling in the El Zapote area, ~ 3 km north of Los Laureles, has 

outlined an ~ 800 x 800 m area containing zones of elevated Zn, Pb, Ag, Mo, 

As±(Cu-Au). A second smaller area defined by anomalous soil and rock sample 

results was identified to the SW of the main anomaly. Copper and molybdenite 

mineralization in this area occur within fractured and locally sheared, weakly 

chloritic, medium-grained granodiorite. Molybdenum and copper values from a 

series of "channel" samples collected along a ~ 250 m exposure of granodiorite at 

the western margin of the soil grid range between 4 and 2280 ppm Mo and 55 and 

1415 ppm Cu (average value 0.03% Mo, 0.06% Cu) (Figs. 8b and c). Anomalous 

soil results in other areas of the El Zapote grid remain unexplained. Parts of the El 

Zapote grid are underlain by thick fluvial sedimentary deposits, locally up to 

several metres in thickness. During the course of future work in this area it should 

be established whether or not any of this material is represented in the soil data.     

In the El Tiro area, east of Los Laureles, a broad zone of elevated Cu (>250 

ppm) ± Mo in soils is underlain in part by weakly altered granodiorite and/or 

diorite. Minor fracture-related secondary Cu mineralization was noted at one 

location within the El Tiro grid, however the source of the wide-spread elevated 



59 
 

copper ± molybdenum contents in soils remains unexplained. No drilling has been 

completed to date in this area.   

The El Cobrozo area, in the north-eastern part of the claims, has seen the least 

amount of work to date. This area was not visited by the author and lacks sample 

data.      

In the opinion of the author the work completed by Kiska (Geoinformatics) on 

the La Noria property, including the density and quantity of sampling, was 

appropriate for an early-stage project and for the style of mineralization observed 

and being targeted (i.e., disseminated, fracture and breccia related sulphide 

mineralization). The data appear to adequately and reliably represent the 

mineralization present in drill core and surface exposures reviewed. Anomalous 

soil sample results remain unexplained in some areas of the property, and further 

work is required to evaluate these areas. The analytical data appear reliable given 

the observed mineralization in core and surface exposures reviewed. Certain 

samples lack sampling details and in some cases sample sites were back-filled 

and/or lack labels in the field making their evaluation difficult. Surface samples at 

two locations on the property referred to as channel samples appear, in the opinion 

of the author, to more closely reflect composite chips. All analyses reported on 

here have been conducted by an internationally accredited laboratory (ALS-

Chemex Laboratories) and analytical data presented and reported on are believed 

to be reliable and accurate.  

The results reported on here indicate that the La Noria property hosts 

intrusive-related Cu-Mo-Ag magmatic-hydrothermal mineralization associated 

with zones of brecciation and fracturing. At the Los Laureles prospect 

mineralization encountered in drilling remains open along strike and at depth. 

Geochemical anomalies defined in the El Zapote and El Tiro areas represent 

additional areas of interest which have not been fully explained and are potential 



60 
 

drill targets. Drilling in the El Naranjo area has confirmed the presence of Cu and 

Ag mineralization in the sub-surface. An area of strong As (± Au, Bi, Sb) in soils 

at the SW extent of the soil grid/area of drilling in the El Naranjo area does not 

appear to have been intersected in the drilling.   

In the opinion of the author, the work completed to date on the La Noria 

property met its original objectives of testing for and identifying areas of potential 

economic interest. The project is at an early stage and the results to date indicate 

that the geological and structural setting is prospective for discovery of Cu-Mo-Ag 

mineralization. Further exploration work is warranted and recommended. 

 

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

         Based on the results of work completed to date on the property it is the opinion of the

author that Kiska's La Noria project is of sufficient merit to warrant further exploration.

A work program is recommended designed to further delineate and test targets at Los 

Laureles, El Tiro and El Zapote and to evaluate other areas of the claims.

 

20.1 Program 

        The program would consist of geological mapping and prospecting of the El Zapote

and El Tiro soil anomalies, including trenching of anomalous zones of existing soil

geochemistry. Further work would focus on the Los Laureles breccia including detailed

mapping and sampling within the Los Laureles and East Breccia zones and the

completion of Induced Polarization (IP) and ground magnetics surveys over the entire

system including the East Breccia. Diamond drilling would consist of follow up along 

strike and down dip of successful 2008 drilling results on the western portion of the

 Los Laureles breccia and diamond drill testing of targets delineated over the eastern

 portion of the Los Laureles breccia zone. The estimated budget to complete the

 first phase work is $701,944 USD.
