 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

 Background 

TREC, Inc. (TREC) and Roughstock Mining Services (Roughstock) were retained by Azarga 

Uranium Corporation (Azarga) and their wholly owned subsidiary Powertech USA Inc. 

(Powertech), to prepare this independent Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the 

Dewey-Burdock ISR Project (Project) to be located in Custer and Fall River Counties in South 

Dakota, USA.  The project location is shown on Figure 1.1.  This PEA has been prepared for 

Azarga Uranium Corporation and Powertech USA Inc. (collectively referred to as "Azarga") in 

accordance with the guidelines set forth under National Instrument (NI) 43-101 and NI 43-

101F1 for the submission of technical reports on mining properties. 

A NI 43-101 Technical Report - Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Dewey-Burdock 

Project was prepared by SRK Consulting effective April 17, 2012 (ref., SRK, 2012). The 

mineral resource estimate presented in the 2012 PEA was reviewed and updated with new 

resource information completed and provided by Azarga.  The entire resource estimate for the 

project was reviewed and audited for this PEA resulting in an updated resource estimate as 

summarized in Table 1.1 below. The purpose of this PEA is to update the mineral resource 

estimate and update the capital and operating cost estimates and economic analysis with the 

most recent market information and to account for a revised construction and operations 

schedule. The new schedule is discussed in Section 16.

2 Cautionary statement: This Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature, and includes 
inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 

considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no 

certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral 

reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.   

As shown in Table 1.1, during the process of auditing, recontouring and recalculation of the 

drillhole data used in the previous PEA, M&I resources have increased by approximately 28 

percent with 22 percent of the inferred resource having been converted to the M&I category. 

Additionally, it was found that approximately 4.12 million pounds of indicated resources 

qualified for the measured category as defined by CIM and discussed in Section 14 of this 

PEA.  

Approximately 0.94 million pounds of additional inferred resources have also been identified 

in the Fall River formation that are located above the water table and are therefore considered 

non-ISR resources. These non-ISR resources have not been included in the resource estimate 

used in this PEA for development of the economic analysis.

The Dewey-Burdock Project is an advanced-stage uranium exploration project located in 

South Dakota and is solely controlled by Powertech USA, Inc. The Project is located in 

southwest South Dakota (Figure 1.1) and forms part of the northwestern extension of the 

Edgemont Uranium Mining District. The project is divided into two Resource Areas, Dewey 

and Burdock, as shown in Figure 1.2.  

The project is within an area of low population density characterized by an agriculture based 

economy with little other types of commercial and industrial activity. The project is expected 

to bring a significant economic benefit to the local area in terms of tax revenue, new jobs, and 

commercial activity supporting the project. Previously, a uranium mill was located at the town 

of Edgemont, and a renewal of uranium production is expected to be a locally favorable form 

of economic development.   

There is vocal, opposition to the project by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) and 

individuals though typically not in the Edgemont area.  This has created an increased 

regulatory efforts and logistics for accommodating public involvement, but at the time of this 

report, the NRC license has been issued, the State of South Dakota large scale mine permit 

has been recommended for approval.  All major permits necessary for commencing 

construction are estimated to be approved by the fourth quarter of 2015.   

The three most significant permits/licenses are (1) the Source and Byproduct Materials 

License, which was issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Agency NRC April of 2014; (2) 

the Large Scale Mine Permit (LSMP), to be issued by the South Dakota Department of 

Environment (DENR); and (3) UIC Class III and V wells (ISR injection and/or deep disposal), 

which require permits from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 8 (EPA).  

Permit requirements and status are discussed in Sections 4 and 20.

 Resources 

Cautionary statement: This Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature, 

and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to 

have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized 

as mineral reserves and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will 

be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated 

economic viability. 

As further discussed in Section 14, the deposits within the Project area contain Measured 

resources of 554,000 tons at an average grade of 0.33 percent U3O8, Indicated resources of 

992,000 tons at a grade of 0.21 percent U3O8 for a total M&I resource of 8.58 million pounds 

U3O8 at a 0.5GT cutoff, and Inferred resource of 586,000 tons at a grade of 0.05 percent U3O8 

for a total of 3.53 million pounds U3O8, at a 0.2GT cutoff. See Table 1.2 below for a summary 

of the mineral resource estimate. 

As discussed in Section 13, laboratory dissolution results ranged from 71 to 97 percent, 

indicating the deposit is amenable to ISR mining methods. In addition, recoverability for 

operating uranium ISR operations has been reported as high as 85 percent of the estimated 

resources under pattern. ISR PEAs for similar projects have predicted a range of recoverability 

from 67 to 80 percent as discussed in Section 17. The average recovery head grade assumed 

over the life of the Project in this PEA is 60 parts per million (ppm), as discussed in Sections 

13 and 17.

Note: Resource pounds and grades of U3O8 were calculated by individual grade-thickness contours.  Tonnages 

were estimated using average thickness of resources zones multiplied by the total area of those zones. 

For the purpose of this PEA, it is the author's opinion that Azarga's assumed uranium recovery 

of 80 percent of the estimated resource is a reasonable estimate. Therefore, the overall potential 

yellowcake production is estimated to be 9.69 million pounds, as shown in Table 1.3 below. 

The recovery value of 80 percent is an estimate based on industry experience and Azarga 

personnel and other former Cameco personnel experience at the Smith Ranch Uranium ISR 

mine located in Wyoming.  See Section 17 for additional discussion relative to the basis for the 

recovery value used in the PEA.  It is also projected that 100 percent of the resource will be 

placed under a mining pattern.  This may require license/permit amendments where these 

resources extend beyond the current permit boundary. In addition, the resource recovery assumes 

an average 0.5 percent recovery will be realized during restoration which is included in the total 

estimated recovery of 80 percent of the mineral resource not including any plant losses.

The Dewey-Burdock uranium mineralization is comprised of "roll-front" type uranium 

mineralization hosted in several sandstone stratigraphic horizons that are hydrogeologically 

isolated and therefore amenable to ISR technology. Uranium deposits in the Dewey-Burdock 

Project are sandstone, roll-front type. This type of deposit is usually "C"-shaped in cross 

section, with the down gradient center of the "C" having the greatest thickness and highest 

tenor. These "roll fronts" are typically a few tens of feet wide and often can be thousands of 

feet long. Uranium minerals are deposited at the interface of oxidizing solutions and reducing 

solutions. As the uranium minerals precipitate, they coat sand grains and partially fill the 

interstices between grains. Thickness of the deposits is generally a factor of the thickness of 

the sandstone host unit. Mineralization may be 10 to 15feet (ft) thick within the roll front while 

being inches to feet thick in the trailing tail portions. Deposit configuration determines the 

geometry of the well field and is a major economic factor in ISR mining. 

The Dewey-Burdock mineralization is located at depths of 550 to 800ft below surface at 

Dewey and 300 to 600ft below surface at Burdock, as several stacked horizons, which are 

sinuous and narrow but extend over several miles along trend of mineralization. The deposits 

are planned for ISR mining by development of individual well fields for each mineralized 

horizon. A well field will be developed as a series of injection and recovery wells, with a 

pattern to fit the mineralized horizon, typically a five spot well pattern on 50 to 150ft drillhole 

spacing. Hydrogeological investigations suggest that an average 100ft pattern will be 

acceptable for the Project. 

Historic exploration drilling for the project area was extensive and is discussed in Section 6. 

In 2007 and 2008, Azarga conducted confirmatory exploration drilling of 91 holes including 

20 monitoring wells. In addition, Azarga installed water wells for water quality testing and for 

hydro-stratigraphic unit testing. This work confirmed and replicated the historic drill data and 

provided some in-fill definition of uranium roll fronts. In addition, the hydrogeologic 

investigations defined the pre-mining water quality and determined the capacity for the 

uranium-bearing hydro-stratigraphic units to allow for circulation of ISR recovery fluid, and 

confinement of the fluids to the hydro-stratigraphic unit.   

 Project 

The Burdock Resource Area consists of 11 well fields where mineral extraction will occur. 

The central processing plant (CPP) facility for the Project will be located at the Burdock 

Resource Area along with five ponds as shown in Figure 1.2. A satellite facility will be 

constructed in the Dewey Resource Area. The Dewey Resource Area consists of five well 

fields where mineral extraction will occur. A discussion of the materials required for the well 

field and for the plants is provided in Sections 16 and 17, respectively.

As discussed in Section 18, the Project area is well supported by nearby towns and services. 

Major power lines are located near the Project and can be accessed and upgraded for electrical 

service for the mining operation. A major rail line (Burlington Northern-Santa Fe) cuts 

diagonally across the project area. A major railroad siding is located at Edgemont and can be 

used for shipment of materials and equipment for development of the producing facilities. 

The Project is proposed to be developed with a gradual phased approach. The Burdock CPP 

Facility will be constructed to initially accept a flow rate of up to 1,000 gallons per minute 

(gpm) lixiviant.  Capacity will be gradually expanded to accept a flow rate of 4,000 gpm of 

lixiviant. Resin will be transferred from IX vessels to resin trailers to be transported and 

processed at an off-site processing facility for the first few years. Once the flow rate capacity 

reaches 4,000 gpm, the Burdock CPP Facility will be expanded to include processing 

capabilities for up to 1.0-mlbs-pa of U3O8. Once the Burdock Resource Area has been 

economically depleted, the IX vessels will be removed from the CPP Facility and transported 

to Dewey, where a satellite facility will be constructed to mine the Dewey Resource Area. The 

proposed phases are as follows:  

 Phase I – Construction of two header houses and the Burdock CPP Facility with one 
IX train (estimated 1,000 gpm average flow rate, 1,100 gpm maximum flow capacity) 

and capability to transfer resin to a transport vehicle for off-site toll processing. 

 Phase II – Construction of an additional two header houses and expansion of the 
Burdock CPP Facility to two IX trains (estimated 2,000 gpm average flow rate, 2,200 

gpm maximum flow capacity). 

 Phase III – Construction and operation of sufficient header houses to support expansion 
of the Burdock CPP Facility to four IX trains (estimated 4,000 gpm average flow rate, 

4,400 gpm maximum flow capacity) 

 Phase IV – Construction and operation of sufficient header houses to support 
expansion of Burdock CPP Facility to maintain four IX trains (estimated 4,000 gpm 

average flow rate, 4,400 gpm maximum flow capacity) and on-site uranium processing 

capabilities up to approximately one million pounds per year. 

 Phase V – Construction of the Dewey Satellite Facility and transfer of IX vessels from 
the Burdock CPP Facility to the Dewey Facility. 

Figure 1.3 provides the operating and production schedule for the Project as currently defined.  

Production will generally occur at each well field consecutively and the Project production 

will occur over a period of approximately 11 years. Groundwater restoration and 

decommissioning (including site reclamation) will also be implemented concurrently with 

production and will continue approximately four years beyond the production period.  The 

overall mine life is approximately 16 years from initiation of construction activities to 

completion of groundwater restoration and decommissioning.

Notes:

1) Most WFs contain multiple header houses. Production may begin in one header house while another is still under construction. Thus there will be overlap of construction and production activities in some well fields that is not depicted above.

2) Well field completion is based on completed wells required to meet production in a given year. Thus, the well fields are built on an 'as-needed' basis and may not require a full year of construction activities.

3) Phase I construction activities also accounts for pre-construction design activities.

4) All wellfield license amendments are to be completed during the permit amendment period.

 Economic Analysis 

Cautionary statement: this Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature, 

and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically 

to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be 

categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic 

assessment will be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have 

demonstrated economic viability.   

The economic analyses presented herein provide the results of the analyses for pre-U.S. 

federal income tax and estimated post U.S. federal income tax.  The only difference 

between the two scenarios is the value of the estimated U.S. federal income tax.  All other 

sales, property, use, severance and conservations taxes as well as royalties are included in 

both scenarios. Both economic analyses presented herein assume no escalation, no debt, no 

debt interest and no capital repayment.  There is no State of South Dakota corporate income 

tax.   

As descried in Section 21 and summarized in Table 1.4, the estimated initial capital costs 

for the first two years of the Project life (Years -1 and 1) are approximately $27.0 million 

with sustaining capital costs of approximately $135.8 million spread over the next 11 years 

(Years 2 through 12) of production.   

Life of mine (LoM) operating costs are approximately $18.86 per pound of U3O8 produced 

including royalties and local taxes. U.S. federal income tax is estimated to be $6.53 per 

pound. The total capital and operating costs average approximately $35.66 per pound (pre-

U.S. federal income tax) and $42.19 per pound (post-U.S. federal income tax) of U3O8 

produced.  Both the capital and operating costs are current as of the middle of 2014. The 

predicted level of accuracy of the cost estimate is +/- 25 percent.  

Uranium analysts are forecasting that uranium price will increase significantly from its 

current level starting around 2015-2016 as a result of increased demand and supply 

shortages.  An average uranium price of $65 per pound of U3O8 based on an average of 

recent market forecasts by various professional entities was determined to be an acceptable 

price for the PEA based on the Project's expected startup date in 2016, see Section 19 for 

additional discussion regarding the basis for using his price.   Azarga has no contracts in 

place for sale of product from the project.  Contracts for yellowcake transportation, 

handling and sales will be developed prior to commencement of commercial production. 

The estimated payback is in Quarter 3 of Year 2 with the commencement of 

design/procurement activities in Quarter 2 of Year -1 and construction beginning Quarter 4 

of Year -1. The Project is estimated to generate net earnings over the life of the project of 

$284.2 million (pre-U.S. federal income tax) and $220.9 million (post U.S. federal income 

tax).  It is estimated that the project has an internal rate of return (IRR) of 67 percent and a 

NPV of $149.4 million (pre-U.S. federal income tax) and an IRR of 57 percent and a NPV 

of $113.8 million (post-U.S. federal income tax) applying an eight percent discount rate, 

see Table 1.4 below.

Table 1.4: Summary of Economics 

 
1 Cautionary statement: This Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature, and includes inferred mineral resources that are 
considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as 

mineral reserves and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral 

reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.   

It should be noted that the favorable economic indicators presented above are due to a 

combination of the following:  

1. Investment costs were incurred prior to this PEA for Project exploration and 
permitting,  

2. The Project will be implemented in phases starting as an IX facility rather than a 
full processing plant along with initial development of high grade, consolidated well 

fields (defers significant capital costs),  

3. Contractors will be utilized for all plant and well field construction to reduce labor 
costs associated with phased project development, and 

4. Favorable head grade and recovery rate are anticipated.

Table 1.5: Cash Flow Summary 

 

The sensitivity to changes in capital and operating costs and the price of uranium, have 

been calculated from the pre-U.S. federal income tax cash flow statements and are 

presented below in Figures 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6. The sensitivity to changes in head grade and 

uranium recovery are also discussed below. Post-U.S. federal income tax sensitivities are 

discussed in Section 22.4.  

The Project pre-U.S. federal income tax NPV is also slightly sensitive to changes in either 

capital or operating costs as shown on Figure 1.4. A five percent variation in operating cost 

results in a $3.24 million variation in NPV and an impact to the IRR of approximately 1.31 

percent, see Figure 1.5. A five percent variation in capital cost results in a $5.23 million 

variation to the NPV and an impact to the IRR of approximately 4.21 percent.

Note: Based on sales price of $65.00 per pound and eight percent discount rate. 

The Project economics are most sensitive to changes in the price of uranium, recovery and 

head grade.  A one dollar change in the price of uranium can have an impact to the NPV of 

approximately $5.49 million and an impact to the IRR of approximately 2.01 percent.  See 

Figure 1.6.  

Figure 1.6: NPV & IRR v. Uranium Sales Price (Pre-U.S. Federal Income tax) 

 

It should be noted that the economic results presented herein are very sensitive to head 

grade and recovery.  Significant variations in the assumptions for head grade and recovery 

can have significant impacts to the economic results presented.  However, there are too 

many variables associated with estimating the potential impact of head grade and recovery 

to the economics presented herein to develop a meaningful sensitivity analysis. The 

operational variables that influence head grade and recovery will be managed during 

operations to the extent practicable to minimize potential impacts.  

The above analyses are based on an eight percent discount rate and a constant price of 

$65.00 per pound of U3O8. 

 Risks 

The Project is located in a region where ISR projects have been and are operated successfully.  

The ISR mining method has been proven effective in geologic formations near the Project in 

Wyoming and Nebraska as described herein. Five Wyoming ISR facilities are currently in 

operation (Smith Ranch, North Butte, Willow Creek, Lost Creek and Nichols Ranch), one 

operating facility in Nebraska (Crow Butte) and one other is currently under construction 

(Strata's Ross Project) in Wyoming. 

As with any pre-development mining property, there are risks and opportunity attached to 

the project that need further assessment as the project moves forward. The authors deem 

those risks, on the whole, as identifiable and manageable. Some of the risks are 

summarized below and are discussed in detail in Section 25.

Dakota.  Azarga Uranium Corporation (Azarga), is a publicly traded company listed on the 

Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) under the symbol "AZZ". 

The Dewey-Burdock project is an advanced-stage exploration project with established 

uranium resources and project conceptual designs for In Situ Recovery (ISR) of uranium. 

Azarga controls approximately 17,800 acres of mineral rights and 13,880 acres of surface 

rights that cover the project areas of uranium mineralization. The permit area, as shown on 

Figures 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, is 10,580 acres. 

 Purpose of the Report 

An NI 43-101 Technical Report Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the Dewey-

Burdock Project effective April 17, 2012 was prepared by SRK Consulting (ref., SRK, 

2012). The purpose of this PEA is to audit the mineral resource estimate and update the 

capital and operating cost estimates and economic analysis with the most recent market 

information and to account for a revised construction and operations ramp up schedule. The 

new schedule is discussed in Section 16. In addition, the mineral resource estimate 

presented in the 2012 PEA was reviewed and an updated resource estimate provided by 

Azarga was audited in this PEA resulting in an updated resource estimate as summarized 

in Table 2.1 below.

As shown in Table 2.1, during the process of auditing, recontouring and recalculation of 

the drillhole data used in the previous PEA, M&I resources have increased by 

approximately 28 percent with 22 percent of the inferred resource having been converted 

to the M&I category. Additionally, it was found that approximately 4.12 million pounds of

indicated resources qualified for the measured category as defined by CIM and in Section 

14 of this PEA.  

 Terms of Reference 

Units of measurement unless otherwise indicated are feet (ft), miles, acres, pounds 

avoirdupois (lbs), and short tons (2,000 lbs).  Uranium production is expressed as pounds 

U3O8, the standard market unit. Grades reported for historical resources and the mineral 

resources reported and used herein are percent equivalent U3O8 (eU3O8) by calibrated 

geophysical logging unit).  ISR refers to "in situ recovery", sometimes also termed "in situ 

leach" leach or ISL.  Unless otherwise indicated, all references to dollars ($) refer to the 

United States currency. 

 Sources of Information 

This PEA was prepared by TREC and Roughstock and is based on information provided 

by Azarga, other professional consultants, and generally accepted uranium ISR practices.  

The cost estimates presented herein are based on well field data, process flow diagrams, 

tank and process equipment sizes and locations, building dimensions, personnel and capital 

equipment based on conceptual designs prepared by TREC and others and schedule and 

operations information provided by Azarga.  The most current previously published 

Technical Report on Resources was developed by Jerry Bush, P.G. (ref., Bush, 2010) which 

was also referenced in the most recent previously published PEA for the Project (ref., SRK, 

2012). 

The capital cost and operating cost estimates were developed primarily from TREC cost 

data, historical information, and vendor quotes for similar ISR projects currently being 

designed, constructed, or in production in the United States and are current as at mid-year 

2014.  Quantities, recovery and performance were assumed based on similar ISR projects.  

Unit costs were based on similar ISR facilities, vendor quotes, and TREC data. The income 

tax calculations were provided by Azarga.  The authors of this PEA predict the accuracy of 

the estimates at approximately +/- 25 percent. 

 Site Visits 

Doug Graves, P.E. (TREC) and Steve Cutler, P.G. (Roughstock) conducted a Project site 

visit on July 24, 2014.  The purposes of the visit was to observe the geography and geology 

of the Project site, verify work done at the site by Azarga, observe the potential locations 

of  Project  components,  current  site  activities,  and  location  of  exploration  activities 

and gain knowledge on existing site infrastructure.

Given the variability of uranium sales price, and the potential for large swings, the sales 

price has significant impacts to the economic analysis. A sensitivity analysis is provided in 

Section 22 which illustrates the potential variance in NPV and IRR based on fluctuations 

in the price of uranium.

 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

 Project Location 

The Dewey-Burdock Project is located in southwest South Dakota and forms part of the 

northwestern extension of the Edgemont Uranium Mining District. The project area is 

located in Townships 6 and 7 South Range 1 East of the Black Hills Prime Meridian. The 

county line dividing Custer and Fall River counties in South Dakota lies at the confluence 

of Townships 6 and 7 South (Figure 4.1). 

 Property Description 

The project is divided into two Resource Areas, Dewey and Burdock, as shown in Figure 

4.2. The Burdock Resource Area consists of approximately 93 surface acres and 11 well 

fields where mineral extraction will occur. The central processing facility for the Project 

will be located at the Burdock Resource Area along with four constructed impoundments 

or "ponds" as shown in Figure 4.2. A satellite facility will be constructed in the Dewey 

Resource Area. The Dewey Resource Area consists of approximately 73 surface acres and 

five well fields where mineral extraction will occur.  

 Mineral Titles 

The Project includes federal claims, private mineral rights and private surface rights covering 

the entire area within the licensed project permit boundary as well as surrounding areas. 

Since 2005, Azarga has consolidated its land position by staking an additional 61 mining 

claims and acquiring surrounding property with resource potential. At the time of this report, 

Azarga controls approximately 17,800 acres of mineral rights in the project area (Figures 

4.2, 4.3 and 4.4). The project permit area, as shown on Figures 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, is 10,580 

acres.   

Access and mineral rights are currently held by a combination of 51 private surface use, 

access and mining leases agreements, two purchase agreements and 370 federal mineral 

claims in and surrounding the project area.  Private leases are typically renewed on a five 

year basis and claims are renewed annually in September.  Lease expiry dates currently 

range between April 2, 2015 and July 26, 2025. Lease commitments vary from year to year, 

however, total annualized cost for both private surface and mineral leases is approximately 

$282,000.  Cost for maintaining federal mineral claims within and surrounding the project 

area is $57,000 per year. 

 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances 

Azarga acquired leases from the various landowners with several levels of payments and 

obligations. In the portions of the project area where Azarga seeks to develop the uranium, 

both surface and minerals are leased or controlled by unpatented mineral claims. 

Furthermore, Azarga controls all surface and mineral rights within the project permit boundary. 

Azarga granted the mineral owners an overriding royalty payment out of sales of the 

product. The surface owners will be paid an overriding royalty as incentive to support the 

development of uranium under their lands. In addition, surface owners are paid an annual 

rental to cover the cost of surface damage and to additionally compensate for reduction of

husbandry grazing during field operations.  

In December 2008, Azarga purchased a large block of properties in South Dakota and 

Wyoming from Bayswater Uranium Corporation (Bayswater). There were 37 mining claims 

(740 acres) located adjacent to Azarga properties within the Dewey-Burdock Project. 

Bayswater (and others) retained a yellowcake royalty on these properties.  

The net result of the royalty and rental payments results in a cumulative 5.25 percent 

surface and mineral royalty. Each royalty is assessed on gross proceeds. 

In January 2009, Azarga entered into an agreement with Neutron Energy Inc. (NEI) to 

exchange some of Azarga's noncore properties in New Mexico and Wyoming for acreage 

located within and adjacent to Azarga's Dewey-Burdock Project in South Dakota. The 

acreage acquired from NEI by Azarga consists of approximately 6,000 acres of prospective 

claims and leases. This acreage has historical drilling and adds future development potential 

to the project.  The potential resources and cost for recovery of those resources are not 

included in this PEA.  

 Location of Mineralization 

The uranium deposits in the Dewey-Burdock Project are classic roll front type deposits 

occurring in subsurface sandstone channels within the Lakota and Fall River formations of 

early-Cretaceous age (see stratigraphic column Figure 4.5). These fronts are known to 

extend throughout an area covering more than 16 square miles and having a total length of 

over 24mi. A map prepared by Silver King Mines (SKM) in 1985, and acquired by Azarga, 

indicates the regional oxidation-reduction boundaries (redox) that control the deposition of 

uranium mineralization. In addition to the densely (100ft spacing or less) drilled portions of 

the redox interfaces where SKM had estimated uranium resources, less densely drilled 

extensions of these boundaries total 114mi. 

 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 

The Dewey-Burdock project is well advanced in terms of environmental permits, and is 

positioned to receive the necessary licenses and permits for design and construction of an 

ISR facility in Year -1 with mining operations commencing in Year 1, see Figure 1.3. 

4.6.1 Residual Environmental Liabilities 

The eastern portion of the Burdock project area contains the remnants of uranium mining 

operations dating from the late 1950s and 1960s. Approximately 200klbs of uranium was 

extracted via open pit and shallow underground mining methods from the outcropping Fall 

River Formation. Surface disturbance related to some of these operations, including open 

pit workings and waste rock piles have not been reclaimed. At this time, Azarga does not 

propose ISR operations in the Fall River formation in this area. 

Present operational liabilities are limited to restoration of ground disturbed by drilling 

operations at the project site. Azarga conducts this work on an ongoing basis 

4.6.2 Required Permits and Status 

South Dakota has a long history of underground and open pit mining. The South Dakota

Department of Environment and Natural Resources administers recently tolled certain 

regulations related to in situ uranium development due to duplicative requirements from 

federal agencies. However, the authority to mine in South Dakota still resides with DENR 

and South Dakota still requires several permits for the Project.  There are a number of 

permits and licenses required by federal and state agencies. See Table 4.1 for a summary 

of the licenses and permits and their status. Section 20 also presents the required permits, 

and their current status for the Dewey-Burdock project along with additional discussion 

regarding environmental studies and community interaction.

 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 Access 

The nearest population center to the Dewey-Burdock Project is Edgemont, South Dakota 

(population 900) located on US Highway 18, 14mi east from the Wyoming-South Dakota 

state line. Fall River County Road 6463 extends northwestward from Edgemont to the 

abandoned community of Burdock located in the southern portion of the Dewey-Burdock 

project, about 16mi from Edgemont. This road is a two lane, all weather gravel road. Fall 

River County Road 6463 continues north from Burdock to the Fall River-Custer county line 

where it becomes Custer County Road 769 and continues on to the hamlet of Dewey, a total 

distance of about 23mi from Edgemont. This county road closely follows the tracks of the 

BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) railroad between Edgemont and Newcastle, 

Wyoming. Dewey is about 2mi from the northwest corner of the Dewey- Burdock project. 

An unnamed unimproved public access road into the Black Hills National Forest intersects 

Fall River County Road 6463 4.3mi southeast of Burdock and extends northward about 4mi, 

allowing access to the east side of the Dewey-Burdock project. About 0.9mi northwest from 

Burdock, an unimproved public access road to the west from Fall River County Road 6463 

allows access to the western portion of the Dewey-Burdock project. Private ranch roads 

intersecting Fall River County Road 6463 and Custer County Road 769 allow access to all 

other portions of the Dewey-Burdock Project. 

 Climate and Vegetation 

The Dewey-Burdock Project topography ranges from low-lying grass lands on the project's 

west side to dissected upwarped flanks of the Black Hills Uplift in the eastern portion of the 

Project. Low precipitation, high evaporation rates, low relative humidity and moderate mean 

temperatures with significant diurnal and seasonal variations characterize the area. The 

general climate of the project area is semi-arid continental or steppe with a dry winter 

season. The higher Black Hills to the northeast of the project seem to generally moderate 

temperature extremes especially during winter months.  The local climate is not expected 

to have any adverse impacts to construction or operation of the Project.  Similar projects 

have been constructed and operated for decades in the neighboring States of Nebraska and 

Wyoming.  Blizzards and extreme cold during the winter months can cause temporary 

access restrictions but are typically short lived and have rarely been a significant impedance 

to operations on ISR facilities as evidenced at nearby locations in Nebraska and Wyoming.   

The annual mean temperature in this area of South Dakota is 46°F. The mean low 

temperature of 20F occurs in January. The mean high temperature of 74°F occurs in July. 

Dewey-Burdock averages 198d/yr of below freezing temperatures. Below freezing 

temperatures generally do not occur after mid-May or before late September. 

The average precipitation in the Dewey-Burdock Project area is 15in. The wettest month is 

May when rainfall amounts to 3in and the driest months are January and December yielding 

0.5in each month, usually as snow. The average annual snowfall is 37in. See Figure 5.1 

below:

Page 30 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

Figure 5.1: Average Monthly Precipitation (2009 – 2014) 

 

Three major vegetation regions are noted within the Dewey-Burdock Project area: 

grassland, ponderosa pine and desert shrub. Grassland vegetation is dominated by buffalo 

grass, blue grama grass and western wheatgrass. Ponderosa pine occurs with Rocky 

Mountain juniper. Shrubs are composed of big sagebrush and black greasewood. 

Cultivated crops are limited to and consist of flood irrigated hay land. Less than five percent 

of the project area includes cultivated farming. Most of the vegetation is given over to cattle. 

A minor portion of the project area covered by stands of ponderosa pine has been selectively 

logged for pulpwood. Timber is not a significant industry in the Dewey-Burdock Project. 

No threatened or endangered plant species are known to exist on or near the Dewey-Burdock 

Project. 

 Topography and Elevation 

The Dewey-Burdock Project is located at the extreme southwest corner of the Black Hills 

Uplift. Terrain is thus, in part, undulating to moderately incised at the south and west portion 

of the project. The eastern and northern area is further into the Uplift and is cut by narrow 

canyons draining the higher hills. Significant drainages on the project are few, with only 

four or five canyons on the whole project area. These canyons are cut less than 1,000ft in 

width between the ridges. Slopes may be gentle or steep depending upon the underlying 

rock type. Sandstones may form cliffs up to 30 to 45ft in height that will extend for only 

hundreds of feet in length. It is estimated from available topographic maps that 2-wheel 

drive vehicles can access 75 percent of the project area and 90 percent of the known 

mineralized area. 

There is only about 300ft of elevation change across the project area. The lower elevation 

of 3,600ft above mean sea level is accurate around the south and west side of the project 

area. The highest elevation at near 3,900ft above mean sea level is at the northeast portion 

of the area.

 Infrastructure 

The Dewey-Burdock area is well supported by nearby towns and services. Major power 

lines are located across the project and can be accessed for electrical service for the mining 

operation. A major rail line (Burlington Northern-Santa Fe) cuts diagonally across the 

project area. A major railroad siding occurs at Edgemont and could be used for shipment of 

materials and equipment for development of the producing facilities. Confined groundwater 

hydro-stratigraphic units containing the uranium are locally artesian to the surface or near 

surface. This characteristic is highly favorable for ISR and will aid in the dissolution of 

oxygen in the lixiviant that is utilized in the recovery process. 

Nearby population centers indicate there will be no difficulty in finding housing for the 

relatively small staffing level (e.g., less than 100 employees) that is typical of an ISR 

operation. Skills that are employed in ISR mining are typically found in regional population 

centers. The local communities of Edgemont, Custer and Hot Springs offer sources for 

labor, housing, offices and basic supplies. 

All leases are designed to have maximum flexibility for emplacement of tanks, out 

buildings, storage area and pipelines. The topography is relatively low lying and undulating 

and is conducive for the development of ISR operations. 

The project site has no current mining related facilities or buildings. The only site facilities 

related to mining include an Azarga installed weather monitoring station, radiological 

monitoring stations, and monitor wells (capped wellheads), all accessible by dirt access 

roads. 

 Sufficiency of Surface Rights 

Azarga's land rights is composed of mining claims on BLM land, and private surface and 

minerals. The access to these lands, as stated in Section 4 – Mineral Titles is controlled by 

surface rights held by Azarga, or on public access BLM lands. There are no significant 

limitations to surface access and usage rights that might affect Azarga's ability to drill and 

conduct ISR mining and uranium recovery operations on the Dewey-Burdock properties.  

As this Project is an ISR operation, waste rock and tailings will not be generated.  Thus, 

there is no requirement for mine waste disposal and no requirement for acquiring surface 

rights for on-site disposal.  All 11 e.(2) waste will be disposed of at an off-site licensed 

facility, all non 11 e.(2) waste will be disposed of at a local licensed landfill and liquid 

wastes will be disposed of via deep disposal well (See Sections 17.5 and 20.5).

 HISTORY  

 Ownership 

The surface and minerals rights of properties within the Dewey-Burdock Project may not be 

owned by the same entity. In years past, when the surface real estate was sold, the owner 

retained ownership of the minerals. Other properties were homesteaded under the 1916 

Homestead Act and the mineral rights were reserved by the U.S. Government. Uranium 

minerals were discovered in the vicinity of the Dewey-Burdock Project area as early as 1952 

and were soon developed by open pit, adit, or decline shallow underground methods. 

Production came from small mining companies leasing the mineral rights from either the 

surface/mineral owner or the surface/mining claim owner. By the late 1950's, these surface 

uranium deposits came under the control of Susquehanna Western Corp. (SW) who had 

purchased the process mill located in Edgemont. SW mined out most of the known, shallow 

uranium deposits before closure of the mill in 1972.  

During the uranium boom of the 1970s, several companies returned to the Dewey-Burdock 

area, acquired leases and began further exploration for deeper deposits. During this period, 

exploration groups such as Wyoming Mineral (Westinghouse), Homestake Mining Co., 

Federal Resources and SW discovered much larger, roll-front type uranium mineralization. 

In 1978, TVA bought out SW's interest in the Edgemont Uranium Mining District, including 

the closed processing mill in Edgemont. TVA made the Dewey-Burdock area its main 

exploration target and developed reserves adequate to warrant an underground shaft mine at 

both the Burdock site and the Dewey site. TVA's plans included a new uranium mill to be 

located near Burdock. 

These plans ended when the price of uranium dropped in the early 1980's. Eventually, TVA 

dropped their leases and mining claims in the area and the original land/claim owners took 

over their old mining claims or retained their mineral rights. In 1994, Energy Fuels Nuclear 

(EFN) acquired the properties covering the uranium roll-front mineralized resource bodies 

within the Dewey-Burdock Project. By 2000, EFN relinquished their land position in the 

Dewey-Burdock project. 

In 2005, Denver Uranium Company, LLC (DU) acquired leases of federal claims, private 

mineral rights covering 11,180 acres and private surface rights covering 11,520 acres in the 

Dewey-Burdock area. This acreage position consisted of contiguous blocks of both surface 

and mineral rights covering the majority of the discovered and delineated uranium in this 

district. The basic terms of the lease are a five-year initial term, renewable two times every 

five years. 

On February 21, 2006, Azarga and DU entered into a binding Agreement of Purchase and 

Sale. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Azarga agreed to purchase the assets of DU in 

exchange for the issuance of eight million common shares of Azarga and the assumption of 

the liabilities of DU, including a bridge loan, but excluding liabilities related to tax and to 

DU's officers and members. Further to its initiative to consolidate the Dewey-Burdock 

uranium resource, Azarga also entered into a binding property purchase agreement with 

Energy Metals Corp. 

(EMC) on November 18, 2005 whereby Azarga acquired a 100 percent interest in 119 

mineral claims covering approximately 2,300 acres in the Dewey-Burdock area. EMC 

retained a production royalty based upon the price of uranium. Azarga issued 1 million

shares and 1.25 million share purchase warrants as consideration for the mineral claims. 

Since that time, Azarga consolidated its land position by staking an additional 61 mining 

claims and acquiring surrounding property with resource potential. At the time of this report, 

Azarga controls approximately 17,800 acres of mineral rights and 13,880 acres of surface 

rights in the project area (Figure 4.3). 

In December 2008, Azarga purchased a large block of properties in South Dakota and 

Wyoming from Bayswater Uranium Corporation (Bayswater). There were 37 mining claims 

(740 acres) located adjacent to Azarga properties within the Dewey-Burdock Project. 

Bayswater (and others) retained a Yellowcake Royalty of five percent on these properties. 

In January 2009, Azarga entered into an agreement with NEI to exchange some of Azarga's 

non-core properties in New Mexico and Wyoming for acreage located within and adjacent 

to Azarga's Dewey-Burdock Project in South Dakota. The acreage acquired from NEI by 

Azarga consists of approximately 6,000 acres of prospective claims and leases. This acreage 

has historical drilling and adds future development potential to the project. 

 Past Exploration and Development 

Exploration in the vicinity of the Dewey-Burdock area began in 1952 following discovery of 

uranium minerals in Craven Canyon in the Edgemont District. Early efforts by the US 

Atomic Energy Commission and the USGS determined the Lakota and Fall River 

formations were potential uranium host formations. 

Early rancher/prospectors made the first uranium discovery in outcrops of the Fall River 

formation on the Dewey-Burdock Project. The prospectors leased their holdings to local 

uranium mining companies who first drilled shallow exploration holes with wagon drills and 

hand-held Geiger probes. Sufficient uranium was discovered to warrant mine development 

by adit and shallow decline. Susquehanna Western Corp. drilled the first deep holes (600ft) 

to discover unoxidized uranium roll front ore deposits in the Lakota formation. 

After acquisition of the Dewey-Burdock Project by TVA in 1978, its contractor, SKM, 

evaluated previous exploration efforts and began its own exploration program. Exploration 

and development drilling continued on the Dewey-Burdock Project until 1986.  TVA then 

allowed its leases to expire. By that time, over 4,000 exploration holes to depths of 500 to 

800ft were drilled on the project. The majority of this drilling was done with rotary drills 

using 4.5 to 5.3in drill bits and drilling mud recovery fluids. Cutting samples were collected 

at 10ft intervals and were recorded in geologic sample logs. 

The completed open hole was probed for uranium intersection by down hole instruments to 

log the hole for gamma, self potential (SP) and resistivity. Because of caving ground and 

swelling clays, some holes were logged through the drill stem, which limited the borehole 

log to gamma response. TVA studied logging holes both open hole and behind pipe in the 

same hole to estimate a factor to evaluate uranium content when the hole was logged only 

behind pipe. 

TVA completed at least 64 core hole tests on the Burdock portion of the project to calculate 

equilibrium of gamma response for uranium equivalent measurement versus actual chemical 

assay. The records do not specify the laboratory used but the results show that the 

mineralized trends are in equilibrium and that gamma logging will give an accurate 

measurement of the in place uranium content.

TVA completed an extensive development drilling program as well as a hydrologic study 

and in 1981 completed an underground mine feasibility study on the uranium deposits 

within the Dewey-Burdock Project. This study designed an underground mine that proposed 

five shafts, three on the Burdock deposit and two on the Dewey deposit. Projected mine 

production was to be 750 ton/d that would produce 5Mlbs U3O8 using underground mining 

cutoff grade of 6.0ft of 0.20 percent. Later studies considered a processing mill to be built 

on the Burdock deposit that would also process Dewey ores as well as other ores to be mined 

in the Edgemont District. 

All TVA efforts between 1982 and 1986 were expended on exploration drilling assessment 

work required to hold their lode mining claims. This effort ended in 1988 when the claims 

and leases were allowed to expire. 

In 1992, EFN acquired leases and drillhole information on the Dewey-Burdock Project. 

Their intention was to mine the uranium deposits by ISR methods. EFN retained RBS&A 

as an independent consultant to evaluate available data and to identify the location, host 

formation and uranium resource that might be exploited by ISR methods. EFN did no 

additional exploration or development drilling on the project. In 2000, International 

Uranium Corporation, the successor to EFN, dropped their holdings in the Dewey-Burdock 

Project. 

 Historic Mineral Resource Estimates 

Historically, the district has had numerous operators exploring for uranium. In 1978, TVA 

acquired all the mineral interests along the known mineralized trend and looked to develop 

underground mines to feed ore to a planned expanded mill at Edgemont. The mineralized 

trends in the Dewey-Burdock area were drilled on various spacings by TVA. TVA utilized 

a qualified operator, SKM for resource/reserve estimation and mine planning. SKM was 

known as a careful and qualified operating company with knowledgeable geologists and 

engineers who had a reputation for accurate and meticulous methods of reserve/resource 

estimation. 

The first uranium resource estimate for the Dewey-Burdock Project was completed for TVA 

by SKM in 1981 as part of an underground mine feasibility study. This study used a 

minimum thickness of 6ft with a minimum average grade of 0.20 percent U3O8. The 

feasibility study concluded that 5Mlbs could be mined by underground methods from a total 

calculated resource of about 8Mlbs. Because of the specific underground mining parameters 

used in this calculation, this historical resource did not use categories contained in the CIM 

Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves. This resource was calculated from 

assay maps that showed hole location, collar elevation, gamma intercept depth, intercept 

thickness and, average intercept grade estimated by conventional gamma log grade 

calculation methods. Azarga does not consider this historical estimate to be equivalent to 

current mineral resources or mineral reserves as defined in NI 43-101; therefore, the 

historical estimates should not be relied upon. 

SKM calculated in place "identified resources" for the Project (July 1985) of 10Mlbs (SKM 

terminology, average grade and tonnage not specified). In addition, within these in-place 

pounds, SKM estimated underground "mineable reserves" of approximately 5Mlbs U3O8. 

This estimate was based on a run of mine total of 1,250,000t averaging 0.20 percent U3O8. 

This historical estimate by SKM is not compliant with NI 43-101 and the categorizations 



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 35 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

"identified resources" and "mineable reserves" are not categories contained in the CIM 

Definition Standards. These U.S. historical resource categories were based primarily on 

drillhole density within the Resource Areas. Azarga does not consider this historical 

estimate to be equivalent to current mineral resources or mineral reserves as defined in NI 

43-101; therefore, the historical estimates should not be relied upon. 

As part of the historic pre-mine feasibility study, TVA and SKM conducted several leach 

studies that were designed for a conventional milling circuit. The uranium recovery 

averaged over 99 percent and indicated that there is no known portion of the mineralization 

that can be considered refractory. Copies of the same drillhole assay maps were available to 

RBS&A in 1991 (ref., Smith, 1991). RBS&A evaluated the data for a U.S. uranium 

company in the expectation that the uranium deposit would be mined by ISR methods. 

RBS&A considered only those assay map intercepts that had an average grade of 0.05 

percent U3O8 or greater and were of sufficient thickness to yield a grade-thickness (GT) 

product of 0.50. Over 2,000 electric drillhole logs from the known mineralized areas on the 

Dewey-Burdock Project were selected for audit in order to correlate and categorize each 

intercept to a designated sand host unit and to determine an intercept position within a 

geochemical roll front system. The drillhole electric log data in association with lithologic 

data determined roll front intervals or horizons within each of 12 lithologic units within the 

Lakota and Fall River formations. Nine lithologic units were assigned to the Lakota 

formation and three lithologic units were assigned to the Fall River Formation. 

The assay intervals greater than 0.5GT and roll front location were transferred to drillhole 

location maps. The GT values were then hand contoured. The area inside the 0.5GT contour 

was measured with a planimeter to estimate the square footage within the area. The 

arithmetic mean GT intercept within the 0.5GT contour was calculated. Pounds of U3O8 

within any 0.5GT contour were estimated using the equation: 

(20 × A ×GT)/16 = lbs U3O8 

Where "A" is equal to the planimeter area, GT is mean grade-thickness product, and 16ft3/t 

is rock density. Uranium resources were estimated for each 0.5GT contour closure and these 

resources were summed for each lithologic unit. All lithologic units were summed to obtain 

the total uranium resource. This resource estimate was prepared for a U.S. client and did not 

conform to CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves. This evaluation by RBS&A 

indicated a global uranium resource that met economic parameters for ISR mining in the 

Dewey-Burdock project area totaled 8.1Mlbs U3O8, contained in 1,928,000t and averaging 

0.21 percent U3O8. Azarga does not consider this historical estimate to be equivalent to 

current mineral resources or mineral reserves as defined in NI 43-101; therefore, the 

historical estimates should not be relied upon. 

Azarga purchased all of RBS&A data in 2006. These records and maps document the 

method of calculation and interpretation of the TVA data. The maps were adjusted to fit 

Azarga's land position in 2006 and, in accordance to the CIM Standards on Mineral 

Resources and Reserves; a second resource evaluation was undertaken. These calculations 

are documented in the original Dewey-Burdock technical report prepared by RBS&A, 

showing total Azarga inferred resources to be 7.6Mlbs U3O8, contained in 1,807,000t and 

averaging 0.21 percent U3O8. Azarga's in-house experts in ISR mining corroborate the 

RBS&A calculations. 

The historical resources/reserves stated in this Section 6.3 are not reliable or relevant; they

are historically reported information only. Key assumptions and estimation parameters used 

in the above estimates are not completely known to the authors of this report, it is therefore 

not possible to determine what additional work is required to upgrade or verify the historical 

estimated as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. The above tonnage and grade 

figures are not CIM complaint resources, as no Azarga or TREC/Roughstock Qualified 

Persons have evaluated the data used to derive the estimates of tonnage and grade; therefore 

the estimates should not be relied upon. A qualified person has not done sufficient work to 

classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves and Azarga 

is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. The 

estimates of tons and grade or pounds of uranium are presented here only as documentation 

of what was historically reported for the property. 

Azarga presents current and CIM compliant resources for Dewey-Burdock in Section 12 of 

this report. 

 Historic Production 

Uranium was first produced in the Dewey-Burdock Project probably as early as 1954 by a 

local group known as Triangle Mining Co., a subsidiary of Edgemont Mining Co. Early 

commercial production consisted of a single, shallow open pit. This same group reportedly 

drove an adit from both sides of an exposed ridge mining a narrow orebody.  This mining 

was within the Burdock portion of the Dewey-Burdock Project area. 

SWI acquired the same area in about 1960 and discovered by shallow drilling sufficient 

resources in the Fall River formation to warrant open pit mining in five or six pits less than 

100ft deep. SWI controlled the mill in Edgemont, which allowed some tolerances in mining 

low-grade ores that other mining companies could not afford. SWI also had a milling 

contract with Homestake Mining Co. to buy ore from the Hauber Mine in northeast 

Wyoming. As long as SWI had the Hauber ore to run through their Edgemont mill they 

could afford to mine low-grade ores from the Burdock surface mines. When the Hauber 

Mine was mined out and Homestake ceased ore shipments to Edgemont, SWI closed their 

mining operations at Burdock and elsewhere in the Black Hills. No actual production 

records are known from the Burdock mines, which are located in the east portion of the 

current project area, but production is estimated to have been approximately 200,000 lbs. No 

subsequent operator in the Dewey-Burdock area produced uranium.

 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

 Regional Geology 

The Black Hills Uplift is a Laramide Age structure forming a northwest trending dome 

about 125mi long x 60mi wide located in southwestern South Dakota and northeastern 

Wyoming. The uplift has deformed all rocks in age from Cambrian to latest Cretaceous. 

Subsequent erosion has exposed these rock units dipping outward in successive elliptical 

outcrops surrounding the central Precambrian granite core. Differential weathering has 

resulted in present day topography of concentric ellipsoids of valleys under softer rocks and 

ridges held up by more competent units. 

The uranium host units in the Dewey-Burdock area are the marginal marine Lakota and 

Fall River sandstone units within the Inyan Kara Group of earliest Cretaceous Age. These 

sandstones are equivalent to the Cloverly formation in western Wyoming, the Lakota 

formation in western Minnesota, and the Dakota formation in the Colorado Plateau. The 

entire Inyan Kara Group consists of basal fluvial sediments grading into near marine 

sandstones, silts and clays deposited along the ancestral Black Hills Uplift. The sandstones 

are fairly continuous along the western flank of the Uplift. The Inyan Kara Group 

unconformably overlies the Jurassic Morrison formation, here a flood plain deposit and 

terrestrial clay unit.  Overlying the Inyan Kara are later early Cretaceous marine shales 

composed of the Skull Creek, Mowry, and Belle Fourche formations (referred to as the 

Graneros Group). Post uplift, the entire truncated set of formations was unconformably 

overlain by the Tertiary White River formation. The White River consisted of several 

thousand feet of volcanic ash laden sediments that have since been eroded. 

The Inyan Kara is typical of units formed as first incursion of a transgressive sea. The basal 

fluvial units grade into marine units as the ocean inundates a stable land surface. The basal 

units of the Lakota rest in scours cut into the underlying Morrison shale and display the 

depositional nature associated with mega-channel systems crossing a broad, flat coastal 

plain. Between channel sands are thin deposits of overbank and flood plain silts and clays. 

Crevasse splays are common and abruptly terminate into inter-channel clays. The upper-

most unit of the Lakota formation is a widespread clay unit generally easily identified on 

electric logs by a characteristic "shoulder" on the resistivity curve. This unit is known as 

the Fuson member. The basal unit of the Fall River formation is a widespread, fairly thick 

channel sand deposited in a middle deltaic environment that is evidenced by low-grade 

coals in its upper portion. Younger Fall River sand units are progressively thinner, less 

widespread; contain more silt and contain considerably more carbon, denoting a lower 

deltaic environment of deposition. There is little or no evidence of scouring of the contact 

between Fall River and the overlying marine Skull Creek. Inundation must have been rapid 

since within less than 20ft of sedimentation, rock character goes from middle deltaic, 

marginal marine to deep marine environment with no evidence of beach deposits or 

offshore bar systems. 

The overall structure of the Black Hills Uplift is fairly simple in that the structure is domal 

and rock units dip outward away from the central core. Regionally across the Black Hills, 

subsequent and attendant local doming caused by local intrusions disrupts the general dip 

of the units. Tensional stress creates fault zones with considerable displacement from one 

side of the zone to the other. This is often a distance of three or four miles. The Dewey fault

zone, a few miles to the north is a zone of major displacement. The faulting drops the 

uranium host units several hundred feet and truncates the oxidation reduction contact that 

formed the Dewey-Burdock mineralization. However, detailed geologic and hydrogeologic 

investigations indicate no evidence of faulting within the project permit area. 

 Local and Project Geology 

The Lakota formation in the Dewey-Burdock Project area was deposited by a northward 

flowing stream system. Sediments consist of point bar and transverse bar deposition. The 

stream channel systems are typical of meandering fluvial deposition. Sand units fine 

upward and numerous cut-and- fill sandstones are indicative of channel migration 

depositing silt and clay upon older sand and additional channel sands overlay older silts 

and clays. Uranium minerals were deposited in several stratigraphically different sands 

within the Lakota.  Because uranium deposits have formed in separate stratigraphic units, 

these units were identified and named for their stratigraphic position. 

Similar channel deposition occurred during Fall River time but the channel sands are 

noticeably thinner with marine sediments immediately superimposed on the fluvial sands. 

The knowledge of detailed stratigraphy is critical in ISR mining due to the importance of 

solution contact with the uranium mineralization. Where uranium is located in low 

permeability horizons, solution mining is not as efficient as it would be in more uniform 

sandstones with relatively equal permeability. During the evaluation of uranium resources 

made by RBS&A, the sands of the Lakota Formation were divided into nine sandstone 

units, generally about 20ft thick and usually separated by a consistent claystones or shales. 

The major sand unit in the basal Fall River Formation was divided into three sand subunits, 

each of which are mineralized and contain roll fronts on the Dewey portion of the area. All 

of the Fall River uranium mineralization on the Burdock portion of the Project is at or above 

the water table and is not considered in the economic model prepared in this report.   Mining 

of these resources is presumed to require other mining methods rather than ISR such as 

open pit or underground mining. 

The lithologic units of the Lakota and Fall River Formations now dip gently, about 3° to 

the southwest off the flank of the Black Hills Uplift (Figure 7.1). This structure controls 

present groundwater migration. Since the uranium roll front orebodies below the water table 

are dynamic, their deposition and tenor is factored by groundwater migration. No faults 

were observed during the correlation of exploration drillholes in the project area. Fault 

systems have been mapped away from the Project and only the major sandstone channel 

systems affect local groundwater migration and thus uranium deposition. 

 Significant Mineralized Zones 

7.3.1 Mineralized Zones 

Previous reports by TVA indicate that uranium minerals in the Dewey-Burdock Project are 

all of +4 valence state and thus considered to be deposited from epigenetic solutions. 

Permeability often has an effect on the mineralized resource body locations. More 

permeable portions of mineralized resource zone of the sand frequently contain larger 

portions of the deposit particularly along oxidation/reduction boundaries.  Zones of lower 

permeability are often characterized by generally thinner and less continuous deposits in 



April 2015 4580-2014-103

comparison.  Alteration, depicting the oxidation-reduction contact can occur in several 

channel units and may be several miles in length. Uranium deposition in significant deposits 

occurs discontinuously along the oxidation/reduction boundary with individual deposits 

ranging from several hundred-to a few thousand feet in length. Width of concentration is 

dependent upon lithology and position within the channel. Widths are seldom less than 50ft 

and are often over 100ft. Thickness of high concentration uranium mineralization varies 

from 1 or 2ft in limbs, to 8 or 10ft in the rolls. Tenor of uranium mineralization may vary 

from nil to a few percent at any point within the orebody. 

7.3.2 Relevant Geologic Controls 

The primary mineralized resource control of uranium mineralization in the Dewey-Burdock 

project is the presence of permeable sandstone within a major sand channel system that is 

also a groundwater hydro-stratigraphic unit. Such conditions exist in both the Lakota and 

Fall River formations. A source rock for uranium in juxtaposition to the hydro-stratigraphic 

unit is necessary to provide mineral to the system. As described above, the uranium-rich 

White River formation originally overlay the subcropping sandstone units of the Lakota 

and Fall River formations. The last control is the need for a source of reductant to precipitate 

dissolved uranium from groundwater solutions. RBS&A observed that such reductant is 

available from deeper hydrocarbon deposits discovered down dip only a few miles west of 

the Dewey-Burdock Project as well as hydrocarbon occurrences in deeper formations just 

east of the Project area. Previous writers as early as 1952 postulated the source of reductant 

to be carbon and carbonaceous material that does occur in varying quantities throughout 

the Inyan Kara group sedimentary rocks, including the Fall River and Lakota formations. 

 Hydrogeological Setting 

CIM adopted Best Practice Guidelines for the Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral 

Reserves on November 23, 2003; within which are recommended guidelines with respect 

to uranium. To support the use of ISR methods, hydrogeologic data are required to show: 

 Permeability of the mineralized horizon; 

 Hydrologic confinement of the mineralized horizon; and 

 Ability to return groundwater within the mined area to its original baseline quality 
and usage. 

Azarga completed significant work to characterize the groundwater system at the Dewey-

Burdock project to demonstrate favorable hydrogeologic conditions for ISR methods, as 

well as mine planning and permitting purposes. Work completed by Azarga and their 

consultants includes monitor and pumping well construction, hydro-stratigraphic unit 

testing, groundwater sampling, and completion of regional and well field scale groundwater 

models. 

7.4.1  Project Hydrogeology 

Within the Dewey-Burdock project area the uppermost hydro-stratigraphic unit and the 

production hydro-stratigraphic unit are both the Inyan Kara, the underlying hydro-

stratigraphic unit is the Unkpapa Formation (or Sundance if the Unkpapa is not present). 



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 40 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

There is no overlying hydro-stratigraphic unit within the project area other than minor 

localized alluvial hydro-stratigraphic units. 

The information presented is based upon the results of work completed by Azarga and their 

consultants, as well as TVA. Azarga completed groundwater sampling, piezometric surface 

mapping, and individual hydro-stratigraphic unit tests within both the Dewey project area 

and the Burdock project area in 2007-2009, in addition to resource drilling activities that 

collected core samples for measurement of hydrogeologic parameters. TVA completed 

three hydro-stratigraphic unit tests, one just north of the Dewey project area in 1982, and 

two within the Burdock project area in 1979 (ref., Powertech, 2013a and 2013b). 

7.4.2 Hydraulic Properties of the Inyan Kara 

The following section discusses the results of hydro-stratigraphic unit tests and 

geotechnical testing completed in the project area to estimate the hydraulic properties of 

the production hydro-stratigraphic unit and confining units, as well as water level data and 

confining pressures for the individual project areas. 

Dewey 

Two hydro-stratigraphic unit test programs were completed within or just outside of the 

Dewey project area: Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1982 (ref., Powertech, 2013a) 

and Azarga in 2008 (ref., Powertech, 2013c). 

The 1982 test completed by TVA consisted of pumping in the Lakota Formation for 11 

days at an average rate of 495gpm from a screened interval 75ft in length. The results of 

the hydro-stratigraphic unit test yielded the following data: 

 Transmissivity of the Lakota averaged 590 sf/d; and 

 Storativity of the Lakota was approximately 0.0001 (dimensionless). 

TVA recorded a hydraulic response in the Fall River through the intervening Fuson 

Member late in the hydro-stratigraphic unit test (3,000 to 10,000 minutes). TVA calculated 

the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the Fuson Member to be 0.0002 ft/d using the 

Neuman-Witherspoon ratio method (ref., Neuman and Witherspoon, 1972). 

TVA observed a barrier boundary, or a decrease in transmissivity due to lithologic changes 

with distance from the site, or both. A possible geologic feature corresponding to a barrier 

was noted to be the Dewey Fault Zone, located approximately 1.5mi north of the test site, 

where the Lakota and Fall River Formations are structurally offset. 

The 2008 test completed by Azarga consisted of pumping in the Fall River Formation for 

74 hours at an average rate of 30.2gpm from a screened interval 15ft in length. The results 

of the hydro-stratigraphic unit test yielded the following data: 

 Ten determinations of transmissivity ranged from 180 to 330 sf/d, with the median 
value of 255 sf/d; and 

 Five determinations of storativity ranged from 0.000023 to 0.0002 with a median 
value of 0.000046. 

Azarga recorded a delayed response in the upper Fall River Formation which indicates 

lateral and vertical anisotropy due to interbedded shales in the formation. No flow was

observed through the Fuson Member between the Fall River and the underlying Lakota 

hydro-stratigraphic units. 

In addition to the 2008 hydro-stratigraphic unit test, Azarga collected and submitted Fall 

River sandstone core samples, equivalent to that tested by the hydro-stratigraphic unit test, 

for laboratory measurements of horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity with the 

following results: 

 Measured horizontal hydraulic conductivity was 6.1 ft/d; and 

 Horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity ratio of 4.5:1. 

Laboratory measurements of horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity on core from 

the confining units overlying (above the Fall River hydro-stratigraphic unit) and underlying 

(between the Fall River and Lakota hydro-stratigraphic units) the hydro-stratigraphic unit 

test area include: 

 Skull Creek shale: average vertical hydraulic conductivity of 0.000015 ft/d; and 

 Fuson shale: average vertical hydraulic conductivity of 0.000018 ft/d. 

Water level data collected by Azarga from a vertical well nest at the Dewey project area 

indicate that the Unkpapa, Lakota, and Fall River hydro-stratigraphic units are confined 

and are locally hydraulically isolated. Generalized water level data for the Lower Fall River 

Sandstone that hosts uranium mineralization in the Dewey project area are detailed in Table 

7.1. 

Table 7.1: Dewey Production Area Water Level Data 

 

Burdock 

Three hydro-stratigraphic unit tests were completed within the Burdock project area: two 

completed by TVA in 1979 (ref., Powertech, 2013b), and a third completed by Azarga in 

2008 (ref., Powertech, 2013c). 

The 1979 tests completed by TVA consisted of pumping in the Lakota Formation for 73 

hours at an average rate of 200 gpm, and pumping in the Fall River for 49 hours at an 

average rate of 8.5 gpm. A single pumping well was utilized for these tests, with a 

pneumatic packer separating the screened intervals within the Lakota and Fall River. The 

screen length in the Lakota was approximately 75ft, and in the Fall River 55ft. The results 

of the hydro-stratigraphic unit tests yielded the following data: 

Interpreted transmissivity of the Lakota was based on analysis of late time data and inferred 

decreasing transmissivity with distance from the test site due to changes in lithology; 

overall transmissivity averaged approximately 190 sf/d and storativity was 0.00018. The 

maximum transmissivity determined from early time was approximately 310 sf/d; 

 Transmissivity of the Fall River averaged approximately 54 sf/d and storativity of 
0.000014; 

 Communication was observed between the Fall River and Lakota Formations

through the intervening Fuson shale; and leaky behavior was observed in the Fall 

River Formation; and 

 The vertical hydraulic conductivity of the Fuson shale determined with the Neuman-
Witherspoon ratio method (ref., Neuman and Witherspoon, 1972) was estimated to 

be 0.001 to 0.0001 ft/d. 

The 2008 test completed by Azarga consisted of pumping in the Lakota Formation for 72 

hours at an average rate of 30.2 gpm from a screened interval 10 ft in length. The results of 

the hydro-stratigraphic unit test yielded the following data: 

 Nine determinations of transmissivity ranged from 120 to 223 sf/d with a median 
value of 150 sf/d; and  

 Four storativity determinations ranged from 0.000068 to 0.00019 with a median 
value of 0.00012. 

In addition to the 2008 pump test, Azarga collected and submitted Lakota sandstone core 

samples, representative of the formations tested during the hydro-stratigraphic unit test, for 

laboratory measurements of horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity with the 

following results: 

 Measured horizontal hydraulic conductivity ranged from 5.9 to 9.1 ft/d, and a mean 
value of 7.4 ft/d; and 

 Horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity ratio of 2.47:1. 

Laboratory measurements of horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity on core from 

the confining units overlying (above the Lakota hydro-stratigraphic unit) and underlying 

(below the Lakota hydro-stratigraphic unit) the hydro-stratigraphic unit test area include: 

 Fuson shale: average vertical hydraulic conductivity of 0.00027 ft/d; and 

 Morrison shale: average vertical hydraulic conductivity of 0.00006 ft/d. 

Water level data collected by Azarga from vertical well nest at the Burdock project area 

indicate that the Unkpapa, Lakota, and Fall River hydro-stratigraphic units are confined 

and are locally hydraulically isolated. Generalized water level data for the Lower Lakota 

Sandstone that hosts uranium mineralization in the Burdock project area are detailed in 

Table 7.2.

7.4.3 Hydrogeologic Considerations for ISR Mining Performance 

The primary hydro-stratigraphic unit parameter to consider in the design of an ISR well 

field is hydraulic conductivity/transmissivity of the mineral deposit. This parameter 

influences hydro-stratigraphic unit drawdown, and build up, due to pumping and injection, 

as well as groundwater velocity and residence time for the ISR mining lixiviant. The second 

important hydro-stratigraphic unit parameter for ISR well field design is the amount of 

hydraulic head above an upper confining unit (or available drawdown). A greater hydraulic 

head allows for higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen within the lixiviant, more 

aggressive pumping and injection, and reduced risk for gas lock in the producing formation. 

The well field plan for the Dewey-Burdock project utilizes 5-spot well patterns (four 

injection wells, and one central recovery well), 100ft well spacing (square side length), and 

an average mining thickness (screen length) ranging from 3.9ft to 6.0ft and averaging 4.9ft. 

The anticipated average pumping rate for the recovery wells is 20gpm. 

Analysis of the Fall River hydro-stratigraphic unit suggests that Azarga's anticipated

recovery well pumping rate of 20gpm is within the hydro-stratigraphic unit's potential. The 

combination of local artesian conditions (relatively high hydraulic head above an upper 

confining unit and available drawdown) in the Fall River and hydro-stratigraphic unit 

transmissivity provide favorable conditions for ISR mining techniques. The existing hydro-

stratigraphic unit parameters will allow significant dissolved oxygen to be introduced into 

the groundwater for uranium oxidation and extraction. 

The current mining plan calls for each well field to be operated for approximately 6 to 36 

months. Utilizing a recovery well pump rate of 20gpm, and assuming homogeneous flow 

within any given 5- spot pattern, a 48,000 cf mining block will have over 180 pore volumes 

circulated through the operational period. This number is significantly higher than the 30 

pore volumes utilized to obtain the 71 percent to 97 percent indicated leach efficiencies 

during bottle roll testing (SRK 2012), suggesting that the operational period of each well 

field should be sufficient to overcome unbalanced flow within any given well pattern. 

7.4.4 Hydrogeologic Considerations for ISR Mining Impact to Groundwater 
System  

In February 2012, Petrotek Engineering Corporation of Littleton, Colorado completed a 

three-dimensional numerical model to evaluate the response of the Fall River and Chilson 

hydro-stratigraphic units to operation of the Dewey-Burdock ISR project (ref., Powertech, 

2013d).  The model was developed using site-specific data regarding top and bottom hydro-

stratigraphic unit elevations, saturated thicknesses, potentiometric surfaces, hydraulic 

gradients, hydraulic conductivities, specific yields, storativities, and porosities.  The model 

was calibrated to existing conditions and to three pumping tests. 

Once calibrated, the model was used to simulate the complete operational cycle of the 

Dewey-Burdock ISR project, from production through post-restoration recovery.  

Simulations were run using production rates of 4,000 and 8,000 gallons per minute (gpm), 

a restoration rate of up to 500 gpm, and net bleeds ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 percent.  

Modeling results indicate the following: 

• Simulated production at rates of 4,000 and 8,000 gpm with 0.5 to 1.0 percent bleeds 

for a period of 8.5 years did not result in hydro-stratigraphic unit dewatering; 

• The maximum drawdown simulated outside the project area was less than 12 feet; 

• Restoration using reverse osmosis at a rate of up to 500 gpm per wellfield with a 1.0 

percent bleed was simulated to be sustainable throughout a restoration cycle of 6 pore 

volumes; 

• Groundwater sweep simulated at rates to remove one pore volume every 6 to 18 

months per wellfield did not result in localized dewatering of the hydro-stratigraphic 

unit;  

• Wellfield interference was shown to be manageable for the simulated production, 

restoration and net bleed rates through sequencing of wellfields to maximize distances 

between concurrently operating units;  

• Model simulations indicate limited drawdown will occur within the Fall River as a 

result of ISR operations within the Chilson; and  

• Simulated water levels were shown to recover to near pre-operational elevations

within one year of ISR cessation. 

7.4.5 Groundwater Chemistry 

NRC ISR licensing regulations and guidance specify that site characterization pre-mining 

groundwater chemistry data be collected from the production hydro-stratigraphic unit, 

underlying hydro-stratigraphic unit, overlying hydro-stratigraphic unit, and the uppermost 

hydro-stratigraphic unit. Within the Dewey-Burdock project area, the uppermost hydro-

stratigraphic unit and the production hydro-stratigraphic unit are both the Inyan Kara, the 

underlying hydro-stratigraphic unit is the Unkpapa Formation. There is no overlying hydro-

stratigraphic unit within the project area other than minor localized alluvial hydro-

stratigraphic units. 

Across the Black Hills region, the groundwater of the Inyan Kara ranges from soft to very 

hard and fresh to slightly saline. Compared to other regional hydro-stratigraphic units, the 

Inyan Kara has relatively high concentrations of sulfate, sodium, and magnesium. These 

concentrations, along with chloride, are generally higher in the southern Black Hills. The 

exact source of the sulfate is uncertain but could be the result of oxidation of sulfide 

minerals such as pyrite within the Inyan Kara (ref., RESPEC 2008a). 

Chemical composition and pH within the Inyan Kara varies based upon distance from the 

outcrop. Previous studies indicate the groundwater pH increases down dip, as well as a 

change from calcium sulfate type water near outcrop to sodium sulfate type down gradient. 

The Inyan Kara is a principal uranium-bearing rock unit in the southwestern Black Hills. 

As such, the hydro-stratigraphic unit typically has measurable amounts of dissolved 

uranium, radium-226, radon-222, and other byproducts of radioactive decay. In addition to 

the radionuclides, high concentrations of sulfate and dissolved solids deter use of the Inyan 

Kara as a source of drinking water (ref., RESPEC 2008b). 

Groundwater chemistry data for the Fall River Formation and Lakota Formation of the 

Inyan Kara are shown in Table 7.4. Minimum, maximum, and mean concentrations are 

based upon background data collected for the Dewey-Burdock NRC source and byproduct 

materials license. In general, the water of the Inyan Kara within the project area is 

characterized by high concentrations of dissolved solids, sulfate, and radionuclides. Mean 

concentrations of sulfate, dissolved solids, manganese, and radionuclides (gross alpha, 

Radon-222) exceed drinking water quality standards (EPA maximum contaminant levels 

(MCL), secondary MCLs, and proposed MCLs) in over half of the samples collected.  

The present poor water quality of the Inyan Kara within the Dewey-Burdock project area, 

naturally containing both radionuclide and TDS concentrations above EPA drinking water 

standards, suggests that reclamation of the production hydro-stratigraphic unit to 

background or alternate concentration limits will be required.

7.4.6 Assessment of Dewey-Burdock Project Hydrogeology 

The data confidence level is typical of a uranium ISR project at this stage in development. 

Prior to the development of each individual well field, Azarga will complete specific testing 

including coring and hydro-stratigraphic unit testing that will increase confidence and 

understanding.

 DEPOSIT TYPE 

Uranium deposits in the Dewey-Burdock Project are sandstone, roll front type. This type of 

deposit is usually "C" shaped in cross-section, with the down gradient center of the "C" 

having the greatest thickness and highest tenor. The "tails" of the "C" are usually much 

thinner and essentially trail the "roll front" being within the top and bottom of the sandstone 

unit that is slightly less permeable. 

These "roll fronts" are typically a few tens of feet wide and often can be thousands of feet 

long. Uranium minerals are deposited at the interface of oxidizing solutions and reducing 

solutions. As the uranium minerals precipitate, they coat sand grains and partially fill the 

interstices between grains. As long as oxidizing groundwater movement is constant, 

minerals will be solubilized at the interior portion of the "C" shape and precipitated in the 

exterior portion of the "C" shape, increasing the tenor of the orebody by multiple migration 

and accretion. Thickness of the orebody is generally a factor of the thickness of the 

sandstone host unit. Mineralization may be 10 to 15ft thick within the roll front while being 

inches to feet thick in the trailing tail portions. Deposit configuration determines the location 

of well field drillholes and is a major economic factor in ISR mining. 

The uranium deposits in the southern Black Hills region are characteristic of the Rocky 

Mountain and Intermontane Basin uranium province, United States (ref., Finch, 1996). The 

uranium province is essentially defined by the extent of the Laramide uplifts and basins. 

Roll-front sandstone uranium deposits formed in the continental fluvial basins developed 

between uplifts. These uranium deposits were formed by oxidizing uranium-bearing 

groundwater that entered the host sandstone from the edges of the basins. Two possible 

sources of the uranium were (1) uraniferous Precambrian granite that provided sediment for 

the host sandstone and (2) overlying Tertiary age (Oligocene) volcanic ash sediments. Major 

uranium deposits occur as sandstone deposits in Cretaceous and Tertiary age basin 

sediments. Cluster size and grades for the sandstone deposits range from 500 to 20,000t 

U3O8, at typical grades of 0.04 to 0.23 percent U3O8. 

The tectono-stratigraphic setting for roll-front uranium ores is in arkosic and fluvial 

sandstone formations deposited in small basins. Host rocks are continental fluvial and near-

shore sandstone. The principal ages of the host rocks are Early Cretaceous (144–97Ma), 

Eocene (52–36Ma), and Oligocene (36–24Ma), with epochs of mineralization at 70Ma, 35–

26Ma, and 3Ma. 

Ore mineralogy consists of uraninite, pitchblende and coffinite with associated vanadium in 

some deposits. Typical alteration in the roll-front sandstone deposit includes oxidation of 

iron minerals up- dip from the front and reduction of iron minerals down-dip along 

advancing redox interface boundaries (Figure 8.1). 

Probable sources of uranium in the sandstone deposits are Oligocene volcanic ash and/or 

Precambrian granite (2,900–2,600Ma). Mineralizing solutions in the sandstone are oxygen-

bearing groundwater. Uranium mineralization of the sandstone deposits began with 

inception of Laramide uplift (approximately 70Ma) and peaked in Oligocene. 

Size and shape of individual deposits can vary from small pod-like replacement bodies to 

elongate lobes of mineralization along the regional redox boundary. 

Historical drillhole data (electric and lithology logs), along with Azarga's confirmatory

drilling results confirm that the mineralization at Dewey-Burdock is a roll front type 

uranium deposit. This is determined by the position of the uranium mineralization within 

sandstone units in the subsurface, the configuration of the mineralization and the spatial 

relationship between the mineralization and the oxidation/reduction boundary within the 

host sandstone units.

 EXPLORATION 

Historical exploration drilling for the project area was extensive and is discussed in Section 

4 (History). In January 2007, Azarga received an exploration permit for its Dewey-Burdock 

project from the South Dakota DENR. The purpose of this drilling was to examine the 

geologic setting of the Inyan Kara Group sandstones in the subsurface, to confirm the 

uranium mineralogy within these sands, to collect core samples on which assay, 

metallurgical and leach testing could be performed. In addition, the drilling program was to 

install groundwater wells for groundwater quality samples, and for two 72-hour pump tests 

to estimate the permeability and flow rates for the host formations. Drilling associated with 

this permit began in May 2007, continued through April 2008 and will be discussed in the 

following section. 

Azarga received their second exploration permit in November 2008. The purpose of this 30-

hole permit was to investigate the uranium potential of known host sandstones, below 

planned production facilities, to ensure that no surface construction would take place over 

uranium resources. As of the date of this report, no drilling has taken place under this permit. 

No additional mineral detection exploration surveys or investigations, other than drilling, 

were conducted on the Dewey-Burdock project. 

TREC/Roughstock's opinion is that the historical drilling, for which Azarga has most, but 

not all the drillhole geophysical logs, was typically drilled and logged in a manner that 

would produce acceptable data for resource estimation purposes today. In addition, Azarga's 

confirmatory drilling has verified historically determined geology, mineralization, and 

shapes of the defined roll fronts. The exploration methods used historically and by Azarga 

are appropriate for the style of mineralization, and provide industry standard results that are 

applicable to current methods of resource estimation.

 DRILLING 

From May 2007 to April 2008, Azarga completed 91 drillholes on the Dewey- Burdock 

Project for a total footage of 55,302ft. The depths of these holes ranged from 185 to 761ft-

below-surface. While geologic information was collected from all drillholes, they were used 

for multiple purposes. Selective coring took place in ten holes and 12 holes were completed 

as water wells. With the exception of the holes converted to wells, all other drillholes were 

plugged and abandoned in accordance with State of South Dakota regulations. This involved 

filling the drillhole, from the bottom upward, with a sodium bentonite plugging gel. The 

viscosity of this plugging gel was measured to be, at a minimum, 20 seconds higher than the 

viscosity of the bottom-hole drilling fluid. After a 24-hour settling period, this method of 

hole sealing emplaces a solid plug in the abandoned hole that has a high degree of elasticity. 

This type of plug conforms to any irregularity within the drillhole and is considered to 

provide a more effective seal than a rigid cement plug. Once the plugging gel has been 

allowed to settle (24-hour period), the sealing procedure is completed by filling the 

remainder of the hole with bentonite chips to the surface. If artesian water flow was 

encountered in the drillhole, it was filled from the bottom upward with portland cement. A 

representative of the South Dakota DENR was on site to observe all hole plugging activities. 

 Mud Rotary Drilling 

Exploratory drilling was performed using a truck-mounted, rotary drill rig using mud 

recovery fluids. This style of drilling is consistent with historical drilling programs from the 

1970s and 1980s. A 6.5in hole was drilled and rotary cutting samples were collected at 5ft 

intervals. The on-site geologist prepared a description of these cuttings and compiled a 

lithology log for each drillhole. This rotary drilling was used to confirm several critical 

issues regarding uranium resources at the Dewey- Burdock project. 

Wide-spaced exploration holes were drilled across the project area to examine the geologic 

setting and the nature of the host sands within the Fall River and Lakota Formations. This 

drilling showed that the depositional environments and lithologies of the Fall River and 

Lakota sands were found to be consistent with descriptions presented by previous operators 

on the project site. It also confirmed the presence of multiple, stacked mineralized sand units 

in the area. Electric logs and lithology logs from each drillhole were used in these 

evaluations. 

Most importantly, the observation that geochemical oxidation cells within the host sands in 

the subsurface were directly related to uranium mineralization, establishes well-known 

geologic controls to uranium resources on this project. Encountering mineralized trends 

associated with "oxidized" and "reduced" sands within multiple sand units, provides reliable 

guides to the identification of resource potential in relatively unexplored areas, as well as to 

demonstrating continuity within known Resource Areas. 

Fences of drillholes were completed in areas away from known resources but within areas 

of identified oxidation-reduction boundaries in the subsurface. Due to the narrow average 

width of the higher-grade uranium mineralization along these trends, between four and six 

close-spaced drillholes are required in each fence. A total 56 holes were drilled in 15 fences. 

In the completion of this drilling program, seven fences encountered mineralization in 

excess of 0.05 percent eU3O8. The remaining eight fences will require additional drilling to 

delineate the higher-grade mineralization.

This drilling demonstrated that the originally hypothesized roll-front deposit model is 

appropriately applied to this project. While high-grade uranium mineralization was not 

encountered in all fences due to the sparse nature of reconnaissance drilling, the 

concentration and configuration of mineralization was sufficiently encouraging to warrant 

additional close-spaced drilling in the fences that did not encounter high-grade 

mineralization. 

 Core Drilling 

Ten core holes were included in the 91 drillholes completed. Rotary drilling was used to 

reach core point, at which time, a 10 ft-long, 4 in diameter core barrel (with core bit) was 

lowered into the drillhole. A total of 407 ft of 3 in core was recovered from the mineralized 

sands in four separate Resource Areas. The coring was planned to intercept various parts of 

these uranium roll front deposits and to obtain samples of mineralized sandstone for 

chemical analyses and for metallurgical testing. Six holes were cored in the Fall River 

Formation and four holes were cored in the Lakota Formation. Table 10.1 and Table 10.2 

present a listing of the uranium values in these core holes, as determined by down-hole 

radiometric logging for the Fall River and Lakota Formations, respectively. 

Table 10.1: Results of Fall River Formation Core Holes 

 

Table 10.2: Results of Lakota Formation Core Holes 

 

Overall core recovery, despite poor hole conditions in DB 07-32-3C, was greater than 90 

percent on this coring program. 

Laboratory analyses were performed on selected core samples to determine the physical 

parameters for permeability and porosity of the mineralized sands, as well as overlying and 

underlying clays. These analyses on seven core samples of mineralized sandstones showed 

favorable high, horizontal permeabilities - ranging from 449 to 3207 millidarcies. These

horizontal permeabilities within the mineralized zones allow for favorable solution flow 

rates for ISR production. Analyses on confining units, above and below the sands, showed 

very low, vertical permeabilities - ranging from 0.007 to 0.697 millidarcies. Low vertical 

permeabilities in the confining units help to isolate solutions within the mineralized sand 

during ISR mining and restoration operations. 

 Groundwater Wells 

During the 2007 and 2008 drilling campaign, Azarga converted 12 of the 91 rotary holes to 

groundwater wells in both Fall River and Lakota sands. These wells were used along with 

previously existing wells for the collection of groundwater quality samples and in pump tests 

to determine the hydrologic characteristics of the mineralized sands. Results of the pump 

tests demonstrated a sustained pumping rate of 25 to 30 gpm and showed that groundwater 

flow characteristics within the mineralized sands were sufficient to support ISR mining 

operations. All data relating to groundwater quality and hydrology are available for public 

review in the recent permit applications submitted to the NRC and the State of South Dakota. 

 Results 

TREC/Roughstock concludes the drilling practices were conducted in accordance with 

industry-standard procedures. The drilling conducted by Azarga confirms historical drilling 

in terms of thickness and grade of uranium mineralization and provides confirmatory 

geological controls to that mineralization – conformation of the redox roll-front model. 

Core drilling provided the verification of the mineralization as being largely in equilibrium 

for those deposits that are below the current water table. Water wells provide the means for 

groundwater characterization, and preliminary information to support potential ISR 

production.

 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY  

 Sample Methods 

11.1.1 Electrical Logs 

A geophysical logging truck, manufactured by Geoinstruments Logging was used for the 

borehole logging. This unit produces continuous, down-hole electric logs, consisting of 

resistivity, self-potential and gamma ray curves. This suite of logs is ideal for defining 

lithologic units in the subsurface. The resistivity and self-potential curves provide 

qualitative measurements of water conductivities and indicate permeability, which are used 

to identify sandstones, clays and other lithologic units in the subsurface. These geophysical 

techniques enable geologists to interpret and correlate geologic units and perform detailed 

subsurface geologic mapping. 

The gamma ray curves are extremely important as they provide an indirect measurement of 

uranium in the subsurface. Uranium in nature primarily consists of the isotope Uranium-

238, which is not a major gamma emitter. However, many of the daughter products of 

uranium are gamma emitters and when the uranium is in equilibrium with its daughter 

products, gamma logging is a reliable technique for calculating in-place uranium resources. 

These electric logs were run on all 91 drillholes completed across the Dewey-Burdock 

project site. They are similar in nature to TVA's historic drillhole logs for the project. 

11.1.2 Drill Cuttings 

Mud rotary drilling relies upon drilling fluids to prevent the drill bit from overheating and 

to evacuate drill cuttings from the hole. Drill cuttings (samples) are collected at five-foot 

intervals by the drill rig hands at the time of drilling. The samples are displayed on the 

ground in order to illustrate the lithology of the material being drilled and so that depth can 

be estimated. After the hole is completed, a geologist will record the cuttings piles into a 

geologist's lithology log of the hole. This log will describe the entire hole, but detailed 

attention will be directed toward prospective sands and any alteration (oxidation or 

reduction) associated with these sands. Chemical assaying of drillhole cuttings is not 

practical since dilution is so great by the mud column in the drillhole and sample selection 

is not completely accurate to depth. 

11.1.3 Core Samples 

Core samples allow accurate chemical analyses and metallurgical testing, as well as testing 

of physical parameters of mineralized sands and confining units. The mud rotary drill rig 

had the capability to selectively core portions of any drillhole, using a 10ft barrel. 

A portable core table was set up at the drilling site. Core was taken directly from the inner 

core barrel and laid out on the table. The core was measured to estimate the percentage of 

core recovery, then washed, photographed and logged by the site geologist. The core was 

then wrapped in plastic, in order to maintain moisture content and prevent oxidation, and 

cut to fit into core boxes for later sample preparation. Overall core recovery was 

approximately 90 percent.

 Review 

Gamma logs historically were the standard "sampling" tool by which to determine in-situ 

uranium grades. Current uranium exploration methods use a combination of gamma logging 

and core samples, as Azarga has, to determine in situ uranium grades, and the nature and 

extent of uranium equilibrium/disequilibrium. The methods employed by Azarga are 

appropriate for the mineralization at Dewey-Burdock and are standard industry methods for 

uranium exploration and resource development. 

 Laboratory Analysis 

Analyses of core samples are included in this report. The down-hole electric log was used 

in conjunction with the geologist's log of the core to select intervals for testing. Azarga 

selected 6in intervals of whole core (3in diameter) for physical parameter testing 

(permeability, porosity, density). Mineralized sands selected for chemical analyses were cut 

into ½ft intervals and then split in half. One of the splits was used for chemical analyses and 

the other split was set aside for metallurgical testing. Azarga geologic staff performed the 

sample identification and selection process. Chain-of-custody (COC), sample tags were 

filled out for each sample and samples were packed into ice chests for transportation to the 

analytical laboratory. 

Azarga sent samples to Energy Laboratories, Inc.'s (ELI's) Casper, WY facility for analyses. 

Upon receipt at the laboratory, the COC forms were completed and maintained, with the lab 

staff taking responsibility for the samples. The first step in the sample preparation process 

involved drying and crushing the selected samples. The pulp is then subject to an EPA 3050 

strong acid extraction technique. Digestion fluids were then run through an Inductively 

Coupled Argon Plasma Emission Spectrometer (ICPMS) according to strict EPA analytical 

procedures. Multi-element chemical analyses included values for uranium (chemical), 

vanadium, selenium, molybdenum, iron, calcium and organic carbon. Whole rock 

geochemistry provides valuable information for the design of ISR well field operations. 

11.3.1 Sample Preparation and Assaying Methods 

ELI is certified through the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program 

(NELAP). NELAP establishes and promotes mutually acceptable performance standards for 

the operation of environmental laboratories. The standards address analytical testing, with 

State and Federal agencies serve as accrediting authorities with coordination facilitated by 

the EPA to assure uniformity. Maintaining high quality control measures is a prerequisite 

for obtaining NELAP certification. As an example, nearly 30 percent of the individual 

samples run through ICPMS are control or blank samples to assure accurate analyses. In 

TREC/Roughstock's opinion, ELI has demonstrated professional and consistent procedures 

in the areas of sample preparation and sample security, resulting in reliable analytical 

results. 

11.3.2 Gamma Logging  

The basic analysis that supports the uranium grade reported in most uranium deposits is the 

down- hole gamma log created by the down-hole radiometric probe. The down-hole gamma 

log data are gathered as digital data on approximately 1.0in intervals as the radiometric

probe is inserted or extracted from a drillhole. 

The down-hole radiometric probe measures total gamma radiation from all natural sources, 

including potassium (K) and thorium (Th) in addition to uranium (U) from uranium-bearing 

minerals. In most uranium deposits, K and Th provide a minimal component to the total 

radioactivity, measured by the instrument as counts per second (CPS). At the Dewey-

Burdock Project, the uranium content is high enough that the component of natural radiation 

that is contributed by K from feldspars in sandstone and minor Th minerals is expected to 

be negligible. The conversion of CPS to equivalent uranium concentrations is therefore 

considered a reasonable representation of the in-situ uranium grade. Thus, determined 

equivalent uranium analyses are typically expressed as ppm eU3O8 ("e" for equivalent) and 

should not be confused with U3O8 determination by standard XRF or ICP analytical 

procedures (commonly referred to as chemical uranium determinations). Radiometric 

probing (gamma logs) and the conversion to eU3O8 data have been industry-standard 

practices used for in- situ uranium determinations since the 1960's. The conversion process 

can involve one or more data corrections; therefore, the process is described here. 

The typical gamma probe is about 2in in diameter and about 3ft in length. The probe has a 

standard sodium iodide (NaI) crystal that is common to both hand-held and down-hole 

gamma scintillation counters. The logging system consists of the winch mechanism, which 

controls the movement of the probe in and out of the hole, and the digital data collection 

device, which interfaces with a portable computer and collects the radiometric data as CPS 

at defined intervals in the hole. 

Raw data is typically plotted by WellCAD software to provide a graphic down-hole plot of 

CPS. The CPS radiometric data may need corrections prior to conversion to eU3O8 data. 

Those corrections account for water in the hole (water factor) which depresses the gamma 

response, the instrumentation lag time in counting (dead time factor), and corrections for 

reduced signatures when the readings are taken inside casing (casing factor). The water 

factor and casing factor account for the reduction in CPS that the probe reads while in water 

or inside casing, as the probes are typically calibrated for use in air-filled drillholes without 

casing. Water factor and casing factor corrections are made where necessary, but Azarga 

drillholes were logged primarily in open, mud-filled drillholes. 

Conversion of CPS to percent-eU3O8 is done by calibration of the probe against a source of 

known uranium (and thorium) concentration. This was done for the Azarga gamma probe 

initially at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) uranium test pits in George West, Texas. 

Throughout Azarga's field projects the probe was then regularly calibrated at the DOE 

uranium test pits in Casper, Wyoming. The calibration calculation results in a "K-factor" 

specific to the probe; the K-factor is 6.12331-6 for Azarga's gamma probe. The following 

can be stated for thick (+60cm) radiometric sources detected by the gamma probe: 

10,000CPS x K = 0.612 percent U3O8 

The total CPS at the Dewey-Burdock Uranium Project is dominantly from 

uraninite/pitchblende uranium mineralization therefore, the conversion K factor is used to 

estimate uranium grade, as potassium and thorium are not relevant in this geological 

environment. The calibration constants are only applicable to source thickness in excess of 

2.0ft. When the calibration constant is applied to source thickness of less than 2.0ft, thickness 

of mineralization will be over-stated and radiometric determined grades will be understated. 

The industry standard approach to estimating grade for a graphical plot is referred to as the

half-amplitude method and was used for this estimate. The half-amplitude method follows 

the formula:  

GT = K x A 

Where: GT is the grade-thickness product, 

K is the probe calibration constant, and 

A is the area under the curve (feet-CPS units). 

The area under the curve is estimated by the summation of the 6in (grade-thickness) 

intervals between E1 and E2 plus the tail factor adjustment to the CPS reading of E1 and 

E2, according to the following formula: 

A = [∑N + (1.38 x (E1 + E2))] 

Where: A is the area under the curve, 

N is the CPS per unit of thickness (6in), and 

E1 and E2 are the half-amplitude picks on the curve. 

This process is used in reverse for known grade to determine the K factor constant. 

The procedure used at the Dewey-Burdock Project is to convert CPS per anomalous interval 

by means of the half-amplitude method; this results in an intercept thickness and eU3O8 

grade. This process can be done in a spreadsheet with digital data, or by making picks off 

the analog plot of the graphical curve plot of down-hole CPS. 

 Results and QC Procedures 

Geophysical logging during confirmatory drilling programs at Dewey-Burdock utilized 

multiple geophysical logging trucks. Century Geophysical provided initial logging services, 

and later logging was completed by the Geoinstruments logging unit. No discrepancies were 

seen in results between either service provider. Historical logs, and those completed by 

Azarga during confirmatory drilling, were interpreted on 0.5ft intervals following standard 

industry practice. 

No drillholes completed by Azarga were truly co-located with historical drillholes; however, 

several drilled within 10ft of historical drillholes displayed similar results for eU3O8 values. 

 Opinion on Adequacy 

TREC/Roughstock concludes that Azarga's sample preparation, methods of analysis, and 

sample and data security are acceptable industry standard procedures, and are applicable to 

the uranium deposits at the Dewey-Burdock Uranium project.

 DATA VERIFICATION 

The records of the Dewey-Burdock Project are substantial. In 1991, RBS&A conducted an 

evaluation of the resource deposits using copies of electric logs and various drillhole location 

and assay maps. In 1993, additional data became available that included reports by previous 

owners, additional assay data and even aerial photographs of the project. Diligent searches 

of university libraries and government records were made. Contacts were made to interview 

people who had been active on the project at different times. All of this data was evaluated 

during 1993 and 1994 and summarized in several reports presented to EFN, the owner and 

operator of the project at that time (ref., Smith, 1993 and 1994). 

RBS&A had a long career in evaluating numerous uranium ore reserves throughout the 

United States and in Mexico. With this experience comes the knowledge to recognize 

reliable data. RBS&A stated that "knowing the parties involved in the project area and 

knowing several of the workers personally gives confidence to the veracity of the data 

obtained and reviewed to develop the estimate of uranium resources. The limitation of all 

these data is that their origin is so diverse. Different companies produced electric logs across 

a long period of time. Data is so abundant that it is difficult to accumulate all the data into 

one sensible document. Up to a point in time, these data were being used to establish an 

underground uranium mine. The present interest is to develop an ISR mine that requires 

slightly different parameters than does conventional mining." Azarga's Chief Geologist, 

Frank Lichnovsky has also reviewed this extensive database and believes the information to 

be relevant and accurate. 

 Procedures 

As previously described, TVA performed an equilibrium study on core samples from 

mineralized sandstones to demonstrate gamma response for uranium equivalent 

measurements versus actual chemical assays of the core. Figure 12.1 is the equilibrium plot 

from the original technical report showing the relationship between chemical and gamma 

responses from TVA's historic coring program. The results show that the mineralized trends 

are in equilibrium and that gamma logging will give an accurate measurement of the in place 

uranium content. 

Azarga's 10-hole coring program completed in 2007 and 2008 provided samples for a 

similar verification analysis of the uranium mineralization at Dewey-Burdock. Half-foot 

samples of mineralized sandstones were sent to Energy Labs, Inc. in Casper, WY for 

analyses. Each sample was assayed for UGamma and UChemical. As shown in the 

equilibrium plot in Figure 12.1, a trend line on the plot of these values for each core interval 

shows an excellent correlation between radiometric and chemical values. The trend lines (or 

the chemical uranium: gamma uranium ratios) for these two plots are very similar. This 

indicates that the confirmation drilling encountered the same chemical uranium 

mineralization in the subsurface and this chemical uranium is in equilibrium with its gamma 

response. For resource estimation purposes, conventional gamma ray logging will provide a 

valid representation of in-place uranium resources. 

Figure 12.2 shows the location of Azarga's confirmation drilling within the Dewey portion 

of the project area. The drillholes on this map targeted the F11 mineralized trend and are a 

good example of how confirmation drilling (shown in blue text) verified the results of 

historic drilling and in many cases, expanded known high-grade mineralization. This

confirmation drilling successfully demonstrated geological and grade continuity within 

identified Resource Areas throughout the Dewey-Burdock project. 

 Data Confirmation 

An overall assessment of the data used for the classification of resources into various 

categories is required by the CIM Definition Standards. This assessment showed that 

historical data gathering and interpretation of the data was conducted by a well-respected, 

major uranium exploration company with high-quality uranium exploration staffs. It also 

showed that at key points, professional geologic consultants reviewed and verified the 

results of the historic explorations programs. Numerous academic reports have also been 

published on geologic settings and uranium mineralization of the Project. Current 

interpretive work has been completed under the direction of Azarga's senior geologic staff. 

Azarga's Chief Geologist, Frank Lichnovsky has 40 years of uranium experience, including 

well field development assignments at several South Texas ISR facilities. All these factors 

provide a high level of confidence in the geological information available on the mineral 

deposit and that historic drillhole data on the Dewey-Burdock Project is accurate and 

useable for continued evaluation of the project. 

Mr. Steve Cutler, the Qualified Person responsible for auditing Azarga's resources, visited to 

Dewey-Burdock site and office, and reviewed the data used in this resource evaluation. He 

examined geologic data, and performed quality assurance checks of gamma logging data 

contained in resource databases/maps.  These audit techniques are described in section 14.5 

below. 

 Quality Control Measures and Procedures 

With respect to all data used in the verification analysis, Mr. Steve Cutler (QP for Mineral 

Resources) inspected the drill sites during a site visit, reviewed analytical data, and received 

copies of the analytical results and directed the interpretation of the data. 

 Limitations 

TREC/Roughstock concludes the work done by Azarga to verify the historical records has 

validated the project information. Data are available for over 7,500 locations that include the 

thickness, grade, and depth of mineralization from previous companies exploring the 

deposit.   Azarga does not have the actual geophysical logs for approximately 24 percent of 

the exploratory drill holes.  

Mr. Cutler visited the site and noted the historic location of Azarga drillhole sites and water 

well and monitor well above-ground casings. There are limitations in defining the historical 

drilling in that most, if not all, historical drillholes are no longer identifiable as to collar 

location. This is due in part because the holes were collared in soil/alluvium/shale, which 

would not visibly retain evidence of the drillhole collars unless the holes were abandoned 

with steel casing protruding from the ground surface. 

 Data Adequacy 

TREC/Roughstock notes that the drilling by Azarga has verified the location and grade of 

uranium mineralization. There are no known discrepancies in locations, depths, thicknesses, 



April 2015 4580-2014-103

or grades that would render the project data questionable in any way. It is 

TREC/Roughstock's opinion that Azarga and Qualified Person Mr. Steve Cutler (responsible 

for auditing the resource estimate in Section 14) has adequately verified the historical data 

for the Dewey-Burdock project. TREC/Roughstock has reviewed the data confirmation 

procedures and concludes that the drillhole database has been sufficiently verified and is 

adequate for use in resource estimation.

 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The following evaluation was presented in the previous PEA for the Project (ref., SRK, 2012).  The 

authors have reviewed the evaluation for use in this PEA and are in agreement with it. The evaluation 

is in regards to combined bottle roll tests conducted by Energy Labs Inc. (ELI). 

 Procedures 

Azarga conducted leach amenability studies on uranium core samples obtained in the 

previously described coring program. Azarga conducted the tests at ELI's Casper facility 

between July 27 and August 3, 2007. Leach amenability studies are intended to demonstrate 

that the uranium mineralization is capable of being leached using conventional ISR 

chemistry. The leach solution is prepared using sodium bicarbonate as the source of the 

carbonate complexing agent (formation of uranyldicarbonate (UDC) or uranyltricarbonate 

ion (UTC). Hydrogen peroxide is added as the uranium-oxidizing agent as the tests are 

conducted at ambient pressure. Sequential leach "bottle roll" tests were conducted on the 

four core intervals selected by Azarga personnel. The tests are not designed to approximate 

in-situ conditions (permeability, porosity, pressure) but are an indication of an ore's reaction 

rate and the potential uranium recovery. 

 Evaluation  

The following evaluation was presented in the previous PEA for the Project (ref., SRK, 2012).  The 

authors have reviewed the evaluation for use in this PEA and are in agreement with it. The evaluation 

is in regards to to combined bottle roll tests conducted by Energy Labs Inc. (ELI). 

13.2.1 Ambient Bottle Roll Tests 

ELI reported that acid producing reactions were occurring during the initial leaching cycles 

and this is consistent with the core samples having been exposed to air during unsealed 

storage. This may have influenced uranium leaching kinetics and final uranium extraction, 

but two other aspects of the work deserve emphasis: (1) the coarsest grain size in two of the 

four leach residues had very high uranium assays; and (2) all four composites contained 

leachable vanadium. 

The 615.5-616.5ft interval of Hole # DB0732-2C produced a 30-PV (pore volume) leach 

residue assaying 2.95 percent U3O8 in the +20-mesh fraction, and the same coarse fraction 

from the 616.5-617.3ft interval of that hole assayed 5.02 percent U3O8. The weight fractions 

were small, 0.7 percent and 1.8 percent, but the respective uranium distributions were 28 

percent and 30 percent of total uranium retained in the residues. Possibly, these losses in the 

coarsest grain fraction were due simply to calcite encapsulation or another post-

mineralization event. In any case, a QEMSCAN characterization of the uranium could shed 

light on the likelihood of increased uranium dissolution by reagent diffusion during longer 

retention times in a commercial well field. If this interpretation is supported by new 

evidence, there is a potential for ultimate uranium extractions (not overall recoveries) well 

over 90 percent from higher-grade intervals. Table 13.1 includes calculated uranium 

extractions based on the ELI leach tests without accounting for possible improvements at 

longer retention times. 



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 64

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

The leach tests were conducted on four core intervals recovered from two holes. One 

interval represented low-grade resource at 0.067 percent U3O8 and the other three intervals 

represented resource ranging from 0.14 percent U3O8 to 0.74 percent U3O8. Based on the 

known volume of core in the selected intervals and the apparent wet density, wet masses of 

sample representing a 100mL pore volume (PV), assuming 30 percent porosity, were 

delivered to the reaction vessels. 5PV lixiviant charges (500mL of 2g/L NaHCO3, 0.5 g/L 

H2O2) were mixed with the resource samples and vessel rotation was started. Over a six-day 

period, 30PV of lixiviant was delivered to and extracted from the vessels. 

 Results 

As shown in Table 13.1, the four composites contained variable concentrations of vanadium, 

but most of it, at least by one method of calculation, was dissolved by the oxygenated 

bicarbonate lixiviant. The uranium and vanadium dissolutions in Table 13.1 were calculated 

from worksheets describing individual ELI leaching cycles and are based on assays of heads 

and residues. There are analytical uncertainties, however, so Tables 13.2 and 13.3 

summarize results obtained by different approaches. The uranium dissolutions in Table 13.2 

are based on dividing the uranium mass in the leachates by the sum of the masses of uranium 

in leachates and residues. The vanadium dissolutions in Table 13.3 are based on dividing 

the sum of the vanadium masses in the leachates by the vanadium mass in the sample prior 

to leaching. Thus, the vanadium dissolutions given in Table 13.3 are lower than those in 

Table 13.1, while the uranium dissolutions in Tables 13.1 and 13.2 are comparable (ref., 

SRK, 2012). Available data do not allow a rigorous determination of the amount of 

vanadium that will dissolve during commercial leaching, but it is clear that vanadium will 

be present in the pregnant leach solutions. 

Analyses of the resulting leach solution indicated leach efficiencies of 71 percent to 92.8 

percent as shown in Table 13.1. Peak recovery solution grades ranged from 414mg/L to 

1,654mg/L. Tails analysis indicated efficiencies of 75.8 percent to 97 percent, see Table 

13.2. The differences between the two calculations are likely to involve the difficulty in 

obtaining truly representative 1g subsamples of the feed and tails solids. The solution assays 

are believed to be more accurate and representative than the feed/tails results and they 

typically showed a less conservative estimate of uranium leachability. 

These preliminary leach tests indicate that the uranium deposits at Dewey-Burdock appear 

to be readily mobilized in oxidizing solutions and potentially well suited for ISR mining.  

The results presented in this section provide an indication of the leachability of uranium 

from the host formation.  The results are not an absolute indication of the potential head 

grade or recoverability values.  However, the data do support Azarga personnel operating 

experience of average head grades of uranium in pregnant lixiviant of 60 ppm and 

recovery rates of 80 percent.

(ref., SRK, 2012) 

Table 13.3: Vanadium Dissolutions Based on Head and Leachate Assays 

 

(ref., SRK, 2012) 

The ELI report states "Vanadium mobilization occurred in all intervals; however, uranium 

appeared to leach first and preferentially." This conclusion is generally supported by the test 

results. There are potentially important consequences of high vanadium dissolution. 

Vanadium in the VO-3 and VO4-2 valence states will exchange onto and elute from a 

strong-base anionic resin along with uranium. However, the resin's affinity for uranium is 

stronger, so vanadium can be "crowded off" the resin with higher uranium loadings. Based 

upon present data, vanadium ratios are variable and may require additional attention within 

the processing facility. There are several options for removal of vanadium, including elution 

and separation by IX or solvent extraction. Should further testing or initial operations prove 

that vanadium is inhibiting uranium recovery, the addition of a vanadium removal system 

to the processing plant may be necessary. Capital costs for a vanadium circuit are not

 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

The mineral resources for the Property reported herein have been estimated utilizing the 

grade-thickness (GT) contour method.  The GT contour method is well accepted within the 

uranium ISR industry and is suited to guide detailed mine planning and estimates of 

recoverable resources for roll front type deposits such as the Dewey-Burdock Property.  A 

discussion of the methodology is presented below in Section 14.4 

 Resource Classification  

Resource estimates were prepared using parameters relevant to the proposed mining of the 

deposit by ISR methods.  The methodology relies on detailed mapping of mineralization to 

establish continuity of intercepts within individual sandstone host units.  The mineral 

resource estimates in this report were reviewed and accepted by the Qualified Person, Mr. 

Steve Cutler.  

Azarga employs a conservative resource classification system which is consistent with 

standards established by the CIM.  Mineral resources are identified as Measured, Indicated 

and Inferred based ultimately on the density of drill hole spacing, both historic and recent; 

and continuity of mineralization within the same mineral horizon (roll front). 

In simplest terms, to conform to each classification, resources determined using the GT 

contour method (see Section 14.4) must meet the following criteria:  

1.   Meet the 0.05 percent grade cutoff  

2.   Occur within the same mineral horizon (roll front),  

3.   Fall within the 0.20 or 0.50 GT contour and  

4.   Extend no farther from the drill hole than the radius of influence specified below 

for each category.  

Employing these considerations, mineralization which meets the above criteria are 

classified as resources and assigned a level of confidence via the following drill spacing 

guidelines: 

Measured 

≤75 ft (i.e., Resources on trend, within the 0.50 GT contour, and which do not extend 

beyond 75 ft. from any given ore-quality drill hole) 

Indicated  

75 - 150 ft (i.e., Resources on trend, within the 0.50 GT contour, and which extend 

from 75 ft to 150 ft. from any given resource-quality drill hole) 

Inferred  

>150 ft (i.e., Resources on trend, within the 0.20 GT contour, and which extend 

greater than 150 ft. from any given resource-quality drill hole)       

Isolated occurrences of mineralization meeting the GT and grade cutoff criteria (i.e., single 

isolated ore-quality drill holes) are classified as Inferred, and are defined as mineralization 

which occurs within the 0.2 GT contour for the given mineral horizon and extending no 

more than a 400 foot radius of influence beyond the sample point (drill hole).  See Section 

14.4 Methodology for additional discussion.

 Cutoff Selection  

Mineralization reportable as resources must meet the following cutoff criteria (see also 

Section 14.4): 

Minimum Grade:  0.050% eU3O8 

Grade measured below this cutoff is considered as zero value. 

Minimum GT (Grade x Thickness):  0.2 for inferred resources and 0.5 for indicated 

resources. 

Intercepts with GT values below this cutoff are mapped exterior to the GT contours 

employed for resource estimation, given zero resource value and therefore are 

excluded from reported resources.  

Minimum thickness:  No minimum thickness is applied, but is inherent within the 

definition of GT. 

The cutoffs used in this report are typical of ISR industry practice and represent appropriate 

values relative to current ISR operations.  ISR extraction is considerably less sensitive to 

mineral grade than conventional mining methods.  Experience at other ISR operations have 

demonstrated that grades below 0.050% can technologically be successfully leached and 

recovered, given supporting economics. Due to the nature of roll front deposits and 

production well designs, the incremental cost of addressing low grades is minimal (given 

the presence of higher grades). Furthermore, a GT cutoff of <0.5 is typical of other ISR 

operations in similar geologic and economic conditions.  Note, however, that the above 

cutoffs were selected without direct relation to any associated commodity price.  

 Assumptions 

Resources within the Dewey-Burdock Property are identified recognizing that roll front 

mineralization occurs in long, narrow, sinuous bodies which are found adjacent to, and 

parallel to, alteration (redox) fronts. These commonly occur in multiple, vertically stacked 

horizons, each of which represents a unique resource entity.   Resource classification 

requires horizontal continuity within individual horizons.  Accumulation of resources in a 

vertical sense (i.e., accumulating multiple intercepts per drill hole) is not valid in ISR 

applications.  

In addition, certain assumptions were incorporated throughout all calculations:   

1. No disequilibrium.  Therefore, the radiometric equilibrium multiplier (DEF) is 
1.0. 

2. The unit density of mineralized rock is 16.0 cubic ft. per ton, based on an 
average of other similar nearby in situ deposits and historic project data. 

3. All geophysical logs are assumed to be calibrated per normal accepted 
protocols, and grade calculations are accurate. 

4. All mineralization classified as a resource and used in the economic analysis 
occurs below the static water table.

 Methodology  

14.4.1 Fundamentals 

The Property resources are defined by utilizing both historical and recent drilling 

information.  The basic unit of mineralization is the "Mineral Intercept" and the basic unit 

of a mineral resource is the "Mineral Horizon", which is generally synonymous to a roll 

front.  Mineral intercepts are assigned to named mineral horizons based on geological 

interpretation by Azarga geologists founded on knowledge of stratigraphy, redox, and roll 

front geometry and zonation characteristics. Resources are derived and reported per mineral 

horizon (i.e., per roll front).  In any given geographic area, resources in multiple mineral 

horizons may be combined into a "resource area" (further defined in Section 16.2).   

14.4.2 Mineral Intercepts 

Mineral intercepts are derived from drill hole gamma logs and represent where the drill 

hole has intersected a mineralized zone.  Calculation of uranium content detected by gamma 

logs is traditionally reported in terms of mineral grade as eU3O8% (equivalent uranium) on 

one-half foot depth increments. A mineral intercept is defined as a continuous depth interval 

in which mineralization meets or exceeds the grade cutoff value (0.05% for the Dewey-

Burdock Property).   Mineralization below the cutoff grade is treated as zero value. A 

mineral intercept is described in terms of:  

Thickness of the mineralized interval that meets cutoff criteria 

Average Grade of mineralization within that interval 

Depth (bgs) to the top of that interval 

In addition, a GT value is assigned to each mineral intercept, defined as the average grade 

of the intercept times the thickness of the intercept.   GT is a convenient and functional 

single term used to represent the overall quality of the mineral intercept.  It is employed as 

the basic criteria to characterize "ore-quality", which at the Dewey-Burdock Property is 

defined as GT ≥ 0.20 or ≥ 0.50 for inferred and indicated resources, respectively.  Intercepts 

which do not make the "ore–quality" GT cutoff are excluded from the resource calculation, 

but may be taken into consideration when drawing GT contours. 

Each intercept is assigned to a stratigraphic and mineral horizon (Figures 4.5 and 8.1) by 

means of geological evaluation.  The primary criterion employed in assignment of mineral 

intercepts to mineral horizons is roll front correlation.  Depth and elevation of intercepts 

are secondary criteria which support correlation. The evaluation also involves interpretation 

of roll front zonation (position within the roll front) by means of gamma curve signature, 

redox state, lithology and relative mineral quality. Mineral intercept data and associated 

interpretations are stored in a drill hole database inventoried per drill hole and mineralized 

horizon.  Using GIS and ACAD software, this database is employed to generate map plots 

displaying GT values and interpretive data for each mineral horizon of interest.  These maps 

become the basis for GT contouring as described below. 

14.4.3 GT Contouring and Resource Estimation 

For the map plots of GT values mentioned above, the GT contour lines are drafted honoring 



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 70

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

all GT values.  Contours may be carefully modified by Azarga geologists where justified 

to reflect knowledge of roll front geology and geometry. The GT contour maps thus 

generated for each mineral horizon form the foundation for resource calculation.  In terms 

of geometry, the final product of a GT contoured mineral horizon typically represents a 

mineral body that is fairly long, narrow, and sinuous which closely parallels the redox front 

boundary.  Parameters employed to characterize the mineral body are:  

Thickness: Average thickness of intercepts assigned to the mineral horizon  

Grade: Average grade of mineral intercepts assigned to the mineral horizon  

Depth: Average depth of mineral intercepts assigned to the mineral horizon 

Area:  Defined as the area interior to the 0.20 GT and 0.50 GT contour lines for 

inferred and indicated resources, more specifically: 

Width: Defined by the breadth of the 0.20 / 0.50 GT contour boundaries.  

Where sufficient data is unavailable, (i.e., wide-spaced drilling), the width is 

assumed to be no greater than 50 feet 

Length: Defined by the endpoints of the 0.20 / 0.50 GT contour boundaries.  

Where sufficient data is unavailable, length is limited to 800 feet (i.e., 400 

feet on either side of an isolated drill hole – Inferred resource category). 

For resource estimation the area of a mineral horizon is further partitioned into banded 

intervals between GT contours, to which the mean GT of the given contour interval is 

applied.  Area values for each contour interval are then determined by means of GIS and 

ACAD software. Once areas are derived and mean GT values are established for each 

contour interval, resources are then calculated for each contour interval employing the 

following equation.  Resources per contour interval are then compiled per mineral horizon 

and per mineral 'pod':   

POUNDS  =   AREA x GT x 20 x DEF 
TF 

Where:  

POUNDS  = Resources (lbs.)             

AREA   = Area measured within any given GT contour interval (ft2) 

GT    = Mean GT within any given contour interval (%-ft.) 

20   = Conversion constant: tons to unit lbs. (1% of a ton)  

DEF   = Disequilibrium factor (=1.0 no disequilibrium)  

TF   = Tonnage Factor:  Rock density, a constant (=16.0  ft3/ton).  

       Enables conversion from volume to weight.     

In map-view resources for any given mineral horizon often occur in multiple 'pods'.  

Individual pods are then compiled per mineral horizon, summed and categorized by level 

of confidence (Measured, Indicated, or Inferred) using the criteria discussed in Section 

14.1.  The resource calculation process is streamlined using the same GIS software in which 

the mapping and GT contouring took place.    

As is evident, the GT contour method for resource estimation is dependent on competent

roll front geologists for accurate correlation and accurate contour depiction of the mineral 

body.  Nonetheless, uranium industry experience has shown that the GT contour method 

remains the most dependable for reliable estimation of resources for roll front uranium 

deposits.   

Figure 14.1 illustrates the outlines of mineral occurrences in the Dewey-Burdock Property 

defined by the 0.2/0.50 GT contours.

 Audit of Mineral Resources 

In order to audit the resources calculation process for Dewey-Burdock, all data for this 

project was loaded into Vulcan software.  The pod polygons were originally AutoCAD .dxf 

files and the drillhole data was stored in an Excel spreadsheet.  The pod polygons and the 

drillhole database were directly imported into Vulcan.  Vulcan performs several checks for 

data accuracy including looking for overlapping intervals.  During the import of the 

drillhole database, several instances of overlapping gamma intervals within individual 

drillholes were found and corrected. 

14.5.1 Resource Pod Checking 

Each pod representing a resource for the Dewey-Burdock project was reviewed for accurate 

representation of drillhole results.  For each pod, every drillhole used to create the shape of 

that pod was checked to confirm assay results both above the mineral cutoff grade thickness 

of 0.5 for indicated pods and 0.2 for inferred pods as well as that those results were at the 

correct elevation for each layer.  Contours within each pod were evaluated to ensure assay 

values for each drillhole were properly represented.  The square footage of each pod was 

cross-checked to show that the square footage calculated by the Vulcan software program 

was the same as what was reported as resource.  Both average grade thickness and pounds 

in resource were calculated independently and checked against the reported Dewey-

Burdock resource. 

Figure 14.2: Sample of Audited Pod 

 

All data checking was done using the Excel drillhole database provided by Azarga.  Using 

Vulcan, each drillhole influencing the shape of the selected pod was located and labeled 

with its Hole ID.  Each of these drillholes was then referenced in the database where the 

elevation and grade thickness were reviewed for correctness.

14.5.2 Resource Pounds Checking 

For each polygon, the pounds reported as resource were also checked.  This was done by 

calculating the square footage for each polygon in Vulcan.  The square footage from Vulcan 

was then cross-referenced to the square footage used in the resource calculation as well as 

the square footage reported on the map to ensure that all areas were correct.  Pounds were 

calculated using the formula below: 

Pounds = (average grade thickness x pod square footage x 20)/16 

The average grade thickness reported in the resource was used for the calculation.  The two 

constants are 20, used for units conversion of percent grade and tons to pounds, and a 

tonnage factor of 16 cubic feet per ton.  The average grade thickness reported in the resource 

was calculated using the square footage between each contour.  For auditing purposes, this 

number was checked by back calculating the reported pounds using the following formula: 

Average Grade Thickness = (pounds x 16)/(square feet x 20) 

Table 14.1 below shows the compilation of cross-checked data for pod F12-6. As indicated 

in this table, the resource audit confirms the original resource estimate.  

Table 14.1: Mineral Audit Sample 

 

14.5.3 Resource Classification Confirmations 

Dewey-Burdock resources were classified as measured, indicated and inferred based on 

drill spacing. Audited polygons were correctly classified based on drill spacing.  Only areas 

with mineralized drill holes within approximately 150 feet of each other and on the same 

horizon were classified as indicated and those at greater distance than 150 feet of each other 

were classified as inferred.  

The most recent and all relevant data was used in the calculation of this mineral resource.  

The preparation of this resource report was supervised by a qualified person. 

14.5.4 Statistical Analysis 

A small dataset of 166 holes from the Fall River area were evaluated individually for 

statistical information.  This dataset consisted of only mineral grade zones used in the 

contouring of Fall River pods.  A separate drillhole database was created in Vulcan and 

from this database, a composite database was created.  The composite database held a single 

record for each drillhole with the location and total grade thickness of all mineral grade 

intervals flagged for a single Fall River zone.  The minimum grade thickness was 0.13,

is a graph showing the distribution of composited grade thickness for the Fall River holes.

Geostatistics were run on this dataset to determine the optimum drillhole spacing.  The 

semivariogram below shows two groups of drillholes both indicating that a drillhole 

spacing of about 75 feet is ideal.

14.5.5 Results and Recommendations 

Every pod used for Dewey-Burdock resource calculations has been reviewed and all errors 

corrected.  All corrections were recorded in a spreadsheet that documented the solution as 

well as a checked final product.  

The method for contouring around drillholes was correct.  Data errors, typos, and flagging 

changes were caught and corrected.  This resulted in the shape of many of the pods changing 

during this process. 

The method of calculating resources was also correct and very few errors were found in 

this stage of the process.  Resources were recalculated for all pods where errors required 

either data or shape changes. 

 Summary of Mineral Resources 

The deposits within the Project area contain Measured (M) resources of 554,000 tons at an 

average grade of 0.33 percent U3O8, Indicated (I) resources of 992,000 tons at a grade of 

0.21percent U3O8 for a total M&I resource of 8.58 million pounds U3O8 at a 0.5GT cutoff, 

and an Inferred resource of 586,000 tons at a grade of 0.05 percent U3O8 for a total of 

approximately 3.5 million pounds U3O8, at a 0.2GT cutoff. Mineral resources are 

summarized in Table 14.2.   

Additional inferred resources have also been identified in the Fall River formation that are 

located above the water table and are therefore considered non-ISR resources as shown 

below in Table 14.2.  These resources are provided for information only and have not been 

included in the resource estimate used in this PEA for development of the economic 

analysis.  

Table 14.2: Mineral Resource Estimate (Effective date-January 29, 2015) 

 

Note: Resources are rounded to the nearest thousandth. Resource pounds and grades of U3O8 were calculated by 

individual grade-thickness contours.  Tonnages were estimated using average thickness of resources zones 

multiplied by the total area of those zones. 

As shown in Table 14.3 below, during the process of auditing, recontouring and 

recalculation of the drillhole data used in the previous PEA (ref., SRK 2012), M&I

2Cautionary statement: This Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature, 

and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically 

to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be 

categorized as mineral reserves and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic 

assessment will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have 

demonstrated economic viability.

 MINING METHODS 

This section of the PEA presents describes extraction and uranium processing, the cost 

estimate approach and assumptions used to develop the capital costs and operating costs.  

Azarga plans to recover uranium at the Project Area using the In-Situ Recovery (ISR) 

method. The ISR method is successfully used for over four decades elsewhere in the United 

States as well as in other countries such as Kazakhstan and Australia. ISR mining was 

developed independently in the 1970s in the former USSR and the United States for 

extracting uranium from sandstone type uranium deposits that were not suitable for open cut 

or underground mining. Many sandstone deposits are amenable to uranium extraction by ISR 

mining, which is now a well-established mining method that accounted for more than 45 

percent of the world's uranium production in 2012 (ref., OECD et al., 2014). The bottle roll 

tests (see Section 13) demonstrate the potential feasibility of both mobilizing and recovering 

uranium with an oxygenated carbonate lixiviant. 

Mining dilution (rock that is removed along with the ore during the mining process) is not a 

factor with the ISR method as only minerals that can be mobilized with the lixiviant are 

recovered. There are some metals, such as vanadium, that can be mobilized with the lixiviant 

and can potentially dilute the final product if not separated before packaging. If vanadium 

occurs in high enough concentration, it can be economically separated and sold as a separate 

product. However, as discussed in Section 13, vanadium is not considered a dilutant or a 

product in this PEA. 

Many impacts typically associated with conventional uranium mining and milling processes 

can be avoided by employing uranium ISR mining techniques. The ISR benefits are 

substantial in that no tailings are generated, surface disturbance is minimal in the well fields, 

and restoration, reseeding, and reclamation can begin during operations. As a particular well 

field is depleted, groundwater restoration will begin immediately after, significantly 

reducing both the time period of post-production restoration, and the cumulative area not 

restored at any point in time. At the end of the project life, affected lands and groundwater 

will be restored as dictated by permit and regulatory requirements. 

 Geotechnical and Hydrological Mine Design and Plans 

16.1.1 Wellfields 

Well fields are the groups of wells, installed and completed in the mineralized zones that 

are sized to effectively target delineated resources and reach the desired production goals. 

One or more header houses controls the operation of each well field.  The mineralized 

zones are located within the geologic sandstone units where the leaching solutions are 

injected and recovered via injection and recovery wells in an ISR well field. 

The Project Area is divided into two Resource Areas – Dewey and Burdock.  Figure 4.2 

illustrates the resource areas, their boundaries and proposed trunk lines.  Each of these 

Resource Areas is further subdivided into well fields. Each well field is serviced by several 

header houses depending on its size.  Across the entire Project Area, Azarga estimates the 

average flow of individual production wells will be approximately 20 gpm, with each 

header house planned to produce approximately 500 gpm. 

The resource areas are divided into well fields for scheduling development work, which also 



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 80 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

allows the establishment of specific baseline data, monitoring requirements, and restoration 

criteria. Each well field consists of a potentially mineable resource block representing an 

area that will be developed, produced and restored as a unit.  In the revised estimate as a part 

of this PEA 16 such well fields are estimated throughout the Project Area. Several well 

fields may be in production at any one time with additional well fields in various states of 

development and/or restoration. Hydro-stratigraphic unit restoration of a well field will 

begin immediately after mining in the well field is complete.  

Well fields will typically be developed based on conventional five-spot patterns. Injection 

and production wells within a well field will be completed in the mineralized interval of 

only one mineralized zone at any one time. Injection and production wells will be completed 

in a manner to isolate the screened uranium-bearing interval. Production zone monitor wells 

will be located in a pattern around the well field or units with the completion interval open 

to the entire production zone. Overlying and underlying monitor wells will also be 

completed in the hydro-stratigraphic units immediately above and below the production 

zone to monitor and minimize the potential for vertical lixiviant migration.  Overlying 

monitor wells will be completed in all overlying units and underlying wells will be 

completed in the immediately underlying unit unless the well field immediately overlies 

the Morrison formation, in which case Azarga has demonstrated that the Morrison is 

sufficiently thick and continuous such that NRC will not require excursion monitoring 

beneath the Morrison. 

16.1.2 Well Field Pattern 

The Burdock resource area is estimated to include eleven well fields on approximately 

4.2 million square feet (93 acres). There will be approximately 500 conventional five-

spot square patterns, 100ft x 100ft in dimension. Actual pattern geometry may easily vary 

from 50ft x 50ft to 150ft x 150ft depending upon actual field conditions. Azarga expects 

to delineate on average, a 100ft x 100ft grid.  

The Dewey resource area is estimated to consist of five well fields extending over 

approximately 3.2 million square feet
 
(73 acres). Pending future changes that will reflect a 

clearer understanding of site specifics such as permeability variations and well performance, 

there will be approximately 369 conventional five-spot square patterns, 100ft x 100ft in 

dimension. Actual pattern geometry may easily vary from 50ft x 50ft to 150ft x 150ft 

depending upon actual field conditions. Azarga expects to delineate on average, a 100ft x 

100ft grid. 

Perimeter monitor wells will be located approximately 400ft beyond the well field perimeter 

with a maximum spacing of 400ft between wells.  In addition, internal monitor wells will 

be located within the wellfield, at a rate of approximately one per four acres to monitor 

overlying or underlying hydro-stratigraphic units where required by permit. 

Each injection well and production well will be connected to the respective injection or 

production manifold in a header house. The manifolds will route the leaching solutions to 

pipelines, which carry the solutions to and from the ion exchange columns located in the 

CPP or Satellite facility.  Flow meters, control valves, and pressure gauges in the individual 

well lines will monitor and control the individual well flow rates. Well field piping will 

typically be high-density polyethylene pipe, as is appropriate to properly and safely convey 

the mining solutions.

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

In order to effectively recover the uranium, and also to complete the groundwater 

restoration, the wells will be completed so they can be used as either injection or recovery 

wells, allowing flow direction to be reversed at any time during the production or 

restoration phases of the Project.  A slightly greater volume of water (approximately one 

percent) will be recovered from the mineralized resource zone hydro-stratigraphic unit than 

the volume injected (bleed) in order to create an inward flow gradient towards the recovery 

wells to minimize the potential for excursions of lixiviant from the wellfields.  

16.1.3 Well Completion 

The Authors understand that Azarga intends to perform delineation drilling in each 

proposed resource area prior to installing the injection and recovery wells to better define 

mineral resources for design of well fields.  This allows the designing geologist to 

understand in greater detail the width, depth, and thickness of the mineralized zone and the 

depth of the underlying shale aquitard prior to specifying the screen interval for the 

injection and recovery wells, which optimizes the locations of specific injection and 

recovery wells.  As the drilling density is at times less than 100 ft between historic drill 

holes, it may be possible to reduce this cost and place more reliance on historic data in the 

delineation process. 

A well field will consist of patterns of recovery and injection wells (e.g., the pattern area) 

within a ring of perimeter monitor wells.  These monitor wells will be used to detect 

horizontal excursions, if any, of the groundwater-based leaching solutions away from the 

mineralized zone.  Internal monitor wells will also be completed in the overlying and 

underlying hydro-stratigraphic unit, as necessary, to detect vertical excursions should they 

occur.  Inside the wellfield area, wells will be installed and completed in the mineralized 

zone to provide baseline water quality information prior to the mining process and to gauge 

groundwater restoration performance after mining is complete.   

Pilot holes for monitor, recovery and injection wells will be drilled through the target 

completion interval.  The hole will be logged, reamed, casing set, and cemented to isolate 

the completion interval. Recovery and injection wells are planned to be under-reamed as 

part of the well completion process.  After under-reaming, setting the screen and installing 

a gravel filter pack, the well will be air lifted and/or swabbed to remove any remaining 

drilling mud and/or cuttings.   The primary goal of this well development is to allow clear 

formation water to freely enter the well screen and sustained optimal flowrates. 

16.1.4 Mechanical Integrity testing  

After a well has been completed and before it is made operational, a mechanical integrity 

test (MIT) of the well casing will be conducted. The MIT method that will be employed is 

pressure testing. 

If a well casing does not meet the MIT, the casing will be repaired and the well retested. If 

a repaired well passes the MIT, it will be employed in its intended service.. If an acceptable 

MIT cannot be obtained after repairs, the well will be plugged. A new well casing integrity 

test will also be conducted after any well repair using a down-hole drill bit or under reaming 

tool. 

Wells will again be subject to MIT every five years after start-up.

16.1.5 Well Field Production 

The proposed uranium ISR process will involve the dissolution of the water-soluble 

uranium compound from the mineralized host sands at near neutral pH ranges.  The lixiviant 

contains gaseous oxygen and carbon dioxide.  The oxygen oxidizes the uranium, which is 

then complexed with the bicarbonate formed by dissolution of carbon dioxide. The 

uranium-rich solution (typically ranging from 20 ppm to 250 ppm, but may be higher or 

lower) will be pumped from the recovery wells to the nearby CPP or Satellite facility for 

uranium concentration with ion exchange (IX) resin.  A slightly greater volume of water 

will be recovered from the mineralized zone hydro-stratigraphic unit than injected, referred 

to as "bleed", in order to create an inward flow gradient towards the well fields. Thus, 

overall recovery flow rates will always be slightly greater than overall injection rates.  This 

bleed solution will be disposed, as permitted, via injection into deep disposal wells (DDW) 

after treatment for radionuclide removal. 

The well fields will be developed within the resource areas in a sequential fashion. Figure 

16.1 indicates the order in which the well fields are proposed to be developed, put into 

production and ultimately restored and reclaimed.  See Figure 16.2 for the locations of these 

well fields. 

16.1.6 Well Field Reagents, Electricity and Propane 

Due to the varying nature of production over the life of the mine, well field reagents, 

electricity and other consumable costs are expected to vary by year.  Details regarding 

reagent and power use are discussed in Section 17. 

The mining approach is governed by how the production units are designed, the rate of 

resource recovery and the duration of the mine development, processing and closure.  The 

following describes each of these mine development and operation components. 

16.1.7 Production Rates 

The development plan is subject to change due to recovery schedules, variations with 

production unit recoveries, facility operations, economic conditions, etc.  Figure 16.1 

presents the life of mine schedule used in the evaluations in this document.  Mineral 

resource head grade is projected to average approximately 60 ppm over the entire 

production schedule.   Initial head grades in new well fields can be several hundred ppm, 

while head grades from nearly mined out well fields will be significantly lower.  As 

pregnant lixiviant is gathered from individual well fields it is co-mingled with solutions 

from other operating well fields to make up an average head grade of about 60 ppm.  Figure 

16.3 illustrates the concept for maintaining a 60 ppm head grade using cumulative decline 

curves.  Since there is a peak followed by a successive depletion in the amount of uranium 

extracted from the formation from a given well field, careful planning of mixing schemes 

from high yield well fields and lower yield well fields is required to maintain the head grade 

for the operation.

Figure 16.3: Cumulative Decline Curves 

  

Peak production of approximately one million pounds (mlbs) per year is anticipated in Year 

3 of the mine plan continuing through Year 10.  Uranium production will continue during 

Years 11 and 12 at a lower production rate with total production over the life of the mine 

estimated to be 9.69 million pounds1.  

 Header Houses 

Header houses will be used to distribute barren lixiviant to injection wells and collect 

pregnant lixiviant from recovery wells.  Each header house will be connected to two 

production trunk lines and two restoration trunk lines as needed.  The header houses will 

include manifolds, valves, flow meters, pressure gauges, instrumentation and oxygen for 

incorporation into the barren lixiviant, as required.  

Each header house is estimated to service typically 65 wells (40 injection and 25 recovery) 

depending on resource delineation.  Table 16.1 presents the current anticipated header 

house and well summary by Resource Area.

Table 16.1: Well Field Inventory 

 

16.2.1 Well Field Piping System 

Pipelines will transport the pregnant and barren lixiviant to and from the IX columns of the 

CPP and Satellite facilities. The individual well flow rates and manifold pressures will be 

monitored in the header houses. The operator will be capable of shutting down header house 

production lines from the control system. High density polyethylene (HDPE), PVC, 

stainless steel, or equivalent piping will be used in the well fields and will be designed and 

selected to meet design operating conditions.  The lines from the CPP and Satellite 

facilities, header houses and individual well lines will be buried for freeze protection and 

to minimize pipe movement as is typical for ISR mines in the area. Figure 16.2 illustrates 

the approximate location for trunk lines to/from the well fields and the CPP and Satellite 

facilities. 

 Mine Development 

The Project is proposed to be developed with a gradual phased approach. The initial facility 

will accept up to 1,000-gpm lixiviant flow rate and expand to accept 4,000-gpm. Resin will 

be transferred from IX vessels to resin trailers to be transported and sold to an off-site 

processing facility for the first few years. Once the flow rate capacity reaches 4,000-gpm, 

the Burdock Facility will be expanded to include processing capabilities up to 1.0-mlbs-pa. 

Once the Burdock resource area has been economically depleted, the IX vessels will be 

removed from the Facility and transported to Dewey, where a satellite facility will be 

constructed to mine the Dewey resource area. The proposed phases are as follows:

 Phase I – Construction of two header houses and the Burdock CPP Facility with one 
IX train (estimated 1,000 gpm, average flow rate, 1,100 gpm maximum flow 

capacity) and capability to transfer resin to a transport vehicle for off-site toll 

processing. 

 Phase II – Construction of an additional two header houses and expansion of the 
Burdock CPP Facility to two IX trains (estimated 2,000 gpm average flow rate, 

2,200gpm maximum flow capacity). 

 Phase III – Construction and operation of sufficient header houses to support 
expansion of the Burdock CPP Facility to four IX trains (estimated 4,000 gpm 

average flow rate, 4,400 gpm maximum flow capacity) 

 Phase IV – Construction and operation of sufficient header houses to support 
expansion of Burdock CPP Facility to maintain four IX trains (estimated 4,000 gpm 

average flow rate, 4,400 gpm maximum flow capacity) and on-site uranium 

processing capabilities up to approximately one million pounds per year. 

 Phase V – Construction of the Dewey Satellite Facility and transfer of IX vessels 
from the Burdock CPP Facility to the Dewey Facility. 

Mine development will begin simultaneous with construction of the Burdock CPP Facility 

and B-WF1.  Each header house is expected to produce 500 gpm of pregnant lixiviant, 

which is the minimum flow requirement for the initial Burdock CPP Facility IX circuit 

operation.  Header houses within B-WF1 will be constructed in conjunction with the Phases 

II and III as flow rate capacity to the CPP increases, see Figure 16.1. 

As the productivity or head grade from the initial header houses or well fields decreases 

below economic limits, patterns from additional header houses or well fields will be placed 

into operation in order to maintain the desired flow rate and head grade at the facilities. 

Delineation drilling will be an on-going process throughout the life of well field 

development.  As additional mineral resource information is acquired, the well field design 

and mine plan will adjust accordingly.  The project boundaries may adapt to in-coming 

delineation drilling results, subject to permitting requirements.  The specific details of 

mineral extraction may also be adjusted to ensure the highest yield of recovered minerals 

is obtained. 

16.3.1 Life of Mine Plan 

The CPP will be constructed in phases over the course of four years, see Figure 16.1.  In 

Year -1, the first phase of the CPP will be built at the Burdock site and will include the 

resin transfer system and ion exchange (IX) systems, as further discussed in Section 17.  

However, it will not contain elution, precipitation, and drying equipment until the later 

phases of the project.  Pregnant lixiviant from the well field will be processed through the 

IX columns and the resulting loaded resin will be shipped to the nearest processing plant 

where the uranium can be extracted. For this PEA that facility is assumed to be the Energy 

Fuels Resources plant at White Mesa in Utah, however an agreement with Energy Fuels 

resource has not been developed at the time of this PEA. IX Trains will be subsequently 

added to the plant each year for the next two years to allow for a ramped production 

schedule.  In Year 3, the Burdock facility will be expanded into a full CPP which will 

include all processing equipment necessary to produce and package yellowcake. The 

satellite facility at Dewey will be constructed in Year 7 and become operational by the end

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

of Year 7 in the mine plan. 

TREC has estimated the mine life based on head grade, estimated resource, flow rates and 

closure requirements for the two Resource Areas.  The first well field and header houses 

will be brought on line in conjunction with the commissioning of the CPP.  Initial flow 

rates to the CPP may range between 500 and 1,000 gpm, but as additional well fields are 

installed and brought on line the flow rate to the CPP and will increase incrementally until 

the maximum flow throughput of the CPP of 4,000 gpm is achieved.   Based on the mine 

plan, the maximum flow throughput will not be achieved until the third year after operations 

begin in the mine plan. This maximum flow throughput of 4,000 gpm is expected to be 

sustained for 8 years excluding a small dip in production during Year 7 when IX columns 

are relocated from the Burdock Facility to the Dewey Facility.  

As well fields are mined out, removed from production and put into groundwater 

restoration, new well fields will be brought on-line to maintain the maximum facility 

throughput.  This will occur until the resource recovery rates drop below what is 

economically justifiable. For the purposes of this PEA, it is assumed the well fields will be 

depleted in Year 13.   

Figure 16.1 provides the operating and production schedule for the Project as currently 

defined.  Production will generally occur at each well field consecutively and the Project 

production will occur over a period of approximately 12 years. Restoration and 

decommissioning/reclamation will also be implemented concurrently with production and 

will continue approximately four years beyond the production period. The overall mine life 

is approximately 16 years from initiation of construction activities to completion of 

restoration and decommissioning/reclamation. 

The Project cash flow analysis assumes that closure of all well fields and facilities will 

occur approximately 3.5 years after economic depletion of the uranium within the target 

mineralized zones of the resource areas, see Figure 16.1.  

 Mining Fleet and Machinery 

This Project will be performed by ISR methods as described in the previous sections.  The 

major "equipment" is the wellfield infrastructure which consists of injection, extraction and 

monitoring wells; header houses; and pipelines as described above.  The mining fleet and 

machinery is limited to relatively small surface equipment such as pickup trucks, drill rigs 

(contracted) and work over equipment for servicing the wells.  The plant (CPP) consists 

primarily of tanks and pumps. Sections 17 and 21 provide an overview of the equipment 

and estimated costs.

Notes:

1) Most WFs contain multiple header houses. Production may begin in one header house while another is still under construction. Thus there will be overlap of construction and production activities in some well fields that is not depicted above.

2) Well field completion is based on completed wells required to meet production in a given year. Thus, the well fields are built on an 'as-needed' basis and may not require a full year of construction activities.

3) Phase I construction activities also accounts for pre-construction design activities.

4) All wellfield license amendments are to be completed during the permit amendment period.

 RECOVERY METHODS 

 Recovery 

The design of the Project is consistent with that of currently and historically operating 

ISR facilities.  It includes no untested technologies or equipment.  

TREC notes that the Dewey-Burdock uranium resources are potentially mineable by in-situ 

leach and recovery (ISR) mining methods, and this is the basis upon which further 

conceptual mine and process plant design are predicated. 

Recovery of the estimated mineral resource is projected at 80 percent from the mineral 

deposit placed underneath of patterns, through to feed to the plant. This value is an estimate 

based on industry experience and Azarga personnel and other Cameco personnel experience 

at comparable ISR uranium mines including  Smith Ranch and Highlands in Wyoming and 

both approximately 90 miles away from the project site.  

It is also projected that 100 percent of the resource will be placed under a mining pattern and 

an average 0.5 percent recovery will be realized during restoration thus accounting for a total 

estimated recovery of 80 percent of the total mineral resource not including any plant losses. 

Therefore, the overall potential yellowcake production is estimated to be 9.69 million 

pounds2, as shown in Table 17.1 below.

Note: Recovery factor is applied at each individual well field, thus some rounding differences may occur in 

summarization. 

The estimate of 80 percent recovery used in this PEA is based on the following: 

1. As discussed in Section 13 laboratory dissolution results ranged from 71 to 97 
percent, indicating the deposit is amenable to ISR mining methods.  Laboratory 

testing is not necessarily a direct correlation to the recovery that can be realized in 

the mine but it does provide an indication of the potential recovery that could be 

achieved.  A comparison was made between metallurgical testing for the Dewey 

Burdock project and several other uranium ISR projects, see Table 17.2.  As 

illustrated in Table 17.2, the grade and metallurgical recovery results for the Dewey 

Burdock project are generally higher than those for the other projects.  In addition, 

the generally higher metallurgical recovery results for Dewey Burdock were 

                                                 

2 Cautionary statement: This Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature, and includes 

inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 

considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no 

certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral 

reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

accomplished with fewer pore volumes as compared to the other projects.  Thus, the 

use of an 80 percent resource recovery factor, when compared to the other projects, 

is somewhat conservative and considered reasonable by the Authors.

2. Based on the operating experience of  Azarga personnel and other Cameco 
personnel at the Smith Ranch and Highland uranium ISR mines in Wyoming, it has 

been typical to achieve an 80 percent overall recovery along with head grades 

averaging 60 ppm. 

3. In addition, other sources have been identified and are included in Table 17.3 which 
indicate that similar recovery rates have been realized at other operations. Table 

17.3 presents recovery values reported by other uranium ISR operations for projects 

in the vicinity of the Dewey-Burdock project. 

4. The World Nuclear Association has stated that in the U.S. the most successful 
projects have achieved recovery of about 80 percent, the minimum is about 60 

percent. (ref., WNA, 2014)".

Therefore, for the purpose of this PEA, it is the author's opinion that Azarga's assumed head 

grade of 60 ppm and uranium recovery of 80 percent of the estimated resource are reasonable 

estimates. 

The proposed, fully constructed CPP will have four major process circuits:  the uranium 

recovery/extraction circuit (IX); the elution circuit to remove the uranium from the IX resin; 

a yellowcake precipitation circuit; and the dewatering, drying and packaging circuit.  The 

Satellite facility will include IX and resin transfer systems to provide loaded resin to the 

CPP for removal of uranium from the resin and further processing at the CPP.

 Processing Plant Designs  

One CPP and one Satellite Facility are proposed for the project.  The CPP will be located at the 

Burdock site and the Satellite Facility will be located at the Dewey site. The distance between 

the two facilities is approximately four miles, see Figure 4.2.  The CPP and Satellite facility 

general arrangements are provided in Figures 17.2 and 17.3, respectively. 

Table 17.4 provides the conceptual design criteria for the Dewey-Burdock project. These 

conceptual production values were used in the conceptual design of the CPP, Satellite plant and 

for the economic analysis of this project. 

Table 17.4: Summary of Design Criteria for Dewey-Burdock Project 

  
1 Cautionary statement: This Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature, and includes inferred mineral resources that are 
considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral 

reserves and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do 

not have demonstrated economic viability.    

The CPP will be constructed in phases over the course of four years.  In Years -1 and 1, the 

first phase of the CPP will be designed and built at the Burdock site and will include the resin 

transfer system and ion exchange (IX) systems.  Pregnant lixiviant from the well field will be 

processed through the IX columns and the resulting loaded resin will be shipped to the nearest 

processing plant where the uranium can be extracted. IX Trains will be subsequently added to 

the plant each year for the next two years to allow for a ramped production schedule.  In Year 

3 the Burdock facility will be expanded (operational in Year 4) into a full CPP which will 

include all processing equipment necessary to produce and package yellowcake. The satellite 

facility at Dewey will be constructed in Year 7 and become operational in Q4 of Year7 in the 

mine plan. 

The Dewey Satellite facility will recover all obtainable resources from the Dewey well fields.  

IX vessels will be moved from the Burdock CPP to the Dewey Satellite Facility, as needed.   

Loaded resin from the Dewey Satellite facility will be transported to the CPP by truck for 

further processing.

The Satellite Facility will be capable of processing 4,000 gpm of lixiviant. The average

the Satellite Facility and the CPP.  

The CPP will contain anion exchange circuit, an elution circuit, a precipitation circuit, and a

precipitation, product washing/filtering, drying and processing circuits will be capable of 

producing more than 2,857lbs U3O8/d (1Mlbs/yr). 

17.2.1 Ion Exchange 

A total of four pressurized IX trains will be used over the life of the mine.  The first IX train will 

be installed prior to the start of production in Year 1, and additional trains will be added annually 

through Year 2.  The plant will have four trains during full production capacity which are capable 

of producing 1,000,000 lb U3O8 per year.   Each vessel is designed to contain a 500 cubic foot 

batch of anionic ion exchange resin. The vessels will be configured in parallel trains of two 

columns operating in a series each, utilizing pressurized down-flow methodology for loading.  

Production and Injection booster pumps are located upstream and downstream of the trains, 

respectively. 

The vessels are designed to provide optimum contact time between pregnant lixiviant and IX 

resin.  An interior stainless steel piping manifold system will distribute lixiviant evenly across 

the resin.  The dissolved uranium in the pregnant lixiviant is chemically adsorbed onto the ion 

exchange resin, and the resultant barren lixiviant exiting the vessels should normally contain 

less than 2 ppm of uranium.  However, based on operating experience it is expected to be 

feasible to operate at a significantly lower concentration leaving the vessels.   

17.2.2 Production Bleed 

After the resource has been effectively loaded on the resin, the barren lixiviant is released 

from the vessel and passes to the injection booster pumps to be injected back into the well 

field.  A bleed is maintained in the groundwater hydro-stratigraphic unit to confine and control 

hydraulic flow patterns.  There is typically a small fraction of uranium remaining in the 

lixiviant solution prior to returning to the well field.  The bleed is directed to a smaller IX 

column known as the bleed column where a majority of the remaining fraction is loaded onto 

stripped resin.  The barren bleed is discharged at a constant flow rate to the radium treatment 

system prior to discharging into the settling ponds, which is designed for a minimum of 13 

days residence time.  Flow from the settling ponds will be tested to confirm conformance with 

discharge standards and then disposed of via the DDW.  

17.2.3 Elution Circuit 

During the initial CPP phase, loaded and regenerated resin from the IX circuit will be hauled 

to and from a tolling facility for elution extraction and subsequent processing.  Upon

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

completion of the plant expansion all processing will be performed within the CPP at the 

Burdock site.    

Following the IX circuit, loaded resin is transferred to the elution circuit where uranium is 

stripped off and resin is regenerated for recycled use.  A mixture of sodium chloride and sodium 

carbonate is added to the elution vessels to initiate uranium stripping.  Eluted resin, or barren 

resin, is then rinsed and returned to the IX vessels for further loading.  The elution process 

consists of four stages: three (3) eluant stages will contact one 500 cf batch of resin with four 

bed volumes of eluant each and one (1) rinse stage will contact the batch with four bed volumes 

of fresh water. Uranium values (as uranyl carbonate) are then contained in the rich eluate 

solution. 

17.2.4 Precipitation Circuit 

Sulfuric acid is then added to the rich eluate to bring the pH down to the range of 2 to 3 where 

the uranyl carbonate breaks down, liberating carbon dioxide and free uranyl ions. In the next 

stage, sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) is added to raise the pH to the range of 4 to 5. After 

this pH adjustment, hydrogen peroxide is added in a batch process to form an insoluble uranyl 

peroxide (UO4) compound. After precipitation, the pH is raised to approximately 7 and the 

uranium precipitate slurry is pumped to a 30ft diameter thickener. The uranium-depleted 

supernate solution overflows the thickener and is disposed of via a deep injection well. 

Solution will be treated to remove radium and other radionuclides before disposal, as required. 

The precipitation cycle procedures and methods to be employed for this project have been used 

extensively in ISR programs and in conventional uranium milling operations and is a highly 

accepted and successful method of processing uranium. 

17.2.5 Product Filtering, Drying and Packaging 

After precipitation, the uranium precipitate, or yellowcake, is removed for washing, filtering, 

drying and product packaging in a controlled area. The yellowcake from the thickener 

underflow is washed to remove excess chlorides and other soluble contaminants. The slurry is 

then dewatered in a filter press and the filter cake is transferred in an enclosed conveyor 

directly to the yellowcake dryer. 

The yellowcake will be dried in a low temperature (<300°F) vacuum dryer; which is totally 

enclosed during the drying cycle and is heated by circulating thermal fluid through an external 

jacket. The off-gases generated during the drying cycle, which is primarily water vapor, is 

filtered to remove entrained particulates and then condensed. Compared to conventional high 

temperature drying by multi-hearth systems, this dryer has no significant airborne particulate 

emissions. 

The dried yellowcake is packaged into 55gal drums for storage before transport by truck to a 

conversion facility. 

17.2.6 Radium Removal from Wastewater 

Wastewater discharged from processing operations will be treated to remove radionuclides 

before disposal via the DDW. Conventional treatment for radium removal is traditionally done 

with barium chloride (BaCl2) treatment, resulting in the precipitation of a sludge that can be 



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 98 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

separated to decrease total volume for disposal. To achieve the separation of sludge from 

wastewater, the solution is discharged to a pond for settling. It is anticipated the pond where 

settling occurs is sufficient to hold all material accumulated over the life of the project. The 

reagent tanks used in the radium removal process are placed on a curbed concrete pad to provide 

support and secondary containment. Due to the possibility of sustained below-freezing 

temperatures, the radium removal tanks will be located within the CPP.  

 Predicted Mass Balance 

Azarga developed a mass balance derived from specific project design criteria. The predicted mass 

balance results for the Dewey-Burdock IX circuit, Elution and Precipitation stage and Drying 

process were used to develop the conceptual design.  It is assumed that the head grade from the 

well field is 60 ppm, which is based on Azarga's proprietary experience at similar plants. The 

predicted flow rates and recoveries in the mass balance will produce the target annual 

yellowcake production of 1Mlb. 

 Predicted Water Balance 

Uranium ISR is a water-intensive process; therefore water is recycled through the system to 

reduce water usage. The brine disposal system design is also dependent on the amount and 

quality of the wastewater produced. The wastewater disposal option investigated for the 

Dewey-Burdock project was deep well disposal. 

In summary, the Dewey-Burdock project water balance is based on a production flow rate of 4,000 

gpm which includes approximately 40 gpm of bleed flow to the DDW.  The CPP will see a water 

use of approximately 12 gpm from the local fresh water supply well.  Restoration activities 

will include 250 gpm feed to the RO, with 175 gpm returned to the wellfield and 75 gpm to 

the DDW. Make-up water from a Madison well will be used to minimize wellfield drawdown 

if necessary. 

As mentioned earlier, the production well field is expected to require less than one percent 

bleed (40 gpm) in order to maintain favorable hydraulic conditions; however, the disposal 

system has a capacity to dispose approximately three percent (127 gpm). 

 Equipment Characteristics and Specifications  

As of the date of this report, a preliminary design has been completed for the Project facilities 

and equipment.  However, based on TREC and Azarga's experience on similar ISR projects, 

the type, size and amount of equipment required to implement the Project is very well known 

and includes recent pricing from other similar projects.  The equipment described above in this 

Section and Section 21 were used to develop the CAPEX and OPEX costs presented herein.   

Major required mobile equipment will include resin haul tractors and trailers to deliver loaded 

resin from the satellite facility to the central processing plant, pump hoists, cementers, forklifts, 

pickups, logging trucks, and generators. In addition, several pieces of heavy equipment will be 

on site for excavation of mud pits, road maintenance, and reclamation activities. Azarga will 

lease mobile equipment for a five year period. 

Product Handling and Storage - The yellowcake drying and packaging stations will be 

segregated within the processing plant for worker safety. Dust abatement and filtration

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

equipment will be deployed in this area of the facility. Storage of yellowcake drums will be in 

a dedicated and locked storage room while they await transport. 

Transport - Following standard industry protocols, yellowcake will be transported in 55 gal 

steel drums. The shipment method will be via specifically licensed trucking contractor. 

Approximately 212 shipments are estimated from the Dewey-Burdock project of the life of the 

mine based upon the present resource estimate. 

Liquid Waste Disposal - Azarga retained Petrotek Engineering Corp. to prepare a UIC Class 

V permit application (ref., Powertech, 2012), which provides a conceptual design and cost 

estimate for deep disposal wells at the Dewey-Burdock project. The present plan is to construct 

two deep disposal wells. The target injection zones includes the Minnelusa and Deadwood 

Formations. Preliminary studies indicate that both formations are suitable for injection of 

wastewater. 

Azarga has also extensively investigated the use of land application of treated water as a 

method of disposal. For the purposes of this PEA, only deep well injection was considered in 

the economic analysis. Two Class V wells permitted under EPA are used in this economic 

assessment.   

Solid Waste Disposal - Solid wastes at an ISR facility include, but are not limited to, spent 

resin, empty packaging, tank sediments and filtration products, motor vehicle maintenance 

waste, office waste, and clothing. All waste materials will be reviewed and entered into waste 

stream classifications on site. 

Waste classified as non-contaminated (non-hazardous, non-radiological) will be disposed of in 

the nearest permitted sanitary waste disposal facility. Waste classified as hazardous (non-

radiological) will be segregated and disposed of at the nearest permitted hazardous waste 

facility. Radiologically contaminated solid wastes, that cannot be decontaminated, are 

classified as 11.e (2) byproduct material. This waste will packaged and stored on site 

temporarily, and periodically shipped to a licensed 11.e (2) byproduct waste facility or a 

licensed mill tailings facility. 

 Energy, Water and Process Material Requirements 

17.6.1  Energy Requirements 

Estimates used in the evaluation presented in this document assume the consumption of 

approximately 1 MBTUH (million British thermal units per hour) of propane to operate one 

dryer and assume the use of two dryers running for six hours per day each.  To heat the CPP 

and satellite plant during winter months, an estimated 4.4 MBTUH of propane is required.  

Additionally, this PEA estimates 13 million kWh annually of electricity will be necessary to 

operate the CPP and the well fields during peak production with simultaneous mining and 

restoration activities. 

17.6.2 Water Requirements 

As previously mentioned, bleed from the lixiviant will be routed to RO treatment, and 

permeate will be re-introduced to the injection stream or disposed of. Fresh water will be 

supplied from a Madison formation well and used for process make-up, showers, domestic

uses, and will be available for plant wash-down and yellowcake wash.  Approximately 1.9 

gpm of fresh water is anticipated to suffice this demand.  

17.6.3 Process Material Requirements 

Chemicals that are anticipated to be used during processing and the assumed annual peak 

production consumption rates listed in the table below.  There may be small quantities of other 

chemicals used at the site which are not listed in the table below. 

Table 17.5: Estimated Chemical Consumption Rates 

 

The different types of chemicals will be stored, used and managed so as to ensure worker and 

environmental safety in accordance with standards developed by regulatory agencies and 

vendors. The sulfuric  acid  and  hydrogen  peroxide  storage  areas  will  include  secondary  

containment. Sodium hydroxide and the various acid and caustic chemicals are of potential 

concern and will be stored and handled with care.   To prevent unintentional releases of 

hazardous chemicals and limit potential impacts to the public and environment, Azarga will 

implement its internal operating procedures consistent with federal, state and local 

requirements.

 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

The basic infrastructure (power, water and transportation) necessary to support an ISR mining 

operation at the proposed Project is located within reasonable proximity of the site as further 

described below.  

 Utilities 

18.1.1 Electrical Power 

The Black Hills Electric Cooperative is anticipated to be the power provider for the project.  It 

has been established that the most cost effective power source for the project is from a substation 

located in Edgemont, South Dakota.  Approximately 15 miles of new 69 kV power line is 

necessary to provide power to the plant.  Main power for the Dewey-Burdock project will be 

distributed from a new substation located at the County road 6463 tie in point along highway 

18.  From the substation, power will be carried by overhead distribution lines to medium voltage 

transformers located near the CPP and Satellite sites.  

The project will utilize a smaller overhead powerline, currently available in the vicinity of the 

project location for construction and the first two years of operation, thereby deferring the cost 

of installing the new 69kV line from Edgemont to the project site for two years.  The currently 

available line has capacity for the processing facility and well field loads during the first two 

years of operation and ramp-up, but capacity will be exceeded during Year 3.  Costs for an 

upgrade and extension of the existing line for construction and the first two years of operation 

have been accounted for in Year -1 in this study, and costs for the new 69kV line have been 

incorporated into this study during Year 2. 

Smaller loads will have a transformer that will reduce from 480 volts to 208/120 volts as 

required.  All three-phase motors will be started and controlled through standard MCCs.  A 

lock-out point will be provided for each motor and the driven machinery as required by the 

National Electrical Code (NEC).  

18.1.2 Domestic and Utility Water Wells 

Two water wells are necessary to provide domestic water to both the CPP and Satellite plant.  

Geological testing has identified the nearest accessible domestic water supply to be 

approximately 3,000 feet below the surface in the Madison Formation.  Water from the 

Madison wells will be pumped to the plant and stored in either the utility water tank or the 

domestic water tank.  The utility water tank will provide make-up water for plant processing 

circuits, while the domestic water tank will provide water for items such as showers, toilets, 

sinks emergency stations, etc.  A chlorination system is not anticipated to be installed. All 

drinking water will be brought to the site from appropriate off-site sources.  

18.1.3 Sanitary Sewer 

A gravity absorption field septic system, will be located at both the CPP and satellite to receive 

effluent.  The systems will be designed in accordance with state and local health and sanitation 

requirements.  The systems are currently proposed to be located close to the CPP and satellite 

buildings, and will operate via gravity flow.   



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 102 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

The septic systems will be periodically maintained to prevent solids buildup in the septic tanks 

and absorption field distribution lines.  The ground surface above the absorption field will be 

maintained to prevent soil erosion and effectively divert storm water runoff.   

18.1.4 Transmission Pipelines 

As discussed in Section 16, both the pregnant lixiviant and restoration water will be 

conveyed via a series of buried pipelines ranging from 1 ½ to 24 inches in diameter.  The 

individual well flow rates and manifold pressures will be monitored in the header houses.  

These data will be transmitted to the CPP for remote monitoring through a master control 

system. High  density  polyethylene  (HDPE),  PVC, stainless steel, or equivalent piping will 

be used in the well fields and will be designed and selected to meet design operating conditions. 

The lines from the CPP, header houses and individual well lines will be buried for freeze 

protection and to minimize pipe movement. Figure 16.2 illustrates the approximate locations 

for trunk lines to/from the well fields and the Plant. 

 Transportation 

18.2.1 Railway 

The Burlington Northern Railroad runs parallel to County Road 6463 along the length of the 

project, and extends southeast to the town of Edgemont.  Rail access may be negotiated to 

facilitate transport and delivery of construction equipment and supplies.  

18.2.2 Roads 

The nearest population center to the Dewey-Burdock Project is Edgemont, South Dakota 

(population 900) located on US Highway 18, 14 mi east from the Wyoming-South Dakota state 

line. Fall River County Road 6463 extends northwestward from Edgemont to the abandoned 

community of Burdock located in the southern portion of the Dewey-Burdock project, about 

16 mi from Edgemont. This road is a two lane, all weather gravel road. Fall River County Road 

6463 continues northwest from Burdock to the Fall River-Custer county line where it becomes 

Custer County Road 769 and continues on to the hamlet of Dewey, a total distance of about 23 

mi from Edgemont. This county highway closely follows the tracks of the BNSF (Burlington 

Northern Santa Fe) railroad between Edgemont and Newcastle, Wyoming. Dewey is about 2 

mi from the northwest corner of the Dewey-Burdock project.   

An unnamed unimproved public access road into the Black Hills National Forest intersects Fall 

River County Road 6463 4.3 mi southeast of Burdock and extends northward about 4 mi, 

allowing access to the east side of the Dewey-Burdock project. About 0.9 mi northwest from 

Burdock, an unimproved public access road to the west from Fall River County Road 6463 

allows access to the western portion of the Dewey-Burdock project. Private ranch roads 

intersecting Fall River County Road 6463 and Custer County Road 769 allow access to all 

other portions of the Dewey-Burdock Project.   

Secondary access roads will be improved with added structural support and properly graded to 

reduce maintenance costs.  A small road section will be constructed to connect existing 

unimproved roads to the plant buildings for immediate access to both the Burdock CPP, and 



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 103 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

the Dewey Satellite plant.  In addition, secondary  access  roads  will  be  used  at  the  Project  

to  provide  access  to  the  header  house buildings.  The secondary access roads will be 

constructed with limited cut and fill construction and may be surfaced with small sized 

aggregate or other appropriate material. 

 Buildings 

18.3.1 Buildings and Parking Requirements 

Dedicated maintenance facilities will be located in the CPP building. In addition to maintenance 

of mobile equipment, the most commonly overhauled equipment is expected to be the 

submersible pumps utilized in the recovery wells. 

Routine maintenance shall be performed on the buildings to keep all systems in good working 

order.  Parking areas shall be periodically graded and snow removal shall be performed as 

necessary. 

18.3.2 Heating Systems 

Building heating is proposed using gas forced air heated by propane combustion.   

18.3.3 Diesel and Gasoline Storage 

Diesel and gasoline will be stored on site in individual tanks.  Both tanks will be manufactured 

for the use of fuel storage, and they will be double-walled for spill leak prevention.  A concrete 

containment area will be provided around the tanks to prevent potential environmental 

impacts.  Diesel and gasoline transfer pumps may be used to refuel vehicles, heavy equipment, 

and miscellaneous small equipment.  A fuel truck may be used to transport fuel to large 

equipment vehicles and well field operations.  

18.3.4 Laboratory 

A laboratory space will be required for testing procedures and sample analysis, as well as 

storage for sample receipts, sample preparation, chemicals, and analytical documentation.  

The laboratory will also be equipped with changing facilities and an eyewash station.  The 

building will be leased and operated from the nearby town of Edgemont in the first three years 

of production.  The plant expansion will include a new lab and office facility which will be 

used throughout the remainder of the life of mine.   

18.3.5 Maintenance Shop 

A Maintenance Shop Building will be required for storage of backup process equipment, spare 

parts, tools, special equipment, and shop space for equipment maintenance.  The building will 

be leased and operated from the nearby town of Edgemont for the life of the mine.   

 Ponds 

A wastewater stream will be produced from the process, bleed, and restoration flows at the 

CPP and must be properly disposed of by permitted wastewater systems.  Two Class V deep 



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 104 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

disposal wells will be constructed for wastewater disposal at the Burdock site.   Prior to deep 

well injection, radionuclides and solids will be removed from the stream.  A combination of 

ion exchange and radium removal in settling ponds will be used for removal of radionuclides 

including radium. A wastewater stream from the Dewey site will be pumped to the Burdock 

site for treatment and disposal. 

A design (ref., Powertech, 2016f) was completed for the wastewater impoundments, and the 

design is detailed in the Pond Design Report, dated August of 2009. The design utilized for 

this PEA includes one radium settling pond, one outlet pond, one CPP pond, one surge pond, 

and one spare pond. A summary of the report is provided in this section. 

Storage impoundments on site are designed to perform various processing and storage 

functions.  See Figure 4.2. All wastewater is treated prior to deep well injection in radium 

settling ponds and an outlet pond.   A surge pond is available for the storage of treated 

wastewater in event than the disposal well must be shut down for service or other reasons   

Process water from the CPP may be stored in the CPP pond and may be returned to the CPP 

for additional processing.  All ponds are designed to hold precipitation that falls on the ponds.  

Allowance has been made for all ponds to store water resulting from the 100-year, 24-hour 

storm event while maintaining three feet of freeboard. 

The uranium recovery process results in a waste stream of approximately 12 gpm.  Allowance 

has been made for some of this water to be stored in a central plant pond.  All precipitation 

falling directly on the pond surfaces will be stored in the ponds and disposed of via deep well 

injection. 

18.4.1 Radium Settling Pond  

A radium settling pond will be constructed at the Burdock site to allow radium to settle out of 

solution.  The settlement process is accomplished by adding barium chloride to the water. Co-

precipitation of radium occurs when natural sulfate (SO4) in the water combines with radium 

(Ra) and barium (Ba) to form RaBaSO4. The requirements for efficient settlement of solids 

out of a solution have been incorporated into the size and dimensions of the ponds and include 

the following:   

 Sufficient retention time for the settlement of radium out of solution  

 Adequate surface area to prevent the development of large surface currents  

 Pond geometry or arrangement that will prevent short circuiting of flows through the 
pond  

18.4.2 Outlet Pond  

An outlet pond has been designed for the Burdock Sites and has been sized to accommodate 

one day's production water and precipitation from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event falling 

on both the radium settling and outlet pond.  The design will be capable of storing 5.1-acre-

ft, allocated as follows: 

 2.7-acre-ft for production water from the Radium Settling Pond 

 1.7-acre-ft for the 100-year, 24-hour design storm event falling on the radium settling 
pond 

 0.4-acre-ft for the 100-year, 24-hour design storm event falling on the outlet pond 



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 105 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

18.4.3 CPP Pond 

The CPP pond is located at the Burdock Site, and has been sized to accommodate a discharge 

of 10.81 gpm over a period of one year.  The design will be capable of storing 15.9-acre-ft, 

allocated as follows: 

 15.2-acre-ft for brine from the CPP  

 0.7-acre-ft for the 100-year, 24-hour design storm event 

18.4.4 Surge Pond 

The surge pond will be located at the Burdock Site, and has been sized to accommodate 8.3 

acre-feet.  The  surge  pond  will  provide  surge  capacity  for  treated  liquid  waste flowing 

out of the outlet ponds. It has been sized to accommodate approximately 16 days of water 

production.  

 8.3-acre-ft for surge capacity from the outlet pond  

18.4.5 Spare Pond 

A spare pond has been designed to be identical to the radium settling pond, which are the 

largest double-lined ponds in the system. The spare pond is located adjacent to the radium 

settling pond and has been designed to accommodate water from any of the radium settling or 

central plant ponds, should additional storage be required.  

The spare storage pond has been designed sufficient to provide a temporary replacement for 

any operating ponds should it need to be taken out of service for repair.

 MARKET STUDIES 

This section discusses the basis for the uranium commodity pricing used in the PEA and the 

status of any contracts for commodity pricing and/or project implementation.   

The uranium commodity markets are volatile. Due to the increased focus on nuclear energy, 

and the potential for uranium supply issues related to expansion of the industry, long-term 

contract prices are higher than the spot price. Long-term contract prices have some variance 

due to individual pricing terms and potential for adjustment over the sales period. 

Pricing for a PEA can be determined by several approaches.  One is to use a three year trailing 

average, another is to use current spot price and yet another is to use analyst forecasts.  The 

three year trailing average and current spot price approaches are considered overly 

conservative due to the incident at Fukushima Daiichi which had a significant depressive 

impact over several years on uranium prices due to shutdown of all reactors in Japan.  This 

resulted in a combined decrease in demand and readily available increase of low cost fuel 

from the inventories of the shutdown nuclear reactors.  This anomaly impacted the three year 

trailing average and current spot price which are, therefore, not considered reasonable 

approximations for the future price of uranium and not consistent with price trends prior 

Fukushima.   

Demand for uranium is expected to continue to rise for the foreseeable future. Although the 

Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident has temporarily affected nuclear power projects and 

policies in some countries, nuclear power has become a strategic imperative in many countries 

due to air pollution caused by other sources of base load electricity and it remains a growing 

part of the global energy mix. Several governments have plans for new nuclear power plant 

construction, with the strongest expansion expected in China, India, the Republic of Korea and 

the Russian Federation (ref., OECD, 2014) .  

Uranium analysts are forecasting that the uranium price will increase significantly from its 

current level starting around 2015-2016 as a result of increased demand and supply shortages.  

An average uranium price of $65 per pound of U3O8 based on an average of recent market 

forecasts by various professional institutes was determined to be an acceptable price for the 

PEA based on the Project's expected startup date in 2016, see Table 19.1.   

Azarga has no contracts in place for sale of product from the project.  Contracts for yellowcake 

transportation, handling and sales will be developed prior to commencement of commercial 

production.

Table 19.1: Market Spot and Long Term Price Forecasts 

 

 Product Markets, Analysis, Studies and Pricing Reviewed by the QP   

Uranium does not trade on an open market like other commodities such as gold, silver 

and copper. Sales of uranium as U3O8 are predominantly contracted on a medium and long 

term basis with prices determined by a pre-set formulae linked to the reported long term 

and/or spot prices and are typically significantly higher than spot prices.   Azarga has not 

entered into nor have they initiated negotiations on a contract for uranium sales.  For this PEA, 

Azarga has adopted a price forecast based on averaging uranium price forecasts developed by 

several investment banks and forecast consulting firms.   Table 19.1 summarizes recent 

uranium price forecasts by these analysts.   This table demonstrates that spot price forecasts 

range from $45 to $80 and average between $56 and $67 for the near term of 2015 to 2017 

and a long term average price of $68.  Based on the uranium price forecast  data  in  Table 

19.1,  the  PEA  has  assumed  U3O8 production  is  sold  at a price of $65 per pound.  The 

Author agrees with the pricing scenario used in this PEA. 

The Author has reviewed the referenced reports identified in Table 19.1 as well as other 

relevant publications such as the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency Uranium 2014: Resources, 

Production and Demand publication dated 2014.  The review indicates that the common 

consensus for all sources is that uranium demand will rise based on current and projected 

nuclear energy needs. Uranium demand is a function of its consumption for the generation 

of electricity in nuclear reactors. By the year 2035, world nuclear electricity generating 

capacity is projected to grow from 372 GWe net (at the end of 2013) to between 399 GWe 

net in the low demand case and 678 GWe net in the high demand case, increases of 7 percent 

and 82 percent respectively. Accordingly, world annual reactor-related uranium requirements 

are projected to rise from 59,270 tonnes of uranium metal (tU) at the end of 2013 to between 

72,205 tU and 122,110 tU by 2035 (ref., OECD et al., 2014).  

Meeting projected demand will require timely investments in new uranium production 

facilities because of the long lead times (typically in the order of ten years or more in most

producing countries) required to develop production facilities that can turn resources into 

refined uranium ready for nuclear fuel production. 

Given the variability of uranium sales price, and potential for large swings, the sales price 

has significant impacts to the economic analysis. A sensitivity analysis is provided in 

Section 22 which illustrates the potential variance in NPV and IRR based on fluctuations 

in the price of uranium.  

 Contracts 

Azarga has no contracts in place for sale of uranium product for this project nor have they 

initiated any sales agreement negotiations.  

No other contracts are in place or being negotiated for construction of the project.  These will 

be initiated upon completion of project financing and are anticipated to be typical industry 

contracts for construction and equipment, material and chemical supply.

 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

 Environmental Studies 

Azarga (Powertech) conducted an environmental baseline data collection program on the 

Dewey-Burdock site from July 2007 to September 2008. An independent, third-party 

contractor directed sampling and analysis activities to characterize pre-mining conditions 

related to water, soils, air, vegetation, and wildlife of the site and surrounding areas.  

In addition to the baseline environmental data collected by the third-party contractor, U.S. 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff prepared a Generic Environmental Impact 

Statement (GEIS) (ref., USNRC, 2009) for western-area license applicants that addressed 

common environmental issues associated with the construction, operation, and 

decommissioning of ISR facilities, as well as ground water restoration at such facilities. The 

GEIS served as a starting point for the site-specific environmental review of the Dewey-

Burdock license application. Findings of the site-specific assessment are presented in NRC's 

Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) for the Dewey-Burdock Project 

(ref., USNRC, 2014). 

Results of the baseline studies, GEIS and FSEIS indicate that environmental concerns are 

unlikely for the Dewey-Burdock Resource Areas. 

20.1.1 Potential Well Field Impacts 

The injection of treated groundwater as part of uranium recovery or as part of restoration of 

the production zone is unlikely to cause changes in the underground environment except to 

restore the water quality consistent with baseline or other NRC approved limits and to reduce 

mobility of any residual radionuclides. Further, industry standard operating procedures, which 

are accepted by NRC and other regulating agencies for ISR operations, include a regional 

pump test prior to licensing, followed by more detailed pump tests after licensing for each 

individual area where uranium will be recovered prior to its production.  

During ISR operations, potential environmental impacts of well field operations include 

consumptive use, horizontal fluid excursions, vertical fluid excursions, and changes to 

groundwater quality in production zones (ref., USNRC, 2009). Through analyses in the GEIS 

and continued in the FSEIS, NRC staff concluded that impacts of well field operations on the 

environment will be small. That is, well field operations will have environmental effects that 

are either not detectable or are so minor that they will neither destabilize nor noticeably alter 

any important attribute of the area's groundwater resources (ref., USNRC, 2014).  

NRC staff concluded the potential environmental impact of consumptive groundwater use 

during well field operation will be small at the Dewey-Burdock Project because such 

consumptive use will result in limited drawdown near the project area, water levels will 

recover relatively rapidly after groundwater withdrawals cease and it is dependent upon a State 

water appropriation permit. The State has recommended approval of the permit after 

considering important site-specific conditions such as the proximity of water users' wells to 

well fields, the total volume of water in the production hydro-stratigraphic units, the natural 

recharge rate of the production hydro-stratigraphic units, the transmissivities and storage 



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 110 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

coefficients of the production hydro-stratigraphic units, and the degree of isolation of the 

production hydro-stratigraphic units from overlying and underlying hydro-stratigraphic units. 

NRC staff also concluded the potential environmental impact from horizontal excursions at 

the proposed Dewey-Burdock ISR Project will be small. This is because i) EPA will exempt 

a portion of the uranium-bearing aquifer from USDW classification according to the criteria 

under 40 CFR 146.4, ii) Powertech is required to submit well field operational plans for NRC 

and EPA approval, iii) inward hydraulic gradients will be maintained to ensure groundwater 

flow is toward the production zone, and iv) Azarga's NRC-mandated groundwater monitoring 

plan will ensure that excursions, if they occur, are detected and corrected.  

Similarly, potential impacts from vertical excursions were concluded by NRC staff to be 

small. The reasons given for the conclusion included i) uranium-bearing production zones in 

the Fall River Formation and Chilson member of the Lakota Formation and are hydrologically 

isolated from adjacent aquifers by thick, low permeability layers (i.e., the overlying Graneros 

Group and underlying Morrison Formation), ii) there is a prevailing upward hydraulic gradient 

across the major hydro-stratigraphic units, iii) Azarga's required mechanical integrity testing 

program will mitigate the impacts of potential vertical excursions resulting from borehole 

failure, and iv) Azarga has committed to properly plugging and abandoning or mitigating any 

previously drilled wells and exploration holes that may potentially impact the control and 

containment of well field solutions within the proposed project area.  

Lastly, potential impacts of well field operations on groundwater quality in production zones 

were concluded by NRC staff to be small because Azarga must initiate groundwater 

restoration in the production zone to return groundwater to Commission-approved background 

levels, EPA MCL's or to NRC-approved alternative water quality levels at the end of ISR 

operations. 

20.1.2 Potential Soil Impacts 

NRC staff have concluded that potential impacts to soil during all phases of construction, 

operation, hydro-stratigraphic unit, and decommissioning of the Dewey-Burdock Project will 

be small (ref., USNRC, 2014). 

During construction, earthmoving activities associated with the construction of the Burdock 

central plant and Dewey satellite plant facilities, access roads, well fields, pipelines, and 

surface impoundments will include topsoil clearing and land grading. Topsoil removed during 

these activities will be stored and reused later to restore disturbed areas. The limited areal 

extent of the construction area, the soil stockpiling procedures, the implementation of best 

management practices, the short duration of the construction phase, and mitigative measures 

such as reestablishment of native vegetation will further minimize the potential impact on 

soils.  

During operations, the occurrence of potential spills during transfer of uranium-bearing 

lixiviant to and from the Burdock central plant and Dewey satellite facility will be mitigated 

by implementing onsite standard procedures and by complying with NRC requirements for 

spill response and reporting of surface releases and cleanup of any contaminated soils.  

During groundwater restoration, the potential impact to soils from spills and leaks of treated 

wastewater will be comparable to those described for the operations phase.  



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 111 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

During decommissioning, disruption or displacement of soils will occur during facility 

dismantling and surface reclamation; however, disturbed lands will be restored to their pre-

ISR land use. Topsoil will be reclaimed and the surface will be graded to the original 

topography. 

The following proposed measures will be used to minimize the potential impacts to soil 

resources: 

 Salvage and stockpile soil from disturbed areas. 

 Reestablish temporary or permanent native vegetation as soon as possible after 
disturbance utilizing the latest technologies in reseeding and sprigging, such as 

hydroseeding. 

 Decrease runoff from disturbed areas by using structures to temporarily divert and/or 
dissipate surface runoff from undisturbed areas. 

 Retain sediment within the disturbed areas by using silt fencing, retention ponds, and 
hay bales. 

 Fill pipeline and cable trenches with appropriate material and re-grade surface soon 
after completion. 

 Drainage design will minimize potential for erosion by creating slopes less than 4 to 1 
and/or provide rip-rap or other soil stabilization controls. 

 Construct roads using techniques that will minimize erosion, such as surfacing with a 
gravel road base, constructing stream crossings at right angles with adequate 

embankment protection and culvert installation. 

 Use a spill prevention and cleanup plan to minimize soil contamination from vehicle 
accidents and/or wellfield spills or leaks 

20.1.3 Potential Impacts from Shipping Resin, Yellowcake and 11e.(2) Materials  

The Project operations will require truck shipment of resin, yellowcake and 11e.(2) materials.  

Ion Exchange Resin Shipment 

Ion exchange resin requires transportation of loaded ion exchange resins by tanker trucks to a 

central processing facility. The radiological impacts of these shipments are typically lower 

than estimated risks associated with finished yellowcake shipments because i) ion exchange 

resins are less concentrated (about 0.009 ounces uranium per gallon) than yellowcake and 

therefore will contain less uranium per shipment than a yellowcake (about 85 percent uranium 

by weight) shipment, ii) uranium in ion exchange resins is chemically bound to resin beads; 

therefore, it is less likely to spread and easier to remediate in the event of a spill, and iii) the 

total annual distance traveled by ion-exchange shipments will be less than the same for 

yellowcake shipments. The NRC regulations at 10 CFR Part 71 and the incorporated U.S. 

Department of Transportation regulations for shipping ion exchange resins, which are 

enforced by NRC onsite inspections, also provide confidence that safety is maintained and the 

potential for environmental impacts with regard to resin shipments remains small (ref. 

USNRC, 2009 and 2014). 

Yellowcake Shipment 

After yellowcake is produced at an ISR processing facility, it is transported to a conversion 

plant in Metropolis, Illinois (the only conversion facility in the United States), to produce 



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 112 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

uranium hexafluoride (UF6) for use in the production of nuclear reactor fuel. NRC and others 

have previously analyzed the hazards associated with transporting yellowcake and have 

determined potential impacts are small. Previously reported accidents involving yellowcake 

releases indicate that in all cases spills were contained and cleaned up quickly (by the shipper 

with state involvement) without significant health or safety impacts to workers or the public. 

Safety controls and compliance with existing transportation regulations in 10 CFR Part 71 add 

confidence that yellowcake can be shipped safely with a low potential for adversely affecting 

the environment. Transport drums, for example, must meet specifications of 49 CFR Part 173, 

which is incorporated in NRC regulations at 10 CFR Part 71. To further minimize 

transportation-related yellowcake releases, delivery trucks are recommended to meet safety 

certifications and drivers hold appropriate licenses (ref., USNRC, 2009 and 2014). 

11e.(2) Shipment 

Operational 11e.(2) byproduct materials (as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 

amended) will be shipped from the Dewey-Burdock Project by truck for disposal at a licensed 

disposal site. All shipments will be completed in accordance with applicable NRC 

requirements in 10 CFR Part 71 and U.S. Department of Transportation requirements in 49 

CFR Parts 171–189. Risks associated with transporting yellowcake were determined by NRC 

to bound the risks expected from byproduct material shipments, owing to the more 

concentrated nature of shipped yellowcake, the longer distance yellowcake is shipped relative 

to byproduct material destined for a licensed disposal facility, and the relative number of 

shipments of each material type. Therefore, potential environmental impacts from transporting 

byproduct material are considered small (ref., USNRC, 2009 and 2014). 

 Socioeconomic Studies and Issues 

A Socioeconomic Assessment for the Project was performed by Knight Piesold and Co. in 

2008 and updated by WWC Engineering August 2013. The Assessment's summary of the 

economic impact was as follows (ref., WWC, 2013):   

According to the economic impact analysis, the most significant benefits are the 

potential to create jobs, which will have direct and indirect effects on the local 

economies. Additional significant benefits include capital expenditures and tax 

benefits to the State of South Dakota, Custer County and Fall River County.  

Impacts to the regional housing market should be minimal because of the large 

percentage of local workers. Impacts to schools and public facilities should be 

negligible because of their present ability to absorb any associated regional influx. 

This economic impact analysis indicates that the construction and operation costs 

including capital costs of this project will result in positive economic benefits to 

the local and regional economy by the creation of hundreds of jobs and millions 

of dollars in tax revenue over the life of the project. 

The development the ISR project should present Custer and Fall River counties 

with net positive gain.

 Permitting Requirements and Status  

The three most significant permits/licenses are (1) the Source and Byproduct Materials 

License, which was issued by NRC April of 2014; (2) the Large Scale Mine Permit (LSM), to 

be issued by the South Dakota DENR; and (3) UIC Class III and V wells (injection and/or 

deep disposal), which require permits from the EPA.    

The land within the Project boundary includes mining claims on private and BLM land.  

Access to these lands, as stated in Section 2, is controlled under surface rights held by Azarga, 

or on public access BLM lands. Thus, a BLM Plan of Operations and associated NEPA 

evaluation will be completed in the form of an Environmental Assessment which will 

reference the already completed Environmental Impact Statement previously finalized by 

NRC with BLM as a cooperating agency.   

Permit/license amendments will be required for expanded well field areas covered in this PEA 

and for the purposes of this report are assumed to occur later in the project life. See the life of 

mine schedule in Section 16.  

The status of the various federal and state permits and licenses that are needed for the Project 

are summarized in Table 20.1.  Prior to the start of mining (the injection of lixiviant), Azarga 

will obtain all the following necessary permits, licenses, and approvals required by the NRC, 

DENR and EPA.  Some permits are only applicable later in the project life prior to construction 

of the Dewey satellite plant.

 Community Affairs 

Azarga has an ongoing community affairs program. . Azarga maintains routine contacts with 

landowners, local communities and businesses, and the general public.  Once the project 

commences, the senior project operational managers and environmental manager will be 

onsite at the facility, and are included in the administrative support labor costs for operations.   

There is vocal, opposition to the project by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) and 

individuals though typically not in the Edgemont area.  This has created increased regulatory 

efforts and logistics for accommodating public involvement, but at the time of this report, the 

NRC license has been issued and the State of South Dakota large scale mine permit has been 

recommended for approval.  All necessary permits for construction of the project estimated to 

be approved by the fourth quarter of 2015.   

There has already been extensive public involvement including both public hearings and 

public comment on the project.  For the NRC license, contentions from project opponents was 

heard by the Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB) who is expected to reach a decision on 

April 30th, 2015.  Azarga anticipates that the ASLB will fully support the license as issued.   

Hearings were begun for State of South Dakota permits in 2013 but were suspended pending 

completion of federal licenses.  These hearings will resume following completion of permits 

from EPA, see Table 20.1. 

 Project Closure 

20.5.1 Byproduct Disposal 

The 11e.(2) or non-11e.(2) byproduct disposal methods are discussed in detail in Section 17. 

Deep disposal wells, landfills, and licensed 11e.(2) facilities will be used depending on  waste 

classification and type. 

20.5.2 Well Abandonment and Groundwater Restoration 

Groundwater restoration will begin as soon as practicable after uranium recovery in each well 

field is completed If a depleted well field is near an area that is being recovered, a portion of 

the depleted area's restoration may be delayed to limit interference with the on- going recovery 

operations.  



April 2015 4580-2014-103 

Page 115 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

Groundwater restoration will require the circulation of native groundwater and extraction of 

mobilized ions through reverse osmosis treatment. The intent of groundwater restoration is to 

return the groundwater quality parameters consistent with that established during the pre-

operational sampling required for each well field. As previously noted, groundwater from the 

Inyan Kara at the Dewey-Burdock project does not presently meet EPA drinking water 

standards, as established in the site characterization baseline data collected by Azarga. 

Restoration completion assumes up to six pore volumes of groundwater will be extracted and 

treated by reverse osmosis.  Following completion of successful restoration activities and 

regulatory approval, the injection and recovery wells will be plugged and abandoned in 

accordance with DENR regulations. Monitor wells will also be abandoned following 

verification of successful groundwater restoration. 

20.5.3 Demolition and Removal of Infrastructure 

Simultaneous with well abandonment operations, the trunk and feeder pipelines will be 

removed, tested for radiological contamination, segregated as either solid 11e.(2) or non-

11e.(2) then chipped and transported to appropriate disposal facilities.  The header houses will 

be disconnected from their foundations, decontaminated, segregated as either solid 11e.(2) or 

non-11e.(2), and transported to appropriate disposal facilities.  The facilities' processing 

equipment and ancillary structures will be demolished, tested for radiological properties, 

segregated and either scrapped or disposed of in appropriate disposal facilities based on their 

radiological properties. 

20.5.4 Reclamation 

All disturbances will be reclaimed including, wellfields, plant sites and roads. The site will be 

re-graded to approximate pre-development contours and the stockpiled topsoil placed over 

disturbed areas.  The disturbed areas will then be seeded. 

 Financial Assurance 

Financial Surety will be required by NRC, the State of South Dakota, BLM and EPA.  The 

Project will be secured for the estimated amount of total closure costs which include 

groundwater restoration, facility decommissioning and reclamation with a bond provided by 

a broker at a rate of three percent of the surety amount until positive cash flow is achieved 

then reducing to a rate of two percent thereafter.   The annual financial surety amount is based 

on the estimated amount of annual development that would require closure in the case of 

default by the owner. The costs for Project closure and financial assurance are included in the 

economic analysis presented herein. Table 21.2 presents the closure cost summary.

 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

TREC prepared this estimate of capital and operating costs on the basis of the preliminary 

design data and assumptions described herein.  The costs were developed on a first principle 

basis, including specifications and current vendor quotes for all major pieces of equipment, 

installation and construction costs. In addition, the Author has current cost information from 

a very similar ISR project located in Wyoming for which the Author is providing design-build 

services for its construction.  Variable contingency ranging from 5 to 30 percent has been 

applied to individual materials, activities and estimates.  The weighted average of all applied 

contingency is equivalent to 12 percent over the total cost of the project.  The magnitude of 

contingency for each item was determined by how recently the quote was received, the 

historical cost volatility of the item and the level of confidence in the designated quantity, e.g., 

trunkline lengths.  This level of contingency has been substantiated on other similar sized 

construction projects for which the Author has recent experience.  Both the capital and 

operating costs are current as of the middle of 2014. The predicted level of accuracy of the 

cost estimate is +/- 25 percent.  The budget prices for the major items identified in this study 

have been sourced in the United States. 

 Capital Cost Estimates 

The capital costs (CAPEX) provided in the following tables address the development of 

facilities at both Dewey and Burdock phased in accordance to the mined development plan 

described in Section 16.  Capital cost estimates are representative of the capital and 

infrastructure costs required for the estimated resources as of the date of this report.  The 

current life of mine schedule is shown in Figure 16.1.  The life of mine schedule anticipates 

pre-production construction work will begin in Year -1.   

Detailed discussion of mining and recovery methods and associated infrastructure are 

provided in Section 16, Section 17, and Section 18. 

The following sections provide a summary of the quantities and assumptions used to develop 

the capital costs for the five phases of the project.  Table 21.1 provides a summary of initial 

capital costs, Table 21.2 summarizes the total well field capital costs spread over Years 1 

through 12, and Table 21.3summarizes the CPP and satellite plant capital costs and illustrates 

how they have been divided between each phase.  The estimated initial capital costs for the 

first two years of the Project life (Years -1 and 1) are approximately $27.0 million with 

sustaining capital costs of $135.8 million spread over the next 11 years (Years 2 through 12) 

of production, see Tables 21.1 and 22.1.

 Operating Cost Estimates 

The operating costs (OPEX), current as of the middle of 2014, have been developed by 

evaluating each process unit operation and the associated required services (chemicals, power, 

water, air, waste disposal), infrastructure (offices, change rooms shop), salary and burden, and 

environmental control (heat, air conditioning, monitoring).  The basis for the operating cost 

estimate is the life of mine schedule presented on Figure 16.1 and is based on design well field 

flows and head grade, process flow-sheets, preliminary process design, materials balance and 

estimated Project manpower requirements. The Annual Operating Cost Summary for the

Notes:

1) Plant operating labor includes labor for operating both the Burdock CPP and Dewey Satellite Plant.

2) Toll Mill Fee only applies to initial period before the Burdock CPP is expanded to include elution, precipitation and drying processes.

3) Administrative Costs provided by Azarga and include legal fees, Land & Mineral Acquisitions, NRC fees, insurance, office supplies.

4) Financial assurance is calculated as a surety with 3% annual premium required up until a positive cash flow is generated and 2% thereafter.

5) This PEA assumes all well field completion will be performed by contracted labor rather than Azarga personnel.

6) Well field materials are assumed to be procured by Azarga rather than the well field contractor.

7) Includes groundwater baseline sampling for each new well field through Year 12.

21.2.1 Personnel 

The present work force estimates for the Dewey-Burdock project during full operation of the 

Central Processing Facility, Satellite Facility, and all associated well fields is 33 full time staff. 

In general, the work force can be segregated into the following groups: administration (10 

staff), well field completion (3 staff), facilities operations (15 staff) and well field production and 

restoration (5 staff). Well field construction will be performed by contractors and it is assumed they 

will utilize approximately 13 employees.  In addition, all labor for construction of the site facilities 

will be performed by contractors which is anticipated to average approximately 35 employees per 

day during construction operations and could peak as high as 60.  Thus, at the peak of construction, 

as many as approximately 106 employees and contracted personnel could be working for the Project.  

Staff schedules will vary based upon duty; some will work a typical 8 hr day, 40 hrs per week, 

while others will work a shift schedule to cover the 24 hour operation of the facility. 

Additionally, a significant number of contracted persons are expected to work at the project on 

a full time basis to perform drilling and construction activities.  Labor costs are included in 

Tables 21.1 and 21.2 as appropriate for CAPEX labor and OPEX labor, respectively.

 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

Cautionary statement: this Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature, 
and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative 
geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable 
them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the 
preliminary economic assessment will be realized. Mineral resources that are not 
mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.   

 Principal Assumptions 

The economic analyses presented herein provide the results of the analyses for pre-U.S. 

federal income tax and estimated post U.S. federal income tax.  The only difference between 

the two scenarios is estimated U.S. federal income tax.  All other sales, property, use, 

severance and conservations taxes as well as royalties are included in both scenarios. Both 

economic analyses presented herein assume no escalation, no debt, no debt interest and no 

capital repayment.  There is no State of South Dakota corporate income tax.   

The sale price for the produced uranium as U3O8 is assumed a constant $65 per pound of U3O8 

based on an average of recent market forecasts by various professional institutes. This basis 

for this price is discussed in Section 19. 

Uranium recovery from the mineral resource was determined based on an estimated overall 

recovery factor of 80 percent of the resources as discussed in Section 17.  The production 

schedule assumes an average solution uranium grade (head grade) of 60 ppm as described in 

Sections 16 and 17.  It should be noted that significant variations in these assumptions for 

head grade and recovery can have significant impacts to the economic results presented.   

The sales for the cash flow are developed by applying the recovery factor to the resource 

estimate for the Project (Section 14).  The total uranium production as U3O8 over the life of 

the Project is estimated to be 9.69 million pounds.  The production estimates and operating 

cost distribution used to develop the cash flow are based on the mine plan schedule presented 

on Figure 16.1.   

This PEA assumes Year -1 as the Project start date.  Pre-production and capital expenses 

commence on the Project start date.  The start of production is one year after the start of 

construction, or mid Year 1, see Figure 16.1. The NPV assumes end of year discounting of 

the annual cash flows and is calculated based on a discounted cash flow. 

 Cash Flow Projection and Production Schedule 

The estimated payback is in Quarter 3 of Year 2 with the commencement of 

design/procurement activities in Quarter 2 of Year -1 and construction beginning Quarter 4 of 

Year -1. The Project is estimated to generate net earnings over the life of the project of $284.2 

million (pre-U.S. Federal income tax) and $220.9 million (post U.S. Federal income tax).  It 

is estimated that the project has an IRR of 67 percent and a NPV of $149.4 million (pre-U.S. 

Federal income tax) and an IRR of 57 percent and a NPV of $113.8_million (post U.S. Federal 

income tax) applying an eight percent discount rate, see Tables 22.1 and 22.2 below.

Figure 16.1, Section 16 presents the Project schedule, as currently defined, and was used to 

develop cash flow and economic analysis from the capital, operating and closure costs.  The 

schedule illustrates the proposed plan for production, groundwater restoration, and 

decommissioning of each well field. However, the plan is subject to change due to recovery 

rates, variations with resource head grades, processing issues, economic conditions, and other 

conditions and variables. 

 Taxes, Royalties and Other Interests 

Azarga has no contracts presently in place for production from the Dewey-Burdock project. 

This includes sales contracts, tolling agreements, or any other financial arrangements with 

other parties associated with the purchase or price of final uranium product. 

22.3.1 Federal Income Tax 

The estimate of U.S. federal income taxes for the Project are not based on past operation history 

for this project or this company and are an estimate only. At this stage of development, a 

financial structure has yet to be developed for the corporation for accurately assessing federal 

income tax liabilities. It is possible that the tax liability presented herein is overstated because 

"ring fenced" treatment of the project tax estimate does not account for the potential offsetting 

tax deductions from other debts incurred in an overall corporate financial structure.  This could 

be particularly true where other projects or expansions are likely to be funded from revenue 

from this project.   

In order to illustrate the potential impact of federal taxes, two economic models have been 

developed for this PEA, one that includes an estimate of U.S. federal income tax and one that 

does not.   Azarga does not anticipate paying federal income taxes until losses carried forward 

are utilized but which are not fully included in the estimate. In addition, reclamation costs can 

be deducted in the early years of the Project, thus also extending the time before any possible 

tax liability. Thus, these anticipated adjustments to tax liability are expected to reduce the net 

tax liability for the Project. 

22.3.2 State Income Tax 

There is no corporate income tax in South Dakota. 

22.3.3 Production Taxes 

Production taxes in South Dakota include: property tax, sales and use tax, and severance and 

conservation tax. Neither Custer nor Fall River Counties impose an Ad Valorem tax on 

minerals as of the publication of this PEA.  

As shown in Figure 16.2, the project area is divided by Custer County and Fall River County, 

and each impose their own methods of implementing property tax. The Dewey Facility will fall 

under the property tax of Custer County while the Burdock Facility will fall under Fall River 

County.  

Custer County follows a discretionary tax formula to encourage development of certain 

industrial property within the county boundaries. After construction of the Dewey Facility, a 2.1 

percent property tax will be imposed on the assessed value of the land and its permanent 

improvements for five years. However, its assessed value shall be defined as 20 percent of its 



April 2015 4580-2014-103

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

actual value in the first year, 40 percent in the second year, 60 percent in the third year, 80 

percent in the fourth year, and 100 percent in the fifth year (ref., Custer County, 2005).  

Fall River County utilizes a different tax schedule. For the purposes of attracting new business, 

Fall River taxes solely the value of the surface property for the first five years, then adds a tax 

of 2.1 percent on the assessed value of improvements of greater than $30,000 for the remainder 

of the property ownership (ref., Edgemont Herald Tribune, 2011). Since Azarga does not own 

any surface property, the property tax for the first five years after the construction of the Burdock 

Facility is zero percent. 

Purchases of equipment and supplies are subject to sales and use tax. The State imposes a four 

percent tax on retail sales and services. Project economics presented in this report have sales 

and use tax of six percent included in the capital cost estimate. 

Severance on uranium production is taxed at 4.5 percent of gross sales. Additionally, the state 

of South Dakota requires a conservation tax of 0.24 percent of gross sales for all energy 

mineral production. 

22.3.4 Royalties 

The project is subject to a cumulative 5.25 percent surface and mineral royalty. Each royalty is 

assessed on gross proceeds. 

 Sensitivity Analysis 

22.4.1 NPV and IRR v. Uranium Price (Pre-U.S. Federal Income Tax) 

This pre-U.S. federal income tax analysis is based on a variable commodity price per pound 

of U3O8 and the cash flow results presented herein.  The Project is most sensitive to changes 

in the price of uranium.  A one dollar change in the price of uranium can have an impact to 

the NPV of approximately $5.49 million based on a discount rate of eight percent.  It will also 

impact the IRR by approximately 2.01 percent.  See Figure 22.1.

This post U.S. federal income tax analysis is based on a variable commodity price per pound 

of U3O8 and the cash flow results presented herein.  The Project is most sensitive to changes 

in the price of uranium.  A one dollar change in the price of uranium can have an impact to 

the NPV of approximately $3.80 million based on a discount rate of eight percent.  It will also 

impact the IRR by approximately 1.43 percent.  See Figure 22.2.

22.4.3 NPV and IRR v. Variable Capital and Operating Cost (Pre-U.S. Federal 
Income Tax) 

The Project pre-U.S. federal income tax NPV and IRR are also slightly sensitive to changes 

in either capital or operating costs as shown on Figures 22.3 and 22.4 below (NPV and IRR 

vs Capital Cost Variation and Operating Cost Variation). A five percent change in the 

operating cost can have an impact to the NPV of approximately $3.24 million and the IRR of 

approximately 1.31 percent based on a discount rate of eight percent and a constant uranium 

price of $65.00 per pound of U3O8.   A five percent change in the capital cost can have an 

impact to the NPV of approximately $5.23 million and the IRR of approximately 4.21 percent 

based on a discount rate of eight percent and a constant uranium price of $65.00 per pound of 

U3O8.

The Project post U.S. federal income tax NPV and IRR are also slightly sensitive to changes 

in either capital or operating costs as shown on Figures 22.5 and 22.6 below (NPV and IRR 

vs Capital Cost Variation and Operating Cost Variation). As indicated, federal income tax has 

minimal influence on the sensitivity of operating and capital cost changes to the IRR and NPV.  

A five percent change in the operating cost can have an impact to the NPV of approximately 

$3.24 million and the IRR of approximately 1.37 percent based on a discount rate of eight 

percent and a constant uranium price of $65.00 per pound of U3O8.   A five percent change in 

the capital cost can have an impact to the NPV of approximately $5.23 million and the IRR of 

approximately 4.06 percent based on a discount rate of eight percent and a constant uranium

 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

There are no operating uranium mines near the Dewey-Burdock project at this time. In the past, 

several open pit and underground uranium mines were located in the Edgemont District within 

and near the northeast portion of the current project location, and in northeastern Wyoming. An 

ISR uranium mine is presently operating near Crawford, Nebraska, approximately 70 mi 

straight line distance to the south of Dewey-Burdock and another ISR uranium mine is 

operating in Converse County, Wyoming approximately 90mi to the west of Dewey-Burdock.

Page 131 
Azarga Uranium Corporation 

Dewey-Burdock PEA  

 

 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

The existing open pit mines located in the east part of the property are not planned for any 

mining by Azarga.  These pits remain the responsibility of previous operators and existing 

landowners. Potential ISR resources have been identified under the existing pits below the 

underlying Fuson shale and at some depth within the Chilson Member of the Lakota.  The 

cost of extracting these resources is included in this PEA as well as groundwater restoration 

and decommissioning.  However, it is uncertain to what extent, if any, pit reclamation prior 

to construction of these well fields would be necessary and these costs are not included in 

this estimate.   

There are several projects controlled by Azarga which could potentially be a satellite to the 

project once a CPP is constructed.  This could potentially include Azarga's Aladdin and 

Centennial projects.   These projects are located approximately 80 miles and 250 miles from 

the Dewey-Burdock site, respectively. 

Azarga presently owns the Dewey Terrace property in Wyoming which is a western extension 

of Dewey Burdock and is anticipated to potentially provide additional resources to Dewey 

Burdock.  The project is directly adjacent with the Wyoming state line which is part and 

directly adjacent to the permit boundary for Dewey-Burdock.  

There are extensive unexplored oxidation and reduction or boundaries or "trends" within the 

project area which have yet to have been sufficiently drilled to determine the presence of 

mineralization.  Further assessment of these trends has the potential to demonstrate additional 

resources within the project area.  Historical record estimates indicate approximately 170 

miles of these trends within the project area with a large portion (estimated at over 100 miles) 

that is sparsely drilled or unexplored.  In particular, the potential exists for resources south, 

north, and west of existing Dewey resources.   

Potential vanadium resources within the project area are expected based upon historic 

operation of the mill in Edgemont, which produced vanadium along with uranium.  As well, 

existing core analyses indicates vanadium deposition.  However, previous drilling programs 

were designed to determine uranium primarily through gamma logging and not widespread 

coring. Therefore, Vanadium resources currently cannot be evaluated as they are not indicated 

across the deposit. It is recommended that a drilling plan to evaluate the vanadium resource 

be developed and completed including additional core drilling and testing.  Should potential 

resources be identified, an additional economic evaluation to determine a cost-benefit analysis 

for the production of vanadium is recommended.

 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

After reviewing the available information, the Authors feel that the Project, located in 

southwest South Dakota, USA, is potentially viable. The sandstone hosted roll-front uranium 

deposits in the Project area are shown to be amenable to ISR extraction from Project site-

specific bench-scale core leach testing results (ref., SRK 2012).  The uranium will be extracted 

from the sand bodies using injection and recovery wells designated specifically for the target 

sand horizons. 

An economic analysis has been performed based on the current Project uranium production 

estimates using the production schedule in conjunction with the estimated recoverable 

resource of 9.69 million pounds13 as discussed in Section 17.  An overall recovery factor of 

80 percent was used in the economic evaluation.  Based on the estimated recovery, the 

potential economic performance of the Project is estimated to generate net earnings before 

federal income tax over the life of the project of $284.2 million (pre-U.S. federal income tax) 

and $220.9 million (post U.S. federal income tax).  It is estimated that the project has an IRR 

of 67 percent and a NPV of $149.4 million (pre-U.S. federal income tax) and an IRR of 57 

percent and a NPV of $113.8 million (post-U.S. federal income tax) applying an eight percent 

discount rate, as summarized in Table 25.1.  

Table 25.1: Summary of Economics 

 
This analysis also assumes a constant price of $65.00 per pound for U3O8 over the life of the 

Project. The calculated cost per pound of uranium produced is $35.66 including all costs, with 

an estimated steady state operating cost of approximately $18.86 (pre-U.S. Federal income tax) 

and an estimated "all in cost" of approximately $42.19 (post-U.S. Federal income tax) per

 Risk Assessment 

The Project is located in a region where ISR projects have been and are operated successfully.  

The ISR mining method has been proven effective in geologic formations within Wyoming and 

Nebraska as described herein. Five Wyoming ISR facilities are currently in operation (Smith 

Ranch, North Butte, Willow Creek, Lost Creek and Nichols Ranch), one operating facility in 

Nebraska (Crow Butte) and one other is currently under construction (Strata's Ross Project) in 

Wyoming. 

As with any pre-development mining property, there are risks and opportunity attached to the 

project that need further assessment as the project moves forward. The authors deem those risks, 

on the whole, as identifiable and manageable. The following sections describe the potential risks 

to development of the Project and attainment of the financial results presented in this PEA. 

Because there will have been no well field scale pilot testing completed prior to construction 

of a full production facility, there is a risk that the total resource recovered, presently projected 

based on laboratory studies, may be overestimated. In addition, the current preliminary 

assessment includes 29 percent inferred resources.  It is possible that future well field 

delineation drilling may not successfully upgrade all of the inferred resource to indicated or 

measured class. Proceeding directly from a preliminary economic assessment to full 

production is a business decision and risk that Azarga is willing to accept based on prior ISR 

production history on similar deposits elsewhere in the U.S.  The Authors concur with Azarga's 

approach to proceed from preliminary economic assessment to a scalable production decision.  

Although there is risk in investing the initial capital for production-scale well fields and a 

surface processing facility, the concept as described herein for initiating the Project with an IX 

plant and scaling to a full CPP helps to minimize that risk.   

25.1.1 Uranium Recovery and Processing 

It should be noted that recovery is based on both site specific laboratory recovery data 

as well as the experience of Azarga personnel and other industry experts at similar 

facilities. There can be no assurance that recovery at this level will continue to be 

achieved during production. This PEA is preliminary in nature and includes mineral 

resources which may not be recoverable at the rates indicated herein. 

As discussed in Section 22.4.3, the financial indicators determined in this PEA are very sensitive 

to head grade and recovery.  These factors are difficult to determine prior to initiation of an ISR 

project and can vary throughout the project life.   

Bench-scale bottle roll and column tests have been performed on core samples from the Project. 

A potential risk to meeting the production and thus financial results presented in this PEA will 

be associated with the success of the well field operation and the efficiency of recovering 

uranium from the targeted host sands.  A potential risk in the well field recovery process depends 

on whether geochemical conditions that affect solution mining uranium recovery rates from the 

mineralized zones are comparable or significantly different than previous bench-scale tests and 

experience at other operations.  If they prove to be different, then potential efficiency or financial 

risks might arise. 

The percent recovery results of several bottle roll leach amenability tests Azarga had performed

by ELI are presented in Section 13. These indicate an average uranium dissolution of 85 percent; 

therefore, a recovery factor of 80 percent (as discussed in Section 17) is potentially achievable 

given the following considerations: 

 The pregnant lixiviant will consist of a mix of multiple well streams designed to have 
an average head grade of 60 ppm thus allowing for production to continue from 

individual wells long after the peak grade has been achieved (Figure 16.3). This targeted 

concentration will result in a higher depletion of the resources within the host sandstones 

leading to greater total recovery. The well field design package includes instrumentation 

and data collection equipment to optimize well field production by monitoring flow 

rates, injection pressure and formation pressure allowing control of hydraulic factors. 

 As discussed in Section 13 laboratory dissolution results ranged from 71 to 97 percent, 
indicating the deposit is amenable to ISR mining methods. ISR PEAs for similar 

projects have predicted a range of recoverability from 67 to 80 percent. As indicated 

by these ranges of dissolution and recovery, it is possible to see lower recovery than 

estimated in this PEA. 

During operation it is possible to manipulate head grades and production by varying flow rate.  

If head grade falls significantly below the target of 60 ppm, flow rates can be increased and/or 

additional wellfields brought into production to meet production goals.  This will typically 

require additional equipment (CAPEX) and increased operating costs (power, chemicals, etc.).   

Another potential risk is reduced hydraulic conductivity in the formation due to chemical 

precipitation or lower hydraulic conductivities than estimated, high flare and/or recovery of 

significant amounts of groundwater, the need for additional injection wells to increase uranium 

recovery rates, variability in the uranium concentration in the host sands and discontinuity of 

the mineralized zone confining layers. The risks associated with these potential issues have been 

minimized to the extent possible by extensive delineation and hydraulic studies of the site and 

the bench scale testing did not indicate the formation of precipitates that might impact hydraulic 

conductivity. In addition, well field-scale pumping tests will be performed prior to mining to 

confirm that there is adequate confinement to safely conduct ISR in each well field. 

Process risk encompasses the risk associated with the process selection for recovering of 

uranium, its proper implementation and attaining a final uranium product of acceptable quality.  

The facilities will be designed for average pregnant lixiviant flow rates and characteristics and 

their performance will vary with these criteria.  Pregnant lixiviant properties, in particular solids 

and impurity contents, will also influence processing operations.  Continual monitoring of 

pregnant lixiviant quality, tank bottoms chemistry and uranium product will be performed to 

optimize the process and provide for acceptable quality of the final product. 

Capacity of wastewater disposal systems is another process risk.  Limited capacity if deep 

disposal wells can affect the ability to achieve timely groundwater restoration.  Azarga has 

included up to eight wells in the Class V UIC permit application to EPA.  As well, Azarga is also 

permitting land application for the disposal of wastewater which was been permitted for other 

non-uranium mining operations in South Dakota.  It is possible that a combination of both styles 

of wastewater disposal could be utilized to speed restoration, decrease costs and improve the 

economic indicators presented herein.  

Another potential processing risk is the development of a cost beneficial agreement with an 

external source for processing loaded resin.  This is considered a relatively low risk as there are 

operating facilities that are amenable to providing these services.

25.1.2 Transporting 

Transportation of loaded resin or packaged yellowcake by Azarga could result in an accident 

and product spillage. If such an event were to occur, all spilled materials would be collected, 

and contaminated materials would be removed from the site and processed at a uranium 

processing mill as alternate feed, or disposed of at a licensed radiological waste facility as 

11e.(2) byproduct material. 

Risk of release during shipment cannot be eliminated, however; proper mitigation through 

implementation of shipping and spill response procedures can reduce the overall impact of such 

an event. 

25.1.3 Delays in Permitting 

The Dewey-Burdock project is the first uranium ISR facility to submit permit applications in 

the State of South Dakota. As such, there is inherent risk in a new permitting process, 

regulatory unfamiliarity with ISR methods, and an untested review period. The amount of time 

required for regulatory review of all permits associated with the commissioning of an ISR 

facility is highly variable and directly affects the economics of a project. The assumption 

presented in this PEA is that Azarga will have all permits necessary to begin construction of 

the facility commencing in 2015. However, this timeframe for obtaining the necessary licenses, 

permits, and approvals could be extended due to lack of required regulatory timelines and 

regulatory understaffing.   Associated regulatory hearings such as those required for state 

approval can have logistical difficulties and have the potential to cause additional delays. 

For the most part, resources identified by this PEA are located within the current permit 

boundary.  Approximately, 7,000 lbs exists in one location crossing outside of the project 

boundary.  Permit/licensing of the additional resources determined in this report both within 

and outside of the current permit boundary are anticipated to be handled by administrative 

changes for both state and federal permits and licenses. Additional permits for expansion of 

the currently proposed aquifer exemption Class III UIC permit would be required but is 

expected to be facilitated by prior permit approval.  These license and permit modifications 

would occur later in the project life such that sufficient time should be available within the 

project schedule to complete permitting ahead of construction and operation within these 

areas.  Areas outside the NRC licensed area would expect to be handled by license amendment.  

25.1.4 Social and/or Political 

As with any uranium project in the USA, there will undoubtedly be some social/ political/ 

environmental opposition to development of the project. The Project has drawn attention from 

non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and individuals in the general public. This risk is 

being managed by Azarga through the State and federal permitting processes.  Extensive efforts 

by the regulatory agencies have proceeded to near completion to allow for considerable public 

involvement in the process.  Opposition to the project has increased the regulatory efforts 

required and increased the logistical requirements of the permitting process.  However, these 

efforts appear to be on the way to successful completion as evidenced by the project receiving a 

NRC license in April 2014 as well as recommendations for approval by the state of South Dakota 

of applications for water rights, large scale mine permit, and groundwater discharge plan.  

Though significant major approvals remain, it is the Authors opinion that additional significant 

delays are unlikely.

25.1.5 Market and Contract 

Unlike other commodities, most uranium does not trade on an open market.  Contracts are 

negotiated privately by buyers and sellers.  Changes in the price of uranium can have a 

significant impact on the economic performance of the Project.  As discussed in Section 22, a 

$1.00 change in the price of uranium can have an impact to the pre U.S. federal income tax NPV 

of approximately $5.49 million and $3.80 million post U.S. federal income tax, based on a 

discount rate of eight percent, (See Figure 22.1). This analysis assumes a constant price per 

pound of $65 for U3O8 over the life of the Project. The Authors believe that these estimates are 

appropriate for use in this evaluation.  At the time of writing this PEA, Azarga has no long term 

pricing contracts in place. 

The marketability of uranium is subject to numerous factors beyond the control of Azarga.  The 

price of uranium may experience volatile and significant price movements over short periods of 

time.  Factors known to affect the market and the price of uranium include demand for nuclear 

power; political and economic conditions in uranium mining, producing and consuming 

countries; capital and operating costs; interest rates, inflation and currency exchange 

fluctuations; governmental regulations; availability of financing of new mines and nuclear 

power plants, reprocessing of spent fuel and the re-enrichment of depleted uranium tails or 

waste; sales of excess civilian and military inventories (including from the dismantling of 

nuclear weapons) by governments and industry participants; production levels and costs of 

production in certain geographical areas such as Russia, Africa and Australia; and changes in 

public acceptance of nuclear power generation as a result of any future accidents or terrorism at 

nuclear facilities. 

Regardless of these potential issues and as discussed in Section 19, there are more nuclear power 

plants being designed and constructed and a potential supply deficit to demand is likely to 

warrant additional uranium mining.

 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Azarga's plan is to permit for operations, and upon permit approval, initiate production in the 

first operational well field. The CPP will be constructed in phases over the course of four 

years.  In year one, the first phase of the CPP will be built at the Burdock site and will include 

the resin transfer system and ion exchange (IX) systems.  Pregnant lixiviant from the well 

field will be processed through the IX columns and the resulting loaded resin will be shipped 

to the nearest processing plant where the uranium can be extracted.   IX Trains will be 

subsequently added to the plant each year for the next two years to allow for a ramped 

production schedule.  In Year 3 the Burdock facility will be expanded into a full CPP 

(operational in Year 4) which will include all processing equipment necessary to produce and 

package yellowcake. The satellite facility at Dewey will be constructed in Year 7and become 

operational in Q4 of Year 7 in the mine plan.   

The Authors find that the development of the Project is potentially viable based on the 

assumptions contained herein.  There is no certainty that the mineral recovery or the 

economics presented in this PEA will be realized.   In order to realize the potential benefits 

described in this PEA, the following activities are required, at a minimum. 

 Complete all activities required to obtain all necessary licenses and permits required to 
operate an in situ uranium mine in the State of South Dakota.  Approximate cost 

$400,000. 

 Obtain agreement with remote processing facility to process loaded resin prior to 
completion of the Project CPP.  Minimal cost.   

 Additional Permit / License amendments and approvals necessary to realize all 
resources included in this PEA.  Approximate potential cost up to $500,000. 

 Cost benefit analysis to determine best available process to handle vanadium should 
levels be significant.  Approximate cost $75,000. 

 Finalize facility and well field engineering designs, including construction drawings 
and specifications.  Approximate cost $850,000. and 

 Identify procurement process for long lead items, and perform cost benefit analysis for 
any alternative equipment or materials.  Cost included in design phase above. 

Cautionary statement: this Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature, and 

includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have 

the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as 

mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will 

be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated 

economic viability.
