1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
This report is an independent, National Instrument 43-101 compliant technical review 
and report for Thunder Creek Property that is being explored as a joint venture between 
Lake Shore Gold Corp and West Timmins Mining Inc.   The work programs reviewed 
cover the time span from 2003 to June 24, 2009.  Lake Shore Gold Corp.'s field 
programs are current with 4 diamond drills turning on the Thunder Creek Property. 
 
The Thunder Creek Property is situated approximately 21 kilometres west of the City of 
Timmins, near the junction of Highways 144, south to Sudbury, and 101 west to 
Chapleau and Wawa.  On May 1, 2008, Lake Shore Gold Corp. notified West Timmins 
Mining Inc. ("WTM") that the requirements to earn a 60% ownership interest in the 
Thunder Creek Property have been completed. The terms for original option agreement 
are outlined in an agreement with Band-Ore Resources Ltd. ("Band-Ore") dated 
November 07, 2003  An amalgamation between Sydney Resources Corporation and 
Band-Ore Resources Ltd. (September 13, 2006) merged the Thunder Creek property 
into a new company West Timmins Mining Inc. The term of the agreement with Band-
Ore Resources Ltd. continued unchanged with West Timmins Mining Inc.   
 
The exploration programs are designed to test, and to delineate gold mineralization 
hosted within a tectonic zone that overprints a westward dipping contact of 
metamorphosed mafic volcanic rocks and sediments which have been intruded by an 
alkalic igneous complex.  This lithology is the southern, along strike continuation of the 
mineralized rock units that are located at the contiguous Timmins West Gold Project 
property.  SRK (2007) estimate a NI 43-101 compliant Probable Mineral Reserve at 
3387,000 tonnes grading an average 7.59 gram per tonne gold (cut grade of 3 g/t Au) 
containing 826,000 ounces of gold (25.7 M g) for the Timmins West Gold Property.   
 
Work completed to date on the Thunder Creek Property includes: geological mapping, 
outcrop overburden washing, channel sampling, a Mobile Metal Ion geochemical survey, 
line cutting, and 5 phases of diamond drilling.  A fifth phase diamond drill program is 
currently active with 75 bore holes plus seven wedge piercings having been collared for 
a completion of 40,689 metres of coring and over 20,102 core samples submitted for 
gold analysis. An additional diamond drill has recently been commissioned to the 
property bringing the total number of drills to three. 
 
The quality of the Lake Shore's reports, drill logs, and databases reviewed by the author 
are detailed and maintain a level of high professional standards. 
 
The Thunder Creek Project has advanced from a grassroots, anomaly testing, 
exploration program to a mineralized zones detailed definition drilling program.  A gold 
nugget effect has been recognized in the assaying process and the required steps for a 
more robust QA/QC vigilance is in the process of being implemented.  A data base 
manager to handle the QA/QC has been hired and the assay protocol has been changed 
such that all suspected mineralized zones will be assayed by pulp and metallic method 
procedures.   
 
The gold mineralization, within the Thunder Creek Property is hosted within a tectonite 
zone that straddles the mafic volcanic, sediment contacts and portions of the alkalic 
intrusive complex.  There appears to be one zone with multiple higher grade shoots 
within.  The definition drilling required to join up one shoot to another, from hole to hole 



 2

may require the drilling off at 12.5 metre centres.  With target depths at - 400 to – 1000 
metres below surface this type of detail drilling is not practical from surface.  With 
continued success in intersecting significant ore grade gold tenor, an underground 
exploration program of drill drifting, mineralization cross cutting, mapping and sampling 
on more than one level, with a raise between levels to determine mineralization 
continuity should be considered.  A two level drifting program will allow a significant bulk 
sample to be taken and mill tested.   
 
An aggressive multi drill rig diamond drill program is required to test the down dip, along 
strike, and down plunge extensions of the mineralization.  Detailed, sectional fan drilling 
is required for resource estimation.  A preliminary resource calculation and block 
computer model should be targeted for completion within the next 6 to 9 months. 
 
Bore hole TC09-68b has returned the best assay results intersected within the Thunder 
Creek property.  The pierce point of this hole, as demonstrated on a longitudinal 
projection, occurs approximately 42 metres above the parent hole TC09-68 and 
approximately 33 metres above the first wedge splay TC09-68a.  This intersection also 
occurs approximately 717 metres below surface and at an approximate distance of 88 
metres from TC09-69 and 131 metres from TC09-70.  The weighted average of returned 
gold analysis is 12.75 grams per tonne over 83.4 metres.  Gold mineralization greater 
than 1 gram per tonne is reported for 102 core samples of which 7 samples exceeded 
values of 34.29 g/tonne (1 ounce/ton Au).   Tables 11.1.3 and 11.1.4 tabulate the 
weighted averages of assay results for the Thunder Creek diamond drill programs.  
 
The recommended work program and budget for the Thunder Creek project includes 
detailed sectional diamond drilling of the Rusk Zone (44,000 metres) at 50 metre centres 
testing above -800 metres; intermediate step out diamond drilling at 100 to 200 metre 
centres along the extensions of the Rusk Zone (19,000 metres) to test the along strike 
and dip potential of the north and south extensions; and wide spaced exploratory drilling 
to test a variety of "other targets" at the Thunder Creek property (5,000 metres).  "Other 
targets" include the southwest extension of the volcanic and sedimentary contact from 
the Rusk Zone, as well as the margins of the syenite stock located to the immediate 
south of the Rusk Zone.  As a result of receiving encouraging ore grade drill intercepts 
an underground program of driving a drill drift platform on two levels and bulk sampling 
is in the cost review and planning stage.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
 
 
5.1 Access 
 
The centre of the Property is located within national topographic series map reference 
42-A-05; at longitude 81.57° west, 48.37° north latitude.  UTM co-ordinates for the 
Property centre projected in NAD 83, Zone 17 are approximately 458,050 metres east, 
5,357,923 metres north.  All weather road access to the property is provided by 
provincial Highways 101 and 144 with bush roads and timber cutting, and diamond drill 
trail side roads. A major power transmission line traverses portions of the property and 
provides additional access.  The junction of Highways 101 and 144 is located 1.8 
kilometres north-west of the Property centre.  Figure 4.1.1, Location Sketch, illustrates 
the Project area relative to the highways, City of Timmins and the City of Toronto. 
 
 
5.2 Climate 
 
The Thunder Creek Property and the City of Timmins experience a Continental Climate 
with an average mean temperature range of -17.5°C (January)  to +17.4° (July) and an 
annual precipitation of about 831mm.  The following table (Table 5.2.1) summaries the 
average temperatures and precipitation values for the 15 year period taken from the

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
The local economy of Timmins is dominated by the mining and logging industries.  With 
an area of 3,210 square kilometres, Timmins is one of Canada's largest area 
municipalities.  The 2006 Census indicates the population to be 42,455 persons. The 
area is serviced from Toronto via Highways 400, 69 to Sudbury; and Highway 144 to 
Timmins; or Hwy 11 from Barrie to Matheson and 101 westward to Timmins.  The Victor 
M. Power Airport has scheduled service provided by Air Canada Jazz, Bearskin Airlines 
and Air Creebec.  The Timmins District Hospital is a major referral health care centre for 
northeastern Ontario.   
 
The Property is transected by Highways 101 and 144 and is in close proximity to the 
main hydro grid transmission line.  An experienced mining labour pool is accessible in 
the Timmins area. 
 
 
5.4 Physiography 
 
The Property generally exhibits low to moderate relief.  A base elevation at the junction 
of Highways 144/101 is approximately 312 metres.  A peak height of land near the 
property centre rises to an elevation of 351 metres.  Thunder Creek ranges in elevation 
from 298 to 295m.  Drainage is southeast across the Property into Thunder Creek which 
flows into the Tatachikapika River (also known as the Lost or Redsucker River) which 
flows east-north-east to the northerly flowing Mattagami River.  Outcrop exposure is less 
than five (5) percent.  Figure 5.4.1 illustrates the claim boundary of the Thunder Creek 
property and Bristol Township draped over a landsat panchromatic image of the area. 
 
 The Continental Climate and the location on the Canadian Shield give rise to a plant 
hardiness zone 2a which supports the following boreal forest tree species and a timber, 
pulp and paper industry.  In no particular order of significance local trees species 
include: American Mountain-Ash (Sorbus Americana), Balsam Fir (Abies Balsamea), 
Black Spruce (Pincea Mariana), Eastern White Cedar (Thuja Occidentalis), Eastern 
White Pine (Pinus Strobus), Jack Pine (Pinus Banksiana), Pin Cherry (Prunus 
Pensylvanica), Red Pine (Pinus Resinosa), Tamarack (Larix Laricina), Trembling Aspen 
(Populus Tremuloides), White Birch (Betula Papyrifera) and White Spruce (Pincea 
Glauca). 
(http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/ClimateChange/2ColumnSubPage/268124.html) 
 
Hawley, J.E., (1926) points out that a large part of Ogden, Bristol and Carscallen 
Townships were swept by several forest fires dating back to 1911.  Portions of the area 
has recently been tree harvested leaving little timber of commercial value.

The north and westward extension of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario railway, 
and Niven's survey lines from Cobalt allowed new access for the discoveries of gold 
near Porcupine Lake.   In the early 1900's Mr. E.M. Burwash noted traces of gold in 
quartz veins along Niven's baseline while he was employed by the Ontario Bureau of 
Mines (1896), and was assigned to Niven's survey crew.  In 1899 Mr. W.A. Parks, also 
working for the Ontario Bureau of Mines and attached to Niven's survey crew noted an 
occurrence of gold in quartz veins along the portage route from the Mattagami River to 
Night Hawk Lake.  He reported "I regard the region south of the trail to Porcupine Lake 
as giving promise to the prospector" (Burrows, A.G., 1911, 1915; Dunbar, R., 1948). 
While prospecting for the Algoma Central Railway (1901) Mr. Charles Camsell worked 
on a vein occurrence returning low grade gold.  This property would become part of the 
Hollinger Mine.  In 1907 the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway reached Nellie 
Lake (Iroquois Falls). These gold discoveries helped create interest in the Porcupine 
area and began a rush that defined the Porcupine Gold Camp.  Mr. A.G. Hunter in 1908 
staked claims along the east shore of Porcupine Lake protecting a native gold showing 
associated with a shear zone occupied with quartz and schist.  1909 was a year of major 
discoveries of the Vipond, Dome and Hollinger mines.   
 
Niven's 1899 baseline forms the northern boundary of Bristol Township with Godfrey 
Township.  Access to the Thunder Creek Project area was limited in the early 1900's to: 
a winter road from Mattagami Heights (Timmins) north and west of the Mattagami River; 
river access to Bristol Landing situated on township boundary of Bristol and Ogden; and 
a wagon road across Bristol Township passing the Timmins West Property, Thunder 
Creek and the Thunder Creek Property. The Mattagami River provided access to 
Thorneloe Township and the Wawaitin Falls area.  The river at Wawaitin Falls had a 35 
metre (116 feet) descent and was dammed giving rise to Mattagami Lake and a hydro 
power generating facility to supply a portion of the Hollinger Mine power requirements.  
The transmission line and tote road would provide access to Thorneloe and the south-
eastern portion of Bristol Townships.   
 
The discovery of gold in Bristol Township on the McAuley-Brydge property (currently 
Lake Shore's Timmins West Gold Property) occurred in 1911.  The 1912 geology map 
(arm21a) by A.G. Burrows and W.R. Rogers illustrated three claims (TC 612, TC613, 
TC614) at the McAuley-Brydge occurrence plus four claims west of the Rusk occurrence 
(HR 1187, HR1188, HR1189 and HR1191).  The 1911 fire storms swept large parts of 
Carscallen, Bristol and Ogden townships.  The surface plants at Hollinger, Dome, West 
Dome, Vipond, Standard, Preston, East Dome, North Dome, were entirely destroyed.  
South Porcupine, parts of Pottsville and the North Part of Porcupine were also 
destroyed. (Burrows, A.G., 1915, Hawley, J.E., 1926).   
 
Ontario government geological mapping and report publications for Thunder Creek – 
Bristol Township area include documentation by A.G. Burrows (1910, 1911, 1912, 1915) 
for the Ontario Bureau of Mines; J.E. Hawley (1926) for the Ontario Department of 
Mines; and S.A Ferguson (1957) for the Ontario Department of Mines.  Recent 
Geological Survey of Ontario publications include: Ms. C. Vaillancourt (2000, 2001) 
OFR6032.004 "New Geological Mapping and Compilation in the Timmins West Area – 



 18

Bristol and Ogden Townships and a Preliminary Precambrian Geology Map "Timmins 
West-Bristol and Ogden Townships (P3436)".  In 2003, Ms. C. Vaillancourt and Ms. 
L.A.F. Hall completed miscellaneous release data ("MRD") 123, lithogeochemical data 
for the West Timmins Area.   Ferguson's map, "Bristol Township – 1957-7" remains the  
standard base geology for the township. 
 
 Historical "T-Files" assessment reports have been reviewed at the Ministry of Northern 
Development and Mines' ("MNDM") office at the Ontario Government Complex, Highway

7.0   GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
 
7.1  General Geological Setting 
 
The earliest reports of the geology for the Timmins and Thunder Creek area are from 
Ontario government geologist: Burrows (1910, 1911, 1912), Hawley (1926), Ferguson 
(1957, 1968) and Pyke (1982), supplemented by contributions by  Brisbin (1997), Grey, 
(1994), Melnik-Proud (1992) and van Hees (2000) for their Doctor of Philosophy 
degrees.  Described in these documents are the contributions made by government and 
mine geologists to detail the evolution of the stratigraphic understanding for the 
Porcupine Gold Camp.  Highlighted herein is a chronological bullet summary of 
significant observations and interpretations. 
 

 1896, Burwash assigned Precambrian volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the 
Timmins area to Huronian defined by Logan in 1847. 

 
 1911, 1912, 1915, 1925, Burrows maps and produces the first geological 

map of the Porcupine Camp and made his stratigraphic nomenclature 
consistent with relationships observed by Lawson (1913) for Lake of the 
Woods, as well as Miller and Knight (1915) in the Lake Timiskaming area. 

 
 1925, Burrows established that younger Timiskaming Series of sedimentary 

rocks unconformably overly the Keewatin Series volcanic rocks.  He identified 
porphyry dykes and stocks and the granitoid plutons in the surrounding area 
as being Algoman, and post Timiskaming.  The observation that 
Keweenawan olivine diabase dykes crosscut Matachewan quartz diabase 
was made at this time. 

 
 1933, Graton et al., proposed a subdivision for Keewatin volcanic rocks in 

Tisdale Township.  The subdivision included, from oldest to youngest, the 
Northern, McIntyre, Central, Vipond, and Gold Centre Series. The name "99 
Flow" was applied to a massive flow at the base of the Vipond Series.  

 
 1936, 1939, Hurst noted sedimentary rocks in the Timmins area occur both 

overlying and underlying an angular unconformity.  He places the rocks 
above the unconformity into the Timiskaming Series and assigns the 
sediments below the unconformity to the Keewatin Series. Porphyries are 
interpreted to be subvolcanic stocks emplaced into volcanic vents from which 
the felsic volcaniclastics were erupted. 

 
 1944, Holmes interpreted the porphyries to post date Keewatin volcanic rocks 

and Timiskaming sedimentary rocks. 
 

 1948, Jones, while working at the Hollinger Mine, presented a more detailed 
classification modified after Graton (1933).  Jones introduced the 
alphanumeric names to the lithological units (e.g. V8E); gave formation status 
to the Northern, Central, and Vipond Series; and renamed the "McIntyre 
Series" the "95", assigning the flows to the base of the Central Formation.  

 



 24

 1948, Buffam adapts Jones' Hollinger Mine terminology at the Moneta Mine 
and adds the term Krist Fragmental and describes the unconformity at the 
base of the Krist that separates it from the Tisdale Group mafic volcanic 
flows. 

 
 1948, Dunbar distinguishes two groups of Keewatin volcanic rocks in the 

Timmins area and names them Deloro Group and Tisdale Group.  He 
discriminates the Krist Formation from the underlying Tisdale Group and 
places it into the Hoyle Series. 

 
 1954, Moore included the Krist Formation with the Timiskaming Group and 

placed the unconformity between Keewatin and Timiskaming rocks at the 
base of the Krist. Burrows (1911) presented the same interpretation.   

  
 1954, Fuse applied Jones' (1948) terminology of the Tisdale Group to rocks 

exposed at the McIntyre Mine. 
 

 1960, Griffis, at the McIntyre Mine, establishes the most detailed subdivision 
of the Tisdale Group. 

 
 1968, Ferguson et al., attempt to correlate the stratigraphy of the Timmins 

Camp.  They assign the Krist Fragmental to the uppermost formation in the 
Tisdale.  

 
 1974, Pyke subdivided the Deloro and Tisdale Groups, based upon major 

oxide geochemical classification of volcanic rocks as per Jensen Cation Plot 
(Jensen, 1976) His nomenclature divided the two groups into six formations. 
Numbers I through III are within the Deloro Group and numbers IV through VI 
are within the Tisdale Group.  The Deloro is largely a calc-alkaline sequence 
approximately 14760 to 16400 feet (4500 to 5000m) thick and is composed 
mainly of flows of andesite and basalt in the lower part, and dacitic flows and 
dacitic and rhyolitic pyroclastic rocks toward the top.  Iron formation is 
common at or near the top of the group.  Most of the Deloro Group is 
confined to a large domal structure in the east central part of the area.  A 
major change in volcanism marks the beginning of the Tisdale Group.  The 
base formation consists largely of ultramafic volcanic rocks and basaltic 
komatiites.  This in turn is overlain by a thick sequence of tholeiitic basalt.  
The uppermost formation is largely volcaniclastic and has a calc-alkaline 
dacite composition.  The total thickness of the Tisdale Group is about 13120 
feet (4000m), (Pyke, 1974). 

 
 1975, Lorsong subdivided the Porcupine Group into Whitney, Beatty, Dome 

and Three Nations Formations. 
 
 1976, Pyke renamed the six formations from youngest as Donut Lake, 

Redstone, Boomerang, Goose Lake, Schumacher and Krist.  He assigns all 
sedimentary rocks to Formation VII, the sole unit of the Porcupine Group, 
which he considers to be a time equivalent, or the upper Deloro and the 
entire Tisdale Groups. 

 



 25

 1978, Pyke renamed the Tisdale and Deloro Groups the Upper and Lower 
subgroups and raised formations I through VI to group status.  This 
terminology did not receive acceptance with subsequent workers (Brisbin, 
1997) 

 
 1986 (Frarey and Krough), 1987 (Mortensen), 1989 (Corfu et al) post U-Pb 

zircon age dates for intrusives and selected volcanics in the Timmins area. 
 

 1988, Mason et al., suggest that the highly fractured centres which 
hydrothermal fluids and gold mineralization subsequently accessed were 
prepared at the time of porphyry emplacement.  Fracturing and brittle faulting 
generated prior to porphyry intrusion during one or more magmatic 
tumescence.  Eruption of Krist Formation pyroclastic rocks, and Keewatin 
folding and faulting, may have initiated ground preparation and localized 
magmatic and hydrothermal activity. 

 
 1991, Jackson and Fyon define a lithostratigraphic association of rock units 

within the Western Abitibi Subprovince within the boundaries of 55 tectonic 
assemblages. An assemblage is defined as stratified volcanic and/or 
sedimentary rock units built during a discrete interval of time in a common 
depositional or volcanic setting.  A four stage evolutionary model was 
suggested for the southern Abitibi greenstone belt. 1) Formation of submarine 
oceanic assemblages in a regional complex micro-plate interactions, perhaps 
caught between two larger converging plates located north and south of the 
micro-plate region.  2) Termination of submarine volcanism by collision of a 
large continental mass to the south at ~2700 Ma.  The collision may have 
been oblique, involving the 2.8 to 3.0 billion year old Minnesota River Valley 
gneiss terrane.  3) Tectonic thickening during collision led to emergent 
sediment source area(s) for post ~2700 Ma turbidite deposits, including both 
local deposits and a massive sedimentary accretionary wedge.  As collision 
continued, previously formed volcanic and turbidite deposits, including the 
Pontiac Subprovince were deformed.  Terminal subduction, possibly involving 
complex plate interactions at 2685 to 2675 Ma, generated alkalic volcanic 
rocks and alluvial–fluvial sediments in proximity to crustal–scale shear zones 
(Jackson and Fyon, 1991) 

 
 1992, Melnik-Proud interprets the gold bearing quartz-carbonate-albite veins 

to not only be spatially, but temporally and genetically associated with albite 
dykes in the Hollinger –McIntyre complex 

 
 1997, Brisbin defines the Krist as a formation within the Hoyle Group.  He 

proposes and assigns a new lithostratigraphic unit "the Hersey Lake 
Formation".  This unit is composed of intercalated ultramafic and mafic flows 
that comprise the base of the Tisdale Group in the core of the North Tisdale 
Anticline.  Correlative flows are exposed in the south, on the Delnite, Aunor, 
and Buffalo Ankerite mine properties.  The upper contact of the Hersey Lake 
Formation is defined as the upper contact of highest ultramafic flow in the 
Tisdale Group (Brisbin, 1997) 

 



 26

 2000, Ayer et al., with the aid of additional re-mapping and geochronological 
data have reinterpretation of the Tectonic Assemblages, reducing the 55 
assemblages to 7 volcanic assemblages and 2 sedimentary assemblages. 
Presently the assemblages are interpreted as autochthonous not 
allochthonous.  Geochemistry of the volcanic units indicates an interaction 
between plume and subduction zone melts.  Porcupine assemblage is 
interpreted to be the result of submarine turbidite fans that are coeval with 
batholith emplacement, regional folding and collision with Opatica 
Subprovince.  The Timiskaming assemblage is believed to be the result of 
subaerial alluvial fan-fluvial sedimentation associated with continental arc 
magmatism. 

 
  The Discover Abitibi Initiative, Ayer et al., from 2002 to the present has 

brought the talents of individuals, geologists, prospectors, the mining 
industry, the Ontario Geological Survey, and the Geological Survey of 
Canada to the Timmins - Kirkland Lake Gold Camps to assess the 
fundamental architecture and processes which were responsible for the gold 
and base metal endowment.  The products of this initiative have not been 
fully realized as the refined, higher resolution airborne geophysical 
electromagnetic and magnetic surveys, seismic survey, gravity survey,  
lithogeochemistry and additional age dating is providing tools that will modify 
historical interpretations.  

 
  Lake Shore Gold's geologists recognized the significance relationship a 

tectonic zone intruded by an alkali intrusive complex ("AIC") and gold 
mineralization at the Timmins West Gold Property and then apply this 
knowledge beyond the Timmins West Property boundaries. 

 
 
7.2 Regional Geology and Structure 
 
Supracrustal rocks in the Timmins region are assigned as members of nine (9) tectonic 
assemblages within the Western Abitibi Subprovince, of the Superior Province.  The 
seven volcanic and two sedimentary assemblages are of Archean age. Intrusions are 
emplaced at Archean and Proterozoic times.  Tectonic Assemblages of the Eastern 
Abitibi Subprovince, Figure 7.2.1, after Ayer J.A., Dube, B., and Trowell, N.F. (2009), 
illustrates the locations of these assemblages.  Table 7.2.1, is modified after Ayer (1999, 
2000, 2003) and summarizes the characteristics of the assemblages, from youngest to 
oldest.  

Figure 7.2.2, The Southern Abitibi Time Line diagrams the time relationship of these 
assemblages.  Significant ore deposits have been positioned on the time line as per 
Lucas and St-Onge (1998).   
 
There is a 55 Ma year time span between the volcanic eruption of the lower Pacaud 
Assemblage (2735 Ma) to the sedimentation and volcanism of the upper Timiskaming 
Assemblage (2680 Ma).  Each of the assemblages demonstrates a melt evolution from 
Komatiitic or Tholeiitic Basalt to Felsic or Calc-alkaline volcanics. Within the immediate 
Timmins area only the Deloro (2730 - 2724 Ma (6 Ma)), Kidd-Munro (2719 - 2711 Ma (8 
Ma)), Tisdale (2710 - 2703 Ma (7 Ma)), Porcupine (2690 - 2680 Ma (10 Ma)), and 
Timiskaming Assemblages (2680 - 2670 Ma (10 Ma)) are present. Revised age dates for 



 27

the Porcupine assemblage indicate the felsic volcanism of the Krist Formation is coeval 
with the calc-alkalic felsic porphyries in Timmins (2692+/-3 to 2688+/-2 Ma).   
 
Figure 7.2.3: The Regional Geology locates the property relative to the regional geology. 
 
Rhys, (2003) describes the regional penetrative structures of the Timmins area as being 
constrained between 2700 Ma and 2670 Ma, and are characterized by pre-metamorphic 
folds (D1) to a sequence of syn-metamorphic folding events (D2 and D3) which overprint 
D1 folds. The D1 event is multiphase, recorded by truncation of folds at the 
unconformable base of the Krist-Porcupine sequence.  The Destor Porcupine Fault Zone 
("DPFZ") accounts for two stages of deformation: 1) an episode of syn-Timiskaming 
(2680 to 2677 Ma) brittle faulting which truncates D1 folds and created the basins for 
Timiskaming sedimentation, and 2) a phase of syn-metamorphic D2-D3 shear zone 
development, which is represented by a band of highly strained rock, generally several 
hundred metres wide. The syn-metamorphic D2-D3 events are often characterized by 
west-northwest trending foliations, steeply dipping stretching and intersection lineations, 
and shear zones.  The displacement along the DPFZ in the Timmins area is sinistral. 
 
A compilation of geochronology age dates for the Southern Abitibi sub province from 
various sources: Easton, 2000; van Hees, 2000; Anglin, 1992; Melnik-Proud, 1992 and 
Lucas, St-Onge, 1991 is selectively summarized in Table 7.2.2, A Simplified Sequence 
Of Geological Events For The Timmins Camp (after Melnik-Proud, 1992). 
 

 

7.3 Property Geology 
 
All volcanic and sedimentary rocks underlying the Thunder Creek property have been 
metamorphosed.  The degree of metamorphism varies from upper greenschist to lower 
amphibolite facies.  Mineral alteration assemblages include: chlorite, sericite, carbonate, 
albite, quartz, and iron-oxides.  A mafic volcanic suite belonging to the Tisdale 
assemblage (2710-2703 Ma) occurs in the central portion of the property and trends in a 
northeast-southwest direction. Stratigraphically overlying, but now overturned, the mafic 
volcanics are clastic, turbiditic sediments of the Porcupine Assemblage (2690 to 2680 
Ma).   A poly-phase alkalic intrusive complex (AIC) intrudes within the South West Shear 
Zone and is discordant to both the mafic volcanic and sedimentary rock lithologies.   
Barrie (1992) dates two garnet fractions and one titanite fraction from a garnetite dyke 
phase of the intrusive at 2687+/-3 Ma.  The contact zone of the mafic volcanics-alkalic 
intrusion-sediments is central to the property and displays a S-shaped deflection and 
strikes northeast toward the Timmins West Gold Project (Samson, J., 2009).  A quartz-
feldspar porphyritic monzonite stock and numerous smaller related dykes (2687+/- 1.4 
Ma; Ayer et al., 2003) have intruded the sedimentary sequence in the southeast portion 
of the property.  Several Proterozoic diabase dykes of the Matachewan Swarm cross-cut 
all lithologies in a north-south direction.   
 
Geological mapping was surveyed by Michael Mocking, and Jacques Samson, under the 
direction of Henry Marsden, Senior Project Manager. 
 
Samson (2008) describes the rock types mapped on surface mapping and intersected in 
diamond drill core as follows:  
 



 28

  
Rock Type 1: Mafic Volcanic Rocks: (Tisdale Assemblage) 

The mafic volcanic rocks are fine-grained, medium-green, and generally occur as 
pristine massive to pillowed flows and flow breccias.  They are commonly 
epidotized and carbonatized (calcite).  Fine disseminated to blebby magnetite is 
quite common, particularly proximal to the alkalic complex, where the rocks 
become fine-grained and darker, partly chloritized, locally hematized.   

  
 Rock Type 2: Sedimentary Rocks: (Porcupine Assemblage) 

The sedimentary sequence consists mainly of massive to poorly bedded quartz 
and feldspar lithic greywacke units, locally interbedded with siltstone to 
argillaceous units.  In the footwall to the AIC, along a southwest trending shear 
zone (SWSZ) and along the east-west structural zone (EWSZ), the sediments 
are sheared into a quartz-sericite-carbonate-hematite schist, which locally 
displays crenulation fabrics.  

 
 Rock Type 3: Alkalic Intrusive Complex: 

The alkalic intrusive complex (AIC) is poorly exposed. It has a very strong 
magnetic signature which the geophysical interpretation indicates that it extends 
northeasterly for at least 2 kilometres across the central portion of the Thunder 
Creek Property, and onto the Timmins West Gold Property to the north.  The AIC 
intrudes along the contact between the volcanic and the sediments.  The 
magnetic trend becomes distorted and exhibits an offset or folded character 
when intersected by several interpreted structures.  The AIC is a poly-phase and 
vari-textured intrusion, of  contemporaneous age with the Timmins Porphyry suite 
(Pearl Lake 2689 Ma, Millerton 2691 Ma, Crown 2688 Ma, and Paymaster 2690 
Ma; – Barrie 1992), and is also of similar age as the Bristol Lake Quartz-Feldspar 
Porphyry in the eastern portion of Bristol Township (2687 +/- 1.4 Ma; Ayer 2003).  
The intrusive shows at least three texturally and mineralogically distinct phases:  
i) a fine- to coarse-grained pyroxenite; ii) a biotite-pyroxenite; and iii) a porphyritic 
garnet syenite.  The fine to coarse grained pyroxenite is strongly magnetic, and 
consists of greater than 85% pyroxene (diopside), with variable amounts of 
accessory biotite+magnetite+rutile+apatite, and interstitial calcite (Miller, 2004).  
The intrusive is partially exposed at the Rusk Showing, and displays pegmatitic 
primary layering as well as cumulate-like textures.  The pyroxenite locally grades 
into a biotite-rich phase (possible lamprophyric affinity), characterized by the 
presence of large biotite "clots" and books (poikilitic biotite) up to several 
centimeters across.  In places, "sweats" and dykes containing 40 to over 75% 
dark brown to black melanite garnets (up to 1cm across) are noted, contained 
within a fine-grained and leucocratic matrix consisting of 
plagioclase+orthoclase+biotite+carbonate+apatite+titanite (Miller 2004).  The 
different phases sometimes exhibit clear yet irregular contacts, and sometimes 
appear to be transitional. Numerous "monzonitic" to "syenitic" dykes are noted 
throughout the main body of the pyroxenite and also within the volcanic rocks.  It 
is not clear if these phases are genetically related to the AIC or to the monzonite 
stock located in the southern portion of the property. 

  
 Rock Type 4: Quartz Feldspar Porphyry:  

The quartz-feldspar porphyritic monzonite consists of a nearly circular intrusion in 
excess of 500m across, expressed by a distinct topographic high in the lower-
middle portion of the property.  The intrusive consists of 10-40% quartz eyes and 



 29

10-20% tabular feldspars (commonly zoned and occasionally up to 3cm across), 
contained within fine-grained pinkish-grey groundmass.  Salmon pink to brick-red 
(interpreted as being hematized) and generally aphyric felsic dykes are 
commonly observed within shear zones hosted by the sediments. These dykes 
possibly relate to the monzonite stock. 
 
Figure 7.3.1, Property Geology, locates the outcrop, showings, and rock types 
relative to the Thunder Creek claim boundaries and local access. 
 
Figure 7.3.2, Sample Locations, positions the 2004 rock sample locations relative 
to the property geology. 
 

 

7.4 Structural Geology 
 
There is less than five (5) percent outcrop exposure observed within the Property.  The 
dominant tectonic fabric strikes approximately 220° and dips 65°northwest.   Two 
intersecting linear structures cross cut lithology and have been interpreted as shear 
zones. The structures have been labeled the southwest ("SWSZ") and the east-west 
("EWSZ") shear zones.   
 
The SWSZ is observed between the alkalic intrusive complex and sediment contact 
(footwall).  Occasionally the SWSZ occurs in the hangingwall, along the contact between 
the AIC and the mafic volcanics.  This shear zone is poorly exposed but can be 
observed at the Rusk Showing and at another area 300m further to the northeast.  It has 
also been intersected by diamond drill holes.   The shear or tectonic  zone is 
characterized by being 1 to >20 m wide, generally trending southwest and dipping 
northwest at 220°/65-80°N and is interpreted as extending over two kilometres in length 
along the intrusive contact zone.  Alteration within the zone is moderate to very strong 
iron-carbonate alteration, in association with narrow and discontinuous quartz-ankerite-
albite-hematite stringers and veinlets, various syenitic to felsite dykes, disseminated 
pyrite, and anomalous gold values;   
 
The EWSZ occurs in the central portion of the property and was outlined during the 2004 
mapping survey.  It is expressed by a distinct east-west dextral flexure in the magnetic 
pattern of the AIC.  The zone displays a strong southwest to east-west trend, with a 
moderate to steep dip to the north (240-270°/60-80°N).  It has similar alteration and 
mineralization as the SWSZ (Samson, J., 2009).

8.0  DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
 
8.1  General Deposit Types 
 
The Porcupine area is well known for hosting two mineral deposit types: Xstrata's Kidd 
Creek mine, a volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit, and several mesothermal 
Archean shear hosted gold deposits.  Gold production to the end of 2006, from some 50 
operational sites is reported to be 2,028,140 kilograms of gold (65,206,222 ounces of 
gold).  Table 8.1.1 highlights the twenty one locations that exceeded production of 3,110 
kilograms of gold (100,000 ounces of gold).   
 
Figure 8.1.1, illustrates a stratigraphic column for the Tisdale Group and the formations 
which host significant gold mineralization.  The formational calculated thicknesses have 
been sourced from Ferguson (1968) and Brisbin (1997).  To date, no significant gold 
mineralization has been found within the Krist and Beatty Formations.

Brisbin (1997) summarizes the local Timmins area gold mineralization and stratigraphic 
association as follows. 
   

Approximately 4.5 million ounces of gold have been produced from veins spatially associated with 
small quartz feldspar porphyry stocks and dykes which intrude Hersey Lake Formation flows on the 
Delnite, Aunor, Buffalo Ankerite, and Paymaster properties.  Veins hosted in mafic flows 
intercalated with ultramafic flows adjacent the Timiskaming unconformity have accounted for a 
significant portion of 6.1 million ounces of gold produced from Broulan -  Hallnor – Pamour mines 
area.  In Hoyle Township gold – bearing veins hosed within mafic flows of the Hersey Lake 
Formation were mined at Bell Creek, Marhill, and Owl Creek mines and are being mined at Hoyle 
Pond Mine.  Massive white quartz veins are hosted in a carbonatized peridotitic komatiite unit near 
the Beaumont Shaft in northeastern Tisdale Township but no gold production from that property is 
recorded. 
 
Central Formation flows and interflow carbonaceous argillites are very important hosts for gold 
mineralization.  The Central Ore Zone on the Hollinger property, all major gold orebodies in the 
McIntyre Mine and a number of the vein systems in the Coniaurum Mine all occur within the Central 
Formation.   A black, carbonaceous argillite is the uppermost unit in the Northern member.  It is the 
host for 3, 5, and 25 veins in the McIntyre, 91 vein in the Hollinger Mine and the single vein mined 
at Moneta Mine (Mason et al 1986).  The 95 Member at the McIntyre Mine forms the hangingwall to 
the important veins hosted by the carbonaceous argillite that caps the Northern Member.  The 95C 
was prominent marker unit at the Moneta, Hollinger, and McIntyre Mines.  It hosts 84 Vein in the 
Hollinger Mine and 7 Vein in the McIntyre Mine which together yielded more than 3 million ounces 
of gold (Jones, 1985).   
 
The 99 flow of the Vipond Formation is the stratigraphically uppermost unit to be affected by 
intense alteration in the Central Ore Zone.  It is intensely ankeritized, weakly to moderately 
sericitized and pyritized and hosts gold bearing veins along its strike length on the south limb of the 
Central Tisdale anticline.  Mineralized exposures of the 99 flow occur in open pits of the Hollinger 
property, on the McIntyre property where it crops out immediately adjacent to Pear Lake porphyry 
south of Pearl lake and on the Coniaurum property where it hosts number 2, 5, and 10 veins.  
South Shaft was sunk on subhorizontal white quartz on the Davidson Tisdale property in northeast 
Tisdale Township but there is no alteration present in this area, nor did any significant production 
take place from this shaft. 
  
The V8 unit of the Vipond Formation is a complex and variable entity which as a whole forms a 
consistent stratigraphic unit, but within which there is less consistency due to facies variations.  Its 
economic importance is underscored by the fact that 14 of the 20 quartz ankerite veins which up to 
1979 accounted for 20% of gold produced at the Dome Mine (Fryer et al, 1979) were hosted by the 
Vipond Formation, and that the most important hosts were the Key and Spherulitic subunits of the 
V8 (Crick, 1991).  Very little gold production has been derived from veins hosted with the V8 in the 
Hollinger-McIntyre- Coniaurum area.  A portion of 92 Vein and 20 Vein were hosted in the V8 on 
the south side of the Hollinger property. 
 
The V9 unit is a black carbonaceous argillite which overlies the V8 unit in the McIntyre (Griffis, 
1960), Hollinger  (Hall, 1985) Vipond (Dougherty, 1934) and Dome (Holmes, 1968) Mines.  Despite 
its presence over a wide area there are sections where it s absent (Hall, 1985).  On the McIntyre 
property it is up to 6 metres thick but averages 1.5 metres this.  The V9 is an important ore host at 
the Vipond Mine (Dougherty, 1934).  It hosts 20/24 Vein at the McIntyre and Coniaurum Mines, 
much of the 92 Vein and 44 Vein at the Hollinger Mine, and quartz ankerite veins at the Dome 
Mine. 
 
The most important orebodies at the Vipond mine occur in the V10A, known there as the 10 Flow 
(Dougherty, 1934).  On the Coniaurum property, 40 vein occurs in the V10A and adjacent V10B 
subunits.  The V10A hosts portions of the 92, 93, and 44 veins on the Hollinger property.  Some of 
he "Dacite Ore" at the Dome occurs in a V10A.  The carbonaceous argillite interval that overlies the 
V10A is a locus of quartz veining where it is present at the Vipond Mine (Dougherty, 1934) and 
hosts much of 93 Vein at the Hollinger Mine.  The V10B hosts part of 93 and 44 veins at the 
Hollinger Mine, a portion of 40 Vein on the Coniaurum property and "Dacite Ore" in the Dome Mine.  
The V10C hosts "Dacite Ore" at the Dome Mine.

The only orebodies hosted by Gold Centre Formation flows are veins systems in the "Northern " 
Flows at the Dome Mine similar to those in "Dacite Ore" in the underlying Vipond Formation  
The only significant gold mineralization known to be hosted in the Whitney Group occurs in the east 
end of the Owl Creek Pit in Hoyle Township.  Gold bearing veins hosted within Whitney Group have 
been intersected in diamond drill holes north of Pamour 1 Mine (Duff, per. Com, 1992) and south of 
Owl Creek pit.  Veins in Tisdale Group mafic flows occur immediately south of the contact of these 
flow with Whitney Formation sedimentary rocks at the Hoyle Pond Mine in Hoyle Township. 
 
No gold mineralization is known to occur within the Krist Formation. 
 
No significant gold mineralization is known to occur within the Beatty Formation.  Some of the 
auriferous veins hosted within the basal conglomerate of the Timiskaming Group at the North 
Dome Shaft do transgress the contact with the Beatty Formation, but they pinch out within a few 
metre to two of the contact (Brisbin, 1997).  If Holmes (1944,1964) and Gray (1994) are correct in 
their observations within the Sedimentary Trough the Beatty Formation is host to significant gold 
mineralization. 
 
Approximately 15 % of gold mined to date in the Porcupine Camp has come from bulk tonnage 
sheeted vein and stockwork orebodies, and to a lesser extent from narrow veins in Timiskaming 
sedimentary rocks. These orebodies have been mined at the Dome Mine in Tisdale Township, and 
at the Pamour, Falconbridge Hoyle, Broulan, Hallnor, and Bonetal Mines in Whitney Township.  
The gold deposits of Whitney Township were not examined during this study and are described by 
Aitken (1990) (Brisbin, 1997). 

 
 
Gold mineralization at the Thunder Creek Property occurs along the same volcanic-
sedimentary rock contact and similar alkalic mafic complex as the Timmins West Gold 
Property.  The mafic volcanic rocks are of the Tisdale assemblage, but a flow unit 
correlation with the detailed volcanic stratigraphy of the Timmins' deposits has not been 
determined.  SRK (2007) estimate a Probable Mineral Reserve at 3387,000 tonnes 
grading an average 7.59 gram per tonne gold (cut grade) containing 826,000 ounces of 
gold (25.7 M g) for the West Timmins Gold Property.

9.0   MINERALIZATION 
 
 
9.1  General Description of the Mineralization 
 
The most significant surface showing on the Thunder Creek Property is mineral deposits 
inventory ("MDI") number MDI42A05NE00003, the "Rusk Showing" and  the zone's 
down dip and down plunge extensions.  Over the years the property name has changed 
from 1941-the ONeill Property, 1942-Rusk Porcupine Claim P8396, 1979-Croxall-Miller 
Property, 1994-Thunder Creek Property.  The MDI file indicates that trenching and 
pitting took place on the property as early as 1916. During the early 1940's Rusk 
Porcupine Mines completed trenching and the diamond drilling of 18 drill holes (1981m).  
The mineralization discovery pit was 1.2 metres  by 1.2 metres and returned a value of 
$24.85 over 121.9cm, $15.05 over 76.2 cm and $8.41 over 91.4 cm (T-File 542).  The 
showing is situated within present claim P495309 and is hosted within the Southwest 
Shear Zone. 
 
One of the exposed zones of mineralization and alteration consists of weak shearing 
accompanied by numerous "syenitic" sweats and dykes swarming along the contact 
between the mafic volcanic rocks and the AIC.  Samples with 2 to 3% pyrite and traces 
of chalcopyrite from the area commonly assay around 1 to 3 gpt Au, and one sample 
collected by Lake Shore from a syenitic piece of rubble returned an assay of 71.9 grams 
per tonne gold.  Another shear zone is exposed in the footwall of the AIC, at the contact 
with the sediments, roughly 125 metres to the southeast.  This second zone displays 
very strong iron-carbonate staining, hematization, and is accompanied by tectonic 
brecciation, quartz-ankerite veining, and over 10% fine disseminated pyrite in places.  
Trenching by Lake Shore 2004 extended the surface expression of anomalous gold 
zone another 300 metres further to the northeast (Hocking and Marsden, 2004.). 
 
Mapping along the EWSZ has indicated many similarities with characteristics of the 
SWSZ, but the rock samples so far collected are only weakly anomalous in gold 
(Hocking and Marsden, 2004). 
 
The monzonite intrusion that occurs in the south central portion of the property contains 
very narrow flat lying quartz veins, 1-10cm wide, that host small amounts of galena and 
sphalerite.  Historical pits have been placed on these veins.  Grab samples from the pit 
area, collected by Lake Shore are reported to have returned assay results up to 4.02 
grams per tonne gold. 
 
Unlike the Timmins West Gold Property no significant amount of gold mineralization is 
found to be associated with tourmaline-quartz veining within the Thunder Creek 
property.  Diamond drilling is testing gold mineralization targets in the hanging wall mafic 
volcanics, alkali intrusive complex contact, the alkali intrusive complex and the footwall 
of the complex with the metasedimentary rocks; and galena quartz stockwork veins 
associated with porphyry intrusions. These host rocks are spatially bound by the South 
West Shear Zone and the East West Shear Zone.   
 
Ongoing diamond drilling is targeted to define the along strike, down dip and down 
plunge dimensions to the multiple mineralized zones leading to a resource calculation.

10.2  Bedrock Mapping and Lithogeochemical Sampling 
 
Surface geological mapping was carried out during the summer field season of 2004 by 
Lake Shore personnel.  Emphasis was place on the area between Highway 144 and the 
eastern property boundary.  The area was mapped at a scale of 1:2,500.  The remainder 
of the property was surveyed at 1:5,000 scale.  During this program 102 surface 
samples were taken.   Three samples of the alkali intrusive complex were collected for 
whole rock analysis to test for economic concentrations of rare-earth elements.   These 
samples were submitted to ALS Chemex Laboratories in Toronto for gold assay and 
ICP-MS multi-element analysis.  
 



 43

Figures 7.3.1, and 7.3.2, illustrate the property geology and sample locations. The Rusk 
Showing and associated blast rubble returned the most significant reported assay value 
is 2.98 grams per tonne gold.  A single float sample from an existing pit in the Rusk 
Showing area returned an assay value of 71.9 g/t Au.  Base metal bearing, undeformed, 
quartz veins in the quartz-feldspar porphyritic monzonite intrusion returned assay values 
of up to 4.02 g/t Au.  Table 10.4.2, located in Appendix 1. lists the locations, sample 
numbers and returned gold analysis for the lithogeochemistry sampling and channel 
sampling that took place in 2004 and 2006. 

10.3   Trenching, Outcrop Stripping, and Lithogeochemical Sampling 

 
Two phases of outcrop overburden excavation, power washing and channel saw 
sampling have taken place within the Thunder Creek Property.  Three areas were 
completed in 2004 and 2 new areas plus an extension of area 1 was completed in 2006. 
Approximately 780 m² was exposed in 2004 and an additional 675 m² uncovered in 
2006.  The trench areas are shown in Figure 10.3.1, Overburden Stripping Location 
Map. Detailed overburden stripping maps are illustrated in Figures 10.3.2 to 10.3.6.   
 
Total Exploration of Timmins, completed the 2004 trenching, and mapping program 
utilizing a backhoe attachment mounted on a muskeg-tracked vehicle and Wajax water 
pumps.  The 2006 mechanical stripping and trenching was completed using a 215B CAT 
excavator operated by Kapel's Backhoe Services of Timmins.  Washing, channel 
sampling and mapping was carried-out intermittently by various contractors and Lake 
Shore personnel. 
 
Samples from the 2004 sampling program were sent to Swastika Laboratories, to be 
analyzed for gold using FA/AA methods   

 10.3.1 Outcrop Stripped Area 1 and Expanded Area 1 

 
The 2004 overburden stripped Area One (1) covers approximately 400m2.   In 2006, the 
exposure area was expanded by approximately 100 m2.  The expansion provided a 
better exposure of the quartz veining and iron-staining in the southwest portion of the 
trench.  The stripped area consists of a sheared contact zone between the pyroxenite 
and sediments, as well as the "SWSZ".  This shear strikes approximately 220° and dips 
80° to the northwest.  It is characterized by a two (2) to six (6) metre wide zone of weak 
to moderate calcite and iron-carbonate alteration, accompanied by weak hematization, 
and discontinuous quartz-calcite to quartz-ankerite veining.  Strong patchy iron-staining 
is noted, accompanied by up to 2% pyrite.  Strongly deformed intermediate to felsic 
dykes and calcareous syenitic dykelets occur subparallel to the contact zone.  The best 
assay obtained from this location in 2004 was 1.23 gpt Au over 0.40m.  The expansion 
of this trench to the southwest in 2006 indicated that bedrock quickly plunges down and 
most of the trench became submerged under water.  Similar alteration and veining was 
exposed, with the best assay being 861 ppb Au over 0.57cm (Samson, 2008) 

 10.3.2 Outcrop Stripped Area 2 

Stripped Area Two (2) has an approximate area of 180m2.  The exposed rock units are 
fine to medium grained, dark green to black in colour mafic volcanic rocks near the 
hanging wall contact of the AIC. Chlorite-magnetite alteration is present.  The interpreted 



 44

SWSZ appears to be represented by a one (1) to four (4) metre wide chlorite-calcite 
altered shear zone trending 230° and dipping 65° north west.  Numerous fine-grained, 
pink, feldspar ± biotite ± magnetite "syenitic" dykes cut the outcrop.  The dykes 
occasionally contain dark brown to black garnets on their margins and have an overall 
southwest trending orientation.  Samples of the dykes containing up to 2-3% pyrite and 
0.5% chalcopyrite returned assays of up to 2.35 g/t gold.  A single float sample of pyritic 
syenite dyke taken near Stripped Area 2 returned an assay value of 71.9 g/t gold.  A 
sample of altered mafic volcanics and syenite dyke, with minor pyrite and chalcopyrite, 
from the shear zone returned an assay value of 2.95 g/t gold (Hocking, and Marsden, 
2004). 

 10.3.3 Outcrop Stripped Area 3 
 
Stripped Area Three (3) exposes an area of about 200m2 of quartz-sericite-hematite 
schist within the EWSZ.  The zone appears to be strongly sheared sediments that have 
been intruded by salmon pink, aphanitic felsic dykes, possibly related to the nearby 
monzonite intrusion.  The schist displays a strong 240° to 270° trend, with a northward 
dip of 60° to 80°.  Stretching lineations on the dominant foliation plane exhibit a 
moderate plunge to the northwest at 60°-284°.  Narrow quartz veins and quartz-calcite 
veinlets are located within the shear planes, contain up to 1% disseminated pyrite and 
display strong hematite alterations on the vein margins.  Two samples of schist wall rock 
with minor pyrite yielded anomalous values gold values of 139 and 169 ppb (Hocking, 
and Marsden, 2004). 
 
 10.3.4 Stripped Area 4 
 
Stripped Area Four (4) is located about 170m south-southwest of Area 1 and covers 
roughly 275m2.  A historical trench is filled with rubble and overgrown with vegetation.  
The exposed rock units are relatively unaltered, non-mineralized, biotite-rich pyroxenite 
or lamprophyre.  The footwall contact zone with the sediments and ultramafic complex 
lies beneath 1.5 metres of sand and clay.  The zone was strongly deformed and 
displayed irregular quartz-carbonate stringers and veinlets which have been altered by 
iron-carbonate, and accompanied by minor disseminations of pyrite.  The best gold 
assay returned was 408 ppb over 0.64m (Samson, 2008). 
 
 10.3.5 Outcrop Stripped Area 5 (the Rusk Showing) 
 
The "Rusk Showing" represents a general area, and not one location, where several pits, 
trenches and drill holes were completed by Rusk Porcupine Mines in 1942.  The area is 
approximately 150m across.  In 2006, an approximate area of 300m² was exposed 
centered on UTM coordinates 458,780m east and 5,358,050m north.  Two old pits filled 
by vegetation were noted at this location.  All rocks were extremely weathered, stained 
by iron-oxide.  Stripping and washing revealed the sheared contact zone between the 
ultramafic to the northwest, and the sediments in the footwall.   
 
The ultramafic consists of a massive and relatively unaltered pyroxenite, fine to medium-
grained, black, and strongly magnetic.  Subtle "pinkish sweats" or calcareous syenitic 
dykes and garnetiferous pegmatitic bands occur injected along joints and fractures, 
locally defining "pseudo-layering".  No significant sulphide mineralization or veining was 
noted within the ultramafic.   The rocks in the footwall to the intrusive are dark rusty 
brown, extremely oxidized, revealing very strong and pervasive iron-carbonate 



 45

alteration.  They are flooded by several generations of quartz-ankerite-albite stringers 
and veins, and are extremely deformed, displaying numerous episodes of folding.  The 
dominant "fabric" trends 240° and dips 55-65° northwest.  Shearing and brecciation are 
extreme, and the identification of the protolith is very difficult.  Fine magnetite is 
disseminated throughout.  Approximately twenty-five metres away from the contact 
zone, the rocks become less altered, less deformed, weakly magnetic, and can be 
clearly identified as sediments.   
  
Mineralization in the footwall rocks is quite variable, with trace to 10% fine dusty pyrite 
and 1-2mm cubes. Trace amounts of chalcopyrite are noted mostly in the veins, and 
"clots" of galena up to 1cm across can be observed on fracture planes.  A total of 106 
channel samples were collected from the Rusk Showing.  Most are geochemically 
anomalous in gold (>100 ppb), with many assaying in the 1 to 2 gram per tonne range in 
association with the strongest zones of alteration and veining.  One sample (2513), 
taken from a zone of veining with less than 0.5% pyrite and trace chalcopyrite initially 
assayed 15.017 gpt Au over 0.41 metres, and returned up to 22.354 gpt Au on a check 
analysis.  Another sample taken at the same location also assayed 10.423 gpt Au over 
1.15m.  Upon re-examination of these samples, fine pinheads and "flakes" of visible gold 
were noted in the veins (Samson, 2008).  Sample numbers, widths, and returned gold 
assay results from the saw channel samples are listed in Table 10.4.2. (Appendix 1). 
 
 
10.4  Mobile Metal Ion (MMI) Soil Sampling Survey 

During 2004, a combined field crew consisting of Lake Shore Gold employees, and 
contract personal from Vision Explorations completed a Mobile Metal Ion ("MMI") soil 
geochemical sampling program over the Thunder Creek Property.   A total of 830 
samples, including 5 duplicates samples were collected from soil material situated 10 cm 
below the base of the organic "humus" layer.   Approximately 250-400 grams of soil is 
collected and placed in labeled plastic bags sealed with plastic ties.  The samples were 
shipped to SGS Analytical labs in Toronto for analysis using MMI-B analytical package 
which includes elements Au, Ag, Pt, Co and Ni.  

Field survey control utilized an existing historical Battle Mountain Canada Ltd. grid.  Grid 
lines are spaced 125 metres apart.  Samples were taken on 27 survey lines at 50 metre 
intervals along the line.  Where the grid was overgrown, lines were pushed through the 
impasse with hip chain and compass.  Each sample site was flagged, the sample 
number inscribed on an aluminum tag and placed at the site.  A hand held GPS was 
used to record the position of each sample for plotting reference. 

Analytical results are summarized in Table 10.4.1., and plots of both ppb and response 
ration are illustrated in Figures 10.4.1 to 10.4.10. Sample results for 29 of the 830 
samples reported taken were not found.

The colour intensity plots generated by ArcMap and Geosoft Target for ArcGIS show 
that the trend of the elemental anomalies coincides with the mapped geology Figures 
10.4.1 to 10.4.10.  Early phase drilling in 2003 to 2006 targeted some of the MMI 
anomalies.

 11.0   DIAMOND DRILLING 
 
 
11.1 General Description of the Diamond Drill Programs 
 
Bradley Bros. Ltd., (Timmins, Ontario), is the contractor assigned to carry out the 
diamond drilling on the Thunder Creek Property.  Holes are bored to retrieve NQ size 
rock cores with a diameter of 47.6mm.  As a practice, diamond drill hole casings are left 
in the ground and labeled for future surveys and access.  At the present time there are 
four diamond drill rigs boring holes into the Thunder Creek project.  The project data cut 
off for this report is June 24th, 2009.   Seventy five (75) diamond drill hole collar locations 
are indicated in Table 11.1.1, Diamond Drill Hole Collar Details.  Of the seventy five drill 
holes and seven wedged hole extensions, information from bore holes TC09-68c, TC09-
68d, TC09-71a, TC09-73, TC09-73a, TC09-74 and TC09-75 is pending completion of 
the logging and verification process.   Thus information from these bore holes will not be 
a subject of the technical report.  To date 40,689 metres have been cored on the 
Thunder Creek Project by Lake Shore Gold Corp.  Figure 11.1.1a, and Figure 11.1.1b, 
are diamond drill collar location plans, illustrating the location of the holes relative to the 
property geology and claim boundary. The location of Lake Shore's first forty-nine drill 
holes are plotted in Figure 11.1.1a, and drill holes fifty to seventy-one are positioned on 
Figure 11.1.1b.    Figure 11.1.2, is a generalized cross section, looking south-southwest 
illustrating the geology and intercept points of the labeled diamond drill holes.  An 
idealized composite section of present interpretation of the Thunder Creek diamond 
drilling in relation to the Timmins West Gold Mine's infrastructure and mineralized zones 
is illustrated in Figure 11.1.3.   A vertical longitudinal projection of core length 
intersections piercing the Rusk Zone is diagramed in Figure 11.1.4. The intersection 
pierce point for drill hole TC09-68b is illustrated on Figures 11.1.2, 11.1.3, and 11.1.4. 
 
The objectives of the previous diamond drill campaigns was to test, a) the historical 
showings by twinning the Preussag 1981 hole, b) test MMI soil geochemistry anomalies, 
c) test geophysical interpreted structure; d) test lithologies and stratigraphy; and 
definition drilling of mineralization intersected. The emphasis and targeting of the 
diamond drill programs has evolved to the definition drilling of gold mineralization 
associated with gold zones hosted in the AIC, Hangingwall AIC, Footwall AIC, porphyry 
zone, EWSZ and SWSZ or Rusk.  Table 11.1.2, summarizes the exploration target 
expected to be intersected for each drill hole. Compiled assay results from Lake Shore's 
press releases are presented in Table 11.1.3.  Located in Appendix 2, Table 11.1.4, 
prepared by the author, tabulates the returned assay results, and weighted average 
combinations of results greater than or equal to 1 gram per tonne gold.  Within this table 
an assay result, or an average of assay results must average 1 gram or greater before 
being combined into the composite assay.   To date no upper limit cutting factor is 
applied to gold assay averaging, or results presentations. 
 
11.2 Lake Shore Core Handling and Logging Protocols 
 
The diamond drillers secure the drill core boxes, at the drill site, for shipment from the 
field to the core logging facility located in the Bradley Bros. Ltd. ("Bradley") compound at 
3300 Riverside Drive, Timmins, Ontario.  The drill core is delivered to the core shack by 
the Bradley drill foreman.  Under the direct supervision of Mr. Jacques Samson, P.Geo., 
Lake Shore personnel open the boxes; check the metre markers for accuracy; label the 
boxes for hole number, box number and footage; prepare a quick log; take rock quality 



 64

designation ("RQD") measurements; photograph and log the core.  Geological logging is 
done directly into a computer using GEMCOM GEMS Custom Drill Logger software.  
The logging software was recently changed from DHLogger.  Diamond drill logs are then 
printed, reviewed and edited where required.   The logs are detailed, and are of very 
good quality, describing geology, structure, alteration, mineralization and do address 
transition problem areas where naming nomenclature presents difficulties. 
 
11.3 Hole Collar and Down-Hole Attitude Surveys 
 
The proposed drill hole locations are pegged on the ground referenced to a 63 kilometre 
control grid established by Vision Exploration in 2008.  Chainsaw cut lines are on 50 to 
100 metre spacing with labeled pickets every 25 metres provide adequate field control 
for exploration anomaly drill testing.  The "false origin" of the grid is coincident with the 
number three (3) post of patented claim P4040 (458,854.168m East, 5,358,786.3m 
North, Nad 83, Zone 17).  The surveyed post is the departure point for the baseline 
coordinate 65+00E / 100+25N.  The azimuth of the base line is 40 degrees from true 
north.  Grid line designation decreases southward.  All drill holes are spotted on the field 
grid coordinate system, initially using a hand held GPS.   On a regular basis or as 
required the collars are surveyed by L. Labelle Surveys of Timmins for a final collar 
location.  Table 11.1.1, lists the collar location, drill azimuth, hole inclination (drill dip) 
end of hole and the number of samples per hole.  Note that for diamond drill holes TC08-
51 to TC09-73 collar locations remain in field grid co-ordinates. The final collar survey is 
scheduled, but has not taken place at the time of writing this report.    
 
As the holes are drilling changes in azimuth and inclination are monitored at 30 to 50 
metre intervals using an EZ-shot Reflex instrument. Upon completion of a hole it is 
normal practice to have the holes resurveyed using a north-seeking gyro by 
Halliburton/Sperry Drilling Services of North Bay, Ontario.  If the north-seeking gyro is 
not available for surveying, a Maxibor instrument from Reflex Instruments of Timmins is 
used for the final direction and dip orientation survey.

12.0   SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
 
12.1 General 
 
Historical assay data from assessment T-Files or AFRI files has been accepted at face 
value.  In some cases copies of assay certificates have been submitted with the 
historical reports. Lake Shore has twinned historical holes and re-sampled showings for 
qualitative controlled assay results.  All diamond drill core is archived in core racks or 
cross piled in a secure systematic indexed core farm.  The sawn core half not sent for 
assay is available for check assay results.  Drill core from the Thunder Creek project is 
easily accessible for inspection, or re-logging.  Table 12.1.1 summarizes the diamond 
drill holes sample statistics, illustrating the number of samples, the number of returned 
assay results per drill hole equal or greater than 1 gram per tonne gold, the number of 
sample analysis equal to or greater than 34.29 grams per tonne gold (one ounce per ton 
gold) plus the number of assay samples taken and the method of analysis.

13.1 Sample Preparation and Assay Procedures 
 
The drill core is prepared, and logged by Lake Shore personnel or contract geologists 
and geo-technicians under the direction of Mr. Jacques Samson, P.Geo and project QP. 
After geological logging and photography is complete the core is given to a trained and 
supervised core sawing technician.  The technician saws the core along the designated 
lines and sample intervals prescribed by the Lake Shore geologist. Sample intervals 
ranging from 0.20 to 3.4 metres in length with the average sample length 0.79 metres. 
The core sample length is determined by the geologist based upon lithology, alteration, 
percent sulphides, the presence of visible gold, and geological contacts. Core to be sent 
for analysis is cut in half using a diamond blade core saw.  The core half not bagged and 
tagged for assay is returned to the core box with a sample tag number stapled into the 
core box.  All drill core is stored in a secure compound at the core logging facility in the 
Bradley industrial compound.  
 
Bagged core samples to be sent for analysis are placed in shipping bags sealed with a 
numbered security seal by Lake Shore personnel. These bags are shipped to a ALS 
Chemex prep lab facility.  During 2004 the samples were shipped via Manitoulin 
Transport directly to the ALS Chemex prep-lab in Mississauga.  In 2005 the samples 
were forward to the prep-lab in Sudbury, Ontario.  During the 2007-2009 drilling 
program, all samples were delivered by Lake Shore personnel directly to the ALS 
Chemex prep-lab in Timmins.  All samples are analyzed for gold using regular Fire 
Assay Technique.  In reporting assay results the protocol utilized by Lake Shore is 
Metallic assay results over ride Fire Assay with gravimetric finish with over rides Fire 
Assay with atomic absorption finish. 
 
Lake Shore Gold Corp. and West Timmins Mining Inc. personnel are not involved in the 
sample preparation once the sample leaves the core shack. 
 
The treatment of Lake Shore's drill core samples by ALS Chemex is outlined in the 
following descriptions, with references to the ALS Chemex procedure codes.  Samples 
are entirely crushed to 70 % passing 2 mm mesh. The crushed samples were split and a 
250 g sub-sample was pulverized to 85% passing <75 micron using a ring & puck 
pulverize (PREP-31). During the period of 2004 to 2007, a 50 g aliquot was taken from 
the pulp and analyzed by fire assay and atomic absorption methods (Au-AA24). For 
samples that returned a value greater then 3 gpt Au, another pulp was taken and 
analyzed using a gravimetric finish (Au-GRAV22). In October of 2007, the fusion weights 
were reduced from 50g to 30g (Au-AA23 and Au-GRAV21), in order to avoid delays with 
occasional "incomplete fusions" reported by the lab.   

Routinely, if visible gold was noted in the sample, samples are analyzed by the Pulp and 
Metallic method (Au-SCR24). In the phase 5 drill program all samples suspected of 
being from a mineralized zone location are analyzed using the pulp and metallic method.  
The entire samples were crushed to 70 % passing 6 mm mesh, and the entire sample 
was then pulverized to 85 % passing 75 micron (PREP-22). The pulp is passed through 
a 100 micron stainless steel screen and the entire (+) fraction is analyzed by fire assay 



 80

and gravimetric finish.  The (-) fraction is homogenized and two 50 g aliquots are 
analyzed by fire assay and atomic absorption finish (Au-AA26 and Au-AA26D).  The total 
gold content is then calculated by combining the weighted averages of the two fine 
fractions with the grade of the coarse fraction.  
 
Drill core from the first 50 holes (10,713 samples) were analyzed for arsenic (As) by 
aqua regia digestion and atomic absorption scanning (AA-45). In late 2007, No 
significant levels were reported and there does not seem to be a correlation with 
returned value and gold mineralization for the Thunder Creek Property 
 
A check-assay analysis was also done by the ALS Chemex for their internal quality 
control by analyzing a second pulp from the coarse reject on every twenty fifth sample 
received.  
 
13.2 Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
 
The QA/QC procedures implemented for the Thunder Creek Project follow the 2003 
recommended procedures by consultant, Mr. John Reddick, for Lake Shore Gold Corp.'s 
Timmins West Gold Project.  

Between November 2003 and June 24th, 2009 over 20,102 core samples have been 
taken and sent for analysis.  Additional certified standards and blanks were inserted to 
the sample stream of one each every twenty samples submitted for analysis.   

 
Drill core from a local, gold barren diabase dyke is used as a blank sample medium.  Cut 
diabase core is inserted at random approximately every 20. 
 
 
 13.2.1 Standards and Blanks 
 
Certified gold standards individually wrapped in 60g sealed envelopes were prepared by 
Ore Research and Exploration Pty. Ltd. of 6-8 Gatwick Road, Bayswater North, Victoria, 
Australia ("OREA") and provided by Analytical Solutions Ltd.  Several standards are 
used in order to vary the expected value and depending on availability.  These Certified 
Standards are purchased from Ms. Lynda Bloom, Analytical Solutions Ltd., at 1214-3266 
Yonge Street, Toronto, Ontario.  
 
 
 13.2.2  Check Analyses 
 
The QA/QC procedures have been monitored by Mr. Jacques Samson, P.Geo in a 
vigilant, however informal manor following the protocols established at the Timmins 
West project.  Check assays were requested on a non routine individual basis.  Lake 
Shore Gold have recently hired a database administrator to review all assay data, and 
rejecting analysis that does not meet a newly formulated QA/QC format standard.  An 
embedded routine is being established within the new logging GEMCOM logging system 
software to automatically flag samples that do not meet the protocol standards.

13.3 Security 
 
The Thunder Creek Project secure chain of custody for diamond drill core and samples  
starts at the drill and is completed with the safe return and storage of sample pulp and 
sample rejects locked garage storage facility.  Frequent, and unscheduled visits to the 
diamond drill sites are made to insure safety, good working practices and drill core 
security.  The core is transported from the field to the core logging facility by the drill 
foreman.  Lake Shore Gold Corp.'s personnel receive the core and carry out the logging 
and sample preparation procedures as previously described.  The samples are sent to 
an ALS Chemex pre-lab facility in secure, sealed shipping bags.   The return assay 
results are reviewed by Jacques Samson, the data base manager and selected 
members of the Lake Shore management group, on a need to know basis.   
 

 
 

14.0   DATA VERIFICATION AND SITE VISIT 
 
Lake Shore Gold Corp. have provided detailed information of the exploration programs 
in the form of: GIS data base, diamond drill logs, assay results spreadsheets, assay 
certificates, MMI sample sites and lab analysis results, and maps.  From the public 
domain, SEDAR filings of press releases, and technical reports for Band-Ore Resources, 
West Timmins Mining Inc and Lake Shore.  Historical assessment report files have been 
reviewed by the author both at the MNDM office in Porcupine and the AFRI files on line. 
 
The author has personally checked the MNDM claim registry for the Thunder Creek 
Claim ownership and found it to be as described by Lake Shore and West Timmins 
Mining. 
 
The author has reviewed, and compared, finalized ALS Chemex Webtrieve analysis 
worksheets with Lake Shore's drill database for the mineralized zones. This comparison 
totaled 979 samples from 43 drill holes. The database is true to the assay certificates 
reviewed.   
 
A site visit confirming field work discussed in this report took place May 29, 2009.  A 
review of the core shack, drill core geology, core logging and assay sampling 
procedures, core, pulp and reject storage facilities took place  on May 5th, June 1st, and 
June 29th, 2009.  Located in Appendix 3 is a traverse plot map (Figure, Appendix 3.1) of 
locations on the property visited as well as a collection of plates of photos taken. 
 

 
 

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
Within a 3 kilometre buffer of the Thunder Creek Property there is no open ground 
available for staking. Contiguous to the northern claim boundary is Lake Shore's 
Timmins West Gold Property.  West of the Thunder Creek project mineral rights are 
registered to Mr. L Gervais/1571925 Ontario Ltd., and West Timmins Mining Inc. (WTM).  
South and south west of the Property claims area owned by Richmond Mines Inc., and 
WTM. East of the project claims are titled to Red Pine Exploration, Probe Mines Limited 
and WTM. North of Lake Shore's Thunder Creek and the Timmins West Gold properties 



 82

the claims are registered to International Explorers and Prospectors Inc., Xstrata Copper 
Corporation, and Probe Mines Limited. 
 
There is no significant historical or present gold production within the immediate area of 
the Property.  Two properties adjacent to the Thunder Creek Property have NI 43-101 
compliant resource estimates.   
 
On August 28, 2007 Lake Shore Gold Corp. issued a press release announcing the 
results of the SRK mineral reserve estimates and results from the pre-feasibility study for 
the Timmins West Property.   The reserve estimate is based on a cut gold grade totaling 
3,386,000 tonnes at 7.59 grams per tonne gold for 826,000 (cut) ounces in the 
"Probable" category.  The mineral resource estimates include an "Indicated" resource of 
3,268,000 tonnes at a cut grade of 8.62 g/tonne Au for a contained 905,000 ounces of 
gold. Uncut the indicated resource has 1,287,000 ounces of contained gold at a grade of 
12.29 g/tonne gold.  In addition an "Inferred" cut resource includes 968,000 tonnes at 
5.54 g/tonne Au for 174,700 contained ounces gold.  The inferred uncut resource 
estimates 205,000 contained ounces of gold at a grade of 6.62 g/tonne. 
 
To the south of the Thunder Creek Property situated in Thorneloe Township is WTM's 
Thorne Property.  In 1997-98 Mr. J. Spiteri and Spiteri Geological and Mining 
Consultants Inc. were commissioned by Band-Ore Resources Ltd. to review all diamond 
drilling and generate a mineral resource for the Thorne Property's "Golden River Zones".  
Hosted within a 750 metre wide deformation zone the mineralization discovered is 
collectively made up of 13 zones.  Cavey (2002) in a Summary Report on the Thorne 
Property quotes Mr. Spiteri as stating, "the inferred resource estimate in 1997-98 on the 
Thorne Property totaling approximately 4 million tonnes of 3 g/t for about 400,000 
contained gold ounces qualifies as an "Inferred Resource" under the Guidelines of NI 43-
101".  
  
The "Mahoney Creek" (MDI number mdi42A05SE00005) gold occurrence is situated a 
3.5 kilometres southwest of the Thunder Creek project claim boundary in Denton 
Township.  This property is registered to Richmond Mines Inc. The occurrence has  
been drill tested by Hollinger with the best assay being 13.37 g/tonne Au over 1.5m; and 
8.9 g/tonne over 2.75m (hole 8).  The mineral inventory data base indicates that Gowest 
established a zone averaging 4.46 g/tonne Au over 4.4m width for a length of 24.4m.  
During diamond drilling of the mineralized zone Gowest intersected in drill hole 87-12,  
6.6 g/tonne Au over 4.6m. 
 
 
 

16.0   MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
No mineral resource or reserve estimate has been made for the Thunder Creek 
Property.     
 
 

17.0   MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLUGICAL TESTING 
 
Lake Shore Gold Corp has not submitted samples from the Thunder Creek Property for 
metallurgical testing.  One historical sample of the alkalic intrusive complex was 



 83

submitted to Texasgulf Inc by Mr. Jim Croxall (AFRI No. 42A05NE8430).  At this time the 
sample results are not considered to be relevant to Lake Shore's exploration programs.  
 
Petrology, ore microcopy and scanning electron microscope investigations have been 
carried out on selected diamond drill core samples from drill holes TC04-13, TC07-27, 
TC07-30 and TC07-37 (2008) and TC08-51, TC08-52, TC08-54(663), TC08-54(668) and 
sample TC1891 (2009) by Miller and Associates of Ottawa. 
 
 

 
18.0   OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

 
To the best of the author's knowledge all relevant data has been presented with in this 
report.  The diamond drilling continues on the project, and there are eight (8) drill holes 
in various stages of completion that information was not finalized at the time of writing 
this report.  Data and information cut off for this report is May 10th, 2009 
 
 

19.0   INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The work programs and data reviewed by the author are of high professional quality.  
The Lake Shore Gold Corp.'s interpretation of the data is up to date and within the 
parameters of current geological understanding.    
 
Gold mineralization at Thunder Creek is hosted within a wide southwest trending 
tectonic zone.  Within the tectonic zone there is an anastomosing highly strained 
southwest trending fabric that is named the South West Shear Zone ("SWSZ").  Cross 
cutting the SWSZ and parallel to the Bristol fault is an East West strain fabric named the 
East-West Shear Zone ("EWSZ").  From airborne magnetic geophysical data and 
interpretation there appears to be a significant flexure, and with possible a right lateral 
displacement associated with the East- West shear. An alternative interpretation of the 
apparent displacement is the surface trace of a fold flexure changing dip that occurs 
along the contact of the mafic volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  The Tisdale mafic 
volcanics are overturned and dipping steeply to the west and north-west.  The volcanics 
exhibit a hanging wall relationship to the unconformable Porcupine sediments.  An 
ancestral south-west trending structure provided a discordant, pathway for the alkalic 
intrusive complex to invade the mafic volcanics and sediments.  Re-activation of the 
structure imprinted a high strain tectonic fabric within a narrower zone hosting mafic 
volcanics, the portions of the alkalic intrusive complex ("AIC") and the sediments.  This 
zone appears to be spatially associated with the volcanic-sedimentary rock contact and 
prepared the ground for fluid pathways to alter the host rock and transport the sulphides, 
and gold.  The number of gold mineralizing events at Thunder Creek has not been 
determined.  Gold occurs as native gold, electrum, tellurides and in association with 
pyrite, galena, sphalerite, quartz, and quartz-ankerite.   Significant gold mineralization 
intersected at -500m from surface, demonstrate a presently interpreted strike length of 
250 metres and is hosted within a tectonite zone.  The tectonite includes host rocks of 
mafic volcanics, sediments, AIC, felsic intrusions of porphyry and syenite with lithons of 
less altered and less foliated wall rock surrounded by a very high strain mylonitic folded 
foliation fabric.  Within the high strain zone boudinage, pinch and swell and ptygmatic 
folding textures are witnessed.   
 



 84

Bore hole TC09-68b has returned the best assay results intersected within the Thunder 
Creek property.  The pierce point of this hole, as demonstrated on a longitudinal 
projection, occurs approximately 42 metres above the parent hole TC09-68 and 
approximately 33 metres above the first wedge splay TC09-68a.  This intersection also 
occurs approximately 717 metres below surface and at an approximate distance of 88 
metres from TC09-69 and 131 metres from TC09-70.  The weighted average of returned 
gold analysis is 12.75 grams per tonne over 83.4 metres.  Gold mineralization greater 
than 1 gram per tonne is reported for 102 core samples of which 7 samples exceeded 
values of 34.29 g/tonne (1 ounce/ton Au). 
 
Given the successful results targeting the Rusk targets at depth, and along strike an 
aggressive drill campaign of systematic grid drilling down dip, down plunge and along 
strike is warranted. 
 
 
 

20.0   RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
20.1 General 
 
Diamond drilling on the Thunder Creek Project has advanced from grassroots anomaly 
testing to mineralized zones definition drilling phase.  With the evolution to an advanced 
mineralization definition program, changes in some of the current procedures with allow 
better efficiency in processing larger amounts of drill core, and returned and distribution 
of assay data.  The work observed to date is of good quality and is of very high, 
professional standards. 
 
 It is the opinion of the author that all drill holes targeting the definition of ore grade 
mineralization have collars and front sites surveyed to an ideal "engineering grid."  This 
will enable more control of the hole location for resource calculation.  This will also help 
to elevate any errors that may occur with the use of a hand held GPS and the field grid.  
 
The present core storage and logging location is choked with drill core from the Thunder 
Creek property and the Timmins West Gold Property.  The Timmins West Project core 
should be moved out to a prepared core farm on the Timmins West Gold Mine site.   
With the initiation of an accelerated drilling program at the Thunder Creek Property,   
archiving and relocating of early Thunder Creek exploration core that would not be used 
in a future resource calculation, to one of Lake Shore's mine sites, should be 
considered.   
 
RQD measurements are being taken in the core logging procedure.  It is recommended 
that measurements of additional physical rock properties also be taken.  For example, 
specific gravity of the various mineralized zones and lithological units; rock hardness; 
and perhaps a testing for carbonate. These measurements assist in planning and 
resource calculations for an advanced underground exploration-development program.  
 
With an increase of exploration activities the office, day to day management, and 
administrative functions currently residing at the core shack should be relocated to the 
more central location.  Along with the move it would be practical to have all project files 
consolidated, organized, and complete at one central location.  This will help prepare the 
setting for the next phase of ore resource calculation by in house or outside consultants.  



 85

 
The time line from the collaring of a drill hole to finalization and validation of the assays 
should be reviewed, and steps taken to speed up the process without sacrificing the high 
quality standard of data gathering.   
 
Changes to the present sampling assay preparation stream should be considered with 
the change to an advanced exploration program.  The contracting of a certified sample 
preparation laboratory to prepare multiple aliquots of each sample, and insert standards, 
blanks and duplicate samples for analysis by a separate second and at times a third 
laboratory would add greater quality control and increase the confidence levels of the 
returned assay results.  This would provide a more uniform in sample size, and increase 
the contact between the sample prep lab, and the quality control-data base manager so 
they could supervise and inspect the preparation process.  The "blank" sample should 
contain gold values lower than the detection limit (<5 ppb Au) and will check the sample 
order and possible contamination during the pulverizing process.   "Standard" samples 
are used to check the accuracy of the assay procedure.  The "duplicate" sample will 
check precision of the assay and potential nugget variance.  Having multiple sample 
aliquots from the original reject and pulp roll will provide a more uniform sample to send 
to an umpire lab or perform a metallic analysis.  It is recommended that one individual be 
dedicated to tracking the results of the check procedures and take immediate corrective 
measures to resolve the cause of any discrepancy in returned assay results. 
 
It is recommended that a calculated horizontal width or true width of the assay intervals 
provided beside the core lengths on longitudinal sections and press releases. 
 
Computer logging and plotting of drill sections does not readily allow the plotting of 
structure along the side of the hole.  As the mineralized zone is situated in a tectonite the 
it is recommended that the foliations, and other structures be plotted along the drill hole 
traces to allow a visual perspective of the kinematic indicators approaching or within the 
tectonite.  This may enhance the understanding for interpretive purpose. 
 
Gold mineralization is hosted within a structural setting.  In order to maximize the 
understanding of the structural history and overprinting and effect on mineralization a 
geological structural consultant be contracted to map the property and review the drill 
core.  
 
Given the successful results targeting the Rusk targets at depth, and along strike an 
aggressive drill campaign of systematic grid drilling down dip, down plunge and along 
strike is warranted. 
 
A preliminary resource calculation and block modeling should be targeted to be 
completed within the next 6 to 9 months.  The block modeling of the mineralized zones 
will help guide the drill hole definition, and step out targeting. 
 
At Thunder Creek the gold mineralization is hosted within a tectonite zone that straddles 
the volcanic, sediment contact and portions of the alkalic intrusive complex.  It appears 
to be one zone with multiple higher grade shoots within.  The definition drilling required 
to join up one shoot to another from hole to hole may require the drilling off at 12.5 metre 
centres.  With target depths at  - 400 to – 1000 metres below surface this type of detail 
drilling is not practical from surface.  With continued success in intersecting significant 
ore grade gold tenor, an underground exploration program of drill drifting, mineralization 



 86

cross cutting, mapping and sampling on more than one level, with a raise between levels 
to determine mineralization continuity should be considered.  A two level drifting program 
will allow a significant bulk sample to be taken and mill tested.   
 
 
20.2 Lake Shore Proposed Work Plan and Budget 
 
 
The recommended work program and budget for the Thunder Creek project includes 
detailed sectional diamond drilling of the Rusk Zone (44,000 metres) at 50 metre centres 
testing above -800 metres; intermediate step out diamond drilling at 100 to 200 metre 
centres along the extensions of the Rusk Zone (19,000 metres) to test the along strike 
and dip potential of the north and south extensions; and wide spaced exploratory drilling 
to test a variety of "other targets" at the Thunder Creek property (5,000 metres).  "Other 
targets" include the southwest extension of the volcanic and sedimentary contact from 
the Rusk Zone, as well as the margins of the syenite stock located to the immediate 
south of the Rusk Zone.  As a result of receiving encouraging ore grade drill intercepts 
an underground program of driving a drill drift platform on two levels and bulk sampling 
is in the cost review and planning stage.   
 
The purpose of new diamond drill program is to accelerate the evaluation of the 
mineralization at depth and work toward a resource estimate that could be developed 
into a mineral reserve.  The estimated budget required to carry out the recommendations 
presented in this report is tabulated in Table 20.2.1 Cost Estimate of Recommendations.  
The prices listed are estimates only, based upon prices provided by persons within the 
Lake Shore Gold Corp. management group.  The prices are based upon current labour, 
contract costs, and Lake Shore's tracking of project expenditures in the Timmins area.  
The estimated numbers reflect possible all up charges and costs per activity.  
Recommended activities, such as adding additional structural information to the drill 
sections, which bear no additional costs to the exploration program are not shown in the 
table. The planning of an underground exploration drilling program is differed and is not 
included in the proposed expenditures listed below.
