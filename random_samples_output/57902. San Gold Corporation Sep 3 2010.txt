SUMMARY 
This technical report (the "Report") has been prepared by Geoex Limited at the request of the management of San Gold 
Corporation ("the Company").  The report was authored by Mr. Peter George, B.Sc., P.Geo.  Mr. George ("the Author") 
has over 40 years of experience in the mining industry including extensive experience in the gold exploration and 
mining sector in Canada.  In the past 5 years the Author has completed resource reports and/or geological potential 
reports on 4 significant Archean gold projects Gold Eagle's (now Goldcorp) Bruce Channel deposit in Red Lake, 
Ontario, Valgold's (now Northern Gold) Jonpol deposit in Garrison Township, Timmins area, Black Pearl's (now 
Canadian Lithium) Tully deposit in the Timmins area, and the Company's Rice Lake Mine ("RLM"), SG-1 Mine, 
Hinge Mine, 007 Zone, Cartwright Zone, SG-2 Zone, and SG-3 Zone in Bissett, Manitoba. 

The purpose of this technical report (the "Report") is to provide a current (effective date June 30, 2010) resource 
estimate for the Company's Rice Lake Project area (the Property) in Bissett, Manitoba.  The gold mineralization in the 
area occurs in quartz veins located in shear-type and tensional-type fractures in lithologies that are more brittle than the 
surrounding lithologies.  The gold-mineralized structures are related to the Rice Lake Mine shear-structures and are 
hosted in the the San Antonio Mine (the" SAM") unit and overlying volcanic rocks.   The SAM Unit is a gabbro sill that 
hosts the gold-bearing quartz veins of the RLM.  The Report also includes an interpretation of Lidar airborne imagery 
acquired in 2009 that provides significant insights into the regional structural setting of the vein systems. 

The format and content of the Report are intended to conform to Form 43-101F1 of National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 
43-101") of the Canadian Securities Administrators. 

Note that during the long operational history at the RLM the technical data has consistently been in Imperial Measures.  
Imperial units of feet, miles, troy ounces, short tons (2000 pounds), etc. continue to be used throughout the current 
operations.  The mine grid is in feet and the surface elevation at the top of the RLM shaft collar is nominally the 10000 
level. 

The Project area is comprised of Mining Lease 63, covering an area of 996.9 hectares around the Rice Lake Mine, and 
40 mining claims covering an area of 4,658 hectares contiguous to Mineral Lease 63.  An additional 41 non-contiguous 
mining claims covering an area of 4,032 hectares are located in the surrounding area to the west, south and east of 
Mineral Lease 63.  All of the current resources occur on the Mining Lease. 

The following table, with an effective date of June 30, 2010, summarizes the mineral resources for the Rice Lake 
Project.  Note that the numbers have been rounded from the detailed resource estimates.

The mineral resources are in-situ, undiluted, and uncapped and have not had economic parameters applied to them.   

The 2009 bulk sample milling at Hinge recovered 16,052 ounces of gold.  Assuming 93% mill recovery, 95% mine recovery, and 
20% dilution the bulk sample equates to an in-situ resource of 45,000 tonnes grading 0.38 ounces per ton. This reconciles well with 
the average grade of the Hinge uncapped measured plus indicated resources.  Further, monthly average grade fed to the mill (based 
on hourly mill belt samples) ranged from 0.25 to 0.64 ounces per ton, which indicates the variability of average grades over an area 
approximately 400 feet high by 700 feet along strike.  

Reconciliation of Company reserve estimates based on assay data, underground face samples, and mill belt samples indicate that 
the sampling and assaying protocols are providing good quality data.  

The Company monitors the QAQC information for the assaying process on a regular basis (standards and blanks sent to assay 
laboratories and the duplicates and replicates done by the laboratories).  The Author has reviewed this information.  

The mineral resources are defined in terms of NI 43-101 regulations and their estimation was carried out using industry standard 
polygonal longitudinal section methodology.  The drill hole data was evaluated in plan and section in three dimensional AutoCAD 
to determine continuity between holes. Vein structures in the RLM area have vertical extents from 4 to 8 times their strike length.  
Because of this, areas of influence used around drill hole pierce points on the longitudinal section for purposes of defining 
measured and indicated resources are ellipses, elongate down dip.  For measured resources an ellipse with short axis of 50 feet and 
long axis of 100 feet was used; for indicated resources an ellipse with short axis 75 feet and long axis 150 feet was used, and for 
drill inferred resources an ellipse with short axis of 100 feet and long axis of 225 feet was used.  Additional inferred resources are 
based upon projection of measured plus indicated resources to a total depth of up to 4 times the strike length of the mineralized 
zone, provided that the zone is open at depth.  A tonnage factor of 11.4 cubic feet per ton (equivalent to a specific gravity of 2.8) 
was used to convert polygon volumes to tons.  

The Company's production department uses Amine software for reserve estimation and mine planning.  Amine is a 3D AutoCAD 
based system that uses block modelling to determine reserve and resource estimates.  

The Author concludes that the data density and reliability of the drilling and sampling database is sufficient to complete an estimate 
of mineral resources for the Rice Lake Project.  

The Author has relied on data provided by qualified persons (as defined in NI 43-101) who are employees of the Company.  In the 
Author's opinion these qualified persons are competent and, other than errors or omissions that may inadvertently occur, have 
provided the Author with all of the data necessary to complete this Report.

The Author has no reason to believe that there are any deficiencies in information that has been received from other 
experts that would have a material impact on the opinions, conclusions and recommendations expressed by the Author 
in this Report 

During 2009 a ramp was completed to access the Hinge zone to allow an initial bulk sample test and to determine 
continuity of the vein structure.  As noted above, the bulk sample was batched through the RLM mill during the second 
half of 2009 and reconciles well with the current Geoex resource estimates.  The Hinge zone has since been developed 
over approximately 500 vertical feet from the 9850 level down to the 9320 level with planned production of 109,895 
tons of resources grading 0.35 ounces per ton for 2010. 

The 007 Zone was discovered in the fall of 2009.  The 007 Zone is located approximately 2000 feet southeast of the 
Hinge zone.  The Company has extended a decline from the Hinge mine workings to the 007 Zone.  The ramp has 
provide access to 007 Zone for bulk sampling and confirmation of the continuity of the vein structure on the 9220 
Level.  Planned bulk sampling from 007 Zone in 2010 will be 31,850 tons of resource at a grade of 0.45 ounces per ton.  
In addition the decline will provide access to cut drill stations to test the Hinge and L10 at depth, to test other zones that 
have been indicated by drilling between Hinge and 007 Zone, and to test 007 Zone down dip and along strike at depth. 

Historic exploration in the Bissett area focused on vein structures within the SAM unit and gold mineralization 
discovered along the Normandy Shear Zone to the east of the Rice Lake Mine.  There were a few gold showings 
discovered in the Bidou Lake Assemblage north of the SAM unit, however, exploration shafts were unsuccessful in 
establishing significant resources and it was concluded that the Bidou Lake sequence was not structurally conducive to 
the development of large, gold-bearing zones. 

In 2008, Bill Ferreira, an exploration consulting geologist to the Company, recognized that the historic exploration 
shafts to the east of the Rice Lake mine formed a pattern suggestive of north-northeast trending cross structures spaced 
approximately 1500 feet apart and further, that a similar pattern was apparent in the upper and lower parts of the Rice 
Lake Mine in terms of the location of the vein structures in the upper levels compared to those below the 26 Level.  Mr. 
Ferreira termed these cross structures "hinges" and recommended a program of surface drilling in the vicinity of the 
exploration shafts on the Wingold and Gold Standard showings which were located on the first "hinge" immediately to 
the east of the Rice Lake Mine.  Early in the drill program, what is now known as the Hinge Mine, was intersected and 
successful follow-up drilling resulted in development starting in early 2009. 

Vein structures and mineralogy in the Hinge Mine are very similar to the 16-type and 38-type veins in the Rice Lake 
Mine.  In the Author's opinion the strike length and depth continuity potential of the vein structures at the Hinge should 
be similar to those at the Rice Lake Mine. 

Following discovery of the Hinge Mine, the company continued surface exploration drilling which resulted in the 
discovery of four additional zones (Cohiba, L13, 007 and Emperor, See Figure 2) in a similar geological setting within 
the Bidou Lake Assemblage. 

An airborne LIDAR Survey is the only exploration done by the Company other than surface and underground drilling, 
the results of which are discussed in Sections 10 and 16,  

There is a wide-range of structural information (bedding planes, shearing, lineations, joints, geological contacts, etc) 
that can be extracted from the LIDAR bare earth digital terrain model.  Note that when viewed in Adobe Acrobat PDF 
format the quality of the data is apparent even though the graphics are significantly degraded from the original product 
in order to keep the size of the drawing files reasonable. 

The Author's preliminary evaluation focused on the major faults and related shears that are apparent in the LIDAR data.  
The Wanipigow Fault marks the boundary between the Uchi volcanic-plutonic terrain and the Wanipigow (Manitoba)-
Berens River (Ontario) metamorphic plutonic terrain.  The Wanipigow Fault extends to the east through the Red Lake 
Area of Ontario.  The Normandy fault and the other shear zones all appear to be splays off of the Wanipigow, which, 
from east to west, splay off from the south side of the Wanipigow Fault, initially trending to the southwest and then 
gradually swinging to a west to west northwest strike direction.  Beyond the west boundary of the map area some of the 
shears veer back up and rejoin the south side of the Wanipigow Fault. 

From the Author's experience in the area it was also apparent that these LIDAR shears have the same orientations as 
shears that cross the SAM unit and are structurally related to the shear-type and tensional-type gold bearing quartz veins 
in the RLM.  The Author, based on maps contained in a report by Rhys (2001), constructed 3-dimensional models of the 
major shear-type vein systems in the RLM and projected them up plunge to surface and found that their surface 
locations plotted very close to where the LIDAR conjugate shears cross the surface trace of the SAM unit which hosts

the RLM gold mineralization.  Further, there is a close spatial association of the new discoveries in the volcanic rocks 
that overlie the SAM Unit (Hinge, 007, L13, Cohiba and Emperor) and the Lidar shear systems. 

Based upon this 3-dimensional correlation the Author concludes that the LIDAR shears correlate with the RLM shears 
and hence the Hinge-type mineralization in the volcanic rocks in the hanging wall of the SAM unit are hosted in the 
same structures and thus are part of the same mineralizing event as the RLM gold mineralization. 

This interpretation has significant implications regarding the depth potential of the newly discovered mineralization at 
the Hinge and 007 as these structures within the RLM contain gold mineralization from surface to over 5000 feet below 
surface (7000 feet down the dip of the veins).  The RLM mineralization is open at depth below 5000 feet. 

Anderson (2008) provides the regional trends of lineations that occur within the shears.  Based upon the LIDAR 
interpretation there is a reasonably accurate indication of the variations in the strike of the shears.  As the lineations lie 
in the plane of the shear, if an estimate of the direction and angle of plunge of the lineation can be made then variations 
in the dip of individual shears can be determined.  This can then be applied in 3D Autocad and a reasonably accurate 3D 
model of the shear systems and the known gold resources can be created.  It is beyond the scope of this Report to 
complete such a study, however, the Author is of the opinion that such a study is warranted.  It will provide new 
insights for the geological staff who are dealing with the structural complexities of the Rice Lake Project on a daily 
basis and further it will be a valuable tool in illustrating the nature of the structures to third parties who have an interest 
in the Property. 

The economic assessment contained in this Report indicates that the Rice Lake Project is economically viable.  The 
following is a summary of key economic results.

The economic assessment includes only measured and indicated resources, however, all of the development capital 
required to convert the inferred resources to reserves and develop those resources has been included in the economic 
assessment. 

Over a 5.5-year mine-life the project will generate $407 million cash surplus before taxes and cashflow from operations 
(EBITDA) of $463 million (average EBITDA approximately $84 million per year).  The breakeven life-of-mine gold 
price is US$575 to allow for recovery of ongoing development capital expenses. 

The project has positive cash flow from operations at gold prices in excess of US$575. 

In Geoex's opinion, given the current inventory of approximately 3.7 million tons of inferred resources and the long 
operating history of the Rice Lake Project, it is probable that sufficient inferred resources will be converted to resources 
to achieve a minimum of 10 years of mine life. 

NI 43-1-1 Cautionary Note - Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic 
viability and there is no certainty that the results of the economic assessment will be realized. 

The capital development allocated in the model is sufficient to fund conversion of inferred resources to reserves and as 
well has the capability to potentially add additional inferred resources to the current indicated resource inventory. 

The Author concludes that the work completed to date on the Property has demonstrated the presence of significant gold 
resources that warrant additional surface and underground exploration and development programs with the objective to 
confirm the geometry and continuity of the vein structures and to confirm sufficient measured and indicated mineral 
resources to warrant completion of internal feasibility studies.

The Author recommends the following: 

1. The Company should continue funding an aggressive exploration program in the Rice Lake Area. 
2. The Company should create a 3D model of the major shear structures and resource areas on the property to 

provide a tool for use by its Exploration and Production Geologists as well as for use with third parties who 
have an interest in the Property. 

3. The Company should initiate underground bulk sampling programs on the L10, L13, and Cohiba exploration 
targets. 

4. As this Report will be made public it is inappropriate for the Author to provide other specific recommendations 
relative to ongoing exploration concepts and targets.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 GE NERAL 

This technical report ("the Report") has been prepared by Geoex Limited ("Geoex") at the request of the management 
of San Gold Corporation ("the Company").  The author of the Report, Mr. Peter George, B.Sc., P.Geo ("the Author") 
has over 40 years experience in the mining industry including extensive experience in the gold exploration and mining 
sector in Canada. 

The Company has accepted that the qualifications, expertise, experience, competence and professional reputation of Mr. 
George are appropriate and relevant for the preparation of this Report.  In the past 5 years the Author has completed 
resource reports and/or geological potential reports on 4 significant Archean gold projects Gold Eagle's (now Goldcorp) 
Bruce Channel deposit in Red Lake, Ontario, Valgold's (now Northern Gold) Jonpol deposit in Garrison Township, 
Timmins area, Black Pearl's (now Canadian Lithium) Tully deposit in the Timmins area, and the Company's Rice Lake 
Mine ("RLM"), SG-1 Mine, Hinge Mine, 007 Zone, Cartwright Zone, SG-2 Zone, and SG-3 Zone in Bissett, Manitoba. 

The purpose of this technical report (the "Report") is to provide a current (effective date June 30, 2010) resource 
estimate for the Company's Rice Lake Project area (the Property) in Bissett, Manitoba.  The gold mineralization in the 
area occurs in quartz veins located in shear-type and tensional-type fractures in lithologies that, during late-stage 
retrograde metamorphism, are more brittle than the surrounding lithologies.  The gold-mineralized structures are related 
to the Rice Lake Mine shear-structures and are hosted in the the San Antonio Mine (the" SAM") unit and overlying 
volcanic rocks.   The SAM Unit is a gabbro sill that hosts the gold-bearing quartz veins of the RLM.  The Report also 
includes an interpretation of newly acquired Lidar airborne imagery that provides significant insights into the regional 
structural setting of the vein systems. 

The Company's mining claims and operating assets (the "Property") are located in Bissett, Manitoba, approximately 
145 road-miles (230 kilometres) north-northeast of Winnipeg, Manitoba. 

The Project area is comprised of Mining Lease 63, covering an area of 996.9 hectares around the Rice Lake Mine, and 
40 mining claims covering an area of 4,658 hectares contiguous to Mineral Lease 63.  An additional 41 non-contiguous 
mining claims covering an area of 4,032 hectares are located in the surrounding area to the west, south and east of 
Mineral Lease 63.  All of the current resources occur on the Mining Lease. 

The Company has a modern gold mill capable of processing 1250 tons of ore per day, and modern surface infrastructure 
including a licensed tailings management facility.  Current production is from the Rice Lake Mine (formerly known as 
the Bissett Mine in recent decades and as the San Antonio Mine from 1932 to 1968) and from the newly discovered 
Hinge Mine. 

1.2 TERMS  OF REFERENCE 

The purpose of this technical report (the "Report") is to provide a current (effective date June 30, 2010) resource,

4.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPY 

4.1 ACCESS IBILITY 

Bissett can be reached via Winnipeg by all weather Provincial Trunk Highways and Provincial Roads. A small 
emergency gravel airstrip is situated 19 km east of Bissett.  Rice Lake serves as a base for float-equipped aircraft during 
the summer months. 

4.2 CLIM ATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

Average relief in the Property area is in the order of approximately 40 to 60 metres with elongate outcrop ridges 
separated by low lying ground with swamps, rivers and lakes. 

This area of eastern Manitoba has average annual precipitation of approximately 430 mm of rain. Winter snow 
accumulations of up to 145 cm occur between October and March.  Average winter temperature is -16°C with extended 
periods of -20 to -25°C.  Average summer temperature is 16°C. 

The vegetation consists of typical Canadian Shield boreal forest.  Poplar, balsam, spruce, and pine are the dominant tree 
species. 

Outcrop exposure is excellent in most areas although there is a thin veneer of organics and lichen growth that inhibits 
detailed observations. 

4.3 LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

Bissett is an established mining community with a population of 340 people.  Mining supplies, equipment and services 
and a skilled mining and mineral exploration workforce are readily available in the southern Manitoba area.  The 
Company has a training program in-place to provide job opportunities to local First Nations persons. 

Manitoba Hydro provides electrical power.  Fuel is trucked in from Winnipeg.  There is abundant water in the area. 

The Company owns a 100% interest in a modern 1,250 ton per day processing plant and a fully permitted tailings 
management facility.  The Company has sufficient accommodation for all personnel and provides cafeteria services for 
employees that are housed in on-site bunkhouse accommodation. 

5.0 PROJECT HISTORY 
The following summary of the Project history is subdivided into the Rice Lake Mine property and the San Gold 
Minerals property for the period prior to June 2005 when each was a separate operating entity with different historic 
ownership 

5.1 PERIOD 1912 TO 2005 

5.1.1 Rice Lake Mine Property 

The Rice Lake Greenstone Belt is located at the west end of the Uchi Subprovince of the Archean aged Superior 
Province of the Canadian Shield (Figure 1).  The original discovery of gold on the San Antonio property was made in 
1911.  The first attempt at underground development on the San Antonio property was in 1927 when the No. 1 
exploration shaft was sunk to 164 feet and No.2 shaft (3-compartment) was sunk to 300 feet.  Approximately 2,000 feet 
of lateral development was completed in 1927.  Results were not up to expectations, however, during 1928 the syndicate 
proceeded to deepen the No. 2 shaft to 600 feet and the No. 1 vein was discovered on the 600 foot-level.  It was not 
until 1929 when the No. 09 vein was discovered on the 725 foot-level that economic viability of the project became 
apparent. 

Sufficiently encouraging underground results were obtained by 1931 that the new San Antonio Gold Mines Ltd. 
commenced construction of a mill and power line and production began in May 1932 at a rate of 150 tons per day, 
increasing to 350 tons per day in 1935 and to 550 tons per day by 1948. 

Access to the mine was primarily by the No. 1 shaft (now called the A-Shaft) and four internal winzes 3A, 3B, 3C. 

Underground development was by driving footwall drifts on each level.  Flat drill holes on 50 foot centres were used to 
establish the location of veins on the level prior to establishing drifts along the full length of ore zones.  Mining was by 
the shrinkage method with a minimum mining width of 4 feet. 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010  Page 14 

The 550 ton per day mill was comprised of a crushing plant located adjacent to the collar of the main shaft (now known 
as A-Shaft) with a conveyor to the mill building.  Following the ball mill circuit, concentrating and blanket tables and 
an amalgam table recovered about 12% of the total gold.  The tails from the gravity circuit then went through a standard 
Merrill Crowe cyanide plant to recover the balance of the gold. 

The mill superintendent (Reynolds 1942, p.16-17) noted that without the gravity circuit, coarse free gold would build up 
in the circuit and erratic high tailings losses would occur. 

The surface hoist was destroyed by fire in July 1968 and production ended.  San Antonio Mines Ltd. declared 
bankruptcy and the assets were acquired by New Forty Four Mines.  In 1980 the San Antonio mill was destroyed by 
fire. 

In 1980 Brinco Mining Limited entered into a joint venture with New Forty Four Mines.  Brinco undertook a program 
of underground exploration drilling during the period 1980-83 and about 100,000 tons were mined and trucked to Flin 
Flon for processing.  Brinco earned a 100% interest in the project, however, after 1983 did no significant work. 

In 1987 an Inco subsidiary entered into an agreement with Brinco and completed over 20,000 feet of drilling.  Inco 
opted out of the venture in 1988. 

In 1989 Rea Gold Corp. acquired the property from Brinco.  Wright Engineers and Dolmage Campbell completed a due 
diligence study for Rea Gold prior to acquisition of the project in 1989.  At that time the reserve was estimated to be 
1,225,642 tons grading 0.22 ounces gold per ton.  A prefeasibility study by Kilborn Engineering in 1993 recommended 
that the mineable reserve base needed to be increased prior to making a production decision. 

In 1994 Rea Gold undertook a $3.1 million underground rehabilitation and exploration program to gain access to the 
lower levels of the mine and delineate additional mineable reserves.  This program resulted in an increase in mineable 
reserves to 1,976,901 tons grading 0.21 ounces gold per ton. 

A feasibility study was completed by Rea Gold and Simmons Engineering in 1995 and construction and development 
towards a 1,000 ton per day operation was initiated.  Rea Gold established a new mine access system that significantly 
streamlined the mining operation.  Historically the mine was accessed by the A-shaft followed by 3 internal winzes (B-
Shaft, C-Shaft, and D-Shaft).  Ore from the D-Shaft area had to be trammed and hoisted 4 times to get it to the surface.  
Rea Gold deepened the A-Shaft to link it directly with the upper level of the D-Shaft area thereby eliminating two 
cycles of tramming and hoisting. 

By 1997 Rea Gold had established a modern, 1,000 tonne per day gold mining and processing facility at a total cost of 
approximately $90 million.  Prior to production commencing Rea Gold was placed into receivership and the receiver 
put the assets up for sale.  Harmony was the successful bidder and took over the project in 1998. 

After acquiring the assets from the receiver, Harmony Canada invested approximately $30 million to establish a ramp 
system in the lower part of the D-Shaft area in order to establish a longhole stoping operation.  Harmony operated the 
mine for three years (See Table 3.1) and put the project on a care and maintenance status in August 2001. 

The longhole mining method was not applicable to this type of deposits.  When compared to the San Antonio shrinkage 
mining operation, the Harmony operation produced less ounces from more tons per day and failed to achieve the 
corporate objectives of the parent company Harmony Gold Mines Limited of South Africa. 

In January 2002 Harmony entered into an option agreement with Wildcat Exploration Ltd. ("Wildcat") of Winnipeg, 
Manitoba.  Wildcat's objective was to re-establish the mine as a 550 ton per day shrinkage stope operation delivering 
ore to a surface stock pile to feed the 1,000 ton per day mill with the mill operating on a 2 weeks on-2 weeks standby 
cycle. 

In April 2002 Howe (Titaro et al 2002) completed a report on the Harmony assets, which included an audit of the 
resources and reserves, a review of the operating and capital costs, and preparation of a financial evaluation of the 
economic feasibility of reopening the Rice Lake Mine.  Howe concluded that a viable shrinkage mining operation could 
be operated at a mining rate of 550 tons per day (200,000 tons per year), delivering ore to a surface stockpile to feed the 
1,250 ton per day mill  with the mill operating on a 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off cycle.  Gold was then at US$300 per ounce.  
Howe further concluded that based on well-founded historical estimation practices at the Bissett Mine, that as of April 
2001 the mine has measured and indicated resources of 1,267,175 tons grading 0.26 ounces gold per ton plus inferred 
resources of 734,700 tons grading 0.31 ounces of gold per ton.  All of the above mentioned resources are situated above 
the 4630 Level (5,370 feet below the collar of A-Shaft) of the mine in the D and C-Shaft areas. 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010  Page 15 

Within the measured and indicated resources, Howe concluded that the Bissett Mine currently has proven and probable 
mineable reserves of 901,800 tons with an average grade of 0.27 ounces gold per ton.  In determining this reserve base 
Howe used dilution, cutting and cut-off practices based on over 38 years of mining on the property.  All of these 
reserves have development drifts on the vein and all are accessible on levels within the C and D Shaft areas of the mine. 

Wildcat was unable to complete the acquisition of the Rice Lake Mine and in March 2004 the predecessor companies of 
the Company successfully acquired the assets from Harmony. 

Table 3.1 presents a summary by year of mining activity at the Bissett Mine. 

5.1.2 San Gold Minerals Property 

The following summary of the exploration history on the San Gold Minerals Property is taken from a report by Rhys 
and Brommeland (2001). 

In 1934 Normandy Mines Limited located the Normandy #1, #2, and #3 showings.  Normandy undertook a stripping 
and trenching program and subsequently conducted 3,000 feet of drilling on the showings and under the east end of 
Rice Lake during the winter of 1934-35 but no values of interest were noted (Stockwell, 1938).  In 1935 Normandy 
Mines Limited reorganized as Normandy Gold Mines Limited and held the property until 1944 when it was assigned to 
Sannorm Mines Limited and a 21-year lease was issued for the property. 

Sannorm Mines Limited conducted a magnetometer survey on the property in 1945 (Wright 1946).  Subsequently, 
20,000 feet of diamond drilling was completed in 37 holes over a 3,000-foot strike length.  A mineralized zone, which 
was termed the San Norm Prospect, was identified and traced along a strike length of 600 feet and to a vertical depth of 
1,100 feet.  Wright (1946) reports average intersection widths of 4.5 feet and gold grades of 0.288 ounces per ton in this 
area.  In 1947 surface facilities were built at the site and a shaft was collared to a depth of 25 feet.  However, by 1948 
work was suspended on the property as a supply of fuel could not be obtained for the power plant and conditions in the 
gold industry made it difficult to obtain financing.  Work resumed in 1949 when 11 diamond drill holes totalling 3,932 
feet were completed.  Citing similarities to the adjacent San Antonio mine (now the Bissett mine), Wright (1949) 
recommended that a series of long holes be drilled and a shaft to 1,000 feet with several levels be completed.  The 
recommendations were never carried out. 

Sannorm Mines Limited reorganized to form Consolidated Sannorm Mines Limited in 1952.  Sylvanite Gold Mines 
reviewed the property data but did not pursue further exploration or development.  Little exploration was conducted on 
the property in the 1960's with the exception of a geophysical survey that was conducted in 1961 (Nielson, 1983).  The 
type of survey and results are unknown.  In 1965 the lease on the property was renewed for another 21 years. 

The Sannorm lease was cancelled in 1971 and was restaked by C. Wynne and assigned to Wynne Gold Mines Ltd.  In 
1974 Wynne Gold Mines Ltd. drilled 5 holes totalling 3,923 feet (Busch 1986a) at the San Norm prospect, but no core 
was split for assay.  A further 7 holes (total 3,610 feet) were drilled in 1978 and 1979 in the area of the 1974 drilling.  
No significant values were intersected (Busch 1986b). 

Orenda Resources Limited acquired the property in 1985.  In 1985 and 1986 they completed a magnetometer survey, an 
induced polarization survey, compilation of previous work, and a 7 diamond drill holes totalling 1,803 feet.  A VLF 
electromagnetic survey and 10 diamond drill holes totalling 2,803 feet were completed in 1987.  The 1986 and 1987 
drilling by Orenda confirmed two gold bearing zones along a 4,300 foot strike length within the Normandy Creek shear 
zone at the San Norm prospect, termed the A and B Zones by Busch (1986a). 

Bakra Resources Ltd. acquired the property option in 1988 and drilled 8 diamond drill holes totalling 2,999 feet at the 
San Norm Prospect.  They followed up with a 1989 drill program of 12 holes totalling 4,292 feet. 

Several exploration programs were carried out during the 1990's by Bissett Exploration Partnership and San Gold 
Resources Corporation Inc.  These included 110 drill holes totalling 53,612 feet, line cutting, surface mapping, 
magnetometer surveys and stripping of a large area at the west end of the San Norm A and B zones for procurement of a 
bulk sample. 

In 2000 Mainland Exploration Partnership entered into a Letter Agreement with San Gold Resources Corporation Inc. 
and shortly thereafter exploration activities began on what they called their Red Lake West Gold Project. 

In February 2000 Mainland Exploration contracted High-Sense Geophysics Limited to complete approximately 1,180 
line-km of helicopter-borne magnetic and electromagnetic surveys.  These surveys were followed up by a program of 
overburden drilling and sampling in March 2000 by Overburden Drilling Management Limited.  Mainland and Panterra

Geoservices Inc. personnel completed geological studies, relogging of selected core, and a review of previous 
exploration.  No drilling was carried out. 

In 2003 San Gold Resources Corporation Inc. drilled 3 holes totalling 2,913 feet on the property. In 2004 the Rice Lake 
Joint Venture (San Gold Resources Corporation Inc. and Gold City Industries Ltd.) drilled 31 holes totalling 10,710 
feet.

6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
6.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

The Rice Lake Greenstone Belt is located at the west end of the Uchi Volcanic-Plutonic Subprovince of the Superior 
Province of the Canadian Shield (Figure 1).  The Uchi Subprovince is a typical Archean volcanic-sedimentary 
greenstone belt that has been intruded by synvolcanic, syntectonic, and post-tectonic rocks. 

The south boundary of the Uchi Subprovince is marked by a regionally continuous zone of faulting (Manigotagan-Lake 
St. Joseph Fault) that separates the volcanic-plutonic terrain of the Uchi Subprovince from the English River (Ontario)-
Manigotagan (Manitoba) gneissic belts.  The northern boundary of the Uchi Subprovince is less distinct, locally being 
marked by regional-scale fault structures and in other areas by gradually increasing metamorphic grade into the 
metamorphic-plutonic terrain of the Berens River (Ontario) and Wanipigow (Manitoba) sub-provinces.  Age dating 
indicates that some of the rocks in the metamorphic-plutonic terrain are older than the volcanic rocks and may represent 
an older Archean basement complex upon which the volcanic rocks were deposited.  Other intrusives are of synvolcanic 
ages or syntectonic, post volcanic ages. 

Table 2 presents a Table of Formations for the Rice Lake area, Manitoba. 

Regional studies in Ontario and Manitoba have provided age dating and regional stratigraphic assemblage analysis that 
provides the basis for a revised interpretation of the setting of gold deposits within the Uchi Subprovince. 

Table 3 presents a comparison of the Neoarchean and Mesoarchean stratigraphic assemblages of the Rice Lake and Red 
Lake areas.  The regional distribution of these major assemblages is shown on Figure 1.  The Red Lake area data is from 
Thurston et al. (1991) and the Rice Lake area data is from Corkery (2000). 

The Wanipigow River Plutonic Complex, which forms the northern boundary of the Rice Lake greenstone belt, is 
composed predominantly of hornblende and biotite-bearing quartz dioritic, granodioritic and locally quartz monzonitic 
intrusions and gneisses.  Several large masses of gabbro are also present in the region.  Historically this area has been 
considered to be basically devoid of significant areas of volcanic terrain, however, the Wallace Lake - Siderock Lake 
area (Theyer, 1985 and Sasseville, 1999) are definitely underlain by Garner Lake Assemblage volcanic rocks.  Howe's 
site visit (2000) to the adjacent Wildcat's Poundmaker property also indicates that the gold-bearing quartz vein is hosted 
within carbonate altered mafic volcanic rocks rather than quartz diorite and fine grained mafic dykes as suggested by 
previous data (Richardson and Ostry 1996 citing Weber 1971).  Age dating in the eastern extension of the Wanipigow 
Complex in Ontario (Thurston et al, 1991) indicates that some of the gneisses and intrusive rocks are older than the 
Garner Lake/Balmer Assemblage rocks and probably represent an older basement complex upon which the volcanics 
were deposited. 

The Manigotagan Gneissic Belt, which lies immediately south of the Rice Lake greenstone belt, represents a lithologic 
gradation from the low-grade metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks through paragneiss and migmatite to quartz 
dioritic and granodioritic gneiss. 

There are at least three and possibly four major periods of deformation in the Rice Lake area (Anderson, 2008).  The 
resulting fold pattern is complex with overturned, doubly plunging folds common in the Rice Lake Group rocks.  The 
late Archean San Antonio Formation sedimentary rocks may have only been affected by the last major period of 
deformation. 

There are a number of major regional fault structures in the Rice Lake area.  The major structures that trend in a 
generally east-west direction are the most prominent and movement along these structures has developed conjugate 
shear zones that splay off to the north and south.  In addition there has probably been thrust faulting in the early stages 
of the deformation of the area, however, these structures are difficult to identify. 

All of the major gold occurrences in the Rice Lake area occur as quartz veins or quartz vein systems related to structural 
deformation (folding and faulting) of the host rocks.  See Section 6.2 for a discussion of deposit types/models and 
Section 6.3 for descriptions of the geology and mineralization on the Rice lake Project. 

The Uchi Subprovince has significant gold production from the Rice Lake, Manitoba area in the west through the Red 
Lake, Birch-Uchi Lake, to Pickle Lake-Dona Lake areas of Ontario.  Gold production from the area is summarized in 
Table 6.3.

6.2 LOCAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

The Property is located within the Rice Lake greenstone belt at the west end of the Archean Uchi Subprovince.  The 
most recent geological report for the Rice Lake area is Anderson (2008).  The reader is referred to this report for details 
which are summarised below. 

In the vicinity of the Property (see Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4) bedrock is comprised of Bidou Lake Assemblage 
rocks that occur as a north facing stratigraphic sequence that, to the northeast of the Rice Lake Mine has a strike of 125o 
and dips 48o and then swings to an east-northeasterly strike direction and a steeper north-northwesterly dip as it trends 
east across the Property to the vicinity where the 007 zone, SG #1 Mine, and the SG #2 - #3 zones are located.  The 
Bidou Lake Assemblage is comprised of felsic to intermediate volcanic flows, and dacitic crystal tuffs and breccias, 
overlain by carbonate-sericite schist of probable pyroclastic and sedimentary origin.  The sequence is intruded by 
diabase (gabbro) sills and dykes, and porphyritic felsic dykes.  The Bidou Lake Assemblage is unconformably overlain 
by feldspathic sandstone of the San Antonio Assemblage. 

At the Rice Lake Mine and the Cartwright zone, the gold mineralization is confined to the San Antonio Mine Unit 
("SAM Unit") a layered, sill-like gabbroic unit that intrudes the Townsite Unit of the Bidou Lake Assemblage.  The 
SAM Unit has historically been interpreted to be a subvolcanic feeder related to overlying mafic volcanic rocks. 

On the east side of the Property the volcanic stratigraphy of the Townsite Unit, beneath the SAM Unit is comprised of a 
lower unit of mafic volcanic flows and tuffs, overlain by intermediate to felsic tuffs at the top of which occurs a unit of 
sericite schist and quartz-carbonate (ankeritic), overlain by a second unit of mafic volcanic flows and mafic sills, and on 
the northerly part of the property a sequence of felsic to intermediate volcanic tuffs. 

Gold mineralization in the San Gold #1 Mine and the San Gold #2 and #3 zones is confined to the sericite schist and 
quartz-carbonate unit, which has historically been called the "Normandy Shear Zone".  While the unit is definitely 
schistose, and has been the focus of bedding plane shearing, that is more intense than that in the more competent 
overlying and underlying lithologic units, the current site geologists are of the opinion that the "Normandy Shear Zone" 
is actually a felsic "exhalite" unit and could mark the original epithermal to exhalative gold event in the district. 

In 2008 the Company, based on recommendations by its exploration consultant Bill Ferreira, initiated an exploration 
program to explore for gold-bearing structures in the Townsite Unit of the Bidou Assemblage in the hanging wall of the 
SAM unit.  This exploration program resulted in discovery of the Hinge Mine in 2008 and the Cohiba, L13 and 007 
zones in 2009.  Further details relating to the geology in the immediate vicinity of gold mineralization is presented in 
Section 8. 

7.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
7.1 E XPLORATION TARGETS 

Exploration targets on the Property are quartz veins located in shear-type and tension-type fractures in lithologies that 
are more brittle than the surrounding lithologies.  The exploration model is described in Section 7.2. 

Because of the small quantities of gold per tonne that are required to make an economic gold deposit, and further 
because the gold in this type of mineralization is seldom uniformly distributed throughout the vein structure and is most 
commonly either in small clusters of fine grained gold or in relatively large pieces of coarse free gold, it is very difficult 
to achieve representative sampling of the vein structure by drilling.  See Section 16.2 for a thorough discussion of the 
sampling issues. 

7.2 DEPOSIT MODELS 

Roberts (1998) has provided an updated statement of the geological characteristics of Archean gold deposits (update of 
Roberts 1996). 

Roberts has concluded that a close examination of the geological characteristics of Archean world-class gold deposits 
reveals a significant diversity in the nature and chemistry of the ore, hydrothermal alteration, and lithological or 
structural associations.  Several geological styles of deposits can be distinguished: 

- Quartz-carbonate veins in shear zones, faults and folds, and related extensional structures; 

- Zones of stockwork veinlets and disseminated sulphides associated with small porphyry intrusions; 

- Sulphide-rich veins and vein arrays; 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010  Page 22 

- Gold-rich volcanogenic massive sulphide ("VMS") lenses in felsic volcanic rocks; and 

- Rare carbonate-rich veins and siliceous replacements. 

Geological relationships suggest that the porphyry-style, gold-rich VMS and possibly epithermal-style deposits have 
formed during the stages of construction (volcanic-plutonic activity) of the greenstone belts at depths of less than 5 
kilometres, whereas orogenic deposits have formed during deformation at depths in excess of 5 kilometres. 

These different styles of gold deposits commonly occur within the same districts or along the same fault zones, 
indicating that gold deposits within a given district formed at different crustal levels, at different times, and by different 
processes, and have been juxtaposed by successive episodes of burial, uplift, and deformation that have been focussed 
in certain areas. 

Roberts notes, using the Archean Abitibi Belt of Ontario and Quebec as an example that development begins with the 
accumulation of volcanic rocks in one or more cycles and the emplacement of coeval igneous intrusions.  This 
represents the main phase of construction of volcanic plutonic edifices, which is partly accompanied by, but mostly 
followed by, turbidite (greywacke, shale and siltstone) sedimentation.  This main phase of construction was followed by 
a first episode of deformation (D1) tilting, folding and overthrusting of supracrustal units, accompanied by diorite-
tonalite intrusions.  Subsequent uplift and erosion led to the deposition of alluvial-fluvial Temiskaming-type 
sedimentary rocks above an angular unconformity.  This Temiskaming-stage can be regarded as a renewed stage of 
volcano-plutonic construction as it was accompanied by the emplacement of high level intrusives and volcanic rocks of 
alkalic composition.  The Temiskaming stage was followed by the main period of deformation of the volcanic-plutonic 
edifices, beginning with regional D2 shortening across the belt and evolving into D3 transcurrent deformation. 

Quartz-carbonate vein deposits consist of networks of quartz-carbonate veins in moderately to steeply dipping brittle-
ductile shear zones and related extensional veins and vein arrays and breccia veins in relatively competent lithologic 
units.  The deposits are spatially associated with major shear zones but have a tendency to be hosted by second and 
third-order structures and splays.  In the larger deposits, the vein networks have a surface footprint exceeding 1 
kilometre of strike length and generally extend vertically to depths of 1 kilometre or more (the Rice Lake Mine 
workings are currently active at 5,500 feet below surface (approximately 7000 feet down the dip of SAM Unit). 

Robert (op cit) further noted that there is a strong association of world-class deposits with districts that contain a large 
proportion of mafic and ultramafic volcanic rocks. 

An important implication of Robert's findings is that successful gold exploration in these belts must be based on 
multiple models and multiple sets of exploration criteria. 

In the Timmins gold camp, all of the above-mentioned styles of mineralization can be found, and multiple styles can be 
found within a single mine, for example the Dome and Hollinger-McIntyre mines. 

In quartz-carbonate vein deposits gold mineralization occurs in both the veins and in adjacent altered wall rocks, with 
the bulk of the gold found in the veins.  The mineralized veins consist of quartz and carbonate minerals, with 
subordinate amounts of pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, native gold, base metal sulphides, tourmaline, scheelite, talc, 
sericite and chlorite.  Alteration envelopes, a few metres to tens of metres thick surround the veins, and may consist of 
reduced carbon, carbonatization, potassium metasomatism, sodium metasomatism, sulphidization and silicification 
(Card et al, 1988). 

Carbonatization is the most common and most extensive type of alteration.  This type of alteration involves the 
progressive replacement of Ca, Fe and Mg silicate minerals by carbonate species through the addition of carbon dioxide 
and is inwardly zoned from calcite to ankerite and dolomite.  Potassium metasomatism is found in close proximity to 
the veins as sericitization of chlorite and plagioclase, the development of K-feldspar and biotite and the presence of 
fuchsite in ultramafic rocks.  Sulphidation is restricted to the immediate wall rocks of the veins.  Pyrite is the dominant 
sulphide with lesser amounts of pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite, but the volume of total sulphide minerals is generally less 
than 10%.  Sodium metasomatism results in the formation of albite and paragonite.  Silicification results in quartz-
flooding of the host rocks and an abundance of quartz veinlets and stockworks.   

At the district and property scale, exploration for quartz-carbonate lode gold deposits focuses on broad transpressional 
shear zones located along lithologic boundaries.  The gold mineralization tends to occur within structures measuring 
hundreds to thousands of metres long that are subsidiary to major fault zones.  At a more local scale mapping of 
alteration mineral assemblages can delineate favourable portions of shear zones.  Even though the sulphide content of 
the quartz veins and the associated wall rock alteration is low, induced polarization and resisitivity geophysical methods

result in a recognizable chargeability response, while the increased quartz content is recognized as an increase in 
resistivity.  Carbonitization causes destruction of magnetic minerals in mafic rocks, creating a negative magnetic feature 
coincident with alteration surrounding the lode deposits.  In glaciated areas, geochemical surveys using heavy mineral 
concentrates derived from sampling till can be used to define areas of potential lode gold mineralization.  In addition, 
Mobile Metal Ion-type soil geochemical surveys have proven to be applicable in overburden covered areas. 

8.0 MINERALI ZATION ON PROPERTY 
8.1 INTRODUCTION 

The gold mineralization on the property is of three distinct, but probably genetically related, types. 

8.1.1 Rice Lake Mine and Cartwright Zone 

Historic production (San Antonio Mines and Harmony Gold) has been confined to the SAM unit, a layered, sill-like 
gabbroic unit that intrudes the Bidou Lake Assemblage.  In the RLM area the north facing Bidou sequence strikes 125o and 
dips 48o to the northeast and is comprised of lower felsic to intermediate volcanic flows, overlain by dacitic crystal tuffs and 
breccias, and an upper sequence of carbonate-sericite schist of probable pyroclastic and sedimentary origin.  The sequence is 
intruded by diabase (gabbro) sills and dykes, and porphyritic felsic dykes.  The Bidou Lake Subgroup is unconformably 
overlain by feldspathic sandstone of the San Antonio Formation. 

Prior to and during deposition of the gold mineralization, the SAM unit was subjected to regional sinistral (left-hand) strike-
slip deformation with the hosting Bidou Lake rocks shearing along foliation plans sub parallel to their contact with the SAM 
Unit.  These regional stresses caused secondary shear and tensional fractures to occur in the more competent SAM unit.  The 
intensity of shear and tension fractures appears to increase where the SAM unit thickens which is probably related to the 
thick portions acting as a stress resistant "buttress" that would focus the regional stress more strongly on the east and west 
sides of the thick areas.  Veins generally terminate within the SAM gabbro near the contact with the host Bidou Lake rocks.  
Rarely, the veins may extend up to 10 feet into the Bidou Lake.  The SAM unit is inhomogenously deformed and varies 
from massive and weakly strained to well foliated and/or lineated.  The SAM unit is distinctly more competent than the 
surrounding felsic volcanic rocks of the Bidou Lake Subgroup. 

Historically the SAM unit has been considered to be a gabbroic sill that was a subvolcanic feeder for overlying mafic 
volcanic rocks.  The recent drilling of the Cartwright mineralized zone within the SAM unit, immediately west of the Rice 
Lake Mine, has provided indications that the SAM unit may be a thick mafic volcanic flow rather than a sill.  Site geologists 
have noted a distinct contact metamorphic effect in underlying Bidou felsic pyroclastic rocks at the base of the SAM unit but 
no similar contact metamorphic effect at the top of the SAM unit in contact with similar Bidou stratigraphy. 

The bulk of the gold-bearing quartz veins occur as either 16-Type shear zone veins or 38-Type tensional fracture stockwork 
veins or as a complex combination of the two vein types where they intersect.  The two vein types are named after two of the 
better veins discovered in the early years of production at the Rice Lake Mine (then know as the San Antonio Mine). 

In the upper part of the Rice Lake Mine the 16-Type veins strike in an east-northeast direction (azimuth 60 to 70 degrees) 
and dip 60 degrees to the northwest with local flattening of the dip to 30 degrees.  In the deeper, D-Shaft area, parts of the 
mine the 16-Type veins swing clockwise to a more easterly (azimuth 080) direction.  The veins follow chloritic shear zones 
with a main, banded quartz vein along the central part and numerous parallel stringers in the schist on either side.  Movement 
on the shear zone is sinistral (left-hand) strike-slip similar to the regional shear zones.  The termination of the veins along the 
hanging wall and footwall of the SAM unit intersect along a line that plunges to the northeast at 50 degrees.  This accounts 
for the raking nature of the ore zones and stopes when viewed on a vertical longitudinal section (see Appendix 2).  
Individual 16-Type veins, have a strike length of 100 to 500 feet, and extend for up to 3200 feet down the dip of the SAM 
unit.  Strike length to down dip length ratios are in the 1:4 to 1:8 range. 

In the upper parts of the Rice Lake Mine the 38-Type veins strike in a southeast direction (azimuth 130 to 140) and dip 
vertically to steep (75 degrees) to the northeast.  In the deeper, D-Shaft area the veins swing clockwise to a more northerly  
strike direction.  The veins occur in tensional fractures that are characterized by brecciation and stockwork veining.  There is 
no lateral displacement along the walls of the veins. The termination of the veins along the hanging wall and footwall of the 
SAM unit intersect along a subhorizontal line that parallels the strike of the SAM Unit.  The 38-Type veins have strike 
lengths of 500 to 2,000 feet and extend vertically for 150 to 600 feet depending upon variations in the thickness of the SAM 
unit. 

It is often difficult to differentiate the two vein types in drill core as contact attitudes are complex and often cannot be 
measured accurately.  In vertical long section interpretation (section east-west parallel to mine grid, looking north) it is 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010  Page 24 

possible to infer the vein-system type based on the manner in which the northing of the pierce points behave in a lateral and 
vertical directions.  For example, in the mine grid east-west vertical long section: 

1) The apparent dip of the Bidou stratigraphy and SAM unit will be approximately 30 degrees east. 
2) The apparent dip of the 16-Type Veins will be approximately 35 degrees (or less) west. 
3) The apparent dip of the 38-Type Veins will be vertical to 80 degrees east. 
4) The apparent plunge of the thick portion of the SAM unit will have an apparent plunge of 35 to 40 degrees 

east. 
5) From east to west across the section at a constant depth below surface, related 38-Type Vein pierce points will 

move progressively to the north at 70 to 80 feet/100 feet of westerly increase.  In the vertical direction, related 
38-Type Vein pierce points will be at similar northings or there may be a small progressive increase in 
northing with depth to the east. 

6) From east to west across the section at a constant depth below surface, related 16-Type Vein pierce points will 
move progressively to the south at 55 to 60 feet/100 feet of westerly increase.  In the vertical direction, related 
16-Type Vein pierce points will move progressively to the north at 55 to 60 feet/100 feet of depth increase. 

8.1.2 San Gold #1 Mine and San Gold #2 and #3 Zones 

The mineralization along this continuous zone is along the Normandy Shear confined to the central part of the sericite schist, 
quartz-carbonate unit near the base of the Townsite Unit has been described in Section 6.2 above.  While locally the quartz 
within the schist unit may show cross-cutting relationships, the mineralized zone appears to be basically stratabound and 
tabular in nature.  There is a readily identifiable zone of buff alteration surrounding the mineralized zone.  The zone is 
apparent in drill core and can be followed along the full length of the workings of the San Gold #1 Mine (See Figure 2). 

This is in distinct contrast to the gold mineralization in the Bissett Mine, which occurs in cross-cutting quartz-veins systems 
hosted almost exclusively within the SAM unit. 

8.1.3 Hinge Mine, 007 Zone, Cohiba Zone, L13 Zone, L10 Zone, and Emperor Zone 

Historic exploration in the Bissett area focused on vein structures in the SAM unit and gold mineralization discovered 
along the Normandy Shear Zone to the east of the Rice Lake Mine.  There were a few gold showings discovered in the 
Bidou Lake Assemblage north of the SAM unit, however, exploration shafts were unsuccessful in establishing 
significant resources and it was concluded that the Bidou Lake sequence was not structurally conducive to the 
development of large, gold-bearing zones. 

In 2008, Bill Ferreira, an exploration consulting geologist to the Company, recognized that the historic exploration 
shafts to the east of the Rice Lake mine formed a pattern suggestive of north-northeast trending cross structures spaced 
approximately 1500 feet apart and further, that a similar pattern was apparent in the upper and lower parts of the Rice 
Lake Mine in terms of the location of the vein structures in the upper levels compared to those below the 26 Level.  Mr. 
Ferierra termed these cross structures "hinges" and recommended a program of surface drilling in the vicinity of the 
exploration shafts on the Winn Gold and Gold Standard showings which were located on the first "hinge" immediately 
to the east of the Rice Lake Mine.  Early in the drill program, what is now known as the Hinge Mine, was intersected 
and successful follow-up drilling resulted in development starting in early 2009. 

Vein structures and mineralogy in the Hinge Mine are very similar to the 16-type and 38-type veins in the Rice Lake 
Mine.  In the Author's opinion the strike length and depth continuity potential of the vein structures at the Hinge should 
be similar to those at the Rice Lake Mine (See Section 8.1.1,para 5). 

Following discovery of the Hinge Mine, the company continued surface exploration drilling which resulted in the 
discovery in 2009-10 of five additional zones (L10, Cohiba, L13, 007, and Emperor) in a similar geological setting 
within the Bidou Lake Assemblage. 

The gold mineralization in the new discoveries is very similar to historic gold-bearing quartz vein structures in the Rice 
Lake Mine.  Based on interpretation of an airborne digital imagery survey completed by the Company in the spring of 
2009, the Author is of the opinion that the controlling shears structures for the Hinge, L10, Cohiba, L13, 007 and 
Emperor vein systems are the same shear structures that control the vein systems in the RLM (See Section 9.2.2).

9.0 EXPLORATION 
9.1 HISTORICAL EXPLORATION ON THE PROJECT 

The history of exploration on the Property has been described in Section 5.0. 

9.2 2008-2010 EXPLORATION ON THE PROJECT 

An airborne LIDAR Survey is the only exploration done by the Company other than exploration drilling, the results of 
which are discussed in Sections 10 and 16,  

9.2.1 Airborne LIDAR Survey 

The following is taken directly from the George (2010).  It is reproduced herein as it assists in understanding the 
regional structures in the Rice Lake area. 

LIDAR integrates four technologies into a system capable of acquiring data to produce accurate digital elevation models 
("DEM").  Inertial navigation systems and global positioning systems provide accurate 3-dimensional positioning of the 
airborne (helicopter or fixed wing) laser scanner system, plus a sophisticated on-board computer system provides sensor 
control, timing, and data logging.  The aircraft also carries digital still and video cameras. 

The echo return signal of each laser pulse is digitized along with detailed navigational data for post-flight analysis.  The 
return signal from each laser pulse is comprised of multiple returns reflected from high vegetation cover (trees), 
buildings, low vegetation cover, and bedrock. 

The survey was flown by LIDAR Services International Inc. of Calgary, Alberta using a helicopter-borne system.  
Approximately 675 square kilometres were covered.  Figure 5 displays the total area of the survey that covers the Rice 
Lake area. .  Maximum elevation (red) is approximately 306 metres above sea level in the north-central edge of the map 
area and the minimum elevation (dark blue) is approximately 245 metres on the west central edge of the area 
immediately south of Highway 304. Total relief in the area flown is 61 metres. 

In the central part of the area (Figures 6 to 8) total relief is 40 metres. 

The final product provided includes: 

 The LIDAR raw data, compiled into a series of small, 1 kilometre by 1 kilometre tiles for manageable file 
sizes; 

 LIDAR derived bare earth digital terrain model with all vegetation and man-made structures removed; 
 LIDAR derived full surface digital elevation model with all vegetation and man-made objects included; 
 A hill-shaded topographic model: 
 Orthorectified digital imagery; and 
 A final survey report. 

On flat to rolling, vegetated surfaces absolute vertical accuracy is in the +/-0.25 metre range and absolute horizontal 
accuracy is in the +/- 0.75 metre range. 

The data presented in Figure 5 is a combination of the bare earth digital terrain model and a hill shaded topographic 
model which accentuates subtle changes in elevation. 

9.2.2 Preliminary Geoex Interpretation of LIDAR Data (Figures 6 to 8) 

There is a wide-range of structural information (bedding planes, shearing, lineations, joints, geological contacts, etc) 
that can be extracted from the LIDAR bare earth digital terrain model.  Note that when viewed in Adobe Acrobat PDF 
format the quality of the data is apparent even though it is significantly degraded from the original product. 

Figure 6 presents the results of the preliminary evaluation which is focused on the major faults and related shears that 
are apparent in the LIDAR data.  On the north side of the drawing, the Wanipigow fault is obvious with a wide zone of 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010  Page 26 

intense shearing.  The Wanipigow Fault marks the boundary between the Uchi volcanic-plutonic terrain and the 
Wanipigow(Manitoba)-Berens River(Ontario) metamorphic plutonic terrain.  The Wanipigow Fault extends to the east 
through the Red Lake Area of Ontario, 

The Normandy fault and the other shear zones all appear to be splays off of the Wanipigow, which, from east to west, 
splay off from the south side of the Wanipigow Fault, initially trending to the southwest and then gradually swinging to 
a west to west northwest strike direction.  Beyond the west boundary of the map area some of the shears veer back up 
and rejoin the south side of the Wanipigow Fault. 

In the Rice Lake Mine, where the shears cross the SAM Unit there is small sinistral (left-hand) offsetting of the upper 
contact of the SAM. 

Anderson (2008) concluded that lateral movement along the Wanipigow varied from sinistral to dextral (right hand) 
over a long period of geological time with significant vertical movement with the north side up. 

The timing of shear movement that relates to the gold mineralization was post metamorphic, during retrograde 
metamorphism as the igneous cooling, coupled with erosion and uplift caused crustal temperatures to decrease.  During 
peak metamorphism all of the lithologies would be too ductile for brittle fracture to occur.  As the rocks cool, 
differences in ductility start to occur as different lithologies become brittle at different pressure-temperature thresholds.  
The cooling process increases the potential for the development of shear and tension fractures suitable to host gold 
mineralization. 

From the Author's experience in the area it was also apparent that these LIDAR shears have the same orientations as 
shears that cross the SAM unit and are structurally related to the shear-type and tensional-type gold bearing quartz veins 
in the RLM.  The Author, based on maps contained in a report by Rhys (2001), constructed 3-dimensional models of the 
major shear-type vein systems in the RLM and projected them up plunge to surface and found that their surface 
locations plotted very close to where the LIDAR conjugate shears cross the surface trace of the SAM unit which hosts 
the RLM gold mineralization (See Figure 7).  Further, there is a close spatial association of the new discoveries in the 
volcanic rocks that overlie the SAM Unit (Hinge, 007, L13, and Cohiba) and the Lidar shear systems (Figure 7). 

Based upon this 3-dimensional correlation the Author concludes that the LIDAR shears correlate with the RLM shears 
and hence the Hinge-type mineralization in the volcanic rocks in the hanging wall of the SAM unit are hosted in the 
same structures and thus are part of the same mineralizing event as the RLM gold mineralization. 

This interpretation has significant implications regarding the depth potential of the newly discovered mineralization at 
the Hinge and 007 as these structures within the RLM contain gold mineralization from surface to over 5000 feet below 
surface (7000 feet down the dip of the veins).  The RLM mineralization is open at depth below 5000 feet. 

Figure 8 presents an overlay of the LIDAR interpretation on a figure from Anderson (2008) which provides the regional 
trends of lineations that occur within the shears.  Based upon the LIDAR interpretation there is a reasonably accurate 
indication of the variations in the strike of the shears.  As the lineations lie in the plane of the shear, if an estimate of the 
direction and angle of plunge of the lineation can be made then variations in the dip of individual shears can be 
determined.  This can then be applied in 3D Autocad and a reasonably accurate 3D model of the shear systems and the 
known gold resources can be created.  It is beyond the scope of this Report to complete such a study, however, the 
Author is of the opinion that such a study is warranted.  It will provide new insights for the geological staff who are 
dealing with the structural complexities of the Rice Lake Project on a daily basis and further it will be a valuable tool in 
illustrating the nature of the structures to third parties who have an interest in the Property. 

10.0 DRILLI NG 
10.1 HISTORICAL DRILLING ON THE PROJECT 

See George (2006) for drilling up to the end of 2006. 

10.2 CURRENT DRILLING ON THE HINGE PROJECT BY THE COMPANY 

There has been ongoing drilling on the Hinge project since 2008.  The results of the drilling program are described in 
the resource estimates in Section 16.  All exploration department core is BQ diameter.  Some of the production 
department core is NQ.  The Rice Lake Project (excluding the Rice Lake Mine) database is comprised of 663 holes 
completed to June 30, 2010 totalling 693,810 feet.  The database is comprised of a total of 14,215 individual assays 
received to date and a significant backlog of samples shipped but not assayed..

11.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
11.1 SAMPLING METHODS 

Surface and underground drilling is all done by contractors.  Diamond drill core is placed in labelled wooden trays and 
localized by depth blocks inserted by the drill contractor's personnel prior to removal of the core from the drill site by 
the drill geologist.  Upon arrival at the secure core logging facility the core boxes are sequentially placed in a core rack.  
Spatial information related to each box of core is checked for accuracy and consistency at this point.  Remedial actions 
are undertaken, if necessary, to correct deficiencies in the spatial information prior to entry into a database. 

A team of exploration and mine geologists complete logging of the core and the observations are entered into a drill log 
database prior to selecting samples for analyses.  Selected portions of the core are marked and measured for sampling 
and are identified with one part of a three part assay tag, placed at the end of the sample interval.  Samples are produced 
by sawing the core perpendicular to the foliation, with one half of the core returned to the core box and the other half 
placed in a clean plastic bag along with part two of the three part assay tag.  Information on the third part of the assay 
tag is entered into the database and the drill log, at which time accuracy and consistency are again reviewed and 
remedied, if necessary. 

In general all sections with quartz veining and/or alteration are sampled.  Sample lengths in mineralized portions of the 
core characterized by silicification, carbonate alteration, sulphide minerals, quartz veins and visible gold are variable 
and are based upon geological considerations.  

Blanks and standards are routinely inserted by the Company into the sample stream being delivered to the assay 
laboratory. 

Sealed sample bags are transported to the analytical laboratory in a timely fashion. On arrival at the assay laboratory 
samples are received by the analytical laboratory personnel, and transferred to the laboratories chain of custody 
procedures and protocols. 

11.2 SAMPLING OR RECOVERY FACTORS 

Core recovery is generally good in the Project area and the Author is confident that there are no sampling or recovery 
factors that would negatively impact the sampling procedures. 

11.3 SAMPLE QUALITY, REPRESENTATIVENESS, AND SAMPLE BIAS 

The sampling methods are to industry standards for mineralization of this type, recognizing that there are serious issues 
relating in general to sampling of gold deposits because of the non-uniform distribution of gold within the veins systems 
and the low concentrations of gold that are required to make an economic deposit (See discussion in Section 16.2). 

The author is of the opinion that the sampling methods meet NI 43-101 standards. 

12.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
The primary independent assay laboratory used by the Company is TSL Laboratories Inc. of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan 
("TSL").  When pulps and rejects are returned by TSL, selected samples are sent by the Company to Accurassy 
Laboratories, Thunder Bay, Ontario to provide a cross check of the TSL assay results.  TSL and Accurassay are both 
ISO/IEC 17025 certified laboratories and both have long histories in the Canadian mining industry.  Both laboratories 
use very similar sample preparation, analytical methods, and Quality Assurance/Quality Control ("QAQC") regimes. 

When samples are received by TSL they are sorted and verified according to the sample submittal form that is shipped 
with the samples by the Company.  The shipment is assigned a TSL reference number and a TSL worksheet.  Sample 
labels are produced with the client sample number and the TSL reference number. 

Sample preparation procedures involve oscillating jaw crushing to 75%  -10 mesh.  A 1000 gram sub sample is riffled 
from the -10 mesh sample and pulverized to >95% -150 mesh in a ring mill pulverizer.  Crushers, rifflers and pans are 
cleaned with compressed air between each sample.  Pulverizing pots and rings are brushed, hand cleaned and air blown. 

Samples without visible native gold are subjected to normal fire assay analytical procedures.  The gold concentration is 
determined in a homogenized 30 gm sample using a fire assay collector and atomic absorption finish.  Samples are 
assayed in batches of 24, comprised of 20 client samples, two duplicate client samples, one TSL standard and one TSL 
blank. 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010  Page 28 

Each sample with visible gold is subjected to the total metallic and fire assay procedures.  The whole sample is crushed 
and pulverized to 95% passing 150 mesh.  The +150 mesh fraction (including the sieve cloth) is assayed for the coarse 
gold content and two 30 gram samples of the -150 mesh are assayed.  The weighted average of the three assays 
determines the reported assay grade for the sample. 

The Author is of the opinion that all potential gold mineralized zones in drill core have been sampled.  Security of the 
samples both at the core logging facility and the analytical laboratory appear to be adequate to ensure the integrity of the 
samples.  The use of the metallic sieve method of assaying samples containing coarse visible gold provides a more 
accurate measure of the gold concentration in the core samples. 

13.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
13.1 INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF DATABASE AND PROCEDURES 

In April 2009, Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. ("SWRP") was retained by the Company to review and 
comment upon their procedures.  Mr. Barry McDonough, P.Geo. of SWRP visited the site from April 27 to May 1.  The 
following summary of inspection tasks carried out, conclusions and recommendations are taken directly from the SWRP 
report to the Company (McDonough, 2009). 

Inspection tasks carried out included the following: 

 Review of ongoing exploration and production diamond drilling programs, inspection of four drills, as well as 
the core logging, sampling and storage facilities. 

 Review of core logging procedures and inspection of core logs. 
 Review of collar and downhole surveying procedures. 
 Review of sampling and assaying QAQC protocols, preliminary statistical review and inspection of the RLM 

assay laboratory. 
 Inspection of underground workings, mapping and grade control. 
 Collection of independent samples. 
 Review of milling procedures used on bulk sample of Hinge ore. 
 Review of resource estimation and production assay database. 
 Verification of exploration and production of assay database. 

Conclusions made were as follows: 

 Core logging and sampling have been carried out in a reasonable fashion in a manner appropriate for the 
deposit style and mineralization. 

 Sample handling protocols are acceptable and reasonably secure. 
 Drill collar and downhole surveys were properly carried out. 
 Assay reproducibility of exploration core is reasonable for the deposit type. 
 Assay reproducibility of production core is lower than exploration core but reasonable for the deposit type. 
 External QAQC data for exploration production is adequate.  San gold encountered issues with some QAQC 

data appropriate actions have been taken to ameliorate these concerns. 
 The amount of external QAQC data for production drilling is low and should be increased to enhance the 

accuracy of estimation of Mineral Resources. 
 Underground mapping, sampling, and grade control protocols are reasonable and appropriate for use and 

would lend themselves to adequate reconciliation. 
 SWRP validated the assay database and found it was reasonably sound and adequate for use in estimation of 

Mineral Resources. 
 Mineral Resource estimation, while incomplete, is being done in a manner that is commonly used in the 

industry by practicioners knowledgeable about the details of structure, emplacement, alteration, and 
mineralization pertaining to the RLM and surrounding deposits. 

Recommendations made were as follows: 

 A common set of logging codes should be adopted for both exploration and production that will allow the 
seamless transfer of information between the two departments. 

 Continued vigilance in scrutinizing drillhole orientation results due to known occurrences of magnetite on the 
property. 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010  Page 29 

 The use of fibre bands with single use metal closures to secure core box lids.  This protocol should be adopted 
for all exploration and drill programs. 

 The use of tamper proof security tabs should be implemented on shipment bags sent to TSL. 
 A photographic record of the exploration core should be maintained in addition to the half core samples stored 

on site. 
 The inclusion of geotechnical data in the drill logs for both exploration and production drilling. 
 Assay tags should be stapled to the sample box at the beginning of each interval. 
 The QAQC information should be processed immediately upon receipt so any issues can be identified and 

addressed in a timely manner. 
 QAQC protocols should be established for production core that are similar to those conducted on the 

exploration core. 
 The exploration database should be augmented with the original assay results from those samples run for 

whole metallics and that this practise carry forward so that statistical analyses can be performed to assess the 
effects for the coarse gold mineralization at the Hinge zone. 

 Whole metallics assay procedures should be used where gold is visible in production diamond drilling. 
 Specific gravity testing should continue on exploration core with the goal of compiling a statistically 

significant amount of data for the entire suite of lithologies found at the Hinge zone and RLM (approximately 
30 samples each).  Consideration should be given to conducting the testing on site. 

 A review of capping should be undertaken on the Hinge zone utilizing the information derived from chip 
samples, drilling and mill production data.  Scott Wilson RPA could provide assistance in this initiative. 

13.2 GEOEX REVIEW OF DATABASE AND PROCEDURES 

Since receipt of the SWRP report, the Author has seen all of the recommendations made by SWRP integrated into the 
Company's operating protocols.  Exploration and production geologists are now using the same software for core 
logging and the same lithocodes.  There is still a backlog of historic drilling to be converted to the new lithocodes, 
however, that is an ongoing process and will be completed this year. 

The Author has worked intensively with the Company's database on numerous occasions since 2002 and has never 
found any serious deficiencies or errors. 

The Author has not undertaken any check sampling and assaying.  In the Author's opinion, the bulk sample from the 
Hinge that was run through the Company's mill reconciled well with Company reserve estimates and belt assays at the 
mill (See Section 16.4).   

Reconciliation of Company reserve estimates based on assay data, underground face samples, and mill belt samples 
indicate and the pouring of gold bars that contain the ounces of gold that were anticipated, is confirmation that the 
sampling and assaying protocols are providing good quality data. 

The Company monitors the QAQC (standards and blanks sent to assay laboratories and the duplicates and replicates 
done by the laboratories) information for the assaying process on a regular basis.  The Author has reviewed this 
information. 

The Author is of the opinion that the Company's assay data base is of sufficient quality to provide the basis for the 
conclusions and recommendations reached in this Report.

16.0 GEOEX MINERAL RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES 
16.1 INTRODUCTION 

The primary objective of this report is to provide a resource estimate that encompasses all significant mineralization of 
the Rice Lake Project mining lease. 

16.2 BACKGROUND CO NSIDERATIONS RE ESTIMATION OF R ESOURCES AN D GEOLOGICAL 
POTENTIAL 

Geological and management personnel of the Archean gold mines of the gold districts of Canada (Timmins, Kirkland 
Lake, Red Lake, Bissett, Yellowknife, etc.) have intuitively understood for over a century the serious sampling issues 
related to the assessment of the gold content of gold bearing structures using diamond drilling.  The standard operating 
procedure for decades by experienced gold developers was "drill for structure" and "drift for grade".  This was basically 
the standard operating procedure for the majority of the Archean gold mines that have been historically opened in 
Canada.  Most were discovered on the basis of significant surface showings and were initially explored by shallow 
shafts and drifting on the vein.   However, as districts became well established in the post World War 2 era, drilling of 
small surface showings along trends within and along strike from established districts became a favoured exploration 
methodology. 

Exploring for new Archean gold mines in overburden or water-covered areas must rely completely on drilling to define 
new zones of subcropping gold mineralization.  Similarly, in-mine exploration at depth and along strike commonly must 
rely on drilling of wide-spaced holes to provided indications of lateral or vertical extensions of known ore bodies. 

Rogers (1982) clearly substantiated the sampling problem in his analysis of drilling as an aid in ore definition at the 
Dome Mine in Timmins.  Drawing on more than 72 years of mining history at the Dome and an analysis of 20,000 drill 
holes totalling over 1,215,000 metres (756 miles), Rogers states that: 

"Diamond drilling plays an important role in the evaluation of the stratigraphic and structural features which 
control ore deposition.  The main function of diamond drilling is to locate favourable areas of mineralization.  
Needless to say, a great many significant intersections, carrying a wide range of gold values, have resulted, 
however, the term "significant" takes on new meaning in light of the experience of diamond drilling in a 
number of ore-type situations at the Dome Mine.  Drilling through individual ore veins such as the Fuchsite 
Vein, or the Quartz-Tourmaline Vein, often intersect the vein structure; however, assays from the veins 
frequently fail to yield any ore grades.  Similarly, drill cores through stringer-type occurrences, when assayed, 
fail to indicate the true size or grade of the ore body finally mined." 

Rogers further noted that "those who explore for gold and those who have the slightly less fickle task of 
actually mining gold have shared a common dilemma.  That dilemma lies in the failure to relate the results of 
diamond drilling to a positive ore situation, or ultimately to reconcile the "diamond drill indicated ore" to 
actual ore reserve tonnages." 

Rogers concluded that, "the role of diamond drilling is paramount to success or failure in the "making of a 
mine".  Once a discovery is made, some appreciation of the size of the deposit must be understood before the 
economic viability of further development can be ascertained.  To that end diamond drilling is asked to play its 
conventional role.  However, at the Dome Mine, in the exploration and development of gold-bearing deposits, 
diamond drilling results are often misleading when consideration is given only to the economic value of the 
drill core assays themselves." 

From his review of the Dome drilling Rogers further noted that 40 to 60% of holes completed through multi-vein gold 
structures and 50 to 80% of holes completed through single vein structures areas failed to return any gold values in 
excess of 1.7 grams per tonne in areas that were ultimately mined.  The majority of this drilling were short, close-spaced 
holes, drilled from levels and sublevels to evaluate ore blocks that were planned to be stoped. 

At the time of Rogers (1982) analysis, the Dome Mine had produced 42.7 million tons of ore and 11.1 million ounces of 
gold (Atkinson 1985), which is equivalent to 38.3 million tonnes of in-situ resource grading 10.3 grams gold per tonne 
(based on 10% mining dilution, 90% mine recovery, and 95% mill recovery). 

Also, if one reviews the annual production and reserve information for the Dome Mine over its long history, rarely did 
the proven reserve base ever exceed 3 years of future production until the 1990's when the bulk mining open pit was 
developed over the upper parts of the underground workings.

Clearly, based on the above analysis, in the evaluation of the geological potential of a development-stage gold 
properties such as the Hinge and 007 emphasis must be placed upon the tonnage potential of the vein structures, and a 
review of the overall hit and miss ratio of the gold intersections obtained during the exploration stage drill program. 

None of the great gold mines of the Timmins camp would ever have achieved production if a requirement of financing 
of the initial development had been to demonstrate 7 to 8 years of proven plus probable mineral reserves as defined in 
NI 43-101. 

In the past 8 years, as a result of corporate needs, there have been NI 43-101 reports prepared (a) for the Dome, Hoyle 
Pond, and Pamour mines in the Timmins camp, Ontario (Rocque et al 2006, Couture 2003), (b) for the Campbell and 
Red Lake Mines in the Red Lake camp, Ontario (Crick et al, 2006), and (c) the Musselwhite Mine in the Pickle Crow 
area, Ontario (Mah 2006).  The aforementioned reports, all of which were, at the time of publication available on 
SEDAR, provide significant information relating to grade estimation issues in typical Archean vein-type gold deposits 
in Ontario.  The information is very relevant to the issues relating to sampling this type of gold deposits by drilling. 

All of the aforementioned operations have sampling issues relating to reconciliation of grades indicated by all manner of 
sampling (drill core, chip samples, muck samples from ore cars and trucks, and belt samples from various points in the 
mill).  Most of these operations treat each vein-type or stoping area as individual projects and use sophisticated 
geostatistical software to determine assay indicated grades, capping grades, etc in order to reconcile resource and 
reserve estimates with mill production.  Goldcorp has settled upon the mean plus 3 standard deviations of all assays that 
make up the composites for a given veins zone as the capping factor for estimation of mineral reserves. 

Over the past several decades, geostatisticians (Pitard, 1993a,b, 1998, 2002, Ingamells and Pitard, 1986) have published 
extensively on gold sampling theory and all recognize that the primary and most problematic issue is "Nugget Effect". 

Typically, in Archean vein-type gold deposits, gold is very rarely uniformly distributed throughout the vein structure 
but rather, occurs as clusters of small particles or single masses of spectacular "nuggety" gold.  This random, 
unpredictable distribution of gold influences all sampling of gold mineralization, whether it be (1) exploration drill core, 
(2) close-spaced underground stope planning drill core, (3) channel sampling of drift faces, development raises and 
sublevels, (4) sampling of mined ore by underground car or truck sampling or belt sampling after primary crushing in 
the mill. 

These same statisticians also point out that once the sample is acquired and sent to an assay laboratory it is crushed and 
then subdivided into a smaller sub-sample for fine grinding from which is ultimately take a smaller sample that is 
submitted to the assay laboratory (commonly 30 grams of material, know as one-assay-tonne).   The whole process, 
which has been industry standard for decades, has a high risk that the final one-assay-tonne sample will not be 
representative of the material originally sampled. 

When one considers (a) the small number of grams of gold that are required to produce economic grades in a tonne of 
ore, then considers (b) the small volume of that small amount of gold, compared to the volume of one tonne of ore and 
(c) further considers the volume of core in a single diamond drill hole passing through that tonne of ore, the issues 
implicit in sampling gold bearing veins for grade estimates become apparent.  Table 5 provides a simple summary of the 
above facts.

The ratio of the volume of gold per volume of a tonne of ore is in the range of 1:89,000 to 1:1,430,000 depending on the 
gold grade. 

The ratio of the volume of one drill hole through the volume of one tonne of ore is in the range of 1:60 to 1:190 
depending upon the diameter of the drill core. 

The two aforementioned ratios coupled together illustrates just how high the odds are against getting a representative 
sample of gold in the core passing through the tonne of rock. 

Close-spaced, production planning, stope-definition drilling is generally on 5 to 10 metres spacing, therefore a 2-metre 
wide shrinkage or cut and fill stope has one drill intersection per 140 to 560 tonnes of ore.   As noted by Rogers (1982) 
over half the holes drilled for stope-planning at the Dome returned less than 1.7 grams per tonne (the Dome mine 
consistently averaged over 10 grams per tonne of annual underground production for 8 decades).  These facts 
demonstrate the issues and problems with sampling gold ore bodies by drilling regardless of whether it is in the 
exploration or the production phase. 

In the Author's opinion it is demonstrably valid to assess the inferred resource and geological potential of developed 
and undeveloped gold zones by establishing the volume of vein zone or mineralized structure as a basis for estimating 
tonnage potential and assessing the inferred and/or potential grade based upon the grade of measured and indicated 
resources in the same zone, the grade of similar deposit types, and where available, the statistics of the assay data for 
such deposits. 

Major financings for underground exploration and development of Archean gold deposits should be based on well-
defined geological potential, otherwise, there is a high probability that Canada will miss out on significant gold 
production. 

In addition to the standard operating procedure "drill for structure" and "drift for grade" that was common to the major 
Archean gold mining operations in Canada, the other commonly accepted parable was that "gold mines are made, not 
discovered". 

16.3 GEOE X RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

The mineral resources are defined in terms of the NI-43-101 regulations (See Appendix 2).  Mineral resources estimates 
for the Project are summarised in the following sections, with, details provided in appendices to the Report. 

Since 2007 the Company has carried out an aggressive exploration program that has resulted in the discovery of a 
number of significant gold zones all of which occur on the existing mining lease in close proximity to the RLM 
infrastructure. 

16.3.1 Rice Lake Mine Resource Estimate 

The current Geoex resource estimate for the RLM is an update of the resource estimate made by the Author in 2006 
(George 2006).  The resource estimate takes into account production from the RLM from 2007 to the end of the first 
half of 2010 and incorporates new resources that have been estimated by the Company's mine geologists based on 
drilling and development in the D-Shaft area of the RLM.  See Appendix 3 for details of the resource estimate and 
related figures.

16.3.2 SG-1 Mine Resource Estimate 

The current Geoex resource estimate for the RLM is an update of the resource estimate made by the Author in 2006 
(George 2006).  The resource estimate takes into account production from the SG-1 Mine during 2007-2008.  The SG-1 
Mine was shut down in 2008.  There has been no exploration drilling completed since the decision was made to develop 
a ramp into the zone. 

See Appendix 4 for details of the resource estimate and related figures. 

The SG 1 Mine database is comprised of 49 drill holes and composites.

The mineral resources are in-situ, undiluted, and uncapped and have not had economic parameters applied to them.   

 

16.3.3 Hinge Mine Resource Estimate 

The current Geoex resource estimate for the Hinge Mine is an update of the resource estimate made by the Author 
earlier in 2010 (George 2010).  There has been insufficient exploration drilling to-date in 2010 to warrant updating the 
resource estimate.  Access to provide new drilling stations was delayed due to the predevelopment ramp mining towards 
the 007 Zone which was utilizing the Hinge ramp for access.  Drilling stations from the new 007 exploration ramp will 
be prepared during the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2010 which will permit systematic drilling beneath the current Hinge mine 
workings in order to convert existing inferred resources to the indicated and measured categories for ongoing mining 
operations. 

The resource estimate takes into account production from the Hinge Mine from initiation of underground bulk sampling 
in mid 2009 to the end of the first half of 2010.  See Appendix 5 for details of the resource estimate and related figures. 

See Appendix 5 for details of the resource estimate and related figures. 

The Hinge database is comprised of 341 drill holes totalling 272,187 feet.  The resource estimate is based on 323 
composited vein intersections comprised of a total of 2,699 individual assays.  In addition, the Company's production 
department measured and indicated resources are based upon face channel samples taken from drift face at intervals of 
approximately 10 feet within the current mine workings.

The mineral resources are in-situ, undiluted, and uncapped and have not had economic parameters applied to them.   

The Author's measured plus indicated resource estimates for the Hinge average 0.39 ounces of gold which correlates 
well with the average in-situ grade of material milled during 2009. 

16.3.4 007 Resource Estimate 

The current resource estimate supersedes the earlier 2010 (George 2010 effective date December 31, 2009) as drilling 
has continued through the first half of 2010.

17.0  MINING OPERATIONS 

17.1 MINING 

There are currently two operating mines at the Rice Lake Project with central ore processing at the Rice Lake mill. 

Rice Lake Mine 

The Rice Lake Mine is an underground operation accessed by a main shaft (A-Shaft) from surface to the 26 Level (3900 
feet below surface) where the D-Shaft is collared.  D-Shaft provides access to the 32 Level (4800 feet below surface).  
The D-Shaft currently bottoms at 5,090 feet below surface to allow for a sump and loading pockets.  A ramp system 
extends from the 32 Level to the 4710-level (5,290 feet below surface, mine grid surface elevation datum is arbitrarily 
set at 10,000 feet). 

With reference to the reserves summarized in Table 12, the C-Shaft reserves, when mined will be delivered via ore 
passes to the D-shaft collar ore bins.  C-Shaft and D-Shaft ore is loaded from the D-Shaft ore bins and trammed to the 
bottom of A-Shaft and dumped into the A-Shaft loading pass, then hoisted to surface. 

Ore from the trackless mining area is loaded with 3.5 cu. yd. loaders and hauled up the ramp in 13-ton trucks that dump 
to a 14 inch by 14 inch grizzly equipped with a rock breaker.  A short ore pass leads from the grizzly to a loading pocket 
below 32 level in D-Shaft.  Ore is hoisted in D-Shaft and trammed 4,500 feet on 26-Level using 11-ton battery 
locomotives pulling trains of 5 8-ton Grandby cars, dumped to the A-Shaft loading pocket and then hoisted to surface in 
A-Shaft. 

Four mining crews operate on two shifts, 7 days per week, with 2 crews on for 14 days while the other 2 crews are off.  
The schedule requires ore development and stope drilling operations to break an average of 200 tons per 11-hour shift.  
Development will provide about 15% of the ore and 12 stope miners will be required on each crew. 

San Gold 1 Mine 

The San Gold #1 Mine is an underground operation accessed by a ramp.  The operations were suspended in 2008 due to 
the then current economic situation. 

Ramp development commenced during the winter of 2005 and is currently at the 4th Level (400 feet below surface).  A 
number of shrinkage stopes and one long-hole stope were developed.  Ore was hauled from the underground to surface, 
then directly to the Rice Lake Mill via a new haul road that was established in 2005. 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010  Page 36 

Hinge Mine 

The Hinge Mine is an underground operation accessed by a ramp.  Ramp development commenced during the winter of 
2009 and is currently at the 9300 Level (700 feet below surface) with ramp development continuing.  A number of 
shrinkage stopes and one long-hole stope are currently being developed.  Ore is hauled from the underground to surface, 
then directly to the Rice Lake Mill via an existing mine road. 

Four mining crews operate on two shifts, 7 days per week, with 2 crews on for 14 days while the other 2 crews are off.  
The schedule requires ore development and stope drilling operations to break an average of 200 tons per 11-hour shift.   

007 Zone 

The 007 Zone will be an underground operation accessed by a ramp.  In early 2010 a decline was initiated from the 
9400 Level of the Hinge Mine towards the 007 zone.  The decline reached the zone in August 2010 and a bulk sample is 
currently being mined on the 9220 Level (approximately 800 feet below surface). 

During the second half of 2010 the Company will initiate a new ramp, to be collared near the old Wingold exploration 
shaft.  The ramp which will provide production access to the 007 Zone as well as the Cohiba and any other zones that 
may be discovered in the area north of 007 Zone. 

17.1.1 Mining Methods 

Historically shrinkage mining has been the primary mining method.  Harmony attempted to rely primarily on long-hole 
mining methods in the D-Shaft ramp area but it was basically unsuccessful because of excessive dilution. 

Shrinkage mining and silling will be the primary mining method in ongoing operations at Rice Lake Project with long-
hole methods applied only in areas where the geometry of the reserve blocks warrants its use. 

The mining plan initially calls for a gradual ramp up to 1000 tons per day of ore feed to the mill during the second half 
of 2010.  At approximately 350,000 tons per year the mill be operating at near full capacity of 1250 tons per day and 
allow for maintenance, unforeseen breakdowns, power outages etc.  

17.1.2 Resource Recovery 

It is assumed that the current production forecast (See 17.1.3) is based on recoverable ore that will be delivered to the 
mill.  Similarly in extending the operation beyond the 24 month forecast using indicated resources, it is assumed that the 
tonnage per year are tons delivered to the mill. 

17.1.3 Production Forecast 

The annual production used in the economic assessment is a base on the mine production plan for the next 24 months 
and thereafter the annual production is based on average grade of the remaining indicated resources.  The 24 month plan 
is presented in Appendix 10. 

17.2 PROCESS PLANT 

The Bissett mill employs gravity concentration, flotation and a carbon-in-leach circuits.  Capacity is 1,250 tons per day.   

The mill currently operates at full capacity on a two-week on, two-week off cycle.  Two 2 crews work 12-hour shifts for 
14 days.  On the fourteenth day, the mill is shut down and the crews are off for 14 days. 

17.2.1 Mill Flow Sheet 

Run-of-mine ore at minus 14 inches is fed at about 50 tons per hour from a coarse ore bin to a 25" x 42" jaw crusher and 
4 1/4-foot short head cone crusher operating in closed circuit with a 5/8-inch screen.  Screen undersize is fed from one 
of two fine ore bins to a 12.5' x 14', 1250 HP ball mill operating in closed circuit with a hydrocyclone classifier. The 
product size is 80% passing 150 microns. 

A centrifugal concentrator (Falcon Super-Bowl) is fed with a portion of the cyclone underflow.  The gravity rejects are 
returned to the grinding circuit while the gravity concentrate is passed over a diagonally driven shaking table for further 
gravity concentration.  The table concentrate is taken directly to the smelting furnace; table tailings were pumped to the 
flotation circuit. 

The grinding circuit product reports to the flotation circuit.  From primary conditioners, the pulp s fed to a bank of 100 
cu. ft. rougher flotation cells.  Rougher concentrate, at 3 to 5 oz. Au per ton, is passed through a regrind ball mill,

dewatered in a single tray thickener and pumped to the leach circuit.  Rougher tailings undergoes a second conditioning 
step and enters a bank of 100 cu. ft. scavenger flotation cells.  Scavenger concentrate is returned to the primary grinding 
circuit with scavenger tailings pumped to the tailings management area. 

Cyanide leaching of flotation concentrate takes place in two 12-foot diameter by 24-foot high mechanically agitated 
leach tanks.  The pulp flows from the leach circuit to a six stage carbon-in-leach circuit and an Inco cyanide destruction 
system.  Gold is removed in a pressure strip vessel where the solution is pumped up through the vessel and overflowed 
through an electrowinning cell.  The electrowinning sludge and gravity concentrate are refined in an electric induction 
furnace to produce doré bars that are shipped out for final refining. 

Tailings slurry from the flotation circuit and the CIL circuit are combined, treated and pumped some 2.5 km to the 
tailings management area. 

17.2.2 Mill Recovery 

Historic mill recovery has been 93% of the gold delivered to the mill. 

17.2.3 Tailings Management Facility 

The tailings management facility is located 2.5 km. north of the Rice Lake Mill and consists of a main tailings slurry 
containment basin and a final water polishing basin.  Water meeting the discharge requirements is released from the 
polishing basin to the natural environment. 

17.3 SITE SERVICES, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION 

All general and administrative services are operated out of a central office building, which also includes the mine dry, 
warehousing, and maintenance facilities.  There are separate buildings for cold-storage warehousing, core storage, 
sampling and processing, and an assay laboratory. 

The operating manpower work basically on a two-week in two-week out cycle, with bunkhouse accommodation on site. 

17.4 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

The Rice Lake Project is an operating mine.  The mine operates on Mining Lease (ML 063) granted by Manitoba 
Industry, Trade and Mines for a period of 21 years commencing April 1, 1992 and is renewable in accordance with the 
Manitoba Mines and Minerals Act (Government of Manitoba, 1992).  The mine operates under Environmental Licence 
No. 2628 issued by Manitoba Conservation in November 2003 and amended November 2006. 

The mine also has a Closure and Rehabilitation Plan that has been accepted by Manitoba Industry, Trade and Mines. 

17.4.1 Environmental Permit 

In the 1990's the mine initially operated under the terms of Stage I Environmental Licence No. 2161 S1 granted March 
1996 to Rea Gold Corporation.  The Stage I Licence enabled Rea Gold Corporation to complete surface and 
underground mine development activities and set into operation a gold and silver mining, milling and refining 
development known as the Bissett Gold Mine.  The only major restriction placed on the mining operations by the Stage 
I Licence was that there was no provision for regular water discharge from the Tailings Management Area ("TMA").  
Provision was allowed in the Stage I Licence for a Stage II Licence for the long-term operation of the mine, which 
would allow for annual discharges from the TMA subject to detailed description of the routing of any discharge and an 
assessment of the potential effects of the discharge on receiving waters based on the results of an Environmental 
Management and Monitoring Plan ("EMMP") to be established by Rea Gold. 

In 1996 Rea Gold Corporation initiated environmental studies and developed an EMMP as stipulated by the Stage I 
Licence.  The EMMP subsequently was submitted to Manitoba Conservation. 

Following granting of the Stage I Licence the mine and mill were expanded and upgraded and a new Tailings 
Management Area ("TMA") was developed to the north of the mine site and east of the town of Bissett. 

In July 1997 the mill commenced operation, however in December of 1997, Rea Gold Corporation filed for bankruptcy.  
A request for a Stage II Licence for the long-term operation of the mine had not been prepared and submitted by Rea 
Gold Corporation. 

Harmony Canada subsequently purchased the mining lease, mill and supporting infrastructure in April 1998 and 
continued with the development of the project under the Stage I Licence. 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010  Page 38 

Following the acquisition, Harmony Canada requested two variances to the existing Stage I Licence.  The variances 
were requested to allow for a one-time discharge of accumulated precipitation and runoff from the TMA and to allow 
for the stockpiling of ore onto the surface to allow for batch processing of ore in the mill.  Manitoba Conservation 
accepted the variance requests and issued an amended environmental licence (No. 2161 S1 RR) in September 1998, 
which remains in effect to this day. 

By August 2001, Harmony Canada had submitted preliminary documentation to support a Stage II Environmental 
Licence and as part of the Environmental Act licensing process had held an Open House for the public on September 
12, 2000 in the community of Bissett.  During August 2001 Harmony Canada submitted a final Stage II Environment 
Act Licence Application and requested Manitoba Conservation's consideration of the issuance of a Stage II Licence.  

On November 6, 2003 Manitoba Conservation issued Environmental Licence 2628 to the predecessor companies of the 
Company which is a full licence to operate a mine, mill, and tailings management facility including discharge of waters 
to the natural environment.  In November 2006, Manitoba Conservation approved a Notice of Alteration to Licence 
2628 that incorporates San Gold #1 Mine. 

All of the resources in this report, with the exception of the SG 2-3 Zones are located within the boundary of the Mining 
Lease and are covered by all of the necessary permitting. 

17.4.2 Closure and Rehabilitation Plan 

Harmony Canada submitted a Closure Plan for the Bissett Gold Mine to Manitoba Industry, Trade and Mines on 
September 1, 2001. 

The plan covers all aspects of rehabilitation and reclamation of the mine site including the old San Antonio tailings area 
and the current Tailings Management Area.  Provision is also made in the Closure Plan for post closure monitoring. 

The total estimated cost for the closure and post closure monitoring is $1,900,000. 

Manitoba Industry, Trade and Mines, by letter dated December 13, 2001 accepted the Closure Plan and a pledge of 
assets to cover the cost of closure and post closure monitoring subject to receipt of a cheque, bond or letter of credit in 
the amount of $40,000 to cover the cost of legal fees, management fees and expenses of liquidation in the event that 
Harmony Canada should default on its obligations under the closure plan. 

Geoex believes that there is no long-term financial liability to the Company relating to closure of the site, however, 
pursuant to the regulations, the Company is never fully relieved of obligations until the site has been cleaned up to the 
satisfaction of the Mines Branch. 

On this basis Geoex concludes that it is reasonable, in the economic assessment of the project in Section 17.10, to 
assume that the salvage value of assets will offset the closure and rehabilitation costs. 

17.5 OPERATING COSTS 

The Company has provided Geoex with current operating and capital cost estimates that are used in the economic 
assessment in Section 17.10.  These Company estimates and the details of the economic assessment are provide in 
Appendix 10. 

17.6 CAPITAL COSTS 

The Company has provided Geoex with capital expenditures to date and ongoing capital expenditures, which Geoex has 
reviewed and deems reasonable. 

These capital costs are contained in the economic assessment presented in Section 17.10 and described further in 
Appendix 10. 

17.7 TAXES AND OTHER LIABILITIES 

Geoex has reviewed the audited financial statements of the year ended December 31, 2009 as well as the unaudited 
statements to the end of the second quarter of 2010.  The Company has no liabilities that would materially change the 
conclusions reached relating to the economic analysis that is presented in Section 17.10. 

The unaudited financial statements for the end of the second quarter 2010 indicates that the Company has Canadian 
Exploration and Development tax pools of $46,757,030.

17.8 MARKETS 

There are no marketing matters, other than the international gold market prices, that would materially impact the 
conclusions and recommendations reached in this Report. 

17.9 CONTRACTS 

The Company has no contracts in place that would materially impact the conclusions and recommendations reached in 
this Report.  The Company currently has no hedging or forward sales contracts. 

17.10 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (Details in Appendix 10) 

Table 13 presents a summary of an economic assessment that Geoex has completed (See Appendix 10 for details) that 
demonstrates the economic viability of the Rice Lake Project. 

The economic assessment includes only measured and indicated resources, however, all of the development capital 
required to convert the inferred resources to reserves and develop those resources has been included in the economic 
assessment. 

The project has a 5.5-year mine-life based on the measured and indicated resources.  The breakeven gold price for 
recovery of capital over the life of the measured and indicated resources is US$575 per ounce 

Over a 5.5-year mine-life the project will generate $407 million cash surplus before taxes and cashflow from operations 
(EBITDA) of $463 million (average EBITDA approximately $84 million per year).  The breakeven life-of-mine gold 
price is US$575 to allow for recovery of ongoing development capital expenses. 

17.11 PAYBACK 

Basically the project is fully paid back at this time as the acquisition costs and costs to bring the project to the 
production stage have been paid for fully and are basically sunk costs funded by equity financings and convertible 
debentures. 

Projected future capital expenditures are funded by cashflow from operations. 

The project has positive cash flow from operations at gold prices in excess of US$575 and at current gold prices in 
excess of $US1200 the project will have cash surplus before taxes of approximately $407 million dollars over the 6 year 
life of the existing reserves plus measured and indicated resources. 

17.12 MINE LIFE 

The project has a mine life of 5.5 years based on measured plus indicated resources. 

In Geoex's opinion, given the current inventory of approximately 3.7 million tons of inferred resources and the long 
operating history of the Rice Lake Project, it is probable that sufficient inferred resources will be converted to resources 
to achieve a minimum of 10 years of mine life. 

NI 43-1-1 Cautionary Note - Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic 
viability and there is no certainty that the results of the economic assessment will be realized. 

The capital development allocated in the model is sufficient to fund conversion of inferred resources to reserves and as 
well has the capability to potentially add additional inferred resources to the current indicated resource inventory.

19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Drilling completed to date on the Hinge Mine, SG-1 Mine, 007 Zone and Cohiba Zone has provided sufficient data for 
the Author to complete interpretation of the geometry of the vein systems in plan and sectional views and to prepare 
resource calculations based upon industry standard polygonal long section analyis. 

The Rice Lake Mine resource is based upon a thorough review of the Company's production geologists current 
resources estimates and the Author's prior (George 2006) work on the Rice Lake Mine. 

Assumptions and details of the resource estimate are presented in Appendices 3 to 9.

The mineral resources are in-situ, undiluted, and uncapped and have not had economic parameters applied to them.   

The Author has relied on data provided by qualified persons (as defined in NI 43-101) who are employees of the 
Company.  In the Author's opinion these qualified persons are competent and, other than errors or omissions that may 
inadvertently occur, have provided the Author with all of the data necessary to complete this Report. 

The Author is of the opinion that all potential gold mineralized zones in drill core have been sampled.  Security of the 
samples both at the core logging facility and the analytical laboratory appear to be adequate to ensure the integrity of the 
samples.  The use of the metallic sieve method of assaying samples containing coarse visible gold provides a more 
accurate measure of the gold concentration in the core samples. 

Reconciliation of Company reserve estimates based on assay data, underground face samples, and mill belt samples 
indicate that the sampling and assaying protocols are providing good quality data. 

The Company monitors the QAQC (standards and blanks sent to assay laboratories and the duplicates and replicates 
done by the laboratories) information for the assaying process on a regular basis.  The Author has reviewed this 
information. 

The Author is of the opinion that the Company's assay data base is of sufficient quality to provide the basis for the 
conclusions and recommendations reached in this Report. 

The Author has no reason to believe that there are any deficiencies in information that has been received from other 
experts that would have a material impact on the opinions, conclusions and recommendations expressed by the Author 
in this Report. 

Historic exploration in the Bissett area focused on vein structures in the SAM unit and gold mineralization discovered 
along the Normandy Shear Zone to the east of the Rice Lake Mine.  There were a few gold showings discovered in the 
Bidou Lake Assemblage north of the SAM unit, however, exploration shafts were unsuccessful in establishing 
significant resources and it was concluded that the Bidou Lake sequence was not structurally conducive to the 
development of large, gold-bearing zones. 

Following discovery of the Hinge Mine, the company continued surface exploration drilling which resulted in the 
discovery of four additional zones (Cohiba, L13, 007 and Emperor) in a similar geological setting within the Bidou 
Lake Assemblage. 

Vein structures and mineralogy in the Hinge Mine and the other new zones are very similar to the 16-type and 38-type 
veins in the Rice Lake Mine.  In the Author's opinion the strike length and depth continuity potential of the vein 
structures at the Hinge should be similar to those at the Rice Lake Mine. 

The gold mineralization in the new discoveries is very similar to historic gold-bearing quartz vein structures in the Rice 
Lake Mine.  Based on interpretation of an airborne digital imagery survey completed by the Company in the spring of 
2009, the Author is of the opinion that the controlling shears structures for the Hinge, Cohiba, L13, 007 and Emperor 
vein systems are the same shear structures that control the vein systems in the RLM (See Section 9.2.2). 

An airborne LIDAR Survey is the only exploration done by the Company other than exploration drilling, the results of 
which are discussed in Sections 10 and 16,  

There is a wide-range of structural information (bedding planes, shearing, lineations, joints, geological contacts, etc) 
that can be extracted from the LIDAR bare earth digital terrain model.  Note that when viewed in Adobe Acrobat PDF 
format the quality of the data is apparent even though it is significantly degraded from the original product. 

Figure 6 presents the results of the preliminary evaluation which is focused on the major faults and related shears that 
are apparent in the LIDAR data.  On the north side of the drawing, the Wanipigow fault is obvious with a wide zone of 
intense shearing.  The Wanipigow Fault marks the boundary between the Uchi volcanic-plutonic terrain and the 
Wanipigow(Manitoba)-Berens River(Ontario) metamorphic plutonic terrain.  The Wanipigow Fault extends to the east 
through the Red Lake Area of Ontario, 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010  Page 43 

The Normandy fault and the other shear zones all appear to be splays off of the Wanipigow, which, from east to west, 
splay off from the south side of the Wanipigow Fault, initially trending to the southwest and then gradually swinging to 
a west to west northwest strike direction.  Beyond the west boundary of the map area some of the shears veer back up 
and rejoin the south side of the Wanipigow Fault. 

From the Author's experience in the area it was also apparent that these LIDAR shears have the same orientations as 
shears that cross the SAM unit and are structurally related to the shear-type and tensional-type gold bearing quartz veins 
in the RLM.  The Author, based on maps contained in a report by Rhys (2001), constructed 3-dimensional models of the 
major shear-type vein systems in the RLM and projected them up plunge to surface and found that their surface 
locations plotted very close to where the LIDAR conjugate shears cross the surface trace of the SAM unit which hosts 
the RLM gold mineralization (See Figure 7).  Further, there is a close spatial association of the new discoveries in the 
volcanic rocks that overlie the SAM Unit (Hinge, 007, L13, and Cohiba) and the Lidar shear systems (Figure 7). 

Based upon this 3-dimensional correlation the Author concludes that the LIDAR shears correlate with the RLM shears 
and hence the Hinge-type mineralization in the volcanic rocks in the hanging wall of the SAM unit are hosted in the 
same structures and thus are part of the same mineralizing event as the RLM gold mineralization. 

This interpretation has significant implications regarding the depth potential of the newly discovered mineralization at 
the Hinge and 007 as these structures within the RLM contain gold mineralization from surface to over 5000 feet below 
surface (7000 feet down the dip of the veins).  The RLM mineralization is open at depth below 5000 feet. 

Figure 8 presents an overlay of the LIDAR interpretation on a figure from Anderson (2008) which provides the regional 
trends of lineations that occur within the shears.  Based upon the LIDAR interpretation there is a reasonably accurate 
indication of the variations in the strike of the shears.  As the lineations lie in the plane of the shear, if an estimate of the 
direction and angle of plunge of the lineation can be made then variations in the dip of individual shears can be 
determined.  This can then be applied in 3D Autocad and a reasonably accurate 3D model of the shear systems and the 
known gold resources can be created.  It is beyond the scope of this Report to complete such a study, however, the 
Author is of the opinion that such a study is warranted.  It will provide new insights for the geological staff who are 
dealing with the structural complexities of the Rice Lake Project on a daily basis and further it will be a valuable tool in 
illustrating the nature of the structures to third parties who have an interest in the Property. 

There is no other relevant information known to the Author that if undisclosed would make this Report misleading or 
would make this Report more understandable. 

The economic assessment contained in this Report indicates that the Rice Lake Project is economically viable. 

The Author concludes that the work completed to date on the Property has demonstrated the presence of significant gold 
resources that warrant additional surface and underground exploration and development programs with the objective to 
confirm the geometry and continuity of the vein structures and to confirm sufficient measured and indicated mineral 
resources to warrant completion of internal feasibility studies. 

 

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
The Author recommends the following: 

1. The Company should continue funding an aggressive exploration program in the Rice Lake Area. 
2. The Company should create a 3D model of the major shear structures and resource areas on the property to 

provide a tool for use by its Exploration and Production Geologists as well as for use with third parties who 
have an interest in the Property. 

3. The Company should initiate underground bulk sampling programs on the L10, L13, and Cohiba exploration 
targets. 

4. As this Report will be made public it is inappropriate for the Author to provide other specific recommendations 
relative to ongoing exploration concepts and targets.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 
MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE DEFINITIONS 

 

 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010   

Mineral Resource 
Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated, and Measured 
categories.  An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence that that applied to an Indicated Mineral 
Resource.  An Indicated Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a 
lower level of confidence than a Measured Mineral Resource. 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic material in or on 
the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects of economic 
extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, 
estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. 

The term Mineral Resource cover mineralization and natural material of intrinsic economic interest which has been 
identified and estimated through exploration and sampling and within which Mineral Reserves may subsequently 
defined by the consideration and application of technical, economic, legal, environmental, socio-economic, and 
governmental factors.  The phrase "reasonable prospect of economic extraction" implies a judgement by the Qualified 
Person in respect of the technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction.  A 
Mineral Resource is an inventory of mineralization that under realistically assumed and justifiable technical and 
economic conditions might become economically extractable.  These assumptions must be presented explicitly in both 
public and technical reports. 

An Inferred Mineral Res ource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be 
estimated on the basis of geological evidence and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  
The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill holes. 

An Indicated Mineral Res ource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, 
shapes and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate 
application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of economic viability of the 
deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and test information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for 
geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

A Measured Mineral Resource is that part if a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, 
and physical characteristics are so well-established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the 
appropriate application of technical and economic parameters to support production planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill 
holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both the geological and grade continuity. 

Mineral Reserve  

Mineral Reserves are subdivided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Mineral Reserves and Proven Mineral 
Reserves.  A Probable Mineral Reserve has a lower confidence level that a Proven Mineral Reserve. 

A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource demonstrated by at 
least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, 
metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic mineral 
extraction can be justified.  A Mineral Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur 
when material is mined. 

Mineral Reserves are those parts of Mineral Resources which, after the application of all mining factors, result in an 
estimated tonnage and grade which, in the opinion of the Qualified Person(s) making the estimates, is the basis of an 
economically viable project after taking account of all relevant processing, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, 
environmental, socio-economic, and government factors.  Mineral reserves are inclusive of diluting material that will be 
mined in conjunction with the Mineral Reserves and delivered to the treatment plant or equivalent facility.  The term 
"Mineral Reserve" need not necessarily signify that extraction facilities are in place or operative or that all 
governmental approvals have been received.  It does signify that there are reasonable expectations of such approvals. 

A Probable Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated Mineral Resource, and in some cases a 
Measured Mineral Resource, demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include 



GEOEX LIMITED 
 

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010   

adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the 
time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. 

A Proven Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at 
least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, 
metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction 
is justified. 

Application of the term Proven Mineral Reserve category implies that the Qualified Person has the highest degree of 
confidence in the estimate with the consequent expectation in the minds of the reader of the report.  The term should be 
restricted to that part of the deposit where production planning is taking place and for which any variation of the 
estimate would not significantly affect the economic viability

APPENDIX 3-1 ASSUMPTIONS AND DETAILS 

The Author completed a resource estimate for the Rice Lake Mine (George 2006) with an effective date of 
December 31, 2006.  The resource estimate was based upon a thorough review of the measured and indicated 
resources as calculated by mine geologists coupled with the Author's estimate of inferred resources.  Details of 
these calculation by the mine geologists may be viewed in the previous report (George 2006).

Total Inferred Mineral Resources   1,879,500   0.29 (9.9)    551,620 

The mineral resources are in-situ, undiluted, and uncapped and have not had economic parameters applied to them.   

 

Since January 2007, the Rice Lake mine has milled 274,693 tons at an average recovered grade of 0.20 ounces 
per ton, which is equivalent to an in-situ resource of 219,754 tons at an average grade of 0.23 ounces per ton. 

The resources at April 4, 2010, as estimated by the mine staff are as follows (see Table in Appendix 3-2):

               D-Shaft        516,090   0.26 (8.9)    132,420 
Total Measured and Indicated Resources  1,067,440   0.25 (8.6)    270,100 

Inferred Resources 
 Drill Inferred D-Shaft Area     424,750   0.29 (9.9)    121,540 
 Inferred to 500 feet below D-Shaft Area 1,095,000   0.29 (9.9)    317,550 
Total Inferred Mineral Resources   1,519,750   0.29 (9.9)    439,090 

The mineral resources are in-situ, undiluted, and uncapped and have not had economic parameters applied to them.  The 
mineral resources include approximately 15,000 tons extracted during the second quarter of 2010. 

The current resources are based upon historic estimates by mine geologists which were based upon drill hole and face 
sample assays in developed areas coupled with estimates of area and volumes of planned stoping areas.  Current 
estimates (2009-2010) are based on Amine software, which utilizes the same database information, using Amine 
software based on industry standard digital procedures of 3D modelling of the mineralized zones, creation of block 
models, and subsequent computations to determine resource grades and tonnages.  Grades are based on drillhole data 
and face samples.  Tonnages are based upon an average specific gravity of 2.8 (11.4 cubic feet per ton). 

The resources take into account production to June 30, 2010 and the results of ongoing development and 
underground definition drilling, particularly in the 98 and 96 Vein structures. 

The attached long sections displays the RLM workings and the outlines of the major resource areas.

APPENDIX 4-1 ASSUMPTIONS AND DETAILS 

The current Geoex resource estimate for the RLM is an update of the resource estimate made by the Author in 2006 
(George 2006).  The resource estimate takes into account production from the SG-1 Mine during 2007-2008.  The SG-1 
Mine was shut down in 2008.  There has been no exploration drilling completed since the decision was made to develop 
a ramp into the zone. 

The SG 1 Mine database is comprised of 49 drill holes and composites.

SAN GOLD # 1 MINE RESERVE ESTIMATES 

Table 9.7 from Section 9 of the Report presents the Howe reserve summary.  The proven reserves are based on recent 
underground development, which has allowed the design of 7 shrinkage stopes and one long hole stope.

Howe's detailed mineral resource calculations for the San Gold #1 Zone were completed in 2005 (Howe 2005) based on 
a detailed review of the Company's polygonal resource estimates.  Howe re-measured all of the polygonal areas for 
each of the longitudinal section polygons and, from tabulations of assays and assay intervals, recalculated weighted 
averages of the intersections that form the focal point of each polygon.  Howe found a few minor, non-material 
variances from the San Gold polygonal estimates and identified five additional resource blocks (blocks P68 to P72).   

The zone has a strike of approximately 075o (true), a dip of 70 to 90o to the north and plunges approximately 45o to the 
west. 

Howe's rationale for establishing an indicated resource category is based on the consistency of the mineralized zone to a 
depth of 300 feet below surface.  The drill hole numbers indicate the year the hole was drilled, and clearly with minor 
exceptions the continuity of the zone held up well.  The areas of the resource polygons in this upper area range from 
3,432 to 21,578 square feet, which is equivalent to an area of influence around the drill holes of 30 to 75 feet.  On this 
basis, Howe is of the opinion that a maximum area of influence of 75 feet around drill holes is appropriate for the 
Indicated Resource Category on the San Gold Minerals Property for mineralization within the "Normandy Shear Zone". 

Howe's detailed resource estimate is presented in the attached table.  Howe's polygonal longitudinal section is 
attached. 

In addition to a recalculation of the polygon derived resource estimate, Howe contoured the thickness of the San Norm 
zone in longitudinal section and contoured the grade x thickness product of for each of the polygons in longitudinal
section are attached.. 

In early 2006 a ramp was initiated to allow for development drifts on the 200 foot, 250 foot, 300 foot and 400 foot 
levels below surface to sample on the structure where surface drilling had outlined indicated mineral resources (Howe 
May 2005).  Shrinkage stope development was initiated in September 2006 and a long hole stope is currently being 
developed to extract a wider portion of the mineralized zone. 

The two shrinkage stopes under development are basically being used as training stopes and there has been insufficient 
mining completed to do a reconciliation of resource estimates and production. 

Development openings at 200, 300, and 400 feet levels have confirmed the continuous, tabular, vertical nature of the 
veins structure that was the geometric basis for establishing the long section resource estimates.  Ore grade 
mineralization is visually recognizable because of the veining and associated alteration envelope. 

Because the underground development has confirmed the continuity of the mineralization, Howe has estimated inferred 
mineral resources as indicated by the hatching in the po;ygonal longitudinal section attached.

APPENDIX 5-1 ASSUMPTIONS AND DETAILS 

The Company's mine geologists carry out mineral resource estimates using Amine software which uses industry 
standard digital procedures of 3D modelling, of the mineralized zones, creation of block models, and subsequent 
computations to determine resource grades and tonnages.  Grades are based on drillhole data and face samples.  
Tonnages are based upon an average specific gravity of 2.8 (11.4 cubic feet per ton).

The Author completed a resource estimate for the Hinge with an effective date of December 31, 2009 (George 2010).  
The resource estimate used industry standard polygonal longitudinal section methodology as a cross-check of the 
Company's resource estimates. 

The Author's resource estimate as of December 31, 2009 (George 2010) was as follows. 

          Tons  Grade     Contained 
         oz./ton (g/tonne)      Ounces 

Measured Mineral Resources      116,300   0.53 (18.3)      61,980 

Indicated Mineral Resources      496,300   0.36 (12.3)    177,200 

Total Measured and Indicated Resources     612,600   0.39 (13.4)    239,180 

Inferred Mineral Resources   1,375,200   0.39 (13.4)    538,700 

In the first half of 2010 very little drilling could be accomplished beneath the current workings of the Hinge deposit due 
to construction of the exploration/bulk sample decline from the bottom of the Hinge ramp to the 007 Zone.  During the 
second half of 2010 underground drilling from a number of drill stations that are being established from the 007 Decline 
will allow a major underground exploration drilling program to convert the current inferred Hinge resources to the 
indicated category. 

Based on the Company's production records, as of June 30, 2010, the Company had depleted the resource by mining 
approximately 118,925 tons and recovered 33,450 ounces of gold.  Assuming 20% dilution, 93% gold recovery, and 
95% resource recovery, this represents 95,140 in-situ tons grading 0.46 ounces of gold per ton with 41,480 contained 
ounces of gold. 

Current remaining diluted measured resources as determined by the Company's production department are 114,740 
tons, grading 0.21 ounces of gold per ton with 24,657 contained ounces of gold.  Assuming 20% dilution, 93% gold 
recovery, and 95% resource recovery, this represents 91,790 in-situ tons grading 0.29 ounces of gold per ton with 
26,510 contained ounces of gold. 

The combined mined plus current measured resource represents an in-situ resource of 186,930 tons, containing 67,990 
ounces of gold for an average grade of 0.36 ounces of gold.  This reconciles reasonably with the Author's initial 
resource estimate overall grade of 0.39 ounces gold per ton. 

The following is the Author's adjusted resource estimate for the Hinge based on the year end December 31, 2009 
estimate and taking into account resources mined to the end of June 2010. 

          Tons  Grade     Contained 
         oz./ton (g/tonne)      Ounces 

Measured Mineral Resources        91,790   0.29 (9.9)      26,510 

Indicated Mineral Resources      425,670   0.40 (13.7)    171,190 

Total Measured and Indicated Resources     517,460   0.38 (13.0)    197,700 

Inferred Mineral Resources   1,375,200   0.39 (13.4)    538,700 

 

For the year-end December 31, 2009 resource estimate, all data required was provided to the Author by the Company in 
digital format in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  Initially, all assay data was sorted based on grade and colour-coded 
over the range from 0.05 to greater than 4 ounces per ton.  The assay data was then resorted based upon Hole ID and 
from-to data.  With digital drill logs open in a separate window, all quartz veins sampled by the geologists were

composited based on weighted average.  Subsequently the assay data were rescanned for additional anomalous gold 
assays that were not hosted in lithologies that had been logged as quartz veins.  The composites were then summarized 
in a separate spreadsheet, drill hole bearing and dip data was added for each composite and the horizontal width of the 
intersection of each composite was calculated at right-angle to the plane of the longitudinal section.  The distance of the 
intersection from the plane of the long section was also determined.  The composited assays are uncapped (uncut). 

The pierce-points for each composite were then plotted on a vertical longitudinal section oriented in a NE to SW 
direction, as viewed from the SE.  Each pierce point displayed the Hole ID, the average grade, the horizontal width, and 
the distance from the plane of the longitudinal section. 

As discussed in Section 8, 16-type shear veins which are the dominant vein-type at Hinge and 007 have greater down-
dip extent than strike extent.  Vein structures in the RLM area have vertical extents from 4 to 8 times their strike length.  
Therefore, the Author's polygonal resources are based upon elongate areas of influence.  Measured Resource estimates 
were based upon elongate a 50-foot by 100-foot elliptical areas of influence around drill hole intercepts.  Drill Indicated 
Resource estimates are based on an ellipse with axes 100x150-foot elongate in the interpreted plunge direction. 

Polygonal areas were entered into a composite data base and tonnage was calculated based upon horizontal width and a 
specific gravity of 2.8 (11.4 cubic feet per tonne). A specific gravity of 2.8 has historically been used for tonnage 
calculations.  Specific gravity measurements for Hinge core intercepts range from 2.6 (100% quartz) to 2.93.  In the 
Author's opinion the experienced-based SG 2.8 is a valid general assumption for the mineralization in the camp. 

The initial tonnage estimate completed by the Author correlated well with the uncut measured tonnage estimated by the 
Company's production department, however, the grade estimated by the Author understated the grade estimated by the 
Company's production by approximately 100%.  As discussed in detail in Section 16.2, this is a common issue when 
estimating the grade of a gold resource based upon wide spaced exploration drilling. 

The Company's production department's estimate is based on closer spaced drilling plus face samples taken at 
approximately 10-feet intervals along development headings on the vein system.  Further, the reconciliation of the 
production departments's incapped (uncut) estimates with mill production has validated their estimations. 

Therefore the Author has factored his grade estimates up by a factor of 1.5 in order to determine the grade of the 
measured and indicated resources (See Table 2 of this Appendix). 

Table 1 presents the Author's resource estimate.  Note that this is an undiluted, uncapped, in-situ estimate of grade and 
tonnage. 

          Tons  Grade     Contained 
         oz./ton (g/tonne)      Ounces 

Measured Mineral Resources      116,300   0.53 (18.3)      61,980 

Indicated Mineral Resources      496,300   0.36 (12.3)    177,200 

Total Measured and Indicated Resources     612,600   0.39 (13.4)    239,180 

Inferred Mineral Resources   1,375,200   0.39 (13.4)    538,700 

The average horizontal width is approximately 6 feet. 

With reference to Table 2 of this Appendix, the measured resource for Hinge zones 1 to 6 are based upon the 
Company's production department Amine estimates.  The Author has added three additional zones to the measured 
category to arrive at the total tons and grade in the measured category.  The measured resource from the 9850 level to 
the 9450 level (400 vertical feet) along a strike length of 700 feet equates to 291 tons per vertical foot at an average 
grade of 0.53 ounces per ton (155 ounces per vertical foot). 

Drilling has indicated that the Hinge zone persists to at least the 8550 level an in the Author's opinion it is justified to 
project an indicated resource for an additional 400 feet beneath the measured resource based upon the tons and grade 
per vertical foot of the measured resource. 

Further based on the Author's reconciled indicated resources, based upon drilling above the 9450 level, indicated 
resources above the 9050 have been established for an additional 50 feet to the east and west of the measured resources 
at an average grade of 0.30 ounces per ton.

San Gold Rice Lake Project, September 2010   

The total measured plus indicated resource of 611,746 tons grading 0.39 ounces gold per ton equates to 764 tons per 
vertical foot at an average grade of 0.39 (299 ounces per vertical foot). 

Inferred resources are based upon projection of average grade and tons vertical foot of measured plus indicated 
resources to a total depth of 4 times the strike length of the mineralized zone. 

Drill inferred resource estimates were made in the area between the 9050 level and 8550 level where sufficient wide-
space drilling has been completed to confirm continuation of the Hinge structure but insufficient to make a resource 
grade estimate.  The tons and grade of the drill inferred resource was based upon the tons per vertical foot and average 
grade of the measured plus indicated resources. 

Additional inferred resources were interpreted down dip below the 8550 level to the 7250 level, representing a vertical 
resource depth of 2600 feet which is less than 4 times the current known strike length of the vein structure.  Historically 
mined veins in the RLM shear structures have down dip depth extents that are 4 to 8 times the strike length of the vein.  
The tons and grade of the inferred resources was based upon the tons per vertical foot and average grade of the 
measured plus indicated resources.

Company Methodology 

The Company's mine geologists carry out mineral resource estimates using Amine software which uses industry 
standard digital procedures of 3D modelling, of the mineralized zones, creation of block models, and subsequent 
computations to determine resource grades and tonnages.  Grades are based on drill hole data and face samples.  
Tonnages are based upon an average specific gravity of 2.8 (11.4 cubic feet per ton). 

Geoex Methodology 

The Author used industry standard polygonal longitudinal section methodology to complete this initial estimate of the 
007 resources.  Because of the drill hole spacing only indicated and inferred resources have been estimated.  The Author 
also reviewed the drilling data in plan and section views to confirm the hole to hole continuity of the intercepts.  An 
Amine 3D model of the structure created by the Company's production personnel also confirmed that there is 
reasonable continuity of the structure. 

All data required was provided to the Author by the Company in digital format in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  
Initially, all assay data was sorted based on grade and colour-coded over the range from 0.05 to greater than 4 ounces 
per ton.  The assay data was then resorted based upon Hole ID and from-to data.  With digital drill logs open in a 
separate window, all quartz veins sampled by the geologists were composited based on weighted average.  Subsequently 
the assay data were rescanned for additional anomalous gold assays that were not hosted in lithologies that had been 
logged as quartz veins.  The composites were then summarized in a separate spreadsheet, drill hole bearing and dip data 
was added for each composite and the horizontal width of the intersection of each composite was calculated at right-
angle to the plane of the longitudinal section.  The distance of the intersection from the plane of the long section was 
also determined. 

The pierce-points for each composite were then plotted on a vertical longitudinal section oriented in a NE to SW 
direction, as viewed from the SE.  Each pierce point displayed the Hole ID, the average grade, the horizontal width, and 
the distance from the plane of the longitudinal section. 

As discussed in Section 8, 16-type shear veins which are the dominant vein-type at Hinge and 007 have greater down-
dip extent than strike extent.  Vein structures in the RLM area have vertical extents from 4 to 8 times their strike length.  
Therefore, the Author's polygonal resources are based upon elongate areas of influence.  Indicated Resource estimates 
are based on an ellipse with axes 100x150-foot elongate in the interpreted plunge direction.  Inferred Resource estimates 
are based on an ellipse with axes 150x225-foot elongate in the interpreted plunge direction. 

Polygonal areas were entered into a composite data base and tonnage was calculated based upon horizontal width and a 
specific gravity of 2.8 (11.4 cubic feet per tonne). A specific gravity of 2.8 has historically been used for tonnage 
calculations for the Rice Lake Project. 

Table 1 presents the Author's resource estimate.  Note that this is an undiluted, uncapped, in-situ estimate of grade and 
tonnage.

Inferred Mineral Resources         398,200   0.47 (16.1)    186,980 

The average horizontal width is approximately 9 feet. 

Additional inferred resources were interpreted down dip below the 8550 level to the 7250 level, representing a vertical 
resource depth of 2600 feet which is less than 4 times the current known strike length of the vein structure.  Historically 
mined veins in the RLM shear structures have down dip depth extents that are 4 to 8 times the strike length of the vein.  
The tons and grade of the inferred resources was based upon the tons per vertical foot and average grade of the 
measured plus indicated resources.

The current Geoex resource estimate for the Cartwright is taken directly from resource estimate made by the Author in 
2006 (George 2006).  There has been no further drilling of Cartwright since the 2006 report. 

The Cartwright Zone database is comprised of 218 holes totalling 67,272 feet and 4,802 assays.  The resource estimate 
is based upon 220 composited vein intersections comprised of a total of 1,102 individual assays.

CARTWRIGHT ZONE RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

The Company has not made any preliminary resource estimates for the Cartwright Zone and retained Howe to complete 
that task as part of this Report. 

Howe was provided with digital copies of all raw drill hole data (survey, lithology, and assays) and from that data, 
Howe created drill sections and longitudinal sections, which were then interpreted by hand.  Polygons were drawn 
around drill hole pierce points projected to a vertical, east-west longitudinal section, parallel to the Rice Lake Mine grid.  
The long section is viewed looking north. 

The geometry of the vein systems in the SAM Unit are described in Section 6.3 along with their apparent geometry 
when viewed in a vertical longitudinal section. 

Areas were measured using AutoCad and volumes (cubic feet) were determined by the area of the vertical long section 
polygon times the horizontal width of the drill hole intersection (projected horizontally at right angles to the section. 

These are industry standard methods and when applied by geologists who are knowledgeable about the details of the ore 
body provide an accurate assessment of the resource potential of the deposit. 

The following areas of influence have been determined to be appropriate from historic operations in the Rice Lake 
Mine. 

Measured Resource Vertical extensions up to 50 feet above and below development and/or stoping.  No 
strike extensions to open ground are included. 

Indicated Resource Maximum vertical extensions of 50 feet beyond measured blocks.  Up to 50 feet 
along strike and 75 feet vertical projection from drill hole information (equivalent to 15,000 sq. ft.). 

At this early stage in the exploration of the Cartwright Zone, Howe has only used the Indicated and Inferred Resource 
categories.  The average area of influence around pierce points in the Howe resource estimate is 45 feet with the largest 
polygonal area in the Howe resource estimates having an area of influence of 90 feet around the pierce point.  These 
areas of influence are well within the defined limits for the Rice Lake Mine.  Less than 10% of the resource in the area 
drilled falls within the Inferred Resource category. 

The Cartwright surface drill plan and longitudinal section are attached.  A longitudinal sectiion of the Rice Lake Mine
showing the position of the currently drilled portions of the Cartwright Zone relative to the Rice Lake Mine is shown
on the attached combined longitudinal sections. 

During the summer of 2006, one hundred and five drill holes tested the Cartwright Zone along a strike length of 2000 
feet and to a maximum depth of 1300 feet below surface.  Drilling is still in progress and will continue through the 
winter.  With reference to the longitudinal section there is a lack of shallow drilling along most of the westerly part of 
the zone.  This is due to the presence of a large, flooded, swampy area at the west end of Rice Lake where drills can 
only be set up during the winter months. 

Howe is of the opinion that it is reasonable to project additional inferred resources within the area drilled based on the 
total tonnage of the vein zone structures included in the indicated resource category.  It is an accepted principal in 
evaluation of gold deposits by drilling that you drill for structure but drift for grade.  The inherent problem of sampling 
lode gold deposits with drill core is that only a few small flecks of gold in one ton (11.5 cubic feet of rock in the case of 
the Rice Lake Mine) is ore and there is a low probability that every drill hole through the structure will return economic 
grades.  The drilling will however confirm the geometry and continuity of the vein structure. 

Howe has calculated that, based on the total width of the vein structures that contain significant gold assays, there are 
approximately 400,000 tonnes of vein material related to the gold-bearing intersections that make up the indicated 
resources.  Therefore Howe infers that there are an additional 350,000 tonnes of inferred resources within the area 
drilled. 

In addition, Howe is of the opinion that it is appropriate to project inferred resources up and down dip from the 2000 
foot strike length that has currently been drilled over a vertical distance averaging 500 feet from 400 to 900 feet below 
surface.  One drill hole CW-06-22 intercepted the structure at approximately 1300 feet vertically below surface and 
produced an intercept grading 0.23 ounces per ton gold over a core width of 9 feet (approximately 8 feet true width).  
Based on projecting an inferred resource up and down dip 500 feet, from the 2000 foot strike length that has currently

been drilled Howe infers that there area an additional 800,000 tons of inferred resources at grades similar to the 
indicated resources. 

Finally, there is a 1000 foot strike length between the Rice Lake Mine and the east end of the 2000 foot strike length 
that was drilled (no drilling can be done in this area because of infrastructure (homes and municipal buildings)) and 
Howe is of the opinion that it is appropriate to infer an additional 600,000 tons of inferred resources at grades similar to 
the indicated resources. 

The drawings presented in Appendix 4 clearly illustrate this inferred potential.
