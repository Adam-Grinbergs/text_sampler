3.0 SUMMARY 
QMI Seismic Inc. (QMI Seismic Inc.) entered into an option agreement with Ken Ellerbeck and 
Gerald Locke whereby QMI Seismic Inc. can earn a 100% interest in the Gold Hill property 
("Property") located 317 kilometres northeast of Vancouver. The property is comprised of two 
contiguous mineral claims covering an area of 604.7385 hectares. 

The Property is also located 1,650 metres south of the formerly productive Windpass and the Sweet 
Home mines from which a reported 1,071,684 grams of gold was produced from two extensive east-
west gold-bearing shear zones which associated with a regional north trending contact structure. The 
structure is the contact between the eastern unit and the western unit of the Fennell Formation and 
trends southerly from the past producers mid-centre through the Property. 

Mineralization at the Windpass is hosted by quartz veins with free gold, native copper, chalcopyrite, 
and other minerals.  

The Property is also adjacent to a property to the west where at least four sub-parallel quartz vein 
zones occupy two easterly striking, steeply dipping fault-shear systems that cut massive pillow 
basalts. Two of the veins, one of which has been traced over a strike length of 300 metres, are 40 
metres apart and dip steeply north into the hillside. Carbonate alteration (ankerite?) envelopes the 
vein zones. A total of 300 metres of drifting and cross-cutting had been carried out from nine adits 
by 1930. The mined quartz vein and wall-rock was transported to the creek where the rock was 
crushed and panned for the free gold. The eastern ends of the two veins are indicated within 250 
metres of the QMI Property 

A 2005 soil geochemical survey covered the two veins and a localized portion of the QMI Property 
along the indicated easterly vein extensions. The gold in soil; results (Figure 4) reveal that two 
spotty anomalous gold values of 200 ppb and 49 ppb gold occur on the Property along the eastward 
projection of the two Gold Hill veins 

The QMI Property contains the potential structures for mineral conduits and for the controls to mineral 
deposition. The location of the main structure, the northerly trending fault contact zone is known; the 
intersecting cross structures have to be located and the specific area explored for geological indications 
of sub-surface mineral zones. 

An exploration program of geophysical, geological, and geochemical surveys estimated to cost 
$108,000.00 is recommended to locate potentially economic, gold-bearing mineral zones associated 
with east-west and/or intersecting structures as at the formerly productive Windpass and the Sweet 
Home mines.

4.0 INTRODUCTION 

4.1 Terms of Reference and Purpose 

At the request of officials of QMI Seismic Inc. the writer was requested to write a geological 
summary report on the Gold Hill property in a 43-101 format. The purpose of the report is to 
establish the geological merits of the Property to the containment of potentially economic mineral 
zones and if warranted, to recommend an exploration program to explore for and develop a mineral 
resource. 

The writer has not completed an examination of the Gold Hill property due to the snow cover which 
would not evaluation which was basically a review of pertinent reports and to take samples for 
verification of mineralization on the property as reported on from prior exploration results. 

4.2 Source of Information and Data 
Information for this report on the Property was obtained from pertinent published reports as cited in 
the Selected Reference section of this report and from previously related exploration work by the 
author in the immediate and general area of the Gold Hill property since 1980.

Gerald Locke and Ken Ellerbeck and are valid and in good standing to the dates as documented in 
Table 1 of this report. 

6.2 Property Location 
The Property is located in the Kamloops Mining Division of British Columbia Canada, 85 kilometres 
north of Kamloops and 325 Kilometres northeast of Vancouver. The centre of the Property is at 
5700500N, 703500E (NAD 83). 

Figure 2. Claim Location 
(from MapPlace) 

 

6.3 Permits and Liabilities 
In order to maintain the claims in good standing, exploration work equivalent to $4.00 per hectare in 
the first three years of ownership and $8.00 per hectare in the fourth and succeeding years is 
required to be applied as assessment work on the claim. Cash payment in lieu of the required work 
expenditures is allowed. The assessment work or cash payment has to be applied prior to the date of 
the claim expiration. 

There are no other constraints, obligations, or environmental liabilities known to the writer that 
constitute a concern in regards to exploration on the property. The exploration recommended in the 
first stage of exploration as reported in this document will not require a permit. Should the 
recommended exploration program proceed to the second stage, a permit for drilling would be 
required which is normally issued within thirty days submitting the application.

7.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND  
 PHYSIOGRAPHY 

7.1 Access 

Road access from Kamloops is northward via the Yellowhead South Highway #5 for 58 kilometres 
to the town of Barrier thence via the Dunn Lake road northward for 24 kilometres to within one 
Kilometre of the south end of Dunn Lake thence eastward for two and one-half  kilometres to the 
western border of the Gold Hill property. The road continues for three kilometres through half the 
width of the Property of which the first two kilometres is within the Mining Lease of the adjacent 
property. 

Figure 3.Property, Claims, Location, and Access 
           (Base Map from MapPlace) 

7.2 Climate 
The region is situated within the dry belt of British Columbia with rainfall between 25 and 30 cm per 
year. Temperatures during the summer months could reach a high of 35 and average 25C with the 
winter temperatures reaching a low of -10 and averaging 8. On the Property snow cover could be 
from December to April which could hamper a year-round exploration program at higher elevations. 

7.3 Water 
Sufficient water for all phases of the exploration program should be available from the many lakes 
and creeks, which are located within the confines of the Property. Dunn Creek which drains into 
Dunn Lake some five kilometres west, winds its way centrally through the Property.

7.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY (cont'd) 

7.4 Physiography 
The Property is situated within the western margins of the Shuswap Highlands-Adams Plateau 
region of mountainous terrene with deeply incised valleys. Steep to moderate slopes prevail with 
relief in the order of some 1,100 metres from 700 metres at the western boundary and at the Dunn 
Creek valley to elevations of up to 1,800 metre in the northeast corner. A moderate forest cover of 
pine, spruce, and cedar dominates. 

7.4 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
Merritt or Kamloops, historic mining centres, could be a source of experienced and reliable 
exploration and mining personnel and a supply for most mining related equipment. Kamloops is 
serviced daily by commercial airline and is a hub for road and rail transportation. Vancouver, a port 
city on the southwest corner of, and the largest city in the Province of British Columbia, is four 
hours distant by road and less than one hour by air from Kamloops. 

7.5 Potential Areas for Tailings Disposal and Plant Sites 
There are adequate sites on and/or peripheral to the property for potential tailings storage areas, 
waste disposal areas and processing plant sites. The mine-mill operation would be subject to 
approved environmental impact studies and government regulation. 

8.0 HISTORY AND PREVIOUS WORK 
8.1 Prior Ownership and Work Completed by Previous Owners 

The history of exploration is scant with the documented evidence showing that the history of work 
completed on the QMI Property was a soil geochem survey which was completed by Sego 
Resources Inc. in 2005 on the adjacent ground of the Gold Hill prospect (Minfile 092P.041) and 
infringed on a localized portion of the QMI Property. Portions of the Sego geochem map with the 
soil geochem results of gold (Au) are reproduced in part as Figure 4. 

8.2 Production History  

There is no recorded production from the Gold Hill property 

8.3 History of Exploration by QMI Seismic Inc. 

QMI Seismic Inc. has not performed any exploration work on the Gold Hill property. 

9.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
9.1 Area Geology 

Regionally, a 12 kilometer northerly trending band of the Late Paleozoic Fennell Formation rocks 
are bordered by a Cretaceous batholith (Kqm) to the east and a Late Triassic to Early Jurassic 
batholith (LTrJgd) to the west. The Fennell Formation is divided into an eastern unit of consisting of 
massive and pillowed basalt, bedded chert, argillaceous rocks, conglomerate, quartz feldspar 
porphyry, and gabbroic to dioritic rocks (DPFL) designated as the Lower Stratigraphic Division, 
with the western Upper Structural Division consisting almost entirely of pillowed and massive and 
pillowed basalt (PnPFU). The two Divisions are indicated in a gently undulating fault contact.

Figure 4. Soil geochem results for Au on the Property and on the adjacent Gold Hill veins 
(From Sampson, 2006) 

(see Figure 2 for this location on the Gold Hill property) 

 

The fault contact generally trends north-northwesterly through the centre of the Property and also 
bisects the mineral lease of the adjacent ground which projects for two kilometers into the Property 
(Figure 5). At the Windpass (Minfile 092P041) and the Sweet Home (Minfile 092P040) past 
producers located 750 metres north of the Property the fault contact trends at N15E and is the 
control to the mineral zones. The (Windpass) straddles the thrust contact between the upper or western 
structural division and the lower or eastern structural division of the Fennell Formation in a contact which 
trends N15E Coyle (1987).

9.1 Area Geology (cont'd) 

Production from the Windpass and the Sweet Home is reported as 93,435 tonnes containing a 
reported 1,071,684 grams gold, 1663,000 grams silver, and 78,906 kilograms of copper (Minfile 
report).Production was from two extensive gold bearing quartz vein/shear systems which were 
discovered in 1926. These strike east-west, dip approximately 40° north and occur within a diorite 
sill of the Upper Paleozoic Fennell Formation. The two veins are crudely parallel, have the same 
attitude and are about 900 meters apart.  

Figure 6. Regional & Property Geological Map 
(From MapPlace) 

 

 

At the Sweet Home Coyle (1987) reports that: 

"The Sweet Home vein strikes 290 degrees with varying dips from 10 to 50 degrees north but 
averages 30 degrees. Within the chert which forms the western wall of the diorite sill, the vein is 
only centimetres wide and has little sulphide and low gold values. From here, it extends 152 metres 
to the east where it is thought to be truncated by a northwest-trending fault. It is not known if an 
offset continuation exists."

9.1 Area Geology (cont'd) 

On the adjacent property to the west, the property is underlain by the western Fennell assemblage 
consisting predominantly of northerly striking, moderately dipping, massive dark green pillow 
basalts. Easterly striking fault and shear structures, frequently mineralized, cut the rocks. A small 
gabbroic stock lies immediately south of and downhill of the vein occurrences.  

At least four sub-parallel quartz vein zones occupy two easterly striking, steeply dipping fault-shear 
systems that cut massive pillow basalts. Two of the veins, one of which has been traced over a strike 
length of 300 metres, are 40 metres apart and dip steeply north into the hillside. Carbonate alteration 
(ankerite?) envelopes the vein zones. 

A total of 300 metres of drifting and cross-cutting had been carried out from nine adits by 1930. The 
mined quartz vein and wall-rock was transported to the creek where the rock was crushed and 
panned for the free gold. 

A 2005 soil geochemical survey covered the two veins and a localized portion of the QMI Property 
along the indicated easterly vein extensions. The gold in soil; results (Figure 4) reveal that two 
spotty anomalous gold values of 200 ppb and 49 ppb gold occur on the Property along the eastward 
projection of the two Gold Hill veins. The eastern ends of the two veins are indicated within 250 
metres of the QMI Property. 

9.2 Property Geology  

The fault contact between the eastern and the western units of the Fennell assemblages trends north-
northwesterly through the centre of the QMI Property and northward to the Sweet Home, a past 
producer 750 metres north, and the Windpass, a past producer 1,650 metres north. The eastern 
portion of the QMI Property is underlain by the eastern unit which consists of massive and pillowed 
basalt, bedded chert, argillaceous rocks, conglomerate, quartz feldspar porphyry, and gabbroic to 
dioritic rocks (DPFL). A quartz monzonite intrusive (Kqm) contacts the eastern unit rocks along the 
eastern border of the Property. 

The western portion of the QMI Property is underlain by the western unit which consists almost 
entirely of massive and pillowed basalt (PnPFU) and which hosts the Gold Hill mineral prospect 250 
metres to the west of the QMI Property. 

10.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
Exploration targets on the Property are: 

 Hydrothermal/epigenetic veins, polymetallic veins associated with shear zones; 

 Mineralized skarn deposits associated with the intrusive-eastern assemblage rocks; 

 Mineralized epithermal vein systems associated with the intrusive.

11.0 MINERALIZATION 
There is no reported mineralization on the QMI Property other than that indicated by the anomalous 
gold values in the Sego soil samples. 
At the Sweet Home mine, 750 metres north of the Property, mineralization is in gold-bearing quartz 
veins which cut the Devonian to Permian Fennell Formation of the Slide Mountain Group. The 
Sweet Home vein is comprised of quartz with variable but minor amounts of pyrite and chalcopyrite, 
bismuth sulphide and telluride in small amounts  

At the Windpass mine, 900 metres north of the Sweet Home, quartz veins ranging from several 
centimetres to almost one metre in width and averaging 38 to 46 centimetres contain variable 
amounts of pyrite, chalcopyrite, bismuth sulphide, free gold, magnetite and gold tellurides. The 
northern Windpass vein is the more extensive and is characterized by free gold in quartz, magnetite, 
bismuthinite, tellerium, pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, minor silver, and native copper 

On the adjacent property, an easterly trending quartz vein, quartz veinlet, and quartz stringer zone 
250 metres west of the Property, hosts disseminated galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite and 
arsenopyrite minerals over relatively narrow widths. Some native gold has been reported. 

12.0 EXPLORATION BY QMI SEISMIC INC. 
QMI Seismic Inc. has not performed any exploration on the Gold Hill property. 

13.0 DRILLING 

There was no drilling done by QMI Seismic Inc. on the Gold Hill property. 

14.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
There was not any sampling completed on the Gold Hill property. 

15.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

Not applicable. 

16.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

Not applicable. 

17.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
There are two properties adjacent to the QMI Property that have been explored to some extent. The 
Sweet Home and the Windpass, both within 1,650 metres to the north have been explored since 
1926. The last exploration on the adjacent property to the west was in 2005 when Sego Resources 
Inc. completed a soil geochem survey which was expanded to include a localized portion of the 
QMI Property. That portion includes the area of indicated vein extension from the adjacent property. 

More information on these adjacent properties is reported on in Sections 9.0 and 11.0 of this report. 

18.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
There was no mineral processing and/or metallurgical testing performed on any material from the 
Gold Hill property.

resources must meet the condition of "a reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction".

The author is unaware of any additional information concerning the Gold Hill property that is 
pertinent to this report 

21.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The QMI Property (Property) covers a geological sequence of rocks which are favourable to hosting 
potential economic mineral resources. Although the Property remains virtually unexplored, the 
geology, including structure, is comparable to the geology of the adjacent properties. 

The three kilometre fault structure contact on the Property is a prime exploration target for gold-bearing 
mineral zones comparable to the mineral zones at the Sweet Home and the Windpass to the north. The 
location of cross structures, where steeply dipping east-west structures intersect the major northerly 
trending thrust fault, is a prime location to the deposition of minerals emanating from possibly the 
quartz monzonite intrusive with the east-west structures as the conduit. 

The western unit of the Fennell assemblage may be more susceptible to the formation of east-west 
structures as indicated from the structures hosting gold bearing veins on the adjacent property to the 
west. As the structure is "gold-in-soil" indicated to extend easterly to and on the Property, the structure 
may extend westerly to the north trending fault which intersection could be the controlling structure for 
a Windpass or a Sweet Home gold zone. 

It is concluded that the QMI Property contains the potential structures for mineral conduits and for the 
controls to mineral deposition. The location of the main structure, the northerly trending fault contact 
zone is known; the intersecting cross structures have to be located and the specific area explored for 
geological indications of sub-surface mineral zones. 

22.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
It is recommended that initially a general coverage of the Property over selected areas be covered by 
a VLF-EM survey to locate potential mineral controlling structures. One of these areas would be the 
complete north-south coverage of the fault contact over a width of 300 metres. The second area 
would be the area over the indicated eastward mineral hosting structure from the western boundary 
(250 metres from the eastern end of the zone on the adjacent property) to the main fault contact.  
Follow-up exploration would be over prime anomalous VLF-EM conductors and would consist of a 
soil survey, and geological mapping and sampling.
