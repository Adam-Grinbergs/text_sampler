While the property is not presently accessible by road, there are a number of 
overgrown seismic lines and exploration roads located south and east of the 
property.  Airstrips developed to support the construction of the Alaska Highway are 
located within 50 to 70 km east, west, and south of the property.  The closest town, 
and location of nearest serviced airstrip, is Fort Nelson (approximately190 km). 

Weather data collected at Fort Liard A-Station, Northwest Territories (NWT) 
(approximately 85 km from the site), between 1973 and 2011 indicate that January is 
the coldest month of the year, with a daily temperature averaging -22.5°C, and 
extremes ranging from 9.5°C to -46.7°C.  July is the warmest month of the year, with 
daily temperature averaging 23.2°C and extremes ranging from 34.5°C to 2.0°C.  
Total annual precipitation is 447.2 mm (107.9 mm of snow and 339.3 mm of rain).  
The Hydrological Atlas of Canada indicates approximately 300 mm of annual pond 
evaporation for the area (DFE 1978). 

There is no infrastructure at the proposed mine site. 

The property lies in the Liard Plateau physiographic region within the Northern Boreal 
Mountains Ecoprovince.  Topography ranges from approximately 1,040 to 1,640 m in 
elevation.  The Ghost Ridge claims of interest area of the property is alpine.  
Vegetation consists of lichen, moss, grasses, and buck brush with sparse stunted 
pine and spruce. 

The shale gas industry has been active in the exploration and development of the 
HRB; most supplies and personnel (professional, technical, trades and skilled 
workers) are available from Fort Nelson, whose population is approximately 5,000. 

1 . 4  H I S T O R Y  

There is no record of any mineral exploration or historical information regarding the 
mineral potential of the property before 2009.  Stikine's initial reconnaissance of the 
property took place in July 2009, which triggered subsequent exploration programs.

The region is covered by a succession of platformal clastic and carbonate 
sedimentary rocks unconformably overlying metamorphic basement.  The property is 
underlain by Silurian to Triassic clastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks.  The Ghost 
Ridge claims of interest area of the Property comprises a well-exposed quartz arenite 
formation that is Cambrian in age.  This quartz arenite unit is the focus of exploration 
as a potential source of frac sand.

Frac sand is a fine-grained, pure quartz material that is used for hydraulic fracturing, 
a technique used in the development of shale-gas resources, such as those in the 
HRB.  Frac sand must comprise sized, fine-grained, pure quartz grains, to meet 
industry specifications for physical properties such as sphericity, roundness, and 
grain strength. 

Frac sand is sourced from three main deposit types: unconsolidated sand, cemented 
sandstone (quartz arenite), or metamorphosed sandstone (quartzite).  For deposits 
that are cemented or metamorphosed, processing technique is important due to the 
possibility of breaking grains, which affects the number of grains that would meet 
industry specifications. 

1 . 7  E X P L O R A T I O N  

The focus of exploration on the property was to find a sandstone unit that could be 
processed as frac sand for use in the nearby HRB. 

The 2009 exploration program consisted of an initial reconnaissance assessment, 
bedrock mapping and sampling, and a follow-up diamond drilling exploration 
program. 

In 2010, a 430 t bulk sample was collected by blasting quartz arenite in the south-
central portion of the property.  The material was collected and shipped to a custom 
pilot processing plant in Abbotsford, BC.  The purpose of this testing was to confirm 
laboratory results and to determine if the material, under steady state processing 
conditions, could be reasonably disaggregated into a product that meets 
recommended industry standards for frac sand. 

1 . 8  D R I L L I N G  

Nine HQ-diameter drillholes were completed in September and October 2009, 
recovering 934 m of core.  All holes were drilled on the northern half of Ghost Ridge 
claims of interest area of the property.  The drillholes were from 70 to 168 m long, 
which represents the minimum thickness of the quartz arenite unit.  The area 
covered by the drilling is approximately 2.2 km long x 0.9 km wide. The quartz 
arenite is continuous and visually homogeneous over the area drilled. 

Forty-one petrography samples were collected from drillcore, with one thin section 
produced from each sample.  Results indicate the quartz arenite comprises greater 
than 97% sub-angular to sub-rounded, tightly-packed, fine-grained quartz grains 
(Ross 2009), which are potentially suitable for use as frac sand.  A total of 41 core 
samples were submitted for whole rock geochemical analysis of major oxides and 
trace elements.  Results from these analyses indicate an average silica content of

the quartz arenite of 98.16% silicon dioxide (SiO2).  Specific gravity (SG) tests were 
completed on 21 pieces of core, yielding an average value of 2.734.

Sample preparation and security was conducted under the supervision of Stikine's 
consultant, Mr. Robert Lane (Plateau Minerals).  Analyses were completed by SGS 
Canada Inc. laboratories (initial test processing), Inspectorate-IPL (geochemistry 
samples), Vancouver Petrographics Ltd. (thin section preparation) and AcmeLabs 
(SG samples) using industry standard techniques and methodologies.

Wardrop verified electronic assay laboratory data sheets in PDF format.  Samples 
were tested for whole rock composition, trace elements and SG.  Additionally, thin 
sections were created for selected samples.  The thin section interpretation was 
meant to define the grain size distribution in lieu of a grade identifier.

Mineral processing and metallurgical testing is currently being conducted by Met-
Solve in their laboratory in Langley, BC, and at a pilot plant test facility in Abbotsford, 
BC.  Based on this work, it is estimated that the process will produce a 60% yield of 
commercial frac products.  The laboratory and pilot plant test work demonstrate the 
potential of the deposit and the process to produce commercial frac sand products.  
Additional test work and further research will help to optimize yields and flowsheet 
efficiencies.

Results from bedrock mapping, core drilling, 3D wireframe modelling and rock 
volumetric estimation outline a sub-horizontal sheet of quartzite that covers 
approximately 2.3 km2 and is between 70 and 168 m thick.  The dimensions of the 
wireframe are limited to no more than 100 m from a drillhole and by the length of the 
drillholes.  The corresponding sheet of quartz arenite has a volume of 257 Mm3.  SG 
tests performed on 21 pieces of core yielded an average of 2.734.  Using this SG, 
the volume of rock outlined by the 3D wireframe model corresponds to an Inferred 
resource of 702 Mt of raw, unprocessed quartz arenite with an adjusted Inferred 
resource of 625 Mt. 

A 5% reduction was applied to the Inferred resource to account for the possible 
prescence of anomalies not detected by existing drillholes; an additional reduction of

The deposit will be mined using open pit methods over a LOM of 25 years, aligning 
10 open pits along strike  The mining rate for the starter pit is 2.734 Mt/a.  The mining 
rate for all nine remaining pits will be 1.67 Mt/a 

The mining concept is based on a series of adjacent pits of increasing dimensions to 
allow for progressive backfilling of tailings to avoid the need for an external tailings 
management facility (TMF).  This has considerable environmental and cost benefits. 
The general arrangement of the mine is shown in Figure 1.3. 

The rock from the first pit will be excavated and placed in a rock stockpile, and then 
processed at the end of the mine life after all the other pits have been completed.  
The rock from the second pit will be processed, and its tailings will be returned to the 
first pit.  Once the second pit is complete, the third pit will commence.  The tailings 
from this pit will be returned to the second pit and the first pit will be capped with 
rock.  This sequence will continue until all the pits are complete. 

All the rock will be drilled and blasted.  The drill and blast process is designed to 
produce rock fragmentation suitable for easy loading and processing.  Pit rock will be 
loaded by medium-sized front end loaders and hauled to processing by rigid dump 
trucks. 

The mine will be operated by contractors with site management and supervision 
provided by company personnel.

The objective of the processing plant will be to liberate sandstone into specifically 
sized frac sand.  The proposed process will be entirely mechanical, and will require 
no chemical treatments. 

Dry primary, secondary and tertiary crushing will be performed using jaw and cone 
crushers followed by autogenic crushing in a vertical shaft impactor (VSI) crusher.  
Subsequently, a liberation process using wet attrition scrubbers will be followed by 
particle size classification using density separators.  The final product will be dried, 
stored in separate size fractions (such as -40 +70 mesh and -70 +140 mesh), and 
then transported to the off-site load out facility. 

1 . 1 6  P R O J E C T  I N F R A S T R U C T U R E  

The project site will be accessed by an existing 70 km resource road leading from the 
BC Provincial Highway 77 crossing at the Fort Nelson River (where the proposed 
loadout facility will be located) (Figure 1.4), to a gas well site 5 km from the Liard 
River. 

The Project will require construction of a 5 km,two-lane roadway starting at the gas 
well site to reach the Liard River.  A single lane bridge (820 m) will be constructed to 
facilitate the river crossing.  The Project will then construct 127 km of new two-lane 
roadway complete with a 200 m crossing of the Beaver River and seven additional 
smaller (less than 40 m) water crossings to access the site. 

To supply the Project's energy requirements, a 127 km, natural gas supply pipeline 
will be installed during construction of the access road, and tapped into a main 
natural gas pipeline located near the Liard River crossing.  The pipeline will supply 
on-site natural gas turbines for electrical generation, provide site building heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) requirements, and provide any process heat 
requirements. 

To ensure security of the access road, and to limit access to the site, a security 
gatehouse will be constructed on the access road near the Liard River.  An additional 
gatehouse will be constructed at the mine site entrance.

At the mine site, the run-of-mine (ROM) stockpile, primary crushing facility and the 
primary stockpile will be placed near the center of the proposed pits. 

The main processing facility will house the following operations: 

 dry primary, secondary and tertiary crushing (jaw and cone crushers) 

 autogenic attrition crushing (VSI crusher) 

 wet attrition scrubbing

 separation facilities (i.e. particle size classification using density separators, 
wet product storage area) 

 drying facilities 

 warehouse and shop 

 change room, lunchroom and washrooms 

 boiler room and compressor room 

 product storage 

 product loadout 

The production by-product (tailings) from the processing plant will require disposal.  
The frac sand production process will result in tailings that comprise approximately 
40% (by weight) of the mined material.  The mine plan included the use of tailings to 
backfill mined pits and incorporates water reclaim to the plant.  As a result, there will 
be no external TMF. 

The staged pit development and sequential backfilling of pits benefits the mine from 
development to operations through to final closure. 

Other ancillary facilities at site include: 

 administration building with emergency response/medical clinic 

 camp 

 warehouse 

 truck shop and fuel station with truckwash and tire change station 

 solid waste disposal 

 power house with emergency power generator 

 security gatehouse.

Stikine plans to sell frac sand to the northeast BC market to meet the demands of oil 
and gas companies operating in the region. 

Currently, there are no developed sources of frac sand in northeast BC.  Oil and gas 
companies operating in the region must import frac sand from out-of-province 
locations such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the US. 

Stikine will have a competative advantage over current suppliers as their proximity to 
northeast BC shale basins will result in lower transportation and delivered frac sand 
costs compared with out-of-province suppliers.

As shale-gas projects continue to be developed in the Horn River and Montney 
Basins, the demand for frac sand is likely to increase significantly over the coming 
years.

1.18.1 ENVIRONMENT 

The Project involves two main elements, the mine site and access road.  The mine 
site includes multiple open pits and modest surface operation infrastructure. 

Preliminary project plans suggest that several watercourses will have to be spanned 
for this project, including major crossings at the Beaver River and the Liard River.  
The routing of the access road, crossing locations and crossing methods remain to 
be determined prior to understanding the potential effects of the access road. 

The construction and operation of an all-weather access road into an area that was 
previously accessible only during winter introduces the possibility of more wide-
spread effects on wildlife.  This brings the Project into a regional planning and 
assessment context that requires considerably more information on the regional 
wildlife populations in order to complete the Project environmental impact 
assessment (EIA).  The environmental assessment (EA) for the access road 
component of the Project will need to draw upon both the regional wildlife information 
compiled by the resource management agencies as well as project-specific wildlife 
studies.  In this case, the regional study information is only now developing and the 
project-specific information gaps cannot yet be clearly identified.  Stikine is now, and 
likely will need to continue, participating in these regional studies more than would 
typically be the case for a project of this size in order to ensure that adequate 
information is available to support their EIA.   

1.18.2 SOCIAL  CONSIDERATIONS 

Several First Nations are identified through the Government of British Columbia's 
interactive Consultative Areas Database as having interests encompassing Stikine's 
Nonda property and access road.  Most regard mining developments in a positive 
light.  However, there is a growing concern among some First Nations about the 
scale of development in the region and the cumulative impact of all natural resources 
development projects upon the environment.  Stikine has contracted an Aboriginal 
Relations Specialist for engagement with First Nations.  Consultations are ongoing, 
although the level and stages of negotiations is unknown.  No memorandums of 
understanding were reviewed and no data on Participation Agreements, Community 
Economic Benefit Agreements, or Accommodation Agreements was available for this 
PEA.

Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment 
of the Nonda Project, Northern BC 

  

 

Possible impacts to Project development from local First Nations include: 

 environmental concerns 

 impacts to aboriginal title and rights 

 general concerns and/or perceptions regarding over-development of mining 
in First Nations traditional territories 

 expectations regarding benefits 

 overlapping territories, disagreement between local First Nations over 
recognition of interests. 

1.18.3 PERMITT ING 

Federal, Provincial and other environmental permits and registrations that may be 
required for the Project are summarized in Section 20.0. 

Under the Canada-British Columbia Agreement on Environmental Assessment 
Cooperation, projects that require an EA by both the Government of Canada and the 
Government of British Columbia will undergo a single cooperative assessment 
process that meets the roles and obligations of both parties.  The access road and 
Liard River Bridge development required for this Project will likely result in those 
parts of the Project being subject to a Canadian Environmental Assessment (CEA) 
Agency Study in addition to addressing the requirements of the BC EA process.

An economic evaluation of the Nonda project was prepared by Wardrop based on a 
pre-tax financial model for the 25-year LOM and 1 Mt/a frac sand production.  The 
following pre-tax financial parameters were calculated for the base case: 

 25.9% Internal Rate of Return (IRR) 

 3.6 year payback on $665.5 million of initial capital 

 $1.2 billion Net Present Value (NPV) at 8% discount rate.

There are no known environmental liabilities attached to the property. 

4.6 P E R M I T S  

Prior to the commencement of any exploration work involving mechanical 
disturbance of the ground, an application must be filed and a permit received from 
the British Columbia Ministry of Environment (BCMOE).  Any proposed work 
involving significant exploration-related mechanical ground disturbance also requires 
the proponent to post with the Crown a reclamation security of an appropriate 
amount to cover the third-party costs of reclamation in the event of failure of the 
company to complete the reclamation work.  Stikine has provided a total reclamation 
security of $8,500 to the Crown that is held under permit MX-9-054.  A permit has 
been obtained from the BCMOE to drill up to an additional 12 diamond drillholes on 
the property. 

4.7 O T H E R  R E L E V A N T  F A C T O R S  

The property lies within a broad geographic area that is claimed to be the Traditional 
Territory of several First Nations. 

Some environmental baseline and archaeological studies have been completed; 
additional work is required for permitting purposes.

The property is not accessible by road; however, there are numerous overgrown 
seismic lines, oil/gas exploration, and logging roads south and east of the property.  
These trails could be upgraded and connected to form part of an access route linking 
the property to established all-season resource roads, located approximately 130 km 
east of the property.  These resource roads provide direct access to the HRB and 
Fort Nelson, located approximately 190 km southeast of the property. 

There are airstrips located within 50 to 70 km east, west and south of the property.  
These airstrips initially supported the 1942 construction of the Alaska Highway.

A weather station has been recently established, but has not yet collected a full year 
of data. 

Weather data collected at Fort Liard A-Station, NWT (approximately 85 km northeast 
from the site) between 1973 and 2011 indicate that January is the coldest month of 
the year, with a daily temperature averaging -22.5°C, and extremes ranging from 
9.5°C to -46.7°C.  July is the warmest month of the year, with daily temperature 
averaging 23.2°C and extremes ranging from 34.5°C to 2.0°C.  Total annual 
precipitation is 447.2 mm (107.9 mm of snow and 339.3 mm of rain).  The 
Hydrological Atlas of Canada indicates approximately 300 mm of annual pond 
evaporation for the area.

The nearest urban and industrial centre is Fort Nelson, 190 km southeast of the 
property.  Fort Nelson has a population of about 5,000, which includes a pool of 
professionals and technical/tradespeople.  Fort St. John is 387 km south of Fort 
Nelson, and has a population of approximately 19,000.  Both centres supply 
personnel and equipment to the oil and gas industry in northeast BC.

The property lies in the Liard Plateau physiographic region within the Northern Boreal 
Mountains Ecoprovince.  The Ghost Ridge claims of interest area covers a small part 
of the Caribou Range along the western edge of the Liard Plain Ecosection, which is 
a broad inter-mountain plain with a cold, sub-Arctic climate.  Elevation in the property 
ranges from approximately 1,040 to 1,640 m. 

The Ghost Ridge claims of interest area are alpine; vegetation consists of lichen, 
moss, grasses and buck brush with sparse stunted pine and spruce.  Vizer Creek 
and the treed valley that it occupies are situated 3 km west of Ghost Ridge claims of 
interest, and the headwaters of the Scatter River occur approximately 5 km to the 
east across another range.

There is no record of any mineral exploration or historical information regarding the 
mineral potential of the property before Stikine's initial reconnaissance of the 
property in July 2009.  Hickin et al. (2010) conducted a modest assessment of 
potential bedrock sources of frac sand in northeast BC, but the study focused on 
younger rock formations that occur to the southeast of the property. 

The region immediately east of the property has been the subject of limited oil and 
gas exploration.  There are numerous overgrown seismic lines, as well as a loose 
network of discontinuous exploration trails south, east, and northeast (in Yukon) of 
the property.  The road network provided access to drill sites to explore the 
hydrocarbon potential of rocks occurring higher in the stratigraphic section than the 
pre-Silurian rocks of the property.  The closest well to the property in BC is located 
32 km to the southeast and was drilled in 1964.  The closest well to the property in 
Yukon is located 26 km to the northeast and was drilled in 1971.  The level of interest 
in these old wells is not known. 

Stikine's initial July 2009 reconnaissance of the property identified a belt of pre-
Silurian (possibly Cambrian) quartz-pure sandstone or quartz arenite.  This work 
triggered the exploration programs discussed in this report.

7.1 R E G I O N A L  G E O L O G Y  

The region is covered by a succession of platformal clastic and carbonate 
sedimentary rocks of the lower Silurian Nonda Formation.  This unconformably 
overlies metamorphic basement rocks (Figure 7.1; Walsh 2004; Massey et al. 2005; 
Monahan 2002).  Both display a general north to northeast trend, and range from 
Silurian to Triassic in age. 

The rocks are folded into a series north-northeast trending anticline-syncline fold 
axes, and cut by a number of east-verging thrust faults (Walsh 2004; Massey et al. 
2005).  Older rocks are exposed in the eroded cores of these anticlines and on the 
hanging-walls of the thrust faults. 

Basement quartz arenites and quartzites are the target of current exploration and 
development.  They comprise a sequence of Cambrian metamorphic sandstones and 
shales. 

7.2 P R O P E R T Y  G E O L O G Y  

The property is underlain by Silurian to Triassic clastic and carbonate sedimentary 
rocks that display the regional north-northeast trend.  Cambrian quartz arenite and 
weakly-metamorphosed shale is well-exposed across the Ghost Ridge claims of 
interest area (Figure 7.2).  This sequence is informally referred to as the Vizer 
Formation. 

The Vizer Formation primarily comprises pale grey to bone-white quartz arenite, 
which crops-out along a rounded, subdued alpine plateau to the east of Vizer Creek.  
Total exposure length is approximately 11.5 km.  The apparent width of exposure is 
approximately 0.9 km.  Bedding is indistinct to locally well-developed, and dips 
shallowly (8 to 20°) to the west-northwest. 

The largest exposures occur in the central Ghost Ridge claims of interest area, 
cropping-out semi-continuously along a north-south direction over 5 km.  Several 
west-trending coulees provide continuous exposure over a width of more than 900 m 
and with a vertical distance of greater than 140 m.

The formation terminates abruptly north of the central Ghost Ridge claims of interest, 
possibly offset by later brittle faulting.  To the south, the quartz arenite becomes 
interbedded with a grey to black, weakly metamorphosed shale.  The quartz arenite 
is bound to the west by a steeply-dipping fault.  Rocks across the fault to the west 
consist of younger limestone, calcareous siltstone, and a tightly folded, interbedded 
sequence of quartz sandstone, siltstone, and shale. 

In hand sample, the quartz arenite is pale grey to white and visually pure and fine to 
medium grained.  At outcrop scale, the arenite is thin- to medium-bedded with 
bedding defined by variations in the colour and size of quartz grains.  Individual 
quartz grains are subangular to subrounded and impurities are rare.  Minor euhedral 
pyrite occurs locally and, where oxidized, imparts a pale orange stain that coats 
fractures and follows more porous and permeable beds.  Fracture density is low 
overall with local intervals of moderately to intensely fractured arenite. 

7.3 M I N E R A L I Z A T I O N  

The Vizer Formation quartz arenite is of interest as a potential source of frac sand.  
The quartz arenite comprises greater than 97% sub-angular to sub-rounded, tightly-
packed fine-grained quartz grains (Ross 2009).  Grains are dominantly single-crystal 
and detrital, commonly lacking overgrowths.  Strain is generally low, and contacts are 
smooth- to weakly-sutured.  Fine-grained polycrystalline quartz aggregates comprise 
1 to 5% of grains.  Impurities include up to 2% sericite.  Sericite occurs along the 
margins of quartz grains, contributing to the rock's tendency to break around grain 
boundaries rather than across grains.  Chlorite, iron oxide, pyrite, rutile, tourmaline, 
and zircon occur as trace interstitial grains.  Subsequent thin section petrographic 
analysis confirmed the mineralogy and established uniform quartz grain distribution 
(Le Couteur 2010a; 2010b).

Frac sand is a fine-grained, pure quartz material that is used for hydraulic fracturing 
(fracking) in some hydrocarbon wells.  Fracking is a technique used in the 
development of shale-hosted oil and gas deposits.  The process involves pumping 
water and proppant (commonly frac sand) at high-pressure into a well, fracturing the 
rock and supporting the fractures with the proppant.  This process improves the rock 
permeability, thereby enhancing hydrocarbon flow. 

Frac sand must comprise sized, fine-grained, pure quartz grains, which meet industry 
specifications for physical properties such as sphericity, roundness, and grain 
strength (American Petroleum Institute (API) RP19C, 2008/International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) 13503-2, 2006). 

Frac sands are sourced from three main deposit types: 

1. Unconsolidated sand, such as beach or desert sand.  These deposits 
require cleaning and size sorting, and the material can be collected with 
standard quarry/construction equipment. 

2. Semi-consolidated sandstone, such as poorly-cemented quartz arenite.  
These deposits are not 'hard' rocks and although they may require 
processing to separate individual quartz grains, it is minimal and grain 
breakage is not a significant concern.  Blasting may or may not be 
required to collect the material.  The best example of a sandstone 
formation that is semi-consolidated to consolidated, but not 
metamorphosed, and is mined for use as frac sand is the St. Peter 
Formation.  In commercial applications, this material is known as 
"Ottawa Sand" (Mossler and Benson 2006) and is locally mined in the 
US by a variety of producers (Zdunczyk 2007). 

3. Consolidated or metamorphosed sandstone, such as cemented quartz 
arenite or quartzite.  These rocks would always require blasting for 
collection and then crushing to separate individual quartz grains.  
Processing technique is an important consideration due to the possibility 
of grain breakage, which would reduce the number of grains meeting 
industry standards for frac sand.  An example of this type of deposit is 
the Minago frac sand deposit in Manitoba (Wardrop 2009). 

The Nonda deposit is a Type 3 deposit. 

Well production using fracking requires large quantities of frac sand; shipment of this 
sand to well sites can be a significant expense.  As an industrial mineral deposit, an

important component of evaluating the property as a potential frac sand deposit is 
proximity to the intended market – in this case the HRB.

The 2009 exploration program consisted of an initial reconnaissance assessment, 
bedrock mapping and sampling, and a follow-up diamond drilling exploration 
program.  The reconnaissance assessment was conducted in July 2009; its purpose 
was to verify and sample bedrock exposures for quartz-rich rock formations.  This 
initial evaluation identified a belt of quartz arenite more than 11 km long and 
approximately 0.9 km wide.  Several representative samples were collected and 
submitted for whole rock geochemical analysis and petrographic examination.  
Positive laboratory results led to a late summer/early fall diamond drilling program 
(see Section 10.0) during which nine drillholes were completed (Figure 9.1).  Three 
large samples taken in 2009 (approximately 500 kg each) of quartz arenite were 
collected from outcrop (samples T09-01, T09-02 and T09-03, in Figure 9.1).  These 
samples were collected for test processing; the results are discussed in Section 13.0. 

In 2010, 430 t of quartz arenite was collected from the central Ghost Ridge claims of 
interest by drilling and blasting.  The star-shaped marker in Figure 7.2 indicates the 
location of this sample.  The quartz arenite was divided into 37 individual batches, 
and representative samples from each batch were submitted for petrographic and 
geochemical analysis.  These results were compiled with those from 2009 core 
drilling and are presented in Section 10.0.  The individual batches were stockpiled in 
one large pile and temporarily stored in a secure yard near the Alaska Highway.  In 
early October 2010, this material was shipped to a custom pilot plant in Abbotsford, 
BC, for processing.  Additional bedrock mapping was also conducted in 2010 to 
better define the extent of the quartz arenite unit.

Stikine contracted Hy-Tech Drilling Ltd. in the fall of 2009 to complete nine HQ 
diameter drillholes, collecting 934 m of drillcore.  The program was supported by 
helicopter from the Northern Rockies Lodge at Muncho Lake; an abandoned airstrip 
located east of Liard Hot Springs was used as an equipment staging area.  Drilling 
began on September 13 and was completed on October 9.  Three 3-hole fences 
were drilled over an area approximately 2.2 km long by 0.9 km wide.  With the 
exception of GR09-01 (shown in Table 10.1), all holes were drilled vertically.  All 
holes were drilled on the Ghost Ridge claims of interest area (Table 10.1; Figure 9.1) 
with hole lengths varying from 70 to 168 m.  Each drillhole was collared and 
terminated in quartz arenite, so the total hole length represents the minimum 
thickness of quartz arenite at that location.

One approximately 2 m thick bed of siltstone was encountered around 132 m depth 
in drillhole GR09-06 (corresponding to sample 0906006P, Table 10.2, and sample 
0906006G, Table 10.3).  The absence of siltstone beds in the other drillholes 
indicates a local distribution of this bed; no other lithologies were encountered.

conducted on 41 drillcore samples (Table 10.3).  The average silica content of the 
quartz arenite is 98.16% SiO2 within a typical range of 95.40 to 99.18% SiO2 (Table 
10.3; the anomalous value for sample 0906006G represents a rare siltstone bed and 
was removed for average calculations).  The average iron oxide (Fe2O3) content is 
0.41% with two samples exceeding 2.20%.  The only other major oxide of note was 
aluminum oxide (Al2O3), which averaged 0.59%.  Trace element analyses showed 
anomalous lead values in three samples (ranging from 242 to 895 ppm) and 
consistently elevated chromium values (ranging from 66 to 227 ppm).

Stikine geologists conducted all core logging.  Drillcores were systematically logged 
on-site during the drilling program.  Core logs recorded lithology, core recovery and 
rock quality designation (RQD).  Representative samples of core were collected from 
each drillhole at intervals of approximately 20 to 30 m.  This sample spacing was 
chosen based on the observed homogeneity of the quartz arenite.  Most samples 
were approximately 1 m long but variable up to 2.65 m (drillhole GR09-01).  All 
samples were divided into three sub-samples: one sub-sample was submitted for 
petrographic examination (Table 10.2); one sub-sample was submitted for whole 
rock and trace element geochemical analysis (Table 10.3); and one sub-sample was 
retained as a representative sample for future use.  A total of 41 samples were 
submitted for petrographic analysis and 40 for whole rock geochemical analysis. 

SG samples consisting of small segments of whole core were selected from each 
drillhole.  AcmeLabs analyzed the SG samples using a wet-dry method.  A total of 
21 SG samples were collected (Table 10.4).  Two samples were collected from each 
drillhole, except for drillhole GR09-06, from which five samples were collected.  
Samples were selected to represent any variation observed in the quartz arenite. 

Three large (500 kg) surface samples (T09-01, T09-02 and T09-03; Figure 9.1) were 
collected from outcrop using sledge hammers and chisels.  The quartz grains 
obtained from this processing was compared with industry standard to evaluate if the 
product would be suitable for use as frac sand. 

A 430 t sample was collected in 2010 for process testing at a pilot plant in 
Abbotsford, BC.  The sample was obtained from within the Ghost Ridge claims of 
interest area by drilling/blasting of the quartz arenite.

All surface samples and drillcore samples collected in 2009 were packed in thick poly 
bags and labelled with a unique sample number.  Each poly bag was secured with a 
zap strap.  All samples were then placed into rice bags, also secured with zap straps, 
and flown by helicopter to the base in Muncho Lake.  These samples were then 
transported in a private vehicle accompanied by Stikine's consultant, Robert Lane, 
P.Geo. of Plateau Minerals, to Prince George, BC, where they were temporarily

housed in a locked, private garage prior to shipping.  These procedures do not follow 
industry standard chain of custody practices, but because these samples were not 
assayed and cannot be reasonably tampered with to increase grade, the procedure 
is not considered problematic for this Project.  Drillcore samples were then 
transported via commercial courier to either the Inspectorate-IPL laboratory in 
Richmond, BC (geochemical analysis), AcmeLabs in Vancouver, BC (SG analysis), 
or Vancouver Petrographics Ltd. in Langley, BC (thin section preparation).  The three 
500 kg surface rock samples were trucked by commercial carrier to SGS 
Laboratories in Vancouver, BC. 

Samples analyzed for whole-rock geochemistry at Inspectorate-IPL were initially jaw-
crushed until 70% passed through a -10 mesh (2 mm) screen, and each sample was 
split.  A 250 g riffle split sample was pulverized in a mild-steel ring-and-puck mill until 
95% passed through a 150 mesh (100 µm) screen.  The resulting sample pulp was 
analyzed for major oxides by XRF and for 30 elements by four acid ICP-MS.  The 
remaining coarse reject portions of the samples remain in storage at the labs. 

AcmeLabs conducts its own internal quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), as all 
accredited and certified laboratories are required to do.  The supplied data was 
reviewed and it appears that lab repeats were run; however, there is no evidence 
that unidentifiable field or pulp duplicates, blanks, or standards were submitted. 

Thin sections sent to Vancouver Petrographics Ltd. were prepared according to 
standard industry procedures.  The thin sections were analyzed by Le Couteur 
(2010a; 2010b). 

AcmeLabs analyzed the SG samples using an industry-standard water displacement 
method in which the core was first dried at 105°C and then allowed to cool.  The 
samples of core were weighed in air and then submerged in a container of water.  
Measurement of the mass of the immersed sample was used to calculate SG 
(density compared to water).

Wardrop verified electronic assay laboratory data sheets in PDF format.  Samples 
were tested for whole rock composition, trace elements, and SG.  Additionally, thin 
sections were created for selected samples.  The thin section interpretation was 
meant to define the grain size distribution in lieu of a grade identifier. 

Currently, no information about the "grade" of the deposit exists that would evaluate 
the percentage of usable grains, as defined by frac sand specifications, to the 
percentage of rock material not satisfying those specifications. 

No standards, duplicates, blanks or other QA/QC reference materials were submitted 
to the laboratory with the data stream. 

Klaus Triebel, CPG, visited the property on June 9, 2011.  The visit focused on the 
Ghost Ridge claims of interest area of the property, where it was confirmed that 
quartz arenite crops out at surface.  This quartz arenite was macroscopically uniform 
across the area visited, with thin sedimentary beds visible at all locations.  Quartz 
arenite was not confirmed in other areas of the property during the visit.  The blast 
site location was visited, from which the 430 t sample was collected in 2010.  Quartz 
arenite at this location was also observed to be quartz-rich and uniform in 
composition.  Drillcore was not examined during the site visit because the core 
storage locale was buried in a deep snowdrift.  Drillhole collars were seen and 
documented and some HQ core remnants were found in the vicinity of the drill 
collars.  Four of the nine drill collars were visited, and GPS readings were recorded 
at each collar.  These coordinates were compared with the coordinates provided by 
Stikine (Table 10.1), and all values were within accepted GPS accuracy (±5 m).  
Since the presence of the arenite could visually be established over large distances, 
no field check samples were collected during the site visit.

The process flowsheet for this plant is based on ongoing bench-scale test work, 
conducted by Met-Solve, in Langley, BC, and at a pilot plant located in Abbotsford, 
BC.  The process included crushing, attrition scrubbing, and size separation.  
Material testing involved processing sandstone into specifically-sized frac sand 
products.  Table 13.1 outlines the relevant frac sand products in mesh sizes.

guidelines for the physical and chemical characteristics of the sand. 

13.2 R E S U L T S  

All test results presented in Table 13.3 and Table 13.4 are based on material 
supplied directly to the testing laboratory by Stikine.  Pilot plant scale tests are based 
on blast rock material received at the pilot plant.  No mixing or blending of the sample 
was done prior to feeding to the pilot plant.  Variations in characteristics of the feed 
material may generate variations in the overall product yield and the yield into the 
individual size fractions. 

Based on the findings from the pilot plant, a total yield of all commercial frac sand 
sizes ranged from 54 to 66%, and averaged 60%. 

The yield range and average yields for the individual size fractions are shown in 
Table 13.2.

The pilot plant has consistently made a 70/140 mesh product that meets or exceeds 
API RP19C/IS 13503-2 evaluations and recommended specifications.  This was 
achieved with minimal scrubbing retention time in the pilot plant and lab testing of 
this size fraction.  The 40/70 mesh and 20/40 mesh products produced by the pilot 
plant have been outside the recommended crush test specifications by small 
margins.  Tests with different scrubber designs at lab scale indicated that the three 
scrubbers initially used in the pilot plant are likely less efficient than other available 
scrubbers.  The use of more efficient scrubbers and/or greater retention time may 
produce a product where all three size fractions pass the API crush guidelines.

14.1 A S S U M P T I O N S  A N D  M E T H O D O L O G Y  

To estimate the potential extent and tonnage of the quartz arenite mineral resource, 
information was incorporated from three areas, as described in the following sub-
sections. 

14.1.1 BEDROCK MAPPING 

The primary tool employed to determine the strike length and lateral extent of the 
Vizer Formation in the Ghost Ridge claims of interest area of the property was 
bedrock mapping.  This work was undertaken by a Stikine geologist during the 2009 
and 2010 exploration field seasons.  Bedrock mapping of the Ghost Ridge area 
revealed that quartz arenite is visually homogeneous and is almost continuously well-
exposed over more than 11.5 km of its strike length and more than 0.9 km of its 
exposed width, of which the immediate area of the drilling (approximately 2 km along 
strike) was visited and verified by Wardrop. 

Bedrock mapping established surface continuity of the quartz arenite between and 
beyond the drillhole collar locations.  Quartz arenite outcrops well north of the most 
northerly and well south of the most southerly drillhole fences.  Quartz arenite 
outcrops more than 100 m west of the most westerly drillholes, but beyond that, the 
Formation is truncated by a north-trending fault.  East of the most easterly drillholes, 
quartzite arenite outcrops for more than 100 m before extending beneath 
conglomerate, sandstone and limestone of the Silurian Nonda Formation. 

14.1.2 DIAMOND DRILL ING 

Because of the semi-continuous surface exposure and the visual homogeneity of the 
quartz arenite the deposit can be characterized by relatively few drillholes.  Nine HQ-
diameter diamond drillholes were completed along three fences of three holes each.  
These established a minimum lateral extension of the quartz arenite of 2.2 km along 
strike and 0.9 km along dip.  The distance between drillholes averaged 
approximately 1,100 m in a northerly direction and 400 m in a westerly direction.  
Drilling confirmed the overall homogeneous distribution of the quartz arenite over drill 
depths ranging from 70 to 168 m, none of which penetrated the underlying formation.  
The thickness data constraining the wireframe model by drillhole is presented in 
Table 10.1.  The area of influence of the perimeter holes does not extend more than 
100 m beyond the area drilled.  Drillcore was systematically spot sampled for whole 
rock, trace element, petrographic, and SG analyses.

14.1.3 ESTIMATION 

Resource estimation was conducted within a wireframe provided by Stikine, 
representing a rock volume defined by drilling that constituted a flat-lying slab.  The 
geological wire-frame model was generated using Gemcom Surpac™ Version 6.1.3 
software (Table 14.1).

The upper limit of this volume is determined from geo-referenced ArcGIS files 
purchased from the Crown Registry and Geographic Base Section of the British 
Columbia Ministry of Agriculture and Lands.  Digital elevation model (DEM) data was 
used to represent the surface topography of the area drilled. 

The bottom of this slab was defined by the drillhole lengths drilled within this 
package.  Drillhole collars were located using hand-held Garmin GPS units and were 
accurate to within 5 m.  All of the data is in metric units, and North American Datum 
(NAD) 87 is used as the datum.  While this level of GPS accuracy will introduce error 
into the area calculations, the level of error is thought to be insignificant given the 
bulk tonnage nature of the deposit.

The lateral extension of the slab extended 100 m beyond the drillhole collars. 

Wardrop verified the wireframe extensions and agrees with its total volume. 

The mineral resource was estimated as follows: 

1. The gross volume for the resource area was calculated by multiplying the 
net area by the thickness of the unit (using the vertical distances of each 
drillhole), giving a volume of 256,907,000 m3. 

2. A SG of 2.734 was applied, providing a total resource of 702,400 kt. 

3. A reduction in resource of 5% was applied to the Inferred Resource to 
account for the possible presence of anomalies not detected by existing 
drillholes, such as non-quartz arenite interburdens.  As mentioned earlier, 
one such narrow interval of siltstone interburden was encountered in 
drillhole GR09-06.  The quartz arenite is exposed semi-continuously over 
the resource area and no stripping of overburden is required.  Removal of 
oxidized bedrock is not applicable.  This reduction results in a subtraction of 
35,119 kt from the total. 

4. SG determinations on 21 pieces of drillcore yielded a mean average of 2.734.  
However, an additional resource  reduction of 6% was applied because it is 
likely that the mean average SG of 2.734 is an overestimate.  This reduction 
factor was calculated (rounded) by dividing the lowest SG determination 
(2.5636) by the mean average (2.734) and multiplying by 100.  This reduction 
results in a subtraction of 42,143 kt from the total. 

Total adjusted resource is therefore estimated to be 89% of the Inferred Mineral 
Resource of the property.  This number is the sum of all loss items 3 and 4 (5% and 
6%, respectively) subtracted from 100%.  An additional reduction is possible to 
account for the currently unknown percentage of usable grains. 

14.2 M I N E R A L  R E S O U R C E S  

In Wardrop's opinion, the data provides sufficient basis for the estimation of an 
Inferred Mineral Resource for the drilled portion of the central Ghost Ridge area on 
the property and amounts to 702.4 Mt of raw, unprocessed quartz arenite. 

The Inferred Resource was calculated by applying the reductions described in 
Section 14.1 to the raw tonnage figure.  The total reduction in tonnage is at least 
77.3 Mt.  Table 14.1 presents the Inferred Mineral Resource based on the average 
thickness for the nine drillholes that were completed by Stikine on the Ghost Ridge 
area of the property.  After applying the tonnage reduction, the maximum tonnage is 
estimated at 625.1 Mt.

14.3 A D D I T I O N A L  C R I T E R I A  F O R  I N D U S T R I A L  M I N E R A L S  

Frac sand is a commodity that is used extensively in the development of modern 
non-traditional sources of hydrocarbons, such as shale-hosted oil and gas deposits, 
as a proppant during hydraulic fracturing (fracking) of the host formations.  It is 
valuable in the fracking industry because of its crush resistance under high pressures 
and its inert (non-reactive) chemical properties. 

Quartz sandstone, quartz arenite and/or quartzite are potential sources of frac sand.  
The economic development of a source of frac sand is a function of market and 
mining profitability (including transport distance), as well as the tonnage of source 
material, its characteristics and ability to be processed. 

In assessing the frac sand potential of the Ghost Ridge claims of interest of the 
property, it is recognized that there is a viable market for the commodity in a number 
of nearby developing unconventional shale-gas basins in northeast BC, particularly 
the HRB.  The proximity of the market source, in keeping transport distances as low 
as possible, is a key factor in the economic potential of the property.

16.1 I N T R O D U C T I O N  

The mining is developed based on Stikine's plan to produce 1 Mt/a of frac sand over 
the 25-year LOM. 

The deposit will be mined using an open pit mining method, aligning 10 open pits 
along the ridge of the deposit.  Material will be mined and processed sequentially; 
each successive open pit will be mined to dimensions that allow for progressive 
backfilling of tailings into the previously mined pits.  A separate TMF will not be 
required, because all tailings generated over the LOM will be stored in the mined 
pits. 

A starter pit will be excavated to provide initial tailings storage capacity.  Rock from 
this starter pit will be placed in an adjacent stockpile for later processing.  Some of 
this excavated rock may be crushed and utilized for haul road, processing plant, 
ancillary building and parking area construction. 

Pits 2 through 9 will be mined at a rate of 1.67 Mt/a, which, at a yield of 60%, will 
produce 1.00 Mt/a of saleable product.  The starter pit will be mined at an 
accelerated rate of 2.73 Mt/a, in order to achieve an excavation time of one year.  
After each pit is filled to design capacity, it will be capped with rock from the 
stockpile. 

16.2 M I N I N G  M E T H O D  

The deposit will be mined using conventional open pit drilling and blasting 
techniques, including the use of ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) explosives.  
Blasted rock will be loaded and hauled with conventional mine loaders and haul 
trucks.  Material will be hauled from the pit to the crusher, the ROM stockpile, or the 
stockpile.  Ancillary equipment will include a bulldozer, a grader, a dust suppression 
unit, an explosives loading truck, and service and utility vehicles.

16.3 O P E N  P I T  E V A L U A T I O N  

16.3.1 RESOURCE EXTRACTION 

A 1 Mm3 starter pit with an extracted tonnage of 2.734 Mt was selected.  Processing 
will commence using rock excavated from the second pit after excavation of the first 
pit is completed.  Tailings from the processing facility will be directed to the starter 
pit. 

16.3.2 MINE DESIGN CRITERIA  –  OPTIMIZATION INPUTS 

All excavated rock will be sent to the mill for processing.  Pit dimensions were 
optimized based on a balanced cut-and-fill approach. 

The criteria used to determine the dimension of each succeeding pit included the 
ratio of excavated rock and tailings densities, multiplied by the tonnes mined, minus 
the product yield and the freeboard allowance. 

16.3.3 PIT  OPTIMIZATION METHODOLOGY 

The area of interest features a rounded topography, with a 20 m difference in 
elevation from the crest to the sides within the area.  Consequently, since the tailings 
will be in slurry form, it will only be possible to backfill the excavated pits to the lowest 
elevation.  In order to establish how much of the excavated pit can be backfilled, a 
backfill capacity factor was derived by performing trial pit designs in 
Gemcom Surpac™, using the topography model supplied by EBA. 

There are gullies on either side of the 1,360 m surface contour so this contour was 
used as a limit to the width of each pit. 

Wardrop found that increasing the pit volume of each successive pit by a factor of 
1.05 to 1.15 was sufficient to match mining volume-to-tailings storage requirements.  
This factor was based on a rock density of 2.734 t/m3, a product yield of 60%, a 
tailings settled dry density of 1.5 t/m3 and a backfill capacity factor of 80%. 

Table 16.1 shows the totals for the pit optimization calculation.

16.3.4 PIT  SHAPE DIMENSIONS 

Each pit will have a base width of 50 m, a base length of 250 to 325 m, an overall 
slope of 45° and a 20 m wide ramp at a gradient of 1:10.  Pit depths will vary from 
approximately 40 to 65 m.  The depths of these pits was optimised by calculation 
taking into account the cut-to-fill balance, the length and width of each pit and the 
haul distances.  The overall length and width of each pit will be limited by the base 
width, the calculated incremental pit size, the 1,360 m contour and a 20 m wide ramp 
with one main bend. 

Wardrop calculated the pit dimensions for each pit increment, based on the results of 
the pit optimization.  The pit dimensions were then used to create simple designs in 
Gemcom Surpac™.  The tonnage calculated in Gemcom Surpac™ was then 
compared against Wardrop's tonnage calculations to ensure the calculated 
dimensions were within an acceptable tolerance of the designs. 

The number of pits was limited to 10 in order to accommodate them within the mining 
area bounded by the 1,360 m contour.  The smallest will be Pit 1, located at the north 
end of the mining area.  The north end of the mining area is relatively flat, allowing 
for the best combination of excavation and backfill. 

16.3.5 ILLUSTRATION OF RESOURCE AND PIT  SHAPES 

Rock from the starter pit will be hauled to the stockpile.  The stockpile will be 10 m 
high, and located adjacent to the starter pit, on the east side, in a naturally depressed 
location.  The base of the dump will follow the natural contours. 

Rock from Pit 2 will be hauled to the processing plant, and the tailings from the 
processing plant will be returned to the starter pit.  Once the starter pit is backfilled, it 
will be capped with rock from the stockpile.  This sequence of mining, backfilling and 
capping will be repeated for subsequent pits.  The final pit will remain open for 
subsequent expansion, or if deemed complete, capped.  The position of the pits 
maximizes the backfill capacity factor by adhering to the natural ridge as much as 
possible. 

The processing plant will be located centrally to all the pits, ensuring that haul 
distances remain similar throughout the LOM.  The layout of the pits, stockpile, haul 
roads and ROM pad is shown in Figure 16.1.

16.5.1 MATERIAL  CLASSIF ICATION 

The host rock is predominately quartz arenite and is very low in sulphides, therefore, 
for the purpose of this study, the rock is assumed to be non-acid generating (NAG).  
Wardrop recommends future investigations to confirm the geochemistry of the rock. 

16.5.2 PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 

The production schedule assumes a limited ramp-up period.  The LOM is 25 years, 
excluding pre-production and restoration of the site at closure (Table 16.2).

Wardrop has assumed that blasting services will be assigned to the mining 
contractor or a specialist blasting company.  It will be important to ensure optimum 
fragmentation of the rock to suit the processing plant and product specifications.  
Typical blasting parameters are outlined in Table 16.4. 

Table 16.4 Blasting Parameters for Production Blast Holes 

Description Value 

Explosive Density 0.75 g/cm3 

Powder Factor 0.18 kg/t 

Powder Length 8.45 m 

Powder per Hole 77.7 kg 

Stemming Height 2.56 m 

 

Kuz-Ram fragmentation analysis was conducted using these blast specifications 
(Figure 16.2).  The anticipated feed size for the crusher is 0.80 m.  Approximately 
96% of the rock passes 0.80 m. 

Figure 16.2 Kuz-Ram Fragmentation Analysis of Blasted Material 

 

16.7.3 LOADING AND HAULING 

The mine plan includes the following equipment: 

 one 7 m3  front end loader (FEL) (CAT 988H)

of the Nonda Project, Northern BC 

  

 

 three to four 56 t rigid dump trucks (RDTs) (CAT 773) 

 stockpile loader (CAT 950H) 

Smaller loaders and matched trucks could be considered to compensate for a 
disruption, such as the breakdown of a single major loader.  Smaller loaders and 
trucks could also be mobilized to facilitate emergency road repair should a road 
failure occur. 

16.7.4 SURFACE STOCKPILES 

The rock will be directly loaded into the processing plant crusher hopper, but there 
will be a need for a ROM stockpile to allow for stoppages, and possibly some 
blending.  A smaller FEL (CAT 950H) has been included in the cost for this purpose. 

16.8 M I N E  S E R V I C E S  

16.8.1 PIT  DEWATERING 

The area experiences approximately 450 mm of precipitation annually.  Drainage 
ditches must be established and maintained as the open pits develop.  Snow thaw in 
the spring will require additional pumping and drainage capacity.  As each pit is 
bottomed out, backfilling with tailings will commence based on the cut-and-fill 
balance. 

A pumping allowance of 100 m3/d for pit dewatering was made; excess drainage 
water from the active pit will be delivered to the active tailings area. 

16.8.2 DUST SUPPRESSION 

A tandem highway truck modified with a water tank will be used for dust suppression.  
Water required for dust allaying purposes on the haul roads and at the loading areas 
and stock piles will be obtained from water from the open pit. 

Water refilling stations/goosenecks will be situated at the sump in the open pit, and 
on surface at a take-off point from the pit-dewatering pipeline.  Supplementary water 
will be obtained from the surface water control ponds/tanks situated near the 
processing plant. 

16.8.3 STOCKPILE CONSTRUCTION AND ROAD MAINTENANCE 

For stockpile construction and road maintenance, one bulldozer, such as a CAT D8T, 
and one motor grader, such as a CAT 14M, will be sufficient.  In addition, a 
snowplow/sander, such as a 10 to 15 t tandem truck, will be required during the 
winter months.

16.9 M I N I N G  E Q U I P M E N T  

For this scale of mining, equipment was selected to match the mine production 
schedule, with two crews working 10-hour shifts, 7 d/wk, for 52 wk/a. 

Equipment selection, sizing and fleet requirements were based on expected typical 
operating conditions, haulage profiles, production cycle times, mechanical 
availability, utilization and operator efficiency.  An overall utilization of 68% of 
scheduled hours has been estimated to derive the productive hours.  To determine 
the number of units for each equipment type (drills, shovels, trucks, etc.), annual 
operating hours were calculated and compared to the available annual equipment 
hours. 

Mobile support equipment such as a FEL, dozer, grader, water and fuel trucks were 
matched with the major mining units. 

A mine equipment fleet typical for this size of operation is listed in Table 16.5.

The mine will operate 20 h/d, 7 d/wk, on a 3 week-on/1 week-off rotation system for 
all.  Each employee will work 1,700 hours per year.  This conservative estimate 
allows for contingencies.

The internal roads intended for haul truck traffic will have a minimum running surface 
of 16 m; ramps will have a width of 20 m to accommodate a safety berm.  The 
running surface of the roadways will allow for two-way tramming, with an additional 
half-truck-width allowance for truck separation.  The haul ramps will have a maximum 
gradient of 10%. 

The haul roads will be maintained with mine auxiliary equipment to maximize safe 
haulage speeds, improve production and reduce maintenance costs.

Wardrop assumed that all mining activities will be conducted by contractors.  The 
cost of the starter pit, based on contractors' unit rates has been calculated as 
$18.7 million.  The total preproduction CAPEX for the starter pit is estimated to be 
$21.6 million (Table 16.7).  The contractor's rate includes all mobile equipment,

During the final year of processing, no rock will be excavated from the pit and supply 
of the 1.67 Mt of mill feed will be reclaimed from the stockpile.  The cost of this will be 
reduced to $8.98/t as there will no requirement for drilling and blasting.

17.1 S U M M A R Y  

The overall objective of the processing plant will be to liberate sandstone into 
specifically sized frac sand.  No specific size reduction or manufacture of grain sizes 
is required; the grain size of most of the sand within the raw material meets 
commercial size requirements. 

The proposed process will be entirely mechanical, and will require no chemical 
treatments, additions, or special material handling. 

The process plant will involve dry and wet processing components.  Typical primary, 
secondary, and tertiary crushing will be performed dry, using jaw and cone crushers 
followed by autogenic crushing in a VSI crusher.  Subsequent to that, a wet liberation 
process using attrition scrubbers will be followed by particle size classification using 
density separators.  All final product sizes will be dried, stored, and then shipped off-
site. 

The various crushing stages will effectively reduce the size of the material to as small 
as possible without damaging the constituent sand grains.  The product will be 
beneficiated into individual grains in the two attrition stages. 

The process will require water to effect attrition in scrubbing, pumpability and 
classification.  Process water will also transport a tailings stream of undersize and/or 
broken grains of sand to the tailings/settling pond.  Since no chemicals will be added 
and no metal loading will occur in the tailings stream, it is assumed that 100% of the 
process water (reduced by evaporation and losses in the ponds) can be reused in 
the process. 

A simplified process flowsheet is provided in Figure 17.1.

17.2 P L A N T  D E S I G N  

The plant design will be based on a production rate of 1 Mt/a of sized frac sand 
products, assuming a throughput rate of 1.67 Mt/a (220 t/h at 92% plant availability).  
The plant will operate 24 h/d, 365 d/a.  The plant design and cost estimates take into 
account year-around operations in sub-zero temperatures and northern BC winter 
conditions.  The plant design is based on particle size distribution and pilot plant data 
provided by Met-Solve.  Sepro assumed this data was correct. 

For the purpose of this report, only the unit processes used in the pilot plant were 
used in the design of the plant.

17.3.1 PRIMARY/SECONDARY CRUSHING 

The primary/secondary crushing circuit was designed to reduce the sandstone to 
manageable sizes for the autogenic crushing and attrition scrubbing, without causing 
damage to the individual grains within the rock. 

The 800 mm ROM material will be crushed in the primary jaw at a setting of 130 mm, 
and then conveyed to a primary stockpile.  The coarse material will then be 
reclaimed by a reclaim tunnel from beneath the primary stockpile, and then conveyed 



 

 

 Stikine Energy Corp. 17-5 1192020100-REP-R0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment 
of the Nonda Project, Northern BC 

  

 

to the secondary cone crusher with a closed-side setting of 19 mm.  The coarse 
material will then be conveyed to a tertiary cone crusher and crushed at a setting of 
12 mm.  A -10 mm coarse product will be produced at the conclusion of this circuit. 

17.3.2 COARSE PRODUCT STOCKPILE AND RECLAIM 

The -10 mm coarse product will be conveyed to a 5,000 t coarse product stockpile, 
and then transported out of the stockpile via a reclaim tunnel into two feed hoppers. 

17.3.3 AUTOGENIC CRUSHING  

The VSI crushers will liberate the particle grains from the sandstone matrix using 
autogenic or rock-on-rock crushing and attrition.  This will maximize product 
beneficiation while minimizing the risk of breaking existing grains. 

The two feed hoppers will split the material stream into two separate but identical 
crushing lines, each utilizing a VSI crusher in a closed circuit, to produce 0.84 mm 
product. 

17.3.4 ATTRIT ION SCRUBBING 

The attrition scrubbers will provide further product beneficiation by causing further 
grain disaggregation and by removing surface residues. 

The attrition circuit will receive the -0.84 mm product and retain it for 45 minutes; the 
feed slurry will be pumped to cyclones for dewatering, and then fed to the scrubbers 
at the required density of 65% solids.  The scrubbed material will then be pumped to 
the classification equipment. 

17.3.5 CLASSIF ICATION 

The classification process will separate the sand into the desired particle size 
fractions. 

The slurry pumped from the attrition process will be dewatered with cyclones, and 
will report to two 8 x 16 ft density separators set to cut at 70 mesh.  The underflow 
will report to two 10 x 10 ft density separators, which will cut the -70 mesh stream at 
140 mesh, with the overflow reporting to tails and the underflow reporting to the 
70/140 mesh product stockpile.  The underflow of the two 8 x 16 ft density separators 
is pumped to a 7 x 7 ft density separator, which separates the 20/70 mesh stream at 
40 mesh, with the overflow reporting to the 40/70 mesh product stockpile and the 
underflow to the 20/40 mesh product stockpile.

of the Nonda Project, Northern BC 

  

 

17.3.6 DRYING AND LOADING 

The products will be loaded onto a conveyor leading to the fluidised heat bed dryer.  
The dried material will then be conveyed to four 500 t silos (one for 20/40 mesh 
sand, one for 40/70 mesh sand, and two for 70/140 mesh sand).  Each silo will feed 
its own truck-loading bay that will include a scale and tally system connected to a 
central computer and accounting system. 

17.3.7 DUST SUPPRESSION 

Fine silica dust must be collected and prevented from being released to the 
environment. 

All process plant areas will be housed within insulated buildings.  Covered screens 
will be installed in the secondary and tertiary crushing buildings.  Rubber trips will 
shield all conveyor transfer, exit and entry points.  A dust extraction system will be 
installed in the screen feed and crusher feed, and their associated discharge chutes.  
Conveyors between these crushing plants will be installed inside tunnels with dust 
collection ducts and suction outlets. 

Access to the coarse product stockpile building will be limited when the plant is 
operating, as it will be difficult to prevent dust emissions within the building. 

The autogenic crushing circuit, attrition scrubbing, classification, dewatering screens 
and transfer conveyors will all be wet processes.  Dust suppression in the product 
storage areas is not expected to be required, but hoods above the reclaim chute will 
be considered if necessary. 

The conveyor leading to the dryer will be housed in an insulated tunnel; suction ducts 
will be installed if required.  The dryer will be equipped with an integrated baghouse 
dust collector.  The polishing screens will be fitted with covers with integrated suction 
ducts.  The receiving hopper at the loading station and the product silos will be fitted 
with covers.  The conveyors from the receiving hopper to the product silo will be 
inside a heated tunnel with incorporated suction outlets. 

The loading equipment is equipped with dust management equipment. 

17.3.8 MASS BALANCE AND WATER USAGE 

The process plant requires a total of approximately 1,150 m3/h of which 525 m3/h is 
clean or well clarified water to feed the density separators.  The density separators 
require this volume to maintain the rising current required for the classification of 
particles. 

The process can utilize reclaimed water from the TMF with only a portion of the 
volume required to be "clean" for use in the density separators.  All other water use in 
the plant can tolerate levels of suspended solids not ordinarily an option in

conventional mining/milling locations.  A fresh water requirement of 10% or 115 m3/h 
is expected due to evaporative losses in the drying process and other areas.

18.2 R O A D S  

A proposed new 132 km road will provide general mine access, and a route for 
transporting processed product to a storage facility at Highway 77, near the Fort 
Nelson River.  This two-lane gravel road will be designed to accommodate year-
round B-Train traffic subject to seasonal load restrictions. 

The route will commence within 5 km of the east side of the Liard River.  Stationing 
for the Project starts at the west side of Liard River at km 0, and ends at the mine site 
located at approximately km 127.  The existing road network (Patry Mainline) that 
this road connects to has not yet been assessed. 

The topography varies from flat to hilly with approximately 30% of the route with 
grades over 3%.  Most of the road grades will be in the order of 0 to 8% although 
there are areas where the slope of the natural groundline is as high as 17%.  These 
areas of steep gradients will need to be reduced by means of traditional cut and fill 
techniques or realignment. 

Nine bridge structures will be required to span creeks and rivers.  The majority of 
these bridges will be single spans, 20 to 40 m long.  There will be two significant 
bridge crossings: Beaver River (200 m) and Liard River (820 m). 

Wardrop has not conducted any field assessment for the road route.  The route 
feasibility and costs have been based on the following base data, which is only 
considered adequate for a high-level overview.  Additional information will be 
required to confirm the route feasibility and costs. 

 BC Trim Data: 

 Trim Data containing 20 m contours, in Arc Shape (base map) ZIP 
format, outlined the roads, water, cut lines, seismic lines, rivers, islands, 
swamps, marshes, and cut blocks

18.2.2 DESIGN PRINCIPLES 

ROUTING 

The overall alignment corridor was provided by Stikine.  EBA reviewed this route for 
general feasibility and made modifications to it to avoid geotechnical hazards and 
steep road gradients.  Additional minor modifications to the alignment are expected 
as more detailed topography becomes available.  Based on the existing topography, 
these modifications could increase the length of the road by approximately two 
kilometers. 

The Liard River crossing and road alignment connecting to the Patry Mainline on the 
east side of the river may need to be reviewed with respect to potential geotechnical 
hazards.  At present, insufficient information is available to adequately ascertain the 
geotechnical hazards that may be present on the east side of the river. 

TOPOGRAPHY/GEOTECHNICAL 

Geologica l  His tory  

The entire road alignment has been glacially overridden.  During the early stages 
of de-glaciation, the edge of the continental ice sheet was located immediately to 
the east of the upland areas, which prevented drainage and dammed water 
between the edge of the glacier and the mountains.  This resulted in the formation 
of glacial lakes at elevations of 600 masl, then 575 masl and 400 masl (Matthews 
1979).  Glacial lakes commonly deposit clay and silt over their footprints, and these 
materials are generally soft.  Drainages from glacial lakes often result in unstable 
steep walled valleys, but sometimes leave gravel and sand deposits in valley 
bottoms.  Within the project area, the glacial lake bottom soils likely extend from 
km 0 to km 72.  Glacial till likely underlies the soft soil of the lake bottom deposits.  
The till in this area is firmer than the lake deposits, but still fairly soft as it was 
mainly derived from very weak rock such as clay shale. 

West of km 73, glaciation also resulted in the removal of most overburden from 
upland areas in the west leaving the bedrock exposed.  Road subgrades will be 
more competent in these areas.  There is very little overburden west of km 111. 

Bedrock Geology 

From the GSC Map 1955A (1999), the bedrock geology within the alignment 
consists of Mesozoic sandstones, mudstones, siltstones, shale and 
conglomerate from km 0 to km 118, with Paleozoic sandstone, shale, siltstone, 
dolomite, limestone and conglomerate at the western section of the alignment 
from km 118 to km 127.  Overall, careful selection of quarries will need to avoid the 
weak, siltstones and shale.

C lay/T i l l  

The eastern section of the alignment from km 0 to km 73 is densely vegetated; 
therefore, it is difficult to interpret the surficial material.  However, based on the 
geological history of the area it is likely underlain by glacio-lacustrine silt and clay 
or till like materials.  Soil subgrades are probably soft. 

Muskeg 

From the air photos, discontinuous sections of muskeg appear to be present 
along the alignment between km 50 and km 83.  Permafrost may be encountered in 
muskeg areas.  Muskeg retains permafrost at much lower elevations than other 
soils.  Vegetation did not strongly indicate permafrost or an extensive depth of 
Muskeg.  Further study is recommended to assess the extent and depth of 
potential permafrost and muskeg along the alignment.  Localized permafrost in 
muskeg areas can often be avoided by rerouting.  This includes areas of deep 
muskeg. 

Bare Rock 

From the air photos, some outcropping rock can be seen along the western section of 
the alignment from approximately km 83 to km 122.  Within this portion of the 
road, bedrock is exposed almost continuously from km 95 to km 105 where the 
proposed alignment traverses the top of a rock ridge.  Bedrock is exposed 
continuously from km 122 to km 127. 

Karst  in  Bedrock Areas 

Karst topography is commonly associated with dolomite and limestone.  In cooler, 
drier climates such as in the Project area, the development of sinkholes and 
caves is much slower than in tropical climates.  There is however some evidence 
of karst topography within the western portion of the road alignment, where creek 
channels disappear from view on aerial photos.  This could be evidence of karst 
topography (caves), or it could be caused by masking of creek drainages by 
mature tree cover.  This photographic evidence of karst topography indicates 
further study should be undertaken during future phases of work.  Karsts present 
environmental issues (caves), and therefore cannot be disturbed. 

Potent ia l  Geo-hazards 

Rock-fall and slope instability could affect the proposed alignment, rock-fall and 
slope instability.  Large scale slope instabilities have been avoided in the current 
alignment.  In the next stage of design, minor realignments may be required to 
avoid smaller slope failures or to avoid rock fall runout or avalanche areas.

EXPECTED FOUNDATION CONDIT IONS AND REQUIRED ROADWAY STRUCTURE 

 Km 0-73: Clay/Till 

 Required roadway structure may range from 0.6 m up to an ultimate 
1.8 m in thickness, depending on softness of subgrade. 

 Km 50-83: Discontinuous Muskeg 

 Required roadway structure could range from 1.2 m up to an ultimate 
1.9 m of gravel.  Although routing will attempt to avoid areas of deep 
muskeg, permafrost and very soft subgrades, this option may not be 
possible at all locations and the required roadway structure will be 
increased to a maximum of 1.9 m.  Minimum granular thicknesses will 
not be feasible in these areas, due to "floating" muskeg.  Close 
cutting of trees and shrubs then placement of geo-fabric for 
separation and load redistribution is standard.  An initial, thick 
uncompacted lift of granular fill is placed ahead of heavy equipment, and 
then subsequent lifts placed and compacted.  Granular fill must be used 
on muskeg to limit softening by saturation during settlement of fill into 
muskeg. 

 Muskeg removal and replacement is an option, but requires much 
greater excavation depths and imported fill volumes. 

 Km 73-110: Clay/Till 

 Clay subgrade but more firm than glacial lake bottom material.  
Localized muskeg will have to be avoided or bridged as described 
above. 

 Km 110-127: Exposed Bedrock 

 Good subgrade and rock quarry sources, so required roadway 
structure will range from 0.3 m to 0.5 m of gravel. 

BORROW SOURCES 

There is limited evidence of features commonly associated with gravel, such as 
eskers, raised deltas, and outwash deposits.  The following exceptions, which 
warrant further investigation, include: 

 a feature which resembles a kame located north/south of km 39 

 underfit valleys located north of the proposed alignment from km 62 to km 70.  
This valley has fluvial features such as scroll bars, which are indicative of 
gravel deposits.  These types of deposits are sometimes mixed with silt 
(flood stage deposits) and can be of limited thickness. 

 river valleys east of the Liard River crossing.  These deposits may have 
limited thickness above the existing water table and may also be mixed 
with silt.  There may also be environmental constraints to gravel removal in 
this area.

In this area of northeastern BC, aggregate suitable for base course is in short 
supply.  Gravel pits near Fort Nelson have already been depleted; currently gravel 
is hauled to the community from a source on the Nelson River at Highway 77.  This 
source would be approximately 70 km from the east end of the access road 
alignment. 

All potential borrow sources and quarry locations require further geotechnical 
investigation regarding viability of potential sources.  For the purposes of this report, 
EBA considers these potential borrow sources to be acceptable for granular roadfill 
and road base and surfacing gravels. 

TYPICAL SECTIONS 

The following illustrations show a typical road section.  Actual gravel layer 
thicknesses may vary depending on the design vehicle and ground conditions.  The 
road is assumed to be constructed largely on embankment with minimal 
excavation into the existing ground.  Figure 18.3 illustrates the typical section of 
the road.

18.2.3 ESTIMATED CONSTRUCTION COSTS 

COST ESTIMATING METHODOLOGY 

In preparing the estimated construction costs for this road, EBA drew from its 
database of typical roadway construction costs for projects of a similar nature, and 
considered the site location in determining the costs. 

18.3 W A T E R  C R O S S I N G S  

Nine water crossing locations were identified based on air photo interpretation.  
Bridges will be single-lane structures with a clear roadway width of approximately 
6.6 m, providing a standard 3.6 m lane with 1.5 m shoulders either side. 

18.3.1 DESIGN CRITERIA 

Water crossing structures will be designed according to Canadian Highway Bridge 
Design Codes and BCMOT criteria.   

Simple-span structures will consist of a concrete deck that will be either precast 
or cast-in-place concrete supported on steel plate girders.  Abutments will consist of 
either reinforced concrete seats supported on driven piles or will be granular filled 
steel bin walls supported on suitable subgrade.  Material selection and construction 
techniques will be developed once site-specific geotechnical and hydraulic 
information is gathered at each bridge crossing. 

Multi-span structures with in-river work will consist of a concrete deck that will be 
either precast or cast-in-place concrete supported on steel plate girders.  
Abutments either will consist of reinforced concrete seats supported on driven 
piles or will be granular filled steel bin walls supported on suitable subgrade.  
Piers will consist of driven steel pile bents with reinforced concrete caps.  
Material selection and construction techniques will be developed once site-

specific geotechnical, hydraulic, and ice impact information is gathered at each 
bridge crossing. 

BRIDGE COSTS 

The costs of water crossings were included in the CAPEX; however, other mining 
and resource operators, logging companies, and the Government of British Columbia 
may share construction and maintenance costs. 

The access road and crossings will be constructed for a range of uses.  Access will 
be controlled at both the entrance to the road (near the Fort Nelson crossing) and at 
the mine-site. 

Wardrop developed a bridge cost estimate based on the following assumptions: 

 Single-lane bridges will be 7.5 m wide, including traffic barriers. 

 Bridges will be designed and maintained to achieve a 75-year life. 

For remote locations in BC, the average (unit price) cost of constructing a single 
lane bridge is: 

 single-span structures, with no in-river work: $9,800/m2 

 multi-span structures, with in-river work: $12,000/m2. 

18.3.2 CONSTRUCTION LOGISTICS 

While the Liard River bridge is under construction, a barge or a winter ice bridge 
could provide access to the west side of the river.  Each year there will be a period 
at the beginning and end of the winter season when the Liard River is impassable by 
barge and not suitable for crossing on the ice.  Winter roads are typically only 
open for hauling over frozen lakes for a maximum of two to three months, usually 
from January to March.  Although EBA has not assessed the history of winter roads 
that cross the Liard River, it is expected that there will be a period of four to five 
months each year during which there will be no access available during winter 
freeze-up and spring break-up. 

Assuming that barge services are readily available at this location on the Liard 
River, and that suitable ice bridges can be created across the various water 
crossings along the alignment, it is possible that a large, experienced construction 
firm could build the entire road and bridges within a two- to three-year period. 

18.4 T A I L I N G S  M A N A G E M E N T  F A C I L I T Y  

The TMF for this project will utilize previously-mined pits for tailings disposal.  The 
frac sand production process results in tailings equalling about 40% (by weight) of 
the mined material.

18.4.1 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS AND CRITERIA 

Mine and milling projections indicate a tailings stream of approximately 1,836 t/d to 
the TMF.  The annual quantity of tailings requiring disposal is approximately 
670,000 t.  A 25-year mine life will produce 16.8 Mt (11.2 Mm3) of tailings. 

The tailings material is characterized as minus 140 mesh (<0.105 mm) with little to 
no clay size particles.  A tailings beach slope of approximately 1% can be assumed 
at this level of study.  The tailings material comprises 98% silica.  For the purposes of 
preliminary design, the geochemistry of the tailings will be assumed inert in terms of 
acid generation and leachable metals. 

Supernatant water recovery will be practiced for recycle to the plant facility.  The 
TMF design will include a reclaim system to pump water from the supernatant pool to 
the plant for reuse.  Table 18.2 summarizes the TMF design criteria.

Subaqueous deposition below ice in winter 

 6.2 Average tailings in-place dry density is 1.5 t/m3 

 

18.4.2 TAIL INGS DISPOSAL 

The tailings delivery system will include a tailings slurry pump station located near 
the plant facilities and a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipeline to carry the 
tailings from the pump station to the discharge points within the tailings deposition 
area. 

For the purposes of this study, the reclaim system is assumed to include an inclined 
permanent concrete sump constructed on the pit access ramp, with a movable 
submerged pump and an HDPE pipeline to carry water from the tailings deposition 
area back to the plant facilities. 

The preliminary transport and pump sizing calculation results and water balance 
results are summarized in Table 18.3.  Pipeline sizing assumes SDR-11 HDPE pipe, 
and lengths for the slurry and reclaim pipelines are based on the longest distance 
measured from the plant to the starter pit.  The length of the water makeup pipeline 
was assumed to be 1 km with a static head of 20 m, and the power cost was 
assumed to be $0.065/kWh.

18.4.3 PIT  STABIL ITY 

The proposed mine layout is based on a series of ten surface pits, each separated by 
a 15 m wide bench.  The pit walls are will have a 1:1 slope, with 20 m wide haul 
roads ramping down the perimeter of each pit.  The pit depths vary from 60 to 80 m. 

Based on the geomorphologic evidence, the mechanical properties of the sandstone 
were estimated using Rocscience's RocLab™ software. 

The mechanical properties were inputted into Geo-Slope's Slope/W limited 
equilibrium slope stability program.  The base model was created using the 
dimensions from the preliminary mine layout drawing. 

Based on the estimated material properties and the scaled pit dimensions, the pit 
configurations proposed at this phase of design provide a more than adequate FOS 
for global stability.  The FOS ranges from 52.6 to 31.2 for the static loading and from 
45.8 to 28.6 for the pseudo-static analysis.

18.4.4 PRELIMINARY TRANSPORT CALCULATIONS 

Preliminary calculations were performed in order to estimate flows for tailings slurry, 
water reclaim and makeup water. 

The following assumptions were made: 

 tailings particle SG: 2.70 

 slurry density: 1.35 t/m3 

 average in-place tailings dry density: 1.5 t/m3 

 total evaporation: 4% of slurry water (by weight) 

 slurry flow velocity: 8 ft/sec (2.4 m/sec). 

The results indicate about 20% loss (by weight) of water due to entrainment in the 
in-place tailings void spaces.  An approximately 2,045 m3/d of makeup water  will be 
available from the tailings.  Minimum transport pipe sizes (inside diameters) of 164 
and 128 mm are estimated for the slurry delivery and water reclaim lines, 
respectively. 

These calculations are based on average conditions.  A detailed water balance is 
required to determine monthly fluctuations. 

18.4.5 PRELIMINARY WATER BALANCE 

A monthly water balance spreadsheet model was prepared for the starter pit to 
determine the maximum monthly reclaim and makeup water flows.  The following 
inputs, design criteria, and assumptions were used to develop the water balance 
model: 

 Tailings production will be 1,836 dry t/d. 

 The SG of dry tailings will be 2.70. 

 Tailings slurry solids concentration by weight will be 40%. 

 The deposited tailings dry density will be 1.50 t/m3 

 Infiltration/seepage losses from the tailings deposition area were assumed to 
be zero. 

 Winter operations will involve subaqueous tailings deposition below ice. 

 Monthly precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) values were based on Fort Liard 
A-Station data norms from 1973 through 2011. 

 Precipitation falling within the tailings deposition area was assumed to 
contribute runoff water to the water pool. 

 All precipitation falling outside the limits of the tailings deposition area was 
assumed to be diverted around the tailings deposition area.

 The snowmelt values were applied from April through June. 

 The estimated annual pond evaporation of 300 mm was distributed April 
through October. 

 Snowfall sublimation was not considered. 

 A pan evaporation coefficient of 0.70 and 0.85 was used for the pond and 
the wetted tailings beach, respectively. 

 A reclaim pool minimum operational volume of about 11,000 m3 is required 
to provide approximately three days of retention time for supernatant 
polishing. 

 An active (wetted) tailings beach area of approximately 5% of the pit top 
area is planned.

WATER BALANCE RESULTS 

The water balance spreadsheet model was executed on a monthly time step.  The 
primary goal of the model was to determine monthly maximum flows for reclaim and 
makeup water.

Based on the results for the starter pit, the estimated reclaim flow rate fluctuates 
between 2,716 m3/d and 2,783 m3/d during the year.  The estimated makeup flow 
rate fluctuates between 741 and 808 m3/d. 

During initial operations, makeup water will be required at a rate up to 3,600 m3/d 
until a water pool is established at the TMF to allow reclaim pumping.  The duration 
of start-up time will be dictated by the following factors: 

 the type of reclaim system installed (e.g. barge vs. permanent sump) 

 required retention time in the TMF water pool to "polish" the supernatant 
water for reclaim. 

A start-up water pond may be necessary to prime the makeup water supply system 
to normal operational flows.  Based on an assumed three-day retention time for 
supernatant polishing in the TMF reclaim pond, the minimum start-up pond size 
would be approximately 11,000 m3.  The start-up pond would be filled prior to start of 
initial operations. 

18.4.6 CLOSURE AND RECLAMATION CONSIDERATIONS 

The primary goal for closure is to return the land to pre-mining conditions to the 
extent practicable.  Closure of the tailings facility is envisioned comprising two main 
elements: a cover system for the tailings deposited in the impoundment, and a 
surface water management system.  The cover system is designed to be durable 
enough to withstand the climate.  The post-closure surface-water management-
system should be designed to minimize ponded water on the surface of the tailings 
and safely pass flood events. 

The staged development and backfilling of the pits will allow progressive reclamation.  
Rotational tailings spigoting from the pit perimeter, creating a tailings beach sloping 
toward the reclaim sump can be used to maximize the volume of tailings that can be 
stored in each pit.  Upon cessation of active deposition of tailings into each pit, the 
tailings surface will settle due to ongoing self-weight consolidation, with the largest 
settlement occurring near the center of the pit where the depth of tailings is the 
greatest.  The tailings deposition system can be modified during the final months of 
operation as necessary, to form the final tailings surface topography, which will 
provide positive drainage to a final closure spillway.  Spillways can be constructed 
between each pit as the tailings deposition sequence advances.  Upon final closure, 
the series of spillways will provide safe passage of the PMP storm event. 

A post-closure tailings cover will be required to provide a durable surface.  For the 
purposes of this study, the cover is assumed to consist of a 1 m-thick layer of mine 
rock.  A gravelly top layer is desired to protect the barrier cover layer from wind and 
water erosion.

18.5 P O W E R  

The Project site is in a remote location with no access to an existing power network.  
The Project site operations load is estimated to be approximately 8 MW.  Three 
power supply options were considered: 

 on-site power generation using diesel generators 

 power generation near an existing natural gas line and a transmission line to 
site 

 on-site power generation using natural gas. 

Power generation using on-site natural gas turbines will provide the most cost-
effective energy option.  While the initial capital cost of the on-site natural gas 
generation is the highest of the three options considered, the low cost of natural gas 
turbine generated electricity resulted in a capital payback period of five years.  This 
assumes that natural gas will be supplied to the site by a 130 km steel pipeline, 
connected from a main pipeline owned by Spectra Energy Corp. (Spectra).  This 
pipeline would be installed during road construction. 

The on-site gas turbine with heat recovery system will also reduce the requirement 
for additional electric power for use in area heating. 

The cost of natural gas-generated electrical power is estimated to be $0.065 kWh.

An allowance has been made for: 

 a construction camp to accommodate 200 workers, which will be converted

One security access point will be established near the Liard River water crossing, 
and second will be established at the mine entrance.

The off-site storage facility will consist of five domed, heated and insulated silos, 
each with a capacity of 100,000 t located near the Highway 77 crossing of the Fort

automated loading and unloading facilities.

19.1.1 THE SHALE GAS INDUSTRY IN  NORTH AMERICA 

Recent developments in drilling technologies, such as hydraulic fracturing combined 
with horizontal drilling, are now making the extraction of natural gas from deep shale 
rock formations economic.  The increased adoption of these drilling techniques is 
revolutionizing the dynamics of the natural gas industry in North America. 

In Canada, shale gas is an emerging source of natural gas, replacing declining 
production of conventional reserves in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.  
The National Energy Board reports there is potentially 1,000 trillion cubic feet of 
shale gas in the country, and that natural gas recovery rates from these reserves are 
likely to increase over time.  According to the Canadian Association of Petroleum 
Producers (CAPP), around 75% of Canadian shale gas reserves are located in BC's 
Horn River and Montney Basins in the northeastern part of the province.  CAPP 
expects that BC shale gas will drive natural gas production in Canada over the next 
10 years, more than off-setting the ongoing declines from conventional sources. 

19.1.2 NATURAL GAS PRICE OUTLOOK 

The US Energy Information Administration (USEIA) expects the benchmark Henry 
Hub natural gas price to increase marginally in 2011, but remain on an upward 
trajectory over the next 20 years.  Long-term natural gas prices will be supported by 
an expected shift towards natural gas for electricity generation, in large part due to its 
lower carbon emission intensity over other fossil fuels and the limits to the rate at 
which clean energy alternatives (e.g. solar, wind) can be introduced.  In addition, 
after the nuclear accident at the Fukushima plant caused by the magnitude 9.0 
earthquake that struck Japan on March 11, 2011, several countries have announced 
their intention to rethink their current energy mix, signalling a move away from 
nuclear sources of power.  This could potentially further increase the demand for 
natural gas in the medium and long term (Figure 19.1).

The shale gas industry in northeastern BC has grown significantly in recent years.  
The development of two large shale gas plays–Horn River and Montney Basins–has 
increased exploration activity in the region, prompting the interest of major oil and 
gas companies.  Frac sand is extensively used in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal 
drilling to extract natural gas from shale formations.  Therefore, frac sand demand in 
northeastern BC depends on the level of shale gas activity in the region. 

19.1.3 SHALE GAS ACTIV ITY  AND FRAC SAND DEMAND IN  THE HORN RIVER BASIN 

In 2010, several companies reported the completion of significant hydraulic fracturing 
jobs in HRB.  Based on the level of drilling activity reported by these companies PwC 
estimated the total demand for frac sand at around 347,943 t in 2010. 

PwC expects the demand for frac sand in the HRB (Table 19.1) to remain relatively 
stable in 2011, as a large number of producers in the region are still testing their 
drilling techniques and adding processing capacity to support future operations.  
Looking forward, PwC expects demand to ramp up between 2012 and 2014, as 
companies start to execute ambitious drilling programs on the back of stronger 
natural gas prices and robust project economics (Figure 19.2).

19.1.4 OPPORTUNIT IES AND BARRIERS FRAC SAND DEMAND IN  NORTHEAST BC 

Some of the main factors that could affect the future development of shale gas in 
northeast BC, and therefore the demand for frac sand, include: natural gas prices; 
enviromental considerations; new drilling techniques; US shale gas activity; and 
liquid natual gas exports. 

19.1.5 CURRENT AND POTENTIAL  SUPPLIERS OF FRAC SAND IN  NORTHEAST BC 

Out-of-province producers have historically supplied the BC frac sand market, 
primarily from Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the US.  Currently, there are 
approximately 19 major suppliers of frac sand in the US and Canada, with a

combined total capacity of between 8.1 to 8.6 Mt/a.  In addition to current frac sand 
producers, PwC has identified nine additional potential suppliers to northeast BC, 
with a combined capacity of between 3.7 to 3.8 Mt/a. 

It is important to note that currently, only three of the top 10 US industrial sand 
producers (Badger Mining Corp., Unimin Corp., and Fairmount Minerals) export frac 
sand to Canada, illustrating a potential market for domestic frac sand to meet current 
demand.  Of all current and potential suppliers to northeast BC, only Stikine is 
located in close proximity to both the Horn River and Montney Basins. 

19.1.6 CURRENT TRENDS IN  FRAC SAND PRIC ING IN  NORTHEAST BC 

The frac sand market suffered supply shortages in 2007 and 2008 during a boom in 
the petroleum industry, causing prices and delivery costs to soar.  In 2009, frac sand 
prices receded slightly, as the global recession caused commodity prices to fall from 
the peaks observed in 2008. 

Table 19.2 shows the prices and quantities sold by US frac sand producers in 2009 
for the purposes of hydraulic fracturing.

A major factor on frac sand pricing will be the amount of new supply coming onto the 
market.  As frac sand sources become more local, market prices could stabilize.  
Examples of this include Stikine's Angus and Nonda projects, which could potentially 
supply northeast BC. 

As part of our market research, PwC estimated the current cost to deliver a tonne of 
frac sand to the HRB from five different locations currently supplying operators in the 
region.  Table 19.3 presents our estimates, including a detailed breakdown of the 
different components affecting the final delivered cost. 

As it is evident from Table 19.3, transportation costs significantly affect the final cost 
of frac sand in the HRB.  In fact, transportation costs account for approximately 76% 
of total frac sand costs.  According to our estimates, the current cost to deliver a 
tonne of frac sand to a well site in the HRB ranges from $159.5/t to $318.2/t.

The absence of a local source of frac sand in northeast BC has forced well 
completion and oil and gas companies to import frac sand from distant places, 
usually paying a significant transportation premium in the form of rail, truck and 
transloading fees.  This situation presents an attractive opportunity for potential local 
suppliers to enter the frac sand market in northeast BC, as their proximity to 
northeast BC shale basins are likely to result in lower transportation costs compared 
to out-of-province suppliers. 

19.1.7 OPPORTUNIT IES AND BARRIERS TO FRAC SAND SUPPLY IN  NORTHEAST BC 

In addition to shale gas activity, the supply of frac sand in northeast BC also depends 
on API and ISO standards; frac sand activity in the US; permit and licensing 
requirements; environmental concerns; and health and safety issues.

The Project involves two main elements: the mine site and access road.  The mine 
site will include 10 open pits, developed in stages and progressively reclaimed.  The 
Project will have a modest surface operation that includes administration buildings, a 
process plant, warehouse, crushing facilities, fuel storage, residence camp and 
parking area.  The mine site access road will be constructed on the east side of the 
property and connected to Highway 77.  The access road will require the 
construction of bridges or installation of culverts to span watercourses that may be 
encountered.  Preliminary project plans suggest that nine watercourses will have to 
be spanned for this project road. 

This section of the PEA describes the following potential environmental 
considerations that may be associated with the Project: 

 environmental setting 

 review of baseline studies 

 environmental assessment and permitting process. 

20.2 E N V I R O N M E N T A L  S E T T I N G  

The Project is located north of the Liard River and east of Liard Hot Springs in the 
Polar Ecodomain, which covers the northern latitudes of Canada.  The Project area 
consists of northern plains, mountains, and plateaus (McNay 2010).  Climate is 
generally characterized by low temperatures year-round, low precipitation, and 
severe winter conditions.  The climate in the region varies from west to east, 
influenced by weather from the west.  The climate trends on the east side of the 
Project area tend to be drier (due to the lee effect of the Rocky Mountains) than other 
ecosystems influenced by similar weather systems located west of the Project area 
(McNay 2010).

20.2.1 WILDLIFE AND VEGETATION 

The Project is located at the boundary of two ecoprovinces: the Taiga Plains 
Ecoprovince, which includes the Muskwa Plateau Ecosection (one of five 
ecosections), and the Northern Boreal Mountains Ecoprovince, which includes the 
Hyland Highland and Liard Basin Ecosections (two of 16 ecosections) (McNay 2010).  
There are three main biogeoclimatic zones, including six subzones, that occur in the 
region: Boreal Altai Fescue Alpine (BAFA); Spruce Willow Birch (SWBmk and 
SWBmks); and Boreal White and Black Spruce (BWBSwk3, BWBSdk2, and 
BWBSmw). 

Small mammal species characteristic of the area include Arctic ground squirrel, 
tundra vole, meadow vole, northern red-backed vole, meadow jumping mouse, 
collared pika and muskrat.  Grizzly bear, black bear, lynx, wolverine and wolves are 
common carnivores (McNay 2010).  There are large mammals in the area, including 
moose (the most numerous) and widely-distributed ungulate.  Woodland caribou are 
also present, and spend winter months in the upland alpine, muskeg and boreal 
forests (McNay 2010). 

The Woodland caribou located in the vicinity of the Project site is provincially 
categorized as "red-listed", federally listed as threatened, as defined by Schedule 1 
of the Species at Risk Act (SARA), and is considered Identified Wildlife under the BC 
Forest and Range Practices Act.  Other key at-risk species include: the Nahanni-
Liard wood bison population, which has been re-introduced into the area (federally 
threatened, Schedule 1 of SARA, provincially red-listed); grizzly bear (federally 
Special Concern, provincially blue-listed, Identified Wildlife); and wolverine (federally 
Special Concern, provincially blue-listed [luscus subspecies], Identified Wildlife). 

No reptiles are known to be in the area; the only known amphibians in the area are 
the western toad, the northern chorus frog, and the wood frog (McNay 2010). 

The ecoprovinces located in the region of the Project are known to support 43% to 
52% of all known bird species in the province, and of that, 35% to 42% are breeding 
birds.  According to McNay, these percentages are considered low for breeding 
species, and for all bird species in the province.  This may be due to a low level of 
inventory/observer effort, reflected by the remote and relatively undeveloped 
character of the area (2010).  Species in abundance include Willow and Rock 
Ptarmigan, Bohemian Waxwing, and American Tree Sparrow (McNay 2010).  The 
Bay-Breasted Warbler may also occur in this area, and this region is the only known 
breeding area for this species in BC (McNay 2010)  Other breeding species in the 
region include the Lesser Golden-Plover, Arctic Tern, Northern Shrike, Cape May 
Warbler, Canada Warbler, Black and White Warbler, and Rose-Breasted Grosbeak 
(McNay 2010).

20.2.2 AQUATIC  SETTING 

The Project is located in the Liard River watershed.  The mine site will drain south 
toward Vizer Creek, which drains into the Liard River, which flows north toward the 
MacKenzie River.  Streams located in the region include Vizer Creek, East Fork 
Vizer Creek, Nonda Creek, an unnamed tributary to Vizer Creek, Scatter River, 
Redpot Creek and a tributary to Redpot Creek (Ingersol and Masse 2010).  Road 
access for the Project will cross several small watercourses identified at road km 25 
(the Beaver River), km 31, km 70, km 77, km 84, km 99, km 105 and km 114.  The 
access road will cross the Liard River.  The Liard River is Canada's eleventh longest 
river and, along with its tributaries, it drains an area of approximately 275,000 km2 
toward the Mackenzie River (MRBB 2003). 

Water quality values in the Liard River Basin have not shown a consistent pattern 
across the sampling locations.  Water quality sampling results demonstrated 
parameter concentrations that exceed Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment (CCME) Environmental Quality Guidelines for protecting freshwater 
aquatic life by a factor ranging from 0% to 34%.  Concentrations of metals in surface 
water that exceed CCME Environmental Quality Guidelines were attributed to 
naturally-occurring metals in the soil and bedrock.  The regional geology of the area 
influences both the type and the quantity of metals and minerals that may be washed 
into rivers through erosion.  Overall, water quality in the Liard River in 2002 was 
similar to that sampled circa 1980.  Natural conditions are likely the cause of 
variations in water quality data in the sampling locations and over time (MRBB 2003). 

Fishery values along the Liard River are high; 12 species of fish were identified in the 
river, including the only known anadromous salmonid (chum salmon) in northern BC.  
Sport fish species include arctic grayling, chum salmon, bull trout, inconnu, lake 
whitefish, mountain whitefish, northern pike and burbot.  Other non-game fish include 
the long nose sucker, lake chub, flat head chub, slimy sculpin, white sucker, round 
whitefish and the long nose dace (BC Parks 2010).  Other streams and creeks in the 
region have not been surveyed.  No critical habitat locations have been identified at 
this time; however, some may exist in the area. 

20.3 E N V I R O N M E N T A L  B A S E L I N E  R E V I E W  

Site-specific studies were commissioned by Stikine for the collection of baseline 
aquatic and terrestrial resources data for the Project area, beginning in 2009 and 
continuing to the present.  The water resources studies to date are summarized in 
Ingersol and Masse (2010).  The terrestrial resources studies are summarized in 
McNay (2010).

20.3.1 AQUATIC  RESOURCES 

Aquatic resources baseline studies were initiated in 2009.  Fourteen stations (FS-1 to 
FS-9, FS-11, FS-12, and FS-14 to FS-16) were established and sampled in 2009, 
and an additional two stations (FS-10 and FS-13) were established and sampled in 
2010 (Figure 20.1).  The stations were located on streams both upstream and 
downstream of potential mine site influences.  Sampling was not conducted at any 
potential stream crossings for the access roads. 

Water quality sampling was completed at six stations (FS-1 through FS-6) in 2009 
and at six stations (FS-1to FS-3, FS-5, FS-10, and FS-13) in 2010.  Two locations 
(FS-4 and FS-6) sampled in 2009 were not sampled in 2010 because they were 
determined to be outside the mine site.  Water sampling during the 2009 field season 
was collected in September 2009, and during the 2010 field season was collected 
monthly from June to September.  Water samples were analyzed for pH, total 
suspended solids, conductivity, temperature, turbidity, hardness and total and 
dissolved metals.  The pH values ranged from 7.9 to 8.2, values within CCME and 
BC guidelines for aquatic life (Ingersol and Masse 2010).  Water quality at the 
sampling locations was within CCME and BC guidelines for protection of aquatic life, 
with the exception of two sites (FS-1 and FS-6) where cadmium, chromium and 
selenium concentrations were identified as exceeding guidelines.  These higher 
concentrations of cadmium, chromium and selenium were located in Ghost Ridge 
and Vizer Creek. 

Periphyton samples were collected following procedures outlined in the provincial 
Resources Information Standards Committee (RISC) freshwater sampling standards.  
The ratio of phaeophytin to chlorophyll was greater than 1:1.  This is indicative of a 
period of algal senescence and a period of lower growth.  The results of periphyton 
biomass sampling are consistent with a relatively low-productivity mountain stream, 
or may have been due to the cool and cloudy weather prior to and during the 
sampling period (Ingersol and Masse 2010).  Taxonomic information was not 
available for review.

Benthic invertebrate sampling has been qualitative to date, using a kick net sampling 
method.  While suitable for providing an initial general description of the benthic 
communities in the project area, quantitative sampling of baseline conditions is 
necessary prior to project development in order to provide a basis for the quantitative 
evaluation of project related effects.  Taxonomic information was not available for 
review. 

Fish sampling was conducted during the 2010 sampling season.  This included 
quantitative removal sampling using electro shocking at eight stations (FS-2, FS-3, 
FS-7, FS-9, FS-12, FS-14 to FS-16) and presence/absence sampling at two stations 
(FS-12 and FS-16).  Lengths and weights of all fish were measured but no aging has 
been conducted to date.  In addition, no lethal sampling has been conducted to 
measure contaminant concentrations in fish tissues. 

20.3.2 TERRESTRIAL  STUDIES REVIEW 

McNay (2010) summarizes the ecological classification and characteristics of the 
region and outlines the terrestrial studies that were to be completed.  The report 
includes result summaries for a portion of the terrestrial studies that have been 
completed as of December 2010. 

Completed studies include a preliminary vegetation reconnaissance survey and 
stratified random vegetation/ecosystem sampling of the study area (175 km x 85 km 
region surrounding the proposed mining site), and initial stages of ecosystem 
mapping, including Predictive Ecosystem Mapping (PEM).  Preliminary wildlife 
habitat suitability models have been prepared for wolverine and moose.  Wildlife 
habitat suitability models for grizzly bear and caribou have been started but not 
finalized.  Additional analyses to be completed, as identified in the report, include: 

 identification of Valued Ecosystem Components (VECs) 

 completion of PEM 

 preparation of habitat suitability models for selected VECs once VEC list is 
complete 

 analysis of vegetation survey data 

 documentation of the results from vegetation sampling and modelling PEM 

 field verification of wildlife habitat suitability models 

 production of seasonal range maps for all applicable VEC species, once the 
VEC scoping analysis has been completed. 

Woodland caribou is a regionally important wildlife species and is a likely VEC to be 
considered in the environmental assessment for the Project.  Existing information 
available on this herd is outlined in McNay (2010).  McNay conducted a preliminary 
habitat reconnaissance survey in June 2010 to establish a basis for planning further

investigations of baseline conditions for woodland caribou.  The preliminary habitat 
assessment identified high-value alpine and mature/old forest habitat for caribou 
within the region.  In addition, the report outlined potential effects to caribou and 
caribou habitat in the Project area, including the potential for increased use by 
humans and predators resulting from road access into the area (access is currently 
limited), as well as a potential habitat loss from mine and road construction.  A 
preliminary reconnaissance of the Liard Plateau caribou was conducted in June and 
October of 2010, and analysis of the survey data was not provided in the December 
2010 draft report. 

Additional wildlife studies included the establishment of permanent wildlife encounter 
transects within the region to monitor potential effects on small and relatively short-
ranging wildlife species.  Transect locations must be reviewed once the Project area 
has been established to determine if the transects are appropriate.  In 2010, more 
than 400 observations of wildlife or wildlife signs were recorded.  The encounter 
transects will also be used as a basis for multiple sampling techniques identified in 
the report, including encounter, time-constrained searches (e.g. amphibians), and 
point counts (migratory songbirds, bats and cavity nesters).  Additional wildlife 
baseline studies are anticipated, including the establishment of wildlife encounter 
transects in areas not expected to be affected by Project activity, analysis of 
encounter data collected to date, and planning for conducting sampling using 
techniques other than encounter transects. 

20.3.3 WATER MANAGEMENT 

The water management requirements at the Project site were not available.  The 
development of the open pits in a sandstone unit will likely require pit dewatering to 
facilitate mining.  Pit water quantities, quality and treatment requirements have not 
yet been determined.  Given the absence of this information, it is not yet possible to 
identify potential receiving water quality considerations. 

The minimum management requirement will be for collection of runoff and settling of 
suspended solids prior to release to the environment. 

20.4 E N V I R O N M E N T A L  A S S E S S M E N T  A N D  P E R M I T T I N G  

The federal, provincial and other environmental permits and registrations that may be 
required for the Project are summarized in Table 20.1, and in the following sections. 

Under the Canada–British Columbia Agreement on Environmental Assessment 
Cooperation, projects that require an environmental assessment by both the 
Government of Canada and the Government of British Columbia will undergo a 
single cooperative assessment process that meets the roles and obligations of both 
parties.  The access road development required for this project will likely lead to a 
federal environmental assessment under the Canadian Environmental Assessment

Act (CEAA), in addition to addressing the requirements of the British Columbia 
Environmental Assessment (BCEA) process.  The Liard River Bridge will trigger a 
CEAA review; this could be proposed as a separate project. 

20.4.1 PROVINCIAL PROCESS 

The first step in the BCEA process is for the Environmental Assessment Office 
(EAO) to confirm if a project is reviewable under the Reviewable Projects Regulation.  
Under the Regulation, a sand or gravel pit is subject to a provincial EA if it has a 
production capacity of greater than 500,000 t/a of excavated sand, gravel or both 
sand and gravel during at least one year of its operation, or if production capacity 
exceeds greater than 1 M excavated tonnes in less than four years of operation.  
With planned annual production in the 1 Mt/a to 2 Mt/a range within three years of 
construction, a provincial assessment will likely be required.  Independent of these 
guidelines, a project may also be designated as reviewable by the Minister of 
Environment, or a proponent may opt into the EA process by requesting that the 
EAO designates their project as reviewable. 

If the EAO determines that an EA is required, the next step is to specify the 
information that must be included in the application for an EA certificate, the 
Application Information Requirements (AIR, formerly referred to as Terms of 
Reference).  The public will have an opportunity to comment on the AIR; the public 
comment period is a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of 75 days on the draft 
AIR.  All issues raised by government agencies, First Nations, local governments, 
stakeholders and the public are tracked and the proponent must respond to them 
(BC EAO 2010).

Following the issuance of the final AIR, the proponent may proceed with completion 
of studies and preparation of an EA Application, as outlined in the AIR.  When the 
Application is submitted to the EAO, there is a 30-day period to review the 
Application for completeness, followed by a 180-day Application Review Period, 
during which time the public has a second opportunity to comment on the project.  
After the 180-day Application Review period, the EAO will prepare an Assessment 
Report to the Minister, after which there is a 45-day period to issue a decision on the 
project.  This process is harmonized with the federal EA process, where applicable. 

ADDITIONAL PROVINCIAL  PERMITS 

The Government of BC has recently initiated a "One Project, One Process" (1P1P) 
policy for permitting major projects.  The intent is to streamline applications to obtain 
permits in a timely fashion with coordinated First Nations consultation.  The 
Government of BC, through the newly-created Ministry of Natural Resource 
Operations, is currently testing and implementing this plan.  The 1P1P approach will 
allow for permits under the Mines Act and the Environmental Management Act to be 
combined into a joint application. 

Numerous permits and registrations may be required for construction and operation 
of the Project (Table 20.1). 

Project -Wide Permi ts  

Some permits will be required for both mining activities and road construction.  For 
example, permits issued under the Forestry Act will be required for tree removal in 
the mining site and the road right of way.  Additional permits under the Forest Act for 
use of existing forestry roads may be required if they are to be used for site access.  
If construction camps are used for the construction of the Project, Camp Operation 
Permits will be required for construction of the mine site and the roadways. 

Roadway Permi ts  

Permits and applications of tenures specific to construction of the access road will 
include, for example, Crown Land Tenure under the Land Act, and a Highway 
Access permit under the Highway Act.  Utilities that may be located along the road 
right of way will also require a permit under the Land Act.  Additional permits for 
authorization of oversized vehicles may be required for construction of the access 
road, depending on the method of product transport and the types of machinery 
used.  A permit can be acquired through submission of a project description and 
associated applications to the BCMOT.  Authorization for transporting of generated 
hazardous material will be required by the company if hazardous materials will be 
transported during Project construction.  This authorization can be acquired through 
an application to the BCMOE.

Min ing Permi ts  

Permits and applications for land tenure specific to the mining operations will include 
permits under the Mines Act and Land Act for surface operations, land use, and 
rights of way, for example, Mine Permits and Crown Land Tenures.  Mines Act 
permits include specific technical requirements as part of the application for the 
permit.  A plan must be filed that details the proposed work, and a program for 
conservation of cultural heritage resources, protection and reclamation of the land, 
watercourses and cultural heritage resources that would be affected by the mine. 
This plan must include particulars and maps established by the regulations or the 
code.  This is completed under the direction of the 1P1P process, and includes 
applications for other new permits that may be required, for example, the water 
discharge permits under the Environmental Management Act.  In general, this 
process includes a pre-application meeting with the regional Mine Development 
Review Committee prior to formal submission of an application.  The Committee will 
review the application for an amendment including all other government agencies 
and First Nations.  A map showing the proposed area of disturbance should be 
generated for review at this stage and will be incorporated into the final application.  
Understanding the disturbance area will allow the review committee to determine 
how the Project will move forward.  If an EA is triggered, the 1P1P pathway would 
commence in the final meeting of the EA review, after which the applicant will 
complete a detailed joint application.  The 1P1P process at this stage would include 
information that had been collected for the EA, such as baseline data for water 
quality, hydrology and meteorology from compilation of Water Management Plans, 
and detailed technical requirements (e.g. stamped engineering drawings and building 
electrical plans). 

Numerous permits regulated under the Environmental Management Act will be 
required for air contaminants, process effluent, sewage and waste.  A permit will be 
required for each fuel storage tank kept on site.  Once the source of water has been 
identified, a water licence will be required.  The water licence includes authorizations 
for water consumption, storage and diversion of water sources.  Any application with 
a proposed diversion rate of greater than 100 m3/d (25,000 gal/d) will require a 
development plan under the Water Act.  If water is to be collected from groundwater 
wells, the wells must be installed in accordance with the Water Act and the Ground 
Water Protection Regulation.  These permits can be acquired through submission of 
a project description and associated applications to the Water Stewardship Division 
of the BCMOE. 

MINE CLOSURE AND RECLAMATION PLAN 

A mine closure and reclamation plan will be required to obtain a permit approving the 
mine plan and reclamation program under the Mines Act.  Financial assurance must 
be posted to secure the rehabilitation works, and must be sufficient to cover any 
continuing maintenance and monitoring that may be required.  A detailed projection 
of reclamation costs, including provisions for long-term monitoring, maintenance, and

of the Nonda Project, Northern BC 

  

 

mitigation of environmental impacts, is required in an application for a Mines Act 
permit (BCMEM 2010). 

The mine plan and reclamation program should be detailed enough to assure 
technical reviewers that the proponent has the necessary understanding, resources, 
technical capability and intent to develop the mine in a safe and environmentally 
sound manner, and that there are no major issues or concerns which have not been 
addressed or cannot be adequately mitigated (BCMEM 2010).  The most important 
issue is often the potential for acid rock drainage and metal leaching (ARD/ML), 
which requires considerable information at the Application Stage. 

It is recognized that a practical reclamation strategy may change from the inception 
of a mining project due to unforeseen changes in the mining plan, site conditions or 
improving technology.  A proponent is required to revise and resubmit the 
reclamation strategy in the event that a project deviates from the documented 
development plan.  As mine and reclamation plans change, applications for 
amendments to the Mines Act Permit are required. 

20.4.2 FEDERAL PROCESS 

CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT ACT 

A project description will be submitted to the CEA Agency and to federal authorities 
such as Environment Canada, Health Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and 
Transport Canada.  During this time, the federal agencies will determine if a federal 
environmental assessment is necessary under the CEAA.  A federal EA is triggered 
when a federal authority determines it must provide a licence, permit or an approval 
that enables a project to be carried out (such as an authorization under the Fisheries 
Act and/or under the Navigable Waters Protection Act).  Triggers under the Fisheries 
Act and Navigable Waters Protection Act are anticipated for the Project. 

The level of environmental assessment that is necessary for a mining operation in 
the presence of a CEAA trigger is determined by a number of factors, outlined in the 
Comprehensive Study List Regulations under CEAA.  The basic level of assessment 
is the screening level.  The next level is the comprehensive study, which is typically 
applied to larger and more complex projects. 

If a federal agency determines that it must issue a permit or approval for the project, 
CEAA and the responsible federal authorities would then determine the level of 
environmental assessment to be applied to the project.  For example, a stone quarry 
or gravel or sand pit with a production capacity of 1 Mt/a or greater from one pit 
would be subject to a comprehensive study.  The 1 Mt/a production rate and 
1.67 Mt/a throughput of this Project may trigger a comprehensive study if federal 
approval is required.  Federal permits or approvals cannot be issued until the federal 
agencies complete and sign off on a comprehensive study report. 



 

 

 Stikine Energy Corp. 20-16 1192020100-REP-R0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment 
of the Nonda Project, Northern BC 

  

 

As the proposed project is considered a natural resource development, the Major 
Project Management Office (MPMO) would provide overarching project management 
for the federal environmental assessment process.  Natural Resources Canada 
administers the MPMO, and its role is to provide guidance to project proponents and 
other stakeholders, coordinate project agreements and timelines between federal 
departments and agencies, and track and monitor the progress of major resource 
projects through the federal regulatory review process. 

FISHERIES ACT 

The DFO is responsible for protecting fish and fish habitat in Canada.  Under section 
35(1) of the federal Fisheries Act, "no person shall carry on any work or undertaking 
that results in the harmful alteration, disruption or destruction (HADD of fish habitat" 
except when authorized by DFO, as outlined in subsection 35(2) or through 
regulations under the Fisheries Act (DFO 2002). 

Nine water crossings, two multi-spanned bridges and seven single-span structures 
will be required for access to the Project site.  Compliance with all municipal, 
provincial, territorial and/or federal legislation that applies to the work being carried 
out in relation to DFO's Operational Statement (OS) is also required. 

If an Authorization is required, depending on the type of approval required, the 
complexity of the project, and any associated field studies, it can take anywhere from 
one month to several years to obtain.  Other Project activities (e.g. construction of 
crossing structures [culverts], any work in or about a watercourse) will require an 
Authorization under the Fisheries Act if they result in HADD. 

Stream crossings other than clear span bridges will involve a HADD authorization.  
Clear span bridges designed and constructed in accordance with the OS prepared by 
DFO can typically be constructed without triggering the need for an Authorization 
under the Fisheries Act.  Proponents are encouraged to consider location and design 
options that will avoid impacts to fish habitat before DFO will consider authorizing 
work, which would require habitat compensation to achieve no net loss of fish 
habitat. 

Habitat compensation is an option for achieving no net loss when residual impacts of 
projects on habitat productive capacity are deemed harmful after relocation, redesign 
or mitigation options have been implemented.  Habitat compensation involves 
replacing the lost fish habitat with newly created habitat or improving the productive 
capacity of some other natural habitat.  Depending on the nature and scope of the 
compensatory works, habitat compensation may require, but not be limited to, five 
years of post-construction monitoring (DFO 2002).

NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION ACT 

In general, navigable waters include all bodies of water that are capable of being 
navigated by any type of floating vessel for transportation, recreation or commerce 
(Transport Canada 2010).  New construction occurring in, on, over, under, through or 
across navigable waters, that has the potential for interfering with navigation, must 
be reviewed under the Navigable Waters Protection Act (NWPA), administered by 
Transport Canada.  An application under NWPA subsection 10(1) is also required for 
the repair, rebuilding or alteration of existing work (Transport Canada 2010). 

NWPP has been established to guide proponents through the NWPA process.  
Information required by the NWPP to determine if an authorization is required 
includes details regarding the applicant, the nature of the work, other approvals 
obtained, property ownership, and drawings and plans of the proposed work.  A 
NWPP Officer will determine if the work will interfere with navigation (i.e. whether the 
project will or will not interfere substantially).  If the work will interfere substantially 
with navigation, then the approval process is longer and there are additional steps to 
complete (e.g. advertising the project to the public, CEAA is triggered).  These steps 
may still be required by Transport Canada (2010), even if the work is determined to 
not interfere substantially with navigation. 

20.5 S O C I A L  C O N S I D E R A T I O N S  

The goals and objectives of this assessment were to: 

 confirm communities that would be affected by the development of the 
Project 

 identify potential positive impacts of the Project to local First Nations and 
other communities 

 identify potential impacts to Project development from local First Nations and 
other communities  

 advise on further study requirements 

20.5.1 PROJECT LOCATION AND FIRST NATIONS 

First Nations groups were identified through the Government of British Columbia's 
interactive Consultative Areas Database as having interests encompassing Stikine's 
Project development property and related infrastructure in northern BC.  The 
traditional territories of these communities span northeast BC, southeast Yukon, and 
southwest NWT.  All First Nation communities identified as having an interest in the 
Project are currently engaged in prospective natural resource developments within 
their traditional territories, and all have signed agreements with the Government of 
British Columbia and industry partners.  Most local First Nations have businesses, 
both private and band-owned, related to the mining industry.

20.5.2 CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL FIRST NATIONS 

Consultations with local First Nations are a legal obligation on the part of industry 
and government, based on Aboriginal case law decisions in Delgamuukw, Haida and 
Taku.  In situations where statutory decisions have been made on the part of the 
Crown, it is the duty of the Crown to consult.  In situations where no statutory 
decisions have been made on the part of the Crown, it is the duty of the proponent to 
consult and to accommodate local First Nation interests. 

There are significant costs associated with consultation, including one or more of the 
following: 

 memorandums of understanding 

 protocol agreements 

 community consultation/participation agreements 

 socio-economic/community economic benefits agreements 

 environmental monitoring agreements 

 training agreements 

 accommodation/impact benefit agreements. 

Stikine has engaged the services of an Aboriginal Relations Specialist for discussion 
with local First Nations.  Discussions are ongoing, although the level and stages of 
negotiations is not known.  No memorandums of understanding were reviewed and 
no data on Agreements was available for this study. 

20.5.3 POTENTIAL  POSIT IVE EFFECTS OF PROJECT ON LOCAL COMMUNIT IES 

Potential positive effects of the proposed Project development include:  

 reduction of unemployment in the region, in both aboriginal and non-
aboriginal communities 

 economic stimulus for existing local businesses 

 long-term, meaningful employment for local First Nations in mining 
operations and related positions (e.g. environmental monitors, service 
industry sector) 

 economic development and contract opportunities for local First Nations 
(existing and new businesses), community infrastructure improvements, and 
capacity development of First Nations 

 support for First Nation Research Projects associated with mining operations 

 negotiate memoranda of understanding, accommodation agreements and/or 
other agreements with local first nations.

20.5.4 POTENTIAL  IMPACTS TO THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT FROM LOCAL COMMUNIT IES 

Primary risks to development include: 

 environmental concerns of significance to local First Nations, such as 
impacts to fish-bearing watersheds or caribou populations 

 potential infringements upon Aboriginal Title and Rights 

 potential impacts to cultural heritage resources 

 general concerns and/or perceptions by local First Nations regarding over-
development of mining in the region 

 inadequate consultation with local First Nations, notably, a lack of 
consultation could result in a legal challenge to mine development, hindering 
development for several years 

 lack of accommodation agreements with local First Nations; having 
accommodation agreements improves the likelihood of development 
proceeding without issues. 

20.5.5 FURTHER STUDY REQUIREMENTS AND ADVICE ON COMMUNICATIONS 

Further study requirements and advice on communications include: 

 ongoing discussions with local First Nations to establish meaningful 
relationships regarding consultation processes and address concerns 

 determine local First Nations heritage interests within and around the 
development area 

 work with designated First Nations representatives on development of 
mitigation alternatives to address potential impacts (e.g. environment, 
heritage, health) to First Nations communities 

 develop a community communications strategy 

 develop a Negotiation Strategy and Strategic Plan for engagement with local 
First Nations for the next phase of the Project, including: 

 development of materials in appropriate formats for community 
distribution and community presentations (e.g. information in clear, 
accurate, complete and plain language) 

 review existing Agreements and Treaty-related documents to determine 
relevance to Project 

 ascertain how the Project might be integrated with other natural resource 
development projects within the region to the maximum benefit of local 
First Nations.

21.1.3 ESTIMATE APPROACH 

ESTIMATE BASE DATE,  PROJECT CURRENCY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE 

The estimate base date is based on Q3 2011; no allowance for escalation was 
included.  Quotations provided by vendors are budgetary and non-binding.   

All costs are expressed in Canadian dollars.  Costs submitted in other currencies 
were converted to Canadian dollars, using an exchange rate of US$0.97/Cdn$1.00, 
which is a three-year average of foreign exchange rates. 

FREIGHT AND LOGISTICS 

Equipment and material costs are included as Free Carrier (FCA), manufacturer's 
plant, as defined by International Commercial Terms (Incoterms) 2010.  Costs such 
as spares, duties, freight and packaging are included in the indirect costs portion of 
the CAPEX. 

DUTIES AND TAXES 

Duties and taxes, including Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), were excluded. 

LABOUR RATES AND COSTS 

A single blended labour rate of $90/h was used throughout the estimate, except 
where noted in Section 16. 

This labour rate includes: 

 vacation and statutory holiday pay 

 fringe benefits and payroll burdens 

 overtime and shift premiums

22.1 P R I N C I P A L  A S S U M P T I O N S  

For the purpose of this Project's financial analysis, Wardrop applied the following 
study results and assumptions: 

 All costs, revenues, and financial evaluation are calculated and presented in 
Canadian dollars. 

 The Project LOM will be 25 years. 

 A detailed mine production schedule was included in the financial model. 

 1 Mt/a of frac sand will be produced annually. 

 The process plant will operate for 25 years. 

 The product yield (processing recovery) will be 60%. 

 The Project annual throughput will be 1.67 Mt. 

 The initial capital cost for the Project is estimated at $665.54 million 

 A working capital amount of $11 million is based on three months of first-
year operating cost. 

 No mine sustaining capital is required, assuming that work will be performed 
by a contractor. 

 Process sustaining capital estimates were provided by Sepro, and are 
included in the financial model. 

 End-of-project salvage value was not included. 

 The average operating cost was estimated to be $24.49/t milled. 

 Annual catering cost was estimated to be $3.16 million. 

 A frac sand price of $250/t free on board (FOB) at the Highway 77 Fort 
Nelson River facility in the HRB was assumed for the base case scenario. 

 A frac sand off-site transportation cost of $19.80/t was estimated. 

 No other off-site charges were included. 

 No royalties or product insurance costs were included. 

 A discount rate of 8% was applied.

22.2 F I N A N C I A L  O U T C O M E S  

For the base case scenario, Wardrop calculated the following pre-tax economic 
evaluation results: 

 25.9% IRR 

 3.6 year payback on $665.54 million initial capital 

 $1.205 billion NPV at 8% discount rate. 

An additional alternate case scenario was developed for a frac sand price of $300/t. 
Project economic evaluation results for the base case and the alternate case 
scenarios are presented in Table 22.1.

22.3 P R E - T A X  M O D E L  

The Project cash flow from operations were consolidated into the financial model.  
The production schedules were incorporated into the pre-tax financial model to 
determine annual recovered frac sand quantities and values.  The annual net 
revenue from assumed frac sand sales was determined by deducting the 
transportation charges (from mine site to the Highway 77 facility location) from gross 
revenue. 

Unit operating costs were multiplied by annual milled tonnages to determine the total 
mine operating costs.  The total mine operating costs were then deducted from frac 
sand net revenue to derive annual mine income. 

Initial and sustaining capital costs were incorporated on a year-by-year basis over 
the LOM and deducted from the net revenue to determine the net cash flow before 
taxes.  Initial capital expenditures include costs accumulated prior to first production 
of final product.

Sensitivity analyses in the range of ±20% were carried out for the base case scenario 
on the following parameters: 

 operating cost 

 capital cost 

 final product (frac sand) price. 

The analyses are presented as financial outcomes in terms of NPV in Table 22.2 and 
Figure 22.2,and in terms of IRR in Table 22.3 and Figure 22.3.  The Project NPV (at 
8% discount rate) and Project IRR are both most sensitive to the frac sand price.

25.1 S U M M A R Y  

Based on the positive results of this study Wardrop suggests Stikine proceed with 
completion of those project activities that lead to the next phase of the Project, in 
order to identify opportunities and further assess viability of the Project. 

25.2 G E O L O G Y  

An initial reconnaissance in 2009 identified the north-trending belt of quartz arenite 
as a potential source of the frac sand.  This belt of quartz arenite forms the Ghost 
Ridge, which is more than 11 km long and approximately 1 km wide. 

A 9-hole HQ diamond-drilling program was completed in September and October 
2009, over a 2.2 km strike length and 0.9 km width.  Vertical holes were drilled to 
depths of between 70 and 168 m, along three 3-hole fences; each drillhole was 
collared in and terminated in quartz arenite.  Whole rock geochemical and 
petrographic analyses were collected for 41 samples of drillcore, and the results of 
these confirmed a quartz-rich unit, which could potentially be processed for use as 
frac sand. 

The deposit is open in all directions, but particularly to the south, were it outcrops for 
another 5 km or so, before becoming interbedded with weakly metamorphosed 
shale.  The distribution and homogeneity of the quartz arenite in the central Ghost 
Ridge claims of interest area are characteristics that are consistent with a potential 
bulk mineable industrial mineral deposit. 

25.3 M I N I N G  

Wardrop selected an open pit mining method involving 10 consecutively-developed 
open pits for the Project.  Other approaches to open pit mining could be considered.  
If the backfill is more consolidated, it may be possible to backfill without the need for 
separate pits.  This would reduce ramp construction and allow pits to be backfilled 
before they are fully mined-out.  This would be particularly relevant in the case of the 
starter pit.

25.4 I N F R A S T R U C T U R E  

Further field investigations, including a study of the surficial geology, are required. 

Temporary bridges and crossings will be required during construction.  A road design 
based on a new LIDAR survey is required. 

25.5 P R O C E S S  

Preliminary and ongoing pilot-plant test results for recovery are approximately 60%. 

25.6 E N V I R O N M E N T A L  

ARD is not a likely concern for this project due to the general nature of the resource.  
However, confirmatory ARD testing is still required and metal leaching remains a 
potential issue of concern even in the absence of ARD, so metal leaching testing of 
all mineralized material, waste, and overburden materials is necessary in order to 
fully understand water quality and water treatment requirements for the Project. 

25.7 M A R K E T I N G  

There is a viable market for the commodity in a number of nearby developing 
unconventional shale-gas basins in northeast BC.  There is an attractive opportunity 
for potential local suppliers to enter the frac sand market in northeast BC, where local 
suppliers are expected to have a significant competitive advantage over current 
suppliers.

26.1 S U M M A R Y  

Based on the recommendations outlined in this section and interpretations and 
conclusions (Section 25) the next phase of work for this Project is expected, on a 
preliminary basis, to cost approximately $2.5 million.  Production of the subsequent 
prefeasibility report is projected to cost approximately $1 million, for a total of $3.5 
million. 

26.2 G E O L O G Y  

The property is currently classified as an Inferred Resource.  Wardrop recommends 
a thorough sampling program of 2009 core in connection with additional drilling to 
allow reclassification as an Indicated Resource.  Sample length should not exceed 
future bench height (10 m). 

Wardrop also recommends infill-drilling of two fences, three holes each.  One fence 
should be located between the 2009 southern and central fence, the other between 
the 2009 central and northern fence.  Drilling should proceed to a depth of 100 m. 
NQ is a sufficient drill diameter. 

The sampling program should be designed to demonstrate spatial variation in grade 
within the sandstone unit to be expected during production.  The most important 
grade parameter is the grain size distribution, which should be tested in each 10 m 
sample.  This would allow for the estimation of the variability of the deposit and the 
potential estimated useable product. 

Other parameters like density, sphericity and roundness, acid solubility, turbidity, and 
crush resistance (all part of API RP19C governing procedures) should be determined 
after grain size distribution results are known.  Wardrop recommends testing 15 
samples (each comprising five gallons of drillcore each) for these parameters.  
Composited samples are permissible.  SG verifications are of particular concern, 
because three of the 21 samples from the 2009 results appear elevated.  This has 
been accounted for by a 6% reduction in the resource estimate.

Estimated costs for the recommended exploration program are: 

 Existing Sample Testing 

 930 m of existing core = 93 samples ($1,200/ea): $111,600. 

 Drilling 

 600 m at $450/m: $270,000 

 600 m of new core = 60 samples ($1,200/ea): $72,000 

 15 samples to test other parameters ($2,500/ea): $37,500. 

The total estimated cost for this work is $491,100. 

26.3 M I N I N G  

Wardrop recommends the following for the next level of study: 

 perform a trade-off study to evaluate the merits of a higher number of 
smaller machines versus a lower number of larger machines, with respect to 
long-term breakdown and the availability of replacement equipment 

 evaluate the benefits of contractor versus owner operated equipment 

 conduct a pit slope evaluation to look at the potential of increasing the pit 
wall slopes, thus reducing the surface footprint of the pits 

 develop a detailed scope of work for a mining contractor and request a 
minimum of three expressions of interest from Canadian mining/quarrying/ 
earth moving companies 

The total estimated cost for this work is $55,000. 

26.4 P R O C E S S  P L A N T  

A variety of scrubbing technologies may be applicable to the attrition needs of the 
process plant.  Pilot plant testing used a standard rectangular design, but lab tests 
have indicated that some other products, such as round cell, bottom-feeding designs, 
may be more efficient for this process.  Based on excellent lab results, this design 
has been included in the proposed plant design.  Additional testing on the 
appropriate scrubbing technology is recommended.  There are trials of the round cell 
bottom feeding technology in place at the pilot plant, and the suitability of this design 
needs to be assessed based on the pilot plant results. 

Recent laboratory test work on the process has also indicated that a change to the 
attrition and classification circuits may be more beneficial to product yields and 
specifications.  Currently, the entire feed is scrubbed once, for the same amount of 
time, and then sent to the classification circuit.  It is recommended that a two-stage

attrition and classification process be investigated.  Laboratory tests indicate that the 
finer 100-mesh product needs only a short scrub, but the coarser material requires 
more residence time.  In this proposed amendment to the process, the whole feed is 
scrubbed for a short time (approximately 15 minutes), and then separated from the 
coarser fraction (20/70 mesh) which is then sent through a second, longer scrub.  
Tests based on this design are currently underway at the pilot plant. 

The total estimated cost for this work is $175,000. 

26.5 T A I L I N G S  M A N A G E M E N T  F A C I L I T Y  

Tetra Tech recommends a field-testing program to determine the actual properties 
and variability of the material.  The program should include the following tests: 

 slake durability 

 triaxial strength 

 permeability. 

Testing of tailings is required before reliable estimates can be made of the expected 
tailings' dry density during conventional (low-density) slurry deposition into the 
tailings facility.  This is important for establishing the size and configuration of the 
facility as well as its associated capital cost.  Further, the testing will aid in assessing 
the benefits of an under drain system and estimating a depositional system. 

The recommended bench-scale laboratory-testing program includes a standard suite 
of tests to characterize the behaviour of tailings under depositional and 
environmental conditions.  The tailings slurry is subjected to a series of 
sedimentation and desiccation tests in order to evaluate the performance of the 
slurry under various deposition scenarios and at different solids contents for each 
sample specified by the client.  Our practice with tailings characterizations is to 
perform a suite of tests, including the target solids content and at 10% to 15% above 
and below the target, to give the TMF designers a range of expected performance 
parameters for use in design evaluations and analyses.   

Additional recommended testing includes consolidation and load/permeability testing 
to support impoundment filling simulations and consolidation modelling.  The 
consolidation modelling requires material properties relating to compressibility, 
permeability and initial solids content for the anticipated tailings material.  Shear 
strength testing of the tailings is also recommended to support geotechnical 
analyses.

26.6 E N V I R O N M E N T A L  

26.6.1 AQUATIC  RESOURCES 

The sampling program has not to date included streamflow monitoring and the water 
quality monitoring needs a complete seasonal component.  Streamflow data are 
necessary to support future environmental impact assessment in relation to any 
discharges to surface waters and to better understand seasonal patterns of water 
quality.  Seasonal (spring freshet, midsummer, autumn, and potentially winter) 
sampling is necessary to document the seasonal variations in water quality that 
typically occur in flowing waters.  Conduct a quantitative benthos analysis and a 
complete collection of fish data.  Sampling locations need to be reviewed in relation 
to the developing project plans to ensure that all potential project-aquatic 
environment interactions are adequately described and assessed.  The timing of any 
additional field studies is ultimately determined by Stikine's project development 
plans but these need to ensure sufficient time for at least one full year of survey to 
address any data gaps.  Fish and fish habitat surveys, including water quality 



 

 

 Stikine Energy Corp. 26-5 1192020100-REP-R0001-04 
Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment 
of the Nonda Project, Northern BC 

  

 

sampling are required at all planned stream crossing locations along the proposed 
access road.  All sampling efforts should follow established RISC standards. 

The total estimated cost for this work is $225,000. 

26.6.2 TERRESTRIAL  STUDIES 

The mine site and the access road have very different potential project-environment 
interactions.  The interactions between the mine site and the terrestrial environment 
are potentially intense but highly localized; the potential adverse effects are largely 
limited to disturbance of rare species and species at risk.  However, because the 
area of effect is very small in a regional context, the potential for the mine site to 
adversely affect regional populations of large mammals and other wildlife is 
negligible. 

Conversely, the construction and operation of an all-weather access road into an 
area that was previously accessible only during winter introduces the possibility of 
more wide-spread effects on wildlife and brings the project into a regional planning 
and assessment context that requires considerably more information on the regional 
wildlife populations in order to complete the project environmental impact 
assessment.  The environmental assessment for the access road component of the 
project will need to draw upon both the regional wildlife information compiled by the 
resource management agencies as well as project-specific wildlife studies.  In this 
case, the regional study information is only now developing and the project-specific 
information gaps cannot yet be clearly identified.  Stikine is now, and likely will need 
to continue, participating in these regional studies more than would typically be the 
case for a project of this size in order to ensure that adequate information is available 
to support their EIA. 

The total estimated cost for this work is $300,000. 

It is not possible at this time to identify any project-specific wildlife studies that will be 
necessary to support environmental permitting of the project.  Understanding of the 
potential interactions between project components and woodland caribou, wood 
bison, grizzly bear, and other wildlife species and their habitats is clearly necessary. 
Similarly, species-specific population and habitat studies will be necessary and these 
potentially would include provincially/federally listed bats, owls, invertebrates, small 
mammals, rare plant surveys, mapping and/or field identification of rare ecological 
communities.  However, additional information on potential locations of project 
components also is necessary in order to make more specific study 
recommendations.

26.6.3 WATER MANAGEMENT 

The metal leaching properties of the stockpiled materials have yet to be determined, 
and these may indicate additional treatment requirements beyond management of 
suspended solids. 

The process water requirements for the sand processing mill also remain to be 
defined, along with identification of potential process water sources.  The process 
effluent quality, and the related treatment requirements for either discharge or reuse, 
have to be identified. 

Given the general nature of the resource, ARD is not a likely concern for this Project.  
However, confirmatory ARD testing is still required and metal leaching remains a 
potential issue of concern even in the absence of ARD, so metal leaching testing of 
all material, waste and overburden materials is necessary in order to fully understand 
water quality and water treatment requirements for the Project. 

The total estimated cost for this work is $37,500. 

26.7 R O A D S  

The field investigation elements required to advance design to the next study level 
include  

 Geotechnical investigation of the road subsurface and borrow sources , 

 Detailed Lidar and Orthophoto coverage of the road corridor 

  Examination of construction staging elements (ice crossings, barge landings 
etc) 

  Hydrology investigation of the stream crossings. 

The total estimated cost for this work is $500,000. 

26.8 B R I D G E S  

Further field investigations are required to bring the design to the next study level, 
including: 

 LIDAR survey at each location 

 site reconnaissance 

 geotechnical investigations 

 seismic recommendations

 preliminary design of the structures. 

The total estimated cost for this work is $500,000. 

26.9 P O W E R  

Wardrop recommends additional investigations regarding natural gas-fired turbines 
for power generation.  These investigations should analyze the capacity and quality 
of Spectra's natural gas pipeline, the costs associated with obtaining natural gas 
from it, and the specifications of a pipeline from the tap point to the Project site. 

The total estimated cost for this work is $54,900. 

26.10 M A R K E T I N G  

The following are recommended for the next level of study: 

 update market studies 

 investigate contracts or off-take agreements for future sales. 

The total estimated cost for this work is $120,000.
