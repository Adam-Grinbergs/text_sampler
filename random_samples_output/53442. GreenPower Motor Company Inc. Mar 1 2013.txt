1  Summary 

This report is written as a Technical Report (the "Report") for the Duma Point, Dubinky 
Well, Moab Fault, and Flat Iron Properties (the "Properties" or the "Utah Manganese 
Properties").  The Properties are held 100 percent (%) by Utah Manganese Inc. (Utah 
Manganese") a wholly owned subsidiary of 0939181 B.C. Ltd.  This report has been 
prepared for Oakmont Capital Corp. ("Oakmont" or the "Company") for the purposes of 
completing a "Qualifying Transaction" as a Capital Pool Company, under the policies of 
the TSX Venture Exchange.  The Utah Manganese Properties consist of 150 mineral 
claims totalling 1,250 hectares located 25 to 50 kilometres (km) from Moab, in southeast 
Utah.  On October 25, 2012, Oakmont entered into a Share Exchange Agreement 
(SEA) with 0939181 B.C. Ltd. (the "Target"), subject to regulatory approval, whereby 
Oakmont can earn a 100% interest in Properties.  Pursuant to the terms of the SEA, as 
consideration for the purchase of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of the 
Target, Oakmont has agreed to issue 3,352,000 common shares of the Company to the 
shareholders of the Target.  This report is written to comply with standards set out in 
National Instrument (NI) 43-101 for the Canadian Securities Administration. 
 
Oakmont retained APEX Geoscience Ltd. (APEX) in October 2012 to complete an 
independent technical report specific to the Properties.  Mr. Kristopher J. Raffle. P.Geo., 
Senior Geologist of APEX, an independent and qualified person as defined by NI 43-
101 conducted a property visit between October 12 and 13, 2012. 
 
During 2010 and 2012, Utah Manganese completed exploration within the Properties 
including the collection of 49 rocks grab samples and drilling of 19 reverse circulation 
(RC) holes, totalling 663.9 m.  To date Oakmont has not conducted any exploration 
within the Properties. 
 
The Utah Manganese Properties are located within the northern Pennsylvanian to 
Cretaceous Paradox Basin.  The northern Paradox Basin consists of a series of 
approximately parallel northwest-southeast trending faults, anticlines, and synclines.  
Within the Moab Valley, salt from the Paradox Formation has risen diapirically to the 
surface.  Salt structures were subsequently buried by up to 2 km of post-Triassic 
sediments.  Salt dissolution has resulted in down-faulting and the graben formation 
along anticlinal crests.  Manganese oxide mineralization occurs as lens-like strata-
bound replacement bodies and associated manganese nodules of variable thickness 
and strike extent (Duma Point and Dubinky Well properties); or as fault gouge hosted 
lenses (Moab Fault Property) and brittle fault hosted vein-fracture infill (Flat Iron 
Property).  Strata-bound bodies often occur proximal to or may partially-completely 
replace thin limestone or sandy limestone beds, of the Middle Jurassic Summerville-
Tidwell interval. 

Manganese deposits of the "Little Grand District" were exploited between 1901 and 
1940.  During 1903, 1904 and 1906 the Colorado Fuel & Iron Company (C.F. & I.) mine 
produced somewhat less than 3,630 metric tonnes (t) or ore.  The Green River Mining 
Co subsequently leased the mine and from between 1915 and 1918, production, 
principally from the C.F. & I. mine and a number of other deposits, totalled about 7,260

t.  In 1915 and 1917, Elmer & McWilliams and in the Burgess Mineral Co. developed 
several ore bodies at Duma Point producing 770 t of ore.  Historic production figures for 
the Moab Fault and Flat Iron properties are not known, however evidence of historic 
mining activities including pits, trenches, and short adits occur throughout the 
Properties. 
 
Of the 49 rock samples collected by Utah Manganese, 20 returned values greater than 
20% manganese oxide (MnO), and up to 74.9% MnO.  Visible manganese 
mineralization occurs within Duma Point holes DP-12-03 and DP-12-05, DP-12-07 and 
Dubinky Well hole DW-12-01.  Utah Manganese is currently preparing samples for 
analysis and the results are expected before the end of March 2013.  Duma Point drill 
holes intersected a near horizontal sequence, from surface, comprising approximately 
6.5 m of sandstone and 11 m of locally manganiferous siltstone and shale (Summerville 
Formation) overlying basal Slick Rock Member sandstone.  Dubinky Well drill holes 
intersected a 1.5 m interval of Salt Wash Member sandstone, underlain by 20 m of 
siltstone and shale of the Tidwell-Summerville interval, followed by basal Moab Tongue 
sandstone. 

Rock grab sampling at the Dubinky Well Property establishes that lenses of high grade 
manganese oxide occur intermittently over a distance of approximately 1.4 km. 
Mineralization is not continuous along strike between sample sites, however based on 
its significant lateral expression it can be inferred that there is a high potential for 
discovery of additional mineralized zones in subsurface down dip.  Given bedding and 
mineralization dip shallowly to the north-northwest, and that the mineralizaiton is 
present near the top of the sedimentary section, a relatively large area of the Dubinky 
Well Property has the potential to host mineralization under relatively shallow (<5 to 20 
m) cover.        
 
At Duma Point, mineralization occurs at an equivalent stratigraphic position, and the 
overlying stratigraphy thickens rapidly to the north-northeast.  Despite this, given that 
the combined lateral exposure at surface of manganese oxide bearing strata is 
approximately 5.7 km, significant exploration potential for near surface deposits 
remains. 
 
Within the Moab Fault and Flat Iron Properties, exploration is at an early stage but has 
resulted in the identification of numerous high-grade manganese oxide occurrences that 
warrant follow-up.  There is potential to define the along strike and depth extent of the 
known sub-vertical fault-hosted zones of mineralization, and for the discovery of parallel 
secondary fault structures that have potential to host additional zones. 
 
RC drilling completed to date within the Duma Point and Dubinky Well Properties is 
insufficient to establish the size of manganese oxide lenses, or their down dip extent.  
The success of exploration on the Properties depends on the identification of several 
manganese oxide lenses, having sufficient size and thickness that in aggregate have 
may be economically extracted.  Manganese mineralization is likely to produce 
resistivity low electro-magnetic (EM) geophysical anomalies, and massive 
mineralization may be indirectly detectable via contrast with magnetically neutral host

rocks.  Further diamond or RC drilling targets should be defined on the results of 
detailed ground or airborne EM and magnetic geophysical surveys.        
 
Based on the presence of near surface strata-bound lens, and fault-fracture controlled 
manganese-oxide occurrences; laterally extensive favourable geologic horizons; and 
evidence of significant reduced paleo-fluid flow within permeable lithologies underlying 
mineralized zones; the Utah Manganese Properties are of a high priority for follow-up 
exploration.  The 2013 exploration program should include, but not be limited to: 

a) A field based program comprising ground-truthing and geologic mapping of 
historically reported manganese oxide occurrences within the Properties; Property-scale 
mapping of the aerial distribution of Curtis-Summerville-Tidwell rocks and detailed 
stratigraphic section studies to determine local bed-scale mineralization controls.  
Additional rock grab sampling including the collection of chip samples to determine 
grade over width inventories of significant occurrences is warranted.  In total 
approximately 200 rock samples should be collected b) ground magnetic and time 
domain electro-magnetic (TDEM) or frequency domain electro-magnetic (HLEM) 
surveys should be completed over the principal manganese oxide occurrences within all 
four Properties.  Semi-massive to massive pyrolusite lenses are expected to produce 
magnetic and resistivity low (conductive) anomalies, that will serve to further define the 
known occurrences and aid in the discovery of buried deposits c.)  RC drilling of 20 
holes (approximately 800 metres @ $125/m all up). The total estimated cost to 
complete the.  The total estimated cost to complete the exploration is CDN$202,000, 
not including HST. 

RC drilling should include 4 holes within the Duma Point Property to test manganese 
oxide occurrences at the head of Duma Point and northeast of White Wash; 8 drill holes 
at Dubinky Well to test the historic Gustavus (present day DW #34 and DW #36 claims), 
and Autotruck No.2 and Autotruck No.1 occurrences to the east; 4 drill holes within the 
Moab Fault Property to test the two zones high grade manganese mineralization 
identified during the 2012 rock geochemical program;  and 4 holes within the Flat Iron 
Property to test the northwest strike extent fault controlled manganese mineralization 
within the FL #5 claim.  The final location of RC drill holes should be based, but not 
contingent, on the results of the recommended geologic mapping, rock grab and chip 
sampling and ground geophysical surveys.

4 Property Description and Location 

The Utah Manganese Properties include four separate Properties (Duma Point, Dubinky 
Well, Moab Fault and Flat Iron) consisting of 150 mineral claims totalling 1,250 hectares 
(ha) held 100% by Utah Manganese, a wholly owned subsidiary of 0939181 B.C. Ltd. 
(Table 1).  On October 25, 2012, Oakmont entered into a Share Exchange Agreement 
(SEA) with 0939181 B.C. Ltd. (the "Target"), subject to regulatory approval, whereby 
Oakmont can earn a 100% interest in Properties.  The Properties are located within 
southeast Utah (Figure 1).  The Duma Point, Dubinky Well and Moab Fault properties 
are located between 50 and 20 kilometres (km) northwest of the city of Moab, Grand 
County, Utah, while the Flat Iron Property is located 25 km south of Moab within San 
Juan County (Figure 2). 

The Duma Point Property occurs within the Green River SE and Dee Pass 1:24,000 
scale United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle topographic map 
sheets; and with reference to the BLM Government Land Office Grid system, within  
Township (T) 23 South (S) / Range 17 and 18 East (E).  The Dubinky Well Property 
occurs within the Dubinky Wash 7.5 minute quadrangle and T24S / R18E.  The Moab 
Fault Property occurs within the Merrimac Butte 7.5 minute quadrangle and T24S / 
R20E.  The Flat Iron Property occurs within the Las Sal Junction 7.5 minute quadrangle 
and T28S / R22E and R23E.   

Pursuant to the terms of the SEA, as consideration for the purchase of 100% of the 
issued and outstanding shares of the Target, Oakmont has agreed to issue 3,352,000 
common shares of the Company to the shareholders of the Target.  There are no other 
royalties, back-in rights, payments, or other agreements and encumbrances to which 
the Properties are subject.    

As Oakmont and the Target are non-arm's length parties, the proposed Transaction will 
be a Non-Arm's Length Qualifying Transaction, as defined in the policies of the 
Exchange. Accordingly, the Transaction will be subject to approval of the shareholders 
of the Company. Each of Oakmont's current directors are shareholders of the Target. 
Fraser Atkinson, a British Columbia resident, is the controlling shareholder and sole 
director of the Target. Gavin Harrison is the Vice President of Operations and Bill

*UMI - Utah Manganese Inc. 

In the state of Utah, most public lands administered by the BLM and the U.S. Forest 
Service (USFS) are open to location of mining claims.  Privately owned lands, trust 
lands, sovereign lands, national parks and monuments, as well as Indian and military 
reservations are excluded from location of mining claims.  Special procedures apply to 
certain Federal lands where the surface is patented, and the minerals are reserved or 
disposed under the Stock Raising Homestead Act (SRHA) of December 29, 1916.  
Mining claims must be located on lands where the U.S. has ownership of the mineral 
rights. No claims can be staked on lands transferred out of Federal ownership where 
the minerals were not reserved to the U.S. On lands open to location.  The availability of 
specific lands can be confirmed by consulting the records of the Federal Land Office, 
U.S. Bureau of Land Management in Salt Lake City.   

The Utah Manganese Properties and the majority of land surrounding the current 
Properties are within Federal Public lands administered by the BLM and are open to 
location of mining claims. 

The location of lode mining claims in Utah requires physical ground staking.  The 
maximum dimensions of single claim cannot exceed 1600 feet (488 metres, "m") x 600 
feet (183 metres), or approximately 22.04 acres (8.92 ha).  All mining claims are 
initiated by erecting a conspicuous monument at the place of discovery and posting 
thereon a Notice of Location (NOL). The NOL must contain: the name of the claim;  the 
name and address of the locator of the claim;  the date of location; the number of linear 
feet claimed in length along the course of the lode each way from the point of discovery, 
with the width claimed on each side of the center of the lode; the general course of the 
lode; and location of the claim by reference to some natural object or permanent 
monument as will identify the claim. 
 
Claims must be recorded (Record Notice), by submitting a completed NOL form, to both 
the county BLM Recorder's Office (Moab) within 30 days, and the BLM State Office 
(Salt Lake City) within 90 days. Prior to recordation, the claim/site must be staked on 
the ground (Location Date).  Fees for a NOL for a new claim include a processing fee of 
$15.00 per claim, a location fee (recording fee) $34.00 per claim, and a $140.00 claim 
maintenance fee for the assessment year in which the claim is located.  Subsequent to 
recording of a new claims, and to maintain the claim in good standing, on or before 
September 1 annual claim maintenance fees of $140 per claim. 
 
The Utah Manganese Properties are currently subject to annual claim maintenance fees 
of USD $21,000.

In Utah, mineral exploration activates that result in surface disturbance requires 
submission of a Notice of Intention to Conduct Exploration to the county BLM and Utah 
Department of Natural Resources Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (UDOGM).   These 
activates may include, but are not limited to: sinking shafts; tunneling, drilling holes and 
digging pits or cuts; building of roads, and other access ways.  The application must 
describe in detail: the proposed exploration, estimated surface disturbance, 
environmental and cultural resource protection measures, and restoration/reclamation 
plan.  Following submission of the application, BLM will notify the claimant of any 
deficiencies or if approved the BLM field office will determine bond amount, prepare 
necessary environmental documents, and estimate the reclamation cost for the plans. 

On August 20, 2012, Utah Manganese submitted a Notice of Intention to Conduct 
Exploration.  Approval for completion of a 20-hole reverse circulation drill program, via 
four sites within the Duma Point and Dubinky Well properties from was received from 
BLM on September 12, 2012.  The permit is valid for two years and required Utah 
Manganese to post a USD $17,400 reclamation security with UDOGM sufficient to 
cover the cost of reclamation.  An additional two-year extension can be obtained by 
notifying BLM prior to expiry or the initial term.  BLM notification is required 48 hours 
before commencement of exploration activities and 48 hours before commencement of 
reclamation activities. 

Additional exploration beyond the scope of the existing permit requires BLM/UDOGM 
approval.  Utah Manganese currently does not hold permits for surface disturbing 
exploration activities within the Moab Fault and Flat Iron properties.   

There exist no environmental liabilities to which the properties are subject. The author is 
unaware of any other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the 
right or ability to perform work on the Properties. 

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 

The Duma Point, Dubinky Well and Moab Fault properties are located between 50 and 
20 kilometres (km) northwest of the city of Moab, Grand County, Utah, while the Flat 
Iron Property is located 25 km south of Moab within San Juan County (Figure 2).  Moab, 
inhabited by about 5,046 people (2000 census), is the closest large centre to the 
Properties with accommodations, police, hospital, drilling, heavy equipment, airport 
services, and personnel for mining operations.  High voltage power lines originating 
from a coal fired generating plant near Price, Utah trend southeast and pass within 8 km 
of the Duma Point and Dubinky Well Properties, through the southeast corner of the 
Moab Fault Property, and 6 km east of the Flat Iron Property.   

The Duma Point Property is accessed by travelling north from Moab on U.S. Route 191 
to Crescent Junction, then west along Interstate 70 to Floy, and exiting south on the 
gravel Ruby Ranch Rd to Duma Point; a distance of approximately 80 km.  The Dubinky 
Well Property is accessed by travelling north from Moab on U.S. Route 191, west along 
State Route 313, and north along the gravel Dubinky Well Rd (which passes north 
through the centre of the Property); a distance of 45 km.  The Moab Fault Property is 
accessed by travelling north from Moab along U.S. Route 191 and west along Cotter 



 

Technical Report on the Utah Manganese Inc. Properties, Utah, USA

Mine Rd; a distance of 20 km.  U.S. Route 191 that passes along the eastern boundary 
of the Flat Iron Property a distance of 30 km south of Moab.  

Networks of rough four-wheel-drive accessible roads facilitate travel within the 
Properties. 

Elevations with the Duma Point Property range from between 1,506 m east of Duma 
Point to approximately 1,300 m at the base of gullies along the western margin of the 
claims.  In the south, the Property covers a broad plateau having an elevation of 
approximately 1,400 m forming Duma Point, and extending north along a west facing 
line of escarpment. 

The Dubinky Well claims cover a broad plateau at an elevation of 1,660 m.  Along the 
western margin of the claims, a steep cliff falls to an elevation of approximately 1,500 m.  
The focus of historic exploration was concentrated along the southern margin of the 
Property, where a south facing moderate line of escarpment drops 20 to 30 m, to an 
elevation of 1,630 m. 

Topography within the Moab fault Property is moderate with elevations ranging from 
1,370 m within the southeast claims, rising abruptly to 1,480 m along the southwest 
Property boundary immediately west of the Moab Fault trace. 

The Flat Iron Property slopes gently northeast dropping from an elevation of 1,700 m in 
the southwest corner to 1,600 m in the northeast where it is transected by the northwest 
trending valley of Muleshoe Wash. 

The climate in southeast Utah is arid with hot summers and cool winters and evenly 
spread precipitation, approximately 25 millimetres (mm) per month and 229 mm 
annually. The temperatures in the winter will range from 5.8 degrees Celsius ("°C") to -
7.7°C, in the summer months the temperature will vary from a maximum of 36.8°C to a 
minimum of 17.2 °C. Vegetation is sparse consisting of low growing desert type plants. 
There are various springs and seasonal streams located near the Properties however; 
diamond drilling operations will require use of a water truck. The Dubinky Well Property 
is located 1 km from the Dubinky water well.  The Green River lies 8 to 10 km west of 
the Duma Point and Dubinky Well Properties.  The Colorado River cuts the Moab Valley 
15 km southeast of the Moab Fault Property; and Springs Creek, fed by Kane Springs, 
lies 5 km to the north of the Flat Iron Property. 

The Utah Manganese Properties and the majority of land surrounding the current 
Properties are within undeveloped Federal Public lands administered by the BLM.  
Surface rights to support mining operations, potential tailings storage areas, potential 
waste disposal sites, and processing plants within and surrounding the Properties are 
also administered by the BLM and are obtained in the same manner as lode claim.

6 History 

The earliest government reports of manganese oxide mineralization in southeast Utah 
were made by Harder (1910) who briefly described manganese occurrences of the Little 
Grand District; principally the deposits of the Colorado Fuel & Iron Company (C.F. & I.) 
(Figure 4).  The Little Grand District is an approximately 25 km long narrow belt 
containing numerous manganese deposits and occurrences exposed along the 
northwest trending line of outcrop of the Upper and Middle Jurassic Summerville and 
Morrison Formations.  The district includes the C.F. & I. deposits in the north and 
extends southeast through Duma Point as far south as the Dubinky Well deposits.  
Subsequent investigations by Pardee (1921) provide a description of the mining history, 
production, geology and mineralization of the principal manganese deposits of the Little 
Grand District, including the C.F. & I., Duma Point, and The Needles (now known as 
Dubinky Well area).  Baker et al. (1952) represents the principal reference on the 
manganese deposits of the Little Grand District, and includes detailed descriptions of 
the production history, geology and mineralization for the majority of known manganese 
oxide occurrences in the Little Grand District and southeast Utah. 

According to Pardee (1921), "Manganese ore was first mined in Utah in 1901.  In that 
year deposits in the Little Grand District, southeast of Green River, were exploited by 
the Colorado Fuel & Iron Co., which shipped a quantity of ore to the furnaces at Pueblo 
and Chicago"..."At times thereafter a little ore was produced, but mining was 
unprofitable, and for several years after 1906 the district was idle.  In 1915 rising prices 
cause by the war stimulated the district to renewed activity."  In May 1918, the Green 
River Mining Co., the Needles Mining Co., and J.B. Fonder were reportedly producing 
about 500 tons of manganese ore a month; however, the market declined shortly after 
signing of the armistice in November 1918 (Pardee, 1921). 

After World War I, Baker et al. (1952) reported, "the Little Grand District and other 
manganese districts in southeastern Utah remained idle until 1939, when the outbreak 
of World War II brought about an increasing need for domestic sources of manganese.  
In 1939-40, small scale development work was done on many of the deposits"..."At 
several deposits a few tons of ore were mined an placed in stockpiles, but as of August 
1940 shipments or ore consisted mainly and perhaps entirely of samples taken to 
determine the suitability of the ore for metallurgical purposes". 

6.1 Deposits of the Colorado Fuel & Iron Company Mine and Other Deposits on the West Side of 
White Wash 

The C.F. & I. deposits occur about 4 km to the west of the Duma Pont Property, on the 
west side of white wash.  Manganese oxide mineralization occurs over and 
approximately 3 x 2 km area and other historically mined occurrences extend a further 2 
km east along the main line of escarpment.  Historic mining exploited unconsolidated 
looses surface deposits and flat-lying near surface deposits, then known as "blanket 
veins", associated with limestone beds (Pardee, 1921). 

During the years 1903, 1904 and 1906 the C.F. & I. mine produced somewhat less than 
4,000 tons, (3,630 tonnes) or ore.  The Green River Mining Co subsequently leased the 
mine and from between 1915 and 1918 production, principally from the C.F. & I. mine

and a number of other deposits, totalled about 8,000 tons (7,260 tonnes) (Pardee, 
1921). 

On the Seven Up group of claims, 1.6 km to the east of the C.F. & I. mine, the Burgess 
Mineral Co. produced a small quantity of ore during 1917.  Here manganese oxide ore 
occurs as replacement bodies hosted within a thin limestone bed (Pardee, 1921).   

On the Black Bear Group of claims, a further 1.6 km to the east, J.B. Fonder mined ore 
in 1918, and several carloads were produced prior to that time (Pardee, 1921).  A 13 to 
15 centimetre (cm) thick blanket deposit was mined via a 3 to 15 m wide open-cut over 
a length of 213 m.  A representative samples of 30 tons (27 tonnes) of ore containing 
51.3% metallic manganese reportedly returned 78.2% manganese-dioxide (MnO2)  
(Pardee, 1921).   

6.2 Deposits at Duma Point and the Northeast Side of White Wash 

Numerous manganese oxide occurrences have been documented over an 
approximately 3 x 2 km are on both the west and east side of Duma Point, within the 
present day Duma Point Property.  A second cluster of manganese showings, also 
within the present day Duma Point Property, occurs a distance of 3 km north of Duma 
Point proper along the main line of escarpment.  Manganese mineralization occurs as 
blanket veins hosted within a bed of limestone along the upper terrace; and hosted 
within sandstone beds of the lower terrace 15 m below.  In 1915 and 1917, Elmer & 
McWilliams and in the Burgess Mineral Co. developed several ore bodies at Duma 
Point producing a total of 850 tons of ore (770 tonnes).  Mixed ore samples from these 
occurrences, reported by the Needles Mining Co., returned an average greater than 
45% manganese and 0.20% copper (Pardee, 1921). 

At the north end of the Duma Point claims, numerous small manganese deposits hosted 
within the Middle Jurassic Summerville Formation are irregularly distributed along the 
line of escarpment over a 1.6 km east-west trend.  Baker et al. (1952) indicates that 
there are two main deposits in this group.  The first, located within the DP #5 claim, can 
be traced in outcrop for a distance of 180 m and reaches a maximum thickness of 0.45 
m and pinches out towards the both ends.  Two adjacent samples reported by Baker et 
al. (1952) returned values of 15.4% manganese at the thickest point of the mineralized 
zone, and 41.9% manganese from the base of the mineralized horizon. A the second 
deposit, within the DP #22 claim, a blanket vein having a maximum thickness of 0.4 m 
and averaging 0.15, has been exposed in a 180 m long, 3 to 15 m wide, open cut.  
Mineralization replaces the host limestone bed, and apparently ranges from pure 
pyrolusite to disseminated manganese oxide mixed with varying amounts of limestone. 

Within the historic Suez claim, on the west side of Duma Point about 1.6 km north of its 
end (probably in the area of the present day DP #51 through DP #55 claims), a 2.5 to 
15 cm blanket of fine-grained pyrolusite ore was developed over a 6 x 15 m area 
(Pardee, 1921).   

A carload of ore returning 84.5% MnO2 was reportedly mined from the U.S. German 
group of claims by the Burges Mineral Co.. Manganese mineralization consisting of 2.5 
to 10 cm blanket of fine-grained pyrolusite hosted within a thin limestone bed was 



 

Technical Report on the Utah Manganese Inc. Properties, Utah, USA

produced from several 3 to 15 m wide shallow cuts over a distance of 300 m.  The exact 
location of the historic U.S. German group is unknown, though it likely occurs between 
the present day DP #54 and DP #42 claims (Pardee, 1921). 

At the Duma group of claims, within the present day DP #44 claim, an 8 to 10 cm 
blanket of fine-grained pyrolusite was mined over a 3 to 13 m width and distance of 90 
m (Pardee, 1921).  Similarly, on the east side of Duma Point (probably within the DP 
#46 claim), small quantities of ore were reportedly mined along the lower terrace from 
thin blanket veins within the West Point group and the Monday claim (Pardee, 1921). 

Within the Red Rock claim, several carloads of ore were reportedly produced along the 
upper terrace from a 4.6 m diameter, 0.60 to 0.90 m thick, irregular of limestone hosted 
manganese oxide mineralization.  Similar mineralization reportedly occurs on the 
historic Fairplay, Black Rock and Black Queen claims immediately east of Duma Point 
(Pardee, 1921); although their exact location, and that of the Red Rock claim is not 
known. 

6.3 Deposits at Dubinky Well 

Within southern Dubinky Well Property claims, historically exploited manganese oxide 
occurrences hosted within the Middle Jurassic Summerville Formation occur over a 2.5 
km east-west trending zone. 

On the Gustavus claim, within the present day DW #34 and DW #36 claims, 
manganese mineralization occurs over a distance of 90 m.  Within this zone open cuts 
have been developed on two main blanket veins; the largest having dimensions of 9 x 
18 m and a thickness of 1.5 m, the second covering a 6 x 24 m area with a thickness of 
0.6 m; and two smaller 30 cm thick occurrences. 

A distance of 500 m to the east, on the Autotruck No. 2 claim, open cuts over a distance 
of 75 m expose and undulating blanket vein averaging about 30 cm in thickness.  Within 
the Autotruck No. 1 claim, a further 500 m to the east, numerous pits within an area of 
approximately 80 x 100 m expose blanket veins between 0.15 to 0.60 m in thickness. 

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Utah Manganese Properties are located in southeastern Utah, within the 
Pennsylvanian to Cretaceous Paradox Basin.  The Paradox Basin is a large asymmetric 
approximately 190 x 265 km, northwest-southeast trending intracratonic foreland basin.  
The basin was developed along the southwestern margin of the Uncompahgre uplift 
during mid-Pennsylvanian through early Permian time in response to the Ancestral 
Rocky Mountain (ARM) orgogenic event (Barbeau, 2003).  The basin was subsequently 
modified and obscured by later tectonic events, primarily the Laramide orogreny 
(Condon, 1997). 



 

Technical Report on the Utah Manganese Inc. Properties, Utah, USA

7.1.1 Pennsylvanian 

The earliest rocks of the Paradox Basin, dolostone, black shale, anyhydrite, halite and 
other salts belonging to the Pennsylvanian Paradox Formation of the Hermosa Group, 
formed as a result of cyclical desiccation and flooding of the basin during glacio-eustatic 
sea level changes.  To the southwest within the basin Paradox Formation evaporates 
grade into shallow shelf carbonates.  To the northeast they interfinger with undivided 
coarse clastic sediments shed southwestward from the Uncompahgre uplift belonging of 
the Pennsylvanian-Permian Cutler Group.  Within the central part of the basin, offshore 
carbonate-dominated wedge sediments and proximal terrestrial fan systems of the 
Upper Pennsylvanian Honaker Trail Formation (Hermosa Group) overlie the Paradox 
Formation, and were deposited under similar cyclic conditions (Trudgill, 2010).  

7.1.2 Permian 

Deposition of the overlying Cutler Group records subsequent filling of the basin that 
probably began as a series of alluvial fans and debris flows along the margin of the 
Uncompahgre uplift (Condon, 1997 and Barbeau, 2003).  Undivided dominantly coarse 
fluvial Uncompahgre proximal Pennsylvanian-Permian Cutler Group sediments are 
succeeded to the southwest by shallow marine influenced beds of the Lower Cutler.  
Lower Cutler rocks are overlain by thick eolian sandstone of the Cedar Mesa 
Sandstone; mixed fluvial-eolian red siltstone, sandstone, mudstone and limestone 
nodule conglomerate of the Organ Rock Formation; and greyish-white eolian sandstone 
of the White Rim Sandstone (Condon, 1997).  

7.1.3 Triassic 

Following Permian time, the Uncompahgre uplift had eroded to the point that it was no 
longer a sediment source and a period of erosion and non-deposition prevailed into the 
Early Triassic.   

The Lower and Upper Triassic Moenkopi and Chinile Formations unconformably overlie 
the Cutler Group and comprise red-orange to brown sandstone-siltstone and lesser 
conglomerate or mudstone deposited within mixed marine-terrestrial, and alluvial plain 
environments, respectively (Doelling, 2002 and Stewart, et al. 1972).  The Moenkopi 
Formation is widespread across the Colorado Plateau, although absent across the 
Uncompahgre uplift.  In contrast, the Chinile Formation is present across the 
Uncompahgre uplift, indicating it was buried by Upper Triassic time (Trudgill, 2010). 

7.1.4 Jurassic 

The Early Jurassic Glen Canyon Group uncomfortably overlies the Triassic succession 
and comprises, from oldest to youngest; thick cliff forming aeolian dune deposits of the 
Wingate Sandstone; ledge and bench forming fluvial sandstone of the Kayenta 
Formation; and aeolian dune and local interdune limestone rocks of the Navajo 
Sandstone (Trudgill, 2010 and Chan et al., 2000). 

Basal chert-pebble conglomerate, sandstone and sabkha deposits of the Page 
Formation rest unconformably on the Glen Canyon Group (Chan et al., 2000).  The 
Page Formation is conformable with the overlying Middle Jurassic Entrada Sandstone, 



 

Technical Report on the Utah Manganese Inc. Properties, Utah, USA

made up of the Dewey Bridge and Slick Rock Members.  Red interbedded sabkha-
aeolian sandstones and siltstones of the Dewey Bridge Member are overlain by thick 
sabkha (locally tar saturated) and wet aeolian dune deposits of the Slick Rock Member.  
Locally bleached white transitional beach to aeolian dune deposits of the Moab 
(Tongue) Member of the Curtis Formation pinch out to the southwest, and 
unconformably overlie Entrada rocks.  Thinning Moab Tongue sandstones grade 
westward into marine and marginal-marine Curtis Formation thin-bedded argillaceous 
and calcareous sandstone and siltstone (Chan et al., 2000, and Doelling, 2002). 

The Entrada Sandstone is conformably overlain by thin-bedded, non-calcareous red 
coastal-fluvial sandstone of the Middle Jurassic Summerville Formation.  Limey and 
cherty siltstone-sandstone beds of the Tidwell Member of the Morrison formation 
represent a marine incursion and unconformably overlie the Summerville Formation.  
Near Moab, the two units are often thin and are referred to as the Summerville-Tidwell 
interval (Chan et al., 2000). The remaining units of the Morrison Formation are 
conformable and include; light yellow-gray sandstone, siltstone and mudstone of the 
Upper Jurassic Salt Wash Member; and variegated (purple, green, white or orange) 
mudstone, sandstone, conglomerate and limestone of the Upper Jurassic Brushy Basin 
Member (Doelling, 2002).

Mixed continental, lacustrine and fluvial sediments of the Cretaceous Cedar Mountain 
formation, principally green to variegated mudstone, brown-gray sandstone, 
conglomerate and limestone, unconformably overlie the Morrison Formation.   

7.1.5 Structural Geology 

The northern part of the Paradox Basin has been termed the "Paradox fold and fault 
belt".  It consists of a series of approximately parallel northwest-southeast trending 
faults, anticlines, and synclines.  Within the Moab Valley, and to the northeast within 
Salt, Castle and Fischer valleys, salt from the Paradox Formation has risen diapirically 
to the surface.  Salt dissolution has resulted in down-faulting and the graben formation 
along anticlinal crests, exposing Paradox Formation rocks in the core, and locally 
preserving younger Cretaceous rocks within the cores of synclines or as collapsed 
blocks within anticlines (Condon, 1997). 

It is interpreted that a series of northeast trending basement-involved normal faults, 
likely related to crustal flexure associated with foredeep-forebulge development in 
response to the ARM orgogenic event, caused localized thickness variations within the 
Paradox Formation.  Sediment loading during deposition of the overlying Honaker Trail 
and Cutler Formations resulted in the initiation of southwestward salt flow, development 
of salt pillows and ultimately salt walls; their location controlled by the presence of 
buttressing normal faults.  Numerous northeast-southwest oriented structural 
lineaments delineated by well logs and seismic data, and interpretation of gravity and 
magnetic data, appear to have exhibited similar control on thickness of the Paradox 
Formation (Trudgill, 2010). 

With continued Cutler Formation sedimentation and buttressing by normal faults to the 
southwest, broad asymmetric salt walls developed.  Vertical rise and thickening of salt 
walls produced a more symmetrical geometry and formation of minibasins on either 
side. With the close of Cutler Group sedimentation salt walls reached their present day 
widths (Trudgill, 2010). 

Salt structures were subsequently buried by up to 2 km of post-Triassic sediments 
(Chan et al., 2000).  Beginning in Late Eocene time (approximately 37 million years 
ago) and continuing to the present, uplift and erosion resulted in salt collapse and the 
formation of graben structures along the Moab, Salt, Castle and Fischer valleys (Nuccio 
and Condon, 2000).   

7.2 Property Geology 

7.2.1 Duma Point and Dubinky Well Properties 

The Duma Point and Dubinky Well Properties lie approximately 10 km to the southwest 
of the fold axis of the shallowly northwest plunging Courthouse Syncline.  Within the 
properties, an upright sequence of Jurassic rocks dips 2 to 3 degrees to the north-
northwest along the southwest limb of the syncline (Baker et al, 1952).  Strata-bound 
manganese oxide mineralization is associated with thin limestone beds of the Middle 
Jurassic Summerville Formation and Tidwell Member of the Morrison Formation.  
Middle Jurassic rocks outcrop along a northwest tending line of escarpment along the

margin of Courthouse minibasin.  To the southwest, they are eroded and older rocks of 
the Glen Canyon Group are exposed. 

Within the Duma Point Property a northwest oriented line of escarpment exposes, from 
oldest to youngest: at low elevation, smooth weathering alternating reddish pink to 
salmon coloured beds of the Slick Rock Member of the Entrada sandstone; overlain by 
a slope forming section of laminated to medium bedded fine grained sandstone and 
siltstone of the Curtis and Summerville Formations; slope forming thin-bedded lavender, 
maroon and light grey siltstone, thin to thick-bedded fine grained sandstone and thin-
bedded limestone of the Tidwell Member of the Morrison Formation; and plateau 
forming light yellow-gray sandstone, mudstone and siltstone of the Salt Wash Member 
of the Morrison Formation (Doelling, 2002). 

Within the Dubinky Well Property, a lower relief dominantly south-facing line of 
escarpment exposes at its base: smooth weathering light yellow-gray massive Moab 
Tongue sandstone; overlain by an undivided section of the Tidwell Member of the 
Morrison Formation and Summerville Formation; and plateau forming Salt Wash rocks 
(Doelling, 2002). 

7.2.2 Moab Fault Property 

Within the Moab Fault Property, the moderately-steeply northeast dipping Moab Fault, 
the northwest extension of the Moab anticline, forms a half-graben structure.  To the 
northeast within the structural hangingwall and Cretaceous rocks of the Cedar Mountain 
Formation are preserved.  To the southwest, within the footwall, shallowly northwest 
dipping units intersect the Moab Fault at an oblique angle exposing a northwest 
younging section comprising isolated outcrops of the Upper Triassic Chinile, Lower 
Jurassic Wingate sandstone; and Lower to Middle Jurassic rocks, and Lower to Middle 
Jurassic Kayenta Formation, Navajo Sandstone, Dewey Bridge and Slick Rock 
Members (Doelling, 2002).  

Within the fault, variegated shale of the Morrison Formation dips steeply northeast, but 
50 m to the northeast it dips shallowly to the northwest.  Manganese oxide 
mineralization occurs as lenses within clay gouge of the fault (Baker et al. 1952). 

7.2.3 Flat Iron Property 

Somewhat analogous to the Moab Fault Property, northeast dipping normal faults within 
the Flat Iron Property represent the northwest extension of Lisbon Valley anticline.  In 
contrast to the Moab Fault Property that is transected by a single well-defined fault 
zone; at least two primary and numerous parallel subsidiary northwest trending fault 
zones are present within the Flat Iron Property.  Within the hangingwall rocks of the 
Dewy Bridge Member are locally preserved (Doelling, 2004).  Fault-hosted iron and 
manganese oxide mineralization occurs within rocks of the Navajo Sandstone, which 
underlie the majority of the Property dip shallowly to the northeast.

7.3 Mineralization 

Manganese oxide mineralization within the Properties occurs as lens-like strata-bound 
replacement bodies and associated manganese nodules of variable thickness and strike 
extent (Duma Point and Dubinky Well properties); or as fault gouge hosted lenses 
(Moab Fault Property) and brittle fault hosted vein-fracture infill.  Strata-bound bodies 
often occur proximal to or may partially-completely replace thin limestone or sandy 
limestone beds, primarily within the Middle Jurassic Summerville Formation and 
overlying Tidwell Member of the Morrison Formation (Pardee, 1921 and Baker et al., 
1952). 

A detailed description of known mineralization for each of the Utah Manganese 
Properties is provided below. 

7.3.1 Duma Point Property 

Two groups of manganese oxide occurrences are present within the Duma Point 
Property.  The northernmost group, located northeast of White Wash, within the 
northern claims, occurs along a northwest trending line of escarpment over a distance 
of approximately 1.7 km.  The southernmost group of occurrences are distributed along 
the west and east sides of Duma Point proper, over a distance of about 4 km. 

Northeast of White Wash, the Summerville Formation and Tidwell Member of the 
Morrison Formation form terraced cliffs of approximately 50 m in height.  Baker et al. 
(1952) mapped 17 manganese occurrences within bench forming sandstone and 
limestone at the top of the Tidwell Member (Upper Bench), and bench forming 
sandstone of the Summerville Formation (Lower Bench).  There are two main 
occurrences in this group.  At the first main occurrence, in the DP #5 claim, strata-
bound manganese mineralization (chiefly pyrolusite) can be traced for about 180 m in 
outcrop exposed on southward projecting spur.  On the west side of the spur, 
mineralization reaches a maximum thickness of 0.45 m, tapering to a few centimetres at 
its edge.  Two adjacent samples reported by Baker et al. (1952) returned values of 
15.4% manganese at the thickest point of the mineralized zone, and 41.9% manganese 
from the base of the mineralized horizon.  At the second main occurrence, 1,200 m to 
the east, within the DP #22 claim, strata-bound mineralization having a maximum 
thickness of 0.4 m and averaging 0.15 m, occurs in a 180 m long, 3 to 15 m wide, open 
cut.  Mineralization replaces the limestone of the Upper Bench, and ranges from pure 
pyrolusite to disseminated manganese oxide mixed with varying amounts of limestone.  
A distance of 200 m the west, mineralization of similar thickness is exposed within a 60 
m long, 6 m wide open cut.   Manganese oxide mineralization between the two main 
occurrences, and to their west and east, is widely spaced and is generally thin ranging 
from between 3 to 8 cm (Baker et al., 1952). 

At Duma Point proper, the stratigraphic section is the same a within the northern claims, 
with red-brown sandy shale or shaley sandstone of Summerville Formation forming the 
Lower Bench, which are unconformably overlain gray-brown sandy shale, sandstone 
and thin limestone beds of the Tidwell Member of the Upper Bench (Baker et al., 1952).  
Baker et al. (1952) mapped 45 strata-bound and nodular manganese oxide occurrences 
around the head of Duma Point.  The majority of mineralization is hosted near the top of 



 

Technical Report on the Utah Manganese Inc. Properties, Utah, USA 

26 
 
 

 

the Upper Bench, although isolated occurrences of mineralisation are present 
throughout both benches.   The majority of the occurrences are thin 5 to 8 cm thick 
(locally up to 20 cm) strata-bound lenses of massive to semi-massive pyrolusite 
exposed over distances of 3 to 15 m (locally up to 60 m).  Nodules of manganese oxide 
commonly mark the mineralized horizon along strike of lenses, and may also occur in 
rocks immediately beneath the lenses.  

7.3.2 Dubinky Well Property 

At the Dubinky Well Property strata-bound manganese oxide replacement bodies are 
hosted within upper thin bedded sandstone and sandy shale of the Middle Jurassic 
Summerville Formation.  Mineralization occurs at a position of about 3 to 9 m above the 
top of the underlying Moab Tongue sandstone.  Individual lenses of manganese occur 
intermittently within this stratigraphic horizon over a distance of approximately 1,400 m; 
although they are obscured beneath Quaternary sand dune cover for a distance of 400 
m.  

Pyrolusite, manganite and locally barite mineralization occur as strataform, and locally 
crosscutting bodies that pinch and swell along their length.  Individual lenses may have 
a thickness up to 30 cm of massive pyrolusite and calcite-barite.  At the main 
occurrence, single thick, and multiple thinner cm-scale lenses occur over a vertical 
interval of approximately 3.5 m (Baker et al., 1952). Here, manganese mineralization 
was historically explored in a number of bench cuts, and pits over a distance of 100 m.   

A distance of 400 m to the east of the main occurrence, manganese mineralization is 
exposed within a 8 m long x 2 m wide x 1 m deep trench on a sandy plateau. 
Manganese mineralization in the trench ranges from 6 to 30 cm in thickness.  A second 
trench 20 m long x 4 m wide trench exposes two manganese oxide lenses, the upper 
one 30 cm thick and the lower 20 cm thick, separated by a 1 m interval of weakly 
mineralized sandstone (Baker et al., 1952). 

A further 500 m to the east across Quaternary sand dune cover, a 10 to 30 cm thick 
manganese oxide lens is exposed in outcrop at the base of a shallow wash and within a 
number of shallow exploration pits excavated along a low-lying southeast trending line 
of outcrop over a distance of 300 m.  

7.3.3 Moab Fault Property 

Within the Moab Fault Property, manganese oxide mineralization occurs intermittently 
as pods and lenses enclosed by clay gouge zones along the fault.  The Moab fault dips 
moderately to steeply northeast and entrains isolated blocks of steeply northeast 
dipping variegated shale of the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation within 
hangingwall (Baker et al., 1952).  Further to the northeast, the shale dips shallowly to 
northwest suggesting drag folding and rotation of beds into the plane of the fault.  
Manganese mineralization within the Moab Fault may be related to flow of saline 
reducing fluids and deposition of iron and manganese within the fault (Chan et al, 2000); 
or possibly entrainment and remobilization of pre-existing manganese mineralization 
present within the Brushy Basin Member. 



 

Technical Report on the Utah Manganese Inc. Properties, Utah, USA 

27 
 
 

 

Mineralization within the fault is exposed within three parallel zones of trenching over a 
distance of 1 km, and consists mainly of pyrolusite and lesser calcite and iron carbonate 
up to 25 cm in width over lengths of up to 1 m.  Fragments of mined ore on surface are 
up to 46 cm in diameter (Baker et al., 1952).  

7.3.4 Flat Iron Property 

Faults cutting Early Jurassic Navajo Sandstone rocks within the Flat Iron Property host 
fracture controlled iron and manganese oxide mineralization.  The majority of 
mineralization occurs within two northwest trending, sub vertical to steeply northeast 
dipping brittle fault zones transect the claims spaced by approximately 500 m.  A 
number of parallel subordinate faults parallel the two main ones, and form an 
approximately 1km wide zone southwest stepping half-graben structure. 

Within the southernmost fault, gray-black manganese and iron oxide staining associated 
with narrow fracture zones cutting yellow-orange Navajo Sandstone can be traced over 
a distance of 300 m, although it is partly covered by Quaternary sand dunes.  At the 
centre of this zone an approximately 6 m long x 2 m wide x 3 m high open cut has been 
driven in parallel to the fault strike along the mineralized zone.  A two-metre wide zone 
of cut by discrete sub-vertical intersecting fractures, local cataclastic, and insitu breccias 
records brittle deformation.   

Here, annealed bleached white colour cm-scale fractures and mm-scale open fractures 
filled with colloform and bladed textured pyrolusite, cryptomelane (a potassium-
manganese oxide) and hematite mineralization occur (Chan et al., 2001).  Manganese 
and iron oxide alteration of wallrock extends outward on the metre scale where 
bleaching of wallrock is intense or centimetre scale along thin fractures. Where there 
are multiple intersecting fractures zones, manganese oxide staining occurs throughout.  
Within well-mineralized fractures, replacement massive fine-grained black manganese 
oxide and hematite occurs, locally extending outward preferentially along the aeolian 
stratification. 

Along the northernmost fault, manganese mineralization can be traced from near U.S. 
Route 191 (about 200 m southeast of the FI #15 claim outside the Property), northwest 
across a tributary of Muleshoe Wash over a distance of about 800 m.  Within the FI #15 
claim, pyrolusite calcite and iron-carbonate mineralization ranging from thin stringers to 
a vein up to 60 cm in width is exposed in a 15 m long x 1 m wide x 3 m deep trench 
(Baker et al., 1952).    

8 Deposit Types 

Manganese oxide mineralization within the Duma Point and Dubinky Well Properties 
occurs within thin-bedded, non-calcareous red coastal-fluvial sandstone Middle Jurassic 
Summerville, and limey-cherty tidal siltstone-sandstone beds of the Tidwell Member of 
the Morrison Formation.  Pyrolusite, manganite and rare cryptomelane-hallondite 
(hydrous barium-manganese oxides; Baker et al., 1952 and Chan et al., 2000), barite 
and calcite occur as massive to semi-massive strata-bound lenses that partly or 
completely replace limestone or sandy limestone beds.  Several thin cm-scale stacked 
lenses may occur over a narrow stratigraphic interval pinching out along strike.   Low-

grade mineralization also commonly occurs as irregular "nodules", manganese oxide 
cementing of quartz silt-sands grains, within or below the stratigraphic horizon 
containing the lenses.  Sediments underlying the mineralization may exhibit a mottled 
bleached white or tan colour present along thin elongate streaks a few metres below the 
mineralization. 

Within the Moab Fault Property, manganese mineralization occurs as massive to semi-
massive pods and lenses enclosed by clay gouge zones along the fault.  Mineralization 
may be related to fluid flow and deposition of iron and manganese within the fault (Chan 
et al, 2000); or possibly entrainment and remobilization of pre-existing manganese 
mineralization present within the Brushy Basin Member.  Given the presence of 
colloform and bladed open space infill textures, and manganese and iron oxide 
alteration of wallrock extending outward from fractures; mineralization within the Flat 
Iron Property more readily attributable fluid flow and deposition along brittle faults (Chan 
et al, 2000). 

Stratified basin margin manganese deposits are interpreted to form in a shallow marine 
environment along the margins of black shale basins (Cannon and Force, 1983; and 
Frakes and Bolton, 1984).  Under reducing anoxic (low Eh) conditions within a marine 
basin fractionation of iron to produce pyritic black shale results in the production of 
manganese-rich water from which a manganiferous precipitate can form in a more 
oxygenated portion of the basin (Force and Cannon, 1988).  

Given the presence of open space infill hydrothermal vein textures within the 
manganese oxide lenses, and the absence of iron fractioning black shales, the stratified 
basin margin model does not appear to explain the Utah Manganese occurrences.  
However, the mechanisms of manganese mobilization and deposition remain important. 

Chan et al. (2000) document bleaching of the Navajo and Moab Tongue sandstone, 
which underlie strata-bound manganese oxide lenses, because of iron loss due to 
hematite reduction.  Reduced, saline brines containing hydrocarbons, methane, organic 
acids or hydrogen sulphide derived from dissolution of Paradox Formation salt anticlines 
are interpreted to have travelled along the Moab Fault and laterally into permeable 
Navajo and Moab Tongue sandstone.  Subsequent deposition of iron and manganese 
occurs because of mixing with shallow Oxygenated groundwater.  40Ar/39Ar dating of 
cryptomelane within brittle faults at the Flat Iron Property returned a Late Oligocene (25-
20 Ma) age suggesting fluid flow and deposition of manganese mineralization, at least 
in part, due to uplift of the Colorado Plateau or nearby La Sal Mountains volcanism 
(Chan et al., 2001). 

Rocks in the Moab area reached maximum burial during the Late Eocene (37 Ma) and 
uplift and erosion has continued to the present.  Early oil generation from the Ismay-
Desert Creek interval began during Late Cretaceous (82 Ma) time, with significant oil 
generation beginning at 79 Ma and gas generation at 74 Ma.  The upper limit for 
petroleum preservation from the Ismay-Desert Creek interval occurred between 50 and 
40 Ma (Nuccio and Condon, 2000).   

These data indicate that hydrocarbon migration into Navajo and Moab Tongue 
sandstone could have occurred as early as the Late Cretaceous.

The distribution of bleaching patterns within Navajo Sandstone indicates that the most 
extensive regional bleaching occurs on eroded crest of Laramide faults and uplifts.  This 
suggests that Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary migration of buoyant reducing 
hydrocarbon fluid upward through faults and into reservoirs formed by Navajo 
Sandstone anticlinal uplifts (Beitler et al., 2003). 

Within the Duma Point and Dubinky Well properties, strata-bound manganese oxide 
lenses occur above the Slick Rock and Navajo sandstones.  The properties lie along the 
western limb of the Courthouse Syncline, which was a positive structural feature during 
Laramide time.  Reducing fluids likely migrated outward from the Moab Fault, and 
upward along the limb of the Courthouse Syncline, where interaction with oxidizing 
meteoric groundwater triggered precipitation of manganese oxide precipitation.   

Regionally, Laramide uplifts and earlier structural highs related to salt diapirism may 
control deposition of manganese oxide lenses.  Individual Triassic and Jurassic units 
have been shown to thin on the flanks of salt anticlines and to thicken in the synclines 
(Cater, 1970), suggesting that thinning of the stratigraphic section on the margins of the 
Courthouse syncline may have locally controlled manganese oxide precipitation. 

9 Exploration 

During 2010 and 2012, Utah Manganese Inc. completed a program of geologic mapping 
and rock grab sampling within the Utah Manganese Properties. Mapping focused on 
delineating the lower and upper contacts of the Middle Jurassic Summerville Formation 
and overlying Tidwell Member of the Morrison Formation, the principal host rocks to 
strata-bound manganese oxide mineralization within the Paradox Basin.  In addition, 
within the Summerville-Tidwell interval, efforts were made to verify and record the 
location of historically reported manganese occurrences.  Rock grab samples were 
collected to assess the concentration of predominantly high grade, massive to semi-
massive manganese oxide mineralization at a number of different occurrences.  In 
addition, select rock samples were collected as chip samples at measured vertical 
intervals across mineralized zones.  Rock samples collected during the 2010 program 
were submitted to ALS Minerals (ALS) Reno, Nevada; an International Standard 
Organization (ISO) 17025:2005 and ISO 9001:2008 accredited laboratory. Rock grab 
samples are generally representative of the highest grade mineralization at a given site. 
Rock chip over width samples are representative of the true width at specific locations 
and do not provide an estimate of the lateral (along strike) or down dip continuity of 
mineralization. 

To date Oakmont has not conducted any exploration within the Utah Manganese 
properties. 

Geologic mapping within the Duma Point and Dubinky Well properties defined the 
Summerville-Tidwell interval over an eight (8) km strike length and 282 ha area, and a 
total of 67 historic manganese occurrences were documented.  Within the Moab Fault 
Property mapping of historic trenches exposing manganese mineralization occurred 
over a 1 km strike length.

A total of 49 rock samples were collected from Dubinky Well, Moab Fault, and Flat Iron 
properties. An additional 16 rock grab samples collected from the Duma Point Property 
were not submitted for analysis.  As part of the Property visit, the author collected 2 rock 
grab samples from a single Duma Point manganese oxide occurrence for analysis; 
including a 61 cm representative split from RC drill hole DP-12-05 between 15.85 and 
16.46 m depth (Figure 7).  A discussion of the results of samples collected by the author 
is presented in the "Data Verification" section. 

Of the 49 rock samples, a total of 20 samples returned values greater than 20% 
manganese oxide (MnO), and up to 74.9% MnO (Table 2).  Summary results of rock 
grab and chip sampling are presented below.  Copies of the rock grab analytical 
certificates are provided in Appendix 1. 

9.1 Duma Point Property 

Geologic mapping within the Duma Point Property has defined the Summerville-Tidwell 
interval over a strike length of approximately six (6) km and a surface exposed area of 
280 ha (Figure 7).  The Summerville-Tidwell is the principal host to strata-bound 
manganese mineralization within the Paradox Basin.  A total of 61 manganese oxide 
mineralization occurrences were located within the mapped area establishing the 
presence of widespread mineralization and clear association with the Summerville-
Tidwell interval.  Based on the results of exploration within the Duma Point Property an 
approximately 0.80 m thick lens of manganese oxide mineralization exposed over a 10 
m distance was selected for drill testing (Figure 7). 

9.2 Dubinky Well Property 

Geologic mapping within the Dubinky Well Property defined the Summerville-Tidwell 
interval over an approximately two (2) km strike length and 12 ha area.  A total of 4 
principal strata-bound manganese oxide mineralization occurrences were located and 
mapped (Figure 8). 

Based on the results of geologic mapping, 21 rock samples were collected.  Vertical 
chip over true width samples comprising 11 samples were collected at the DW-COL#1 
and DW-COL#2 locations (Figure 8).  The two chip sample sites are separated by a 
distance of 300 m along strike.  Samples were collected at 1 foot (30.5 cm) intervals 
across the equivalent mineralized stratigraphic horizon within the Summerville 
Formation.  Sample DW-COL#1 returned values of 14.97% MnO over 0.91 m (3 feet); 
including 38.5% MnO over 30.5 cm (Table 2).   

To the west of DW-COL #1, three rock grab samples (DW-GRAB #8, #9 and #10) of 
intermittent manganese oxide mineralization within the same stratigraphic horizon 
collected over a distance of 130 m returned values ranging from 47.8% to 52.6% MnO 
(Table 2, Figure 8). 

Sample DW-COL#2 returned values of 6.54% MnO over 2.44 m (8 feet).  A sample of 
semi-massive manganese oxide collected 50 m to the east of DW-COL#2 returned 
values of 58.4% MnO (DW-GRAB #7).

The results of geologic mapping and rock sampling establish that lenses of manganese 
oxide occur intermittently over a distance of approximately 1,400 m, and the prospective 
Summerville-Tidwell interval occurs over a 2 km strike length (Figure 8).  Manganese 
mineralization is strata-bound and is interpreted to dip shallowly to the north-northeast 
along with sedimentary beds.   Mineralization is not continuous between sample sites; 
and is partially obscured by Quaternary talus or sand dune cover.  A number of thin 
(<50 cm thick) manganese oxide lenses may be present that bifurcate, pinch and swell 
or die out along strike.  Higher-grade manganese oxide lenses (for example sample 
DW-COL#1-0-1) are bound within a broader stratigraphic interval contain lower grade 
manganese nodules, and partial manganese replacement of silt and sand grain cement 
(for example DW-COL#2 interval).

9.3 Moab Fault Property 

A total of 10 rock grab samples were collected within the Moab Fault Property.  In 
addition, mapping of historic trenches was undertaken to provide base for future 
exploration (Figure 9).   

At the southeast end of the sampled area, a series of three collinear trenches occur 
over a distance of 200 m. Three samples collected from the southernmost trench 
returned values ranging from 34.7% to 64.1 % MnO (MF#3, #12 and #13).  A distance 
of 175 m to the northwest, sample MF #17 returned values of 74.95 MnO.  Malachite 
(copper carbonate-hydroxide) and iron-oxide staining was observed in association with 
fault the rocks. 

A second group of three historic trenches excavated over a distance of 150 m, occurs 
500 m to the northwest.  Two samples collected from these trenches returned values of 
38.6% and 25.8% MnO (samples MF#4 and #5). A distance of 1.8 km to the northwest, 
outside the Moab Fault claims, fracture filling and nodular manganese oxide 
mineralisation hosted within hangingwall sandstone of the Cedar Mountain Formation 
returned values of 37.6% MnO (sample MF #10B)   

Within the Moan Fault Property, geologic mapping and rock grab sampling has 
identified a series of historic pits and trenches exposing manganese pods and lenses 
within Brushy Basin Member rocks along the Moab Fault.  High-grade mineralization is 
exposed intermittently within clay gouge of the fault over a distance of 700 m, within a 
broader zone of low-grade manganese mineralization over a distance of 1 km.  
Individual mineralized zones have a width of approximately 2 to 3 m; however, the true 
width or grade of mineralization within these zones has not been established.  The 
results of sampling reflect the manganese oxide concentration of select high grade 
mineralized zones exposed within the fault zone. 

Manganese mineralization within the Moab Fault may be related to flow of saline 
reducing fluids and deposition of iron and manganese within the fault (Chan et al, 2000); 
or possibly entrainment and fault remobilization of pre-existing manganese 
mineralization present within the Brushy Basin Member. 

9.4 Flat Iron Property 

A total of 10 rock grab samples were collected within the Flat Iron Property by Utah 
Manganese.  Unfortunately, the GPS locations of these samples are unavailable.  
However, given that samples were collected from a number of known historic mineral 
occurrences (Figures 6 and 8) it is appropriate that the results be presented given that 
they provide a general indication of the manganese oxide tenor of the Property.  Of the 
10 samples collected within the Flat Iron Property, three returned values of greater than 
20% MnO, and up to 28% MnO (Table 2). 

The principal manganese oxide occurrence within the Flat Iron Property occurs within 
the FL #5 claim (Figure 2).  Here, manganese and iron oxide staining associated with 
narrow northwest trending fault-fracture zones cutting Navajo Sandstone can be traced 



 

Technical Report on the Utah Manganese Inc. Properties, Utah, USA

over a distance of 300 m, although it is partly covered by Quaternary sand dunes.  
Sampling of brittle fault-hosted manganese oxide mineralization exposed within a 
historic 6 m long x 2 m wide x 3 m high open cut by the author retuned values of 
19.79% MnO (sample 12KRP707, Table 4).  Within a smaller trench located 20 m to the 
southwest, manganese oxide cementing of aeolian sand grains extending from discrete 
fractures returned values of 10.62% MnO (12KRP708). 

Fracture controlled iron and manganese oxide mineralization within the Flat Iron 
Property occurs within two northwest trending, sub vertical fault zones that transect the 
Property spaced by approximately 500 m.  A number of subordinate faults parallel the 
two main ones, and form an approximately 1km wide southwest stepping half-graben 
structure. The exploration results to date have defined numerous high-grade fault 
controlled manganese oxide occurrences within the Property; however, it they do not 
suffienctly established its lateral (along strike) or down dip extent of mineralization.

10 Drilling 

Utah Manganese completed ten (10) reverse circulation (RC) drill holes on the Duma 
Point Property and nine (9) RC drill holes at Dubinky Well, totalling 663.9 m between 
the dates of October 8th to October 18th of 2012. The construction of a 3 km drill access 
road through steep terrain was required to access drill sites at Duma Point.  Drill hole 
locations are summarized in Table 4 below and shown in Figures 7 and 8.  Drill hole 
cross-sections are presented in Figures 11 and 12.   

Gavin Harrison of Utah Manganese directly supervised the RC program; and Mr. Brad 
Lindsay, B.Sc. (Geology) of Rock Logic Consulting LLC was retained by Utah 
Manganese to complete geologic logging and sampling of RC chips. 

A total of 27 RC chip drill samples for the Duma Point Property were submitted to ALS 
(Appendix 2).  As of the effective date of this report representative splits of RC chip 
samples for the Dubinky Well Property are being prepared for submission to ALS, and 
the results are expected before the end of March 2013.  Despite the absence of 
complete analytical data, it is the opinion of the author that the analytical results 
received to date advances the Project and provides significant geologic information with 
respect to the Properties including:   

1.) Definition of the stratigraphic sequence hosting mineralization (including thickness of 
overlying unmineralized lithologies, thickness of potentially mineralized Summerville-
Tidwell interval, depth and nature of the basal unmineralized formations); 2.) That 
mineralization occurs within stratigraphic and elevation equivalent horizons, which 
extend laterally in the subsurface; 3.) The response of manganese mineralization to RC 
drilling methods and the potential for sample recovery bias.       

RC drill chip analytical results returned for the Duma Point Property are significantly 
reduced in comparison to equivalent surface mineralization sampled by the author. Due 
to the nature of RC drilling, the sometimes poorly consolidated silt and sandstone 
hosting the mineralization, and in particular the brittle nature of high grade massive 
manganese oxide mineralization, a recovery bias due to loss of finely comminuted 
heavy fraction (which may preferentially include manganese oxides) may occur.  This 
may have impacted the accuracy and reliability of the drill results.

Mineralized zones exposed in outcrop are sub-parallel to sedimentary beds, which dip 
from between 2 to 3 degrees to the north-northeast.  Mineralization intersected within 
drill holes is assumed to have the same orientation. 

10.1 Duma Point Property 

RC drilling within the Duma Point Property comprised 10 holes, totalling 268.5 m from 
two setups separated by 100 m (Figure 7).  Drilling targeted an approximately 0.80 m 
thick lens of manganese oxide mineralization exposed over a 10 m distance underlying 
the Lower Bench manganese horizon (drill holes DP-12-01 through DP-12-05), and a 
surface zone of manganese mineralization 100 m to the northwest (Drill holes DP-12-06 
through DP-12-10).  Rock grab sampling of the manganese oxide lens by the author 
returned values of 23.2% MnO (sample 12KRP705).  Subsequent sampling by the 
author of a representative split from RC drill hole DP-12-05 containing visible 
manganese mineralization between 15.85 and 16.46 m depth (between 11.25 and 
11.69 m vertical depth) returned values of 3.0% MnO over 0.61 m (an inferred true 
width of 0.43 m; sample 12KRP706).  The depth of the sample within the drill hole 
corresponds to a horizontal distance of approximately 20 m from the outcrop face 
sampled (Figure 11). 

Visible manganese mineralization was observed within 9 of 10 Duma Point drill holes 
(Figure 11).  Within DP-12-03 and DP-12-05, black and grey manganese oxide 
replacement of red-pink siltstone and sandstone occurs between 15.24 and 17.07 m, 
(between 10.83 and 12.13 m vertical depth; and true width of 1.30 m) in both holes.  
Drill hole 12-DP-03 returned values of 1.3% MnO over 0.61 m (0.41 m true width), and 
drill hole DP-12-05 returned 1.6% MnO over 1.83 m (true width of 1.30 m)  This 
indicates manganese mineralization is, at least in part, continuous at a horizontal 
distance 20 m down dip from the mineralized lens exposed in outcrop.

At the second drill setup, visible manganese oxide mineralization was intersected at 
surface to a depth of 1.83 m within DP-12-07 returning values of  1.3% MnO over 1.22m 
(true width of 0.86 m); and a second 0.61 m (0.41 m true width) interval of manganese 
oxide mineralization returning values of 0.84% MnO was intersected at depth of 9.75 m 
(6.92 m vertical depth).  This lower intercept corresponds approximately with 
mineralization intersected within DP-12-03 and DP-12-05.  Similar near surface 
manganese oxide mineralization was intersected within all 5 drill holes at the second 
setup (Table 4 and Figure 11).   

 All 10 Duma Point drill holes intersected a near horizontal sequence, from surface, 
comprising approximately 6.5 m of sandstone and 11 m of locally manganiferous red to 
greenish-grey siltstone and shale (both Summerville Formation) overlying a loosely 
consolidated, basal red-orange to gray Slick Rock Member sandstone (Appendix 2).

10.2 Dubinky Well Property 

RC drilling within the Dubinky Well Property comprised 10 holes, totalling 395.3 m from 
two setups (Figure 8).  Drilling targeted the manganese oxide horizon associated with 
the undivided Tidwell Member-Summerville Formation interval.  Drill holes intersected a 
near horizontal sequence, from surface, comprising and approximately 1.5 m interval of 
light gray to red Salt Wash Member sandstone, underlain by 20 m of red-brown, purple 
or light gray siltstone and shale of the Tidwell-Summerville interval, followed by basal 
light red-brown to gray Moab Tongue sandstone (Figure 12).  Manganese oxide 
mineralization was observed within DW-12-01 at a vertical depth of 17.07 m over a 0.61 
m true width interval; a depth that corresponds approximately with mineralization 
exposed in outcrop on the slopes below, and sampled at the DW-COL-#1 site (Table 2) 

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

11.1 Rock Grab Samples 

Rock grab samples were placed into sealed plastic bags and then into a sealed poly 
woven (rice) bag for shipment to the analyzing laboratory immediately following 
collection.  The 49 rock samples collected in 2010 by Utah Manganese were submitted 
to ALS Minerals Reno, Nevada. The 2012 rock samples collected by the author were 
submitted to ALS in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. ALS is registered with

ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation from the Standards Council of Canada (SCC).  ALS 
is independent of Oakmont Capital Corp and Utah Manganese Inc. 

ALS reported nothing unusual with respect to the shipments, once received.  Oakmont 
Capital Corp, Utah Manganese Inc. and the author did not have control over the 
samples at all times during transport, and therefore cannot verify what happened to the 
samples from shipping up to the time they were received by ALS.  However, the author 
has no reason to believe that the security of the samples was compromised.  

The 49 rock samples collected by Utah Manganese were submitted to ALS for MnO 
determination by four-acid digestion and Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) (Mn-
AA62) analysis. Rock samples returning greater than 50% MnO, were subject to 
overlimit determination of MnO by whole rock X-Ray Fluorescence (ME-XRF06) 
analysis.  The 8 rock samples collected by the author during the Property visit were 
submitted to ALS for ME-XRF06 analysis.   

All samples were crushed using a jaw crusher to less than 2 millimetres (mm) with a 
70% minimum pass.  The samples were then split using a riffle splitter, and sample 
splits were further crushed using a ring mill pulveriser to less than 200 mesh (0.074 
mm) with a 85% minimum pass.  

Samples subject to for four acid Mn-AA62 analysis are digested with nitric, perchloric, 
hydrofluoric, and hydrochloric acids, and then evaporated to incipient dryness. 
Hydrochloric acid and de-ionized water is added for further digestion, and the sample is 
heated for an additional allotted time. The sample is cooled to room temperature and 
transferred to a volumetric flask (100 millilitres). The resulting solution is diluted to 
volume with de-ionized water, homogenized and the solution is analyzed AAS. 

During ME-XRF06 analysis, a 0.9 gram (g) calcined or ignited sample is added to 9.0 g 
of lithium borate flux (50%/50% Li2B4O7/LiBO2), mixed well and fused in an auto fluxer 
between 1,050-1,100 degrees Celsius (°C). A flat molten glass disc is prepared from the 
resulting melt. This disc is then analysed by XRF spectrometry. 

11.2 RC Drill Chip Samples 

At each sample interval, drill cuttings were collected into two bags at the bottom of a 
50/50 splitter.  After the first interval was drilled, the bags were quickly replaced to 
sample the next interval.  One half the split was collected in a cotton bag to be 
submitted to the lab, the other in a polyweave bag to hold for backup.  All sample bags 
were labeled with permanent marker with a sample ID number which corresponds to a 
ticket book.  A numbered ticket from the ticket book was placed in each cotton bag.  
Ticket books tie the numbered tickets placed in the bags to the drill holes.  Sample ID 
numbers from the tickets were also noted on a log form along with sample depths and a 
description of the lithology.  Representative chips were collected from the polyweave 
bags and washed using a flower sieve.  Lithology was described on log forms and chips 
were placed in trays labeled with drilled depth and sample number.  Once chip trays 
were filled and labeled, they were photographed and saved for future reference.    Chip 
samples were reviewed to identify zones of potential mineralization.

The 27 drill chip samples collected by Utah Manganese were submitted to ALS for MnO 
determination by whole rock X-Ray Fluorescence (ME-XRF06) analysis. All samples 
were crushed using a jaw crusher to less than 2 millimetres (mm) with a 70% minimum 
pass.  The samples were then split using a riffle splitter, and sample splits were further 
crushed using a ring mill pulveriser to less than 200 mesh (0.074 mm) with a 85% 
minimum pass.  

During ME-XRF06 analysis, a 0.9 gram (g) calcined or ignited sample is added to 9.0 g 
of lithium borate flux (50%/50% Li2B4O7/LiBO2), mixed well and fused in an auto fluxer 
between 1,050-1,100 degrees Celsius (°C). A flat molten glass disc is prepared from the 
resulting melt. This disc is then analysed by XRF spectrometry. 

11.3 Quality Assurance / Quality Control Procedures 

Utah Manganese did not insert any blanks, field duplicates, or standards into the rock 
grab sample stream.  Utah Manganese has relied on the internal Quality assurance and 
quality control (QA/QC) measures employed by ALS.  Quality assurance and quality 
control (QA/QC) measures at ALS include routine screen tests to verify crushing 
efficiency, sample preparation duplicates (every 50 samples), and analytical quality 
controls (blanks, standards, and duplicates). QC samples are inserted with each 
analytical run, with the minimum number of QC samples dependant on the rack size 
specific to the chosen analytical method. Results for quality control samples that fall 
beyond the established limits are automatically red-flagged for serious failures and 
yellow-flagged for borderline results. Every batch of samples is subject to a dual 
approval and review process, both by the individual analyst and the Department 
Manager, before final approval and certification.  The author has no reason to believe 
that there are any issues or problems with the preparation or analyzing procedures 
utilized by ALS. 

A certified coarse (prep) blank or standard sample was inserted on every 10th sample 
into the stream of RC drill chip samples. The standard used was OREAS 170a with the 
certified value of 58.17% MnO with a standard deviation (1SD) of 0.47% MnO. ALS 
analysis of this standard (Sample 292290) returned 57.26% MnO, which is less than 
two standard deviations from the certified value. The coarse (prep) blank sample 
(292370), composed of coarse granites, returned 0.1% MnO, which is 10 times the 
detection limit.  

It is the author's opinion that the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures 
were adequate for this stage of exploration on the properties. Future rock grab sampling 
should comprise inserting blanks, field duplicates, and standards in the sample stream.  

12 Data Verification 

The author conducted a reconnaissance of the Properties on October 12 and 13, 2012 
to verify the historically reported exploration results. The author completed traverses at 
the Duma Point, Dubinky Well and Flat Iron Properties and observed strata-bound lens, 
nodular-disseminated, and fault-fracture controlled pyrolusite-manganite mineralization 
consistent with that reported historically.  In addition, the author collected rock grab 
samples as 'replicate' samples to confirm the results of exploration by Utah Manganese

(Table 3 and Appendix 3).  The author was present during completion of the RC drill 
program and was able to review representative chip trays for select drill holes, observe 
drill collars, and sample collection procedures. 

Based on the results of the 'replicate' sampling the author has no reason to doubt the 
historically reported and current Utah Manganese exploration results.

17 Interpretation and Conclusions 

The northern Paradox Basin consists of a series of approximately parallel northwest-
southeast trending faults, anticlines, and synclines.  Within the Moab Valley, salt from 
the Paradox Formation has risen diapirically to the surface.  Salt structures were 
subsequently buried by up to 2 km of post-Triassic sediments.  Salt dissolution has 
resulted in down-faulting and the graben formation along anticlinal crests.   

Manganese oxide mineralization within the Properties occurs as lens-like strata-bound 
replacement bodies and associated manganese nodules of variable thickness and strike 
extent (Duma Point and Dubinky Well properties); or as fault gouge hosted lenses 
(Moab Fault Property) and brittle fault hosted vein-fracture infill.  Strata-bound bodies 
often occur proximal to or may partially-completely replace thin limestone or sandy 
limestone beds, of the Middle Jurassic Summerville-Tidwell interval. 

Open space infill hydrothermal vein and replacement textures within the manganese 
oxide lenses, and the absence of iron fractioning black shales, are not consistent with 
the stratified basin manganese model of Cannon and Force (1983), however the 
mechanisms of manganese mobilization and deposition remain important. 

Preserved tar sands and bleaching of permeable Navajo and Moab Tongue sandstones 
that stratigraphically underlie manganese oxide lenses, record flow of reduced saline 
hydrocarbon-bearing fluids that mobilized iron and manganese.  Deposition of 
manganese oxides was triggered by upward migration and mixing with shallow 
oxygenated groundwater.  The timing of significant oil generation (79 Ma) in the 
northern Paradox Basin and a spatial association of bleaching patterns within the 
Navajo Sandstone and Laramide uplifts indicate Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary fluid 
migration. Fault controlled manganese oxide mineralization at the Flat Iron Property 
returned a Late Oligocene (25-20 Ma) age. 

Regionally, anticlinal reservoirs created by Laramide and earlier salt diapir related uplifts 
may control manganese oxide deposition. Structurally controlled thinning of Triassic and 
Jurassic units may have further localized mineralization.   

Within the Duma Point and Dubinky Well properties, reducing fluids likely migrated 
outward from the Moab Fault, and upward along the limb of the Courthouse Syncline, 
where interaction with oxidizing meteoric groundwater triggered precipitation of 
manganese oxide precipitation.  Manganese mineralization within the Moab Fault 
Property may be related to fluid flow and deposition within the fault or by entrainment of 
pre-existing Brushy Basin Member strata-bound manganese oxides.  Relatively younger 
fault controlled manganese oxide mineralization at the Flat Iron Property provides 
evidence for multiple episodes of fluid flow or partial remobilization of earlier deposits.  

Rock grab sampling at the Dubinky Well Property establishes that lenses of high grade 
manganese oxide occur intermittently over a distance of approximately 1.4 km. 
Mineralization is not continuous along strike between sample sites, however based on 



 

Technical Report on the Utah Manganese Inc. Properties, Utah, USA

its significant lateral expression it can be inferred that there is a high potential for 
discovery of additional mineralized zones in subsurface down dip.  Given bedding and 
mineralization dip shallowly to the north-northwest, and that the mineralizaiton is 
present near the top of the sedimentary section, a relatively large area of the Dubinky 
Well Property has the potential to host mineralization under relatively shallow (<5 to 20 
m) cover.        

At Duma Point, mineralization occurs at an equivalent stratigraphic position, and the 
overlying stratigraphy thickens rapidly to the north-northeast.  Despite this, given that 
the combined lateral exposure at surface of manganese oxide bearing strata is 
approximately 5.7 km, significant exploration potential for near surface deposits 
remains. 

Within the Moab Fault and Flat Iron Properties, exploration is at an early stage but has 
resulted in the identification of numerous high-grade manganese oxide occurrences that 
warrant follow-up.  There is potential to define the along strike and depth extent of the 
known sub-vertical fault-hosted zones of mineralization, and for the discovery of parallel 
secondary fault structures that have potential to host additional zones. 

RC drilling completed to date within the Duma Point and Dubinky Well Properties is 
insufficient to establish the size of manganese oxide lenses, or their down dip extent.  
The success of exploration on the Properties depends on the identification of several 
manganese oxide lenses, having sufficient size and thickness that in aggregate have 
may be economically extracted.  Manganese mineralization is likely to produce 
resistivity low electro-magnetic (EM) geophysical anomalies, and massive 
mineralization may be indirectly detectable via contrast with magnetically neutral host 
rocks.  Further diamond or RC drilling targets should be defined on the results of 
detailed ground or airborne EM and magnetic geophysical surveys.        

18 Recommendations 

Based on the presence of near surface strata-bound lens, and fault-fracture controlled 
manganese-oxide occurrences; laterally extensive favourable geologic horizons; and 
evidence of significant reduced paleo-fluid flow within permeable lithologies underlying 
mineralized zones; the Utah Manganese Properties are of a high priority for follow-up 
exploration.   

The 2013 exploration program should include, but not be limited to: 

a) A field based program comprising ground-truthing and geologic mapping of 
historically reported manganese oxide occurrences within the Properties; Property-scale 
mapping of the aerial distribution of Curtis-Summerville-Tidwell rocks and detailed 
stratigraphic section studies to determine local bed-scale mineralization controls.  
Additional rock grab sampling including the collection of chip samples to determine 
grade over width inventories of significant occurrences is warranted.  In total 
approximately 200 rock samples should be collected b) ground magnetic and time 
domain electro-magnetic (TDEM) or frequency domain electro-magnetic (HLEM) 
surveys should be completed over the principal manganese oxide occurrences within all 
four Properties.  Semi-massive to massive pyrolusite lenses are expected to produce

magnetic and resistivity low (conductive) anomalies, that will serve to further define the 
known occurrences and aid in the discovery of buried deposits c.)  RC drilling of 20 
holes (approximately 800 metres @ $125/m all up). The total estimated cost to 
complete the.  The total estimated cost to complete the exploration is CDN$202,000, 
not including HST (Table 4). 

Historic mineral occurrence confirmation and subsequent rock geochemical and RC 
drilling programs completed by Utah Manganese has resulted in the definition of priority 
targets within each of the Properties that warrant follow-up RC drilling.  RC drilling 
should include, but not be limited to: 4 holes within the Duma Point Property to test 
manganese oxide occurrences at the head of Duma Point and northeast of White Wash; 
8 drill holes at Dubinky Well to test the historic Gustavus (present day DW #34 and DW 
#36 claims), and Autotruck No.2 and Autotruck No.1 occurrences to the east; 4 drill 
holes within the Moab Fault Property to test the two zones high grade manganese 
mineralization identified during the 2012 rock geochemical program;  and 4 holes within 
the Flat Iron Property to test the northwest strike extent fault controlled manganese 
mineralization within the FL #5 claim. 

The final location of RC drill holes should be based, but not contingent, on the results of 
the recommended geologic mapping, rock grab and chip sampling and ground 
geophysical surveys.
