SHINING TREE SUMMARY REPORT 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Platinex's Shining Tree gold project comprises 50 claims (139 claim units) and one mining lease for a 
total of 2,240 ha (5,600 acres) and is located in the Larder Lake Mining Division, Ontario.  Highway 560 
midway between Sudbury and Timmins, bisects the property.  The claims are held as to 100% by 
Platinex subject to a 3% NSR to Skead Holdings and a 100% interest in the mining lease with no 
underlying interests.  Five of the above claims containing eleven claim units and four additional claims 
comprising ten claim units held by Creso Resources Inc. are part of the Gold Corona joint venture.  The 
joint venture is not the subject of this report 
 
The Company SEDAR-filed its NI 43-101 technical report "the Report" dated October 2, 2008, by J.G. 
Bryant and D. Jamieson which examines the Herrick gold deposit on Shining Tree property and seven 
other known gold prospects, some of which have been explored underground. The Report qualifies the 
sampling and drilling work by Unocal (1989) and Fort Knox (1990) compliant to NI 43-101 standards. 
This report draws on the previous Report and provides an update based on results of subsequent 
exploration. 
 
The Report states that, "Judging from evidence of previous results on the Herrick deposit there 
is a potential to outline a small commercial gold deposit." An internal valuation of the Herrick 
deposit completed in May, 2012 by the author estimated potential gold content ranging from 
111,000 oz to 172,000 oz Au within the defined vein structures to a depth of 300m.  The estimate 
is based on a minimum of 1,628,000 tonnes grading 2.11g/tonne to a maximum of 2,554,000 
tonnes grading 2.10g/tonne Au.  The estimate is derived from 3 narrow sub-parallel quartz vein 
breccias and an enclosing mineralized shear zone within a 370m strike length, to a 300m depth 
and within an 80m wide block.  A cut off grade of 0.5g/tonne was used in the calculations. 
 
The Central zone of the Herrick deposit outcrops for most of its length and is a continuously 
readily definable body.  The valuation also identified thicker gold zones between intersecting or 
bifurcating veins in some holes (e.g. hole HP10-44 to the southwest)  and in outcrops which are 
not included in the calculations.  These structures plunge near vertically providing a 
prospective target for deeper exploration. There is an undefined potential for a southwesterly 
plunging thickened enriched section that could contain from a depth of 300m to 1500m some 
14.6 million tonnes at a grade ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 g/tonne Au for a gold content of 1.0 to 2.4 
million ounces. The model is based on the mentioned structure, comparison to the West 
Timmins deposit and statistical grade estimates by the author.  The potential quantity and grade 
is conceptual in nature.  There has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource 
and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the delineation of a mineral resource.  The 
internal valuation was conducted by the author, who is a qualified person but an insider of the 
issuer and therefore according to the ethical standards set forth in the National Instrument 43-
101 no qualification of resources is permitted. More sampling of existing core and stripping of 
identified thicker mineralized zones where these project to surface, is warranted and could 
increase the identified potential within the exploration envelope and ultimately lead to 
qualification of resources by an independent qualified person. 
 
Since October 2008, the Company has carried out an exploration program on the property.  Particular 
interest is focused on 446 samples recovered from basal till that have been processed by Overburden 
Drilling Management.  The results have revealed one of the more exceptional gold dispersion trains in 
the Abitibi. Many of the samples contain pristine gold grains indicating a nearby bedrock source.  In 
addition, 169 samples each returned more than ten gold grains (up to 144 gold grains in one sample) 
that suggest several nearby previously unexplored gold occurrences in the bedrock.  Noticeably a line

of the highest counts was obtained along 9 km easterly trending shear believed to be the Larder Lake 
Break or an associated splay fault and correlating with broad XDS ORTHO anomalies, a potassium 
decay anomaly, circular magnetic anomalies, and partly circumscribing and correlating with an alkalic   
stock.  The occurrence, distribution and density of high gold counts in till is similar to such patterns 
evident close to major gold deposits throughout the Timmins and Matachewan gold camps. The pattern 
encourages the conclusion that the sources of such anomalous indications are expressions of one or 
more major gold deposits.  
 
A nine km Pole-dipole IP survey was completed in March, 2012 by JVX Ltd. This was immediately 
followed by a five hole 870m drilling program, also in March, 2012, on previously undrilled portions of 
the property to test five very strong IP anomalies spatially associated with gold in till anomalies.   
 
All of the holes intersected thick zones of mineralization and/or alteration.  Logging, sampling and 
assaying of the core is partly completed and initial results reported. One hole intersected unmineralized, 
chlorite altered, syenite with a few randomly selected samples returning anomalous values to 327ppb 
Au. The strong IP response was unexplained. This area and its strike projections are a high priority for 
follow up exploration. Furthermore the evident clustering of the higher gold in till counts near the 
margins of an alkalic or syenitic stock is suggestive of a prominent, recognizable and readily explored, 
geological environment on a large portion of the property.  
 
On a regional scale the property is located within the prolific Abitibi greenstone belt which is renowned 
for its concentration of world-class gold and Cu-Zn-Ag-Au deposits.  The Shining Tree property appears 
to be on trend with the Larder Lake – Cadillac Break with which many of the world-class gold deposits 
are spatially associated.  The Shining Tree property is also centred on the axis of a regional gravity high 
signifying an area of thick supracrustal rocks and under-plating by oceanic crust or an intrusive 
environment.  In the Abitibi these associations appear conducive to the genesis of major gold deposits. 
 
The property is underlain by an Early Precambrian assemblage of WNW trending, steeply dipping felsic 
to mafic and ultramafic metavolcanic rocks as well as metasedimentary rocks and alkali metavolcanic 
rocks of Timiskaming age.  These rocks are intruded by pre-orogenic feldspar porphyries, alkali 
(syenite) stocks and hypabyssal diabase dikes of Matachewan age and sills of Nipissing age.  The 
Timiskaming-aged metasedimentary rocks are believed to have accumulated in a regional rift.  Later 
south to north compressive faulting along the axis of this rift is proposed, but has not been documented 
in the Shining Tree area.  Major NNW sinistral wrench faults, including the Michiwakenda Lake Fault 
which crosses the Shining Tree property, are regional in scale.  Related subsidiary parallel shears and 
possible splays carry significant gold mineralization on the Shining Tree property.   
 
Bedrock exposures are limited on the property which is principally covered by a thin mantle of 
Wisconsinan till. 
  
The Platinex Shining Tree property is at the hub of the area known as the Shining Tree gold camp.  
Numerous old gold workings and showings are located along a north-northwest trend on the property 
and to the southeast of the property for exploration.  There are other workings and showings in one or 
two parallel trends.  Minor production has been achieved from one set of workings close to the property 
boundary. 
 
Gold-silver mineralization is principally associated with multiple brittle, dilatant (but sometimes ductile) 
quartz-carbonate veins.  Many of these veins are narrow and contain sporadic high gold (silver) values, 
but are of lower priority for exploration.  The Herrick gold deposit discovered in 1918 has been 
developed by a shaft to 94 metres and some 345 m of lateral development on two veins.  Very high 
grade shoots were defined in surface channel sampling, sampling in the shaft, underground on the level 
at 90 m and in four drill holes by Herrick Gold Mines from 1918 onwards.  In 1989 Unocal drilled 11

holes for 1,473 m, cut over 201 channel samples and also took 35 composite grab samples on the two 
veins to test a stated potential, solely from historic data, of the system to carry 1,732 tonnes per vertical 
foot at 7.2 g Au /t over a width of 1.8 m and 50% dilution.  Unocal's results confirmed the persistence of 
the gold mineralization over a 385 metre strike length and expanded the known thickness of the 
mineralized shear along much of its length.  However, the drilling and channel sampling by Unocal 
identified that certain gold-bearing zones are narrowly confined within the shear zones and carry 
potentially commercial, high grade, correlative values and other portions contain isolated patches of 
high gold grades within a broader lower grade shear zone. 
 
Although the tenor of the Herrick Gold Mines drill core and channel sampling was not confirmed 
completely, the location of the mineralization was confirmed by Unocal.  Surface sample gold values of 
up to 56.5g per tonne /1.0 m (45 samples) were reported.  In 1990 Fort Knox Mines performed a small 
program of channel sampling on surface and in the shaft confirming some of the higher grade 
mineralization but not all of the higher grade values presented by Herrick Gold Mines.  
 
To-date work by Platinex has included: an airborne magnetometer, VLF-EM and radiometric survey; 
stripping, channel sampling (58 samples on Herrick) and core sampling conducted to verify results of 
previous work on the Herrick, Caswell and Churchill workings; a detailed program of basal till sampling 
collecting 446 samples now processed for gold grains by Overburden Drilling Management; prospecting, 
sampling and geological mapping; 98.8 line km ground walking magnetometer surveys and 12km IP 
surveys; 51 drill holes for 6,181m on the Herrick deposit, 7 holes for 1,070m on the Caswell area, and 5 
holes for 870m to test coincident IP and gold in till anomalies. Further whole rock analyses of the fines 
fraction was carried out on 205 till samples. Most parameters can be related to nearby bedrock features 
which provides additional evidence of the proximal source of the gold grains.  
 
One conclusion that can be made from the analyses of fines fractions of basal till samples and drilling to 
date is that the East West shears found at the Caswell prospect display a gold-silver tellurium 
association throughout the extensive set of trenches whereas the Michiwakenda Lake fault and other 
NNW trending structures host a gold-arsenic association.  The relationship between the two systems is 
unknown.  However it is postulated that the alkalic stock found in the middle of the claim group may be 
the driving heat source for the other peripheral deposits and that the emphasis on exploration should be 
directed to those anomalies associated with the stockf and its periphery. 
 
A two-phase exploration program is proposed to step up the evaluation of existing and anticipated gold-
bearing targets during the balance of 2012 and in 2013.  The proposed work program should include 
more core sampling, stripping and channel sampling, then deeper diamond drilling of the gold zones at 
the Herrick deposit and testing for the depth continuity of the Ronda gold-bearing zone beneath the 
Platinex property.   Additional detailed surface prospecting, surface stripping and channel sampling, line 
cutting, pole-dipole IP, soil gas surveys and diamond drilling are also recommended.  The proposed 
budget for Phase I is $1,554,500, and the budget for Phase II is $3,272,550. 
 
Proposed drilling in Phase 1 totals 5,000 m and in Phase II 15,000m.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL INFORMATION  

1.1    Introduction  

The Shining Tree property is located in the prolific Archean-age Abitibi Greenstone Belt which hosts 
many significant gold deposits and past producers of the Destor - Porcupine and Larder Lake - Cadillac 
trends in Ontario and Quebec (Figures 1 and 2). World-class volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits 
have also been discovered and mined over the last ninety years. 
  
The Shining Tree area has been the focus of gold exploration since the early 1900's. There are 
numerous gold occurrences and minor gold production has occurred at three locations.  
 
The property comprises a consolidation of 139 claim units by Robert Macgregor of Skead Holdings Ltd. 
and one mining lease acquired from Gary John McBride.  Mr. Macgregor has been actively prospecting 
in the Abitibi Greenstone Belt for more than 40 years.  Several historic gold properties, including shafts, 
waste and ore dumps, and mechanically stripped areas are present on the property and others are 
known in the Shining Tree area. 
 
Excellent continuity of some high grade gold-bearing veins over mineable widths as at the Herrick 
deposit, the significant extent of previously inaccessible but now prospective overburden covered areas, 
the numerous occurrences of gold in the Shining Tree area, the newly identified highly prospective, 
glacial gold dispersion train, and the shallow nature of exploration to date all tend to provide impetus for 
further exploration. 
 
Drilling by Platinex on the Shining Tree property has indicated potential for the Herrick veins to host a 
small scale commercial deposit or even a higher grade deposit at depth.  Till sampling has provided 
evidence of large scale gold occurrences on the scale of a major mining camp which are yet to be 
explored. 

1.2   Terms of Reference  

James R. Trusler, P.Eng who is also President and CEO of Platinex Inc. has prepared this report as an 
update of information to the National Instrument 43-101 report on the property written in 2008 by J. 
Garry Bryant and David Jamieson.  All work done since then has been supervised by independent 
qualified persons and a comprehensive program of exploration has been carried out on the property.  

The main purpose of this summary report is to characterize the setting and objectives of the Shining 
Tree gold exploration project and provide a view of the potential. 

1.3   Scope of Work and Acknowledgements 

The objective and scope of work associated with this summary report was three-fold.  First priority was 
to review available government publications, assessment reports filed with Ministry of Northern 
Development and Mines and any other reports and information owned or accessible through Skead 
Holdings and or Platinex Inc.  The second priority was to obtain first-hand familiarization and evaluation 
of some of the showings and other areas of the property.  Thirdly, the author has reviewed all of the field 
work carried out by Platinex under the supervision of David Jamieson, Scott Franko and Dean Cutting 
since 2008. 
 
This summary report was prepared to meet the standards of disclosure for mineral projects with the 
exception that it is not independent and mineral resources cannot be included.  The author utilized 
Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101), Form 43-101F1 and 
Companion Policy 43-101CP as guidelines for report preparation.  The professional opinions of Z.

Dvorak consulting geophysicist were helpful in the assessment and interpretation of the wide-spaced, 
government-funded AEM and magnetometer survey.  He also provided advice and an interpretation 
regarding the airborne, fixed-wing VLF-EM, magnetometer and radiometric survey carried out on behalf 
of Platinex by Terraquest.  Map compilation services were provided by Mohammad Salman, Jeff Meek 
and Associates and by Iain Trusler.  Geologists working on the project since 2008 include Dave 
Jamieson, Garry Bryant, Mehmet Spaho, Dean Cutting, Scott Franko, Frank Racicot and Fred Gittings. 
Thin section Petrographic studies were provided by Fred Gittings and Richard James. 

1.4   Sources of Information  

The main technical documents and files related to the Shining Tree Project consist of: 
• MNDM land use and land tenure files. 
• OGS publications, databases and assessment reports. 
• Government mapping for this area.   
• Results of Overburden Drilling Management Ltd. evaluation of basal till samples. 
• Drilling, prospecting, stripping, channel sampling, mapping and airborne and ground 

geophysical surveys supervised and/or commissioned by Platinex Inc. 

1.5   Disclaimer  

This report is built on the Qualifying Report prepared in 2008 which is quoted herein "The authors, 
including J.G. Bryant, the qualified person, attempted to confirm the validity of available information and 
site characteristics whenever possible.  Several of the reports provided excellent evaluation and 
documentation of activities.  Successful validation of some work was possible due to Certificates of 
Analysis in reports and due to independent, reasonable duplication of gold concentrations at the Herrick 
showing. 
 
Confirmation of the opinions and conclusions in historic correspondence and reports prepared prior to 
1989 is impossible.  It was also impossible to validate most of the geological, geophysical and 
geochemical information included in assessment reports, exploration company websites and 
government publications. 
 
All claims listed as project property correlated with claims identified as belonging to Skead Holdings Ltd. 
in the "Mining Claim Client Report" downloaded from the MNDM website on September 22, 2008.  Very 
limited field validation of the claim boundaries, claim posts and claim tags has indicated that at least 
some boundary and post locations are as represented on Mining Recorder claim maps.  The authors do 
not, however, warrant the validity and locations of all Platinex claims or the information provided on the 
MNDM claim maps." 
 
The claims listed in this report are claims now listed as belonging to Platinex Inc. In the Mining Claim 
Client Report downloaded from the MNDM website on June 7, 2012. 

2.0   PROPERTY LOCATION, ACCESS, DESCRIPTION AND OWNERSHIP  

2.1   Property Location and Access  

The Shining Tree property is located east of Highway 144 in northeastern Ontario at a latitude about 
mid-way between the cities of Sudbury and Timmins (Figure 1 and 2). Highway 560 extends east from 
Highway 144, bypasses the former CN railway stop of Westree, passes through the hamlet of Shining 
Tree and then extends east to Gowganda, Elk Lake and then New Liskeard located on Highway 11.

Highway 560 traverses the property in a northeast-southwest direction and enters the south portion of 
the property approximately 1.7 kilometres northeast of the hamlet of Shining Tree. The property 
underlies portions of Macmurchy, Churchill and Asquith Townships. 
  
The approximate centre of the property has UTM coordinates of Zone 17, 483787mE, 5271620mN.  
That location correlates with a longitude and latitude of 81°12'56" W and 47°35"52" N. 

2.2    Property Description  

The Shining Tree property comprises 46 claims totalling 139 claim units (Figure 2 and Table 1) and one 
mining lease. The claims comprise a larger north-south block and a smaller east-west block that have 
one common corner post. All claims are registered in the Larder Lake mining division.  Work completed 
on the property to date is progressively being filed for assessment and there is currently sufficient 
coverage to keep the entire property in good standing for 20-25 years.  Five of the claims comprising 
eleven claim units are subject to the Gold Corona joint venture with Creso Resources Inc. 

2.3    Property Ownership  

In 2011 the Company vested an option agreement with Skead Holdings Ltd., with respect to 139 claim 
units (5,680 acres or 2,299 ha), situated in Churchill, Macmurchy and Asquith Townships in Ontario (the 
"Shining Tree property").  The Company now holds a 100% interest in the claims subject to a 3% NSR 
and subject to an advanced annual royalty of $10,000 commencing in April 2013.  The 3% NSR may be 
reduced by payment of $400,000 for each 0.5% NSR purchased to a maximum of 1.5% NSR.  If the 
optionor wishes to sell the royalty interest the Company retains a right of first refusal to purchase the 
NSR.  On March 30, 2012 Platinex entered into an agreement to acquire a lease (40 acres, 16 ha) from 
Gary John McBride for 200,000 shares of Platinex which purchase closed on May 10, 2012.  The lease 
is central to the Shining Tree property, is renewable but set to expire on September 30, 2016. 

On October 20, 2010, Platinex entered into a joint venture agreement with Creso Resources Inc. 
("Creso") with the provision that a more formal agreement be produced within 3 months by Creso.  That 
never happened but in a technical committee meeting in 2011 it was agreed that each party would be 
responsible for exploring its own claims.  Claims belonging to Platinex are subject to the joint venture 
but there is no current certainty that the joint venture will be continuous.  Five of Platinex's claims 
comprising 11 claim units subject to the joint venture include: L1227175, L1235004, L4209213, 
L4207972 and L4217645. 

Four claims held by Creso comprising 10 claim units which also are subject to the joint venture 
agreement include:  L1242013, L1242014, L1242015 and L4225667. 

2.4    Access, Local Resources and Infrastructure 

All-weather road access to the general area is excellent (Figure 2).  Active lumber road and bush road 
access from Highway 560 to various parts of the property is fairly limited. Former roads into the north 
part of the main block were restored with a bridge established crossing a creek in conjunction with 
Creso Resources Inc.  This has provided ready access to the Herrick deposit. 
 
Some of the south part of the main block is also less accessible. Several parts of the east block are 
accessible via good lumber road and then lesser traveled old roads and trails. 
 
Several tourist camps located in the area offer fully-equipped cabins for accommodation. Rental boats 
and motors are also available.  Gasoline and a small selection of groceries and dry goods are available 
at the Spruce Shilling Camp. Gogama is the closest community with minor services. More substantial 
supplies and materials must be purchased in Timmins or Greater Sudbury.

3.0    PHYSIOGRAPHY, TOPOGRAPHY, CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT  

3.1     Physiography and Topography 

This area of northeastern Ontario is typified by extensive spruce bush mixed with some poplar and other 
species. The surficial geology is dominated by Quaternary ground moraines.  Glaciations have created 
a mosaic of numerous lakes, some swamp and muskeg, several creeks and the Montreal River which 
flows in a northerly direction. The south part of the largest lake, Michiwakenda Lake, extends about 2.5 
kilometres in a northwest-southeast direction along the northeast side of the main claim block.  Other 
significant lakes on the west part of the property include Perkins Lake, Gosselin Lake, Cryderman Lake 
and Chlorus Lake.  The hamlet of Shining Tree is situated a short distance to the west on the shore of 
Shining Tree Lake. The larger surface water bodies on the east part of the property include the 
southeast extremity of Michiwakenda Lake, Wasapika Lake, Knox Lake and Bob Lake (Figure 2). 
 
The West Montreal River is the dominant drainage feature in the area. It flows north across the eastern 
part of the property and has a wider section called Wasapika Lake. Michiwakenda Lake, Shining Tree 
Creek and Caswell Lake all drain into the Montreal River from the northwest. Undulating terrain 
characterizes the area. Elevations range from 335 to 400 metres above mean sea level (AMSL). 
Highest elevations occur along a northwest-southeast trend that crosses the Perkins Lake area in the 
northwest part of the property and recurs in a zone that extends from a short distance northwest of 
Highway 560 toward the southeast beyond the property (Figure 2). There appears to be a strong 
correlation between at least some of the topographically higher areas and intermediate to felsic volcanic 
rocks and some metasedimentary rocks. 

3.2    Climate 

A northern temperate climate with warm summers and cold winters is characteristic for the area.  The 
closest weather stations reported by Environment Canada (www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca) are at 
Timmins, Sudbury and Earlton.  Data for 1961 – 1990 indicated temperatures ranged from -45°C in 
winter to 40°C in summer.  Average annual precipitation was 554 to 657 mm rainfall and 247 to 313 cm 
snow for a total of 785 to 899 mm.  Maximum snow depth was 157 cm.  Exploration activity can be 
performed year-round. 

3.3    Land Uses, Environmental and Safety Considerations 

The primary current activities on and in the vicinity of the claims include soft-wood lumbering operations 
by Gogama Forest Products and seasonal hunting and fishing by nearby residents, day visitors and 
individuals that base their activities out of local lodges and hunting/fishing camps.  
 
The general area has been prospected for gold and base metals periodically since the 1910's.  
Numerous occurrences had underground development and production occurred at several deposits. 
  
Four areas of the Platinex lands, as optioned from Skead Holdings, have been the subject of stripping, 
washing channel cutting and channel sampling.  It is understood from discussions with the MNDM and 
MNR personnel that no permits are required for the exploration work carried out to date with the 
exception of a 2 year renewable land use permit for a bridge installed by Platinex.  Permits will be 
required from the Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans and possibly the Ontario Ministry of 
Natural Resources if a disturbed area exceeds 2,500 square metres, drilling is done from lakes or if 
vehicles or equipment have to be taken across streams, creeks or rivers. 
 
No attempt to evaluate any or all of the property for potential issues of environmental concern that may 
have resulted from either historic activities or the recent Platinex activities has taken place.

There is currently only one modern building on the subject property and the author is unaware of any 
associated environmental liabilities.  Several remnants of old buildings were observed by D. Jamieson 
near the Churchill and Caswell shafts.  Good fencing surrounds the Churchill shaft. The Herrick shaft 
location was expressed by a large hole that was essentially obstructed about two metres below the 
surface. The perimeter was marked by flagging since a barrier fence had not been present.  The 
Caswell shaft was properly covered over and inaccessible.   

4.0   COMMUNITIES AND FIRST NATIONS 

4.1    Communities 

The Platinex property is located between the regional centres of Timmins (192 km trucking distance) 
and Sudbury (206 km trucking distance).  Both of these communities have extensive mining 
infrastructure. 
 
The closest advanced gold mining projects to the Platinex Shining Tree property are the AuRico Young-
Davidson project, located in Matachewan, 116 km trucking distance, the Lakeshore Gold Timmins West 
project, 172 km trucking distance from the centre of the Platinex property and the Trelawney 
(IAMGOLD) Cote Lake deposit, approximately 50 km trucking distance. 

4.2    First Nations 

The two nearest First Nation communities are located in the Matachewan area and Mattagami Lake, 20 
km northeast of Gogama.  An MOU has been entered into with the Mattagami First Nation.  At this point 
in time, the Matachewan First Nation is involved in the process through the Mattagami First Nation. 
 
Mattagami First Nation is an Oji-Cree community with a population of 450 members, 175 of which live 
on the Reserve.  Several members of the community have prospecting and mineral exploration 
experience in the Shining Tree area.  The band has an Economic Development and Employment 
Resource Centre on site. 
 
The Matachewan First Nation is also an Oji-Cree community, with a population of approximately 60.  In 
March of 2006, Northgate Minerals (now AuRico)and Matachewan First Nation signed a memorandum 
of understanding regarding development of the Young-Davidson gold project in Matachewan. 

5.0   GEOLOGY     

5.1    Quaternary Geology 

The Quaternary Geology of the area was described by Roed and Hallett, 1979.  An estimated 85% of 
the property is underlain by a ground moraine till with bedrock knobs and some recent peat and muck 
organic terrain.  The area has moderate relief, is locally knobby and hummocky, and is generally dry.  
Local exceptions were noted in the extreme north of the main block and in the eastern half of the east 
block.   
 
In contrast, the remaining 15% of the property at the eastern extremity is part of extensive glaciofluvial 
and glaciolacustrine deposits described as sand and gravel outwash plain as an apron about an esker 
with associated kame moraine ice contact stratified drift.  These deposits are situated in an area of low 
relief and dry surface conditions.  The extreme northeastern part of this claim block is similar with super-
imposed recent peat organic terrain and a mixed wet and dry drainage.

Roed and Hallett (1979) reported that the Keewatin lobe of the Laurentide ice sheet advanced through 
the area at the beginning of the Wisconsinan (100,000 ybp) and that deglaciation of the area was 
completed by approximately 9,000 years ago. The authors classified the area as bedrock terrain with 
either exposed bedrock or bedrock covered by only 1-2 metres of ground moraine, whereas it may 
exceed 7 m thickness elsewhere. Glacial striae confirm the glacial advance was from the north. 
 
The closest linear glacial features are north-south trending eskers located 8 km west and about 10 km 
east of the property.  A section of the Sultan Scarp was reported about 3 km south of the property and 
was interpreted to be terminal moraine associated with a halt in the last Wisconsinan glaciation. 

5.2    Regional Geology and Bedrock Assemblages 

The Shining Tree greenstone belt is located in northeastern Ontario approximately 100 km north of 
Sudbury, and forms the southern portion of the Abitibi sub-province of the Superior Province (Figure 3).  
The Abitibi sub-province is one of the most prolific areas for gold and base metal deposits in the world.  
A strong spatial relationship exists between gold deposits and major regional faults.  A number of world-
class gold deposits occur in the Timmins camp and eastwards into Quebec, with all being associated 
with the Destor Porcupine Fault (Figure 4).  Another principal trend of world-class gold deposits occurs 
along the regional structure identified as the Larder Lake–Cadillac fault (LLCF).  Quite significantly the 
LLCF can be interpreted to extend through the Shining Tree area (Figure 4). 
 
The metamorphic grade throughout most of the Shining Tree area is mid- to low greenschist facies 
(Oliver et al. 1999a, 1999b).  Amygdules in volcanic rocks are filled with chlorite, carbonate or quartz 
and there is extensive saussuritization of feldspars in mafic flows and intrusions. The youngest 
sequence, the Timiskaming is less metamorphosed than the older assemblages.  Higher grade, 
amphibolites facies contact metamorphism has been identified adjacent to the Miramichi and Togo 
batholiths (Ayer, 2000) (Figure 5). 

5.2.1  Assemblages 

The Pacaud, Deloro, Kidd-Munro and Tisdale assemblages (Figure 5) are dominated by volcanic 
supracrustal rocks which were formed before the first phase of deformation (Oliver et al, 1999b). Felsic 
volcanic units close to the presumed tops of the assemblages in the Shining Tree area have been dated 
by U/Pb techniques (Johns and Amelin 1999).  The ages of the older three assemblages (Pacaud, 
Deloro and Kidd-.Munro) indicate that the greenstone belt youngs to the northeast (Ayer, 2000).   
 
The Pacaud assemblage is mainly composed of massive and pillowed basalts and is associated with 
minor spinifex or cumulate textured komatiites.  The Deloro assemblage is dominated by felsic volcanic 
rocks and is capped in many places by chemical sediments, seen as banded chert and jasper.  The 
Kidd-Munro assemblage is a varied assemblage dominated by tholeiitic basalts and komatiites, with 
minor felsic volcanic rocks, and the Tisdale assemblage comprises mafic flows and intermediate to 
felsic pyroclastics and/or volcaniclastics (Johns, 1999a). 
 
The next youngest rocks are Keewatin intrusive rocks identified as the Miramichi and Togo batholiths 
which surround the Shining Tree area.   
 
The next younger Archean assemblage in the area is the Timiskaming age volcanic and sedimentary 
rocks.  Clasts of the older intrusive rocks are common within the Timiskaming assemblage.  The 
Timiskaming assemblage has been divided into two lithostratigraphically distinct groups, the Indian Lake 
group (ILG) in the south and east, and the Natal group (NG) in the north and the west (Johns and 
Amelin 1999; Johns 1999a).  The Natal group comprises volcanic pyroclastic rocks and flows usually of 
alkalic-type, and associated volcaniclastic sediments. 
 



Summary Report for Platinex Inc., Shining Tree, Ontario 
By:  James R. Trusler 

16 
 

 Unconformities seen between the Natal group and the underlying Keewatin sequences (Johns 1996, 
1997, 1999a; Johns and Amelin 1999) are evidence of a hiatus in volcanic activity.  The predominantly 
volcanic facies of the Natal group is found in southeast Natal Township and grades north and west into 
reworked pyroclastics, wackes and siltstones in Kelvin Township. The volcaniclastic rocks and 
associated pyroclastics are mainly tuffs, lapilli tuffs and tuff breccias. Timiskaming sediments are also 
located in a wide strip trending west across the northern portion of Connaught and Churchill Townships 
(Carter 1987; Johns 1996, 1997 and 1999a; Johns and Amelin 1999).  The ILG sediments are described 
as texturally immature quartz-feldspathic arenites and wackes with minor conglomerates and rare 
mudstones.  Detrital zircons were U/Pb dated as 2702 Ma.   
 
Recent drilling has intersected an altered syenite intrusive on the property in the McBride area-hole 
MP12-01.  The syenite is believed part of a syn or post-Timiskaming Group Archean intrusive alkalic 
pluton possibly linked genetically to the trachyte porphyries.  
 
More detailed descriptions of the general rock types of the Shining Tree area were provided by Ayer 
(2,000) and are provided in the following text. 
 
Komatiites and Associated Tholeiitic Rocks 

In the Pacaud assemblage, komatiitic flows are confined to a small area close to the top of the 
sequence. In the northeast part of the Shining Tree area, komatiite flows interbedded with tholeiitic 
basalts cover an extensive area towards the top of the Kidd-Munro assemblage. The komatiitic flows 
demonstrate macro- and micro-spinifex textures, polysuturing and brecciation. Thin dunitic cumulate 
horizons also occur in flows at several horizons in the Kidd-Munro assemblage. These komatiitic flows 
tend to be black and talcose unless silicified or otherwise altered, in which case they weather to a pale 
grey colour (Johns 1996, 1997; Johns and Amelin 1999). The komatiites are commonly carbonatized 
and in a few locations in the Pacaud assemblage they contain abundant fuchsite, imparting a strong 
green colour to the rock. This alteration is also associated with silicification.  The High Field Strength 
Elements, rare earth elements (REEs) and some of the major element oxides such as Al2O3 and TiO2 
are relatively immobile and appear to be unaffected by alteration.  
 
Komatiites 

The komatiites from the Pacaud assemblage all have high degrees of carbonatization, which can be 
identified on a microscopic level, some have a schistose texture and none have their primary texture 
preserved. All of the komatiites from the Pacaud assemblage are petrographically different from the 
younger Kidd-Munro (KM) komatiites.  A significant difference can also be seen in the geochemistry 
between the komatiites of the Pacaud and the Kidd-Munro assemblages.  KM komatiites are very similar 
to the aluminum-undepleted Tisdale-type komatiites in the Abitibi greenstone belt (Xie and Kerrich 
1994).  
 
Tholeiitic Volcanic Flows 

Basalts and basaltic andesite in the Shining Tree area occur largely as pillowed or massive flows, but 
also include variolitic and spherulitic flows, feldspar phyric flows and amygdaloidal flows. The pillows are 
commonly well preserved and are of the order of 1 to 2 m long and 0.5 m thick, with fine grained 
margins, and a minor inter-pillow hyaloclastite. Alteration includes late carbonate veins and silicification.  
The tholeiitic basalts have been examined in terms of the assemblages within which they are located, 
but there is little geochemical difference between them. All of the basaltic units have unfractionated 
primitive-mantle normalized multi-element distributions. 
 
Mafic to Ultramafic Sill 

A mafic to ultramafic sill identifiable in the airborne magnetic survey maps as a long, linear feature 
spans Fawcett Township. It appears to be concordant with the volcanic rocks of the Pacaud

assemblage. The sill is terminated by the Granite Lake Fault near the western margin of Fawcett 
Township. This sill has been interpreted as komatiitic flows (Carter 1977) and more recently as a thin sill 
due to its placement within felsic flows (Johns and Amelin 1999). The rocks from this structure are 
pyroxene-phyric, coarse grained and have a range in MgO from 10 to 19 wt %. Ultramafic samples from 
the sill are similar to aluminum-depleted (with respect to average Neoarchean komatiites) komatiites 
from Boston Township in the Abitibi greenstone belt, displaying very low Al/Ti ratios, possibly due to 
elevated TiO2 concentrations (Tomlinson et al, 1996c).  The structure is the only example of light rare 
earth element-enriched and heavy rare earth element depleted ultramafic rocks in the greenstone belt. 

5.3   Structural Geology 

There are two main phases of deformation and associated metamorphism in the Shining Tree area 
(Oliver et al. 1999a, 1999b) with rocks older than 2.7 Ga having undergone two periods of deformation.  
There are multiple deformation zones in the older volcanic rocks in which gold has been found, 
especially in Macmurchy and Tyrrell Townships (Johns 1996, 1997 and 1999a). The younger, less 
metamorphosed, Timiskaming assemblage has undergone only one period of deformation (Oliver et al. 
1999a, 1999b).  
 
Major displacement of lithological units occurs across several north-northwest trending faults.  Locally, 
the most prominent is the Michiwakenda Lake Fault that extends from south of Michiwakenda Lake and 
across the north part of the main block.  The Herrick deposit is about 400 m west of and parallel to the 
interpreted fault (Figures 6 and 7).  Other major faults located in the surrounding area, are the Jess 
Lake and Foley Lake Faults in Macmurchy Township, the Spider Lake Fault in south-western Tyrrell 
Township and the Elephant Head Lake Fault in Connaught Township.  No gold deposits are known to 
occur directly within the fault zones, but there may be a clustering of gold occurrences in proximity to the 
Michiwakenda Lake Fault.  
 
On a regional scale the Michiwakenda Lake Fault merges with the Mattagami River Fault (Figure 4).  
This fault system is responsible for a six kilometre sinistral throw of correlative rock units in the Shining 
Tree area and the South Porcupine Destor Break near Timmins.  The west Timmins Mine of Lake Shore 
Gold is marginal to and west of the Mattagami River Fault.  In the Shining Tree area the Herrick deposit 
is marginal to the fault and the LLCF is interpreted to trend through the Shining Tree property. 
 
The importance of such regional faults to spatial association with major mineral deposits is 
demonstrated by the Montreal River Fault 'MLF' (Figure 4).  It forms the confining association in the 
Cobalt Silver camp in the south is proximal to the Young Davidson Mine where the MRF crosses the 
LLCF, is proximal to the Pamour Gold Mine where the MRF crosses the South Porcupine Destor Break 
and in Kidd Township is proximal to the Kidd Creek VMS deposit. 
 
Could the Michiwakenda Lake Fault be of equal significance? 
 
There is also strong potential that northwest to west-northwest trending structures could provide an 
important control feature for gold occurrences.  The apparent alignment of the gold occurrences from 
the Caswell deposit to the Kingston deposit in southwest Macmurchy Township can be projected toward 
the Herrick deposit which has north-south striking quartz-carbonate veins.  There could be a 
complementary relationship between the various faults.  Carter suggested a relationship between the 
gold-bearing structures and N50°W fold axes in south-western Macmurchy Township.  Thus the Saville 
and Evelyn structures would be longitudinal faults, the N50E vein swarm on the Caswell would be cross-
fracture fissure veins, and the Herrick, Ronda and Foisey structures would be diagonal shear veins.

A broad deformation zone was identified by Johns (1996) entering the property in the northeast and 
trending at roughly 065-085°.  Displacements of the NNW trending magnetic features such as diabase 
along this deformation zone were noted by Dvorak (2008) as a regional structure.  Sericite and chlorite 
schist within the volcanic units on the property along Highway 560 are evident.  This is believed to be a 
shear zone which is either an extension of or a related splay to the LLCF. 
 
The most significant known gold-bearing features in the Shining Tree area can be summarized as 
follows: 
 

1.  The Herrick, Ronda, Foisey, and Gold Corona quartz-carbonate veins and shear zones are 
oriented north-south. 

2.  The Evelyn, Saville (Caswell area), Gosselin and Discovery (Speed Lake area) quartz-carbonate 
veins and shear zone are oriented NW-SE.  The Evelyn and Saville zones where intersected in 
2011 drilling appear to the interflow sedimentary rocks whereas the Saville structure is recorded 
as a shear hosted quartz vein in historic records. 

3.  The Churchill, Pet, Speed Lake stripping (dominant parallel vein set) and the vein swarm at 
Caswell are NE-SW trending structures. 
 

The most significant gold deposits known thus far in the Churchill-Macmurchy area of Shining Tree 
occur in the Herrick and Ronda vein systems, both oriented approximately due north. Preliminary 
structural interpretation for the sense of movement along vein/shears at the Caswell stripped area 
indicates that the maximum shortening direction is NNE-SSW, roughly sub parallel to the average 
orientation of Herrick and Ronda structures (Figure 6).  Further examination of the structural 
components of all known showings and compilation of the structural measurements taken throughout 
the Shining Tree greenstone belt could produce exploration guidelines similar to those used for large 
wrench fault systems. 
 
The results of the gold in till studies done on a property wide basis did not produce strong values in the 
vicinity and down ice from known deposits.  Rather the gold in till anomalies appear to evidence 
previously unknown and probably more significant but unexplored gold mineralization.  

6.0    MINERAL DEPOSIT TARGETS 

Archean-age lode gold (greenstone-hosted quartz-carbonate veins) deposits and volcanogenic massive 
sulphide deposits are valid exploration targets on the Platinex Inc. Shining Tree property.  

6.1    Gold Deposit Model 

Greenstone-hosted quartz-carbonate vein deposits or mesothermal orogenic type gold deposits have 
been defined and described by Dube and Gosselin as follows: "They correspond to structurally 
controlled complex epigenetic deposits hosted in deformed metamorphosed terrains.  They consist of 
simple to complex networks of gold-bearing, laminated quartz-carbonate fault-fill veins in moderately to 
steeply dipping compressional brittle-ductile shear zones and faults with locally associated shallow-
dipping extensional veins and hydrothermal breccias.  They are hosted by greenschist facies to locally 
amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks of dominantly mafic composition and formed at intermediate 
depth in the crust (5-10 km).  They are typically associated with iron-carbonate alteration.  The 
mineralization is syn- to late deformation and typically post-peak greenschist facies or syn-peak 
amphibolites facies metamorphism.  They are genetically associated with a low salinity CO2-H2O-rich 
hydrothermal fluid thought to also contain CH4, Na, K and S.  Gold is largely confined to the quartz-
carbonate vein network, but may also be present in significant amounts within iron-rich sulphidized 
wallrock selvedges or silicified and arsenopyrite-rich replacement zones.  They are distributed along 
major compressional to transtensional crustal-scale faults in deformed greenstone terrains of all ages, 
but are more abundant and significant, in terms of total gold content, in Archean terrains….The

diagnostic features of greenstone-hosted quartz-carbonate vein type gold deposits are arrays and 
networks of fault and shear-zone-related quartz carbonate laminated fault-fill and extensional veins in 
associated carbonatized metamorphosed greenstone rocks.  The deposits are typically associated with 
large-scale (crustal) compressional faults, have a very significant vertical extent (≤ 2 km), with a very 
limited metallic zonation." 
 
Dube and Gosselin also propose exploration parameters for quartz-carbonate greenstone-hosted gold 
deposits.  They stated: "In terms of exploration at the geological province or terrain scale, geological 
parameters that are common in highly fertile volcano-sedimentary belts include: 1) reactivated crustal-
scale faults that focused porphyry-lamprophyre dyke swarms. 2) complex regional scale geometry of 
mixed lithostratigraphic packages. 3) evidence for multiple mineralization or remobilization events 
(Groves et al. 2003). The overprinting or remobilization was clearly a key factor in the formation of the 
exceptionally rich Goldcorp High-Grade Zone of the Campbell-Red Lake deposit (Dube et al. 2002; in 
press). The empirical spatial and genetic (?) relationship between large gold deposits and Timiskaming-
like regional unconformity represents a first order exploration target as illustrated by districts such as 
Timmins, Kirkland Lake, and Red Lake (Hodgson, 1993; Robert, 2000; Dube et al, 2000, 2003 and in 
press).`` 

6.1.1   Gold Potential of Platinex Shining Tree Property 

The position of the Platinex Shining Tree property is shown by the red triangle on a depiction of the 
regional geology map by Dube and Gosselin (Figure 4).  The relationship to major gold deposits, 
regional structures and the Timiskaming age sedimentary rocks are clearly favourable for gold 
exploration in this part of the Abitibi greenstone belt. Large gold deposits including world-class gold 
deposits have been found along regional trends which are shown in Figure 4 to pass through the 
Platinex Shining Tree property. 
 
The Shining Tree property is located mid-way between the Young-Davidson and Cote Lake gold 
deposits along the interpreted western extension of the LLCF. 
 
Gold occurrences on the Platinex Shining Tree property are spatially and likely structurally related, but 
have been worked historically as separate areas. Gold mineralization occurs in a variety of rock 
assemblages, rock types and structural styles in the Shining Tree area.  The strong spatial association 
of the Ronda, Herrick, Churchill, Gold Corona, Buckingham and associated smaller gold occurrences 
implies a strong genetic association (Figure 6).  
 
The Herrick vein system is controlled by what appears to be a cross-cutting structure that displaces 
Timiskaming age sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Alkali-rich porphyritic rocks (trachytic flows or 
intrusive) have been mapped and intersected in drill core at both the Herrick and Churchill prospects.  
  
The Churchill vein system is located toward the top of the Deloro assemblage close to the 
unconformable contact with the Kidd-Munro assemblage to the north (Ayers 2002).  Felsic fragmentals, 
cherty pyrite-rich sedimentary rocks, and sulphide facies iron formation are all associated with this 
assemblage contact. Work by Unocal in 1989 included geological mapping and diamond drilling of both 
the Churchill and Herrick vein systems.   Timiskaming-aged volcanic rock types described by the field 
names "altered trachyte" and "red porphyry" were noted by Unocal in both the Churchill and Herrick vein 
systems and show a strong association with elevated gold values. 
 
The Speed Lake or the Gosselin trend, which appears to be continuous from southeast Churchill 
Township into central Asquith Township, is located in the Pacaud assemblage.  The Gosselin trend is 
closely aligned with a trend of ultramafic rocks, presumed to be composed mainly of komatiitic flows 
which have undergone deformation and alteration to form locally gold-bearing quartz-stockworks in 
fuchsitic carbonate alteration zones (green quartz-carbonate).

The Caswell vein system is part of a larger shear system that apparently trends southeast, similar to the 
gold-bearing Tyrrell shear zone further east near Gowganda. The host rocks are intermediate to mafic 
intrusive and extrusive volcanics which have undergone complex brittle to ductile deformation, are 
variably carbonate-altered and locally silicified with associated gold-bearing, locally pyritic, quartz-
carbonate veins both parallel and discordant to the main shear orientation.  In the author's opinion the 
N60°E to N85°E shear system at Caswell will prove to be a more important locus for gold mineralization. 
In contrast to other locations proximal to the historic large gold production areas, the Shining Tree area 
has received no comprehensive exploration campaigns and very little exploration below a depth of 250 
metres. 

6.2   Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide Deposits (VMS) Model 

The secondary target type is volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits most commonly associated with 
the upper part of a mafic-felsic volcanic sequence of calc-alkaline affinity. Major deposits of this type 
have been mined in the Abitibi province, particularly in the Timmins and Noranda mining camps. 
 
There is varying terminology for these essentially Cu-Zn-Pb-Ag dominated systems, such as volcanic-
associated, volcanic-hosted, and volcano-sedimentary-hosted massive sulphide deposits.  These 
deposits occur in submarine environments at or near the seafloor, as lenses of polymetalic massive 
sulphide.  The mechanism for formation varies, but the key process is the discharge of hot, metal-
bearing, hydrothermal fluids that have developed from sub-seafloor fluid convection.   
 
VMS deposits are regarded as belonging to the larger group of exhalative deposits, which include iron 
formation and SEDEX deposits.  Most VMS deposits consist of a tabular, stratabound accumulation of 
sulphides, quartz and accessory oxide and silicate minerals, stratigraphically above a discordant system 
of sulphide veins, and disseminations.  Both the stratabound and discordant "pipes" have characteristic 
alteration halos which can extend significant distances from the sulphide accumulations, thus providing 
an important consideration in designing exploration programs for these types of deposits. 
 
Another component of a VMS system is the heat source that provides the energy to develop the 
convection of fluids needed to scavenge and eventually concentrate metals.  This generally takes the 
form of a subvolcanic intrusion, occurring some kilometres below the seawater interface.  These heated 
intrusions are arealy extensive, explaining the development of base metal "camps" consisting of 
numerous VMS deposits of varying sizes. 
 
The process of delivering heated hydrothermal fluids into a column of seawater creates thin but 
regionally extensive iron-rich chemical sediment or "exhalites" that cap or are part of the VMS 
sequence.  These units provide critical markers in VMS exploration programs. 

6.2.1   VMS Potential of Platinex Shining Tree Property 

The potential for base metal deposits in this area is noted by Unocal. Drill hole and surface observations 
in Unocal's Churchill area work, include strong sulphide mineralization in cherty horizons and pyritic, 
silicified argillaceous sediments, traces of sphalerite associated with pyrite, chloritization and weakly 
anomalous gold values (in 11.75 metres of "Sulphidic Rhyolite" in hole CU89-17).  There are also 
anomalous widespread gold values within chert horizons (logged as 10.6 metres and 4.5 metres of 
chemical sedimentary rock, chert, sulphide iron formation in holes CU89-17 and 19).  There is no 
copper, zinc, lead or silver analyses presented for any of the Unocal work. Whole rock and trace 
element data for eleven samples are presented, but Cu, Zn, Pb or Ag were not included in this data. 
 
Regionally, these felsic and chemical sediment rocks intersected in the Churchill area occur at the top of 
the felsic volcanic dominated, 2730-2725 Ma Deloro assemblage, and at the base of the 2717-2712 Ma 
Kidd-Munro assemblage.  Portions of this assemblage contact occur on the Platinex property between

the Churchill/Macmurchy Township boundary and an area just north of Perkins Lake.  Major VMS 
deposits in the Southern Abitibi Sub-province are hosted by rocks with the following ages: Noranda – 
2700Ma; Kam Kotia – 2707 to 2705Ma; Kidd Creek and Potter – 2717 to 2714 Ma. (Fyon et al 1992). 

7.0  DEPOSITS AND OCCURRENCES OF THE SHINING TREE AREA PROPERTY AND   
LOCAL AREA GEOLOGY 

7.1     Past Producers 

There were no past producers on the Shining Tree property. Details about one nearby producer and two 
producing mines from the general area are provided in the following paragraphs. 

7.1.1   Ronda Mine 

The Ronda Mine, associated with the Ribble quartz vein is located in Macmurchy Township near Ribble 
Lake, a short distance southeast of the north part of the main claim block (Figure 6).  The vein was 
reported to have a north strike and 60o west dip, was exposed almost continuously for 760 metres and 
had an average width of 1.5 metres (MNR, OGS Mineral Deposits Circular 18, Part 2, p. 75-76, 1979). 
The vein was described as intensely crumpled and folded and enclosed in carbonatized and pyritized 
schistose pillow lava. Intermittent development work occurred from 1912 to commencement of 
production in 1939. Production occurred only in 1939 and amounted to 2,727 oz. gold and 4830 oz. 
silver from 24,592 tons for an average grade of 0.11 oz. Au per ton in 1939.  Plans of the workings 
indicate a westerly plunge to the mineralization which is projected to underlie the Platinex Shining Tree 
property at a depth of 300m. 

7.1.2   Tyranite Mine 

Further northeast of Macmurchy Township is the Tyranite Mine site, located a short distance south of 
the east-west boundary between Tyrell and Knight Townships. Graham (1932, p. 49, 51-52), The 
Northern Miner (1939) and Tremblay (1947) provided details about the setting and production. 
Discovered in 1930 as the Hedlund property, work by several companies culminated in 1939-1942 
production of 31,352 oz. gold and 4,860 oz. silver from 223,810 tons of ore. The ore occurred as pods 
and lenses in two parallel, north-trending carbonatized and pyritized shear zones. Attitude of the shear 
zones was N20oW with a 70o west dip. The south ore body was 120 m by 12 metres and the north 
orebody was 60 metres by 8 metres wide. The shaft extended to 350 metres depth and development 
occurred on seven levels.  

7.1.3   Bilmac Mine 

The Bilmac prospect had production associated with the Evelyn and Saville Veins in 1922 and 1933. 
Total production has been reported as $1607 for gold and silver combined (MNR, OGS Mineral 
Deposits Circular 18, Part 2, pp74-75, 1979).  

7.2  Occurrences with Past Underground Development 

The Herrick gold deposit and the Churchill and Caswell gold occurrences, located on the Platinex 
Shining Tree property, were previously investigated by underground workings. Elsewhere in the Shining 
Tree area there were nine additional occurrences that were also evaluated by means of underground 
workings. Details about the Herrick and Churchill deposits, and the Caswell area are provided in the 
following sections.

1918:  Herrick Gold Mines acquired property; 4 holes drilled (955 metres), trenching and sampling;    
   two compartment shaft to 15 metres. 

1919:     Report by F.V. Marsden M.E.; few details but recognized high gold values are wide-spread. 

1920:  Report by G. R. Rodgers. 

1921:   Report by P. McDonald for directors of Herrick Gold Mines. Noted that shaft had been sunk to 
120' with limited lateral work; stations in shaft at 50 and 100' with 40' of drifting; also noted that 
surface sampling was done by cut channels every 5' was carefully done; discussion of free-
milling metallurgy of ore; indicated extraction of over 90% of gold with fine grinding and 
cyanidation; low cyanide consumption. 

1923:   Work ceased with shaft at 300' and levels at 50', 95' (250' drifting), 200', and 300' (290' of 
crosscutting and 600' drifting). 

1923:    Henderson Bros. Mine contractors (F.D. Henderson) wrote a letter to F.C. Sutherland, King 
Edward Hotel regarding shutdown of Herrick operations.  Felt the engineer of Tonapah Mining 
did not give the operation a chance and that the shaft should have been sunk to 500'.  Believed 
sampling results were understated. 

1933:   Plans were made by Consolidated Ontario Gold Mines Ltd. to deepen the shaft to 700' in order 
to explore intersection of 0.16 opt over 50 feet.  Plans were not carried out. 

1933:   Report by Kindle (Consulting geologist, Toronto). He noted 259' crosscutting and 631' of 
drifting on 300' level and that the vein was in the face of the last round according to last shift of 
workers.  Drift at 100' level followed vein for 250'; ore found at 25' level; vein at shallow depth 
was offset to the west by a low angle fault passing through the shaft; Kindle took 11 samples, 
averaging $10.20 /ton gold, similar to Marsdens report (average carried by a $77.20 grab and 
$13.40 across 2'; mainly grab sampling; recommendation for further underground development. 

1935:   Acquisition by Grantland Gold; compilation of data;  
Erie Canadian Mines drew 300' level plan dated April 15, 1935. 

1935:   G.D. Holbrooke report of April 15, 1935.  A stamp indicates this report was received from 
Sylvanite Exploration Department in 1961 by the Resident Geologist for the ODM.  The date, 
April 15, 1935 is also on two Erie Canadian Mines drawings (300' level plan and a composite 
section of four drill holes (original by G. R. Rodgers).  The 300' level has approximately 900' of 
drifting and cross-cutting according to Erie Canadian Mines, 300' level plan April 15, 1935. 

1940:   Examination by Sylvanite Gold Mines; re-sampling of surface; no documentation of this located 
to date. 

1962:  Matachewan Canadian Gold Ltd., acquired property. 

1969:  Triton Exploration Ltd. acquired property. 

1988:   751160 Ontario acquired property by staking.

geophysics, channel sampling and diamond drilling (1473m in 11 holes).  

1990:   Fort Knox Resources examined the property as part of regional exploration work. 

7.2.2   Caswell Occurrence 

The following timeline is based on information from assessment files, Ministry of Northern Development 
and Mines sources and a report from Practical Exploration and Development Corporation (Edgar, 2001) 
(Figure 8). 
 
1916:  J. Messer reported on sampling that yielded numerous assays greater than one ounce per ton. 

Assays from a 40 foot shaft sunk on the east shore (No. 2 shaft) yielded assays up to 19 
ounces per ton over 12 inches. No plans or maps for this data are known to exist. 

1923:  R.W. Demorest in 1923 reviewed work done on the property to date.  Sampling by Demorest 
on 11 veins included assays from 0.12 ounces per ton over 30 inches to 31.16 ounces per ton 
over 48 inches. 

1925:  C. Baycroft reported on a diamond drill program by Canadian Champion Reef Mining Company 
Limited.  A 92 foot deep shaft on the east side of the lake was also sunk around the same time, 
with 178 feet of drifting done from the bottom of the shaft. 

1929:  Canadian Champion Reef Mining Company Limited sank the No 1 shaft to 520 feet with 1105 
feet of drifting; little documentation of sampling results available. 

1933: Canadian Champion Reef Mining Company re-organized into Burvan Gold Mines Ltd.; re-
sampling and prospecting by Burvan. 

1938:   F. Austin examined the data available for the Caswell property; noted lack of rigorous sampling 
correlation and documentation.   

1975:   New Bedford re-sampled several of the veins and drilled three holes.  Visible gold was noted in 
two of the holes, but the best gold assay was 0.085 opt over 2.5 feet.  Small bulk samples near 
shaft 2 (M. Newbury personal communication) returned gold assays of up to 2.96 ounces per 
ton and silver assays up to 1206 ounces per ton. 

1980:   Tut Explorations partially dewatered #1 shaft and performed limited underground sampling. 

1987:  Chesbar Resources examined the property and available data. 106 grab samples collected by 
Mike Perkins of Chesbar Resources.  Eleven samples returned greater than 0.1 ounces per 
ton. 

1988:   Chesbar Resources drilled a total of 5,874 feet on veins 1 to 4 and 101 to 122. 

2001:  Practical Exploration and Development Corporation compiled available data on the property 
and performed limited power-stripping and sampling. 

7.2.3   Churchill Occurrence 

1918 – 1936:  Exploration work resulted in a 38 foot deep pit on one of the veins and a 7 foot by 9 foot 
vertical two-compartment shaft to a depth of 110 feet on the north or No. 3 vein (Sinclair 
et al. 1935, p.82; Laird 1935, p.40). A level was set up at 109 feet on this shaft and 70 
feet of drifting and 154 feet of crosscutting were done (Sinclair et al. 1936, p.92).

1989: Unocal Canada Ltd. acquired the property; performed geological mapping, power-
stripping, channel sampling and drilled four holes for a total of 461 metres of diamond 
drilling. 

7.2.4   Other Underground Development Sites 

Two gold prospects with underground development, the Jefferson Lake and the Gosselin (Fred) 
prospects are located west of the Platinex Shining Tree property.  Four other gold prospects, the Atlas,  
McIntyre-McDonald, Bennett and Kingston gold occurrences are located southeast of the Caswell shafts 
and were all evaluated with underground workings. 
 
Most of the underground development work on these prospects dates from the early days of the Shining 
Tree gold camp. No major exploration programs have followed, but sporadic stripping, trenching, re-
sampling and minor drilling have taken place during periods of high gold prices.   

7.3   Occurrences and Prospects 

7.3.1   On-Property 

The McBride Royal Mining, Clarke and Knox gold occurrences have been documented on Ontario 
Geological Survey maps and in reports. All are shown on Figure 6.  
 
Royal Mining Occurrence 

Geological and geophysical mapping were carried out by Barringer Research Limited in 1971, outlining 
a shear zone in an east-west to east-northeast direction, immediately north of highway 560. (Carter, 
1980).  
 
Clarke Gold Occurrence 

The Clarke gold occurrence is located in the extreme southwest corner of the property, in Asquith 
Township.  Refer to Section 8.4 for details. 
      
Knox Gold Showing 

The Knox showing is located in Macmurchy Township, adjacent to Knox Lake in the east part of the east 
claim block.  In the early days of the Shining Tree camp, this showing was known as the Wood claims.  
Hopkins described the occurrence as "two narrow east-west rusty schist zones which contain a few 
parallel quartz veins, all being cut by a north-south diabase dyke.  A little gold occurs in the north vein 
immediately east of the diabase and in the south vein directly west of the diabase." 

Sampling done in 2004 and reported in the MDI for the Knox veins (two of 14 samples) returned assays 
of 0.029 and 0.018 opt from trench 1A and noted sampling by R.C. Whelan returned values up to 804 
ppb. 

7.3.2   Occurrences in the General Area 

Other gold occurrences in the general area of the Platinex property include the Gunter, Gold Corona, 
Cochrane, Foisey, Featherstone and Onitap. Locations are shown in Figure 6.  Details of these 
occurrences are beyond the scope of this report.

8.0  PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

The Platinex Shining Tree property has undergone significant exploration in three separate areas:  the 
Herrick Deposit, the Caswell area and the Churchill area.  There is also a mineralized trend on the west 
boundary of the property, which has been designated as the Speed Lake area and more recent efforts 
have been made follow up highly anomalous gold in till results near Bielby Lake, Ribble Lake – McBride, 
the Clarke showing area and Cryderman Lake.   

8.1   Herrick Deposit  

The geology of the Herrick area is interpreted to be dominantly Timiskaming age.  Regional mapping 
(Ayer 2000) indicated that a thick sequence of Timiskaming-age sediment is located just to the north of 
the area.  Property scale work by Unocal Canada Limited revealed that alkalic extrusive/intrusive rocks 
(trachyandesites based on whole rock geochemistry) are intercalated with conglomerate and wackes 
and extend further south than previously mapped during regional mapping programs (Figures 6 and 7).  
The alkalic rocks are assumed to be related to the Timiskaming sediments further north.  The 
stratigraphic relationship of a locally pyritic felsic fragmental unit located north of the main Herrick 
showing, in fault contact with greywacke, is unknown.  The felsic fragmental is either part of the 
Timiskaming-aged sequence or is faulted or in-folded portion of the older Keewatin sequence.  Strong 
silicification has been noted at the faulted felsic/greywacke contact, and was called a "silica cap" (Cluff, 
1990).  Another observation from drilling is that the Herrick veins appear to dilate towards the volcanic 
contact.  Parallel or sub parallel to the sedimentary and trachyte units the sediment volcanic contact 
trends WNW and dips steeply south.  
 
The most abundant rock types in the area of the Herrick deposit are clastic sediments, which occur 
either as wackes (greywacke) or conglomerate, with some gradation between the two units.  Wackes 
have been described as either fine-grained, silty, and laminated with intervals of siltstone, and graphitic 
argillite, or as fine to medium-grained, massive, arkosic to pebbly.  Greywacke can contain intervals of 
siltstone, argillite or graphitic sediment.  Conglomerate is generally boulder or cobble clast supported, 
with a feldspathic gritty matrix.  Clasts of granite, quartz, feldspar, felsic porphyry, felsic to mafic 
volcanic, siltstone, jasper, syenite, trachyte, silica cap breccias and pyrite have been noted within the 
conglomerate (Cluff, 1990 Figure 7). 
 
Alkalic flows or sills have been noted in outcrop as more or less two continuous conformable southeast 
trending units between the conglomerate and/or wacke units.  Diamond drilling by Unocal intersected 
several thick sections of "red porphyry", as well as a few dyke or sill-like bodies.  The mineralized 
Herrick shear/vein structure is often directly at a "red porphyry"-sediment contact.  From surface 
mapping, it appears that this may simply be the effect of displacement of trachytic and sedimentary units 
along the Herrick structure creating structural contacts, rather than original contacts controlling 
mineralization.  However, the use of the phrase "red porphyry" in the drill logs instead of trachytic 
volcanic rock indicates that drill core evidence observed by Cluff favoured an intrusive origin for the 
alkalic rocks.  Although the trachyte porphyry is irregular in shape and provinence in many cases, it 
does tend to be parallel or sub parallel to the sedimentary units. 
 
Small bodies of felsic porphyry were observed in drill core and were described by Cluff as grey feldspar 
porphyry or spotted feldspar porphyry. Grey feldspar porphyry is similar to the alkalic rocks, but with a 
carbonatized siliceous matrix, with spotted porphyry containing up to 1 cm diameter anhedral feldspar 
phenocrysts in a carbonatized siliceous matrix (Cluff, 1990). 
 
Three southeast trending diabase dykes, approximately 200-300 metres apart, cut all rock types.  The 
central diabase dyke cross-cuts the Herrick structure at a moderate angle (approximately 35 degrees), 
dips approximately 60 degrees southwest and is 10-15 metres thick.  The diabase appears to truncate 
the north-south trending, gold-bearing shear zone that hosts the Central Zone.  The parallel gold-

bearing, shear zone to the east hosts the Central Zone and appears to continue through and slightly 
offset the diabase dyke (Figure 7). 
 
Sub-parallel to the diabase dykes are a set of late sub-vertical, faults that cause little horizontal 
displacement of stratigraphy/structure and an unknown amount of vertical displacement.  One of these 
faults separates Timiskiming wacke from what appears to be Keewatin felsic fragmentals.  The fault 
may also truncate or displace the Herrick northward extension of gold zones. 
 
Gold mineralization at the Herrick deposit occurs along a north-south vein/shear structure. Movement 
along the structure is dextral and multi-staged, as evidenced by offset of an intruding diabase dyke 
along the Herrick structure.  Timiskaming aged rock units are displaced up to 50 metres horizontally and 
an unknown distance vertically.  Alteration consists of strong iron carbonatization, a moderate increase 
in potassium and a moderate decrease in sodium (Cluff, 1990). Sulphides are common in the 1-3% 
range, with minor arsenopyrite and tourmaline. 
 
Quartz veins, stringers and breccias occupy the main 2 to 5 metre wide portion of the structure, as well 
as numerous narrow sub-parallel to strongly discordant fracture, shear and alteration zones. These 
smaller features locally contain gold mineralization.  Larger splay features or parallel gold-bearing 
features have been designated as zones (Central Zone, West Zones and East Zones), such that the 
measure of the entire width of structure in which gold mineralization occurs is up to 80 metres, east to 
west (drill section 13+35N) (Figure 14).  Platinex's drilling showed that the splay structures are attractive 
targets for follow up exploration achieving widths of 46m in hole HP10-44. 
 
During the exploration by Platinex the state of the Unocal grid was examined.  The Unocal grid was 
established in 1989 as a metric grid and all exploration done by Unocal and limited work by Fort Knox 
Gold Resources used this grid for reference.  Very little of this grid is in evidence today around the 
power-stripped area.  Some landmarks could be used to re-establish this grid, as a great deal of the 
important historic work is referenced to it.  The grid is oriented north-south, with a 400m long baseline 
and cross lines at 50 metre intervals (total 4.83 line kms).  However, there were some inconsistencies 
with the Herrick grid and hence it was decided to transpose and map all data on a UTM grid.   
 
The claims immediately south of the original Unocal property are now part of the Platinex Inc. Shining 
Tree property.  At the time of Unocal's exploration programs the claims were being explored by INCO.  
The INCO grid line terminations are shown on Unocal maps, and some of INCO's work has been filed 
as assessment reports.  These reports show no indication of work done to physically trench or power-
strip overburden to locate the south extension of the Herrick vein structure, despite the fact that Unocal 
stripping extended to within a few metres of the INCO claim boundary.  There is a pencil notation on the 
Unocal geology map that some power-stripping has taken place just south of the Unocal/INCO 
boundary, but no results of this were observed or are known to be documented. 
 
Two gold-mineralized veins were located by Inco along the edge of a 300 degree trending topographic 
low occupied by a creek and bay forming part of Michiwakenda Lake. One showing "consists of four 
separate 15 to 25 cm wide, bluish white, quartz veins hosted by massive intermediate volcanic rock.  
The veins are mineralized with 3 to 5% pyrite and chalcopyrite in up to 4 cm diameter blebs that are 
distributed sporadically throughout the veins.  The veins occur in a parallel set spanning a width of 2 
metres.  The enclosed wallrock is moderately sheared parallel to the veins and is strongly chloritized.  
The vein set strikes at 260 degrees and dips 65 degrees to the southeast. A total of sixteen grab and 
chip-samples was collected from the veins and the chloritized wall rock" (Clark, 1989).  No assays are 
provided in Clark's report.  The second showing was located on the edge of a bay of Michiwakenda 
Lake.  A one to two metre wide "grey white quartz vein outcrops on the shoreline….striking 300 degrees 
with a vertical dip; it is hosted by moderately sheared and chloritic intermediate volcanics.  This vein is 
sporadically mineralized with 5-8% pyrite and chalcopyrite as isolated blebs to 2 cm in diameter.  A total 
of fourteen grab and chip-samples were collected from the vein and wallrock material." No assays for

this showing are provided in the report (Clark, 1989).  The two showings occur 500m south of the 
southern-most exposure of the Herrick vein structure. 
 
One till sample collected south of the Herrick deposit (North 5273111; East 484084; UTM NAD83 Zone 
17) some 200m returned a total count of 25 gold grains.  It is speculated that the source is actually east 
of the Herrick Central zone.  It is noteworthy that the Herrick Central zone exposing many tens of metres 
of strike length with high grade gold does not appear to have a highly anomalous gold in till signature. 

8.2   Caswell Area 

Geology of the Caswell area is dominated by Pacaud assemblage mafic volcanics and related 
subvolcanic diorite and gabbro.  Quartz porphyrys were noted by early workers in the area, but were not 
observed by Platinex geologists.  A distinctive feature of this area is the prolific development of quartz 
veins that occur on both sides of the West Shining Tree Creek often called Caswell Lake (Figure 8). 
 
Veins on the east side of the creek have been numbered by previous workers from 101 to 124. Veins on 
the west side of the creek have been numbered from 1 to 17.  No sampling plans have been located to 
define the extent and location of gold values within individual veins.  There were numerous sampling 
efforts by mining companies, geologists and mining engineers between 1916 and 1936.  Little of the 
data is properly documented with plans, sections, or assay certificates.  To date the most 
comprehensive review of the property is given by Bruce Edgar in a report for Practical Exploration and 
Development Corporation in 2001 and submitted for assessment credit.  The following summary is 
largely derived from Edgar's work, as well as MNDM annual reports and OGS open file reports.  
 
The earliest available data was from J. Messer in 1916.  He indicated that the No. 1 vein (renamed 7a 
vein) could be traced E-W for 1500 feet, averaged 1.0 feet in width and had 2.5 feet of sheared material 
on either side.  Multi-ounce per ton gold grades were reported from sampling of this vein with widths up 
to five feet on both sides of the creek.  Later workers did not assume the east and west veins were 
contiguous across the creek.  Assays from a 40 foot shaft sunk on the east shore portion of the vein 
also returned very high assays up to 19 ounces per ton over 12 inches.  The No. 2 vein was traced for 
500 feet and returned gold values of 2.26 ounces per ton over 31 inches, 0.293 ounces per ton over 23 
inches, and 0.767 ounces per ton over 78 inches.  Sampling of the northwest trending Saville vein (also 
named the No 4 vein), where exposed near the south boundary and shoreline, returned an average of 
1.49 ounces per ton over 33 inches.  No plans or maps for this data are known to exist. 
 
 R.W. Demorest in 1923 reviewed work done on the property to date and described the Saville or No. 4 
vein as being traceable for 1.5 miles at N 46°W and dipping 65°W.  A parallel shear zone 20 feet wide 
located beneath West Shining Tree Creek may have been a possible extension of the northwest 
trending Evelyn Vein that was explored to the southeast on the Bilmac property.  Sampling by Demorest 
on 11 veins included assays from 0.12 ounces per ton over 30 inches to 31.16 ounces per ton over 48 
inches. 
 
In 1925, C. Baycroft reported on a diamond drill program by Canadian Champion Reef Mining Company 
Limited that tested the Saville structure beneath Caswell Lake, as well as east-northeasterly striking 
veins on the east side of the lake.  Six of the seven holes reported high grade gold values over 5 and 10 
foot widths, and included 5.40 ounces per ton over 5 feet, 4.63 ounces per ton over 10 feet on the 
Saville structure, and 0.61 ounces per ton over 5 feet and 5.7 ounces per ton over 5 feet on veins on the 
east shore.  
 
The 92 foot deep shaft on the east side of the lake was also sunk around the same time, with 178 feet of 
drifting done from the bottom of the shaft.

Canadian Champion Reef Mining Company Limited then carried out development work, beginning in 
1928, on the west shore of the lake.  A shaft was sunk to 520 feet (No. 1 shaft), with levels at 100, 250, 
375 and 500 feet, with lateral development of 325 and 780 feet on the 250 and 500 foot levels.  
Unfortunately there is very little record of the sampling results from this work. 
 
By 1933 Canadian Champion Reef was re-organized into Burvan Gold Mines Ltd. and work was done to 
de-water the No. 1  shaft and re-sample the workings, correlate surface and underground workings, and 
follow-up on the favourable drilling program conducted in 1925 (Laird 1935).  Burvan also continued to 
prospect the surface veins, and located additional veins. 
 
In 1938, F. Austin examined the data available for the Caswell property and questioned the reliability of 
both the drilling and underground work.  He pointed to a lack of systematic underground sampling and 
mapping and lack of surface drilling to follow up the initial results obtained in 1925.  Apparently only 
assays for work on the 100 foot level were available.  Drifting on this level returned "good results" for 60 
feet.  One ton of ore treated by the Ontario Department of Mines from another section with quartz 
stringers and visible gold returned a gold value of 0.27 ounces per ton.  
 
There was no additional work done on the property until 1975, when New Bedford Explorations re-
sampled some of the trenches and drilled three holes.  Visible gold was noted in two of the holes, but 
the best gold assay was 0.085 opt over 2.5 feet.  Small bulk samples near the Number 2 shaft (Mike 
Newbury, personal communication) returned gold assays of up to 2.96 oz/t and silver assays up to 1206 
oz/t. 
 
In 1980, Tut Explorations de-watered and repaired the No. 1 shaft.  The second level (250') was 
mapped and sampled.  High grade samples were said to be obtained, but no assay plans are available. 
 
In 1987 Chesbar Resources examined the property and available data.  There is a mention that 
Falconbridge completed geophysical surveys and 2,434 feet of diamond drilling in four holes directed at 
the Saville structure.  No record of this work is available. Mike Perkins of Chesbar Resources collected 
106 grab samples and eleven samples returned greater than 0.1 oz/t Au.  
 
A 5,874 foot drill program supervised by Perkins, tested veins No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 as well as 
most of the veins on the east shore (No. 101 to 122).  Significant gold values were returned from the No. 
3 Vein (0.152 oz/t over 6 feet) and the No. 101 Vein (0.098 oz/t over 5 feet).   

8.3   Churchill Area 

Southwest of the Herrick area are a number of showings which appear closely related to the contact 
between the Deloro and Kidd-Munro assemblages.  These showings include the Cochrane, Gold-
Corona and Churchill vein/alteration systems.  The Churchill veins are covered by the Platinex Inc. 
Shining Tree property, as is part of the Deloro/Kidd-Munro contact (typically mapped as chemical 
sediments) further to the northwest. 
 
Laird visited the property in 1933 and reported visible gold in many places along the 30 metres of 
exposure in the No 1 vein and visible gold at the west end of the No 3 vein.  In a 1934 report he stated: 
"The south vein, known as No. l, and that part of No. 3 vein east of the fault occur in a light-coloured 
rhyolite or quartz porphyry, which is somewhat sheared at S80°E. This porphyry, which is probably a 
differentiated portion of the large granitic mass lying to the south, occurs as a narrow tongue pinching 
out a few hundred feet to the north of the showing. Locally, it is intersected by irregular stock works of 
narrow quartz stringers, which are reported to carry low values in gold. The veins are of the fissure type 
and are definitely later than the porphyry, since they cut it. The north-south faults displacing the veins 
belong to a late system of north-south fracturing characteristic of the whole region. In the case of the 
adjoining properties, (Gold Corona, Herrick, and Wasapika) the north-south fractures carry the gold-

bearing quartz veins, but on the Churchill property the east west fractures are in this respect the 
important ones." 
 
Laird also compiled the company assay plan and indicated that channel sampling of the No. 3 vein over 
a 90 metre exposure returned an average gold value of 27.5 g/t over a width of 1.2 metres and that a 
30.5 metre exposure of the No. 1 vein returned a gold value of 29.4 g/t over a 1.2 metre width. 
 
Unocal acquired the property in 1989 and compiled historic information, performed ground magnetic and 
VLF EM surveys and power-stripped the No. 3 vein for 95 metres and the No. 4 vein for 25 metres for a 
total of 205 linear metres.  Forty-eight channel samples and six composite chip/grab samples were 
collected and assayed, and four diamond drill holes (461 metres) were drilled to test the property. 
The geology in the vicinity of the old workings was mapped in detail by Cluff for Unocal Canada Ltd.  
The dominant rock type was felsic fragmental rocks, with associated crystal tuffs and cherty or graphitic, 
pyritic sediments and minor clastic sediments.  Mafic to ultramafic rocks occur within the felsic package 
as dark green black massive units.  Whole rock, petrography and microprobe data were used to verify 
rock types.  Some of the mafic volcanics were interpreted as altered feldspar porphyry of dioritic 
composition from this work (Cluff, 1990). 
 
Moderate to strong alteration and shearing of the felsic volcanic unit created zones of banded pink and 
yellow schists and mylonitic rocks.  Clots of pyrite occur sporadically throughout the felsic fragmental 
rocks. 
 
A chemical sediment horizon, that appeared to correlate with sulphide iron formation mapped on 
properties further to the northwest, is located in felsic fragmental rocks just to the north of the vein 
system and consists of alternating bands of chert, massive pyrite, black argillite and graphitic schist up 
to 10 metres wide. No base metal minerals were observed.  The geology is interpreted as to be 
indicative of a significant exhalative event wherein surrounding felsic fragmental rocks were sericitized 
and chloritized.  

8.4   Speed Lake area 

The Speed Lake area is interpreted to be underlain by Keewatin aged rocks of the Pacaud assemblage, 
that is, calc-alkaline and tholeiitic volcanic rocks and minor komatiitic rocks dated between 2745-2730 
(Figure 6).  A southwest trending feature which includes an extensive quartz vein system, altered mafic-
ultramafic rocks (iron-magnesium-carbonate-fuchsite) and altered felsic intrusive and extrusive rocks 
(quartz-sericite-chlorite-epidote) has been termed the Gosselin Vein or "Gosselin Rift Zone" (McCannell, 
1975). 
 
The "Gosselin Rift Zone" has been described as a zone of faulting, fracturing and shearing 
approximately 200 metres wide, trending 150 degrees and dipping sub-vertically. East-west to east-
southeast cross structures offset the zone, apparently by as much as 400 metres just south of Speed 
Lake.    Gold mineralization tends to be associated with an increase in pyrite mineralization from trace 
levels to 4-5% in carbonatized volcanic rocks.  Felsic volcanic rocks tend to be altered to sericite-
epidote-chlorite, while mafic to ultramafic volcanic are dolomitized, with fuchsite (green carbonate), or 
have been silicified.   
 
The eastern margin of the "Gosselin Rift Zone" is exposed on the western boundary of the Platinex 
property in Churchill Township, just south of Speed Lake. This area was the focus of a power-stripping 
program by Platinex Inc. in 2008 (See section 10.2 Speed Lake on current work – Speed Lake).  
 
Previous exploration work indicated that green carbonate rock, quartz veins and iron carbonate 
alteration occur along the southeast side of the Gosselin Zone, and locally trend onto the Platinex 
Shining Tree claims in Asquith Township.  Further to the southeast, a zone of quartz- carbonate

alteration and gold mineralization extends along an ultramafic unit mapped by Johns (Johns 2000). This 
trend hosts the Thompson-Peterson and Clarke gold occurrences on and close to the Platinex property 
and hosts he Buckingham gold deposit at the southeast extent, approximately two kilometres south of 
the Platinex Inc. claims. 
 
Drilling by Asquith Resources in 1989 on the Buckingham property intersected gold values in "a very 
distinctive pale green carbonate rock which had been intensely sheared and injected with grey, blue, 
and black quartz veins.  The shear zones may be up to 20 feet wide but the central core normally 
contains the higher gold values.  Disseminated pyrite was pervasive throughout the shears, and 
increased in quantity with intensity of shearing.  Gold was noted as minute specks along fracture zones 
in quartz veins.  Tourmaline was common in quartz. 
 
Among the better intersections in parallel sheared green quartz-veined carbonate zones: 
 
"C zone" 8.9 feet of 0.217 oz/t and 4.0 feet of 0.099 oz/t 
"D zone" 8.9 feet of 0.507 oz/t and 8.5 feet of 0.217 oz/t 
"E zone" 4.0 feet of 0.137 oz/t and 7.0 feet of 0.118 oz/t 
 
Intersections of a grey white quartz vein (without an associated strong carbonate shear) included: 
 
8.4 feet of 0.275 oz/t and 2.4 feet of 0.437 oz/t. 
   
The Clarke occurrence is on the southwest corner of the Platinex property in Asquith Township and is 
described as iron-magnesium-calcium carbonate with pyrite and quartz stockworks, some of which 
contain free gold (Gorden et al, 1979).  Hopkins (1920) described the occurrence as "rusty weathering 
green carbonate, impregnated in places with iron pyrites and containing a network of quartz veinlets.  
Gold could be seen in some of the quartz stringers.  The rock is an iron-magnesium-lime carbonate, 
with considerable silica, aluminum and a trace of nickel…on the northern part of the claim the carbonate 
is cut by red and grey granite-porphyry and near the contacts are large lenses of quartz somewhat 
similar to those on the Gosselin and carrying feldspar, galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite, talc and sometimes 
gold and other minerals."  Johns (2003) mapped dunitic komatiites in contact with a sill like gabbro at 
this location. 
          
The Thompson-Peterson occurrence is north-northwest of the Clarke occurrence, but is just west of the 
Platinex Inc. claims. The description is similar to the Clarke occurrence: a zone of rusty iron-
magnesium-calcium carbonate rock near a granite porphyry body, cut by a network of quartz stringers 
containing visible gold. 

9.0 MINERALIZATION 

The dominant style of gold mineralization on the Platinex Shining Tree property is shear-hosted quartz-
carbonate veins, generally associated with pervasive iron carbonate or green carbonate alteration and 
low levels of sulphidization.   

9.1   Herrick 

Gold mineralization at the Herrick Deposit is associated with quartz veins, pyrite, tourmaline and 
arsenopyrite, with better gold values often occurring in pyritic quartz vein breccias.  The quartz veins 
occur along a north-south trending zone of high strain that has displaced trachytic volcanic rocks and 
clastic sedimentary rocks, and provided a conduit for hydrothermal fluids.  Exploration work by Unocal 
Canada Ltd. delineated this high strain zone along a strike length of 300 metres and a maximum width 
of 80 metres. 
 



Summary Report for Platinex Inc., Shining Tree, Ontario

31 
 

Several types of porphyritic intrusive/extrusive rock types were delineated by Unocal.  The main units of 
interest are described as trachytes in surface mapping or red porphyry in drill logs.  The trachyte or red 
porphyry is assumed to be an extrusive volcanic or synvolcanic intrusive sill that has suffered metre to 
10's of metre scale movements along earlier north (Herrick vein structure) and later northwest and west-
northwest trending faults.  The trachytic rocks are observed to have undergone high strain, strong 
carbonate alteration, strong to intense quartz veining, and localized mineralization of pyrite, tourmaline, 
green mica, and minor arsenopyrite.   

9.2   Caswell area 

Gold is hosted by narrow quartz veins and lenses along shears oriented in a variety of directions, but 
generally either in a northwest or east-northeast direction.  These veins exhibit both compressional 
(drag folds) and tensional (boudinage) strain.  Quartz veins generally contain minor to 2% pyrite and 
local dark seams of chlorite and possibly very fine-grained tourmaline.  Wall rock to the veins is often 
sheared and fractured with strong iron carbonate alteration extending for several metres away from the 
vein.  Visible gold has been noted in the past, but was not observed by Bryant and Jamieson (2008). 
 
The Saville vein occurs as part of the regional northwest shear structure which hosts the Caswell veins 
and numerous occurrences to the southeast (Bilmac, Bennet, Atlas etc.). Where exposed on the 
Platinex Shining Tree property on the edge of Caswell Lake, the vein is up to a metre wide with quartz 
stringers developed in adjacent iron carbonate-rich schist.  Anomalous gold values were returned from 
chip and channel sampling done on the vein by Platinex in 2008.  Drilling by Platinex in 2010 tested the 
Saville and Evelyn veins severally revealing that both appear to be graphitic and pyritic interflow 
sedimentary units where tested (Figure 8). 

9.3   Speed Lake area 

Gold is hosted by quartz veining and stockworks within green carbonate or iron carbonate altered mafic 
to ultramafic volcanics.  Sulphides are generally a minor component of green carbonate-hosted 
mineralization, but are common in veins within more mafic rocks.  A few hundred metres west of the 
Platinex Shining Tree property, the Gosselin vein strikes 150 degrees and has been traced along strike 
for several kilometres.  It consists of white quartz-carbonate material with sporadic sulphide and gold 
mineralization.  In places the vein is greater than 10 metres wide (Carter, 1980). 

10.0  EVALUATION OF SHOWINGS  

Exploration activities during the summer of 2008 included detailed evaluation of showings at Caswell 
and Speed Lake. Stripping on Caswell was also done in 2010 and stripping south of Beilby Lake was 
done in 2011.  Caswell was drill tested in 2011 and Beilby Lake was drill tested in 2012.  Details are 
provided in the following sections. 

10.1   Caswell area 

In May and June of 2008, Platinex Inc. and Robert Macgregor conducted overburden stripping, washing 
and channel sampling on claim L4203531 in Macmurchy Township south of Michiwakenda Lake. The 
centre of the stripping is at 485940E and 5272055N (UTM Zone 17 NAD 83), with an exposed outcrop 
area totalling 1600 square metres. 
 
The area stripped is a prominent hill southeast of the muck piles near the Caswell No. 1 shaft area.  
Previous trenching in the area had revealed a number of quartz veins from which high gold values had 
been obtained.

The 2008 stripping program exposed the historic No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 or Saville veins.  The 
veins follow narrow (0.5 to 1.0 metre) fractures and shear zones, trending northeast or west southwest, 
within a locally carbonatized intermediate intrusive rock resembling diorite or leucogabbro.  Moderate to 
strong carbonate alteration extends from the vein/shear structures for several metres into the wall rock.  
Pyrite is common in proximity to veining, but is not pervasive or abundant.  The No. 4 or Saville vein is 
hosted by mafic volcanics and a volcanic fragmental unit exposed at the base of the hill on the shore of 
west Shining Tree Creek. 
 
Eighty-seven channel samples, six chip samples and one grab sample were taken and analyzed for 
gold at ALS Chemex in Vancouver.  The best assay results were from the No. 1 vein: 11.05 g/t over 
0.75m, 10.45 g/t over 0.5m, 5.99 g/t over 0.7m, 5.91g/t over 0.6m, 4.22 g/t over 0.75m.  One sample 
related to the No. 2 vein assayed 9.11 g/t over 0.5m. Twelve additional samples assayed greater than 
200 ppb.  Sieve metallic analysis of ten samples showed two samples with a significant contribution 
from the plus fraction, increasing final reported grade between 8 and 25 % from the minus fraction 
pulps. 
 
In October and November, 2010 Platinex conducted overburden stripping, washing and channel 
sampling on claims in Macmurchy Township south of Michiwakenda Lake and east of Caswell Creek.  
Quartz veins #101a, 101, 102 near shaft 2, 108, 109, 109a, 109b, 110, 111a, 115, 123 and L122 were 
exposed in eight trenches covering a total area of approximately 3,000m (Figure 8).  The work covered 
nine of thirty-nine veins identified in historic work. M. Spaho mapped the showings, Katrine Exploration 
washed and collected channel samples marked out by M. Spaho. 
 
The veins follow narrow 0.5 to 1.0m fractures and shear zones, trending 065° and 085° within locally 
carbonatized and sericitized intermediate to mafic metavolcanic and diorite.  Moderate to strong 
carbonate alteration extends from the vein/shear structures for several metres into the wall rock.  Pyrite 
is common proximal to veining. 
 
In total 370 channel samples, and 4 grab samples were taken and analysed for gold by ALS Chemex of 
Vancouver by fire assay. 
 
Individual channel samples returned numerous highly anomalous gold values including 10.55 g/t Au 
over/ 0.69m, 9.1 g/t over 1.0m, 4.69 g/t over 0.69m, 4.1 g/t over 0.44m, 4.41 g/t over 0.47m, 3.37 over 
1.03m, 3.57 over 0.54m in channel samples and up to 27.7g/t Au in grab samples.  In addition to these 
samples, 22 channel samples returned gold values greater than 0.7 g/t, three of which were greater 
than 2 g/t.  Anomalous silver and tellurium values were evident throughout the area sampled, with 
assays up to 2.15 g /t Ag and 1.1 g/t.  The gold enriched areas appear to be marginal to and probably 
beneath areas of anomalous silver-tellurium values, indicating the potential for Ag and Te to be 
important pathfinder elements.  
 
In March and April, 2011 Platinex completed a seven hole 1,070m drilling program on the Caswell area 
(Figure 8).  The first hole, WP11-01, returned a gold assay of 18.75 g/t over 0.5m within a broader zone 
of visible gold bearing quartz-tourmaline veining assaying 4.52 g/t over 2.52 m believed to be within vein 
108 and immediately south of trench 4. 
 
The remaining six holes focused on other shear zones, generally in locations that could not be easily 
accessed for trenching due to proximity to West Shining Tree Creek. A total of eleven separate quartz 
tourmaline vein/shear structures with anomalous gold values between 0.2 and 1 g/t were intersected, 
with total zone widths ranging from 1.5 to 22.5 metres. 
 
Six of the holes were surveyed by DGI Geoscience to provide structural orientation of veins and shears 
observed in the drill holes. This technique will help distinguish the numerous vein sets on the Caswell 
prospect. In addition, an I.P probe and natural gamma log probe were used to provide data on

chargeability, resistivity and alteration (dominantly potassic). A broad alteration system controlled by a 
nearly orthogonal conjugate fault system is evident. The current interpretation is that each of the zones 
outlined above is a separate structure within the overall conjugate fault pattern. The 2011 drilling along 
with the 2010 trenching programs have tested a small number of structures within an area of 700 m by 
400 m. 
 
These results helped explain some of the previously described highly variable but widespread 
distribution of the gold within the area comprising 39 documented shear-hosted veins within an overall 
broad (800m plus) east-north east (070°) trending structure. In addition the previous grab sampling by 
Chesbar Resources and Practical Mining can now be put in context and selected results are shown on 
the attached map (Figure 8) 

Two till samples were collected on the Caswell prospect returning highly prospective gold counts of 69 
grains and 19 grains. The sample taken down ice but near trench 1 is dominated by pristine grains 
indicating a probable nearby source possibly north of the known explored portion of Caswell veins.  

The Caswell area has been noted for some spectacular gold results flanked by a low tenor of gold 
mineralization.  It would appear that highly strained and altered areas hosting gold are limited in lateral 
extent and no continuous potentially commercial gold grades were noted.  However, the pathfinder 
associations such as tellurium and silver are very anomalous in all of these veins and provide evidence 
of the systematic nature of the mineralization. (Figure 8).  Casaceli (Personal Communication, 2011) 
stated that the Tyranite Mine has similar associations which he believed are common to gold-alkaline 
systems. 

10.2   Speed Lake Area 

In May and June of 2008, Platinex Inc. and Robert Macgregor conducted overburden stripping, washing 
and channel sampling on claim L1242934 in Churchill Township south of Speed Lake and north of 
Highway 560. The centre of the power-stripping is at 480618E and 5269978 (UTM Zone 17 NAD 83), 
with an exposed outcrop area totalling 1100 square metres. 

Old caved trenches, provided evidence of much earlier work in the area.  A number of exploration 
programs since the 1912 discovery of the gold-bearing Gosselin vein system, had examined the area 
just west of claim L1242934. 
 
The 2008 power-stripping program exposed ultramafic rocks with strong green carbonate alteration and 
significant areas of strongly developed quartz veining and quartz stock works.  Traces of sulphide 
mineralization were observed, along with minor areas of pervasive silicification.  The northern most 
outcrop in the trench was relatively fresh mafic volcanic in low angle fault contact with the green 
carbonate altered ultramafics. 
 
Fifty-eight channel samples and seven grab samples were taken and analyzed for gold at ALS Chemex 
in Vancouver.  The best assay results were 4.58 g/t over 2.5 metres, 3.91 g/t over 1.2 metres and 1.74 
g/t over 1.0 metres.  Three other samples returned values over 200 ppb with no significant results from 
the remaining channel and grab samples.  Spatial clustering of these results suggests that a rubble-filled 
fault zone may control mineralization.  Although some screen metallic assaying was done on selected 
channel samples, no such assaying was done on the samples with higher gold values.  As a check the 
rejects of samples assaying greater than 200 ppb should be sent to a second lab for screen metallic 
analysis to confirm gold mineralization and understand the size distribution of gold grains within the 
samples.  Further removal of rubble from fault-controlled depressions would facilitate follow-up channel 
sampling.

10.3    Beilby Lake Area 

Follow up prospecting and stripping up ice direction from two high gold in till sample results (71 total 
gold grains in sample 54787) south of Bielby Lake resulted in the location of an area of elevated gold 
values in outcrop (Figure 9).  Grab sample values to 0.75g/t Au were obtained and later channel 
samples recovered values of up to 2.65 g/t Au/ 0.56m. 

The area exposed is underlain by well preserved unstrained variolitic pillowed basalts with modest 
hyaloclastite, a narrow unit of felsic volcaniclastics both intruded by an altered moderately to strongly 
magnetic grabbro.  A 070° 0.5 – 1.0m thick rusty carbonate shear zone cuts and appears to sinistrally 
displace the various rocks approximately 20 metres.  A NNW shear in turn displaces the 070° shear 
dextrally approximately 10m.  The best value in channel sampling which was keyed to the 070° shear 
was 2.65 g/t Au/0.56m.  Due to the widespread anomalous gold values and the high gold in till values 
which had not yet been adequately explained it was decided to cover the area with pole-dipole spectral 
IP and drill higher priority anomalies. 

Lines for the IP survey were run at 200m intervals in a north-south orientation tied to the Herrick grid 
with a tie line at 8+00S crossing on the south side of the Bielby Lake exposure very close to the till 
sample location.  Line 8+00W is within 15m of the outcrop on the east and line 10+00 W is 
approximately 115m west of the outcrop. 

Hole BP12-01 was collared at 10+40W on the line 8+00N drilled due west to test a strong chargeability 
anomaly with high resistivity close to surface and low resistivity at depth.  The hole intersected variolitic 
pillowed mafic volcanics from top to bottom of the hole at 170m.  The rock is mineralized with fine 
grained pyrite throughout chiefly in selvedges.  The pillows are apparently unstrained.  Due to a budget 
shortfall detailed logging and sampling were deferred. 

Hole BP12-02 was spotted at 9+00S on line 8+00 W and drilled due north to intersect a strong IP 
anomaly.  The hole intersected a sequence of predominantly felsic volcanic flows and fragmentals 
contacted by mafic volcanics and ending in diabase and trachyte.  The felsic volcanics are intensively 
sericitized and hematized with intense quartz carbonate flooding over an 11m zone.  Sulphides are 
disseminated throughout with stronger mineralization associated with quartz carbonate veining including 
trace chalcopyrite.  The rock is relatively unstrained, however, and the assay results were low.  

11.0   GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS  

11.1    Regional Gravity Surveys  

The Ontario Geological Survey supervised and edited the compilation of digital gravity data obtained 
from the National Gravity Data Base maintained by the Geophysical Data Centre, Geological Survey of 
Canada (Gupta, 1991).  The reconnaissance-scale data indicated that most, if not all of the property 
correlates with the middle portion of a composite gravity anomaly.   The highest gravity responses 
extend northwest from the community of Shining Tree and from the east part of Macmurchy Township 
into Fawcett Township. 
 
Gravity anomalies indicate thicker sequences of earth's crust where there would be a greater potential 
for partial melting and development of convection cells that could cause leaching of gold from thick 
volcanic, sedimentary and plutonic sequences, migration of the gold along structural conduits and the 
subsequent deposition of the gold in areas such as the Shining Tree property.

11.2   Airborne Geophysical Surveys   

11.2.1   Prior Surveys  

The Ontario Geological Survey commissioned an airborne magnetic and time domain electromagnetic 
(TDEM) survey which was flown for the Ontario Geological Survey by Geoterrex in 1990.  The survey 
was completed with a fixed wing configuration that included a magnetometer system and GEOTEM II 
TDEM system. Flight line separation was 200 metres and the regional survey area included the Platinex 
project area.  
 
Features interpreted from the total field data are: 
 

-   A magnetic anomaly apparently coincident with the diabase dike at the Herrick deposit. The 
feature extends somewhat intermittently south through the area just west of the Ronda Mine, on 
to the south-southeast beyond the property. 

-   Stronger magnetic response typical of the southwest part of the property is associated with mafic 
to ultramafic volcanic rocks. 

-   A magnetic high and flanking magnetic low in the area northwest of the Herrick deposit appear to 
reflect a folded feature associated in large part with the Timiskaming sediments identified by 
Carter and by Johns. 

-   Magnetic lows along most of Michiwakenda Lake and on to the south-southeast suggest the 
presence of the major fault. 

-   Distinctive, narrow north-northwest trending magnetic highs that cross the east block of the 
property likely indicate unmapped diabase dikes and likely a formational contact between mafic 
to intermediate and intermediate to felsic volcanic rocks.  

-   The northwest trend of the showings that had underground development, including the Caswell 
deposit, correlate with a magnetic low. 
 

The second vertical derivative maps provided improved resolution of the features described above and 
also indicates: 
 

-   Significantly improved delineation of the individual lithological units identified by Carter and

-   Indications that northeast trending faults or shear zones may be common. 
-   A common, pattern of apparent discontinuity of magnetic features caused by the wide-spaced 

flight lines. 
 
The electromagnetic data from the survey indicated two conductive features apparently associated with 
bedrock and one anthropogenic-related anomaly that coincides with the community of Shining Tree and 
Highway 560. The largest electromagnetic anomaly extends about two kilometres with only minor 
segments associated with the west-central part of the property. It appears to be correlated with 
Churchill, Gold Corona to Cochrane showing and deposits which appear to be associated with the top of 
the Deloro assemblage and the adjacent intermediate to felsic intrusive. The potential for sulphide 
related gold mineralization and for base metal volcanogenic deposits both need to be considered. The 
second airborne EM anomaly appears to be a single-line anomaly located adjacent to the shore of 
Michiwakenda Lake near the north end of the property. 
 
The overall impression was that more detailed airborne magnetic data would provide significant 
improvement in resolution to facilitate more accurate interpretation of structural features as well as 
lithological units that may host or coincide with many of the gold-bearing zones.

11.2.2   Platinex Airborne Survey  

In July of 2008, Platinex contracted Terraquest Inc. to conduct a fixed-wing airborne survey on the 
Shining Tree project.  A total of 491 line-kilometres were flown with the following sensors:  
 

• High resolution aeromagnetic 

• Horizontal magnetic gradiometer- 

• XDS VLF EM 

• Radiometrics (gamma ray spectrometer) 

 
The nominal line spacing for the 050/230 degree oriented traverses was 100 metres, with nominal 
aircraft clearance of 70 metres.  Sample interval for sensors was 7-8 metres. 
 
The survey was based out of Sudbury and completed on July 28, with complete coverage of the 
Platinex Shining Tree claim group.  The calculated first vertical derivative of the magnetic field (Figure 
11) and Anomaly Map from VLFEM survey (Figure 12) are provided from this work. 
 
Z. Dvorak (2008) provided an interpretation of the Terraquest survey.  The following are the highlights 
and a map (Figure 13) is included. 
 

• A swarm of diabase dikes with azimuths of 160° to 170° is a prominent feature across the property 
with some 22 dikes evident forming narrow linear anomalies on Calculated Vertical Derivatives of 
Magnetic Field 'CVD'. 
 

• A 110° fracture F1 associated with change in direction of diabase cuts across Cryderman Lake. 
 

• Second fracture F2 is associated with well defined magnetic anomaly MI associated with dunitic 
komatiite near south west corner of property.  The area A is a reflection of high potassium and low 
magnetic values and has been mapped as a mafic to ultramafic intrusive.  A hook like magnetic 
anomaly M2 and M3 is separated by 050° fracture F3 which trends from southwest of property to 
Michiwakenda Fault at Foisey Lake.  Evidence for the fault is provided by both topography and 
magnetic data. 
 

• Anomalies M6 and M7 are believed to reflect iron formations which are not magnetic everywhere.  
Area B has been mapped as Timiskaming Clastic metasediments which is close to the iron 
formation (M6). 
 

• The CVD data near the Herrick deposit shows excellent correlation with bedrock features.  The 
trachyte porphyry is defined by anomaly M8 and the veins are expressed as breaks in the 
magnetic patterns.  Anomaly M4 which appears discontinuous from south of Hwy 560 appears to 
intersect the Herrick deposit at a low angle.  Parallel anomaly M5 appears to lie just east of the 
known extent of the Herrick deposit. 
 

• Anomaly M9 wraps an area of intermediate to mafic volcanics around the periphery of which 
several gold deposits including Ronda, Caswell and Bilmac are located.  This feature may actually 
be terminated by the F3 fracture set which also appears to penetrate the Michiwakenda fault.  
Dvorak also pointed to the unique magnetic feature M2 centred in the NE corner of the McBride 
lease.  It is now suggested that this may be related to the syenite intersected in drill hole MP-12-
01 to the northeast.

• This magnetic anomaly coincides in part with VLF ORTHO anomaly V02 which appears to 
terminate at the Michiwakenda Lake fault.  VLI is a linear VLF anomaly that appears to associate 
with an 'iron formation'. 
 

• Dvorak draws attention to several of the VLF ORTHO anomalies that appear to represent bedrock 
features (Figures 2 and 13).  He notes that the radiometric potassium anomalies appear to reflect 
positive areas but draws attention to an ORTHO anomaly coincident with a potassium anomaly on 
the west side of Caswell.  

11.3    Ground Geophysical Surveys  

Platinex has completed several focussed ground geophysical surveys on the property including walking 
magnetometer and pole dipole IP surveys. Numerous small blocks of EM and magnetic surveys have 
been done at various times and locations, by various interests, on the current Platinex Shining Tree 
claim block. No comprehensive ground geophysical surveys of the area have been documented.  
Compilation of the smaller surveys is ongoing, but will not provide complete coverage of the property. 
 
JVX 2010a was commissioned to conduct an IP and magnetometer survey over the Herrick deposit 
covering 3.075km of IP resistivity and 6.818km of magnetometer surveys.  The Herrick deposit was 
found to not be chargeable at surface but other parallel anomalies were found specifically to the east of 
the Herrick Central zone that warrant follow up work. 
 
In 2011 JVX (2011a & b) conducted ground magnetometer surveys over Michiwakenda Lake and 
Perkins Lake covering 70 and 33.5 line km respectively.  The line spacing was variable but 
approximately 12.5m and the readings were taken every second or at 2m intervals approximately 
coupled with GPS readings.  The data enable accurate mapping of the diabase and trachyte and enable 
identification of structures. 

11.4   Down Hole Geophysical Surveys  

In 2010 Platinex commissioned a downhole IP survey by JVX (2010b).  The survey was conducted from 
September 29 to October 3, 2010 and carried out on six holes HP09-33, HP10-43, HP10-44, HP10-45, 
HU89-6 and HU89-9.  Results vary from hole to hole but one prominent anomaly is indicated in HP09-
33 at the bottom of the hole and to the south.  The zone is related to a chloritized zone in core which 
has not been assayed. 
 
In 2011 DGI Geoscience was engaged to conduct downhole surveys of six holes on the Caswell 
prospect.  A multi test process was used down the hole to provide structural orientation and also 
employing an IP probe and a natural gamma log probe to provide information on chargeability, resistivity 
and alteration (dominantly potassic). 

12.0   GEOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS    

12.1    Regional Lake Sediment Survey 

The Ontario Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) have performed a regional 
lake sediment and lake water survey in the Shining Tree area.  Multi-element analyses of lake sediment 
and lake water samples from the Shining Tree area were released in 2001 report by Russell and 
Hamilton.  The ICP-MS analytical technique was used for a wide variety of elements from both the 
sediments and lake water samples.  The FA /ICP-MS technique was used for Au, Pd and Pt.

Two anomalous areas were defined in close proximity to, but not coincident with, the Shining Tree   
property.  The ``Area B`` anomaly is comprised of 15 lakes from South Sandstrum Lake, about three 
kilometres east of the main block, to Jerry Lake in the northeast, about one kilometre south of the east 
extremity of the east block.  Anomalous elements included the PGMs and some base metals.  Most 
pertinent to this project is the indication that anomalous gold was present down-ice from the eastern 
portion of the Platinex Shining Tree property.  Sites 277 and 382 returned concentrations of 5 to 7 ppb 
Au. 
 
Another location, Site 279, adjacent to anomalous site 277 did not return anomalous gold in the OGS 
survey but had returned a value of 95 ppb Au in a GSC survey (Hornbrook and Friske, 1988).  The 
presence of a gold occurrence on the western shore of the lake may, or may not negate the possibility 
of gold occurrences in the up-ice direction.  It is also worth noting that there are no lakes between Jerry 
Lake and the West Montreal River, that is, in the down-ice direction from the south eastern part of the 
east portion of the Platinex property.  
 
Johns (1999) showed the bedrock geology to be a northwest trending band of intermediate to felsic tuff 
breccia which is dissected by a gabbroic intrusion. A number of small Matachewan diabase intrusions 
have also been mapped. The geophysical data for the area shows a number of small, discontinuous 
magnetic highs which may represent additional intrusions without surface expression. Nearly all of the 
geochemical anomalies are within lakes entirely or partially underlain by the metavolcanic rocks. In 
addition, much of the area is covered with ice-contact glacial deposits. The materials which make up the 
ice-contact deposits are not necessarily sourced proximal to the area, and may also have some 
influence on some of the lake sediment results. The fact that the anomalies show some correlation to 
the underlying bedrock and are not scattered throughout the area is encouraging. 
 
The second anomalous area, referred to as "Area 12: West Shining Tree Area", was located west of the 
Platinex property.  Nine to seventeen lakes had elevated to anomalous Cu, Cd, Zn, +/- REE.  One of the 
three most anomalous lakes (Site 1037) returned a sample analysis of 205.2 ppm Cu, 273 ppm Zn, 3.62 
ppm Cd, 133 ppm Cr and highly anomalous REEs (Y and Be).  The base metal anomalies indicate the 
associated volcanic stratigraphy could host base metal deposits and the OGS suggested the REE 
results may represent an area of hydrothermal alteration of the mafic to intermediate volcanic bedrock.   

12.2   Lithogeochemical Studies 

Petrographic work was done by the OGS, using samples collected by H.S. Oliver and G.W. Johns from 
1997 to 1999, generally concentrated along the access provided by Highway 560. More than 380 
samples were taken from the Keewatin assemblages, more than 70 from the Timiskaming 
volcaniclastics, and 50 from Timiskaming sediments. Trace element/immobile elements were along with 
medium and heavy rare earth element analysis, were used to classify and differentiate lithological units 
with an emphasis on differentiating mafic to ultramafic units. 

12.3   On-Site Geochemical Surveys  

12.3.1   Basal Till Sampling      

In June of 2008, a reconnaissance till sampling program was initiated over the Platinex Shining Tree 
property.  Subsequent till sampling has been carried out in 2010 and 2011.  From 2008 through to June 
2011 samples were taken from hand dug surface till pits.  The sampling pattern took advantage of 
highway, logging road, trail and lake access and focused on the central, west and northern portions of 
the property.  The property has moderate topographic relief and till is reasonably well exposed on hills 
and higher plateau areas with bedrock often within 1.5 metres of surface.  Lower areas are covered with 
sandy outwash or organics greater than 1.5 metres thick and are not practically sampled with hand dug

39 
 

pits.  The later 2011 sampling was done using trails and a backhoe or excavator.  There were a total of 
307 samples taken but some of these were later rejected as silt, sand, gravel or organics. 
 
The later 2011 sampling program was subject to a different process.  First of all the samples were taken 
at approximately 50m intervals along trails or beside roads.    Where possible a sample of bedrock was 
taken for identification and subsequent analysis.  The samples were preanalysed and a smaller number 
were sent for processing by ODM.    
 
The goal for each hand dug pit was to obtain 12-15 kg of screened sample, taken from beige, relatively 
non-oxided till, close to or on the bedrock/till interface (basal till).  Screening of large pebbles and 
cobbles larger than 6mm reduced shipping and handling weights and a rep sample of > 6mm pebbles 
for each sample was archived.  The backhoe sampling achieved smaller average samples of 5 to 8 kg 
after screening. 
 
Samples were shipped to Overburden Drilling Management (ODM) Limited for processing.  All samples 
were processed for gold grain recovery and 12 samples were also processed for kimberlite indicator 
minerals. Gold grain recovery data is presented as the number of individual grains for each sample that 
fall into the shape categories of round, modified and pristine.  Pristine grains have delicate features 
preserved, modified grains retain some form of the delicate features, and round grains exhibit no original 
features.  These criteria enable an estimate of grain transport to be made in addition to defining gold 
dispersal trains based on numbers of grains. 
 
A total of 446 till samples were processed by ODM.  A total of 4,792 gold grains were recovered, of 
which 737 are modified and 595 are pristine.   A total of 29 samples had greater than ten pristine plus 
modified gold grains.   
 
 Kimberlite indicator minerals other than chromites were present in six of the twelve samples processed.   
 
Total counts were six chrome diopsides, one pyrope garnet and two kimberlitic olivines.  High chromite 
counts occurred in most samples and were interpreted to be from ultramafic rocks south of Timmins 
(Averill, personal communications).  No probe work on kimberlite indicator minerals was done.  
 
Of the 446 till samples processed by ODM 209 samples contained 9 gold grains or more.  These 
samples are clustered in two large areas (Figure 17) which define two of the more significant gold 
dispersion trains in the Abitibi gold region.  Further 14 samples contain 50 or more gold grains including 
3 that contain more than 100 grains. 
 
The main gold dispersion train is elongated along a 060° trending axis which coincides with several 
noted geological and geophysical features.  In addition some of the higher total gold grain counts and 
the higher pristine plus modified gold grain counts tend to cluster along the northern edge of the gold 
train and also about a circular feature coinciding with an East West trending XDS ORTHO anomaly west 
of Michiwakenda Fault and straddling Hwy 560.  It is suggested from the drilling program that an alkalic  
stock is associated with much of this area.  Also an ENE trending deformation zone identified by Johns 
(1996) crosses the Michiwakenda Lake Fault and coincides with the gold dispersion train.  This 
deformation zone is believed to reflect the Larder Lake Break or a related splay (Figures 6, 17, 18). 

The heavy mineral fractions from 199 of the till samples were subjected to whole rock analysis by ALS 
Chemex of Vancouver.  Several parameters show anomalous results on the property.  There is a 
correlation in general with the deformation zone and with NNW trending features such as the 
Michiwakenda Fault. Figures 19 to 22 display the variation in values for arsenic, sulphur, nickel and 
copper.

13.0   DRILLING 

13.1   Historic Drilling 

The most significant drilling completed to-date on the Shining Tree property was at the Herrick Deposit 
and to a lesser degree at the Churchill occurrence.  The location of only one drill hole collar has been 
confirmed.  Another eleven holes were completed by Unocal in 1989. 

13.2   Platinex Drilling  

From 2009 to 2011 Platinex completed 51 holes for 6181m on the Herrick deposit and strike extensions, 
7 holes for 1070m on the Caswell occurrences in 2011.  In 2012 Platinex drilled 5 holes for 870m to 
follow up coincident gold in till and IP anomalies in the Clark, Beilby and McBride areas.  Due to budget 
limitations the logging and sampling of all five holes could not be completed and only selective work was 
done after a quick log of all five holes. 
 
All 61 holes are shown on Figure 7 along with the surface geology as mapped by Unocal and later 
supplemented by Mehmet Spaho.  Differences in interpretation still need to be reconciled, Cross Section 
13+ 35N, is provided as Figure 14 without Platinex data added.  The gold grades and intersection 
widths are provided on the section. Of particular note is the apparent continuity of the Central and East 
gold-bearing zones to depth.  The drill hole plan Figure 7 and Longitudinal section Figure 15  are also 
shown. 

14.0   DATA COMPILATION AND SYNTHESIS 

14.1   Herrick Deposit 

Complete paper records of Unocal drilling and channel sampling, including assay certificates, for the 
Herrick deposit were located and compiled into a digital database. Exploration records from work done 
by Herrick Gold Mines between 1918 and 1923, were compiled in 1935 by Grantland Gold Mines Ltd. 
and Erie Canadian Mines compiled a 300' level plan with sample locations.  Collar location information 
was limited.  Four drill holes were presented on one section with the distance of the collar denoted from 
either the shaft or vein. Northings were inferred for holes one and four from the presence of the shaft in 
the section in the first case, and a note on there being an orebody in hole four near the shaft.  Hole 2 
was located in the field by Unocal, and the location of hole 3 was inferred from a location on the 
Churchill and Connaught geology map (Carter 1980).  Quartz-rich zones and geology are marked on the 
original Herrick Gold Mines sections which aid in correlating location, as well as confirming to some 
degree the location of the gold-bearing zones.  The data for Herrick Gold Mines drill holes has not been 
placed in the database due to the lack of documentation; thus, these holes were not plotted on the 
sections or plan (Figures 7 and 14).  However, approximated pierce points of the drill holes have been 
added to the longitudinal section of the Central Zone (Figure 15) so as to present the data on an 
approximate basis that adds some value to the overall interpretation.  The drilling by Platinex was 
unable to confirm the reported tenor of the Herrick Gold Mine drill holes. 
 
Channel sampling of the stripped portions of the Herrick vein structure have been done by several 
companies over the years, with the earliest documented in 1918 by Herrick Gold Mines.  Results from 
this data are known only from a compilation done by mining engineer H.B. Hatch for Grantland Gold 
Limited in 1935.  The Herrick channel sampling occurred in five areas identified as A, B, C, D and E 
along with calculated average values and widths. Lengths of channels average approximately 1.25m, 
with the majority between 1.0 and 1.5 metres.  Several of these channels are evident in outcrop and are 
similar to channel samples pre-dating 1940 that were recently observed at the Caswell and Speed

power-stripped areas.  Channels were hand moiled at a consistent depth and width (generally wider and 
shallower than saw channels) and give an impression that care was taken to representatively sample 
the structures but representing probably triple the volume of sample compared to saw channels. 
 
Extensive sampling (201 channel samples, 35 composite grab/chips) was done by Unocal Canada 
Limited in 1989 after power stripping the area.  This information is well documented in an exploration 
report by G. Robert Cluff, including assay certificates, and sampling maps.  Locations and some of the 
grades and channel width information are provided on a representative cross section (Figure 14), and 
on the longitudinal section (Figure 15). 
  
Additional sampling of the Herrick vein structure was completed by Fort Knox Resources as part of a 
more regional examination of the Shining Tree area. Forty-five channel samples were taken and 
documented by Doug Hunter in 1990.  Sample locations and grade/width information are included on 
Figures 14 and 15. 
 
Following is a summary of surface sampling work done to date on the Herrick vein structure: 
 

•  Three channel samples at the shaft area by Herrick Gold Mines reported gold values of 15.9 g/t 
over 1.25 metres, 24.9 g/t over 1.25 metres, and 16.9 g/t over 1.25 metres. Sampling by Unocal 
returned 8.8 g/t over 1.5 metres.  Sampling by Fort Knox Gold Resources had yielded 13 g/t over 
0.4 metres. 

 
•  North of the shaft, in what is now interpreted to be the Central Zone, Herrick Gold Mines 

reported 32 channel samples taken over a 50 metre strike length averaged 7.5 g/t over 1.25 
metres, with the highest assay at 14.6 g/t and two channels returning Nil gold values. Unocal  
channel sampled 10 sections in this area, with best results of 14.7 g/t over 1.0 metres, 6.6 g/t 
over 1.0 metres, 9.8 g/t over 2.0 metres, and 7.9 g/t over 1.8 metres.  Fort Knox cut three 
channels in this area with results of 3.31 g/t over 1.15 m, 9.49 g/t over 1.8m and 12.76 g/t over 
1.75 m. 

 
•  Immediately south of the shaft the Central Zone continues.  Herrick Gold Mines reported that 17 

channel samples on this part of the Central Zone were taken over a 25 metre strike length and  
averaged 25.5 g/t over 1.15 metres.  Thirteen samples returned assays over 15 g/t, with the 
highest assay 106.3 g/t and lowest assay 3.3 g/t.  Channel sampling of this area by Unocal 
returned 56.5 g/t over 1.0m, 16.77 g/t over 0.5 metre, 4.8 g/t over 1.0 metre and 0.82 g/t over 
1.0m.  Visible gold was noted in outcrop.  No channel sampling was done by Fort Knox in this 
area. 

 
•  South of the diabase and 100 metres south of the shaft, Herrick Gold Mines reported 28 channel 

samples taken over a 50 metre strike length of the vein, averaged 20 g/t over 1.3 metres.  The 
highest gold assay was 200 g/t and the lowest assay was 4.0 g/t.  Five samples assaying over 
15 g/t.  Unocal cut 12 sections of channel samples in this area, with the best gold assay results 
being 12.5 g/t over 1.5 metres, 3.9 g/t over 2.0 metres, and 5.7 g/t over 2.6 metres.  Composite 
grab samples taken from the vein on the north part of this section returned gold values of 30 g/t, 
20.41 g/t, 16.01 g/t, 2.54 g/t, 2.4 g/t, and 2.02 g/t.  Fort Knox focused their sampling in this area 
with 7 channelled sections which returned 7.9 g/t over 0.5 metres, 5.5 g/t over 0.45 metres, 2.85 
g/t over 1.65 metres, 4.0 g/t over 1.15 metres, 5.1 g/t over 1.25 metres, 5.0 g/t over 0.85 metres, 
and 5.56 g/t over 1.7 metres. 

 
•  Fifteen metres south of the current Unocal grid of 11+50N, Herrick Gold Mines reported 10 

channel samples over a 15 metre strike length, averaging 7.2 g/t over 1.2 metres.  The highest 
gold value was 11.3 g/t and the lowest gold value was 0.4 g/t.  Unocal cut 5 channels in this 
area, with the best results being 4.9 g/t over 1.4 metres and 4.2 g/t over 1.0 metres.  Four grab

42 
 

samples from the area returned gold values of 25 g/t, 25.91 g/t, 0.75 g/t and 0.43 g/t.  Fort Knox 
cut five channel sections in this area, which returned: 26.94 g/t over 0.88m, 9.02 g/t over 1.25m, 
0.94 g/t over 1.0m, 4.90 g/t over 0.8 m, and 5.16 g/t over 1.3 m. 

 
The only documented underground work was done by Herrick Gold Mines Limited between 1918 and 
1923.  Sampling of the top 25 metres of the shaft returned consistently high gold grades of 50 g/t across 
1.5 metre widths (Figure 15).  Eighteen samples were taken, with the highest gold value at 329 g/t and 
the lowest value at 6.4 g/t.  Fourteen samples were greater than 15 g/t, eight samples greater that 30 g/t 
and three samples were greater than 100 g/t.  
 
The only other documented underground assay results come from a level plan of the 300 foot level, 
redrawn by Erie Canadian Mines in 1935.  The locations and grades have been indicated on Figure 15.  
The Central zone was mapped and sampled from a point approximately 6m south of the shaft, south 
approximately 60 metres to the contact with the diabase dyke.  On the south side of the diabase dyke, a 
vein structure (possibly the West Zone based on drill section interpretation) is sampled for 30 metres, 
with the end of drift sample having a gold assay of 4.11 g/t over 0.33 metres.  Samples were taken 
across either the back or face at approximately 1.5 metre intervals.  Significant gaps in sampling occur 
where the structure was deemed to be too narrow or where no quartz veining was observed. Sample 
widths range from 0.2 to 1.7m across the shear/vein structure. 
 
Four sections on the 300 foot level that have both continuous sampling and some of the better individual 
sample grades and widths are as follows:  
 

•  Central Zone: Centred on section 12+95, a 12.5 metre length of vein assayed 6.55 g/t over an 
average width of 0.78 metres; Centred on section 12+60, a 6.4 m length of vein assayed 9.62 g/t 
over an average width of 0.45 meters; 

•  West Zone: Centred on section 11+90, a 10.7 m length of vein assayed 9.87 g/t over an average 
width of 0.97 metres; Centred on section 11+75, a 17.3 m length of vein assayed 3.76 g/t over 
an average width of 3.76 metres. 

 
Sampling of the drift was sporadic, resulting in sections of vein with good grade lacking continuous 
sampling.  An example is a 3.4 metre long section of vein assaying 12.25 g/t over an average width of 
0.7 metres.  The sample plan denotes no sampling due to a lack of veining for a few metres both north 
and south of this section along the drift. 

14.2   Caswell area 

Previous work on the Caswell occurrences have been compiled and presented on Figure 8.  A 
description of previous work was in section 8.2 herein. 

14.3   Churchill area 

The Unocal data from the 1989 channel sampling and drilling program have not been entered into the- 
database.  The bedrock was mapped by M. Spaho. The location and sampling results of underground 
development is unknown. 

14.4   Speed Lake Area 

No compilation has been done in this area.  Some drill hole results just west of the property are 
available and should be added to a database along with all other information regarding the Gosselin

trend in Churchill and Asquith Townships.  Recent till and airborne surveys completed by Platinex Inc. 
will add greatly to compilation work in this area. 

15.0   SAMPLE COLLECTION, HANDLING AND PREPARATION  

Exploration Work Pre-1989 

No documents exist detailing the sampling methodology prior to 1989. 
 
1989 Exploration Work done by Unocal (Churchill and Herrick Areas) 
Channel samples and split diamond drill core were sent to Swastika Laboratories in Kirkland Lake, 
Ontario.  Drill core was of NQ size and mechanically split, with one assay tag remaining in the core box.  
Core is stored at "Camp 560" located on the north side of highway 560, between the Bay Lumber Road 
and Houston Lake tourist camp. 
 
Channel sampling was well done, and accurately mapped.  Splitting/sampling of drill core appeared 
carefully and well done, with blocks and sample tags generally still intact.  Wooden boxes are beginning 
to weather badly in a few cases, but are well labelled.  It is perceived especially in view of drilling by 
Platinex that all of the core in the vicinity of the veins on Herrick should be systematically assayed.  
 
1990 Exploration Work by Fort Knox (Herrick Area) 
Channel samples were sent to Swastika Laboratories in Kirkland Lake, Ontario.  Samples in the Herrick 
area were generally taken in areas of Unocal sampling, possibly as a direct check on previous results.  
Removal of sample material from channel cuts was acceptable. 
 
2008 – 2011 Platinex Rock Samples 
In 2008, Platinex took grab samples, chip samples and channel samples from various areas on the 
Shining Tree property as part of a due diligence program and a preliminary phase of exploration.  Grab 
samples and chip samples were also taken of representative rock and historic muck piles by Platinex 
personnel.   
 
Channels samples were taken from power-stripped areas, during and after the bedrock was mapped, 
using a gas powered masonry saw utilizing a water-cooled diamond impregnated blade.  Sample 
lengths were recorded in assay books and samples were chipped from bedrock, placed in individual 
heavy duty plastic sample bags and labelled.  Channel cutting and sampling work was performed by 
personnel from Katrine Exploration Services, Larder Lake, Ontario, under supervision from Platinex field 
geologists. Each sample received a pre-numbered assay tag from the assay book, and an aluminum tag 
labelled with the corresponding sample number was placed at the end of each channel cut.  
 
Rock samples were gathered and transported to camp in plastic rice bags or plastic pails and 
subsequently sealed and delivered by Platinex personnel to the ALS Chemex prep lab in Sudbury. 
 
2008 - 2011 Platinex Till Samples  
(See section 12.3.1 Basal Till Sampling) 

Till samples were sealed in plastic pails and shipped by Manitoulin Transport to Overburden Drilling 
Management in Nepean, Ontario. 
 
The author is unaware of any drilling, sampling or recovery factor that could materially impact the

16.0   SAMPLE ANALYSIS, QUALITY CONTROL, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 

Exploration Work Pre-1989 
No documents exist detailing the analytical methodology, quality control or quality assurance protocols 
for work done on the property prior to 1989. 
 
1989 Exploration Work done by Unocal (Churchill and Herrick Areas) 
Gold analyses were done by Swastika Laboratories of Kirkland Lake, Ontario using 1 assay ton fire 
assays. Examination of the assay certificates indicates that check assays were done approximately 
every 10 samples and a second pulp with an additional check assay was done approximately every 25 
samples.   
 
Approximately 125 pulp and metallic assays were done on drill core samples from mineralized zones at 
the Herrick and Churchill to test for possible nugget effect (Cluff, 1990).  The sample is crushed, 
pulverized and sieved to 100 mesh.  Two analyses of the -100 mesh and one analysis of the +100 mesh 
are done by fire assay methods. The two -100 mesh values were averaged and combined with the +100 
mesh value on a weight ratio basis to give a final calculated value. 
 
Cluff estimated a 9% increase in gold values using pulp and metallic analysis, over the standard one 
assay ton analysis, but also noted from the results that nugget effect was not a problem (Cluff, 
1989)(See following tables). 
 
 No blank, duplicate core, or assay standards are known to have been used.  The location of pulp and 
reject material is unknown.  The Report states that "this does not reduce the apparent validity of the 
results since there was excellent repeatability of check assays and the validation from samples collected 
by Bryant Groundwater Consulting was acceptable." 
 
1990 Exploration Work by Fort Knox (Herrick Area) 
Fort Knox submitted 45 channel and grab samples to Swastika Laboratories of Kirkland Lake, Ontario, 
for analysis by fire assay.  Eight samples had duplicate analyses.  Assay results for the five samples 
with the highest concentrations of gold are provided in Table D4 of Appendix D.  No other information is 
available. 
 
2008 Platinex Rock Samples 
Gold analyses of grab, chip and channel sampling done by Platinex Inc. in 2008 were done by ALS 
Chemex Laboratories in Vancouver, British Colombia.  Initial crushing and pulverizing were done in an 
ALS Chemex prep lab in Sudbury, Ontario.  
 
Sample preparation consisted of crushing of the entire sample to > 70% passing – 10 mesh (-2 mm).  A 
250 g riffle split was pulverized to >85% passing minus 75 um. One 50 gram aliquot of pulverized (pulp) 
material is fire assayed and finished with atomic absorption analysis to determine gold grade.  Analyses 
greater than 10g/t would have a second fire assay performed with a gravimetric finish. 
 
The screen fire assay method is used to detect the presence of coarse gold.  Several samples from the 
Speed Lake, Caswell areas were submitted to ALS Chemex for this procedure.  In this case 1000 grams 
of pulp material is sieved through a 100 micron dry screen to separate any coarse (+100 micron) 
material.  Any +100 micron material remaining on the screen is dried, weighed and analysed in its 
entirety.  The -75 micron fraction is homogenized and duplicate 50 gram sub-samples are analysed 
using fire assay.  Both +75 and -75 micron fractions are weighted and reported together as a calculated 
total gold content.

Platinex Inc. relied on ALS Chemex internal standards and quality control procedures for the 2008 initial 
exploration work.  Pulp and reject material for all samples sent to ALS Chemex have been shipped to 
Platinex and are currently stored in the company's Peterborough, Ontario core storage facility. 
 
2008 - 2011 Platinex Till Samples 
Overburden Drilling Management (ODM) of Nepean, Ontario processed the till samples taken from the 
Platinex property.  A heavy mineral fraction was obtained from the 5-15 kg original sample using a 
shaking table and heavy liquids. Micro-panning was also employed on selected samples. Kimberlite 
indicator minerals gold grains and other heavy minerals were identified by ODM staff in size fractions 
between 0.25 and 2 mm under binocular microscopes.  For gold grains, total counts, sizes, grain shape 
and calculated assay are tabulated for each sample.  Geochemical analysis of the heavy mineral 
fractions have been completed for 199 samples out of 446 at ALS Chemex. 

 
No duplicate samples have been submitted to ODM. 
 
The sample preparation, security and analytical procedures employed by Platinex Inc. generally meet 
the industry best practices.  The author is of the opinion that the work completed to date by Platinex is 
reliable. 

17.0   DATA VALIDATION - 2008 

17.1   Site Visit and Check Sampling 

J.G. Bryant, visited the property with D. Jamieson on August 6-8, 2008, inspected three areas for 
evidence of prior work, independently collected and observed the collection of some outcrop chip 
samples from prior channel sample locations and outcrop and examined and sampled archived core 
from the Unocal Herrick drill program.  Details of principal features, samples collected and analytical 
results are provided in the following sections according to showing or deposit name. 

17.1.1   Herrick Deposit 

• Most of the extensive cleared, stripped and washed areas of quartz, quartz-carbonate and quartz-
carbonate-sulphide zones were well exposed. 

• The shaft was observed to be partially blocked within several metres of surface. 

• Abandoned equipment including a winch, boiler and stack were present in the overgrown brush 
southeast of the shaft. 

• There was excellent correlation of the detailed, map-identified geology with observed features. 

• Unocal channel sample locations and sample intervals were readily confirmed. 

• Composite chip samples were collected from identified anomalous segments of Unocal channel 
sample.  The samples were labelled and hand-delivered to the ALS Chemex lab in Sudbury for 
processing.  Representative samples were analyzed by the ALS Chemex lab in Vancouver by 
the technique described in the previous section.   

• Drill hole casings for collars of Unocal holes HU89-6, HU89-9, HU89-11, and HU89-12 were 
located in the field and tied in using hand held GPS units.

18.0   COMPETITOR ACTIVITY   

Current and recent exploration and/or development activity in the Shining Tree area has been carried on 
by at least seven companies.  The companies include Golden Harp Resources Inc. (Golden Harp), the 
Goldeye Exploration and Temex Resources Corp. (Goldeye/Temex) joint venture, URSA Major Minerals 
Incorporated, Creso Resources, Mineral Mountain Inc., Sarissa Resources (now Shining Tree Gold), 
Nirek Resources and RA Resources (now Golden Phoenix Resources). 
 
Golden Harp has accumulated a large land holding east, north and northwest of the Platinex property.  
Their property, referred to as the Copper Hill Project, includes all but the southwest corner of 
Macmurchy Township and adjoining parts of Churchill, Natal, Knight and Tyrrell Townships.  Although 
no gold deposits have been defined in exploration from 1990 to present, the technical report prepared 
by SRK Consulting in 2007 stated that the "project is of sufficient merit to recommend a two-stage 
exploration program that is designed to identify new targets while continuing exploration work on known 
gold occurrences" and that "the cost for the recommended work program are estimated at CDN $1.8 
million".  Golden Harp optioned their property to Benton Resources in 2008 which the company vended 
the option after a limited drill program to Mineral Mountain Resources who have carried out extensive 
reverse circulation and diamond drilling programs since on the Cook deposit. 
 
Goldeye/Temex have been active on their Juby North JV gold property located one township east of 
Macmurchy Township.  A Phase 3 drilling program was recommended to start on the Juby Main Zone in 
late summer 2008.  A June 24, 2008 press release indicated their recent program extended the gold-
bearing zones and demonstrated the potential for not only significant strike lengths with the potential for 
additional gold discoveries.  Long intervals of lower grade gold mineralization have been intersected and 
contain narrower intervals grading up to 5.43 g/t gold over 3.65 metres.  Another intersection included 
15.0 g/t gold over 2.15 metres.  Temex in a recent press release revealed that the Juby deposit has 
been calculated to contain 1.84 million oz. 
 
URSA has delimited a nickel-copper deposit in Fawcett Township, southeast of the Platinex property.  
The Indicated Resource was reported as 1.02 million tonnes grading 0.71% Ni, 0.36% Cu and there was 
an Inferred Resource of 1.49 million tonnes grading 0.67% Ni and 0.36% Cu at a cut-off value of 0.30% 
nickel equivalent.  A preliminary technical and economic analysis and preliminary metallurgical test work 
has been completed.  Environmental baseline studies were underway in 2007.  The project was 
evaluated for a 1,000 tonne/day open pit operation with haulage and processing at URSA's proposed 
Shakespear Mill in the Sudbury area. 
 
Creso Resources Inc. Has assembled a large land package surrounding the Platinex Shining Tree 
property and including the Minto and Tyranite deposits.  Several drill holes have been completed on 
both deposits including one spectacular result drilling down the Minto breccias pipe which returned an 
intersection of 82.5m of 13.3 g/t Au (MC-09-01). 
Nirek Resources Inc. has an 18 claim property that coincides with the Gosselin quartz veins in Asquith 
and Churchill Townships immediately west of the Platinex Shining Tree property. The Gosselin vein has 
a 2.0 kilometre strike length and trends north 15 degrees west.  The association is gold-bearing quartz 
veins in altered pillow lava, rusty weathering Fe-Mg-calcium carbonate, and cross-cutting felsite, or 
rhyolite and granitic porphyry. Some evaluation of green carbonate zones with lower grade Au 
concentrations has also occurred.   It was also noted that a competitor had performed extensive 
washing, trenching and sampling on a long quartz and quartz-carbonate vein between the Speed Lake 
showing and Highway 560. 
 
RA Resources (now Golden Phoenix Resources) has performed work on claims adjacent to the Speed 
Lake showing in the southwest part of the main claim block.

19.0   MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The Shining Tree project is at an early exploration stage and there is no need for mineral processing or 
metallurgical testing. 

20.0   MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

Evaluation of the Herrick deposit is at an early stage with the result that there is insufficient information 
at this time to declare the Herrick deposit as a mineral resource.  However, the author has provided 
calculations based on available data which is either qualified and/or has been obtained by independent 
qualified persons.  Efforts will be made in the subsequent sampling programs to expand the grade and 
continuity of the gold-bearing zones as originally investigated.  Positive results would result in initiation 
of a mineral resource estimate. 
 
The Company SEDAR-filed its NI 43-101 technical report "the Report" dated October 2, 2008, by J.G. 
Bryant and D. Jamieson which examines the Herrick gold deposit on Shining Tree property and seven 
other known gold prospects, some of which have been explored underground. The Report qualifies the 
sampling and drilling work by Unocal (1989) and Fort Knox (1990) compliant to NI 43-101 standards. 
This report draws on the previous Report and provides an update based on results of subsequent 
exploration. 
 
The Report states that, "Judging from evidence of previous results on the Herrick deposit there 
is a potential to outline a small commercial gold deposit."  
 
An internal valuation of the Herrick deposit completed in May, 2012 by the author estimated 
potential gold content ranging from 111,000 oz to 172,000 oz Au within the defined vein 
structures to a depth of 300m.  The estimate is based on a minimum of 1,628,000 tonnes grading 
2.11g/tonne to a maximum of 2,554,000 tonnes grading 2.10g/tonne Au.  The estimate is derived 
from 3 narrow sub-parallel quartz vein breccias and an enclosing mineralized shear zone within 
a 370m strike length, to a 300m depth and within a 80m wide block.  A cut off grade of 0.5g/tonne 
was used in the calculations. 
 
The Central zone of the Herrick deposit outcrops for most of its length and is a continuously 
readily definable body.  The valuation also identified thicker gold zones between intersecting or 
bifurcating veins in some holes (e.g. hole HP10-44 to the southwest)  and in outcrops which are 
not included in the calculations.  These structures plunge near vertically providing a 
prospective target for deeper exploration. There is an undefined potential for a southwesterly 
plunging thickened enriched section that could contain from a depth of 300m to 1500m some 
14.6 million tonnes at a grade ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 g/tonne Au for a gold content of 1.0 to 2.4 
million ounces. The model is based on the mentioned structure, comparison to the West 
Timmins deposit and statistical grade estimates by the author.  The potential quantity and grade 
is conceptual in nature.  There has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource 
and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the delineation of a mineral resource.  The 
internal valuation was conducted by the author, who is a qualified person but an insider of the 
issuer and therefore according to the ethical standards set forth in the National Instrument 43-
101 no qualification of resources is permitted. More sampling of existing core and stripping of 
identified thicker mineralized zones where these project to surface, is warranted and could 
increase the identified potential within the exploration envelope and lead to a resource 
estimation by an independent, qualified person .

21.0   DISCUSSION  

21.1   Historic Context 

The Shining Tree gold camp underwent an initial surge of development from 1912 to 1925, and then 
again from 1933 to 1939.  Since that time there has not been extensive exploration work done in the 
area.  Unocal Canada Ltd. (Herrick) and Strike Minerals (Ronda) drill programs were the largest 
programs known by Bryant and Jamieson (2008) to be undertaken in recent times, and were each 
limited to a few months or less of diamond drilling. 
The recent drilling campaigns by Platinex on the Herrick deposit and the property wide till studies are 
the most comprehensive exploration programs to date. 
 
It is important to understand the history of a mineral-rich area, and attempt to understand the reasons 
for past development failures.    Exploration reports written about the Shining Tree area often refer to 
the early days of the camp as having been less than orderly.  For example, exploration campaigns 
consisted of "mini-rushes based on findings of spectacular gold occurrences…ending in investor losses" 
(Tindale 1989).  H.C. Laird stated in his examination of the area in 1934" its career (Shining Tree gold 
camp) has been a hectic one from the point of view of mining development. In the early days of the 
camp the discovery of much spectacular high-grade gold ore, particularly in the Wasapika section, led to 
a period of extravagant financing and fanciful development. The inevitable result of this over-expansion 
was chaos, litigation, and a general loss of public confidence, a blow from which this camp has not yet 
fully recovered. At present attempts are being made to correct this condition by what is believed to be a 
sincere mining effort on the part of certain interests, particularly those holding properties in the 
Wasapika section). 
 
Although the prospectors did a good job of finding surface showings, some or most of the subsequent 
exploration work may not have been systematic or of high quality.  Interest in the area resumed with 
higher gold prices in the 1930's, however labour shortages due to the war caused the mining projects in 
the area to close. 
 
The opening of claims for staking due to lapsing leases and patents in the last 20 years, as well as the 
general lack of activity in the area, provided an opportunity for Robert Macgregor to assemble a large 
land position that includes many of the key historic gold prospects in the Shining Tree gold camp.  The 
property is large enough to enable more sophisticated regional exploration techniques such airborne 
geophysics, and till geochemistry/gold grain analysis to be employed.  As a result an improved 
understanding of the geology and the geological control for gold mineralization could lead to lateral and 
depth extensions to existing deposits and occurrences and to the generation of new gold targets. 

21.2   Spatial Context 

Some of the key gold-bearing veins on the Platinex Inc. Shining Tree property cluster near the Churchill 
and Macmurchy township boundary north and south of highway 560.  The Caswell vein system is part of 
a larger trend that includes four non-Platinex properties to the southeast that have undergone limited 
historic underground development, namely the Bilmac, Atlas, Bennett and Kingston properties.  In 
addition, the Herrick vein system aligns along this same northwest trend, despite being separated by the 
Michiwakenda Lake Fault, which displaces stratigraphy for several kilometres along strike and an 
unknown vertical distance. Just to the west of the Caswell trend, the Ribble vein and Foisey vein on the 
Ronda property are north-south veins sub-parallel to the Michiwakenda Lake Fault and proximal to it 
(within 100 metres in the case of the Foisey vein).  Similarly, the north-south Herrick vein structure, one 
kilometre to the north, shows the same relationship to the Michiwackenda Lake Fault, albeit on the 
opposite side of the fault.

21.3   Caswell area 

The area has been subjected to a large number of relatively short exploration programs (except for the 
main underground development by Canadian Champion Mines) by a large number of companies, and 
compilation/interpretation suffers from undocumented or misplaced data.  The successes of some early 
drill programs do not appear to have been duplicated by subsequent programs, although that may be 
due to the limited available documentation.  Nevertheless, high grade gold values have been repeated 
by several workers in a few locations.  
 
Review of compilation maps and the mapping and sampling of the area power-stripped by Platinex in 
2008 confirm that the Caswell area has undergone complex strain and a prolific development of quartz 
veins hosted by narrow shear zones. Gold grades between 4 and 12 g/t were obtained across sub-
metre intervals in channel samples across the No. 1 and related shear/vein structures exposed by the 
power-stripping.  Most channel samples returned anomalous gold values. 
 
Although mapping and sampling of the Caswell vein system on surface and underground has taken 
place in the past, there is no reliable documentation of these results.   
 
Despite the negative aspects of Caswell data e.g. the historic very high grade mineralization which does 
not appear to be laterally continuous or in some cases repeatable, the Platinex work did demonstrate 
some positive characteristics and potential for the Caswell mineralization. 
 
There is a proliferation of shear hosted ENE veining which intersect the historic apparently formational 
Evelyn and Saville veins.  The ENE veins demonstrate a correlation of silver – tellurium and low grade 
gold mineralization throughout.  Cutting (2012 personal communication) noted that the strong quartz 
flooding alteration in which he would expect to see potentially commercial gold grades in the Platinex 
stripped areas was limited to strike lengths of a few metres and widths of no more than three metres. 
 
If this can be put in the context of the containing shear structure and/or it is related to an alkali-syenite 
system such as is postulated for the Minto pipe then an exploration approach can be established with a 
potential for success based in structurally controlled vertically oriented mineralization.  There is a need 
for careful mapping of the shear hosted veins. 

21.4   Herrick Deposit 

The Herrick vein received relatively systematic early exploration from the time of discovery in 1918 until 
1923 when the underground development program ceased.  The project was dormant until 1989, except 
for undocumented further surface sampling in 1940.  It should be noted that much of the current 
documentation of the early underground development work is derived from reports and examinations of 
the property data during the 1930's.  The 1989 Unocal exploration program, the Herrick and Churchill 
areas, was a well documented and systematic exploration program that provided an excellent 
framework to compile early exploration results and develop future exploration programs.   

 
The Herrick vein structure appears to be an extensive gold-mineralized system.  Although the results of 
Unocal's work did not meet their threshold for continued expenditures, further work is needed to 
determine the extent of the local higher grade gold mineralization indicated, as well as the extent of 
wider zones of lower grade gold mineralization intersected by Unocal.  The author believes that the 
Herrick gold deposit is a high priority exploration target that may be up-graded to a gold resource with 
additional stripping, channel sampling and additional sampling of available core. 
 
Work by Platinex on the Herrick deposit has demonstrated a potential for a thick possibly good grade 
deposit plunging to the southwest at depth which could contain up to 2.4 million ounces.  More modest 
mineralization is evident on surface, but the deposit might be larger than perceived due to ballooning 



Summary Report for Platinex Inc., Shining Tree, Ontario 
By:  James R. Trusler 

51 
 

mineralization between vein splays.  This needs to be tested by more sampling of existing core and 
stripping on surface.   
 
There is also evidence that another east zone occurs within hole HP09-33 which was not assayed 
towards the end of the hole.  There is ample potential for such zones between the Herrick Central zone 
and the Michiwakenda Lake Fault. 

21.5   Churchill area 

In the Churchill area, gold mineralization outlined by Unocal's 1989 exploration programs did not confirm 
earlier (1930's) work by the Churchill Mining and Milling Company.  There is little documentation of the 
underground workings or assay results from the Churchill Mining and Milling Company's work.  Some of 
the only information comes from visits by Ontario Department of Mines geologist H.C. Laird in 1934 and 
1935.  Laird had noted visible gold only in vein No. 1 and the west end of vein No. 3, and reported that 
company channel sampling at the time averaged 27.4 g/t over 1.25 metres on the No. 3 vein and 29.4 
g/t over 1.25 metres on the No. 1 vein. 
 
 A partial explanation for the lack of confirmation of this early work by Unocal's exploration program lies 
in the fact that Unocal surface work did not examine the areas noted by Laird that is the No. 1 vein or 
the portion of the No. 3 vein west of the shaft.   The four diamond drill holes that Unocal drilled in 1989 
did not test beneath the No. 3 vein directly west of the shaft.   Two holes were designed to test directly 
beneath No. 1 vein, however, one hole, CU-89-16, had to be abandoned after encountering 
underground workings.  Hole CU-89-17 encountered altered trachytic porphyry with anomalous gold 
values that could correlate with the No. 1 vein.  Hole CU-89-19 tested for the strike extension of the No. 
1 vein beneath a large swamp, 100 metres to the east of the showings and also intersected the altered 
trachytic porphyry with anomalous gold values.  The trachytic rocks encountered on the Churchill 
property are noted to be identical to those observed two kilometres to the north on the Herrick property. 

 
An important indicator of base metal potential in the Churchill area is the presence of massive pyrite 
mineralization within cherty exhalite rocks.  These rocks are along strike from regionally mapped 
sulphide iron formation, but magnetic surveys by Unocal show low magnetic response along this trend, 
indicating the absence of magnetite or pyrrhotite.  The presence of sphalerite with the strong pyrite 
mineralization is suspected but not confirmed by Cluff, and no base metal analyses are provided. 
 
The Churchill area requires additional examination due to its proximity to the Herrick gold deposit (see 
Figure 6) and to the lack of systematic exploration of the No. 1 and No. 3 veins. 

21.6   Ribble vein (Ronda) 

The depth extension of the northern portion of the Ribble vein may trend onto the Platinex Shining Tree 
claims at approximately 300 meters vertical depth.  Testing of the vein below the depth of past 
production was done by Strike Minerals in 1996 and intersected sporadic high-grade gold values.  This 
same mineralized level is projected to strike northward onto Platinex claims.  The closest holes from the 
Strike Minerals 1996 drilling program are located about 60 metres south of the Platinex property.  The 
Ribble vein depth extension is a high priority target for evaluation by deep drilling (400 to 500 metre long 
drill holes) on the Platinex ground. 

22.0   CONCLUSIONS 

The presence of three past-producing gold deposits and numerous gold prospects with underground 
workings in the Shining Tree gold camp underlines the significant potential for developing commercial 
gold production in this area.

In the context of regional geology and economic potential the Shining Tree property is part of the Abitibi 
gold belt and appears to be on a major gold associated feature the Cadillac Larder Lake Break.  It is 
midway between major gold deposits (Cote Lake – IAMGOLD and Young Davidson – AURICO) 
associated with felsic intrusives on the same break.  It is also on the same north-south structure as the 
West Timmins Mine of Lake Shore Gold.  As with these three deposits the Shining Tree property has 
now demonstrated an association with an alkali (syenite) intrusive body.  The intersections of major 
north-south faults (e.g. the Montreal River Fault) with gold associated features such as the Cadillac 
Larder Lake Break is a known harbinger of major gold and VMS deposits. 
 
The Herrick deposit has a demonstrated potential to contain a significant gold resource.  A program to 
strip and sample the veins at surface and thoroughly sample existing core is recommended. 
 
Till studies on the Shining Tree property have demonstrated the existence of a regionally significant gold 
dispersion train which is believed sourced by several deposits possibly more significant than any known 
gold deposit on the property.  Comparison of gold in till in Shining Tree to Timmins or Matachewan 
shows that Shining Tree has a high potential to host multiple commercial gold deposits (Figure 16 and 
17). 
 
Drilling of IP anomalies associated with a few of the high gold in till targets in 2012 intersected strong 
mineralization in four holes and an altered syenite in the fifth hole containing anomalous gold.  Due to 
budget limitations most of the core could not be logged, sampled and assayed. 
 
Much more of the property remains to be tested. 
 
A two-phase exploration program is proposed to step up the evaluation of existing and anticipated gold-
bearing targets during the balance of 2012 and in 2013.  The proposed work program should include 
more core sampling, stripping and channel sampling, then deeper diamond drilling of the gold zones at 
the Herrick deposit and testing for the depth continuity of the Ronda gold-bearing zone beneath the 
Platinex property.   Additional detailed surface prospecting, surface stripping and channel sampling, line 
cutting, pole-dipole IP, soil gas surveys and diamond drilling are also recommended.  The proposed 
budget for Phase I is $1,554,500, and the budget for Phase II is $3,272,550 and the proposed work 
program for phase I is tabulated (Tables 4, 5 and 6). 
 
Proposed drilling in Phase 1 totals 5,000 m and in Phase II 15,000m. 
 
On the Platinex Shining Tree property, the Herrick deposit represents a high priority exploration target 
that could be upgraded to a gold resource with additional work. 
 
High gold grain counts in till sampling indicates potential for new gold targets.  While historic work 
indicates potential to discover deeper gold mineralization at the Ribble, Churchill and Caswell areas. 

23.0   RECOMMENDATIONS 

It is recommended that a phase I program totalling $1,570,082 be carried out (Tables 4 and 6).  Initial 
work is to involve completions of logging and sampling of the 2012 drill core then stripping and sampling 
selected areas over the Herrick deposit and much more sampling of the Herrick core. 
 
Several areas where IP anomalies were found in combination with gold in till high counts may be 
stripped and sampled for initial evaluation.  This is recommended. 
 
Line cutting of 12 km is recommended to fill in the lines cut and surveyed in early 2012.  IP, soil gas 
hydrocarbon sampling and magnetometer surveys are recommended with prospecting and geological 
mapping.

More follow up stripping and channel sampling and drilling is also recommended with an emphasis on 
using a portion of the drilling to follow up on Herrick exploration with one hole testing further east than 
hole HP09-33 and two holes testing Herrick beneath previous drilling.
