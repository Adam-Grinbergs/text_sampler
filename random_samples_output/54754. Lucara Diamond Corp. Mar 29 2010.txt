NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  1 

1 SUMMARY 

The Boteti kimberlite project is focused on the AK6 kimberlite, situated in the Orapa 
kimberlite cluster in Botswana, an area with three currently operating diamond mines. 
The kimberlite was discovered by the De Beers Group ("De Beers") in 1969, but the 
project was not pursued until 2000, when further drilling and geophysical surveys 
indicated that the pipe was larger than previously interpreted, due at least in part to a 
partial capping of basalt breccia.  

De Beers released the project into a joint venture, along with a number of other 
kimberlite occurrences in April 2004. Detailed exploration between 2004 and 2006 
resulted in the application for a mining permit in 28th September 2007 by Boteti 
Exploration (Pty) Ltd, which was at that time a joint venture between De Beers (70.3%), 
African Diamonds plc (28.3%) and Wati Ventures (1.4%). ML2008/6L AK6 was granted 
on 28th October 2008, valid for 15 years, with a requirement for production to 
commence by April 2011. 

Following the completion of a feasibility study in October 2008, De Beers sold its 
interest in the project to Lucara Diamond Corporation ("Lucara"). Lucara have 
commissioned their own feasibility study on the project, and in terms of the Canadian 
Securities Administrator's rules, are required to issue a National Instrument 43-101 
technical report on the project within four months of acquisition (this report). 

The Boteti project comprises a single, tri-lobate kimberlite pipe. The kimberlite is 
"pinched" at surface, and its sub-outcrop consists of a core of kimberlite, covering an 
area of 4.2 ha, surrounded by an area where the kimberlite is capped by basalt or 
basalt breccia.  Drilling has shown that the kimberlite bulges to a maximum area of 
7 ha at a depth of 120 m. 

An indicated mineral resource to a depth of 400m, and an inferred resource from 400 m 
to a depth of 750 m were developed by De Beers (as operators of the Boteti joint 
venture) between 2004 and 2007 through successive drilling programmes, and a 
trench bulk sampling programme, which produced a total of 1,754 carats of diamonds. 
The diamonds have been valued at different times by three different entities. The most 
recent valuation was completed in February 2010 and this valuation has been modeled 
to produce an average production revenue of USD 194 per carat (+1.0 mm cut-off).  

The mineral resource has been subjected to both internal and independent verification 
processes, leading to a significant revision of the geological model, and a relatively 
minor revision of the mineral resource. After these revisions were completed, Anglo 
American plc (a 45% shareholder in De Beers) described the mineral resource as 
comprehensive and realistic. The major risk identified by their review was in the

diamond revenue models. Subsequent work on the revenue model suggests that it is 
robust.

The Boteti project was subjected to a new conceptual study by Paradigm Project 
Management ("PPM") in June 2009, which established a strong business case to 
develop a profitable mine. The business case is based on a contract mining scenario, 
with two phases of plant development and utilizes autogenous milling rather than more 
expensive tertiary high pressure grinder roll crushing. A probable mineral reserve was 
determined through Whittle analysis as follows:

Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  3 

The MSA Group ("MSA") has updated the financial model of the PPM conceptual study 
by adding the most recent diamond revenue figures, and by converting the financial 
model to an inflate/deflate model, such that all money inputs are escalated using an 
inflation scenario (to allow for the correct taxation and royalty calculations) and the 
resultant operating cash flow is then deflated to bring the money back to constant 
money terms for the determination of Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of 
Return (IRR). 

With respect to the underlying economic assumptions made in the PPM study, the 
updated financial model verified the results of the PPM valuation and in fact enhanced 
them. The profitability figures (based on a 75:25 debt equity ratio; latest 6 month 
average of exchange rates and including inflation) are as follows: 

Net Present Value10%                                       USD 147.1 million 

Net Present Value15%                                       USD 109.9 million 

Internal rate of return                                      70.0% 

Life-of-Mine cash cost (real terms)                USD16.62/t kimberlite treated 

Payback period                                                 4.3 years 

An important assumption in the PPM conceptual study financial model was the forward 
growth of diamond prices. In both the PPM model, and the updated version produced 
by MSA, the assumed real growth rate of diamond prices was 1.5% per annum. A 
review of published forecasts for diamond price growth over the next few years was 
conducted, and the figure of 1.5% appears conservative. Published independent 
forecast figures range from 2.5% to 7% real growth per annum over the next 3-10 
years. Based on this review, it appears there is significant upside potential for the 
diamond revenue figures at Boteti. 

The key conclusions of this technical report are that the mineral resource identified 
within the Boteti Project is robust and valid, and has been established by following best 
practice principles. The indicated mineral resource has been subject to a conceptual 
study, which has demonstrated a strong business case for pursuing the project. 
Technical and other risks on the project are considered relatively small because of the 
large amount of information generated on all aspects of the mining plan, both as part of 
the mineral resource development, and also as part of other pre-feasibility and 
feasibility studies completed by De Beers.  

Based on the validated mineral resource, the results of the PPM conceptual study, and 
the updated financial model generated, it is the MSA Group's opinion that the Boteti 
Project has the potential to become a significant diamond producer. No fatal flaws have 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  4 

been identified. In light of the extensive studies provided by previous pre-feasibility and 
feasibility programmes, The MSA Group finds no reason why the project should not 
advance directly to feasibility study level.

2 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 Scope of Work 

The MSA Group ("MSA") has been commissioned by Lucara Diamond Corporation 
("Lucara") to provide an Independent Technical Report on the Company's Boteti 
Kimberlite Project ("Boteti Project") located in Botswana in which Lucara holds a 
70.268 % interest.   This Independent Technical Report has been prepared to comply 
with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in the Toronto Venture Exchange 
(TSX-V) Corporate Finance Manual, Canadian National Instrument 43-101, Companion 
Policy 43-101CP, Form 43-101F1, the 'Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects' of 
January 2006 (the Instrument) and the Mineral Resource and Reserve classifications 
adopted by CIM Council in August 2000.  This report may be included in future equity 
financing plans by the Company on the Toronto – Venture Exchange (TSX-V) to fund 
ongoing evaluation and development work for the Boteti Project. 

All monetary figures expressed in this report are in United States of America dollars 
(USD) unless otherwise stated. 

2.2 Principal Sources of Information 

MSA has based its review of the Boteti Project on information provided by Lucara and 
its associates, along with technical reports by Government of Botswana agencies and 
other relevant published data. A large proportion of this information is recorded in 
reports prepared by the previous operator of the project, the De Beers Group ("De 
Beers"). A listing of the principal sources of information is included at the end of this 
Independent Technical Report.  A site visit was made during the period 17th to 18th 
January 2010 to the Boteti Project in Botswana by Mr. Ian McGeorge MSc CGeol FGS, 
a qualified person in terms of NI43-101, and Mr. Mike Lynn MSc, a geologist with 24 
years experience in diamond exploration, accompanied by Mr. Larry Ott, an officer of 
Lucara, and a qualified person under NI43-101. A visit was made to the marked drill 
locations and bulk sampling trenches in the AK6 kimberlite and to the De Beers 
exploration camp at Letlhakane where AK6 kimberlite drill core and samples are 
stored.  Previous drafts of the report were provided to Lucara, along with a written 
request to identify any material errors or omissions prior to lodgement. 

Lucara's Boteti mineral property is considered to represent an "Advanced Exploration 
Project" which carries inherent risk.  However, MSA considers that the property has 
been acquired on the basis of sound technical and financial merit.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

The property is Mining Licence No. 2008/6L issued in terms of the Mines and Minerals 
Act 1999, Part VI, and covering 9.056 km2 in the Central District, Botswana.  The 
licence is in north-central Botswana, 25 km south of the Orapa diamond mine and 
23 km west of the Letlhakane diamond mine, centred on approximately 25° 28' 13" E / 
21° 30' 35" S.   

All mineral rights in Botswana are held by the State.  Commercial mining takes place 
under Mining Licences issued on the authority of the Minister of Minerals, Energy and 
Water Affairs. 

Licence 2008/6L is held by Boteti Exploration (Pty) Ltd ("Boteti"), a company 
incorporated in Botswana in 2004.  It was issued on 28 October 2008. It is valid for 15 
years and gives the right to mine for diamonds.

Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  11 

The corner points of the licence are currently only marked by brightly painted metal posts 
at the positions recorded in Table 4-1.  Boteti has not demarcated the licence as required 
by Section 45(1) (c) and Section 80(1) (d) of the Mines and Minerals Act and The Mines 
and Minerals (Demarcation of Mining Lease Areas) Regulations (of 15 January 1971).  
These regulations require that concrete beacons mark corners and that boundaries are 
demarcated by cut-lines with line markers. However, it is reported that the Director of 
Surveys and Mapping (Government of Botswana) is aware of this and has indicated that 
the demarcation requirement will only be enforced once mining commences. 

4.2 Surface Rights 

The surface area of the Mining Licence is communal agricultural land administered by the 
Letlhakane Sub-Land Board, which falls under the Ngwato Land Board, Serowe.  It is 
currently used for grazing livestock and limited arable farming.  Boteti have obtained 
common law land rights for the Mining Licence area and the access road.  These rights 
will remain in force for the life of mine. 

4.3 Mineral Resource 

The mineral resource is a kimberlite pipe, AK6, which has a surface area of 4.2 ha, and 
lies in the north of the licence area.  There is a wide 18 m deep bulk sampling trench in 
the southern part of the kimberlite, but the natural surface of the area is flat lying with a 
covering of wind blown sand.  A berm of waste rock flanks the trench excavations. 

4.4 Issuer's Interest 

As of the effective date of this report, the shareholders of Boteti Exploration (Pty) Ltd are 
(Table 4-2): 

Table 4-2 
Shareholdings in Boteti Exploration (Pty) Ltd  

Shareholder % interest 

Lucara Diamond Corporation 70.268% 

African Diamonds plc 28.381% 

Wati Ventures (Pty) Ltd 1.351% 

 100% 
 

 

Lucara purchased its share from De Beers Prospecting Botswana (Pty) Ltd in November 
2009 for USD49 m.  The Government approval which, under the Mines and Minerals Act 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  12 

Section 50, was a condition precedent for this transaction was given on 18 December 
2009. 

African Diamonds plc ("African Diamonds") has an option to increase its share by a further 
10.268% for approximately USD 7 m.  It may exercise this option within 120 days from the 
date of completion of the Lucara transaction.  If African Diamonds were to exercise this 
option it would give them a 38.649% stake in Boteti.  There is also an option for African 
Diamonds and Lucara to acquire Wati Venture's share for USD 700,000. 

Under the terms of Mining Licence 2008/6L, the Government of Botswana will take no 
equity in Boteti. 

Under a shareholders agreement, Lucara is the operator of Boteti. 

4.5 Royalties 

Per ML2008/6L, Boteti will pay a royalty to the Botswana Government in accordance with 
Section 66 of the Botswana Mines and Minerals Act, which amounts to 10% of actual 
sales price of its production. For Kimberley Process purposes, the value of the production 
will be agreed on between the Botswana Government Diamond Valuator and Boteti. This 
value may also be used to set a reserve price on production. 

4.6 Sale of Production 

Under ML2008/6L, as issued, Boteti undertook to sell its entire production to the Diamond 
Trading Company Botswana (Pty) Ltd at a price equal to 90% of the Standard Selling 
Value.  This is a legacy from De Beers, and is being re-negotiated. Both Lucara and 
African Diamonds have agreed in principle to jointly market their respective share of 
diamond production through Boteti.  In the event that a joint marketing agreement cannot 
be reached, the shareholders agreement between Lucara and African Diamonds provides 
that each party may independently market its share of production excluding any special 
stones, which would be marketed through open tender by Boteti. 

4.7 Start of Production 

It is a condition of Mining Licence 2008/6L that Boteti start mining within 30 months of its 
issue, in effect by end April 2011. However, Boteti is currently in discussion with the 
Government of Botswana to extend the start date to allow completion of the new feasibility 
study.

NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  13 

4.8 Environmental Liabilities 

MSA is not aware of any existing environmental liabilities on the property.  The 
Department of Environmental Affairs has approved both an environmental impact 
assessment (EIA) and environmental management plan (EMP) submitted by Boteti. 

A Relocation Action Plan and Compensation Plan are currently being developed 
according to the Tribal Land Act and will be implemented in consultation with the Ngwato 
Land Board and affected parties. 

4.9 Permits 

From information provided by Boteti, MSA accepts that all necessary permits to carry out 
the proposed mining operations have either been obtained, or are expected to be 
obtained without undue difficulty.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The area lies on the northern fringe of the Kalahari Desert of central Botswana. It is 
described as being flat lying sand savannah which supports a natural vegetation of trees, 
shrubs and grasses.  The trees and shrubs are dominantly mopane (Colophospermum 
mopane) and tend to form thickets with intervening grassy patches.  The natural 
vegetation has been modified by many years of cattle grazing and limited arable farming.   

The property is at an elevation of 1,022 m above sea level. The ground slopes 
imperceptibly to the north into the Makgadigadi Depression.  The dry valley of the now 
fossil Letlhakane River, directed into the Depression, passes some 18 km to the northeast 
of the property and is the only notable physiographic feature in the immediate area. 

The property area is communal agricultural land used mainly for cattle grazing with limited 
arable farming.  Surface rights have been secured over the Mining Licence to provide 
sufficient space for rock dumps, tailings dams and mine infrastructure.  The area adjacent 
to the property is open and undeveloped and it is anticipated that additional space can be 
negotiated if required. 

5.1 Access 

The property is accessed by 15 km of all weather gravel and sand road from the tarred 
Letlhakane to Orapa road.  Letlhakane village is the closest settlement and offers basic 
facilities, including fuel.  At the 2001 census Letlhakane had a population of 15,000 rising 
by 5.7% annually (Central Statistics Office, Gaborone), thus at present, probably has a 
population of 20,000 to 25,000.  There are good telecommunications including cellular 
telephone networks in the area.  Letlhakane is reached from the major cities of Gaborone 
and Francistown by good quality tarred roads.  There is an airstrip within the nearby 
Debswana controlled Orapa township, but the closest airport with commercial flights is 
Francistown, some 200 km to the east and 2.5 hours away by road.  Both Orapa and 
Francistown airstrips have immigration and customs facilities and can thus service 
international flights. 

5.2 Climate 

The climate is hot and semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall of 462 mm at 
Francistown, which falls almost entirely in the summer months from October to April (Dept 
of Meteorological Services, Gaborone).  Summer maximum temperatures are high, 
generally >30°C, whilst winter days are mild and th e nights cold (often <10°C) with 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  15 

occasional ground frost.  High diurnal ranges are experienced in all seasons.  The climate 
does not impede mining operations, which can continue year round. 

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Electrical power will be provided at least in part by the Botswana Power Corporation's 
national grid.  Diesel powered generating capacity will be installed at the mine to make up 
for any shortfall.  Southern Africa is expected to experience power shortages over the 
period 2010 to 2014, thus this extra capacity may be essential. 

Water will be provided by pit de-watering supplemented by a well field, which will be 
developed as required.  The area is underlain by a strong aquifer at the contact of the 
Ntane Sandstone Formation and the overlying Karoo basalt. 

The area has a history of diamond mining dating back to 1971 when operations started at 
the nearby Orapa Mine, one of the largest diamond mines in the world. In 2008, the Orapa 
Mine produced nearly 17 million carats.  The smaller Letlhakane diamond mine 
commenced production in 1978 and produced a further 1.2 million carats in 2008.  There 
is therefore a reserve of qualified and experienced manpower in the immediate area.  The 
major Ni/Cu mining operations at Tati Nickel, near Francistown, and at BCL, Selebi-
Phikwe, have also added to the supply of labour with mining related skills.

6 HISTORY 

There has been no production from the Boteti property. The AK6 kimberlite was 
discovered by De Beers in 1969, but was initially considered to be small and low grade 
based on early work.  Reassessment starting in 2003 revealed that the kimberlite was 
larger and had a higher grade than previously estimated.  All historical work was carried 
out by De Beers. 

6.1 Early Work; De Beers Prospecting Botswana (Pty) Ltd and De Beers 
Botswana Mining Company (Pty) Ltd. 

The discovery of The AK6 kimberlite was part of the same exploration programme that 
discovered the Orapa kimberlite (named AK1) and the Letlhakane kimberlites (DK1 and 
DK2), in addition to some 25 other kimberlite intrusions.   

De Beers Botswana Mining Company (the predecessor of Debswana) held State Grant 
(SG) 14/72 from 16 September 1972 until 15 December 1975.  Under the grant, De Beers 
carried out evaluation and the delineation of kimberlites discovered previously. In addition 
they carried out reconnaissance and detailed soil sampling.   

Little data from the initial discovery and evaluation of the AK6 kimberlite is available, but it 
is known that the discovery was made from the interpretation of an aeromagnetic survey.  
The kimberlite was delineated with 44 percussion boreholes, 20 of which were recorded 
as intersecting kimberlite and 24 as intersecting basalt.  De Beers interpreted the AK6 
kimberlite to have an area of 3.3 ha and three 20 ft deep pits excavated in 1973 gave a 
grade of 0.07 ct/m3 (approximately 3.5 ct/100t).   

One vertical cored borehole was drilled into the kimberlite to a depth of 61.0 m.  
Weathered primary kimberlite was recorded from 8 m (De Beers 1976).   

Reconstruction from the later exploration programmes suggests that two of the pits were 
sunk into basalt breccia, as were many of the percussion boreholes.  There were two 
cored holes, as well as possibly two large diameter holes drilled with a jumper (cable tool) 
rig. 

6.2 Debswana Diamond Company (Pty) Ltd, PL17/86 

The Boteti Project lies within former PL 17/86 held by Debswana from 1 July 1986 until 24 
January 1998. The kimberlite lies within the area dropped at second relinquishment.  The 
AK6 kimberlite was not the focus of work on this licence, which concentrated on the 
discovery of additional kimberlite bodies in the immediate Orapa area, but it was drilled for 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  17 

geological information and to test its diamond content (Debswana 1999).  No details of 
how it was drilled or sampled are given, but it is stated as being 3.3 ha in area, comprising 
hard, dark green kimberlite breccia, and having a diamond grade of 0.42 ct/m3 
(approximately 15 ct/100t).   

None of the above grade data is compliant with NI43-101. 

6.3 De Beers Prospecting Botswana (Pty) Ltd, PL1/97 

PL1/97 was issued to De Beers on 1 February 1997, which covered the AK6 kimberlite. 
However, the pipe was within the area dropped at first relinquishment in 2000, and no 
work was recorded on it.   

6.4 De Beers Prospecting Botswana (Pty) Ltd, PL13/2000 

In April 2000, De Beers was granted PL13/2000 with an area of 9.95 km2 over the AK6 
kimberlite.  Three small diameter percussion boreholes showed the existence of the North 
and Central Lobes for the first time.  The licence was renewed on 31 March 2003 with the 
area reduced to 4.90 km2.  In September 2003 De Beers carried out high resolution 
ground magnetic surveys over kimberlites AK6, AK10 and BK11.  The results of this work 
suggested that the AK6 kimberlite had a surface area of 9.5 ha, although this proved to be 
largely made up of the surrounding basalt breccia. 

In December 2003, De Beers started a programme of five 12¼" boreholes intended to 
collect a 100 t bulk sample.  The drilling was completed in February 2004, but the 
encouraging results only became available in October 2004, after the licence had been 
included in the Boteti Joint Venture. 

6.5 The Boteti Joint Venture 

On 17 April 2004, a joint venture heads of agreement was entered into between Kukama 
Mining and Exploration (Pty) Ltd and De Beers Prospecting Botswana (Pty) Ltd for seven 
prospecting licences in the Orapa area totaling 1,344.27 km2 and including 29 previously 
discovered kimberlites.  De Beers PL13/2000 was included in this joint venture.  A 12 
month work programme was carried out per the heads of agreement, which resulted in the 
signing of a formal joint venture agreement on 20 October 2004 and the incorporation of 
Boteti Exploration (Pty) Ltd.  PL13/2000 was transferred into Boteti. 

6.6 Boteti Exploration (Pty) Ltd 

The exploration works carried out by De Beers on behalf of Boteti Exploration is described 
in Sections 10 to 13 below. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  18 

A Mining Licence application was submitted on 28 September 2007.  Previously, on 30 
July 2007, Boteti had applied to Botswana Government under Section 25 of the Mines 
and Minerals Act for a Retention Licence over the AK6 kimberlite.  On 9 September 2008, 
the Government informed Boteti that it would regard the period since the Retention 
Licence application as a negotiation period as allowed under Section 50 of the Act, and 
urged Boteti to apply for a Mining Licence.  This was done, and Mining Licence 2008/6L 
was issued effective from 28 October 2008.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The bedrock of the region is covered by at least a thin veneer of wind blown Kalahari sand 
and exposure is very poor.  Rocks close to surface are often extensively calcretised and 
silcretised due to prolonged exposure on a late Tertiary erosion surface (the African 
Surface) which approximates to the present day land surface.   

The tectonic setting of the property, and of the Orapa Kimberlite Field, is not immediately 
clear because of the scarcity of basement exposure.  Relevant information and 
discussions can be found in James et al. (2001), Eglington et al. (2008) and Begg et al. 
(2009).  However study and dating of basement inliers to the northeast, within Sua Pan, 
together with interpretations of regional aeromagnetic data, show that the setting is 
marginal to the Zimbabwe Craton and that at depth the property is underlain by tectonised 
rocks of the Palaeoproterozoic Magondi Mobile Belt (Figure 7-1)  This Belt can be traced 
around the western margin of the Zimbabwe Craton from Zimbabwe through Botswana 
into South Africa, and may link with the Central Zone of the Limpopo Mobile Belt (C.J. 
Hatton, pers. comm.) which hosts the Venetia diamond mine.  This interpretation is 
supported by the regional magnetic fabric.  If it is correct, it can be deduced that the major 
tectonic events recorded within the Magondi and Limpopo Mobile Belts at approximately 
2.0 and 2.7 Ga did not adversely affect the diamond potential of the sub-lithospheric 
Archaean keel, since these belts host at least four world class diamond mines.   

The country rock at the AK6 site is sub-outcropping flood basalt of the Stormberg Lava 
Group which is underlain by a condensed sequence of Karoo sedimentary rocks.  The 
Karoo rocks are terrestrial sediments of Upper Carboniferous to Triassic age and occur 
widely throughout southern Africa.  The succession at the property is within the Northern 
Belt of the Central Kalahari Sub-Basin as defined by Smith (1984), and is divided into the 
Ecca Group and the overlying Lebung Group, which are separated by a pronounced 
unconformity.  The basalts, which are very extensive and underlie much of central 
Botswana, are of Jurassic age (180 Ma) and lie unconformably on the sedimentary 
succession, but are traditionally regarded as part of the Karoo Supergroup. 

The regional stratigraphy is given in Table 7-1 below.  The glaciogenic Dwyka Group, 
termed the Dukwi Formation in Botswana, which regionally is the basal unit of the Karoo 
Supergroup, is mainly absent in this area, but may occur sporadically in palaeo-
topographic depressions.

concentration of WNW-ESE trending post-Stormberg dolerite dykes which can be 
followed from Zimbabwe through Botswana to Namibia (Figure 7-1).

7.2 Local Geology 

There are few outcrops in the Letlhakane area, as the bedrock is concealed by several 
meters of aeolian sand, reflecting the area's position on the edge of the Tertiary age 
Kalahari Basin.  The sand is part of the Late Cretaceous-to-Recent continental 
sedimentary sequence of the Kalahari Group, which thickens to the west and south.  The 
Letlhakane River has incised through this cover to expose Stormberg Basalt in parts of 
the river course.  To the south and west of the Orapa Kimberlite Field, the bedrock may 
be overlain by up to 40 m of Kalahari Group sediments. 

The Orapa Kimberlite Field lies on the northern edge of the Central Kalahari Karoo Basin 
along which the Karoo succession dips very gently to the SSW and off-laps against the 
Precambrian rocks which occur at shallow depth (although they are seldom actually 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  22 

exposed) within the Makgadikgadi Depression.  The Karoo succession is condensed, with 
a total thickness of around 600 m, and is best preserved in WNW-ESE oriented grabens.  
The large AK1 kimberlite lies within such a graben (Coates et al. 1979).  This direction of 
faulting is also the bearing of the post-Karoo dolerite dykes mentioned above.  Although 
the main concentration of these dykes lies further north, there are a number of long dykes 
in the AK6 area identified by aeromagnetic data. 

The Orapa Kimberlite Field includes at least 83 kimberlite bodies, varying in size from 
insignificant dykes to the 110 ha AK1 kimberlite which is Debswana's Orapa Mine.  All are 
of post-Karoo age.  Of the 83 known kimberlite intrusions, four (AK1, BK9, DK1 and DK2) 
have been or are currently being mined, and a further five (AK6, BK1, BK11, BK12 and 
BK15) are recognized as potentially economic deposits. 

7.3 Property Geology 

Drilling has shown the following country rock succession at the property. (Table 7-2). The 
volcanic and sedimentary units are almost flat lying.

The bedrock is covered by a top soil layer 1.0 - 1.5 m thick.  This is reddish brown in 
colour and is made up largely of aeolian sand.  There is a discontinuous thin gravel layer 
or 'stone line', <0.6 m thick, at the base of the soil with clasts from 20 - 50 mm in size.  
The gravel is partly calcretised.  Testing by De Beers has shown it to be barren of 
diamonds.  The soil and gravel are underlain by a friable calcrete to a depth of 3 - 4 m, 
below which is a massive silcrete horizon, often densely veined by calcite. Over the 
kimberlite, the silcrete grades downwards into highly weathered and partially silcretised 
kimberlite with extensive calcite veining. Indicator minerals and vaguely preserved

macrocrystic kimberlite texture can be seen in places. Kimberlite can be clearly identified 
below about 8 - 10 metres depth. 

7.4 Kimberlite Geology 

The geology of the AK6 kimberlite has been deduced from geophysics, drilling and 
trenching. Geophysical methods include high resolution ground magnetic, frequency-
domain electromagnetic (FDEM), ground gravity and Controlled Source Audio-frequency 
Magneto-Tellurics (CSAMT) surveys.  A total of 46 cored delineation boreholes, 23 
vertical cored boreholes (drilled as pilot holes for large diameter drilling) and 44 
percussion boreholes have been drilled into the kimberlite.  There are also extensive 
exposures of weathered kimberlite in two 18 m deep trenches.  The geological model 
(Figure 7-2) has been refined by successive drilling programmes. 

Below the highly weathered layer, generally at a depth of 8 to 12 m below surface, the 
kimberlite is soft and friable, reddish brown to grey in colour, and intensely veined.  The 
kimberlite tends to become softer with depth, although large lenses of calcrete and 
silcrete occur up to 15 m below surface. 

The kimberlite is "pinched" at surface, and its sub-outcrop consists of a core, covering 
4.2 ha, of kimberlite surrounded by an area where the kimberlite is capped by basalt or 
basalt breccia.  This greater area was mapped as 9.5 ha by geophysical surveys.  Drilling 
has shown that the true kimberlite bulges to a maximum area of 7 ha at a depth of 120 m 
below surface.  The peripheral basalt breccias are not included as kimberlite in the 
geological model, and are thus excluded from the resource. 

Percussion drilling under PL13/2000 showed the kimberlite to consist of three lobes, 
termed the North, Centre and South, which coalesce at surface.  Previous to this work 
only the South Lobe was known.  Geologically, the North and Central Lobes are very 
similar (and may be one intrusion), but the South Lobe is quite distinct, being harder, 
darker, denser and showing preferred orientation of lithic clasts.  The contact between the 
South and Central Lobes is however rather indistinct. The contact has been mapped 
down hole using geochemistry, utilizing the Zr/Ni ratio.  Such geochemical work led to a 
reappraisal of the position of the contact after the trenching operation. As a consequence, 
it was concluded that whilst it was intended that the northern trench should sample the 
Central Lobe, it was in fact mainly in the South Lobe, with only the northern extremity of 
the trench sampling the Central Lobe (section 17).

Figure 7-2 
Geological Model of AK6 Kimberlite to 400m 

 

 

Below about 120 m depth, the three lobes separate into distinct downward-tapering pipes.  
Displaced blocks of country rock intersected in borehole DDH020, which traversed the 
kimberlite from north to south, suggest however that the North and Central Lobes may be 
one intrusion, apparently separated only because of very large country rock xenoliths 
within the pipe.  Below the North and Central Lobes the kimberlite tapers quite sharply, 
but the South Lobe is more cylindrical at depth (Figure 6-3).  Clearly by far the greatest 
portion of the kimberlite resource is in the South Lobe, and from surface to 400 m (the 
base of the indicated resource as defined by De Beers), the South Lobe makes up 72% of 
the volume of the indicated resource. 

Initial petrographic work suggested that the kimberlite is magmatic, and it was classified 
as an opaque mineral-rich, monticellite kimberlite with segregationary texture.  However 
some samples have been identified as volcaniclastic, and possibly the texture is due to 
welding during cooling of volcanic ejecta.  At present therefore the AK6 kimberlite is 
regarded as almost certainly a volcaniclastic kimberlite, possibly pyroclastic, showing 
various degrees of welding.  The classification remains problematic, however, and may 
only be resolved by better exposure following the start of mining operations.

The Karoo basalt was a barrier to kimberlite emplacement and basalt xenoliths are 
abundant, though in general the South Lobe is less diluted. 

Limited zircon U/Pb dating has given ages of 88±5 Ma for the Central Lobe and 93±2 Ma 
for the South Lobe.  Although the data is inconclusive, it lends some support to the 
possibility that the North and Central Lobes are a separate and later intrusion.  However 
the average age corresponds well to the age of the Orapa AK1 pipe and other kimberlites 
in the Orapa Field. 

The most prominent lineaments around AK6 Kimberlite, seen in air photos, are a closely 
spaced set directed east-northeast but of uncertain origin.  A possible northwest oriented 
fault is detected to the immediate south of the pipe.

8 DEPOSIT TYPE 

The AK6 kimberlite intrusion is a kimberlite diatreme, or pipe, which was the feeder to a 
now eroded kimberlite volcano.  Kimberlite is by far the most important primary source of 
diamond.   

Diamonds are a high pressure (~50 Kbar) and temperature (~1,200°C) variety of carbon, 
which form at depths of at least 150 km below the earth's surface.  Kimberlite is a volcanic 
rock, which originates at great depth, between 150 km and 300 km, in the asthenosphere.  
Rapidly ascending kimberlite magma entrains diamonds, together with other rocks and 
minerals present at those depths. 

Kimberlite is named after the diamond-mining centre of Kimberley, South Africa, where 
the diamond bearing rock type was first discovered.  Prior to the Kimberley discoveries, all 
world diamond production had been from alluvial deposits and a primary source was 
unknown. 

Only a small minority of kimberlite bodies contain diamonds in sufficient concentrations to 
be considered as diamond ore.  The great majority of kimberlites have zero or very low 
diamond contents.  It has been found that those which do have elevated diamond tenors 
usually occur in areas of old and stable crust, which are typically found in the cratonic 
cores of continental blocks.  Kimberlites within younger orogenic belts usually contain few 
diamonds.  Cratonic areas are characterised by thick crust and low geothermal gradients. 
The occurrence of the Orapa kimberlite field within the Palaeoproterozoic Magondi Mobile 
Belt, suggests that the diamond potential of the sub-lithospheric Archaean keel, has not 
been adversely affected by this older orogenic episode.   

The transportation of entrained diamonds to the surface must be rapid in order to prevent 
their resorption or retrogression to graphite as pressure is released.  Kimberlite magma is 
very rich in volatiles, notably CO2, which makes this rapid ascent possible, and explosive 
breakthrough to the surface may start at depths of 2 to 3 km, giving rise to the 
characteristic carrot shaped pipe, or diatreme.  It is not uncommon for there to be several 
kimberlite intrusions in very close proximity to each other, so that the later intrude the 
earlier ones.  This is probably the case at Boteti, where there appears to be at least two 
separate intrusions, which coalesce near the present day land surface. Kimberlite pipes 
are often composite in the manner seen at Boteti, and made up of several different 
kimberlite lithologies or facies.  The tenor and quality of diamonds may vary between 
different facies and lithologies, therefore a good geological model and lithologically 
controlled sampling are important in evaluation. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  27 

Different facies may also vary in the proportion of country rock xenoliths they contain, 
which impacts on grade.  They may also vary in metallurgical properties, resulting in 
varying plant efficiencies. All of these variables have been taken into account in the 
sampling programmes undertaken on the Boteti Project.

9 MINERALISATION 

The property includes the AK6 kimberlite pipe which is demonstrably diamond bearing. 
Diamonds occur as xenocrysts which have been entrained by the kimberlite magma 
during its ascent to surface from depths ranging between approximately 150 and 180 km. 
Factors influencing the grade of mineralization include the quantity of diamonds originally 
entrained by rising magma, the rate of ascent to surface and possible resorption of some 
diamond into graphite, and dilution of the primary kimberlite magma by barren country 
rock material. The grade of the AK6 kimberlite has been estimated by successive 
sampling programmes to produce an indicated mineral resource to a depth of 400 m, and 
an inferred mineral resource to a depth of 750 m (section 17).

10 EXPLORATION 

This section summarizes advanced exploration work on the AK6 kimberlite done by Boteti 
Exploration (Pty) Ltd from December 2003 until the completion of the final geological 
report in May 2007.  All work was carried out by De Beers Prospecting Botswana (Pty) 
Ltd, the operator of the Boteti joint venture, under PL13/2000. 

As described in section 6 prior to the work carried out by the Boteti Joint Venture, the AK6 
kimberlite had been held continuously by De Beers or Debswana under a succession of 
prospecting licences since its discovery in 1969.  Limited and shallow sampling had 
shown that it was diamondiferous, but it was thought to be very low grade and relatively 
small (3.3 ha), thus for many years it was not a priority for thorough exploration.  As will 
be seen, it is the occurrence of basalt breccia around and over parts of the kimberlite, 
which was not fully appreciated, and the under-sampling of the deposit, that led to those 
erroneous conclusions.   

10.1 Exploration approach and methodology 

The exploration of AK6 kimberlite followed a staged approach, which can be summarized 
as follows: 

Initial exploration work – prior to the Boteti Joint Venture, in late 2003, De Beers carried 
out geophysical surveys and drilled 5 x 12¼" holes, which gave a 97 t (in-situ) bulk 
sample.  This resulted in a sampling grade of ~23 ct/100 t and good quality 
diamonds.  Due to a 10-month lapse between the completion of drilling and the 
release of the sampling results, De Beers committed PL13/2000 to the Boteti Joint 
Venture prior to these encouraging results being known. 

Advanced Exploration Phase 1 – Based on the initial work, the AK6 kimberlite was 
declared an "advanced exploration project".  The next step was to define a high 
confidence inferred mineral resource and recover 500 ct from 13 large diameter 
drill holes at 70 m spacing.  The external contacts and internal geology of the 
kimberlite were explored through an extensive programme of delineation drilling 
and high resolution geophysics. 

Advanced Exploration Phase 2 – the results of phase 1 merited phase 2, the objective of 
which was to define an indicated mineral resource and recover a large diamond 
parcel, ideally 3,000 ct, to reduce revenue uncertainty.  Large diameter drill holes 
were placed at 50 m centres and trenches prepared for recovery of the required 
parcel of diamonds.  Further delineation drilling was also done. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  30 

Advanced Phases 1 and 2 overlapped in time, due to a decision to fast track the project. 

Initial conceptual mining studies showed that exploration should extend to 400 m below 
surface in the South Lobe, and 250 m below surface in the North and Central Lobes.  
These were the limits of possible open pit mining based on an initial economic 
assessment. The studies concluded that AK6 kimberlite was not likely to be an 
underground mining proposition. 

Exploration by Boteti is summarized in Table 10-1 below. The drilling programmes are 
discussed in detail in section 11 below.

10.2 Geophysical Surveys 

The AK6 kimberlite was first detected from an aeromagnetic survey in 1969.  During 2005, 
the kimberlite was surveyed in great detail by five ground geophysical methods as 
outlined in Table 10-2 below. The geophysical data was used in the preparation of the first 
geological model and in volume calculations. 

The geophysical surveys were carried out by De Beers, and images are shown in  
Figure 10-1, Figure 11-5 and Figure 11-6. The geophysical surveys were highly effective 
in delineating the kimberlite.  However drilling results show that the geophysical 
interpretations lead to an overestimate of the surface area of the kimberlite, since the 
surveys interpreted associated basalt breccias as "kimberlite". This over-estimation has 
been subsequently resolved by detailed drilling.

intrusions. The modeled image shows the position of the 12.5-inch drillholes to confirm

where the kimberlite was intersected. The CSAMT clearly shows the facies distinctions 
between the southern and northern (Centre and North) lobes, and that the South Lobe is 
much larger at depth to approximately 400m.

10.3 Garnet Mineral Chemistry 

A suite of kimberlite indicator minerals was extracted from the Phase 1 delineation 
percussion drilling programme samples.  Grains were analysed in-house by De Beers by 
electron microprobe and the results interpreted using standard methods.  The garnet 
population carries a proportion of sub-calcic 'G10' grains, which are typical of 
diamondiferous kimberlites. 

The garnet data are of special interest.  During earlier work at Boteti, De Beers had 
probed a collection of 295 garnets, considered a statistically valid quantity at that time.  A 
standard CaO v Cr2O3 plot shows a discouraging distribution with no grains in the sub-

12 inch 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  33 

calcic G10 field.  During the Boteti programme however, a population of 1,742 garnets 
were analysed, and the presence of sub-calcic grains became evident (Figure 10-2).

(n=295), and on the right, data available after 2003 (n=1742) 

 

 

This study carries a strong message for the assessment of kimberlites using indicator 
mineral chemistry. Many kimberlites have been downgraded in terms of their diamond 
potential on the basis of a relatively small dataset.

11 DRILLING 

Beginning in late 2003, extensive drilling works were undertaken on the AK6 kimberlite.  
The drilling can be divided into that done to delineate the extent of the kimberlite and to 
map its internal geology, and density, and that done to obtain large kimberlite samples 
for diamond grade and revenue estimation. The drilling is summarized in Table 11-1 
below, grouped into the exploration phases described in section 10 above.  Borehole 
locations are illustrated in Figures 11-4 to 11-9 and each drilling phase is summarized in 
Tables 11-1 to 11-9.

Phase 1 pilot drilling was sub-contracted to R A Longstaff (Pty) Ltd of Selebi-Phikwe, but 
their services were discontinued after Phase 1. All prior and subsequent drilling was 
contracted to De Wet Drilling (Pty) Ltd of Rasesa, Botswana.   

11.1 Drilling Methods 

The core drilling during Phases 1 and 2 was conducted with three core drills: a Longyear 
LY44, a Boyles JKS300, and an Atlas Copco CS-13. All bits used were HUD 8C 
containing only synthetic industrial diamond (960 Grade, 40/50 mesh, General Electric). 
Figure 11-1 shows examples of these rigs. 

All pilot and delineation core holes were logged in the field in detail according to a 
standard operating procedure, describing each kimberlitic unit, measuring contacts 
between various units as well as kimberlite/country rock contacts and brief descriptions of 
country rock. The country rock dilution and mantle content were logged using the scan-
line method, logging 1m of kimberlite per 7m interval. Representative samples of each 
kimberlitic unit (approximately 10cm in size) and country rock units were collected from 
selected holes logged for mineral chemistry and petrographic analyses.  

Core recovery and depth data were recorded as outlined in the core drilling procedure. 
Time motion data was collected by the drillers and captured in the database. 

Core recovered from all the drilling was stored at the Letlhakane exploration camp at the 
time the field visit was conducted (Figure 11-2). The core is generally in very good 
condition and labelling remains clearly visible. The core has been labelled, photographed 
and the inventory stored in a Datamine Fusion database. Some sections of core are 
missing from the core boxes because they were sampled for microdiamonds, 
petrography, density, geochemistry and Ore Dressing Studies (ODS). Sampling records 
are also stored in the Fusion database.

The Large Diameter Drilling (LDD) method used was the reverse flood airlift assist 
system.  23" tricone bits with tungsten carbide or mild steel teeth were used, the steel 
being used for softer varieties of kimberlite.  Sample return to the surface is achieved by 
filling the borehole with water, and creating a lift on the inside of the drill rod by means of 
a narrow air pipe which goes down the centre of the rod (Figure 11-3).  The amount of air 
injected is very small, and only a modest compressor is required.  A current is created in 
the hole which lifts the sample up the centre of the drill rods, around the air pipe, and out 
onto a de-sliming screen.  Downward pressure on the bit is achieved through the weight 
of the drill string, assisted by heavy collars which are put into the string above the bit.  The 
system reduces abrasion during lift, and can deliver a relatively coarse sample with 
minimal fines.

NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  38

Schematic of the Large Diameter reverse flood airlift assist drilling method 

 

 

 

Because it requires a hydrostatic head (obtained by the water standing in the borehole 
around the rods) to operate, the method cannot function until the borehole is at least 12 m 
deep.  Up to this depth, the hole is drilled with conventional circulation using mud, and 
sample return is imperfect.  A section of 24" inside diameter casing is put into the hole to 
about 4 m. 

The equipment used for both phases 1 and 2 was the De Wet Drilling Elephant 2 rig 
shown in Figure 11-4 in drilling mode with a compressor on the right, and a cyclone and 
in-field screen on the left.

During the Phase 2 LDD work, two holes in the South Lobe were successfully drilled to 
700 and 702 m, respectively, a record for this type of drilling. 

The 50 m LDD grid was drilled with a view that no further sampling drilling would be 
required during the life of the mine.  Experience had shown De Beers that LDD drilling 
within the pit of an operating mine was very difficult, if not impossible, and the AK6 
kimberlite programme was designed to avoid this.

11.2 Initial 12 ¼ inch Reverse Circulation Drilling Programme 

Preliminary bulk sampling to extract 100 tons (measured from theoretical bit diameter) of 
kimberlite material down to a depth of 150 m, was undertaken on the AK6 kimberlite from 
December 2003 to February 2004. The objective was to determine the macrodiamond 
(+1.47mm diamonds) potential of the kimberlite. 

Figure 11-5

The bulk sample was extracted from five 121/4 inch LDD holes spread across the extent of 
the kimberlite, as determined from very high-resolution ground geophysics (Figure 11-5). 
Each hole was drilled to a depth of approximately 150m. The holes were not calipered for 
drilled diameter, and hence the tonnage calculations were based on density 
determinations and the calculated volumes of each hole, assuming a 121/4 inch diameter. 
Material from each hole was combined and consigned as one sample. De-sliming at the 



 

 
Boteti Project

on-site screens was at 1.47mm bottom cut-off. De Wet Drilling Botswana was contracted 
for this work using a Bomag RC rig. Tricone Tungsten Carbide (TC) drill bits were used. 

Samples were consigned to the De Beers Evaluation Services Department (ESD) in 
Kimberley, South Africa to be processed through a dense media separation (DMS) plant 
to recover concentrate, which was sent to the Group Exploration Macro-diamond 
Laboratory (GEMDL) in Johannesburg for diamond recovery. 

The results of this work are summarised in Table 11-2.

11.3 Phase 1 Percussion Drilling Programme 

During 2005 and 2006, a 6½" percussion drilling programme was undertaken to delineate 
the perimeter of the kimberlite and to validate the geophysical model.  A total of 44 holes, 
totaling 4,575 m, were drilled. 

The location of the percussion delineation holes are shown in Figure 11-6. The red dots 
are drillholes where kimberlite was identified. Two holes marked yellow were not logged 
as kimberlite from the drill chips, but were found to contain indicator minerals once the 
samples were concentrated and examined in the laboratory. The indicator minerals 
confirm that these holes are within the kimberlite, but that it is probably a basalt rich 
breccia that is difficult to identify in drill chips. The black dots are drillholes where no 
kimberlite was identified and indicator minerals were not recovered.

Fourteen holes which intersected kimberlite were sampled for macrodiamonds.  The 
kimberlite material from each hole was combined as one sample and processed on-site 
using the mobile DMS plant.  The samples yielded 443 kg of concentrate which was sent 
to GEMDL for diamond recovery.  The results are given in Table 11-3".

11.4 Phase 1 Delineation and Pilot Hole Core Drilling Programme 

The delineation core drilling programme commenced on 07 February 2005 and was 
completed on 19 September 2005. Seventeen delineation holes comprising fourteen 
planned holes and three additional holes were completed to a cumulative depth of 
6,904m. The three additional holes (DDH014-016) were planned to target the South Lobe 
and the sandstone bridge between the South and Centre Lobes. These holes confirmed 
the existence of the in-situ sandstone bridge separating the South and Centre Lobes and 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  44 

also intersected additional kimberlite below the South Lobe resulting in increased 
kimberlite volume. The Phase 1 delineation drilling is summarised in Table 11-4. 

The pilot core drilling programme commenced on 23 April 2005 and was completed on 23 
July 2005 with 12 core holes drilled to a cumulative depth of 2,979m. The pilot hole 
pattern was designed to achieve 70m grid hole spacing for Phase 1 LDD sampling (Figure 
11-7). The objectives of the pilot holes were to improve the knowledge of the internal 
geology of the kimberlite and to guide the LDD drilling to ensure that suitable kimberlite 
intersections would be encountered. This also allowed for selection of appropriate drill bits 
based on rock hardness. Thirteen (13) holes were planned, however only 12 were drilled 
because one of the planned holes was located too close to a previously drilled hole. The 
Phase 1 pilot core drilling is summarised in Table 11-5.

11.5 Phase 1 LDD Programme 

The objective of the LDD programme was to recover 500 carats of diamonds in order to 
gain accurate local and global grades as well as revenue estimates within the kimberlite 
down to 400m. The location of the Phase 1 LDD boreholes is shown in Figure 11-8. 

The LDD programme commenced on 07 July 2005 and was completed on 08 February 
2006 with 13 LDD holes completed to a cumulative depth of 3,699m. Sample was treated 
at the on-site DMS plant as described in sections 12 and 13 below. The drilling and 
macrodiamond results are given in Table 11-6.

11.6 Phase 2 Delineation and Pilot Hole Core Drilling Programme 

The pilot core drilling for Phase 2 commenced on 23 November 2005, midway through the 
Phase 1 programme. This was to ensure that most of the on-site activities would be 
completed by the first quarter of 2006. The overlap between Phase 1 and Phase 2 
evaluation programmes was decided taking into account De Beers' drive for more rapid 
and effective assessments of resources. The Phase 2 pilot core drilling was completed on 
22 August 2006 with 11 holes completed to a cumulative depth of 4,181m. Phase 2 pilot 
core drilling programme took longer to complete because of a 4 month break before an 
additional pilot core hole (PLT023) was drilled to precede an additional LDD hole 
(LDD030). Phase 2 pilot hole drilling is summarised in Table 11-7. 

Phase 2 delineation core drilling commenced on 08 April 2006 and was completed on 24 
February 2007 with 29 holes completed to a cumulative depth of 8,679m (Figure 11-9). A 
deep inclined hole (DDH020) was completed to a record depth of 884m into kimberlite. 
This core hole was drilled from the north of the North Lobe to the South Lobe and proved 
the existence of kimberlite below and between the three lobes. It also intersected a record 
nine pierce points. Phase 2 delineation core drilling is summarised in Table 11-8.

11.7 Phase 2 LDD Programme 

The Phase 2 LDD drillhole pattern (Figure 11-10) was designed to produce a sample grid 
centre size of 50m in order to increase the confidence in the grade model to an Indicated 
level. The additional diamonds from this programme were also to be used for valuation 
purposes. The location of LDD holes coincided with the pilot core hole positions  
(Figure 11-9). Sample was treated at the on-site DMS plant as described in sections 12 
and 13 below.  The drilling and macrodiamond results are summarized in Table 11-9.

11.8 Borehole Surveying 

The collar positions for the planned holes were established using a Leica DGPS 500 
system with a theoretical accuracy of about 5mm in X, Y and Z (elevation). The co-
ordinate system used for core drilling and LDD holes was WGS84, UTM35S. The planned 
hole collar position was marked with a peg with the drill hole number on it. For angled 
holes, two additional pegs were placed on the ground. One peg was placed approximately 
10m in front of the collar position peg indicating the planned azimuth and dip of the hole. 
The second peg was placed approximately 10m behind the collar position peg to assist in 
lining up the drill.  

Upon completion of drilling, all holes were rehabilitated, capped and marked. A De Beers 
geophysicist surveyed the final collar positions. Upon completion of a core hole, a down 
hole survey was undertaken to record the direction the hole had followed during drilling. 
The direction data together with the geological data was used to create the 3D geological 
model. During Phase 1, the pilot and delineation holes were down-hole surveyed with 
magnetometer based instruments.  Due to the high magnetic susceptibility of the 
kimberlite, there was a low level of confidence in the data produced.  All cored boreholes 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  54 

from Phase 2, and some from Phase 1, were down hole surveyed by Digital Surveying 
(Pty) Ltd using a gyroscope based instrument, a Target Inertial Navigating System (INS) 
Gyro, which is considered to be the best instrument available for this kind of work. 

11.9 Volume Determinations 

During drilling of the bulk sampling holes, the sample collected at the drill collar was de-
slimed by passing it over an inclined vibrating in-field screen, generally set at 1 mm 
(1.47 mm during the initial drilling phase).  The sample volume bagged is therefore much 
less that the true in-situ volume.  The latter, which is vital for grade calculation, was 
obtained by caliper logs of the LDD holes plus density measurements on the 
corresponding interval of core in the pilot hole.  Caliper results are subject to 
interpretation, as holes may cave during or after drilling.  If a hole caves during drilling, 
this will be reflected in a larger than normal volume of sample from that sampling interval, 
and the caliper result can be accepted as is.  If it is deduced that the hole caved after 
drilling, then the caving must be "smoothed over" in the caliper profile.  Conversely, 
kimberlite may swell after drilling due to clays absorbing moisture, thus if a hole measures 
less than the bit diameter the caliper log must be edited to reflect the bit diameter as a 
minimum size for the hole.  Boteti carried out approximate on-site interpretations of the 
caliper data.  In the event, caved profiles were accepted as is, as it proved difficult to 
determine whether caving occurred during or after drilling. 

Caliper surveys were carried out by contractor AquaEarth (Pty) Ltd from South Africa.  A 
4-arm Geovista caliper was used, which provides four independent estimates of the 
radius.  The surveys were run 2 to 3 times for verification. 

In the initial 12¼" bulk sampling drilling no calipers were run and the volume was 
calculated taking the nominal hole size.   

11.10 Density Measurements 

Density (specific gravity) measurements were done on core samples, by taking a 15 cm 
length of core and weighing it in air and in water.  During Phase 1, one sample was taken 
per 7 m of drilling (one per box).  During Phase 2, a density sample was measured every 
3 m. Figure 11-11 shows a compilation of density data from the Phase 1 drilling 
programme.

conducted by QuickLog Geophysics with the interpretations done by GRS Consulting. The 
objective was to investigate if the technique could assist in identifying different facies of 
kimberlite within each lobe to aid in developing an internal model of the kimberlite. The 
zones that were identified by the geophysics were already identified from the visual core 
logging so the geophysical method did not provide any better resolution to the model and 
the method was not pursued further.

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

Kimberlite AK6 has been extensively sampled for macrodiamonds by drilling and 
trenching as summarised in Table 12-1. A total of over 25,000 tonnes ("t") of sample have 
been collected, although not all of the trench sample has been processed, and the 
majority of sample from LDD hole 026 was not processed in the interest of rapid results 
turnaround, due to very high DMS yields from portions of the South Lobe.  Core from the 
pilot holes was sampled for microdiamonds, to provide a comparison with LDD results, 
and to provide more robust grade and revenue estimation (see section 17). However, 
given the advanced nature of the programme, it is the macrodiamond (diamonds >1 mm) 
results which are given attention here. 

In all cases sample collection was done by De Beers, except for the trench samples, 
which were collected by a mining contractor (Strata Mining (Pty) Ltd).

12.1 Sampling Objectives 

The objective of each sampling programme is summarized in Table 12-2. 

Table 12-2 
Summary of Sampling Objectives  

Phase Objective 

initial bulk sampling To sample AK6 kimberlite to 150 m depth, and especially to 
sample below uppermost parts which are diluted with basalt.  
Obtain a preliminary assessment of grade 

Phase 1 LDD To establish an inferred resource to 400 m (South Lobe) and 
180 m (North and Central Lobes).  Collect a parcel of 500 ct for 
valuation 

Phase 2 LDD and 
trenching 

To establish an indicated resource to 400 m (South Lobe) and 
250 m (North and Central Lobes), an inferred resource to 
700m, and to collect a parcel of 3,000 ct for valuation 

 

12.2 Sampling Methods 

12.2.1 Initial bulk sampling 

The initial bulk samples are summarized in Tables 10-1 and 11-2 above.  The samples 
were classified to +1.47 mm at the drill, the undersize being discarded.  The material from 
each borehole was combined and taken as one sample.  In-situ sample volume was 
calculated from the nominal hole diameter.  Densities were taken at 2.47 g/cm3 for the 
North and Central Lobes and 2.84 g/cm3 for the South Lobe.  The five boreholes were 
spaced quite evenly over the pipe (Figure 11-5 above), with two holes (1 and 2) in the 
South Lobe, two in the Central Lobe (3 and 4) and hole 5 in the North Lobe. 

The accuracy of the results could be affected by the lack of caliper logs, and therefore 
inaccurate volume estimates, and in the density figures being inappropriate, as these are 
estimates rather than measured.  The +1.47 mm cut-off makes the raw results 
incompatible with the later LDD results.  Nevertheless the main objective of the 
programme was achieved, in that it showed the kimberlite to carry a potentially economic 
grade. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  58 

12.2.2 Phase 1 & Phase 2 LDD 

The Phase 1 and 2 large diameter drilling samples are summarized in Tables 10-1, 11-6, 
11-9 and 12-1 above.   

The Phase 1 sampling objective was achieved, when 10,486 diamonds with a weight 
(after acidising) of 689 carat ("ct") were recovered.  Phase 2 drilling recovered an 
additional 5,980 stones, weighing 484.95 ct. 

The LDD samples were collected over 12 m intervals, corresponding to hypothetical 
mining benches.  They were collected in cubic meter polypropylene bulk bags, with 
varying numbers of bags making up one sample.  The bags were attached to the drill site 
shaker and received a feed of +1.00 mm material direct from the shaker. 

The Phase 1 LDD holes were logged by caliper as described in section 11.9 above, and 
corrected caliper data was used to estimate the volume drilled.  The density 
measurements used as tonnage factors were obtained from samples of core from the 
LDD pilot and core delineation holes. 

Volume and tonnage estimates for the Phase I and 2 LDD work were an improvement 
over those for the initial 12¼" drilling.  The reverse flood air-lift assist method also reduces 
diamond breakage relative to conventional reverse circulation drilling. 

Representative chip samples were taken during LDD programmes for every meter where 
recovery was achieved.  Each sample was placed in a plastic jar on a core tray. 

The LDD sampling showed that the diamond populations of the South Lobe and of the 
Central/North Lobes are different, therefore they would have to be treated separately for 
trench sampling.   

In order to reach an accurate estimation of revenue, a target was set to obtain 1,200 ct 
from the South Lobe and 1,800 ct from the Central Lobe.   

12.2.3 Trench Sampling 

The excavation of the trenches was contracted to Strata Mining (Pty) Ltd.  The trench 
locations were chosen to be in the highest grade zones determined by kriging where 
kimberlite was closest to surface.  Areas of basalt breccia in the South Lobe were 
avoided. 

Trench positions are shown in Figure 12-1.  The two trenches shared a common access 
ramp. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  59 

The highest kriged grades from drilling were for the North Lobe, but as the North Lobe's 
total carat contribution to the Central/North Lobe body is only 15%, it was decided to 
trench the Central Lobe and assume that the North Lobe would be similar. 

Trenching proceeded by identifying the depth at which kimberlite dilution is minimal.  
Diluted material was stripped and stockpiled on site.  Once the floor was prepared, the 
trench was surveyed, then re-surveyed on completion, thus deriving the total volume of 
kimberlite removed. 

In the Central Lobe, the surveying was complicated by measuring a floor in material that 
had already been blasted.  Because of this, a bulk factor of 0.81 was used in an attempt 
to correct the volume for this section (depths 7.5 – 10 m).  This factor was derived by 
comparing the number of loads required to haul in the sample and applying an average 
volume per load as calculated from the commissioning sample. 

Both trenches required blasting for fracturing the kimberlite.  This was done using 89 mm 
holes drilled on a 2.5 m grid.  The driller and surveyor calculated the depth for each hole 
to get down to the 10 m level.  The powder factor used was a maximum of 0.68 kg/m3.  It 
was believed that this would not result in any significant diamond breakage. 

The Central Lobe trench was excavated first, and sampled between depths of 7.5 and 
18 m.  Identification of the top of the kimberlite was more difficult in the South Lobe, which 
was therefore sampled between 10 and 18 m depths. 

The final volumes mined were measured by Strata Mining and by De Beers staff.  There is 
a considerable discrepancy, especially in the South Lobe, which De Beers attribute to 
access difficulties due to flooding, which limited the effectiveness of their survey crew.  
The figures are given in Table 12-3 below.

Figure 12-1 
Location of Bulk Sample Trenches into the South and Central Lobes 

 

 

The major flaw in the trench sampling was due to the uncertainty of the geological contact 
between the South and Central Lobes. Geochemical samples from pilot hole PLT006 
suggested that the South to Central Lobe contact could be flaring to the north.  This was 
entered into the geological model in May 2007, after the trenching work was finished.  It 
means that most of the Central Lobe trench is in fact in the South Lobe.  Because it had 
been established that the two lobes had different diamond populations, it was only 
possible to use a small amount of Centre Lobe trench data in revenue estimates. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  61 

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

Samples for macrodiamonds (+1.0 mm diamonds) were taken by means of: 

• Five 12¼" reverse circulation boreholes 
• 25 x 23" reverse flood airlift assist drilling 
• Trenching, where sample was loosened by blasting and/or earthmoving equipment 

 
All sample preparation and analysis was done by De Beers. 

13.1 Reverse Circulation, 12¼" Drilling 

The sample returned by the drill was de-slimed on site, at the drill, using a 1.47 mm 
screen.  No details of the quality control applied to this sample collection are available.  
For example, it is not known whether checks were made for +1.47 mm material passing 
into the undersize. 

All the material from each borehole was combined and treated as a single sample. 

The samples were sent to the De Beers Evaluation Services Department (ESD) laboratory 
in Kimberley, and a concentrate prepared using a DMS plant.  No details of this work, or 
of quality control measures, are provided.  The concentrate was shipped to the Group 
Exploration Macro-Diamond Laboratory (GEMDL) in Johannesburg for diamond recovery 

Due to inadequate information, it is not possible to comment on the sample preparation, 
security and analytical procedures. 

13.2 Reverse Flood Air-lift Assist Drilling (23"LDD) 

There were two phases of LDD work, the first from July 2005 – February 2006 (13 holes, 
3,699 m) and the second from April 2006 – August 2006 (12 holes, 4,265 m).  Sample 
preparation and analysis procedures were the same for both phases. 

Sample returned from the drill was de-slimed to +1.0 mm at the drill using a vibrating 
screen.  The undersize was monitored for loss of +1.00 mm material, which was due to 
loosening of bolts on the screen. When a problem was seen, for example, sample loss 
due to a leaking hose, the drill was stopped until it was addressed. 

The sample was collected from the screen in cubic meter sample bags, under supervision 
of a geologist.  It was then shipped to the DMS plant at the Letlhakane camp on a flat bed 
lorry, also under the charge of the geologist.  At the camp, the responsibility for the 
sample passed to the plant foreman. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  62 

The plant was a 10 t/hr dense media separation mobile unit.  During phase 1, the plant 
received 1,775 t of headfeed, which produced 112 t of concentrate, giving an average 
DMS yield of 6%.  Samples from the South Lobe had a significantly higher yield (7.8%) 
than those from the Central and North Lobes (mean 1.1%).  This can be related to the 
higher density of the South Lobe (average 2.78 t/m3) against the North and Central Lobes 
(average 2.43 t/m3).  During phase 2, the total headfeed was 2,235 t which produced 194 t 
of concentrate, a yield of 8%.  Again the difference between the South Lobe and the 
remainder of the pipe was very clear. 

Following processing, the concentrates were collected in plastic drums which were sealed 
with security tags, and stored within a secure cage.  The drums were then placed in sea 
containers with infra-red motion detector surveillance. 

Concentrates were shipped to GEMDL in Johannesburg inside sealed shipping containers 
which were carried on flat bed trucks.  The loading of the trucks was supervised by 
Debswana security and the Letlhakane police.  Both Debswana security and the 
Letlhakane police escorted the trucks to the Botswana / South Africa border.  Once 
cleared through customs, the trucks were escorted within South Africa by De Beers 
security officials.  The documentation accompanying the concentrates was in accordance 
with the Kimberley Process. 

13.3 Trench Samples 

The trench samples were concentrated at the Letlhakane camp in a similar manner to the 
LDD samples, except that in order to reduce the volume of sample to be processed 
through the plant and GEMDL, part of the sample was treated with a +2.00 mm bottom 
cut-off.   

Coarse +6.00 mm tailings from the DMS plant were re-crushed to -6.00 mm and re-
submitted to capture diamonds locked in the larger size fraction.  Undersize tailings  
(+1-6 mm) were discarded. 

The trench material required some modifications to the plant, which also allowed the 
average feed rate to be increased to 12 t/hr.  The modifications were: 

• A mobile jaw crusher pre-crushed the trench samples to -100 mm 
• A tertiary scrubber was added 
• The secondary jaw crusher was replaced by a cone crusher 
• Installation of a tailings screen and conveyors 
• Installation of a flocculant addition system at the de-sliming cyclone 
• Replacement of the 200 mm degritting cyclone with a 350 mm degritting cyclone 

 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  63 

Sample was taken to the Letlhakane camp in haul trucks owned by the contractor Strata 
Mining (Pty) Ltd.  The samples were stockpiled within the camp security area and each 
pile marked with a metal tag bearing the sample number. 

The concentrates were collected and shipped in the manner described above for the LDD 
samples. Their treatment at GEMDL and forwarding to Harry Oppenheimer House for 
acidising and re-weighing, was as for the LDD samples. 

13.4 Diamond Recovery 

Diamond recovery was done at GEMDL in Johannesburg. The diamond recovery 
parameters at GEMDL were the same for all phases.  The GEMDL facility is fully 
ISO17025 certified.  The recovery area of the GEMDL is a security "red area" and is 
subject to access control, three tier surveillance and hands off processing. 

The concentrates arrived at GEMDL in the same sealed 50 litre drums they had left the 
sample plant in.  Samples weighing 10 kg or more (wet) were treated through the main 
processing section.  Drums within one specific sample were combined to expedite 
treatment and ease of handling.  Material of -4 mm was passed through a dry X-ray 
sorting process with subsequent magnetic scalping of the X-ray tails to recover non-
luminescent diamonds.  Material +4 mm was passed through a wet X-ray process 
(Flowsort) with the X-ray tailings dispatched as process tailings.   

Diamond sorters removed diamonds from the prepared sample fractions.  This was done 
inside secure glove boxes and recovered diamonds were placed into magnetically sealed 
diamond canisters. 

All of the X-ray concentrates were sorted three times, and non-magnetic fractions were 
sorted once or twice.  The sorting efficiency was set at 98% diamond recovery (per carat 
weight).  Recovered diamonds were sent to the final sorting section and stripped 
concentrate tailings to the hand sort tailings packaging section.  Final sorting consisted of 
a number of processes aimed at arriving at a DTC sieve class for each sample.  There 
was also a de-falsification process which involves the removal of mis-identified material 
which is not diamond.  If necessary an infra-red spectrometer is used to confirm diamond. 
All equipment and floors were purged between consignments. For quality assurance, 
monitor diamonds were added to the sample by an external monitoring team.  After de-
falsification, the monitor diamonds were removed. 

The diamonds were then sieved using DTC standard diamond sieves.  Larger diamonds 
 (+ 3 sieve) were photographed. Diamond breakage studies were done on a selection of 
diamonds (see section 17.6.4). 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  64 

The diamonds were then sent to Harry Oppenheimer House in Kimberley, for acid 
cleaning, re-sieving and final re-weighing.  

The X-ray tailings were reconstituted and put into 50 litres blue plastic drums, packed into 
6 m shipping containers, and held at GEMDL pending a decision on their disposal. 

13.5 Statement of Opinion on the Sample Preparation, Security and 
Analysis 

From the information provided, the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures 
appear to be of very high quality.  All analytical work was done "in house" by De Beers, 
within ISO certified facilities.

The De Beers in-house Phase 1 and Phase 2 mineral resource classification data reviews 
were performed according to a validation template, and the methodology and data 
generated were rated accordingly. The validation procedure that was applied, scores the 
mineral resource estimates very highly. The template assesses parameters such as 
sample integrity, sample representivity, and estimation methodology, in determining the 
mineral resource models for geology, grade, volume, revenue and density. The 
recommended technical risk discount rate to be applied as a result of this assessment 
was 0%. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  66 

The review of the mineral resource by Z Star resulted in a small net decrease in the 
resource volume (1.3%) and total carats (0.35%). Following the issuing of this 
independent review, the De Beers Mineral Resource Classification Committee reviewed 
the classification of the mineral resource from 0 to 400 m and from 400 to 750 m. The 
mineral resource classifications remained unchanged as indicated and inferred 
respectively. This result increases confidence in the mineral resource model. 

The independent review by Anglo American was more critical, but concluded that the 
project is realistic, and was supportive of the continuation of the project. The major risks 
identified by the Anglo American review were as follows: 

• Geological Data – The review team identified different versions of the geological 
logs, and no data validation system or database audit trail in place. The risk was 
mitigated through migration of the data to an SQL database and auditing of data. 

• Geological Logging – The review team identified inconsistencies between the 
original hard copy logs, and captured database logs. Also, logs of dilution of primary 
kimberlite had not been incorporated. These errors were fixed and the geological 
model now incorporates dilution data. 

As a result of the mitigating steps taken, Anglo American describes the geological model 
as coherent and robust, and the mineral resource as comprehensive. The biggest risk 
identified was the revenue model, due to the relatively small parcel of diamonds valued. 
De Beers normally targets at least 3,000 carats to produce a +/- 15% revenue estimate, 
whereas a total of 1,760 carats have been valued from the AK6 kimberlite project, 
recovered from the Phase 1 and 2 drilling programmes, and the bulk sample trenching 
programme. 

This technical report was commissioned over two years after completion of the bulk 
sampling programmes upon which the mineral resource is based. Limited verification of 
the work described in the report has been possible. However, the following measures 
have been taken: 

• During the site visit, the location of boreholes was checked against the De Beers 
drilling reports and found to be accurate based on hand-held GPS measurements. 

• At the time of the site visit, the drill core was stored by De Beers at its Letlhekane 
field camp. Despite the lack of activity at the camp during the intervening period, the 
core is in good condition and is well marked in neatly stacked core trays. Re-logging 
of two cores was undertaken (DDH020 and DDH 033) and found to correspond well 
to the original logging undertaken by De Beers, and the drill log data recorded in the 
database.

15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The Boteti Project lies within the Orapa kimberlite cluster.  This area of kimberlite 
occurrences was first recognised in 1967 by De Beers Prospecting Botswana.  It includes 
83 known kimberlite intrusions, varying in size from the AK1 kimberlite, which at 110.6 ha 
is one of the largest kimberlite pipes in the world, to insignificant dykes and blows. 

The AK1 kimberlite is the main resource of the Orapa Diamond Mine which started 
production in 1971 and was the first diamond mine in Botswana. All of the existing mines 
in the Orapa Field are owned by the Debswana Diamond Mining Company, a 50:50 joint 
venture between De Beers Centenary and the Republic of Botswana.  The mines are 
operated by De Beers. 

The Boteti Project lies 25 km south of the Orapa Mine, and 23 km west of the Letlhakane 
Diamond Mine which was opened in 1977 (Figure 15-1).  In 2001, Debswana also opened 
the smaller Damtshaa Mine.

Orapa is the second largest commercially exploited kimberlite in the world.  (The largest is 
Maduwi in Tanzania, currently being mined by Petra Diamonds, but the grade at Maduwi 
is very much lower than Orapa). 

DMS concentrate from Letlhakane and Damtshaa is also processed at Orapa, where 
diamonds are recovered in a completely automated recovery plant (CARP).  The product 
of the CARP is sent to Jwaneng for final sorting in the fully integrated sort house (FISH).  
These technologies remove the need for manual handling of diamonds, and therefore 
minimise theft.

15.4 Firestone Diamonds BK11 

Firestone Diamonds plc (listed on the London AIM) is the controlling partner and operator 
in Monak Ventures (Pty) Ltd which is developing the BK11 kimberlite, 5.2 km northeast of 
the Boteti Project.  Given their close proximity, and common access road, developments 
at BK11 are very relevant to the Boteti Project. 

The history of BK11 echoes that of the AK6 kimberlite, in that it was held by De Beers and 
Debswana under a succession of prospecting licences but was not thoroughly 
investigated until when, under PL 1/97, it was incorporated in the Boteti Joint Venture.  De

16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

A large amount of metallurgical test work has been conducted on the Boteti Project in 
terms of Ore Dressing Studies (ODS) and diamond recovery test work. This work and the 
implications to the project are discussed in this section. In addition, density distribution 
has been mapped throughout the ore resource which will have an impact on DMS yield 
during processing. A potentially high yield area was identified within the South Lobe. The 
metallurgical test work has been used by Paradigm Project Management (Pty) Ltd 
("PPM") in a conceptual study ("Value Engineering Study") commissioned by African 
Diamonds plc in 2009, to propose different flow sheets for the project. The flow sheet 
recommended by this study is the basis for the financial model reviewed in section 18.2. 

The ODS and diamond recovery data from the test work is of very high quality, and it is 
the opinion of MSA that it provides for reduced technical risk in the PPM conceptual study. 

16.1 Ore Dressing Studies 

ODS were performed by De Beers as part of a conceptual study focused on acquiring 
initial metallurgical knowledge of the AK6 kimberlite ore body.  The study was conducted 
on 10 drill core samples from advanced exploration Phase 1, which provided an initial 
indication of the behaviour of the AK6 kimberlite material through a metallurgical flow 
sheet. 

A more extensive ODS programme was commissioned for the pre-feasibility ODS during 
the advanced exploration Phase 2. The pre-feasibility ODS focused on gaining a better 
understanding of and more confidence in the characteristics of the AK6 kimberlite ore 
body. 

The AK6 kimberlite pre-feasibility ODS focused on two areas, namely: 

• Conducting ODS characterisation work on 40 drill core samples 

• Conducting a pilot scale ODS focusing on: 

o Comminution pilot scale test work, including cone crusher pilot test work, 
High Pressure Rolls Crusher (HPRC) pilot test work and scrubbing laboratory 
and pilot scale test work. 

o Recovery pilot scale test including grease and milling test work 

o Slimes thickening, pumping and deposition pilot scale test work. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  74 

Whilst the flow sheet developed by De Beers through their conceptual, pre-feasibility and 
feasibility studies is no longer relevant, the data derived has been used subsequently in 
later studies, and significantly increases confidence in the flow-sheet proposed in the 
PPM conceptual study. 

16.2 Diamond Recovery 

Diamonds from advanced exploration Phase 1 totaling 689.01 carats were utilised to 
determine AK6 kimberlite diamond characteristics. The recovery tests included evaluating 
diamond Luminescence Intensity (LI) and rise-time properties, magnetic properties and 
laser Raman suitability as the final sorter for AK6 diamonds. It was determined that X-ray 
recovery is an appropriate technique for the Boteti Project. 

In addition, diamonds from the advanced exploration Phase 2 were utilised to conduct 
grease test work. These diamonds were sourced from GEMDL from different Large 
Diameter Drill (LDD) holes across the AK6 kimberlite deposit. These diamonds were used 
to assess the hydrophobicity characteristics of the AK6 diamonds and recovery 
efficiencies of grease technology. It was determined that grease is an appropriate 
recovery technology for the Boteti Project.

17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE 
ESTIMATES 

The mineral resource was defined by De Beers and has been reviewed by MSA 
(Johannes Ferreira). The geological, grade, density and block models were created 
primarily on the basis of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 drilling programmes (Table 11-1). The 
mineral resource has been validated by independent reviews as summarised in Table 
14-1. Nineteen different geological units were identified within the AK6 kimberlite and 
combined into five main groupings to represent the entire resource for the purpose of 
diamond content estimation. The groupings are; 1) South Lobe primary (SLP), 2) South 
Lobe weathered (SLW), 3) Centre/North Lobe primary (CNLP), 4) Centre/North Lobe 
weathered (CNLW), and 5) basalt breccias (BB). 

The mineral resource estimate reviewed by MSA is based on data obtained from the two 
sampling phases of 23 inch LDD followed by a trench bulk sample to boost the diamond 
parcel for diamond value and revenue estimation as well as to provide production 
recovery information.  

Diamond content was estimated in terms of ct/m3 in regular ore blocks 25 x 25 x12 m in 
size from surface to 750m below surface. Sampling density allows local estimation to 
400m depth (indicated resource). Global grades were calculated between 400m and 
750m depth.  

Block density and grade estimates were combined with block volume to calculate block 
tonnes and carats. 

Kimberlite volume was estimated on the basis of NQ and BQ size core drilling directed at 
obtaining contacts between kimberlite and country rock as well as internal contacts 
between main geological units. Large diameter holes were accompanied by pilot core 
holes for guidance with respect to LDD, to facilitate geological logging of LDD samples 
and to further enhance internal pipe geometry. 

Density estimation was based on high quality core sample density measurements. 
Sample size was measured by means of caliper logging and sample grade was 
expressed in terms of carats per cubic meter (ct/m3). As in the case of diamond content, 
sampling data was grouped in accordance with similar density. 

The diamond parcel was valued at different stages during the sampling campaign and the 
most recent valuation was done by Mercury Diamond in Geneva during February 2010. 
The valuation was based on the final diamond parcel comprising 1,754 carats split into 16 
sub-parcels. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  76 

Average diamond value was based on estimates for expected diamond value and 
diamond content per diamond sieve class. 

17.1 Grade Data 

Diamond grade was estimated on the basis of Phase 1 and 2 LDD sampling (sections 11 
and 12). 

Phase I sampling delivered a total of 690.76 carats from thirteen 23-inch LDD holes drilled 
on 70m grid centre hole spacing. The total sample comprised an estimated 2,750 
callipered tonnes with 1,775 tonnes reporting as DMS headfeed.  

Phase 2 sampling was aimed at delivering a mineral resource at indicated category and 
drilling was therefore directed towards filling a 50m sampling grid. The programme 
comprised 12 holes, two of which went down to 700m depth. These holes yielded some 
3,300 calipered tonnes and 2,235 tonnes reporting as DMS headfeed. 

LDD samples comprised material from 12m sections to coincide with 12m bench heights 
selected for mining. As a consequence, subsequent regularisation for estimation purposes 
had very little effect on sample values.  

Table 17-1 shows regularised sample grade per rock type from LDD sampling. Nineteen 
different rock types are shown with their allocation to South Breccia, South Primary, 
Centre/North Breccia and Centre/North Primary denoting groupings used for diamond 
content modeling.

17.2 Grade analysis 

Diamond content was estimated by means of geostatistical analysis of the regularised 
grade data in terms of ct/m3. Variograms were modeled for each sample group and 
samples within a moving neighbourhood around a resource block were used to obtain a 
grade estimate by kriging. 

Table 17-2 shows the variogram parameters used for kriging. The Breccia units contained 
insufficient data for variography and their estimation was based on variography for the 
primary units.

Samples were not uniformly distributed in space and some blocks were less informed 
than others. Where the specified first pass kriging neighbourhood contained insufficient 
data for estimation the neighbourhood was increased to include more samples. 

Table 17-3 shows neighbourhoods used in the first and second kriging passes.

In all cases the neighbourhood was split into 4 sectors with the minimum and optimal 
number of samples per sector being 3 and 10. Blocks were discretised into 10x10x1 sub-
blocks for kriging. 

Appropriate adjustments were made to prevent single large sample values from adversely 
influencing blocks in their neighbourhood.

17.3 Density data 

The methodology for measuring density is described in section 11.10. Density data was 
divided into four geological groupings for estimation purposes. Table 17-5 shows density 
data within each grouping and the corresponding rock code. Substantial numbers of 
samples were collected from the main rock types. Analysis of data in the main geological 
groups compensated for sparseness of data in some of the smaller rock groups.

17.4 Density analysis 

Variograms were modeled for each sample group and samples within a moving 
neighbourhood around a resource block were used to obtain a density estimate by kriging. 
The use of hard boundaries prevented samples from different groupings to be included in 
the same kriging neighbourhood during kriging.  

Table 17-6 shows variogram parameters and Table 17-7 shows associated kriging 
neighbourhoods used for kriging.

Although sufficient data was available to perform variography for all groupings, part of the 
Breccia grouping remained uninformed after the first kriging pass. In this zone the breccia 
unit was complemented with data from the fresh basalt unit. Three uninformed blocks in 
the Centre and North weathered grouping were informed by using average bench kriged 
density for the unit. 

Average kriged estimates compared well with corresponding average sampling data per

17.5 Diamond content from density and grade analysis 

 

Block grade and density estimates were used to calculate block tonnes and carats to 
compile diamond content to a depth of 400m below surface as shown in Table 17-9.

The resource was extended from 400m from 750m depth based on extrapolation of 
grades for the units extending to this depth.  

The Centre and North Lobes do not extend the full depth and only the fragmental 
kimberlite unit extends below 400m. The average grade of 0.51cts/m3 for kriged block 
estimates between 256m and 280m was used as an estimate for grade in the 208,000 
tonnes below 400m.  

A similar averaging process was used for South Lobe below 400 m, where three units 
extend below 400m, adding some 21 million tonnes to the resource.  

Consequently this part of the resource is less reliable with a corresponding affect on its 
allocated resource category.  

The additional resource below 400m is summarised in Table 17-10, with global grades per 
lobe.

17.6 Diamond Revenue         

17.6.1 Introduction 

The most recent diamond revenue modeling was performed by MSA (Johannes Ferreira) 
and is based on the valuation conducted by Mercury Diamond in February 2010, and size 
frequency distributions of the diamonds derived from Phase 1 and Phase 2 drilling and 
trenching micro- and macrodiamond size frequency data. 

LDD sampling provided grade information suitable to form a 3-dimensional grade model, 
while trench sampling was aimed at increasing the diamond parcel to be large enough to 
satisfy regulatory requirements for diamond valuation. A further benefit of trench sampling 
was that the excavation method is similar to what would be encountered during production 
and would also provide a diamond size distribution which realistically represents the 
expected production.  

Subsequent re-modeling of pipe geology indicated that the Centre Lobe trench intersected 
both the Centre and South Lobes and that the bulk of material sampled did not accurately 
represent the Centre Lobe (see section 12.2.3). An additional trench sample comprising 
some 2,500 tonnes of kimberlite from Centre/North Lobe was therefore collected. 

Trench samples were treated slightly different from LDD samples from Phase I and II in 
that the mobile plant was upgraded to include a tertiary scrubber, cone crusher and a re-
crush circuit. Initially a +1mm bottom screen size was used but this was changed to 
+2mm in order to speed up the resource delivery process.  Therefore 50% of trench 
material was treated at +1mm bottom cut-off, with the remainder treated at +2mm. The 
change in recovery results is clearly visible in diamond size distribution analysis.

Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  86 

Diamond value modeling comprises estimates of average diamond value per size class 
and an estimate of diamond content with size. Diamond breakage and different treatment 
processes applied during LDD and surface trench sampling introduced some 
complications with size modeling. To produce a more robust size frequency model, the 
microdiamond sampling results were used to augment the macrodiamond data. Value 
models by Mercury Diamonds were therefore complemented by an additional modeling 
exercise, focussed on establishing a robust diamond size frequency and based on a 
combination of microdiamond and macrodiamond sampling results.  

Valuation results suggested different sets of values for the three lobes, with South Lobe 
size class values consistently lower than the Centre Lobe and with the North Lobe being 
consistently higher in all size classes. Because the geology for the North and Centre 
Lobes is reported as being very similar and with similar grades, a combined value profile 
was modeled for the two lobes.   

17.6.3 Diamond size 

North Lobe results suggest a finer size distribution than Centre and South Lobes, with 
South Lobe slightly finer than Centre Lobe. The North Lobe is represented by only 113 
carats from LDD sampling and no diamonds from surface trenches. Centre Lobe LDD 
results were complemented by surface trench results and the two sets of sampling results 
indicate a similar size distribution. The fine size distribution seen in North Lobe LDD 
samples was due to the absence of large stones in the parcel. However the distribution of 
stones in the smaller size classes suggests a similar size distribution to the Centre Lobe. 
Furthermore, because of the similarity in geology between North and Centre Lobes a 
combined size distribution was modeled for North and Centre Lobes.  

Microdiamond data were combined with macrodiamond results to model the diamond size 
frequency for the South and Centre Lobes. Sufficient stones were available for each lobe 
to permit a modeling exercise for all diamonds above 0.074mm in size.  

The technology comprises an iterative simulation process of deriving model parameters 
and generating a diamond parcel for comparison with microdiamond sampling results, 
until simulated and actual diamond parcels display identical size distributions. The 
assumed model is tested by simulating a large typical diamond parcel including diamonds 
from the entire size range, which can be compared with microdiamonds and 
macrodiamonds from the sampling programme. The size distribution model is accepted if 
it reproduces both the micro- and macrodiamond size distributions as seen from sampling. 

The use of microdiamonds for diamond size modeling has the potential to expose effects 
such as diamond breakage that may be present in macrodiamonds, which is often the 
case with diamonds from LDD sampling. Trench sampling results were therefore used as 
confirmation of the size models based on microdiamonds. For both the South and Centre 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  87 

Lobes it was possible to recreate respective size distributions similar to actual trench 
sampling results, thus confirming the applicability of the respective total diamond content 
size distribution models. Modeling based on microdiamonds also resulted in a slightly 
coarser size distribution for the Centre Lobe compared with the South Lobe, which 
corresponds with LDD and surface trench sampling results. 

Average values modeled by Mercury Diamonds were combined with the revised size 
distribution models and overall average diamond values are shown in Table 17-12.

The supplementary modeled values were based on value models by Mercury Diamond 
and revised size models based on microdiamond sampling. Supplementary model values 
are given at +1mm recovery similar to recovery at the LDD sampling plant. 

17.6.4 Diamond Breakage 

Sampling by means of large diamond drilling is normally accompanied with some degree 
of diamond breakage. Diamond treatment could also result in diamond breakage if 
crushing in the treatment plant takes place at inappropriate crusher apertures and is 
directly related to the coarseness of the diamond size distribution under treatment. The 
coarseness of AK6 diamonds makes this a likely scenario and could explain the high 
levels of diamond breakage that have been reported for this resource. 

Significant breakage could affect diamond size and in some cases recovered grade as 
well. The AK6 resource grade has been estimated based on sample carat weight and not 
on sample stone count (stone density) in view of the possible effect of diamond breakage 
on stone counts. This however does not exclude losses in sample carat weight in cases 
where broken fragments were screened out with undersize material, resulting in reduction 
in sample grade. Therefore, significant upside grade potential exists. Furthermore, the 
South Lobe exhibits relatively high density (2.70 g/cm3) which also suggests that grade 
estimates may be conservative.  



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  88 

Microdiamond analysis has been used to compensate for diamond breakage effects on 
diamond size and provides an improved model on which to assess the overall effect of 
breakage on diamond revenue. 

17.7 Recovery factors: 

The use of a total content model allows calculation of recovery losses during sample 
treatment. All LDD samples were treated with +1mm bottom screens, while surface trench 
sample treatment initially took place at +1mm bottom screen size, but was later switched 
to +2mm. 

Factors for +1mm and +2mm were calculated from sampling information, while +1.47mm 
factors have been estimated (Table 17-13). 

Table 17-13 
Modifying factors between total diamond recovery and recovery at +1mm, 

+1.47mm and +2mm. 
 

Recovery Modifying Factors With total diamond

'+7ds 1 1 1 

'+5ds 1 0.8 0.5 

'+3ds 1 0.5 0.05 

'+1ds 0.3 0.1 0.01 
 

The factors for LDD and trench sampling are notable for apparent full recovery of 
diamonds in the bottom sieves, due to the high degree of comminution of diamond 
bearing particles achieved during sampling and treatment. The same degree of 
cominution may not be feasible or possible during production, with subsequent losses of 
diamonds in these lower sieves. However, calculations have shown that the effect on 
dollar per tonne will be marginal, because the bulk of revenue exists in the coarser 
stones. 

17.8 Resource Classification 

The AK6 mineral resource has been classified as an indicated mineral resource from 
surface to 400m, while the resource below 400m has been classified as an inferred 
resource, down to 750m. This was done on the basis of the geological, grade, density and 
revenue models according to a set of scorecards established by De Beers, which are fully 
compliant with NI 43-101 requirements. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  89 

The most recent valuation exercise has led to increases in average diamond value and 
the supplementary work done on diamond size suggests further potential increase in 
value. The revaluation exercise has not reduced the classification status for the resource. 

17.9 Mineral Resource Statement 

The bottom cut-off for treatment of the AK6 material has not been finalised and resource 
to reserve modifying factors were set at unity under the assumption that production 
treatment will be at least as efficient as during sampling. 

The recovery factors listed in Table 17-13 above therefore remain the only factorisation to 
obtain diamond recovery realistically representing what is to be expected during mining. 

The AK6 resource to 400m is estimated at 11 million carats in 51 million tonnes at an 
average grade of 22 ct/100t and an average value of USD 194/ct and is classified as 
indicated. 

Between 400 and 750 m, the resource contains 4m carats at an average grade of 19 
ct/100t and an average value of USD183/ct and is classified as inferred. 

A summary of the mineral resource at +1mm is given in Table 17-14.

17.10 Mineral Reserve Estimate 

The mineral resource was subject to a Whittle Four-X optimisation by PPM as part of 
the conceptual study to produce an open pit model (Figure 17-1) of the optimum 
mineable volume and tonnage from each lobe of the AK6 kimberlite. All of the optimally 
mineable mineral resource thus identified falls within the indicated resource portion of 
the kimberlite. The mineral reserve defined thus falls into the probable reserve 
category. 

Annual mining schedules have been defined, starting with an initial cut on the North 
and Centre Lobes, and a second cut commencing on the South Lobe. Table 17-15 
shows the probable reserve produced from the optimisation process. Note that this 
reserve is presented with the tonnages defined by the PPM study with a set of 
revenues provided by De Beers and African Diamonds in July 2008. These revenues 
were USD 151 per carat for the North and Centre Lobes, and USD 137 per carat for 
the South Lobe. The revenue figures in the table were produced in February 2010 from 
a valuation exercise by Mercury Diamond, and revenue modeling by MSA. The Whittle 
optimisation has not yet been repeated with the latest revenues. Potential therefore 
exists for the tonnages in the reserve statement to increase.

18 DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC 
STUDIES 

The full lifecycle of a conventional capital project (such as mine development) contains 
a series of technical and economic studies which can be summarised as follows: 

• Conceptual Study (CS) to investigate the viability and investment parameters 
and to develop the business case for a future project. Appropriate estimates for 
the downstream project phases will also be delivered. 

• Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS). If a business case can be proven to exist in the 
conceptual study a pre-feasibility study will evaluate technical options, select 
the one most suitable to achieve the business case and estimate future costs to 
a level of accuracy +/-25%.  A developer may elect to forego a pre-feasibility 
study and proceed directly to a feasibility study on the basis of a thorough 
conceptual study which indicates robust project economics. 

• Feasibility Study (FS). If the pre-feasibility option is acceptable a feasibility 
study will design a solution based on the chosen option and final asset 
acquisition costs will be estimated to a level of accuracy +/- 15%. 

• Implementation. Project financing and implementation. 

The Boteti project has been subjected to a number of technical and economic studies 
to determine optimal mining and treatment methodology, and to value the project in 
terms of internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV). These studies are 
summarised in Table 18-1. All of the studies provide for a positive IRR, and only one of 
the studies determined a negative NPV based on a 10% hurdle rate (the De Beers 
feasibility study in 2008).

All of these studies are technically and procedurally valid. The high variability in the 
financial outputs of these studies can be ascribed largely to the following reasons: 

• Different approaches to project development. 

• Different corporate cost structures. 

• Different capex and opex requirements, particularly for different plant designs. 

• Different hurdle rates applied. 

A contrast in development plans is apparent between the De Beers studies and those 
conducted by PPM. The De Beers development plan adopted state-of-the-art 
technology, including high cost tertiary high pressure grinding roll crushing, and single 
particle diamond recovery units. This approach aspires to maximum diamond recovery, 
but results in high capital costs and operating costs in addition to higher corporate 
overheads inherent in a major multinational organisation. The PPM development plan 
has adopted autogenous milling technology and more conventional diamond liberation 
and recovery technology with the aim to maximise return on investment.  As a result, 
capex and opex costs are lower, and the relatively reduced recovery of smaller 
diamonds through this approach has a comparatively minor affect on revenue 
generation. The loss of very small stones due to 'lock-up' has a very minor impact on 
overall revenue, particularly on a project with a coarse diamond size frequency 
distribution such as Boteti. The partners in the Boteti joint venture have elected to 
follow the PPM development plan, so the technical and economic study reviewed in 
this document is the most recent and most relevant one; that is the PPM conceptual 
study dated June 2009. 

18.1 Conceptual Study 

The 'Value Engineering Study' prepared by PPM in 2009 is essentially a conceptual 
study. Some key aspects of the conceptual study are summarised below.  

18.1.1 Mineral Reserve 

The mineral reserve is stated in section 17.10 above. 

 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  94 

18.1.2 Mining 

The requirement to minimise initial capital expenditure dictated that the mining process 
at AK6 would have to be undertaken by a contractor. The parameters of the contract 
were based on the mining plan in Table 18-2. 

Table 18-2 
Summary of Phased Mining Plan  

Mine Phase Kimberlite Mined 

(Millions of tonnes) 

Waste Stripped 

(Millions of Tonnes) 

Phase 1 8.5 19.2 

Phase 2 27.2 70.7 

Life of Mine (LOM) 35.7 89.9 

 

Basil Read Mining was requested to produce a contractor mining cost based on the 
mine plan. In line with the requirement to minimise capex, a wet rate contract was 
derived which produced an overall LOM cost of USD10.03 per tonne of kimberlite 
delivered to the plant. A mining schedule is included in Appendix 1. 

Pit dewatering will be undertaken by well fields around the perimeter of the pit. This 
water will be used for the ore processing plant process water. Any excess water will be 
stored in a separate storm water dam adjacent to the slimes dam return water dam. 

The capital and operating costs are summarised in Appendix 2. 

 

 
18.1.3 Ore Processing  

The kimberlite treatment plant design was based on the requirement to minimise up-
front capital expenditure. However, the selected design must still ensure an economic 
return for both Phases 1 and 2 of the project. It was therefore important to ensure that 
the Phase 1 plant design was adequate for both any future expansion in capacity and 
also any necessary process changes that may be required during Phase 2. 

Three flow sheet options were considered and the technologies utilised in the most 
beneficial flow sheet consists of the following unit processes: 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  95 

1. Primary crushing 

2. Autogenous milling 

3. Dewatering and screening 

4. Dense medium separation (DMS) 

5. Magnetic separation 

6. X-ray machines 

7. Grease belt 

8. Hand sorting 

The dewatering process makes use of a spiral classifier in order to reduce the overall 
plant water consumption and thereby remove the need for an expensive internal water 
recovery circuit. The DMS plant has also been designed to minimise water 
consumption without seriously compromising ferrosilicon consumption. 

This study has determined that the operation of the plant should be contracted out in 
order to minimise capital expenditure. 

The recoverability of diamonds from the AK6 kimberlite has been determined through 
X-ray luminosity and grease testwork (section 16). It is assumed that the plant will be at 
least as efficient as the sampling plant, and recovery factors have been established for 
smaller diamonds at different bottom screen size cut-offs (Table 17-13). 

18.1.4 Diamond Market 

All diamond projects are very sensitive to diamond revenue and diamond price 
fluctuations (Figure 20-1). Forward looking diamond demand and supply models in 
recent years have all indicated a steady rise in demand (driven largely by Chinese and 
Indian consumers) with a steady decrease in supply as major diamond resources are 
depleted, and few new mines coming into production. This scenario was driving 
diamond prices higher until the third quarter of 2008, when the global financial crisis 
caused a rapid decline in diamond prices. As signs of global economic recovery 
appear, the diamond price has resumed its upward trend. Polished diamond prices 
rose by nearly 3.5 percent between the beginning of January and the end of February 
2010. "While that dramatic increase is not sustainable for any length of time, it 
illustrates the momentum that is building to push polished diamond prices higher, both 
near term and over the longer term." (Idex online - http://www.idexonline.com). In a 
presentation given to the colloquium entitled "Diamonds - Source To Use" held in 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  96 

Gaborone from 1 – 3 March 2010, Allan - Hochreiter (an independent corporate finance 
company) forecast real growth in diamond prices of 7% per annum from now until 
2020. Royal Bank of Canada Europe Limited, an investment bank, published an equity 
research report on the diamond industry on 3rd March 2010. This report also forecasts 
a 7% increase between now and January 2011.  

The preferred marketing arrangement for the Boteti production will be through auction. 
No sales contract is currently envisaged. However, no marketing methodology has yet 
been finalised. 

 
18.1.5 Infrastructure and Logistics 

Due to the decision to use a wet rate mining contract, very little provision is required for 
the capital cost of maintenance and other facilities.  The capital and operating costs for 
maintenance of the earthmoving fleet are included in the earthmoving unit rate. 

A fuel depot will be erected and operated by the fuel supplier. 

The plant operating contractor will provide its own workshop and stores facilities to 
support the process plant maintenance activities. 

Power will be supplied to the mine by the Botswana Power Corporation (BPC).  A new 
33 kV line will be erected from Orapa.  Approximately 6 MVA is required to operate the 
mine in Phase 1, increasing to 10MVA in Phase 2. 

Process water supply will be predominantly from the pit dewatering well field, 
supplemented by up to 4 additional wells initially, potentially increasing to 9 in Phase 2. 

Potable water will be provided via a standard filtration/reverse osmosis/chlorination 
system. This water will be used for human consumption, in the offices and for selected 
equipment in the Recovery Plant. 

Due to the decision to contract out the mining and plant operations, minimal 
infrastructure is required at the mine. 

AK6 Mine personnel will be housed, or find accommodation in Letlhakane and the 
surrounding area. There will be minimal accommodation on site and this will mainly be 
for shift maintenance personnel and emergencies.  

Communications will be provided by the Botswana Telecommunications Company via 
a broadband connection. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  97 

A first aid station will be established on the mine to treat injuries and minor ailments.  
Government facilities in Letlhakane and Serowe, and possibly Debswana facilities in 
Orapa will be utilised for more serious medical cases. 

The capex figure used in the financial modeling includes a 30% contingency, which 
significantly reduces the risk regarding capital outlay at the start of mine development. 

18.1.6 Environmental Considerations 

A comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was prepared by Geoflux 
(Pty) Ltd and reported on 28th September 2007.  The Objectives of the EIA were: 

• Compliance with the EIA Act of 2005 and facilitate approval from the 
Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA); 

• To undertake an Archaeological / Heritage Impact Assessment to comply with 
the Monuments and Relics Act (1970) and facilitate approval by the Department 
of National Museums, Monuments and Art Gallery;  

• To disseminate project information to the local community; 

• To undertake a comprehensive Social Impact Assessment (SIA); 

• To facilitate project development that will benefit the local community; 

• To identify and facilitate compensation to all affected individuals; 

• To articulate an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) that will allow for 
ongoing management and monitoring of impacts; 

• To ensure compliance with national and international legislative requirements; 

• To produce a report that would serve as supporting documentation to a Mining 
Licence application. 

Four key potential impacts of the EIA were identified: resource use, economic benefits, 
visual/aesthetic disturbance, and social disruption. All of the negative impacts have 
been mitigated through management plans. The main impact of resource use relates to 
groundwater abstraction resulting from the pit dewatering and proposed well field. 
Water is a sensitive issue given its scarcity in the project area, and the presence of 
other users i.e. farmers and other mining operations. The EIA proposed that these 
impacts be addressed through monitoring and development of an integrated water 
management strategy jointly with other users and local and central government 
authorities. The EIA further suggests that the loss of grazing resources be addressed 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  98 

through an existing compensation framework and that a Relocation Action Plan be 
formulated. 

Biophysically, the proposed mine will result in land dereliction in some areas and 
visual/aesthetic disturbance due to open pit and residue deposits and waste rock 
dumps. Although these impacts are irreversible, mitigation can be achieved through 
rehabilitation and re-vegetation where possible, and fencing off of the pit to render it 
safe for the local community and their livestock. 

The overall recommendation of the EIA was that the project should proceed with the 
commitment to implement the proposed monitoring and management programmes in 
collaboration with stakeholders. 

No major risk is perceived by MSA with respect to environmental issues. 

 
18.1.7 Security 

Security planning is based on the premise that product protection and security is a core 
business within a diamond mine.  

The security systems have been designed to concentrate on the main areas of risk, i.e. 
the DMS cyclone spigot boxes, the transfer of concentrates to the Recovery Plant, the 
X-ray machines, the grease belts, the magnetic separator and the sort house. The 
design of the treatment plant is such that minimal contact with any concentrates and 
diamonds is the norm. A personnel X-ray machine was included in the scope of work 
due to the recent changes in the laws in Botswana. However, Boteti have subsequently 
indicated that they do not plan to use personnel X-ray technology on site. 

 
18.1.8 Manpower 

The zero based manpower plan indicates a Boteti complement of 97 people for Phase 
1, increasing to 99 in Phase 2. This excludes the personnel for the contract mining and 
plant operations. 

 
18.1.9 Feasibility Study 

The Conceptual Study by PPM provided the basis on which a decision was made to 
proceed with a Feasibility Study. 

The estimated cost for the Feasibility Study is USD 1,636,280. At the time of preparing 
this report the feasibility study is underway. PPM are the principal consultants 
undertaking the feasibility study. 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  99 

18.1.10 Life of Mine 

The Value Engineering Study is based on a two phased approach to the development 
of the mine. Phase 1 of the project is designed to treat 8.5 million tonnes of kimberlite 
during the first five years of operation (Figure 17-1). Phase 2 increases this production 
rate to 4 million tonnes per annum for the remaining life of mine, therefore treating a 
further 27.2 million tonnes of kimberlite. The total life of mine (LOM) plan would treat 
35.3 million tonnes of kimberlite, yielding 7.6 million carats over 12 years. 

The waste stripping required to expose the ore totals 90 million tonnes for the life of 
mine. Opportunities to reduce the amount of waste stripping are expected as the 
operations evolve, and the mine plan becomes more refined. The Phase 1 mine plan 
was derived, along with the rest of the study, to ensure that no lower grade kimberlite 
facies were sterilised.  

 

18.2 Financial Model 

The MSA Group has reviewed the financial model created by PPM and revised and 
updated it by converting it into an inflate/deflate model, and applying the most recent 
diamond revenue model. The result is a significant increase in the Boteti Project's 
NPV. 

18.2.1 Valuation Methodology 

In order to select an appropriate methodology to be applied in determining a value for 
the Boteti Project, reference has been made to the "Standards and Guidelines for 
Valuation of Mineral  Properties" prepared by the Special Committee of the Canadian 
Institute of Mining,  Metallurgy and Petroleum on the valuation of Mineral properties 
(the CIMVAL Code). 

In terms of the CIMVAL Code, the Target Property may be described as a 
"Development Property", which is defined as follows: 

"a Mineral Asset that is being prepared for mineral production and for which 
economic viability has been demonstrated by a Feasibility Study or Pre-feasibility 
Study and includes a Mineral Asset which has a current positive Feasibility Study or 
Pre-feasibility Study but is not yet financed or under construction." 

In terms of this definition, the Code indicates that two acceptable valuation approaches 
should be considered, and identifies two approaches that could be applied to a 
Development Property. These are, in order of preference: 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  100 

• Income Approach – based on the principle of anticipation of benefits and 
includes all methods that are based on the income or cash flow generation 
potential of the Target property, and 

• Market Approach – based primarily on the principle of substitution and is also 
called the Sales Comparison Approach. The Target property being valued is 
compared with the transaction value of similar Mineral Properties. 

In terms of the above approaches, and given that there is no comparable transaction 
value for the Target Property, the most appropriate valuation method for the Target 
property is the "Discounted Cash Flow" method. 

18.2.2 Development of the "Cash Flow" Valuation Model 

A 12 year Life-of-Mine model for the AK6 deposit was received for review. Three 
different options, viz. Case A, B and C, for the development of the deposit were 
considered.  The Value Engineering Study (carried out by PPM) concluded that only 
one of the cases (Case C) was viable based on economic and technical factors.  A 
valuation model was developed in conjunction with all the relevant information 
contained in the Value Engineering Report.  Subsequently, a sufficiently robust 
valuation model that would facilitate the verification of the profitability of the Boteti 
Project (Case C) was developed considering a production plan based on a 12 year 
Life-of-Mine operation. 

In developing a suitably robust valuation model, a set of underlying economic 
assumptions relating to exchange rates, commodity prices, and inflation parameters 
was developed by MSA.  This set of assumptions is detailed in the valuation model, 
and went through a number of revisions based on discussions with PPM.  A final mine 
plan and valuation model was developed as follows: 

• The final production plan has been based on a 12 year life-of-mine as given; 

• The grade of the diamond reserve is based on a De Beers Feasibility Study for 
the Boteti Project dated October 2008; 

• Capital expenditure estimates were based on the PPM Value Engineering 
Study Report Final, dated 22 June 2009; 

• Operating costs for the plant are as reviewed by PPM;  

• Corporate costs are based on the PPM CS;  

• The mineral reserve used in the study was defined by Whittle analysis of the 
most recent mineral resource updated in 2008, and is classified as 'probable'; 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  101 

• Grades have been estimated using a 1.0mm bottom size cut-off while revenue 
is based on the revenue modeling applied to the most recent diamond valuation 
completed in February 2010; 

• Annual power cost increases, based on the anticipated power costs to be 
charged by the BPC. These costs have been assumed for the Boteti Project 
despite the fact that they have not yet been ratified by the Government of 
Botswana. The costs have been escalated in real terms until 2014, and have 
been left constant thereafter as it is not known what inflationary increases will 
be applied after that date; 

• Sensitivity "switches" were incorporated into the model including three sets of 
exchange rates, the option to include/exclude inflation and the option to select a 
pure equity form of financing or a debt/equity scenario; 

• A set of financial statements including income statement, balance sheet, cash 
flow, debt schedule, depreciation and tax schedule were incorporated; 

• In order to correctly reflect the after-tax returns and potential profitability of the 
Boteti Project, the valuation model incorporates the expected taxes and 
royalties that the project would be required to comply with.  

 

18.2.3 Mining Taxation 

The Boteti Project will be subject to taxation payments, on an annual basis, on the 
profits it generates, after allowing for any current and unredeemed capital expenditure 
balances that it may incur or have carried forward. The Project is taxed in accordance 
with the Twelfth Schedule of the Botswana Income Tax Act.  Mining profits are taxed 
according to the following formula:  

Annual Tax Rate equals:  70 - (1,500 divided by x)  

Where x is the profitability ratio calculated as taxable income as a percentage of gross 
income, provided that the minimum rate applicable is the company flat rate of 25% of 
annual taxable income. Mining capital expenditure is deductible in full in the year in 
which the expenditure was incurred.  

In preparing its valuation model, MSA has utilised an "inflate/deflate" methodology, 
whereby: 

• All money inputs are escalated using an inflation scenario, so as to allow for the 
correct handling of any taxation and royalty calculations, and 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  102 

• The resultant operating cash flow is then deflated to bring the money back to 
constant money terms for the determination of any Net Present Value (NPV) 
and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculations. 

It must be noted that, given the above methodology, the NPV's reflected in the 
valuation model may be directly related to the real rate of return that that particular 
Model should deliver. 

All input figures were assumed to be in real terms, i.e. 31 March 2010.  
Inflation/deflation techniques were applied to derive the correct after- tax real terms 
cash flows. 

18.2.4 Mining Royalty 

The Project is subject to a royalty of 10% on revenue. 

18.2.5 Profitability of the Venture 

In terms of the underlying economic assumptions in the PPM study, the probable 
mineral reserve and the updated financial model, and the results of the verification of 
the valuation of the property, the profitability, (based on a 75:25 debt : equity ratio; 
latest 6 month average of exchange rates and including inflation) is as follows: 

 

Net Present Value10%                                       USD 147.1 million 

Net Present Value15%                                       USD 109.9 million 

Internal rate of return                                      70.0% 

Life-of-Mine cash cost (real terms)                USD16.62/t kimberlite treated 

Payback period                                                 4.3 years

20 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The mineral resource identified within the Boteti Project is robust and valid, and has 
been established by following best practice principles. The indicated mineral resource 
has been subject to a conceptual study, which has demonstrated a strong business 
case for pursuing the project. Technical and other risks on the project are relatively 
small because of the large amount of information generated on all aspects of the 
mining plan, both as part of the mineral resource development, and also as part of 
other pre-feasibility and feasibility study programmes. Project risks are summarised 
below. 

20.1 Project Risks 

The following project risks were identified and are commented upon. 

20.1.1 Mine Footprint 

The Mining Licence is relatively small, which provides for little flexibility with respect to 
a mine footprint. It is therefore recommended that negotiations commence on acquiring 
adjacent land. 

20.1.2 High Density Portions of the South Lobe 

Portions of the South Lobe contain fresh olivine and consequently the specific gravity 
of the kimberlite is high. Since this fact was recognised early, the mine plan and plant 
specifications have been able to account for it, and the risk is considered low. 

20.1.3 Manpower Accommodation 

The conceptual study considered that the manpower would stay in the town of 
Letlhakane. However, the town has little available empty housing, and it is likely that 
additional housing would be required. One alternative might be to house staff at the 
Orapa township. This issue needs to be addressed, and may create an additional 
capital cost. The results of the financial modeling suggest that the project can absorb 
additional capital costs of this magnitude (Figure 20-1). In addition, a 30% contingency 
was built into the capex figure used for the financial modeling. 

20.1.4 Diamond Price 

The current state of the diamond market is discussed in section 18.1.4.  

The financial model created by PPM and updated by MSA (section 18.2) assumes an 
annual real increase in diamond prices of 1.5% per annum. In the current climate of 



 

 
Boteti Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  105 

global economic recovery, and based on current industry forecasts, this figure appears 
conservative.

20.1.5 Exchange Rates 

Because the costs of the mine are mainly in Botswana Pula and South African Rand, 
and the revenues are in United Stated Dollars, the project is exposed to exchange rate 
risks. The updated financial model created by MSA, and based upon the model created 
by PPM in their conceptual study, uses average exchange rates over the past six 
months. Nevertheless, both currencies have exhibited considerable volatility in the 
past. Figure 20-2 shows the sensitivity of the project to fluctuations in the USD/ South 
African Rand exchange rate. Zero percent is the average exchange rate for the six 
months ending 28th February 2010, -10% indicates a 10% strengthening of the rand, 
and so on.

20.1.6 Power Supply 

PPM report that discussions have been held with BPC, and power supply will be 
provided in time for production. However, power is unlikely to be available during 
implementation. For this reason, diesel generator capacity is being established, which 
would later become a back-up power supply for the mine. 

ESKOM, the parastatal electricity supplier in South Africa, sells some of its production 
to Botswana, and the project is therefore potentially impacted by changes in the power 
supply provided by ESKOM. It was recently announced that electricity price increases 
amounting to 25% per annum for three years will commence during 2010. This has the 
potential to impact on the operating costs for the mine. The financial model indicates 
that the project has potential to operate at significantly higher costs and still make a 
profit (Figure 20-1).

NI 43-101 Technical Report – 25 March 2010  107 

21 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Based on the validated mineral resource, the results of the PPM conceptual study, and 
the updated financial model generated, it is the MSA Group's opinion that the Boteti 
Project has the potential to become a significant diamond producer. No fatal flaws have 
been identified. In light of the extensive studies provided by previous pre-feasibility and 
feasibility study programmes, The MSA Group finds no reason why the project should 
not advance directly to feasibility study level.
