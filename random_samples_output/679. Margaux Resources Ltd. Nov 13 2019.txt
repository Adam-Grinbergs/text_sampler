1 Summary  

1.1 Introduction 

The author prepared this report at the request of Margaux Resources Ltd. ("Margaux"), a junior 

exploration company focused on gold exploration within British Columbia. The company recently 

entered into an agreement with Wildsky Resources Inc. ("Wildsky") to acquire the Cassiar Gold 

Property (the "Property") in northern British Columbia. The purpose of this report is to assess the 

merits of the Property and to provide a mineral resource that conforms to National Instrument 43-

101 specifications to satisfy TSX-V conditions for approval of the transaction. 

1.2 Property Description and Ownership 

The Property is located in northern British Columbia, approximately 75 km south of the BC/Yukon 

border. The Property is located within the traditional territory of the Kaska First Nation. It covers 

approximately 56,000 hectares and comprises 222 mineral claims, 2 placer claims, and 18 crown 

granted mineral claims. The Property contains numerous orogenic (and corresponding placer) gold 

prospects, historical occurrences, and previously mined deposits.  

The Property straddles Highway 37 and entirely encompasses the unincorporated settlement of Jade 

City. The permanent camp facilities for the Project are located on company-owned private land at 

Jade City and are connected to the local power grid. The Property has good road access via historic 

mine and exploration roads to most of the prospective gold areas. 

All claims and property assets are 100% owned by Cassiar Gold Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of 

Wildsky Resources Inc. Margaux Resources Ltd. holds an option from Wildsky to earn a 100% interest 

in the Property and its assets, in exchange for staged share payments of 58,200,000 common shares 

over an 18-month period. Except for 10 claims on which an underlying 2.5% NST exists, the agreement 

is not subject to any royalty interest. 

1.3 Geology and Mineralization 

The Property is located in the Cassiar Mountains, the northern extension of the Omineca Mountain 

Range in northern BC. The mountain ranges of the area were formed via thrustal accretion to the 

ancient North American continental margin during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The bedrock 

on the Property consists of the boundary between sediments deposited on the continental margin, 

and the exotic terranes which were thrust onto the continent. The Property lies within the Sylvester 

Allochthon, a "piece" of the Slide Mountain and Quesnel terranes (exotic terranes) which is thrust 

upon the Cassiar terrane (North American marginal sediments). 

Gold mineralization on the Property is orogenic in nature and is consistent with regional gold 

deposits, which occur along more or less the entire length of the mountain range and is spatially and 

temporally related to the accretionary event described above. High-grade quartz-carbonate veins, 

vein swarms, and/or vein arrays, as well as associated low-grade alteration halos, define the orogenic 

gold found on the Property. The known zones occur along a 15 km long trend with over 700 m in 

vertical extent. Mafic volcanics host the veining, which occurs as shear, thrust-filling, and extensional 

veins. 

1.4 Exploration Status 

The Property has been explored since the 1930s. Over 2,475 drill holes (both surface and 

underground), over 38,000 soil samples, 100s of silt, rock, and trench samples, plus numerous 



6  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

geophysical surveys have been conducted since that time. Exploration since the year 2000 has been 

largely focussed on drilling at Taurus and Table Mountain, and soil sampling at Lucky. 

During the summer of 2019 Margaux Resources ran an exploration program comprised of geological 

mapping and prospecting of both new and known gold prospects. Chip and grab sampling, as well as 

resampling of historical drill core is focussed on expanding the understanding of lower-grade gold 

occurrences on the Property. 

Margaux Resources also had a 2D inversion completed of 3 lines of historical pole-dipole induced 

polarization (IP) work at Taurus. IP is a good exploration tool for identifying large zones of alteration, 

which may host lower-grade mineralization. 

1.5 Development and Operations 

The Property has 7 historic mines located within its boundaries. Historical production is estimated at 

over 800,000 tonnes and over 350,000 oz of gold (see Table 6-2 for details). Previous exploration 

and mining efforts have focussed on high-grade shear and thrust-filling veins, especially in and 

around the Table Mountain area. In total, the Property has 17 portals and over 25 km of underground 

workings. 

The Property is not currently in operation. Several of the historic mine sites require ongoing 

remediation (detailed in 4.6). 

1.6 Mineral Resource Estimates 

Margaux asked the author to estimate a mineral resource on the Taurus deposit. 

The resource was estimated into 38 high-grade "vein" domains and a low-grade "halo" domain, 

intended to best represent the deposit (with current understanding and information) with regards to 

its geology. 

Table 1-1 summarizes the gold mineral resources for the Taurus deposit, effective September 10, 2019. 

Table 1-1 Inferred Resources Estimated for the Taurus Deposit 

Au g/t Cut-off Tonnes Au g/t Au oz 

0.7          21,830,000          1.43      1,005,000  

1.7 Conclusions and Recommendations 

The Property is extensive and will require many years of work to fully evaluate and assess its 

potential. Several opportunities are immediately apparent, including the Table Mountain tailings 

deposit, the Sable bulk sample, and several exploration opportunities, including the Backyard zone 

and Wings Canyon. 

A two-phase work program is recommended. First, over the coming winter season, while the 

Property is inaccessible, an extensive compilation is recommended. Large volumes of digital and 

paper records have been collected, and these need to be sorted and interpreted in order to obtain 

any value contained therein. This is Phase 1 and is estimated to cost between $80,000 and $200,000. 

Phase 1 may turn up enough additional original data sources (log, surveys, and assay certificates) to 

further validate drill programs that this report has deemed historical in nature. Additionally, a 

complete review of the available data will allow a more comprehensive 3D geological model to be 

generated, and may constitute a material difference to the deposit, such that a resource update may 

be possible prior to further drilling. 



7  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

Phase 2 involves following up on the results from the 2019 summer program (results pending), the 

Phase 1 compilation work, as well as previously recommended surface and drilling work. This will 

involve relogging and resampling historical drill core, surface mapping and sampling, and a 5,000 m 

drill program to extend mineralization at Taurus and explore prospects. This Phase is estimated to 

cost between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000.

map sheets 104P/03-06 and on TRIM maps 104P.012-.014, .022-.024 and .032-.033. A general 

location map is included as Figure 4-1.

Hope Lake. The former Cassiar townsite, which was largely relocated and reclaimed after the Cassiar 

asbestos mine closure in 1992, is located 2 km west of the Cassiar Gold Project western boundary. 

There are no parks or protected areas within the limits of the property.  

4.3 Mineral, Placer, and Surface Tenures 

The Property covers approximately 56,110 hectares and comprises 222 mineral claims, 2 placer 

claims, and 18 crown granted mineral claims. Claim details are listed below in Table 4-1. Figure 2 

shows the relationship between mineral claims and zones of known mineralization and 

infrastructure. Details of the Taurus and Table Mountain areas are illustrated on Figure 4-3 and Figure 

4-4, respectively. 

As indicated in Table 4-1, a large number of claims within the property have "Protected Status". 

Protected status on titles is provided under Section 66 of the Mineral Tenure Act, which allows the 

Chief Gold Commissioner to grant an extension for completing assessment work on titles for various 

reasons. The Cassiar Gold tenures were granted protection because of the wildfire activity in 2018 

which prevented the company from accessing the titles to perform the required exploration work. 

The length of the protection order can vary, but in this case, protection has been granted until March 

31, 2020. The protection does not eliminate the need for assessment work during the protection 

period, it merely grants an extension to the time available to complete this work.

* 10 mineral claims with carried 2.5% NSR to Sable Resources Ltd.  

All of the claims and crown grants are held by Cassiar Gold Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of 

Wildsky Resources Inc. Ten claims are subject to a 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) by way of an 

underlying agreement (August 26, 1993) between Sable Resources Ltd. and Hera Resources Ltd. The 

remainder of the property is not subject to any NSR interest (see Table 4-2, Figure 4-2, Figure 4-3).  

There is a long history of placer mining in the Jade City/McDame area and numerous valid placer 

claims and placer leases, owned by third parties, exist within the limits of the Property. The two 

placer claims owned by Cassiar Gold Corp. are located along Quartzrock and Troutline creeks, in the 

vicinity of the Taurus mine, as shown in

Mineral and placer claims within the province of British Columbia require assessment work (such as 

geological mapping, geochemical or geophysical surveys, diamond drilling, reclamation) be 

completed each year to maintain title to the ground. New regulations regarding work obligations to 

maintain tenure came into effect in British Columbia on July 1, 2012. As of that date, annual work 

commitments are determined by a 4-tier structure, as follows:  

• $5.00 per hectare for anniversary years 1 & 2  

• $10.00 per hectare for anniversary years 3 & 4 

• $15.00 per hectare for anniversary years 5 & 6 

• $20.00 per hectare for subsequent anniversary years 

Work in excess of the annual requirement may be credited towards future years. In lieu of 

assessment work, cash payments can be made to maintain title. To encourage exploration work, 

cash-in-lieu-of requirements have been set at two times the requirement for assessment work (i.e. 

$10 per hectare in years 1 and 2, etc.).  

Current expiry dates for the claims comprising the Property are listed in Table 4-1. The vast majority 

of these claims were staked prior to 2011, thus require an annual assessment commitment of 

$20/hectare. The total annual assessment expenditure to advance the expiry dates of all claims on 

the property by one year is $889,500. Under filing regulations, Portable Assessment Credits (PAC) 

which have been accrued from work completed anywhere in the province but are excess to 

assessment obligations at the time of filing, may be used to satisfy up to 30% of the annual 

expenditure requirement. Both Margaux and Wildsky have significant balances in their respective 

PAC accounts, which can be used to supplement future filings on the Property.

without any consultation to the undersurface owner. Conflicts between the occupant and previous 

operators have resulted in numerous issues, including access through the company's locked Taurus 

gate (a requirement of the Mines Act Permit). Margaux has met with the occupant to request that 

the Taurus gate remain locked at all times, and the occupant has agreed to this request.

4.4 Property Agreement 

Margaux Resources Ltd. and Wildsky Resources Inc. entered into an agreement, dated March 25, 

2019, by which Margaux can acquire a 100% interest in the Cassiar Gold Project. Terms of the 

agreement are detailed below.  



28  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

Cassiar Gold Property, including all existing infrastructure, is held by Cassiar Gold Corp., a wholly 

owned subsidiary of Wildsky Resources Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, Margaux has an 

option to acquire a 100% interest in the Cassiar Gold Project by acquisition of all of the common 

shares in the capital of the Cassiar Gold Corp.  

In order to exercise the option, Margaux must issue 58,200,000 common shares in the capital of 

Margaux, issued at a deemed price of $0.08 per share, for aggregate consideration of $4,656,000. 

Margaux must also satisfy certain other conditions as follows: 

• 5,820,000 shares being issued to Wildsky on receipt of final TSX Venture Exchange (the 

"Exchange") approval of the agreement, as fully paid and non-assessable securities; 

• 11,640,000 shares on the date that is the earlier of 6 months from (a) the date of the 

agreement, and (b) the receipt of final Exchange approval of the agreement; 

• 17,460,000 Margaux Shares on the date that is the earlier of 12 months from (a) the date of 

the agreement, and (b) the receipt of final Exchange approval of the agreement; 

• 23,280,000 Margaux Shares on the date that is the earlier of 18 months from (a) the date of 

the agreement, and (b) the receipt of final Exchange approval of the agreement.  

• Margaux will expend at least $400,000 on the planning, development and execution of the 

Cassiar 2019 work program, based on a mutually approved budget; 

• 6 months after execution of the agreement, Wildsky will have the right to appoint one 

member to the board of directors of Margaux; 

• 12 months after execution of the agreement, Wildsky will have the right to appoint an 

additional person (for a total of 2 board members) to the board of directors of Margaux;  

• 12 months after execution of the agreement, Wildsky will have the right to appoint one 

person to the senior management team of Margaux, on terms and conditions to be agreed 

upon by Margaux and Wildsky, acting reasonably; and  

• Wildsky being granted a 30% net profit interest on all minerals processed from the TM-TSF#1 

tailings pond located on the Cassiar property, after capital payout of up to $500,000.  

If, at any time prior to the exercise of the option or the termination of the agreement, Margaux or its 

agent(s) remove material from the tailings pond for purposes other than bona fide exploration and 

testing purposes, and such material is processed for its minerals and/or metals, then the time periods 

set out above shall be accelerated to 7 days from the date of first removal of such material. 

All shares issued to Wildsky in accordance with this agreement shall be subject to a statutory hold 

period of 4 months and a contractual hold period of a further 8 months (for a total of 12 months from 

the date of issuance). If acceleration occurs, then all shares issued to Wildsky, including any shares 

issued prior to acceleration, shall only be subject to the statutory hold period. For greater certainty, 

if any shares have been issued to Wildsky more than 4 months prior to the occurrence of acceleration, 

then those shares shall immediately become "free-trading".  

The transaction has received conditional approval by the TSX Venture Exchange and is subject to final 

approval by the TSX Venture Exchange upon receipt and acceptance of this report. The transaction 

was approved by shareholders of Wildsky at the company's AGM on June 20, 2019. 

4.5 Royalties and Other Agreements 

As mentioned in 4.3, and outlined in Table 4-1, there is one underlying royalty agreement on the 

Property. Ten claims are subject to a 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) by way of an underlying 



29  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

agreement (August 26, 1993) between Sable Resources Ltd. and Hera Resources Ltd. The remainder 

of the claims and grants are not subject to any such agreements. 

The Cassiar Gold Property is situated within the Traditional Territory of the Kaska Dena (Dease River) 

First Nation. There are no Indian Reserves within the limits of the property. An important component 

of the permitting process, and of successful project operation anywhere in Canada, is meaningful 

First Nations engagement. Margaux has initiated engagement with the Dease River First Nation 

(DRFN). Continued access to the project area for hunting and trapping (Margaux is providing this), 

and economic opportunities associated with the project, are among the concerns of the DRFN.  

4.6 Permits 

Permits from the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (MEMPR) are required for any 

exploration or development work that involves mechanized ground disturbance. No such work can 

commence without prior approval. Reclamation bonds are required before final permit approval is 

granted, with bonding commensurate with the amount of disturbance.  

As shown in Figure 4-8 and detailed in Table 4-5, there are 3 valid permits for the Property. All are 

held by Cassiar Gold Corp. Permits M-149 and M-127 are mine permits which cover the areas of 

historic mining and exploration, including tailings storage facilities, in the Taurus and Table Mountain 

areas, respectively. Permit MX-1-655 is an exploration permit for exploration on that portion of the 

property that is located north of Highway 37. Boundaries for M-149 and M-127 were modified by the 

Ministry of Energy and Mines and Petroleum Resources in January 2019. These amended boundaries 

are shown in Figure 4-8.

north of Highway 37. Unreclaimed disturbance = 7.89 hectares. 

A requirement of all permits is that annual reporting be completed, by March 31, to document all 

disturbance and reclamation. For M- permits, Annual Reclamation Reports are required, while for 

MX-permits, a simpler Annual Summary of Exploration Activities is required. The required annual 

reporting for 2018 has been completed for the Cassiar permits (Hunt, 2019a,b).  

Annual Dam Safety Inspections by qualified professional are required for all tailings storage facilities 

within British Columbia. Inspections were completed for the Taurus and Table Mountain tailings sites 

in 2017 but were not done in 2018. Margaux completed the Dam Safety Inspection on Sept 6, 2019, 

which ensures permit compliance. 

Inspections of M-127 and M-149 were completed by MEMPR Mines Inspectors in 2016, 2017, 2018, 

and 2019 (Murphy, 2018a,b, 2017a,b; Przeczek, 2016a,b). Numerous areas of non-compliance were 

noted, of which a significant number remain to be addressed. The highest priority orders are the 

need for Updated Reclamation and Closure Plans and Closure Maintenance Manuals for both 

permits. These documents will detail the outstanding reclamation requirements and provide a plan 

for remediation. Other issues include safety concerning open portals, water quality monitoring, 



30  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

general site clean-up including removal of derelict buildings, fuel tanks, equipment, vehicles, used oil 

etc., recontouring and revegetation of disturbed areas, hydrocarbon spills, core storage, removal of 

the Table Mountain powerline, and several additional items. 

Margaux has engaged Palmer Environmental to manage and oversee a number of the remediation 

orders, including water quality sampling, effective revegetation, bat monitoring, hydrocarbon spill 

mapping, and preparation of the Updated Reclamation and Closure Plans and Closure Maintenance 

Manuals. An initial water quality sampling program was completed May 12-15, 2019 (Crichton, 2019). 

The corresponding low-flow samples were taken on September 11, 2019. Margaux has begun to 

address a number of other outstanding reclamation orders. During the summer of 2019 Margaux 

began a general site clean-up, removing material (via scrap and salvage contractors) and burning 

woody debris throughout the Property, including cleaning up a demolished building at Taurus. Future 

work includes continuing site cleanup, demolition of several buildings, and obtaining a proposal for 

remediation of the Bain portal and subsidence issues. 

Permits can be longstanding documents that cover multiple generations of work on a project, 

however the existence of an active permit alone is not sufficient to allow exploration. An annual or 

multi-year Notice of Work (NOW) must be submitted and approved before any work can be done 

under the permit. 

A 5-year area-based NOW was submitted for MX-1-655 in February 2019, to allow exploration drilling 

under this permit. It was approved by Barry MacCallum, Deputy Forest District Manager/Inspector of 

Mines on July 15, 2019. A 1 year NOW for drilling on M-149 was submitted in June 2019 to allow 

confirmation and infill drilling at the Taurus site; approval is pending. 

4.7 Risks and Other Factors 

The author is not aware of any other specific risks or factors that could affect the claim position, the 

private property ownership, or the permitting of the property.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local 
Resources, Infrastructure, and 
Physiography  

The following section has been reformatted, modified, and where necessary updated from Caron 

(2019). 

5.1 Access 

The Cassiar Gold Property is bisected by Highway 37 and roughly centered on the broad, southwest-

northeast trending McDame Creek valley. The unincorporated community of Jade City is located 

along Highway 37 and is the site of Cassiar Gold's private surface land and permanent camp facility. 

Highway 37 is a paved highway, with year-round access.  

The nearest major communities are Whitehorse, Yukon, approximately 500 km to the northwest via 

Highway 37 and the Alaska Highway, or Smithers, approximately 720 km south via Highways 37 and 

16.  

Commercial air service is available to both Whitehorse and Smithers, while charter flights are 

available to Watson Lake or Dease Lake. Alkan Air from Whitehorse will fly small (Cessna) charter 

flights into the Cassiar airstrip, located immediately west of the property.  

The property measures approximately 30 km from north to south, by 20 km from east to west. It 

extends from Zus Mountain and Long Lake in the north and from Mt. McDame and Cook Lake in the 

west, to the western slopes of Mt. Pendleton in the east and to the Cottonwood and Dease Rivers in 

the south. Access to the property is by Highway 37, by the paved highway to the Cassiar townsite, 

and by a network of historic mining, exploration and hunting roads (totaling approximately 160 km). 

For the most part, roads within the property are in good condition. Most are accessible by 4-wheel 

drive vehicle. Some of the minor roads can only be traveled by ATV until brushing or minor road 

repairs are completed. 

5.2 Topography, Elevation, and Vegetation 

Major drainages on the property include McDame Creek and tributaries that flow into it from the 

north and south, the main ones being Quartzrock, Troutline, Snowy, Erickson and Finlayson Creek. 

Pooley Creek, in the southern part of the property, flows to the south into the Cottonwood River. 

Valley floors are at elevations ranging from 800-1000 m and are typically up to 1 km in width, with 

numerous lakes and swampy areas that are separated by low hills. Two of the more significant lakes 

within the property are McDame Lake and Allan Lake, both located along the McDame Creek valley. 

The property includes several prominent mountains, including Zus Mountain in the northwest, 

Mount McDame in the west, Snow Mountain in the central area, Needlepoint Mountain in the 

southwest, and Black Fox and Juniper Mountain in the southeast. The highest peak on the property 

is Black Fox Mountain, at 2143 m, with numerous other peaks exceeding 2000 m in elevation. 

Overburden is largely glacial outwash (sand and gravel) and varies from a thin veneer at higher 

elevations to deposits of 10 m or more in valley bottoms. There is extremely limited supply of topsoil, 

for any reclamation purposes.  



33  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

The property is located within the Cassiar Ranges EcoSection of the Boreal Mountains and Plateaus 

Ecoregion of the Northern Boreal Mountains EcoProvince of the Sub Arctic Highlands EcoDivision of 

the Polar EcoDomain (Hunt, 2019a). Vegetation is typical of the Spruce-Willow-Birch and Alpine 

Tundra Biogeoclimatic Zones, consisting of jack pine, lodge pole pine, black spruce, and poplar forest, 

thinning to buck brush and alpine meadows above tree line at 1,450 to 1,500 meters. Valley bottoms 

comprise shallow lakes and swamps with thick, stunted growths of pine and spruce and abundant 

willow. Disturbed areas may be in part regrown to alder and willow. 

5.3 Local Infrastructure 

The Property has a long history of exploration, development and mining, including 17 portals (12 of 

which are reclaimed), 25 km of underground workings, a 300 ton per day gravity/flotation mill and 5 

tailings storage facilities. None of the underground workings can be safely accessed at present. 

Details of the underground workings are well illustrated in Cowley (2017). These are not repeated 

here since Margaux's primary focus is the low-grade, bulk-tonnage potential of the property, rather 

than the small high-grade veins that were historically exploited. 

Through most of the Project's history, various parts of the property have been under different 

ownership and different operators. Subsequent consolidation of the property has resulted in a 

duplication of some infrastructure, including multiple historic mill sites and 3 "camps" (the main 

camp at Jade City plus former camps at McDame Lake and at the Taurus site). A consolidation effort 

is badly needed, to centralize facilities and dismantle and remove unnecessary infrastructure. 

Significant salvage opportunities are available from supplies and equipment that are present on site. 

The Jade City camp is an exceptionally well-equipped camp, with grid power, internet, landline 

telephone, potable well water and a recently upgraded septic system. It is suitable for year-round 

accommodation for 20 to 30 persons.  

The main trailer houses the kitchen, dining room, lunchroom, first aid room, supply room, mechanical 

and laundry room, men's and women's bathrooms, small recreation room, entrance/mudroom and 

12-2 person bedrooms. The kitchen and dining facilities are suitable for feeding approximately 10 to 

15 people. A smaller trailer nearby has 4 additional bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, while a second trailer 

has 2 additional rooms that can be used for various purposes. A log house is set up as a field office 

with desks, drafting table etc. It has a bathroom, several storage or bedrooms, and has separate 

internet and phone lines from the camp trailer. A former generator shed on the property is now used 

for tool storage. 

The land on which the camp is located is the site of the former Grizzly restaurant and gas station. Gas 

pumps and in-ground fuel tanks remain in place and require removal. The "restaurant" building is a 

3000 square foot log building with an industrial kitchen and a large dining area which can be used 

when the capacity of the kitchen in the main trailer is exceeded. The building also has a large area 

that is being used to warehouse field supplies and project data, plus a full-size basement for storage. 

An older residence (white house) on the camp property is in poor condition and requires demolition 

and removal.  

Core logging facilities include a large building near the Table Mountain mill site which is equipped 

with logging tables and a separate saw room. Power to the core facility is provided by generator. 

Several fuel tanks, in good condition, are located on site.  

Numerous buildings remain at the Table Mountain mill site, including former office, dry, mechanics 

shop, electrical shop, storage buildings, and mill building. These buildings are in various states of 

disrepair. Many are no longer required and should be dismantled and removed from the site. Several 

Seacan's all also located in this area, which are suitable for long term storage of material or 



34  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

equipment, including sample pulps and rejects. The former "Mine Manager's House" and Hawthorne 

Gold tent camp site nearby on the south side of McDame Lake should also be dismantled and 

removed, as should buildings at the Bain and Cusac portals and at the former Taurus camp site.  

The mill itself is a 300 ton per day gravity/flotation mill which has not been used since 2007. 

Significant maintenance and repair would be required before this could be operational. The three 

tailings storage facilities located nearby are at, or very near, capacity. Two additional tailings storage 

facilities near the former Taurus underground mine are also at capacity. 

Three locked mine gates have been installed to limit public access to areas of historic mining in the 

Table Mountain and Taurus areas. One gate is located at the access road to the historic Taurus camp 

and Sable/Plaza/88 Hill areas. A second gate is located on the company-owned bridge across 

McDame Creek. After crossing the bridge, a third gate prevents access to the Table Mountain mill 

and historic mining areas.  

5.4 Climate 

The climate is characterized by short summers and long, cold winters, with daily mean temperatures 

at Jade City ranging from –20°C in January to +15°C in July. Precipitation averages 750 mm annually, 

with 80% of the total annual precipitation occurring between July and February. Snow typically 

begins in October and continues at higher elevations through April, with accumulations commonly 

exceeding 3 or 4 m. While the valley bottoms are generally snow-free by mid-May, at higher 

elevations snow can last into early July.  

5.5 Local Resources 

Basic supplies and services are available in Watson Lake, Yukon or in Dease Lake, respectively 152 and 

115 km by road from the property. There is a limited pool of local labour. Although some equipment 

and workers may be available from Jade City, Cassiar or Good Hope Lake, the majority of labour and 

equipment will have to be hired from elsewhere. 

Power transmission in BC has been advanced as far north as Tatogga Lake (230 kV substation), about 

100 km by highway south of Dease Lake. Power in the area continues to be provided by private diesel 

generators. 

The area has numerous creeks that have sufficient year-round flow for any exploration or mining 

operation. There is also plenty of space on the Property for development of tailings storage areas, 

waste disposal sites, heap leach pads, and expanded processing facilities. 

5.6 Surface Rights 

As mentioned and detailed in 4.3, the Cassiar Gold Project includes 2 titles to which the surface rights 

are held by Cassiar Gold Corp., and several additional parcels of privately-owned land, owned by 3rd 

parties, are located within the Property. There is also a License of Occupation (LOO) along Quartzrock 

Creek, near the Taurus zone and on claims owned by Cassiar Gold Corp.

6 History  

The following section has been reformatted, modified, and where necessary updated from Caron 

(2019). 

6.1 Ownership and Exploration Summary 

The Cassiar Gold Property is a very large property with a long history of exploration, development 

and production, from the early 1930's to the present. Almost without exception, each program 

returned encouraging results and has continued to show the potential for the property to host 

significant gold mineralization. Ninety Minfile showings and well in excess of 70 individual veins, or 

vein segments, are recognized on the property (see Figure 4-2).  

Much of the historical work was directed at high-grade gold veins, which were exploited primarily by 

underground methods (Main (Erickson), Cusac, Bain, Taurus, Vollaug mines). The potential for near-

surface, low-grade, bulk-tonnage mineralization was first recognized on the property in the mid 

1990's. With changing gold prices, this is an attractive target. Margaux Resources is primarily 

interested in the low-grade, bulk-tonnage potential of the property. 

Through most of this history, portions of the property were under different ownership, with different 

operators and different mill facilities. Subsequent consolidation led to 2 properties, the Taurus 

property to the north of Highway 37, and the Table Mountain property to the south of Highway 37. 

Finally, in 2008, the entire property was consolidated under the ownership of Hawthorne Gold Corp. 

(subsequently China Minerals Mining Corp., then Wildsky Resources Inc.). The history of ownership 

is summarized below in Table 6-1.

Entered into an agreement with Wildsky to acquire a 100% interest in 
Cassiar Gold Corp. 

Much of the historical work was filed for assessment purposes and is described in reports that are 

available on-line. Over 140 individual assessment reports have been filed on the property, 

representing approximately $26 million (2002 dollars) in exploration expenditures. In addition, there 

are a large number of internal company reports that document additional work in portions of the 

property and represent substantial additional exploration and development expenditures. There are 

also 19 technical reports, dating from 1980 to 2017, detailing all or portions of the property. The most 

recent of these reports are Cowley (2017), Pearson and Bakker (2010), Stubens (2009) and Kirkham 

et al (2008), all of which are filed on SEDAR. A list of the more pertinent reports describing the history 

of the project are referenced in 19. 



37  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

For the most part, previous work was completed by experienced persons and appears to conform to 

industry-acceptable standards for the time, however details regarding many of the earlier work 

programs are lacking. Descriptions of sampling and analytical method are often absent and location 

control for historic grids, samples, trenches and early drill holes, particularly on the Taurus site, can 

be poor. Results for more recent exploration work, in particular that since 2008, are generally 

presented in more detail than the earlier work and include appropriate QA/QC protocols.  

In the more recent project history, databases for drill and surface data were compiled. In particular, 

in 2008-2009 and 2012, a concerted effort was made to update and amalgamate the Taurus and 

Table Mountain project databases and to incorporate any missing data using hard copy maps stored 

at the project site (Van Bui, 2009; McKeown et al, 2013). On entering into the agreement with Wildsky 

Resources, Margaux's technical staff reviewed the existing databases, then reviewed assessment and 

internal reports as well as project maps, to ensure that the databases were complete and accurate. 

Significant information was missing from the surface database, which was added. Numerous data 

entry errors were also identified, which were also corrected.  

A detailed history of exploration of the Property is given in Hunt (2019a), Cowley (2017), McKeown 

et al (2013), Kirkham et al (2008) and numerous other reports. The following summary is modified 

from these sources, which should be referenced for further details. An important point regarding 

nomenclature is the use of the name Taurus to describe both the historic underground vein mine, 

and the large zone of bulk-tonnage gold mineralization that is centered west of the historic Taurus 

underground mine, but also includes it. In this report, the areas are distinguished as Taurus mine for 

the historic underground mine, and Taurus zone for the exploration target.  

6.2 Development and Production 

As listed below in Table 6-2, total hard rock gold production from the property is approximately 

350,000 oz, at an average grade of about 11.9 ppm Au. Incomplete historical records make these 

numbers a close approximation only.

In addition to the hard rock gold production, approximately 75,000 ounces of placer gold was 

produced from the property from 1987 to 1988, including a 72-ounce nugget that was once the largest 

ever found within British Columbia. Placer production is not particularly well documented in the 

province and often exceeds reported totals. 



38  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

In total, there are 17 portals (12 of which have been reclaimed) and 25 km of underground workings 

(currently inaccessible) on the Property. Exploration work on the property includes 2,475 drill holes 

(surface and underground), over 38,000 soil samples, 383 silt samples and approximately 700 rock 

and trench samples. There have also been numerous geophysical surveys on the property.  

Further details of the geochemistry, geophysics and drilling are included below in 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5. 

Exploration directed at the historic Table Mountain tailings and the potential for recovering gold from 

the tailings is described in 6.6. 6.7 discusses historical resource estimates on the property. 

6.3 Geochemistry 

6.3.1 Soil Geochemistry 

Over 38,000 soil samples were collected from the Property, over a 38-year period from 1980 to 2018. 

Sampling was done on a larger number of isolated grids by a variety of operators. In many cases, 

location control for the data is poor. The data includes samples analyzed by different labs using 

different analytical techniques with different detection limits. Information regarding sampling 

method is not available for many of the older generations of sampling, and for the most part, QA/QC 

data is lacking for soil samples. More recent samples (2006 and newer) were generally analyzed for 

a multi-element suite, while older soil samples often have gold analyses only, or a very select set of 

elements which includes gold. 

Some grids cover moderate to steep slopes, and some component of down-slope dispersion has no 

doubt taken place. Glacial outwash is common on the property, with thick accumulations of sand and 

gravel in many areas. The spatial distribution of glacial features on the property, and the relationship 

of these to geochemical response, is unknown. It is also important to understand the stacked thrust 

slice geometry on the property and how this impacts surface geochemical response. For example, 

the Table Mountain sediments which overlie the Vollaug vein are poorly mineralized, but good 

exploration potential for veining exists in the footwall of the Table Mountain thrust, creating a blind 

exploration target.  

The focus of exploration in the western portion of the property is well illustrated by Silt Geochemistry 

Almost 400 silt samples have been collected from the Property. As with soils, silt sampling represents 

several generations of sampling by different operators over a number of years. With the exception 

of a program by China Minerals and Mining in 2013, location control and information regarding 

sample and analytical method are poor.  

Gold values from silt samples are plotted on   



39  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

Figure 6-2. The very strong geochemical response in the Pooley Pass/Pete vein area is of particular 

interest, especially because of the favourable structural and stratigraphic setting of the area. This 

area warrants further exploration.

Figure 6-1, which shows gold results from historic soil sampling on the property. One area of 

particular interest is the very strong, very large gold soil (+ multi-element) anomaly to the northwest 

of the Taurus area at the Lucky showing. Additional details for the soil geochemical results in that 

area are discussed in 7.3 of the report.  

Another interesting prospect defined on the basis of soil geochemistry is the Lucky Shot target 

(Minfile 104P 041), just north of Highway 37 in the eastern part of the property. The area is in a similar 

geological setting to the Taurus zone, but on the eastern side of the allochthon. Limited work in this 

area in the 1980's identified a swarm of quartz veins with local elevated gold values.  

6.3.2 Silt Geochemistry 

Almost 400 silt samples have been collected from the Property. As with soils, silt sampling represents 

several generations of sampling by different operators over a number of years. With the exception 

of a program by China Minerals and Mining in 2013, location control and information regarding 

sample and analytical method are poor.  

Gold values from silt samples are plotted on

6.3.3 Rock Geochemistry (including trenching) 

Essentially every historic exploration program on the property has included some component of rock 

sampling. In general, that information has been poorly managed. The surface database for the 

property includes 670 rock samples, for which assay information and sample locations are known. 



44  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

Most of these samples are grab samples from outcrop. Included in these samples are 86 rock samples 

from the Lucky prospect, which were collected by Wildsky Resources in 2018. It needs to be 

emphasized that most of the 2018 rock samples were analyzed by ICP methods only, on a 0.5 g 

sample, so results are not necessarily a good representation of gold grade.  

In addition to the rock samples, 135 chip sample locations and results from the Sable "pit" are well 

documented. Clusters of samples with elevated gold values occur in the Taurus, Lucky and Wings 

Canyon areas, and reflect exploration for widespread, low-grade mineralization in those areas. 

Further discussion of sample results from Taurus, Lucky and Wings Canyon are included in 7.3. 

As expected, rock samples from the Table Mountain portion of the property include scattered high 

gold values, consistent with exploration in this area that targeted high-grade veins. 

6.4 Geophysics 

A property-wide airborne magnetic and VLF survey was flown by CMG Airborne in 2008, for 

Hawthorne Gold. The survey is a detailed survey, with 100 m spaced, NW-oriented lines and is an 

extremely useful aid for geological and structural mapping.  

Also, in 2008, a LiDAR and detailed ortho-imagery survey was flown over the western part of the 

property. The survey spanned the key zones of known mineralization, covered the area from Pooley 

Pass in the south to Lucky in the north. LiDAR provides an accurate topographic surface for 3D 

modelling and resource estimates, as well as being useful as a mapping aid and a way to assess 

historic ground disturbance. 

A number of more local ground-based geophysical surveys were completed on the property in the 

1980's and 1990's. International Taurus contracted Lloyd Geophysics to complete a series of pole-

dipole induced polarization (IP) surveys in the Taurus area between 1988 and 1995 as shown in   



45  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

Figure 6-3. Line and dipole spacing was variable between the different surveys. Subsequent drilling 

showed that the main style of mineralization at Taurus (low-sulfide quartz veins, i.e. T4) is defined by 

zones of low to moderate chargeability and moderate resistivity. Semi-massive to massive fine-

grained pyrite (i.e. T3 type mineralization) has a high chargeability, high resistivity signature. 

Unaltered basalts are defined by zones of low chargeability, while graphitic argillite is represented by 

high chargeability and low resistivity. 

VLF was a low-cost and effective method of identifying near-surface veining on Table Mountain, with 

several discoveries attributed to drill follow-up to VLF conductors. None of the VLF data has been 

captured digitally. Location control of surveys is often poor. 

6.5 Drilling 

In total, 2475 drill holes, totaling almost 275,000 m, were drilled on the Cassiar Gold Property 

between 1937 and 2012. With the exception of sonic drilling to test the Table Mountain tailings 

deposit (described in 6.6 below and not included in the above totals), no drilling has been done on 

the property since 2012.  

The majority of historic drilling targeted high-grade veins in the Table Mountain portion of the 

property, with most of these holes drilled during periods of active mining at the Main, Vollaug, Cusac 

and Bain mines. The vast majority of drilling on the property was diamond drilling (2430 holes 

compared to 46 RC holes). RC drilling was primarily at the Taurus target in 1995-96. Core size has 

varied over the years. Most of the surface drilling is NQ size.  
  



46  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

Figure 6-3 Cassiar Gold Property Induced Polarization, Taurus Area (Caron 2019) 

 

Most of the historic drill core is stored on the property. Generally, core from the late 1990's or more 

recent is in very good condition, stored in core racks with legible metal tags on boxes and with 

samples identified by sample tag. Older drill core is generally in poor to fair condition, with some 

missing box tags, core racks in a state of partial collapse and sample tags missing. Historic core 

security and chain of custody is unknown. All core is now stored behind locked gates, but there are 

no fences to prevent access by persons on foot. 



47  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

Figure 6-4 shows the locations for all the drill holes on the property. Additional details for drilling in 

specific zones of interest are described in 7.3. 

Figure 6-4 Cassiar Gold Property Drill Hole Location Map (Caron 2019) 

 

6.6 Historic Tailings 

Tailings from historic underground mining at Table Mountain were deposited in the 3 separate 

tailings storage facilities (TSF) located near the historic mill site. TSF-1 represents tailings deposited 



48  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

during the earliest phase of mining and milling (1979-1988). As early as 1997, studies were done to 

determine the potential for gold recovery from TSF-1, since the mill was known to have operated at 

sub-optimal conditions during this period (Zhuravlev, 1998). In 2018, Wildsky Resources completed a 

program of drilling and metallurgy to test the viability of tailings reprocessing and gold recovery at 

TSF-1, as recommended by Cowley (2017). The 2018 work program is described by Hunt (2019c) and 

Shi (2019) and is summarized in Wildsky news releases (WSK news releases dated 10-25-2018; 11-08-

2018). 

The 2018 program included 128 sonic drill holes (totaling 512 m), drilled on 25 m centers. Holes were 

drilled from present day surface through the base of the tailings deposit, with continuous 7.6 cm 

diameter tubes of tailings recovered from top to bottom, for each drill hole. Figure 6-5, modified from 

Hunt (2019c) shows the distribution of drill holes, plus tailings thickness and average gold grade. 

Samples were submitted for analytical and metallurgical testing. Analytical results sample ranged 

from 0.51 to 6.67 ppm Au, averaging 1.25 ppm Au. The deposit ranges from 1.2 to 7.0 m in depth, 

averaging 4.0 m in depth.  

Figure 6-5 Table Mountain TSF-1, showing depth and gold grade for 2018 Wildsky drill holes (Caron 2019) 

 

Initial bench-scale metallurgical testing on two 20 kg composite samples of recovered tailings showed 

good gold recovery (up to 72%) using a 3-pass centrifugal gravity concentration. Assay grade for the 

20 kg samples was 0.94 and 1.08 ppm Au, based on multiple 30 g splits. Calculated head grade was 

significantly higher than the assayed grade, at 2.56 and 2.18 ppm Au, indicating the presence of coarse 

gold. The 3-pass gravity concentrate represented a mass pull of 2.3% and graded 64-79.6 ppm Au. 

Subsequent metallurgical testing of a 1.29 tonne sample of the tailings did not reproduce results from 

the bench-scale tests, showing an overall gold recovery of only 33%.

6.7 Historical Resource Estimates 

The Taurus zone hosts a Historical Inferred resource of 1.04 million ounces gold (32.4 million tonnes 

at an average grade of 1.0 ppm gold using a cut-off grade of 0.5 ppm gold). The resource is supported 

by a technical report entitled "Technical Report on the Taurus Project, Liard Mining District, B.C. for 

Cusac Gold Mines Ltd.," dated May 15, 2009, and prepared by Wardrop Engineering Inc. (Stubens, 

2009).

The above Taurus resource estimate has not been verified by Margaux and is considered a 

historical resource estimate. It does not incorporate the results of 85 drill holes completed within 

the resource area in 2009 or 2012. An economic assessment has not been completed on the Taurus 

resource and, as such, it has not been shown to be economically viable.  

A separate 2010 resource estimate for high-grade veins in the Table Mountain area in the southern 

part of the project includes 21,470 tonnes at an average grade of 18.02 ppm gold (Indicated) and 

65,750 tonnes at an average grade of 24.30 ppm gold (Inferred), using a cut-off grade of 3 ppm gold. 

Contained ounces of gold within the Table Mountain resource are 13,650 ounces (Indicated) and 

56,360 ounces (Inferred). The resource is supported by a technical report entitled "Technical Report 

on the Table Mountain Property, Liard Mining District, B.C. for Hawthorne Gold Corp." authored by 

C. Pearson, P. Geo. and F. Bakker, P. Geo. and dated May 18, 2010 (Pearson and Bakker, 2010). 

The above Table Mountain resource estimate has not been verified by Margaux and is considered 

a historical resource estimate. An economic assessment has not been completed on the Table 

Mountain resource and, as such, it has not been shown to be economically viable.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization  

The following section has been reformatted, modified, and where necessary updated from Caron 

(2019). 

7.1 Regional and Local Geology 

The regional geology is well described by Allan et al (2017), Nelson and Bradford (1993), Gordey et al 

(1982) and Gabrielse (1963), among others. The following summary is derived from these sources, to 

which to reader is referred for further details. Figure 7-1, adapted from Allan et al (2017) illustrates 

the regional geological setting of the property. 

Figure 7-1 Terranes of the northeastern Cordillera, showing the location of significant orogenic gold 
districts (from Allan et al, 2017) 

 

The Cassiar Gold Property sits near the boundary between sediments that were deposited off-board 

from the ancestral North American margin, and the exotic rocks which were accreted to the continent 

margin in the Jurassic to Cretaceous. Abundant thrust faulting is related to the accretion event. Thrust 

faults were accompanied by, or alternated with, orogen-parallel, transcurrent dextral faults (i.e. 

Tintina, Cassiar, Ketchika faults). The development of transcurrent faults reflects a change in 



51  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

orientation of regional stresses from compression to transpression (i.e. from zone-normal shortening 

to zone-parallel shearing). 

The property itself occurs within the Sylvester Allochthon, a thrust-imbricated slice of the 

(Mississippian to Triassic) Slide Mountain and (Pennsylvanian to Upper Permian) Quesnel terranes. 

The Sylvester Allochthon is 100 km long by 20 km wide, and has a minimum thickness of 2.5 km. It 

rests on (Neoproterozoic to Early Mississippian) shelf to platformal sediments of North American 

affinity (the Cassiar terrane). As described in 7.2 and 8 of this report, gold mineralization on the 

property is orogenic and is part of an extensive "gold belt" that is spatially and temporally related to 

accretion. 

7.2 Property Geology 

Numerous authors have described the geology of the Cassiar Gold Property in detail, including Allan 

et al (2017), Ball (1997), Harms et al (1989), McKeown et al (2013) and Wells (2003). In addition, at 

least 7 theses (B.Sc., M.Sc. or PhD) detail the geology or mineralization of the portions of the project 

(Ball, 1997; Dussell, 1986; Grant, 1981; Harms, 1989; Hooper, 1984; Sketchley, 1986). The more 

pertinent reports describing the geology and mineralization of the project referenced in 19. Figure 

7-2, derived from the BC Geological Survey digital geology files and from Allan et al (2017), illustrates 

the property geology.  

As described above, the Cassiar Gold Property is situated within the Sylvester Allochthon. Post-

accretion, both the Sylvester Allochthon and the underlying rocks of the Cassiar terrane were 

deformed into a broad, flat-bottomed synclinal basin, the McDame synclinorium. The allochthon 

itself is divided into 3 main thrust-stacked "sheets", with numerous smaller, subsidiary thrusts, and 

is separated from the underlying Cassiar terrane by the basal Sylvester thrust fault. Rocks of the Slide 

Mountain terrane comprise the lower and middle thrust sheets and form the majority of the 

allochthon. Island-arc volcanics belonging to the Quesnel terrane occur only in the uppermost thrust 

sheet, above the Huntergroup thrust.  

Nelson and Bradford (1993) separate the Slide Mountain assemblage into two divisions. The lower 

(Division I) unit forms the basal unit within the allochthon and comprises sediments (argillite, chert, 

sandstone and siltstone), gabbro, diorite and diabase sills. It is exposed along the extreme eastern 

and western boundaries of the allochthon. Rocks of the overlying Division II dominate the allochthon 

and are dominantly massive to pillowed basalt of oceanic affinity, with lesser chert, argillite and 

diabase sills. The structurally overlying late Triassic Table Mountain sediments are also part of 

Division II and are separated from the Division II volcanics by the Table Mountain thrust.  

Slivers of serpentinite (dismembered portions of Division I ultramafic intrusions) are common along 

the major thrust faults. The ultramafics form a discontinuous layer, typically less than 20 m thick. 

Serpentinite has been variably altered to listwanite, as a result of hydrothermal activity associated 

with gold mineralization. A complete gradation exists from unaltered serpentinite to intense silica-

mariposite-pyrite altered listwanite. As a general rule, gold mineralization is spatially associated with 

thicker and more intense zones of listwanite. In the Pooley Pass area, south of the Table Mountain 

summit, ultramafic rocks along the Table Mountain thrust thicken to several hundred metres. 

The 400 km long by 15-20 km wide, Cretaceous-aged Cassiar batholith intrudes the Cassiar terrane 

to the west of the property. Contact metamorphic effects from the Cassiar batholith are prevalent 

but are unrelated to gold mineralization on the project. All of the above rocks are intruded by post-

mineral diabase and lamprophyre dykes and sills.

Figure 7-2 Cassiar Gold Property Geology Map (Caron 2019) legend on following page 

 



53  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 

Two orogen-parallel, transcurrent fault zones are recognized, the Erickson Creek Fault Zone (ECFZ) 

and the Boomerang-Lyla Fault Zone (BLFZ). Movement on these structures is complex. The dominant 

sense of movement is dextral, with a component of east side down movement recognized on the 

ECFZ. While latest movement post-dates gold mineralization, the spatial relationship between the 

fault zones and the gold mineralization suggests that they may be important controls to gold 

mineralization.  



54  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

Bedrock exposure on the property is variable, from less than 5% in the McDame Creek valley, to 

locally as much as 90% in some areas at high elevations. Overburden depth can exceed 20 m within 

the McDame Creek valley. Portions of the property are covered by large talus deposits that obscure 

bedrock.  

7.3 Mineralization 

The Cassiar Gold Property covers an orogenic gold system which extends for 15 km in a northwest-

southeast direction and observed over an elevation range of 700 m. Mineralization is centered on a 

structural block bounded by the orogeny-parallel Erickson Creek Fault zone (ECFZ) and the 

Boomerang-Lyla Fault zone (BLFZ). Numerous authors describe the mineralization in detail, including 

Allan et al (2017), Ball (1997), Dussel (1986), Rhys (2009) and Sketchley (1986). The following 

discussion is summarized from these sources, which should be referenced for further details.  

Mineralization consists primarily of basalt-hosted low-sulfide gold-bearing veins (T4 type 

mineralization in historical property terminology), which have well-defined alteration envelopes of 

quartz-sericite-iron carbonate and pyrite. Shear veins, extensional veins, thrust-filling veins, as well 

as vein arrays and breccia zones all occur, but shear veins are the most economically significant in 

terms of gold mineralization. Coarse gold may be present in any of the vein types and can cause a 

pronounced nugget effect in sampling. A second, less-common type of mineralization consists of 

semi-massive to massive, fine-grained auriferous pyrite (T3 type mineralization), such as at the 

Taurus West zone. T3 mineralization is interpreted as early, replacement-style mineralization.  

Shear veins average 1 to 2 m in width, but locally can blow out to over 10 m wide or be as narrow as 

several centimetres. Shear veins may be massive or banded with seams of quartz, carbonaceous 

material, sulfides or tourmaline. Sulfides consist of pyrite, arsenopyrite, tetrahedrite, sphalerite and 

chalcopyrite in decreasing order of abundance. Early barren shear veins are devoid of sulfides. Shear 

veins are steeply dipping to near-vertical veins. In general, veins in the southern part of the property 

dip to the north, while those in the northern part of the property have steep south dips. In the Taurus 

area, shear veins are west-northwest trending (i.e. Sable pit), while at Table Mountain they are east-

northeast trending.  

Where shear veins approach an overlying thrust contact, they can transition into thrust-filling veins. 

Thrust veins are intimately associated with listwanite. The Vollaug vein, along the Table Mountain 

thrust fault, is the main example of this style of veining. The Vollaug vein is several metres thick and 

can be traced for a strike length of 2.7 km.  

Extensional veins are narrow, steeply dipping veins which are limited in both strike and down-dip 

extent. They both join, splay from and cross-cut shear veins. While extensional veins can be gold-

bearing, grades tend to be lower and more erratic than in shear veins. Because of their limited size 

and extent, extensional veins are generally only viable targets as part of large, low-grade vein 

systems. In the Taurus area (Sable pit) extensional veins are east-northeast trending, while at Table 

Mountain they strike north-northeast. 

Gold mineralization is predominantly hosted by mafic volcanics in the Lower Thrust Sheet, and 

particularly in the immediate footwall of the Table Mountain thrust. In the Table Mountain area, 

veins are well developed near the intersection of the Erickson Creek Fault Zone and the Table 

Mountain thrust fault and a spatial and temporal association between gold mineralization and 

listwanite exists.  

Gold deposition is controlled by a variety of factors, including iron content of the mafic volcanic host 

rocks, rheological contrast between the more brittle mafic volcanics and less brittle sediments, 



55  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

damning of gold-bearing fluids by less permeable Table Mountain sediments and reaction of gold-

bearing fluids with listwanite.  

The main zones of mineralization on the property are shown relative to property boundaries on 

Figure 7-2. Margaux's main focus for exploration is the low-grade, large tonnage zones of 

mineralization and, as such, an emphasis has been placed on this style of mineralization in the 

following discussion. No attempt has been made to describe individual veins on the property. 

7.3.1   Taurus (Sable, 88 Hill, Plaza, Highway, Taurus mine, Taurus West, 88 West) 

The Taurus area is a zone of low-grade gold mineralization in the west-central part of the Cassiar Gold 

Project. As currently defined, the Taurus zone covers a vein swarm and accompanying alteration zone 

within mafic volcanics, that occurs within an area of approximately 2 km east-west by 1 km north-

south. It encompasses the Sable, Plaza, 88 Hill, Taurus West, 88 West, Highway prospects, as well as 

the historic underground Taurus mine. Historic exploration at Taurus includes 467 drill holes, 

significant surface stripping, plus declines in the Sable and Plaza zones and historic underground 

mining at the Taurus mine.  

Gold is associated with a network of coeval shear and extensional veins. Shear veins are northwest-

trending and steeply-dipping and are wider (up to 2 m) and laterally more continuous than 

extensional veins. Extensional veins splay from the shear veins. While they are very widespread, the 

extensional veins are typically < 10 cm in width and are individually highly discontinuous. Coarse gold 

is present in both shear and extensional veins, leading to a strong nugget effect. A second, less-

common type of mineralization consists of semi-massive to massive, fine-grained auriferous pyrite 

(T3 type mineralization), such as at the Taurus West zone. T3 mineralization is interpreted as early, 

replacement-style mineralization.  

Quartz veins have broad iron carbonate (ankerite) alteration halos which are laterally more 

continuous than the veins. Zones of mineralization are generally easier to correlate on the basis of 

alteration, than of the veining itself. As described by McKeown et al (2013): 

"Zones of alteration are generally a symmetrical assemblage of: green, chloritic, unaltered 
basalt on the outside, weakly ankerite altered basalt, moderate to strongly altered basalt 
with ~3% medium-grained pyritohedrons around a core of strongly ankerite-altered basalt 
with 6% pyritohedrons and trace euhedral arsenopyrite centred on a white quartz-
carbonate vein. Quartz veins rarely contain radiating clusters of prismatic, euhedral black 
tourmaline. 

Gold mineralized intervals are characterized by pyrite (typically in pyritohedron form) with 
less common euhedral arsenopyrite within the wall rock adjacent to the vein and less 
commonly, within veins. Gold mineralization is associated with both pyrite and 
arsenopyrite and higher grades typically occur where sulphides are most abundant. Rare 
base metal sulphides such as sphalerite, tetrahedrite and chalcopyrite occur within quartz 
veins and are usually associated with the highest gold grades. Fleck of visible gold are 
common within quartz veins (both extensional and shear) in the highest grade intervals." 

7.3.2 Table Mountain veins 

As described above, the Table Mountain veins include a complex, structurally dismembered set of 

shear and thrust-filling veins within a 5 x 5 km area on the north and south-facing slopes of Table 

Mountain. Historic exploration and mining targeted individual veins, which were mined primarily by 

underground methods. Many high calibre geologists worked on the veins in the Table Mountain area 

in the 1980's and 1990's and the veins are described in detail by numerous authors including 

Sketchley (1986, 2003, 2004), Ball (1997), and Dussel (1986). 



56  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

Underground workings are now inaccessible and the extent of surface disturbance from the historic 

mining operations makes it difficult to see veins in-situ. Given the amount of past work, it is unlikely 

that a major low-grade, large tonnage gold system would have been overlooked. That said, this style 

of mineralization was not the target of historic work. A review of historic literature, drill logs, 

underground and surface mapping is warranted, to look for observations including broad zones of 

alteration or relatively narrow quartz veins or vein swarms that may not have been attractive or 

pursued by earlier operators. 

7.3.3   Lucky 

A strong multi-element (Au-Ag-As-Sb) soil geochemical anomaly has been defined over an 

approximate 1 square km area (the Lucky prospect), approximately 4 km northwest of the Taurus 

zone. The Lucky prospect is located above tree line, at an elevation of approximately 1700 m. Rock 

exposure is good, although some areas are covered by large talus deposits. Numerous quartz veins 

are exposed within an area that exposes strong iron-carbonate altered mafic volcanics and listwanite. 

Veins include both large, barren "bull" quartz veins, as well as low-sulfide quartz veins with 

associated alteration envelopes.  

Wildsky Resources completed a soil geochemical survey over the Lucky prospect in 2018 to confirm 

elevated gold values from historical soil sampling. A total of 1195 soil samples were collected, with a 

20 m sample spacing on 50 m spaced lines. Gold values in soil samples range to the upper detection 

limit of 25 ppm Au, with 49 samples returning over 1 ppm Au and with an average gold grade for all 

1195 samples of 0.23 ppm Au (WSK news release, 2018-11-06). Wildsky also collected 86 rock samples 

from the Lucky area, with numerous samples containing elevated gold, to a maximum of 2.89 ppm 

Au. 

The area is centered on the Boomerang-Lyla fault zone, and on a thrust fault which may be a remnant 

of the Table Mountain thrust. It is a high priority for further exploration, including detailed geological 

mapping and additional rock sampling. 

7.3.4   Wings Canyon 

The Wings Canyon occurrence is located along the Erickson Creek fault zone and 1 km southeast of 

the Taurus (Sable) zone. An impressive zone of intense iron-carbonate altered mafic volcanics with 

up to 15% quartz veining is exposed in both walls of Quartzrock Creek. Alteration and veining are 

exposed for a distance of approximately 650 m in a north-south direction and 185 m in an east-west 

direction (before the zone is lost under cover). Rock sampling by Hawthorne Gold in 2009 and others 

has returned a number of samples with gold values exceeding 1 ppm Au.  

A total of 12 holes have been drilled at the Wings Canyon occurrence, 6 in 2009, and 3 each in 1996 

and 1997. Several of these holes have returned long intervals of elevated gold, including: 

• TA09-037 128.5 m @ 0.56 ppm Au  

• TA09-35 90.6 m @ 0.55 ppm Au 

• T97-135  116.1 m @ 0.37 ppm Au  

• T97-136  131.7 m @ 0.36 ppm Au 

Some previous authors have suggested that although the Wings Canyon occurrence represents a 

major fluid pathway, optimal conditions for gold deposition were not present (no trapping by 

overlying sediments?), therefor overall gold grade is low. In this author's opinion, Wings Canyon 

remains an attractive target due to the size and strength of the alteration, the proximity to the Taurus 



57  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

zone, and the lack of exploration between Wings Canyon and Sable including an untested 

chargeability anomaly.  

7.3.5   Newcoast 

A swarm of veins is located in a 1 x 2 km area within the McDame Creek valley, about 3 km southeast 

of the Taurus area. Individual veins/vein systems include the Oro, No. 1, No. 2, Backyard, Sommerville, 

Lulu, Katie and Backyard on the north side of the McDame Lake, and the Davis, Porcupine and Smile 

veins to the south of McDame Lake. Numerous other unnamed veins are also present. The Taurus II 

and Reo zones to the west may represent a continuation of the Newcoast vein swarm.  

The Newcoast area is bisected by the Erickson Creek fault zone and includes a klippe of Table 

Mountain sediments that are in thrust contact with underlying basalt. Previous drilling in this area 

targeted individual high-grade veins and included only select sampling. As listed below, drill results 

indicate potential low-grade, bulk-tonnage mineralization, although this is not well tested by most of 

the drilling.  

• 95VAN-5: 9.4 m @   3.79 ppm Au 

• 07ORO-01: 20.4 m @  1.72 ppm Au 

• 06TII-16: 28.4 m @  1.04 ppm Au 

• 05BY-01: 137.2 m @  0.91 ppm Au 

• 05SV-07: 108.5 m @  0.32 ppm Au, including 28 m @ 0.77 ppm Au 

Sketchley (2005) concluded that: 

"potential exists in the Taurus II project area to outline gold-bearing vein-alteration 
systems that could be amenable to open pit mining. Emphasis should be place on looking 
for litho-structural features that could have controlled hydrothermal fluid flow resulting 
in the coalescing of swarms of anastomosing gold-bearing vein-alteration zones to form 
areas worthy of additional exploration. The Dribble Creek area is a corridor of exploration 
interest, particularly where the Backyard, Somerville, North Notch, Newcoast and 
Newcoast West areas trend into the Erickson Creek Fault Zone and adjacent parallel 
structures".  

The Newcoast area warrants further study, including geological mapping, rock sampling and 

reviewing historic drill logs and drill core to assess the potential for Taurus-style bulk-tonnage 

mineralization. 

7.3.6   Other Zones of Mineralization 

There are numerous other zones of known mineralization on the Property that warrant further 

exploration for low-grade, bulk-tonnage type gold mineralization. The Rich area, 2.5 km west of the 

Sable zone, at the base of Snow Mountain is a historically rich placer gold area with known veining 

and alteration and with elevated gold in soils and rocks. Very minor drilling was completed here in 

the mid 1980's, which was directed at the potential for high-grade veins and not for low-grade bulk-

tonnage mineralization.  

Another zone of interest is the Pooley Pass region in the southern part of the property. The high gold 

response in silt geochemistry from this area, along with known veining (the Pete vein), the favourable 

geological setting, and the thick listwanite zone along the Table Mountain thrust fault all make this 

area worth assessing for low-grade, bulk-tonnage mineralization. 



58  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

The Lucky Shot target (Minfile 104P 041), just north of Highway 37 in the eastern part of the property 

also warrants further work to explore the potential for low-grade, bulk-tonnage style mineralization. 

Limited work in the 1980's defined a swarm of quartz veins with local elevated gold values. The area 

is in a similar geological setting to the Taurus zone, but on the eastern side of the allochthon. This is 

particularly significant since there has been only minimal exploration in the eastern part of the 

property, despite the large areas of with favourable geological and structural setting.

8 Deposit Types  

The following section has been reformatted, modified, and where necessary updated from Caron 

(2019). 

The significance of orogenic gold deposits is well known. Globally, they account for about 2700 

million ounces, or 30%, of known gold (based on past-production, resources and reserves, to 2014 

(Allan, 2018)). Orogenic gold dominates gold production in Canada, Australia, Africa, Russia and 

China. In Canada, over 80% of gold comes from this style of deposit, with the Abitibi region alone 

contributing over 180 million ounces of gold. In British Columbia, 45% of historic lode gold production 

(to 2002) and almost all the province's historic placer gold production can be attributed to orogenic 

gold mineralization (Schroeter, 2003). 

Orogenic deposits form during regional, continent-building tectonic episodes (as opposed to being 

associated with hydrothermal fluids related to intrusive activity, see Figure 8-1). This style of deposit 

can produce high-grade veins as well as low-grade, bulk-tonnage deposits. Historically, development 

was restricted to high-grade veins. As technology and metal prices have changed, exploration has 

targeted bulk-tonnage mineralization, with many of these deposits coming into production in recent 

years (i.e. Malartic). Numerous excellent publications exist describing various aspects of orogenic 

gold mineralization, including Allan (2018), Dubé and Gosselin (2007) and Goldfarb et al (2001). The 

following discussion is adapted from these and other sources, as listed in 19. 

Figure 8-1 Tectonic Settings for Gold-rich Epigenetic Mineral Deposits (Groves et al. 1998) 

 

Orogenic deposits are attractive for several reasons, including their large size and high gold grades. 

On average, orogenic deposits have higher gold grades than either epithermal or porphyry copper-

gold deposits. If one considers just the largest known gold deposits (i.e. those deposits with greater 

than 150 tonnes of gold (i.e. > 4.375 million ounces gold), orogenic deposits account for more of these 

global giants than any other deposit style. 

Because they are part of a regional deformation event, orogenic deposits tend to occur in clusters or 

districts. Many mature districts with a long and continued history of production are known globally. 

Some better known examples include the Superior Province in Canada (i.e. McIntyre-Hollinger, 

Campbell-Red Lake, Kirkland Lake, Dome, Malartic, Detour Lake etc.), the Guiana Shield in West Africa 

(i.e. Ashanti), Muruntau gold in Central Asia, and the Yilgarn craton and Victoria province in Australia 



60  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

(i.e. Golden Mile, Bendigo). Archean cratons are dominant hosts to orogenic deposits, although 

deposits can be any age as long as favourable tectonic conditions are present.  

Proximity to long-lived crustal-scale faults is an important deposit control, since these faults provided 

the pathways for fluid movement. Deposits are generally associated with second and third order 

structures, within 5 km of the first order fault. Proximity to regional unconformities can also be an 

important control to deposits in some districts.  

Structural controls in orogenic deposits exist at all scales, from crustal and regional scale through 

deposit and micro-scale. Rock mechanics and rock chemistry can both control gold deposition, 

making a variety of host rocks possible. In certain situations, disseminated gold can extend well 

beyond individual structures. The largest deposits tend to have iron traps to drive gold precipitation 

(i.e. mafic volcanic or banded iron formation hosts). Other deposits have purely mechanical controls 

(i.e. quartzite host rock) or purely chemical controls (i.e. carbonaceous sedimentary hosts). Within 

vein systems, ore shoots are controlled by the intersection of structures with more competent or 

more reactive rock units, or by structural traps, such as fold hinges or dilational jogs along shear 

zones.  

Deposits range from relatively simple veins, to complex stockworks and vein arrays and are typically 

hosted by moderate to steeply dipping brittle to ductile shear zones and faults. Individual veins range 

from cm-scale to up to 5 m or more in width, with length and down-dip extent both commonly 

exceeding 1 km. Veins typically have less than 5 to 10% sulfides (dominantly native gold, pyrite, 

pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite) in a gangue of principally quartz and carbonate. Textures are variable, 

depending on depositional environment (extensional versus compressional, see Figure 8-2). Both 

shear and extensional veins can be auriferous, and early pyrite-rich replacement-style mineralization 

occurs in some districts. 

Figure 8-2 Schematic Representation of Orogenic Gold Crustal Environments (Groves et al. 1998) 

 

Alteration is highly dependent on host rocks, but in general, sericite and disseminated sulfides occur 

proximal to veins, while carbonate alteration extends for 10's of metres from veins. Iron carbonate 

alteration is one of the best vectors to mineralization, particularly in mafic volcanic host rocks where 



61  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

it acts as a good visual and mineralogical guide. Ultramafic rocks, where present, are altered to a 

characteristic listwanite assemblage (quartz-carbonate-mariposite), with gold mineralization 

associated with the most intense alteration. Trace element geochemistry (As, Sb, Te) is also a good 

exploration tool, which can extend the geochemical footprint of the deposits.  

Recently it has become more widely understood that orogenic gold mineralization is associated with 

the Cordilleran orogeny, as illustrated in Figure 7-1 (Allan et al, 2017). The northern Cordillera is a 

collage of terranes with fold and thrust architecture, that were accreted onto Laurentian basement 

rocks in the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous. Orogenic gold mineralization forms during the late 

brittle phase of the accretion event, with reactivated regional thrust faults acting as good fluid 

conduits.  

The Eastern Cordilleran Gold Belt is related to initial docking of terranes onto the western continental 

margin of ancestral North American. Margaux's Sheep Creek and Cassiar projects are part of this 

Eastern Cordilleran Gold Belt. The Barkerville (Caribou) district in Central BC, the Klondike district in 

the Yukon, and the Motherlode district in California BC are all part of this same Eastern Cordilleran 

Gold Belt. The Western Cordilleran Gold Belt is a parallel belt that includes orogenic mineralization 

(i.e. Bralorne, Juneau districts) associated with a later accretionary event.

9 Exploration  

In 2019, Margaux Resources had Dias Geophysical digitize and complete 2D inversion of three lines 

of data from the 1995 IP survey at Taurus. Previous IP work has shown that the Taurus deposit lies at 

the eastern end of an east-trending zone of moderate to high chargeability. Similar features are 

noted south of the past-producing Taurus mine and at Wings Canyon. As a test, three lines of IP data 

that were collected in 1995 were successfully digitized and re-processed in 2019 using modern 

software and inversion techniques. Because the reprocessing was successful, the remainder of the 

1995 data will be similarly treated. The intent is to match an improved geological exploration and 

deposit model with improved IP product, to better characterize gold mineralization at Taurus, and to 

use this characterization to aid in assessment of extension and exploration drill targets in and near 

Taurus. 

In the summer of 2019, the Cassiar exploration program comprised geological mapping and 

prospecting of both new and known gold prospects on the Property. Although the Property has an 

extensive exploration history, much of the historical work has targeted high-grade veins, and not 

lower-grade occurrences that may have bulk tonnage potential. To that end, geological mapping, 

chip and grab sampling, as well as resampling of one historical drill hole core, were done on numerous 

prospects in both the Taurus and the Table Mountain areas. Rock samples were simple "grab" 

samples, while chips were taken across veins and alteration areas. All samples were of a prospective 

nature and are non-representative. Results are not available at this time.

Reclamation work was done concurrently with exploration work, including clearing brush from 

accesses and infrastructure, and clean-up and removal of old infrastructure and equipment from sites 

around the Property.  

Compilation and validation of historical data, which started with the acquisition of the property, was 

also continued throughout the summer.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses, and 
Security  

Margaux has not completed any drilling on the Property, and hence has not completed any extensive 

sampling on the Property to date. Any chip and grab sampling Margaux have undertaken has been 

purely prospective in nature. 

11.1 Historical Sampling 

The author has reviewed historic sampling procedures on the Property where information is 

available. As might be expected, sampling procedures have varied historically. In general, the 

procedures and techniques employed seem to have been consistent with industry practices at the 

time completed. Original laboratory certificates and details regarding sample preparation and 

analytical methods are available for most recent samples but records are either partially available or 

not available at all at this time for sampling completed before 2008. Ongoing compilation work may 

succeed in finding and cataloguing older sampling procedures. During the period when the Table 

Mountain mines were producing, an assay lab was located on site at the mill complex. Some of the 

historic assays from this era were analyzed at the on-site lab. 

11.2 Recent Sampling 

Only the most recent drill programs (2008, 2009, 2012) have complete records of QA/QC sampling. 

The work done during these time periods is considered by the author to be in accordance with 

Exploration Best Practices Guidelines. 

The following laboratories were used for either primary assays or check assays during these 

programs: 

• ALS Chemex – ALS Canada Ltd. (ISO 9001 and ISO 17025) 

212 Brooksbank Avenue, North Vancouver, BC, V7J 2C1 

• ALS Chemex – ALS Canada Ltd. (ISO 9001 and ISO 17025) 

2103 Dollarton Hwy, North Vancouver, BC, V7H 0A7 

• Eco Tech Laboratory Ltd. (ISO 9001) 

10041 Dallas Drive, Kamloops, BC, V2C 6T4 

• International Plasma Labs Ltd. (ISO 9001) 

200-11620 Horseshoe Way, Richmond, BC, V7A 4V5 

All these laboratories were independent of the issuer and accredited by ISO as is standard in the 

industry. 

Details regarding sample preparation, analyses and security for those programs are detailed in 

Cowley (2017) and are reproduced here in the remainder of this subsection: 

11.2.1 2008 Drill Program Procedures 

1) Individual core samples submitted for analysis to Eco Tech Laboratory weighed between one 

to five kilograms based on core sample lengths generally between 0.5 to 1.5m in length, 

2) The entire sample was fine crushed to ≥70% passing 2mm (-10 mesh), 



66  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

3) The sample was riffle split and crushed to a minimum 250 grams, 

4) The 250 gram sample was pulverized to ≥95% passing 105 microns (-140 mesh), 

5) A 30 gram representative pulp was collected, leaving behind a 220 gram pulp/reject to be 

stored, 

6) The pulp sample was analyzed for gold by fire assay using (Au2-30) and ICP (MA-ES) lab 

procedures, 

Samples which were observed to host visible gold (VG) were analysed using Screen Metallics assaying 

(Au4-250), in which case, points 5 and 6 in the procedure above would be replaced by: 

1) The resulting –150 mesh fraction is homogenized and two sub-sample portions are fire 

assayed, 

2) All of the resulting +150 mesh material is fire assayed and analyzed using ICP (MA-ES). 

11.2.2 2009 Drill Program Procedures 

1) Individual core samples submitted for analysis to the ALS Canada Lab weighed between one 

to five kilograms based on core sample lengths generally between 0.5 to 1.5m in length, 

2) The entire sample was fine crushed to ≥70% passing 2mm (-10 mesh), 

3) The sample was riffle split and crushed to 250 grams, 

4) The 250 gram sample was pulverized to ≥85% passing 75 microns (-200 mesh), 

5) A 30 gram representative pulp was collected leaving behind a 220 gram pulp/reject to be 

stored, 

6) The pulp sample was analyzed for gold by fire assay using (Au-GRA21) and ICP (ME-ICP41) lab 

procedures. The ICP analysis tested 35 elements. 

Samples which were observed to host visible gold (VG) were analysed by four separate 30 gram fire 

assays, in which case, points 5 and 6 in the procedure above would be replaced by: 

1) Four 30 gram representative pulps split from 250 gram pulp, 

2) The four representative pulps were then individually fire assayed using (Au-GRA21) and ICP 

(MEICP41) the gold results were averaged to determine the gold assay for the sample and 

stored in the database as an averaged value. 

In 2009, check assays were completed by Eco Tech Labs of Kamloops, BC and from a riffle split 250 

gram crushed sample prepared by ALS Chemex of North Vancouver, BC. The procedure was as 

follows: 

1) ALS Chemex crush core and split sample into 3, 250 gram samples and remaining reject was 

stored at ALS Chemex to be later shipped to camp location for more permanent storage, 

2) Two of the three samples followed the above procedure at ALS with the third crushed sample 

being sent to Eco Tech for gold analysis, 

3) The first two samples analyzed as above were reported in the database as the original (9) 

and the Preparation Duplicate (9A), 

4) The third received from Eco Tech for similar analysis, defined as the Check Assay reported to 

the database as sample (9B).

49 rock samples were taken from the Sable trenches in 2009 and sent to ALS. Fine crushing -70% 

<2mm, Split sample with riffle splitter, pulverize split to 85% <75 um, then fire assay gold with Au 30g 

FA ICP-AES Finish. 

11.2.3 2012 Drill Program Procedures 

1) Individual core samples submitted for analysis to the ALS Canada Lab weighed between one 

to five kilograms based on core sample lengths generally between 0.5 to 1.5m in length, 

2) The sample was crushed to 70% less than 2mm, 

3) The sample was riffle split to 1kg split, 

4) The 1,000 gram sample was pulverized to ≥85% passing 75 microns (-200 mesh), 

5) A 30 gram representative pulp was collected leaving behind a 220 gram pulp/reject to be 

6) stored, 

7) The pulp sample was analyzed for gold fire assay and AAS (Au-AA23) and ICP (ME-ICP41) 

8) lab procedures. The ICP analysis tested 35 elements, 

9) Overlimits on gold: 30 gram pulp with fire assay and gravity finish Au-GRA21 if Au-AA23 Au ≥ 

5 ppm; screen metallic assay Au-SCR24 if Au-AA23 Au ≥ 10 ppm on the remaining pulp sample 

from the original 1000g pulverization. 

11.2.4 2008 and 2009 Drill Program QA/QC Procedures 

Standards were inserted at a rate of 1 in 20 samples starting with the 10th sample in 2008, and every 

25th sample ending in 25 in 2009. The value of the Standard was written on the sample tag by the 

logging geologist and then the correct bag of standard material was inserted into a sample bag by 

the core cutter. Standards were purchased from Canadian Resource Labs in Delta, BC. The Standard 

samples consisted of the following grades: 

• CDN-CGS-11 (Low) 0.73g/t Au +/- 0.068g/t Au 

• CDN-CM-2 (Medium) 1.42g/t Au +/- 0.13g/t Au 

• CDN-GS-3D (High) 3.41g/t Au +/- 0.25g/t Au 

A fourth standard was added in the 2009 program with the following grade: 

• CDN-GS-10C (Very High) 9.71g/t Au ± 0.65g/t Au 

Blanks were inserted at a rate of 1 in 20 samples starting with the 16th sample in 2008, and every 26th 

sample starting with the number 1 in 2009. Blanks were purchased from Canadian Resource Labs in 

Delta, BC. The blank sample consisted of the following grade: 

• CDN-BL-4 (Blank) <0.01g/t Au 

Duplicates were collected at a rate of 1 in 20 samples in 2008. Duplicates and check assays were 

collected every 9th and 10th sample in 2009. The duplicates and assay check samples would be 

prepared by the lab but controlled by the logging geologist. The sample designated for duplication 

would be selected by the logging geologist. This sample and sample number would be followed by 

an empty bag with the chronological sample number and a second empty bag with the next 

chronological sample tag for check assaying. These empty bags were received by the lab that had 

instructions to make duplicate and check assay bags from the preceding sample. The lab would split 

the preceding sample and put half in the preceding sample bag with its tag. It would split the second 

of that sample in half once again and place them separately in the empty tagged duplicate and tagged 



68  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

assay check bags for processing. The check assay bag would be sent to the alternate lab for similar 

preparation and analyses. 

Quality assurance and control samples, such as Standards and Blanks showed no discrepancies of any 

concern. High, medium and low Standard assay values correlated well with the expected values, as 

did the blank samples. There was only one value of concern but was only 0.002g/t different from 

two standard deviations of the mean value. Preparation duplicates and check assays were within 

tolerance with only 4 samples showing any kind of major discrepancy. These differences can probably 

be explained by the nugget effect. It should be noted that generally results from ALS Chemex were 

slightly elevated compared to the EcoTech Labs results on the check assaying. 

11.2.5 2012 Drill Program QA/QC Procedures 

The protocol for QA/QC followed during the 2012 drilling program saw the inclusion of analytical 

standards and blanks and core duplicates in the drill core sample stream submitted to the laboratory. 

Duplicate samples were made in the core shack with half the core split again, with the two quarter 

sections placed in separate sample bags for analysis. 

Standard reference materials (SRM) were inserted into the sample stream to test the accuracy of the 

lab's analyses. Five commercially available SRMs were used during the 2012 drill program and are 

listed in the table below with their mean grade and standard deviations established during round 

robin standard certification used for calculating warning and control limits. These SRMs were 

obtained from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Delta, B.C. in 2008 and had been stored in the core 

shack on the property. Warning limits were set at the mean ±2 standard deviations and control limits 

were set at ±3 standard deviations. Any single SRM beyond the upper and lower control limits was 

deemed a failure and consecutive standards on the same certificate exceeding the warning limits 

were also deemed failures. During the 2012 program, standard samples were inserted at a rate of 1 

in 20 samples. None of the standards in the 2012 sample stream failed or fell outside of the warning 

limit of ±2 standard deviations which demonstrates good analytical lab accuracy. 

Table 11-1 2012 Drill Program Standard Reference Material (Cowley 2017) 

Standard Number 
Au Cu 

(g/t) Std. Dev. (g/t) (%) Std. Dev. (%) 

CDN-GS-3D 3.41 0.25   

CDN-GS-10C 9.71 0.65   

CDN-GS-P3C 0.263 0.02   

CDN-CGS-11 0.73 0.068 0.683 0.026 

CDN-GS-2C 2.06 0.15   

Blanks known to be barren of mineralization were inserted into the sample stream in the field to 

determine whether contamination happened after sample collection. During the 2012 program, 

commercially available coarse crushed limestone was used as a blank. Blanks were inserted at a rate 

of 1 in 20 samples. Review of the analytical results for the 2012 blanks indicates that all but one blank 

samples in the core sample stream returned uniformly low values in gold and other elements of 

interest. An investigation into the one anomalous blank sample and the other samples in the same 

20 sample batch was carried out with subsequent assaying. The conclusion was that the 20 sample 

batch with expected standard and duplicates values were repeated. 

Field duplicates comprise the collection and analysis of two separate samples from the same field 

location or core interval, used to measure the reproducibility of sampling, and laboratory and sample 

variation. During the 2012 drilling, core field duplicate samples were sawn in half, then one half was 

sawn into two quarters with one quarter as the primary sample and the other quarter as the field 

duplicate. One half of the original core was archived in the core box. A field duplicate was collected 



69  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

every 80 samples. As expected for a gold deposit characterized by coarse flecks of gold, the field 

duplicates indicated poor precision, especially for higher-grade samples. The error was consistent 

with strongly inhomogeneous distribution of gold – also known as the nugget effect. This effect 

seemed to be minor for lower concentrations of gold. 

Preparation duplicates determine the analytical precision in lab sequence from preparation to 

analysis and is separate from field sampling and handling error. As for field duplicates, these samples 

had their own unique sample number. The lab was instructed to make two pulps from the crushed 

sample and analyze each separately. The duplicate sample tag was inserted into a blank sample bag 

and shipped with the original sample with instructions to prepare a second pulp. During the 2012 

program preparation duplicate samples were completed every 80 samples. As with the field 

duplicates, expected for a gold deposit characterized by coarse flecks of gold in the preparation 

duplicates indicated poor precision, especially for higher-grade samples. The error was consistent 

with strongly inhomogeneous distribution of gold – also known as the nugget effect. This effect 

seemed to be minor for lower concentrations of gold. 

Also, during the 2012 program, re-testing of selective 2009 drill core was undertaken. Three holes 

from 2009, TA09-035, -037 and -038, had been analysed at the onsite assay lab at the mill for gold 

via gravimetrically finished fire assay. The coarse rejects for these 2009 samples (which were 

archived onsite) were re-sampled and sent to ALS in 2012 to test the reproducibility of the in-house 

gravimetric results. The 2012 samples were analyzed with Au-AA23 with no overlimit analyses. The 

re-testing demonstrated a reasonable amount of reproducibility between the 2009 and 2012 assay 

results.

12 Data Verification  

12.1 Data Review and Verification 

Prior to the author's involvement, Margaux's technical team did an extensive review of the data 

available. They identified numerous errors (overlapping downhole intervals, misplotted drill holes 

etc) and corrected them by checking against original core logs, assay certificates and drill core photos. 

Subsequently, the author was delivered the database. Due to the incomplete nature of the 

supporting records for the historical (prior to 2008) database, a Q-Q plot was generated to analyze 

whether those drill holes in the Taurus area which fall into this historical subset are fit for use in the 

current resource estimation. The data was plotted several times using various minimum and 

maximum values. The most representative plot is shown in Figure 12-1. 

Figure 12-1 Q-Q Plot of Recent Au Data vs Historical Au Data at the Taurus Deposit (Minimum 0.5 g/t 
Maximum 27 g/t) 

 

This plot indicates a slight deviation in the historical data from the recent data above 2 g/t. The higher 

grades are subtly underrepresented compared with the recent data set. If this is a consequence of 

geographic distribution of the data or of more selective sampling it is not obvious from an initial 

review by the author, but by no means ruled out as a possibility. This means that, if anything, the 

inclusion of the historical data will slightly decrease the estimated grade in areas where data 

overlaps. 

The correlation coefficient was also calculated between the calculated quantiles, with a result of 

0.999, indicating an extremely strong correlation (near perfect). 

Since the datasets compared favourably and given the geographic distribution of the recent data 

throughout the Taurus area, a thorough validation of the 2009-2012 dataset was undertaken. All 

collar coordinates, downhole survey records, and assay records and results were reviewed. 



71  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

The 2009 data consists of 42 drill holes, containing 186 downhole survey records and 1879 assay 

records. The 2012 data consists of 43 drill holes, containing 216 downhole survey records and 2714 

assay records. Logging for these two programs was completed in an access database-based system, 

with original logs being stored in access (.mdb) format. Additionally, numerous GPS surveys, including 

at least two differential GPS (DGPS) surveys, were completed on the 2009 and 2012 collars, and 

stored in access format (.mdb) or excel format (.xls or .xlsx). Assay certificates are available for the 

two programs in .pdf and .csv formats. 

A full review of these datasets was completed. Overall the database was found to be in excellent 

condition.  

For the collar data, all the coordinates have been re-calculated using software to adjust the elevations 

to the most recent Lidar survey. This has resulted in all the data points no longer exactly matching 

the surveys. Despite this, every single collar except for one matches the original data collected to 

within 5m. The one (TA09-026) discrepancy appears to be a typo made in the original log that was 

corrected in subsequent surveys. This collar was visited and confirmed by handheld GPS during the 

site visit as discussed in 12.2. 

For the downhole survey data, there were 4 errors in 402 records (1.00%) for the depth of reading. 

These may be corrected depths that future compilation work will find documentation of. 0 errors 

were found in dip angle, and 5 errors in 402 records (1.24%) for the bearing angle. All 5 bearing errors 

occur at the collar depth, which means they may have been subsequently corrected, and again, 

future compilation work may find documentation of these corrections. Despite these errors, the 

dataset appears to be sound with regards to downhole surveys. 

For the assay data, all available data was found to match both from-to intervals in the original logs 

and original assay certificates by sample number. There were a couple of instances of differing 

methods to decide between multiple assays (sometimes averaging, sometimes taking only one 

result), but these are immaterial. 15 assays of 4593 records (0.33%) were unable to be verified 

because the supporting assay certificates were not found. These may be discovered by future 

compilation work. 

After this review, the author has determined that both the recent and the historic datasets are 

sufficiently accurate for use in the Taurus resource estimation. The partiality of the historic dataset 

will be a factor in determining the classification of the estimation and is discussed in 14.10.3. 

12.2 Site Visit 

The author visited the Cassiar Gold Property on September 9-11, 2019. The site visit included: 

• A review of selected drill intervals from the Taurus 2009 and 2012 drill programs, 

• A review of core storage areas, 

• A review of Property access, 

• A survey of selected 2009 and 2012 drill collars (and other nearby historical collars), 

• A visit to several exposures displaying relevant geological features, including the Sable Pit, 

88 Hill portal and bulk sample exposure, and the Wings Canyon prospect, 

• A review of current work areas and infrastructure. 

Independent sampling was not completed. The Property has an extensive history including numerous 

NI 43-101 Technical Report reviews. The author has reviewed the verification from Cowley (2017) in 

which a number of independent samples were taken and analyzed, and believes further verification 

is unnecessary in this regard. 



72  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

The core storage area at the Table Mountain logging facility houses what appears to be a substantial 

amount of historical core. A core storage spreadsheet from the Cassiar dataroom indicates that close 

to 1000 holes are stored at Table Mountain, with dozens more recorded to be stored at Taurus. Both 

sites were visited. The storage of the most recent drilling (2008-2012) is excellent, with easy access, 

well organized, and covers to protect from snow. Many of the older racks are suffering from disrepair 

and some have collapsed or are falling over. The core is still intact however, and a concerted effort 

could be made to recover the core if deemed appropriate and/or useful. 

The author selected 5 holes from the 2009 and 2012 drill programs at Taurus for review. These were 

communicated to Margaux one day in advance. All requested intervals were laid out for review. The 

author reviewed these intervals against the drill logs, the deposit geology as described, and the assay 

results. All core has been logged well and matches the original logs. Additional sampling may be 

required to better define the lower-grade mineralization at the deposit. 

After reviewing the core, the collars of the 5 holes were visited for confirmation. All were found and 

accessed easily and confirmed by handheld GPS (Garmin 60Cx). Additionally, 3 other recent collars 

and 3 historic collars were confirmed as they were randomly passed in transit. All collars were found 

to be within the normal instrument error (+/- 10m). Elevations were not reviewed due to the 

unreliability of handheld GPS elevation measurements in topography of this variability. See results in 

Table 12-1.

The access to the Taurus Property is excellent, with most drill pads accessible by 4-wheel drive truck, 

or at least to within 100 m. Geological features were easily viewed and measured at the Sable Pit and 

the 88 Hill exposure. The veins and alteration halos were unmistakable, and strike and dip were easily 

discernible, which confirmed the interpretation outlined in 7.3.1.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical 
Testing  

The following section has been reformatted from Caron (2019). 

Mineral processing information is available for underground mining and on-site milling operations of 

the Table Mountain veins and the Taurus underground vein mine. In both cases, mill feed was low-

sulfide quartz vein material, although at the Taurus mine, some fine-grained, massive pyrite 

mineralization may also have been included. 

The Table Mountain mill operated primarily from 1979-1999. Cowley (2017) provides a detailed 

description of the Table Mountain mill flowchart and performance. The mill is a 300 ton per day 

gravity/flotation mill which produced both gravity and flotation concentrates that were sold offsite. 

Gold recovery for the period 1979-1988 ranged from 88-96%, averaging 93%. The mill remains onsite 

but requires significant work before it could be operable. 

Mineral processing information is also available for the Taurus underground mine. Ore was processed 

in a separate facility from the Table Mountain veins. The Taurus mill was a 155 ton per day 

gravity/flotation mill that operated from 1982-1988. In the latter part of that time, a cyanide circuit 

was added to treat the flotation concentrate on site. The mill has now been removed and the mill 

site reclaimed. Detailed descriptions of the Taurus operation are provided in Cowley (2017) and 

Stubens (2009). Overall gold recovery from the Taurus mill was 77.5%, with about equal amounts of 

gold recovered by the gravity and flotation circuits. On-site cyanidation of the flotation concentrate 

was only able to recover about 75% of the gold contained within the con. 

Considerable metallurgical test work has been completed on material from the Taurus low-grade, 

bulk-tonnage gold zone. Two distinct styles of mineralization occur in this zone. The majority of the 

gold is hosted by low-sulfide quartz veins, which have similar metallurgical characteristics to those 

mined at Table Mountain and at the Taurus underground mine (T4 type mineralization). A smaller 

percentage of the gold is contained in fine-grained, semi-massive to massive pyrite (T3 type 

mineralization). T3 type mineralization is primarily confined to the Taurus West zone.  

Metallurgical test work was done during the period 1987-1996 by a variety of labs including Westcoast 

Mineral Testing (Westcoast), Beattie Consulting, and Hazen Research, as detailed by (Beattie, 1995; 

Dughman, 1996; Westcoast, 1995). Stuben (2009) provides an excellent summary of the Taurus 

metallurgical testing, as follows: 

CYANIDATION RECOVERY – WHOLE ORE LEACH 

Whole ore cyanidation of crushed and milled T4 material to a P80 (80% passing 74 
microns/200 mesh) would be expected to give a gold recovery of about 77%. For T3 
material, the anticipated gold recovery would be about 4%. 

FLOTATION RECOVERY 

The flotation of T4 material into a bulk concentrate would result in an anticipated gold 
recovery of about 95%. For T3 material, the corresponding anticipated gold recovery 
would be about 97%. 

The flotation of gravity concentration tailings of T4 material would result in about 84% of 
the gold being recovered into a bulk sulphide concentrate. No results are available for T3-
type material. 



76  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 

CYANIDATION RECOVERY – FLOTATION CONCENTRATE LEACH 

The extraction of gold by the leaching of the bulk flotation concentrates produced from T4 
material would be about 79%. The extraction of gold from a bulk flotation concentrate of 
T3 material would be about 8%. 

OVERALL RECOVERY – FLOTATION AND CYANIDATION 

The overall recovery of gold from T4 material would be expected to be about 76% using 
flotation and the subsequent cyanidation of the bulk concentrate. The corresponding 
overall recovery of gold from T3 material would be about 7%. 

GRAVITY CONCENTRATION 

The anticipated recovery of gold from T4 material would be expected to be about 40% 
using gravity concentration only. No specific results are available to estimate the recovery 
of gold by gravity concentration for T3 material. 

HEAP LEACH 

No detailed tests were conducted on specifically identified T4 or T3 material. The one 
reported test from Hazen Research gave 25% gold extraction at a particle size of minus 12 
mm, but the origin of the sample is not known. It could possibly be inferred that this was 
a sample from the T4-type material since the extraction of gold from T3 material is 
significantly lower. Other tests conducted at minus 6.73 mm particle size were performed 
by Westcoast Mineral, but no sample identification was done nor were the test details 
given. In this case, the head grades and resulting gold extractions differed significantly. 
The range of gold recoveries reported by Westcoast varied from 24 to 74%.

14 Mineral Resource Estimates  

The following resource estimation was completed by Scott Zelligan, P.Geo, with an effective date of 

September 10, 2019.  

14.1 Data 

Drill hole sample data (.xlsx files, .mdb files, .dm files), wireframes (.dxf, and .dtm files), and contours 

(.dwg and .str files) for this resource estimate were supplied by Margaux, and imported into GEOVIA 

Surpac™ software (version 6.3) and subsequently verified by standard internal Surpac™  processes. These 

.xlsx files contain collar, survey, lithological and assay data collated by Margaux and confirmed by the 

author. Assay data includes diamond drill core and rotary drill chip samples. This estimate includes results 

from 423 drill holes completed on the Project to date. 

Margaux supplied numerous generations of plan and sectional interpretations, wireframes, contours, and 

dozens of reports to assist in modelling the deposit. Where appropriate these were imported and verified 

in Surpac™ software prior to implementation or use in modelling wireframes or incorporation into the 

block model. These include, but are not limited to: 

-  Multiple generations of 3D geological interpretative models 

-  Multiple generations of 3D resource models 

-  Multiple generations of 2D maps and sections 

-  Surface topography (LIDAR) 

-  Overburden topography 

14.2 Interpretation 

14.2.1 Geological Interpretation 

The deposit is a part of an orogenic gold system which extends over 15 km. Mineralization is bound by the 

orogeny-parallel Erickson Creek Fault zone and the Boomerang-Lyla Fault zone. The mineralization is 

primarily basalt-hosted gold-bearing veins with alteration envelopes of quartz-sericite-iron carbonate and 

pyrite, with variable gold. The most economically significant veins for gold mineralization are shear veins. 

These average 1 to 2 m in width, but locally can blow out to over 10 m or shrink to several centimetres. 

Shear veins are steeply dipping to near-vertical. The veins are generally west-northwest trending. Other 

veins can be extensional, thrust filling, or vein arrays and/or breccia zones. Extensional veins are more 

limited in extent but can join, splay, or cross-cut shear veins. 

In order to best represent the deposit geology, 38 "vein" wireframes were used to domain the higher-

grade gold mineralization. In conjunction with this, a grade shell wireframe was employed to constrain 

the lower-grade alteration-hosted gold mineralization. 

14.2.2 Wireframing 

Several generations of "vein" wireframes have been created by numerous proponents over the last 15 

years at Taurus. The author has reviewed these and chosen those higher-grade wireframes that seem to 

best represent both the geological interpretation and the grade distribution in the drill hole data. These 

wireframes do not represent all the higher-grade veins, just the ones possible to interpret with the existing 

data set.

The lower-grade alteration-hosted gold has been constrained by generating a grade shell (nominally a 0.5 

g/t Au shell, altered selectively to remove anomalous shapes or remote/stranded volumes). 

The "base contact" model was generated by combining three models: the contact between the upper 

basalt (host lithology) unit and the lower chert unit; the decline fault to the east (which doesn't completely 

cut the mineralization but instead drops the basalt-chert contact to the east); the west fault, which 

nominally cuts the mineralization to the west. No blocks were estimated "below" this wireframe model. 

An overburden model was provided by Margaux. No blocks were estimated above the modeled 

overburden contact.

"grade shell" model, transparent grey – "base contact" model): A – Looking North; B – Looking West; 
C – Plan View 

 
 

To test the validity of these models, and to determine the ideal method for treating the wireframe 
boundaries, contact profiles were generated, and are discussed in the next sub-section. 

14.2.3 Contact Profiles 

Contact profiles were generated to test the validity of the wireframe models and to determine the ideal 

method for treating wireframe boundaries. Contact plots were developed between the samples within 

the higher-grade "vein" wireframes and the external low-grade and waste material. 

The boundaries for the "vein" wireframes appear to be mostly hard with the surrounding low-grade 

alteration halos and the unmineralized host rock. Several of the "vein" boundaries are not as clear-cut;

this is likely due to the low number of samples in these volumes, combined with some uncaptured high-

grade material remaining in the low-grade data set. This also probably belies the nuggety nature of both 

the higher-grade and lower-grade mineralization.

14.3 Exploratory Data Analysis 

14.3.1 Raw Data Assays and Statistics 

The uncomposited, uncapped data set contains 26308 intervals. Any intervals that were unassayed were 

set to 0 g/t Au. 

Summary statistics for the raw assay data for each different constrained domain is shown in Table 14-1. 

14.4 Compositing 

Assay results from drilling were composited to 1.5 m, as the majority of samples were 1.5 m. There were 

also many samples at 2 m length. Choosing 1.5m therefore resulted in the least amount of unnecessary 

sample blending. 

Rather than force samples to exactly 1.5 m, the compositing process approximated as closely to 1.5 m as 

possible within each drill hole interval without excluding any samples. 

Due to the nature of the contact boundary, the mineralized zone was composited separately from the 

lower grade and barren host-rock. 

Compositing resulted in 32053 intervals. This is more than the uncomposited due to the low-grade interval 

containing a number of unsampled intervals. These are all set to 0, and compositing lends them the 

correct sample weight so that these areas are not going to be improperly estimated.

14.5 Outlier Management and Capping Strategy 

14.5.1 High-grade 

Au grades were capped at 27 g/t (after compositing) in the high-grade domains, based on the 

histogram/probability plot analysis and decile analysis. This resulted in the capping of 12 samples and 6% 

of the total metal content.

14.5.2 Low-grade 

Au grades were capped at 7 g/t (after compositing) in the low-grade domains, based on the 

histogram/probability plot analysis and decile analysis. This resulted in the capping of 104 samples and 

11% of the total metal content.

14.6 Density 

A density of 2.65 t/m3 was chosen for the tonnage estimate. Dry bulk density studies have not been 

performed on the results to date. The value of 2.65 was chosen by reviewing similar deposits in the area 

and choosing a conservative value. 

14.7 Previously Extracted Material 

Historical reports indicate that previous mining of the deposit has extracted 220,000 t of material grading 

5.14 g/t Au. Mining operations were not able to be recreated in 3D, so the estimate results were depleted 

by this amount. 

14.8 Interpolation Plan 

Inverse-distance-cubed (ID3) was chosen as the interpolation method. Variography was performed using 

various parameters and sample selections, however, the results were unsatisfactory. Drill hole spacing 

was generally in a decent pattern (not necessarily a strict grid, but not too clustered) which lends itself 

nicely to a more accurate and precise ID3 estimation. ID3 was chosen over ID2 after both were tested 

iteratively, as the heavier weighting of closer samples better reflected the grade distribution in the sample 

data. 

Due to the geometry of the deposit and the nature of the grade distribution, as discussed in 14.2, the 

estimation was constrained using 38 wireframe volumes to represent the higher-grade "vein" 

mineralization, and an approximate (and edited) 0.5 g/t Au grade shell to constrain the lower-grade 

alteration halo mineralization. The higher-grade "veins" were estimated using only samples captured 

within the individual domains. The lower-grade "grade shell" volume is used only to restrict which blocks 

are estimated, not which samples are used to estimate the lower-grade volume. This volume is estimated 

excluding any samples within the higher-grade "vein" domains but using all the "waste" samples outside 

of the "grade shell" volume. This best represents the sample data. The estimation parameters are 

discussed in 14.9. 

14.9 Block Model Parameters 

The Block Model was created with parent cells of 10 x 10 x 10 m, and a minimum sub-cell size of 0.625 x 

0.625 x 0.625 m. Seventy-eight (78) interpolations were performed to populate the final grades into the 

block model. Both the blocks in the low-grade domain and the higher-grade "vein" domains were 

estimated using two search ellipses, each with a smaller search ellipse to estimate the best-informed 

blocks, and then a larger search ellipse to fill out those with wider spacing between samples. Table 14-4 

and Table 14-5 display the search parameters and estimation parameters used in the estimation. 

No anisotropy was applied to the estimations. The high-grade domains, being fairly narrow, did not 

require an anisotropy to orient the search ellipses. The low-grade domain had too many differing trends 

to properly capture using a single (or even a regional) anisotropy.

14.10.3 Resource Categorization 

Mineral resource classification is the application of Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories, in order 

of decreasing geological confidence, to the resource block model. These are CIM definition standards 

(adopted by the CIM Council on May 10, 2014) for reporting on mineral resources and reserves, which are 

incorporated, by reference, in NI 43-101. 

 



89  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

As per CIM (2014): 

Measured Resource 

A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient 

to allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final 
evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 

Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of 

observation. 

Indicated Resource 

An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence 
to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and 

evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 

Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling 
and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between 

points of observation. 

Inferred Resource 

An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade 
or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological 

evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. 

These categories are applied in consideration of, but not limited to, drill and sample spacing, QAQC, 

deposit-type and mineralization continuity, and/or prior mining experience. With respect to resource 

classification of the Taurus deposit, due to the nature and spacing of the drill holes, as well as the 

uncertainty in some of the sample data, all of this estimation has been classified as inferred. 

14.11 Model Validation 

14.11.1 Statistics 

As in all estimates the grade average between the estimate and the originating samples has lowered. 

This is common in part because sampling is inevitably clustered around high grade areas, creating a bias 

in the input which is rectified geometrically in the estimation process. Capping also plays a role in this 

effect.

14.11.2 Population Distribution 

Histograms are used to determine whether the population distribution has been accurately maintained 

in the estimation process. This ensures that the data has not been unnecessarily smoothed.  

Histograms were reviewed for all zones, low-grade only, and high-grade only. The population distributions 

compare favourably, with the normal reduction of the mean and shifting of the population to slightly 

lower grades.

14.11.3 Sections and Plans 

Sections and Plans confirm the correlation between drill results and estimated grades. Continuity seems 

logical and there are no glaring mismatches between drill hole grades and block model grades. The only 

obvious deviations from the sample data in the estimate are in unmodeled high-grade zones, and 

therefore represent the conservative nature of the estimation.

14.11.4 Trend Analysis 

Geographic trends are validated using swath plots. This can identify over-smoothing as well as high grade 

over-spreading. In this instance, the swath plots confirm the correlation between drill hole assays and 

estimated grades in all directions. The estimated grades track well in all directions with the sample data. 

There is a slight discrepancy in the upper parts of the model; this is common at the margins of the data

14.12 Mineral Resource Tabulation 

The Taurus mineral resource is tabulated at Au (g/t) cut-offs. A cut-off of 0.7 g/t was chosen based on the 

results of metallurgical and rock-sorting studies as well as the mining work described elsewhere in this 

report.

Table 14-11 displays the grade-tonnage summary by Au (g/t) cut-off for the inferred resources of the Taurus 

deposit. Additional cut-offs are displayed to show the sensitivity to higher cut-offs.

15 Adjacent Properties  

The following section has been reformatted from Caron (2019). 

The area encompassing the Cassiar Gold Project has seen considerable exploration for a variety of 

commodities and deposit styles, as shown in   



103  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

Figure 15-1 and detailed below. The following information is summarized from publicly disclosed 

information, from company websites and from BC Minfile. It has not been independently verified by the 

author. The reader is cautioned that this information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on 

the Cassiar Gold Property.  

15.1 Cassiar Asbestos Mine - Minfile 104P 005 

The Cassiar Asbestos mine, in operation from 1952 until 1992, is located on McDame Mountain, 1.5 km 

northwest of the western portion of the Cassiar Gold Property. The Cassiar townsite, a company- town 

that once housed up to 1500 people, has been largely dismantled and moved although several private 

residences are still present. 

The asbestos deposit is situated along or close to the basal serpentinite-bearing thrust fault which forms 

the boundary between the Sylvester Allochthon and the underlying rocks of the Cassiar terrane. The 

deposit is crescent shaped, with dimensions of approximately 600x150x150m, and dips at about 45o to 

the east, parallel to the trend of the thrust fault. It was mined by open pit methods and milled at a rate of 

500 tpd in a mill onsite. 

Total production from the mine is approximately 2.7 million tonnes of asbestos that was recovered from 

25 million tonnes of ore. Grades were approximately 10% cross-fibre chrysotile asbestos, with fibres 

reaching lengths of up to 3 m.  

Various operators have investigated the potential for subsequent asbestos production from low-grade 

stockpiles or from reprocessing historic tailings. The potential for magnesium recovery from serpentinite 

tailings has also been explored.  

Imbricate slivers of dolomite between the serpentinite-bearing thrust faults, and proximity to the Cassiar 

batholith, have resulted in conditions favourable for nephrite jade formation. In the late 1990's, 

approximately 50 tonnes of jade were recovered from the Cassiar asbestos tailings. The property is now 

owned and operated by Cassiar Jade Contracting, who continues to mine jade from the site. 

15.2 Mt. Haskin Molybdenum Porphyry & Lead-Zinc Skarn Property - Minfile 104P 020 

The Mt. Haskins occurrence is located along the eastern limb of the McDame synclinorium, northeast of 

the Cassiar Gold Property, immediately north of the Haskins-Reed property. The property is currently 

owned by Velocity Minerals Ltd. 

Structurally controlled garnet-pyrrhotite skarn occurs proximal to the intrusion of Eocene granite into 

Lower Cambrian Atan Group carbonates. The skarn is mineralized with sphalerite and lesser chalcopyrite 

and galena. Tin and tungsten values are also reported from the skarn zone. A drill intercept of 9% Zn, 4.5% 

Pb and 67.2 ppm Ag over 3.6 m is reported from the skarn zone. 

Nearby, porphyry-type molybdenum mineralization occurs within the Mt. Haskins granite. Drilling was 

completed by Della Mines in 1969 and by Velocity in 2008, leading to a 2009 Inferred resource of 13.8 

million tonnes grading 0.0888% Mo, using a cut-off grade of 0.03% Mo (Ostensoe and Boyer, 2009).

Figure 15-1 Cassiar Gold Property Adjacent Property Map (Caron 2019) 

  

15.3 Cassiar Molybdenum Property - Minfile 104P 035 

The Cassiar Moly prospect, 5 km west of the Cassiar Gold Property, is also owned by Velocity Minerals. 

Porphyry-style molybdenum mineralization occurs within a quartz monzonite phase of the Cassiar 

batholith. There has been minimal modern exploration on the property. The mineralization is reportedly 



105  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

well exposed on surface, and has been traced to a depth of over 450 m. In the late 1960's, over 1000 m 

of underground workings were developed to test the mineralization at depth beneath surface showings. 

In 1979, Cassiar Asbestos optioned the property and completed geological mapping and diamond drilling 

(Ostensoe and Boyer, 2009).  

15.4 Storie Molybdenum Property - Minfile 104P 069 

The Storie molybdenum prospect is located about 5 km west of the Cassiar Gold Property and adjoins the 

Cassiar Asbestos, Cassiar Gold and Cassiar Moly properties. It is the most advanced of the molybdenum 

occurrences in the area and is owned by BC Moly Ltd. (formerly Columbia Yukon Explorations). 

The geology of the property is similar to the Cassiar Moly property, with porphyry-style molybdenum 

mineralization within a phase of the Cassiar batholith. Mineralization is concentrated along intrusive 

contacts and has been traced over an area of 1000x500x100m.  

Significant exploration was completed at Storie Moly property from 1959–1980 by various companies 

including Kennco Explorations, Casmo Mining, Coast Silver Mines, Levana Explorations, and Shell Canada 

(Bloomer, 1981). In 2006, Columbia Yukon Explorations acquired the property, completed additional 

drilling, estimated a maiden Inferred resource, and initiated baseline environmental studies.  

Additional drilling in 2007 and 2008 led to an updated resource of 139.8 million tonnes grading 0.064% 

Mo (Measured and Indicated) and an additional 58.4 million tonnes grading 0.059% Mo (Inferred), both 

using a cut-off grade of 0.03% Mo (Kuehnbaum et al, 2009). 

15.5 Haskins-Reed Polymetallic Property - Minfile 104P 021, 038, 043 

The Haskins-Reed property of Pacific Bay Minerals adjoins the Cassiar Gold Project to the northeast and 

the Mt. Haskins project to the south. The geology and mineralization are similar to that at Mt. Haskins. 

The property is underlain by rocks of the Cassiar terrane, along the east limb of the McDame synclinorium. 

Intermittent exploration from the late 1930's to present has identified numerous zones of mineralization, 

including polymetallic veins and lead-zinc skarn. Tungsten-molybdenum skarn also occurs, as well as 

showings of porphyry-style molybdenum mineralization.  

15.6 Lang Creek Massive Sulfide - Minfile 104P 005 

The Lang Creek Cyprus-type volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) occurrence, situated on claims owned by 

prospector Robert Hamel, is located adjacent to the western central portion of the Cassiar Gold Property. 

Mineralization is hosted within the lower volcanic unit of the Sylvester Allochthon and consists of a 

shallow-dipping, conformable lense of massive pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite, up to 2 m 

thick. The massive sulfide lense occurs within interbedded cherty argillite and greenstone. 

There has been only limited exploration at the Lang Creek occurrence. In the late 1950's, Cominco 

completed an airborne EM survey and minor drilling, outlining a 1 m thick zone of mineralization grading 

1.52% Cu and 0.9% Zn. Ground geophysics (mag, EM) in the mid 1960's by Crown Point Exploration Ltd. 

delineated the Cominco zone on-strike and outlined several additional conductors. Further geophysics 

was also completed in 1979-80 by Shell Canada, as part of a larger project that was primarily focussed on 

the skarn mineralization in the carbonate rocks of the Cassiar terrane and on porphyry mineralization 

within the Cassiar batholith (i.e. Storie Moly occurrence), rather than the VMS potential of the Sylvester 

Allochthon (Bloomer, 1980, 1981) 

Other evidence for VMS potential within the Sylvester Allochthon includes a small lense of laminated 

massive chalcopyrite, pyrite and sphalerite exposed in the east wall of the Cassiar asbestos pit (Minfile 

104P 114). As with the Lang Creek occurrence, the massive sulfide mineralization is hosted within 

interbedded tuff and argillite belonging to the lower volcanic unit of the Sylvester Allochthon. Additional 



106  

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

evidence for VMS potential includes the rhodonite horizon at the Snowy Creek rhodonite occurrence 

(Minfile 104P 067) on Margaux's Cassiar Gold Property. There has been no significant effort to explore the 

VMS potential of the Sylvester Allochthon, although evidence for such mineralization exists.

17 Interpretation and Conclusions  

The Cassiar Gold Property is a project in northern BC with a large land package and considerable history 

and opportunity. The Property has good infrastructure including road access, grid power, and a 

permanent camp in good operating condition. The land package is extensive and will require many years 

of work to fully evaluate and assess its full potential. 

The Property hosts both high-grade and low-grade gold mineralization, occuring along a 15 km long trend. 

The mineralization is hosted within mafic volcanics and is usually associated with regional and property-

scale thrust faults, dextral faults, and zones of listwanite. 

17.1 Mineral Resource Estimate 

Margaux asked the author to estimate a mineral resource on the Taurus deposit. 

The resource was estimated into 38 high-grade "vein" domains and a low-grade "halo" domain, intended 

to best represent the deposit (with current understanding and information) with regards to its geology. 

Table 17-1 summarizes the gold mineral resources for the Taurus deposit, effective September 10, 2019.

17.2 Other Conclusions 

One of the tailings deposits on the Property (TM-TFS-1) from the Table Mountain mine, is a good prospect 

for gold recovery. Discrepancies were discovered between bench-scale and bulk metallurgical testing 

completed in 2018 on the tailings and should be resolved in order to properly assess the viability of the 

tailings for economic reprocessing. 

A 5,500 tonne bulk sample was extracted from the Sable area and stockpiled at the mill site. Sampling 

should be conducted in order to understand the potential for processing and recovery. 

The Property has multiple issues relating to historic mining and exploration that require ongoing attention 

and/or remediation. Margaux has shown a pro-active approach to these issues, which should continue 

with all future work programs.

18 Recommendations  

18.1 Phase 1 

Due to the volume of available documentation, the most pressing recommendation at the Cassiar Gold 

Project is an extensive compilation and review of existing data, before further data is collected. 

This work should be completed between October 2019 and May 2020, to take advantage of the winter 

season at the Property. It is estimated to cost roughly $80,000 to $200,000, depending on the detail and 

the number of personnel contracted. Phase 2 is not contingent on specific results from Phase 1, but targets 

should be generated that feed into Phase 2. 

Phase 1 may turn up enough additional original data sources (log, surveys, and assay certificates) to further 

validate drill programs that this report has deemed historical in nature. Additionally, a complete review 

of the available data will allow a more comprehensive 3D geological model to be generated, and may 

constitute a material difference to the deposit, such that a resource update may be possible prior to 

further drilling. 

18.2 Phase 2 

Following up on the 2019 work and Phase 1, the 2020 work program should include focused surface work 

and drilling to follow up Margaux results from the 2019 field season, as well as targets built upon the 

compilation review in Phase 1. A valuable component of the program will likely be relogging and additional 

sampling of historical drill core. The 2020 program should include extension drilling at Taurus, and 

exploration drilling at similar prospects, such as the Backyard zone and Wings Canyon, and at other targets 

on the property which are being developed. Reclamation work on the property should be continued in 

2020. 

These recommendations can be accomplished (or at least begun) with a 5,000 m drill program. All-in 

drilling costs in the region are in the $160-$200/m range, and with additional funds for resampling and 

surface geological mapping/sampling, this program will cost between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. 

18.3 Additional Recommendations 

The following are also suggested for future drill campaigns in the Taurus area: 

• Magnetic susceptibility measurements should be collected on all future drilling campaigns. 

Alteration that accompanies the gold mineralization is magnetite-destructive and so should be 

easily detected with this method. Additionally, a systematic scanning should be completed on 

core from 2009 and 2012 programs in the Taurus area. 

• Due to the magnetic host rocks, future drilling should employ a north-seeking Gyro for downhole 

surveys. 

• Consistent logging of quartz, pyrite, and alteration. 

• Where possible, HQ drilling should be employed to reduce the nugget effect on sampling. 

• Oriented core should be used, at least selectively, in order to verify the orientation and continuity 

of mineralized zones. 

The Table Mountain area should be assessed for the potential of low-grade, bulk-tonnage mineralization. 

Preliminary work should focus on compiling and assessing historical information for pervasive alteration.

20 Abbreviations and Units of 
Measurement  

Historical exploration and mining data in British Columbia is typically documented in the Imperial system, 

with units of length expressed in feet and inches, mass in short tons, and precious metal grade in ounces 

per short ton. More recent exploration and mining data is generally expressed in metric units, with length 

as metres or centimetres, mass in metric tonnes and precious metal grades in grams per tonne (g/t), or in 

parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb). 

All costs are expressed in Canadian dollars. All UTM positions referenced in this report and on its 

accompanying figures are referenced to the 1983 North American Datum (NAD 83), Zone 9.
