1.0  SUMMARY 

The Monitor Mine Cu-Au (Ag) property comprises a package of twenty (20) unpatented claim 
units that total 401.56 acres in area.  On the 5th of February 2013 Archean Star Resources Inc. 
(ASR) signed an Option and Joint Venture Agreement (Appendix A) with Northern Adventures 
LLC (NALLC) and the American Cordillera Mining Corporation (AMCOR).  On completion of the 
terms of this agreement ASR will earn an 80% ownership in the property.  NALLC, under the 
chairmanship of prospector Mr. Martin Clemets, is the original owner of the claims while 
AMCOR holds the mining lease.  

The claims are located in Shoshone County in the eastern part of Idaho's Coeur d'Alene Mining 
District, close to the Idaho-Montana state borders (Figure 1).  They lie at UTM 607900-5244900 
(NAD83 datum), approximately 140 km east of Spokane, Washington, 36 km north-west of 
Osburn, Idaho and 25 km east-southeast of Wallace, Idaho. 

The property is road accessible (Photo 1). From Spokane, access can be made by heading east 
on Interstate Highway 90 towards the Coeur d'Alene Mining District, passing by the mining 
towns of Wallace, Kellogg and Osburn.  Approximately 99 miles from Spokane, Highway 90 
crosses Lookout Pass and enters Montana.  Six miles further on, a turnoff is taken at Exit 5 
which leads southeasterly on the Rainy River Road and Forest Service Road No. 506.  
Approximately four miles from Exit 5, another turnoff is made along Forest Service Road No. 
1187 (Photo 1).  After a further six mile-long drive the Monitor Property is then reached.   

Details of the twenty claim units, which are all valid until the 30th of August 2013, are listed 
below.

TOTAL SIZE OF THE MONITOR CLAIM BLOCK = 401.56 acres 
 
The claim block lies in an area of relatively steep and rugged tree-covered terrane on the high 
western slopes of the Bitterroot Mountains.  It is situated within the North Fork St. Joe River 
watershed close to the headwaters of Mineral Creek at an elevation between 5500 and 6100 
feet asl (Figure 2).  The area is covered with extensive conifer forest (Photos 1 and 2).  It has a 
cold, moist climate in winter and warm, dryer conditions in summer.  At somewhat lower 
elevations in the district, the US Weather Bureau records monthly daily mean temperatures for 
January of 28.4 °F (−2.0 °C) and 69.2 °F (20.7 °C) for August.  Snowfall averages 46 inches 
(117 cm) per year.  All parts of the property are accessible by foot and there are several historic 
mining and logging roads that can be driven by 4-wheel-drive vehicles.  Many of the deep 
valleys have permanent flowing water. 

The Coeur d'Alene district has had more than one hundred years of underground mining 
(Ransome and Calkins, 1908), which continues to this day (Hobbs et al., 1965; Bennett, 2006).  
It is famed for its mesothermal silver-lead-zinc-(copper) vein deposits and has been one of the 
primary silver producing areas in the world.  Consequently, it has an extensive mining and 
prospecting culture and is a source of experienced contract labor and mining equipment.  

There are at least two known sulfide-rich structures on the property: the Monitor and Richmond 
veins, which reportedly reach up to 15 feet in thickness and are known to extend to a depth of 
700 feet.  The Monitor Vein strikes ESE, sub-parallel to the main trend of all the major brittle 
structures in the district while historic documents report that the Richmond Vein had a south-
west to WSW strike.  Both veins contain chalcopyrite, pyrite, chalcocite and trace bornite 
together with abundant secondary copper minerals.  The main gangue is pervasive siderite 
which is cut by multiphase quartz veining.  Surface waste dumps indicate the presence of at 
least five historic vertical shafts.  These include one 700 foot deep shaft driven on the Monitor 
Vein (the "Monitor Shaft") and four closely spaced shafts between 40 and 175 feet deep on the 
Richmond Vein (the "Richmond Shafts").  In addition there are two portal adits that lead into 
horizontal tunnels that were driven to intersect the Richmond and Monitor veins (Photo 3).  

There is relatively little reliable information regarding the historic exploration and construction of 
these workings during the early 1900's.  Since the late 1920's no significant exploration has 
reportedly been conducted on the property.  Historic reports by the Montana-Idaho Copper 
Company and Spalding (1913) indicate that between 1900 and 1908 more than 50 carloads of 
copper-rich material totaling 1561 short tons were shipped to a smelter (Tables 2 and 3).  This 
reportedly had an average grade of 14.92% Cu, 0.24 oz/ton Au and 0.76 oz/ton Ag.  However, 
this historic data is not NI 43-101 compliant and should be regarded with extreme caution by the

reader.  It should also be noted that no mineral reserves or resources have been identified on 
the Monitor property to date.   

The geology of the Coeur d'Alene Mining District is dominated by mid-Proterozoic (1.4 to 1.5 
Ga) basin-fill sedimentary rocks of the Belt Super-group (Winstone, 2000).  Rifting and 
subsidence at that time resulted in the deposition a stratigraphic package that exceeded 7 km in 
thickness.  The Monitor property is largely underlain by low metamorphic grade metasediments 
of the Wallace Group which lie in the upper part of the Belt succession (Figures 3 and 4).  The 
Wallace Group includes non-bedded and bedded quartzites, impure carbonates, dolomites and 
minor argillites and siltstones, and these rocks host the Monitor and Richmond veins.  The 
metasediments are intruded by some thin gabbroic dikes that are thought to mostly belong to 
the mid-Proterozoic-age Wishard Sill suite. 

During my two day visit to the property (25th and 26th October 2012) I collected fifteen (15) 
mineralized rock grab samples (MON-01 to MON-15; Table 4) from waste dumps at the 
Richmond and Monitor shafts and the Richmond adit.  These were submitted to the certified 
ALS Chemex Laboratory in Reno, NV.  Thirteen (13) of the fifteen (15) samples contained >1% 
Cu and five samples contained >0.5 g/t Au.  The maximum assays recorded were 13.55% Cu, 
15.45 g/t Au and 57.7 g/t Ag (Table 5) which confirms historic reports that the two veins contain 
high grade copper-gold-silver mineralization. However, the reader is cautioned that there was 
sample bias because only rocks with visible secondary Cu minerals or Cu sulfides were 
selected for assay.  Thus the assay results are not reliable for determining average metal 
grades. 

ASR's exploration will be focused on finding Cu-Au-Ag veins of sufficient grade and tonnage to 
support an underground mining operation that may also include some heap leach techniques.  
As soon as weather permits, ASR intends to start a program that will include both underground 
and surface exploration.  At least four phases, of initial exploration are recommended, namely: 

(i) Re-opening and renovating the old underground Monitor and Richmond mine tunnels, to 
be followed by channel and bulk sampling the veins.  This work will determine the true 
length and orientation of the tunnels, and will provide information on the width, strike 
and metal-grades of the Monitor and Richmond veins. 

(ii) Complete surface geologic mapping, prospecting, and geochemical soil sampling to 
locate any strike extensions of the Richmond and Monitor veins, and discover if any 
other mineralized structures exist on the claim block. 

(iii) Conduct ground and/or aerial geophysical surveys after consultation with a 
geophysicist.  This should be done to outline any extensions of the two known veins as 
well as hopefully discover more mineralized structures.  

(iv) Once the permitting process is completed and final interpretations of the geophysical 
and soil geochemical data are reviewed, ASR should select and test targets with a 
diamond drill program.  Drilling may be done from both surface and underground drill 
pads.

"The Geology & Mineralization at the Cu-Au-Ag Monitor Mine Property, Eastern Coeur d'Alene Mining District, Idaho." 
by G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

2.0  INTRODUCTION 
 

Archean Star Resources Inc. (ASR) contracted the author (G.E. Ray) to prepare this National 
Instrument 43-101 technical report on their Monitor Mine copper-gold-silver property in northern 
Idaho. It comprises twenty (20) lode mining claims totaling approximate 401.56 acres (Figure 2; 
Table 1).  The property, which is located in the eastern part of Idaho's Coeur d'Alene Mining 
District, lies approximately 140 km east of Spokane, Washington, and 36 km north-west of 
Osburn, Idaho.  This report is part of the listing requirements for the TSX Venture Exchange.  
The primary focus of ASR's proposed exploration program is to evaluate the economic potential 
of several extensive steep-dipping sulfide-rich Cu-Au-Ag-bearing vein systems that were 
historically mined around the early 1900s. Smelter returns indicate that during this early 
underground mining some 1561 short tons of mineralized material were shipped (Tables 2 and 
3).  However, the reader is cautioned that this historic data is not compliant with NI 43-101 
standards and cannot be relied upon. 

I spent two days on the Monitor property (25th and 26th October 2012) although both the road 
access and work were impeded by heavy snow (Photos 1, 2 and 3).  During my visit I was 
accompanied by ASR's President, Graeme O'Neill, ASR's exploration manager, Clay Conway, 
and property owner, Martin Clemets.  I examined some rock outcrops and collected fifteen (15) 
mineralized rock samples from three of the old mine waste dumps; these dumps lie adjacent to 
the historic shafts and adits.  The sampled waste-rock workings were those near the "Richmond 
Shafts", the "Monitor Shaft" and the "Richmond Adit" (Figure 2).  The rock samples (MON-01 to 
MON-15; Tables 4 and 5) were submitted to the certified ALS Chemex laboratory in Reno, 
Nevada for precious and base metal assay.  Of the fifteen (15) samples, thirteen (13) assayed 
>1% Cu with one sample containing a maximum of 13.5% Cu (Table 5).  Five of the samples 
contained >0.5 g/t Au with a maximum value of 15.4 g/t Au; one sample assayed 57.7 g/t Ag 
(Table 5).  

The rock types seen on the mine dumps are mostly Meso-proterozoic Wallace Formation 
sedimentary rocks that host pyrite-chalcopyrite mineralization with chalcocite and trace bornite, 
together with siderite and multiphase quartz veining.  Many of the oxidized rocks are coated with 
various blue, green and black secondary copper minerals including malachite, azurite and Cu-
Mn wad. 

The assay results in Table 5 support historic reports that the mined copper mineralization 
contained significant quantities of gold and silver and these three metals will be the main focus 
of ASR's upcoming exploration effort.  The reader is cautioned that there is no mineral or metal 
resource known on the Monitor claims.  The Monitor represents a grassroots property because, 
to my knowledge, during the last eighty years there has been little significant exploration done, 
including no drilling, geophysics or soil geochemical sampling.  Thus, although the copper 
mineralization seen in the waste dumps and the copper-gold assays presented in Table 5 look 
impressive, the full economic potential of the Monitor property is unknown.

I have relied extensively upon information provided by ASR representatives, including the 
Option and Joint Venture Agreement (Appendix A), to describe how they will obtain their 80% 
ownership of the Monitor property, as well as on the data that describes the Idaho exploration 
rights, surface rights, obligations and mineral property dimensions and coordinates.  ASR also 
provided the data of planned exploration expenditures detailed in Appendix B. 

I am not competent to comment on the ownership or the Idaho mining rights and land titles.  
However, on this and for information presented in Figure 2 and Table 1, I have relied on reports, 
maps and data provided by ASR. 

In an email dated the 12th of December 2012, Mr. Graeme O'Neill, President of ASR, informed 
me that the company has paid all taxes for the Monitor property and that no other taxes, duties, 
fees, environmental liabilities or debts are due at this time.  I was further informed that there are 
no liens or other outstanding third party debts or current or pending litigation that may be 
material to the Monitor property assets.  ASR assumes full responsibility for statements on 
mineral title and ownership, and I do not accept any responsibility for errors pertaining to this 
information. 

In addition to field observations made by myself, most of the information in this report was 
obtained from published reports (Section 27) as well as unpublished maps and reports given to 
me by Mr. Martin Clemets of NALLC and the ASR staff.

4.2  Property Location 

The Monitor Mine property lies on the high western slopes of the Bitterroot Mountains, in 
Township sections 8, 9 and 10, T46N, R7E of Shoshone County, Idaho, close to the Idaho-
Montana state borders (Figures 1 and 2).  It is centered close to UTM 607900-5244900 (NAD 
83 datum) and lies approximately 140 km east of Spokane, 36 km north-west of Osburn and 25 
km east-southeast of Wallace, Idaho.  

4.3  Archean's Interest in the Monitor Property 
Under an Option and Joint Venture Agreement dated the 5th of February, 2013 ASR have come 
to an agreement with NALLC and the AMCOR to earn an 80% ownership of the property 
(Appendix A).  NALLC, under the chairmanship of Mr. Martin Clemets, is the original owner of 
the claims while AMCOR holds the mining lease.  

The reader is cautioned that no mineral reserves or resources have been identified on the 
Monitor property to date.  Currently, there are no known risk factors that would impede access 
to the property or the ability by ASR to complete exploration.    

4.4  Native Title 
In a document dated the 28th of January, 2013, Mr. Martin Clemets of NALLC stated that to the 
best of his knowledge there are no native claims to any parts of the Monitor property or 
anywhere within the area of influence covered by the agreement. 

 

5.0  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The Monitor Mine property lies in relatively steep and rugged tree-covered terrane on the high 
western slopes of the Bitterroot Mountains.  It is situated within the North Fork St. Joe River 
watershed close to the headwaters of Mineral Creek (Figure 2) at an elevation between 5500 
and 6100 feet asl.  This area is characterized by a dendritic drainage pattern with steep stream 
channels.  It is covered with extensive conifer forest (Photos 1 and 2).

Taken on the 25th of October, 2012 at UTM 603425-5248218 at 1584 meters elevation asl. 

The property, which is located in northern Idaho immediately adjacent to the western border of 
Montana (Figure 2), is road accessible (Photo 1).  From Spokane, access is made by heading 
east on Interstate Highway 90 towards the Coeur d'Alene Mining District, passing by the mining 
towns of Wallace, Kellogg and Osburn.  Approximately 99 miles from Spokane, Highway 90 
crosses Lookout Pass and enters Montana.  Six miles further on, a turnoff is taken at Exit 5 
(located at UTM 605066-5252924) which leads southeasterly on the Rainy River Road and 
Forest Service Road No. 506. Approximately four miles from Exit 5, another turnoff is made 
along Forest Service Road No. 1187 (Photo 1).  After a further six mile-long drive the Richmond 
shafts and mine dumps are reached; these lie at UTM 607973-5245506 at an elevation of 1836 
meters asl (approximately 6023 feet).  

Although parts of the property have steep terrane, all areas are accessible by foot.  There are 
several old forest logging roads that can be driven by 4-wheel-drive vehicles.   

The Coeur d'Alene district of northern Idaho has had more than one hundred years of 
underground mining (Ransome and Calkins, 1908), which continues to this day (Hobbs et al., 
1965; Bennett, 2006).  It is famed for its mesothermal silver-lead-zinc-(copper) deposits and has 
been one of the primary silver producing areas in the world.  Consequently, it has an extensive 
mining and prospecting culture and is a source of experienced contract labor and mining 
equipment.

It has a cold, moist climate in winter and warm, dryer conditions in summer.  For areas at lower 
elevations in the district, the US Weather Bureau records monthly daily mean temperatures for 
January of 28.4 °F (−2.0 °C) and 69.2 °F (20.7 °C) for August.  Snowfall averages 46 inches 
(117 cm) per year; precipitation is generally lowest in summer.  The frost-free season lasts 
about 120 days from mid-May to mid-September.  Somewhat lower winter and summer 
temperatures can be expected at the 6000 foot elevation of the Monitor Mine property.  A report 
prepared by MCS Environmental, Inc., (MCS, 2005) states that the Avery Ranger Station 
located 16 miles southwest of the property reported a mean annual precipitation of 37 inches 
and a mean annual snowfall of 80 inches. 

The property lies below the tree-line and is heavily forested with numerous tree species, many 
with a preferred elevation growing range.  The softwood forests includes ponderosa pine, lodge-
pole and western white pine, as well as hemlock, western larch, western red cedar, Engelmann 
spruce, Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, and grand fir. 

The property, which totals 401.56 acres, includes steep forested hills with intervening steep 
stream valleys (Photos 1 and 2).  It has a sufficient large size that it can accommodate all 
aspects of an underground mining operation, including areas for potential tailings storage, waste 
disposal, heap leach pads and processing plants.

6.0  HISTORY 

Surface waste dumps on the Monitor property indicate the presence of at least five vertical 
shafts. These include one 700 foot deep shaft on the Monitor Vein (the "Monitor Shaft") and four 
closely spaced shafts between 40 and 175 feet deep at the Richmond Vein (the "Richmond 
Shafts").  In addition there are two portal adits that lead into horizontal tunnels (the "Richmond" 
and "Monitor" adits), (Figure 2; Photo 3).  There is relatively little reliable information regarding 
the historic exploration and construction of these workings, but apparently since the late 1920s 
no significant exploration has been conducted on the property.  Consequently there is no 
evidence that any geophysics, drilling or methodical exploration soil geochemical sampling has 
occurred.  

Much of the sparse data available regarding the early history of the mining activity is taken from 
a report by Spalding (1913) and an undated report written by the Montana-Idaho Copper 
Company staff sometime post-1918 titled "To the Monitor Vein" (Anonymous, 1918?).  The latter 
documents states that the Monitor Vein was discovered in 1897 by prospector Bert Hill during a 
staking rush that occurred throughout the Coeur d'Alene Mining District.  Hill recognized gold 
and silver-bearing copper mineralization at what later became the site of the Monitor Shaft; this 
locality lay only 2000 feet from the Richmond Vein workings which had been discovered 
previously by a prospector named Sutherland.  There were problems with finance but Bert Hill 
had a prosperous brother named Otis who raised the necessary funds.  Together they 
organized the Monitor Consolidation Company with Otis as its president. 

Spalding (1913) describes how the property lay only 1500 feet from the Adair railway station 
(Figure 2), a station on the main line of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway which was 
then in operation.  He also mentions that a water-powered electrical generating station was 
being constructed in the valley below Adair Station; this power plant lay only 2000 feet from the 
site of a proposed portal. At the time Spalding (1913) wrote his report the 700 foot deep Monitor 
Shaft had already been completed.  He recommended driving a northeasterly directed tunnel a 
horizontal distance of 7500 to 8000 feet to pass 110 feet below the deepest part of the Monitor 
Shaft.  The first 2500 to 3000 feet of the tunnel was to be a crosscut to hit the Monitor Vein at an 
angle of 45 degrees.  Once the vein was hit it was proposed that the 5000 foot-long tunnel 
would drift along the vein.  It is not certain if the entire recommended tunnel was fully 
completed. 

Spalding (1913) notes that down the 700 foot deep Monitor Shaft there were five drifts, each 
driven along the vein.  The five drifts down the Monitor Shaft were as follows; 

(1) 100 foot level: a 300 foot drift, of which 50 feet extended east of the shaft and 250 feet west. 

(2) 200 foot level: 115 feet of drift with 75 feet being east and 40 feet being west of the shaft. 

(3) 300 foot level: 110 feet of drift , 60 feet being east and 50 feet west of the shaft. 

(4) 400 foot level: 190 feet of drift with 40 feet being east and 150 feet west of the shaft.

(5) 700 foot level: details of the drift are unknown. 

Spalding (1913) noted that "there are several shoots of ore in the (Monitor) vein raking westerly 
and dipping slightly to the south."  The vein width in the four higher drifts varied between 10 and 
15 feet but on the 700 foot level at the bottom of the shaft a crosscut indicated that the vein was 
thicker since its hanging-wall was not intersected.  Spalding (1913) states that in the Coeur 
d'Alene District many veins thicken with depth. 

The Richmond Vein lay about 2000 feet north of, and sub-parallel to the Monitor body (Spalding, 
1913).  Four shafts were dug.  One of these was 40 feet deep, two others were 75 feet deep 
while the forth reached a depth of 175 feet.  These exposed the 10 foot thick Richmond Vein 
which contained abundant Fe and Cu oxides, massive siderite and younger quartz veins and 
veinlets.  Even at the base of the 175 foot deep Richmond Shaft the mineralization was deeply 
oxidized and gossanous. Spalding (1913) states that two samples taken at a 75 foot-depth in 
two of the Richmond shafts assayed as follows: 

(1)  10.8% Cu, 0.7 oz/ton Ag and 0.3 oz/ton Au. 

(2)  14.2% Cu, 1.4 oz/ton Ag, and 0.12 oz/ton Au. 

It should be noted that nothing is known about the reliability of these historic assays or if they 
were truly representative of the mineralized veins.  Since the data is not NI 43-101 compliant the 
reader should treat these assay values with extreme caution. 

The Richmond Vein trended ENE and was steeply dipping to the north.  A northeast directed 
tunnel was driven from the Richmond portal towards the Richmond shafts.  The portal lies at 
UTM 607579-5243192 (Photo 3) only 460 meters northwest of the Monitor Shaft.  There is little 
reliable data regarding when this tunnel was driven or its true length.

Spalding (1913) and an anonymous report published in the year 2005 after an environmental 
investigation of abandoned mine sites in the St. Joe watershed (MCS, 2005) states that 
shipments of ore from the Monitor Mine began in 1900 with larger quantities being transported 
to the smelter between 1905 and 1908.  Two documents exist that list the ore shipments 
between 1900 and 1908 (Tables 2 and 3).  It should be noted that the metal grades and 
tonnages quoted in these two documents are not NI 43-101 compliant and thus cannot be relied 
on.  Moreover, it is not known if the collection method of the mineralized vein material shipped 
to the smelter caused sampling bias (perhaps by hand sorting).  Thus, the high metal grades 
mentioned in the two documents must be treated with great caution. 

One of these documents is from an undated Montana-Idaho Copper Company report (Table 2) 
which states that 50 carloads were shipped to the smelter; these totaled 1481.7 tons and 
averaged 15% Cu and 0.246 oz/ton Au.

smelter between 1900 and 1908 (from an undated report by the Montana-Idaho Copper 
Company). 

 

The second document (Table 3) is from Spalding's 1913 report; it lists an additional three 
carloads of ore making the total shipped as 1561 tons.  It should be noted that the list in 
Spalding's 1913 report contained one typographic error, namely car No. 44209 which should 
read 0.22 oz/ton Au and not 2.22 oz/ton Au.  However, when corrected it shows that the 53 cars 
of ore totaled 1561 tons and graded 14.92% Cu, 0.24 oz/ton Au and 0.76 oz/ton Ag.  However, 
this historic data is not NI 43-101 compliant and should be regarded with extreme caution by the 
reader.

The "Great Fire" in 1910 burnt a 12,000 square km area in Montana and northern Idaho.  It 
destroyed several towns (including one third of Wallace), killed 87 people and burnt railway lines 
and mine buildings, including the entire ground infrastructure on the Monitor property.  After 
some post-fire rebuilding, the mine closed in 1925 when it had a reported total underground 
development of 12,900 feet (MCS, 2005).  It is not known what production, if any, took place 
between 1909 and 1925.  In the 1940s Day Mines Ltd. (Day), bought the property in a tax sale

but the mine remained dormant and little or no work was done, although MCS (2005) state that 
some "ore" was produced in 1941.  Sporadic minor production may have taken place until 1960.  
In the 1980s, Hecla Mining Company  (Hecla) took over from Day and used the claims as 
leverage in a land exchange for properties surrounding the Lucky Friday Mine which lies close 
to the town of Mullen, approximately 12 miles north-west of the Monitor claim block (Figure 8).  
During the time it was held by Day and Hecla no significant exploration work was recorded on 
the Monitor property.  In the 1970s a district-wide litho-geochemical survey was made of the 
area which was mainly concentrated around the mining centers lying west and north of the 
Monitor property (Gott and Cathrall, 1979).  This work led to the production of several metal 
ratio maps, including map I-1093-I, published at a scale of 1:62,500. 

7.0  GEOLOGICAL SETTING & MINERALIZATION 

7.1 District Geology 
 7.1a Sedimentary Rocks 
The geology of the Coeur d'Alene Mining District is dominated by mid-Proterozoic (1.4 to 1.5 
Ga) basin-fill sedimentary rocks of the Belt Super-group (Winstone, 2000).  Rifting and 
subsidence at that time along the North American continental margin resulted in the deposition 
a stratigraphic package that exceeded 7 km in thickness.  Most of the sediment filled the basin 
from a westerly or southwesterly source and, over time, the environment of the deposition 
changed from deep to shallow water to lagoonal.  

The generalized stratigraphy of the super-group and the thicknesses of the various formations 
are shown in Figures 3 and 4.  From top to exposed bottom the various six formations are as 
follows: 

• Stripped Peak  
• Wallace (which is the host-rocks for the Monitor and Richmond veins) 
• St. Regis 
• Revett 
• Burke 
• Prichard. 

The Prichard Formation is a sequence of bedded, commonly pyritic argillites and fine grained 
quartzites (Ransome and Calkins, 1908).  They are interpreted to be deep water turbidites that 
were deposited in an environment similar to that present at the inland Black Sea basin (Lyon 
and Berner, 1989). 

The Burke Formation of the Ravalli Group (Ransome and Calkins, 1908) is marked by tabular, 
fine grained muddy quartzites and siltstones with bedding varying from centimeters to 
decimeters in thickness.  Its character suggests the rapid accumulation of fine sediments from 
episodic flow across wet alluvial surfaces (Winstone, 2000).  The top of the Burke is placed 
where these silty beds are overlain by substantial thicknesses of tabular, clean quartzite which 
marks the lowermost portion of the Revett Formation.

"The Geology & Mineralization at the Cu-Au-Ag Monitor Mine Property, Eastern Coeur d'Alene Mining District, Idaho." 
by G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

The Revett Formation is subdivided into three informal members (Winstone, 2000; Figure 4).  It 
is marked by well sorted cross-bedded feldspathic quartzites that are inter-layered with lesser 
amounts of ripple marked silty units and argillite.  

The St. Regis Formation is the thinnest unit in the Belt Super-group package with a maximum 
thickness of 200 meters.  It is characterized by mud-cracked silty to clay units that marked 
sheet-flood deposition across sand-flats at the toes of alluvial aprons (Winstone, 2000).  

The Wallace Formation is a 1000 meter thick succession that hosts the Monitor and Richmond 
veins. It is marked by siliciclastic, thin-bedded sediments and dolomitic units.  In the Coeur 
d'Alene district White and Applegate (1999 and unpublished work) identified three units in the 
lower part of the Wallace Formation.  In the vicinity of Placer Creek and the Galena Mine 
(Figure 8), the lower unit contains thin, green siliciclastic and dolomitic rocks that were 
deposited in very shallow water.  The middle Wallace sediments contains silty horizons and 
dolomites that are interpreted to record somewhat deeper water conditions.  The upper unit of 
the lower Wallace in the vicinity of the Galena Mine suggests a return to a more shallow water 
environment.  

The middle Wallace is marked by an abrupt change from thin bedded to thicker sedimentary 
cycles, and the sediments are sandier.  The evidence of increasing wave turbulence reflects 
somewhat deeper water but whether the sea was still a large closed lake or connected to the 
ocean is uncertain (Winstone, 2000).  One marked feature of the Wallace Formation rocks is the 
presence of quartz-rich breccia horizons, some of which are many kilometers in strike length.  
These are marked by soft sediment deformation and chaotic slump features.  They are 
interpreted to have formed by sub-aqueous slumping of water-saturated sediments down the 
basin margins to produce gravity slide deposits (Godlewski, 2011).  

The 500 meter thick Striped Peak Formation lies at the top of the super-group (Figure 3).  It 
comprises quartzites that mark a vast alluvial apron, similar to many of the Revett rocks.  This 
formation appears to host no mineralization in the district.

 7.1b Intrusive Rocks 
Igneous rocks in the district are limited to various mafic sills and dikes.  Some thin minor 
intrusions are believed to be of Cretaceous-Tertiary age but the more extensive sills are thought 
to be pre-Cambrian and may be more or less coeval with some of the younger Belt Super-group 
sedimentation; many of the latter are probably equivalent in age and origin to the Moyie Sills 
seen in the vicinity of the Sullivan Pb-Zn-Ag deposit in British Columbia (Anderson and Davies, 
1995).  The most impressive body of this type in the immediate Monitor Mine area is the

Wishard Sill which is of quartz diorite-gabbro composition (locally called "diabase").  This body 
ranges from 125 to 300 meters in thickness and is traceable along strike for 45 km (Kleinkopf et 
al., 1972).  It has a curious large-scale sigmoidal outcrop pattern that may indicate some right-
lateral strike-slip movement.  The Wishard Sill is associated with some thermal metamorphism; 
outcrops of this body were seen at UTM 602812-5248548, approximately 6.4 km northwest of 
the Monitor Shaft.  Thin section studies by Ransome and Calkins (1908) showed that the 
Wishard Sill contains abundant lathes of labradorite-plagioclase and augite with some quartz.  
Other minerals present include minor ilmenite, apatite, biotite, sericite, zoisite, scapolite, 
leucoxene and chlorite. 

Other thinner sills of the Wishard-type are present in the district and some are reported on the 
Monitor property.  There has been considerable historic debate about whether the Wishard-type 
sills are spatially related to some of the mineralized veins.  However, current theories, supported 
by isotope data, suggest that the veins originated from Proterozoic-age mineralization 
developed in the Precambrian sediments and were then remobilized during a later Cretaceous 
magmatic-deformation event (Fleck et al., 2002).  Thus, it is possible that some veins were 
controlled by fissure structures that also controlled some of the older sills. 

 7.1c District Structural Geology 
The Coeur d'Alene Mining District lies at the junction of the ESE trending Lewis and Clark Line 
and the northerly striking Noxon arch (Figure 5; Harrison et al., 1974; White, 2000).  Its rocks 
have undergone strong folding and faulting.  The Lewis and Clark Line is a 50 km wide, ESE 
trending zone of abundant normal, reverse and trans-current faulting.  The largest brittle 
structure, the Osburn Fault (Figures 6 and 8), transects the district and forms part of the Lewis 
and Clark Line.  It has undergone 20 to 30 km of post-ore right-lateral transcurrent movement 
(Mauk and White, 2004).  

The structural history of the district is complex.  At least five episodes of post-sediment 
deformation have been identified (Wavra et al., 1994) and many geologists suggest some syn-
depositional faulting occurred along the Lewis and Clark Line.  In the Monitor Mine area the 
regional deformation of the Wallace sedimentary rocks was accompanied by greenschist facies 
metamorphism.  Deformation along Lewis and Clark Line resulted in a complex pattern of sub-
parallel easterly to ESE trending brittle structures that include the Thompson Pass, Osburn, 
Placer Creek, Slate Creek and Mastadon Mountain faults (Figures 6 and 8).  Splay sets from 
these major faults commonly trend SSW to southerly.  Many of the major ESE striking faults, as 
well as some lesser splays are economically important as they appear to control the 
mineralization.  Wavra et al (1994) concluded that the deformation associated with 
mineralization at the Sunshine Mine (Figure 8) was normal dip-slip movement along the Osburn 
Fault.  This orogenic event may have been related to the intrusion of the Idaho Batholith (Figure 
5) and/or the docking of the Wallowa Terrane.

 7.1d District Mineralization 
The Belt Super-group is famed in hosting some of the world's major metal deposits or mining 
camps; these include the syngenetic Sullivan Pb-Zn-Ag deposit in British Columbia (Anderson 
and Davies, 1995; Figure 5), the Revett-type, strata-bound Cu-Ag deposits in the Ravalli Group 
and the probably younger Ag-Pb-Zn-Cu-Au veins that comprise the Coeur d'Alene Mining 
District (White, 2000: Mauk and White, 2004).  The Coeur d'Alene district is the second largest 
producer of silver in the world (Mauk and White, 2004), following Potosi in Bolivia.  It reportedly

produced over 34,000 metric tonnes of silver, 7.2 million metric tonnes (Mt) of lead and 2.8 Mt of 
zinc (Long, 1998); however, the reader is warned that this historic production data is not NI 43-
101 compliant and thus it cannot be relied on. 

The Coeur d'Alene district has a well defined district-scale zonation of the chemistry and metals 
in its veins.  With some exceptions, the veins in the western part of the district tend to be richer 
in Pb-Zn, those in the central parts are richer in Ag, while those to the east and SE are 
enhanced in Cu with byproduct Au and Ag; the veins on the Monitor property belong to the latter 
group.  All the significant ore deposits in the district lie within twelve well-defined, sub-parallel 
mineral belts, some of which are base metal rich while others contain more silver.  The latter are 
found within the 8 km long "Silver Belt" which is located south of the Osburn Fault (Figure 6).  
This contains numerous Ag-rich mines including the Crescent, Sunshine, Consolidated Silver, 
Coeur and Galena (Figures 6 and 8).  The Silver Belt is flanked to the west by the Bunker Hill 
Mine in which Pb-Zn was predominant, while to the east the veins are Cu-base metal rich; the 
recent increase in base metal prices has resulted in the veins further east being now explored 
for their Cu-Au potential.

7.2 Property Geology  
Very little is known about the detailed geology of the Monitor property.  A 1:250,000 scale 
geological and geophysical investigation map of the region (Kleinkopf et al., 1972) shows the 
property is largely underlain by low metamorphic grade Wallace Group metasediments that 
includes non-bedded and bedded quartzites, impure carbonates, dolomites and minor argillites 
and siltstones.  These are intruded by some thin mafic dikes that are thought to mostly belong to 
the Proterozoic Wishard Sill suite.  The sedimentary bedding and sills strike mostly east-west to 
ESE and are steep dipping. 

On route to the Monitor property I examined outcrops of the main Wishard Sill located at UTM 
602812-5248548 at an elevation of 1562 meters asl.  Here it forms a dark colored equigranular 
medium to coarse grained mafic rock that is visually estimated to contain 30 to 40 percent fine-
grained mafic minerals (probably mostly pyroxene with lesser hornblende).  It is weakly 
magnetic and contains trace pyrite with possible trace pyrrhotite.  

During the collection of fifteen rock assay samples from waste dumps at the Richmond Shafts, 
the Richmond portal and the Monitor Shaft areas I saw well bedded, brownish-grey and fine-
grained  quartzites with some bleached and hydrothermally altered impure carbonates and 
limey sandstones. These rock types were coated or impregnated with jarosite, hematite and 
various secondary copper oxides which were associated with tan colored siderite and white 
quartz veining.  A few examples contained veins and blebs of massive pyrite and chalcopyrite 
with chalcocite and trace bornite. 

7.3 Property Mineralization  
Like all parts of the Coeur d'Alene district, the mineralization on the property occurs in sub-
vertical sulfide-rich veins that reportedly range between 10 and 15 feet in total thickness.  
However, unlike the Ag-Pb-Zn-rich veins currently and historically mined further west in the 
district, the Monitor veins are enhanced primarily in copper with by-product gold and silver.  
Historic data suggests the veins were geochemically enriched in both Ni and Co but no nickel or 
cobalt-bearing minerals have been identified.  

To-date two veins are known to exist on the property - the Monitor and the Richmond.  
However, many of the vein systems elsewhere in the district occur as en-echelon or sub-parallel 
sets; thus, it is likely that more undiscovered veins exist on the claims.  The Monitor Vein 
reportedly strikes ESE, parallel to the main trend of all the major brittle structures, including the 
Osburn Fault to the north and the Slate Creek Fault further south (Figures 6 and 8).  Historic 
documents report that the Richmond Vein had a south-west to WSW strike; if true this means 
that the two vein systems may intersect.

Photo 4: Mineralized sample MON-08 taken from the Monitor Shaft waste dump (UTM 
607916-5244876; elevation 1796 meters asl). 

The pyrite-chalcopyrite-chalcocite mineralization is associated with Cu-oxides and 
abundant Fe-oxide-stained siderite and quartz veins. This sample assayed 5.48 % Cu, 
15.45 ppm Au and 4.25 g/t Ag (Table 5). 

Mineralization, as reported from the historic small-scale mining and from the samples I collected 
on the waste dumps, includes variable amounts of pyrite and chalcopyrite occurring as fine-
grained disseminations, veinlets and coarse masses.  Also present are chalcocite and trace 
bornite.  Some rocks are gossanous and coated or impregnated with abundant amounts of 
secondary Cu minerals, including malachite, azurite and chrysocolla.  The gangue comprises 
abundant massive Fe-oxide-stained siderite with lesser amounts of pale grey quartz that occurs 
as masses, veins and veinlets.  In addition minor ankerite was seen.  The quartz appears to cut 
and postdate the siderite and, in some samples, the quartz veins and veinlets have been 
brecciated, suggesting recurrent post-mineral faulting along the vein structure (Photo 4).  

During my due diligence visit to the property I collected fifteen (15) rock grab samples (MON-01 
to MON-15) from the waste dumps:  these were submitted to the certified ALS Chemex 
Laboratory in Reno, NV.  The samples descriptions and assay results are shown below in 
Tables 4 and 5.

Regarding these assay results it should be noted that there was sample bias because only 
rocks with visible secondary Cu minerals or Cu sulfides were selected.  However, although the 
assay results (Table 5) are not reliable for determining average metal grades, they do show that 
the veins on the Monitor property contain impressive quantities of Cu and Au which gives 
encouragement for further exploration.

Other points noted from the assay results are: 

1. Values in Pb and Zn are very low.  This probably accounts for the relatively low Ag 
values, with the exception of sample MON-15 which assayed high in both Au and Ag 
(9.67 ppm Au and 57.7 ppm Ag). 

2. Arsenic showed moderately anomalous values with a maximum of 623 ppm. 
3. Bismuth and Sb values were low. 
4. Anomalous Hg values (up to 10.25 ppm) showed some positive correlation with higher 

Au.  
5. There is no enhancement in W, Sn or Mo. 
6. Contrary to historic reports there is no enrichment in Ni or Co  in these samples. 
7. There is an apparent sporadic enrichment in Ce and La; the significance of this is 

unknown. 

The assay results suggest there is no clear correlation between Cu and Au.  It is perhaps 
significant that many of the samples with the highest Au values also contain significant amounts 
of quartz veining.  The possibility that some of the richer gold is hosted in the late quartz veins 
should be tested by selective sampling during the up-coming underground exploration.

8.0  DEPOSIT TYPE 

The initial focus of ASR's exploration program will be to open up the old underground tunnels, 
complete some geological mapping, soil geochemical and geophysical surveys and then drill 
favorable targets.  The main aim of the program is to find Cu-Au-Ag veins of sufficient grade and 
tonnage to support an underground mining operation that may also include some heap leach 
techniques.  

The mesothermal, sulfide-rich veins of the Coeur d'Alene Mining District are commonly steep 
dipping and less than 15 feet thick; many veins have undergone post-ore brittle deformation.  
The ore zones often occur as sub-vertical slabs that are highly suitable for underground stope-
mining.  The veins are famous for their comparative long strike (> 0.5 km) and great vertical 
depth (>1 km).  For example, at the Gold Hunter Mine the mineralization extends down to a 
depth of 7900 feet (2400 meters), while the Lucky Friday Mine shaft extends to a depth of 6000 
feet (1828 meters).  In some mines the metal grades increase at deeper elevations.  In the 
western and central parts of the district veins may typically contain 350 to 850 g/t Ag with multi-
percent Pb and Zn (Mauk and White, 2004).  Galena and sphalerite are the commonest base 
metal minerals while the Ag-rich deposits contain argentiferous tetrahedrite with lesser galena, 
sphalerite, chalcopyrite and boulangerite.  Siderite and quartz are the main gangue minerals.  
Most individual silver-rich ore bodies do not show a metal zoning.  However some veins, such 
as the one worked at the Star and Morning mines, change their chemistry along strike with the 
Star portion being Ag-rich and the Morning part having more Pb with the Ag (Bennett et al., 
1989).  Veins in the eastern and south-eastern parts of the district (such as those on the Monitor 
claims) tend to be more copper rich with less Ag, Pb and Zn.  This suggests they formed at 
higher temperatures or were closer to the hydrothermal source than those to the west.  These 
copper rich veins also seldom exceed 15 feet in width but have been known to extend to very 
great depths.  They contain variable amounts of pyrite and chalcopyrite with trace bornite and 
gold and silver.  At depth some veins show increasing amounts of pyrrhotite. 

Major producers in the Coeur d'Alene district (Ransome and Calkins, 1908; Bennett and 
Venkatakrishnan, 1982; Bennett, 1984; 2006) include: 

• The Coeur Mine which produced approximately 2.5 million Moz of silver a year during its 
lifetime.  This lies about 20 miles north-west of the Monitor Mine (Figure 8). 

• Lucky Friday Mine which up to 2002 produced 125 Moz of silver.  This lies approximately 
twelve miles north-west of the Monitor claims (Figure 8). 

• Sunshine Mine which over its life produced 367 Moz of silver.  This lies about 25 miles 
north-west of the Monitor property (Figure 8). 

It should be noted that the Sunshine Mine was probably the largest silver producer from any 
single silver mine in the world.  By comparison, the fabled Comstock Lode in Nevada produced 
about 200 Moz of silver although this was done from many mines in that camp.  However, the 
reader is warned that the production data listed above is not NI 43-101 compliant and thus it 
cannot be verified.

by G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

Three main types of hydrothermal alteration are associated with, or envelope the veins (Mauk 
and White, 2004).  These are: (i) hydrothermal bleaching, (ii) carbonate zoning and (iii) sulfide 
alteration. The hydrothermal bleaching, which is due to the lack of pigmenting hematite, is 
controlled by faults, shear zones, cleavages and ruptured flanks of folds.  It commonly lies 
adjacent to the most economic sulfide-rich part of the veins and may envelope clusters of 
sulfide-rich material.  There can be an alteration zoning around some veins.  Most productive 
veins are immediately enveloped by zones of disseminated siderite that may extend hundreds 
of meters out into the wall rocks.  The siderite zones may then pass out to a carbonate zone 
that also may be hundreds of meters wide; the latter zone contains abundant ankerite with 
lesser calcite.  Some veins are haloed by zones containing low grade disseminated galena, 
sphalerite, tetrahedrite, arsenopyrite and pyrite.   

The source and age of the Coeur d'Alene veins has been much disputed.  Many now believe 
they were emplaced during a Cretaceous or Tertiary event, but that they represent remobilized 
Pre-Cambrian sulfides that were originally laid down in Proterozoic times.  Thus, they could 
have been derived from Sullivan and/or Revett-type deposits buried at depth (White, 2000; 
Fleck et al., 2002).

9.0  EXPLORATION 

9.1 Introduction 
Because ASR has only very recently acquired the Monitor property they have not yet begun any 
systematic surface exploration.  They have however, recently started to investigate reopening 
and re-timbering the Monitor portal.  Once this is done, and subject to permitting, the tunnel will 
then be assessed for safety.  There are plans to do similar work at the Richmond portal and 
tunnel.  In addition to accessing, mapping and bulk sampling these underground workings 
during 2013, ASR plans to conduct a surface exploration program.  This will include geological 
mapping, soil sampling, prospecting and possibly contracting an airborne geophysical VTEM 
and magnetic survey.  After all required permits are granted and geochemical and/or 
geophysical targets are selected, then diamond drilling can take place.  

9.2 Geological Mapping & Prospecting 
To date ASR has not done any geological mapping or prospecting on the Monitor property.  
During my recent NI 43-101 visit to the area I collected fifteen (15) mineralized grab rock 
samples from the waste dumps that lie close to the Richmond and Monitor shafts and the 
Richmond adit (Table 4).  These  were submitted for multi-element assay and the results are 
seen in Table 5).  

9.3 Sampling Method and Approach  
In October 2012, as part of the author's NI 43-101 due-diligence visits, fifteen (15) grab rock 
samples were collected (Table 4).  These represented samples with variable amounts of Cu-
oxide and lesser sulfides.  They were collected from the waste dumps close to the Richmond 
and Monitor shafts and the Richmond adit.  Thus, there is sample bias, although they prove the 
existence of Cu, Ag and Au mineralization on the property.  Assay results indicate values up to 
13.55% Cu, 15.45 g/t Au, and 57.7 g/t Ag (Table 5). 

All samples were placed in clean plastic sample bags and held by the author in safe storage 
until they were dispatched via United Parcel Services (UPS) to the ALS Chemex Laboratories at 
4977 Energy Way, Reno, NV 89502-4105 (Tel 775 356 5395).   

10.0  DRILLING 

There is no evidence that any drilling has ever been done on the Monitor Cu-Au-Ag property. 

11.0  SAMPLING PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

The fifteen (15) litho-geochemical rock samples (MON-01 to MON-15; Tables 4 and 5) collected 
by the author were securely delivered via UPS shipment to the ALS Chemex Laboratories at

and monitoring of ALS Chemex's various Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control programs 
in each department, on a regular basis.  Audited both internally and by outside parties, these 
programs include proficiency testing of a variety of parameters, ensuring that all key methods 
have standard operating procedures (SOPs) that are in place and being followed properly, and 
ensuring that quality control standards are producing consistent results.  Most of ALS Chemex 
laboratories worldwide are registered or are pending registration to ISO 9001:2000, and a 
number of analytical facilities have received ISO 17025 accreditations for specific laboratory 
procedures. 

ASR is independent from, and has no financial interest or holdings with the ALS Laboratory 
Group.  ASR's relationship with ALS is that of an independent paying customer requiring reliable 
and meticulous assay work.  

The submitted samples were crushed in a jaw crusher and then crushed further in a hammer 
mill.  They were then split to obtain a 100 g "sub-fraction" which was then pulverized in a ring 
pulverizer.  A 50 g sample weight was digested with aqua regia and gold was determined by 
atomic absorption and ICP (Au-ICP 22) and gravimetric (Au-GRA 22) for over-limits, while other 
elements were determined via ME-MS 41 and ME-ICP 41a coded methods. 

12.0  DATA VERIFICATION 

The fifteen (15) grab rock samples collected by the author (Tables 4 and 5) represented Cu-
bearing rock grab samples taken from waste dumps at the Monitor and Richmond shafts and at 
the Richmond adit.  The reader is cautioned that grab samples are selective by nature; thus 
they do not necessarily represent the true average grade of the mineralization.  Consequently, 
there was sample bias, although the main aim of the sampling was to verify the presence of Cu 
and test whether the mineralization was associated with Au, Ag, Ni and Co, as reported in the 
historic mine documents.  No quality control procedures, such as submitting blanks and gold 
standard samples, were performed for the fifteen (15) rock samples.  However, ALS Chemex 
laboratory did perform check repeat assays and completed some assays on their own standard 
and blank samples.   

13.0  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The Monitor property is a grassroots-stage exploration project with no known mineral or metal 
reserves or resources.  Although small-scale underground mining occurred on the property up 
to the 1920s, nothing is known about the historic mineral processing or metallurgical testing 
done at that time.    

14.0  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

There is no current National Instrument 43-101 compliant resource or reserve estimate for any 
of the mineralized areas on the Monitor Property.

23.0  ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

Mining in the Coeur d'Alene district began in the late 1880s, and more than 90 historical mines 
are recorded (Bennett et al., 1989) although only a few such as the Galena, Lucky Friday and 
Sunshine are currently in operation (Figures 6 and 8).  Most of the mines were located along the 
South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River and its major tributaries.  Total production records 
indicate that this district ranks among the top 1 percent of the world producers for silver (34,300 
tonnes Ag) and lead (7.3 Mt Pb) and among the top 10 percent of world producers for zinc (2.8 
Mt Zn) (Long, 1998a, 1998b).  The mined ore deposits in the district are steeply dipping quartz 
and siderite (FeCO3) veins containing massive sulfide Ag-Pb-Zn ± Cu ± Au mineralization.

by G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

Within the immediate vicinity of the Monitor claim block there are a number of massive sulfide 
veins that were historically worked on a small scale (Figure 7).  These include the "St. 
Lawrence" workings which lie approximately 1000 feet east-northeast of the Richmond Shafts 
and close to the northern boundary of the Monitor claims.  They appear to have been developed 
down an eastern extension of the Richmond Vein.  Spalding (1913) states that at St. Lawrence 
a 600 to 700 foot long drift was driven along the vein.  The copper-silver-gold mineralization 
appeared to be identical to that shipped in the early 1900s from the Monitor and Richmond 
veins to a smelter (Tables 2 and 3).  Spalding (1913) notes that some mineralized material was 
likewise shipped from the St. Lawrence workings.

The "Copper Age and Edison" workings lie about 5000 feet east-northeast of the Richmond 
Shafts (Figure 7).  They reported followed eastern extensions of both the Richmond and Monitor 
veins.  A tunnel and drift several hundred feet in length showed the near-vertical vein to be 
about ten feet thick.  Like the two veins on the Monitor property, they contained chalcopyrite and 
chalcocite in a gangue of oxidized siderite (Spalding, 1913).  

Approximately 2000 feet southwest of the Monitor Shaft there was the "Wampum Group" 
(Figure 7) which contained a number of veins with copper mineralization; these veins trended 
sub-parallel to the Monitor Vein (Spalding, 1913).

Some of the more important producing and past producing mines lying west and north of the 
Monitor property are shown in Figure 8.  However, the reader should be aware that the 
production data quoted below for these mines was obtained from scientific and/or government 
publications.  It is not NI 43-101 compliant and thus is unreliable and cannot be verified. 

The Lucky Friday Mine is situated twelve miles north-west of the Monitor property, lying close to 
the Osburn Fault.  In 1942 the Lucky Friday Mining Company shipped its first ore, and in 1964, 
after the company merged with Hecla, construction of a 6000 feet deep main production shaft 
began.  The silver-rich ore bodies become richer with depth and up to the year 2002 the mine 
had produced 125 Moz of silver.  It remains operational, but is currently under rehabilitation.   

The Galena Mine is situated about 20 miles north-west of the Monitor claims.  It was periodically 
mined until the Great Depression in the 1930s.  Then in 1947, Asarco leased the mine and, after 
sinking a 3000 feet deep shaft, commercial silver ore was discovered.  Like the Friday Mine, the 
veins became higher grade with depth.  New production began in 1955 and at that time Galena 
was one of the largest producers in the US.  This was due to Asarco's efficient operation and to 
more than twenty-two years of labor harmony.  The mine closed in 1991 due to low metal 
prices, but was reopened in 1996 under a new partnership between Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp., 
and Asarco.  This partnership was called the Silver Valley Resources Corporation.  In 1999 
Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp. bought out Asarco's interest in the partnership and took over 
operation of the mine. 

The Coeur Mine which lies close to the Galena Mine (Figure 8) began production in 1974.  It 
was owned by Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation and operated by Asarco until 1991.  It opened 
briefly in 1996, but closed again because of low reserves.  During its operation the veins 
produced about 2.5 Moz of silver a year (Bennett, 2006). 

The Bunker Hill Mine lies in the western part of the district, approximately 30 miles north-west of 
the Monitor Mine (Figure 8).  It was discovered in 1885, after which in 1903 the 3200 meter-long 
Kellogg tunnel was driven and the very large and rich "March" ore body was discovered.  The 
Bunker Hill Mining Company built its own smelter in 1917 and an electrolytic zinc plant (with 
Hecla Mining Company) in 1928.  In later years, sulfuric acid generated from the smelter was 
combined with phosphate ore mined from southeastern Idaho to make fertilizer.  Gulf Resources 
and Chemical Corporation purchased the Bunker Hill Company in 1968, but closed the 
operation in 1981.  When the mine and metallurgical complex closed, it was producing about 20 
percent of the nation's refined lead and zinc and 25 percent of its silver.  The mine reopened in 
1988, but closed again in 1991.  Bunker Hill was the largest metal producer in the Coeur 
d'Alene mining camp.  There are more than 200 km of underground workings and it was the 
largest lead-zinc mine in the United States.  It still reportedly contains substantial reserves of 
zinc-rich ore (Bennett, 2006). 

The Morning and Star Mines lie about 17 miles north-west of the Monitor property; they both 
worked the same ore body.  The Morning Mine at the east end of the vein system is Pb-Ag-rich 
whereas the Star Mine ore is Zn-rich.  This complex zinc-lead ore initially caused metallurgical 
problems.  But in the 1920s after selective floatation methods were discovered, it became 
possible to separate the two metals.  In 1961 Hecla leased the Morning Mine but stopped 
mining in 1982.  The mine was later re-opened but closed again in 1990.  The Morning-Star had

the second largest Ag-Pb-Zn production in the Coeur d'Alene district after the Bunker Hill Mine 
(Bennett, 2006). 

24.0  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

The author is not aware of any other relevant material data and information that would result in 
misleading statements regarding the Monitor Mine property. 

25.0  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The Monitor property represents a grassroots exploration project where it is hoped to discover 
Cu-Au-(Ag) sulfide-rich veins with sufficient tonnage and metal grades to support an 
underground mine or surface heap-leach operation.  Documentary evidence derived from the 
historic underground mining between 1900 and 1908 (Tables 2 and 3) suggests the presence of 
at least two sulfide-rich veins, the Monitor and the Richmond.  However, elsewhere in the Coeur 
d'Alene camp, the soil and forest cover has often concealed near-surface mineralized 
exposures.  This and the fact that elsewhere many vein systems occur in sub-parallel clusters 
suggest that additional undiscovered veins exist on the Monitor property. 

The Monitor property is considered to have a good exploration potential for high-grade sulfide-
rich veins for the following reasons: 

• It lies at the eastern end of the Coeur d'Alene Mining District which has been a world 
class producer of silver with byproduct gold and base metals.  

• Despite some small scale historic underground mining on its Cu-Au-(Ag) veins, the 
Monitor property is under-explored since it has never been drilled or subjected to any 
modern geophysical or detailed geochemical exploration programs.  

• Parts of the property are easily accessible by road.  

•  Grab samples recently collected from the waste dumps gave maximum assays of 
13.55% Cu, 15.45 g/t Au and 57.7 g/t Ag (Table 5).  This confirms historic reports that 
high grade copper-gold-silver mineralization exists on the property. 

•  At least two veins, the Richmond and the Monitor, are known to be present on the 
claims; they are reportedly up to 15 feet thick and historic underground workings show 
these veins extend to over 700 feet in depth.  

•  There is relatively little rock exposure on the property.  It is likely that geochemical soil 
and geophysical exploration programs will discover additional veins as well as outline 
lateral extensions of the Richmond and Monitor mineralized structures. 

The reader is cautioned that while the Monitor property is believed (for the reasons mentioned 
above) to have a good potential for hosting Cu-Ag (Ag) mineralization suitable for supporting an 
underground mining venture, the project faces the usual economic risks and uncertainties

common to the precious and base metal exploration industry worldwide.  One major risk is 
whether the current high prices of copper, gold and silver are sustained; a significant fall in 
these metal prices would seriously impact the economic viability of any exploration-mining 
operation.  Other uncertainties include the US Federal and State governments regarding their 
granting title and permits, as well as the legal requirements to undertake an exploration/ mining 
program that would satisfy environmental standards.   

26.0  RECOMMENDATIONS 

As soon as weather improves and the necessary permits are granted, ASR intends to start a 
serious exploration program on the Monitor property.  The program will include both 
underground and surface exploration.  At least five phases, of initial exploration are 
recommended, namely: 

1. Re-opening and renovating the old underground Monitor and Richmond mine tunnels to 
be followed by channel and bulk sampling the veins.  This work will determine the true 
length and orientation of the tunnels, and may provide information on the width, strike 
and metal-grades of the Monitor and Richmond veins. 

2. As far as possible, systematically channel sample underground exposures of the veins. 
This should be done to determine: (a) whether any metal zoning is present across the 
veins and (b) in which minerals and in what form the gold and silver occurs.  

3. Conduct surface geologic mapping, prospecting, and geochemical soil sampling to 
locate any strike extensions of the Richmond and Monitor veins, and discover any other 
mineralized structures on the claim block. 

4. Conduct ground and/or aerial geophysical surveys after consultation with a 
geophysicist.  This should be done to further aid in the extension and discovery of 
mineralized veins.    

5. Once the permitting process is complete and final interpretations of the geophysical and 
soil geochemical data are reviewed, ASR should select and test targets with a diamond 
drill program.  Drilling may be done from both surface and underground drill pads.  

Immediately following my due diligence visit in October 2012, prospector Martin Clemets 
organized a visit to outline the prospects of accessing the Monitor portal.  At a later date the 
Richmond portal will also be assessed. 

Provided full financing is obtained, and subject to permitting, the early stages of the 2013 
season exploration are planned as follows: 

• Review the historical data from Hecla and Anaconda libraries (underway) 
• Conduct computer mapping and modeling (underway) 
• Acquire additional claims along strike extensions of the known veins (underway) 
•  Access the Monitor and Richmond underground workings (has begun and hoped to be 

completed in early 2013)

required to be incurred by such date, Archean Star may pay the deficiency to or at the direction of 
AMCOR in cash within sixty (60) days after such date, in order to maintain the Option in good standing.  
Such payments of cash in lieu of Expenditures shall be deemed to be Expenditures incurred on the

payment set out in Section 3.3(e) has been paid up to the date of exercise of the Option by giving notice in 
writing of such termination to AMCOR, and in the event of such termination, this Agreement will, except 
for the provisions of Sections 2.4, 3.12 and 6.2, be of no further force and effect save and except for any 
obligations of Archean Star incurred prior to the effective date of termination. 

3.9 The options described in this Agreement are options only and except for the payments required in 
Section 3.3(a) and 3.3(e) which are obligatory, and except as specifically provided otherwise, nothing 
herein contained will be construed as obligating Archean Star to do any acts or make any payments 
hereunder except as otherwise set forth, and any act or acts or payment or payments as may otherwise be 
made hereunder will not be construed as obligating Archean Star to do any further act or make any further 
payment or payments. 

3.10 Archean Star may at any time during the Option Period elect to abandon any one or more of the 
Claims by giving a minimum of a sixty (60) day notice in writing to AMCOR and NALLC of such 
intention.  Any Claims so abandoned shall be in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which

AMCOR at Archean Star's expense.

Agreement will promptly notify the other Party in writing if it becomes aware of any fact or condition that 
causes or constitutes a material breach of any of its representations and warranties as of the date of this 
Agreement, or if it becomes aware of the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or 
condition that would cause or constitute a material breach of any such representation or warranty had such 
representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition.  
During the same period, each Party will promptly notify the other parties of the occurrence of any 
material breach of any of its covenants in this Agreement or of the occurrence of any event that may make 
the satisfaction of such conditions impossible or unlikely. 

3.12 AMCOR hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold harmless Archean Star against any losses, claims 
and liabilities arising out of or in respect of AMCOR failing to maintain the Mining Lease in good 
standing or exercising its rights thereunder for the benefit of Archean Star in accordance with this 
Agreement.  

3.13 The Option cash payments set out in Sections 3.3(a), 3.3(b), 3.3(e), 3.3(f), 3.3(g) and 3.3(h) are

SCHEDULE "B" – PROPERTY OBLIGATIONS 

Article 7 of the Mining Lease 

During the first year of the primary term of the Mining Lease, AMCOR shall perform US$50,000 of work 
upon, towards, or for the eventual benefit of the Property.  Funds used directly to acquire additional 
unpatented mining claims will be attributed to the first year's work requirement.  During the second and 
third year, an additional US$50,000 of work upon, toward, or for the eventual benefit of the Property 
shall be performed.  During the fourth year, and each year thereafter, AMCOR shall perform US$100,000 
of work upon, towards, or for the eventual benefit of the Property.  Provided, however, in the event 
commercial production is commenced at any time, Article 7 of the Mining Lease requiring minimum 
work shall not be applicable. 

The term "upon" means exploration or development work performed within the exterior vertical 
boundaries of the Property.  The work may include, but is not limited to diamond drilling, drifting, shaft 
sinking, raising, rehabilitation of existing underground openings in advance of any such work, surface 
mapping, geochemical surveys, stratigraphic and structural investigations, metallurgical and other 
physical analytical work, mine engineering and geological analysis which enhances the understanding of 
the geology and possible mineralization of the Property, and, in addition, all unpatented claim holding 
costs. 

The term "toward" means the kind of work described above, but performed within 1,000 feet of any 
exterior boundary of the Property. 

In the event work is performed in excess of the required minimum amounts during any period, the 
excess may be carried forward to the credit of AMCOR.

G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

SCHEDULE "C" - JOINT VENTURE TERMS 

In this Schedule "C", terms and expressions given a defined meaning in the Agreement to which this 
Schedule "C" is attached shall have the corresponding meaning in this Schedule "C".   

1. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES 

The relationship of the Parties in the Joint Venture shall not be, and shall not be construed to be, a 
partnership relationship, an agency or legal representative relationship or a fiduciary relationship.  
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Schedule "C", the rights, privileges, powers, duties, 
liabilities and obligations of the Parties shall be as joint venturers and shall be several and not joint or 
joint and several. 

2. CALCULATION OF JOINT VENTURE INTERESTS 

The following provisions shall apply until such time as the Parties have entered into the definitive Option 
and Joint Venture Agreement failing which the Agreement to which this Schedule "C" is attached will 
continue to govern the relations between them. 

2.1 Initial Calculation.  On the date that the Joint Venture is formed as a result of the exercise of the 
Option, AMCOR and Archean Star are deemed to have the following Joint Venture Interests: 

 AMCOR Archean Star 

Deemed Expenditures: $420,000 $2,100,000 

Joint Venture Interest 20% 80%  

2.2 Calculation on Ongoing Basis.  Subject to Section 2.3 of this Schedule "C", AMCOR's and 
Archean Star's, as the case may be, Joint Venture Interest, calculated at any time and from time to time, 
shall be determined in accordance with the formula:  

A  =  B x 100% 
              C 

where 

(a) A is AMCOR's or Archean Star's, as the case may be, Joint Venture Interest;  

(b) B is an amount equal to AMCOR's or Archean Star's, as the case may be, deemed Expenditures 
under Section 2.1 of this Schedule "C", plus all of AMCOR's or Archean Star's, as the case may be, 
Expenditures made after the formation of the Joint Venture; and 

(c) C is an amount equal to the Parties' total deemed Expenditures under Section 2.1 of this 
Schedule "C" plus all of the Parties' Expenditures made after the formation of the Joint Venture.

"The Geology & Mineralization at the Cu-Au-Ag Monitor Mine Property, Eastern Coeur d'Alene Mining District, Idaho." by 
G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

For greater certainty, for the purposes of the dilution calculation, AMCOR shall be deemed to receive 
credit for Expenditures incurred by Archean Star during the period from the date of exercise of the 
Option until the JV Formation Date.  For example, if Archean Star has incurred Expenditures totaling 
US$20,000,000 as at the JV Formation Date, then AMCOR shall be deemed to have incurred 
US$5,000,000 of Expenditures. 

2.3 Conversion of Joint Venture Interest.  If AMCOR's or Archean Star's Joint Venture Interest is 
reduced to 10% or less, then AMCOR's or Archean Star's, as the case may be, Joint Venture Interest shall 
be converted to a 1% Net Smelter Returns royalty, as provided for in Schedule "F" to the Agreement, 
which shall be reduced by the amount of any underlying royalty payable on the Property.  The Joint 
Venture shall terminate upon such conversion, and the surviving Party shall become the sole owner of a 
100% interest in the Property subject to the Net Smelter Returns royalty and any other royalties under 
the Mining Lease.  The surviving party shall have a right of first refusal to match any third party offer to 
purchase the royalty.  

3. MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE 

3.1 Establishment.  Promptly upon the formation of the Joint Venture, the Parties shall establish the 
Management Committee.  One Representative and one alternate shall be appointed in writing by each 
Party and re-appointed from time to time. 

3.2 Powers and Obligations.  Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, the 
Management Committee is empowered to make all strategic and planning decisions regarding the Joint 
Venture.  Accordingly, the Management Committee is responsible for revising Programs submitted by 
the Operator, for approving all Programs and for evaluating the results of all Programs. 

3.3 Calling of Meetings.  Meetings of the Management Committee shall be held in Vancouver, 
British Columbia at such place, time and date as may be determined by the Operator or the non-
Operator on at least 15 days' notice.  The Representatives may waive the notice period required for any 
meeting.  Any notice must include the time, date, place and agenda of each meeting.  On receipt of any 
such notice, the receiving Party may add any item to the agenda, if the receiving Party notifies the other 
Party of the addition at least 7 days before the meeting.  No item which is not on the agenda may be 
discussed without the consent of the Representatives.  Individuals other than the Representatives may 
attend meetings of the Management Committee with the unanimous consent of the Representatives. 

3.4 Attendance at Meeting by Phone.  Any Representative may attend a meeting of the 
Management Committee by telephone or video conference call. 

3.5 Quorum at Meetings.  The quorum for any meeting of the Management Committee is one 
Representative from each of the Parties.  If a quorum is not present at the date, time and place set for a 
meeting, then the meeting shall be adjourned to the same place and time on the same day of the 
following week.  At the continuation of the adjourned meeting the Management Committee may 
conduct business, if a notice regarding the continuation of the adjourned meeting was sent to the Party 



77 

 

"The Geology & Mineralization at the Cu-Au-Ag Monitor Mine Property, Eastern Coeur d'Alene Mining District, Idaho." by 
G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

whose Representative did not attend the meeting as originally scheduled.  In no other circumstance may 
business be transacted at a meeting of the Management Committee without a quorum being present. 

3.6 Chairman and Secretary of Meetings.  The initial chairman of the Management Committee (the 
"Chairman") shall be determined by Archean Star and thereafter designated annually by the Party with 
the greater Joint Venture Interest.  The Chairman shall appoint a secretary to act as a secretary of the 
Management Committee at the beginning of each meeting of the Management Committee.  Such 
secretary shall carry out the duties of the secretary of the Management Committee until such 
secretary's replacement is appointed.  The secretary shall prepare and maintain minutes of each 
meeting of the Management Committee.  The secretary shall distribute to the Representatives such 
minutes, as soon as practicable following each meeting.  The secretary shall also maintain, and distribute 
to the Representatives, copies of all correspondence and instruments received, sent or signed by the 
Management Committee or the Representatives (when acting in the capacity of a Representative). 

3.7 Making Decisions.  All decisions of the Management Committee shall be by majority vote by the 
two voting Representatives, who shall each have the number of votes equal to such Representative's 
respective Party's Joint Venture Interest from time to time.  In the event of an equality of votes, the 
Operator's Representative shall have an additional and casting vote.  Alternatively, the Management 
Committee may transact any business by a written instrument signed by a Representative of each Party.  
Each decision of the Management Committee shall be final and binding on the Parties. 

3.8 Consent of Management Committee Required.  Notwithstanding any term in this Agreement, 
the Operator shall not take any of the following actions without obtaining the prior written consent of 
Parties holding at least a 60% Joint Venture Interest: 

(a) create, or permit to remain, any material Liens, upon any Joint Venture Asset, except for any 
Liens which are customary in the circumstances of an mining joint venture;  

(b) settle any suit, claim or demand with respect to the Joint Venture involving an amount in excess 
of $100,000; or 

(c) abandon, sell or otherwise dispose of a Joint Venture Asset having a net book value greater than 
$100,000 or, if related to normal business operations, a net book value greater than $250,000. 

The Operator shall not abandon, sell or otherwise dispose of the Property, or any material part thereof 
without obtaining the prior written consent of Parties holding 100% of the Joint Venture Interests. 

T4. HE OPERATOR, ITS POWERS AND OBLIGATIONS 

4.1 Initial Operator.  Upon the formation of the Joint Venture, Archean Star shall be the first 
Operator. 

4.2 Resignation and Replacement.  The Operator may resign as Operator upon notifying the non-
Operator in writing of its resignation at any time after a Program has been approved by the 



78 

 

"The Geology & Mineralization at the Cu-Au-Ag Monitor Mine Property, Eastern Coeur d'Alene Mining District, Idaho." by 
G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

Management Committee but before the commencement of the implementation of such Program, or at 
any time if no Program is being carried out at that time.  The Operator shall be deemed to have resigned 
if: 

(a) the Operator materially defaults in its obligations as operator hereunder and fails to commence 
and diligently prosecute measures to remedy such default within 30 days after the non-Operator shall 
have given written notice to the Operator of such default specifying in such notice the nature of the 
default;  

(b) the Joint Venture Interest of the Operator becomes less than 50%; or 

(c) pursuant to Section 6.1 of this Schedule "C", during the period of the Second Option, the 
Operator fails to submit a Program requiring minimum Expenditures of at least $100,000 to the 
Management Committee within six months of the completion of the previous Program and the non-
Operator commits to such Program and the Expenditures required therein.  

(d) pursuant to Section 6.1 of this Schedule "C", Archean Star, the Operator fails to submit a 
Program requiring minimum Expenditures of at least $1,000,000 in each calendar year thereafter to the 
Management Committee within six months of the completion of the previous Program and the non-
Operator commits to such Program and the Expenditures required therein. In the event of the 
occurrence of (c) or (d) above, the Party that was previously the non-Operator shall have the right within 
a period of 90 days of the occurrence of such event to prepare and deliver to the Management 
Committee a Program requiring minimum Expenditures outlined in  (c) or (d) above and the provisions 
of this Section 4.2 and Section 7 of this Schedule "C" shall for all purposes of this Schedule "C" apply 
mutatis mutandis as if for such Program the non-Operator was the Operator, provided further that 
notwithstanding the foregoing, Archean Star so long as it retains at least a 50% interest in the Joint 
Venture, shall continue to have the right to retain its position as Operator in accordance with this 
Section 4.2 following completion of a Program by the non-Operator. 

On any change or replacement of the Operator, the retiring Operator shall transfer all data, documents, 
reports, records, accounts, samples and assays in its possession or control, and relating to the Mining 
Operations or the Property, to the incoming Operator. 

4.3 Powers and Obligations.  Subject to the approval of each Program by the Management 
Committee and to funds being advanced by the Parties who have elected to contribute to such Program, 
the powers and obligations of the Operator shall be as follows: 

(a) to manage the Joint Venture and conduct, or cause to be conducted, all work performed under 
a Program in a a careful and miner-like manner in accordance with good exploration, engineering and 
mining practice and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;

(c) subject to Section 3.8 of this Schedule "C", to keep the Property in good standing and to pay all 
applicable payments, fees and taxes, and other similar governmental charges lawfully levied or assessed 
in respect of the Property, except that the Operator shall not be obliged, however, to make any such 
payment as long as such payment is being contested in good faith and the non-payment thereof does 
not adversely affect the Property;  

(d) subject to Sections 8, 9 and 10 of this Schedule "C", to provide, purchase, lease or rent all plant, 
buildings, machinery, equipment, tools, appliances, materials, supplies and services required for a 
Program and to dispose of the same when no longer required or useful for the purposes of the Property 
and the Joint Venture;  

(e) to maintain and keep the Joint Venture Assets, or to cause the Joint Venture Assets to be 
maintained and kept, in good operating condition and repair in accordance with good exploration and 
mining practice;  

(f) to open and maintain a bank account for the Joint Venture for Expenditures incurred and 
revenue received in connection with the Property.

governmental authority affecting the Joint Venture;  

(h) to obtain and maintain such types and levels of property and liability insurance with respect to 
the Joint Venture as the Operator shall consider necessary from time to time, such coverage to include 
the non-Operator as a named insured to the extent of the non-Operator's undivided interest in the Joint 
Venture from time to time;  

(i) to require the Operator's contractors and subcontractors to take out and maintain such types 
and levels of property and liability insurance as the Operator shall consider necessary or advisable from

per year to make such available to the non-Operator, at the place designated by the Operator, within 
ten days of receipt of a written request for disclosure by the non-Operator;  

(l) to provide the non-Operator with monthly reports on activities on the Property during periods 
of active field work or when mine operations are active, quarterly reports and a detailed annual report 
on the Operator's management of the Joint Venture, including an accounting of all Expenditures made 
by the Operator under the current or previous Program;  

(m) to permit the non-Operator, at the non-Operator's sole risk and expense and with prior notice 
to the Operator, access to the Property during normal working hours for the purpose of examining 
activities and work thereon so long as such access shall not materially interfere with or impair such 
activities and work;  

(n) to have all powers necessary to carry out, or cause to be carried out, all of the Operator's 
obligations set out in this Agreement and to otherwise carry out, or cause to be carried out, all Programs 
approved by the Management Committee; and 

5. ESTABLISHMENT OF OPCO 

The Operator may, at any time, establish an operating company, as a wholly-owned subsidiary ("Opco"), 
to hire the labour and contractors necessary to construct and operate the mine subject to the Operator 
being responsible for the performance and obligations of Opco.  The Operator may delegate those of its 
obligations and, to the extent necessary, rights hereunder, to Opco necessary for Opco to carry out its 
objectives, subject to withdrawal of that delegation at any time by Notice in writing from Operator to 
Opco.  As Opco's assumption of specific duties regarding mine construction and operation will obviate 
the need for the Operator to perform some or all of the work, the Operator will, in good faith, review 
and, if appropriate, adjust the Operator's charge under Section  6.1(b) of this Schedule "C". 

6. REIMBURSEMENT OF OPERATOR 

6.1 Costs.  The Operator shall be reimbursed by the joint venture participants for any Costs it incurs 
in carrying out approved exploration programs, capital plans and mine operating plans or otherwise 
carrying out its duties as Operator.  "Costs" means 

(a) all costs, payments, expenses, charges and outlays, direct and indirect, made or incurred by the 
Operator on or in respect of the Claims after commencement of this joint venture including taxes, duties 
and imposts; and 

(b) administrative services, head office overhead and use of the Operator's corporate infrastructure 
shall not be charged directly in Section 6.1.  Rather, the Operator shall be entitled to an Operator's fee 
on the Costs contemplated in Section  6.1 of: 

(i) 12% of Costs incurred prior to a Decision to Mine; and 



81 

 

"The Geology & Mineralization at the Cu-Au-Ag Monitor Mine Property, Eastern Coeur d'Alene Mining District, Idaho." by 
G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

(ii) 3% on Costs incurred after the date of the Decision to Mine; 

subject in each case to review and adjustment, if any, under   The fee has been established on the basis 
that the party acting as Operator shall not profit nor suffer a loss by virtue of providing these services.  
The fee shall not be subject to audit but may be reviewed, in good faith, by the parties from time to 
time, at the instance of either party. 

6.2 Emergencies.  In an emergency, the Operator, without the consent of the non-Operator, may 
take such immediate actions and make such immediate Expenditures as the Operator deems necessary 
to keep the Property in good standing or for the protection of individuals and/or property.  The 
Operator shall promptly report such emergency actions and Expenditures to the non-Operator by 
delivering an invoice to the non-Operator.  The non-Operator shall pay its share of the Expenditures to 
the Operator in accordance with Section 7.4 of this Schedule "C". 

6.3 Contingency Fund.  The Operator may establish and administer a contingency fund to be 
applied by the Operator to satisfy any legal obligations of the Parties respecting a mine maintenance 
plan or mine closure plan, including obligations for severance pay, pensions, rehabilitation and 
reclamation work.  Each Party shall contribute its proportionate share of such fund based on such 
Party's Joint Venture Interest at the time of the establishment of the fund (or at the time of the 
contribution, in respect of subsequent contributions).  The Operator shall invest any unused portion of 
such fund and all income thereon shall accrue in such fund.  If the Operator determines that such fund, 
or any portion thereof, is no longer necessary, the Operator shall make payments to the Parties in 
proportion to their contribution to such contingency fund on the date of such payments. 

7. PROGRAMS 

7.1 Contents of Program.  The Operator shall prepare a Program and submit such Program budget 
to the Management Committee for approval at least 30 days before the beginning of each calendar 
year.  The Management Committee must approve each Program prior to implementation.  Each 
Program shall cover a period of up to 12 months or such other period as the Parties may agree.  Each 
Program must contain: 

(a) a reasonably detailed outline of all work which the Operator contemplates carrying out on the 
Property under such Program detailing the areas on the Property to be subject to such work and the 
time frame for each of the major elements of such work;  

(b) a reasonably itemized budget, broken down by month, of the projected Expenditures under the 
Program; and 

(c) the estimated amount and date of each payment that the non-Operator would have to make to 
the Operator.

G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

7.2 Election by Representatives.  If the Operator proposes a Program which is approved by the 
Management Committee: 

(a) for $1,000,000 or lesser amounts, the Representatives shall then have 60 days to elect whether 
or not to participate in the Program; or 

(b) for more than $1,000,000, the Representatives shall then have 90 days to elect whether or not 
to participate in the Program.  

7.3 Approved Programs.  The Operator shall carry out each Program approved by the Management 
Committee provided the Parties who have elected to contribute to such Program provide the Operator 
with their proportionate share of the funding in respect of the Program. 

7.4 Payments to Operator.  If a Representative elects to participate in a Program on behalf of a 
Party, the Operator will submit an invoice to such Representative on or between the first and 15th day 
of the month immediately preceding a month in which Expenditures are to be made under a Program.  
The invoice must set out the estimated Expenditures under the Program for the immediately following 
month, multiplied by the Joint Venture Interest of such Party.  Within 30 days of receipt of such invoice, 
such Party shall pay the Operator the invoice amount.  The Operator may also submit other invoices 
relating to reconciliations, bills, accounts or other requests for payment in respect of any Expenditures 
made by the Operator under a Program or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement.  Such invoice 
must set out the total amount involved, multiplied by the participating Party's Joint Venture Interest.  
Within 30 days of receipt of such invoice, such Party shall pay the Operator the invoice amount.  If such 
Party fails to make any payment to the Operator under this Section 7.4 of this Schedule "C" within any 
applicable 30 day payment period, after previously having elected to do so, such Party shall make such 
payment together with an interest payment, calculated at the rate equal to the annual rate of interest 
announced from time to time by the Bank of Montreal as its reference rate then in effect for 
determining interest rates on Canadian dollar commercial loans in Canada (commonly known as its 
prime rate), plus 5%, for the period commencing on the expiry of such 30 day payment period and 
terminating on the date that full payment is made.  If such Party fails to make full payment, including in 
respect of interest, to the Operator within 60 days of the expiry of the applicable 30 day payment 
period, Section 7.6 of this Schedule "C" applies. 

7.5 Failure to Participate.  Subject to Sections 7.7 and 7.8 of this Schedule "C", if a Party does not 
elect to participate in a Program, its Joint Venture Interest shall be diluted with respect to Expenditures 
made in respect of such Program in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Schedule "C". 

7.6 Failure to Make Payment by non-Operator.  Subject to Sections 7.7 and 7.8 of this 
Schedule "C", if a Party which has elected to participate in a Program fails to make a required payment 
within the 60 day period referred to in Section 7.4 of this Schedule "C", such Party's Joint Venture 
Interest shall be diluted with respect to Expenditures made in respect of such Program at a rate of two 
times normal dilution.

G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

7.7 Failure to Spend at Least 80% of Budget.  If a Party does not elect to participate in a Program 
and the Operator does not make Expenditures under the Program at least equal to 80% of budgeted 
Expenditures, the non-participating Party shall not have its Joint Venture Interest reduced in accordance 
with Section 2.2 of this Schedule "C" if the non-participating Party pays the Operator within 60 days, 
following the completion of such Program, an amount equal to the total Expenditures made under such 
Program, multiplied by the non-participating Party's Joint Venture Interest, determined at the 
commencement of such Program. 

7.8 Expenditures More Than 10% Above Budget.  Expenditures made by the Operator exceeding 
the Expenditures contemplated by the Program by less than 10% will be funded by the Parties in 
proportion to their Joint Venture Interests.  Expenditures made by the Operator exceeding the 
Expenditures contemplated by the Program by more than 10% will be funded solely by the Operator, 
unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing.  Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, any 
such payments exceeding the Expenditures contemplated by the Program by more than 10% which are 
made by either the Operator or the non-Operator will not form part of the calculations used to 
determine the Joint Venture Interests of the Parties in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Schedule "C". 

7.9 Return of Surplus Monies.  If, after completion of any Program, the Operator is in possession of 
any moneys contributed by the Parties and which are not required for the discharge of obligations 
relating to such Program, the Operator shall repay such moneys to the contributing Parties. 

7.10 Failure to Submit Program to Management Committee.  If the Operator does not submit a 
Program involving Expenditures of at least $100,000 to the Management Committee for approval within 
a period of at least six months from the date of completion of the last Program (being when the report is 
complete and delivered to the non-Operator), then the non-Operator may propose a Program to the 
Management Committee for an amount not less than $100,000.  If the non-Operator makes such a 
proposal and the Program is approved by the Management Committee, the Operator shall carry out 
such Program and fund its proportionate share.  If the Management Committee does not approve such 
Program, the non-Operator may, notwithstanding Section 4.2 of this Schedule "C", become the Operator 
and carry out the Program.  Following the completion of such Program Section 4.2 of this Schedule "C" 
shall apply once again.  

8. DEALINGS WITH AFFILIATES 

Any Joint Venture Assets that the Operator may purchase, lease or rent from an Affiliate shall be 
purchased, leased or rented at fair market value.  The cost of all work which the Operator may contract 
to an Affiliate shall be equal to the fair market value of such work.  Any Joint Venture Assets that the 
Operator may sell or otherwise dispose of to an Affiliate shall be sold or otherwise disposed of at fair 
market value.  The Operator shall pay the net proceeds received in respect of such Joint Venture Assets, 
if any, to the Parties in proportion to their respective Joint Venture Interests.  The Operator shall give 
the non-Operator written notice of any transaction with an Affiliate and the non-Operator may, at any

time within 12 months after it has received such notice, dispute whether such transaction was at fair 
market value. 

9. USE OF SURPLUS JOINT VENTURE ASSETS 

Subject to Section 5.4 of this Schedule "C", the Operator may use any Joint Venture Assets which are no 
longer required for the Joint Venture for such other purposes and on such terms as the Operator may 
from time to time determine.  The Operator shall pay the net proceeds received in respect of such Joint 
Venture Assets, if any, to the Parties in proportion to their respective Joint Venture Interests.  If such 
surplus Joint Venture Assets are used by the Operator, outside the scope of the Joint Venture, or are 
used by an Affiliate of the Operator, outside the scope of the Joint Venture, then the net proceeds in 
respect of such use shall be deemed to be an amount equal to what could be obtained from an arms-
length third party. 

10. DISPOSITION OF SURPLUS JOINT VENTURE ASSETS 

Subject to Section 3.8 and 6.4 of this Schedule "C", the Operator shall provide quarterly interim financial 
statements and annual audited financial statements to the Joint Venture parties in accordance with 
National Instrument 51-102. If it is established from the financial statements that there is a distributable 
profit, or Joint Venture Assets as are no longer required for Joint Venture operations, the Operator shall 
report this to the Management Committee who can then determine whether, subject to Section 17, to sell 
or otherwise dispose of such part of the Joint Venture Assets that are no longer required for Joint Venture 
Operations.  The Operator shall pay the Net Proceeds (as calculated in Schedule "G" to this Agreement) 
received in respect of such Joint Venture Assets, if any, to the Parties in proportion to their respective 
Joint Venture Interests, within 30 days of the sale and receipt of the Net Proceeds. 

11. INSURANCE PROCEEDS 

The Operator shall apply, to the extent determined by the Operator, any insurance proceeds received by 
the Operator in respect of any loss or damage to Joint Venture Assets towards the repair or replacement 
of the lost or damaged Joint Venture Assets.  The Operator shall pay the remaining proceeds received in 
respect of such Joint Venture Assets, if any, to the Parties in proportion to their respective Joint Venture 
Interests. 

12. SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS 

Subject to Section 3.8(c) of this Schedule "C", all losses, costs, expenses, claims or damages, including 
legal fees and disbursements, net of any insurance proceeds, incurred and paid by the Operator in 
settlement of any loss, cost, expense, claim, damage, judgment or similar matter (including a payment 
made, or an action taken, by the Operator as a result of an action of a governmental agency) shall 
constitute an Expenditure made by the Operator under the applicable Program.  In addition, the non-
Operator, in proportion to its Joint Venture Interest calculated on the date that the initial liability was 
incurred which gives rise to this indemnification obligation, shall indemnify and hold harmless the 
Operator for any loss, cost, expense, claim or damage, including legal fees and disbursements, suffered

or incurred by the Operator in respect of a third party claim (including an action of a governmental 
agency which results in a payment made, or an action taken, by the Operator), except to the extent that 
such claim arose from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Operator. 

13. LIABILITY OF OPERATOR 

The Operator shall not be liable to the non-Operator for any loss, cost, expense, claim or damage, 
including legal fees and disbursements, (including a payment made, or an action taken, by the Operator 
as a result of an action of a governmental agency) except to the extent that such loss, cost, expense, 
claim or damage is attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Operator.  In no 
event (including fundamental breach) shall the Operator be liable to the non-Operator for any indirect, 
special or consequential damages (including for loss of goodwill, loss of actual or anticipated profits or 
other economic loss), even if the Operator has been advised of the potential for such damages. 

14. NO RESTRICTION ON OTHER ACTIVITIES 

Each Party has the unrestricted right to engage in, and receive the full benefit of, any activity outside the 
scope of the Joint Venture, without consulting with, or accounting to, the other Party, or permitting the 
other Party to participate in such activity. 

15. TERMINATION 

If the Parties agree to terminate the Joint Venture, the Operator may take any actions necessary or 
desirable to wind up the Joint Venture.  All costs, charges and expenses of winding up the Joint Venture 
(including in respect of any reclamation) shall be for the account of the Joint Venture and the Parties 
shall divide the net Joint Venture Assets in proportion to their Joint Venture Interests, although any 
loans advanced to the Joint Venture by a Party shall be satisfied before any other distribution of assets is 
made to the Parties.  Once the said costs, charges and expenses have been paid in full, the Operator 
may sell the Joint Venture Assets, in accordance with Section 3.8 of this Schedule "C", or distribute the 
Joint Venture Assets to the Parties in kind. 

16. WITHDRAWAL FROM JOINT VENTURE 

16.1 Right of Withdrawal and Mechanics.  Either Party may, at any time during the Joint Venture, 
voluntarily withdraw from the Joint Venture (the "Withdrawing Party") and forfeit its interest in and to 
the Property and its rights under this Agreement by giving written notice of such withdrawal to the 
other Party (the "Remaining Party").  The notice must indicate an effective date for such withdrawal 
which may not be earlier than 90 days after receipt of such notice.  The effects of the delivery of such 
notice are set out below. 

(a) The Withdrawing Party shall:  

(i) remain liable for its share, based on its Joint Venture Interest, of all costs, expenses and 
obligations arising out of operations conducted before the effective date of the withdrawal;

G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

(ii) secure by way of a letter of credit, or otherwise to the satisfaction of the Remaining Party, its 
share, based on its Joint Venture Interest, of the costs of reclaiming the Property, as estimated at the 
effective date of the withdrawal considering all applicable statutes, regulations, by-laws, laws, orders 
and judgments and with all directives, rules, consents, permits, orders, guidelines, approvals and policies 
of any governmental authority; 

(iii) continue, for a period of three years after the effective date of the withdrawal, to be bound by 
Section 12 of this Schedule "C"; 

(iv) execute and deliver such documents as may be necessary to transfer the Property to the 
Remaining Party; 

(v) remove, within 12 months of the effective date of the withdrawal, all buildings, machinery, 
equipment and supplies brought upon the Property by the Withdrawing Party that are not Joint Venture 
Assets; and 

(vi) not be entitled to any royalty under this Agreement. 

(b) The Remaining Party shall become the owner of a 100% of the Withdrawing Party's interest in 
and to the Property as of the effective date of the withdrawal.  

(c) The Joint Venture shall be terminated and the Management Committee shall be terminated, as 
of the effective date of the withdrawal.  

16.2 Right of Remaining Party to Withdraw.  Upon receipt by the Remaining Party of a notice of 
withdrawal, the Remaining Party may give notice to the Withdrawing Party prior to the effective date of 
the withdrawal electing to join in the withdrawal ("Joint Withdrawal").  In such case, the Joint Venture 
shall be terminated in accordance with Section 15 of this Schedule "C". 

17. RIGHTS TO MINERAL PRODUCTS 

17.1 Each Party shall own and have the right, privilege and power to take in kind and separately 
dispose of a portion of all mineral products produced from the Property, in accordance with its Joint 
Venture Interest.  The Operator shall designate and notify the Parties of the points of delivery situated 
on the Property for the Parties respective Joint Venture shares of such Mineral Product and all costs in 
respect of such mineral products shall be for the account of the Joint Venture, until such mineral 
products are delivered to such points.  After such mineral products are delivered to such points each 
Party shall pay its own costs in respect of such mineral products.  The Operator shall use its best efforts 
to ensure that each Party receives product of like quality. 

17.2 The Operator shall have no obligation in respect of the Parties' mineral products after delivery 
of such mineral products to the point of delivery provided, however, that if a Party is prepared to sell its 
mineral products at the same time and on the same terms and conditions as the Operator is selling its 
own mineral products and so advises the Operator the Operator may, but is not obligated to, act as an

agent for the Non-Operator in relation to the sale of the Non-Operator's mineral products on the terms 
and conditions that are equivalent to the terms and conditions obtained for its own mineral products.  If 
the Operator elects to act as agent for the Non-Operator, it may discontinue such agency at any time 
upon giving the Non-Operator 30 days advance notice.  If the Operator, while acting as the Non-
Operator's agent, is of the opinion that 100% of its own mineral products and 100% of the Non-
Operator's mineral products available for sale cannot be sold at the same time for revenue deemed 
acceptable by the Operator, the Operator shall arrange for sales of a lesser amount of each Party's 
mineral products on a pro rata basis.  In the event that the Operator acts as an agent for the Non-
Operator, the Operator shall be entitled to sale commissions equal to prevailing rates charged by other 
agents for effecting similar sales.  In the event of a non-arm's length sale of mineral products, such sale 
shall be at commercially competitive rates. 

18. FORCE MAJEURE 

A party may claim force majeure if such party is prevented from or delayed in performing any obligation 
under this Agreement by any cause beyond its reasonable control, excluding only lack of finances, but 
including, without limitation, acts of God, strikes, lockouts, or other industrial disputes, laws, rules and 
regulations or orders of any duly constituted court or governmental authority, acts of terrorism, acts of 
the public enemy, war, insurrection, riots, fire, storm, flood, unusually harsh weather causing delay, 
explosion, government restriction, failure to obtain any approvals required from regulatory authorities 
or unavailability of equipment, materials or transportation (provided the approvals were properly 
applied for and pursued in good faith and on a timely basis or the equipment, materials or 
transportation were sought in a timely way), any delay by a regulatory authority in renewing a tenure to 
the Property or, where a party is entitled thereto, to a higher form of tenure being issued (provided 
applications therefor were made reasonably in advance of the tenure due date and pursued in good 
faith), interference by third party interests groups (including environmental lobbyists or indigenous 
peoples' groups) or other causes whether of the kind enumerated above or otherwise, then the time for 
the performance of that obligation shall be extended for a period equivalent to the total period the 
cause of the prevention or delay persists regardless of the length of such total period.  A party may also 
claim force majeure, if such party, acting reasonably, believes that social or political unrest in the region 
of the Property or the threat of that unrest will endanger the safety of its employees or the employees 
of its contractors if the party were to continue with the work program unless such social or political 
unrest is caused by action or inaction by that party.  The party that claims force majeure shall promptly 
notify the other party and shall take all reasonable steps to remove or remedy the cause of the 
prevention or delay insofar as it is reasonably able to do so and as soon as possible.  The party claiming 
force majeure will provide the other party with a regular a written report summarizing events that have 
occurred and prospects for resolution.

19. ARBITRATION 

19.1 If any question, difference or dispute shall arise between the Parties or any of them in respect of 
any matter arising under this Agreement or in relation to the construction hereof the same shall be 
determined by the award of one arbitrator to be named as follows: 

(a) the Party or Parties sharing one side of the dispute shall name a representative to select an 
arbitrator and give notice thereof to the Party or Parties sharing the other side of the dispute;  

(b) the Party or Parties sharing the other side of the dispute shall, within 14 days of receipt of the 
notice, name a representative to select an arbitrator; and 

(c) the two representatives so named shall, within 30 days of the naming of the latter of them, 
select a third person who shall act as arbitrator.  

The decision of the arbitrator shall be made within 60 days after selection.  The expense of the 
arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties to the dispute.  If the Parties on either side of the 
dispute fail to name their representative within the time limited or fail to proceed with the arbitration, 
reference for appointment of an arbitrator shall be made to the British Columbia International 
Arbitration Centre.  The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the 
Commercial Arbitration Act (British Columbia), and the decision of the arbitrator shall be conclusive and 
binding upon all the Parties.

SCHEDULE "D" – MINING LEASE NET SMELTER RETURNS 

Article 8 of the amended Mining Lease 

Royalty Schedule.  AMCOR shall pay NALLC a net smelter royalty ("NSR") on all development and 
production ores and minerals extracted, milled, and sold from the Property as shown in the following 
table: 

Value Per Ton NSR 

Less than $500/per ton 2% 

$500/per ton or more 3% 

 

NSR Payment.  The NSR shall be determined by the actual payment for the ores by the smelter, refinery, 
or buyer less reasonable charges for concentrate transportation and insurance.  The quarterly payment 
to AMCOR shall be made on or before the 30th day of the third month following each calendar quarter. 

Royalty Statements.  Due on the same day as the NSR payment, AMCOR shall provide NALLC with a 
royalty statement ("Royalty Statement") which details the amount of ores, minerals, or other products 
sold or processed and a detailed compilation of the payment due. 

Examination and/or audit.  NALLC may require an independent audit by a certified public accountant 
("CPA") or accounting firm that is acceptable to both parties of the Royalty Statement and all records 
related to concentrate or product sales.  If the audit discloses a substantial discrepancy(ies), defined as 
discrepancy(ies) resulting in an underpayment to NALLC of five percent (5%) or more of the NSR due or 
an ongoing history of significant underpayment to NALLC, the cost of the audit shall be paid by AMCOR.  
If the audit fails to disclose a substantial discrepancy(ies), the cost of the audit shall be paid by NALLC.  
AMCOR shall keep appropriate records detailing the amount, source, and assay of ores, minerals, or 
other products recovered, processed, sold, or shipped and the amount and source of payment received. 

Commingling of Ore.  AMCOR may commingle ore from the Property with ore from other properties, 
either before or after concentration or beneficiation, so long as the data necessary to determine the 
weight and grade, both of the ore removed from the Leased Premises and the ore with which it is 
commingled, are obtained by AMCOR.  All such weight, grade and allocation calculations by AMCOR 
shall be done in a manner recognized by the mining industry as practical and sufficient at that time. 

Treatment at AMCOR's Processing Facilities.  AMCOR shall have the right to purchase and to treat 
concentrates and smelting ores produced from the Property at its own metallurgical facility; however, 
that any such purchase and treatment shall be made under comparable terms as the metallurgical 
facility is then offering to other shippers of concentrates and smelting ores or purchases of like 
quantities and qualities.

G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

Advance Royalty Payments.  NALLC and AMCOR confirm that an advance royalty payment of $25,000 
was paid to NALLC at the time of the execution of the letter of intent between AMCOR and NALLC. 

In addition, AMCOR shall pay an annual advance minimum royalty of $10,000 on the first anniversary of 
this lease, $20,000 on the second anniversary, $30,000 on the third anniversary, $40,000 on the fourth 
anniversary, $50,000 on the fifth anniversary, and $50,000 on each anniversary thereafter.  The advance 
minimum royalty shall be paid on or before ten days after the anniversary date, and thereafter on or 
before ten days following the anniversary each succeeding year, and shall be deducted from future NSR 
payments that may be paid during that year.  

Disputes Regarding Royalties.  NALLC shall be deemed to have waived any right NALLC may have had to 
object to the royalty settlement made by AMCOR for any calendar quarter, unless NALLC notifies 
AMCOR in writing of such objection within twelve (12) months after such royalty is due under this Lease.  
The dispute or disagreement must list the specific items being contested and detail with particularity the 
grounds for each contest or dispute.  If NALLC and AMCOR are unable to resolve the question by 
agreement within thirty (30) days after AMCOR's receipt of NALLC's notice, the dispute shall be resolved 
by arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of Article 22 of the Mining Lease. 

Hedging/Future Market.  NALLC acknowledges that AMCOR may from time to time participate in 
hedging and/or metal futures markets and, further, NALLC agrees that all such activity shall be for the 
sole account of AMCOR and NALLC shall not share in any of the benefits or risks associated with such 
activity. 

Assays by NALLC.  NALLC may at any time and at its own expense assay samples of ore extracted by 
AMCOR.

SCHEDULE "F" – JOINT VENTURE NET SMELTER RETURNS 

1. For the purpose of this Schedule, "Agreement" shall mean the Agreement to which this Schedule is 
attached, "Owner" shall mean the party or parties paying a percentage of Net Smelter Returns 
pursuant to the Agreement and other capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to them in 
the Agreement. 

2. For the purposes of the Agreement and this Schedule, the term "Net Smelter Returns" shall, subject 
to paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 below, mean gross revenues received from the sale by the Owner of all 
ore mined from the Properties and from the sale by the Owner of concentrate, metal and products 
derived from ore mined from the Properties, after deduction of the following: 
 
a) all smelting and refining costs, sampling, assaying and treatment charges and penalties including 

but not limited to metal losses, penalties for impurities and charges for refining, selling and 
handling by the smelter, refinery or other purchaser (including price participation charges by 
smelters and/or refiners); 

b) costs of handling, transporting, securing and insuring such material from the Properties or from 
a concentrator, whether situated on or off the Properties, to a smelter, refinery or other place 
of treatment, and in the case of gold or silver concentrates, security costs; 

c) ad valorem taxes and taxes based upon sales or production, but not income taxes; and 
d) marketing costs, including sales commissions, incurred in selling ore mined from the Properties 

and from concentrate, metal and products derived from ore mined from the Properties. 
3. (a) Where revenue otherwise to be included under this Schedule is received by the Owner in a 

transaction with a Party with whom it is not dealing at arm's length, the revenue to be included shall 
be based on the fair market value under the circumstances and at the time of the transaction. 

(b) Where a cost otherwise deductible under this Schedule is incurred by the Owner in a transaction 
with a party with whom it is not dealing at arm's length, the cost to be deducted shall be the fair 
market cost under the circumstances and at the time of the transaction. 

4. For the purposes of determining Net Smelter Returns, all receipts and disbursements in a currency 
other than Canadian shall be converted into Canadian currency on the day of receipt or 
disbursement, as the case may be, and all other disbursements in a currency other than Canadian 
shall be converted into Canadian currency at the average rate for the month of disbursement 
determined using the Bank of Canada noon rates. 

5. The Owner and the person receiving a percentage of Net Smelter Returns hereby expressly agree 
that in no event shall the Owner have any liability to the person receiving a percentage of Net 
Smelter Returns as the result of the amount of revenues received by the Owner from any forward 
sales or other hedging activities engaged in and by the Owner with respect to ore concentrate, 
metal and products from the Properties.  In addition, the Owner and the person receiving a 
percentage of Net Smelter Returns agree that the Owner shall have no obligation, express or

"The Geology & Mineralization at the Cu-Au-Ag Monitor Mine Property, Eastern Coeur d'Alene Mining District, Idaho." by 
G.E. Ray.  NI 43-101 Technical Report for Archean Star Resources Inc., February 10th 2013. 

implied, to engage in (or not engage in) any forward sales or other hedging activities with respect to 
ore concentrate, metal or products from the Properties.  For greater certainty the person receiving a 
percentage of Net Smelter Returns will be paid for the amount of product actually produced from 
the Properties calculated according to paragraph 2 of this Schedule regardless of the hedging 
practices of the Owner. 

6. If the Properties is brought into commercial production, it may be operated as a single operation 
with other mining properties owned by third parties or in which the Owner has an interest, in which 
event, the parties agree that (notwithstanding separate ownership thereof) ores mined from the 
mining properties (including the Properties) may be blended at the time of mining or at any time 
thereafter; provided, however, that the respective mining properties shall bear and have allocated 
to them their proportionate part of costs described in paragraphs 2(a) to 2(d) above incurred 
relating to the single operation, and shall have allocated to each of them the proportionate part of 
the revenues earned relating to such single operation.  In making any such allocation, effect shall be 
given to the tonnages of ore and other material mined and beneficiated and the characteristics of 
such material including the metal content of ore removed from, and to any special charges relating 
particularly to ore, concentrates or other products or the treatment thereof derived from, any of 
such mining properties.  The Owner shall ensure that reasonable practices and procedures are 
adopted and employed for weighing, determining moisture content, sampling and assaying and 
determining recovery factors. 

7. Payments of a percentage of Net Smelter Returns shall be made within thirty (30) days after the end 
of each calendar quarter in which Net Smelter Returns, as determined on the basis of final adjusted 
invoices, are received by the Owner.  All such payments shall be made in Canadian dollars. 

8. In the year in which commercial production is commenced on the Properties, each person receiving 
a percentage of Net Smelter Returns from the Owner shall be provided quarterly within ninety days 
(90) after the end of each calendar quarter, with a copy of the calculation of Net Smelter Returns, 
determined in accordance with this Schedule, for the preceding calendar, certified correct by the 
Owner.  The person receiving a percentage of Net Smelter Returns shall have the right, upon serving 
thirty (30) days' notice to the Owner, to conduct an independent audit, at its sole cost, and the 
Owner will provide such materials and information as reasonably necessary to allow the audit to be 
performed. 

9. Nothing contained in the Agreement or any Schedule attached thereto shall be construed as 
conferring upon any person receiving a percentage of Net Smelter Returns any right to or beneficial 
interest in the Properties.  The right to receive a percentage of Net Smelter Returns from the Owner 
as and when due is and shall be deemed to be a contractual right only.  Furthermore, the right to 
receive a percentage of Net Smelter Returns by a party from the Owner as and when due shall not 
be deemed to constitute the Owner the partner, agent or legal representative of such party or to 
create any fiduciary relationship between them for any purpose whatsoever. 

10. The Owner shall be entitled to (i) make all operational decisions with respect to the methods and 
extent of mining and processing of ore, concentrate, metal and products produced from the 
Properties (for example, without limitation, the decision to process by heap leaching rather than

SCHEDULE "G" – NET PROCEEDS CALCULATION 

Income and Expenses.  For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Net Proceeds" shall be calculated 
by deducting from the gross revenues realized (or deemed to be realized) from the sale (or deemed 
sale) of Products, such costs and expenses attributable to Expenditures, Exploration, Development, 
Mining, mine construction costs, production financing costs, and the marketing of Products as would be 
deductible under International Financial Reporting Standards and practices consistently applied as 
employed by the Operator, including without limitation: 

(a) All costs and expenses of replacing, expanding, modifying, altering or changing from time to 
time the Mining facilities.  Costs and expenses of improvements (such as haulage ways or mill 
facilities) that are also used in connection with workings other than the Properties shall be 
charged to the Properties only in the proportion that their use in connection with the Properties 
bears to their total use. 

(b) Ad valorem real property and unsecured personal property taxes, and all taxes, other than 
income taxes, applicable to Mining of the Properties, including without limitation all state 
mining taxes, sales taxes, severance taxes, royalties, license fees and governmental levies of a 
similar nature. 

(c) Allowance for overhead. 
(d) All expenses incurred relative to the sale of Products, including an allowance for commissions at 

rates which are normal and customary in the industry. 
(e) All amounts payable to the Operator during Mining pursuant to any applicable operating or 

similar agreement in force with respect thereto. 
(f) The actual cost of investment prior to beginning of Mining which shall include all Expenditures 

for Exploration and Development of the Properties incurred by the Operator. 
(g) Interest on monies borrowed or advanced for costs and expenses, at an annual rate equal to five 

(5) percentage points above the Prime Rate, but in no event in excess of the maximum 
permitted by law. 

(h) An allowance for reasonable working capital and inventory. 
(i) Reasonably anticipated reclamation costs. 

It is intended that the Operator shall recoup from net cash flow all of its contributions for Expenditures, 
Exploration, Development, Mining, mine construction costs, production financing costs and marketing 
Products before any Net Proceeds are distributed to any person holding a Net Proceeds interest.  No 
deduction shall be made for income taxes, depreciation, amortization or depletion.  If in any year after 
the beginning of Mining of the Properties an operating loss relative thereto is incurred, the amount 
thereof shall be considered as and be included with outstanding costs and expenses and carried forward 
in determining Net Proceeds for subsequent periods.  If Products are processed by the Operator then, 
for purposes of calculating Net Proceeds, such Products shall be deemed conclusively to have been sold 
at a price equal to fair market value to arm's length purchasers and Net Proceeds relative thereto shall
