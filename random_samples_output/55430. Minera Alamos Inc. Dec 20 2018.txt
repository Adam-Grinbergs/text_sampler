1 Summary 

1.1 Project Overview 

The La Fortuna Project ("La Fortuna" or "Fortuna") is located within the Tamazula District of northwest 

Durango State, near to Durango-Sinaloa state line at approximately 25°19'N latitude and 107°52'W 

longitude. The Project can be reached by road from the city of Culiacan (capital of Sinaloa state – 

population just under 1 million) approximately 100 kilometers to the southwest.  Culiacan itself is 

situated 270 kilometers northwest of Mazatlan, a major port and tourist city, and 200 kilometers 

southeast of Los Mochis, another major port city. 

The climate is typical of north-western Mexico with hot summers and moderate to warm dry winters. 

The rainy season extends from July to early October and can bring 200 to 500 mm of rainfall. Exploration 

activities can be conducted year-round, although the rainy season can create some difficulties with 

respect to accessibility. 

Initial development of the La Fortuna Mine occurred in the late 1800's. Early accounts are often 

incomplete or conflicting.  However, detailed surveys and sampling of the underground adits, drifts and 

stopes were completed in the latter quarter of the 1900's. The San Fernando Mining Company  

completed extensive drilling during the 1990s which forms the basis of the current drillhole database.  In 

the late 2000s Castle Gold acquired the project and completed six (6) twin hole for the purposes of 

validating the data as part of a modern NI 43-101 cognizant program.    In May 2016 Mineral Alamos Inc. 

acquired the La Fortuna property from Argonaut Gold Inc. 

1.2 Geology and Mineralization 

La Fortuna lies within the Sierra Madre Occidental.  It is hosted by a granodioritic batholith exposed by 

erosion of overlying and intruded volcanic complexes.  The deposit itself consists of intrusive-related 

quartz-tourmaline breccias, assumed to be the late mineralization phase of a porphyry system.  The 

deposit is tabular in shape, dipping 30° to the west, and is up to 60m thick.  Late stage dykes cut through 

the mineralization.  The mineralization consists mainly of pyrite and chalcopyrite stockwork veinlets, 

fracture fillings, and disseminations within the breccias.  Gold and silver grains and minerals are present 

along the grain boundaries of the chalcopyrite and pyrite with the gold occurring as relatively coarse 

"free" grains associated, but not encapsulated, with pyrite 

The mineralization at La Fortuna can be best characterized as intrusion-related 'transitional' deposits, 

assumed to be the mineralized zone within an intrusion related model that occurs in the transition 

between porphyry mineralization and epithermal mineralization. 

1.3 Mineral Resource Estimates 

1.3.1 Data 

Extensive QAQC and data validation was performed in order to thoroughly verify the data from the 

1990's San Fernando drilling campaign.  Sample certificates from the program were reviewed in their 

entirety, and data comparisons were conducted to verify the included results.  This is in addition to the

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 2 

twinned holes drilled by Castle Gold.  The San Fernando drilling campaign was thoroughly modern in its 

methods, including QAQC procedures.  The author finds that the data is reliable for the purposes of this 

report.  

1.3.2 Resource Estimates 

A new mineral resource has been estimated for La Fortuna.  The estimate has been completed by Scott 

Zelligan, P.Geo., an independent Qualified Person (QP) as defined in NI 43-101.  The effective date of 

this resource estimate is July 13, 2018. 

The La Fortuna resource is comprised of a mineralized tabular volume intruded by barren dykes.  The 

resource estimate was prepared using GEOVIA Surpac™ software (version 6.3).  The estimate was 

conducted utilizing wireframes to domain the mineralized breccia separate from the barren cross-

cutting dykes.  Based on geometry as well as the nature of the grade distribution, the deposit was 

estimated as an upper zone and a lower zone.  Inverse-distance-cubed (ID3) was chosen to interpolate 

grade for gold, copper, and silver.  The density was set at 2.65 t/m3, based on a conservative rounding 

down from averaged density studies. 

The La Fortuna mineral resources were classified according to the Canadian Institute of Mining and 

Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.  For 

classification, consideration was given to drill and sample spacing, QAQC, deposit-type and 

mineralization continuity, surface and/or underground mineralization exposure, and/or prior mining 

experience.  With respect to resource classification of the La Fortuna deposit, a combination of a 

constraining wireframe and the search ellipse of the estimated block was employed to best capture the 

data density and therefore confidence of the estimated value. 

The reported mineral resources of the La Fortuna deposit are as follows:

1.4 Metallurgy 

1.4.1 Historic Testwork 

Two phases of preliminary metallurgical testwork were commissioned by San Fernando in 1995 which 

were directed towards "conventional" processing with fine grinding followed by an evaluation of gravity 

concentration, froth flotation and cyanidation. In 2008, Castle Gold retained SGS Lakefield Canada to 

perform further testwork to confirm historical results.  Preliminary findings included:  

• Gravity gold recoveries ranged from 70% to +80%, 

• Flotation gold recoveries achieved +95%, 



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 3 

• Ground ore direct cyanidation produced gold recoveries in the high 90s and silver from 50-

70%. 

• Coarse ore recoverable gold of 60% (or greater) at crush sizes of ¼ - ½ "  

During the 2008 test program. Samples of mineralized material (low and high grade) were also sent to 

Terra VisionTM for benchtop studies to determine the feasibility of using an automated DEXRT (dual x-

ray) ore sorter to separate gold mineralization into a high grade product and a lower grade waste 

stream.  The results indicated that 85%-90% of gold could be recovered into an upgraded concentrate 

with a mass recovery of 25%.  Following the completion of the benchtop studies, bulk samples obtained 

from an old adit at the Fortuna mine site were sent to be processed via a commercial scale continuous 

DEXRT machine in the Commodas lab in Germany.   The recovery curves for the tests demonstrated 

results quite similar to those obtained with the benchtop studies with the DEXRT sensors capable of 

differentiating mineralized material down to a sulphide content equivalent to approximately 0.3 g/t Au 

at crush sizes of 32-60mm.     

1.4.2 2016/17 Metallurgical Testwork Program 

The 2016/17 test programs confirmed that gold in La Fortuna deposit is recoverable by most 

conventional extraction techniques.  Although completed to a higher level of detail, this confirmed the 

results of historical work on the project. 

• Gold is associated with sulphide content (primarily pyrite with minor chalcopyrite), which 

creates an opportunity to upgrade low grade mineralization through ore sorting.   

• GRG testwork indicates potential for +80% gold recovery at 70-80 microns, which provides 

opportunity to recovery majority of gold content by cyanide leach of gravity concentrate.  

Expected production plant recoveries would be 60-80% of this value depending on where the 

centrifugal concentrator(s) is placed in the process. 

• Bulk flotation gold recoveries up to 98-99% are achievable at typical mass recoveries of 8-10%. A 

combination of gravity with flotation concentration creates a robust process for achieving high 

gold (high 90s), copper and silver recoveries despite variations in ore mineralization already 

encountered. 

• Ability to produce saleable copper concentrate (~20% Cu content) with copper recoveries of 

+90%. Removal of copper sulphides prior to downstream cyanidation (if required) significantly 

reduces overall process cyanide consumption due to removal of soluble copper species.  

• +90% gold contained in flotation concentrate reground to <75 microns.  

• Gold contained in gravity concentrate is leachable with extractions in the high 90s in 24 hours. 

Limited kinetics data indicates rapid leach within 8 to 12 hours.  

1.5 Environmental and Permitting 

Currently are no known existing environmental liabilities associated with the La Fortuna Project. The 

Project is located in a remote part of Durango State where mining has been carried out in the past and 



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 4 

where it is currently being pursued.  

In March 2017, the Company finalized a surface use agreement with local community representatives 

for the La Fortuna Project site, the result of the Company holding ongoing talks with landowners, 

hosting community meetings and negotiating with various stakeholders with the goal of receiving local 

support for a land access agreement.  The Company has secured surface access to a 235 Ha area which 

encompasses the envisioned mine pit, processing facility and all other necessary infrastructure to begin 

mining.  The surface rights agreement covers a period of up to 25 years during which time the Company 

will be required to pay annual rental payments while operating activities are ongoing. If deemed 

appropriate, an option to purchase the land outright will be considered by the Company. 

With the assistance of Mexico-based environmental consulting firm Consultoria Ambiental Vugalit, S.C., 

the Company finalized two permit applications for the La Fortuna project for submission to the 

government: the Environmental Impact Statement (Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental - MIA), and the 

Technical Justification Study (Estudio Tecnico Justificativo - ETJ). The most significant components of the 

two applications include: 

• Infrastructure Proposals: detailed plans covering site layout, areas of disturbance, access roads, 

camps, waste water, electricity generation/access, etc. have been submitted to provide a 

thorough understanding of the Project's impact on the area. 

• Mine Construction: a mine plan based on the current mineral resource has been submitted as 

well as all ancillary plan elements including access ramps, mine waste locations, storage of 

surface soil and mine fleet details. 

• Plant Design: based on the specifications of the grinding/flotation facility purchased in 2016, an 

overall plant design has been produced and submitted including design drawings detailing the 

civil, mechanical and electrical works. All required flowsheets summarizing estimated mass and 

volume flowrates are included. 

• Operational Plans: operation and maintenance procedures including workforce estimates, 

emissions controls, equipment maintenance, explosives use, and waste generation and 

management. 

• Closure Plans: specifying landscape performance goals, reclamation technologies, methods and 

plans and long-term monitoring and maintenance.  

The Company understands that upon review and final acceptance of these applications, the necessary 

permits allowing for the commencement of mine construction will be granted.  This is currently 

estimated for completion around the end of 2018. 

1.6 Mining 

Using a preliminary Whittle pit shell (based on 1,250 $US/oz gold, 2.50 $US/t mining, 30.00 $US/t 

processing, 95% recovery, 45 degree pit slopes) as a guide, a full open pit mine plan was completed. 

Mineralization at La Fortuna extends close to surface and is amenable to conventional open pit methods 

utilizing front-end loaders and trucks. Mine planning was completed assuming 5 metres bench heights in 

order to provide good ore/waste selectivity although the use of larger bench heights in zones consisting

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 5 

predominantly of waste should be considered as part of future optimization studies.  Overall average pit 

slopes with the benches/ramps in place are approximately 43° for three sides and 41° overall for the 

north wall. Rock competency is reasonable and higher pit slopes may be considered once the 

appropriate geotechnical information is available.  

Material from the pit benches was categorized according to grade baskets prior to the application of 

reasonable dilution and loss factors. Very High Grade ("VHG") and High Grade ("HG"), i.e. >1.6 g/t Au 

material, was assumed to be direct milling, whereas the Medium Grade ("MG") and Low Grade ("LG"),  

i.e. 0.8 – 1.6 g/t Au material, are stockpiled and upgraded via ore sorting.  Further optimization efforts 

should be aimed at cut-off grade optimization studies and the smoothing of waste mining activities.  No 

inferred resources were utilized in the PEA mine planning.  The proposed mill feed schedule shown is as 

follows:

Notes: 

1. Mill Feed totals include direct milling material (1,626,000 tonnes) and mid-grade stockpiled material upgraded 
starting in Year 3 via crushed ore sorting (372,400 tonnes). 

2. Mine dilution applied as follows – 10% for direct milling material (dilution grade equivalent to average grade 
of next lower mine grade basket) and 25% for low-grade material to stockpile (0.5 g/t Au dilution grade 

3. Total mined material values include all production from open pit mine (mineralization + waste) for noted 

intervals. 

4. Ore sorting of medium and low grade material is implemented in Year 3. 

Mineralized and waste material will be hauled approximately 500 metres (maximum) to the mineralized 

stockpile and waste dump locations near the mine.  Crushed stockpile material is then transported to 

the plant processing facilities located at a distance of less than 1.5 km from the mine.  All 

drilling/mining/crushing operations at La Fortuna will be accomplished via an open pit mining 

contractor.  Although the contractor will select the final equipment it is anticipated that trucks in the 25 

tonne range will be loaded with two front-end loaders in the 5m3 to 6m3 range.  Contractor availability 

in Mexico is currently high and rates are competitive. The mine will operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per 

week.   

Minera Alamos personnel will work with the contractor to provide survey control of the mining.  All blast 

holes will be sampled and the resulting assays used to guide the mining operations for the optimum 

separation of ore and waste.  Personnel will map and sample faces, using all the information to update 

sections and future bench plans.  Grade control staff will provide round-the-clock coverage.

1.7 Processing 

A simplified base case process was utilized for the La Fortuna PEA plant site.  Mineralized material from 

the mine is stockpiled and crushed to a size of <3/4" prior to being transported to the process plant.  

The overall processing facilities consist of a primary coarse grind to 80% passing 250-300 microns 

followed by a bulk sulphide concentrate flotation.  Bulk concentrate is reground (80 microns) prior to a 

final flotation producing a copper concentrate.  Centrifugal gravity gold recovery circuits are included in 

both the primary and concentrate reground circuits to extract free gold as a concentrate.  Tailings from 

the flotation circuit are dewatered via filtration and dry-stacked in the tailings containment area 

adjacent to the processing plant. 

Overall gold recovery for the PEA study has been conservatively estimated at 90%.  No final gold refining 

facilities are to be constructed at the Fortuna site although this decision can be revisited in the future 

should site production rates increase.  Approximately half of the gold is extracted as a gravity 

concentrate which will be cyanide leached at site and loaded onto activated carbon for shipping outside 

of Mexico for final dore production.  The other half of the recovered gold ends up in the copper flotation 

concentrate (along with the majority of the copper and silver) which is filtered and transported to the 

port facilities at Guaymas (approximately 500 km) for final sale.   

The Company has purchased a used 2000 tpd processing facility (grinding/flotation/filtration) that has 

been used as the basis for the Fortuna project processing facilities.  The size of the major equipment 

items allows for plant throughput to be increased from the currently assumed 1100 tpd rate as the size 

of the project resource increases.   DEXTR (x-ray) ore sorting has been included in the overall project 

plans as a method to upgrade mid-grade (0.8-2.0 g/t Au) mineralized material from the mine (and future 

potential project resources).  It is conservatively assumed that an ore sorting machine will be purchased 

and installed in Year 3 of mining operations to upgrade this material (3.5-4.0 g/t Au product at 

approximately 80% recovery).  During Years 1 and 2 the mined mid-grade material will be stockpiled for 

processing starting in Year 3.  In the current operations plan only 20% of the LOM contained gold ounces 

sent to the processing plant have been upgraded in this manner.

1.8 Capital and Operating Costs 

Much of the process plant has already been purchased and is containerised ready for transport to Mexico.  

The equipment purchased to date is oversized and in excess of current design requirements and is therefore 

considered more than adequate to handle the initial 1100tpd processing rate.   

The capital cost estimate was divided into "Pre-production" capital and production "Sustaining" capital.  

Pre-production capital includes all mine and process costs up to the initiation of commercial mining 

operations (75% of steady state production).  Total pre-production costs at the Fortuna Project are 

estimated at US$27 M.  Sustaining capital costs over the life of mine are estimated at US$7M for a total 

project capital cost of US$34M. To reduce the initial capital requirements, it was decided that used 

processing equipment will be incorporated wherever possible (currently widely available) and that all 

mining and crushing activities will be provided by third party contractors. A breakdown of the project capital 

costs is summarized as follows: 

Project Capital Cost Summary 

Area Initial  

(US$'000) 

Sustaining (US$'000) Total  

(US$'000) 

Mining (contractor mobilizations) 1,000  1,000 

Site Development/Infrastructure 3,500  3,500 

Mineral Processing 15,000 7,100 22,100 

Tailings Management 2,000  2,000 

Closure  3,000 3,000 

Salvage Value  (3,000) (3,000) 

 Contingencies (incl. owner's costs) 5,400  5,400 

 Total Project 26,900 7,100 34,000 

*Note: Start-up working capital to be provided by concentrate purchasers on credit revolver basis.  

The pre-production capital cost estimate of US$27M includes the construction of a stand-alone process 

facility, Phase 1 of the tailings storage facilities and all necessary site infrastructure to bring the mine into 

production.  A conservative 25% contingency has been included to account for capital requirements that are 

not detailed in the current study. 

The total unit operating costs for the project are estimated at $33.34 /tonne of mineralised material 

(includes G&A, concentrate shipping and treatment charges).  It should be noted that the decision to utilize 

contractors for mining and crushing has added somewhat to this cost.  Should the deposit resource grow in 

the future it may make sense to perform these activities in-house.  The life-of mine operating costs are as 

follows: 

Project Operating Cost Summary 

Area US$/tonne  
Mineralized Material*2 

US$/unit  

Open Pit Mining 11.80 2.15 per tonne mined 

Processing 15.95 22.89 per tonne milled 

Stockpile/Ore Sorting*1 1.73 4.00 per tonne sorted 

G&A 3.86 5.54 per tonne milled 

All-In OPEX 33.34

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 8 

Notes: 
1. "Ore Sorting" as used in the table above is a commercial term referring to sensor-based rock sorting technology 

and is not related to project resources/reserves.   Ore sorting equipment is implemented in Year 3 for upgrading of 

mid-grade stockpiles 

2. "Mineralized Material" represents mined material in excess of 0.8 g/t Au cut-off (includes direct milling material + 

stockpiled material to be upgraded upgraded via ore sorting prior to milling)  

 

Operating costs were developed based on estimated staffing levels, consumables (from testwork and 

modeling) and expenditures required to support the mine and its associated processing, maintenance and 

administrative activities.  Power requirements were estimated based on operating equipment motor sizes 

and plant availability, and costs assuming diesel generation with a delivered diesel fuel cost of $US 1 per 

litre.  An overall contingency of 20% was applied to the operating cost totals to account for additional cost 

items such as outside consultants, laboratory consumables, vehicle fuel requirements, etc.  

All mine operating activities are assumed to be the responsibility of a third party mine contractor. 

Contractor rates include drilling, blasting and transportation of the waste/ore. Costs for the Company mine 

services group were prepared separately and included separately.  Crushing was assumed to be the 

responsibility of a third party contractor using portable crushing equipment (two stage crushing circuit). 

Contractor rates include crushing, handling and transport of crushed rock to plant facilities.  

1.9 Economic Analysis 

CSA Global's economic modelling and analysis of the Project reveals potential for: 

• Robust economics using metals prices (mid July 2018) of $1,250/oz Au, $16/oz Ag, and $5,725/t Cu: 

o All-In Sustaining Cost (AISC) of $440/oz USD [net of by-product credits] 

o After-Tax Net Present Value (NPV) at 7.5% of $69.8M USD and IRR of 93%. 

o Pre-Tax NPV at 7.5% of $103.8M USD and IRR of 122%.  

• Low CAPEX and rapid payback: 

o Pre-production Capital of $26.9M USD.  

o Payback period of 11 months after tax. 

o 2,000 t/d mill already purchased awaiting shipment to site reduces up-front capital. 

Sensitivity analyses reveals the Project to be most sensitive to metal prices, followed by operating costs and 

finally capital costs. Nonetheless the Project is extremely robust. Project NCF and NPV (discounted at 7.5%) 

sensitivity to a -30% to +30% variation in metal prices, operating and capital costs is as follows:

Sensitivity of Project NPV discounted at 7.5% to changes in metal prices and capital and operating costs (US$ millions) 

1.10 Conclusions and Recommendations  

The QPs have reviewed the Fortuna Project data provided by Minera Alamos, including the drill database, 

reviewed historic sampling procedures and security and visited the site. The QPs believe the data presented 

by Minera Alamos to be an accurate and reasonable representation of the Project mineralization. In the 

QPs' and CSA Global's opinion, the Fortuna Project is potentially very robust and warrants Minera Alamos' 

continued advancement of the Project towards further feasibility studies. 

The gold, silver and copper metals either leach at high recovery and/or report to a saleable flotation 

concentrate by conventional extraction pathways.  

• 2016 testwork confirmed +80% recovery of gold to a gravity circuit.  



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 10 

• 95% of remaining gold was recovered to a flotation step together with +90% of the contained 

copper and silver at a copper grade of approximately 20% Cu and silver grade of 2000 g/t - 3000g/t 

for a mass pull of less than 10%. 

• A conventional milling and flotation circuit has already been purchased and is slightly oversized and 

thus adequate for the project. 

• The potential for beneficiation of low grade (below cut-off) material by Duel X-ray (XRT) ore sorting 

has been demonstrated subject to additional confirmatory testwork. 

From a processing perspective, the Project presents as robust and the selected plant and equipment and 

process treatment pathway should comfortably treat this ore at 1100-1200 tonnes/day and at acceptable 

recovery of gold, silver and copper. 

A surface mine was designed for the PEA that would incorporate conventional surface mining methods and 

a production schedule was created.  Production highlights are: 

• 5-year mine life based on initial resource "starter pit" with 2.0 Mt of mineralization (3.68 g/t Au, 20 

g/t Ag, 0.27% Cu) processed at 1,100 tpd average processing rate. 

• Average annual contained-metal production of approximately 50,000oz Gold Equivalent Ounces 

(43,000oz Gold, 220,000oz Silver, 1,000t Copper). 

• 215koz of Gold, 1.1Moz of Silver, and 5kt of Copper produced in concentrates. 

Project risks which potentially could affect Project economics include: 

• The mineral resource estimate is based on the results from 125 core drill holes completed by 

previous operators prior to Minera Alamos' acquisition of the Project in 2016.  CSA Global 

recommends additional drill testing to confirm the historic results. 

• Environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, and political or other 

relevant issues have the potential materially affect access, title or the right or ability to perform the 

work recommended in this report on the Project. However, at the time of this report, CSA Global is 

unaware of any such potential issues affecting the Project. 

• The Project is most sensitive to metal prices, followed by operating costs and finally capital costs.  

However, even a 30% reduction in metal prices produces a positive NCF.   

1.11 Project Opportunities 

Project opportunities which potentially could enhance Project economics include:  

• Footprint of the current known deposit is very small compared to the overall land position.  

Exploration potential exists over the 6100 Ha land package.  A number of other areas of historical 

mining activities have been identified but most of the area has never been explored using modern 

exploration methods. 

• Inferred resources are not utilized in the current PEA mining plans.  Step out drilling may be able to 

define additional extensions of the current resources. 

• Additional metallurgical test work to optimize the gold extraction process and further improve 

overall metal recoveries.   



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 11 

• Reduction of initial start-up CAPEX with a staged plant construction plan (possibly involving earlier 

use of ore sorting) followed by expansion of the facilities once production is underway. 

• Additional mine planning optimization studies to evaluate opportunities to delay portions of early 

waste removal until later in the mine life  

• Further optimization studies are underway to determine if a more aggressive use of ore sorting may 

offer additional economic benefits for the project (i.e. plant CAPEX reductions, increased mineable 

gold ounces, etc.) 

• Trade-off studies aimed at optimizing cut-off grades (with and without ore sorting) and the 

incorporation of additional milling capacity – the PEA based on a starting rate of 1,100 tpd but the 

project is permitted for a 2,000 tpd operation. 

To proceed with the assessment of the potential development of the Project, the QPs recommend Minera 

Alamos continue to assess Project opportunities which potentially could enhance project economics 

including: 

• Expand exploration over the 6,100 Ha land package.  Work should initially investigate other areas of 

known historical mining activities using modern exploration methods. 

• Step out drilling at La Fortuna for the purpose of expanding the current Inferred resources not 

utilized in the PEA reported herein.  

• Infill drilling at La Fortuna for the purpose of upgrading Indicated to Measured and Inferred to 

Indicated resources; metallurgical sampling and QAQC confirmation of historical drilling. 

• Additional metallurgical test work to optimize the gold extraction process and further improve 

overall metal recoveries.   

• Metallurgical variability sampling of underground sampling and diamond drill core. 

• Further engineering studies should consider the following: 

o A staged plant construction plan (possibly involving earlier use of ore sorting) to further 

reduce the initial start-up CAPEX and then expand the facilities once production is 

underway. 

o Additional mine planning optimization studies to evaluate opportunities to delay portions of 

early waste removal until later in the mine life  

o Further optimization studies (currently underway) to determine if a more aggressive use of 

ore sorting may offer additional economic benefits for the project (i.e. plant CAPEX 

reductions, increased mineable gold ounces, etc.) 

o Trade-off studies aimed at optimizing cut-off grades (with and without ore sorting) and the 

incorporation of additional milling capacity up to 2,000 tpd. 

Minera Alamos has proposed a 2018/2019 program estimated to be in the order of US$1 million. CSA Global 

concurs with the proposed program and budget.

*Acquired from Argonaut Gold Inc. and its subsidiary Durango Fern Mines in May 2016. 

4.3 Tenure Agreements and Encumbrances 

4.3.1 Agreements and Royalties 

Argonaut Gold Inc. 

On 4 May 2016, Minera Alamos acquired 100% of four mining concessions comprising the La Fortuna 

Project from Argonaut Gold Inc. (Argonaut) and its wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary, Durango Fern Mines 

S.A. de C.V. 

In addition to the acquisition costs, all four mining concessions are subject to a 2.5% Net Smelter Return 

Royalty (NSR) on all production to a cumulative maximum of $4.5 million that is payable to Argonaut. 

In July 2016, Minera Alamos applied to expand the contiguous land holdings by acquiring the La Fortuna 

I/II/II and V concessions directly from the Mexico Mining Registry. These titles are not subject to any 

royalties. 

As of 2018, the total annual concession taxes to be paid on all eight concessions currently held by the 

Company is 368,000 Pesos (US$19,470 or C$25,700). This amount is projected to rise somewhat going 

forward as the Fortuna I/II/III/V concession payments will increase with time following their initial granting 

date.  

Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd 

On 30 May 2017, Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd (Osisko) acquired, on a private placement basis, a 19.9% equity 

stake in Minera Alamos (22,045,000 common shares).  



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 20 

Pursuant to their investment: 

• Osisko has the right to participate in future equity financings up to its pro-rata ownership pre-financing 

of 19.9% as long as Osisko holds a minimum 10% interest in the Company 

• Osisko has the option to purchase up to a 4% NSR on the La Fortuna Project for cash proceeds of 

$9 million upon a construction decision 

• Osisko also retains a Right of First Refusal on any future royalties and streams on any Company 

property 

• Osisko has the right to participate in half of any buybacks of existing royalties pertaining to La Fortuna, 

as well as acquire a 2% NSR (to be purchased at a reasonable market valuation) on any property 

acquired within a 250 km radius of the La Fortuna Project. 

4.3.2 Surface Rights 

In March 2017, the Company finalized a surface use agreement with local community representatives for 

the La Fortuna Project site, the result of the Company holding ongoing talks with landowners, hosting 

community meetings and negotiating with various stakeholders with the goal of receiving local support for a 

land access agreement.  

The Company has secured surface access to a 235 ha area which encompasses the envisioned mine pit, 

processing facility and all other necessary infrastructure to begin mining. The surface rights agreement also 

provides access to a substantial surrounding land package. Further exploration is planned to be undertaken 

with the objective of expanding the Project's current resource base. 

The surface rights agreement covers a period of up to 25 years during which time the Company will be 

required to pay annual rental payments while operating activities are ongoing. If deemed appropriate, an 

option to purchase the land outright will be considered by the Company. 

4.3.3 Permits 

With the assistance of Mexico-based environmental consulting firm Consultoria Ambiental Vugalit S.C., the 

Company finalized two permit applications for the La Fortuna Project for submission to the government: the 

Environmental Impact Statement (Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental – MIA), and the Technical 

Justification Study (Estudio Tecnico Justificativo – ETJ). Consultoria Ambiental Vugalit, S.C., performed the 

necessary environmental studies for these permit applications, as well as managing the Company's 

submissions to and ongoing relationship with the appropriate government agencies including PROFEPA 

(Federal Prosecutor for Environmental Protection), SEMARNAT (Secretariat of Environment and Natural 

Resources).  

The most significant components of the two applications include: 

• Infrastructure proposals: Detailed plans covering site layout, areas of disturbance, access roads, camps, 

waste water, electricity generation/access, etc have been submitted to provide a thorough 

understanding of the Project's impact on the area. 

• Mine construction: A mine plan based on the current mineral resource has been submitted as well as 

all ancillary plan elements including access ramps, mine waste locations, storage of surface soil and 

mine fleet details. 

• Plant design: Based on the specifications of the grinding/flotation facility purchased in 2016, an overall 

plant design has been produced and submitted including design drawings detailing the civil, mechanical

and electrical works. All required flowsheets summarizing estimated mass and volume flowrates are 

included. 

• Operational plans: Operation and maintenance procedures including workforce estimates, emissions 

controls, equipment maintenance, explosives use, and waste generation and management. 

• Closure plans: Specifying landscape performance goals, reclamation technologies, methods and plans 

and long-term monitoring and maintenance.  

The completion of the surface rights agreement described in Section 4.3.2 allowed the filing of the two 

applications. The Company understands that upon review and final acceptance of these applications, the 

necessary permits allowing for the commencement of mine construction will be granted. This is currently 

estimated for completion around the end of 2018. 

4.4 Environmental Liabilities 

Currently there are no known existing environmental liabilities associated with the La Fortuna Project. The 

Project is in a remote part of Durango State where mining has been carried out in the past and where it is 

currently being pursued. The Company has undertaken baseline environmental studies to determine the 

status of the current environment as well as identify environmental risks and develop appropriate measures 

to mitigate these risks.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography 

5.1 Accessibility 

The Project is accessible by road from Culiacan in neighbouring Sinaloa State, a driving distance of 

approximately 100 km and driving time of 2.0–2.5 hours (Figure 3). The quality and condition of the road 

varies, and the government has been systematically upgrading the road by widening and paving the surface 

in the direction of the Project. At present, the road is paved to within 35 km of the town El Barco situated 

on the Humaya River which cuts through the southern part of the Project area, approximately 3.5 km south-

southwest of the La Fortuna proposed mine area. The remainder of road is gravelled and graded, and of 

reasonable width for much of the route, though certain sections of the road can be rough, steep and 

narrow. Construction is currently planned to improve and pave the road through the Project area and 

beyond, but the scheduled completion date of this work is unknown. 

The Humaya River is fordable during the dry season, which extends from January to June. A small hand 

operated ferry handles light vehicles from July to December. Freight in and out of the small local 

communities is typically transported via small 1-ton flat-bed trucks. 

Direct flights link Culiacan, Mazatlan, and Los Mochis to Los Angeles and Mexico City. The main carrier is 

AeroMexico.

5.2 Climate 

The climate is typical of north-western Mexico with hot summers and moderate to warm dry winters. 

Climate norms for the period 1981–2010 are available for the Guatenipa, Sinaloa station (00025041- 

http://smn1.conagua.gob.mx/climatologia/Normales8110/NORMAL25041.TXT), 14 km west of the Project. 

Monthly average temperatures vary from 31.3°C in June to 20.7°C in January. The rainy season extends from 

June to September with average monthly rainfalls of 116.5 mm, 293.0 mm, 239.0 mm and 159.0 mm 

respectively. The driest period extends from February to May with average monthly rainfalls of 16.8 mm, 

8.9 mm, 7.1 mm and 10.6 mm respectively. Exploration activities can be conducted year-round, although 

the rainy season can create some difficulties with respect to accessibility. 

5.3 Physiography 

The Project area lies within the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, which is topographically rugged 

with elevations from 600 m to 850 m above sea level within the Project area (Figure 4).  

Vegetation consists primarily of scrub consisting of mesquite, prickly pear, nopal and agave, which can 

become quite thick and dense during the rainy season. Pine and oak forest dominate at higher elevations.  

Small-scale logging was carried out until recently; however, there is virtually no commercially exploitable 

timber remaining.

5.4 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Owing to the fact that Durango State has a long history of mining and ranks as one of the world's largest 

silver-producing regions, the city of Durango contains many mining and exploration support services and 

businesses and serves as the exploration base for many junior exploration companies in Mexico.  

The Project area itself is sparsely populated. There are a number of small settlements within a 10 km radius 

of the Project that rely on subsistence farming, ranching or timber harvesting as their principle means of 

survival. Though the villages may serve as a good local source of labour, most if not all required high-skilled 

labour will need to be sought from outside the Project area. 

The Project area has sufficient water for exploration and mining purposes. Water can be sourced year-round 

from the Humaya River as well as from surface runoff during the wet season. Additionally, a small spring 

situated about 1 km east of the old La Fortuna Mine supplies some drinking water via a high line, cable 

suspended hose.  

The nearest source of electricity is a major hydro-electric facility located 50 km to the southwest. There is 

however no powerline currently running through or past the Project area. Where available, power is 

currently provided via small diesel generators. 

Minera Alamos owns and maintains limited housing and storage buildings at the Project site. Additional 

facilities will be required in order to accommodate site personal during construction and future operations.

6 History 

The following is partially adapted from the technical reports by Toren Olson Consulting, dated October 2008 

and May 2016 (Olson, 2008 and 2016). 

6.1 Development of the La Fortuna Mine 

Initial development of the La Fortuna Mine occurred in the late 1800s. Several conflicting accounts have 

been reviewed by the author (Davies, 1997; Vargas & Bustamente, 1974; Centeno, 1992). The details are 

inconsistent between these three accounts. Since none of them are based on coincident reports but appear 

to have been gleaned based on first or second-hand word-of-mouth accounts at least 20 or 30 years post-

mining, the author believes the details cannot be trusted. Some of the confusion may be due to the multiple 

names of the mine/deposit/mining area, as well as the number of different adits that were being exploited 

in the area at the time. 

During the Company's tenure as landholder, the underground workings were surveyed extensively and, 

based on this work, estimations have been made as to the extent of historical mining. These estimates 

range from 30,000 t to 50,000 t, including ore and waste. 

6.2 Consejo de Recursos Minerales 

In 1975, 1980, and 1988, geologists from Consejo de Recursos Minerales (CRM), an agency of the Mexican 

Government, carried out detailed geological mapping and systematic channel sampling of all the accessible 

underground workings in 1975, 1980 and 1988 (levels 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). Surface geochemical surveys and 

regional mapping was also carried out. Results are summarized in a series of published reports, under the 

general heading "Exploration in a gold-copper rich area of San Fernando, Municipality of Tamazula, State of 

Durango." 

With the exception of obviously un-mineralized dykes, the mine development headings were continuously 

channel sampled along one wall at 2 m (and occasionally 1 m) intervals. In 1975, a total of 768 samples were 

collected, most of which contained fresh sulphides only weakly oxidized post mining. A few narrow faults 

and fractures contain heavier oxides. In 1980 and 1988, fill-in and duplicate sampling was conducted. The 

samples were fire assayed with an atomic absorption (AA) finish and were assayed in Mexican government 

laboratories at Nogales and Hermosillo.  

Most original CRM 2 m, moil cut, chest height wall channel samples probably weighed up to 5 kg each and 

most appear to have been carefully taken. However, those obtained along the northerly-trending drifts 

tended to follow an overall northerly trending superimposed structure or banding more favourable to 

mineralization, possibly adding a bias. However, it is felt that this was offset elsewhere where sampling 

across the backs instead would have intersected more sulphides. Later sampling by someone whose records 

are not available seemed to recognize this situation.  

In 1987, Sr. Jaime Muguiro Pena, acting as agent for the former concession owner, installed an 80 TPD 

flotation mill in order to process the sulphide ore operating intermittently until 1990. The concentrates 

were shipped to a Mexican Government smelter. The payments were arbitrarily assigned to the payment of 

a loan made by the Mexican Government. The accumulation of operating costs, and the lack of cash flow, 

led to the cessation of operations. Reportedly, 20,000 t were mined from underground and processed.

6.3 Alaska Fern Mines Ltd 

In 1989, changes to the Mexican law and a relaxation of foreign ownership restrictions permitted Alaska 

Fern Mines Ltd, a privately owned British Columbia company to acquire 100% interest in the La Fortuna 

Mine property totalling 6 ha. Alaska Fern Mines Ltd also acquired the surrounding 5,700 ha Ampliacion La 

Fortuna Property. Both properties were then sold to San Fernando Mining Company Ltd. 

6.4 San Fernando Mining Company Ltd 

Between 1991 and 1996, San Fernando Mining Company Ltd (San Fernando) carried out an extensive 

exploration program with particular emphasis on the La Fortuna Mine area. The objective was to define a 

reserve of gold-silver-copper sulphide ore amenable to open pit mining, fine grinding, and conventional 

processing, either by cyanidation or froth flotation. 

6.4.1 Verification Channel Sampling 

San Fernando's program included detailed mapping and sampling of underground workings, including the 

verification sampling of selected CRM underground channel sample locations. The CRM sample locations 

selected for verification sampling were chosen at random. 

San Fernando's samples were cut by pick rather than moil and were semi-continuous across the same CRM 

channel widths. The samples were fire assayed with an AA finish by Rossbacher Labs in Vancouver. Sample 

weights were less than CRM's, in part accounting for the obvious grade variances (San Fernando's were 

higher grade). Gunn, of Dupont Exploration Canada, carried out check sampling on the Property and 

concluded that the variation between the San Fernando and CRM assays may be due to nugget effect and 

that large samples are necessary for accurate results.

6.4.2 Diamond Drilling 

In the immediate vicinity of the La Fortuna Mine, San Fernando completed 121 diamond drillholes totalling 

18,900 m. Core size was NQ and sample length is nominally 2 m. The small percentage of drillholes that 

were surveyed downhole generally only showed a minor deflection of a few degrees. Drillhole locations and 

notable intercepts from the drill program are shown in Figure 5 and Table 4 respectively.

Preliminary mineral resource and reserve calculations, coupled with process testwork carried out on 

representative core samples, did not support San Fernando's objectives and the Property was subsequently 

sold to Alamos Minerals Ltd (now Alamos Gold) in 1996. 

6.5 Alamos Minerals Ltd 

Alamos Minerals Ltd conducted various metallurgical testwork and commissioned the 1997 Davies report 

(Davies, 1997). They planned on conducting a 20,000-ton bulk mining and heap leach test. However, due to 

technical difficulties and the falling gold price the test was abandoned before completion. The Property was 

subsequently sold to Morgain Minerals in 2006. Morgain Minerals and Aurogin Resources merged in 2007 to 

form Castle Gold. 

6.6 Castle Gold 

Following recommendations outlined in a March 2007 La Fortuna Technical Report (Olson, 2008), Castle 

Gold drilled six twin holes totalling 551 m in 2008 for the purpose of evaluating previous drilling. 

The results from these six twin holes compare very well with the previous drilling. Within the six twin holes, 

180.6 m of ore intercepts were compared with corresponding intercepts in the original holes. The original 

holes had 181.8 m of ore intercepts resulting in 0.7% less meterage in the twin holes. When the gold grade 

is compared, the twin holes averaged 3.58 g/t vs 3.29 g/t in the original holes. This represents an increase of 

8.8%. This is a very good comparison considering the abundance of free gold (nugget effect) present in the 

La Fortuna deposit. 

It should be noted that within some intercepts there were large variances in both metres and/or gold grade. 

Most of the large variances in the intercept lengths were within short intercepts and the larger intercept 

lengths were much closer on a percentage basis. Some of the large grade variances are most probably due 

to the presence of free gold.

6.7 Argonaut Gold 

Argonaut acquired Castle Gold in December 2009 and with it the La Fortuna property.  

In the fourth quarter of 2010, Argonaut commenced an evaluation of the historical drilling and metallurgical 

work as well as an examination of the potential of the property at the La Fortuna Project. A 1,000 m drill 

program was planned for 2011 to evaluate the exploration potential of several additional gold occurrences 

known to occur within the property boundary (Argonaut, 2011). It does not appear however that Argonaut 

completed any drilling on the Property. Instead a geology report of the Fortuna Area, including 256 rock 

samples, was produced (SPM Mineria S.A. de C.V., 2013) in order to maintain the concessions by meeting 

the Mexican expenditure requirements (Argonaut, 2015). 

6.8 Minera Alamos Inc. 

Minera Alamos acquired the La Fortuna property in May 2016 from Argonaut.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization  

7.1 Regional Geology 

The La Fortuna Project area sits within the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO). The SMO is one of the larger 

silicic volcanic provinces on Earth, and the largest such province from the Cenozoic era (Ferrari et al., 2007). 

The SMO igneous province covers greater than 300,000 km2, stretching 2,000 km from the US-Mexico 

border to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in southern-central Mexico. The term SMO also refers to a 

roughly coincident physiographic province, characterized by a high plateau with elevations in excess of 

2,000 m above sea level, bounded by deep canyons and the plains of the Gulf of California coast on the 

western flank and the wide tectonic depressions of the northern mountains and plains and the central 

plateau on the east. 

The SMO is a result of the Cretaceous to Cenozoic magmatic and tectonic episodes caused by and related to 

the subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the North American plate. It is characterized by five main 

igneous complexes (see Figure 6) (Ferrari et al., 2007): 

1) Late Cretaceous to Paleocene plutonic and volcanic rocks. 

2) Eocene andesites and less rhyolites (Lower Volcanic Complex). 

3) Various Silicic Ignimbrite pulses mainly of Oligocene and Early Miocene age (Upper Volcanic 

Supergroup). 

4) Transitional basaltic-andesitic lavas coincident with the end of ignimbrite pulses. 

5) Post-subduction volcanism of alkaline basalts and ignimbrites in the Late Miocene, Pliocene, and 

Pleistocene. 

The earliest rocks of the SMO, the Lower Volcanic Complex, were affected by moderate contractile 

deformation during the Laramide orogeny, during the latter stages of which formed east-west to east-

northeast to west-southwest trending extensional structures within this unit. This is coincident with the 

emplacement of the province's world-class porphyry copper deposits. Extensional tectonics beginning in the 

Oligocene along the eastern portion of the province exhumed lower crustal rocks in the northern parts of 

the province forming granitoid batholiths and other plutons. Extension migrated westward and eventually 

formed north-northwest striking normal fault systems with east-northeast and west-southwest tilt domains 

along the western margin of the SMO. Figure 7 displays the broad tectonic picture of the SMO.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 34 

The Project area is near the western margin of the SMO and is hosted by a granodioritic batholith exposed 

by erosion of the Upper Volcanic Supergroup and Lower Volcanic Complex. Both the Upper and Lower 

Volcanics are exposed in the areas surrounding the batholith. 

7.2 Metallogeny 

The SMO is recognized as a significant gold-copper metallogenic province with potential for porphyry 

copper-gold mineralization and epithermal gold-silver mineralization related to areas of Tertiary volcanic 

and subvolcanic intrusive activity. The metallogeny of the volcanic belt generally changes from west to east. 

The deposits of the western Barrance sub-province are predominantly silver-gold and include the Tayoltita, 

Santa Rita, and San Antonio mines, while the deposits of the eastern Altas Llanura sub-province tend to be 

more polymetallic in nature, producing lead and zinc in addition to the silver and gold. 

7.3 Property Geology 

The La Fortuna Project area is predominantly underlain by intrusive rocks of granodiorite to quartz 

monzonite composition (Figure 8). Due to the gradual nature of the transition from granodiorite to quartz 

monzonite, it is interpreted that they were formed from the same intrusion undergoing magmatic 

differentiation (Centeno, 1992). In the north end of the Project area, these intrusives are overlain by 

rhyolites and andesites. The deposit itself consists of intrusive-related quartz-tourmaline breccias as a late 

mineralization phase from a porphyry system. The intrusives, volcanics, and hydrothermal deposits are 

intruded by late stage dykes of andesitic to basaltic composition trending N10°W and dipping 65°W. The 

dominant structural features in the region strike northwest-southeast. 

 

Figure 8:  Property geology (adapted from SGM, 2017) 



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 35 

The intrusive rocks host epigenetic native silver veins such as those of Batopilas (near Guadalupe) 

approximately 60 km to the north of La Fortuna, as well as fracture controlled and disseminated precious 

metal and copper deposits. The volcanic rocks host several epithermal precious and base metal deposits 

such as the mines at Topia approximately 40 km to the east of La Fortuna but are unmineralized in the 

Project area. 

The quartz monzonite is porphyritic in texture with phenocrysts of k-feldspar. The ferromagnesian minerals 

consist of hornblende and biotite. Additional petrography and mineralogy studies (Centeno, 1992) have 

determined the quartz-tourmaline breccia "bodies" have significant potassic alteration, with veins 

constituted of quartz-tourmaline-k-feldspar, pyrite-chalcopyrite-quartz, as well as microcrystalline quartz 

associated with tremolite and actinolite.  

The dominant local fracturing and jointing zones appear to strike north-northwest and north-northeast, 

apparently paralleling those of the intrusive contacts. The rock exposed in the underground mine workings 

is notably competent with rock fall being limited to a few caved areas where chutes were broken or pulled 

out.

7.4 Mineralization 

The Project area hosts numerous historic adits, and gold-silver showings including the historic La Fortuna 

Mine (and extensions) and the Ramada, PN, and Cerro Pelon zones to name a few (Figure 10).  

 

Figure 10:  Location of adjacent zones 

Mineralization in the La Fortuna Mine area appears to be spatially associated with a series of parallel fault 

structures (approximately 1.5–2 km apart) and related to tourmalinized quartz monzonite breccia bodies 

which are located along the periphery or flanks of a north-northwest striking, west dipping, tabular quartz 

monzonite intrusive that appears to be approximately 60 m wide and forms a prominent topographic ridge 

prominent in the mine area. These fault structures and tourmaline breccia bodies have been the source of 

significant historical mining activity within the Project area.  

Mineralization consists mainly of pyrite and chalcopyrite stockwork veinlets, fracture fillings and 

disseminations in amounts consisting up to 10% of the host rock. Minor tetrahedrite, sphalerite and galena 

are present. The mineralization is apparently associated with sulphides, tourmaline, quartz, chlorite and 

epidote breccias. Minor mineralization occurs in the weakly tourmalinized quartz monzonite.  

Cross-cutting andesite dykes are grayish-green and generally massive. They appear to be post mineral but 

occasionally contain sulphides occurring in fractures near their contacts. Some of the better sulphide 

concentrations occur within a few feet of the contacts. 

7.4.1 La Fortuna Mine 

The La Fortuna deposit is hosted within a tabular mineralized body that is up to 60 m thick and dips 30° to 

the west. The lower part of the body rests on a healed breccia base while the upper part consists of quartz 

stringers and veinlets extending up into the hanging wall.  

La Fortuna hosts gold, silver and copper mineralization which occurs as disseminations, stockwork veinlets 

and fracture fillings. It is noteworthy that the degree of mineralization is directly related to the intensity of 



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 37 

brecciation or fracturing and the amount of sulphides (pyrite). Mineralization remains open at depth and 

along strike. Similar style mineralization exists at surface approximately 400–500 m south of the current 

resource and can be traced along strike for at least 200 m. 

Photomicrograph studies of mineral concentrate indicate gold and silver grains and minerals are present 

along the grain boundaries of the chalcopyrite and pyrite. Disseminated pyrite within the altered and 

unaltered wall rocks appears to be associated with some precious metal values. Significant values are found 

with the quartz-sericite-pyrite-chalcopyrite±tourmaline stockworks and the grades are dependent on the 

intensity of the fracturing. Thin limonite coatings are common on sulphides exposed by earlier mining. 

Limonite, hematite and malachite plus azurite occur occasionally within the poorly defined oxide zones.  

7.4.2 Ramada Zone 

The Ramada Zone lies on a parallel fault structure approximately 2 km northeast of the La Fortuna Mine 

with a strike length that can be traced at surface for over 600 m. Two groups of showings comprise the 

Ramada Zone: 

• A southern group of showings is mostly covered with overburden. However, a 7 m length of quartz vein 

is exposed which is 3.3 m wide. Samples taken by Fernando Gold across the vein returned assays of 

18 g/t Au and 176 g/t Ag over a width of 3.3 m. Further south the vein is exposed in a creek bed and a 

sample 3.7 m wide returned results of 4.33 g/t Au and 105 g/t Ag. This site also has a small caved adit 

and may be the location of two core holes drilled by CRM, which had intercepts of 2.2 m at 5.49 g/t Au, 

204.8 g/t Ag and 3.3 m at 2.35 g/t Au and 17.6 g/t Ag. 

• The northern group of showings consist of a series of small veins which so far have only returned 

anomalous gold values. 

7.4.3 PN Zone 

The PN Zone structure is located approximately 1.5 km northeast of the Ramada Zone and can be traced on 

surface for approximately 1.5 km. The structure host numerous historic mine workings like La Plomosa, 

Santa Fe, Guadalupe, Higuerita and Buena Vista. Sampling from this area returned gold grades ranging from 

1 to 10 g/t Au and 50 to 400 g/t Ag. 

7.4.4 Cerro Pelon Zone 

The Cerro Pelon Zone (previously Los Cajones) is located to the south of the La Fortuna Mine. The zone was 

the subject of historical geochemical sampling by the CRM which outlined a large area of "anomalous" gold 

approximately 1,500 m long and 200–500 m wide. Gold assays included sample values as high as 10.1 g/t. 

7.4.5 Other Zones 

There are numerous other zones on the Property which have had various names over the years. These 

include: 

• El Toro Zone – The El Toro prospects are located about 3.5 km west-northwest of the old San Fernando 

plant site. Some pyrite, chalcopyrite and copper carbonates are present on the dump of the old mine 

workings and in a caved adit. The limonitic zone is reportedly 150 m wide and 700 m in length. 

Sampling by CRM showed a 1 m sample assaying 28.4 g/t Au and 283 g/t Ag. Another sample averaged 

4.8 g/t Au and 67.2 g/t Ag over a 4 m length. A dump sample assayed 3.6 g/t Au and over 50 g/t Ag. 

• La Tocaya Zone – The La Tocaya Zone approximately 200 m east of the La Fortuna Mine's Level #2 

Eastern Portal. Strong sulphides occur adjacent to a major northwest-trending fault which includes

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 38 

trace to 1% pyrite, chalcopyrite, and malachite. The alteration zone is approximately 15–20 m wide and 

60–70 m long but steep topography inhibits exact measurement. The La Tocaya Zone appears to be a 

parallel and separate fault related zone from the main La Fortuna Zone. 

• Meloncita East Zone – Meloncita East is located approximately 600 m south-southwest of the La 

Fortuna Mine. A geological mapping and sampling program outlined an alteration zone with highly 

anomalous gold values extending from the El Fuego zone of the La Fortuna mine area. The alteration 

and mineralization found at the Meloncita East zone is very similar to the alteration and mineralization 

found at the La Fortuna mine main surface showing. It is thought that the two zones are in fact the 

same zone although the exact surface extension of the Meloncita East Zone, to the north, can only be 

assumed since extensive overburden cover is present. Faulting is assumed to play a significant role in 

offsetting the zone. The Meloncita East Zone consists of an alteration zone approximately 20–40 m 

wide extending approximately 700 m north. 

• La Cantarana Zone – La Cantarana lies 1.9 km southwest of the La Fortuna mine and 500 m southwest 

of the Meloncita West Zone. Historical rock sampling returned anomalous values of up to 6 g/t Au over 

an area covering approximately 300 m x 50 m.

8 Deposit Types 

Known mineralization within the La Fortuna Project area is spatially associated with calc-alkaline intrusions, 

with different zones exhibiting a combination of geological characteristics and gold-silver grades of both 

porphyry and epithermal mineralization styles. Collectively the zones at La Fortuna may be best 

characterized as intrusion-related 'transitional' deposits (Figure 11). They consist mainly of a hydrothermally 

altered breccia "pipe", tabular in shape, similar in nature to other quartz-sulphide gold ± copper ± silver 

epithermal breccia deposits. 

 

Figure 11:  Intrusion related mineralization model (Panteleyev, 1986) 

8.1 Epithermal Deposits 

Epithermal deposits form in the shallow parts of magma-related hydrothermal systems. They are generally 

associated with volcanism and intrusions of calc-alkaline magmas, commonly in sub-aerial volcanic arcs. 

There are two end-member styles of epithermal mineral deposits: low-sulphidation and high-sulphidation.

Figure 12:  Derivation of low and high sulphidation fluids (Corbett, 2002) 

Sulphide mineralization is generally introduced along faults and fractures although mineralization can also 

be disseminated in permeable rock strata. Sulphide assemblages include electrum, native gold, native silver, 

argentite, pyrargyrite, proustite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, tetrahedrite and occasional telluride 

minerals. Common gangue minerals include quartz, chalcedony, adularia, calcite and amethyst.  

Vertical metal zonation is manifested with higher amounts of gold, silver, or gold and silver along with 

mercury, tellurium and antimony in the upper portions of the system, and higher lead, zinc and copper 

contents at deeper levels. 

Gold and silver grades in low-sulphidation epithermal systems can be very high, occasionally reaching gold 

grades on the order of tens-of-grams of gold per tonne and kilograms of silver per tonne. Low-sulphidation 

epithermal deposits typically average around 770,000 t and average 7.5 g/t Au, 110 g/t Ag with minor Cu, 

Zn, and Pb (Panteleyev, 1996). It should be noted that these grades and tonnages are representative of 

vein-type low-sulphidation deposits. 

La Fortuna has not been mineralogically characterized to a detailed enough level to properly classify it as 

either low-sulphidation or high-sulphidation. It seems to most closely resemble deposits characterized as 

low-sulphidation with deep crustal emplacement (i.e. close to the related porphyry intrusion) (Corbett, 

2002), including ore shoots exploiting local structures and deposited in fractured carapace or a breccia 

"field/pipe", with auriferous quartz-sulphide veining/breccia-filling mineralization.

9 Exploration 

Minera Alamos has done limited exploration since acquiring the Project in 2016. The Company's Vice 

President of Exploration, Miguel Cardona, worked extensively at La Fortuna in the past when he was Senior 

Geologist for Castle Gold. Consequently, he has brought his geological knowledge and understanding of the 

Property to Minera Alamos. 

During late 2017 and early 2018, the Minera Alamos Exploration team set up a camp in the vicinity of the 

Fortuna Mine to map and explore the projects around the Fortuna area and also at the Ramada, PN and 

Cerro Pelon areas. One of the priority areas was the PN area which shows a gold anomaly of at least 

1,000 m x 400 m at surface. Additional surface work (including sampling) is planned to establish new drill 

targets for exploration.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses, and 
Security 

As of the effective date of this report Minera Alamos has conducted limited field exploration at La Fortuna, 

including initial prospecting and due diligence related to property acquisition. Mineral exploration 

conducted by previous operators within the Property area is discussed in Section 6, History, and their 

sample collection, handling, preparation, and analytical procedures described below. Table 6 summarizes 

the sampling that was conducted by these previous operators.

11.1 2008 Castle Gold Drill Program 

11.1.1 Sample Security 

Sample security procedures began at the drill and were laid out as follows: 

• Plastic core boxes are labelled, and arrows are used to ensure the core is laid out properly. 

• When each core box is filled it is covered and placed away from sources of contamination. 

• Core boxes are collected from the drill site by geologists employed by the company and placed in a 

temporary storage area on the Property. 

• A chain of custody document is filled out and signed by the geologist, and in turn handed on to the 

drivers when core is picked up. 

• Core is delivered to the storage facility and logged in San Juan del Rio, Durango. Upon arrival, the 

shipment is signed for and the chain of custody document is reviewed. 

• All core is geologically and geotechnically logged, as well as photographed prior to sampling. 

• All core is sampled, with samples not exceeding 2 m, while also being restricted by geological contacts. 

• All sampled core is split using a diamond saw, and both halves returned to the core box. 

• Geologists review the split core before placing half for analysis into a plastic sample bag with the 

appropriate sample tags. 

• Geologists insert blanks and standards during the sampling. 

• Larger bags are used to bundle together groups of samples and are labelled appropriately. 

• Shipment log sheets are generated to track each larger bag. 

• Only one shipment by courier was required to ship all samples to ALS-Chemex Lab in Hermosillo for 

assay preparation.

11.1.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis 

The 2008 drill program was predominantly sampled at 2 m intervals, except for smaller intervals within the 
mineralized zone and where necessary to maintain geological contacts. From the six holes 
(LF-28/29/30/40/56/61), 344 samples were collected and sent to ALS Hermosillo, Mexico for preparation by 
crushing (70% <2 mm), splitting (by riffle splitter), and pulverization (85% <75 µm). Samples were then 
shipped to ALS in Vancouver, British Columbia for analysis. Gold was analysed using a 30 g fire assay with AA 
measurement, with a gravimetric measurement above 10 ppm. Further analysis using aqua regia digestion, 
followed by a 35-element inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, was also completed to determine 
quantities of secondary metals, including silver and copper.  

During the period of analyses, the ALS laboratory held ISO 9001:2008 certification. 

It is the authors' opinion that the 2008 sampling programs were conducted to industry standards applicable 

at the time the work was conducted. 

11.1.3 Quality Assurance and Control 

Each hole was analysed as one batch. ALS employed an internal submission of standards and blanks as 

follows: 

• One Gold Standard is inserted every 12 to 15 samples 

• A blank is inserted every 12 to 15 samples. 

The ALS standards and blanks performed within normal expected ranges.  

The failures are not significant, and the duplicate correlation coefficient is 1.00 for Au, Ag, and Cu, which is 

perfect statistically, and this is the most important result. In the authors' opinion, this data is completely 

reliable for the purposes of this report. 

11.2 1994 San Fernando Drill Program 

Detailed descriptions of sample preparation, analyses and security protocols and procedures utilized by San 

Fernando were not available in review documentation provided to the authors. Although sample security 

details varied from program to program, all samples were retained at the La Fortuna camp until shipped in 

various sized allotments to the geochemical laboratories. All drill and geochemical samples collected by San 

Fernando were analysed by independent commercial laboratories. 

11.2.1 Sample Preparation and Analysis 

The 1994 drill program was sampled in mostly 2 m intervals: 

• 5,452 samples collected from holes LF1 to LF78, 59% of samples in the drill database, were sent to 

Bondar-Clegg & Company Ltd's ("Bondar-Clegg") Vancouver laboratory. 

o All samples were assayed for gold by fire assay using a 30 g aliquot, with a lower detection limit 

(LDL) of 5 ppb. Samples that hit the upper detection limit for Au or Ag were re-assayed, (method 

for re-assay not listed on assay certificates). All samples were also assayed for silver, copper, zinc, 

and lead by ICP with LDLs of 0.2 ppm Ag, 1 ppm Cu, 2 ppm Pb, and 1 ppm Zn. The first group of 

samples, 168 in total, were also assayed using a 28 multi-element suite using ICP-ES/MS methods. 

• 3,440 samples from holes LF79 to LF119, 37% of samples in the drill database, were sent to the SGS 

Canada Inc. (SGS) Vancouver laboratory: 

o Further details are not available from the SGS sampling procedure.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 45 

During the period of analyses, the SGS laboratory was not yet certified by ISO (certified in 2013). No 

information is currently available about the certification of the Bondar-Clegg laboratory. 

It is the authors' opinion that the historical sampling programs were conducted to industry standards 

applicable at the time the work was conducted. 

11.2.2 Quality Assurance and Control 

Internal Laboratory Duplicates, Standards and Blanks 

From the records available, the internal Bondar-Clegg sampling procedures included the following (batches 

ranged in sizes but averaged somewhere around 70–80 samples): 

• Duplicates of every 15th to 20th sample 

• Three Au standards (Low, High, and BCC Gold Standard 90-3) per batch 

• One to three analytical blanks (for Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, and Zn) per batch 

• Three BCC (Bondar-Clegg) Geochemical Standards (for Ag, Cu, Pb, and Zn) per batch. 

Duplicate data is available for all assays; however, standard and blank sample data are only available for 19 

batches. Several types of duplicate analyses were performed; however, records are incomplete as to all the 

methods employed. Out of a total of 5,452 samples sent to Bondar-Clegg in 1994, 220 were 60 g pulp 

sample duplicates, and 129 are 90 g pulp sample duplicates. An additional 45 duplicates were labelled as 

preparation duplicates. For 75 repeat analyses, the duplicate sample type is not recorded. There were also 

four duplicates of samples higher than 10,000 ppb Au. 

Figure 13 to Figure 16 display the plotted duplicate results for the Bondar Clegg assay results. Correlation 

coefficients for the duplicates are as follows: original Au30 assays and rev1 Au60 duplicates, 0.84; original 

Au30 assays and rev2 Au90 duplicates, 0.89; rev1 Au60 and rev2 Au90 duplicates, 0.93; original Au30 assays 

and "prep" duplicates, 0.98; original Au30 assays and unlabelled duplicates, 0.99; original Ag assays and 

repeat Ag assays, 1.00; original Cu assays and repeat Cu assays, 1.00. There is some observed variation, 

which may be influenced by the nugget effect, but these results are well within reason for the deposit type 

and assay methods.  

Figures 13 through 16 display the plotted blank and standard results for the Bondar-Clegg assay results. 

Overall the performance of blanks and standards for the program is satisfactory. One blank Au and one 

blank Cu results are above threshold but not enormously. The sample size for the Au and Ag standards is 

quite small so it is not possible to draw anything conclusively from these results. Again, the performance of 

standards may have influenced the decision to switch labs part way through the program, and if so, that was 

a good decision and indicates the Company was paying close attention to these results. If anything, the 

results seem skewed slightly low, so the author has no reservations about including the associated data in 

the estimation. 

Fewer records are available for the SGS quality assurance/quality control (QAQC) procedures. Duplicate 

results are available and were apparently performed on every 8th to 10th sample (409 duplicates out of 3,440 

samples). No standards or blanks are available at this time nor any information about whether any were 

performed. 

Figure 16 displays the plot of the duplicate performance for the SGS repeat assays. The correlation 

coefficient for these repeats is 0.98. This is an extremely good result and it is clear from the plot that 

variation occurs relatively tightly, especially at higher grades. Interestingly SGS labs appears to have

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 46 

achieved much better duplicate results; this may have been part of the decision to switch to them part way 

through the drill program. Results for Ag and Cu are statistically perfect.

Independent Check Assays 

For holes LF1 to LF78, independent check samples were sent to Min-En Laboratories Ltd (Min-En) in 

Vancouver for analysis (technique not available/described). For holes LF79 to LF119, check samples were 

sent to Bondar-Clegg in Vancouver for analysis by fire assay using a 30 g aliquot, with an LDL of 5 ppb. 

It is stated by Fluor (1995) that 31 check samples were sent to Min-En from Bondar-Clegg, and 192 check 

samples (both rejects and pulps) were sent to Bondar-Clegg from SGS. Currently data is only available for 

one set of 150 of the latter, and it is not clear whether the set available is from rejects or pulps. 

Fluor (1995) describes the results for the Bondar-Clegg Min-En duplicates as follows: 

"… there is overall general agreement between the two labs, but with considerable scatter on 
individual samples, due no doubt in large part to a high nugget effect. The correlation co-efficient 

is 0.93." 



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 48 

Fluor (1995) describes the results for the SGS Bondar-Clegg duplicates as follows: 

"Note the checks based on rejects are about 9% lower than the originals, while the checks based 
on pulps are about 4% lower. However, in both cases there is considerable scatter, due no doubt in 

large part to a high nugget effect … The correlation coefficient is not as high as one might hope: 
0.84 for original vs. rejects, and 0.85 for original vs. pulps." 

Of the 150 samples available to the author, the duplicate results are about 4% lower, and the correlation 

coefficient is 0.87. These results are comparative to the pulp results as described above. These results are 

not deemed inconsistent with typical quartz-dominated gold deposits with high nugget effects. 

11.3 Conclusions 

The author finds that, despite small discrepancies, the data discussed is reliable for the purposes of this 

report. Database QAQC protocols have been very thorough and fall well within the exploration guidelines as 

laid out by CIM best practices (CIM 2000).

12 Data Verification 

12.1 Data Validation 

Validation of the assay database was undertaken using the original assays communicated by both Bondar-

Clegg and SGS for the 1994 drill results, and ALS Chemex for the 2008 drill results. For the 1994 results, 10% 

of the results (including all duplicated samples) were verified against original documents, while for the 2008 

results, 100% of the results were verified. 

The 1994 results showed no errors but did show some minor discrepancies in data entry (2.7% of the results 

had discrepancies): 

• LDL samples handled in two different ways; some were set to 0 ppb Au, and some were set to 2.5 ppb 

Au. 

• Duplicated samples where, rather than recording the original result, an average of the original and the 

duplicate was inserted (the highest value of these is 343 ppb Au). 

• Duplicated samples where, rather than recording the original result, the duplicate was inserted (the 

highest value of these is 133 ppb Au). 

• Over limit aliquots were re-assayed, apparently giving values in oz/t. Apparent gold oz/t values were 

converted into g/t and entered into the assay table. This exercise was not done for all over-limit silver 

assay values. The upper limit of detection of 50 g/t Ag remains in the assay database for 167 silver 

assays, despite the correct silver values in available certificates. These silver values should be included 

in an updated assay table.  

The discrepancies are minor and have no effect on the results of the resource estimation, other than 

perhaps a minor suppression of grades in very low grade areas (well below cut-off grade). It is 

recommended, however, that these results are corrected going forward. 

The 2008 results show no discrepancies or errors. 

12.2 Site Visit 

On 10 July 2016, Scott Zelligan, P.Geo., visited the Project, accompanied by Miguel Cardona, P.Eng., Vice 

President of Exploration for Minera Alamos. The visit included Level 2 of the still accessible underground 

adits, as well as two drill collars from the 1994 drill program. These locations were measured using a Garmin 

GPSMap 60CSx handheld global positioning system (GPS). Table 7 displays the locations measured and their 

location according to the drill logs as compared to the validation measurement, in NAD27. The locations 

correspond well within the accuracy of the device (± 10 m). Photo 1 and Photo 2 display the collars visited.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical 
Testing 

13.1 Introduction 

Early metallurgical testwork on the Fortuna deposit was carried out in 1995 at the request of the property 

owners at that time (San Fernando). Additional testwork was performed by Castle Gold in 2008. Several 

recent testwork programs have been carried out on the deposit since then with the latest round of 

confirmatory testwork by Minera Alamos in 2016/2017. These testwork programs, as well as the expected 

processing plant throughput and recoveries of gold, silver and copper, are discussed in more detail in the 

following sections. 

13.2 Historical Testwork 

In 1995, preliminary metallurgical testwork was commissioned by San Fernando. The program was carried 

out in two phases. Phase I work was performed by Colorado Minerals Research Institute (CMRI) and Hazen 

Research and included fine grinding followed by an evaluation of gravity concentration, froth flotation and 

cyanidation. Phase II, by CMRI, tested the impact of different grind sizes on leach recoveries. 

The Phase I program was a "conventional" process with fine grinding followed by an evaluation of gravity 

concentration, froth flotation, and cyanidation. 

This early work concluded that: 

• Gravity gold recoveries ranged from 67% to 84% 

• Flotation gold recoveries achieved 96% 

• Leach of flotation concentrate had gold recovery of 55% 

• Direct cyanidation of the ore produced gold and silver recoveries of 97% and 41% respectively at a 

grind size of 150 µ. 

As an alternative, a heap leaching option was also investigated. However later testwork showed a decisive 

advantage of gravity recovery followed by flotation as a preferred path forward, particularly for the 

recovery of silver and the reduction in cyanide consumption due to the removal of copper without exposing 

it to cyanide. 

The phase II test program, performed by CMRI, focused on the effect of grind size on the direct cyanidation 

leach gold recovery. Three grinding sizes (300 µ ,150 µ and 75 µ) were tested. Gold and silver extractions of 

97% and 41% respectively were established at a grind size of 150 µ. This limited variability testwork 

confirmed previous work that the direct cyanidation of the ore, without an intermediate concentration step, 

gave the highest recovery of gold and silver compared to all other flow sheet options investigated.  

13.3 2008 Testwork Program 

In July 2008, three samples were sent to SGS Lakefield Research from what was then Castle Gold 

Corporation's La Fortuna Project. The samples were identified as N2, N2A, and N3 and consisted of 

approximately 100 kg (each) of coarse rocks which were removed from three areas in the old underground 

workings at the mine. The sample locations were selected to obtain material that was representative of the 

range of mineralization present in the deposit (low, average and high grade).

13.3.1 Sample Analysis 

Sample N2 – Low grade material from adit level 2 which consisted of quartz feldspar intrusive with small 

veins of tourmaline. 

Sample N2A – Medium grade material from adit level 2 consisting primarily of tourmaline. 

Sample N3 – High grade material from adit level 3 consisting primarily of tourmaline but with strong 

showings of pyrite in veins and fracture fillings.

13.3.2 Ore Hardness 

Field observations at the La Fortuna deposit identified the potential that the mineralization host rock was of 

greater than "average" hardness. The Bond Impact Tests were performed on rocks from each of the three 

samples and the results of the crushing work index (CWI) is summarized in Table 9 below.

Source: Extracted from SGS 2008 "CWI Test Results.xls" 

The three Fortuna samples can be considered as "hard" to "very hard" with two of the samples positioned 

in excess of the 90th percentile in the existing SGS Lakefield impact database. The SGS database is not an 

absolute reference but rather a historical collection of all the impact indices that have been obtained from 

the various metallurgical samples tested by the laboratory. 

During the impact testwork, densities were also calculated for the three samples. These values ranged from 

2.74 to 2.81 which is in good agreement with the value of 2.72 which was utilized for mineralized rock. 

13.3.3 Coarse Ore Bottle Roll Leach 

A series of coarse ore bottle roll tests were performed on samples at different crushing sizes.  



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 53 

Results from the medium grade N2A sample coarse ore leach tests are summarized as follows: 

• Gold recoveries improved significantly as the material crushing size was decreased. Unlike the historical 

testwork results, a noticeable improvement was observed by decreasing the crushing size from 1/2" to 

1/4" or smaller. At 1/4" ultimate gold recoveries in excess of 60% appear possible as was observed with 

the historical data. 

• A crushing size of 1/2" appeared optimal for silver recoveries in excess of 40% (slightly higher than with 

historical testwork). 

As shown in Figure 17 and Figure 18 below, relatively slow gold leach kinetics with recoveries still increasing 

at a noticeable rate after 21 days (equivalent heap/column leach times are usually considerably longer than 

those observed with coarse ore tests). This information would tend to support the optimal leach times 

predicted from historical column leach testwork which were in excess of 90 days.

After 72 hours of leach time, the gold recovery to solution in both tests was close to 98% and the silver 

recovery was approximately 55%. Cyanide consumptions ranged from 2.2 kg/t to 2.3 kg/t in these tests. The 

results were very similar to the historical testwork completed by the CMRI in 1995. 

The key conclusions made from this ground ore cyanidation testwork included: 

• The gold in the La Fortuna samples is readily leachable and not encapsulated in the sulphide grains. 

This is further evidence that majority of the gold is present as free gold grains. 

• Excellent cyanidation recoveries (+97% for gold) are achievable even with coarse grind sizes of up to 

300 microns (sulphide grains in the ore are coarse in size). 

• Cyanide consumptions are reasonable at approximately 2 kg/t. 

• Leach times are fast with very little extra recovery of gold after the initial 24-hour leach period. 

13.3.5 Gravity Recovery 

A gravity-recoverable gold test was performed on the sample N2A using a lab-scale Knelson concentrator. 

This was a three-pass centrifugal Knelson concentrator test (250/100/75 microns). The gravity tails from the 

first pass through the Knelson are then ground to a finer size and run through the machine a second time. 

The procedure is then repeated a third time before a final gravity tailings product is achieved. The purpose 

of this technique is to obtain an overall gravity recoverable gold curve that can be used for process design. 

The test results are summarized in Table 11 and Figure 19 below. It can be seen the gold contained in the 

N2A Fortuna sample is very amenable to gravity separation techniques. This is further confirmation of the 

coarse nature of the gold grains in the mineralization. 

In summary, the gold in the La Fortuna deposit responds positively to gravity separation techniques. Ninety 

percent of gold is recoverable into concentrate containing 10% of the mass, which confirms/improves on 

historical data.

La Fortuna sample N2A was subjected to a series of rougher flotation tests at different grind sizes in order 

to examine the ultimate gold recoveries that might be achievable using this technique (assuming further 

downstream processing will be present). The results of the sample N2A single rougher flotation work are 

illustrated in Figure 20.

Overall, the testwork confirmed previous historical work that indicated rougher flotation recoveries of 96-

98% were possible. The key conclusions from this testwork are as follows: 

• Overall gold recoveries of +96% are possible using a single rougher flotation stage. 

• The optimal mass recoveries for the flotation stage appear to be approximately 10–15%. There is 

evidence that additional grind size optimization can reduce this mass recovery to <10% without 

sacrifice of overall recoveries. 

• The silver content is recovered with similar efficiencies to those observed for gold. This difference in 

the silver recoveries via flotation vs gravity techniques indicates that a significant portion of the silver 

content is likely present in the form of sulfo-salts. 

13.3.7 Ore Sorting 

In the 2008 test program, ore sorting to improve ore grade was also investigated. Ore sorting is common in 

Europe and other parts of world to upgrade ore prior to further processing. Two techniques were identified 

for testing: 

• Dual energy x-ray transmission (DEXRT) 

• Microwave heating and infrared temperature detection. 

The samples from N2 and N3 material were crushed to -1" and 200 particles within the size range +0.5" to 

1" were selected from both the N2 and N3 samples. One set of samples was delivered to Terra Vision for a 

DEXRT bench-scale study, whilst the other was used for microwave testing. 

Bench-Scale DEXRT Test 

The goal of the benchtop studies was to determine the feasibility of using an automated DEXRT ore sorter to 

separate gold mineralization into a high-grade product and a lower grade waste stream. Tests were 

performed by Terra Vision™ using a benchtop ore sorting system that separates various minerals on the 

basis of their colour, texture, x-ray transmission features and/or UV fluorescence characteristics. In the 

Fortuna deposit, the gold generally appears in close proximity to sulphide minerals (primarily pyrite) that 

should be distinguishable using DEXRT methods from the non-sulphide host rocks. 

The DEXRT tests showed promising results for both sets of samples as described above. Figure 21 and 

Figure 22 show the theoretical gold recovery vs mass-pull for both samples. These charts indicate that a 

good separation between product and waste is possible.

The results indicated that 85–90% of gold could be recovered into an upgraded concentrate with a mass 

recovery of 25%. The gold content of the product was 42 g/t from a feed head assay of 12 g/t for the high-

grade sample (N3) and 7 g/t for the low-grade material containing 1.46 g/t gold. 

The separation curves generated from the batch data are relatively sharp with the DEXRT sensors capable of 

detecting rocks down to low sulphide contents that equate to a gold content approaching 0.2–0.3 g/t. The 

testwork shows that in addition to producing high grade concentrate, there is also the potential for the 

DEXRT system to be used primarily for waste rejection achieving very high gold recoveries. In this 

arrangement, over 97% of the Au and 96.5% of the Ag can be extracted into 67% of the total sample mass. 

The grades associated with these recoveries were 21.5 g/t Au and 205 g/t Ag.

Production-Scale DEXRT Test 

The objective of these tests was to confirm the results generated in the Terra Vision benchtop tests using a 

full-scale DEXRT sorter. Several separations of high-grade and low-grade samples from La Fortuna property 

were undertaken on a production scale DEXRT unit in the Commodas lab in Germany.  

Figure 23 below illustrates concept of an ore sorting machine. 

 

Figure 23: Schematic of operation of a sorter 

Source: Terra Vision Report "CastleGold_DEXRT_Germany_2009.05.09_REV1" 

Samples from the La Fortuna deposit, referenced as N4 and N5, were provided to the Commodas lab to be 

sorted by a full-scale DEXRT sorter (MikroSort). Both samples were removed as coarse rock from exposed 

mineralized surfaces in one of the old adits at the La Fortuna mine site. Sample N4 was selected as a low-

grade sample, assumed to be similar to the N2 sample that was used to create the low-grade training set. 

Sample N5 was selected as a high-grade sample, assumed to be similar to the N3 sample that was used to 

create the high-grade training set. It should be noted that the assumed grades for both the N4 and N5 

samples were taken from previous available wall channel sampling and that neither sample was assayed 

directly prior to the sorting testwork as the coarse rock was shipped directly for upgrading. Training sets 

from the earlier benchtop tests were used to configure the MikroSort sorter prior to processing the new 

bulk samples. 

Samples N4 and N5 were crushed to -60 mm and each were screened into several size fractions. The 

following samples were used in sorting tests: 

• N4 and N5, +32 mm – 60 mm 

• N4 and N5, +16 mm – 32 mm 

• N4 and N5, +10 mm – 16 mm. 

The recovery curves for the tests are presented in Figure 24 and Figure 25. Sorting of the high grade N4 

sample shows similar results to those attained during the benchtop study with Au recoveries hovering

around 90% once the mass-pulls reach 25%. Also of note, all three particle sizes tested gave similar results 

indicating that fine crushing is not required to obtain efficient sorting separations.  

With the low-grade sample, a general recovery curve appears to be present but more scatter exists with 

respect to recoveries especially with the 32–60 mm rocks. Subsequent analysis of the test results indicated 

that sample N5 actually contained a very low initial gold content (0.7–0.8 g/t Au) which was well below 

expected values. Given the low starting point, the recoveries achieved during sorting are consistent with 

previous work demonstrating a limit to the sorting sensor sensitivity at a sulphide content equivalent to 

approximately 0.3 g/t Au. At these low sulphide levels, crushing below a size of 32 mm appears to 

significantly improve the sorting reliability.

Microwave Sorting 

The objective of this work was to study the possibility of upgrading a sample of La Fortuna ore by sorting 

rocks as a response to microwave radiation heating. Microwave heating/sorting is a new method at the 

early stage of testing by various sorting equipment manufacturers but is not yet commercially available. The 

lab-scale batch testwork was completed at the result of one of these manufacturers in order to expand their 

development database for the technology.  

The tests were performed on two samples taken from composites N2 and N3 described above. Microwave 

ore sorting on the high grade N3 sample achieved a 91 g/t concentrate grade at 90% gold recovery and 16% 

mass-pull from a head grade of 15.7 g/t. With the low-grade N2 sample, the sorting concentrate had a grade 

of 4.5 g/t at 75% gold recovery and 13% mass-pull. The tests indicated conceptually that the use of 

microwave pre-heating and sorting was capable of separating low-grade waste material prior to 

downstream gold recovery. The results largely confirmed the results from the DEXRT sorting work where 

rocks containing gold largely correlate with the presence of sulphides that can be detected by both systems. 

13.4 2016/2017 Testwork Program 

The 2016/2017 testwork program conducted at SGS (Lakefield) focused on improving and optimizing the 

results from previous programs in the 1990s and 2008 and obtaining additional information required for 

flowsheet development and equipment sizing purposes. Metallurgical work focused primarily of maximizing 

gold recovery by combinations of gravity and flotation and leaching in addition to determining physical 

parameters related to comminution, filtration etc. The program was successful, verifying and improving on 

previous results to provide a robust overall flowsheet for the potential development of the Project.  

13.4.1 Metallurgical Testwork Samples 

Two batches of mineralized material (quarter-core from 2007 twin holes) were sent to the SGS Lakefield 

facilities in January and July of 2016 for the planned testwork programs. Samples were identified as 

composite samples #1 and #2 with the drill core intervals and assays summarized in Table 12 and Table 13

The composite samples were selected to represent a range of higher (#1) and lower (#2) copper areas of the 

gold mineralized zones. An analysis was performed to illustrate that the Cu/Au relationships in both samples 

(red dots in figure) were reasonably representative of these areas of the deposit (graph below).

13.4.2 Mineralogy 

Both QEMSCAN and gold deportment studies were performed at different phases of the testwork program 

in order to have a more complete understanding of the make-up of the mineral assemblages in the deposit 

and the distribution of the gold.

Flotation Composite Feed  

Prior to the initiation of flotation studies, a sample of the flotation feed composite was subjected to a 

QEMSCAN evaluation at the SGS Lakefield Advanced Mineralogy Facility. Sulphides were identified primarily 

as pyrite with a minor amount of chalcopyrite. Other sulphides including galena and sphalerite were 

identified at trace levels. The grain size distributions for the various components in the mineralized sample 

(as received) are illustrated in the figure below. The pyrite grains are relatively coarse (d80 ~150 µm) and 

the chalcopyrite somewhat finer and similar to the quartz/feldspar components (d80~ 90–100 µm). Overall, 

the two primary sulphide minerals in the deposit (pyrite/chalcopyrite) are relatively coarse with majority of 

grains categorized as free or liberated (little locked sulphide material).

Bulk Concentrate Gold Deportment 

Following the initiation of flotation studies, a composite rougher flotation concentrate sample (referred to 

as F3F5 Com Ro Conc) was sent to the Advanced Mineralogy Facility at the SGS Lakefield site and prepared 

for bulk mineralogy and gold deportment study. The bulk concentrates had been produced via flotation at 

coarse grind sizes (d80 >200 µm). The mineralogical analysis was conducted with QEMSCAN analysis and a 

Tescan Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) to 

determine the mineralogical characteristics of the as-received samples. 

The sample was screened into three size fractions and analyzed without any pre-concentration. The gold 

grade was 27 g/t and the silver grade 383 g/t. Sulphur is 29.6%, copper 3.45%, iron 26.8%, arsenic 0.041%, 

antimony 0.15% and mercury 0.8 g/t.  

Gold mineralogy by SEM-EDS observed a total of 64 gold grains in the size fractions. The gold grains include 

electrum, native gold and Au-Ag-(Bi) tellurides and indicated that liberated gold accounts for 52%, exposed 

for 6%, and locked for 42%.The bulk mineralogy of samples obtained by QEMSCAN analysis consists mainly

The mass of gold minerals (%) as a function of grain size and gold exposure are shown in Figure 28 and 

Figure 29 below. Approximately 63% of the gold minerals occur as free and liberated, and 37% as locked. 

The analysis shows that the non-liberated gold minerals occur as binary middling particles with pyrite (32%), 

and as complex particles (6%). Gold minerals that are exposed at greater than >20% (surface area) account 

for 78% in the sample. Given the coarse grind sizes utilized prior to flotation the data obtained support the 

amenability of Fortuna mineralization to high gravity recoverable gold (GRG) recoveries and cyanide 

leachability.

13.4.3 Gravity Recoverable Gold 

Testwork was performed to examine the amenability of the flotation testwork composite to gold recovery 

by gravity separation. Samples were ground to the target size and then passed through a Knelson 

concentrator. A concentrate and a tailing were collected. The Knelson concentrate was upgraded on a 

Mozley table and the Mozley tailings then combined with the Knelson tailings and submitted for subsequent 

testwork. Tests G1 and G2 were performed on flotation composite. Test G3 was done on low-grade 

composite and material was ground to P80 of 305 microns. Table 15 presents the results from tests.

In addition, a three-pass gravity separation test (GRG) testwork was performed. The GRG testwork consists 

of an initial grind to a relatively coarse target size followed by a pass through the Knelson centrifugal 

concentrator. The tailings from this first pass are then ground finer and sent back through the concentrator 

for a second pass. This process is then repeated a third time at a final target size that is in the range of what 

would be expected during actual plant operations. The simulation is intended to provide an indication of the 

maximum amount of GRG that could be theoretically recovered during process plant grinding operations.  

The result presented in Table 16 indicate a potential for +80% gold recovery at 70–80 µ. This would be as 

expected given the mineralogical study results that demonstrated the majority of gold mass is present as 

free grains >40–50 µ. Gravity recovery and the required mass-pulls are shown below in Figure 30 and 

Figure 31.

Figure 31: GRG gold recovery vs Mass recovery (2.2 g/t sample), (Final G-1-2-3, GRG-1) 

The results from the recent gravity testwork studies largely mirror those from previous historical work. Due 

to process inefficiencies (and depending on where the centrifugal concentrator is included in the process) 

expected gravity recoveries during actual plant operations would be somewhat reduced from laboratory 

values. In addition, plant mass-pulls (and copper recoveries) are typically significantly less than those 

achieved in the laboratory due to the relatively small lab sample sizes which are processed. 

13.4.4 Flotation Concentration 

Historical flotation testwork at the La Fortuna Project demonstrated the potential for high gold recoveries 

via flotation. Both free gold and associated sulphides (pyrite/chalcopyrite) float easily. A series of tests was 

performed to examine the amenability of the flotation composite gravity tailings to gold extraction through 

flotation.

Bulk Flotation of Gravity Separation Tails 

Initial tests were completed using basic reagents (i.e. potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) collector and methyl 

isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) frother) achieved bulk flotation gold recoveries up to 98–99%. Gold sulphides also 

floated aggressively. Typical mass recoveries (mass-pulls) of 8–10% (maximum) were recorded. Bulk 

concentrate gold recoveries in the high 90s were achieved at a grind size of 300 µ (Figure 32). Table 18 

presents key element analysis of the bulk flotation concentrate.

Copper Cleaner Flotation 

A second phase of testwork was completed to examine the use of copper cleaner flotation following the 

bulk flotation to produce saleable copper concentrate approaching 20% (or greater) copper content. The 

goal of the cleaner flotation route was to provide the ability to regrind a bulk concentrate and use modified 

reagent scheme(s) to produce a salable copper concentrate prior to cyanidation of a flotation tail (if 

required). The elimination of copper sulphides prior to concentrate cyanidation can also significantly lower 

overall cyanide consumptions if the concentrate can be sold directly. 

Copper flotation response, including the results of locked-cycle test LCT1, is shown in Figure 33 below. 

Mass-pull, copper recoveries and grade of copper concentrate are presented in Table 19 and Table 20. Tests 

F13, F15, and LCT1 were performed using composite #1, and the rest using composite #2.

Both bench-scale and LCT test results confirmed that recovery of +90% of contained copper is attainable 

into a final concentrate grading approximately 20%. The copper concentrate contains high contents 

(1,500 g/t to 2,000 g/t) of silver that is saleable in concentrate but largely unleachable by conventional 

cyanidation (sulphides/sulfosalts unleachable in cyanide).

13.4.5 Cyanidation of Gravity Concentrates 

Testwork was completed to examine the cyanide leaching of gold from gravity concentrates. Cyanidation of 

gravity concentrate was performed on materials generated in gravity concentration tests. Three tests 

(CN-16, CN-32 and CN-33) were performed and results are given in Table 21 below.  

Test CN-16 examined the cyanide leach response of a low-grade composite gravity concentrate generated in 

the G-3 gravity concentration test. The leach was performed at 20% solids and maintained at 20 g/L NaCN in 

solution for 48 hours.

CN-32 and CN-33 were arranged as a two-stage cyanide leach using gravity concentrate from Mozley 

concentrates. The first stage (CN-32) was maintained at low cyanide strength (1.5 g/L) to monitor how 

quickly cyanide is consumed for the duration of the test and second stage (CN-33) was to determine the 

additional gold recovery from the CN-32 residue by intensive cyanidation at 20 g/L NaCN concentration.

Figure 34: Gravity concentrate leach curve 

Source: "Gravity Conc ICN.xls" 

Test results demonstrated that the gravity concentrate is readily available for leaching (i.e. gold is exposed) 

and not encapsulated. Leach recoveries are largely unaffected by original gold content in samples and gold 

leach kinetics are fast with recoveries typically at 96–98% in 24 hours leach time. The results also showed 

that elevated cyanidation concentrations only slightly improved gold recovery. 

Silver leach recovery was relatively low in the testwork and leach kinetics were slow. Additional testwork 

may be warranted to examine how intensive cyanidation can increase the silver recoveries. Oxygen assisted 

leaching will also improve both gold and silver recoveries. 

13.4.6 Grinding 

During the 2016 test program, additional grindability tests were performed.  

• The first test was done on material identified as heap leach composite which was drill core material 

that averaged approximately 2 g/t Au. The BWI of this material is reported at 16.1 kWh/t (metric).  

• An estimated modified BWI (named as MBI) was obtained for a flotation composite which was also 

material from drill core but was blended to get a higher grade of approximately of 4 g/t Au. The MBI of 

flotation composite is 15.6 kWh/t.  

• Later a grindability test was performed on a sample of sorting composite. The BWI of this material is 

18 kWh/t (metric), which is very similar to the results, 17.5–18.6 kWh/t, obtained from 2008 testwork. 

13.5 2016/2017 Testwork Conclusions 

The 2016/2017 test programs confirmed that gold in La Fortuna deposit is recoverable by most conventional 

extraction techniques. Although completed to a higher level of detail, this confirmed the results of historical 

work on the Project: 

• Gold is associated with sulphide content (primarily pyrite with minor chalcopyrite), which creates an 

opportunity to upgrade low-grade mineralization through ore sorting. DEXRT sorting techniques appear 

to be able to reject material containing approximately 0.3 g/t Au or less.

• GRG testwork indicates potential for +80% gold recovery at 70–80 microns, which provides opportunity 

to recovery majority of gold content by cyanide leach of gravity concentrate. Expected production plant 

recoveries would be 60–80% of this value depending on where the centrifugal concentrator(s) is placed 

in the process. 

• Bulk flotation gold recoveries up to 98–99% are achievable at typical mass recoveries of 8–10%. A 

combination of gravity with flotation concentration creates a robust process for achieving high gold 

(high 90s), copper and silver recoveries despite variations in ore mineralization already encountered. 

• Ability to produce saleable copper concentrate (~20% Cu content) prior to cyanide leach by regrinding 

bulk concentrate and using modified reagent scheme. Copper recoveries of +90% are achievable with 

~20% copper content. Removal of copper sulphides prior to downstream cyanidation (if required) 

significantly reduces overall process cyanide consumption due to removal of soluble copper species.  

• +90% gold contained in flotation concentrate reground to <75 microns is leachable in 48 hours.  

• Gold contained in gravity concentrate is leachable with extractions in the high 90s in 24 hours. Limited 

kinetics data indicates rapid leach within 8 to 12 hours. Leach recoveries/kinetics appear similar when 

at low (1.5 g/L) and high (20 g/L) cyanide strength.

14 Mineral Resource Estimates 

This PEA is based on a new mineral resource estimate prepared for the La Fortuna Project by Scott Zelligan, 

P.Geo. The resource estimate is based on the results from 125 core drillholes completed to date on the 

Project.  

14.1 Data 

Drillhole data (.csv files), wireframes (.dxf and .dtm files), and contours (.dwg and .str files) for this resource 

estimate were supplied by Minera Alamos and imported into GEOVIA Surpac™ software (version 6.3) and 

subsequently verified by standard internal Surpac™ processes. These .csv files contain collar, survey, 

lithological and assay data collated by Minera Alamos and confirmed by the author. Data includes 

underground wall sampling and diamond drill core. 

Minera Alamos supplied sectional interpretations, wireframes, contours, and string outlines to assist in 

modelling the deposit. These were imported and verified in Surpac™ software prior to implementation into 

the block model. These include, but are not limited to: 

• Hand-drawn geological cross sections and mining plans 

• Surface topography 

• Underground mine workings. 

Additional files provided by Minera Alamos included geological interpretations of the position and extent of 

individual mineralized structures. These were also imported into Surpac™ software, but were, in this 

situation, used as a guide in developing an independent interpretation by the author of the main zones of 

mineralization for the resource estimate. 

14.2 Interpretation 

14.2.1 Geological Interpretation 

The deposit is largely found within a zone of mineralized breccia/stockwork/veining hosted within a quartz 

monzonite pluton, overlain by rhyolites and andesites. The pluton is also intruded by dykes ranging from 

basaltic to andesitic composition. Tourmaline alteration dominates the mineralized envelope. 

Visual trends and statistical trends also indicate an internal network of vertical structures in the upper 

portions of the deposit within higher grade concentrations of mineralization; however, an attempt to 

wireframe these was unsuccessful, and these trends were represented naturally in the ID3 estimation. The 

highest grades occur at higher elevations, likely coinciding with stronger alteration. 

Distinguishing the zones of high and low grade by segregating the areas proved difficult, as there appears to 

be a gradual decrease in average grade down dip. This appears to be due to the density of mineralization, as 

opposed to a change in the style of mineralization. 

Grade-carrying structures visually appear to be in parallel planes to the overall dip of the mineralized 

breccia as elevation decreases. This was not entirely evident in variographic studies; however, holes drilled 

closer to down-dip in these areas did have larger ranges to the sill (approximately ~20 m vs ~10 m) in 

downhole variographic studies.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 74 

In order to represent this in the estimation, the lower portion of the deposit was estimated with an 

elongated search ellipse in the down dip and along strike directions. 

14.2.2 Wireframing 

Wireframes were constructed to represent the mineralized breccia volume and the barren dykes intruding 

the mineralized breccia encountered in the drill logs and in the Level 2 accessible adit. 

Figure 35 displays the modeled wireframes of the mineralized breccia volume (in red) and the barren dykes 

(in yellow). 

 

Figure 35: 3D orthogonal view of modeled wireframes: A – looking north; B – looking west; C – plan view (red – 
mineralized breccia, yellow – barren dykes) 

To test the validity of these models, and to determine the ideal method for treating the wireframe 

boundaries, contact profiles were generated, and are discussed in the next subsection.

14.2.3 Contact Profiles 

Contact profiles were generated to test the validity of the wireframe models and to determine the ideal 

method for treating wireframe boundaries. Contact plots were developed between the samples within the 

mineralized breccia volume and the external "waste" rock. 

This boundary appears to be hard/sharp for all metals based on these plots. Figure 36 to Figure 38 display 

the plots.

14.4 Compositing 

Assay results from drilling were composited to 2 m, as majority of the samples were either 2 m or 1 m and 

therefore this resulted in the least amount of unnecessary sample blending. 

Rather than force samples to exactly 2 m, the compositing process approximated as closely to 2 m as 

possible within each drillhole interval. 

Due to the nature of the contact boundary, the mineralized zone was composited separately from the lower 

grade host-rock. Barren dykes within the mineralized zone were not estimated. 

Absent data within the raw data set was assumed to be 0 grade. 

14.5 Outlier Management and Capping Strategy 

14.5.1 Gold 

Gold grades were capped at 30 g/t (after compositing) based on the histogram/probability plot analysis and 

decile analysis. This resulted in the capping of six samples and 3% of the total metal content.

14.5.2 Silver 

Silver grades were capped at 60 g/t based on the combined histogram/probability plot analysis and decile 

analysis. There is a portion of the database for which silver (Ag) assays appear to be "capped" at 50 g/t due 

to the samples assaying above the detection limit of the assay technique, which shows up as a big spike in 

the histogram and probability plot. These samples were never re-assayed to determine their actual value, so 

50 g/t is maintained in the sample database. This effectively acts as a second cap and results in a slightly 

conservative estimate of the higher-grade silver areas of the deposit.

14.6 Density 

A density of 2.65 t/m3 was chosen for the tonnage estimate. Dry bulk density studies were performed on 

the 2008 twin holes. Mineralized material had an average density of 2.72 t/m3, while the quartz monzonite 

material had an average density of 2.61 t/m3. The value of 2.65 was chosen by averaging the two then 

rounding down to the nearest 0.05 interval to be conservative. 

14.7 Previously Extracted Material 

The deposit has been explored since the 1880s, and two periods of minor exploitation occurred; in the late 

1800s, for which records are scarce, and in the 1980s, during which (reportedly) approximately 20,000 t 

were mined. Based on mapping of the adits, it has been calculated that the total extracted material is 

approximately 40,000 t. Since this only accounts for approximately 2% of the resource at the reported cut-

off, this has been ignored since it is well within the margin of error. Significantly, drilling at the site has 

encountered very few openings (and all openings have been set to 0 grade), and all drill results are from 

after the mining period, so no previously mined grades are being included in this resource.

Topography – translucent brown triangles; mineralized breccia – translucent red smoothed wireframe; adits – white solids. 

14.8  Interpolation Plan 

Inverse-distance-cubed (ID3) was chosen as the interpolation method. Variography was performed using 

various parameters and sample selections, however, the results were unsatisfactory. Drillhole spacing was 

generally in a good grid pattern which lends itself nicely to a more accurate and precise ID3 estimation. ID3 

was chosen over ID2 after both were tested iteratively, as the heavier weighting of closer samples better 

reflected the grade distribution in the sample data. 

Due to the geometry of the deposit and the nature of the grade distribution, as discussed in Section 14.2, 

the estimation was divided between the upper and lower portions of the mineralized volume (see 

Figure 43). This was only used to restrict which blocks (either those enclosed in the upper or lower zones of 

the mineralized volume) were estimated during which estimation run (discussed in Section 14.9), not which 

samples were used, so that blocks in the upper zone were estimated isotropically, while those in the lower 

zone were estimated using an anisotropy parallel to the dip of that portion of the mineralized volume. 

These parameters are discussed in Section 14.9.

14.9  Block Model Parameters 

The Block Model was created with parent cells of 5 x 5 x 5 m, and a minimum sub-cell size of 0.625 x 0.625 x 

0.625 m. Four interpolations were performed to populate the final grades into the block model. Both the 

blocks in the upper and lower zones were estimated using two search ellipses, each with a smaller search 

ellipse to estimate the best-informed blocks, and then a larger search ellipse to fill out those with wider 

spacing between samples. As discussed previously, the lower zone interpolation was performed using an 

anisotropy parallel with the zone to better reflect sample grade distribution. Table 24 and Table 25 display 

the search parameters and estimation parameters used in the estimation.

RESCAT Integer - Resource classification (0 – Unclassified, 1 – Measured, 2 – Indicated, 3 – Inferred) 

14.10.3 Resource Categorization 

Mineral Resource classification is the application of Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories, in order of 

decreasing geological confidence, to the resource block model. These are CIM definition standards (adopted 

by the CIM Council on 10 May 2014) for reporting on mineral resources and reserves, which are 

incorporated, by reference, in NI 43-101.As per CIM (2014): 

Measured Resource 

A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the 
application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit. 

Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is 
sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. 

Indicated Resource 

An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the 
application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit. 

Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. 

Inferred Resource 

An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality 
are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient 
to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. 



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 84 

These categories are applied in consideration of, but not limited to, drill and sample spacing, QAQC, deposit-

type and mineralization continuity, surface and/or underground mineralization exposure and/or prior 

mining experience. With respect to resource classification of the La Fortuna deposit, a combination of a 

constraining wireframe and the search ellipse of the estimated block was employed to best capture the data 

density and therefore confidence of the estimated value. 

Measured Resources were constrained within a wireframe designed to limit them to the most highly 

informed (approximate minimum drillhole spacing of approximately <15 m) part of the host mineralized 

breccia, and to estimated blocks from the first search ellipse pass (see Section 14.9). 

Indicated Resources were constrained within a wireframe designed to limit them to an informing drillhole 

spacing of approximately <25 m). 

Inferred Resources were all other estimated blocks within the host mineralized breccia. 

14.11 Model Validation 

14.11.1 Statistics 

As in all estimates, the grade average between the estimate and the originating samples has lowered. This is 

common in part because sampling is inevitably clustered around high-grade areas, creating a bias in the 

input which is rectified geometrically in the estimation process. Capping also plays a role in this effect.

14.11.2 Population Distribution 

Histograms are used to determine whether the population distribution has been accurately maintained in 

the estimation process. This ensures that the data has not been unnecessarily smoothed.  

The three metals appear to follow the assay histograms well, indicating the estimation is a good 

representation of the population distribution.

Geographic trends are validated using swath plots. This can identify over-smoothing as well as high grade 

over-spreading. In this instance, the swath plots confirm the correlation between drillhole assays and 

estimated grades in all directions. Some variation exists around the margins of the deposit, in areas 

classified as Inferred. However, the tonnages are very low in these areas.

14.12 Mineral Resources 

For reporting purposes, the La Fortuna Mineral Resource is tabulated at various Au (g/t) cut-offs (Table 31). 

A cut-off of 1.0 g/t was chosen based on the results of metallurgical and rock-sorting studies and is 

considered reasonable and consistent for this type of deposit with open pit mining methods.

Notes: 

1. The effective date for this Mineral Resource estimate for La Fortuna Project is 13 July 2018. All material tonnes and metal values 
are undiluted. 

2. Mineral Resources are calculated assuming a cut-off grade of 1.0 g/t Au, which is considered reasonable and consistent for this 
type of deposit with open pit mining methods. 

3. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources 
may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues. 

4. The Mineral Resources presented here were estimated using a block model with a parent block size of 5 m x 5 m x 5 m sub-
blocked to a minimum block size of 0.6 m x 0.6 m x 0.6 m using ID3 methods for grade estimation as this method best 
represented the grade distribution in the sample data. 

5. Due to the geometry of the deposit and the nature of the grade distribution, the estimation was divided between the upper and 
lower portions of the mineralized volume with search parameters optimized for each portion. 

6. Individual composite assays were capped at the following values according to histogram/probability and decile analyses – 30 g/t 
gold, 60 g/t silver, 1% copper. 

7. A density of 2.65 t/m3 was chosen for the tonnage estimate. Data available from dry bulk density studies indicated an average 
density of 2.72 t/m3 for mineralized material, while the quartz monzonite material had an average density of 2.61 t/m3. The 
value of 2.65 was chosen by averaging the two then rounding down to the nearest 0.05 interval to be conservative. 

8. The Mineral Resources presented here were estimated using the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions 
and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council 10 May 2014. 

9. The Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by Scott Zelligan, B.Sc., P.Geo., and independent resource geologist of Coldwater, 
Ontario. 

10. Gold price is US$1,250/oz, silver price is US$16/oz, and copper price is US$5,725/t. 

11. The number of metric tonnes is rounded to the nearest hundred. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects.

16 Mining Methods 

16.1 Introduction 

Mineralization at La Fortuna extends close to surface and is amenable to conventional open pit methods 

utilizing front-end loaders and trucks. Pit bench heights are assumed to be 5 m in order to provide good 

ore/waste selectivity, although the use of larger bench heights in zones consisting predominantly of waste 

should be considered as part of future optimization studies.  

Overall average pit slopes with the benches/ramps in place are approximately 43° for three sides and 41° 

overall for the north wall. Rock competency is reasonable and higher pit slopes may be considered once the 

appropriate geotechnical information is available.  

Mineralized and waste material will be hauled using 25-t trucks approximately 500 m (maximum) to the 

mineralized stockpile and waste dump locations near the mine. Crushed stockpile material is then 

transported to the plant processing facilities located at a distance of less than 1.5 km from the mine. 

16.2 Production 

Using a preliminary Whittle pit shell (based on US$1,250/oz gold, US$2.50/t mining, US$30.00/t processing, 

95% recovery, 45° pit slopes) as a guide, a full open pit mine plan was completed.  

Material from the pit benches was categorized as Very High Grade or "VHG" (>2.0 g/t Au), High Grade or 

"HG" (1.6–2.0 g/t Au), Medium Grade or "MG" (1.2–1.6 g/t Au), and Low Grade or "LG" (0.8–1.2 g/t Au) 

zones. Inter-zone dilution and losses have been applied; VHG and HG have 10% dilution and 10% losses, MG 

and LG have 25% dilution and 25% losses. VHG and HG (i.e. >1.6 g/t Au) were assumed to be direct milling 

material whereas the MG and LG (i.e. 0.8–1.6 g/t Au) are stockpiled and upgraded via ore sorting. Further 

optimization efforts should be aimed at cut-off grade optimization studies and the smoothing of waste 

mining activities. No Inferred Resources were utilized in the PEA mine planning. Cut-off grades and dilution 

grades are shown in Table 32 and the proposed mill feed schedule shown in Table 33 below.

17 Recovery Methods 

A simplified base case process was utilized for the La Fortuna PEA plant site. Mineralized material from the 

mine is stockpiled and crushed to a size of <3/4" prior to being transported to the process plant. The overall 

processing facilities consist of a primary coarse grind to 80% passing 250–300 microns followed by a bulk 

sulphide concentrate flotation. Bulk concentrate is reground (80 microns) prior to a final flotation producing 

a copper concentrate. Centrifugal gravity gold recovery circuits are included in both the primary and 

concentrate reground circuits to extract free gold as a concentrate. Tailings from the flotation circuit are 

dewatered via filtration and dry-stacked in the tailings containment area adjacent to the processing plant. 

Overall gold recovery for the PEA study has been conservatively estimated at 90%. No final gold refining 

facilities are to be constructed at the Fortuna site although this decision can be revisited in the future 

should site production rates increase. Approximately half of the gold is extracted as a gravity concentrate 

which will be cyanide leached at site and loaded onto activated carbon for shipping outside of Mexico for 

final doré production. The other half of the recovered gold ends up in the copper flotation concentrate 

(along with majority of the copper and silver) which is filtered and transported to the port facilities at 

Guaymas (approximately 500 km) for final sale.  

Minera Alamos has purchased a used 2,000 tonnes per day (t/d) processing facility 

(grinding/flotation/filtration) that has been used as the basis for the La Fortuna Project processing facilities. 

The size of the major equipment items allows for plant throughput to be increased from the currently 

assumed 1,100 t/d rate as the size of the project resource increases.  

DEXTR (x-ray) ore sorting has been included in the overall project plans as a method to upgrade mid-grade 

(0.8–2.0 g/t Au) mineralized material from the mine (and future potential project resources). Testwork has 

demonstrated that sorting of this material at normal project crush sizes can recover +80% of the contained 

gold into a sorted concentrate with gold contents similar to the high grade (3.5–4.0 g/t Au) direct milling 

material from the mine. It is conservatively assumed that an ore sorting machine will be purchased and 

installed in Year 3 of mining operations to upgrade this material. During Years 1 and 2, the mined mid-grade 

material will be stockpiled for processing starting in Year 3. In the current operations plan, only 20% of the 

life of mine (LOM) contained gold ounces sent to the processing plant have been upgraded in this manner.

17.1 Current Flowsheet 

The 2016/2017 testwork suggested the issue of elevated cyanide consumption (due to the presence of 
copper) and low silver recovery (due to the silver occurring mainly as sulphides and sulphosalts) could be 
better addressed by flotation of the gravity tails and sale of the copper/silver/gold concentrate. Based on 



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 103 

the successful results of this testwork program, a proposed flowsheet is shown in the Process Description 
hereafter.  

This flowsheet has assumed the potential to cyanide leach the flotation tail; however, this option is 
currently not likely to be economic as it contains less than 5% of the gold. This decision can be revisited in 
the future should the project resources expand and the economics surrounding the additional cyanidation 
stages are positive. 

17.2 Process Description 

17.2.1 Crushing and Stockpiling 

Portable crushing and screening equipment will be utilized at the mine site to process approximately 1,200 t 

daily. Crushing operations are planned as a two-stage circuit with a screen to separate the final product size 

material for grinding.  

Crushing will be performed on a nominal six days per week schedule. Coarse ore and fine (crushed) ore 

stockpiles are utilized to separate the mining and milling operation.  

Run of mine (ROM) material is trucked to the crushing plant and dumped into stockpiles located near the 

crushing equipment. The two-stage crushing reduces the rock from a maximum feed size of 400 mm down 

to 80% passing 18 mm. The crushed material is trucked to two fine (crushed) ore stockpiles feeding to each 

mill.  

An external contractor will supply and operate the crushing equipment as well as the transfer of crushed 

coarse material to the stockpiles located at the mill site. All crushing and transfer equipment will be 

portable in nature and independently powered via diesel drives. 

17.2.2 Process Plant 

Based on the metallurgical testwork completed on samples of the La Fortuna mineralization, the process 

plant for the recovery of gold, silver and copper concentrates includes the following basic stages: 

1) Single-stage primary grinding with ball mills to produce material of 80% passing 300 microns. 

2) Production of a gold concentrate via the use of centrifugal gravity concentrators incorporated into the 

primary grinding circuit. 

3) Bulk flotation on the gravity concentrator tails to produce a sulphide/gold bulk concentrate. 

4) Regrinding of the bulk concentrate and cleaner flotation to produce a copper/silver concentrate for 

sale. 

5) Production of additional gravity gold concentrate via the use of centrifugal gravity concentrators 

incorporated into the regrinding circuit. 

6) Thickening of the bulk flotation tailings for filtration and containment at site. 

7) Cyanide leaching of the gravity concentrates to extract the gold/silver. 

8) Recovery of gold/silver from leach solutions to produce a concentrate (on carbon) for shipment for 

final gold/silver production. 

9) Treatment of a "bleed" stream from the solution not recycled to leaching to destroy any residual 

cyanide prior to its disposal to tailings. 

The overall flow of the process stages is shown in Figure 56 below.

Grinding and Gravity Concentration  

Crushed material is reclaimed from the stockpile on a seven-days-per-week basis at a rate of approximately 

1,200 t/d by a front-end loader and is dumped into two parallel reclaim hoppers with feeders feeding to two 

parallel primary grinding mills. Rock is ground from particle size F80 of 18 mm down to P80 of approximately 

300 µ. 

Discharges from the two ball mills are collected in a common pump box and then pumped to a centrifugal 

gravity concentrator for "free" gold recovery. The gravity concentrator tail slurry is pumped to a 

hydrocyclone for size classification. Cyclone underflow returns to the ball mills which are operated in a wet-

overflow-closed-circuit arrangement with a circulating load. Final cyclone overflow with a particle size of 

80% passing 250 µ flows by gravity to a flotation conditioning tank where it is mixed with reagents prior to 

feeding to the bulk flotation stage.  

Gravity concentrate from the centrifugal concentrators is regularly removed and pumped to gravity 

concentrate cyanide leach circuit for gold recovery. A semi-batch automatic centre discharge centrifugal 

concentrator has been assumed.  

Bulk Flotation  

A bulk rougher flotation line is incorporated for the bulk flotation stage which produces a copper/gold/silver 

rougher concentrate. The slurry from the grinding circuit is pumped to a conditioning tank where lime and 

flotation reagents are added at their pre-determined dosages to adjust pH and prepare for flotation.  

Mill process water is also added (as required) to adjust slurry density prior to flotation. Rougher concentrate 

is collected via concentrate launders to the concentrate pump box from where it is pumped to the 

concentrate regrinding area.  

Rougher tails are collected in a pump box and pumped to a bulk flotation tailings thickener for dewatering 

and filtration prior to being disposed to the tailings containment area.  

Overall, the mass recovery in the bulk flotation stage is estimated at 8–10% of mill feed with gold/silver 

recoveries of +95% (combined flotation + gravity recovery)  

Regrinding and Copper Flotation  

The bulk concentrate needs to be further reduced in size prior to copper flotation. Concentrate is pumped 

to a regrinding ball mill operating in closed circuit with an additional centrifugal gravity concentrator for 

gold recovery and a hydrocyclone for size classification. The size of the bulk concentrate particles is reduced 

from a F80 of approximately 250 µ to a P80 of less than 80 µ.  

Following regrinding the concentrate is pumped to a conditioning tank where it is mixed with further 

flotation reagents added at pre-set doses. The conditioned slurry then passes through a series of cleaner 

flotation cells where a copper/silver/gold concentrate is produced. Final concentrate flows through 

overflow launders into a pump box where it is pumped to a Cu concentrate thickener followed by a filter for 

solid/liquid separation. Wet filter cake is collected and loaded into trucks for transport to be sold.  

Final flotation tailings from the cleaner separation stages consists of a sulphide (primarily pyrite) containing 

some residual gold (4–5% of total feed to the mill). In the future consideration can be given to processing 

this material in a cyanide leaching circuit for additional gold/silver recovery.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 106 

Gravity Concentrate Leaching  

Based on test results, the La Fortuna ore gravity concentrate does not require intensive cyanide leaching to 

recover contained gold. The leach flowsheet is designed to operate in a batch mode, using two tanks 

alternatively. 

Gravity concentrates from the primary and regrinding gravity concentrators are pumped to a decant tank in 

the gravity gold leaching area to drain excess water. Slurry from the decant tank is fed to one of two leach 

tanks. To start leach, fresh cyanide solution, milk of lime, as well as compressed air are added to the tank. 

When leaching completed after 24 hours, slurry is pumped to the carbon column circuit for gold recovery. In 

the future should a pyrite leach area be included this slurry can be pumped to that circuit where residue 

gold can be further recovered, and remaining cyanide can be consumed for pyrite leaching.  

Flotation Concentrate (Pyrite) Leaching [For Future Consideration Only] 

The pyrite leach is completed in six agitated tanks arranged in steps allowing for gravity flow. Tanks are 

sized to provide a total leach time of approximately 48 hours to achieve +95% gold extraction. Final flotation 

tails (pyrite) is pumped to the first tank where it is combined with recycled and fresh cyanide solution and 

then flows by gravity to next tank. Compressed air is sparged from bottom into each tank to provide oxygen 

essential to dissolve gold into leach solution. 

Slurry discharging from the last leach tank is collected in a filter feed tank prior to be pumped to a pressure 

filter. Filtrate containing dissolved gold and silver is pumped to the carbon column gold recovery circuit. Mill 

process water containing no cyanide is used to wash the final filter cake to remove any residual soluble 

gold, silver and cyanide prior to being discharged and sent to tailings containment. 

Precious Metals Recovery  

Gold and silver are recovered from the pregnant leach solution through a series of columns filled with 

activated carbon. Solution is pumped to the first column in series where it flows up through the bed of 

carbon and then overflows from the top of the column to pass through the next column in series. The 

process repeats itself until the solution exits the final column, via a carbon safety screen catching fine 

carbon particles, to a barren overflow tank from where it is pumped to a cyanide process water tank for 

recycle.  

During the carbon recovery stage gold/silver cyanide species contained in solution are adsorbed into the 

porous activated carbon particles. When carbon in a column reaches maximum loading capacity (typically 

containing +5 kg/t of combined gold/silver) this column is bypassed and taken off the circuit and the "rich" 

carbon in the column is removed. The carbon is loaded into porous polypropylene bulk bags that are hung 

from frames to allow the bulk of the liquid to drain so it can be captured and reused. Once no further free 

liquid remains, the bags of rich carbon are transported off site for final gold/silver recover. Fresh carbon is 

loaded into the empty column which will be placed back to the circuit.  

Tailings Containment  

An allowance has been included for the installation of a filtered tailings system. Flotation tailings are 

pumped to a conventional thickening system with recovered water returned to the plant process water tank 

where it is combined with fresh water for plant requirements. Plans have been completed for the design of 

the tailings containment strategy which includes the installation of vacuum disk filtration equipment for the 

production of final solids that are then transported by truck to a nearby containment area where they are

distributed and compacted. Additional studies are to be completed to look at potential improvements 

including pressure filtration, staged containment construction, etc. 

Reagents  

Reagent preparation and storage facilities have been included in the design, including: 

• Lime mixing and holding tanks with distribution pumps to deliver milk of lime to various process users 

• Reagent preparation and storage for various flotation reagents defined by preliminary testwork 

• Flocculant preparation unit. 

Water Management  

Fresh water and process water tanks are included in the design. Gland water required for some slurry 

pumps will be taken from the fresh water tank and delivered to users by dedicated gland water pumps. Two 

tanks are provided to store mill water and CN containing process water separately. Each tank is designed 

with a four-hour retention time. Both process water tanks are placed at an elevated location which allows 

water to flow to the plant by gravity.  

Compressed Air  

Air compressors are provided for process and instrumentation application. An air dryer is provided to dry 

the compressed air before its being distributed to various instrument air users. Dedicated blowers are 

provided for flotation air to all flotation stages.  

Fuel and Power Requirement  

Fuel required in the plant is mainly diesel for mobile equipment, such as front-end loader for crushed 

material reclaiming from stockpile. A fuel storage and handling system is provided for dispensing diesel. The 

installed operating power for the process plant, including warehouse, lab and office is estimated at about 

2 MW. Diesel power generators are included in the design to meet plant power demand.

18 Project Infrastructure 

Given the early stage of development, there is limited infrastructure currently available at the La Fortuna 

Project site. 

18.1 Access 

The La Fortuna Project is accessible by road from Culiacan (Sinaloa state capital), a driving distance of 

approximately 100 km (Figure 57). The quality of the road is variable. On an annual basis, the government 

has been upgrading the road in the direction of the Project by widening it and paving the surface in both 

directions. Ultimately it will pass through the southern concession limits and continue to the northeast 

towards Chihuahua. The project completion date is currently unknown. Along with the upgrading of the 

highway, grid electricity that is being extended along the side of the highway.  

 

Figure 57: La Fortuna Project site location 

At present the road is paved to within approximately 30 km of the town El Barco which is situated at the 

river immediately south of the Project area. The remaining road is graveled, graded and of reasonable width 

for much of the route. Sections can be rough and deeply cut into the steeply inclined bedrock resulting in 



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 109 

the road being steep and narrow in places. It would be anticipated that some relatively minor upgrading of 

portions of this road (primarily in areas with a sharp turning radius) will be required in order to improve 

access for larger trucks to access the La Fortuna Project area. 

A large metal barge is present at El Barco and utilized for the short river crossing to the road which enters 

the La Fortuna mine area and provides access to the small local towns in the area. The current barge is 

sufficient for the transport vehicles up to the size of normal non-articulated highway trucks. Larger loads 

will need to be unloaded in El Barco and transported via smaller trucks to the mine. It is possible that in the 

future the river crossing could be enhanced via a larger barge or the construction of a concrete "vado" type 

structure. However, Minera Alamos believe the current infrastructure is sufficient for the planned 

construction and operation of the Project. 

During the much of the year (excluding the rain seasons) access conditions along sections of the final gravel 

road can improved by utilizing wide areas of exposed river gravel beds as bypass routes. It is anticipated 

that during construction and with later operations that the company will utilize this window to transport 

larger loads of supplies which can then be stored/warehoused at site for use during the rainy season.  

Preliminary engineering has been completed to locate new access roads required for start of the La Fortuna 

Project operations. This includes a total of approximately 5 km of gravel surface suitable for the operation 

of mining trucks. 

• Road from planned open pit to new processing plant area – 1.5 km 

• Initial mine truck access roads around planned open pit – 2 km 

• Miscellaneous additional access roads around mine/plant (i.e. to crushing area, tailings, etc) – 1.5 km. 

A full evaluation of the upgrades required to existing gravel roads around the Project area has yet to be to 

be completed. General work activities include:  

• Widening of sections of existing local roads that pass through the project concession area near the 

planned mining operations in order to better accommodate two-way truck traffic. 

• Reworking sections of the existing gravel road extending from the main paved highway (from Culiacan) 

to El Barco. This will be focused primarily on short radius curves in the road that will need to be 

widened and modified in at least five or six locations. 

18.2 Power 

The closest small villages to the Project site are El Barco and San Fernando. Both areas have less than 100 

inhabitants and are not serviced via the national power grid. Grid power is being extended along the state 

highway from Culiacan as it is widened and paved. Currently, it comes within approximately 30 km from the 

town of El Barco in the southern part of the La Fortuna concession area. It is unknown when grid power will 

ultimately be available at the site and what load capacity would be available.  

For the purposes of this study, it is assumed for the foreseeable future that all power required for the 

Fortuna project will be generated at site via diesel generators. The total operating plant power load is 

estimated at approximately 2 MW which will be supplied via multiple generator units (operating + standby) 

to build in redundancy for maintenance, etc. Primary generators are to be located within close proximity to 

the processing plant area, so site powerline requirements will be negligible. Wherever possible, large power 

consumers not associated with the processing plant (i.e. portable crushers) will be self-contained with local 

diesel hydraulic/electric generation. Small auxiliary generators will be utilized as necessary for minor 

requirements (i.e. plant camp/offices). 



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 110 

Typical diesel power generation consumes 0.25–0.30 L/kWh. At current fuel prices in Mexico, this is 

equivalent to an electric power cost of US$0.25–0.30/kWh, which has been used for budgeting. Should grid 

power eventually arrive at the Project area, power costs for the Project would be reduced by 50% or more. 

18.2.1 Process Plant Power Requirements 

Based on the PEA mill flowsheet as previously described, the estimated process plant operating power 

requirements are detailed below. 

Table 37: Estimated mill power requirements 

Plant area Operating load (kW) 

Primary grinding 1,240 

Bulk flotation 310 

Bulk concentrate regrinding and Cu flotation 220 

Cyanidation and carbon columns 50 

Reagents/Fuel/Water 50 

Air supply 140 

Total Process Plant 2,010 

18.3 Water Management 

The Humaya River flows roughly northwest-southeast approximately 500 m from the planned La Fortuna 

processing plant area. This river has a year-round supply of flowing surface water and discussions with the 

relevant permitting authorities have indicated that the project would be permitted to extract river water 

directly for processing uses. In addition, a seasonal creek bed that runs east-west and connects with the 

Humaya River is located a few hundred metres south of the plant site. Although hydrogeological studies 

have not been completed, it is likely that sources of groundwater suitable for the project's requirement also 

exist in this southern area. 

Based on local observations, it is expected that river/groundwater levels occur at the 250–300 m elevation 

(above sea level). Water would be pumped from this elevation the short distance to the plant site which is 

located just above 500 m (above sea level). Process water removed from the plant filtered tailings will also 

be recycled as much as possible in order to minimize fresh process water make-up requirements. Overall 

make-up water requirements are currently estimated at less than 20 m3/hr. 

18.4 Tailings 

As part of the ongoing La Fortuna Project environmental permitting process, Especialistas en Ciencias de la 

Tierra (ECT – Earth Sciences Specialists) was commissioned to complete a dry-filtered tailings study. The 

following information is taken directly from that report (Design of the mine tailings disposal site "La 

Fortuna" – April 2018) the details of which were also included in the Project permitting documentation.  

The scope of the tailings facilities design work which has been completed to date includes: 

• Field work: Topography, geophysics, geology and soil mechanics 

• Laboratory work: Soil mechanics 

• Office work: Geometry design, stability analysis, building procedures, basic instrumentation during the 

operational and close-out phases 

• Hydrologic study and design of hydraulic constructions.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 111 

A Project site review identified two ideal areas for the disposal of filtered tailings located within close 

proximity to the La Fortuna process plant area (Figure 58). The "Phase 2" (Etapa 2) area was selected for the 

initial Fortuna tailings containment area with the "Phase 1" (Etapa 1) area available for future development 

if the project resource base is increased. The total estimated containment capacity for the Phase 2 tailings 

containment facility (TCF) design is 1.4 MM m3 which equates to approximately 2.5 MM tonnes of dry 

tailings solids which is more than sufficient for the current La Fortuna Project resource base. 

 

Figure 58: La Fortuna Project available tailings containment areas 

Samples of tailings material from the metallurgical testwork programs completed at SGS Lakefield Research 

in Canada were submitted to both ECT (for determination of TCF design parameters) and also to CEC Mining 

Systems for evaluation to determine the sizing of the ceramic disk tailings filtration units currently planned 

for the Project. Laboratory testwork evaluations by ECT established the basic geotechnical design 

parameters to be utilized for the ultimate designs. A brief summary of these parameters includes: 

• Ultimate compacted density: 1.75 t/m3 (dry solids) 

• Internal friction angle: >30° 

• Final compacted moisture content: 10–13%. 

Using these parameters, a tailings design geometry was completed consisting of a 20,000 m3 initiator dam 

followed by six phases of tailings deposition/compaction (see Figure 59). Each phase consists of a 15 m lift 

of material with 8 m wide berms sufficient for access at each level. The overall slopes guiding the design are 

approximately 1.8H:1V which is equivalent to an angle of 29°. The volumes for each phase of the TCF 

construction are summarized below.

Figure 59: TCF 

The basic construction of the TCF is as follows: 

• Removal of all organics, soil cover and weathered rock within the TCF area. 

• Construction of the initiator dam in 30 cm compacted layers until the ultimate dam height is reached. 

• Construction of the site drainage channels and hydraulic protection structures. 

• Deposition of filtered tailings material in 30 cm lifts followed by compaction. 

• Following the completion of three layers above the initiator dam, the slopes are to be covered with an 

erosion protection layer consisting of <15 cm crushed rocks. Low-grade ore (or waste) from the mine 

can be utilized for the cover layer material. 

A network of hydraulic protection structures is incorporated into the design and are illustrated in Figure 60. 

These include: 

• An upper diversion channel to collect any runoff coming from elevations above the compacted tailings 

complete with a weir structure to divert the flow to the base of the TCF 

• Lateral protection channels on the left and right sides of the area 

• A central gallery through the middle of the design area to allow for the draining of any water coming 

from the basin during the construction and deposition of tailings material. 

Detailed specifications are provided for all phases of the construction including the hydraulic protection 

features. In addition, surface benchmarks are to be installed in order to monitor movements within the 

deposit.

18.5 Other Infrastructure 

Other infrastructure at the project includes an office, lab, warehouse and truck shop. An allowance has been 

made for the truck shop area, but the shop structure(s) will be provided by the mine contractor as is 

common practice in Mexico. Detailed designs for the other items have not been completed but basic area 

allowances have been included in the site arrangements for permitting. Simple buildings are planned with a 

combination of trailers/container units and locally constructed concrete block structures. Only very basic lab 

services are planned for the site with majority of samples/analysis being completed in the Culiacan area at 

third party facilities. 

18.6 General and Administration 

The PEA model is based on the assumption that Minera Alamos will provide overall site management, 

technical support and surface and mill personnel. Mining and crushing activities will be completed by 

contractors and all personnel other than high level supervision and planning are included in the contractor 

costs.  

It is anticipated that wherever possible basic operations labour will be sourced locally from the San 

Fernando area or other small nearby villages. Management and more skilled personnel that are not locally 

available can be sourced from the Culiacan general area and basic camp facilities suitable for 30 people 

have been included in the Project plans. Minera Alamos will provide basic transportation services (by road) 

for operations personnel. 

Minera Alamos maintains and existing office in Culiacan that is capable of managing 

administrative/accounting functions for the Project as part of its overall operations activities. The Culiacan 

area is a major industrial center and capable of providing all basic supplies and contract services required 

for the Project operations.

19 Market Studies and Contracts  

19.1 Products 

The La Fortuna Project will produce two salable products: 

• A gold gravity concentrate, which is leached with cyanide and then absorbed onto activated carbon for 

shipment off-site for final processing 

• A copper flotation concentrate, which also contains the remaining recoverable gold as well as majority 

of the recovered silver. 

19.1.1 Gold-Loaded Carbon 

Minera Alamos management have been involved with a number of previous projects in Mexico and Latin 

America where gold-loaded carbon was loaded into 1 m3 super-sacs and shipped off-site for final 

processing. Current processing costs for the carbon are approximately US$1,000/t and the final doré is then 

shipped to a refiner for final processing and payment. It is currently planned for the carbon processing to be 

completed in the southern US with doré shipped to any one of the well-known refineries in the area.  

19.1.2 Copper/Precious Metals Concentrate 

Testwork has demonstrated that a copper flotation concentrate can be produced at the La Fortuna Project 

with extremely high (+90%) recoveries of gold/silver remaining in the mineral slurries after gravity recovery 

has been completed. Copper grades in the high teens (approaching 20%) are easily achievable with gold and 

silver contents of +100 g/t and 1,000–2,000 g/t, respectively. Minera Alamos has provided concentrate 

specifications to a couple of trading groups active in Mexico to confirm concentrate salability. Concentrate 

can be shipped by truck from the site to the port of Guaymas on the Pacific coast of Mexico which is located 

approximately 500 km by road from the site. 

For the purposes of the current economic models, the standard copper concentrate treatment terms have 

been assumed. Minera Alamos is currently in discussions to best optimize final concentrate treatment 

facilities and terms. 

Concentrate payables: 

• Cu:   Min  Max  Payable 

o Below 15%  96.5%, subject to minimum deduction of 1.5 units

20 Environmental Studies, Permitting, and 
Social or Community Impact 

20.1 Environmental Impact Assessment Permitting 

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for mining projects in Mexico starts with an application for the 

following primary permitting documents:  

• MIA - Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental (Environmental Impact Statement) 

• ETJ – Estudio Tecnico Justificativo (Technical Justification Study) that includes the Estudio de Riesgo 

(Risk Study) and PPA - Programa de Prevención de Accidentes (Accident Prevention Program). 

The MIA-ETJ permit applications were submitted by Minera Alamos for the La Fortuna Project early in 2018 

and are pending. The submitted permitting documents included an expanded scope of processing facilities 

that included additional stages not required for the current start-up plan (i.e. concentrate cyanidation and 

detoxification). This provides the Company with added flexibility in the future to modify the existing 

operation in order to accommodate new potential regional sources of mineralization. 

Descriptions of the major permitting requirements and documents are provided below.  

20.1.1 MIA – Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental (Environmental Impact Statement) 

The objective of this document is to evaluate, mitigate, and communicate the potential environment effects 

related to the Project. The MIA should include: 

• General project information 

• Mine construction and operation plans 

• Description of the physical, natural, and social environment where the project will be developed 

• Description of the measures and designs that will be implemented to comply with the environmental 

norms 

• Identification and evaluation of potential impacts 

• Description of the proposed mitigation measures for the identified impacts. 

MIAs include detailed analyses of the following subjects: soil, water, vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources, 

and socio-economic impact. Waste water discharges into national bodies of water, and waste water 

infiltration into soil where groundwater may be affected are under federal jurisdiction.  

SEMARNAT or the project proponent may arrange public meetings. Any person can request a public meeting 

within 10 days of the publication of the MIA summary. Once SEMARNAT receives the request, it has five 

days to respond. The project proponent has another five days to publish a response to public concern. After 

that, the general public has 10 days to file a request for a copy of the entire MIA from SEMARNAT. Once the 

entire MIA is available to the public, anyone can propose, in writing, changes to the MIA, including changes 

to designs and mitigations.  

SEMARNAT then prepares a resolution indicating whether the project is environmentally viable. The final 

resolution must be published and include public consultations, proposed alternatives, agency and public 

comments, and proponent responses.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 118 

20.1.2 ETJ – Estudio Técnico Justificativo (Technical Justification Study) 

The ETJ is the technical document that includes the designs, actions, procedures, and monitoring for the 

protection, conservation, and restoration of forest ecosystems. The ETJ should include the conceptual 

description of the mine plan of operations. The ETJ must demonstrate compliance with the following basic 

provisions: 

• The project will not compromise biodiversity  

• The project will not cause soil erosion 

• The project will prevent deterioration of the water quality 

• The project will limit water use 

• The proposed change in land use will be more productive long-term than the existing land use 

Change of Land Use in Forested Areas  

Since a portion of the Project area is forested, Minera Alamos is required to submit to SEMARNAT, under 

the ETJ, an application for change in land use for forested areas disturbed by mining activities. Changes in 

the forest land use may only be granted when the provisions listed above are satisfied.  

20.2 Other Permits 

Following the completion of the ETJ-MIA process a number of other registrations and local/state permits are 

required in advance of various site development stages and the start of commercial production. These 

include: 

• "Water Use" – Comisión de Agua (National Water Commission or CONAGUA). Once a final tailings 

containment design is complete an application is required for a final water use permit based on the 

Project fresh water pumping requirements for the Project. CONAGUA has stated that the Humaya River 

can supply the water requirements, but the Company is required to apply for this service. Prior to this 

application, some groundwater well flow studies should be completed to evaluate the quantities of 

available groundwater flows. 

• "Explosives Use" – Covers projected explosives requirements and design of explosives storage facilities.  

• "Exploration Permits" – As required when surface disturbances are created for site drilling purposes.  

• "Construction Permits" – Obtained from the local municipality.  

20.3 Social Impacts 

Minera Alamos does not currently own any surface rights in the La Fortuna area. The surface rights over the 

area are held jointly by the residents of the Tabahueto ejido (a Mexican agricultural cooperative). In recent 

years, the Mexican Federal Government has changed the EIA permitting procedure such that the company 

applying for these permits must first demonstrate that they have a legal and binding agreement in place for 

the surface rights covering the area to be permitted. SEMARNAT will no longer accept the ETJ-MIA permit 

application documents unless proof of such rights is presented with the application. 

In 2016, Minera Alamos started discussions with the ejido regarding the necessary surface rights for the 

development of the La Fortuna Project. On 16 February 2017 at a general meeting, the community voted 

unanimously to enter into a 25-year agreement to rent 235 a of surface area required by the Company 

(agreement signed formally in June 2017).

21 Capital and Operating Costs 

21.1 Assumptions 

Capital and operating cost estimates were prepared assuming a greenfields installation of mining and 

processing facilities. Costs are considered to be accurate within a range of ±30%. Key assumptions utilized 

during the estimating process were as follows: 

1) Average daily milling capacity of approximately 1,000–1,100 t. 

2) Plant operating 24 hours a day and 365 days a year at approximately 95% mill availability. 

3) Mine plans are based on current resource models (Measured + Indicated only). No Inferred Resources 

have been considered for the analysis. 

4) Developed open pit mining sequences were prepared in accordance with parameters outlined in 

Section 16 (Mining Methods) of the Report (including reasonable parameters for mine recoveries and 

dilution). Mineralized material was aggregated into a series of grade "baskets" for production planning 

purposes using estimated gold grades only -->2 g/t, 1.6–2.0 g/t, 1.2–1.6 g/t, 0.8–1.2 g/t. Material with 

<0.8 g/t Au was considered as waste for PEA planning purposes. 

5) Mineralized material with >1.6 g/t Au was considered as "direct milling" material for economic 

modelling purposes. "Sub-grade" Material containing 0.8–1.6 g/t Au is sent for DEXTR ore sorting with 

the concentrate from sorting combined with the direct milling material for gold recovery operations. 

For planning purposes, the sub-grade material from the first two years of operations was stockpiled 

with ore sorting operations being implemented in Year 3.  

6) 90/90/85% overall recoveries for copper, gold and silver. 

7) Milling facilities were designed to maximize the use of equipment from a previously purchased used 

processing plant (grinding/flotation) with specific modifications as detailed in Section 17 to best suit 

the flowsheet developed for the La Fortune Project. 

8) Gold refining circuits are not included in the designs. Two products will be produced for sale – loaded 

carbon containing gold (50% of recoverable gold/minor silver value) for shipment to be processed at a 

third-party facility and a copper flotation concentrate containing significant amounts of gold/silver 

(50% of recoverable gold/100% of recoverable silver) to be sold directly. 

9) Flotation tailings are to be filtered and "dry stacked" at site. Testwork and designs have been 

completed using third party consultants/suppliers for both the tailings filtration equipment and the dry 

stack tailings impoundment area. 

10) All power for the site operations is to be produced through diesel generators located at site. 

11) A basic camp arrangement is to be constructed to house site personnel not sourced from local 

communities. 

21.2 Cost Estimate Methodology 

The general methodology utilized for the development of the PEA study operating and capital costs 

estimates was as follows: 

1) A Whittle™ ultimate pit shell was completed using initial estimated economic parameters for the 

project variable costs in order to define an initial mineable resource. The Whittle™ shell was then used 

as a rough guideline for the production of mine production schedules that also incorporated 

operational requirements such as roads, etc. Efforts were made at the PEA stage to consider waste 



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 120 

mining sequencing in order to better manage fleet utilization but further optimizations are 

recommended to improve the overall project economics. 

2) A complete metallurgical processing model was completed using Metsim® software, testwork data 

obtained primarily from SGS, Lakefield, Ontario, equipment vendors and experience from similar 

previous projects. 

3) All major process equipment items were sized and selected based on the mass flows output directly 

from the process model and vendor product catalogues and information. Wherever possible, existing 

equipment items from the Company's used plant facilities were selected for use in the plant 

arrangements. Items not available were identified for future sourcing as new/used items. 

4) A process plant arrangement and overall site layout were completed for the Project (see Figure 64). 

5) Overall process plant capital costs utilizing used equipment were estimated based on mill capital cost 

factors available from other similar facilities constructed in Mexico using significant quantities of used 

equipment.  

6) A conservative contingency was added to the overall project capital cost estimates to account for items 

that were not specifically identified at this stage of the study. 

7) Operations and administrative operating costs were developed based on estimated staffing levels, 

consumables (from testwork and modelling) and expenditures required to support the mine and its 

associated processing, maintenance and administrative activities. Power requirements were calculated 

based on estimated equipment motor sizes and assuming power generated via on-site diesel 

generation.  

8) Direct mining and crushing costs were excluded from the analysis outlined in Item 6 and will be 

performed by contractors on fixed unit rates. Contractor rates were developed from first principals 

with appropriate allowances for profit margins and benchmarked based on recent Minera Alamos 

management operating experience. The Company will provide overall supervision/planning for the 

miner operations and costs for this mine services group were detailed separately.  

9) Additional operating cost allowances were included for outside contractors, laboratory consumables, 

vehicle fuel requirements, etc. 

10) An overall contingency of 20% was applied to the operating cost totals to account for additional cost 

items such as outside contractors, laboratory consumables, vehicle fuel requirements, etc.  

11) Infrastructure costs were estimated based on a site layout as presented in Section 21.3.3, which was 

utilized for the submission of the appropriate mining permits. Infrastructure requirements include road 

upgrades, power generation, site preparations and facilities such as a laboratory and administration 

buildings.  

12) Excluded from owner's costs are corporate overheads, land acquisition costs (previously settled by 

Company) and working capital. Minera Alamos is in discussions with potential mine contracting groups 

and concentrate traders and initial indications are that the majority of working capital requirements 

can be funded via these groups. In addition, the Company will have other operations with positive cash 

flow that can be utilized as required to cover temporary La Fortuna Project start-up requirements.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 122 

21.3 Capital Costs 

The capital cost estimate was divided into "pre-production" capital and production "sustaining" capital.  

Pre-production capital includes all mine and process costs up to the initiation of commercial mining 

operations (75% of steady state production). Total pre-production costs at the La Fortuna Project are 

estimated at US$27 million. Sustaining capital costs over the LOM are estimated at US$7 million for a total 

Project capital cost of US$34 million. A breakdown of the Project capital costs is summarized in Table 38. 

To reduce the initial capital requirements, it was decided that all mining and crushing activities will be 

provided by third party contractors.  

Table 38: Project capital cost summary 

Area Initial (US$'000) Sustaining (US$'000) Total (US$'000) 

Mining (contractor mobilizations) 1,000  1,000 

Site development/infrastructure 3,500  3,500 

Mineral processing 15,000 7,100 22,100 

Tailings management 2,000  2,000 

Closure  3,000 3,000 

Salvage value  (3,000) (3,000) 

Contingencies (including owner's costs) 5,400  5,400 

Total Project 26,900 7,100 34,000 

*Note: Start-up working capital to be provided by concentrate purchasers on credit revolver basis.  

The pre-production capital cost estimate of US$27 million includes the construction of a stand-alone 

process facility, Phase 1 of the tailings storage facilities and all necessary site infrastructure to bring the 

mine into production. A conservative 25% contingency has been included to account for capital 

requirements that are not detailed in the current study. 

To reduce upfront capital requirements, Minera Alamos will utilize contractors for both mining and crushing 

activities. In addition, used processing equipment will be incorporated wherever reasonable based on the 

current widespread availability of such items. The Company has already purchased a used flotation facility 

(2,000 t/d capacity) that was loaded previously into sea containers for shipping and assembly at a base 

metals project that was subsequently cancelled. The equipment was inspected by a number of parties and 

appears to be in good condition (including electronics).  

21.3.1 Mine Pre-Stripping 

Mineralization at the La Fortuna Project extends close to topographic surfaces and therefore no pre-

stripping was included in the estimates. Annual mine plans as prepared include all ore/waste to be removed 

from the open pit during the normal course of operations. 

21.3.2 Process Plant 

A conceptual layout for the processing plant and crushing/stockpile arrangement is shown in Figure 64. In 

order to provide maximum flexibility for future expansions, the original design completed and submitted for 

permitting was for an expanded case that included future potential processing circuits as outlined in 

previous sections of the Report. Subsequently, additional testwork and engineering indicated that the 

preferred development route (lowest initial CAPEX) would be to limit the scale of the facilities at Project 

start-up.  



 
MINERA ALAMOS INC. 
MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 123 

This involved removing the following areas from the plant design: 

• Pyrite flotation (separate circuit from copper concentrate flotation) 

• Cyanidation of pyrite flotation concentrate 

• Thickening/filtration of cyanidation tailings 

• Cyanide destruction. 

Allowances were maintained in the site layout (shown in grey) for the later addition of these areas should 

they be economically justified. In addition, area was included (i.e. second flotation circuit) should a future 

decision be made to increase the plant throughput towards 2,000 t/d due to the definition of addition 

project resources. Although the overall site layout considered options for future expansion capacity, no 

allowances were made in the current report for the additional capital required for these modifications.  

A decision was made early on by the company to purchase a used processing facility (grinding/flotation) 

that was suitable for the scale of facilities being planned for the La Fortuna Project. In addition, the 

widespread current availability of used processing equipment makes it likely that much of the remaining 

mechanical equipment required for the Project can also be acquired in used condition. Minera Alamos is 

currently evaluating the availability of new/used remaining equipment items and detailing mechanical/civil/ 

electrical works such that material take-offs can be completed. 

For the purposes of the PEA, a capital cost estimate for the construction of La Fortuna processing facilities 

was derived from an evaluation of recent similar facilities constructed in Mexico using large quantities of 

used equipment. A summary of data collected for a number of such projects over the last 10 years was 

provided by Minera Alamos to CSA Global. Following CSA Global's review of the information a conservative 

final value of US$15 MM (<US$15,000 per t/d of plant throughput) was selected as reasonable based on the 

extent of previously purchased equipment and recent grinding/flotation plant experience in Mexico. The 

factor is exclusive of other site infrastructure including power generation, tailings and general site grading, 

roads and camp/office facilities. As a further benchmark, the value was compared to that utilized for one of 

the more recently published PEA reports for a similar used facility in Mexico (Santacruz Silver San Felipe 

Project/2014). 

Based on the available data, the selection of the cost factor utilized for the La Fortuna Project is in the 

conservative part of the construction cost ranges when the following considerations are included: 

• Minera Alamos has already purchased most of the mechanical equipment required for the processing 

facilities and these "sunk costs" are excluded from the following estimates. The scope of the purchased 

equipment is significant and includes electronics, major valving, pumps, etc. 

• No crushing facilities are to be constructed for the Project as this work will be completed by 

contractors. 

• Options exist to further reduce the scope of the facilities to be constructed at start-up following the 

completion of further engineering studies (i.e. the initial installation of only one of the two available 

grinding lines). 

• The current value of the Mexico Peso (~19 per US$) which is at the lower end of its valuation over the 

last decade.

21.3.3 Infrastructure 

Infrastructure estimates were developed based on a plant site location approximately 2 km of the mine site. 

A conceptual site layout is illustrated in Figure 65. Included on the layout are the area polygons utilized for 

environmental permitting purposes. 

An estimate of US$3.5 million is included to cover pre-production infrastructure activities. Included in this 

cost are the following: 

Roads 

A total allowance of US$900,000 for the construction/upgrading of gravel roads around the site. This 

includes: 

• 5 kilometres of new site roads suitable for the operation of mining trucks (US$80,000 per km) 

• General upgrades to existing roads into and around project area (conservative US$500,000 allowance) 

Power 

A total power requirement of approximately 2 MW was estimated for the main La Fortuna processing 

facilities. In order to provide maximum operational flexibility, three (two operating/one standby) diesel 

generator units each with 1.5–2.0 MW capacity are to be installed. Initial searches indicated that used units 

(trailer/skid mounted) are available at a cost of US$150,000 to US$200,000 each. Including installation and 

required transformers/switchgear, a total allowance of US$1 million has been estimated for process site 

power generation. 

Camp/Offices 

Camp facilities suitable for 30 personnel are currently estimated as suitable for the Project's non-local 

employees. No details have been completed but initial inquiries regarding the purchase of container-style 

(or trailer) rooms/facilities have been completed. The selected camp area already contains some existing 

concrete block buildings that can be renovated for use as office/kitchen facilities. Overall, based on the data 

available and previous project experience, a conservative estimated allowance of US$500,000 has been 

included. 

General Site Earthworks 

Preliminary site grading estimates were completed for the major project work areas and assuming the cut 

and fill volumes are to be balanced as much as possible. Including a contingency for currently unspecified 

requirements a conservative total volume of approximately 1.5 MM tonnes of material was estimated to be 

required to be moved. Further detailed studies (including some geotechnical work) will be required in order 

to better optimize these requirements.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 126 

21.3.4 Tailings Facilities 

Conceptual capital costs of US$2 million were estimated for the TCFs based on the following:  

• Samples of La Fortuna tailings material were provided to one of the third-party manufacturers of 

ceramic disk vacuum tailings filtration equipment for detailed testwork. Based on the testwork results 

and the design throughput for the La Fortuna processing facilities final equipment designs were 

provided. The manufacturer provided budgetary pricing of approximately US$500,000 for the recent 

supply and installation of a similar sized system in Mexico.  

• A detailed engineering study was completed by ECT (see Section 18.4) for the initial phase of tailings 

containment (>2MM tonnes) at the La Fortuna Project. Minera Alamos is currently evaluating the 

detailed specifications in the study document in order to prepare a full budget for the construction. 

Based on the data provided (disturbed area, initial starter dam volume, hydraulic control structures, 

etc) a conservative allowance of US$1.5 million was included in the report. It is worth noting that only a 

portion of the full TCF design is actually required to be completed prior to the initiation of commercial 

operations and that the final earthworks can be completed while the Project is operational. 

21.3.5 Mine Closure 

An allowance of US$3 million has been included for final closure costs related to the mine and processing 

plant. This estimate was based on experience with similar projects in Mexico and will need to be 

re-evaluated once a full site closure plan has been completed. US$3 million has been assigned as the final 

salvage value for the constructed mine facilities at the end of the mine life. 

21.3.6 Ongoing Sustaining Capital 

An allowance of US$1.5 million has been included for the purchase and installation of an ore sorting 

machine for use starting in Year 3 of operations. The estimate is based on budget pricing from the sorting 

manufacturer combined with costs associated with other recent installations.  

An annual allowance of 7.0% of the original project capital costs has been to account for ongoing sustaining 

capital requirements. The allowance was based on the use of significant quantities of used equipment. 

21.3.7 Exclusions 

No allowances have been made in the current capital cost estimates for the following: 

• Working capital (preliminary discussions with mine contractors and concentrate traders have indicated 

that majority of working capital requirements can be funded via these third parties at minimal interest 

costs) 

• Corporate costs (Minera Alamos will manage via existing operations group that will be in place for 

other operations) 

• Additional preconstruction civil works beyond basic requirements assuming soils suitable for the 

proposed construction activities. 

• Taxes (assumes IVA will be refunded to Minera Alamos quarterly as construction progresses, as the 

Company will be an operating producer at other projects) 

• Bonding 

• Inflation.

21.4 Operating Costs 

The total unit operating costs for the Project are estimated at US$33.34/t of mineralised material (includes 

general and administrative (G&A), concentrate shipping and treatment charges). It should be noted that the 

decision to utilize contractors for mining and crushing has added somewhat to this cost. Should the deposit 

resource grow in the future it may make sense to perform these activities in-house.  

The LOM operating costs are summarized in Table 39. Details of these costs are discussed later in this 

section. 

Table 39: Project operating cost summary 

Area US$/t mineralized material*2 US$/unit  

Open pit mining 11.80 2.15 per tonne mined 

Processing 15.95 22.89 per tonne milled 

Stockpile/Ore sorting*1 1.73 4.00 per tonne sorted 

G&A 3.86 5.54 per tonne milled 

All-in OPEX 33.34   

Notes: 

1. "Ore Sorting" as used in the context of Table 39 is a commercial term referring to sensor-based rock sorting technology and is not 
related to project resources/reserves. Ore sorting equipment is implemented in Year 3 for upgrading of mid-grade stockpiles. 

2. "Mineralized Material" represents mined material in excess of 0.8 g/t Au cut-off (includes direct milling material + stockpiled 
material to be upgraded via ore sorting prior to milling). 

Operating costs were developed based on estimated staffing levels, consumables (from testwork and 

modeling) and expenditures required to support the mine and its associated processing, maintenance and 

administrative activities.  

Power requirements were estimated based on operating equipment motor sizes and plant availability, and 

costs assuming diesel generation with a delivered diesel fuel cost of US$1/litre. It is anticipated at some 

point in the future that grid power will arrive close to the property allowing for a significant reduction in site 

power costs. However, it is currently not known when this situation will occur. 

An overall contingency of 20% was applied to the operating cost totals to account for additional cost items 

such as outside consultants, laboratory consumables, vehicle fuel requirements, etc.  

All mine operating activities are assumed to be the responsibility of a third party mine contractor. 

Contractor rates include drilling, blasting and transportation of the waste/ore. Costs for the Company mine 

services group were prepared separately and included separately.  

Crushing was assumed to be the responsibility of a third-party contractor using portable crushing 

equipment (two stage crushing circuit). Contractor rates include crushing, handling and transport of crushed 

rock to plant facilities.  

21.4.1 Mining and Crushing Costs 

All mine production activities are assumed to be the responsibility of a third party mine contractor. 

Contractor rates include drilling, blasting and transportation of the waste/ore. Current costs derived from 

first principals using the expected mine production rates and "typical" fleet parameters listed previously. 

Costs were then increased using a conservative factor to account for expected contractor profit margins. 

Ultimately, a conservative value of US$2.15/t was applied. This value is in excess of recent actual contract

MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE AND PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT – LA FORTUNA GOLD PROJECT 
 

 
 

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 128 

values at similar size projects operated by the Company management group and provides an allowance for 

the more remote nature of the site. The same cost was utilized for both ore and waste.  

Mineralized material from the open pit mining operations is planned to be stockpiled and crushed (two 

stages) prior to downstream processing. Direct milling ore is transported directly to the grinding facilities 

and mid-grade material is upgraded via ore sorting prior to grinding (stockpiled first two years before 

installation of sorting system in Year 3). All crushing/re-handling operations are to be performed using 

mobile equipment via a third-party contractor. An average cost of US$4/t has been included to account for 

these operations. 

It is expected that during actual contractor negotiations some savings may be achievable with respect to the 

unit costs assumed in this report. These discussions should include: 

• Reduced unit costs for waste material (shorter haulage and less blasting requirements) 

• Utilization of same contractor to manage all the mining and crushing/re-handling operations. 

21.4.2 Process Plant Cost 

A breakdown of the overall process plant operating costs is presented in Table 40 below.

Contingency (20%)  3.81  

Total  22.89 per tonne milled 

Notes: 
1. Unit rates calculated assuming an average annual mill throughput of 380,000 t (actual annual throughputs vary slightly). 
2. 15% shipping costs included. 
3. Estimated based on diesel prices of approximately US$1/litre. 

Labour 

Labour costs were developed by preparing a complete manpower schedule for the processing operations 

and then applying typical base salary and burdens for current operations in the Sonora area. The plant 

manpower schedule is summarized in Table 41. Total annual salary costs (including 33% burden) are 

estimated at US$1,060,000 to US$815,000 for Plant Operations and US$245,000 for Maintenance.

Annual maintenance supplies were estimated to be US$1,000,000 (5% of an approximate US$20,000,000 

baseline cost for the process plant construction), which appeared reasonable given the scope of the 

facilities and type of processing equipment being utilized. An additional annual allowance of US$500,000 

was included for miscellaneous fixed costs for supplies/rentals/etc.  

21.4.3 General and Administrative 

G&A costs were developed by preparing a proposed manpower schedule. The schedule covers G&A 

personnel for the operation as well as the in-house mine planning group responsible for oversight of the 

mine contractor operations. The manpower schedule is summarized in Table 45 and Table 46. An allowance 

of US$1,000,000 was included to cover other fixed costs at the project level including supplies, rentals, 

insurance, etc. along with a 20% overall contingency. Total annual costs are summarized in Table 44.

22 Economic Analysis 

22.1 Caution to the Reader 

The reader is cautioned that the PEA reported in this Report is preliminary in nature and uses Indicated and 

Measured Mineral Resources; Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated 

economic viability. Inferred Mineral Resources have not been utilized in the PEA. There is no certainty that 

the PEA will be realized. 

22.2 Model Assumptions 

CSA Global created a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to analyse the economic potential of the La Fortuna 

Project. This model calculates the project pre and post-tax Net Cash Flow (NCF), the Net Present Values 

(NPV) at various discount rates, the Internal Rate of Return (IRR).  

In addition, the model calculates the period required to repay the initial capital investment, the gold price 

required to achieve breakeven, the operating cost per ounce of gold sold, the all-in sustaining cost, the all-in 

cost and the NCFs at higher and lower metal prices and operating and capital costs.  

The underlying assumptions and parameters used are: 

• All units of measurement are metric unless otherwise stated. 

• All dollars are United States dollars unless otherwise stated. 

• No inflation is assumed (i.e. all dollars are real dollars). 

• All metal prices are based on the three-year trailing moving average after adjusting for inflation. 

Inflation is based on the US Consumer Price Index (Economic Research Division, Federal Reserve Bank 

of St. Louis – https://fred.stlouisfed.org). 

• The gold price (US$1,250/oz) is based on the average monthly Comex-CME gold price as reported on 

the website https://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=gold (see Figure 66).

• The silver price (US$16.00/oz) is based on the average monthly Silver (UK), London afternoon fixing as 

reported on the website https://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=silver (see 

Figure 67). 

 

Figure 67: Monthly and three-year moving average silver prices (US$/oz) 

• The copper price (US$5,725/t) is based on the average London Metal Exchange Settlement price for 

Grade A copper as reported on the website 

https://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodit=copper (see Figure 68 and Figure 69).

• The model allows for a one-year pre-production period. This should be sufficient time to complete the 

permitting process and modify and assemble the previously purchased used processing plant. 

• The model assumes a five-year mine life. During the first two years of production the mine processes 

higher-grade ore while stockpiling lower-grade ore. In the final three years, the mill processes direct 

high-grade ore plus material from the stockpiles that has been upgraded in the on-site sorting plant. 

The sorting plant recovers 85% of the metal with a mass recovery of 30%. 

• The processing plant produces two products: 

o A high-grade gravity gold concentrate (~5,000 g/t) with 45% of the gold in the plant feed reporting 

to the gold concentrate.  

o A copper concentrate with gold and silver credits. 90% of the copper in the plant feed is recovered 

in the copper concentrate. As well, 85% of the silver and 45% of the gold reports to the copper 

concentrate. The grade of the copper concentrate is 18% copper, and an average of 122.2 g of gold 

per tonne and 1,255 g of silver per tonne. The NSR and gravity calculations are based on industry 

standard values. Figure 70 shows the revenue distribution from the three metals with gold 

accounting for 88.4% of the net revenue.

• Operating cost estimates. 

o Mining costs are based on quotes received by Minera Alamos from local Mexican contractors and 

have been reviewed by the author and appear reasonable 

o Stockpile reclamation and ore sorting costs are US$1.00/t of stockpile processed 

o Processing costs were developed by the author 

o G&A costs were developed by Minera Alamos and appear reasonable in the author's opinion. 

• Capital costs are relatively low as Minera Alamos has already purchased a used processing plant. The 

mill however will have to be customized to process the La Fortuna ore and installed. There are no 

provisions for mining capital as all the mining will be performed by Mexican contractors. 

o Processing plant – US$15 million based on an estimate of US$15,000/t of daily capacity. The 

US$15,000 is derived from a survey of similar plants in Mexico and the Southern US. 

o Sorting plant – US$1.5 million. This is based on Minera Alamosa's best estimate and believed to be 

reasonable by the author. 

• A sustaining capital rate of 7% of initial capital for the production Year 2 to Year 4. 

• The economic model assumes 100% equity-based financing. 

• The model assumes that due to the short life of the mining operation, the sale of the processing plant 

will cover the costs of reclamation 

• Argonaut Royalty. The Project is required to pay a 2.5% NSR royalty to Argonaut to a maximum of 

US$4,500,000. 

• The model calculates book depreciation using the Units of Production (UOP) method. 

• Taxes and government royalties deducted by the CSA Global model include: 

o Special Mining Duty. 7.5% of earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization. The 

Special Mining Duty is deductible for corporate taxes (see below). 

o Extraordinary Mining Duty. 0.5% of gold and silver NSR. Also deductible before calculating Mexican 

Corporate Taxes. 

o Mexican Corporate Taxes. 30% of net income where net income is defined as cash operating profit 

less the above duties, any opening tax pools and depreciation. Tax depreciation is calculated using 

the straight-line method with a rate of either 12% or 72% (accelerated depreciation) for one year. 

The model uses the 72% rate. The model assumes opening tax pools of US$2.0 million. 

• Working capital requirements. Working capital represents the money required to fund the operations 

until the funds generated by the Project are received. The model calculates Working Capital as equal to 

Concentrate Inventory Plus Accounts Receivable Spare Parts and Supplies less Accounts Payable. 

Working capital is recaptured at the end of the mine life. The parameters used in calculating working 

capital are: 

o Gold gravity concentrate inventory – two weeks of concentrate NSR 

o Copper concentrate – three weeks of concentrate NSR 

o Accounts Receivable – four weeks of concentrate NSR 

o Spare parts and supplies – US$1,500,000 

o Accounts payable – two weeks of operating costs.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 136 

• The model assumes the Company will receive advance payments for the concentrate in the first two 

years of production to mitigate the impact of increases in working capital requirements on cash flow. 

Minera Alamos pays a fee of 2% of the concentrate value for these advance payments. 

• NCF is calculated as NSR less: 

o Argonaut royalty 

o Operating costs 

o Mining duties and taxes 

o Capital investment 

o Changes in working capital. 

22.3 Results 

On an after-tax basis, the Project returns an IRR of 92.7% and a payback period of 11 months from the start 

of mine production. In addition, the total NCF is US$96.1 million and the NPVs at various discount rates are:  

• 5%a – US$77.5 million 

• 7.5% – US$69.8 million 

• 10% – US$63.0 million 

• 15% – US$51.6 million. 

On a pre-tax basis, the Project returns an IRR of 121.6% and a payback period of nine months from the start 

of mine production. In addition, the total NCF is US$140.5 million and the NPVs at various discount rates 

are:  

• 5% – US$114.5 million 

• 7.5% – US$103.8 million 

• 10% – US$94.2 million 

• 15% – US$78.3 million.

Note: CSA/Global has used the World Gold Council definitions of Operating Costs, All-In-Sustaining Costs 

and All-In Costs. In the current project, Operating Costs include all operating costs less by-product credits. 

All-In-Sustaining Costs include operating costs plus sustaining capital less by-product credits. Finally, All-In 

Costs include operating costs, initial capital, sustaining capital less by-product credits. The Breakeven Gold 

Price is the gold price that just returns the capital investment, i.e. a zero IRR. The Breakeven Gold Price is 

higher than the All-in cost as it allows for corporate income taxes. 

22.4 Risk Analysis 

CSA Global has analyzed the sensitivity of the La Fortuna Project NCF and NPV discounted at 7.5% to 

changes in metal prices and capital and operating costs. Prices and costs were varied from -30% to +30%. 

Figure 71 and Figure 72 show the results. As would be expected, the Project is most sensitive to metal 

prices, followed by operating costs and finally capital costs. Basically, the La Fortuna Project is extremely 

robust. Even a 30% reduction in metal prices produces a positive NCF of US$38.3 million and an NPV 

discounted at 7.5% of US$25.1 million.  

In addition, the model calculates the lowest gold price that would return a zero IRR (i.e. the gold price at 

which the Project returns invested capital but no profit. That gold price is US$623/oz.

25 Interpretation and Conclusions 

The Qualified Persons have reviewed the La Fortuna Project data provided by Minera Alamos (including the 

drill database), reviewed historical sampling procedures and security, and visited the site. The Qualified 

Persons believe the data presented by Minera Alamos to be an accurate and reasonable representation of 

the Project mineralization. 

The PEA is based on a Mineral Resource estimate prepared for the La Fortuna Project by Scott Zelligan, 

P.Geo.; Section 14 of this Report. The Mineral Resource estimate is based on the results from 125 core 

drillholes completed by previous operators prior to the Company's acquisition of the Project in 2016. 

The 2018 Mineral Resource estimate for the La Fortuna Project includes Measured and Indicated Mineral 

Resources of 3,469,711 tonnes at 2.78 g/t Au, 16.51 g/t Ag and 0.22% Cu for 309,800 contained oz Au, 

1,842,200 contained oz Ag and 7,600 contained tonnes Cu. The estimate also includes Inferred Mineral 

Resources of 156,322 tonnes at 1.72 g/t Au, 8.51 g/t Ag and 0.09% Cu for 8,600 contained oz Au, 42,700 

contained oz Ag and 100 contained tonnes Cu. 

Based on results of metallurgical and rock-sorting studies, estimated operating costs and gold recovery, an 

average gold price of US$1,250/oz, silver price of US$16/oz and copper price of $5,725/t, a cut-off of 1.0 g/t 

was chosen and is considered reasonable and consistent for this type of deposit with open pit mining 

methods. 

The Fortuna Mineral Resources were estimated using the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and 

Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and 

adopted by CIM Council on 10 May 2014. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have 

demonstrated economic viability. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this 

estimation are uncertain in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Mineral 

Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result 

in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource category. 

The gold, silver and copper metals either leach at high recovery and/or report to a saleable flotation 

concentrate by conventional extraction pathways: 

• 2016 testwork confirmed +80% recovery of gold to a gravity circuit 

• 95% of remaining gold was recovered to a flotation step together with +90% of the contained copper 

and silver at a copper grade of approximately 20% Cu and silver grade of 2,000–3,000 g/t for a mass-

pull of less than 10% 

• A conventional milling and flotation circuit has already been purchased and is slightly oversized and 

thus adequate for the Project. 

• The potential for beneficiation of low grade (below cut-off) material by Duel X-ray (XRT) ore sorting has 

been demonstrated subject to confirmatory testwork current planned/underway. 

From a processing perspective, the Project presents as robust and the selected plant and equipment and 

process treatment pathway should comfortably treat this ore at 1,100–1,200 t/d and at acceptable recovery 

of gold, silver and copper.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 143 

A surface mine was designed for the PEA that would incorporate conventional surface mining methods and 

a production schedule was created. Production highlights are: 

• Five-year mine life based on initial resource "starter pit" with 2.0 Mt of mineralization (3.68 g/t Au, 

20 g/t Ag, 0.27% Cu) processed at 1,100 t/d average processing rate 

• Average annual contained-metal production of approximately 50,000 oz gold equivalent (43,000 oz Au, 

220,000 oz Ag, 1,000 t Cu) 

• 215 koz of gold, 1.1 Moz of silver, and 5 kt of copper produced in concentrates. 

CSA Global's economic modelling and analysis of the Project reveals potential for: 

• Robust economics using metals prices of US$1,250/oz Au, US$16/oz Ag, and US$5,725/t Cu: 

o All-in sustaining cost (AISC) of US$440/oz [net of by-product credits] 

o After-tax NPV at 7.5% of US$69.8 million and IRR of 93% 

o Pre-tax NPV at 7.5% of US$103.8 million and IRR of 122%.  

• Low CAPEX and rapid payback: 

o Pre-production CAPEX of US$26.9 million 

o Payback period of 11 months 

o 2,000 t/d mill already purchased awaiting shipment to site reduces upfront capital. 

In the Qualified Persons and CSA Global's opinion, the La Fortuna Project is a potentially very robust one 

and warrants the Company's continued advancement of the Project towards further feasibility studies. 

25.1 Project Risks 

Project risks which potentially could affect Project economics include: 

• The Mineral Resource estimate is based on the results from 125 core drillholes completed by previous 

operators prior to the Company's acquisition of the Project in 2016. CSA Global recommends additional 

drill testing to confirm the historical results. 

• Environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, and political or other 

relevant issues have the potential materially affect access, title or the right or ability to perform the 

work recommended in this report on the Project. However, at the time of this report, CSA Global is 

unaware of any such potential issues affecting the Project. 

• The Project is most sensitive to metal prices, followed by operating costs and finally capital costs. 

However, even a 30% reduction in metal prices produces a positive NCF.  

25.2 Project Opportunities 

Project opportunities which potentially could enhance Project economics include:  

• Footprint of the current known deposit is very small compared to the overall land position. Exploration 

potential exists over the 6,100 ha land package. A number of other areas of historical mining activities 

have been identified but most of the area has never been explored using modern exploration methods. 

• Inferred Resources are not utilized in the current PEA mining plans. Step-out drilling may be able to 

define additional extensions of the current resources. 

• Additional metallurgical testwork to optimize the gold extraction process and further improve overall 

metal recoveries.

CSA Global Report Nº: R406.2018 144 

• Reduction of initial start-up CAPEX with a staged plant construction plan (possibly involving earlier use 

of ore sorting) followed by expansion of the facilities once production is underway. 

• Additional mine planning optimization studies to evaluate opportunities to delay portions of early 

waste removal until later in the mine life. 

• Further optimization studies are underway to determine if a more aggressive use of ore sorting may 

offer additional economic benefits for the Project (i.e. plant CAPEX reductions, increased mineable gold 

ounces, etc.). 

• Trade-off studies aimed at optimizing cut-off grades (with and without ore sorting) and the 

incorporation of additional milling capacity – the PEA based on a starting rate of 1,100 t/d but the 

Project is permitted for a 2,000 t/d operation.

26 Recommendations 

To proceed with the assessment of the potential development of the Project, the Qualified Persons 

recommend Minera Alamos continue to assess Project opportunities which potentially could enhance 

project economics including: 

• Expand exploration over the 6,100 ha land package. Work should initially investigate other areas of 

known historical mining activities using modern exploration methods. 

• Step-out drilling at La Fortuna for the purpose of expanding the current Inferred Resources not utilized 

in the PEA reported herein.  

• Infill drilling at La Fortuna for the purpose of upgrading Indicated to Measured and Inferred to 

Indicated Resources; metallurgical sampling and QAQC confirmation of historical drilling. 

• Additional metallurgical testwork to optimize the gold extraction process and further improve overall 

metal recoveries.  

• Metallurgical variability sampling of underground sampling and diamond drill core. 

• Further engineering studies should consider the following: 

o A staged plant construction plan (possibly involving earlier use of ore sorting) to further reduce the 

initial start-up CAPEX and then expand the facilities once production is underway 

o Additional mine planning optimization studies to evaluate opportunities to delay portions of early 

waste removal until later in the mine life  

o Further optimization studies (currently underway) to determine if a more aggressive use of ore 

sorting may offer additional economic benefits for the project (i.e. plant CAPEX reductions, 

increased mineable gold ounces, etc.) 

o Trade-off studies aimed at optimizing cut-off grades (with and without ore sorting) and the 

incorporation of additional milling capacity up to 2,000 t/d. 

Minera Alamos has proposed a 2018/2019 program estimated to be in the order of US$1 million (Table 48). 

CSA Global concurs with the proposed program and budget.
