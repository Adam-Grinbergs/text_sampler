1 Summary 
 
This report was commissioned by BHK Resources Inc., ("BHK" or the Company), with 
offices at 530 – 510 Burrard Street Vancouver, BC, V6C 3A8 and was prepared by 
Derrick Strickland P. Geo.  As an independent geologist, the author was asked to 
undertake a review of the available data and recommend (if warranted) specific areas for 
further work on the Ndjolé Property.  The technical report was prepared to support the 
Company's primary property on the TSX Venture Exchange as part of a qualifying 
transaction which will result in the acquisition of the Ndjolé Property by the Company.   
 
The Ndjolé Property consists of one exploration license with a surface area of 2,000 km2 
which is 100% owned by Dome Ventures SARL Gabon ("Dome Gabon"), a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Dome International Global Inc., a BVI company.  Pursuant to a letter 
agreement dated December 13, 2013, BHK can acquire all of the issued and 
outstanding shares of Dome International Global Inc., which in turn holds a 100% 
interest in Dome Ventures SARL Gabon for a payment of US$1.5 million to Dome 
Ventures Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Silver Bull Resources Inc. 
 
The Ndjolé Property (the "Property") is situated in the Moyen Ogooue province located in 
the western half of central Gabon. The Property is centred at latitude 0°14'14"S 
longitude 10°44'35"E.  The equator delineates the northern limit of the license.  The 
project area is located four hours on tarmac roads from the capital city Libreville.   
 
The bedrock at Ndjolé comprises folded, steeply to sub-vertically dipping, terrestrial and 
marine interbedded reduced black shale units, greywacke, sandstone, quartzite, mud- 
and siltstones and thin carbonate units.  Basic to intermediate intrusive rocks are found 
in outcrop and float at the southern end of the license.  The rocks have been 
metamorphosed to lower greenschist facies. 
 
The manganese mineralization seen in the Ndjolé area appears to have been enriched 
via supergene processes.  The main manganese oxide ore seen in the core is 
"pyrolusite".  Typically this type of enrichment occurs as small discreet pods and a mine 
targeting this kind of mineralization generally consists of a number of shallow open pits 
where deeply weathered manganese bearing lithologies are exposed and preserved.  
 
The Ndjolé Property has seen extensive soil and stream sampling, various geophysical 
programs, some detailed mapping and minimal drilling.  As a result, several areas of 
anomalous manganese and gold values have been identified. 
 
The manganese soil anomalies in the southern part of the property are combined to 
cover an approximately 50 km2 footprint.  This footprint is open to the south, west, and 
partially to the east.  
 
In 2010-2011 drilling work focused on gold exploration on the property with limited 
results.  As a result of this drilling, several underreported manganese intercepts were 
encountered.  Drill holes: NDDD-001, -8, -12, -16, -18, -27 and -28 all had over limits 
values for manganese (>11%) and were not re-assayed to determine the actual values.  
The only drill hole which determined the actual for manganese content is DDD0002 
where 35 m of 22% including 4.5 m of 45% was intersected.

The Bembélé Manganese Mine is located directly north of the Ndjolé Property.  In fact, a 
current part of the Ndjolé Property, where Dome Ventures SARL Gabon does not have 
the right to explore for manganese, is part of the Bembélé Manganese Mine exploration 
license area. 
Cautionary statement: Investors are cautioned that the potential quantity indicated above 
should not be relied upon.  The author has been unable to verify the information and is not 
necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Property that is the subject of the 
technical report. It has been provided only for illustration purposes.  At this time, there is 
insufficient public information to verify the information.   
 
An exploration program is recommended to (1) test the manganese anomaly (known as 
East 1) by using a auger rig; (2) re-assay the existing core for over limits of manganese; 
(3) excavate a series of pits in the East 1 area; (4) map the area to characterize the 
supergene manganese layer more accurately; (5) obtain larger samples for mineralogy 
and metallurgy, and (6) complete auger drilling of East 2 and West 3 manganese 
anomalies plus compiling the existing data into one GIS database.  The cost for such a 
program is expected to be US $553,674.00. 
 

2 Introduction  
 
This report was commissioned by BHK Resources Inc. ("BHK" or the Company), with 
offices at 530 -510 Burrard Street Vancouver, BC, V6C 3A8.  The report was prepared 
by Derrick Strickland, P. Geo.  As an independent geologist, the author was asked to 
undertake a review of the available data and recommend, if warranted, specific areas for

 The information relied upon pertains to the status and location of the Exploration 
Permits. (Bozec 2014)  
 
As of the date of this report, the author is not aware of any material fact or material 
change with respect to the subject matter of this technical report that is not presented 
herein, or which the omission to disclose could make this report misleading.  
 

4 Property Description and Location 
 
The Ndjolé Property is situated in the Moyen Ogooue province, located in the western 
half of central Gabon.  The property is centred at latitude 0°14'14"S longitude 
10°44'35"E.  The equator delineates the northern limit of the license.  The project is 
located four hours on tarmac roads from the capital city Libreville.  The project's field 
office is based in the town of Ndjolé.  Ndjolé is the headquarters of the district 
administration and provides all basic necessities to run field operations.  A very basic 
medical facility operates in Ndjolé; however serious cases must be evacuated to 
Lambarene (two hour car drive) or Libreville. 
 
Helicopter flights between the international airport in Libreville and Ndjolé are possible.  
Besides the mostly disaffected airstrip of Ndjolé, there are only a very few suitable 
helicopter landing sites existing on the license area due to heavy vegetation cover. 
 
The trans-Gabonese railway line that connects the coast to the south western hinterland 
of Gabon with its manganese deposits around Franceville passes through Ndjolé. 
 
The manganese prospects are located south of Ndjolé and the absence of any bridges 
necessitates the crossing of vehicles and personnel by company barge or boat.  
Numerous gravel logging roads are present over the whole project area and permit 
motorised access to all of the current major prospects.  The southern part of the license is 
more difficult to reach by vehicle due to several degraded bridges.  The logging roads 
deteriorate quickly under the tropical climate of Gabon and need constant maintenance.  
Due to only minimal logging activities occurring in the recent years, many roads are now 
impassable for motorised vehicles but could be easily reopened.  Rotten bridges are the 
the biggest obstacle. 
 
Only three airports with paved runways support regular flights to and from Gabon 
(Libreville, Port Gentil and Franceville), and of these only Libreville and Port Gentil support 
international flights.    
 
 
The country has one of the highest GDP per capita in Africa, with a free market economy 
dominated by oil, minerals and timber.  The private sector is pre-eminent and the country 
maintains laws favourable to foreign investment.  
 
The property is subject to Gabonese law as promulgated in the Mineral Code (Act No 
5/2000 of 2000).  The salient points of this Act are:  

• Ownership of all minerals is vested in the State;  
• Mineral title in the form of Licences is granted by the Minister of Mines which 

allows the licence holder access to their mineral title  
• The three types of mineral title relevant to this project are:  



Ndjolé Property   NI43-101 
March 2014    

 
8 

(1) Prospecting Permits 
Prospecting Permits are issued for two year.  A Prospecting Permit may have a 
maximum area agreed by negotiation with the Minister of Mines.  The Permit confers 
rights to undertake regional reconnaissance work (surface sampling only).  

 
(2) Exploration Permits 
Exploration Permits are issued for three years and are renewable for two further 
periods of three years each.  The maximum area is negotiable.  Area reduction on 
renewal is at the discretion of the titleholder.  A standard Mining Agreement is 
completed between the State of Gabon and the mineral title holder.  

 
(3) Mining Concessions 
Mining Concessions confer rights to mine large scale deposits and may be granted 
to Gabonese companies for periods up to 25 years, renewable for further periods of 
10 years at a time, until resource depletion is complete.  The maximum concession 
area will depend on the deposit size.  The Mining Agreement signed on issue of the 
Exploration Permit will be updated to reflect the agreed mining plan.  

 
Dome Gabon has an exploration permit  (G3-274) to explore the entire 2000 km2 Ndjolé 
licence for Au, Fe, Pb, Cu, Zn and Ag in the area outlined in black in (Figure 2: ).  For the 
1,496 km2 area outlined in r ed (also Figure 2) Dome Gabon has the right to explore for 
the same elements in the area highlighted in black, and manganese (Mn) is also 
included.  (Table 1) are the coordinate points provided by the Gabon Ministry of Industry 
and Mines for the 2012 Ndjolé licence renewal.  
 
Dome Gabon was originally granted a prospecting permit that was 10,910 km2 on 
September 14, 2006 that was valid for 2 years.  On July 14, 2008 the prospecting permit 
was reduced and converted to the existing 2,000 km2 Exploration Permit.  When the 
Exploration Permit was renewed on June 21, 2012 the Minister de L'Industrie et Des 
Mines reduced the area that could be explored for manganese.  According to the 
Minister de L'Industrie et Des Mines the area being excluded for manganese belongs to 
the adjacent Bembélé Manganese Mine and could not be granted to Dome Gabon.  
 
Dome Gabon must pay an annual fee of  $2000 USD  the Gabonese government to 
keep the current mineral exploration licence valid.  In addition there are  required to the 
following: 
 
 Before December 1 of each Calendar Year, the Company is required to submit 

to the Directorate General of Mines an Approved Work and Expenditures 
Program of the following and the corresponding budget year.     

 
Periodically, and at least twice in the Calendar Year, the Company shall 
submit to the Directorate General of Mines and Geology, during a technical 
meeting, a detailed work and related expenditure report.      

 
No later than the end of the month of March, the Company is required to 
present the results of work carried out during the previous year.     

 
No further permits are required to undertake the exploration recommend in this report.  
 
The Author  is  not aware of any other material factors that might affect access, title or 
the ability to perform work on the property

2012 Ndjolé Property Renewal Paper Work 
 
During the due diligence process the author discovered that 2012 Ndjolé Property 
renewal government documentation contained two clerical errors with respect to the 
concession GPS points.  
 

• The table in Article 3 of the renewal appears to have transposed the Longitude 
and Latitude headings. The coordinates should have been be labeled in the 
opposite manner. Based on the coordinates set forth in the table in Article 3, the 
property would have been located in Ghana. 

 
On January 31, 2014, the author informed BHK, Silver Bull, and BHK legal counsel of 
the clerical errors in the 2012 Ndjolé Property renewal government documentation.   
 
On February 21, 2014,  the Minister de L'Industrie et Des Mines of Gabon issued a letter 
to Dome Gabon acknowledging the clerical error of the longitude coordinates being 
registered as latitude coordinates, and vice versa, on the Ndjolé Property renewal 
documentation.   The Minister states within its letter of February 21, 2014, that the error 
did not affect the validity of the license. Further, the Minister de L'Industrie et Des Mines 
of Gabon stated it was working to remedy the clerical errors through the issuance of a 
ministerial order and decree for the license and that it will inform the company when the 
new or amended documentation has been completed in accordance with Gabonese law.    
Mr. Bozec acknowledges receipt of the Minister's letter dated February 21, 2014, and in 
providing the opinion above makes the assumption that the new Ministerial Order and 
Decree will be issued and notified as stated in such letter. 
 
The  author has relied Jean-Pierre Bozec legal opinion with respect to the ownership 
and validity of the license forming Ndjolé Property.

On May 15, 2014, the Minister de L'Industrie et Des Mines of Gabon issued Arrete -0048 
a ministerial order and decree for the G3-247 license with the clerical error corrected 
(Table 1).  
 
A legal opinion on the Ndjolé Property prepared by Jean-Pierre Bozec a registered legal 
adviser (Gabon) and a partner at Project Lawyers Law Firm located in Libreville, Gabon 
and it states  (Bozec, 2014) 
 
"Dome Gabon is duly incorporated in Gabon and is the sole and exclusive owner of the 
Licence according to the Decree n°0727/PR/MIM/ SG/DGMG/DEPM/SAEJF, dated 26 
December 2012, on first renewal of the permit "Substances Ndjole" G3-274" (Bozec

4.1 Environmental Liabilities 
 
Dome Gabon has not reported any environmental liabilities on the Property.  During the 
site visit on January 16th to January 18th 2014, the author did not observe any obvious 
existing environmental liabilities related to the previous Ndjolé property exploration 
projects.   
 

4.2 Legal Agreements 
 
On December 13, 2013 BHK signed a binding letter of intent with Silver Bull.  
 
Pursuant to the letter of intent BHK may acquire all the outstanding shares of Dome 
International Global Inc. ("Dome BVI"), a private British Virgin Islands company, from  
Dome Ventures Corp., a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary of Silver Bull. Dome 
Ventures Corp. is the owner of all the issued and outstanding securities (50,000 shares) 
of Dome BVI. Dome BVI. holds all of the issued and outstanding securities (100 shares) 
of Dome Gabon, which in turn holds a 100% interest in and to the Ndjolé manganese 
and gold mining license. 
 
As consideration for the Dome BVI securities, BHK will pay to Silver Bull US$1.5-
millionin cash, of which US$25,000 was paid as a non-refundable deposit upon the 
execution of the letter of intent.  Upon the completion of the transaction, Dome BVI will 
become a wholly owned subsidiary of BHK. 
 
Dome Gabon currently owns, a quad-ATV and trailer, a Mitsubishi Pajero SUV, small 
motorboat, computers and a Barge for crossing the Ogooue River.  Dome Gabon has 
four employees with a head office in Libreville and a field exploration office in town of 
Ndjolé.  The field office/bunk house is where all exploration for the property is 
conducted.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography  

 
Ndjolé Property (the "Property) lies close to the boundary between the erosional hinterland 
and the coastal, deltaic depositional terrain.  The Property is also near the Ogooue River, 
which reaches considerable size near the town of Ndjolé, and drains approximately three 
quarters of Gabon.  The terrain is subdued but hilly and incised by numerous small to 
medium-sized, perennial rivers with small catchment areas.  The Ogooue River and town of 
Ndjolé are at about 40 m above sea level with the highest points reaching just below 300 m 
above sea level in the main working area with peaks between 650 m to 700 m above sea 
level along the northern and eastern license boundary.  Resistive quartzite units form the 
highest peaks that often have steep to near-vertical flanks with flat tops. 
 
The Ndjolé Property is situated in the Moyen Ogooue province, located in the western half 
of central Gabon.  The property is centred at latitude 0°14'14"S longitude 10°44'35"E.  The 
equator delineates the northern limit of the license.  The project is located four hours on 
tarmac roads from the capital city Libreville.  The project's field office is based in the town of 
Ndjolé which is in the northern part of the property. 
 
The streams are of moderate to high energy in the upper reaches exposing the bedrock 
along narrow beds.  The streams become lower in energy and meandering in the lower 
reaches towards the Ogooue River. 
 
Surface cover sequences blanket the bedrock and limit outcrops to riverbeds and a few 
resistive units. 
 
The climate on the Ndjolé property is a wet, tropical climate with distinct dry seasons.  The 
average monthly temperature of 25-30°C is fairly constant throughout the year with highest 
temperatures occurring during the rain seasons.  Average annual rainfall is around 3,000 
mm.  Two dry seasons with almost no rainfall but high humidity (December-January and 
May-September) and two wet seasons with heavy thunderstorms followed by strong 
sunshine (February-April and October-November) typically occur in Ndjolé over the year.  
The best working conditions are during the long dry season from May to September, but 
field activities can be carried out all year round without too much hindrance. 
 
Except for a few man-made clearances, the area is uniformly covered by equatorial 
rainforest with a rich fauna.  The population density on the license area is very low with 
most people living in Ndjolé or along the national highway. 
 
Ndjolé town is a stage post on the national highway between the capital of Libreville and 
Cameroon and the western part of the country.  Main economic activities include logging, 
artisanal mining (known as orpaillage), and small trade.  Agriculture is virtually absent; 
hunting is common to subsidy the diet with fresh meat.  The Ogooue River is navigable until 
Ndjolé.  Hydrocarbons are shipped by barge from Port Gentil to Ndjolé where it is 
distributed further by tanker trucks.  A Chinese-operated manganese mine recently started 
production about 40 km north of Ndjolé. 
 
Artisanal mining is an important pillar of the local economy.  The exact number of miners is 
unknown, but does not exceed a few hundred individuals.  The local miners or "orpailleurs" 
operate from the town of Ndjolé or from small, semi-permanent camp sites.  Environmental 
impact from artisanal mining is minimal, as extraction is not mechanised and no chemicals

are used to recover the gold.  Relations with the miners are peaceful and they will likely 
provide an important part of the work force needed during drilling operations. 
 
The majority of field assistants and many support staff could be recruited and trained from 
town of Ndjolé. 
 

6 History  

The Ndjolé area has long been known for its alluvial gold.  However no effort was made in 
the early history of artisanal mining to investigate the primary source of gold.  Since the 
1970s, the Ndjolé area has seen several campaigns targeting-in on prospects with 
progressively high-resolution geochemical exploration methods and diamond drilling.   
 
Except for a small drilling campaign in the mid-1990s, there had been no drilling on the 
project area until 2010.  The exploration work in the history section is on the property in 
question unless otherwise stated. 
 

6.1 Early Work and Artisanal Mining 
Mining is restricted to alluvial workings exploited by small companies in the past and 
artisanal miners up to this date.  Earliest mining is reported to have started at the turn of the 
previous century reaching a peak during the period of French colonisation.  Production of 
gold between 1938 and 1956 is estimated at 4-5 tonnes from rich alluvial deposits with a 
gold grade of about 3 g/m3.  Daily production today amounts at best to a few grams of gold 
per site. 
 
Cautionary statement: Investors are cautioned that the potential quantity indicated above  
should not be relied upon.  The author has been unable to verify the information and is not 
necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Property that is the subject of the technical 
report. It has been provided only for illustration purposes.  At this time, there is insufficient 
public information to verify the information.     
Most alluvial mining has been located to the south of the Ogooue River.  Traces of alluvial 
gold are reported to frequently occur north of the Ogooue, but without any significant 
deposits worthy of being exploited (Figure 3). 
 
No hard rock mining is known from Ndjolé.  A short adit has been found at La Mboumi East; 
its purpose and origin are unclear, as it is not mineralised. 

6.2 Bureau de Recherchés Géologiques et Minières (1973-
1984) 

Systematic exploration started in the 1970s under the direction of the Bureau de 
Recherchés Géologiques et Minières ("BRGM" – the French geological survey).  The first 
work was part of the Ndjolé-Kolissen mission carried out in 1973 between Ndjolé and east 
of Lambarene on the Paleoproterozoic Kolissen Group hosting important alluvial and 
limited hard rock gold mining (also known as "Koumba") (see Dadet, 1974).  Work carried 
out appears to be limited to the compilation of historical data and inventory of artisanal 
mining sites.  No or only very limited fieldwork was undertaken. 
 
A large, national exploration campaign by the BRGM started in 1979 known as the Projet 
voie ferrée along the newly opened trans-Gabonese railway line linking Franceville to 



Ndjolé Property   NI43-101

Libreville (Barthélémy, 1985).  A one hundred kilometres wide buffer each side of the 
railway line was systematically explored for new mineral resources.  The approach 
consisted of a 'strategic' phase of regional alluvial and stream sediment sampling with a 
sample density of 0-3 samples per km2, and several 'tactical' phases of infill sampling to 6-
10 samples per km2, and finally soil and auger sampling on prospect scale. 
 
The area comprising Ndjolé Property has been sampled by a pan concentrate sampling 
campaign under the BRGM programs in 1984 (Figure 4).  The locations of the individual 
samples are not available, but cited to be approximately 1 sample per 3 km2.  Assay results 
or gold point counts are only available as aggregate anomalous outlines without actual 
assay or count values.  Four gold and pyrite anomalies have been delineated within the 
property of which three (LMB 5, LMB 6, and LMB 7) lie within the property (Figure 4).  The 
gold anomaly to the north appears to have not been followed up by any party.  The 
highlighted base metal (Cr, Co, Ni) anomalies clearly follow the stratigraphy folded around 
the northern and eastern license boundary.  Possibly the anomalies are due to manganese 
preferentially absorbing Co and Ni and/or resistate mineral deposits in the sediments.  
 

6.3 United Nations and Gabonese Government (1987-1993) 
The BRGM work was continued in 1987 under the guidance of the United Nations 
Development Programme ("UNDP") (Bonnot and Greenish, 1987).  The initial work plan 
was to refine the sampling over the gold anomalies highlighted by the BRGM south of 
Ndjolé.  The northernmost anomaly was finally covered, located between La Mboumi 
Central and La Mboumi East (270 km2 sampled out of 503 km2 planned).  Artisanal mining 
sites were recorded and mapped at the same time. 
 
A pan concentrate and a stream sediment sample were taken at the same location with a 
density of at least 3 samples per km2.  A total of 617 concentrate samples have been taken 
on the property  and analysed of which 80% reported positive gold results with 10% of 
samples assaying above 500 ppb Au with a maximum tenor of 3,247 ppb.  The stream 
sediment samples gave very similar results with maximum tenors around 5,000 ppb Au.  A 
large, 20 km long anomaly was highlighted over La Mboumi East (Figure 3).  The positive 
samples are fairly scattered with several denser anomalies within.  However the stream 
anomalies define a larger anomalous area than later soil sampling results.  A second, 
tighter gold anomaly is located at the northern end of the La Mboumi Central prospect. 
 
The La Mboumi Central anomaly was followed-up by a small soil sampling grid 
delineating a 2 km by 1.3 km gold in soil anomaly (Figure 3).  In 1993, the Gabonese 
geological survey ("DGMG" is the Direction de la Géologie et de la Recherché Minière) 
drilled 7 diamond drill holes to test the UNDP gold in soil anomaly at La Mboumi Central 
(Figure 11).  The holes were drilled to the north or south at an angle of 45-50 degrees.  
The core was sampled at 1 m to 1.5 m intervals.  Assay results for Au, Cu, Co, Ni, Cr, 
Pb, and Zn are available, although it is unknown if other elements were assayed for and 
what analytical methods were used.  The core has not been preserved and could 
therefore not be inspected.  The best intercept reported 10.5 m at 3.5 g/t Au with narrow 
intercepts in most of the holes.  Controls on mineralisation are unclear as the logs are 
not very detailed.  Mineralisation is not bound to a specific lithology but could be broadly 
coincident with logged quartz veining and brecciation.  The mineralised intercepts are 
often wider than indicated veining.  The top 20 m to 30m show slightly elevated gold 
values up to 150 ppb, with occasional higher values up to over 1,000 ppb.  The most 
significant results are summarised in Table 2.

6.4 Randgold Limited (1993-1997) 
Between 1993 and 1997, Randgold Exploration Ltd. ("Randgold") conducted an exploration 
program including stream sediment and soil sampling, shallow augering, and an airborne 
VTEM survey within the UNDP area of interest.  Randgold's efforts did not yield any 
significant new results. 
 
Randgold conducted stream sediment sampling over two areas with a combined surface of 
54 km2 at the northern end of La Mboumi East just south of the Ogooue River and east of 
La Mboumi Central extending south (Figure 3).  The sample density is 7-8 samples per 
km2.  An open 5 km by 4 km, 100 ppb+ Au in stream anomaly was highlighted south of the 
Ogooue River (Figure 3).  Almost all samples assay at more than 100 ppb Au.  It is not 
known if there is currently artisanal activity in the zone, but workings are indicated on the 
UNDP map.  Only small, isolated (<1 km, some open) Au in stream anomalies could be 
highlighted on the southern grid.  Anomalous samples seem to lie below outcrops of 
quartzites and along the inferred Eastern Shear.  The anomalies coincide mostly with later 
Dome soil sampling. 
 
A very small, 18km2 airborne VTEM and magnetic survey was flown at La Mboumi East.  It 
should be noted that the stream sediment, soil, auger and geophysical surveys do not all 
overlap (Figure 4).

6.5 Dome Gabon (2006-2008) 
Early work by Dome Gabon focused on the gold in stream anomaly highlighted by the 
UNDP and Randgold south of the Ogooue River east of Ndjolé (King, 2007).  The first soil 
grid completed in 2006 covers the Randgold stream anomaly by 200 m by 200 m spaced 
sampling (Figure 5).  Results are insignificant with only a few scattered highs in the south 
eastern corner of the grid.  In 2007, Dome Gabon obtained 30 ppb gold in soil contours 
from an unpublished Randgold program conducted over approximately the same area as 
Dome Gabon's sampling.  Two additional grids with 50 m by 50 m sample spacing were 
added to cover Randgold anomalies missed in 2006.  One grid reported negative assay 
results; scattered highs and a small, <500 m gold in soil anomaly were reported for the 
second grid.   
 
A third grid known as 'Mishanga grid' was sampled in 2007 to the north west of the stream 
anomaly on the other side of the Ogooue River (varying sample spacing between 50 m by 
100 m to 200 m by 20m) (Figure 5).  The purpose of this grid was to test old artisanal 
workings and a possible western extension of Randgold's stream and soil anomalies.  Only 
scattered or small, low-grade anomalies could be highlighted in the central part of the grid. 
 
A VTEM and magnetic survey of 30 km2 and 180 line km was commissioned in 2008 by 
Dome over La Mboumi Central.  Line spacing is 150 m flown at a direction of 135 (Figure 
4).  
 

6.6 Sysmin Geophysical Survey (2004-2010) 
A national scale airborne geophysical survey (magnetic and gamma-ray) led by the BRGM 
was conducted between +1 to -4 degrees N and 10 to 12 degrees East.  The technical 
responsibility for the survey lies with the South African Council for Geoscience and funding 
was provided by the European Union's Sysmin program.  Both fixed-wing and helicopter 
aircrafts were used. 
 
The survey covers the entire Ndjolé license and the complete dataset was acquired from 
the DGMG by Dome Gabon (Figure 4).

6.7 Dome Ventures and AngloGold Ashanti Joint Venture 2009-
2012   

6.7.1 Terms of the Deal  
In 2009 Dome Ventures Corp. ("Dome Ventures") entered into two joint-venture 
agreements with AngloGold Ashanti on the Ndjolé Property (subject of this report) and 
Mevang Property (not included in nor the subject of this report). 
 
AngloGold Ashanti earned a 20% interest in the two properties by paying to Dome 
Ventures, US$400,000 on signing of the joint-venture agreement.  AngloGold Ashanti was 
able to earn an additional 40% interest (60% in total) in the two properties by paying to 
Dome Ventures an additionalUS$100,000 per year over three years and by expending on 
exploration expenditures on the two properties the sum of US$3.7-million over the next 
three years at the rate of US$1-million in the first year, US$1.2-million in the second year 
and US$1.5-million in the third year.  
 
If AngloGold Ashanti failed to perform as set out above, a 100 % interest in the licenses 
shall revert to Dome Ventures and the joint venture shall be at an end.  AngloGold Ashanti 
was entitled to withdraw from the joint venture after it had spent US$1-million on exploration 
expenditures on the two properties. 
 
AngloGold Ashanti was able to earn an additional and final 10% interest (70% total) by 
spending US$5-million on exploration expenditures on the two properties within two years 
of earning into a 60% interest as set out above.  When the parties reached a 70:30 joint 
venture, if Dome Ventures elected not to contribute to work programs and budgets then 
AngloGold Ashanti was able to earn an additional 15% interest by carrying the project to a 
completed prefeasibility study. 
 
On August 2012 AngloGold Ashanti gave Dome Ventures formal written notice that it was 
withdrawing from the joint venture agreement signed in 2009. 
 
It appears that all work undertaken on the property from 2009 to 2012 was under the 
direction and by workers of AngloGold Ashanti.  The exploration programs undertaken by 
AngloGold Ashanti appear to exclusively focus on the gold potential of the Ndjolé Property.   

6.7.2 Geological Work 
 
Geological Mapping  
Mapping was initially concentrated on geochemical anomalies highlighted by historical work 
or by Dome Gabon's sampling, and a further focus was placed on the artisanal mining 
activities.  In a second-stage, the mapping focus shifted to additional targets along strike 
from known geochemical anomalies or identified from airborne geophysics.  In total 
approximately 440 km2 were mapped.  Outcrop is almost exclusively limited to river beds 
and therefore the mapping in the Ndjolé area consists essentially of walking traverses along 
the rivers.  Lithological, structural, alteration and mineralisation information is recorded for 
every outcrop, plotted on a map and all information is stored in coded form in the project 
database.  Alluvial workings were also mapped at the same time.  Coordinates for every 
observation were recorded using hand-held GPS devices.  An interpretation of the Ndjolé 
geology has been prepared using all available mapping, remote sensing and geophysical 
data (Figure 6).

Soil Sampling   
Several large soil sample campaigns have been implemented over the Ndjolé Property 
see (Figure 5 and Figure 7). A total of 31,791 soils samples were collected between 
2008 and 2011.  
 

Year No of Samples 
2008 2,624 
2009 5,500 
2010 14,362 
2011 9,305 

 
 A first campaign by Dome Gabon in 2008 covered most of the target areas previously 
defined by the BRGM and the UNDP and most of artisanal mine sites (La Mboumi East, 
Central, and West).  A small area north of the Ogooue River to the west of Ndjolé has been 
sampled by 'ridge and spur' sampling.  A second campaign under the joint venture 
executed in 2011 (9,305 soils samples) was designed to follow-up open gold in soil 
anomalies in the southern extension of La Mboumi  
 
All samples collected in 2008 were assayed for gold and a large part by multi-element 
methods (most infill sampling was only analysed for gold).  Most of the samples taken in 
2011 were not submitted for geochemical assay, but underwent XRF analysis on site.  
The 2008 Dome grids were sampled at a spacing of 400 m by 50 m except for the grid at 
La Mboumi Central that was sampled at 100 m sample spacing.  Gold anomalies were 
then infill sampled to a spacing of 100 m by 50 m.  The grids implemented in 2011 were 
sampled at 400 m by 50 m sample spacing.  A small anomalous gold area on the 2008 
Dome grid located between La Mboumi Central and West was infill sampled to 100 m by 
50 m sample spacing.   
 

6.7.3 Gold Anomalies  
The first grid sampled in 2011 between La Mboumi Central and East was to test the over 
12 km long gold in soil.  A second grid was sampled over the western limb of a doubly 
plunging antiformal structure located between La Mboumi Central and South.  A third 
grid was sampled to test possible extension of gold in soil anomalies to the west of La 
Mboumi West possibly controlled by a structure inferred from geophysics between La 
Mbomi West and the Ridge and Spur prospect.  
 
La Mboumi East is a 12km long by 2km large, open-ended gold in soil anomaly was 
defined at La Mboumi East over the inferred Eastern Shear (Figure 7).  The anomaly is 
coincident with a gold instream anomaly previously defined by the BRGM and the UNDP 
(Figure 3).  Artisanal miners are active in many streams along the anomaly.   
 
 La Mboumi Central has several >60 ppb gold in soil anomalies located around the same 
area as the UNDP gold in stream anomalies and later soil sampling at the northern end 
of La Mboumi Central.  The anomalies cover an area of approximately 1.5 km by 1 km. 
Several >60 ppb gold in soil anomalies were highlighted further south spreading over 3.3 
km strike length and 1.5 km width (Figure 7).

La Mboumi West has two areas of elevated gold in-soil (Figure 7).  One area is largely 
associated to several quartzite units outcropping along the ridges.  The quartzites are 
surrounded by 30-50 ppb gold haloes with small higher-grade cores.  The second anomaly 
extends for 2-2.5 km along a ridge with outcrops of graphite schist and greywacke mapped 
on the flanks.  Artisanal workings have been found in working streams shedding off the 
flanks of the hill.  Artisanal miners are active in the central part of La Mboumi West within 
the highlighted areas.  
 
Ridge and Spur is a 3.5 km by 1 km Au in soil anomaly open to the south is located on the 
Western Shear inferred from geophysics.  The southern extension has been soil sampled in 
2011, but the samples have not yet been submitted for assay.  A 2 km long, open anomaly 
was highlighted in the western corner of the sampling area.  
 

6.7.4 Manganese Anomalies 
The soils samples collected between 2006 and 2008 all underwent a multi-element analysis 
that also included manganese.  As a result Dome Gabon identified significant manganese 
anomalies in the La Mboumi Central (East 1 and East 2) (Figure 8) these anomalies being 
closely associated with the suspected gold mineralization in the area.  
 
Using the XRF on soils samples collected in 2009 and 2011, Dome Gabon identified 
significant manganese anomalies in the La Mboumi Central and La Mboumi South.  The 
soil samples collected by Dome Gabon show at least 5 "pods" which show the strongest 
manganese soil anomalies and are:  East 1, East 2, West 1, West 2, and West 3 (Figure 8).  
All the anomalies identified by Dome Gabon are reported to be 1,000 ppm Mn or higher see 
(also shown in Figure 8).  Details of the Figure 8 pods are:   

• East 1 anomaly is 2.5 km by 2.0 km; 
• East 2 anomaly is 4.2 km by 2.1 km and still open to the south;  
• West 1 anomaly is 3.6 km by 1.7 km and is open to the north; 
• West 2 anomaly is 3.3 km by 2.3 km; and  
• West 3 anomaly is 3.5 km by 1.3 km  

6.7.5 Rock Chip Sampling   
A total of 594 rock chip samples were collected over the main Ndjolé prospects.  Most 
samples are grab type samples taken predominantly from La Mboumi West and East 
during mapping.  Auriferous quartz veins found at La Mboumi East ('Shakira Veins') and 
quartz veins with higher silver grades found at La Mboumi West were followed up with 
additional sampling.  A suite of samples was collected from the laterite and gossanous 
float.   
 
On La Mboumi West a large number of quartz veins have been sampled.  Most of the 
samples returned assay results between 1 ppb to 10 ppb Au with only 16 samples out of 
299 samples taken assaying above 100 ppb Au and 4 samples above 1 ppm Au with a 
maximum tenor of 3.9 ppm (Figure 9).  All samples with higher gold tenors are located on 
the central part of La Mboumi West with one exception.  
 
On La Mboumi West and La Mboumi Central 10 rock samples assayed with over limits of 
manganese (>110,000 ppm) (Figure 15). None of these rocks were re-assayed to 
determine the true value.

Geophysics Survey  
In early 2011, a Magnetic/Electro-Magnetic ("EM") survey was flown over the southern part 
of the Ndjolé license covering all main prospects.  The survey was commissioned to 
Spectrem Limited, South Africa.  EM, magnetic, radiometric and terrain surveys were flown 
by fixed-wing aircraft at a flight height of 130 m above ground and a line spacing of 250 m 
(Figure 4).  A total of 3,660 line km were flown covering an area of approximately 930 km2.  
 

6.7.6  Diamond Drilling  
A 34 hole, 5,400 m diamond drilling program was conducted in 2010 and 2011 to test 
the gold in soil anomalies highlighted by Dome Gabon at: La Mboumi Central, West, and 
East, the auriferous Shakira quartz veins at La Mboumi East, and structural targets 
identified on geophysical imagery. Most of the drilling focused on the La Mboumi Central 
anomalies as these were deemed most prospective.  Collar locations are listed in (Table 
3).  
 
The drilling was subcontracted to the British company E Global Drilling ("EGD"), a 
subsidiary of Energold, Vancouver. A man portable 'EGD II' rig developed in house by 
Energold was used for all drilling.  All-terrain vehicles or teams of 2-4 people can carry 
the drill rig when vehicle access is not possible.  The top 40 m to 80 m were typically 
drilled with an HQ core diameter depending on ground conditions.  The remaining hole 
was then reduced to NQTW core size.  Occasionally ground and drill hole conditions 
necessitated reduction to BQTW core size.  A core barrel of 1.5 m or 3 m was used.  All 
drill holes were sighted by hand-held GPS and oriented by the geologist using a 
compass.  Drill azimuth and dip was measured every 30 down hole metres by a Reflex 
tool.  The drill contractor did not have a survey tool on-site during drilling of the first 9 
holes, and as a result, these were not surveyed.  Core was oriented every 6 m using a 
spear.  Core recovery was poor in many holes at the beginning of the drill program 
(several holes had a recovery below 50 %) and several holes were abandoned before 
reaching the target depth.  Recovery and daily drill rates improved significantly after the 
contractor imported all necessary chemicals and exchanged the initial crew with more 
experienced foreman and drillers.  
 
A review of the 2010-2011 electronic drilling database generated by AngloGold Ashanti 
was completed.  It appears that 34 of the 4,740 samples sent for ICP analysis had above 
detection limits for manganese (>110,000 ppm) (Table 4, Figure 12 and Figure 14).  It is 
unclear what the true assay value for manganese in drill holes NDDD-001, 8, 12, 16, 18, 
27 and 28.  The author suspects that the assays for the drill holes in Table 4 are 
underreported.  The author has been informed that AngloGold Ashanti was focusing on 
gold exploration and did not authorize the expenditure to further investigate the over 
limits of manganese.

7  Geological Setting and Mineralization  
 
The oldest rocks in Gabon are those of the Archean craton, occupying more than half of 
the Gabonese territory (Figure 13).  The Archean is commonly divided into the southern 
Chaillu Massif and the North Gabon Massif.  The craton is mainly composed of granitoids 
(diorite, tonalite, granodiorite, granite, syenite and charnockitic suites) and medium- to 
high-grade gneisses.  Small greenstone belts of amphibolite, iron-rich quartzites, and 
schists occur mostly in the North Gabon Massif, whereas remnants of supracrustal rocks 
are rare in the Chaillu Massif. 
 
Palaeoproterozoic rocks consist of several, more or less deformed and metamorphosed 
sedimentary basins with local volcanic deposits.  The Francevillian Supergroup rests 
unconformably on the Archean basement in the central and eastern part of Gabon.  The 
Francevillian is a dominantly clastic sedimentary sequence with local volcanic rocks 
deposited in three main basins.  It hosts important manganese and uranium deposits.  The 
Ogooue orogenic or mobile belt is located to the west of the Francevillian Supergroup.  
The orogenic belt is composed of high-grade metamorphosed sandstones and pelites with 
volcanics at the base forming the Ogooue Supergroup and migmatitic basement blocks or 
domes.  The Ndjolé and Kolissen Group rocks occur to the west of the Ogooue 
Supergroup.  The Ndjolé Group consists of metasediments with minor basic intrusives; the 
Kolissen Group is dominated by clastic metasediments with interlayered mafic and 
ultramafic volcanics and minor basic intrusives. 
 
The Ogooue orogenic belt, the Ndjolé-Kolissen Groups, the Francevillian Supergroup and 
the involved Archean basement are part of the 2 Ga. Eburnean West Central African 
orogen spanning from south western Cameroon to the Congo.  The sediments were 
probably deposited in syn-orogenic basins subsequently deformed and metamorphosed.  
The Orogen is separated by the major northwest-southeast oriented Ikoye-Ikobe transfer 
structure.  The Ogooue and Ndjolé Group located to the east of the Ikoye-Ikobe structure 
are thrusted to the east onto the Archean.  The western part consists of remobilised and 
migmatized basement blocks intruded by late- to post-tectonic granitoids. The 
Francevillian remains largely undeformed except along its western margin. 
 
The Noya and Nyanga basins of western Gabon are low-grade, calcareous-clastic 
sediments part of the West Congolian Supergroup deformed in the Neoproterozoic Pan-
African. 
 
The Bassin Côtier was formed during the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.  The basal units 
are Permian and Jurassic in age with most sediments deposited from middle Cretaceous 
to Quaternary.  The sediments deposited in the eastern sub basins are dominantly 
continental and lacustrine, whereas the outer basins consist mainly of marine deposits. 
This basin hosts Gabon's oil reserves. 
 
The bedrock at Ndjolé comprises folded, steeply to sub-vertically dipping, terrestrial and 
marine interbedded reduced black shale units, greywacke, sandstone, quartzite, mud- and 
siltstones and thin carbonate units.  A deltaic environment with relatively high energy influx 
of sediment, flood plains and estuaries is a likely environment in which the Ndjolé rocks 
were deposited.  Gabbros and norites have been found in outcrop and float in the southern 
part of the license.

Alluvial gold and manganese mineralization is known to occur within the Ndjolé Group. 
Artisanal gold workers have been known to rarely find alluvial diamonds. 

7.1 Property Geology and Mineralization 
 
The Ndjolé Property is located in the Palaeoproterozoic Ndjolé Group metasediments.  
The sedimentary package was deformed and metamorphosed during the Eburnean 
orogeny.  Then sedimentary package was then thrusted onto the Ogooue Supergroup and 
Archean basement. 
  
The bedrock at Ndjolé comprises folded, steeply to sub-vertically dipping, terrestrial and 
marine interbedded reduced black shale units, greywacke, sandstone, quartzite, mud- and 
siltstones and thin carbonate units (Figure 6)  A deltaic environment with relatively high 
energy influx of sediment, flood plains and estuaries is a likely environment in which the 
Ndjolé rocks were deposited.  Gabbros and norites have been found in outcrop and float in 
the southern part of the license.  
 
Lithologies and Units  
 
Graphite schist  
Graphitic schists are commonly encountered over the whole Ndjolé license area as thin 
interbeds within greywackes or fine grained, pelitic sediments or as thicker, individual units 
(Figure 6).  They are silty to gritty shales with more or less abundant carbonaceous 
material and carbonates.  The graphite schists vary from fairly soft, poorly lithified units to 
more competent, higher-grade metamorphic units.  Centimetric sandstone beds are 
common in certain units, but may be absent in other units.  Clasts and pebbles of 
sandstone or quartzite are commonly found isolated or in beds.  The graphite schist is very 
rich in supergene or diagenetic pyrite preferentially crystallising over sandy beds or along 
bedding planes.  The higher grade schists show recrystallization of supergene pyrite into 
larger, euhedral diagenetic pyrite crystals along bedding planes.  Locally the pyrite is 
metamorphically altered to pyrrhotite.  Manganiferous horizons also frequently occur in 
graphite schist.  The graphite schists weather to a whitish, kaolinitic upper saprolite and a 
greyish-purplish lower saprolite. 
 
Greywacke  
Greywacke beds are commonly encountered in outcrop over the whole Ndjolé license but 
are mainly seen between La Mboumi East and Central and at La Mboumi West (Figure 6).  
They form decametric to metric beds interbedded with narrow beds of graphite schist or 
pelitic sediments.  They are composed of sand to 4 mm to 5 mm large clasts of dominantly 
quartz grains and grain aggregates with varying amounts of feldspar, lithic fragments, and 
muscovite in a fine matrix of quartz, sericite, carbonaceous material and lithic fragments. 
The colour of the greywackes varies from light to dark grey.  Soft sediment deformation is 
commonly observed as small folds and disrupted beds.  Turbid currents have possibly 
deposited the greywackes.  Disseminated, euhedral pyrite and local pyrrhotite are 
common in the greywackes.   
 
 



39 
 

Quartzite  
These often thicker quartzite units often outcrop forming steep, near-vertical cliff faces up 
to 30 m to 50 m height as seen for example at La Mboumi Central (Figure 6).  The quartz 
is mostly very fine grained with occasional coarser sandy units with a chalcedonic matrix.  
The texture observed is weakly granoblastic.  At La Mboumi Central the quartzite is locally 
strongly ferruginous.  The quartzite is strongly silicified giving it a very massive, almost 
cherty appearance and commonly shows stockwork quartz veining and crackle 
brecciation.  The veins range from a few millimetres to decametres in thickness; the quartz 
is massive and whitish-opaque.  Quartzite outcrops become saccharoidal when exposed 
to weathering.  
 
Carbonates 
Carbonate units have only been encountered in drill core from La Mboumi Central.  They 
are impure carbonates with a varying component of sandy, carbonaceous or pelitic 
composition.  They form thin units of maximum 20 m to 30 m thickness often found 
interbedded with graphite schist or fine clastic, sedimentary units.  Their texture varies 
between fairly massive beds to finely laminated.   
 
Chlorite schist  
Chlorite schist occurs in drill core from La Mboumi Central and in outcrop south of La 
Mboumi Central to La Mboumi South.  The rock is schistose, fine to medium grained, 
granoblastic and composed of chlorite, quartz, carbonate (calcite) with occasional 
muscovite and feldspar (Figure 6).  Quartz occurs as anhedral, slightly elongated grains 
distributed within the chlorite or as small aggregates and bands along the foliation.  Calcite 
is distributed among the quartz or occurring as segregations.  Quartz pebbles up to 
several centimetres in size have been observed in drill core.  Finely disseminated pyrite is 
common.  The chlorite schists weather to a strong reddish colour in the lower saprolite. 
 
Basic to intermediate intrusives 
Basic to intermediate intrusive rocks metamorphosed to greenschist facies have been 
mapped at La Mboumi South where they appear as massive to jointed outcrops and 
abundant float in the heads of streams.  The rocks are very fine to fine or medium grained 
(< 2.4 mm), even grained and granoblastic to granular.  They are composed of 60-70% 
actinolite-tremolite and 30-40% of saussuritic epidote.  The amphiboles are light greenish-
brownish to almost colourless indicating that they are close to the tremolite end member in 
composition.  The epidote occurs interstitial to the amphibole probably replacing 
plagioclase.  Quartz, chlorite, and leucoxene can occur as minor phases.  The epidote-
amphibole rocks were probably originally fine grained norites or dolerites metamorphosed 
to greenschist facies.  
 
Permian conglomerates 
The conglomerates outcrop south of La Mboumi west along the La Mboumi river.  The 
clasts are poly-sorted ranging from a few millimetres to over half a metre in size and are 
well rounded.  The composition of the clasts is polymictic and composed of granitoids, 
biotite-quartz-muscovite gneiss and clastic sediments.  A greywacke matrix with larger 
quartz and probably feldspar mineral fragments supports the clasts.  The conglomerates 
have a dark brownish weathering colour.  
 
Metamorphism and Deformation  
The structural architecture in Ndjolé is dominated by a large fold structure with a north-
easterly striking axial plane.  The strata to the north of the Ogooue River show an ESE to

WNW direction and bend into the dominant NNE to NE direction commonly seen south of 
Ndjolé.  
 
The bedding is commonly well defined by changes in sediment composition or clast size.  
The bedding is steeply to sub vertically dipping (70-90°) over the whole project area.  
Although the dip of the beds is very steep, a preferential dip direction to the west is 
observed over the project area (Figure 6).  Open to Narrow/isoclinal, centimetric to metric 
folding is often observed in outcrop, especially north of La Mboumi West in the hinge zone 
of larger order folds.  The axial plane is striking NE to ENE and is steeply to sub vertically 
dipping predominantly to the west.  The fold axis is dipping at 45-90° (about 60° in 
average) to the NE or SW.  In La Mboumi East and La Mboumi Central the cleavage 
occurs at a small angle to the bedding and can be harder to identify.  The folds are 
occasionally disrupted by faults developing in the limbs.  
 
Two shear- or fault zones are inferred from geophysical imagery at La Mboumi East and 
west of La Mboumi West.  A linear feature is well visible on the magnetic images at La 
Mboumi East.  The geophysical signature is clearly different east and west of the inferred 
structure.  This is interpreted as two different lithological domains that have been 
structurally juxtaposed.  The linear features also appear on the radiometric images. 
Possibly this reflects hydrothermal alteration.  
 
Strike-slip faults oriented ENE to NE are visible on the geophysical images.  They show 
sinistral or less often dextral displacement of 200 m to 300 m.  These structures have 
occasionally been observed in outcrop where they generate S-C structures.  It is unknown 
it these structures are linked to any mineralization.  
 
The soil anomalies in the southern part of the property are combined into approximately a 
50 km2 footprint.  The manganese anomaly footprint is open to the south, west, and 
partially to the east.  The anomalies East 1, East 2, West 1, West 2, and West 3 currently 
represent the primary areas of interest.  The  actual size of manganese mineralization is 
not know at this time.  
 
The only drill hole to have accurate values for manganese is DDD0002 where 35 m of 
22% including 4 m of 45% was intersected.  The drilling reports indicated that many of the 
early drill holes had extremely poor recovery which may have may lead to under reporting 
of the actual widths of the manganese mineralization.    
 
Historical Drilling reviled a manganese rich black, calcareous shale horizons in several 
holes including NDDD018 (100 m drill width) and NDD028 (20 m drill width).  The 
manganese content of the unweathered shale parent lithology can range from 5% to >11% 
Mn. 
 
Thin manganese rich bands within fresh carbonate-siltstone were also drilled in holes 
NDD011 (8 m drill width) and NDDD016 (5 m drill width). The true width is not known The 
manganese content within the unweathered siltstone parent lithology also varies from 5% 
to >11% Mn. 
 
The manganese mineralization seen in the Ndjolé area appears to have been enriched via 
supergene processes.  The main manganese oxide  seen in the core is "pyrolusite".  
Typically this type of enrichment occurs as small discreet pods and a mine targeting this 
kind of mineralization generally consists of a number of shallow open pits where deeply 
weathered manganese bearing lithologies are exposed and preserved.

8   Deposit Types 
 
The elements being explored for by BHK are manganese and gold.   
 
Manganese Model 
after Force et al., 1999 
 
Manganese deposits occur within shallow, marine stratigraphic sequences such as "black 
shale" pinch outs or sedimentary rocks deposited near onset of marine regression are 
particularly favourable for exploration.  High Mn concentrations are further enhanced in 
depositional environments characterized by weak clastic sedimentation.  Manganese 
carbonates occur basin-ward from the manganese oxide ore.  Many sedimentary 
manganese deposits are formed during periods of high sea levels that are 
contemporaneous with adjacent anoxic basin.  
 
Traditionally these deposits are regarded as shallow, marine Mn sediments that form rims 
around paleo-islands and anoxic basins.  Manganese precipitation is believed to take 
place in stratified water masses at the interface between anoxic seawater and near 
surface oxygenated waters.  Extreme Fe fractionation is caused by a low solubility of iron 
in low Eh environments where Fe precipitates as iron sulphide.  A subsequent increase in 
Eh and/or pH of Mn-rich water may produce Mn-rich, Fe-depleted chemical sediments.  
The manganese oxide facies is preserved on oxidized substrates carbonate facies may be 
preserved either in oxidized or reduced substrates in slightly deeper waters 
 
Laterally extensive beds of manganite, psilomelane, pyrolusite, rhodochrosite and other 
manganese minerals that occur within marine sediments, such as dolomite, limestone, 
chalk and black shale.  The manganese sediments often display a variety of textures, 
including oolites and sedimentary pisolites, rhythmic laminations, slumped bedding, hard-
ground fragments and abundant fossils.  The "Primary ore" is commonly further enriched 
by supergene process.  Most deposits have formed during lower to middle Paleozoic, 
Jurassic, mid-Cretaceous and Proterozoic 
 
Gold Model 
 
Alluvial gold occurrences have been known and exploited in Ndjolé for over 100 years, but 
it is only in the 1970s that search for the source of gold has started. 
 
Early models favoured a shear- or vein-hosted deposit based on the widespread 
occurrence of angular, coarse grained alluvial gold and sampling of small auriferous quartz 
veins.  Early explorers noted the seeming control of structures, possible structural 
intersections and change in structural orientation on the distribution of alluvial workings. 
 
Results from 2010-2011 drilling have confirm a strong structural control on primary 
mineralisation with gold located in shear zones or more brittle, faulted and brecciated 
structures, as well as small, narrow quartz veins.

BHK has not undertaken a drill program on the Ndjolé Property.  All drilling on the property 
is described in the History section of this report.    
 

11  Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security   
 
Dome Gabon has undertaken several exploration programs from 2006 to 2012.  The 
descriptions of their sampling procedures are below.  All analytical laboratories used for 
the Nijole Property are  independent of the  all reporting issuers.  
 

11.1  Sampling Protocols for the 2010-2011 Drilling Program 
 
After drilling the core was transported to the Ndjolé base where it was cleaned and dried 
under the sun.  The dry core was laid out on a metal rail, put back together and metre 
marks were put onto the core.  Core loss was recorded and recovery percentages were 
calculated for every core run.  Reliable orientation marks were traced onto the core 
(bottom of core marked).  A cutting line was also traced at a slight angle to the orientation 
line in order to preserve the orientation line after cutting and sampling.  After mark-up the 
geotechnician and the geologist logged the core.  The core was also photographed. 
 
Once the logging terminated, sample intervals and sample numbers were assigned by the 
geotechnician under supervision of the geologist.  If possible, sample intervals did not 
cross over lithological units and larger veins were sampled separately.  In general 1 m 
core intervals were sampled.  Soft core was split with a machete in two equal halves for 
sampling.  Competent core was cut by diamond-blade saw.  Cooling water from the saw 
was not circulated to avoid contamination and the blade was regularly cleaned.  The full 
half of the core was then crushed to 2 mm to 3 mm chips at the preparation lab at the 
Ndjolé field office.  The crusher is cleaned with compressed air after every sample.  
Coarse blank material is used to clean the crusher after at least every 15-20 samples.  At 
least 500 g of sample material was split using a splitter for geochemical assay.  The 
coarse rejects are kept at the field office for reference. 
 
The crushed sample was analysed by portable XRF and its magnetic susceptibility was 
measured. 
 
The samples are packed into wooden boxes and sent by airmail to ALS Chemex (an 
ISO9001 accredited laboratory) in Johannesburg, South Africa. At the lab the sample is

pulverised to 75 μ (85% passing).  Every sample is analysed for gold by fire assay with 
ICP-AES finish (50 g charge) and for 48 elements by four acid digestion ICP-MS. 
 
Every batch of 100 samples contains 5 standard, 5 blank, and 5 duplicate samples. 
Reference and blank material pre-packaged into sachets from Rock labs New Zealand 
was used.  Duplicate samples were taken at regular intervals by sampling a second 
fraction from the splitter. 
 

11.2  2008 Soil sampling  
 
The samplers used a hand-held GPS to identify the sample spot.  A sample number is 
assigned using pre-printed tags torn out of sample booklets.  About 1 kg to 2 kg of sample 
is bagged in plastic bags sampled at a depth of approximately 30 cm. 
 
The samples are dried under the sun and approximately 200 g of material is separated for 
analysis by portable X-Ray Fluorescence Technique (XRF) and dispatched to the lab.  The 
sample is not treated before splitting and no splitting protocol was used.  The remaining 
sample is stored for reference.  
 
The samples are packed into wooden boxes and sent by airmail to ALS Chemex in 
Johannesburg, South Africa (an accredited laboratory). 
 
At the lab the sample is pulverised to 75 μ (85% passing).  Every sample is analysed for 
gold by fire assay with ICP-AES finish (50 g charge) and for 51 elements by aqua regia 
digestion ICP-MS. 
 
Every batch of 100 samples contains 4 standard, blank, and field duplicate samples.   
 

11.3   2011 Soil sampling  
 
The sampler identifies the sample spot using a hand-held GPS.  Sample numbers are pre-
assigned to sample coordinates in the office.  A pre-printed sample tag is torn out of 
sample booklets and fixed to a plastic sample bag.  The sample number is clearly written 
by marker pen onto the bag.  The exact coordinate and elevation of the sample is written 
into the sample booklet together with the orientation of the slope and additional comments 
by the sampler. 
 
An approximately 30 cm deep pit is dug with the aid of a machete and 1 kg to 2 kg of soil 
material is put into the prepared sample bag. 
 
The coordinates written in the sample booklets are checked against the pre-assigned 
coordinates once the sample arrives back at the field base. 
 
The samples are dried in plastic bowls under the sun for 2-3 days.  The sample is gently 
disaggregated using a glass bottle.  A photograph of the sample is taken and the presence 
of quartz or rock chips, pisoliths and sand is logged.  Larger rock chips are then sorted 
out.  The remaining sample is then fully disaggregated with a glass bottle on a newspaper.  
The disaggregated sample is homogenised and quartered.  Opposite quarters are

combined and one half is bagged for dispatch to the lab and the other half is archived.  
Then the sample was analysed by portable XRF.  
 
X-Ray Fluorescence Technique ("XRF")  
XRF instruments work by exposing a sample to a beam of X-rays.  The atoms of the 
sample absorb energy from the X-rays, become temporarily excited and then emit 
secondary X-rays.  Each chemical element emits X-rays at a unique energy.  By 
measuring intensity and characteristic energy of the emitted X-rays, an XRF analyzer can 
provide qualitative and quantitative analysis regarding the composition of the material 
being tested. 
 
InnovX X-5000 Mobile XRF 
X-5000 mobile systems are equipped with an industrial grade X-ray Fluorescence analyzer 
high resolution detector system (<165 eV FWHM at 5.95 keV Mn spectral line); 50 KeV, 10 
W Tantalum X-ray Tube, Adjustable; Windows based Pentium Computer with pre-loaded 
analytical software, 316 Stainless Steel standardization coupon and check standards.  The 
XRF machine analyses 31 multi elements:  Ag, As, Ba, Bi, Ca, Cd, Cl, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, 
K, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, S, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, Th, Ti, U, V, W, Zn and Zr. 
 
The InnovX-X 5000 Mobile XRF has a reported detection limit of 2 ppm for manganese. 
 
An exploration program of this nature the geological team is looking for anything that may 
give an anomalous reading. This means anything that is different from the general 
background reading,  The use of the XRF is valuable tool to identify potential anomalies in 
comparison to other samples analysed using the same XRF method.   The actual reading 
from the XRF is not important; the key issue is its relativity to the other samples being 
analyzed.   Comparing sample values from and XRF and an accredited assay laboratory  
is the  like comparing apples to oranges. 
   
Mobile XRF systems are becoming the industry standard to test for element while still in 
the field, without the expense of quantitative analytical laboratory costs.  The author is of 
the opinion the use of the InnovX-X 5000 Mobile XRF is a suitable instrument to be used 
for the level of exploration currently being undertaken on the Ndjolé Property. 
 
The author is satisfied with adequacy of sample preparation, security and the analytical 
procedures used in the collection of samples during 2006 to 2012 exploration programs.  
 
At the current stage of exploration the geological controls and true widths of mineralized 
zones are not known and the occurrence of any significantly higher grade intervals within 
lower grade intersections has not been evidenced. 
 
Author's Collected Samples   
The author is satisfied with adequacy of sample preparation, security and the analytical 
procedures used in the collection of the 5 core and 14 soils during the site visit.  The 
author is of the opinion that the description of sampling methods and details of location, 
number, type, nature and spacing or density of samples collected, and the size of the area 
covered are all adequate for the current stage of exploration for the Property 
 
There was no bias in the sampling program completed during the Property visit that was 
undertaken to test the repeatability of sample results obtained from previous sampling 
campaigns.  The author solely, as a quality control measure, designed the program.

According to the electronic database provided of the 2010-2011 drilling program Mn was 
not typically tested for over limits.  The exception was drill hole NDDD0002 where sample 
number 30108 reported a 20.1 % Mn and the author reported value is 21.72 %. The 
authors and historical value are congruent with each other.  
 
The soil samples submitted by the author underwent laboratory package 1DX2 a 36 
element Aqua Regia digestion ICP-MS  
 
The author selected 14 soils samples from previous explorations program that were 
analyzed by the XRF method.  The intent was to compare XRF Mn results against the Mn 
ICP assay results (Table 8).  It is clear that the ICP assays are significantly higher than 
XRF.  Based on the fact the XRF analysis are significantly lower  than the ICP assays any 
anomaly identified by XRF can be considered valid exploration target.

The No. 1 Geological Exploration Institute of the China Bureau of Metallurgical and 
Geological Exploration defined three ore bodies of I, II, and III through trenches, shallow 
shafts and drill holes.  Details of these ore bodies are described below: 
 
Orebody I 
Ore body I is thick and tabular and is located in the south-east slope of oxidized and 
leached sedimentary manganese ore body that is located in the SE slope of Bembélé 
Mountain.  Its footwall rock is ferromanganese siltstone and hanging wall rock is quartz 
schist.  The ore body is more than 3,000 m long and 150 to 1,350 m wide with an average 
thickness of 2.92 m.  It trends northeast (20E to 60E) and dips to the south-east at angles 
of 15 to 42°.  The average Mn grade is 36.75%. 
 
Orebody II 
Ore body II is distributed at the south-east slope of Bembélé Mountain.  It is about 3,000 m 
long with a maximum width of 925 m and an average thickness of 1.33 m.  The average 
Mn grade is 15.55%. 
 
Orebody III 
Ore body III is also a tabular ore body located in the Menduman section.  It is about 600 m 
long and 100 m wide with an average thickness of 3.54 m.  It trends south-east (110E) and 
dips to the south-west at angles of 34 to 44°.  The average Mn grade is 26.28%. 
 
Metallic minerals in ore bodies I and II are mainly pyrolusite, psilomelane, and manganese 
silicate minerals and minor iron minerals of hematite and limonite.  Gangue minerals are 
mainly quartz with minor clay minerals.  In ore body III, metallic minerals consist mainly of 
pyrolusite, psilomelane, and manganese silicate minerals and minor limonite.  Gangue 
minerals are mainly quartz with minor day minerals 
 
The main strata of the Bembélé Manganese Mine area are metamorphosed sandstone 
and argillaceous siltstone and carbonaceous quartz-schist.  They gently dip at angles of 
15 to 35°.  The ore bodies are about 3m thick at the top of these formations and are 
exposed at the surface along the slope, which is suitable for open-pit mining. 
 
Mine is in the Pox Formation of Ogooue Group.  This formation from bottom to top 
consists of: conglomerate, fine grained metamorphic sandstone, manganese and graphite 
bearing quartz schist, manganese/iron sandstone, as well as lumpy and banded Mn ore 
bodies.  In the property area the strata is folded in a simple wavy monocline, dipping SE.  
Two sets of faults are present:  a). Strike NE (20 – 30⁰) and dip SW (60-80⁰) and b). Strike 
NW (20⁰) and dip NE to SW at 80⁰.  No intrusives.

17  Interpretation and Conclusions 
 
The Ndjolé Property geology is comprised of folded, steeply to sub-vertically dipping, 
terrestrial and marine interbedded reduced black shale units, greywackes, sandstones, 
quartzites, mud- and siltstones and thin carbonate units.  A deltaic environment with 
relatively high energy influx of sediment, flood plains and estuaries is a likely environment 
in which the Ndjolé rocks were deposited.  Gabbros and norites have been found in 
outcrop and float in the southern part of the license.  
 
The Ndjolé Property has seen extensive soils soil extensive stream sampling, various 
geophysical programs, some detailed mapping and minimal drilling.  As a result several 
areas of anomalous manganese and gold values have been identified. 
 
The work done by Dome Gabon represents the first to identify the manganese potential of 
the Property.   
 
The soil anomalies in the southern part of the property are combined into approximately a 
50 km2 footprint.  The manganese anomaly footprint is open to the south, west, and 
partially to the east.  The anomalies East 1, East 2, West 1, West 2, and West 3 currently 
represent the primary areas of interest.  
 
The 2010- 2011 drilling focused on gold exploration with limited results.  As a result of this 
drilling several underreported manganese intercepts were encountered.  Drill holes 
NDDD001, 8, 12, 16, 18, 27 and 28 all had over limits for manganese (>11%) and should 
be assayed to determine the true value.  Based on author inspection of several of the drill 
holes were pyrolusite, the author suspects that the many of the over limit sections are 
significantly higher.  The only drill hole to have accurate values for manganese is 
DDD0002 where 35 m of 22% including 4 m of 45% was intersected.  The drilling reports 
indicated that many of the early drill holes had extremely poor recovery which may have 
may lead to under reporting of the actual widths of the manganese mineralization.    
 
Drilling reviled a manganese rich black, calcareous shale horizons in several holes 
including NDDD018 (100 m drill width) and NDD028 (20 m drill width).  The manganese 
content of the unweathered shale parent lithology can range from 5% to >11% Mn. 
 
Thin manganese rich bands within fresh carbonate-siltstone were also drilled in holes 
NDD011 (8 m drill width) and NDDD016 (5 m drill width).  The manganese content within 
the unweathered siltstone parent lithology also varies from 5% to >11% Mn. 
 
The surface expression of the sub-vertically dipping manganiferous shale units coincides 
with current strong manganese soil anomalies in the East 1 area.  
 
The manganese mineralization seen in the Ndjolé area appears to have been enriched via 
supergene processes.  The main manganese oxide ore seen in the core is "pyrolusite".  
Typically this type of enrichment occurs as small discreet pods and a mine targeting this 
kind of mineralization generally consists of a number of shallow open pits where deeply 
weathered manganese bearing lithologies are exposed and preserved.

The historical gold exploration assays gave 4.9 m at 13.1 g/t Au from drill hole NDDD0017 
drilled at La Mboumi Central.  The mineralization is hosted at a sheared contact between 
chlorite and graphite schist.  The gold mineralization appears to be largely structurally 
controlled.  The highest grades are within graphite schist with strong pyrite (20-40%) and 
silicification.  Quartz veining is absent.  The shear zone has been intersected in two 
additional holes located 800 m and 1,000 m away along strike to the north and south.  
However, intercepted gold mineralisation reported much lower at 1.0 m at 2.3 g/t Au in the 
northern drill hole and 2.0 m at 1.5 g/t Au, 2.0 m at 1.1 g/t Au, and 1.0 m at 1.0 g/t Au in 
the southern drill hole.  Most of the remaining holes reported narrow, low grade gold 
intercepts controlled by brittle faulting and brecciation or narrow shears.  Drill results for La 
Mboumi East were disappointing, however only quartz veins were assayed– not the 
inferred shear zone that could host further mineralization. 
 
The author is unaware of any significant risks and uncertainties that could reasonably be 
expected to affect the reliability or confidence in the exploration information provide in this 
report.   The author is unaware of any foreseeable uncertainties that impact  the project's 
continued viability. 
 
In the authors opinion the property warrants an exploration program focusing on the 
manganese potential. 

18  Recommendations  
 
In the qualified person's opinion the character of the Ndjolé Property is sufficient to merit 
the following one phase work program:  

 
• Test the manganese anomaly at East 1 by using an auger drill rig; including areas 

where pyrolusite was observed in the core  
• Re-assay the existing core where over limits of manganese were found  
• Excavate a series of pits in the East 1 area to map/characterise the manganese 

layer more accurately; obtain larger samples for mineralogy and metallurgy. 
• Auger drilling of East 2 and West 3 manganese anomalies
