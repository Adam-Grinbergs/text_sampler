1 SUMMARY

Donald Boyack, consulting exploration geologist and fellow of the Australasian Institute of
Mining and Metallurgy was commissioned by Westport Resources Namibia (Pty) Ltd.
("Westport"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Toronto Stock Exchange listed Forsys Metals
Corp. ("Forsys"), and Golconda Capital Corp. ("Golconda") to provide an independent
Qualified Person's Review and Technical Report ("Report") for the Ondundu gold project
("the Project") located in Namibia.

Forsys indirectly holds 100% of the 19,969 hectare Ondundu gold project, which is
comprised of an Exclusive Prospecting Licence ("EPL") 3195 issued by the Republic of
Namibia Ministry of Mines and Energy. EPL 3195 was awarded to Omajete Mining
Company (Nambia) (Pty) Ltd. ("OM") in 2003 and Westport acquired 100% of OM in 2007.
EPL 3195 is currently in good standing until May 29, 2011. Namibia has a stable, mining-
friendly democratically elected Government. Mining presently accounts for about 20% of the
Country's gross domestic product and the mining industry employs 3% of the population.

Through a letter of intent dated May 6, 2010 and amended May 31, 2010, Golconda
("Golconda") acquired the arm's length right to earn up to a 75% interest in the Project from
Forsys via an amalgamation with Angus Mining (Namibia) Ltd. ("Angus"). Angus has the
right to earn up to a 75% interest in the Project by earning into OM, which is the holding
entity for the Project. Under the agreement, Angus must spend US$5 million in exploration
on the Project on or before November 6, 2011 and issue 3 million Angus common shares
and 3 million Angus common share purchase warrants exercisable at C$0.35 in the first
year and C$0.50 in the second year to earn an initial 50.1% interest. Angus can then elect to
earn an additional 24.9% interest in the Project by spending an additional US$6 million in
exploration on the Project and completing a bankable feasibility study by November 6, 2012.
Should Angus elect to earn the additional 24.9%, Westport retains a 1% net smelter royalty
on all gold production from the Project. Angus is Project operator. Golconda is a capital pool
company and intends for the Proposed Acquisition to constitute the Qualifying Transaction
of the Corporation as such terms is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange.

The Ondundu project is located in north-central Namibia approximately 242 km via paved
road from the capital city of Windhoek to the town of Omaruru and then 104 km via a dirt
road from Omaruru to the Project. The total driving time from Windhoek is 3.5 hours. The
area is characterized by undulating to hilly topography with an average elevation of 1,000
metres above sea level. A 220 KV electrical power line runs 15 km east of the Project.

Regionally, the Ondundu project is situated in the Outjo Zone (Swakop Group) of the upper
Proterozoic Pan African Damara Orogen, occupying the palaeo-eugeosynclinal facies of the
southern Congo-Kasai Craton margin, to the immediate south of the Otavi Platform.

The geology of the Project comprises Neo-Proterozoic Kuiseb Formation rocks of the Upper
Swakop Group represented as a monotonous succession of argillaceous and arenaceous
lithologies.

Gold mineralization on the Project was first discovered in 1917 and intermittent underground
plus alluvial mining took place from 1923 to 1945. Modern day exploration began in the
1980s when Tsumeb Corporation Limited ("TCL") and Goldfields Namibia Ltd. ("GFN")
completed 28 diamond drill holes totalling 5,583 metres in the Ondundu Main zone ("OMZ").



5 | P a g e

In 1983 a historic resource estimate of 42 million tonnes grading 0.39 gram gold per tonne
was produced by TCL, in 1987 a historic resource of 4.57 million tonnes grading 3.39 grams
gold per tonne was reported by GFN and in 1989 a historic resource of 4.35 million tonnes
grading 3.19 grams gold per tonne was reported by GFN. These resources are historical
and not compliant with National Instrument 43-101 reporting standards; however they are
considered material to the prospectivity of the Ondundu gold project. A "qualified person" for
the purposes of NI 43-101 has not done sufficient work to qualify the historical estimate as
current mineral resources or mineral reserves. The historical estimates should not be
treated as current mineral resources or mineral reserves and the historical estimates
contained herein should not be relied upon.

In 1999 a joint venture between Keadeber Resources (Pty) Ltd (75%) and Southern Cross
Exploration (25%) completed a 600 kg bulk sample of mineralized material from the OMZ.
The sample was submitted to the mineral processing division of Mintek Laboratories in
Johannesburg. The sizing distribution analysis indicates that the gold occurs predominantly
in the coarser size ranges, i.e. +250µm. Approximately 11% of the gold occurs in the -25µm.

In 2005-2006, Westport completed verification and systematic rock chip sampling,
hyperspectral surveys and drilled eleven diamond drill holes totalling 524.7 metres.

In 2007-2008, Westport focused on the potential strike extent of the previously identified
mineralization of the OMZ by collecting 3,431 trench channel samples from 18 trenches.
Over the entire Project, a total of 23 trenches were sampled covering an area of 7,000
metres long by 250-300 metre wide.

In 2009, detailed ground geophysical surveys (ground magnetics and ground spectrometry)
identified anomalies in the southeast, northwest, east and west of the OMZ that are
indicative of further resource expansion potential.

Westport acquired 100% of OM in a two stage earn-in process, first through the acquisition
of 32% and then 68%, which included issuing 500 000 ordinary common shares and a cash
portion of C$ 50,000. Westport completed the acquisition in 2007 and has since spent in
excess of US$400,000 exploring the Project.

Exploration work to date has largely focussed on the OMZ area where gold mineralization is
confined to bedding within conformable glassy grey laminated quartz-carbonate veins.
Accessory minerals include pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, marcasite, siderite,
ankerite and limonite. Minor amounts of sphalerite and galena have been noted.

North of the OMZ, the Zebraberg OD6 Grid area is predominantly Cu/Au mineralized, with
complex structural controls demonstrated. Brittle EW fractures have acted as conduits for
secondary Cu minerals (malachite, chrysocolla, azurite and cuprite). Up to eighteen breccias
blows have been noted in the field, some containing significant amounts of pyrite in the
matrix. Numerous gossans have also been noted. Small-scale mining by trenching had been
carried out in the 1950s, however no significant ore reserves were defined. Drilling by GFN
during the 1980s (5 diamond holes) did not intersect mineable grades.

The regional geological setting and gold mineralization identified on the Project indicates
that ore bearing fluids are synchronous with a major period of regional compression. The
resultant structural increase in crustal thickness is believed to have caused prograde
regional metamorphism of the underlying stratigraphy resulting in the formation and release



6 | P a g e

of auriferous hydrothermal fluids. These fluids are postulated to have migrated up fault
splays associated with major regional structures to be precipitated in nearby favourable low
pressure dilation zones created when the hydraulic pressure of trapped fluids exceeded
lithostatic pressure during local seismic events. This is a classic setting for the formation of
large-scale, sediment hosted, orogenic gold deposits.

The Author tenders the following recommendations:

 The operating company must institute an industry acceptable quality
assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program for a sampling program and should
ensure that all procedures are fully established and adhered to.

 The operating company should retain the services of a licensed Qualified Person, as
defined under NI 43-101, to supervise all aspects of exploration and development
activities on the Project.

 The Author recommends the following exploration activities be completed:

 The operating company embark on a rigorous exploration campaign that would
involve detailed geological and structural mapping and sampling to define the overall
limits of the OMZ mineralizing system.

 A two staged program is warranted with the first stage comprising environmental
base line studies, ground geophysical surveys, 20,000 metres of combined core and
percussion drilling and 4,280 metres of rotary air blast drilling. The initial program is
estimated to cost C$5,226,272.

 In the first phase, the operating company is recommended to conduct a combined
core and percussion drilling programme aimed at infilling and expanding the OMZ
target to allow for a mineral resource estimate to be prepared in accordance with NI
43-101 and if warranted move forward towards prefeasibility level studies.

 In the first phase, the operating company is recommended to conduct a detailed
exploration program over the OD6 area, including a rotary air blast drilling program to
determine the mineral potential of this area.

 The Phase two program is contingent on the results of the first phase program and
includes bulk sampling, metallurgical testing and completion of an environmental
impact assessment. The estimated cost of the second phase program is
C$5,636,500. The results from the two staged program will allow the operating
company to evaluate the merits of the Project to the prefeasibility level of
development.

3 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS

The design of the 2006 diamond drill program completed by Westport and subsequent
exploration work was solely based upon a review of 28 historical diamond drill holes (5,583
m) completed by Tsumeb Corporation Limited ("TCL") and Gold Fields Namibia ("GFN")
between 1980 and 1989. Original diamond drill logs, assay data, and geological section and
plan maps, filed at the Westport office in Windhoek, were used during this review.
Professional geotechnical personnel supervised the exploration programs completed by
TCL/GFN. The exploration techniques, geological logging and sampling practices, and
assay laboratory procedures were consistent with accepted standards and practices of the
time.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

(Westport Resources Namibia)

4.2 Property and Title in Namibia

Within the Republic of Namibia the government holds all mineral rights. Mineral exploration
and development is controlled by the 1992 Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act, which is
administered by the Ministry of Mines and Energy.

Prospecting, mineral exploration and mining activities are governed through the awarding of
mining claims and four distinct licences. The Republic of Namibia on the basis of a
proponent's technical and financial capability awards exclusive Prospecting Licences, such
as EPL 3195.

Mineral claims are intended for small-scale mines and mineral deposits and may only be
established by Namibian citizens. To establish a mining claim, the proponent must
physically identify the corner boundary points of the claim. The application for a mineral
concession involves the filing of documents. The mineral concession boundaries are
specified in the application documents.

4.3 Surface Rights Title

Within Namibia mineral and surface rights are administered separately. Land is either state,
or privately owned. Under the Mining Act a licence holder wishing to conduct ground based
exploration programs, on private land, must first obtain written permission to access the land
from the landholder. Access to private land may not be withheld unreasonably. EPL 3195 is



12 | P a g e

located on state land, as such; a surface access agreement is not required to conduct
mineral exploration.

4.4 Permitting

The holder of an EPL is entitled to carry on prospecting operations in respect of such
mineral or group of minerals specified in the licence. The holder of the EPL is further entitled
to remove any mineral or group of minerals other than a control mineral or sample of such
mineral or group of minerals for any purpose other than sale or disposal, found or
incidentally won in the course of the prospecting operation to any other place within
Namibia.

The holder of the EPL is additionally entitled, with the written permission of the
Commissioner:

 to remove any mineral or group of minerals or any control mineral or sample of such
mineral for any purpose other than sale or disposal from any place where it was
found or incidentally won in the course of prospecting operation to any place whether
within or outside Namibia; and

 to remove any mineral or group of mineral for purpose of sale or disposal from any
place where it was found or incidentally won in the course of the prospecting
operation and to sell or otherwise dispose any such mineral or group of minerals.

The holder of EPL who has removed any mineral or group of minerals other than a control
mineral or any sample of such mineral or group of minerals from the place where it was
found for any purpose other than for sale or disposal to any place within Namibia shall
inform the Commissioner in writing of such removal not later than 14 days or such longer
period as the Commissions may allow after such removal and provide particulars of the
nature of such sample, mineral or group of minerals and the place to which it has been so
removed.

The holder of EPL is further entitled to carry on such other operation including the erection
or construction of accessory works as may be reasonable necessary for prospecting
operation or for the selling or disposal of mineral or group of minerals found or incidentally
won in the course of prospecting operation. The accessory work shall not be erected or
constructed without the prior permission in writing of the Commissioner. On the other hand,
the Commissioner shall not grant permission to erect accessory work unless the holder of
the EPL has paid compensation to the owner of the private land covered by the EPL.

The holder of EPL is required to exercise his right reasonably and in such a manner that the
rights and interest of the owners of the land to which the Licence relates are not adversely
affected except to the extent to which such owners is compensated. Furthermore the holder
of the EPL is required to carry on the prospecting operation in accordance with good
prospecting practices and to take all reasonable steps necessary to secure the safety,
welfare and health of person employed in the licensed area and to prevent or minimize any
pollution of the environment; to maintain in good condition and repair all accessory works in
the licensed area; to remove from such area all structure, equipment and other goods not
used or intended to be used in connection with the prospecting operation; and to take
reasonable steps to warn persons who may from time to time be in the vicinity of any
accessory work of the possible hazard resulting there from.



13 | P a g e

The holder of an EPL is required, to give the Commissioner notice of within 30 days of
discovery of any mineral or group of minerals other than a mineral or group of minerals to
which the Licence relates. Furthermore if the holder of EPL is a company, it is required to
give the Commissioner notice of any change of the name of the company, the registered
address and principal place of business of the company in Namibia, the directors of the
company, the particulars of the beneficiary who owns more than 5% of the share issued by
such company.

The holder of EPL, is required to carry on within a particular period in accordance with the
work program, prospecting operation or to expend certain expenditures and shall furnish the
Commissioner with the particulars of the prospecting operations, either operation or
expenditure.

The EPL is granted for a period not exceeding 3 years and may be renewed for a further
period not exceeding 2 years at a time. The EPL cannot be renewed on more than two
occasions unless the Minister deems it desirable in the interest of the development of
mineral resources of Namibia that such licence be renewed it any particular case on a third
or subsequent occasion.

The holder of an EPL is required to keep an address in Namibia in relation to the location
and result of all photo-geological studies, imaging, geological mapping, geochemical
sampling, geophysical surveying, drilling, pitting and trenching, sampling and bulk sampling
carried within the licensed area. He is further required to keep the results of all analytical,
meteorological, and mineralogical work incidental to the prospecting operation. The record
must also incorporate the interpretation and assessment of studies and survey.

The holder of EPL is required to keep the record of employees, the nature, mass, volume
and value of minerals produced, the expenses incurred in the course of such operation and
such other work as may be determined by the Mining Commissioner.

The holder of EPL is further required to prepare and maintain at all times plans and maps in
respect of the prospecting area. He is further required to prepare a statement of income
and expenditure and such other financial statements as a Commissioner may determine.
Such financial statement shall be submitted to the Commissioner within 30 days after the
end of each quarter during the currency of the EPL. Within 60 days of the end of the
currency of the terms of the licence or together with a renewal application report or reports
must be submitted to the Commissioner setting out an evaluation of the prospect of the
discovery of any mineral or group of minerals in such prospecting area, all information
including photographs, tabulation, tapes and discs the records to be kept and including
plans and maps the report must also deal with the nature, mass or volume and value of any
mineral group or minerals sold or otherwise disposed.

Should the EPL be cancelled or expired, the holder is required within one month of such
cancellation or expiry to deliver to the Commissioner all records, maps, plans, reports,
photographs, tabulation, tapes and disc prepared by the house in the course of the
prospecting operation. Failure to do so amounts to an offence. The Commissioner is also
afforded powers to enter and search and seize such information.

The primary licence, at this stage of the project activities for the Ondundu Project, is the EPL
and the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) submitted to the MME to cover existing
exploration plans.



14 | P a g e

Other permits and/or licences may be required for activities beyond the current exploration
work ongoing at the Ondundu project.

In order for Angus to meet its required obligations under the letter agreement dated May 6,
2010 and amended May 31, 2010, Angus must spend a minimum of US$5 million in
exploration expenditures on EPL 3195 on or before November 6, 2011.

4.5 Current Tenure

EPL 3195 is registered to OM and was renewed on the 18th January 2010 for the period
from 31st May 2009 to 29th May 2011 in terms of the Minerals (Prospecting and Mining)
Act, 33 of 1992. The "granted" status of the EPL entitles Westport to carry on prospecting
operations in respect of such mineral or group of minerals specified in the licence. The
holder of the EPL is further entitled to remove any mineral or group of minerals other than a
control mineral or sample of such mineral or group of minerals for any purpose other than
sale or disposal, found or incidentally won in the course of the prospecting operation to any
other place within Namibia.

4.6 Environmental Liabilities

Historic small scale gold production has occurred within the central portion of the Project
and several workings remain open. Because of the small scale representing a very modest
footprint and historical nature of the workings, the Author has been advised by Westport that
there are no historical environmental liabilities for Westport on the Ondundu Project.

4.7 Royalties

The Author is unaware of any royalties, agreements or other encumbrances to third parties
other than the potential of a 1% NSR on gold production granted to Westport should
Golconda elect to earn a 75% interest in the Ondundu project.

Section 114 of the Minerals Act, 1992 makes provision for royalties to be payable on the
market value of minerals won or mined in Namibia, none of which royalties may exceed 5%
in the case of minerals other than precious stones and dimension stone.

Section 114 contains detailed provisions in terms whereof the Minister is required to consult
and take into account representations by the person affected by such royalties. In terms of
Section 114, royalties become payable only after the Minister has: (i) given a general notice
in the Government Gazette specifying the royalty; (ii) has given a notice of intention to levy
the royalty to the person on whom the royalty is to be imposed; (iii) has afforded the person
affected a right to make representations; and (iv) has thereafter raised the royalty by giving
written notice to the person. In terms of Government Notice 248 (GN 248), as published in
Government Gazette 3322 on 15 November 2004, the Minister has levied a royalty of 5
percent in respect of the nuclear fuels minerals group. Although it appears that GN 248 may
not be in compliance with the requirements of section 114 of the Minerals Act, 1992, it may
be expected that the Minister of Mines & Energy (MME) intends to charge a 5 percent
royalty on nuclear fuels and the Minister can simply rectify GN 248. The MME is currently in
consultation with advisers and/or experts on the matter from South Africa, where the same
issue is also under consideration. The Qualified Person notes that as of the 1st November
2006 the government gazette set the royalty tax at 2.0%.

4.8 Mineralized Zones

The historical prospectivity of the Ondundu Project consists of two zones; Ondundu Main
zone ("OMZ") where mining, (alluvial, open-pit and underground) was carried out for Au, and
a Cu zone located north of Ondundu Main zone (OD6 grid) towards the centre of the
Ondundu anticline, separated by a pronounced East-West trending fault immediately north
of the gold workings.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY

The Ondundu project site is accessed by driving 242 km on paved road from the capital city
of Windhoek to the town of Omaruru. A dirt road leads for 104 km from Omaruru to the
project site (Figure 5-1). The total driving time from Windhoek is 3 1/2 hours. The main
Ruacana to Windhoek electrical 220KV power line runs 15 km to the east of the EPL area.

The area is characterized by undulating to hilly topography created by a succession of
repetitive argillaceous and arenaceous geology, partially dissected by ephemeral streams.
The Main drainages flow NW, while secondary drainages flow NS, following bedding planes.
The drainage net eventually feeds the modern Ugab River. The highest point is the Zebra
Berg at 1,172 metres a.m.s.l., in the core of the antiform, 2.5km to the north of the Ondundu
Main Zone. Average elevation of the property is 1,000 metres a.m.s.l.

The annual rainfall is moderate to low (+100 - 150mm per annum), and consequently the
vegetation is moderately sparse and predominantly colospermum mopane forest, acacia
thorn and grassland of the savanna/bushveld biome. Information from water boreholes
suggest that the water table resides at about 25m below surface. Due to this climate, natural
re-vegetation takes a considerable time. It may be noticed that 30 year old grid lines are still
clear of trees and bush.

6 HISTORY

The Ondundu Au deposit was discovered during 1917. Claims were first staked in 1922 and
a minor gold rush began. Initial production began on alluvial and eluvial workings, with some
11,600 Oz Au reported from 1923 to 1945.

Surface and underground mining in four areas: Margarethental (3,400 ozs), Geolex North
(500ozs), Chiquita (1,500 ozs), Geolex South/Razorback (2,850 ozs). Apart from the
underground workings in the Margarethental and Geolex South areas, past mining activities
appear to have been confined to open cuts and trenches on the hillside.

Intermittent underground mining and alluvial recovery took place until 1945. Some 20,000
ozs Au were reported recovered in total. This is likely an underestimate due to the 15%
royalties required by law.

In 1946, 378 samples from 5 shafts (~6,000 tonnes) were submitted for metallurgical testing.
It was concluded that a recovery of 70% may be anticipated by amalgamation; the economic
degree of grinding will be approximately 60% minus 200mesh for the extraction of 98% of
the total gold.

In the 1980s, Tsumeb Corporation Limited ("TCL") and Goldfields Namibia ("GFN") carried
out exploration programmes in the area under Mineral Deposit Retention Licence 1552,
(MDRL 1552, following the consolidation of the claims into one licence), completing 28
diamond drill holes in the OMZ totalling 5,583 metres. The TCL/GFN Ondundu data are the
most complete and extensive available. The 5,538m of drilling occurred on 12 sections on
the Ondundu Main Zone (Margarethental, Razorback and Geolex South). Surface and
underground sampling and mapping was conducted to establish a selective mining thesis
once GFN became involved with the project by 1985 and this included more extensive work
over the old Copper/Gold workings to the north in the OD6 grid area.

The aim of the TCL exploration programme was to test the historically generated grades
achieved prior to 1983 (Carter and Venter).

Mill head grade (Margarenthental, 1939) 9.8g/t

Surface sampling (Storey, 1946) 10.56g/t

Bulk sampling: 6000 tons quartz (Thomas, 1932) 13.95g/t

Metallurgical test results (Veicht, 1946) 7.45g/t

Mean intersected grade (current (1983) drilling) 8.53g/t

Current (1983) sampling 7.71g/t

Following the consolidation of mineral licences, which to date had been operated as
individual mining claims by various holders, TCL drilled 19 holes before the first historic
mineral resource estimate was produced by Venter and Carter in June 1983, and followed
by another five holes southwards towards Razorback by 1985 when Goldfields commenced
with the takeover of TCL. Goldfields introduced their own geological team to re-evaluate the
deposit on a selective underground mining basis and drilled another three diamond drill
holes following an elaborate underground sampling program aimed at establishing a
selective mining thesis focused at the quartz veins. Two reverse circulation (RC) holes were



19 | P a g e

drilled by TCL in 1985 but the results were inconclusive as the sample recoveries were only
60%.

Table 6-1: EPL3195 Ondundu Summary of TCL Diamond Drillhole Assay Results
(Westport Resources Namibia)

TCL used the mineralogists in Johannesburg (namely Dr Lauenstein) and a laboratory Israel
in 1982 to determine the temperature of formation of the quartz and carbonate veins setting
the temperatures at +400°C and 350-400°C respectively (Worthington, 1981), concluding an
epithermal genesis. Yet the authors thereafter constrained the deposit to being a product of
metamorphic dewatering of turbidite sequences where temperatures of around 230°C can
be inferred from the lower greenschist grade of metamorphism due to the absence of
conclusive evidence of a heat source.

In 1983 a historic resource estimate of 42 million tonnes grading 0.39 gram gold per tonne
was produced by TCL ("Venter & Carter"), in 1987 a historic resource of 4.57 million tonnes
grading 3.39 grams gold per tonne was reported by GFN (Charles September 1987) and in
1989 a historic resource of 4.35 million tonnes grading 3.19 grams gold per tonne was
reported by GFN (Charles December 1988). These resources are historical and not
compliant with National Instrument 43-101 reporting standards; however they are
considered material to the prospectivity of the Ondundu gold project. A "qualified person" for
the purposes of NI 43-101 has not done sufficient work to qualify the historical estimate as
current mineral resources or mineral reserves. The historical estimates should not be
treated as current mineral resources or mineral reserves and the historical estimates
contained herein should not be relied upon.

ONDUNDU HISTORICAL RESOURCE COMPARISON

grade in all
estimates

This 'resource' summary has been derived from legacy reports and does not conform to
current CIM standards with respect to resource statements. The drill hole spacing is too
widely spaced to demonstrate strike continuity. In addition, the selective nature of the
sampling technique allied to the coarse gold nature of much of the quartz vein mineralization
means that reliable assay results are very difficult to achieve.

The use of 1 g/t Au cut-off was used by GFN in 1987 reflecting the economic limit at the
time.

The ground lay dormant until 1996, when a joint venture between Keadeber Resources (Pty)
Ltd, (75%) and Southern Cross Exploration (25%) proposed to explore further under MDRL
1552. No significant verifiable work was done, apart from a bulk (600kg) sample that was
submitted to MINTEK (RSA) in 1999 and a summary report was written. The 600kg of 'gold
ore' was sampled at Ondundu and delivered to Mintek Laboratories in Johannesburg to the
mineral processing division. The sample was originally crushed to -1mm in a jaw crusher
and blended. Sub-samples were taken and submitted for sizing analysis. Each sample was
assayed for Au to determine the distribution of the gold in the various size ranges.

A representative sample was removed for shaking table tests and then a fine band of heavy
concentrate was collected, with remaining feed reporting to the tails. Tails were dried,
weighed and milled and passed over the shaking table again.

It was reported that the size for liberation is that between 212 µm and 108 µm. The sizing
distribution analysis indicates that the gold occurs predominantly in the coarser size ranges,
i.e.+250µm. Approximately 11% of the gold occurs in the -25µm. The fine gold (such as that
in the -25µm) is considered to be amenable to recovery by leaching method.

After the 1999 work program, MDRL 1552 was allowed to lapse. EPL 3195 was awarded to
Omajete Mining in 2003. On June 8, 2005 Westport Resources Namibia (Pty) Ltd. was
granted an initial 32% interest in Omajete Mining and in October 2007 Westport acquired
100% Omajete Mining ("OM").

TCL & GFN accumulated a considerable legacy database, with maps and reports that have
recently been integrated into the company's data base for modeling purposes. Spatial data

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

7.1 Regional Geology

Ondundu is situated in the Outjo Zone (Swakop Group) of the upper Proterozoic Pan African
Damara Orogen, occupying the palaeo-eugeosynclinal facies of the southern Congo-Kasai
Craton margin, to the immediate south of the Otavi Platform.

Closure of the neo-Proterozoic Adamaster Ocean during the final assembly of west
Gondwana, followed by continent-continent collision with incipient subduction resulting in
widespread orogenesis. Crustal shortening resulted in regional metamorphism, deformation
and anatexis (Figure 7-1 and Figure 7-2). A least 2 phases of deformation have affected the
Outjo Zone. Metamorphism reached lower greenschist facies.

Figure 7-2: Ondundu Regional Geology
(Westport Resources Namibia after Southern Cross NL)

Structure and metamorphism



25 | P a g e

Structure

Two deformation events, D1 and D2 have resulted in regional scale folding. N-S
compression resulted from the Kalahari/Congo-Kasai collision and E-W transpression from
the Brasiliano event.

Folding

Regional

The primary fold structure on the property is a domal low amplitude to wavelength ratio
antiform with disharmonic parasitic-drag folds developed near the hinge, east of the axis.

The antiform is asymmetric-parallel, the western limb dipping 30°/280°TN and the
eastern limb 50°/090°TN. The axis trends ~185°TN and plunges ~30° to the south. The
fold is south vergent. Axial planar S1 is present, trending 160º-180 ºTN and dipping 80 -
90 º west in sandstone and 30ºwest in argillaceous beds.

Local Property

The parasitic synform-antiform couple share a common limb. Their axes vary between
176°-182°TN and plunge 20°-33°south, roughly parallel to the axis of the Ondundu
antiform and coincide with the regional orientation of S1. The superimposed local folding
has a poorly developed fracture cleavage, S2, axial planar. The common limb straddles
a sinistral shear and displays drag-induced stretching and boudinage.

Smaller-scale folding is frequently found. Disharmonic or asymmetric folding of quartz-
carbonate veins in fold noses illustrates the competency contrast between veins and
their host rocks. Drag folds are also common in the OMZ.

Faulting

There are two frequently displayed brittle fault orientations; EW and NS, with a third,
possibly conjugate 050º-320ºTN set.

The Margarethental Fault Zone (MFZ), bounds the OMZ to the north.

The MFZ, while apparently a normal fault, has a component of strike-slip. It has displaced
the parasitic folds >100m dextrally. Immediately north of the MFZ, the folds are drastically
attenuated. The MFZ dips ~80°/000°TN in the vicinity of the OMZ.

The MFZ is concealed beneath alluvium and regolith. Trenching in the 1980's exposed it as
a +1m wide chloritised mylonite (cataclastite). Resistivity and VLF surveys suggested a
300+m down-throw to the south.

Given its proximity to the Waterberg thrust, it is worth considering that the MFZ may be a
failed thrust splay, reactivated as a normal fault. Essentially its later movements seem that
of an oblique wrench fault.

North-south directed faulting is largely confined to the hinge zone of the OA. Two main NS
faults, apparently reverse faults during deformation, displace the local fold structures. They



26 | P a g e

have a left-lateral sense of movement. Bounding fractures to the east and west of the OMZ
have been exploited by dolerite and lamprophyre dykes.

Notably these fractures, while having sinistral shear sense are mostly unmineralized.
Possibly silicification of the OMZ rendered it competent enough that when fractures were
reactivated in a brittle rheologic regime, they behaved as normal faults.

Shearing

Shearing on the property is best demonstrated in the hinge-zone of the OA. In the OMZ, a
sinistral shear zone, approximately 50m wide, infests the common limb of the
synform/antiform. Stretching, boudinage and intense shearing in fine-grained lithologies
typify the deformation found in the zone.

Two lesser shear zones bracket the common limb shear, both having a sinistral sense,
though with nominal displacements. Together they are an enechelon shear set, and fairly
confine Au mineralisation to a 1500m wide corridor. The southern end of the OMZ sees
these features converging.

Cleavage & foliation

A strongly developed axial planar cleavage is developed in the fine-grained lithologies.
Foliation is displayed to a greater or lesser degree.

Jointing

Three joint sets are commonly observed in the OMZ. Axial planar and bedding concordant
joints are best expressed with a third set EW oriented but not as well developed.

7.2 Property geology

Stratigraphy

Neo-Proterozoic Kuiseb Formation rocks of the Upper Swakop Group has been inferred to
outcrop over much of EPL 3195 as a monotonous succession of argillaceous and
arenaceous lithologies.

Depositional setting and lithologies

A sequence of interbedded upward-fining sandstones, arkose, siltstones, mudstones, shales
and minor carbonates, derived from turbidite deposition into a basin repository are the
dominant rock types, with units often grading into one another or intimately intercalated but
are overall prograding successions. A volcanoclastic component is present.

The Swakop Group in the nCZ/SCZ is thought to be on the order of a 9,800metre
succession.

Sandstones

Units of sandstone are metre scale in thickness and fairly continuous, weathering positively
to form distinct ridges which may be followed considerable distances along strike. They are
grey-green on fresh surfaces, weathering to orange-brown due to limonite after sulphides.



27 | P a g e

Compositions range from almost pure quartz sandstone to more micaceous and feldspathic
and with increasing volcanoclastic components, arkosic. They are mainly medium-grained
and commonly calcareous.

Sedimentary features have not been completely obliterated during metamorphism. Load
casts, ripple casts, slumping and cross-bedding are commonly visible in outcrop.

Alteration minerals include hematite, limonite, sulphides, serecite, chlorite and siderite,
leaving "spotty" iron-stained weathering surfaces.

Jointing, axial planar cleavage, foliation and brittle shearing are noted in the field.

Siltstone-mudstone-shale

The finer-grained rocks weather negatively and are much less conspicuous in outcrop.
Fresh surfaces are grey-grey-green to black with brown-rust weathering colours. Graded
bedding and alternating bands of coarse-fine are common.

Sedimentary features include load-casts and fluting where sandstone is present.

Alteration minerals are less common in the fine-grained, less permeable rocks.
Carbonaceous shales often have a high sulphide content (possibly diagenetic).

These more fissile rocks are most likely to host concordant, (bedding parallel), quartz veins.

Intrusives

Karroo-age Diabase dykes and sills intrude the Kuiseb Fm. metasediments. Fine-grained
green-black on fresh surfaces, they weather to brown rounded boulders "cannon balls".

They were emplaced mainly along NS and NE-SW directions.

Lamprophyre dykes are noted, intruding along generally EW fractures.

8 DEPOSIT TYPE

The regional setting of the Ondundu Project is imbued with all the elements of structure,
intrusive character, and original volcaniclastic geology interfingered with arenaceous and
argillaceous rocks that within the orogenic formation and subsequent tectonic evolution that
would yield a variety of epithermal suites of deposits. Gold deposition is favourable during
the extensional and compressional-collision phases of the orogenic evolution. Minor gold
mineralisation is present in the massive sulphide deposits of the Matchless Amphibolite Belt,
emplaced during the extensional phase. The compressional-collision phase was
characterised by deformation, metamorphism and granitic igneous activity. Gold deposits
that formed during this stage include gold associated with thrust zones; turbidite-hosted
gold; and marble and calc-silicate-hosted gold. The genesis of these gold deposits is related
to episodes of hydrothermal fluid generation during tectonism, metamorphism and magmatic
activity.

The primary exploration targets on the Ondundu Project belong to a class of hydrothermal
gold deposits that are orogenic in nature and occur within structural folds of sediments.



28 | P a g e

Mineralization occurs as saddle reefs and as discordant veins and stockworks,
predominately in anticlinal domes. Structural, lithologic, and temporal trends that encompass
large scale Phanerozoic slate belt gold deposits are evident on the Ondundu Project.

Typical examples of the deposit model that have similar tectonic and lithological
characteristics, as well as exploration challenges are discussed below:

8.1 Quartz Vein Hosted Gold Mineralisation Victoria, Australia

The gold deposits have generally been regarded as genetically related to the various suites
of granitic intrusives. In some gold quartz vein hosted deposits close to granitic intrusives
accessory minerals include wolframite, molybdenite, bismuth which are typically associated
with granites. Other deposits are distal, up to 29km from known granite intrusions. The gold
fields are not zonally distributed in relation to the granite outcrops. The deposits are also
characterised by a strong north-south or meridianal regional trend to the gold mineralisation.

The quartz veins follow the folding of the sedimentary rocks and are generally regarded as
contemporaneous with the granite intrusives. As some of the auriferous quartz veins are at
some distance from known intrusives it is considered that this particular style of
mineralisation could be formed by remobilisation of quartz and gold from within the
sedimentary pile.

The several different veins types, mineral associations and different ages of the host rocks
in these deposits suggest that several different periods of gold mineralisation may have
occurred.

The age of the major deposits in the Bendigo-Ballarat sub-province is not clear. They occur
particularly in sediments which have been subjected to later folding. The gold deposits have
generally been regarded as being associated with the later intrusives. Opinion is divided
between a contemporaneous folding and mineralising event and an earlier mineralising
event which has been subsequently deformed by later folding event. The quartz veins
exhibit a great variety in geometry and each deposit is often characterised by a particular
vein type. The structures developed probably relates to the intensity of the deformation and
the relative amounts of the different lithologies present in the sequence.

Gold was first discovered at Clunes, Castlemaine and Warrandyte in mid-1851. The ensuing
gold rush over the next 60 years and production of approximately 2500 tonnes of gold
places Victoria amongst the world's major gold provinces. Total Victorian gold production
still represents 32% of all gold mined in Australia, and 2% of all gold mined in the world.
About 40% of gold production, as well as small quantities of antimony and silver, came from
Palaeozoic quartz veins, while the remainder came from Cainozoic placer deposits.

8.2 Bendigo

Gold mineralisation in Victoria is chiefly associated with structurally controlled quartz veins
in deformed lower Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks. The bulk of gold production has been from
the west of the state across the Stawell, Bendigo and Melbourne Zones. The most
prospective gold mining and exploration targets occur in these areas and are all structurally
controlled. They include:

 slate belt/turbidite hosted lode gold (e.g. Bendigo, Ballarat),



29 | P a g e

 volcanic associated gold (e.g. Stawell), and

 sedimentary hosted disseminated gold (e.g. Fosterville).

Geological Setting

Bendigo is the largest goldfield in Victoria with orogenic or 'reef' mines producing 17 million
ounces (529 t) of gold and placer mines producing 5 million ounces (155 t) of gold. It has a
strike length of approximately 17 km, is up to 4 km wide and is remarkable for its regular
trains of chevron folds that have controlled the distribution and geometry of mineralisation.
Most gold came from the hinge zones and east-dipping limbs of three anticlines, the Garden
Gully, New Chum and Hustlers 'lines', however, significant gold was also mined from other
adjacent anticlines. Domal culminations along the main anticlines tend to correspond with
well-mineralised portions of the folds. Mineralisation is mostly in west- and east-dipping
reverse faults which truncate fold hinges. The famous saddle reefs are composite fault
structures controlled by thick, competent sandstone beds. They range from simply folded
bedding-concordant veins through to complex structures involving the interaction of limb
thrusts, fold hinges and bedding-concordant veins.

The gold endowment of the Bendigo Goldfield has attracted numerous mining companies to
the area. Exploration programs aimed at discovering similar styles of mineralisation have
focused on either extensions to known mineralisation at depth or along strike to the north
beneath shallow transported cover of the Murray Basin. Bendigo Mining have been
successful in identifying repetitions of the rich Deborah and Sheepshead lines at depth and
are currently in development. To date limited exploration under cover has failed to locate
any significant new gold occurrences. The use of geophysical and sophisticated
geochemical techniques are now viewed as essential for locating another Bendigo-style
deposit. Such techniques might be used to target favourable structural settings or zones of
alteration.

The geological modelling of the Ballarat field has identified numerous locations where
favourable sites for gold mineralisation exists. Whilst there is still a risk, that not all of the
identified sites will have formed economic gold deposits, BGF believe that the majority of
them will. In deriving its exploration potential BGF has accounted for the risk that not all of
the potential sites for gold mineralisation will in fact contain economic quantities of gold.

At Ballarat there are three regional anticlinoria each of which coincide with a goldfield-
Ballarat East, Ballarat West and Little Bendigo. The most productive line, the First Chance
Anticline at Ballarat East, has in recent times been the focus of several mining
developments both at surface and at depth. In the mid 1990s William Australia NL mined
several small near surface supergene deposits for a total of 346 kg of gold. Ballarat
Goldfields NL defined an inferred resource of 3.3 Mt at 9.5 g/t gold beneath old workings to
depths between 350-700 m. An access decline was commenced and had traversed 1 km
(140 m deep) prior to operations being suspended in early 2000. Exploration potential exists
for discovering new orogenic gold mineralisation beneath historic production centres and
beneath shallow Cainozoic basaltic cover to the north and south of Ballarat.

Mining of the quartz hosted gold deposits was much less extensive over the Ballarat area
than the shallow alluvial gold deposits, partly due to a relatively poor understanding of how
the quartz hosted gold deposits formed. Regional mapping and modelling of the geology in
3D has enabled geologists at BGF to identify where and how the historically mined quartz



30 | P a g e

deposits formed. This interpretation is the foundation from which the BGF's exploration
targets and ongoing exploration strategy is based.

In summary, the underlying rocks at Ballarat are a series of sands silts and muds that
originally formed on a sea floor. As the sands, silts and muds became progressively buried
they eventually consolidated into sandstones, siltstones and mudstones (Stage 1).

Well after their original formation, compressive forces on the rocks at depth forced them to
buckle and fold. Further compression, resulted in the rocks becoming very tightly folded. As
the rocks continued to buckle and fold, each layer was forced to slide at its contact with the
adjacent layer of rock to allow the folding to take place. This movement initiated the creation
of shear zones which are parallel to the contacts between the sandstones and mudstones
(Stage 2). Further compression again, eventually forced the rocks to break forming faults
which thrust the rocks from the west side above the rocks to its immediate east. These
faults, are known locally at Ballarat as "leatherjacket" faults (Stage 2).

The deposition of gold is interpreted to be one of the last events having a significant impact
of the underlying rocks at Ballarat. At the end of the compressive events described above,
the rocks relaxed and opened up slightly, allowing for the introduction of gold bearing fluids
throughout the rocks at Ballarat (Stage 3). Areas which formed open spaces during this
event were most favourable for gold to come out of solution and precipitate out as either fine
particles or coarse concentrations (nuggets) of gold. There are a number of specific
locations during this event which were favourable for the gold to precipitate. These locations
have been identified by BGF geologists as the vertical structures that developed between
the sandstones and mudstones, and also at the intersection of the vertical structures and
the "leatherjacket" faults (Stage 4).

The geological modelling of the Ballarat field has identified numerous locations where
favourable sites for gold mineralisation exists. Whilst there is still a risk, that not all of the
identified sites will have formed economic gold deposits, BGF believe that the majority of
them will. In deriving its exploration potential BGF has accounted for the risk that not all of
the potential sites for gold mineralisation will in fact contain economic quantities of gold.

8.3 Stawell

The bulk of recent Victorian gold production has come from the Stawell Goldfield, the source
of 2.5 million ounces (78 t) of orogenic gold and 0.7 million ounces (24 t) of placer gold with
reserves in the order of 4.6 million ounces. The main (Magdala-style) mineralisation is in
ductile–brittle reverse shear zones related to movement on the Stawell Fault. Mineralisation
at the Magdala deposit has been divided into two systems:

Central Lode system where gold is concentrated in high-strain zones at the contact between
competent Magdala Volcanics (tholeiitic basalt lava) and less competent metasedimentary
rocks, and

Scotchmans (or Hangingwall) lodes which overprint the Central Lode along master faults
and duplex faults defined by laminated reefs and flat 'makes'.

The subordinate Wonga deposit is located within the aureole of the Early Devonian Stawell
Granite. Here mineralisation is controlled by east-dipping reverse shears within more



31 | P a g e

massive quartz reefs. The orientation and timing of the Wonga lodes is now believed to
relate to a syn-intrusive phase of mineralisation.

Important elements in a simplified exploration model of the Magdala mineralisation include:

 Tholeiitic basalt domes,

 Sulphidic volcanogenic rocks,

 D4 fault structures (northwest trending, west-dipping reverse faults), and

 Pyrrhotite-stilpnomelane-biotite alteration.

The close relationship between tholeiitic basalt domes and Magdala-style gold
mineralisation has enabled Stawell Gold Mines to target similar styles of mineralisation up to
100 km north along the Stawell Corridor (the area bounded by the Moyston and Coongee
Faults) using geophysics. Detailed magnetics combined with follow-up aircore drilling has
been successfully utilised in exploring for similar gold targets beneath shallow Murray Basin
cover sediments.

8.4 Fosterville

Mineralisation at Fosterville is distinct from Bendigo and Stawell style mineralisation in that
gold is hosted within sulphides disseminated in sandstone. Although not a major producer
by Victorian standards, the bulk of the 0.25 million ounces (8 t) of gold production from the
goldfield has occurred from recent post-1982 discoveries and highlights the potential of
smaller 'forgotten fields' for the modern explorer.

At Fosterville fine grained gold occurs as inclusions in arsenopyrite and pyrite closely
associated with unmineralised quartz–carbonate stockwork veins. The stockwork veins have
developed along a steep west-dipping reverse fault set which has interacted with fold hinges
and favourable rock types to produce dilatant structures surrounded by mineralisation.

Two main fault lines are recognised - Fosterville Fault, mineralised over 7 km, and O'Dwyers
Fault mineralised over 3 km. Recent work on the controls of mineralisation have
emphasised the importance of:

 Steeply west-dipping rock sequence containing black shale on the eastern limb of a
syncline;

 Bedding parallel faulting (Fosterville Fault) along the black shale unit;

 Splay faults which propagate into the footwall across the smaller synclinal fold hinge;

 Vertical repetitions of the splays at depth; and

 Lithological contrast between sandstones which provide a porous brittle host and
siltstones which restrict or cap the mineralising fluid.

The position of the Fosterville and O'Dwyers Faults (the latter intruded by rhyolite dykes)
can be traced using bedrock geochemistry. This approach has enabled the faults to be



32 | P a g e

located both at surface and beneath cover to the north and south. Threshold values of 100
ppb gold and 100 ppm arsenic currently outline known deposits with antimony also used as
a pathfinder element. Induced polarisation surveys have also been used to define the
position of the faults and associated sulphide concentrations. Potential exists for discoveries
both along strike under cover and in parallel structures to the east and west.

8.5 Castlemaine

It is clear that the poor historical mining outcomes of a number of mines can be attributed to
inadequate geological understanding of the major structural controls on gold mineralization.
Overuse of the Bendigo Saddle Reef model saw the failure of numerous attempts to develop
the field at depth and the loss of confidence in the overall field. Saddle Reefs were a
relatively small proportion of the goldfields past production compared to near surface spur
and laminated quartz veins. It is conclusive that the west-dipping faults are the main
plumbing control for gold in the Goldfield (Figure 8-1).

They are not always continuous, and can commonly step in an en echelon manner when
bedded. The intersection of West and East dipping faults is often a focus for the greatest
structural dilation and thus greater quartz reef volumes.

The mineralisation model developed to explore the Castlemaine Goldfield is shown in the
block diagram below. Within this model stacked sets of West-dipping faults and fault splays
with associated gold-bearing quartz veins and breccias are collectively referred to as "fault
reef" lodes. These lodes are staggered within the west dipping fault planes due to the acute
angle of these faults to the North trending folding. The best lodes are developed where the
fault breaches the eastern fold limb. Repetition of reef lodes can occur across adjacent
anticline folds both along strike and down dip. This model suggests that when discovered,
the lodes are likely to be discrete and well defined in geometry and that it is possible to have
a number of deposits located within relative proximity to each other.

The Wattle Gully mineralisation is a classic example of a "fault reef" lode and the model
explains why prospecting to depth in the vertical plane adjacent to the anticline commonly
failed in the Castlemaine Goldfield. A number of examples exist, such as the Quartz Hill and
Ajax mines, which although highly successful at shallow depths failed to prosper at greater
depths.

The major geological conclusions and outcomes of this period of study were:-

 The gross stratigraphic plunge is shallow towards the North, however;

 Local plunge reversals, which are important to gold mineralisation, exist, and are
short lived at regional scales.

 The regional fold axes locations are now accurately defined in 3 dimensions.

 East-dipping faults generally strike slightly West of North and West-dipping faults
strike slightly East of North.

 Approximately 50% of Castlemaine mines were developed on East-dipping "bedded"

 faults, although nearly all these have a nearby major West-dipping fault.



33 | P a g e

 The Francis Ormond Fault is a major Westdipping fault with similar displacement to

 the Wattle Gully fault which hosts gold mineralisation at that mine. This fault has now
been linked between a number of mines over a distance of 1.4km.

 It is possible that the Francis Ormond and Wattle Gully Faults are part of the same
fault system – and even connected.

 Two newly defined West-dipping faults the Fiddlers and Englishman's Faults, are
interpreted at Castlemaine North.

Extensions to the following major fluid controlling West-Dipping Faults:- Cemetery, Burns
Hill, McDermott's, Francis Ormond, Milliken's have been postulated or proven.

A deeper understanding of the mining and investment environment since the 1850's has
been gained. This information has been important in defining why the mines at Castlemaine
were not developed to greater depths such as elsewhere in Victoria during the same period.

9 MINERALISATION

Gold mineralization found by Westport and previous operators on the Ondundu property is
confined to the quartz-carbonate veins and within the country meta-sedimentary country
rocks. Mineralization confined to semi-conformable silicified zones within metasediments is
located in the central portion of EPL 3195 known as the Ondundu Main Zone ("OMZ").
Copper, plus gold mineralization has also been identified in the northern portion of EPL
3195 where fractures have acted as conduits for secondary Cu minerals (malachite,
chrysocolla, azurite and cuprite) within an area known as OD6 "Zebraberg".



34 | P a g e

9.1 Ondundu Main Zone (OMZ) Au quartz-carbonate veins

Historical work including 28 diamond drill holes totalling 5,583 metres completed in the
1980s and 11 shallow diamond drill holes totalling 547.7 metres completed by Westport in
2006 targeted the OMZ. Higher grade values are associated with quartz carbonate vein
(Figure 9-1), while lower grade values are associated with the surrounding metasedimentary
host.

Figure 9-1: Conformable Quartz Carbonate Vein Hole OD038

Drilling has tested a 1.5 km by 200-300 metre wide area of a 2.7 km by 200-300 metres
area of mineralization identified by surface mapping, historic workings and sampling within
the OMZ.

Width of the OMZ mineralization is variable along strike with intersection widths 100 and
250m and most likely controlled by structural buckle in a ductile phase later being exploited
by epithermal fluidization pulses. There however does seem to be a stratigraphic connect
(seen from historic workings) between the northern portion of the OMZ and the Carr veins
immediately to the east (Figure 9-2). Due to the plunge of the deposit this was never drill
tested.



35 | P a g e

Figure 9-2: EPL3195 – OMZ Schematic Surface Geology and Prospectivity



36 | P a g e

Ground spectrometry and hyperspectral data (Figure 9-3) further supports that the
mineralisation is wide spread within the turbidite sequence and that further potential exists to
the north of the Margarethental fault traditionally viewed to be the northern limit but
contradicted by the only hole drilled on the northern side (OD 027 averaging 0.4 g/t over
291m with 83 vein sets bearing gold over and above the lower grade carry of the
metamorphic country host rock).

Figure 9-3: Ondundu Hyperspectral Data
(Westport Resources Namibia)



37 | P a g e

Three types of veins have been recognised in the course of geological mapping:

 The OMZ mineralisation occurs in largely bedding conformable glassy grey laminated
quartz-carbonate veins. They were emplaced syn-techtonically and deformed during
D2

 A set of stockwork-type (en echelon) tension-gash (Ridel) veinlets at high angles to
the N-S shear are a notable component of the mineralisation.

 Undeformed, narrow (1-5cm) E-W oriented quartz veinlets, possibly emplaced during
Karroo times are nominally Au bearing, likely as a result of remobilization.

A third variety of veining, massive barren milky quartz which cross-cut lithologies, are found
in the OMZ. They pinch and swell over short distances and form blows in places. These
veins do not carry any gold mineralization.

Gold is free milling and relatively coarse grained. Accessory minerals include pyrite,
arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, marcasite, siderite, ankerite and limonite. Minor
amounts of sphalerite and galena have been noted.

Temperature of formation for the quartz veins was +400degrees C and 350-400degrees C
for the carbonate veining suggesting an epithermal paragenesis as opposed to metamorphic
dewatering in the lower greenschist facies although such dewatering was probably an initial
remobilization process.

Alteration

The alteration assemblage in the OMZ is primarily:

 Silicification; displayed in quartz blows and cross cutting veins, micro-crystalline
amygdales and adurlaria but determined to be low potential in gold content
(Worthington,1981) a thesis untested to date. These later stage quartzitic
occurrences occur together with remnant magnetite boxworks (now
haematite/limonite) together at times with arsenopyrite further giving credence to
multi-stage epithermal events and not consistent with metamorphic dewatering.

 Sulphidation: expressed in arsenopyrite seen as the main scavenger of gold from the
sediments, pyrite and to a lesser extent chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, marcasite, and minor
amounts of sphalerite. These do not occur as massive sulphide zones and represent
a low sulphidization environment.

 Hematization: seen clearly from the hyperspectral images defines the deposit and
results from the alteration of magnetite and later further to limonite a paragenesis
consistent with the epithermal thesis and is the reason for poor definition of the
deposit through ground magnetic surveys.

 Brecciation: Worthington noted as early as 1981 that breccias blows noted in places
are evidence of hydrothermal events

 Carbonization; Noted as an early and later stage event with ankerite and siderite
closely associated with the gold bearing quartz phases (coarse) and finer fibrillose
veins in the sediments especially down plunge where a syenite body was drilled in
OD28.

In the context of lower greenschist metamorphism where primary sedimentary structures
have been preserved none of these assemblages are consistent a thesis other than multi
stage epithermal events giving rise to the mineralization.

The main gangue minerals are quartz, calcite, hematite, siderite and chlorite.

9.2 Ondundu North Cu/Au (Zebraberg) – OD6 Grid

This area is defined from the Margarethental Fault in the south to the northern extent of the
EPL boundary, which in the south contains faulted out northern extensions to the OMZ Au
deposit, has new hyperspectral ground geophysics anomalies corresponding with historical
works soaked in quartz veining, areas historically mined for Cu/Au, anomalies
corresponding with tourmalinisation, haemetisation, albitisation, sericitisation, metasomatism
and ground geophysical anomalies.

The sheer scale (6kmx4km) of alteration and metasomatism together with known Cu/Au
mineralization, legacy Cu/Au/As soil anomalies, Cu/Au rock chip anomalies, old workings
and mapped breccia bodies corresponding with hyperspectral anomalies and recently
generated VLF anomalies highlights the prospectivity of the northern OD6 area and potential
for a setting differing significantly from the Au only deposit model to the south.



40 | P a g e

The Zebraberg OD6 Grid area is predominantly Cu/Au mineralized, with complex
stratigraphic and structural controls demonstrated.

Brittle EW fractures have acted as conduits for secondary Cu minerals (malachite,
chrysocolla, azurite and cuprite), derived from enriched sedimentary/volcanic units at depth
in the anticlinorium. Up to eighteen breccias blows have been noted in the field, some
containing significant amounts of pyrite in the matrix. Numerous gossans have also been
noted.

Large stratigraphic base metal geochemical anomalies in the core area of the antiform were
delineated by General Mining (1965) and TCL/Goldfields (1980 – 1992) work.

Small scale mining by trenching has been carried out Goldfields in the 1950s, however no
significant ore reserves were defined. Drilling by during the 1980s (5 diamond holes) did not
intersect mineable grades.

Aeromagnetic and radiometric surveys conducted after TCL/GFN work have shown
interesting targets not identified at the time.

Alteration

The alteration assemblage in the OD6 area is primarily intense potassium and sodium
metasomatism, phyllic, propylitic, argillic, silicification, sulphidation, hematization,
carbonization, pyritization and brecciation.

As an area deeper in the anticlinorium It differs markedly from that in the OMZ gold only
area to the south in terms of complexity and intensity of alteration together with more
intrusive bodies, and an intensely altered sandstone unit and more massive sulphide
mineralization. To quote S Galloway "The number of contributory causes including long
lived, probably overlapping (temporally and spatially) hydrothermal systems, regional
metamorphic effects (prograde and/or retrograde) and surficial weathering processes." It
was also more studied for alteration styles by GFN in the late 1980s (Galloway, 1989).

 Metasomatism: Intense Boron metasomatism led to the large scale tourmalinization
and silicification in the area both as a pervasive hypogene stratabound alteration
phenomenon confined to silicious sandstone horizons and at time fracture controlled
but is also encountered as pervasive alteration features in distinct plugs and breccia
pipes. Course tourmalines overprint other mineralogy particularly the limonite rich
zones pointing to secondary remobilization.

Silica-Pyrite-Clay ("Paquatite" for Pyrite, Albite, Quartz, Tourmaline) hydrogen
metasomatism consisting of an extremely fine grained assemblage containing
abundant pyrite expressed strongly in the lower sandstone units and can most likely
be classified as advanced argillic alteration.



41 | P a g e

Albitisation or sodium silica metasomatism is the most widespread and seems to be
invariably associated with dolomitisation. This is an important feature in the sandstones
which host the brown hydrothermal dolomites on the western side of the anticlinal core
(Galloway,1989). It is a common associate with the widespread loci of brecciation in the
northern part. The brecciation is seen to be succeeded by carbonatisation.

 Carbonatisation: commonly associated with albite rich rocks seems to be a common
late stage alteration phase in the sandstones, lamprophyre dykes, mafic plugs and
albitite plugs indicating various phases of introduction.

 Sulphidation is in evidence throughout the area in various minerals (malachite,
chrysocolla, azurite and cuprite and arsenopyrite and pyrite).

 Ferruginization: as a product of both hypogene and supergene processes associated
with both E-W structural controls and stratabound replacement gossans in the
sandstones including dolomite replacement lenses, pyrite blasts in the tourmalinised
sandstones and breccias.

 Other Alteration: recognized in thin section and in the field include muscovite, sericite,
margarite, biotite, fuchsite, chlorite, epidote and serpentinite possibly associated with
both supergene and hypogene (propylitic, argillic and phyllic) alteration processes.

10 EXPLORATION

Exploration work prior to 2005 is included in the History section of the Report.

10.1 Exploration work 2005-2006 conducted by Westport

Confirmation Sampling

In May 2005, Westport completed a verification surface sampling program at the Ondundu
gold project. A total of 156 grab samples were collected from quartz veins exposed along a
2.7 km long ridge that marks the OMZ. Eighty eight samples reported gold in excess of 1.0
g/t gold with the maximum value returning 119.5 g/t gold. Four samples returned no
significant values (Figure 10-1). The initial results confirmed the broad extent and general
tenor of mineralization within the OMZ.

Hyperspectral Survey

In November 2005, Australian based HyVista Corporation was contracted by Westport to
complete an airborne hyperspectral survey over the entire Ondundu project. Hyperspectral
surveys are a no-impact exploration technique for obtaining short wavelength infrared
(SWIR) images of the surface of the earth. The HyMap SWIR scanner owned by HyVista
Corporation was mounted in an aircraft to over-fly target areas at a height of about 2500m,
achieving a spatial resolution of 4.5m. Preliminary inspection of hyperspectral images
revealed the presence of a range of interesting and potentially prospective structural,
lithologic and alteration features worthy of detailed investigation. In view of the above, an
appropriate software was acquired – ENVI Image Analysis Software (ENVI 4.2). This



43 | P a g e

software enables one to visualize, analyze, manipulate and present the recently acquired
hyperspectral data. The program successfully mapped the distribution of white mica and
tourmaline. Alteration assemblages commonly associated with sediment hosted orogenic
deposits are often characterized by Al-poor white mica with a longer wavelength absorption
feature at 2.210 µm (Figure 10-2), Tourmaline is also present near the epithermal-like
deposits, suggesting that it may be an integral part of these systems (Figure 10-3).

Stream Sediment Survey

A regional stream sediment sampling of the entire exclusive prospecting license area- EPL
3195, was deemed necessary by Westport in order to:

 Determine and trace primary sources of copper and gold in the EPL area;

 Determine potential correlation between copper and gold mineralization in the
area; and

 Determine the overall mineral potential of the EPL area and hence identify new
targets for further exploration.

In January to February 2006 a regional stream sediment survey covering the entire
Ondundu Project was initiated. A total of 126 stream sediment samples were collected
from the entire EPL area and sent for analysis for utilizing two size fraction (-1000, +500
microns material and –180 microns material). Samples were mainly collected from first and
second order streams at about 1km spacing between sample sites. Approximately, 12 kg of
-2000 microns material have been collected at each sample site.

These results show some anomalous gold values from two main rivers in the area, which
both seem to drain from the Ondundu main ridge (Figure 10-4). Two assumptions can be
drawn from the position of these anomalous values. The first assumption is to assume that
gold at these points originated from the main ridge and transported downstream with time.
The second assumption is that the gold originates from localized sources and was
introduced in to the main stream by adjoining tributaries.

A follow-up sampling program that targeted small adjoining tributaries feeding the two main
streams upstream of elevated/anomalous gold values points was completed. A total of 53
samples have been processed and steam sediment sampling assay results continue to
reveal substantial gold occurrences in two different streams in the area. Values range from
as low as 0.11 g/t to as high as 1.91 g/t gold.

Drilling

In January 2006, Westport completed 11 BQ sized (75mm) diamond drill holes totalling
524.7 meters. The program was designed as shallow infill holes in the Margarethental and
Razorback sections covering only a 270 metre section of the OMZ. The results are detailed
in the Drilling section of the Report. To date drilling has not been attempted in the middle of
the deposit where vein clusters were not evident on surface. Current interpretation indicates
that the ore body plunges to the south with the mineralisation hosted within boudinaged
tension gashes in the shear zone

10.2 Exploration work 2007-2009 conducted by Westport

Trenching

The focus of the exploration program in 2007 was on the strike extent of mineralization of
the OMZ towards the southernmost workings (to be drill verified to depth in future), the
potential gold content within the host sediments and broaden exploration over the whole
license area to adhere to the obligations of tenure. Multiple trenching programs occurred
throughout 2007. In total; 23 trenches were completed for geological rock chip channel
sample composites across target geology hosting vein clusters. The strike length potential
following trench results is at least 7km over widths of >250-300m in places.

In January and February 2008, 3,043 samples were taken (approximately one per meter)
from a 3,043 m trenching program (18 east west trenches spaced approximately 170 m
apart) which was completed over the 2.5 km extension of the silicified ridge. So far the
highest gold value was encountered in trench 8 with 68.1 g/t and 55.6 g/t, both times over 1
m widths, which does highlight the nugget affect on results. The trenches TR 8, 9, and 14
are of special interest because they have continuous gold grades for > 170 m in intersection
width with values ranging between 0.8 g/t and 0.92 g/t and these areas have not been
previously drill tested to depth.

Geophysics

From July 16
th

through December 15
th

2009 a series of in-house geophysical surveys were
completed by Westport over the OMZ and OD6 areas. The surveys were completed by
Westport personnel under the direct supervision of geophysicist Ronald Joly. None of the
extensive geophysical programs have been interpreted by a Qualified Geophysicist. On a
rudimentary basis, the ground magnetics and ground spectrometry survey points to
anomalies in the south east, north west, east and west of the current drilled area, which is
indicative of further resource expansion potential. It is strongly recommended that all the
geophysical data be reviewed by an experienced geophysicist and a report be compiled.

Spectrometer Survey

At the OMZ, a total of 83 grid lines comprising 350 km was completed using a Pico-
Envirotec Spectrometer. At the OD6 area, a total of 48 grid lines comprising 193 km were
completed using a Pico-Envirotec Spectrometer. Ground spectrometry in conjunction with
the hyperspectral data has identified anomalies to the north of the Margarethental fault
(Figure 10-5) traditionally viewed to be the northern limit but contradicted by the only hole
drilled on the northern side (OD 27 averaging 0.4 g/t over 291m with 83 vein sets bearing
gold over and above the lower grade carry of the metamorphic country host rock).

completed using a GemSystems GSM-19W magnetometer (Figure 10-6).

At the OMZ, a total of 17 grid lines comprising 46 km was run using a Geonics EM17 VLF
unit. At the OD6 area, a total of 16 grid lines comprising 47 km was run using a Geonics
EM17 VLF unit (Figure 10-6). The magnetic survey successfully defines potential intrusive
and the Magnetic plus VLF survey indicates anomalies west of the OMZ drilling, which
should be field checked.

11 DRILLING

In January 2006, Westport completed 11 diamond drill holes totalling 524.7 meters. The
drilling was completed by Guenzel T/A Guenzel and supervised by Westport geological
personnel. Drilling Diamond drill core from the 2006 drilling program was geologically logged
and sampled at the Ondundu site. The holes have been drilled along three different section
lines: Section 141100/7708170 (OD30 – OD032), Section 140170/7707240 (OD033- OD036
and OD040) and section 139900/7706970 (OD 036 – OD039). The entire core have been
split, sampled and assayed for gold. A total of 364 core samples were collected and sent for
analysis.

The diamond drilling programme comprised shallow (less than 100 metres vertical depth)
infill holes at the OMZ for future bulk sample control in the historically mined and drilled
areas (in vein clusters).

Note:: Down hole width has not been corrected but based on drill holes and structural dip of the
mineralization, the interval is considered close (90%) to true width.

The drill results indicate that the shallow gold mineralization lacks lithological correlation
between holes along these sections (Figures 13 -15) and the assay results revealed
sporadic, nugget gold values throughout. Grade uniformity and continuity of mineralized vein
clusters are not readily apparent. Mineralized zones with > 1.00 g/t gold do exist in some
individual drill holes but these zones cannot be easily extrapolated to surfaces and also
cannot be easily correlated with other adjacent holes. Gold grade is primarily associated
with quartz-carbonate veins, hematite staining and occurrence of coarse arsenopyrite in the
core.

To date drilling has not been attempted in the middle of the deposit where vein clusters were
not evident on surface. Current interpretation indicates that the ore body plunges to the
south with the mineralisation hosted within boudinaged tension gashes in the shear zone.

12 SAMPLING METHODS AND APPROACH

Exploration Prior to 2005

Sampling methods used in the many previous surface and drill programs prior to 2005 are
poorly known. There is insufficient information available from the Ondundu legacy data to
meet CIM requirements.

A detailed review of the legacy data indicates that diamond drill core sample intervals were
determined based on host rock type, intensity of quartz veining and sulphide mineralization.
Individual quartz veins were sampled in total and host sediments as half core of maximum
length of 1.5m. Holes were logged to a scale of 1:50. Detailed surface sampling at 1:100
was done over the drill sections for surface/core correlation. By 1985 and the focus on
selective mining much effort was expended trying to correlate vein projection along strike
down plunge and to surface, which does indicate that there was a certain belief that such
projectability was possible in such a structural setting. Unfortunately, the basis of their
selective vein-mining thesis cannot be verified for the purposes of this report other than the
sections presented by Charles by 1987 reflecting such zones and results were entirely
quoted in cm g/t. In fact, all the diamond drill holes were re-logged on this basis and veins
were numbered down the hole in such manner that this nomenclature would be projected to
surface and along strike and down plunge.

Sampling of boreholes was done by individual unit (i.e. Vein, sediment unit). Not all of the
drill core was sampled. Surface trench and composite underground sampling was done as a
series of overlapping "boxes', in order to reduce the "nugget effect". Much of the sampling
was selective and the absence of assay data could thus underestimate the potential for
exploiting the deposit as a low grade bulk mining target.

The two RC holes drilled yielded very poor sample returns (>60%) due to unforeseen
underground workings to depth. In order to mitigate the possibility of intersecting old
workings in future drilling, modeling of the legacy data utilising the results from the recent
surface re-survey programme and testing a new geophysical analysis of max/min data is
recommended.

Westport Exploration 2005-2006

Stream Sediment Sampling.

Steam sediment samples have been collected from sample sites, about 1 km apart from
each on all major steams and tributaries draining the entire exclusive prospecting license
area. Materials have been collected from natural trap sites – behind boulders and weirsand
areas with high concentration of heavy minerals were also targeted for sampling material.
Approximately 12 kg of -2000 microns material have been collected at each sample site.
The material was then transported by Westport personnel to the offices in Windhoek for
further sample preparation.

In Windhoek under the supervision of Westport personnel, the initial – 2000 microns
material was riffle split in half. The one half is stored in the storage for future reference and
the other half is processed further. The selected half is sieved in to four size fractions -2000
+ 1000 microns, -1000 + 500 microns, -500 + 180 microns and -180 microns material. The



57 | P a g e

two desired size fractions ( -1000 +500 and -180 microns) are then sealed and shipped to
Set Point Laboratories, Johannesburg, South Africa for analysis.

2006 Diamond Drilling

The following sampling protocol was utilized for the sampling of the 2006 diamond drill core:

i. All core was transported from the drill site to the core logging facility by the project
geologist at least once each day.

ii. All core was logged and sampled at a secure core logging facility on the Ondundu
property.

iii. Sample intervals were based on lithological, mineralogical and structural features
observed within the core. Sample intervals always began and ended at lithological
contacts.

iv. Minimum sample interval was 0.62 metres and maximum sample interval was 2.30
metres with a typical sample size of 1.50 metres.

v. The one half of the split core was placed in a polyethylene sample bag, labelled with
an assay tag and secured with a cable tie. The corresponding one half core interval
in the core box was marked by a stapled tag.

vi. Core boxes are labelled with an aluminum tag engraved with the hole number, box
number and the meterage of the start and end of the box.

vii. Holes were labelled using an alpha-numeric code.

viii.All core was accurately geologically logged and geotechnically logged.

ix. All core was logged and sampled under the direction of Westport geological
personnel.

x. Core is currently being stored on the Ondundu property.

The angle of the drill core and dip of the mapped stratigraphy indicate that the down hole
intercept are approximately 90% true width. Core recovery averaged a moderate 72 per cent
with some of the mineralised intervals being less than 60 per cent. This, along with the
relatively small core BQ (75mm) core size makes it difficult to determine a representative
sample. It is strongly recommended that a minimum of NQ sized core be used for future drill
programs along with a triple tubed core barrel. The drilled area only occurred at shallow
depths over a 270 metre strike length segment of the OMZ and cannot be taken as
representative of the entire mineralizing system.

Westport Exploration 2007-2009

Trenching

Manual (pickaxe and shovel) and mechanical (excavator) trenches are typically excavated
to widths of 1 m and 1.5 m, respectively, and an average depth of 3 m, with some sections
of trenches reaching 4 to 5 m in depth. Trenching typically extends down to the saprolite
horizon, or locally to saprock, but often the saprolite cannot be reached due to safety
concerns. The entire length of the trench is subjected to systematic geological mapping and
channel sampling; with wooden pegs stuck to the side of the trench at 2 m intervals. Prior to
sampling the Samples consist of continuous, horizontal channels excavated along the



58 | P a g e

bottom sidewall of the trench (~ 0.10 m above floor) with emphasis on constant sample
volume over the length of the sample interval. Saprolite/rock chips are collected on a clean
plastic sheet laid on the trench floor and immediately placed into a labeled plastic sample
bag containing a unique sample ticket stapled to the inside lip of the bag, and securely
sealed by staples. Samples are typically 2 m in length; with 1 m, to locally 0.5 m, samples
being utilized in areas of geological interest and/or to delineate specific lithological/structural
features. The sample intervals (i.e. sample numbers) are marked on aluminum tags stapled
to wooden pegs stuck to the sidewall of the trench. Samples are collected by a trained field
assistant under the supervision of a company geologist.

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS AND SECURITY

Exploration Prior to 2005

Sampling analysis used in the many previous surface and drill programs prior to 2006 are
poorly known. Diamond drill logs from previous drill programs completed in the 1980s
describe sample intervals ranging from 0.3 to 5 feet. Sample security from dispatch to the
various laboratories was probably not sufficient to meet present day CIM standards although
there is no evidence to doubt the veracity of the assay results. Two techniques were
employed for assays: a "vein route" for quartz vein material and a "sediment route" for the
intervening metamorphic host rock. Both methods use a KCN leach process to take the Au
into solution, finishing with AAS. This assay technique can often result in underestimation of
the gold content.

The veracity of Au assay results obtained from Ondundu has been a matter of uncertainty
as none of these were umpire assayed at a CIM qualified laboratory. The gold on the
prospect varies in particle size from ~10microns to a few mm. The coarse nature of the Au
introduces a considerable "nugget effect" to the mineralization.

This "nugget effect" results in large variations in assay results over short distances, and
hence statistical uncertainty in ore reserve estimates although it is fair to say that although
diamond drilling was employed and split core assays would exacerbate this nugget effect
TCL sampled the whole of the quartz vein containing core where these nuggets are mostly
found.

TCL/GFN spent a great deal of effort to mitigate this problem. Three separate laboratories
were used for Au assays: TCL lab in Tsumeb, GFSA laboratory in Johannesburg and
Scientific Services in Windhoek. Two sampling and assay methods were used.

Westport Exploration 2005-2006

Trench, drill and surface rock chip/grab samples remain within sight of Westport technical
staff from collection in the field to transport to the Field Camp. All samples were laid-out in
sequence in the designated sample room to avoid duplications and omissions of samples in
the laboratory submission orders, and the sample bags placed in labelled rice sacks in
sequence. The shipping sacks were immediately secured with a numbered security seal (i.e.
nylon zap strap) and stored in a locked room pending shipment to the laboratory; with only
the Project Geologist and the Project Manager having access to the key. A record of all
samples shipped, as well as the actual samples within the individual sacks and their security
seal numbers, is kept by the project geologist.

Upon delivery or pickup of samples, a signed copy of the Sample Submittal Form was
provided to Westport personnel by ALS Chemex sample reception staff. All core from the
2006 diamond drilling program and all sampling was transported to ALS Chemex, with the
exception of the stream sediment samples and trench samples which were shipped to Set
Point Laboratories, both in Johannesburg South Africa by Westport personnel for analysis.
ALS Chemex and Set Point are accredited testing laboratory that conforms to the
requirements of ISO/IEC 17025.

Stream Sediment Sampling

The initial – 2000 microns material was riffle split in half. The one half is stored in the
storage for future reference and the other half is processed further. The selected half is
sieved in to four size fractions -2000 + 1000 microns, -1000 + 500 microns, -500 + 180
microns and -180 microns material. The two desired size fractions( -1000 +500 and -180
microns) are then sealed and shipped to Set Point Laboratories, Johannesburg, South
Africa for analysis. These samples were analyzed for Gold (Au) using a fire assay (ICP)
technique with a gravimetric finish and for Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, Mn, Ag, As, and Bi using a
pressed pellet XRF technique.

2006 Drilling

The samples were sealed and sent to ALS Chemex laboratories, Johannesburg, South
Africa for analysis. ALS Chemex has attained ISO 9001:2000 for most of its laboratories
world-wide. It is also accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities Australia
for its laboratories in Australia. ALS Chemex is also registered with QMI, one of the North
American leading management systems registrar and currently working toward attaining ISO
17025. The South African laboratories are not yet accredited, but they are working on the
standard.

All samples were crushed, pulverized and then assayed for gold using Au 50 g fire assay
with a gravimetric finish technique. They were also assayed for other 50 elements using a
50 element aqua regia ICP – MS technique. Quality control tests have been conducted for
every procedure. About 5.00% of the pulps will be re-assayed for quality control purposes.

The trace level gold analysis procedure uses a flux mixture, adding the sample amount of 10
grams into the crucible, mixing and fusing. The resultant lead button is cupelled and the
Dore bead dissolved in aqua regia and analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. The
detection limit is 5 ppb Au.

ALS uses international standards manufactured by Rocklabs. For ppm work, seven (7)
different standards cover the range 0.6-7.71 ppm Au for 50g Fire Assay. One (1) standard of
13.65 ppm is used for gravimetric determinations. In the event that one internal standard in
a batch fails by more than + 2 standard deviations, re-assay of 10 samples either side of the
failed standard is performed. These results, together with the new result for the re-assay
standard, are entered in the hard copy for Westport.

Westport Exploration 2007-2009

Trenching

Trench samples were analyzed for Gold (Au) using a fire assay (ICP) technique with a
gravimetric finish and for Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, Mn, Ag, As, and Bi using a pressed pellet XRF
technique. Set Point Laboratories is an ISO 9001:2000-accredited laboratory, which control
their data quality with the use of reagent blanks, reference materials, and replicates. Results
are routinely examined by an independent geochemist to ensure laboratory performance
meets required standards.



61 | P a g e

While the sample preparation, analyses and security of the Westport work were in line with
best industry practices, the absence of analytical standards, duplicates and blanks inserted
in the sample submittal stream by Westport for the 2006 drilling and 2008-2009 trenching
programs, means the assays are not sufficient to meet CIM standards.

14 DATA VERIFICATION

Exploration Prior to 2005

Historical data used in the preparation of this report was obtained from the Westport office in
Windhoek, Namibia. The design of the 2006 diamond drilling program was entirely based
upon a review of 28 historical diamond drill holes (5.538 m) completed by TCL and GFN
between 1980 and 1989. Original diamond drill logs, assay data, and geological section and
plan maps, filed at the Westport office in Windhoek, were used during this review.

The sampling and drilling data generated by TCL and GFN cannot be qualified in terms of
the CIM standards and can only represent the potential quantity and grade of these
exploration targets as conceptual in nature at the present time and there is no assurance
that they will be defined.

Over and above the nugget effect of coarse gold "nugget" influences on the grade, another
problem, which significantly affected the confidence in TCL/GFN 'ore reserve' estimates was
the discontinuous nature of the veins and the variability of grades over distance. Sections
were drilled on average 200m apart, the influence of each of the sections being the half
distances to adjacent sections. Significant problems were encountered correlating veins and
vein-grades from section to section. This was due in part to pinching and swelling and
boudinage within the veins.

The variability of grades, continuity of veins and geometric complexity of the deposit clearly
suggests that 28 diamond holes were not enough to provide the data required to determine
the viability of the Ondundu gold deposit and confidence for a CIM NI43-101 resource
statement.

The data-set is reasonably well constrained in XYZ for the methods of the time (tape and
theodolite). The base line was surveyed in and tie lines turned off at right angles and
chained. Slope interference and poor correction did at times lead to convergent tie lines over
1km. Their exploration was done on a 50x50m grid. Accuracy (cumulative error) of loop
closures for survey grids were expected to be not less than 10cm. It was decided that in
order to make some use of the TCL/GFN data, the grid has been reactivated and
resurveyed by a qualified land surveyor in WGS84 UTM33S. An accuracy of +3cm in XYZ
may be expected from this procedure.

Having a resurveyed grid (digital terrain model) will allow the TCL/GFN mapping and
borehole data to be integrated.

The Qualified Person was unable to independently verify the individual assay results
because the mineralized intervals from the historic holes were whole core assayed . While,
none of the historic results were verified, they reasonably fit in with the results of the 2006
core sampling program and can be used for the purpose of defining geochemical anomalies,
envelopes and targets for future exploration on the property.



62 | P a g e

Westport Exploration 2005-2009

The Author reviewed the available data made available from Westport during the site visit,
which included a digital spreadsheet database of all the drilling conducted on the Project.

The Author notes that very little of the information reviewed made any mention of a QAQC
program being in place during the time the work was performed.

In order to plan for the bulk sample control drill holes Westport sought to draw sections
based on lower cut off grades in the hope that the mineralised zones thus identified would
have a higher spatial continuity than the high grades. Generally high-grade values have
limited spatial continuity in coarse gold settings due to the 'nugget effect'. These are mere
projections and based upon data that was not generated in terms of CIM standards.

The 2006 diamond drill program was completed using small sized BQ core. For this reason
the Qualified Person was unable to independently confirm the individual assay results. The
coarse gold effect of the mineralization should require a much larger sample being collected,
at a minimum NQ sized core. The replication of assay results has been an issue for the
Project since the 1980s, discussed above. The Author notes that given the extremely broken
up nature of the sampled intervals, attempting to get a good representative core sample is
unrealistic, and the complete remaining core would have to be processed.

Review of the OMZ area was carried out with the main objective of position the trenches and
review the geology. Location problems were found at the first two trenches, 80 meters error
was noted. A review of all trenches needs to be done in order to prove the accuracy in
location.

The main zone area is characterized by strong N-S foliation with steep dipping to west, and
low angle bedding and weak foliation at the both sides. In the middle the strong foliation
overlaps the bedding and there is more density of quartz veins, while at the both side, veins
follow the bedding and seem to be scattered. Geological detail mapping with accurate
topographic maps are necessary.

The Author attempted to determine which of the holes in the database best coincided with
the GPS collars measured in the field but to no avail. In this regard, the resurvey/GPS work
that was completed in 2009 should be professionally drafted so that there is an up to date
site plan showing the actual surveyed positions of the original drill holes, trenching and
sample locations on UTM grid.

Based on the extensive database available, the Author did not collect check samples on the
Westport work. The size of the database and the nature of the gold mineralization would
make any results statistically insignificant when compared to the number of samples in the
total dataset.

The assay data was verified by the respective laboratories using standard quality control
tests throughout the processes. The original certificates of analysis from ALS Chemex and
Set Point Laboratories have been perused and verified.



63 | P a g e

The Author concludes that no problems were found with the assay and lithology database,
and that the collar survey data has been independently verified. The Author does
recommend that a formal and rigorous QA/QC program be designed and implemented for
the project.

15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES

There are no Adjacent Properties as defined by NI43-101

16 MINERAL RESOURCE & RESERVE ESTIMATES

There has been no attempt by Westport or Golconda to calculate a mineral resource on the

17 MINERAL PROCESSING

No mineral processing or metallurgical testing has been completed by Westport or
Golconda.

18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

The Ondundu Project is not at a development or production stage therefore no additional
information is provided that would relate to these activities.

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The regional setting is imbued with all the elements of structure, intrusive character, and
original volcaniclastic geology interfingered with arenaceous and argillaceous rocks that
within the orogenic formation and subsequent tectonic evolution would yield a variety of
epithermal suites of deposits. Such is the case at Ondundu where the perceived gold and
arsenic only deposit, has been viewed in its isolated context in time to be of upper Swakop
(Kuiseb) age and therefore predetermined the development enterprise at Ondundu in time.

Gold mineralization on the Project was first discovered in 1917 and intermittent underground
plus alluvial mining took place from 1923 to 1945. Modern day exploration began in the
1980s when Tsumeb Corporation Limited ("TCL") and Goldfields Namibia Ltd. ("GFN")
completed 28 diamond drill holes totalling 5,583 metres in the Ondundu Main zone ("OMZ").
In 1983 a historic resource estimate of 42 million tonnes grading 0.39 gram gold per tonne
was produced by TCL, in 1987 a historic resource of 4.57 million tonnes grading 3.39 grams
gold per tonne was reported by GFN and in 1989 a historic resource of 4.35 million tonnes
grading 3.19 grams gold per tonne was reported by GFN. These resources are historical
and not compliant with National Instrument 43-101 reporting standards; however they are
considered material to the prospectivity of the Ondundu gold project. A "qualified person" for
the purposes of NI 43-101 has not done sufficient work to qualify the historical estimate as
current mineral resources or mineral reserves. The historical estimates should not be



64 | P a g e

treated as current mineral resources or mineral reserves and the historical estimates
contained herein should not be relied upon.

It is the Qualified Persons opinion that the exploration work done by Westport from 2005-
2009 met its required objectives by providing evidence for additional prospective ground
surrounding the present showings. Steam sediment sampling assay results revealed
substantial gold occurrences in two different streams in the area. Values ranging from as
low as 0.11 g/t to as high as 1.91 g/t gold. Data from hyperspectral (Hymap) survey
identified areas of potential hydrothermal alteration that should be followed up. The
hyperspectral data indicates that potential exists to the north of the Margarethental fault
traditionally viewed to be the northern limit of the mineralizatin but contradicted by the only
hole drilled on the northern side (OD 27 averaging 0.4 g/t over 291m with 83 vein sets
bearing gold over and above the lower grade carry of the metamorphic country host rock).

Based on the previous exploration and drilling by TCL and GFN in the 1980s, the Ondundu
Project has the potential to develop an economic gold deposit.

Width of the OMZ deposit is variable along strike with intersection widths 100 and 250m and
most likely controlled by structural buckle in a ductile phase later being exploited by
epithermal fluidization pulses. There however does seem to be a stratigraphic connect (seen
from historic workings) between the northern portion of the OMZ and the Carr veins
immediately to the east. Due to the plunge of the deposit this was never drill tested.

The length was only drilled over the northernmost 1.5km strike extent whereas historic
workings can be seen over a strike extent of 2.7km. The most recent drill program
completed in 2006 and comprised only 524.7 metres. The assay results revealed sporadic
gold values but continuity of mineralized vein cluster cannot be easily justified As a result,
addition holes need to be drilled adjacent to the recently drilled sections. These holes will
further help to confirm continuity of this mineralized vein clusters if there is any apparent
continuity at all. If continuity cannot be confirmed then one can safely conclude that there
exist no continuity of these vein clusters and therefore a different approach to this program
will be necessary.

The OMZ area requires systematic drilling to define a mineral resource compliant with NI 43-
101.

Cu/Au mineralization on EPL 3915 further to the north in the legacy OD6 grid area also
warrants further investigation. The coeval alteration, metasomatism, tourmalinisation and
brecciation is indicative of a complex hydrothermal setting that has led to the complex
intrusive and stratiform occurrence of the Cu/Au/As anomalies and mineralization supported
by ground geophysics.

This area is defined from the Margarethental Fault in the south to the northern extent of the
EPL boundary, which in the south contains faulted out northern extensions to the OMZ Au
deposit, has new hyperspectral ground geophysics anomalies corresponding with historical
works soaked in quartz veining, areas historically mined for Cu/Au, anomalies
corresponding with tourmalinisation, haemetisation, albitisation, sericitisation, metasomatism
and ground geophysical anomalies.



65 | P a g e

The sheer scale (6kmx4km) of alteration and metasomatism together with known Cu/Au
mineralization, legacy Cu/Au/As soil anomalies, Cu/Au rock chip anomalies, old workings
and mapped breccia bodies corresponding with hyperspectral anomalies and recently
generated VLF anomalies highlights the prospectivity of the northern OD6 area and potential
for a setting differing significantly from the Au only deposit to the south.

It is clear that a regional copper anomaly exists (General Mining) verified by TCL/GFN
based around old historic workings. That there were historic Cu/Au workings throughout the
area and later investigated for gold potential by GFN meant that besides the Au only OMZ
deposit to the south there was an inkling of the significance of the Cu/Au significance in the
anticlinorium to the north in terms of epithermal meaning. The occurrence of breccias bodies
and fuchsite as in Timmins alerts one to the potential of an epithermal family of a different
sulphidation complexity as opposed to the Au only setting in the OMZ.

20 RECOMMENDATIONS

The Author is of the opinion that the Project has not been adequately explored and warrants
the funding of a results-driven, well-structured exploration program. The Author considers
that the Project is of sufficient merit to warrant a contingent, two stage work program with
the initial work program estimated to cost approximately $5,226,272 (Table 20-1).

20.1 Phase 1 - OMZ Resource Drilling

 Diamond drill the Ondundu Main Zone to test the down plunge and deeper extents of
the deposit as well as the anomalies the adjacent areas for resource expansion
delineation. This will include twinning legacy holes for orientation drill procedure and
sampling, and comparative purposes.

 A combination of Reverse Circulation to sample the first 10-15m where legacy drilling
achieved poor drill core recovery followed by Diamond Drilling (HQ) to sample drill
core to depth especially below the water table where water was seen to affect RC
samples.

 Drilling is aimed at a minimum 50x50m grid with focus on the deeper down plunge
expression of the full 2.7 km strike extent.

 3D Modelling of the legacy data will be on going following the recent data validation
and auditing of the meta data set for incorporation into a computational resource
model for the deposit.

Phase 1 - OD6 (Core of the Ondundu Anticlinorium)

Follow-up detailed ground geophysics and initial RAB drilling:

 Complete the ground geophysical program to elucidate anomalies that with legacy
information defines initial RAB drill sampling targets.

 In order to contextualize the Cu/Au occurrences in the OD6 area together with the
alteration, intrusive and stratiform complexity targeted regional RAB drilling is aimed
to test legacy and currently generated anomalies.

 4280m of RAB drilling is planned to test relevant anomalies.



66 | P a g e

On completion of the Phase 1 program, the operating company should be able to generate
an NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate for the OMZ and adequately examined
the full exploration potential of the OD6 area. Should the results merit continuation of
exploration the following second stage programme is recommended.

20.2 Phase 2 – OMZ bulk pre-feasibility sampling (Contingent on results of Phase 1)

A phase 2 budget of $5,636,500 comprising bulk sampling for pre-feasibility study is
contingent on positive results of the initial work program (Table 20-2).

Don Boyack is of the opinion that the program and recommended budget are warranted.
