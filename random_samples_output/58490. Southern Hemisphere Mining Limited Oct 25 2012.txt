1 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 

Andes Mining Services Ltd (AMS) has been commissioned by Southern Hemisphere Mining 
Limited (SHM) to prepare an updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Llahuin Cu-Au 
Project, located within the Coquimbo region of central Chile.   

The Mineral Resource Estimate has been prepared under the guidelines of Canadian 
Institute of Mining (CIM) National Instrument 43-101 and accompanying documents 43-
101.F1 and 43-101.CP (NI43-101), and is JORC Compliant.   

1.2 Location 

The Llahuin Project is located within the Coquimbo region of central Chile, approximately 
240km north of Santiago, and 17km south of the town of Combarbala as displayed in Figure 
1.2_1.  The project is located 56km east of the coast and the Pan-American Highway.  The 
topographical coordinates of a central point within the project are East 71º 01'29" and North 
31º 20'23" (Datum Long/Lat UTM projection, International Reference Ellipsoid 1924, La 
Canoa datum 1956, Time/Area 19).

1.3 Ownership 

The Llahuin project is located within the "Amapola" concessions, some granted to MPS and 
others subject to an option to purchase via Minera Panamericana S.C.M (MPS).   

MPS is 100% owned by Pan American Mining Pty Ltd (PAM), SHM's 100% owned Australian 
subsidiary.  In July 2011, MPS executed an Option to Purchase Agreement (Llahuin Option 
Agreement), as detailed in Section 4 of this report, which has been duly executed and 
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations for each party.

1.4 Geology and Mineralization 

The Llahuin Deposit is a porphyry copper-gold system with medium sized early dioritic stocks 
that exhibits propylitic to potassic (biotite) alteration and is emplaced in a north-south trending 
regional fault system.   

Argillic-quartz sericite alteration zones are evident in both the upper zones and margins of the 
hydrothermal system within the volcanic wall rocks.   

At the Llahuin Project, a NNE trending elongated late granodioritic stock intrudes the early 
dioritic porphyry.  The mineralization in the Llahuin porphyry is related to the early dioritic 
porphyry stock with abundant stockworks of quartz and variable amounts of magnetite, biotite, 
tourmaline, actinolite, calcite, copper oxides, iron oxides and some pyrite, chalcopyrite, 
covelite, chalcocite and molybdenite.  The mineralization is mainly associated with veinlet 
systems, with copper mineralization present as chalcopyrite.   

The Llahuin Project consists of the Central Porphyry Zone, which was previously known as 
the Llahuin Porphyry, the Cerro de Oro Zone and the Ferrocarril Zone as displayed in Figure 
1.4_1 below.  The Central Porphyry Zone is a typical Cu-Au porphyry system with associated 
stockwork mineralization.  The Cerro de Oro Zone lies almost entirely within volcanic rock 
and is interpreted as the stockwork cap to an underlying porphyry system. There are 
explosive breccia style textures associated with this deposit.  The Ferrocarril Zone is 
underexplored and is not well understood.

1.5 Status of Exploration 

There have been various exploration phases on the Llahuin exploitation concessions including 
two drill holes completed in 2004 and an artisanal open pit and underground excavation.  
Results of the historical drilling, exploration and exploitation activities prior to SHM's 
involvement are not readily available.   

This report gives details of exploration undertaken by SHM from June 2011 to August 2012.  
At the date of this report, further exploration drilling is being carried out at and around the 
Llahuin Deposit.  The results of this drilling will be incorporated into future mineral resource 
estimates.

The work completed by SHM to-date has included: 

• Regional reconnaissance, rock chip sampling and geophysics.  

• Project scale mapping at 1:2000 scale of the Llahuin Project.   

• 30 diamond drill (DDH) holes for a total of 11,367m.   

• 124 reverse circulation (RC) holes for a total of 22,445m.   

 

1.6 Mineral Resources 

The Llahuin Project mineral resource estimate is based on 30 DC (11,367m) and 124 RC 
holes (22,445m) drilled at a spacing of between 50m x 50m to 200m x 200m.  Only data 
received as at 17th August 2012 has been used in this estimate.  SHM is continuing an 
ongoing infill, extensional and exploration drillhole program.   

The mineral resource estimate has been constructed within 0.10% Cu and 0.10g/t Au grade 
shells.  Multiple lithological units have been grouped together, based upon statistical 
properties and visual review of cross sections.   

The mineral resource has been reported above at a cut-off grade of 0.28% CuEq, although 
not within an optimised open pit shell.  An independent mineral resource has been estimated 
comprising a measured and indicated mineral resource of 144.9Mt at 0.30% Cu, 0.10 g/t Au, 
and 0.006% Mo. An inferred mineral resource of 16.7 Mt at 0.27% Cu, 0.06 g/t Au and 
0.004% Mo has also been estimated as displayed in Table 1.6_1.   

The resource has been reported to the base of drilling at approximately 400m vertical depth 
below surface.   

The statement has been classified by Qualified Person Ian Dreyer BSc (Geology) MAusIMM 
(CP) in accordance with the Guidelines of NI 43-101 and accompanying documents 43-
101.F1 and 43-101.CP.  The statement is also JORC compliant.   It has an effective date of 
10th September 2012.

1.7 Copper Equivalent Calculation 

The copper equivalent (CuEq) calculation represents the total metal value for each metal, 
multiplied by the conversion factor, summed and expressed in equivalent copper percentage.  
These results are exploration results only and no allowance is made for recovery losses that 
may occur should mining eventually result.  It is the qualified person's opinion that the 
elements considered have a reasonable potential to be recovered as evidenced in similar 
porphyry copper mines in Chile.  Copper equivalent conversion factors and long-term price 
assumptions used are stated below:  

CuEq Formula= Cu % + Au (g/t) x 0.72662 + Mo (%) x 4.412 

Price Assumptions: Cu (US$3.40/lb), Au (US$1,700/oz), Mo (US$15/lb) 

1.8 Conclusions and Recommendations 

• The project is being systematically explored and drilled. 

• The Central Porphyry, Cerro de Oro and Ferrocarril Zones are targets which remain 
open in all directions.   

• The level of geological understanding across the project area is moderate, although it 
has improved with the use of additional diamond drillholes.   

• The use of a different drilling orientation (drill direction=060°) in much of the recent 
phase of diamond drilling into the Central Porphyry Zone has produced somewhat 
higher grades in the core of this deposit, when compared to the combined RC and 
diamond drilling of the previous phase of drilling (drill direction=300°).   

• There is no evidence of any geological bias, such as drilling along high grade zones 
or structures, in the new drill orientation (drill direction=060°).

• The replacement of a number of RC holes with DC holes in the estimate improves the 
confidence of the grade estimate and has partially removed the previous issue of 
using some wet RC samples in the estimate.  The wet RC samples may have led to 
either grade smearing or grade loss, through washing out fine mineralised material.   

• The quantity and quality of standards inserted into the sample stream by SHM has not 
improved and this requires rectification.   

• SHM has twinned 3 RC holes with DC holes.  There is insufficient information at 
present to draw any conclusions with any confidence, however AMS do not note any 
material differences between the DDH and RC drill hole results.   

• Metallurgical testwork should commence immediately.  This appears to be in hand. 

• A geophysical assessment of the Ferrocarril Zone is warranted, followed by a 100m x 
100m grid drilling pattern over the most prospective areas of this zone.   

• Drill the Cerro de Oro Zone at depth to test for a potential Porphyry source.   

• A budget of $7.0 Million annually that consists of 1 DC rig and 1 RC rig, with 
appropriate staff, supervision, and technical support, is the appropriate level of 
expenditure for this project.   

• AMS recommends that the project be advanced to a Preliminary Economic 
Assessment (PEA) level of evaluation and design.

adopted by CIM Council in November 2004 and updated in 2011. The resource is also JORC 
compliant.   

2.2 Forward-Looking Information 

This report contains "forward-looking information" within the meaning of applicable Canadian 
securities legislation. Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements 
related to the capital and operating costs of the Llahuin Project, the price assumptions with 
respect to copper and gold, production rates, the economic feasibility and development of the 
Llahuin Project and other activities, events or developments that SHM expects or anticipates 
will or may occur in the future.   Forward-looking information is often identified by the use of 
words such as "plans", "planning", "planned", "expects" or "looking forward", "does not 
expect", "continues", "scheduled", "estimates", "forecasts", "intends", "potential", "anticipates", 
"does not anticipate", or "belief", or describes a "goal", or variation of such words and phrases 
or state that certain actions, events or results "may", "could", "would", "might" or "will" be 
taken, occur or be achieved.   

Forward-looking information is based on a number of factors and assumptions made by the 
authors and management, and considered reasonable at the time such information is made, 
and forward-looking information involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other 
factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements to be materially 
different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking information.  Such factors 
include, among others, obtaining all necessary financing, licenses to explore and develop the 
project; successful definition and confirmation based on further studies and additional 
exploration work of an economic mineral resource base at the project; as well as those factors 
disclosed in SHM's current Annual Information Form and Management's Discussion and 
Analysis, as well as other public disclosure documents, available on SEDAR at 
www.sedar.com.   

Although SHM has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, 
events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking information, there

4.4 The Nature and Extent of the Titles 

The only obligations contemplated in Chilean legislation which must be satisfied by a mining 
concessionaire is the payment of a claim fee, and any negotiated surface rights payments.  

AMS has not independently verified, nor is it qualified to independently verify, the legal status 
of the Llahuin Project concessions, and has relied on information provided by SHM.  In 
preparing this report AMS has assumed that the tenements are, or will prove to be, lawfully 
accessible for evaluation. 

4.5 Mining Property  

4.5.1 Mining Concessions in Chile 

The Political Constitution of the Republic (PRC) provides that the State of Chile has the 
absolute, exclusive, unalienable and imprescriptibly dominion over all the mines, and the 
mineral substances determined by Constitutional Organic Law (COL) as susceptible of such 
work may be explored and exploited through mining concessions.   

The mining concession is an 'in rem' right on real property different and independent from 
ownership of surface lands, even if they have the same owner, that is, the separation of the 
dominion over the mining concession (that gives the right to explore and/or exploit mineral 
substances) and the ownership of the surface land where it is intended to perform mining 
exploration and exploitation work is confirmed.   

The mining concession is transferable and transmissible, susceptible to mortgage and other 
real rights, and in general, of any act or contract; and is ruled by the same civil laws as the 
rest of the real estate properties, unless they are contrary to the COL or Mining Code (MC)   

The mining concessions are constituted in a non contentious judicial procedure which can be 
of two kinds: exploration concessions and exploitation (mining) concessions   

The exploration concessions have an initial effective period of 2 years but this period can be 
extended to 4 years by halving the concession surface area.  

The exploitation concessions have an indefinite effective period and grants exclusive rights to 
prospect and mine the concession area, provided the annual patent fees are paid.   

4.5.2 Access to the Necessary Lands for the Execution of Mining Work 

In view of the separation of the property rights of the mining concession from the surface land, 
the MC establishes special laws and regulations on this matter.  Access to the surface lands 
is provided during the proceedings carried out for the mining concession.   

Once the mining concession is constituted to carry out exploration and/or exploitation work as 
the case may be, its titleholder must obtain written permission from the titleholders of surface 
lands and additionally, if this is the case, from some administrative authorities.  This is if the 
performance of the work affects or can affect populated places of public interest or of national 
security, as detailed in articles 14, 15 and 17 of the MC.   



 
 

Amazon GeoServices Ltda ABN 52 065 481 209 
Technical Report – Southern Hemisphere Mining Limited Page:  20 
Effective Date –10th September 2012 

6005 Australia 

Once the mining concession is constituted, it grants the titleholder the right to impose special 
mining easements on surface lands after a determination of the indemnifications to be paid to 
the owner of the land, agreed with it or fixed judicially.  The mining easements can be for 
traffic or access, for electric services and for occupation.  In the terms and scopes of article 
120 of the MC, easements cannot be imposed in land where permanent constructions exist or 
which are covered by plantations of forests, vineyards and fruits.   

4.5.3 Water Rights 

The Mining Concessions grant the concessionary (the holder of the mining concession) the 
right to use the water resources found while developing exploration and/or exploitation works, 
only for the purposes of the exploration and/or exploitation works.  In case that no water 
resources are found in the course of the mining works, such resource shall be secured by 
incorporating and/or purchasing water rights from the State of Chile, through the Dirección 
General de Aguas by proving both the existence of the water resources requested and the 
existence of a project justifying the use thereof.   

4.5.4 Specific Tax to the Mining Activities 

There is a specific tax on the operational income of the mining activity obtained by a mining 
operator.  This progressive tax rate ranges from 0.5%, if the value of the annual sales 
exceeds the amount equivalent of over 12,000t of fine copper, to 4.5% if the annual sales 
exceed the value of 40,000t up to the value of 50,000t.   

If the sales exceed the value of 50,000t of fine copper, the tax is applied on the mining 
operational margin and the progressive tax rate ranges from 5% to 14% on operational 
margin.  The operational taxable income on which this tax is applied is determined in a 
particular way.  Certain expenses such as losses from past periods, accelerated depreciation 
of fixed assets, etc are not allowed for this purpose.  The mining operational margin is 
determined as a ratio of the operational taxable income to the mining operational turnover.   

4.6 Royalties / Agreements and Encumbrances 

During the exploration phase, the Llahuin project is not subject to any known payments or 
agreements and encumbrances, other than the Llahuin Option Agreement and any negotiated 
surface rights payments.   

Upon exploitation, the project is subject to the option agreement detailed below.   

  



 
 

Amazon GeoServices Ltda ABN 52 065 481 209 
Technical Report – Southern Hemisphere Mining Limited Page:  21 
Effective Date –10th September 2012 

6005 Australia 

 In July 2011, MPS executed an Option to Purchase Agreement (Llahuin Option Agreement). 
The details of this agreement are summarised below:   
 

• The Llahuin Option Agreement is a unilateral option to purchase agreement between 
MPS and Juan Sebastian Astudillo (Offeror), granted by means of a public deed 
executed at the Santiago Notary Public office of Ms. Antonieta Mendoza Escalas on July 
8th, 2011.   

• In addition to the Llahuin Mining Properties, the Llahuin Option Agreement also includes:   

(a) the inherent water rights or those that according to article 110 of the Chilean Mining Code 
may pertain to the Llahuin Mining Properties, and those that benefit or may benefit the 
Llahuin Mining Properties and which the Offerors and persons related to them may eventually 
possess, have use or dispose of in any fashion;   

(b) any type of rights concerning the surface lands, including ownership, and/or easements, that 
may come to or pertain to the Llahuin Mining Properties and/or the Offerors and persons 
related to them, obtained for the benefit of the Llahuin Mining Properties;   
 

• The Llahuin Option Agreement refers to the following exploitation concessions: "Amapola 
Uno, 1 AL 20", "Amapola Dos, 1 AL 20", "Amapola Tres, 1 AL 20" and "Amapola Cuatro, 1 
AL 18", all located in the city of Combarbalá, Province of Limarí, Fourth Region of 
Coquimbo covering an area of 7.72 sq kms.   

• By virtue of the Llahuin Option Agreement, MPS acquired the right to explore the Llahuin 
Mining Properties, and irrevocably, the right to opt to acquire their ownership, at its 
discretion.   

• The total option consideration for the acquisition of the Amapola licenses is $1,875,000. To 
date progress payments totalling $588,908 have been paid, leaving a balance of USD 
$1,286,092 which at SUH option, can be paid in cash or SUH shares listed on TSX-V by 
January 8, 2013. 

 
• To determine the value of such shares, the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of 

transaction of such shares in the Stock Exchange of Toronto during the last seven business 
days prior to the date on which the payment of this last installment is paid, will be 
calculated. 

 In order to secure the performance of the Offeror's obligations under the Llahuin Option 
Agreement, Juan Sebastian Astudillo granted a lien over the Llahuin concessions by way of 
registering the Llahuin Option Agreement with the Combarbala Mining Warden. 

 The Llahuin Option Agreement was registered in Conservator of Mines, Combarbala on 
July 21, 2011. 

4.7 Environmental Liabilities and Permits 

AMS is not aware, nor has it been made aware, of any environmental liabilities associated

5 SITE LOCATION, CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Location and Access 

The Llahuin Project is located in central Chile, approximately 240km north of Santiago.  The 
project area lies approximately 17km south of the town of Combarbala (population 14,000), as 
shown in Figure 5.1_1, and can be accessed from Combarbala by well maintained gravel 
roads.   

A central point from within the project area gives UTM coordinates of 6,531,800 N and 
307,700 E (Datum Long/Lat PSAD56).   

5.2 Physiography and Climate 

The Llahuin Project is located at an altitude of 1,300m ASL on the flanks of the Llahuin Valley, 
as displayed in Figure 5.2_1.  The area is characterized by a moderate relief depicted by 
mountain ranges and flat zones with deep ravines and steep slopes, with altitudes ranging 
from 1,000 to 1,500m above sea level.   

The climate is semi-arid with a relative humidity of around 50%.  Summer temperatures range 
from 24°C to 33°C with cool nights typical of semi-arid climates.  Winter temperatures are 
generally above freezing.  Annual rainfall is around 200mm but long periods of drought and 
heavy rains are not rare in the region.  The vegetation found is typical of the semi-arid climate 
and has adapted to the dryness and low relative humidity of the climate.   

5.3 Local Infrastructure 

Local infrastructure is considered excellent.  Access to the project area is good, and a high 
tension electricity line is located within 5km of the project capable of delivering sufficient power

6 HISTORY 

6.1 Ownership History 

The known history of the project commences with Cominco Resources Ltd, which undertook 
exploration activities in 1983.  Antofagasta Minerals S.A. (AMSA) acquired the project in 
2004, and joined the numerous small mining properties generating a unified and simplified 
area for exploration.  At the beginning of 2011, a subsidiary of SHM reached a commercial 
agreement required to acquire this project from Mr. Sebastian Astudillo who acquired the 
project from AMSA on the same date.   

6.2 Exploration History 

The Llahuin Project has been the subject of several exploration programs developed by 
various mining companies over the years that have focused their efforts on the exploration for 
copper and gold resources.   

In 1983, Cominco undertook surface sampling and geophysical profiles of induced 
polarization along with completing 7 drill holes.  Results to these drillholes have not been 
located by AMS.   

In 2004, AMSA conducted a prospecting program in the area that included a geological 
mapping at a scale of 1:2000 and 3 RC and 2 DDH holes.  The drill holes were concentrated 
in the area of Central Porphyry Zone below the small open pit.  These holes identified several 
zones of Cu, Au and Mo mineralization.  Results of these drillholes have not been located by 
AMS.   

6.3 Production History 

The area of Llahuin (otherwise known as the El Espino mining district) is an old mining district 
that has historically been mined for gold and copper mineralization.  Artisanal mining activities 
have focused mainly on vein-style mineralization.   

The Llahuin Open Pit, as displayed below in Figure 6.3_1 is located at the center of the 
Central Porphyry Zone. Its mining history dates back to the 18th century and has continued up 
until 2 years ago.  A vein in the centre of the pit was mined at widths of between 1m to 3m 
with reported grades between 1% and 10% Cu and between 1g/t and 5g/t Au.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The regional geology is characterized by a series of stratified volcanic and volcaniclastic  
rocks, which are part of the Arqueros Formation and Quebrada Marquesa Formation (Aguirre 
et al., In Rivano et al., 1991) of Neocomian age, and Barremian-Albian, respectively.  These 
formations are intruded by several intrusive stocks as displayed in Figure 7.1_1.

Technical Report – Southern Hemisphere Mining Limited Page:  28 
Effective Date –10th September 2012 

6005 Australia 

 
The Arqueros Formation is represented by a large sequence of volcanic flows and andesitic 
breccias, with interbedded sandstone and epiclastic breccias, which form a northwest-trending 
homocline that dips to the east.  This formation is concordant, and sometimes occurs as 
interdigitations within the sedimentary units of the Quebrada Marquesa Formation, including 
marls, limestones, shales, sandstones, conglomerates, and gypsum.  The Arqueros 
Formation commonly displays ductile deformation with the development of open folds.   

Both stratigraphic sequences are intruded by plutons from the Illapel Super Unit and the San 
Lorenzo Unit.  The first is represented mainly by Cretaceous granodiorite and diorite quartzite.  
The second unit is represented by a Late Cretaceous - Paleogene dioritic porphyry.   

The regional structural geological framework has played an important role on the control and 
distribution of lithologic units.  Numerous geological faults are recognized, which may have 
displaced major blocks of ground, at district and local scale.   

These faults have controlled the location of various intrusives and mineralization, and have 
been fundamental in the development and control of the mineralization through emplacement 
of mineralized stocks / vein networks.   

There are three sets of faults with orientations N-S, NE-SW and NW-SE as displayed in 
Figure 7.1_1.  Most of the structures are inclined between 70° and 85°, and show oblique 
movements, with mainly horizontal displacements, and to a lesser extent vertical 
displacements.

7.2 Project Geology and Mineralization 

The Cu-Au-Mo porphyry at Llahuin comprises three mineralized bodies of variable extent, 
namely the Central Porphyry Zone, the Cerro de Oro Zone, and the Ferrocarril Zone as 
displayed in Figure 7.2_1.  They are all associated with a stockwork hosted in a porphyritic 
dioritic to monzonitic intrusion, as displayed in Figure 7.2_2.  This figure only covers the 
Central Porphyry and Cerro de Oro Zones, and has not been updated for the Ferrocarril Zone.   
Mineralization extends to over 600m in depth within the Central Porphyry Zone.   

The high grade mineralization occurs as disseminations along hairline fractures as well as 
within larger veinlets.  The high grade mineralization typically contains between 0.2-1.0% 
copper, with smaller amounts of other metals such as gold and molybdenum.   

The higher grade mineralization is hosted in the central zone of the dioritic porphyry stock, 
which contains Cu and Au mineralization associated with potassic alteration.  The stockwork, 
which facilitated the alteration, contains chalcopyrite, smaller amounts of bornite, molybdenite, 
and some minor pyrite.  Both quartz stockwork and magnetite stockwork are present.   

Lower grade mineralization is found in the volcanic units on the flanks of the Central Porphyry 
Zone.   

The Central Porphyry Zone comprises a series of porphyritic intrusions of medium to fine 
grained dioritic and monzonitic composition that intrude volcanic rocks of the Marquesa 
Formation (Cretaceous), which are strongly brecciated, mineralized and silicified as a 
hornfels unit  The higher grade part of the system has intense potassic alteration, as 
evidenced by intense secondary biotite disseminated and veinlets.  The potassic alteration is 
accompanied by quartz stockwork, and magnetite stockwork.  The higher grade 
mineralization corresponds to chalcopyrite-bornite-molybdenite, in some cases accompanied 
by pyrite.  Samples of mineralization styles are displayed in Figures 7.2_3 to 7.2_6. 
 
The mineralization consists of three main zones: the Central Porphyry Zone, the Cerro de 
Oro Zone (which is located 1km to the south of the Central Porphyry Zone), and the 
Ferrocarril Zone. The surface expression of the Cerro de Oro Zone has been drilled, but the 
underlying intrusive has yet to be tested.  The Cerro de Oro Zone is seen as the stockwork 
cap to a potentially larger porphyry deposit that lies predominantly within volcanic rocks.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

This region in Chile is dominated by Porphyry Cu-Au deposits and to a lesser extent vein type 
and manto type Au deposits.  The economic Cu and Au mineralization occurs most commonly 
in stockwork disseminated mineralization associated with porphyry copper deposits.  
Mineralization also occurs in both veins and, to a lesser extent, mantos, although there are no 
observed mantos across the SHM concessions.  This deposit fits well with the model by 
Sillitoe, as displayed in Figure 8_1.

These Porphyry Cu-Au deposits are hosted in stratified and intrusive rocks, and have a 
mineralogy characterized by chalcopyrite, bornite, specularite, magnetite, pyrite, calcite and 
quartz.  Commonly, the associated alteration is rich in epidote, chlorite, sericite and clay.  In 
general, deposits are of small magnitude, but with significant grades of Cu and Au, which 
have allowed the development of a small small-scale mining.  The main mining districts in the 
area are the Farellón Sanchez Farellón Vasquez Lahuín Plains, El Espino and Llahuín 
Porphyry systems, the latter displaying a strong presence of potassic alteration, given by 
secondary biotite, accompanied by much magnetite, and quartz stockwork.

9 EXPLORATION BY SHM 

Exploration has comprised rock chip sampling, geophysics and drilling.  No updated 
information on surface sampling is presented since the March 2012 resource estimate.  The 
geophysics has also not been updated in this report for the new Ferrocarril Zone.   

9.1 Rock Chip Sampling 

The rock chip sampling has been focussed on a few of the visible veins on the northern 
concessions, and other areas where roads and tracks, that have been easy to construct, have 
been located.  A total of 223 outcrop samples have been collected, however results are not 
presented here, as samples are randomly spaced and not likely to assist in evaluating the 
deposit given their poor spatial representation.  

The policy of drilling, in preference to surface sampling, is wise in the opinion of the author as 
it is likely that most of the higher Cu grades within the Cerro de Oro and Ferrocarril Zones are 
located at some depth below the surface. 

9.2 Geophysics 

There are no additional geophysical surveys presented in this report since May 2012.   

A geophysical survey consisting of ground magnetics and induced polarisation (IP) was 
conducted by Zonge Ingenieria Y Ge Ofisica (Chile) S.A. (Zonge) between September and 
October 2011.  The magnetic survey was conducted on 100m spaced lines and the IP survey 
was conducted on 200m spaced lines.  There was a strong correlation between the IP results 
and mineralization and the predictive geophysical model suggested that drilling to the south-
east of Central Porphyry Zone and at depth is warranted, as displayed in Figure 9.2_1.

10 DRILLING 

10.1 Introduction 

SHM commenced drilling at the Llahuin property in June 2011 and as at 17th August 2012 
had completed a total of 22,445m of RC drilling in 124 holes and 11,367m of DC in 30 holes, 
as summarized below in Table 10.1_1.

The Central Porphyry Zone and the Cerro de Oro Zone have been drilled on a spacing of 50m 
by 50m in the upper portions and 100m x 100m in the lower portions of the deposits.  The drill 
spacing on the Ferrocarril Zone is irregular and is based on accessing opportunistic drill sites 
at present.   

The Ferrocarril Zone is drilled on a widely spaced irregular pattern that makes use of current 
infrastructure.   

RC holes are mostly drilled to an average depth of 200m.  Some RC holes were extended by 
diamond drilling to an average depth of 650m on grid spacing of 100m by 100m.   

10.2 Drilling Procedures 

The drilling has been completed by three drilling companies.  They are HSB Sondajes, 
Geosupply and Raul/Mimoz Ltd.   

The water table is generally encountered between 50m and 190m down hole.  Where the 
water table is encountered, a rotary splitter is used to assist with RC sample quality. 
Approximately sixty percent (60%) of the RC samples are wet.  This issue has been partially 
remediated by more recently drilling more diamond holes.  Duplicated RC data, or old RC 
holes in close proximity to new DC holes, have been removed from the data set used for the 
grade estimate for the Central Porphyry Zone only (Figure 10.2_1). The RC holes removed 
are also presented in Table 10.2_1. This accounts for 3,177m or represents 25% of the RC 
drilling completed to date on the Central Porphyry Zone.   

There is a slight resource grade drop, but significant tonnage increase when these holes are 
removed from the resource.

The twin hole data comparison is inconclusive (Table 10.2_2).  AMS concludes that there is 
insufficient data to make a definitive comparison, and that the twins are sufficiently far enough 
apart to explain some of the grade differences.  AMS recommends that SHM drills 
approximately 10 more twin holes to determine the bias that may exist in the RC holes.

Prior to March 2012, DDH was performed predominantly as tails at the termination of some of 
the RC holes.  DDH performed from April 2012 has been from the surface, although only 3 
twin holes have been completed.   The majority of the new diamond drilling is on the 060° 
orientation. The use of diamond drilling in preference to RC in the modelling is a wise 
approach as now the sample quality in the deposit is of greater confidence.   

The DC recovery is generally greater than 90% and whilst fractured in areas of higher grade 
mineralization, it is generally competent and intact.   

10.3 Drilling Orientation 

Drillholes have been orientated on two main directions (grid): 060° and 300°.  The reasoning 
behind using two drill directions is to ensure that structures which may not outcrop, or may not 
be clear on the surface are tested systematically.  The change in orientation of much of the 
new drilling, since the last resource update in March 2012 has encountered both high and low 
grades in the Central Porphyry Zone.  The author has observed three diamond core holes and 
has reviewed the core photography of all new holes and is confident that the new high grade 
intercepts, post March 2012, are not biased by drilling along specific high grade structures.   

10.4 Surveying Procedures 

10.4.1 Accuracy of Drillhole Collar Locations 

The precision of the standard hand held GPS units is poor in this portion of Chile so a 
licensed surveyor was employed to pick up the new drillhole locations and the topography. 
The survey was performed by Mr. Luciano Alfaro Sanders. The collars picked up to within 
3cm accuracy.  This accuracy was not able to be checked, however the relative positions of 
the drillholes has been confirmed during the site visits. 
 

10.4.2 Down-hole Surveying Procedures 

Some DC holes have been down hole surveyed using a non-magnetic gyroscopic instrument. 
The deviation on these holes is minimal.  The holes tend to deviate to the north by two to

three degrees per hundred metres, and they both steepen and flatten in dip, usually by one to 
two degrees per hundred metres.   

The more recently drilled DC holes have not been downhole surveyed and this needs to be 
remediated in the future.   

RC holes have not been downhole surveyed due to magnetic interference.  RC holes are 
commonly drilled to the west at 60° degrees with lengths between 100m to 200m.   

AMS considers the locations of the drillholes and surface surveys along with the topographic 
survey, to be suitable for a global mineral resource estimate, however the local precision of 
the estimate is likely to be poor given the lack of down hole surveys on the recent diamond 
drillholes.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Sampling Method and Approach 

11.1.1 Diamond Core Sampling 

DC samples are taken on 2m intervals.  In some places, this sample interval overlaps 
lithological contacts, although contacts are hard to determine in places due to pervasive 
alteration.  Drill core has not been orientated for structural measurements.  The core is cut 
lengthways with a diamond saw and half-core is sent for assay.   

The ½ core is bagged every 2m and sent for preparation, while the remaining ½ core is 
returned to the cardboard core box, as displayed in Figure 11.1_1 below.  A wooden lid is 
placed on the box, and it is stored in a weatherproof concrete shed for future reference.   

Blanks and field duplicates are inserted at irregular intervals, at a range of between 1:20 and 
1:50.  All samples are placed in calico bags and then into plastic bags and cable tied.   

Three DC holes were reviewed by the author, with no major recovery issues noted which are 
usually associated with either oxidised or heavily faulted or cavernous ground.  The new core 
photographs, post March 2012, have been reviewed digitally.   

11.1.2 Reverse Circulation Sampling 

RC samples are collected at 1m intervals from RC-LLA-001 to RC-LLA-014 and then 2m 
intervals in RC holes numerically thereafter.  The samples are processed through a rotary 
splitter when wet.  The author has observed the rotary splitter in action, and is satisfied that it 
is an effective sampling device.  The samples are quartered in riffle splitters.  Sub-samples 
weigh approximately 5kg and are collected in calico sample bags.  Blanks and Field 
Duplicates are inserted at irregular intervals of between 1:20 and 1:50.  All samples are 
placed in plastic bags and cable tied.   

11.1.3 Logging 

Diamond core is logged in detail for geological and structural information.  Whole core is 
routinely photographed.  The photographs are generally of high quality and resolution.  DC 
and RC chip logging is conventional and appropriate.   

Core recovery has not been routinely recorded for all drillholes.  Observed core recovery is 
generally 95% or higher and infrequently 70-80% or less.  The lower recoveries occur mainly 
in the heavily faulted zones.  AMS recommends that all core holes have core recoveries 
routinely recorded. 

11.2 Sample Security 

DC is currently transported directly to the Llahuin exploration camp (approximately 1km from 
drilling operations) to the core preparation and storage base.  After logging, core samples are 
marked for splitting and sampling by SHM geologists.  Each core sample is placed in a plastic 
bag for transporting via truck to Andes Analytical Assay Ltda laboratory in Santiago.

Reference material is retained and stored on site, including half-core and photographs 
generated for diamond drilling, and duplicate pulps and residues of all submitted samples.  All 
pulps are stored at the Llahuin exploration camp.

11.3 Sample Preparation and Analysis 

The entire sample preparation and analysis procedure was performed by AAA Ltda 
Laboratory in Santiago, Chile.  The laboratory has been audited by the author, who is satisfied 
that the procedures in place are of high quality.  Sample preparation and analysis procedures 
are: 

• Drying and weighing of whole sample, for between 2 and 24 hours depending upon 
moisture content, at 70 degrees C; 

• Primary crushing of sample to -2mm; 

• Sample homogenization and splitting to a 1kg sub-sample; 

• Pulverization to 80% passing -150 mesh;

• Splitting of pulverized material to 400 gram pulp;   

• Fire assay for Au (1100 degrees C), AAS, if Au is > 3 g/t then the analysis is gravimetric. 
The Quoted detection limit is 0.01 g/t Au;   

• Aqua Regia method of analysis for Cu and Mo.  Quoted detection limit is 0.001% Cu and 
0.001% Mo.   

11.4 Adequacy of Procedures 

The sampling methods, chain of custody procedures, and analytical techniques are all 
considered appropriate and are compatible with accepted industry standards.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Drillhole Database 

The data is housed in a series of spreadsheets.  The higher grade intercepts in the 
spreadsheets were checked by AMS to the original scanned laboratory certificates and no 
issues were found.   

The logging was checked on site and it is relatively consistent, except where there are large 
tracts of strong potassic alteration.  Where there are large tracts of strong potassic alteration it 
can be difficult to differentiate in the core between the volcanics and the porphyry.   

Hard copies of original paper drill logs, daily drill reports, core photos, assay results, and various 
ancillary logging features are stored on site at Llahuin.   

12.2 Analytical Quality Control 

One hundred and thirty nine (139) blanks have been inserted into the sample stream. This is a 
very low proportion of the total samples (1%), although there are no signs of contamination. 
One thousand, three hundred and thirty six (1,336) laboratory standards have been analysed 
in a large variety of Cu and Au grade ranges and there is no apparent bias of any significance. 
SHM should submit commercial standards to ensure that there is no drift in the laboratory 
results as they are dealing with low grade orebodies.   

Four hundred and fifty five (455) field duplicates have been taken, only on RC holes. The 
accuracy for Cu is very good. The accuracy for Au is moderate, although most of the variance 
is in samples below 0.05 g/t Au and this is likely to be a combination of both sample and 
assay error, given the very low grades.   

One hundred and ninety four (194) umpire assays were performed at the request of the author 
due to the non-submission of standards.  The second laboratory chosen was ALS in Santiago.  
The repeatability on Cu is very good with no evidence of drift between laboratories.  There is 
more spread in the Au results, with low grades being slightly lower and higher grades being 
higher at ALS when compared to AAA.   

12.2.1 Field Duplicates 

Field duplicates have only been taken on RC holes.  They have been collected as a sub-split 
of the sample mass at the RC rig by riffle splitting.  The duplicates are taken at irregular 
intervals of approximately one duplicate per hole.   

The precision of the field splits is very good for Cu, as displayed in Figure 12.2.1_1, however 
is poor for Au, particularly below  0.05 g/t, as displayed in Figure 12.2.1_2, although this is a 
function of very low grades, as well as sample and laboratory detection limits.  This variance 
in Au field duplicate grades, at very low grades, is not seen as material to the resource 
estimate.

12.2.2 Blanks 

One hundred and thirty nine (139) blanks have been inserted into the sample stream. This is a 
very low proportion of the total samples (1%), although there are no signs of contamination. 
AMS recommends that the insertion rate for blanks needs to increase dramatically to at least 
3% of total samples submitted. 

Blanks have been inserted in random batches and show no signs of contamination for Cu, as 
displayed in Figure 12.2.2_1, or for Au.

12.2.3 Standards 

One thousand, three hundred and thirty six (1,336) laboratory standards have been analysed 
in a large variety of Cu and Au grade ranges and there is no apparent bias of any significance.  

The standards are inserted by the laboratory and are of multiple grade ranges for Cu and Au. 
All results are acceptable. All data sets display >90% of data having a precision within 10%. 
An example of a medium grade standard is shown in Figure 12.2.3_1. 

AMS strongly recommend that SHM should submit commercial standards to ensure that there 
is no drift in the laboratory results as they are dealing with low grade mineralisation.

12.2.4 Umpire Assays 

One hundred and ninety four (194) umpire assays were performed at the request of the author 
due to the non-submission of standards by SHM.  The second laboratory chosen was ALS in 
Santiago.  The repeatability on Cu (Figure 12.2.4_1) is very good with no evidence of drift 
between laboratories.  There is more spread in the Au results, with low grades being slightly 
lower and higher grades being higher at ALS when compared to AAA.   

AMS recommends that a further 500 umpire analyses are performed, specifically targeting the 
low grade Au assays in the RC holes, and to a lesser degree in the DC holes.

Archimedes method, water-immersion (wax) on 80 core samples. Whilst the total data set is 
low, the results are clustered about the mean for each rocktype.  One high value in the 
Porphyry was cut back to 3.0g/cm3 as it was considered abnormal for this kind of lithology.  
The average values determined for the various lithological domains are within industry 
standard.   

One average bulk density (2.8g/cm3) was used for the mineralised domain as there is little 
variation in bulk density between Volcanics, Porphyry and Monzonite, which all form the base 
lithologies for the mineralised domain. The bulk densities for each rock type are displayed in 
Table 12.3_1.   

AMS recommends for that at least 500 bulk densities are required to form a more reliable 
estimate of the bulk density for this deposit.  This will also allow density/grade relationships to 
be established, which may be of benefit for more accurate grade modelling techniques in the 
future.

12.4 Adequacy of Data 

The blanks, standards and field duplicate data returned display acceptable precision and 
accuracy suitable for mineral resource estimation for Cu, although some questions still exits 
over the adequacy of the Au grade data.  Given the low levels of Au in the estimate, this is not 
seen as material to the project at this stage.   

Future QAQC should be carried out in a more systematic way.  SHM should insert their own 
commercial standards into the sample stream, rather than relying upon laboratories to check 
their own precision.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Introduction 

AMS have estimated the Mineral Resource for the Llahuin Project utilising drilling data as of 
17th August 2012.  All grade estimation was completed using Ordinary Kriging (OK) for Au, Cu 
and Mo.  This estimation approach was considered appropriate based on review of a number 
of factors, including the quantity and spacing of available data, the interpreted controls on 
mineralization, and the style of mineralization. The estimation was constrained within separate 
Cu and Au grade shells which are based on both population statistics and geological controls.   

The mineral resource estimate is based upon 30 diamond holes (11,367m) and 124 RC holes 
(22,445m) with the vast majority of the drilling completed at a spacing of approximately 50m 
by 50m to 100m by 100m in the Central Porphyry and Cerro de Oro Zones.  The Ferrocarril 
Zone is an exploration target and is yet to be systematically drilled.   

14.2 Database  

A spreadsheet was provided for use in modelling (LLAHUIN DATABASE 17-Aug-2012.xlsx)  

The following checks were performed on the spreadsheet: 

• Holes that had no collar data. 

• Overlaps in sample intervals. 

• Gaps in sample intervals. 

• Matching the geological logging length to the hole sample length. 

There were no material errors noted within the database. 

The drillholes were imported Datamine and their locations were compared to the topographic 
surface provided and the match was acceptable.  There was no requirement to make any 
adjustments to the collars of the drillholes.

14.3 Geological Modelling 

The lithological units, as displayed in Figure 14.3_1 were interpreted in cross section and then 
the statistics for each unit were compared for the Llahuin porphyry deposit.  The Cerro de Oro 
Zone is almost entirely located within volcanics so this approach was not required for this 
domain.  The Ferrocarril Zone is purely an exploration target at present, so grade shells were 
constructed without any geological foundation.   

A visual review of the logged alteration found that there was only weak correlation between 
logged alteration intensity and grade. The relationship is moderate between quartz veining 
and grade, and a stronger relationship exists between sulphide percentage and grade.  Time 
did not permit the interpretation of these two features.  It is suggested that this should be 
examined in the future as it may have some impact on estimates.   

A review of the new core and surface exposures confirmed that there is little or no oxidation 
present at surface.   

The porphyry, volcanics, granodioritic dykes, dioritic porphyry and the monzonite were 
grouped together as a single unit named a super-unit, for estimation purposes, which are units 
1, 2, and 4, for the Central Porphyry Zone based on the statistics previously generated in 
March 2012, which are presented in Figure 14.3_3 and 14.3_4 and a review of cross sections.  
It is clear that new data presented between March 2012 and August 2012 makes no material 
difference to these curves or visual observations on cross sections.  The eastern diorite unit, 
unit 3, is almost entirely unmineralised and its position was updated, but grades were not 
estimated.   

Separate 0.10% Cu and 0.10 g/t Au grade shells were then chosen within the super-unit, 
based upon population statistics. The eastern diorite unit was not modelled in this update as it 
is clearly uneconomic.   

The Cerro de Oro Zone and Ferrocarril Zone were also modeled within separate 0.10% Cu 
and 0.10 g/t Au grade shells, mainly for consistency purposes.  There have been no strong 
lithological controls yet established for these zones, with mineralization occurring in Volcanics 
and Porphyry Lithologies.

14.4 Sample Selection and Compositing 

Samples were selected as either inside or outside the relevant Cu or Au grade shell for all 
three zones. 

Compositing was on 2m intervals as this matches the majority of the sampling of the deposit 
as displayed in Figure 14.4_1.  The minimum composite length used was 1 m.  There were no 
residuals.  AMS decided to retain a 2 m composite, rather than a larger composite to mimic 
some of the grade variability often seen in porphyry copper deposits when they reach the 
grade control and mining stage.   

Post compositing, a number of RC holes that are in close proximity to diamond drillholes were 
excluded from the data set used for the grade estimation, as detailed in Table 10.2_1.

14.5 Basic Statistics 

The statistics of each major lithological unit were reviewed as displayed in Figures 14.3_3 to 
14.3_4 and the grouping of units at Central Porphyry Zone has been previously discussed.   

The grade shell of 0.10% Cu was chosen based upon a reasonably clear population break, as 
displayed in Figure 14.5_1 and inspection of the data on cross sections. The grade shell of 
0.10 g/t Au was chosen based upon inspection of data on cross sections. The population 
break for Au is not as clear on log probability plots as it is for Cu.   

An analysis of the data suggests that the use of upper cuts is not warranted as displayed in 
Figures 14.5_2 to 14.5_5.

14.6 Variography 

Robust normal variograms for Cu were generated for the Llahuin Porphyry and Cerro de Oro 
Zones.  The Ferrocarril Zone has insufficient data for variography.  Variograms were 
calculated on the uncut composite files for each zone.   

The nugget for Cu accounts for approximately 20% to 60% of the total variance with 50-75% 
of the variance being encountered within the first 75-100m.  An example of the typical 
variograms generated is displayed in Figure 14.6_1 and 14.6_2.  Total ranges for Cu are in 
the order of 200m.   

The variograms are orientated along the observed strike and dip of each zone. The 
variograms for Au are poor for all zones, when compared to the Cu variograms, and therefore 
the Cu variograms were utilised in the Au estimation.  This is also the case for the Mo 
estimation.

14.7 Block Modelling 

Individual block models for each deposit were generated using Datamine mining software.  A 
parent block size of 5mE x 10mN x 4mRL was selected.  This smaller block size, relative to 
the drill grid, was chosen as it represents a mixture of a likely selective mining unit (SMU) and 
an attempt to mimic grade variability at the grade control stage.  The different directions of 
drilling (060° and 300°) within the Central Porphyry Zone also presents a large amount of 
dense drilling and hence a smaller block size can be justified.   

The cells were sub-blocked on grade shell boundaries only.  All wireframes were checked 
visually to ensure that there was adequate filling with blocks.  The block model parameters 
are shown in Table 14.7_1.  Each block was characterized by a series of attributes, as 
described in the Table 14.7_2.  The summarised extents of all block models are recorded.

14.8 Grade Estimation 

Grade estimation was completed using Ordinary Kriging.  Negative kriging weights were not 
utilised in the estimate.   

The boundaries used for estimation are hard boundaries.  Separate estimates are completed; 
both inside the grade shell and outside the grade shell for Cu and Au.  Mo is estimated inside 
the Cu grade shell.  Variable search parameters were used for each deposit based upon 
variography and data density as displayed in Table 14.8_1.

Ferrocarril 0 0 75 75 75 - -

 
 

 

The following parameters were utilised: 

• The orientation of the search axes is identical to the variogram model orientations.  In 
the case of the Ferrocarril Zone, a clear strike and dip of the mineralization was not 
evident, so an isotropic short range search was applied.   

• The maximum number of composites used for any estimate was restricted to 16. 

• A maximum of 2 composites were utilised from any one drillhole. 

• All estimates were into parent cells and these estimates were discretised down to 5m 
(X) x 5m (Y) x 5m (Z). 

 

14.9 Model Validation 

The model has been validated by reviewing model plots compared to composited data. 

 The checks performed were: 

 Ensuring that the domain codes were honoured during estimation; 

 Ensuring that the composites were honoured during estimation; 

 Ensuring that individual composites did not have undue weight when only a few 
composites were used for an estimate. 

In general, the model honours the data well, as evidenced by Figures 14.9_1 to 14.9_4.

Central Porphyry Zone - Cross Section – Typical Resource Coding  

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
The majority of the 50m by 50m spaced drilling area has been classified as Measured Mineral 
Resource for the Central Porphyry Zone. There are sections of the Cerro de Oro Zone that 
are drilled on a 50m by 50m grid, but this section of the project is not as well understood as 
the Central Porphyry Zone, so the mineral resource classification was limited to Indicated 
Mineral Resource for this area.  The majority of the 100m by 100m spaced drilling area at 
Central Porphyry Zone is classified as Indicated Mineral Resource.  The Inferred Mineral 
Resource is typically projected down dip and along strike a further 50m from the edge of the 
Indicated Mineral Resource as displayed in Figure 14.11_1.   

The Ferrocarril Zone is entirely classified as Inferred Mineral Resource die to the low data 
density at this stage in the evaluation.

24 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

SHM has undertaken a relatively systematic exploration program in the last year that has 
been successful in defining significant mineral resources of copper and gold.  AMS concludes 
that there are no fatal flaws in the current mineral resource estimate.  

25 RECOMMENDATIONS 

25.1 Exploration and Resources 

Drilling and studies completed to date have defined a Measured, Indicated and Inferred 
mineral resource at Llahuin.  The data collected is considered to be of moderate quality and 
suitable for mineral resource estimation. 

AMS makes the following specific recommendations: 

• Continue exploration drilling the strike extensions of all zones 

• To insert standards and more blanks into the sample stream in the field. 

• Advance to a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). 

• A geophysical assessment of the Ferrocarril Zone, followed by a 100m x 100m grid 
drilling pattern over the most prospective areas of this Zone. 

• Drill the Cerro de Oro Zone at depth to test for a potential Porphyry source. 

• To drill at least 10 additional twin DC holes to check the reliability of the wet RC data. 

25.2 Mineral Resource and Evaluation Budget 

SHM has recommended the exploration budget as outlined in Table 26.2_1. AMS considers 
this to be an appropriate level of expenditure on this project.

Llahuin Project 

Proposed Resource and Evaluation Budget 
 

Activity Total (US$) 
Drilling $ 5,000,000 
Assay $ 400,000 
Geophysics $ 400,000 
Geology $ 400,000 
Drill Sites, Vehicles, Setup, Logistics $ 400,000 
Metallurgy $ 150,000 
PEA $ 250,000 
Sub-total $ 7,000,000 

 
 

The proposed expenditure of US$ 7,000,000 in the next year is considered to be consistent 
with the potential of the Llahuin Project and is adequate to cover the costs of the proposed 
programs
