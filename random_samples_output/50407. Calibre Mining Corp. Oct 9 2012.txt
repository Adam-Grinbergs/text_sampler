central Nicaragua in the Siuna and Rosita municipalities of the Región Autónoma del 
Atlántico Norte and are currently 100% owned by CXB Nicaragua, S.A., which is a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Calibre Mining Corp. (Calibre).  The "Mining Triangle" of 
Nicaragua is estimated to have had historical production totalling more than 5 Moz of 
gold, 4 Moz of silver, 158,000 st of copper, and 106,000 st of zinc (Arengi, et al. 
2003). 

The Property is centred at 14° 00' north latitude and 84° 30' west longitude and 
consists of six exploration and five exploitation concessions.  This technical report 
deals with two of the concessions, Riscos de Oro (an exploitation concession) and 
Rosita H-2 (an exploration concession), which are owned 100% by Calibre and are 
not subject to an option agreement between Calibre and B2Gold Corp. (B2Gold) or 
Calibre and Alder Resources Ltd. (Alder Resources). 

In December 2010, Calibre commissioned Tetra Tech Wardrop (Tetra Tech) to 
complete a resource estimate and technical report on the Riscos de Oro Project (the 
Project) upon completion of their diamond drill program in 2011.  The resource 
estimation was based on diamond drillholes completed up to the end of 2011.  This 
technical report complies with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in 
National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, 
Companion Policy 43-101CP, and Form 43-101F.

The Property is regionally underlain by the Chortis Block, which consists of phyllites 
and mica schists.  The Chortis Block is unconformably overlain by Mesozoic 
stratigraphy represented by limestone, mudstone, greywacke, and calcareous 
mudstone, with lesser andesite tuff and flows, of the Early Cretaceous Todos Santos 
Formation.  Cenozoic aged volcanic rocks of calc-alkaline, high-alumina basalts, and 
basaltic andesites composition, are extensively exposed in the vicinity of the 
concessions.  The Cenozoic volcanics are overlain by regionally extensive Miocene 
ignimbrites and by mid-Miocene to Pliocene mafic flows. 

A series of intrusive bodies extend northeasterly through northeastern Nicaragua, 
including the concession areas.  Age dating of the intrusions suggests ages from 
Cretaceous to Tertiary.  The intrusives consist of fine- to medium-grained diorite, 
granodiorite, syenite, monzonite and alaskite stocks, plugs and dykes.

1 .1.1 RISCOS DE ORO 

The Riscos de Oro vein system is hosted in a sequence of andesite tuffs and 
porphyritic andesites.  The system generally trends 225° and dips to the northwest at 
45 to 80°.  The interpreted strike length of the system totals 665 m and to a depth of 
approximately 350 m vertical.  The top 85 m of the Upper Zone has been mined by 
open pit and underground mining methods. 

A weak to moderate propylitic alteration in the form of chlorite, sericite, clay, rare 
epidote and calcite observed outside of the vein and breccia system.  Weak to strong 
silicification is generally restricted to fragments of andesite contained within the vein 
and in a narrow zone less than 2 to 3 m wide about the vein. 

Chalcedonic to porcelanic and locally comb-textured veins (5 to 15 mm) and vein 
arrays are commonly with Riscos de Oro system.  A typical vein intersection consists 
of several discrete low sulphidation style epithermal veins separated by short 
intervals of quartz stockwork brecciated and silicified flow facies andesite.  Individual 
veins range from 0.95 to 4.25 m wide and in combination with associated silicified 
stockwork zones can reach widths up to 25 m. 

The presence of other epithermal veins or a feeder system has not been identified 
within the concession.  This is likely due to the orientation of the drilling and the lack 
of outcrop exposure. 

The resource estimate for the Project is supported by 37 diamond drillholes. 

1 . 2  C O N C L U S I O N S  

The Property comprises a land package in the historical Bonanza, La Luz, and 
Rosita mining camps of northeast Nicaragua.  The Project displays classic low 
sulphidation epithermal characteristics.  The geological dataset generated by Calibre, 
consisting of data derived from diamond drilling conducted by several operators, has 
been deemed suitable to support geological interpretation and resource estimation at 
both Riscos de Oro. 

The Riscos de Oro mineral resource was developed on two parallel, gold-bearing 
zones at a gold equivalent (Aueq) cut-off grade of 0.6 g/t gold, and contains an 
Inferred Resource of approximately 2.2 Mt with an average grade of 3.20 g/t gold and 
59.67 g/t silver (Table 1.1).

It is Tetra Tech's opinion that additional exploration expenditures are warranted.  
Two separate exploration programs are proposed.  Each can be carried out 
concurrently and independently of each other, and neither is contingent on the 
results of the other. 

1.3.1 PHASE 1 RISCOS DE ORO EXTENSION 

Phase 1 is designed primarily to expand the current resource for the Project by 
testing the strike and dip extension of the deposit.  This will entail diamond drilling 
with additional work on metallurgical testing, rock mechanics, and surveying. 

The drilling campaign should be designed to target the potential strike extensions of 
the Project, particularity the northeast.  Drillhole spacing should continue at 
approximately 50 m along section and 50 to 75 m vertically on section in order to 
support an Inferred Resource. 

The proposed budget for Phase 1 is estimated at $950,000. 

1.3.2 PHASE 2 RISCOS DE ORO DELINEATION 

Phase 2 is designed to delineate the resource for the Project by infilling of the 
deposit and providing the level of detail to conduct a preliminary economic 
assessment (PEA).  This will entail a diamond drilling program, addition metallurgical 
testing, other technical studies, and environmental base lining. 

The proposed budget for Phase 2 is estimated at $2.5 million. 

1.3.3 OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS 

The following recommendations will assist in moving the Project forward: 

 The insertion location of the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) 
blanks should be adjusted to allow the control samples to be placed within or 
immediately after mineralized intervals.  This will be a better use of the 
control samples as they are designed to monitor the preparation facility.

 For future drilling programs, collect specific gravity measurements for the 
various rock types and alteration styles.  Approximately 4 to 5% of the 
database should have a specific gravity measurement.  This will allow for a 
more accurate calculation of the tonnage in the subsequent resource 
estimate. 

 Consider conducting a preliminary metallurgical test using drill core or 
course rejects, to determine the global recoveries that maybe expected from 
the deposit. 

 Establish a method in which to drill test the upper portion of the Lower Zone 
that is hidden by the mined out section of the Upper Zone. 

 Explore for additional vein swarms with in the concession, as low-
sulphidation epithermal vein systems rarely occur as individual veins.

The Property is located in north central Nicaragua in the Rosita municipality of the 
Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte and is currently 100% owned by CXB 
Nicaragua, S.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Calibre. 

In December 2010, Calibre commissioned Tetra Tech to complete a resource 
estimate and technical report on the Riscos de Oro concession upon competition of 
their diamond drill program in 2011.  The resource estimation was based on diamond 
drillholes completed on the Property to the end of 2010. 

The object of the technical report is to: 

 compile historical work and activities on the Property 

 generate a resource estimate on the Riscos de Ore deposit 

 summarizing all land tenures, exploration history, drilling, and resource 
estimates 

 provide recommendations and budget for additional work on the Project. 

This report has been compiled in accordance with NI 43-101, Companion Policy 43-
101CP, and Form 43-101F1. 

All the data files that were reviewed for the report were provided by Calibre in digital 
format, and access to paper reports and logs was granted when requested.  Calibre 
made its own work available and compiled historical work conducted by previous 
operators on the Project. 

The primary author of this report is Todd McCracken, P. Geo., who is a Professional 
Geologist with 20 years of experience in exploration and operations, including 
several years working in epithermal and replacement gold deposits.  Mr. McCracken 
visited the Project from February 7 to 11, 2011 inclusive and was accompanied by 
Mr. Adrian Newton, Senior Project Geologist for Calibre.  Mr. McCracken again 
visited the Property from August 8 to 11, 2012 inclusive and was accompanied by

In Nicaragua, concessions are demarcated by east-west and north-south lines as 
defined by Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates (North American 
Datum (NAD)-27).  Annual payments are required for maintenance of exploration and 
mining concessions.  Prior to enactment of Nicaragua's Law 387 of 2001, both 
exploration and exploitation concessions were granted by the government; after 
2001, mineral concessions with rights for both exploration and exploitation were 
granted.  For mineral concessions granted after 2001, the annual payments are

and 10 and US$12.00/ha for every year thereafter.  Exploitation concessions, which 
predate Nicaragua's Law 387 of 2001, require payments of US$2.00/ha in Years 1 
and 2, US$4.00/ha in Years 3 and 4 and US$8.00/ha for every year thereafter.  Both 
exploitation and mineral concessions are granted for a term of 25 years and can be 
renewed for an additional 25 years.  Artisanal miners are permitted to conduct hand 
mining on concessions held by others, but artisanal miners not already active by 
2001 are limited to a maximum of 1% of the concession area and their activities are 
regulated by the Ministerio de Fomento, Industria y Comercio (MIFIC). 

The concessions that comprise the Property are held by CXB Nicaragua, S.A., and 
Calibre Mining Nicaragua, S.A., wholly owned subsidiaries of Calibre.  In May 2009, 
Calibre purchased the NEN concessions (later named Borosi) from Yamana Gold 
Inc. (Yamana) for a price of Cdn$7.0 million, consisting of 12 million shares of 
Calibre and Cdn$4.42 million in cash.  Calibre is obligated until July 2014 to make a 
bonus payment of Cdn$5 per gold equivalent ounce to Yamana, capped at Cdn$3.5 
million, for newly-reported NI 43-101 Measured or Indicated Resources outlined 
within the original NEN concession boundaries.  The bonus payment, at Calibre's 
discretion, may be paid in cash or shares of Calibre.  Yamana also received five 
million Calibre warrants exercisable at Cdn$0.50/share and five million Calibre 
warrants exercisable at Cdn$1.00/share until July 2014; these warrants will only be 
exercisable if Calibre delineates at least 2.5 million gold equivalent ounces in a 
NI 43-101-compliant Measured and Indicated Resource.  Also included in the 
Property area, but are not subject to these purchase terms, are the Asa and Pispis 
concessions that were granted to Calibre in 2010.  On May 10, 2012 Calibre 
amended the terms of the share purchase agreement with Yamana.  Under the terms 
of the Amending Agreement, Calibre is no longer required to pay the bonus payment 
and in return Calibre agreed to apply to the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) Venture 
Exchange for a re-pricing of the bonus warrants to $0.25 per share. In addition, 
Calibre agreed to remove the vesting condition and all the bonus warrants shall be 
immediately exercisable. The Property is not subject to any royalties or back-in 
rights, other than the 3% net smelter return (NSR) royalty payable to the Nicaraguan 
government, as dictated by law. 

In June 2009, Calibre granted an option to B2Gold to earn a 51% interest in all of the 
Property concessions by completing Cdn$8 million in exploration expenditures by 
July 1, 2012.  In October 2010, after exploration expenditures of Cdn$2.9 million, the 
option agreement with B2Gold was revised to cover 322 km2 from the original 
710 km2 concession area.  B2Gold may earn a 51% interest in the Property that 
remain in the option agreement by completing Cdn$8 million in exploration 
expenditures by July 2014.  B2Gold may elect to carry an individual prospect within 
the amended concession area through to a prefeasibility study for an additional 14% 
interest in the prospect.  Calibre retains a 100% interest in concessions that fall 
outside the area of this agreement, including the Riscos de Oro exploitation and 
Rosita H-2 exploration concessions that host the Riscos de Oro deposit.

Alder Resources signed an option agreement with Calibre in August 2011 to earn a 
65% interest in the Rosita D concession by expending $4 million on exploration and 
issuing Calibre 1 million common shares of Alder Resources over four years.  Alder 
Resources was designated as operator for the Project.  Calibre retains a 100% 
interest in concessions that fall outside the area of this agreement, including the 
Riscos de Oro exploitation and Rosita H-2 exploration concessions that host the 
Riscos de Oro deposit. 

Calibre owns surface rights to several parcels of land within the Property, covering 
the inactive pits and sites of some of the surface infrastructure related to the La Luz 
(Siuna) and Rosita (Santa Rita and R-13) mines.  Since the nationalization of the La 
Luz and Rosita mines in 1979, the towns of Siuna and Rosita have grown up around 
the former mine sites, and surface rights formerly controlled by the mines have 
gradually passed into private hands.  Surface rights throughout the remainder of the 
Property are privately held, with the exception of a few indigenous communities 
which hold their land communally. The Property borders two Forest Reserves, Cerro 
Cola Blanca to the north and Banacruz to the south (Figure 4.2). 

There has been significant surface disturbance by past mining activities in several 
parts of the Property.  It is believed that Calibre, as the current concession owner, is 
not liable for the effects of mining and exploration prior to the privatization of the 
concessions in 1994.  This liability has been accepted by the government of 
Nicaragua.  Calibre is only responsible for any environmental disturbances generated 
through the exploration activities conducted by Calibre. 

Prior to any type of mineral exploration, an environmental permit is required from the 
Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte.  An exploration plan with proposed field work, 
time-line and cost estimate must be submitted to the Secretaria de Recursos Natural 
(SERENA) of the Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte.  An independent 
environmental impact study and public consultations are required for programs with 
significant ground disturbance, such as trenching or drilling.  Tetra Tech has been 
informed that the Riscos de Oro exploitation concession and the Rosita H-2 
exploration concession are currently permitted to allow for additional drilling and 
trenching (Table 4.2).

The Property lies within Nicaragua's Atlantic coastal plain and is characterized by flat 
to hummocky terrain reaching and elevation of 50 to 100 masl and is crossed by 
numerous dirt trails and roads.  Small subsistence type farms are common through 
the area and separated by heavy second-growth jungle and swamps.  Numerous 
small creeks which cross the area provide seasonal water for drilling and eventually 
feed into the much larger Okonwas River to the west. 

Northeast Nicaragua is covered by lowland humid tropical forest, much of which has 
been converted to pasture land on the Property (Figure 5.1).

The Property is located 230 air kilometres northeast of Managua and 100 air 
kilometres west of the Caribbean port town of Puerto Cabezas.  There are two main 
population centres within the concession, Siuna and Rosita.  A third town, Bonanza, 
lies near the centre of the Property, but not within it. 

Each of these towns has a population of 10,000 to 20,000.  Ground access to the 
area and each of the three towns is provided by unpaved roads from the south, east 
and west.  The southern and western access roads connect Siuna to Matagalpa, 
Nicaragua's fifth-largest city, a distance of approximately 140 km. 

Currently, it takes about seven hours to drive from Managua to Siuna.  From Siuna, 
this road extends eastward through Rosita to Puerto Cabezas on the Caribbean Sea.  
Another road connects Rosita and Bonanza.  Aside from the principal unpaved 
roads, the area is traversed by a series of dirt tracks and footpaths, some accessible 
by four-wheel drive truck, that connect outlying villages and farms. 

All three communities have daily scheduled flights to Managua with La Costeña, a 
commercial airline. 

The Project is located 20 km northeast of the town of Rosita and is accessed by an 
all-weather road with a one-way travel time of approximately one hour.  Following the 
principal road 15 km east from Rosita towards Puerto Cabezas, the village of 
Empalme de Wasminona demarks the entrance for the local toll road to Riscos de 
Oro.  The local communities maintain this road and charge a toll of 20 Cordobas per 
round trip, charged when exiting at the Empalme de Wasminona gate access.  The 
area surrounding the historic Riscos de Oro mine is accessible by all-wheel drive 
vehicle during the dry season and by foot on numerous trails through the rest of the 
year. 

5 . 3  C L I M A T E  

The area undergoes a dry season from December to May and a rainy season from 
June to November.  The transition between the two seasons varies slightly from year 
to year and across the Property.  The rainy season is marked by generally clear 
mornings and daily cloudbursts in the afternoon.  Fieldwork is possible throughout 
the year, with access generally being easier from November to June. 

5 . 4  I N F R A S T R U C T U R E  

The towns of Siuna, Bonanza and Rosita have municipal water systems serviced by 
reservoir, although water for industrial use and drilling is limited in the dry season.  
Abundant water for drilling purposes at the Project can be obtained year round from 
the flooded pit at the historic Riscos de Oro mine.

Siuna, Bonanza and Rosita have recently been connected to the national electricity 
grid.  Intermittent power failures are common, and generator backups are 
recommended.  A hydroelectric facility on the Río Way at El Salto, approximately 
25 km northeast of Siuna, provided ample power for the La Luz and Rosita mines 
and communities before failing in 1968 due to heavy rain fall. 

Telephone service is provided by landline to Siuna, Bonanza and Rosita through the 
national telephone company, ENEL.  A number of companies also currently provide 
cellular and satellite communication services across the Property. 

Aside from mining, the principal economic activities in the area are logging, small-
scale farming, ranching and service industries.  The towns were built to support the 
formerly active mines, and their population would provide a good supply of unskilled 
and semi-skilled labour, as well as heavy equipment and supplies.

The exploration and mining history are summarized from Arengi (2003) and 
Hendrickson (1995). 

The recorded history of the region is not well documented as numerous records were 
destroyed initially in the early 1980s during the Nicaraguan Civil war and secondly by 
a fire at the Yamana office in Siuna in 2008.

Over the last 90 years, Riscos de Oro has sustained a variety of exploration and 
exploitation programs, highlighted by one main period of production followed by 
erratic exploration.  Historical records indicate that the mine has produced over 
36,200 oz gold and 2,402,000 oz silver (0.551 Mt at 2.49 g/t gold and 164.62 g/t 
silver.

The reader is cautioned that Table 6.1 discloses historical resources and reserves.  
The current author considers the preceding historical estimate to be relevant but not 
necessarily reliable.  It is not known what the equivalent Canadian Institute of Mining, 
Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM) resource categories would be in each case. 

These historic estimates would require a verification program of drillhole twinning, 
and re-sampling to upgrade or verify the historical estimate as a current mineral 
resource.  A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical 
estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.  Calibre is not treating 
the historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.

Nicaragua is underlain by the Chortis block of the Caribbean plate.  Basement rocks 
in the Chortis block are dominantly phyllites and mica schists which are 
unconformably overlain by Mesozoic stratigraphy (Sundblad 1991).  The Mesozoic 
stratigraphy is represented by limestone, mudstone, greywacke and calcareous 
mudstone, with lesser andesite tuff and flows, of the Early Cretaceous Todos Santos 
Formation.  Around the projects, the Todos Santos Formation is exposed as a series 
of northeast trending isolated windows within pre-Tertiary and Tertiary volcanics and 
intrusives (Arengi 2003) (Figure 7.1).

Subduction of the Farallon and later the Cocos plates beneath the Caribbean plate 
along the Middle America Trench, southwest of Nicaragua, resulted in extensive 
accumulation of Cenozoic volcanic rocks (Donnelly 1990).  The volcanic rocks are 
dominated by calc-alkaline, high-alumina basalts and basaltic andesites, with locally 
important ignimbrites of rhyolitic to andesitic composition.  The Matagalpa Formation 
is a widespread, but poorly defined Oligocene to mid-Miocene volcanogenic 
formation composed of rhyodacite and rhyolite flows and tuffs, andesitic flows and 
tuffs, basalt and lesser epiclastic material, and is extensively exposed in the vicinity 
of the Project.  The Matagalpa Formation is overlain by regionally extensive Miocene 
ignimbrites (Tamarindo Formation) and by mid-Miocene to Pliocene mafic flows of 
the Coyol Group; these are exposed mainly in a northwest-trending band east of 
Lake Nicaragua.  Pliocene and younger volcanism has shifted southwest toward the 
Pacific coastline, where several volcanoes are currently active. 

A series of intrusive bodies extend northeasterly through northeastern Nicaragua, 
including the Project areas.  Limited age dating suggests the oldest of these are 
Cretaceous; however there is field evidence that some of them are Tertiary in age.  
The intrusives consist of fine- to medium-grained diorite, granodiorite, syenite, 
monzonite and alaskite stocks, plugs and dykes.  Most of these intrusives occur 
along a northeast trend similar to the distribution of the sedimentary rocks (Arengi 
2003). 

Northeastern Nicaragua has been subjected to a variety of compressional and 
extensional events.  One of the earliest structural elements is folding about north-
trending axes in the Cretaceous sediments.  Tertiary-age extensional tectonics 
produced numerous northeast-trending faults, veins and magnetic/ topographic 
lineaments on the Project.

7.2.1 GEOLOGY 

The Riscos de Oro vein system is hosted within a repeated sequence of Matagalpa 
Group andesite volcanics which contains seven distinct units.  Based on drilling data, 
the stratigraphic sequence appears to be repeated between six to ten times through 
the tested part of the vein system.  The sequence transitions from fragmental 
dominant facies near surface and towards the northwest through to coherent flow 
facies at greater depths.  Deeper sections most recently drill tested by Calibre are 
dominantly composed of vent-proximal flows with some interspersed hypabyssal 
intrusions reflective of a main locus of magmatism.  The contacts within the 
sequence are gradational and often blend subtly into one another. Low topographic 
relief and thus poor surface exposure through the area means many of these units 
have not been observed at surface.  The encountered units are described below and 
shown in Figure 7.2.

COARSELY PORPHYRIT IC  ANDESITE (DIKES) 

The unit is medium grey to maroon in colour and is characterized by up to 70% 
plagioclase phenocrysts to 2 cm long set in an aphanitic andesite matrix.  Calcite-
filled vugs and amygdales to 1 cm are common and often have fine chlorite rims.  
Sharp chill margins are always observed over 5 to 10 cm.  Data show that the unit is 
always intersected near the bottom of drillholes and proximal to the main vein 
system.  The lack of intersections with this unit at shallower levels suggests it may 
indeed lie parallel to the volcanic strata (sill?) and could be used as a marker unit. 

ANDESITE VOLCANIC  (FLOW TOP)  BRECCIA 

A very poorly-sorted, clast-supported unit characterized by angular to sub-angular 
pebbles and cobbles (with rare boulders) of porphyritic ± amygdaloidal andesite set 
in a fine-grained hematitic ash matrix.  Hematite alteration in clasts ranges from 
moderate on surfaces to weak/trace within several centimetres of the clast surface.  
The hematitic character is believed to be a product of de-gassing of the volcanic pile 
as it cooled in a sub aerial environment.  The lower contact appears gradational and 
blends subtly in an andesite scoria flow breccias.

ANDESITE SCORIACEOUS FLOW BRECCIA 

A moderately sorted, clast-supported breccia unit characterized by sub-angular 
pebbles and cobbles (with rare boulders) of porphyritic ± amygdaloidal andesite and 
scoria set in a scoriaceous/porphyritic andesite matrix.  Small cavities are common in 
the matrix and are usually filled with calcite.  Although the unit is common, it is not 
present in every volcanic sequence encountered in drilling.  The upper and lower 
contacts are gradational. 

PORPHYRIT IC  ± AMYGDALOIDAL ANDESITE 

The unit is medium grey-green-brown and is characterized by plagioclase 
phenocrysts 1 to 15 mm long and 5 to 20% abundance set in a fine-grained 
groundmass of andesitic composition.  Alignment of plagioclase phenocrysts through 
sections of the unit provides pseudo-bedding information.  Parts of the unit can be 
weakly to moderately hematized, especially in areas of abundant fracturing.  The 
contacts of the unit are usually gradational over less than a metre but are sharp in 
some instances. 

In close proximity to major faults and the vein system, the unit commonly contains 
elongate 0.5 to 10 mm amygdales of 5 to 15% abundance filled with calcite or quartz.  
Chlorite is a common alteration product contained within or as rims about the 
amygdales.  The presence of amygdales within a flow unit has proven to be a good 
indicator of proximity to the vein system/areas of concentrated fluid flow. 

APHANIT IC  ANDESITE 

The unit is medium-dark grey in colour, fine-grained of uniform texture and can 
contain hornblende phenocrysts to 1 mm in diameter and 3% abundance.  Fractures 
commonly have hematitic halos that extend 2 to 4 cm into the surrounding rock. 
Stratigraphically, the unit lies beneath the porphyritic andesites at the bottom of the 
volcanic sequence.  The unit is not always observed but likely represents the most 
central and coherent phase of flow volcanism. 

RE-WORKED ANDESITE TUFF 

A poorly sorted, clast-supported unit characterized by pebble to cobble-sized sub-
rounded to rounded clasts of intermediate to mafic composition set in a fine-grained 
tuffaceous matrix.  The clasts are dominantly andesitic in composition and range 
from medium to dark grey-green aphanitic to green-brown equigranular porphyritic 
with plagioclase phenocrysts 2 to 3 mm and 10%; rare clasts are hematitic.  
Occasional light grey dacitic clasts containing 4% plagioclase to 2 mm have also 
been observed.  The matrix is medium grey-green in colour and composed of fine-
grained andesite tuff containing minor plagioclase crystals to 1 mm and 1 to 2%.  
There is no apparent stratification of the clasts or the matrix material.  The upper 
contact of the unit is poorly defined and often coincident with zones of fracturing or 
faulting while the lower contact is usually quite sharp.

ANDESITE ASH 

A well-sorted unit characterized by very fine-grained volcanic ash of andesitic 
composition displaying massive to laminated textures.  The unit is maroon to dark 
grey in colour and on occasion contains rare small andesite volcanic fragments to 
1 cm diameter.  The unit is generally encountered at the bottom of the stratigraphic 
sequence beneath the re-worked andesite tuff unit.  Historic reports suggest this unit 
has also been encountered interspersed within units the volcanic sequence 
described above; this has not been observed by Calibre personnel to date. 

7.2.2 STRUCTURE 

Historic data from surface and underground development at the Riscos de Oro mine 
shows that the vein has an average orientation of 233/60 through the length of the 
workings and follows a well-defined fault system.  Over short distances, the vein is 
oriented towards 225°, apparently a result of interaction with numerous faults that dip 
45 to 80° towards the northwest resulting in more complex styles of mineralization 
(Lehman 1981).  The overall orientation agrees well with strike measurements taken 
from small veins located at surface near the old open pit.  The system has been 
traced over a 2 km strike length on the Riscos de Oro concession and to a depth of 
300 m below surface using drilling (still open along strike and down dip). 

Based on measurements of contacts and bedding surfaces in drill core and on cross 
section interpretation, lithologic units appear to roughly parallel the vein system, 
striking to the southwest and dipping 50° to 60° towards the northwest.  Although it is 
unusual to see an epithermal vein parallel stratigraphic units there exists the 
possibility that a perpendicular feeder vein system remains as of yet unidentified.  
Historic and recent drillholes have been oriented in such a manner that they would 
not have tested for a potential feeder vein system with northwest trend. 

7.2.3 ALTERATION 

Surface mapping indicates that the Riscos de Oro mine area is dominated by deep 
weathering with associated goethite, limonite, hematite and manganese oxide in 
addition to strong argillic (kaolinite/illite) alteration.  Relict fresh feldspar phenocrysts 
are sericite-altered, although for the most part, the secondary sericite is replaced by 
clay.  Immediately northwest of the mine area, weathering is less pronounced in 
subcrop and float, and alteration is characterized by chloritization of hornblende and 
silicification of groundmass material.  Hematite is also noted in groundmass material 
as is trace epidote and pyrite. 

In drill core, weak to moderate propylitic alteration is most common with chlorite, 
sericite, clay, rare epidote and calcite observed.  Pervasiveness and intensity appear 
largely controlled by fracturing and faulting with weaker units containing stronger and 
more widespread alteration.  The andesite flow breccia and scoria breccia units are 
more frequently altered than are the more coherent porphyritic and aphanitic units.  
Chlorite alteration is characterized by discontinuous fracture fillings, halos about

veinlets and rims about vugs and amygdales.  Sections of more concentrated fluid 
flow contain more continuous styles of alteration to sericite and clay but again are 
mostly restricted to fractures and faulted zones.  Calcite is noted in the more 
permeable matrix portions of units and as fillings of vesicles and vugs.  Propylitic 
altered rocks generally do not contain notable mineralization. 

Weak to strong silicification is generally restricted to fragments of andesite contained 
within the vein and in a narrow zone less than 2 to 3 m wide about the vein.  Quartz 
stockwork veining is commonly observed for several metres about the vein and is 
more intense in the footwall.  Moderate to strong hematite alteration of andesite 
fragments has also been observed within the breccia and stock work zones that 
surround the veins.  Silicified rocks within and about the vein contain elevated 
geochemical signatures but are generally uneconomic. 

7 . 3  M I N E R A L I Z A T I O N  

Chalcedonic to porcelanic and locally comb-textured veins (5 to 15 mm) and vein 
arrays are commonly observed near the surface projection of the Riscos de Oro vein.  
Due to overall poor surface exposure, most observations regarding the character of 
veins and style of mineralization have been obtained from drill core.  A typical vein 
intersection consists of several discrete low sulphidation style epithermal veins 
separated by short intervals of quartz stockwork brecciated and silicified flow facies 
andesite.  Individual veins range from 0.95 to 4.25 m wide and in combination with 
associated silicified stockwork zones can reach widths up to 25.30 m (RD10-009). 

Quartz is fine-grained to microcrystalline and ranges from white to light grey to light 
green in colour.  Grey colouration is a result of very-fine grained disseminated 
sulphides (pyrite) while green colouration is related to the presence of fine-grained 
chlorite.  Observed textures include: massive, saccharoidal, drusy, banded and 
colloform.  Brecciation is common, particularly in sections with banded and colloform 
quartz; late quartz infill shows there were at least two episodes of veining in the 
system (Figure 7.3).  The banded and colloform styles of veining are the most 
significant in the system. 

Sulphide concentration through the veins is generally less than 5%.  Disseminated 
pyrite (FeS2), banded sulphosalts and rare sphalerite ((Zn, Fe)S) and galena (PbS) 
have been observed.  Two narrow sections of vein also contained native gold and 
electrum (RD10-001, RD10-009). Euhedral grains of native copper have been 
observed in several narrow, high-level quartz-epidote veins (RD10-005, RD10-009) 
and may represent a separate vein event than is observed in the main workings.  
Workers from Lehman (1981) also report encountering chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), 
bornite (Cu5FeS4), pyrargyrite (Ag3SbS3), argentite (Ag2S) and native silver through 
much of the underground mine.

Low sulphidation epithermal deposits are precious metal-bearing quartz veins, 
stockworks and breccias which formed from boiling of volcanic-related hydrothermal 
systems (Figure 8.1).  Emplacement of mineralization is generally restricted to within 
1 km of the paleosurface (Panteleyev 1996).  Veins typically have strike lengths in 
the range of hundreds to thousands of metres; productive vertical extent is seldom 
more than a few hundred metres.  Vein widths vary from a few centimetres to metres 
or tens of metres. 

Gangue mineralogy is dominated by quartz and/or chalcedony, accompanied by 
lesser and variable amounts of adularia, calcite, pyrite, illite, chlorite and 
rhodochrosite. 

Vein mineralogy is characterized by gold, silver, electrum and argentite with variable 
amounts of pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena, tellurides, rare tetrahedrite and 
sulphosalt minerals.  Crustiform banded quartz veining is common, typically with 
interbanded layers of sulphide minerals, adularia and/or illite. 

Regional structural control is important in localization of low sulphidation epithermal 
deposits.  Higher grades are commonly found in dilational zones, in faults, at 
flexures, splays and in cymoid loops.

Calibre has completed several phases of exploration work on the Project including 
geologic mapping, the collection of 36 rock samples and 720 soil samples, 
excavation of trenches and the flying of a high-resolution LiDAR topographic survey. 

Mapping and rock sampling was initially completed by Calibre personnel late in 2009.  
Following this, a soil-sampling program was completed along the strike length of the 
Riscos de Oro vein system in early 2011.  A regional soil investigation was 
completed in outlying areas in mid-2012 following up on LiDAR generated targets. 

9.1.1 ROCK SAMPLING  

Samples are taken either by chip or grab sampling styles, and placed inside the 
bags, which are then sealed with plastic ties. 

When chip sampling, small chips are taken evenly from the entire outcrop.  In the 
case where a defined structure is found, the sample is taken across the structure, at 
an angle perpendicular to the structure trend. 

When grab sampling, larger sample pieces are taken randomly from the areas of 
greater interest (or greater potential for mineralization) in the outcrop. 

9.1.2 SOIL  SAMPLING 

Soil samples are taken using an auger device.  Depending on the deposit model 
target, soil lines are typically spaced between 100 to 200 m apart and samples are 
spaced 20 to 100 m apart. 

Whenever possible, the sample is taken at a maximum depth of 1.2 m, from the last 
three auger loads.  These are placed in two separate paper bags, which are attached 
to each other by a pre-labeled flagging tape.  Each sample is then put inside a new, 
plastic bag and sealed in the same way as rock samples.  Samples are identified 
with a combination of Line No + Station No. 

The auger is thoroughly cleaned after each sample to avoid contamination. 

All soil and rock sample locations and descriptions are collected in the field using 
mobile mapper units.  The trench data is recorded manually in paper formats, and it 
is later entered by the sampling geologist into an online access database template.

The mobile mapper data is downloaded every day to the office server.  All the data is 
checked for accuracy, which are readily corrected in ArcMap or in the Microsoft 
Access® database.  After checking the data, the database manager exports it to 
Datashed™, where the master database is stored and managed. 

9.1.3 TRENCHING 

Six trenches totalling 86.90 m were excavated during November and December of 
2009 testing an inferred epithermal vein system located 300 m northwest of and 
parallel to the Riscos de Oro vein system.  The accompanying table summarizes the 
details and results of the trenching program (Table 9.1).

The trenches were hand dug to an average depth of 1 to 2 m and a width of 2 m.  
Chip samples were taken by chiseling a continuous channel on the trench wall 
approximately 10 to 20 cm from the floor.  The minimum sampling interval was 0.5 m 
and the maximum was 1.9 m.  A similar QA/QC program as applied in the diamond 
drilling program was used during the trenching program.  All trenches were fully 
reclaimed in early 2010. 

Chip channel samples are taken by chiseling a channel on the northern trench wall, 
10 to 20 cm from the floor.  The minimum sampling interval is 0.5 m and the 
maximum interval is 1.5 m.  The sample intervals are previously marked, trying to 
zone veins, structures, of mineralized ore bodies intercepted by the trench. 

In the case of saw channel sampling, a channel is "cut" on the floor of the trench, 
perpendicular to the main structure, or any mineralized zone with a defined trend.  
The rock saw is thoroughly cleaned after each sample to avoid contamination. 

For all rock and trench duplicate samples, a larger amount of material is taken for 
each sample, which is split in half and the split is placed in a separate bag.  Duplicate 
samples are labeled with a consecutive higher number relative to the original sample. 

Figure 9.1 shows the location of the collected rock and soil samples as well as the 
trench locations.

9.1.4 SURFACE SAMPLE HANDLING AND SAMPLING PROCEDURES 

For all surface and trench samples, sample IDs are clearly written on each sample 
bag prior to going to the field. The sample IDs are also written on flagging tape tags 
which are inserted in each sample bag.  All bags are new, transparent plastic bags. 

Sample shipments are prepared and sent to Managua once a week.  In the case of 
soils, samples are organized based on the Line/Station No sequence, and then they 
are randomized and a Sample ID is assigned to each sample using the format 
B12S####.  In the case of rocks, the sample IDs are the same as those recorded 
during sampling. 

All sample bags are placed in order of numbered sequence and placed into rice 
bags.  Each rice bags holds approximately 25 kg of weight, and it is previously 
labeled with the sample range, customs broker information, laboratory name, and 
addresses. 

The laboratory submittal form is completed by the QA/QC supervisor and authorized 
by the Project Manager, or the person designated for this purpose.  The laboratory is 
given instruction to notify Calibre of any missing or damaged bag, as well as any

missing security seal.  The submittal form is put in a plastic bag and placed in the 
first rice bag of the shipment.  Each rice bag is secured with two plastic ties and a 
uniquely numbered non-re-sealable security strap.  The security tag number is 
recorded in the sample shipment tracking log. 

The rice bags are delivered directly from the Rosita office to Calibre's Managua office 
in a company truck the same day. 

When shipping to ALS Minerals, the samples are picked up at the Calibre office by 
courier personnel (UPS) and shipped by airfreight to ALS Minerals in Vancouver 
where the samples are prepared and analysed. 

When shipping to Inspectorate, the samples are delivered by Calibre personnel to 
the Inspectorate preparation laboratory located in Managua.  The samples are 
received by Inspectorate personnel where they are subsequently prepared.  
Inspectorate then ships pulps of the samples by airfreight to their lab located in 
Vancouver. 

While on the site, all the samples are stored in a secure warehouse, only accessible 
to key Calibre personnel.

La Luz Mines Ltd. initiated the first documented drilling program on the Property in 
1969 which was comprised of shallow churn drilling and deeper diamond drilling.  
Results from churn drilling reportedly defined sufficient tonnage to justify the 
development of an open pit operation which started production in early 1972.  Details 
from this first period of drilling have not been located to date. 

Rosario Resources Corp. subsequently purchased the Property in 1973 and 
continued work, eventually completing 71 churn and diamond drillholes (4,020.26 m) 
by the end of 1976.  Partial drill logs from some of these holes are available and a 
set of sections from Rosario Resources Corp. showing the approximate locations of 
all drillholes with limited geologic data and significant assay results have been 
located. 

Following the nationalization of the Property in 1979, no further drilling was 
completed until 1981 when Ernest Lehman Associates was contracted by the 
Corporacion Nicaraguense de Minas to evaluate the project with the goal of defining 
additional areas for mineral extraction.  Ernest Lehman Associates completed 11 
diamond drillholes (1,828.50 m) testing mostly at depth beneath the 300 ft level 
workings.  Detailed drill logs, assay results and photocopied assay certificates for this 
work have been located. 

Where historic data exists, every effort has been made to incorporate it into Calibre's 
database of historic work for the Project.

Calibre completed three campaigns of drilling at Riscos de Oro during the period 
2010 to 2011. The first phase of drilling (nine holes – 2,160.60 m) was designed to 
test areas proximal to and beneath historic drillholes that reported significant results.  
These holes were largely successful and confirmed the presence of two high-grade 
ore shoots within the more extensive Riscos de Oro vein system.  Two holes were 
also completed at shallower depths in untested areas along strike of the vein system.  
The phase two drill program followed-up and expand upon the more robust vein 
intersections returned from phase one and consisted of 2,466.25 m in nine holes.  
The third phase of drilling consisted of 4,867.20 m in 19 holes filling in the gaps 
between the two high-grade ore shoots and testing the along strike extension of the 
vein system.  As a result, the Riscos de Oro vein has been confirmed over a strike 
length of 665 m and to a depth of 350 m below surface.

All drilling for Calibre was completed by Rodio Swissboring Guatemala, S.A (Figure 
10.1).  All holes were drilled in HQ size and drill runs were 3.05 m in length.

Initial surveying of diamond drillholes was completed using a Magellan Mobile 
Mapper 6 handheld global positioning system (GPS) unit; collar azimuths were 
determined using a handheld compass.  Following completion of the drill programs, a 
surveyor was contracted to accurately locate the drillhole collars using a Trimble R3 
differential GPS unit.  Additional surveying work performed as part of the high-
resolution LiDAR topographic survey in March 2012 confirmed the accuracy and 
elevations of the drillhole collars (Table 10.1). 

Downhole survey readings were collected at approximately 50 m intervals using a 
Tropari survey tool; a Reflex E-Z Shot camera was used later in the program. 

Each of the drillholes was sealed with a cement pad and a concrete filled 3" polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) pipe was installed in the orientation of the drill casing.  Upon pouring 
of the cement, the drillhole number was scribed into the cement pad for ease of 
identification in the future (Figure 10.2).

The following description of the sampling methodology was provided by Adrian 
Newton, the Senior Project Geologist for the Project and is also available in a formal 
document.  Drilling was not underway when Tetra Tech conducted either site visit.  
Field observations made during the site visits conclude that the logging and sampling 
methodology describe by Mr. Newton are to industry standards, and are acceptable 
to support a resource estimate. 

10.3.1 CORE PICK-UP 

Core boxes are picked-up from the drill site by Calibre personnel, at a regular 
schedule.  The full boxes are stacked orderly on a pallet in the back of the company's 
truck.  A wooden lid is put on top of all boxes and everything is secured to the pallet 
with ratchet straps.  Care is taken so that the core boxes do not slide within the truck, 
and they are transported at slow speed back to the core facility in Rosita.

10.3.2 CORE DELIVERY  

Once the boxes are in the core facility, the drillhole numbers and box numbers are 
checked and reported to the logging geologists in order to confirm the correct core 
bench where the core will be transferred. 

The boxes are laid out on the core bench maintaining numeric continuity.  The core is 
cleaned to remove any drill grease or additive. 

10.3.3 GEO-TECHNICAL  LOGGING  

These are the steps to record geotechnical data for the core: 

 Load core boxes on logging benches in numerical order with box numbers 
increasing down rows and left to right.  Check with the logging geologist 
beforehand to ensure correct placement. 

 Carefully inspect the new core, reconstructing blocky intervals wherever 
possible.  Visually check that the meters written on the drill blocks increase 
down row, and left to right, and are in intervals of no more than 3.05 m.  
These intervals will be used as From-To intervals in the subsequent 
measurements below.  Alert logging geologists of any discrepancies. 

 Take recovery length and rock quality designation (RQD) measurements. 

 Recovery Length:  Measure length of core in core boxes between From-
To intervals in meters.  Enter the result into LogChief - "Geotech".  With 
broken/rubbly core, record the best estimate of recovery by 
reconstructing, and measuring, competent pieces, while visualizing 
rubbles zones as whole core. 

 RQD:  Measure the total length of solid core pieces (>10 cm) measured 
along the centerline of the core between From-To intervals.  Record the 
result in LogChief - "Geotech" (in meters). 

 Measure magnetic susceptibility between From-To intervals with KT-10 
magnetic susceptibility meter.  Take five measurements within each From-
To interval.  Record average calculated by unit in LogChief - "Mag Sus/Spec  
Grav". 

 Mark meter intervals on core.  Use drill blocks for reference.  Use core 
recovery for intervals in which there is a discrepancy between blocks and 
meter intervals.  Look for obvious breaks/fault zones, and signs of 
grinding/rounding from drilling, to account for missing core.  Alert logging 
geologists of any discrepancies. 

 Label core boxes with individual "From-To" intervals in the top left, and 
bottom right corners, using a permanent black felt marker.  "From" equals 
the depth at start of box (top left corner) and "To" equals the depth at end of 
box (bottom right corner).

 Staple aluminum box tag to left end of box.  Tag should include drillhole 
number (e.g. BB10-001), box number (e.g. BX 12), and "From-To" core box 
interval. 

 Wash core using bristle brush and hose.  Core should be free of drill mud 
and dirt.  Rock textures should be clearly visible.  Scrub only solid, 
competent pieces of core.  Care should be taken in fault gouge intervals, 
and in rubble zones, in order to preserve mineralization and maintain contact 
orientations.  When in doubt consult logging geologist before washing. 

10.3.4 CORE LOGGING  

Core is logged in detail and all the data about lithology, alteration, mineralization, 
veining and structure is recorded digitally in the appropriate LogChief data entry 
forms (Figure 10.4) 

Sample lengths are variable, 20 cm minimum sample length; 2 m maximum sample 
length and the samples do not cross lithological boundaries. 

A daily back-up of the drill hole data is created by the logging geologist, and it is 
transferred to the main office server using a memory data stick. 

The data is exported to excel files which are then imported to Datashed™.  This 
procedure is done by the database manager every 2 to 3 days.

10.3.5 CORE PHOTOS  

The core boxes are transferred to the photo station in numerical order.  Three boxes 
are photographed at a time, using the Canon EOS Utility on logging laptop 
computers (Figure 10.5).  Core photos are backed-up daily on the main office server 
by the logging geologist.

10.3.6 CORE SAMPLING  

From the core station, core is transferred to pallets located outside the core cutting 
facility (Figure 10.6). 

Figure 10.6 Core Cutting Facility 

 

Sample intervals are transferred to a sample booklet with pre-printed sample 
numbers. 

One box of core is loaded to the core-cutting bench at the time, and the interval of 
core to be sampled is cut in half using a top-mounted core saw with three stage 
decanted water.  One-half of the core is placed in a clean transparent bag, which has 
been previously labeled, and a pre-printed sample tag is placed inside of the bag. 

The bag is then sealed with a plastic tie strap and placed on the floor in an orderly 
manner for easy tracking.  The core-cutting bench and saw are thoroughly cleaned 
after each sample to avoid contamination. 

The remaining half of the core is put back in the core box, and it is transferred to 
covered storage racks where it will be kept future reference (Figure 10.7). 

QA/QC samples are inserted into the sample stream (see Section 11.0 for details).

The logging geologist is responsible for monitoring the sample progress and 
checking for sampling mistakes.  He/she will inform the core cutter of any irregular 
sample intervals.  

While on site, all the samples are stored in a secure warehouse, only accessible to 
key Calibre personnel 

10.3.7 SAMPLE SHIPPING  

Sample shipments are prepared and sent to Managua once a week.  All sample bags 
are placed in order of numbered sequence and put into rice bags.  Each rice bags 
holds approximately 25 kg of weight, and it is previously labeled with the sample 
range, customs broker, and laboratory name and addresses. 

The laboratory submittal form is filled by logging geologist and authorized by the 
Project Manager, or the person designated for this purpose. The laboratory is given 
instruction to notify Calibre of any missing or damaged bag, as well as any missing 
security seals.  The submittal form is put in a plastic bag and placed in the first rice 
bag of the shipment.  Each rice bag is secured with two plastic tie straps and a 
uniquely numbered non-re-sealable security strap.  The security tag number is 
recorded in the sample shipment tracking log. 

The rice bags are delivered directly from the Rosita office to Calibre's Managua office 
in a company truck the same day.

When shipping to ALS Minerals the samples are picked up at the Calibre office by 
courier personnel (UPS) and shipped by airfreight to ALS Minerals in Vancouver 
where the samples are prepared and analysed. 

When shipping to Inspectorate, the samples are delivered by Calibre personnel to 
the Inspectorate preparation laboratory located in Managua.  The samples are 
received by Inspectorate personnel where they are subsequently prepared.

Calibre has sent all samples from the Project to ALS Minerals in Vancouver via the 
described chain of custody process until July 2011.  As Inspectorate laboratories had 
opened a preparation laboratory in Managua several months previous to this, a 
decision was made to use their services as significant cost savings could be 
achieved through reduced shipping costs; the Inspectorate preparation laboratory 
subsequently sends the sample pulps to their laboratory in Vancouver for analysis. 

ALS Minerals is accredited to international quality standards through the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission 
(IEC) 17025 (ISO/IEC 17025 includes ISO 9001 and ISO 9002 specifications) with 
CAN-P-1579 (Mineral Analysis). 

Inspectorate is accredited to international quality standards through ISO; the 
analytical laboratory in Vancouver is ISO 9001:2008 certified.

11.1.4 INSPECTORATE ROCK AND DRILL  CORE PREPARATION 

All samples are processed using both jaw crushers and ring mill pulverizes.  Samples 
received by the laboratory are processed using the sample preparation package SP-
RX-2K: 

 dry, crush (<2 kg) 70% -10 mesh (2 mm) 

 split (250 g) 

 pulverize (to 85% -200 mesh -74 μm).

All samples are analyzed for gold by 30 g fire assay (FA)/inductively coupled plasma 
(ICP)-atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) technique in soils, and by 30 g FA/atomic 
absorption spectroscopy (AAS) technique in rock or drill core.  Multi-element analysis 
is completed for 36 elements, using Aqua Regia/ICP-AES. 

ALS Minerals codes are Au-ICP21 and ME-ICP41m, for soils; and Au-AA25 and ME-
ICP41m, for rocks. 

Corresponding Inspectorate codes are Au-1AT-ICP and 30M-AR-TR, for soils; and 
Au-1AT-AA and 30M-AR-TR, for rocks. 

The gold assay methodology used a standard FA with AAS finish technique on a 
30 g aliquot taken from the 250 g pulp.  Samples that returned assays greater than 
10 g/t gold re-run used a standard FA with gravimetric finish technique on a 30 g 
aliquot collected from the original 250 g pulp.

11.3.1 CALIBRE QA/QC PROGRAM 

Calibre has a well-documented QA/QC program in place, managed by the 
Supervisor of Quality Control. 

QA/QC samples, including pulp duplicates, crush duplicates, standard reference 
materials (SRM), and blanks were inserted in a predetermined sequence every 30th 
sample.  This ensures that there is a least one of each QA/QC sample typed 
submitted in the assay batch:

 pulp duplicate – every 30th sample starting at the 10th sample 

 SRM – every 30th sample starting at the 15th sample 

 crush duplicate – every 30th sample starting at the 20th sample 

 blank – every 30th sample starting at the 25th sample. 

The SRMs were purchased from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Vancouver.  
The blanks consisted of small pieces of volcanic scoria, collected from Masaya 
volcano, near Managua.  Table 11.1 summarizes the SRMs used during the 2010 
drilling campaign.

Note: *Used in Phase I program (2010). 

Only field duplicates are used for quality control in soil samples.  Samples are taken 
randomly in every soil line (one in a group of 30 samples).  The duplicates are taken 
at the same location of the original sample, and the suffix "A" is added to the sample 
ID. 

All data is reported in .csv files which are directly imported into Datashed™.  The 
results for quality control were reviewed as soon as a certificate is received. 

The following criteria were used by Calibre to determine pass or fail of an assay 
batch:

 SRM with gold values ±3 standard deviations was considered a failure and 
the whole batch re-assayed 

 two adjacent SRM for gold are ±2 standard deviation on the same side of 
the mean was considered a failure and an indication of bias. 

 blanks more than three times the detection limit are considered a failure. 

All the failures are logged in a table for failures, as well as the action taken to solve 
the issues. 

11.3.2 BLANK QA/QC 

The material used for the Calibre blank was scoria sourced from Masaya volcano 
outside of Managua. This is not certified blank, yet historically has been void of gold. 

Over the course of the three phases of diamond drilling a total of 171 samples were 
submitted.  Calibre used a failure limit of three times detection limit, while Tetra Tech 
plotted the blanks using two times detection limit as a failure. 

Failures constituted four samples or 2% at the beginning of the Project.  A break line 
indicating the change from ALS Minerals to Inspectorate explains the change on the 
chart (Figure 11.1).

11.3.3 FIELD DUPLICATE QA/QC 

Field duplicates are generated by quarter cutting the drill core and submitting as a 
separate sample.  A total of 28 field duplicate samples were submitted.  As would be 
expected in a gold-bearing system, the failure rate of the field duplicate is extremely 
high (less than 21%).  Two charts were created to display the disparity between 
duplicates (Figure 11.2 and Figure 11.3).  Based in the results of the limited number 
of field duplicate submitted, Tetra Tech recommends that Calibre discontinue the 
practice of submitting field duplicates for the QA/QC program.

11.3.4 COARSE REJECT DUPLICATE QA/QC 

Course duplicates were created by generating a second pulp from the course reject 
material.  Course reject duplicates were submitted every 30th sample starting at the 
20th sample.  A total of thirty-two course duplicates were submitted and a significantly 
lower numbers of failures occur (9%) (Figure 11.4 and Figure 11.5).  The course 
duplicates indicate that the reproducibility of the material is improved with sample 
hominization.  With an R2 of 0.995, there is a strong correlation between the original 
and the duplicates.

11.3.5 PULP DUPLICATE QA/QC 

The pulp duplicates were created by analysing a second pulp.  Pulp duplicates were 
submitted every 30th sample starting at the 10th sample.  A total of 42 pulp duplicate 
samples were submitted and the failure rate was within the acceptable industry rate 
of 2% (Figure 11.6 and Figure 11.7).

11.3.6 STANDARD REFERENCE MATERIAL  CGS-19 

The standard reference material CGS-19 has an expected value of 0.74 g/t gold.  
The 16 samples submitted by Calibre during the 2010 drilling campaign averaged 
0.75 g/t gold with only one sample (#3) exceeding the accuracy threshold.  As the 
one sample deemed a failure is at the beginning of the drill campaign and the 
remaining samples are well within the control limits, no action is required (Figure 
11.8).

The standard reference material GS-7A has an expected value of 7.2 g/t gold.  The 
eight samples submitted by Calibre during the 2010 drilling campaign averaged 
7.38 g/t gold.  Several of the samples exceeded the accuracy thresholds (Figure 
11.10), yet this might be due to the small sample subset.  Of particular concern 
would be samples #6 and #7 which exceed the upper threshold and yet have a small 
relative difference.

The standard reference material GS-P8 has an expected value of 0.78 g/t gold.  The 
17 samples submitted by Calibre during the 2010 drilling campaign averaged 0.77 g/t 
gold with only one sample exceeding the accuracy thresholds (Figure 11.11).  The 
certificate results are based on fire assay gravimetric finish, which differs from the 
methodology used by Calibre.  No course of action is required

22 samples submitted by Calibre during the 2011 drilling campaigns averaged 
2.68 g/t gold.  There is quite a bit of variation in the results earlier in the program.  
The laboratory appears to settle down after sample #15.  This may be related to the 
change from ALS Minerals to Inspectorate (Figure 11.15).

4.23 g/t gold.  Sample #8 should be reviewed to ensure there is not a samples swap 
as there are no SRM's in the 3.25 g/t range used in the Calibre QA/QC program 
(Figure 11.16).

The standard reference material GS-7B has an expected value of 6.42 g/t gold.  The 
14 samples submitted by Calibre during the 2011 drilling campaigns averaged 
6.51 g/t gold.  The first four samples appear to have issues, yet after sample #4 there 
appears to be a gradual drift of the instrument.  In addition, the precision of the AA 
instrument above 3 g/t is not as tight as below 3 g which may also explain some of 
the results (Figure 11.17).

0.70 g/t gold.  The broad variation in both the accuracy chart and precision chart is 
difficult to understand considering the results of CGS-19 and CM-8, both of which are

Tetra Tech carried out an internal validation of the diamond drillhole file against the 
original drillhole logs and assay certificates.  The validation of the data files was 
completed on twenty of the 159 drillholes in the total database or 12.5% of the 
dataset.  Data verification was completed on collar co-ordinates, end-of-hole depth, 
down-the-hole survey measurements, "From" and "To" intervals.  No errors were 
encountered.  A total of 25% of the assays data was validated against the original 
assay certificate.  The error rate from this validation was 0.4% and all errors were 
corrected in the database and the errors provided back to Calibre in order to allow 
Calibre to correct their database. 

All assays entered as zeros (0) were converted to half the detection limit and were 
not considered to be errors in the data. 

The drillhole data was imported into the Datamine™ program, which has a routine 
that checks for duplicate intervals, overlapping intervals and intervals beyond the end 
of hole.  The errors identified in the routine were checked against the original logs 
and corrected. 

Tetra Tech confirmed the locations of eleven surface drillhole collars during the two 
site visits.  Tetra Tech collected the collar locations using a Garmin GPSMAP 60Cx 
handheld GPS unit.  Table 12.1 displays the results of the collar validation.

samples were bagged, sealed on site and delivered to ALS Minerals in Sudbury, 
Ontario.  The samples were prepared in Sudbury and the pulps were shipped by ALS 
Minerals to Vancouver, British Columbia for analysis. 

ALS Minerals is accredited to international quality standards through the ISO/IEC 
17025 (ISO/IEC 17025 includes ISO 9001 and ISO 9002 specifications) with CAN-P-
1579 (Mineral Analysis). 

The sixteen samples were analyzed for gold and silver using analysis package Au-
AA25 which is a FA with an AAS finish and Ag-OG46 (Table 12.2). 

Of the samples collected, only one sample had a result with greater than 50% 
absolute difference when comparing the gold values.  The check samples confirm 
the presence of gold and silver in the system.  As would be expected in a gold

Calibre maintains all drillhole data in a Datashed™ database.  The headers, survey, 
lithology, assays tables were exported to .csv format then transferred to Tetra Tech.  
The .csv files were created in June 2012. 

All resource estimations were conducted using Datamine™ Studio 3 v. 3.20. 

A total of 155 holes and are present at Riscos de Oro.  However, only 84 drillholes 
within the areas of interest and with exploration potential were included in the 
resource estimate.  The remaining holes were either outside the immediate area of 
interest or were older boreholes completed with a percussion drill and could not be 
validated.

There is currently no specific gravity data available on the Project. 

Tetra Tech used a specific gravity factor of 2.65 for the Riscos de Oro mineral 
resource estimate.  This is comparable to other epithermal deposits. 

Tetra Tech would recommend that Calibre collect specific gravity measurements 
from various rock types in order to build up the data set.  A minimum of 2% of the 
data set should have a specific gravity measurement.  This would mean that the 
Riscos de Oro data set should have at least 104 specific gravity measurements.

14.3.1 GOLD EQUIVALENT FORMULA 

A gold equivalent value was assigned to all estimated blocks within the resource 
model.  The gold equivalent value is based on a long-range pricing index updated 
quarterly.  At the time the resource models were completed the following commodity 
prices were used: 

 gold = $US1264/ozt 

 silver - $US19.78/ozt. 

The equation for the gold equivalent value is as follows; 

Aueq = ([Au grade x Au price x 0.029167] + [Ag grade x Ag price x 0.029167])/ 
(Au price x 0.029167) 

14.3.2 GEOLOGICAL WIREFRAMES 

Three-dimensional wireframe models of mineralization was developed for the deposit 
based on a gold equivalent cut-off of greater than 0.2 g/t and a minimum 2 m 
horizontal width. 

Topographic digital terrain model was generated using LiDAR topographic data 
provided by Calibre. 

Sectional interpretations were digitized in Datamine™ Studio version 3.19.3638.0 
software, and these interpretations were linked with tag strings and triangulated to 
build three-dimensional solids.  Table 14.2 summarizes the solids and associated 
volumes.  The solids were validated in Datamine™ and no errors were found. 

The zones of mineralization interpreted for each area were generally contiguous; 
however, due to the nature of the mineralization there are portions of the wireframe 
that have grades less than 0.2 g/t gold equivalent, yet are still within the mineralizing 
trend (Figure 14.1 and Figure 14.2). 

The non-assayed intervals were assigned void (-) value.  Tetra Tech believes that 
non-assayed material should not be assigned a zero value, as this does not reflect 
the true value of the material.

14.4.2 GRADE CAPPING 

Raw assay data was examined to assess the amount of metal that is at risk from 
high-grade assays. The Datamine™ Decile function was used to determine if grade 
capping was required for gold or silver in the total data set.  Tetra Tech uses a 
combination of the Parrish analysis, cumulative histograms (Figure 14.3 and Figure 
14.4) and spatial distribution to assist if and where to apply a top cut to the grades.  
Parrish analysis (Parrish 1997) indicates that if the metal content in the ninetieth 
(90th) decile exceeded 40%, capping may be required.  Based on the analysis, Table 
14.4 shows a summary of the top cuts that were applied to the Riscos de Oro 
dataset.  Table 14.5 summaries the results of the grade capping on the statistics.

14.4.3 COMPOSITES 

Gold and silver assay data were composited into 1 m downhole intervals honouring 
the interpreted geological solids.  A 1 m composite length was selected as a majority 
of the assays are in the 1 m range for length (Figure 14.5), and it corresponds to 
approximately a half to a third the cell size in the shortest dimension to be used in the 
modelling process.  The backstitching process was used in the compositing routine 
to ensure all captured sample material was included.  The backstitching routine 
adjusts the composite lengths for each individual drillhole in order to compensate for 
the last sample interval.  Composites were complete separately for the north zone 
and south zone.  Table 14.6 summarizes the statistics of the boreholes after capping 
and compositing.

Due to the low density of drillholes at Riscos de Oro, Tetra Tech feels that the 
variography could not be completed to a level that would support kriging.  The 
variogram that was created for gold was used to assist with the generation of the 
search ellipse (Figure 14.6) 

Search ellipse where based on the general orientation of the mineralized zones and

A single block model was established in Datamine™ for the Upper and Lower Zones 
using one parent model as the origin.  The model was not rotated. 

Drillhole spacing varies with the majority of the drilling spaced at approximately 100 
to 150 m in the north and 40 to 800 m in the south.  A block size of 20 m x 20 m x 
5 m in the X/Y/Z directions was selected in order to accommodate the nature of the 
mineralization. 

Sub-celling of the block model on a 2 x 2 x 2 allows the parent block to be split once 
in each direction to more accurately fill the volume of the wireframes, thus more 
accurately estimate the tonnes in the resource. 

Table 14.7 summarizes details of the parent block model.

The interpolation of the model was completed using the estimation methods: nearest 
neighbour (NN) and inverse distance squared (ID2).  The estimations were designed 
for three passes.  In each pass a minimum and maximum number of samples were 
required as well as a maximum number of samples from a borehole in order to 
satisfy the estimation criteria.  Table 14.8 and Table 14.9 summarizes the 
interpolation criteria and search criteria for the Riscos de Oro resource model.

Several factors are considered in the definition of a resource classification: 

 NI 43-101 requirements 

 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum guidelines 

 authors experience with epithermal gold deposits 

 spatial continuity of the assays within the drillholes. 

No environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or 
other relevant issues are known to the authors that may affect the estimate of 
mineral resources.  Mineral reserves can only be estimated on the basis of an 
economic evaluation that is used in a preliminary feasibility study or a feasibility study 
of a mineral project; thus, no reserves have been estimated.  As per NI 43- 101, 
mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have to demonstrate 
economic viability.

The resource reported as of September 2012 has been tabulated in terms of a gold 
equivalent cut-off grade. A gold equivalent value was assigned to reach block based 
on the estimated gold and silver for the block. 

The mineral resource for Riscos de Oro is tabulated in Table 14.10 and Table 14.11 
for the Inferred Resources in the Upper and Lower Zones, respectively.  The 
resources are tabulated using various gold equivalent cut-off grades up to an upper 
boundary of greater than 2.0 g/t gold equivalent.  Figure 14.7 and Figure 14.8 are the 
grade tonnage curves for the Upper and Lower Zones, respectively.  Tonnages and 
contained metal have been rounded to reflect the level of confidence in the 
estimation.

Based on the results of similar gold operation located in Nicaragua, a 0.6 g/t gold 
equivalent cut-off was used to tabulate the total for the Riscos de Oro deposit.  This 
based on the following parameters: 

 selective mining open pit operation 

 operating cost of $20/t 

 gold price of $US1,264/ozt 

 US$ to Cdn$ conversion of 1.01 

 gold recovery of 94%.

 visual comparison of colour-coded block model grades with composite 
drillhole grades on section 

 comparison of the global mean block grades for inverse distance squared, 
nearest neighbour and composites 

 swath plots. 

14.9.1 VISUAL COMPARISON 

The visual comparisons of block model grades with composite grades for the deposit 
show a reasonable correlation between the values.  No significant discrepancies 
were apparent from the sections, yet grade smoothing is apparent (Figure 14.9 and 
Figure 14.10).

14.9.2 GLOBAL COMPARISON 

The global block model statistics for the ID2 interpolation were compared to the 
global nearest neighbour interpolation as well as the composite capped drillhole data.  
Table 14.13 shows this comparison of the global estimates for the two estimation 
method calculations.  In general, there is agreement between the models.  Larger 
discrepancies are reflected as a result of lower drill density in some portions of the 
model.  There is a degree of apparent smoothing when compared to the diamond 
drill statistics.  Comparisons were made using all blocks at a 0 g/t gold equivalent 
cut-off.

B2Gold signed an option agreement with Calibre in June 2009 to earn a 51% interest 
in the Project by expending $8 million over three years with Calibre acting as 
operator.  Upon B2Gold earning an interest in the project, they can acquire an 
additional 14% interest by completing a preliminary feasibility study on a chosen 
project.  In October 2010, B2Gold reduced its area of interest to focus on the Rosita 
H-2, Nueva America H-1 and Hemco II concessions.  Calibre retained 100% interest

in the remaining concessions.  As part of the new agreement, B2Gold has to spend 
$8 million over an amended five-year term; the 14% additional interest can still be 
obtained by completing a preliminary feasibility study on a chosen project following 
completion of the initial earn in. 

Following a period of continued encouraging rock, soil and trenching results at the 
Primavera prospect, diamond drilling was initiated in November 2011.  Three holes 
were completed during the first program returning significant gold-copper results from 
porphyry style mineralization including 261.70 m grading 0.78 g/t gold and 2,966 ppm 
copper (drillhole PR-12-002).  In December 2011, B2Gold exercised its right to 
become operator of the Project and has continued diamond drilling activities 
continuously to the present time.  The prospect is located due south of the town of 
Rosita on the border between the Rosita H-2 and Nueva America H-1 concessions.

Alder Resources signed an option agreement with Calibre in August 2011 to earn a 
65% interest in the Rosita D concession by expending $4 million on exploration and 
issuing Calibre 1 million common shares of Alder Resources over four years.  Alder 
Resources was designated as operator for the Project.  The Property hosts the 
historic open pit Santa Rita mine from which 5.37 Mt of ore grading 2.06% copper, 
0.93 g/t gold and 15.08 g/t silver was extracted by La Luz Mines Ltd. and Rosario 
Resources Corp.  The mine closed in 1975 due to low copper prices. 

Alder has proceeded with completing an aggressive drill program at Santa Rita 
testing both the historic dumps and the areas beneath the now flooded pit.  In June 
2012, Alder Resources filed an NI 43-101 report on the Inferred Mineral Resource 
stockpiles at the historic Santa Rita mine.  7.95 Mt with an average grade of 0.62% 
copper, 0.46 g/t gold and 9.2 g/t silver were defined using trenching, reverse 
circulation and diamond drilling.  Additional trenching and diamond drilling is ongoing 
at the Bambana gold-copper prospect, located 4 km northwest and along strike of the 
historic Santa Rita mine.

The Bonanza mine is located on an exploitation concession entirely surrounded by 
Calibre concessions.  The mine is presently owned and operated by a private arms-
length company. 

The mine has produced an estimated 2.6 Moz of gold from low sulphidation 
epithermal veins between 1939 and 2002 from both open pit and underground 
operations (Arengi et al. 2003). 

The last publically stated resource for Bonanza was by RNC Gold Inc. in 2005.

Based on the review of the available information and observations made during the 
site visit, Tetra Tech concludes the following, in no particular order of perceived 
importance: 

 The Property is currently held 100% by Calibre, through a wholly-owned 
subsidiary. 

 The Riscos de Oro and Rosita H-2 concessions, which this report addresses 
is not subject to the option agreement between B2 Gold and Calibre. 

 The Riscos de Oro and Rosita H-2 concessions, which this report addresses 
is not subject to the option agreement between Alder Resources and 
Calibre. 

 The Project is analogous to a low sulphidation epithermal deposit typical for 
the region. 

 Mineralization at the Project is currently defined as a two parallel zones.  
The total strike length is approximately 665 m and a down dip vertical extent 
of 350 m. 

 Historical mining at the Project produced approximately 36,000 oz of gold 
and 2.4 Moz of silver. 

 Drilling and sampling procedures, sample preparation and assay protocols 
are generally conducted in agreement with best practices. 

 Verification of the drillhole collars, surveys, assays, core and drillhole logs 
indicates the Calibre data is reliable. 

 Some twinning of historical drillholes at the Project will be required to 
confirm older assay data.  Existing validation is incomplete, due to loss of 
historic data. 

 Based on the QA/QC program, the data is sufficiently reliable to support the 
resource estimate generated for the Project. 

 The mineral models have been constructed in conformance to industry 
standard practices. 

 The geological understanding is sufficient to support the resource 
estimation. 

 At a gold cut-off grade of 0.6 g/t gold equivalent, the Project contains an 
Inferred Resource totalling 2.2 Mt with an average grade 3.20 g/t gold and 
59.67 g/t silver.

 The specific gravity values used to determine the tonnages at the Project 
was derived from specific gravity values typical to low sulphidation 
epithermal deposits. 

 The Riscos de Oro deposit remains open to the north and at depth in 
addition to the potential for hidden mineralized veins.

It is Tetra Tech's that additional exploration expenditures are warranted.  Two 
separate exploration programs are proposed.  Each can be carried out concurrently 
and independently of each other, and neither is contingent on the results of the other.

Phase 1 is designed primarily to expand the current resource at the Project by testing 
the strike and dip extension of the deposit.  This will entail diamond drilling with 
additional work on metallurgical testing, rock mechanics and surveying. 

The drilling campaign should be designed to target the potential strike extensions of 
the Project, particularity the northeast.  Drillhole spacing should continue at 
approximately 50 m along section and 50 to 75 m vertically on section in order to 
support an Inferred Resource.  Any opportunity to drill the upper portion of the Lower 
Zone should be made as this near surface potential was not identified in the historical 
mining or previous drilling by other operators.

Phase 2 is designed to delineate the resource at the Project by infilling of the deposit 
and providing the level of detail to conduct a PEA.  This will entail a diamond drilling 
program, addition metallurgical testing, other technical studies, and environmental 
base lining.

The drilling campaign should be designed to target the core areas of the Riscos de 
Oro deposit, particularly in the areas where widths are wider and grades are higher.  
Drillhole spacing should be at approximately 25 to 30 m along section and 30 to 50 m 
vertically on section in order to improve the resource classification.

The following recommendations are to assist in moving the project forward; 

 Adjust the insertion location of the QA/QC blanks to allow for the control 
samples to be placed within or immediately after mineralized intervals.  This 
will be a better use of the control samples as it is designed to monitor the 
preparation facility. 

 For future drilling programs, collect specific gravity measurement for the 
various rock types and alteration styles.  Approximately 4 to 5% of the 
database should have a specific gravity measurement.  This will allow for a 
more accurate calculation of the tonnage in the subsequent resource 
estimate. 

 Consider conducting a preliminary metallurgical test using drill core or 
course rejects, to determine the global recoveries that maybe expected from 
the deposit. 

 Establish a method in which to drill test the upper portion of the Lower Zone 
that is hidden by the mined out section of the Upper Zone. 

 Low sulphidation systems rarely occur as individual vein sets, search for 
additional vein swarms with in the concession.

DATE OF CERTIFICATION:   June 15, 2008 
 
 
METHOD OF PREPARATION: 
 
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 200 mesh screen.  The +200 material was 
discarded.  The -200 material was mixed for 6 days in a double-cone blender.  Splits were taken and sent to 13 laboratories 
for round robin assaying. 
 
ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL: 
 
This standard is made from a combination of  granitic material and Au / Cu ores.   
 
 
Approximate chemical composition is as follows: 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Statistical Procedures: 
 
The final limits were calculated after first determining if all data was compatible within a spread normally expected for 
similar analytical methods done by reputable laboratories. Data from any one laboratory was removed from further 
calculations when the mean of all analyses from that laboratory failed a t test of the global means of the other laboratories. 
The means and standard deviations were calculated using all remaining data. Any analysis that fell outside of the mean ±2 
standard deviations was removed from the ensuing data base. The mean and standard deviations were again calculated 
using the remaining data.  This method is different from that used by Government agencies in that the actual "between-
laboratory" standard deviation is used in the calculations. This produces upper and lower limits that reflect actual individual 
analyses rather than a grouped set of analyses. The limits can therefore be used to monitor accuracy from individual 
analyses, unlike the Confidence Limits published on other standards.

INDEPENDENT GEOCHEMIST:  Dr. Barry Smee., Ph.D., P. Geo. 
DATE OF CERTIFICATION:   September 05, 2008 
 
 
METHOD OF PREPARATION: 
 
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 200 mesh screen.  The +200 material was discarded.  
The -200 material was mixed for 6 days in a double-cone blender.  Splits were taken and sent to 12 laboratories for round robin 
assaying. 
 
ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL: 
 
This standard is made from a combination of  granitic material and an Au / Cu concentrate.   
 
 
Approximate chemical composition is as follows: 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Statistical Procedures: 
 
The final limits were calculated after first determining if all data was compatible within a spread normally expected for similar 
analytical methods done by reputable laboratories. Data from any one laboratory was removed from further calculations when the 
mean of all analyses from that laboratory failed a t test of the global means of the other laboratories. The means and standard 
deviations were calculated using all remaining data. Any analysis that fell outside of the mean ±2 standard deviations was removed 
from the ensuing data base. The mean and standard deviations were again calculated using the remaining data.  This method is 
different from that used by Government agencies in that the actual "between-laboratory" standard deviation is used in the 
calculations. This produces upper and lower limits that reflect actual individual analyses rather than a grouped set of analyses. The 
limits can therefore be used to monitor accuracy from individual analyses, unlike the Confidence Limits published on other 
standards.

METHOD OF PREPARATION: 
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 270 mesh screen.  The +270 material was

for round robin assaying. 
 
ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL: 
 
 Standard CDN-CM-6 was prepared using ore supplied by Pacific Sentinel from their Casino property in Yukon, Canada.  It 
is a copper-gold porphyry deposit.  The standard was prepared using 750 kg of this ore, 30kg of a blank granitic material 
and 20 kg  of  a  Au-Cu-Mo concentrate. 
 
 
Approximate chemical composition is as follows:

DATE OF CERTIFICATION:   June 14, 2010 
 
ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL: 
 
Standard CDN-CM-8 was prepared using a North American calc-alkalic copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry ore.  
It is derived from altered granodiorite, mafic to intermediate volcanic and volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks.  
Mineralization is principally pyrite, chalcopyrite and molybdenite that occurs in veins, stockworks and 
disseminations.  792 kg of this ore was blended with 2 kg of a high grade gold ore. 
 
METHOD OF PREPARATION: 
 
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 270 mesh screen.  The +270 
material was discarded.  The -270 material was mixed for 5 days in a double-cone blender.  Splits were taken 
and sent to 15 commercial  laboratories for round robin assaying.   
 
 Approximate chemical composition (by whole rock analysis) is as follows: 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Statistical Procedures: 
 
The final limits were calculated after first determining if all data was compatible within a spread normally expected for 
similar analytical methods done by reputable laboratories. Data from any one laboratory was removed from further 
calculations when the mean of all analyses from that laboratory failed a t test of the global means of the other laboratories. 
The means and standard deviations were calculated using all remaining data. Any analysis that fell outside of the mean ±2 
standard deviations was removed from the ensuing data base. The mean and standard deviations were again calculated 
using the remaining data.  This method is different from that used by Government agencies in that the actual "between-
laboratory" standard deviation is used in the calculations. This produces upper and lower limits that reflect actual individual 
analyses rather than a grouped set of analyses. The limits can therefore be used to monitor accuracy from individual 
analyses, unlike the Confidence Limits published on other standards.

Statistical Procedures: 
  

The final limits were calculated after first determining if all data was compatible within a spread normally 
expected for similar analytical methods done by reputable laboratories. Data from any one laboratory was 
removed from further calculations when the mean of all analyses from that laboratory failed a t test of the global 
means of the other laboratories. The mean and standard deviation were calculated using all remaining data. Any 
analysis that fell outside of the mean ±2 standard deviations was removed from the ensuing data base. The mean 
and standard deviations were again calculated using the remaining data.  This method is different from that used 
by Government agencies in that the actual "between-laboratory" standard deviation is used in the calculations. 
This produces upper and lower limits that reflect actual individual analyses rather than a grouped set of analyses. 
The limits can therefore be used to monitor accuracy from individual analyses, unlike the Confidence Limits 
published on other standards.

DATE OF CERTIFICATION:    April 8, 2010 
 
ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL: 
 
Standard CDN-GS-1F was prepared using ore supplied by Teuton Resources from their Clone gold property in B.C., Canada.  
Mineralization is localized within highly silicified semi-massive to massive specular hematite.  The gold occurs as fine 
disseminations and is associated with the oxide mineralization. The major lithology is observed to be light grey to green andesitic 
pyroclastics intercalated with fine grained to aphanitic andesite. Clasts are subangular to angular, matrix supported, and range in size 
from 1-3cm. Quartz-calcite stockwork pervades the unit in moderate abundance.  6 kg of this ore was blended with 800 kg of a blank 
granitic ore. 
 
METHOD OF PREPARATION: 
 
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 270 mesh screen.  The +270 material 
was discarded.  The -270 material was mixed for 5 days in a double-cone blender.  Splits were taken and sent to 14 
commercial laboratories for round robin assaying.  Round robin results are displayed below:

ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL: 
 
Standard CDN-GS-3G was prepared using ore supplied by Barrick Gold Inc. from their Goldstrike Mine in Nevada, USA. 
 It is Carlin Style Mineralization in the prolific Northern Carlin Trend in Northern Nevada, USA. The source material is from 
Devonian carbonates of the Popovich Formation.  Gold is strongly associated with pyrite and other sulfides including the arsenic 
minerals orpiment and realgar.

  Statistical Procedures: 
  

The final limits were calculated after first determining if all data was compatible within a spread normally 
expected for similar analytical methods done by reputable laboratories. Data from any one laboratory was 
removed from further calculations when the mean of all analyses from that laboratory failed a t test of the global 
means of the other laboratories. The mean and standard deviation were calculated using all remaining data. Any 
analysis that fell outside of the mean ±2 standard deviations was removed from the ensuing data base. The mean 
and standard deviations were again calculated using the remaining data.  This method is different from that used 
by Government agencies in that the actual "between-laboratory" standard deviation is used in the calculations. 
This produces upper and lower limits that reflect actual individual analyses rather than a grouped set of analyses. 
The limits can therefore be used to monitor accuracy from individual analyses, unlike the Confidence Limits 
published on other standards.

ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL: 
 
Standard CDN-GS-4C was prepared using ore supplied by Barrick Gold Inc. from their Goldstrike Mine in Nevada, USA. 
 It is Carlin Style Mineralization in the prolific Northern Carlin Trend in Northern Nevada, USA. The source material is from 
Devonian carbonates of the Popovich Formation.  Gold is strongly associated with pyrite and other sulfides including the arsenic 
minerals orpiment and realgar.  
 
METHOD OF PREPARATION: 
 
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 270 mesh screen.  The +270 material 
was discarded.  The -270 material was mixed for 5 days in a double-cone blender.  Splits were taken and sent to 15 
commercial  laboratories for round robin assaying.  Round robin results are displayed below:

ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL: 
 
Standard CDN-GS-7A was prepared using ore supplied by Comaplex  Minerals Corporation.  The ore is from the 1100 
lode of the Tiriganiaq Gold Deposit north of Rankin Inlet in Nunavut. It is a banded magnetite iron formation zone with 
gold in quartz shears with accessory pyrrhotite, pyrite, and arsenopyrite. The gold is free milling although there may be a 
small refractory component. 
 
METHOD OF PREPARATION: 
 
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 200 mesh screen.  The +200 material 
was  discarded.  The -200 material was mixed for 6 days in a double-cone blender.  Splits were taken and sent to 12

ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL: 
 
Standard CDN-GS-P8 was prepared using ore supplied by Canadian Gold Hunter Corporation from its 
Caballo Blanco (North Zone) property in Mexico.  It is a high sulphidation gold system with extensive silica 
flooding and brecciation. The breccia can be filled with iron oxides, but is usually devoid of clay.   
 
METHOD OF PREPARATION: 
 
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 270 mesh screen.  The +270 material 
was discarded.  The -270 material was mixed for 6 days in a double-cone blender.  Splits were taken and sent to 12 
commercial  laboratories for round robin assaying.  Round robin results are displayed below:
