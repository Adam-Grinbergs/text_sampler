EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE NKOUT IRON ORE 
PROJECT, COMMUNITY OF DJOUM, CAMEROON MAY 2013 

1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1.1 Background 

SRK Consulting (UK) Limited ("SRK") is an associate company of the international group 
holding company, SRK Consulting (Global) Limited (the "SRK Group"). SRK has been 
requested by Afferro Mining Inc. ("Afferro", the "Company" or the "Client") to prepare an 
updated Mineral Resource Estimate on its 100% owned Nkout project located in the Djoum 
district in Southern Cameroon ("Nkout" or the "Project"). Afferro is a TSX-V and AIM listed 
exploration and development company with multiple iron ore projects in Cameroon.  

This report has been prepared for Afferro and is presented in accordance with National 
Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"). 

This report serves as an independent report prepared by Howard Baker (MAusIMM(CP)), who 
is a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101 and the companion policy 43-101CP.  

The definitions of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources, as well as Mineral Reserves 
as used by the author, conform to the definitions and guidelines of the CIM (Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum) reporting codes. 

Howard Baker of SRK has undertaken four site visits to the Project – in September 2010, 
March 2011, November/December 2011 and April 2013 – during which all available data for 
Nkout was acquired and the drilling activities observed. In addition, SRK has maintained a 
presence onsite during the recent and on-going drilling campaigns. 

1.2 Location 

Djoum, the closest town to the Project, is located 280 km southeast of the Nsimalen 
International Airport in Yaoundé. The route from Yaoundé incorporates 170 km of tar 
macadam road and 110 km of laterite road (currently under upgrade). The Project area is 
located approximately 7.5 km due south of the Djoum to Mbalam road. The terrain is typical of 
the southern tropical forest of Cameroon, characterised by dense jungle, rivers, swamps and 
areas of steep topography.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE – Executive Summary 
 

1.3 Property Description and Ownership 

Afferro has 100% ownership of Nkout which is situated within the Company's Djoum III 
licence (the "Licence"). The Licence was originally granted to Caminex SARL (''Caminex''), a 
local subsidiary of Afferro, on 01 August 2006 and had an initial surface area of 997.9 km2. 
The Licence has been renewed twice since it was first granted, most recently on 18 July 2011, 
and its surface area reduced to its current 242.5 km2. 

1.4 Data Quality 

The data used in the estimation and the associated quality control quality assurance 
("QA/QC") data was compiled by SRK. It is the opinion of SRK that the results of the blanks, 
certified standards, and the results of the laboratory duplicates show that a reasonable level 
of confidence can be attributed to the recent drill samples used in the Mineral Resource 
Estimate. In addition, a more detailed survey file has been generated by Afferro for use in this 
update. 

1.5 Geology and Mineralisation 

Nkout lies within the Ntem complex in the form of a schist belt comprising basal 
metasediments, small quantities of intrusive granites and a banded iron formation ("BIF"), 
which is underlain by biotite gneiss (granitic basement) and displays internal zones of schist. 

Primary mineralisation is a laminated metamorphosed iron ("Fe") formation containing 
recrystallised megascopically distinguishable granular quartz layers alternating with thin 
layers of magnetite, haematite and occasional limonite (BIF). Mineralisation controls are 
understood to have been associated with favourable Fe-rich stratigraphic horizons with little 
clastic sedimentation, metamorphic enhancement of grain size, structural thickening during 
deformation and folding, and subsequent weathering and enrichment of the oxide 
mineralisation. 

1.6 Geological Model 

The Nkout Centre, Nkout East, Nkout West and D8 deposits, being approximately a 12 km 
portion of a larger 20 km strike length magnetic anomaly, form an east-west trending 
magnetite BIF with an oxidised cap of dominantly haematite mineralisation. SRK has created 
a geological model based on the lithological logging and magnetic susceptibility data enabling 
the hanging wall and footwall contacts of the BIF unit to be modelled and a three dimensional 
solid to be created. A statistical review of the validated drillhole data enabled grade based 
zones to be created within the oxidised cap. In addition, internal metasedimentary waste 
zones were created within the BIF and oxidised cap based on lithology logging, magnetic 
susceptibility data and predominantly Fe and Al2O3 assay grades. 

A single magnetite BIF zone across Nkout West, Nkout Centre, Nkout East and D8 (zone 
210) has been created. Within the associated oxidised cap, four mineralisation zones have 
further been developed (zones 110, 120, 130 and 160). Internal zones 140, 240 and 150 have 
been created within the magnetite BIF and oxidised cap removing internal metasedimentary 
waste zones.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE – Executive Summary 
 

1.7 Mineral Resource Estimate 

A 5 m composite file was used in a geostatistical study (variography and Quantitative Kriging 
Neighbourhood Analysis – "QKNA") that enabled Ordinary Kriging ("OK") to be used as the 
main interpolation method. The interpolation used an elliptical search following the 
predominant dip and dip direction of the geological zones. The results of the variography and 
the QKNA were utilised to determine the most appropriate search parameters. 

The interpolated block model was validated through visual checks and a comparison of the 
mean input composite and output model grades. SRK is confident that the interpolated block 
grades are a reasonable reflection of the available sample data on both global and local 
scales. 

1.8 Mineral Resource Statement 

The Mineral Resource Statement generated by SRK has been restricted to all material falling 
within a Whittle Shell representing a metal price of USD1.4/dmtu for magnetite and potential 
sinter fines concentrate. Processing costs, mining costs slope angles, mining recoveries and 
revenue assumptions were also used to demonstrate economic viability. The material within 
the Whittle shell represents the material which SRK considers has reasonable prospect for 
eventual economic extraction potential based on the Whittle optimisation analysis undertaken.  

Table 1 shows the resulting Mineral Resource Statement for Nkout.  The statement has been 
classified in accordance with the Guidelines of NI 43-101 and accompanying documents 43-
101.F1 and 43-101.CP, by the Qualified Person, Mr Howard Baker (MAusIMM(CP)). Mr Baker 
is an independent consultant with no relationship to an Afferro employee and has never been 
employed by Afferro. The Mineral Resource Statement has an effective date of 28 May 2013. 

The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are uncertain 
in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Mineral 
Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource; and it is uncertain if further 
exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource 
category.

The Mineral Resource Estimate has not been affected by any known environmental, 
permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues. 

1.9 Metallurgical Testwork 

Mineral processing and metallurgical testing have been carried out on the mineralisation 
types.  

1.9.1 DSO Testwork 

Direct shipping ore ("DSO") testwork comprised apparent density ("AD") determinations, bond 
impact crushing work index ("CWi"), uniaxial compressive strength ("UCS"), head analysis of 
two metre composites, drop tower tests, batch scrubbing tests and bulk density 
determinations. 

Only a single UCS measurement could be made due to the soft and friable nature of the DSO 
material. The material is therefore expected to be extremely easy to crush, resulting in lower 
capital cost and power consumption for the DSO crushing circuit. Further confirmation of this 
was shown by the CWi measurements, the low values of which indicate the very soft nature of 
the material. CWi measurements averaged 2.25 kWh/t, with maximum and minimum values 
being 0.4 and 4.7 kWh/t, respectively. 

Drop tower testing showed a reasonable quantity of lump product could be produced from 
Nkout DSO. Average lump production was 46.5% and ranged from a minimum of 34% to a 
maximum of 61%. Further examination of the potential of a lump product is suggested, and 
future work which will include thermal property characterisation is planned. Assay data 
showed that there is little or no upgrading of Fe grade to the lump fraction and therefore the 
Fe content of the lump and fines in expected to be very similar. 

Scrubbing of the ore composite sample showed the potential to upgrade the DSO material 
from an average scrubber feed grade of 58.1% to 63.8% Fe, through screening of the 
scrubber product and rejection of the -0.5 mm material. However, Fe losses to the -150 
micron fraction were extremely high, around 55%, and a requirement to process the fines in 
order to achieve acceptable Fe recovery is recommended. 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx  May, 2013

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE – Executive Summary 
 

Deleterious elements, particularly phosphorous, are quite high in the DSO and this may need 
to be addressed through scrubbing and fines treatment in order to produce a product of 
acceptable quality to potential customers. 

1.9.2 Scrubbing/Magnetic Separation Flowsheet 

Testwork has been undertaken on two composite samples from Nkout Centre, one "low 
alumina" and the other "high alumina". Both samples assayed approximately 53% Fe; the low 
alumina sample assayed approximately 1.5% Al2O3 and the high alumina sample assayed 
approximately 7.5% Al2O3. 

The testwork conducted on these samples consisted of scrubbing of the samples once 
crushed to -6.3 mm, separation of the +1 mm fraction as a product fraction, followed by 
sequential processing of the -1 mm faction by Low Intensity Magnetic Separation ("LIMS"), 
producing a second product fraction, followed by processing of the LIMS tailings by High 
Gradient Magnetic Separation ("HGMS") using a SLon separator, producing a third product 
fraction. 

While the low alumina sample achieved a combined product with a good Fe grade, the high 
alumina samples did not, due to the low Fe grade of the product from the scrubbing and 
screening stage. The silica grade of the product from the low alumina sample test was also 
somewhat higher than would be desirable, due to the high silica content of the HGMS 
product. However, this product was from the SLon test conducted at the highest magnetic 
field strength used (7000 G). While the test at a magnetic field strength of 5000 G yielded a 
similar result, the test conducted at a magnetic field strength of 2000 G resulted in a product 
with a silica grade of 6.0%. Using this as the SLon product would have resulted in an overall 
product silica grade of 4% at a slightly higher Fe grade (65.9%) albeit at a lower overall Fe 
recovery. The Fe recovery of the product was 72%. 

The reason(s) behind the difference in performance between the two samples tested has not 
been explored as yet, although it is likely that the goethite content of the samples plays a key 
role in the recovery.  

1.9.3 PFS Saprolite Testwork (Zone 120 and 130) 

Head assays of the composites used for the beneficiation testwork completed to date ranged 
from 39.8 to 42.3% Fe, 4 to 9% Al2O3 and 24 to 35% SiO2 and were somewhat higher in Fe 
and alumina grade than the resource average for the Nkout saprolite. This should be taken 
into account when predicting mass and Fe recovery from the beneficiation processes. That 
said, the updated Mineral Resource Statement reported herein has been produced to domain 
out the high clay zones within the saprolite and this should be taken into account in future 
programmes.  

Preliminary testwork carried out on saprolite (Zone 120 and 130) material suggested that a 
sinter fines product could be produced through a gravity and magnetic scavenging flowsheet. 
More detailed pre-feasibility study ("PFS") testwork carried out subsequently suggests a fines 
sinter product can be most efficiently produced through combination of low and high intensity 
magnetic separation processes.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE – Executive Summary 
 

Saprolite testwork comprised UCS testing, impact crushing work index, JK dropweight testing, 
abrasion index, bond rod and ball mill work index, AD and beneficiation testwork using both 
gravitation and magnetic separation methods. 

A combined net mass of 11,227 kg of Nkout saprolite material, made up from seventeen 
drillholes taken primarily across the known Nkout Centre saprolite resource, were shipped to 
SGS, Perth, Australia (SGS) for this testwork programme. For the UCS and CWi 
determinations, material from an individual drillhole was tested. For all other testwork, three 
composites were formed from Nkout West, Nkout Centre, and Nkout East. 

The saprolite samples were observed to be very soft and friable and this limited the amount of 
suitable samples for UCS testing that could be found. Only three measurements could be 
made, with an average value of 12.4 MPa. The soft nature of the saprolite was confirmed by 
the CWi. The average CWi was only 2.4 kWh/t, with maximum and minimum values being 
6.52 and 0.55 kWh/t, respectively. Crushing of saprolite is expected to be relatively easy with 
a low power requirement indicated. 

JK dropweight testing and computer simulation suggested that the use of SAG milling is not 
applicable, due to the soft nature of the material and relatively high clay content of the 
samples tested. Conventional multi-stage crushing followed by ball milling is expected to be 
the most suitable comminution circuit. In this regard, the abrasion index measurements were 
all low, ranging from 0.06 to 0.13, and this suggests relatively low crushing liner and ball mill 
media consumption when processing saprolite ores. 

Bond rod and ball mill work index measurements suggest that as the saprolite particles 
become smaller, the comminution energy increases significantly. The rod mill work index 
ranged from 6.1 to 7.6 kWh/t, values of near average hardness; whereas the ball mill work 
indexes were in the very hard range at between 17.3 and 17.9 kWh/t. Milling energy is likely 
to be high and will be a significant element of the overall operating cost. The importance of 
minimising energy consumption through maximisation of beneficiation particle size is noted. 

Davis Tube Wash ("DTW") testwork on the composite samples taken over a range of particle 
size p80 from 25 to 500 microns showed that quite a significant quantity of Fe can be 
concentrated utilising low intensity magnetic separation. Very high grade concentrate was 
achieved at particle sizes at or finer than 150 microns with Fe grades in excess of 68%. Fe 
recovery progressively drops with finer particle sizes due to liberation of haematite from 
magnetite, ranging from around 51% at a grind size of 500 microns to only 15.7% at 38 
microns. Pilot scale LIMS testwork at grind sizes of 250, 180 and 150 microns confirmed the 
DTW results, with average Fe recovery of 35% being achieved at a grind size of 250 microns 
with concentrate grading 67.4% Fe and 2.4% SiO2 and very low deleterious elements. 

Gravity separation testwork using a Wilfley shaking table showed that a final grade 
concentrate could be produced but that Fe recovery was low. At a grind size of 250 microns, 
average concentrate grade was 68.6% Fe, but Fe recovery was low averaging only 32.5%. 
Attempts were made to improve Fe recovery through the addition of a cleaner stage to retreat 
the middlings material from the first stage of tabling, overall concentrate grade dropped 
slightly to 66% Fe but Fe recovery did increase to an average of 72%

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE – Executive Summary 
 

Further testwork was undertaken to examine Fe recovery from the LIMS tailings through use 
of a SLon high intensity magnetic separator. SLon Fe recovery averaged 63.7% at a 
concentrate grade of 61.5%. The combined LIMS and Circuit recovery averaged 75.3% at a 
concentrate grade of 64% Fe, 5.4% SiO2 and 1.1% Al2O3. 

Mineralogical work indicated that major Fe losses from the LIMS/SLon circuit were due to the 
presence of non-magnetic geothite. Geometallurgical logging of the oxide zones is 
recommended as part of the PFS work programme to assist in recovery predictions from the 
resource model. 

1.9.4 PFS Magnetite BIF Testwork 

Preliminary Davis Tube Recoveries ("DTR") testwork carried out on Magnetite BIF (zone 210) 
material suggested that a high grade sinter fines product could be produced through simple 
LIMS beneficiation at a grind size of 75 microns. More detailed PFS testwork carried out 
subsequently now suggests that a saleable grade fines sinter product can be most efficiently 
produced at much coarser grind sizes, which would have the potential to significantly reduce 
operating costs. 

BIF testwork comprised UCS testing, impact crushing work index, JK dropweight testing, 
abrasion index, bond rod and ball mill work index, AD and beneficiation testwork using LIMS. 

A combined net mass of 11,915 kg of Nkout BIF material, made up from 20 drillholes taken 
primarily across the known Nkout Centre BIF resource, were shipped to SGS for this testwork 
programme. Five of these holes were selected to provide good geographical spread across 
the deposit as well as significant "across mineralisation" core length for the testwork 
programme. It is planned to use material from the remaining holes for future process 
optimisation and variability testing.  

The BIF samples were observed to be very hard and competent which allowed for a full range 
of UCS testing to be undertaken. The average UCS was a moderately high value of 68 MPa 
with maximum and minimum values at 123.6 and 21.4 MPa, respectively. The very hard 
nature of the BIF at Nkout was confirmed by the CWi determinations. The average CWi was a 
high 15.2 kWh/t, with maximum and minimum values being 21.8 and 10.2 kWh/t respectively. 
Crushing of BIF is expected to require a high power consumption and a high crushing circuit 
capital cost. 

JK dropweight testing and comminution circuit computer simulation suggests that the use of 
SAG milling is applicable. 

Bond rod and ball mill work index measurements suggest that the BIF particles are extremely 
competent in the finer size ranges. The rod mill work index average a high of 10.5 kWh/t, 
whereas the ball mill work indexes range between 15.5 and 18.2 kWh/t. Milling energy is likely 
to be very high and will be a significant element of overall operating costs. The importance of 
minimising energy consumption through maximisation of beneficiation particle size is 
paramount. 

Head assays of the composites used for the beneficiation testwork ranged between 25.3 and 
33.9% Fe and were at or somewhat below the resource average for BIF.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE – Executive Summary 
 

DTW testwork on the composite samples taken over a range of particle size p80 from 38 to 
500 microns showed that reasonable Fe recovery and good concentrate grade can be 
concentrated utilising LIMS. Acceptable grade concentrate was achieved at particle sizes at 
or finer than 150 microns with Fe grades averaging around 64.3% at Fe recovery averaging 
78.6%. Quite large variability in performance was noted between drillhole composite samples 
and this is planned to be investigated further in future testwork programmes.  

Pilot scale LIMS testwork suggested that a somewhat finer grind of between 106 microns and 
125 microns was required to produce similar results to that achieved by the DTW testwork. At 
a particle size p80 of 125 microns, average Fe recovery was 76.9% with a concentrate grade 
of 64.9% Fe, 8.5% SiO2 and low level of alumina and phosphorous, averaging only 0.6% and 
0.014% respectively. 

Mineralogical studies indicated that major iron losses to the LIMS tailings were due to the 
presence of non-magnetic haematite and Fe silicates. 

1.10 Exploration Potential 

SRK recognises that there is potential to increase the Mineral Resource Statement at Nkout 
through deep drilling that targets material that falls within a Whittle pit shell generated when 
including the unclassified material. This material, based on a metal price of USD1.4/dmtu is 
considered by SRK to be potentially economic, should sufficient exploration data be collected 
that confirms the geometry and continuation of the mineralisation and that enables a classified 
resource to be generated. SRK has identified that an additional 500 to 1,000 Mt lies below the 
Whittle pit shell used for constraining the Inferred Mineral Resources. The potential quantity of 
tonnes is conceptual in nature as there has been insufficient exploration in these areas. It is 
uncertain if further exploration will result in these targets being delineated as a Mineral 
Resource. These potential tonnages reflect a range of material within SRK's solid models 
outlining the interpreted down dip extent of mineralisation. 

1.11 Conclusions and Recommendations 

It is the opinion of SRK that the quantity and quality of available data is sufficient to generate 
an Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate and that the Mineral Resource 
Statement has been classified in accordance with the Guidelines of NI 43-101. 

It is the recommendation of SRK that Afferro continues to develop the topographic survey of 
the Licence area. In the primary BIF, SRK recommends that in order to continue to increase 
the Mineral Resource classification from an Inferred to Indicated category, a drill spacing of 
400 m along strike is required with a minimum of two inclined drillholes per section and in the 
oxidised cap, it is likely that a line spacing of 100 m will be required. 

Work Programme Going Forward 

Exploration activities are understood to continue within the Licence area, with three diamond 
core drill rigs currently in operation on site. The key objectives are to further test and increase 
the Indicated portion of Nkout 110 (DSO) zone and infill around selected targets of potential 
(specifically Nkout East and Nkout West) DSO material with the objective of defining early 
cash flow material. In addition, a programme of drilling is currently underway to further convert 
and upgrade the Inferred classified material to Indicated, targeting 225 Mt of DSO/saprolite 
and 1.7 Bt of magnetite BIF for the Indicated or Measured classification in the overall 
resource.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE – Executive Summary 
 

Afferro is also planning a scout drilling programme to investigate the potential of additional 
magnetic anomaly targets in the Licence area with a focus on the D9 anomaly. SRK 
recognises that initial reconnaissance drilling programmes have in addition been completed 
over the D3 however at this time this has not been incorporated into the Mineral Resource 
Estimate. 

SRK understand the Afferro budgets have been put in place to facilitate the on-going 
exploration and development programme, with a forecasted expenditure through the 2013 
financial year of approximately US$2.5 million for the on-going drill programme at Nkout.

MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE NKOUT IRON ORE 
PROJECT, COMMUNITY OF DJOUM, CAMEROON MAY 2013 

1 INTRODUCTION 

1.1 Background 

SRK Consulting (UK) Limited ("SRK") is an associate company of the international group 
holding company, SRK Consulting (Global) Limited (the "SRK Group"). SRK has been 
requested by Afferro Mining Inc. ("Afferro", the "Company" or the "Client") to prepare a Mineral 
Resource Estimate on the Nkout project located in the Djoum district in Southern Cameroon 
("Nkout" or the "Project"). Afferro is a TSX-V and AIM listed exploration and development 
company with four iron ore projects in Cameroon.  

This report serves as an independent report prepared by Howard Baker (MAusIMM(CP)) of 
SRK, who is a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101  ("NI 43-101") and 
the companion policy 43-101CP.  

The definitions of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources, as well as Reserves, as used 
by the author in this report, conform to the definitions and guidelines of the CIM (Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum) reporting codes. 

Howard Baker has undertaken four site visits to the Project – in September 2010, March 2011, 
November/December 2011 and April 2013 – during which all available data for Nkout was 
acquired and the drilling activities observed. 

The data used for the Mineral Resource Estimate, including drillhole databases and 
topographic surveys, was provided by Afferro. SRK has, however, maintained an onsite 
presence throughout 2011 and 2012 in addition to on-going remote technical support during 
2012 and 2013, and has been integral in collating the drillhole database, managing the 
exploration and Quality Assurance and Quality Control ("QA/QC") activities as well as 
overseeing the current drilling campaigns. 

The geological units in the project area are Archaean in age and the main focus of the Project 
is a magnetite banded iron formation ("BIF") and associated weathered products that occur 
within the Ntem complex of the Congo craton.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

The deposit at Nkout occurs within a magnetic anomaly with a strike length of some 20 km. 
The current drilling utilised in this Mineral Resource Estimate update covers the Nkout Centre, 
Nkout East, Nkout West and D8 anomalies that strike over 12 km in a predominant east-west 
orientation in the northern portion of the Djoum III exploration licence (the "Licence").  

Exploration drilling commenced at the end of July 2010 with the initial 31 drillholes being 
utilised in January 2011 to establish a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate. Subsequent 
updates were completed in June 2011, November 2011 and June 2012; these are 
summarised below. 

In the maiden Mineral Resource Statement, with an effective date of 28 January 2011, SRK 
reported an Inferred Mineral Resource of 1.04 billion tonnes ("Bt") grading 34.2% Fe. 

With an effective date as at 16 June 2011, SRK updated the above statement based on 19 
additional drillholes (58 holes, 9,864 m in total) to derive an Indicated Mineral Resource of 701 
million tonnes ("Mt") grading at 32.4% Fe and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 716.5 Mt 
grading at 34.8%. 

A further update was completed in November 2011 and was based on an additional 79 holes 
(10,815.81 m) to derive a Indicated Mineral Resource of 0.9 Bt grading at 32.7% Fe and an 
Inferred Mineral Resource of 1.1 Bt at 31.6% Fe. 

Prior to the completion of the Mineral Resource Estimate which forms the subject of this 
report, a fourth resource update was finalised in June 2012, reporting a 1.18 Bt Indicated 
Mineral Resource grading 32.86% Fe and an estimate of 1.33 Bt of Inferred Mineral 
Resources grading 30.25%  Fe. 

This report summarises the exploration and technical work undertaken at Nkout since 
inception and describes the methodology employed by SRK to produce an updated 
independent Mineral Resource Estimate which has been prepared under the Guidelines of NI 
43-101 and accompanying documents 43-101.F1 and 43-101.CP.

3.1 Property Description and Ownership 

Afferro currently has 100% ownership of the Project subject to Government rights. The 
Licence was originally granted to Caminex SARL (''Caminex''), a local subsidiary of Afferro, on 
01 August 2006 and covered a surface area of 997.9 km2. The Licence was issued by the 
Ministry of Mines, Industry and Technological Development of Cameroon ("MMITD") and is 
governed by the World Bank sponsored Mining Law Number 01 (Code Minier Loi #01 or the 
"Mining Code") of 16 April 2001, as amended on 29 July 2010. 

The Licence is exploration permit (Permis de Recherche) n°115 named Djoum III and entitles 
its holder to explore the surface and subsurface for Fe, gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, 
uranium, platinum group elements and diamonds.  

The original permit granted on 01 August 2006 was valid for three years and, accordingly, 
expired on the 01 August 2009. Approval for a first renewal of the Licence was given to 
Caminex by the MMITD on 29 September 2009 and the surface area was reduced to 489 km2 
in accordance with applicable law. A second renewal of the Licence was granted, under Order 
n° 00887/MINIMIDT/SG/DMG/SDAM on 18 July 2011, reducing the area to its current 
242.5 km2.

3.2 Licence Agreements 

Exploration permits issued prior to the amendments to the Mining Code dated 29 July 2010 
(the "2010 Amendments to the Mining Code") are issued for an initial period of three years and 
can be renewed no more than four times for a maximum period of two years at each renewal. 
The total length of time which an exploration permit issued prior to the 2010 Amendments to 
the Mining Code can be held is eleven years, and the licence area has to be reduced by 50% 
upon each renewal period that is granted. 

The current Licence is due to expire on 18 July 2013 and Caminex is entitled to apply for its 
renewal for two additional periods of two years at each renewal. At the end of the last renewal 
period of the Licence, Caminex must apply for a mining permit and submit a feasibility study. 
In order to be granted a mining permit, the applicant must have a sizeable deposit and have 
undertaken an environmental and social impact study. A mining permit must be renewed every 
twenty-five years or until exhaustion of the resources. 

3.3  Additional Permits and Payments 

Exploration Permits are issued subject to payment of an initial grant fee of FCFA 2,000/km2. 
Renewals are subject to a fee of FCFA 3,000/km2. 

Under the terms of the current Licence, the minimum expenditure required is of FCFA 
1,000,000,000 for the first year of validity of the permit and FCFA 1,117,553,000 for its second 
year of validity. 

Given the current exploration status of the Licence, SRK is not aware of any other royalties, 
back-in-rights, payments or any other agreements associated with the Project. In addition, 
SRK is not aware of any environmental liabilities associated with the Project. 

SRK has been supplied with the 2010 Amendments to the Mining Code according to which the 
granting of a mining permit gives rise to the gratuitous allocation to the state of a 10% stake in 
the share capital of the mining company, tax free, with the opportunity to acquire up to another 
20% according to mutually agreed conditions. Due to the exploration status of the Licence, the 
asset is currently under 100% ownership of Afferro.

4 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

4.1 Property Access 

Cameroon is situated on the boundary of central and western Africa, at the approximate 
location of 3°52′ north and 11°31′ east. It covers a surface area of approximately 475,442 km2, 
with a coastline of over 300 km, from which a relatively narrow coastal plain gives way to a 
diverse geography of desert plains and savannah in the north, mountains in the central 
regions and tropical rainforest in the south and east. 

4.2 International Access 

The country's neighbours are Nigeria to the west; Chad to the northeast; the Central African 
Republic ("CAR") to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo to 
the south, making it possible to enter Cameroon by road. The Trans-African Highway network 
enters the country from Gabon, the CAR and Chad. Although Cameroon lies at a key point in 
the highway network, it is indicated that there are numerous missing sections within the 
country owing to the challenging tropical climate and undulating terrain. 

The main international airport is located in Douala with secondary international airports located 
at the political capital Yaoundé and at Garoua. A number of airlines operate flights between 
Cameroon and European cities including Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels. 

Djoum, the closest town to the Project, is located 280 km southeast of the Nsimalen 
International Airport in Yaoundé. The route from Yaoundé incorporates 170 km of macadam 
road and 110 km of laterite road (currently under upgrade to a macadam road). 

There are no rail links with neighbouring countries. 

4.3 Regional and Local Access 

It is estimated that the country has approximately 987 km of rail line, which (in addition to the 
privately run bus services) provides a connection between the major cities. Domestic flights 
are available from a number of airports scattered throughout Cameroon. It is reported that 
there are thirty-four airports, only ten of which have paved runways. 

In terms of local access, it takes approximately five to six hours to reach Djoum from Yaoundé, 
via the regional capital of Sangmelima. Access from Djoum to the main camp at Nkout Centre 
is via the N9 east, the main road to the Congo Brazzaville border. Logging and company built 
roads connect the N9 to the camp. 

The Project area is located approximately 7.5 km due south of the Djoum to Mbalam road. The 
terrain is typical of the southern tropical forest of Cameroon, characterised by dense jungle, 
rivers, swamps and areas of steep topography.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

4.4 Physiography and Climate 

Cameroon is divided into five major geographic zones distinguished by dominant physical, 
climatic, and vegetative features:  

1) the coastal plain, which extends up to 150 km inland from the Gulf of Guinea, and is 
characterised by coastal forests and a hot and humid climate;  

2) mountains and high plateaus (4,095 m at maximum elevation) dominate the central area 
providing a cooler climate; 

3) mild climate savannah-covered hills; 

4) hot desert plains form the northern area; and 

5) humid tropical rainforest dominating the south and east. 

4.4.1 Physiography 

The terrain in the vicinity of the Project is characterised by tree covered rolling hills at an 
average elevation of between 200 and 300 m. The permit area is covered by tropical rainforest 
with small scale agriculture near the main roads. In this relatively virgin area, the forest is 
comprised of a number of levels: tall trees (approximately 40 m high) form the highest stratum, 
beneath which stand smaller, thinner trees with leaves clustered at their tops. The forest bed 
has little vegetation, resulting from the shielding effect of sunlight by the high forest canopy.  

4.4.2 Climate 

The climate of the South Province is tropical, of Guinea-type. Humidity is high, and 
precipitation averages between 1,500 and 2,000 mm per year in the interior and between 
2,000 and 3,000 mm per year in the coastal region. Temperatures are relatively high, 
averaging between 24˚C and 26˚C. 

Guinea-type climate is characterised by alternating dry and wet periods, with the year 
beginning with a long dry season that lasts from December to May. This is followed by a light 
wet season from May to June, a short dry season from July to October, and a heavy wet 
season that begins around October and lasts through to the end of November.  

Monthly rainfall records for Djoum (at an elevation 684 m), located in the easternmost portion 
of the Ntem Basin, are provided in Table 4-1. 

Table 4-1: Monthly average rainfall records for Djoum (1934 – 1982) (mm)

38 54 129 184 194 146 78 88 216 252 130 47 1,566 

 
Major rainfall peaks are observed in May and October, with the lowest value occurring during 
January. The sum of rainfall for the rainy seasons (March to June and September to 
November) accounts for 80% of annual rainfall.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

Afferro has continued exploration activities throughout the wet season with only minor delays 
caused due to inclement weather due in the main to the investment by the Company in 
developing the roads and other infrastructure at the Project. It is anticipated that a mining 
operation in such an environment would suffer from minor lost production due to surface water 
ingress into the mine workings. That said, detailed hydrological studies should mitigate such 
risks and it is the opinion of SRK that such risks are not material to the Project. 

4.5 Regional Infrastructure and Local Resources 

Cameroon has developed a network of hydroelectric power stations that provide most of the 
country's electricity. The rest of the country's energy is provided by oil-powered thermal 
generators. Despite this supply, much of the country remains without reliable power. 

Transport in Cameroon is often difficult. With the exception of several relatively good toll roads 
that connect major cities, roads are poorly maintained and as only a small percentage is 
tarred, frequently deteriorate following inclement weather.  

The Wouri River estuary provides a harbour for Douala, the country's principal seaport.  

Land-based telephones are largely under government control; however cell phone networks 
and internet providers are available and have recently increased dramatically. Existing 
business infrastructure has developed in Cameroon associated with the country's most 
significant exports, including petroleum, cocoa and rubber.  

Nkout is situated close to existing infrastructure in a significant iron ore province which 
includes the Mbalam iron ore deposit, located 150 km to the southeast. The whole province 
lies within reach of the site of a proposed deep water port at Kribi on the Atlantic coast. 

There is access to mains electricity at the town of Djoum, supplied via the regional capital of 
Sangmelima. 

4.6 Surface Rights 

For the purposes of the Mineral Resource Estimate, all rights to the Project are covered by the 
Licence which is an exploration permit, numbered 115 and named Djoum III, renewed under 
Order n° 00887/MINIMIDT/SG/DMG/SDAM of 18 July 2011. No additional licences are 
required at this stage of development of Nkout.  

In accordance with the provisions of the Mining Code, a mining permit (to warrant mine 
development including facilities) is granted by decree of the President of Cameroon and is 
renewable every twenty-five years or until exhaustion of the resources. In order to be granted 
a mining permit, the applicant must have a sizeable deposit and have undertaken an 
environmental and social impact study. Furthermore, the mining area must be of a single bloc 
of polygonal shape falling entirely within the exploration permit from which the mining permit 
has derived.

5 HISTORY 

5.1 Previous Mapping and Surface Sampling 

The Licence encloses the eastern half of the 150 km long Sangmelima-Djoum Archaean 
greenstone belt, identified by the BRGM during the 1980s and subsequently defined at a 
higher resolution using airborne magnetic and remote sensing data acquired whilst 
investigating gold occurrences in 2006.  

The 2006 survey revealed a 10 km long dipole anomaly in the north of the Licence, which was 
subsequently interpreted as a large, basic - ultra basic intrusive with associated BIF, including 
the potentially economically important Nkout deposit. Early BRGM work suggested the 
intrusion hosts itabirite type Fe formations. 

A regolith mapping and soil sampling programme was undertaken during the early part of 
2008. All available outcrops and float were mapped using a grid-based method, incorporating 
79.8 km of data. Mapping clearly illustrated that the Nkout ridge area is dominated by sheared 
meta-sedimentary rich BIF. The main lithology present comprises arenaceous sandstones 
intercalated with Fe rich bands. 

Following the 2008 reconnaissance mapping programme, the Company retained GT 
Exploration Services of South Africa who in April 2009 undertook a reconnaissance sampling 
and mapping programme along the Nkout ridge. The study targeted the area considered as 
having the potential to host economic Fe concentrations, and aimed to define areas for initial 
drill testing.  

The results from this programme indicated that Nkout comprised high grade haematite and 
magnetite bearing formations, and allowed the prospects in the area to be sub-divided into 
geographical areas (as illustrated in Figure 5-1): Nkout East, Nkout Centre, Nkout West, Nkout 
West Northwest (later renamed D8) and Ngoa (which falls within the permit area of into the 
70% Afferro owned Essong licence area).

5.2 Previous Geochemical Surveys 

Details of the 2009 reconnaissance (geochemical) sampling programme are as follows: 

A 200 m x 100 m regional soil sampling grid following a north-south pattern was completed 
over 'Nkout Hill'. The samples collected were analysed for both gold and Fe. In addition, 44 
grab samples were collected from a 3 km by 3.75 km area on the eastern section of the Nkout 
ridge.  

The combined results of the analysis are illustrated in Figure 5-2.  

 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 14 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy showed that the grab samples comprised mainly high 
grade haematite along with magnetite and goethite. A high proportion of samples collected 
from the Central Nkout and Western Nkout prospects returned haematite/magnetite 
percentages of greater than 90% (approximately 63% Fe). The highest grade sample collected 
during this programme had a haematite/magnetite content of 95.21% (approximately 66% Fe).

5.3 Previous Geophysical Surveys 

The BRGM commissioned a regional low resolution geophysical survey during the 1980s.  

Afferro undertook an in-house ground magnetic survey during the latter part of 2009 and early 
2010. The magnetic data was collected using three GEM magnetometers. Two were used to 
collect data along the survey lines, whilst the third was used as a base magnetometer.  

A total of twenty lines were surveyed in the Nkout area for a total line distance of 39.87 km. 
Lines were spaced at 400 m apart. The magnetic data was then submitted to an external 
consultant (Southern Geosciences), who interpreted the magnetic data to suggest the 
following: (1) the BIF (in-places) had a thickness of between 60 and 130 m; (2) a depth to top 
of BIF of 5 to 50 m; and (3) magnetic susceptibilities of 2.0 to 4.0 SI, consistent with high 
magnetite content.

Following completion of the ground magnetic survey, Afferro commissioned New Resolution 
Geophysics (a South African based survey company) to complete a 5,410 line km airborne 
geophysical survey (magnetics and radiometrics) across the Licence area to define priority 
targets for a drill programme scheduled for 2010.  

The survey was flown in February and March of 2010 at a 100 m line spacing to provide high 
resolution results.  

Deliverables from the survey included Geosoft format grids of: 

• total field gradient enhanced magnetics; 

• first vertical derivative magnetics reduced to pole magnetics; 

• analytic signal; 

• four channel NASVD processed radiometric data (total count, potassium, uranium and 
thorium); and 

• calculated digital terrain model. 

This data was sent to Southern Geosciences for interpretation and modelling.  

Figure 5-4 illustrates the interpreted tops (orthogonal projection to surface) of the models 
generated: solid red lines represent the modelled horizontal thickness of the BIF, while the 
dotted red lines are extrapolations of the modelled BIF based on a combination of the 
magnetic images and the models created. The survey lines that were modelled are indicated

5.4 Drilling by Previous Explorers 

No previous drilling was undertaken in the area; only Afferro has undertaken drilling within the 
Licence area, which commenced at the end of July 2010. 

5.5 Previous SRK Mineral Resource Estimates 

SRK completed a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate on Nkout  ("MRE 1") with an effective 
date of 28 January 2011; it is described in the technical report entitled "Mineral Resource 
Estimate for the Nkout Centre Iron Project, Community of Djoum, Cameroon." In total, SRK 
derived an estimated Inferred Mineral Resource for Nkout of some 1.04 Bt grading 34.2% Fe, 
43.0% SiO2 and 2.9% Al2O3 and 0.05% P. Of this, 7 Mt grading 58% Fe lies within a near 
surface high grade oxidised zone (Zone 110, >55% Fe), 22.5 Mt grading 51.2% Fe lies within 
the oxidised zone 120 (50 to 55% Fe) and 131 Mt lies within the oxidised zone 130 (30 to 50% 
Fe).  878.6 Mt lies within the fresh magnetite BIF zone (210) and grades 32.7% Fe. 

Since MRE 1, SRK has completed three additional Mineral Resource Estimates: (1) during 
July 2011 that was described in the technical report entitled "Mineral Resource Estimate for 
the Nkout Centre Iron Project, Community of Djoum, Cameroon July 2011" effective as of 16 
July 2011 ("MRE 2), "); (2) in November 2011, ''Mineral Resource Estimate for the Nkout Iron 
Ore Project, Community of Djoum, Cameroon. November 2011'' effective as of 15 November 
2011 ("MRE_3"); and, finally,(3) in June 2012  entitled "Mineral Resource Estimate for the 
Nkout Centre Iron Project, Community of Djoum, Cameroon June 2012" which was effective 
as of 29 June 2012 ("MRE_4"). 

MRE 4 derived an estimated Indicated Mineral Resource of; 1,186.6 Mt grading 32.86% Fe, 
45.22% SiO2, 2.38% Al2O3 and 0.048% P and an estimated Inferred Mineral Resource of 
1,326.0 Mt grading 30.25% Fe, 47.11% SiO2, 3.97% Al2O3 and 0.051% P. Both Indicated and 
Inferred material are split between the magnetite BIF and the oxidised zones.  

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013

6 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION 
Sections of the following geological descriptions are taken from the following geological 
papers: 

• Geology and ore fabrics of the Nkout high-grade haematite deposit, southern 
Cameroon, C. E. Suh,A. R. Cabral, E. Ndime. Can. J. Earth Sci. 41: 73–85 (2004). 

6.1 Regional Geology and Tectonics  

The Pan-African belt in central Africa (Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic ("CAR")) to 
the north of the Congo craton ("CC"), which is also known as Oubanguides or North Equatorial 
fold belt (Poidevin 1983; Nzenti et al 1988), is the southernmost branch of the Pan-
Africano/Braziliano belt. The evolution of the fold belt is considered to be a result of the 
convergence and collision between the São Francisco – Congo cratons, the West African 
Craton ("WAC"), and a Pan-African mobile domain. This mobile domain corresponds to the 
mobile belt of central Africa, which consists of an amalgamation of Precambrian terranes.   

The Precambrian terranes demonstrate a long and complex crustal evolution with a strong 
imprint of the Neoproterozoic events. The interactions between this mobile domain and the 
major cratons are considered to be only partially understood. On the eastern border of the 
WAC, the evolution seems to be well constrained with an eastward subduction followed by the 
collision between the craton and the Tuareg–Nigerian shield between 630 and 580 Ma. This 
was preceded in eastern Hoggar by an early collision between the Tuareg shield and an 
eastern, ill-defined cratonic domain corresponding partly to the Saharan metacraton at 
approximately 700 Ma with northeast-verging thrusting of units, including ophiolites. On the 
northern edge of the CC, the evolution is still enigmatic as no clear evidence of oceanic rocks 
has yet been found, despite all the features that characterise a collisional belt being present.  

The uncertainty in the tectonic history has led to various and divergent models that broadly 
correspond to collision between the CC and the mobile belt or collision between different 
blocks of the mobile belt. Also, there is no consensus on the significance of strike slip faults 
that are considered either as early or late collisional features.  

6.1.1 Yaoundé domain 

The Yaoundé domain ("YD") is a huge allochtonous nappe unit thrusted southward onto the 
CC. It comprises low to high-grade garnet-bearing schists, gneisses, and orthogneisses 
metamorphosed under a medium to high pressure metamorphism reaching the granulite 
facies (with a temperature of approximately 750 to 800°C and pressure of approximately 1000 
to 1200 MPa). One of the characteristics of this domain is the scarcity of late to post-tectonic 
granitoids that are widespread in the Adamawa–Yadé and western Cameroon domains. In the 
YD, all identified plutonic rocks are pre to syn-tectonic and have been involved in the nappe. 
They include principally mafic to intermediate rocks that are best represented by pyriclasites of 
the Yaoundé city and serpentinised chromitic and nickelifereous ultramafic rocks associated 
with gabbros, diorites, and mafic dykes.  

 

 

 
U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 

Page 19 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

The YD includes the Yaoundé series and extends in CAR with the Bolé series and the Gbaya 
high-grade gneisses and orthogneisses. The schists and gneisses of the Yaoundé series were 
interpreted as Neoproterozoic epicontinental deposits related either to an intracontinental 
distensive environment or to a passive margin. However, Sm–Nd isotopic data indicate that 
the presumed metasediments and meta-igneous rocks were derived from a protolith consisting 
of a mixture of juvenile Neoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic sources without major 
contribution from the CC. The only possible source for old components is represented by the 
Paleoproterozoic basement of north-central Cameroon, suggesting that the Yaoundé series 
formed in the internal zone of the Pan-African belt before being thrust onto the CC. 

6.1.2 Adamawa–Yadé domain 

The Adamawa–Yadé domain ("AYD") extends east of the Tcholliré–Banyo shear zone (the 
"TBSZ"). The shear zone comprises several lithologies, namely: 

1) large remnants of Paleoproterozoic metasediments and orthogneisses showing 
important contribution from Archaean crust ages and inherited zircons and 2.1 Ga 
relictual granulitic metamorphism that was reworked during Pan African deformation; 

2) Lom Neoproterozoic schist belt (ca 700 Ma) composed of low- to medium-grade 
metasediments and acidic volcanoclastic rocks and showing Pan-African amphibolite 
facies metamorphism; and  

3) widespread syn to late-tectonic granitoids mainly of transitional composition or crustal-
derived origin.  

The AYD represents a Paleoproterozoic basement that was dismembered during the Pan-
African orogeny. Although Paleoproterozoic juvenile material exists in some areas of this 
domain, most of the basement rocks derive from the recycling (sedimentary and melting) of an 
Archaean crust of similar age to the CC. This is also the case for the Nyong series in south-
western Cameroon, which is regarded as the southern extension of the basement rocks of the 
Adamawa region, and which remained linked with the CC during the early Neoproterozoic 
fragmentation. The Yadé massif in western CAR is a poorly surveyed domain consisting of a 
granito-gneiss complex that is assumed to be of Archaean age. However, its proximity with the 
Adamawa in Cameroon and the continuity of structures suggest that the Yadé massif may 
correspond to the eastern prolongation of the Adamawa domain. 

6.1.3 Western Cameroon domain 

The western Cameroon domain ("WCD") is located west of the TBSZ  and extends along the 
western border of Cameroon. The lithologies within the WCD consist of: 

1) Neoproterozoic medium to high-grade schists and gneisses of volcanic and volcano-
sedimentary origin well represented by the Poli series (metavolcanics are tholeiitic 
basalts and calc-alkaline rhyolites emplaced in a distensive crustal environment at 
about 800 Ma);  

2) Pan-African pre, syn, to late-tectonic granitoids (diorites, granodiorites, and granites) 
mainly of calk-alkaline composition emplaced between 660 and 580 Ma;  

3) post-tectonic alkaline granitoids, which comprise mafic and felsic dykes crosscut by 
subcircular granites and syenites; and  

 

 
U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 

Page 20 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

4) numerous basins (Mangbaï-type series) with unmetamorphosed sedimentary and 
volcanic rocks that may correspond to molassic deposits of the Pan-African orogeny.  

Rb/Sr, Sm/Nd, and U–Pb data indicate that most of the rocks of this domain (gneisses and 
granitoids) are Neoproterozoic juvenile rocks or display contamination by a 2.1 Ga crust. No 
Achaean inheritance has yet been recognised (Toteu et al 2001). Thus, this unit may be 
considered as the eastern prolongation of the north-eastern Nigeria terrane including schists 
and gneisses of south-eastern Nigeria.

6.2 Local Geology  

Nkout is situated towards the northern limit of the Ntem complex, which is Archaean in age 
and defines the northern extension of the CC. Rock types of the Ntem complex comprise 
schist, amphibolite, quartzite, TTG granites, orthopyroxene–garnet (charnockitic) gneiss, 
greenstone rocks and itabirite-like rocks. This metamorphic rock assemblage has an east-
west-trending (S1) foliation and numerous intrusions (granodiorite, tonalite and syenogranite) 
that are usually emplaced along a southwest to northeast-trending (S2) foliation. The S1 
foliation has near vertical dips to the north and is locally deformed into mesoscopic isoclinal 
D2 folds. The S2 foliation is a regional, steeply dipping planar fabric with variably oriented 
stretching lineation and large-scale open folds that are associated with north-south trending 
sinistral and dextral strike-slip faults and mylonitic (S3) foliation. The S2 foliation is well 
observed in greenstone units in the Ntem complex (Shang et al 2004) and its development is 
linked to dome-and-basin tectonics related to diapiric movements (Tchameni et al 2001). The 
oldest rocks of the Ntem complex belong to the granite-gneiss assemblage, (>3000 Ma), 
followed by granulite-facies metamorphism, granitoid plutonism and charnockitisation at 
approximately 2900 to 2500 Ma. A major Eburnean tectono-metamorphic event at 
approximately 2000 Ma resulted in amphibolite-facies metamorphism. During the Pan-African 
(approximately 600 Ma), a mobile belt, the Yaoundé series, drifted southward and collided with 
the Ntem complex. The Yaoundé series was consequently thrust over the Ntem complex, 
reactivating under brittle–ductile conditions north-east to southwest-trending shear zones in 
the Ntem complex. The Pan-African overprint also expressed itself in the form of late granitic 
plutonism. Itabirite-like rocks in the Ntem complex are considered to be Archaean in age. The 
Nkout itabirite occurs as a roughly east-west continuous trending ridge, approximately 8 km in 
length after which it appears discontinuous albeit on the same orientation. The ridge is 
interpreted as an isoclinal fold structure along the contact of greenstone rocks to the south and 
a granite-charnockite assemblage to the north. Faults striking broadly north-south and 
northeast to southwest delimit the deposit. 

6.3 Nkout Deposit Stratigraphy 

Nkout lies within the Ntem complex in the form of a schist belt comprising basal 
metasediments, small quantities of intrusive granites and a BIF, which is underlain by biotite 
gneiss (granitic basement) and displays internal zones of chlorite-grunerite schist (Figure 6-2 
and Figure 6-3). 

The Nkout BIF is a laminated metamorphosed oxide-facies Fe formation containing 
recrystallised megascopically distinguishable granular quartz layers alternating with thin layers 
of magnetite, haematite and occasional limonite.

6.3.1 Stratigraphy 

The Nkout BIF is lithologically variable, showing inter-layered metasedimentary and meta-
igneous rocks above the granitic basement gneiss, typically capped at the surface by a 
widespread laterite/saprolite unit. 

A field-based provisional stratigraphy is summarised in Table 6-1 and displays the main 
stratigraphic divisions in the Nkout area.

Lithology Codes 

Code Lithology Description 

Amp Amphibolite Medium- to coarse grained metamorphosed basic igneous rock with feldspars, biotite, quartz, epidote, amphibole 

BIF Banded Iron Formation Banded siliceous, haematite/magnetite deposit formed by possible chemical-organic sedimentation processes

QtzV Quartz vein Vein of quartz >1m in thickness 

Sc Schist Medium grade metamorphic rock with smaller grain size than Gn (though >1mm) displaying schistosity 

 

6.3.2 Itabirites 

The itabirites at Nkout are divided into oxide and fresh mineralisation types primarily on the 
basis of weathering. This variation, while not strictly stratigraphic, is of importance owing to the 
potential mining economics of the different material types.  

Laterite and limonite itabirite constitute the most weathered material and have low magnetic 
susceptibilities.  

 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 25 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

Limonite itabirites are variegated in shades of brown, orange, red and yellow and are soft to 
hard, vuggy or porous. They typically have 2-40% clay or silt fractions and may be pisolithic at 
times with angular rock fragments. Limonite itabirites is typically difficult to distinguish from 
laterite that forms the normal carapace.  

Due to the climatic conditions in southern Cameroon, a laterite cap at the surface is 
widespread and thus it is important that a distinction is made between laterite and the oxidised 
itabirites.  

Limonite itabirite grades into haematite / goethite itabirites at depth and the transition is 
accompanied by increased preservation of banding and other fabric elements.  

6.3.3 Haematite magnetite and magnetite haematite BIF 

The weathered BIF at Nkout are invariably admixtures of haematite and magnetite. They may 
be earthy, firm to clayey, friable, and crumbly or biscuity and many are moderate to well 
banded. The banding is variable in thickness (1 mm to 1 cm) and consists of alternating 
haematite with varying proportions of magnetite or goethite (or both) and quartz rich layers.  

The haematite is typically fine-grained, red and ocherous, and at other times, amorphous, 
streaked-out or occurring as grey scaly masses that frequently contain relict magnetite. Quartz 
is typically fine to medium grained and is frequently granoblastic and polygonal in texture.   

6.3.4 Magnetite BIF 

Magnetite BIF, being the dominant lithology in the area is often well banded, allowing the 
distinction of two subtypes, with one variety having thickened bands ("CMB"), while the other 
is more compact with thinner banding ("FMB"). Subsets of the former are locally garnetiferous 
and termed GMB, reflecting a more aluminous protolith or increase in metamorphic grade.   

Susceptibility readings above 500 units, with a density above 3.3 g/cm3 characterise the 
magnetite BIF. The BIF are white-grey in colour where quartz is dominant and blue-grey 
where magnetite dwarfs the quartz grains. The blue-grey magnetite BIF tends to be finer 
grained and is frequently accompanied by matrix forming chlorite, green amphibole and/or 
epidote.  

The magnetite may have augen textures with aspect ratios greater than 3:1 near shear or fault 
zones. Spotty, less banded types are common where the BIF is recrystallised adjacent to late 
granite intrusions. In some instances they form dense glomero-megacrystic aggregates. 

Magnetite BIF and the change to haematite magnetite BIF is largely due to oxidation. 
Supporting evidence is that slightly weathered haematite BIF contains appreciable amounts of 
magnetite. Furthermore, both the haematite magnetite BIF and magnetite BIF (found deeper in 
boreholes) have identical contacts with metasediments suggesting they are the same unit.

6.3.5 Non-itabirite Lithologies 

Non-itabirite sedimentary rocks fall into a number of subgroups. The main grouping is the 
metasediments ("MS"). Metasediments are generally mesocratic and appear similar to the BIF 
although less banded and coarser in grain size. They are indicated to be co-genetic with the 
itabirites given that they sometimes contain thin magnetite itabirite bands and vice versa. 

The rock types include chlorite and grunerite schists with quartz ± magnetite (<5% magnetite).  
These metasediments are sometimes almandine-garnet bearing ("GMS") and the timing of 
garnet formation appears to have significance for remnant magnetism studies.  

Metasediments have layers with up to 3% pyrite that may represent lateral changes in facies 
during sedimentation. However, some pyrite is due to late stage granite mobilisation and fluid 
entry. 

In addition, the stratigraphic sequence contains bedded conformable quartz bands, quartzites 
(of undoubted sedimentary origin) and quartz veins that in places have been brecciated by low 
angle faults. 

Underlying the BIF and metasediments are granitic gneisses and migmatites with banding on 
multiple scales that are considered to be basement ("GNbq"). The gneisses contain 
leucosomes of quartz and oligoclase with hornblende and schlieren biotite. The largest bands 
are typically on a metre scale and this banding is widely repeated at the centimetre and 
millimetre scale. Leucocratic bands often alternate in thickness with melanocratic portions, and 
each encloses smaller bands of the other. 

6.3.6 Syn-to late-techtonic pegmatite and granitoid intrusions 

Intrusive granites are heterogeneous and show significant variations in deformation style 
relative to the BIF, metasediments and granitic basement. Tourmaline granites ("GRt") 
unequivocally cut and have sharp contacts with BIF and range from 0.5 mm to over 5 m in 
width. The larger veins are texturally granoblastic, but smaller veins are banded or foliated and 
may be mistaken for GNbq. All intrusive granites contain quartz, feldspar, tourmaline and 
biotite. 

Tourmaline grains are typically hemimorphic and columnar, but are also found in stubby form, 
associated with micas or chlorite. Tourmaline granites may be brecciated and the most 
common is an orthoclase bearing pegmatoid with intensely broken feldspar and quartz, 
displaying sub-grain formation implying annealing and strain recovery.   

The granitic intrusives are known to carry some sulphides, mainly pyrite and pyrrhotite. 

6.3.7 Quartz bands and veins 

Quartz bands ("QB") and quartz veins ("QV"), including quartz chlorite veins, are common.  

Observations associated with QV include: 

• Quartz grains in veins are largely shapeless, colourless, white or smoky. 

• Clear quartz veins tend to have sharp boundaries. 

• Smoky quartz-bearing veins are typically medium grained and densely packed. 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 27 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

• Fine-grained (aplitic) varieties regularly have hornfelsed borders. These often contain 
matrix mica (biotite) and are recognized primarily by an increase in the amount of 
quartz, a weakening in cleavage intensity and a decrease in chlorite content. Their finer 
grain size may be due to strain induced grinding, comminution and/or recrystallisation. 

• Zoning is common, the normal case being a quartz-pegmatite core girdled by an aplite 
selvage rather like chilling along the margins of an intrusion. 

6.3.8 Transitional units 

At this stage, the transitional units as shown in Table 6-2, at contacts between the principal 
rock types are included in the stratigraphy. The multiple thin-banded alternations of any two 
units before a change in the succession may be reflecting varve-like cyclic sedimentation or 
local imbrications by thrusting.

6.3.9 Transported BIF material 

Shallow vertical hole drilling (saprolite holes) has shown that areas of red top soil and 
ferricrete away from the ridge crests at Nkout and Ngoa (approximately 4 km south west of 
Nkout) do not necessarily overlie BIF, and that the subsurface in these locations is frequently 
underlain by granitic basement gneiss.  

It is important to note, however, that the saprolite hole programme has also demonstrated at 
Nkout that there are wide expanses of surface derived scree and talus debris that have been 
transported away from the BIF ridges via mass movement which (in certain areas) are 
sufficiently enriched and deep in places that they could be considered as part of the Mineral 
Resource Estimate after more detailed investigations. 

6.4 Nkout Deposit Structure 

The Project area (including Ngoa) has been interpreted as an antiform from magnetic imagery, 
a synform from early core data and a fold thrust belt involving thrusting of younger material 
over the CC from regional considerations. In all of these interpretations, the orientation of the 
banding has played a key role in the interpretation.  

The primary structure evident at Nkout is the itabirite banding characterised by varve-like 
laminae in outcrop as shown in Figure 6-4. The banding is akin to sedimentary bedding. 
metamorphic foliation in the sediments is parallel to the itabirite banding where both are 
juxtaposed.

Quartzite Drillcore of the Basal Thrust at Ngoa (showing an extensional 
vein) 

6.4.1 Main structural elements 

The main structural elements of Nkout include the variable strike and dip and the disruption by 
faults of the BIF outcrop (Figure 6-5), some of which can be traced by shifts in the Total 
Magnetic Intensity ("TMI") bands.  

The rounded BIF outcrop at Ngoa (approximately 4 km south west of Nkout) is suggested to 
have either formed above an unconformity or thrust in to place along a fault, given that the BIF 
outcrops are restricted to higher ground and drilling reveals the presence of slivers of 
brecciated quartzite beneath the BIF. Extended veins (basaltic in appearance) within the 
quartzite provide further evidence for thrust movement and are interpreted as devitrified 
pseudotachylyte arising from frictional melting (Figure 6-4).

6.4.2 Faulting 

Numerous map-scale faults are recorded in the Project area. The faults are typically rectilinear 
and a few are curved. Some are indicated by displacements of the total TMI, while others are 
marked by tectonic breccia in core. The faults appear to have dip and strike-slip movement 
components and offset the itabirite sequence. Displacements along the faults (identified in 
core) are largely unknown; however, areas affected by faulting may be clearly indicated by 
fault gouge or brecciated chlorite-epidote amphibole rock infillings. 

The faulting is relatively easily observed in fresh drill core; however, it is more difficult to 
discern in oxidised material. The faults are typically 1 mm-3 m wide, but their true widths have 
not been established as they cut the itabirite banding at different angles in core.  

The intensity of deformation along thrust faults (indicated by rotation of δ-type magnetite 
porphyroblasts and overprinting by numerous brittle fractures), notably evidenced in drillhole 
NKDD003 (Figure 6-6), is known to have truncated the BIF, resulting in a thinning of up to 
240 m on a local scale.

Figure 6-6: Significant BIF Deformation along Thrust Fault Intersecting NKDD003, 
Identified by Afferro at Nkout (Source: Afferro, 2010) 

 
Two faults with apparent strike slip displacement possibly bound the area of Nkout Centre 
investigated to date and are shown in Figure 6-7. The western fault (Ebeh Fault) has 
exposures of mylonites with sub horizontal lineations and thus reinforcing strike sip 
displacement. The fault in the east appears to have a rotational component as the dips of the 
BIF immediately east across the fault are southerly unlike the northerly dips in the western 
block. Furthermore, the BIF widens and is weakly magnetic indicating deeper burial and 
thickening again from the thinning in the horse structure uplifted by the thrust fault under 
drillhole NKDD003.  

The major strike-slip faults identified at Nkout are shown schematically (with major fold axes) 
in Figure 6-7. Due to the limited drilling data in the fault areas, the faults have not as yet been 
incorporated in to the geological model.

6.4.3 Metamorphism related to structure 

The first generation fabric (S1) at Nkout and Ngoa is a lithology parallel foliation that is 
particularly well developed within the BIF and metasediment horizons. Within these units, the 
S1 fabric is highly variable in strike and dip due to later refolding.  

The S1 foliation is defined by chlorite, biotite, nematoblastic grunerite, magnetite quartz and 
feldspar and occasionally sericite and garnet. In the psammitic layers, S1 is defined by 
elongation of quartz aggregates and the alignment of minor muscovite and biotite laths. F1 
folds are also associated with axial planar garnet blastesis and flattening in some 
metasediment and BIF horizons. 

Peak metamorphic conditions were reached during F1 folding, coincident with garnet 
porphyroblastesis and strain induced syn and late-tectonic recrystallisation. F1 introduced the 
regrowth of quartz in BIF and sediment banding while reorienting biotite and feldspar grains in 
the basement gneisses. Temperatures were high enough for remobilisation of parts of the 
granitic gneiss by anatectic melts associated with limited alkali and boron metasomatism. The 
latter is evidenced by deformed tourmaline rich orthoclase and microcline bearing granites that 
have aureoles of recrystallised coarser grained faintly BIF adjacent to them. 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 32 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

F2 metamorphic conditions involved a much lower grade, evidenced by an incipient spaced 
fracture cleavage in quartzitic laminae in the BIF at Nkout and Ngoa (especially in the east in 
both cases) with limited reorientation and growth of haematite and quartz in cleavage. 

6.5 SRK Preliminary Structural Interpretation 

To assist with the Mineral Resource Estimate update, a preliminary desktop study of Nkout's 
structural geology was undertaken. This structural review was limited to the western end of 
Nkout Centre and utilised lithological and structural logs, core photographs and the TMI 
analytic signal map. Based on these data, SRK identified a rotation of the main BIF unit from 
ENE/E trend in the west to a northeast-southwest trend in the east. This is clearly evidenced in 
the geometry of the magnetic signal and by a rotation of banding data in the structural log. 
Two potential mechanisms are proposed for the origin of this rotation: 

1. Drag folding of the western most BIF in Nkout Centre, related to dextral offset on the 
NNW trending Ebeh strike-slip fault (Figure 6-5).  

2. Re-orientation of banding by a series of north-west trending shear zones within western 
Nkout Centre (Figure 6-8) 

 

Figure 6-8: Oblique, NW facing (azimuth = 325°, plunge = 41°) View of NW Trending 
Shear Zones Modelled as Surfaces (blue) Overlain on the TMI Analytical 
Signal Image. All NW striking structural data displayed in green and 
moderately high (orange) to high (red) strain intervals marked on the 
drillhole traces (Source SRK, June 2012). 

 
 
 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 33 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

Stereographic projections of banding data within the rotated portion of Nkout Centre indicate 
two dominant structural trends: (1) a progressively northeast trending fabric pertaining to 
primary banding of the rotated BIF unit; and (2) a northwest-southeast trend thought to 
represent the influence of a series of north-west trending shear zones. A basic strain 
classification log, developed from analysis of core photographs, indicates the presence of 
numerous north-west trending high or very high strain zones within western Central Nkout, 
which are likely to be an expression of north-west trending shears. On this basis, four sub-
parallel north-west trending shear zones have been tentatively identified and modelled within 
the rotated portion of Nkout Centre (Figure 6-8). The zones typically dip at 55-70° to the north-
east and strike between 110° and 120°.  

It should be noted, however, that much of the northwest-southeast trending structural data is 
in areas of low strain, convolute or complexly folded BIF. It is likely that this data represents 
south-east trending limbs of parasitic folding within these low strain areas, rather than high 
strain shears. As a result, it is SRK's opinion that the rotation of the BIF unit in western Central 
Nkout is the result of a combination of drag folding related to the Ebeh dextral strike-slip fault 
and re-orientation via a series of minor northwest-trending shear zones, although the temporal 
relationship between these events is, as yet, unclear. 

6.5.1 Recommendations 

As part of MRE 4, SRK recommended the following in order to gain a greater understanding of 
the structural controls on BIF occurrence and geometry at Nkout: 

• Undertake a more detailed study into the structural geology of Nkout, based on 
relogging of key drillholes, to assist in better defining of resource geometry. 

• Correlate local-scale structure with regional-scale structure as a validation/check of any 
new model.  

• Review the structural logging and structural QA/QC procedures to ensure the quality of 
on-going data collection. 

This proposed work is currently on-going and will be incorporated into future Mineral Resource 
Estimate updates. 

6.6 Mineralisation 

The BIF is of the magnetite facies and is hosted by thinly bedded and alternating layers of 
meta-sediments and chlorite-grunerite schist. Two styles of BIF are present within the Project 
area: weathered oxidised BIF (saprolite) below the laterite duricrust, and the underlying 
primary BIF of the Nkout formation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 

Page 34 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

The lateritic duricrust caps the weathered and primary BIF mineralisation and varies up to 
10 m in thickness. The mineral assemblage in the laterite duricrust is dominated by haematite-
goethite-limonite ±magnetite. Below the laterite duricrust, the weathered oxidised BIF retains 
the primary textural fabrics and the mineral assemblage is characterised as being haematite-
magnetite-goethite-limonite-martite-silica plus clay minerals. Quartz dominates the gangue 
mineralogy, with other minerals including chlorite, grunerite, sericite, biotite, garnet and iron 
silicates being reported. The weathered oxidised BIF is up to 90 m in thickness. The primary 
BIF is characterised by alternating layers of magnetite-silica bands contained within the schist 
beds. The magnetite silica bands are predominantly layered parallel to the banding although 
intense recrystallisation is evident that has resulted in a coarse grained magnetite fabric 
displaying various foliation trends. 

The mineralisation sequence exhibited at Nkout is typical of the tropical weathering profile of 
iron ore deposits in the region.

6.6.1 Mineralisation division 

Nkout mineralisation can be divided into several types according to magnetic susceptibility, 
density, mineral abundances, the relative widths of the quartz and magnetite-rich layers in the 
itabirite banding and weathering.   

For example, low magnetic values are derived from limonite itabirite, haematite dominant 
itabirite and metasediments in the mineralisation. Associated magnetic susceptibility is 
typically between 0-50 kappa. In contrast, the corresponding ranges in magnetite itabirite are 
250 - 900 kappa.  

6.6.2 Mineralisation controls 

Primary mineralisation controls are understood to have been associated with favourable Fe-
rich stratigraphic horizons with little clastic sedimentation, metamorphic enhancement of grain 
size, structural thickening during deformation and folding, and subsequent weathering and 
enrichment of the oxide mineralisation. 

6.6.3 Typical mineralogical abundances 

Assay results reveal the potential for significant Fe content within the BIF, whereby the 
dominant magnetite facies shows a Fe total content of approximately 32%, of which 87% is 
related to magnetite (Fe3O4). The oxidised cap shows Fe grades of between 30% Fe and 
71.6% Fe.   

Within the BIF and in terms of other initial elemental abundances, phosphorus concentration is 
relatively low with a mean weight percentage of 0.047%; aluminium is variable and averages 
at 3%; silica has mean assay of 46.8% and sulphur analyses from all holes are often low at 
0.11% and often below the detection limit (<0.01%).

7 DEPOSIT TYPE 

7.1 Deposit type 

The deposits within the Licence area are examples of a broad group of magnetite-dominated, 
BIF that occur throughout West and Central Africa. The deposits are comprised of units or 
beds of magnetite bearing quartzites that are concordant with the surrounding host rocks. 

The Mineral Resource Estimate is based on a 12 km portion of a larger 20 km east-west 
regional trending magnetite BIF. SRK has created a geological model based on the lithological 
logging and magnetic susceptibility characteristic of this deposit type which in conjunction with 
interpretations of the aeromagnetic data have formed the basis of further deposit definition and 
regional exploration programmes. 

The geological zones created are primarily based on the Fe distribution identified through 
statistical analysis and are characteristic of the Project and in keeping with projects throughout 
West and Central Africa. 

7.2 Regional Deposits 

The major iron ore deposits of potential economic importance in the region include Afferro's 
Ntem project in southern Cameroon, Mbalam (Cameroon and Congo), Avima, Nabeba and 
Bandondo (Congo) and Belinga (Gabon). 

The region around Cameroon, Gabon and Congo has a cluster of Fe deposits, as shown in 
Figure 3-1. None of these deposits is, however, currently in production.

8 EXPLORATION 

8.1 Introduction 

This section briefly describes the nature of the exploration data available for the Project. With 
the exception of the surface sampling that commenced in 2006 and the airborne gravity 
surveys, exploration activities have been through drilling methods. The previous exploration 
phases are described in section 5. 

A description of the sampling methods, sample quality and the samples collected is set out in 
section 10 of this report, on sample preparation, analyses and security. 

All available and valid exploration data as at March 2013 has been used to generate an 
updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Project, which is fully disclosed in section 13. 

8.2 Diamond drilling programme 

8.2.1 Background 

MRE 1 utilised the phase 1 drilling data totalling 31 completed holes at the Nkout Centre 
magnetic anomaly. The phase 1 diamond drill core programme was undertaken to satisfy two 
key objectives: 

• to further investigate the local geometry, extent and continuity of the mineralisation 
suggested from the interpretations of the aeromagnetic data associated with the central 
Nkout area and the northern and summit areas of Ngoa  (Figure 8-2); and  

• to obtain an Inferred Mineral Resource on the magnetite BIF and assess the economic 
potential of the oxidised cap. 

A flexible approach was taken in terms of drill pad positioning to allow for modification 
following identification of prospective or waste areas from logging and assay results, and 
unworkable or steep ground.  

MRE 2 utilised 59 drillholes for a total of 9,864 m and included drill data for Nkout East. The 
key objectives of the drilling leading up to MRE 2 were: 

• to upgrade a portion of Nkout Centre BIF to the Indicated Resource category; 

• to increase the continuity and geological understanding of the oxidised cap at Nkout 
Centre; and 

• to test the Nkout East magnetic anomaly with wide spaced reconnaissance holes. 

On completion of MRE 3, 138 drillholes, totalling 20,680 m had been completed across the 
Nkout Centre, Nkout East and Nkout West targets. In completing this metreage, the key 
objectives were: 

• to define and upgrade Nkout Centre BIF to the Indicated Resource category; 

• to increase the continuity and geological understanding of the oxidised cap at Nkout 
Centre; 

• to test the Nkout East magnetic anomaly with wide spaced reconnaissance holes and 
first past deep drilling to establish Inferred resources; and 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 40 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

• to test the Nkout West magnetic anomaly with wide spaced reconnaissance holes. 

MRE 4 utilised 262 drillholes for a total of 33,096 m and included additional drill data for Nkout 
East, Nkout Centre and Nkout West. The key objectives of the drilling were: 

• to further upgrade Nkout Centre BIF to the Indicated Resource category; 

• to upgrade a portion of the oxidised cap at Nkout Centre from the Inferred to Indicated 
Resource category; 

• to test the oxidised cap at Nkout East with 200 m spaced holes and developing an 
Inferred Resource and further defining any potential high grade (DSO) material; and 

• to develop the Nkout West magnetic anomaly at depth and generate an Inferred 
Resource and test further potential for high grade material. 

8.2.2 Updated Work programme 

Drilling at the Project has been largely continuous since the completion of MRE 1 in 
January2011 through to this Mineral Resource Estimate. The programme, that is on-going, 
has resulted in a total of 459 drillholes for a total of 45,680 m drilled with analysis that can be 
utilised by this update. The key objectives of the drill programme utilised in this Mineral 
Resource Estimate were: 

• to test the Nkout D8 magnetic anomaly with wide spaced reconnaissance holes; 

• to upgrade a portion of the oxidised cap at Nkout East from the Inferred to the Indicated 
Resource category; 

• to further test and define the potential for high grade material at Nkout East; and 

• to incorporate new/additional density and metallurgical test work into the Mineral 
Resource Estimate. 

Figure 8-1 shows all drillholes completed for use in this Mineral Resource Estimate. The 
drilling covers a strike length of approximately 12 km over the Nkout Centre, Nkout East, 
Nkout West and D8 anomalies.

8.2.3 Drill Spacing / Deposit Split 

The primary drill spacing across Nkout in the magnetite BIF is 400 mX by 200 mY and 200 mX 
by 50 mY in the oxidised cap (100 mX by 50 mY in areas with high prospectivity for high grade 
material. All drillholes targeting the primary BIF are angled and dip at approximately 50° to the 
south and all shallow drillholes targeting the oxidised cap are sub-vertical (85°) and have been 
drilled to the fresh BIF contact.  

First pass drilling at Nkout East was completed on a predominant 400 mX by 200 mY spacing 
in the magnetite BIF and 200 mX by 50 mY in the oxidised cap. Drillholes in the oxide cap 
have been later infilled to 100 mX by 50 mY in areas deemed to have potential for high grade 
material. These drillholes at Nkout East are inclined at 50° to the south to target the primary 
BIF, shallow drill holes targeting the oxide cap are sub-vertical (-85°) . The primary objective of 
the Nkout East drill programme after testing the validity of the magnetic anomaly was to 
complete the drilling on a 400 mX by 200 mY drill spacing targeting the magnetite BIF 
delineated during the first phase of drilling. Multiple additional phases of drilling have also 
been undertaken targeting the oxidised cap to establish and define any potential for high 
grade material.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

Drilling at Nkout West is on a predominantly 400 mX by 200 mY spacing. Drillholes at Nkout 
West are predominantly shallow and inclined at 50° to the south. The first pass drill 
programme completed targeted fresh hangingwall footwall contacts near surface on a 800 mX 
line spacing. The focus of the Nkout West drilling since has tested the validity of the magnetic 
anomaly with the drillholes terminating in the fresh BIF or ideally through the anticipated 
footwall contact of the BIF. A second phase drill programme targeted the primary fresh BIF 
mineralisation to prove continuity at depth and extend the current classified resource material 
has been undertaken on a 400 mX line spacing. 

An initial phase of drilling has also been undertaken on the magnetic signature of the D8 
anomaly. This drilling on a nominal 400 mX by 100 mY drill spacing has been undertaken to 
validate the magnetic signature and has targeted potential high grade material within the oxide 
material terminating on intersecting the fresh underlying BIF. 

Of the 459 drillholes completed to date, 23 drillholes (5,417 m) are located at Nkout West, 109 
drillholes (9,443 m) are located at Nkout East and 272 drillholes (26,996 m) are located at 
Nkout Centre and 39 drillholes (1,987.63 m). In addition to this, 16 holes (1,836 m) have been 
completed on additional exploration targets within the Licence area (specifically on the D3 
anomaly). 

9 DRILLING 

9.1 Summary of the 2010 drill programme 

For use in MRE 1, Afferro completed 4,359 m from 31 holes in a programme that commenced 
at the end of July 2010.  

Drilling was carried out in part by the South African-based firm Geosearch with a CS 14 drill 
rig, which (amongst others) focused on drilling the deep holes targeting the magnetite BIF 
mineralisation.  

Some twenty two shallow saprolite drillholes were completed with the Afferro-owned 
Hydracore rigs.  

9.2 Afferro 2011-2013 Drilling 

An additional 428 drillholes (41,321 m) have been completed since MRE 1. In addition to the 
CS 14 drill rig described above, Afferro has added an additional two CS 14 rigs as well as 
three Hydracore rigs and a further custom made Fordia 1400mN style 'GoldenBear' rig. 
Drilling has remained focussed on infilling the Nkout Centre, Nkout East and Nkout West 
anomalies, with the aim of upgrading the resource to the Indicated Resource category and 
extending and developing the programme out to the D8 anomaly. In total, 410 holes were 
drilled targeting the oxidised resources and an additional 49 holes have been completed 
targeting the BIF mineralisation. 

The entire exploration drillhole dataset is shown in Figure 9-1 and set against the SRK BIF 
mineralisation wireframes.

9.3 Summary of drillhole location 

Appendix A shows the locations of all drillholes at Nkout. 

9.4 Summary of major intersections 

Appendix B shows the modelled intersections in the key mineralisation zones identified at 
Nkout based on the 5 m composite drillhole file generated (section 13.2). Zone 110 equates to 
the high grade oxidised BIF (>60% Fe), zone 120 equates to the medium grade oxidised 
material (45 to 60% Fe), zone 130 equates to the low grade oxidised material (30 to 45% Fe), 
zone 160 equates to an elevated phosphorous zone within the oxidised cap and zone 210 
equates to the fresh magnetite BIF. Five drillholes still have no assays available, although the 
geological logging data, in addition to the magnetic susceptibility data was available to assist 
in the geological interpretations. 

In zone 110, there is a maximum intersection thickness of 58.03 m averaging 60.48% Fe. In 
zone 120, there is a maximum intersection thickness of 60 m averaging 54.6% Fe. In zone 
130, there is a maximum intersection thickness of 65 m averaging 36.77%. In zone 160, there 
is a maximum intersection thickness of 34.5 m averaging 57.56%, and in zone 210 there is a 
maximum intersection thickness of 482 m averaging 34.24% Fe. 

9.5 Summary of Drilling Results 

A total of 16,486 assays have been analysed, which amounts to 36,939 m of samples. Core 
recovery (detailed in section 10.6) is generally found to be moderate to good throughout the 
oxidised material (78.49%) and very good in the fresh rock (87.48%). Units geologically 
interpreted as Fe bearing within the oxides (HMB/CMB/FMB) return a recovery of 82.77% 
across the Project area while core recovery within interpreted fresh units 
(HMB/CMB/FMB/GMB) averages 93.95%. In general, SRK considers the core recovery data 
typical for the type of deposit under study with no material impact on the Project.

Nkout Centre, Nkout East, Nkout West and D8 are separate areas with an east-west gap of 
approximately 350 m between Nkout Centre and Nkout East and an east-west gap of 2.8 km 
between the western extent of Nkout West and D8. Nkout Centre and Nkout West are 
contiguous along strike but are offset by some 120 m north-south. Nkout Centre, Nkout East, 
Nkout West and D8 are split into a fresh BIF and oxidised BIF. The oxidised BIF is split further 
into a high grade, medium grade and low grade material types. The BIF unit dips at 
approximately 60° and is up to 500 m in true thickness in the western end of Nkout Centre. On 
average, the BIF unit is approximately 120 m in true thickness.  

Internal metasedimentary waste zones have been interpreted throughout all three Nkout 
areas. These have been limited to a minimum thickness of 5 m and are up to 80 m in 
thickness.  

The total volume of the BIF and oxidised wireframes equals 1,325.73 Mm3 and the total 
volume of the internal waste zones equals 39.23 Mm3.

10 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES & SECURITY 

10.1 Grab sampling 

A grab sampling programme was undertaken during 2006, where 44 rock samples identified 
as either BIF, ferricrete or quartzitic BIF were collected and sent for Fe and subsequently 
(sulphide associated) gold analysis at OMAC laboratories, Ireland ("OMAC"). 

All sample collection carried out by the Project staff was supervised by Afferro geologists. 

No further grab sampling was undertaken prior to the 2010 drilling campaign. 

10.2 Afferro Recent Sampling Methods and Approaches 

Sampling is carried out by Afferro Project geologists and SRK considers these methodologies 
to be consistent with industry best practice. 

Afferro has put in place a logical logging and sampling flow sheet (Figure 10-1) in order to 
guide the on-site staff through the technical process. This aims to ensure a consistent 
methodology for the process of submitting the samples for external laboratory analysis.

10.2.1 Core photography 

Core and core blocks are placed in core boxes by the driller. Upon receipt in the core shed, 
the drillcore is cleaned or washed, if required, and core blocks are checked by Afferro staff. 
The core is then photographed wet and dry in a frame ensuring a constant angle and distance 
from the camera.  

10.2.2 Magnetic susceptibility 

Following core photography, multiple magnetic susceptibility readings are taken every metre. 
For unconsolidated core. this is measured in situ. Results are averaged over the metre 
intercept, recorded in SI units (kappa) and written in the assay log sheet. 

10.2.3 Logging 

Geotechnical logging is carried out to record core diameter, bit size, depths, intervals, core 
recovery, weathering index, RQD, fracture index, jointing and joint wall alteration and a simple 
geological description. For oriented core, more detailed point data based depth, alpha and 
beta angles of fabrics are recorded (Figure 10-2).  

Geological logging then follows to record detailed from-to data, including depths, rock codes 
and brief descriptions of the lithological units and angles of contacts.

10.2.4 Bulk density 

Bulk density readings are taken at 2 m intervals within each lithology and on every lithological 
break. The methodology involves weighing samples in air and water using a balance, and 
wrapping the porous samples in plastic. Measurements are carried out on competent whole 
core (typically 10-15 cm pieces) using a balance with top and modified under-slung measuring 
capabilities with a detection limit of ±1 gm (Figure 10-3).   

 
Figure 10-3: Measurement of Competent Bulk Density from Drill Core 

 
The balance is regularly checked and re-calibrated using certified weights. In lithological units 
of less than 1 m thickness, a single sample is measured, while in thicker units, one sample 
every 2 to 3 m is measured.  

 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 48 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

Density measurements are carried out using Archimedean principles for consolidated fresh 
core and mass/volume determinations on loose granular material.  

Bulk density for consolidated material is calculated using the formula W1/(W1-(W3-(W2-W1)-
(W4-W1))), where W1 is dry weight, W2 is weight with plastic, W3 is weight in water and W4 is 
the wet weight. 

For unconsolidated material, historically density measurements have been measured by filling 
to the brim a container of known volume and the density is the weight of the sample divided by 
this volume. 

Due to the unconsolidated nature of the material, it has been recognised that the volumetric 
test work carried out could be problematic due to the level of manual handling of the sample 
and introduction of porosity during the process.  

As such, SRK is of the opinion that the current density results for the unconsolidated oxide 
material from Nkout was potentially being underestimated in the 110 and 120 zones. As such, 
SRK concluded during a recent site visit that a new methodology for in situ testing should be 
verified and enacted (Figure 10.4) based on grade/zone boundaries that can be identified at 
the surface expression of the deposit. The in situ testing is summarised below and was 
undertaken in April 2013 as part of the Qualified Person site visit. 

• Using the drill hole database, a target was generated adjacent to an existing drill hole 
intercepting the domained material at surface. 

• The area was prepared by removing all surface detritus and levelled to allow a test pit to 
be prepared. 

• A small pit was excavated from the sub surface with all material extracted recovered in 
sample bags for weighing. 

• The excavated pit was lined with a malleable water tight plastic bag with the corners cut 
to lay the "sides" flat above the pit. 

• With the aid of a known volume of water from a graduated container, the lined pit was 
carefully filled to the point of overflow with the volume of water recorded. 

• The wet density was then calculated using the following formula. Density (g/cm3)=Mass 
(g)/Volume(cm3). 

• Material recovered in sample bags is dried in a heated oven over a 12 hour period to 
drive off moisture and determine a dry weight. 

• The dry density of the excavated material is calculated. 

Some 102 samples with an average mass of approximately 80 kg were collected and 
evaluated to provide a statistically acceptable population and calculate, with respect to grade, 
the revised oxide densities for the near surface mineralisation. The results (Figure 10-5) show 
an increase in bulk density of approximately 10% from within the high grade material and the 
oxidised BIF or saprolite material.

10.2.5 Core sawing for sample preparation 

Sample intervals are measured by the Project geologists, who draw a line along the length of 
the core to indicate where it should be cut. The line is positioned at 90º to the predominant 
structure to ensure that both halves of the core represent the same geological feature. 

The core is then transferred to the core shed for cutting. Solid core is sawn in half with a core 
saw and unconsolidated material is split using spoons or trowels. 

Each (half core) sample interval is placed in a plastic bag and a sample ticket is included with 
the sample. The sample bag is labelled with the drillhole and sample numbers using a marker 
pen and is subsequently sent to the laboratory for assay. The remaining half-core is placed in 
storage. The samples are generally 2 m in length.  

10.3 Current Chain of Custody, Sample Preparation, and Analyses  

10.3.1 Sampling procedure overview 
Samples are sent from site (on a complete drillhole basis) directly to the ALS preparation 
facility in Yaoundé, along with documentation, which acts as a receipt for tracking purposes. 
Once prepared, the samples are dispatched to the ALS laboratory in Johannesburg . Samples 
can be monitored and tracked via the ALS website. 

10.3.2 Sample preparation at Yaoundé 
SRK visited the facility during the Qualified Person's site visit and found the conditions to be 
extremely clean and tidy and well organised in terms sample process flow and sample 
tracking. 

At the Yaoundé sample preparation facility, each sample (±3.5 kg) is dried to a core 
temperature of 105°C, jaw crushed to allow a nominal 70% material pass through a 2 mm 
screen, riffle split to 1 kg, then milled to a nominal 85% passing 75 um. An analytical pulp of 
approximately 200 g is sub-sampled, of which a 150 g sub-sample is prepared and sent for 
further analysis. 

10.3.3 Analytical procedures  
On arrival, the 150 to 200 g portions of prepared pulp are checked against the submission 
sheet, logged into the LIMS database, and homogenised to prevent segregation that might 
have occurred in transit. Large consignments of samples (>300) are split into smaller sub-
batches of 200 samples for convenience of processing. This practice was introduced in 2008 
as prior to this date every consignment was treated as a single batch. 

Samples are processed in batches of fifty. Each batch of fifty samples includes forty-four 
original samples, four duplicates (every tenth sample), one reference material and one reagent 
blank.  

10.3.4 AAS analysis 
Samples are weighed, mixed with flux and fused in clay crucibles. Lead buttons produced after 
fusions are then cupelled, forming dore prills that are digested in aqua regia, and digests are 
analysed for gold using a Varian AA Spectrometer.  

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 52 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

10.3.5 XRF analysis 
XRF analysis is carried out on fused beads. The beads are 27 mm in diameter and prepared 
by fusing 0.7 g of sample with 6.3 g of lithium tetraborate flux using Phoenix VFD6000 
automatic fluxer. The fusion is carried out in platinum crucibles and melt is cast on platinum 
dishes. Prepared beads are checked, packed in plastic bags, placed in storage boxes and 
submitted to the XRF room for analysis. Precision of the XRF analysis is ±3 % relative. 

In terms of accuracy, the Panalytical Axios XRF spectrometer is calibrated using 39 standards 
that are prepared using high purity oxides and mineral reference materials. 

The calibration range for the analytes of interest is between zero and the concentration levels 
shown in Table 10-1. 

Table 10-1: XRF Calibration Limits for Various Oxides 
Analyte Upper Calibration Point 
Al2O3 66 
CaO 49 

Cr2O3 10 
Fe2O3 100 
K2O 4 
MgO 20 
MnO 67 
Na2O 7 
P2O5 4 
SiO2 100 

TiO2 10 

 
Due to the very high stability of the XRF spectrometer, re-calibration is only carried out on a 
requirement basis, typically once every two to three months. A set of four monitors is run on a 
daily basis to provide correction for the instrument drift. 

The beads are analysed by the panalytical wavelength dispersive spectrometer for Fe, Al2O3, 
CaO, Cr2O3, K2O, MgO, MnO, Na2O, P2O5, SiO2 and TiO2. The majority of these analytes 
have a lower detection limit of 0.01%, with the exception of Na2O (0.05%) and P2O5 (0.005%).  

The standards used in the QA/QC programme are run at rate of one in every fifty beads. All 
standards are certified reference materials purchased from Euro-Norm, Canmet and Geostats.  

10.3.6 Analysis for sulphur 
For total sulphur, samples are analysed using an Eltra sulphur and carbon analyser, whereby 
the samples are combusted in an induction furnace (in a flow of oxygen) enabling a 
measurement of sulphur by an IR detector to a 0.01% lower detection limit. 

10.3.7 Analysis for FeO 
FeO is analysed for ferrous iron using potentiometric titration. A 0.5 g sample is digested in a 
mixture of sulphuric and hydrofluoric acid and the resulting digests are titrated with potassium 
dichromate using a Metrohm auto titrator to a 0.20% lower detection limit. 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 53 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

10.3.8 Loss on ignition  
Loss on ignition ("LOI") is determined using the following methodology. A 0.5 g sample is 
weighed in a ceramic crucible, ignited for two hours in a muffle furnace set at 1000ºC and then 
weighed again. LOI is calculated as the percentage of change in weight when comparing the 
sample before and after ignition. The lower detection limit is 0.01%. 

10.3.9 Laboratory accreditations 
OMAC is accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Board to ISO 17025 and fire assay is 
included in the Schedule of Accreditation. It participates in inter-laboratory proficiency test 
programmes organised twice yearly by Geostats, Australia and CANMET, Canada 
consistently achieving good result and in certification programs, organised by manufacturers 
of reference materials. 

ALS laboratories are ISO 17025 accredited, NATA accredited, or follow accreditation 
guidelines as part of their Quality Management Systems. 

10.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedures 

10.4.1 Afferro QA/QC protocols 

Afferro's quality assurance protocols have gone through several cycles with various 
consultants contributing to the present status. In the 2006 campaign, QA/QC protocols simply 
relied on reference material supplied by the laboratory and a barren granite sample 
considered as a blank.  

QA/QC procedures were introduced from the beginning of the recent drill programmes, with 
the protocol incorporating the use of blanks, duplicates and certified reference material 
("CRM") together inserted into the sample stream at an insertion rate of one in twenty (or 5%). 
The blank material is sourced from non-magnetic sand from Yaoundé.  

Six CRM, each in 50 g sealed sachets of different concentrations and LOI are inserted, with 
three suitable for oxidised rock and the others for fresh rock. CRM are monitored via a robust 
assessment of laboratory returns using ±2 standard deviations to establish that they are 
sufficiently accurate and suited to the mineralisation related to the Project. Re-assays are 
ordered for problematic CRM.  

Prior to the insertion of the referee samples, final checking is carried out in the presence of a 
senior geologist and two field assistants at the camp, to ensure sample ID are correct, 
samples are intact and there are no omissions. Field samples collected are stored in a secure 
facility at the field base camp guarded by a private security firm before being dispatched to the 
preparation laboratory. 

Once the checks are complete, quality control standards and blank samples are inserted at 
pre-determined intervals. The standards and certified reference materials are bought from 
suppliers abroad and couriered to Cameroon.

All samples going to the laboratory are accompanied by a chain of custody form which 
contains sample ID, location, and approximate weight and assay instructions. Also included 
are the drivers name and license number of the vehicle conveying the samples. There is a 
section for the laboratory representative to sign and affix the date samples were received. 
Three copies are sent and they are signed by a senior member of the geological staff before 
the samples leave the field. 

10.5 SRK QA/QC Analysis 

SRK undertook an analysis of the QA/QC data provided by Afferro. This includes blanks, 
standards and duplicates as described above.

Figure 10-6 to Figure 10-11 show the Fe performance of the OMAC laboratory analysis of the 
samples GIOP-32, GIOP-31, GIOP-15, GIOP-7, GIOP-27 and GIOP 57 which all relate to the 
sampling of the fresh BIF where sufficient sample population has been acquired to allow 
analysis. 

Figure 10-12 to Figure 10-16 show the Fe performance of the OMAC laboratory analysis of the 
samples GIOP-32, GIOP-31, GIOP-27, GIOP-15 and GIOP-57, which all relate to the 
sampling of the oxidised material (saprolite). 

The majority of the 80 GIOP-32 sample standards are shown to be within two standard 
deviations (confidence limits) providing a robust correlation with the expected grade. Although 
41% (33) samples operate outside of the defined confidence these samples bare little 
relationship to each other and fall both above and below the accepted envelope. It is however 
noted there is sufficient positive drift (localised within the BIF samples) in the more recent 
sample returns which may suggest over estimation of Fe% within this grade range. Although 
this would appear to have reverted to well within acceptable limits and so is currently not 
considered sufficient to cause concern, this CRM should be monitored closely. The sample 
mean indicates good correlation with the expected value over analysis of the global 
population. Four samples act outside of three standard deviations and are deemed sample 
switches.  

 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 55 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

The 174 GIOP-31 standard samples indicate that 81% of the results fall within the set 
confidence limits. Over time, the CRM maintains a robust correlation with the expected 
grades. Four samples are outside of acceptable limits; however, these are considered sample 
switches. It is also noted that reporting of GIOP-31 appears to be consistently below the 
expected mean. 

The 148 GIOP-57 standard samples indicate that 50% (74) of the results are operating outside 
of two standard deviations. Although majority of the sample shows negative drift and 
underestimation about 0.6% of Fe. Although this would appear to have reverted to well within 
acceptable limits and so is currently not considered sufficient to cause concern, this CRM 
should be monitored closely. The sample mean indicates good correlation with the expected 
value over analysis of the global population. Six samples act outside of three standard 
deviations and are deemed sample switches.  

The 120 GIOP-15 samples indicate that 48.3% (58) of the results are operating outside of two 
standard deviations. Although majority of the sample shows negative drift and underestimation 
of about 0.6% Fe. Although this would appear to have reverted to well within acceptable limits 
and so is currently not considered sufficient to cause concern, this CRM should be monitored 
closely. The sample mean indicates good correlation with the expected value over analysis of 
the global population. Two samples act outside of three standard deviations and are deemed 
sample switches.  

GIOP-27 maintains a robust correlation with the expected assay grade throughout the 171 
samples which underwent analysis. However, recent batches suggest a negative trend 
towards underestimating Fe% within this grade range in latter samples. As with GIOP-31, at 
this stage this is well within accepted limits and does not present a cause for concern; 
however, this should be monitored closely to ensure no further deterioration in quality. Four 
samples have been identified as potential sample switches and approximately 42% of all 
samples are operating outside of two standard deviations. Although of concern, it is noted 
these samples operate both above and below the accepted limit with no consistent bias 
towards the overall global mean of the GIOP 27. 

GIOP-7 (5) currently has insufficient sample populations to warrant full analysis; however, all 
samples are all within two standard deviations (confidence limits) of the mean. 

Summary - Standards 

Although the sample number is generally not sufficient for all submitted CRM (as a result of 
introducing new grade ranges to fully represent all expected values) to draw definitive 
conclusions, the overlying indication from the results of the available QA/QC standards show 
that the majority of the samples fall within the set confidence limits, those samples which fall 
outside of perceived limits appear to be erratic in nature and result in both positive and 
negative influence. Therefore, over time, these results are considered to balance with regard 
to over and underestimation of grade. Little to no drift is consistently recorded over time, thus 
providing a reasonable degree of confidence in sample data quality. 

SRK would recommend this is monitored closely on a batch by batch analysis to ensure trends 
regarding either under or over estimation of grades does not develop. Due to the erratic nature 
of the CRM reporting, SRK would recommend this be brought to the attention of the reporting 
laboratory.

SRK further understand that the Company will now be sending all samples to the ALS 
laboratory in Johannesburg in place of the OMAC to improve sample turnaround times. As 
such, a representative suite of samples previously processed through OMAC should be 
compiled and submitted to ALS to ensure consistency in reporting.

10.5.2 Blanks 

Figure 10-17 and Figure 10-18 show the Fe results of the field blanks inserted into the sample 
stream for fresh BIF and the oxidised material. The Fe grade ranges from below detection limit 
to 2% and seems to show a bias towards a cyclic increasing Fe grade over time, as the 
ascending sample number relates to time/date assayed and it can be assumed that this is 
related to the settling of residual iron content within the locally sourced river sands. A series of 
batches have reported between 1.5-2% Fe, however, as this elevation is not reflected in the 
CRM for the same batches, it is considered a result of contaminated material used rather than 
bias or contaminated sample reporting.

Figure 10-18: Field blanks – %Fe Total Assays (Saprolite Assays) 

Summary – Blanks 

The Yaoundé river sand used as a blank is suggested to have residual Fe content. Due to the 
use of a sample with an inherent Fe content, it is unclear whether the grade deviation is due to 
grade fluctuations of the sand samples or due to sample contamination in the laboratory. An 
increasing Fe content over time may suggest a buildup of contamination in the laboratory. 
Attempts to homogenise this material prior to submission appear to have been unsuccessful 
and due to the rapidly advancing status of the Project is recommended a new source of local 
blank material is sourced.

10.5.3  Duplicates 

Figure 10-19 and Figure 10-20 show the results of the re-assayed duplicates for the Nkout 
data (fresh BIF and saprolite material, respectively). In total, 572 duplicate samples have been 
submitted for analysis, this being approximately 3.6% of the samples submitted for assaying.  

The duplicate samples show a strong correlation to the original sample, with a correlation 
coefficient of 0.99 in the fresh BIF and 0.99 in the saprolite, and thus SRK is confident in the 
repeatability of the sample preparation and analysis of these samples.

10.5.4 Umpire Laboratory 

No umpire laboratory is currently being used. 

10.5.5 QA/QC Summary 

Whilst it is not conclusive, SRK believes that the chosen blank, being river sand with an 
inherent Fe content, may not be suitable for purpose and that grade deviations in the results of 
the blank samples could be attributed to either the poor homogeneity of the blank or laboratory 
contamination. SRK recommends that the performance of the blank sample be monitored 
carefully over time to ensure that the blank material is appropriate. 

It is the recommendation of SRK that an umpire laboratory is used to further validate the 
existing laboratory facility. 

Overall, SRK considers that the results of the QA/QC show that the data is suitable for use in 
the Mineral Resource Estimate. 

A summary of the sample numbers incorporated, and the derived reference sample insertion 
rate is shown in Table 10-3.

10.6 Core Recovery Analysis 

Core recovery throughout the sample population is generally found to be moderate to good 
throughout the oxidised material (78.49%) and good in the fresh rock (87.48%). Units 
geologically interpreted as Fe bearing within the oxides (HMB/CMB/FMB) return a recovery of 
82.77% across the Project area while core recovery within interpreted fresh units 
(HMB/CMB/FMB/GMB) averages 93.95%. In general, SRK considers the overall core recovery 
data typical for the type of deposit under study with no material impact on the project. 

Further domain analysis would indicate that recovery within the modelled 110 (high grade) 
zone has been subject to poor recovery. Core recovery across the zone averages 73.21%. 
This average has increased from the previous Mineral Resource Estimate reports due to the 
selective drilling of the poorest holes and the trialling and implementation of different drilling 
techniques within this zone.

11 DATA VERIFICATION 
Qualified Person Howard Baker (MAusIMM(CP)) has verified that the data provided by Afferro 
appears to be correct and viable for use in a Mineral Resource Estimate. This involved viewing 
the majority of the drillholes at the core shed to check the quality of the logging, along with 
cross-checking assay certificates against the database. 

11.1 Data Received 

SRK was provided with the following list of documents and files to assist with the Mineral 
Resource Estimate: 

• Drillhole data: 

o Drillhole database, including collar coordinates, downhole survey measurements, 
elemental / oxide assay data, lithological logging data, magnetic susceptibility 
readings, Satmagan readings and Davis Tube recovery testwork data; and 

o QA/QC data to accompany the assay data. 

11.2 Database Validation 

SRK in combination with Afferro are responsible for maintaining the drillhole database. All data 
is stored on site in an access database. During 2011, the onsite SRK resource geologist was 
responsible for the overall data integrity and data validation and training of the Afferro personal 
in database maintenance. Since 2012, the onsite team has taken full responsibility for 
compiling and disseminating the validated drillhole component files, as listed above, to the 
SRK resource geology team based in the UK who have maintained overall control for integrity 
and validation. 

11.3 QA/QC 

The quality control measures that Afferro has put in place are discussed in the previous 
section. It is SRK's opinion that the procedures adopted have led to a reliable database and 
SRK is confident that the quality of the data is sufficient for use in a Mineral Resource 
Estimates, which have been established in conformity with generally accepted CIM 
"Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" guidelines. 

11.4 Topographic Survey 

MRE 1 utilised a topography surface taken from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 
("SRTM") and as such did not represent the most accurate survey method possible. Afferro 
has since instigated a survey team to establish a network of permanent ground markers 
around Nkout Centre, Nkout East, Nkout West and D8. Surveying at Nkout Centre was 
undertaken by a field survey team on a 25 m grid with lines at a decreasing spacing of 800 m, 
400 m and 200 m centres. SRK provided Afferro with the optimised Whittle pit shell from MRE 
1 with the survey initially being undertaken within the pit shell limits. This has since been 
extended to cover the Nkout East and West prospects and any future extension/expansion of 
the pit shell footprint. 

 

 
U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

To undertake the survey, lines were cleared by field teams across the strike of the Nkout 
Centre deposit with the lines being sighted with hand held GPS. Lines have to date been cut 
at an approximate 100 m line spacing with an infill 25 m line spacing currently being 
undertaken in both Nkout Centre and Nkout East. The cleared lines are in general 2 m wide. 

The survey along the cleared line is undertaken with a 1200 TPS and standard Leica Prism. 
Figure 11-1 shows the surveyed points at Nkout Centre and Nkout East as at June 2012. The 
topography at Nkout Centre and Nkout East is accurate on a consistent line spacing of 
approximately 50 m as shown by the grid lines in Figure 11-1. Additional surveying has 
commenced on 25 m line spacing; however, to date, this only covers the eastern portion of 
Nkout East and western portion of Nkout Centre. SRK notes that the survey has not further 
been updated since the release of MRE 4. 

SRK considers that the wireframe surface generated, that has linked the survey lines, will not 
accurately reflect the actual topography between the 100 m surveyed lines and outside of the 
initial area demarcated due to the extreme changes in slope angle observed. However, all 
drillhole lines are now accurately surveyed and the drill collars at Nkout Centre are consistent 
with the topographic surface.  Afferro is in the process of clearing lines on 200 m spacing over 
the Nkout West prospect which will later be in filled at 50 m spacing to enable a more accurate 
reflection of the topography to be produced.

Figure 11-2 shows the overall topography surface covering the Nkout Centre, Nkout East, 
Nkout West and D8 anomalies with the average 50 m line ground survey topography in Nkout 
Centre and Nkout East being merged with the SRTM survey that covers Nkout West and the 
remainder of the Licence.

11.5 SRK Comment on Data Quality 

SRK is confident that the quality of the data provided by Afferro is suitable for use in the 
production of a Mineral Resource Estimate. The collar, downhole survey and interval files 
have all been validated by SRK on site. However, the topographic survey is currently 
incomplete and accurate only on the wide spaced survey lines that formed part of the ground 
survey at the time of the Mineral Resource Estimate.

12 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
The following section describes and discusses the metallurgical testwork that has been 
conducted on the Nkout mineralisation since MRE 4. Pre-feasibility study ("PFS") testwork 
programmes have been carried out on DSO, saprolite and primary BIF material types. All 
three testwork programmes have been conducted by SGS, Perth, Australia. 

12.1 Testwork Summary 

12.1.1 DSO Testwork 

DSO testwork comprised apparent density ("AD") determinations, bond impact Wi, uniaxial 
compressive strength ("UCS"), head analysis of two metre composites, drop tower tests, batch 
scrubbing tests and bulk density determinations. 

A combined net mass of 5,068 kg of DSO material, comprising twelve drillholes taken from 
different locations across the known DSO resource, were shipped to SGS for this testwork 
programme. 

Only a single UCS measurement could be made due to the soft and friable nature of the DSO 
material. The material is therefore expected to be extremely easy to crush, resulting in low 
capital cost and power consumption for the DSO crushing circuit. Further confirmation of this 
was shown by the CWi measurements, the low values for which indicate the very soft nature 
of the material. CWi measurements averaged 2.25 kWh/t, with maximum and minimum values 
being 0.4 and 4.7 kWh/t respectively. 

Drop tower testing showed a reasonable quantity of lump product could be produced from the 
DSO. Average lump production was 46.5% and ranged from a minimum of 34% to a maximum 
of 61%. Further examination of the potential of a lump product from Nkout is suggested, and 
future work which will include thermal property characterisation is planned. Assay data 
showed that there is little or no upgrading of iron grade to the lump fraction and therefore the 
iron content of the lump and fines in expected to be very similar. 

Scrubbing of a whole of ore composite sample showed the potential to upgrade the DSO 
material from an average scrubber feed grade of 58.1% to 63.8% Fe, through screening of the 
scrubber product and rejection of the -0.5 mm material. However, Fe losses to the -150 micron 
fraction were extremely high, around 55%, and a requirement to process the fines in order to 
achieve acceptable iron recovery is recommended. 

Deleterious elements, particularly phosphorous, are quite high in the DSO and this may need 
to be addressed through scrubbing and fines treatment to produce a product of acceptable 
quality to potential customers. 

12.1.2 Scrubbing/Magnetic Separation Flowsheet 

Testwork has been undertaken on two composite samples from Nkout Centre, one "low 
alumina" and the other "high alumina". Both samples assayed approximately 53% Fe; the low 
alumina sample assayed approximately 1.5% Al2O3 and the high alumina sample assayed 
approximately 7.5% Al2O3. 

 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 70 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

The testwork conducted on these samples consisted of scrubbing of the samples once 
crushed to -6.3 mm, separation of the +1 mm fraction as a product fraction, followed by 
sequential processing of the -1 mm faction by LIMS, producing a second product fraction, 
followed by processing of the LIMS tailings by High Gradient Magnetic Separation ("HGMS") 
using a SLon separator, producing a third product fraction. 

The results available to date are reported below in Table 12-1.

While the low alumina sample achieved a combined product with a good Fe grade, the high 
alumina samples did not, due to the low Fe grade of the product from the scrubbing and 
screening stage. The silica grade of the product from the low alumina sample test was also 
somewhat higher than would be desirable, due to the high silica content of the HGMS product. 
However, this product was from the SLon test conducted at the highest magnetic field strength 
used (7000 G). While the test at a magnetic field strength of 5000 G yielded a similar result, 
the test conducted at a magnetic field strength of 2000 G resulted in a product with a silica 
grade of 6%. Using this as the SLon product would have resulted in an overall product silica 
grade of 4% at a slightly higher Fe grade (65.9%) albeit at a lower overall Fe recovery. The Fe 
recovery of the product as described in Table 12-1 above was 72%. 

The reason(s) behind the difference in performance between the two samples tested has not 
been explored as yet, although it is likely that the goethite content of the samples plays a key 
role in the recovery.  

Further testwork is recommended on the medium grade zone 120 material to assess potential 
process routes applicable. 

12.1.3 PFS Saprolite Testwork (Zone 120 and 130) 

Head assays of the composites used for the beneficiation testwork completed to date ranged 
from 39.8 to 42.3% Fe, 4 to 9% Al2O3 and 24 to 35% SiO2 and were somewhat higher in iron 
and alumina grade than the resource average for the Nkout saprolite. This should be taken 
into account when predicting mass and iron recovery from the beneficiation processes. That 
said, the updated Mineral Resource Statement reported herein has been produced to domain 
out the high clay zones within the saprolite and this should be taken into account in future 
programmes.  

Preliminary testwork carried out on saprolite (zone 120 and 130) material suggested that a 
sinter fines product could be produced through a gravity and magnetic scavenging flowsheet. 
More detailed PFS testwork carried out subsequently suggests a fines sinter product can be 
most efficiently produced through combination of low and high intensity magnetic separation 
processes.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

Saprolite testwork comprised UCS testing, impact crushing work index, JK dropweight testing, 
abrasion index, bond rod and ball mill work index, AD and beneficiation testwork using both 
gravitation and magnetic separation methods. 

A combined net mass of 11,227 kg of Nkout saprolite material, made up from seventeen 
drillholes taken primarily across the known Nkout Centre saprolite resource, were shipped to 
SGS for this testwork program. For the UCS and CWi determinations, material from an 
individual drillhole was tested. For all other testwork, three composites were formed, from 
Nkout West, Nkout Centre and Nkout East. 

The saprolite samples were observed to be very soft and friable and this limited the amount of 
suitable samples for UCS testing that could be found. Only three measurements could be 
made, with an average value of 12.4 MPa. The soft nature of the saprolite was confirmed by 
the CWi determinations. The average CWi was only 2.4 kWh/t, with maximum and minimum 
values being 6.52 and 0.55 kWh/t, respectively. Crushing of saprolite is expected to be 
relatively easy with a low power requirement indicated. 

JK dropweight testing and computer simulation suggested that the use of SAG milling is not 
applicable, due to the soft nature of the material and relatively high clay content of the 
samples tested. Conventional multi-stage crushing followed by ball milling is expected to be 
the most suitable comminution circuit. In this regard, the Abrasion Index measurements were 
all low, ranging from 0.06 to 0.13, and this suggests relatively low crushing liner and ball mill 
media consumption when processing saprolite ores. 

Bond rod and ball mill work index measurements suggest that as the saprolite particles 
become smaller, the comminution energy increases significantly. The rod mill work index 
ranged from 6.1 to 7.6 kWh/t, values of near average hardness; whereas the ball mill work 
indexes were in the very hard range at between 17.3 and 17.9kWh/t. Milling energy is likely to 
be high and will be a significant element of overall operating costs. The importance of 
minimising energy consumption through maximisation of beneficiation particle size is noted. 

Davis Tube Wash ("DTW") testwork on the composite samples taken over a range of particle 
size p80 from 25 to 500 microns showed that quite significant quantity of iron can be 
concentrated utilising low intensity magnetic separation. Very high grade concentrate was 
achieved at particle sizes at or finer than 150 microns with iron grades in excess of 68%. Fe 
recovery progressively drops with finer particle sizes due to liberation of haematite from 
magnetite, ranging from around 51% at a grind size of 500 microns to only 15.7% at 
38 microns. Pilot scale LIMS testwork at grind sizes of 250, 180 and 150 microns confirmed 
the DTW results, with average iron recovery of 35% being achieved at a grind size of 250 
microns with concentrate grading 67.4% Fe and 2.4% SiO2 and very low deleterious elements. 

Gravity separation testwork using a Wilfley shaking table showed that a final grade 
concentrate could be produced, but that iron recovery was low. At a grind size of 250 microns, 
average concentrate grade was 68.6% Fe, but Fe recovery was low averaging only 32.5%. 
Attempts were made to improve Fe recovery through the addition of a cleaner stage to retreat 
the middlings material from the first stage of tabling, overall concentrate grade dropped slightly 
to 66% Fe, but Fe recovery did increase to an average of 72%.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

Further testwork was undertaken to examine the Fe recovery from the LIMS tailings through 
use of a SLon high intensity magnetic separator. SLon iron recovery averaged 63.7% at a 
concentrate grade of 61.5%. The combined LIMS and Circuit recovery averaged 75.3% at a 
concentrate grade of 64% Fe, 5.4% SiO2 and 1.1% Al2O3. 

Mineralogical work indicated that major Fe losses from the LIMS/SLon circuit were due to the 
presence of non-magnetic geothite. Geometallurgical logging of the oxide zones is 
recommended as part of the PFS work programme to assist in recovery predictions from the 
resource model. 

Further testwork is planned aimed at improving both concentrate grade and recovery from the 
LIMS/SLon circuit through testing coarser feed to the LIMS, regrinding of LIMS tails ahead of 
the SLon as well as Scavenger and Cleaner SLon stages.   

12.1.4 PFS Magnetite BIF Testwork 

Preliminary Davis Tube Recovery ("DTR") testwork carried out on magnetite BIF (zone 210) 
material suggested that a high grade sinter fines product could be produced through simple 
LIMS beneficiation at a grind size of 75 microns. More detailed PFS testwork carried out 
subsequently now suggests that a saleable grade fines sinter product can be most efficiently 
produced at much coarser grind sizes, which would have the potential to significantly reduce 
operating costs. 

BIF testwork comprised UCS testing, impact crushing work index, JK dropweight testing, 
abrasion index, bond rod and ball mill work index, AD and beneficiation testwork using LIMS. 

A combined net mass of 11,915 kg of BIF material, made up from twenty drillholes taken 
primarily across the known Nkout Centre BIF resource, were shipped to SGS for this testwork 
programme. Five of these holes were selected to provide good geographical spread across 
the deposit as well as significant "across mineralisation" core length for the testwork program. 
It is planned to use material from the remaining holes for future process optimisation and 
variability testing.  

The BIF samples were observed to be very hard and competent which allowed for a full range 
of UCS testing to be undertaken. The average UCS was a moderately high value of 68 MPa 
with maximum and minimum values at 123.6 and 21.4 MPa respectively. The very hard nature 
of the BIF was confirmed by the CWi determinations. The average CWi was a high 15.2 kWh/t, 
with maximum and minimum values being 21.8 and 10.2 kWh/t respectively. Crushing of BIF 
is expected to require a high power consumption and a high crushing circuit capital cost. 

JK dropweight testing and comminution circuit computer simulation suggests that the use of 
SAG milling is applicable. 

Bond rod and ball mill work index measurements suggest that the BIF particles are extremely 
competent in the finer size ranges. The rod mill work index average a high of 10.5  kWh/t, 
whereas the ball mill work indexes range between 15.5 and 18.2  kWh/t. Milling energy is likely 
to be very high and will be a significant element of overall operating costs. The importance of 
minimising energy consumption through maximisation of beneficiation particle size is 
paramount.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

Head assays of the composites used for the beneficiation testwork ranged from 25.3 and 
33.9% Fe and were at or somewhat below the resource average for the BIF. 

Davis Tube Wash ("DTW") testwork on the composite samples taken over a range of particle 
size p80 from 38 to 500 microns showed that reasonable Fe recovery and good concentrate 
grade can be concentrated utilising low intensity magnetic separation. Acceptable grade 
concentrate was achieved at particle sizes at or finer than 150 microns with Fe grades 
averaging around 64.3% at Fe recovery averaging 78.6%. Quite large variability in 
performance was noted between drillhole composite samples and this is planned to be 
investigated further in future testwork programs.  

Pilot scale LIMS testwork suggested that a somewhat finer grind of between 106 microns and 
125 microns was required to produce similar results to that achieved by the DTW testwork. At 
a particle size p80 of 125 microns, average Fe recovery was 76.9% with a concentrate grade 
of 64.9% Fe, 8.5% SiO2 and low level of alumina and phosphorous averaging only 0.6% and 
0.014% respectively. 

Mineralogical studies indicated that major iron losses to the LIMS tailings were due to the 
presence of non-magnetic haematite and Fe silicates. 

Further testwork is planned and is aimed at better understanding of the variability of response 
with depth and across Nkout.

13 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

13.1 Deposit modelling 

The following section describes the methodology undertaken for modelling of the Project.  

13.1.1 Geological Zones 

Geological zones were created by grouping together zones of the dominant logged lithology 
and grade continuity. The dominant lithology is most typically logged over an approximate 2 m 
interval (Table 13-1). 

Figure 13-1 shows an example of the drillhole file coloured by the dominant lithology for Nkout. 
The red trace indicates where BIF is dominant; light grey is metasediment or country rock 
dominant. An alternating sequence of metasediment and BIF is shown, whereby the 
metasediment intersects both oxidised and fresh material.

13.1.2 Geological Zones – Oxidised BIF 

The geological domaining of the oxidised BIF was based on mineralisation boundaries 
identified through a statistical analysis of the drillhole database. The weathering profile 
observed at Nkout is transitional from highly altered and enriched material near surface and 
gradational down to the primary unaltered BIF at depth. Three principal mineralisation zones 
have been developed within the oxidised BIF; these are shown below with comments 
comparing the MRE 4 domaining to the domaining guidelines used in this updated Mineral 
Resource Estimate: 

• >60% Fe; (previously >55% Fe) 

• 45% to 60% Fe; and (previously 50 to 55% Fe) 

• base of BIF oxidation to 45% Fe (previously base of BIF oxidation to 50%). 

The updated zone guidelines were as a result of the increased volume of assay data within the 
oxidised cap at Nkout. 

The zones created are primarily based on the Fe distribution and follow the natural enrichment 
process down the sequence. The supergene enrichment process results in the progressive 
dissolution of SiO2 that decreases with depth. As such, the general observed trend shows an 
increase in Fe grade moving up the sequence away from the base of oxidation which is 
accompanied by a decrease in the SiO2 content. The oxidation process results in the 
conversion of magnetite (Fe3O4) to haematite (Fe2O3).  

Table 13-1 shows the zone codes developed for the oxidised material at Nkout. Where 
relevant, the same zone codes have been applied to Nkout Centre, Nkout East, Nkout West 
and D8. 

Elevated Al2O3 zones (zone 150) have been domained within the oxidised BIF and a single 
pod of elevated P material (zone 160) has been domained at Nkout Centre.

13.1.4 Block Model Creation 

An empty block model was generated using the solid wireframes created with the ground 
survey / SRTM topography being used to limit block model extents. Figure 13-2 shows the 
empty block model created for the Project. The resource estimate model includes the oxidised 
zones lying above the primary BIF. In total, the mineralisation modelled has a strike length of 
some 12 km.  A waste model was also generated below the topography and outside of the 
mineralisation zones. 

After completion of the geological domaining and wireframe generation, the drillhole file was 
coded to incorporate the corresponding zones. This enabled a statistical analysis of each zone 
to be undertaken.  

 

Figure 13-2: Plan View of Nkout Empty Block Model and Drillholes. Minor grid 
50x50m (Source: SRK, May 2013) 

   The mineralisation modelled has a strike length of approximately 12 km 

The Nkout deposit is approximately 12 km in length and up to 500 m in true thickness. The BIF 
unit dips at approximately 60° to the north. Internal metasedimentary waste zones (zone 140) 
have been interpreted at Nkout Centre, Nkout East and Nkout West. These have been limited 
to a minimum thickness of 5 m and are up to 80 m in thickness. Zone 150, containing elevated 
Al2O3 material within the oxidised BIF package, has also interpreted and modelled within 
Nkout Centre and Nkout East. 

The total volume of the BIF and oxidised wireframes equals 1,325.73 Mm3 and the total 
volume of the internal waste zones equals 39.23 Mm3. Deep drilling has proved the 
continuation of magnetite mineralisation to a depth of 820 m. 

Figure 13-3 shows the empty block model and drillhole file coloured by zone.

13.2 Statistical Analysis 

13.2.1 Introduction 

This section presents the results of the statistical studies undertaken on all the available assay 
and density data sets to determine their suitability for the estimation process and to derive 
appropriate estimation zones. 

13.2.2 Available Data 

The samples analysed typically comprise an approximate 2 m sample interval. A total of 
16,486 raw assays are available for use in the modelling and Mineral Resource Estimation 
process.  

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 79 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

13.2.3 Data Validation 

All available data has been validated through the production of histograms and scatterplots. All 
data was validated on-site by an SRK geologist. 

13.2.4 Raw Statistics 

The zone coding described above groups together similar zones principally on the Fe content. 
Table 13-2 shows the Fe statistics for the main zones at Nkout. Zones 110, 120, 130, 140 and 
160 represent the oxidised BIF zones. Zone 210 is the principal magnetite BIF zone across 
the Project and accounts for approximately 89% of the entire resource.  

Table 13-2: Nkout raw statistics by zone code  
ZONE FIELD MEAN (%) 

110 (>60% Fe) Fe 61.97 

120 (45 to 60% Fe) Fe 51.78 

130 (base of oxidation to 45% Fe) Fe 38.53 

140 (Oxidised Metasediments) Fe 19.58 

150 (elevated Al2O3) Fe / Al2O3 24.24 / 11.50 

160 (elevated P) Fe / P 52.41 / 1.51 

210 (Fresh BIF) Fe 31.52 

240 (Fresh Metasediments) Fe 9.35 

 

13.2.5 Compositing 

Data compositing is undertaken to reduce the inherent variability that exists within the 
population and to generate samples more appropriate to the scale of the mining operation 
envisaged. It is also necessary for the estimation process, as all samples are assumed to be 
of equal weighting, and should therefore be of equal length. 

It is common practice to select a composite length that is half of the block height (10 m blocks 
in this instance, so 5 m composites), being designed around the anticipated bench height.  

13.2.6 Composite Length Analysis 

The estimation process assumes an equivalent weighting per composite. It is therefore 
necessary to discard or ignore remnant composites that are generated in the downhole 
compositing process to avoid a bias in the estimation. Based on the results of a composite 
length analysis, a 3 m cut off was determined. The analysis shows that discarding lengths of 
<3 m had the least effect on the statistical mean of the key element fields. It was therefore 
decided to remove all samples from the 5 m composite file with a length <3 m. 

13.2.7 Composite Zone Statistics – Magnetite BIF 

Table 13-3 illustrates the composite zone statistics for Fe, Al2O3, SiO2 and P within the fresh 
BIF and internal metasediments at Nkout. The mineralised BIF zone 210, shows a mean value 
of 31.53% Fe.  

Figure 13-6 shows the Fe histogram plot for the fresh BIF zone at the Project.  

 
U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 

Page 80 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE- Main Report  
 

The Fe histogram for zone 210 shows a negative skew in the distribution owing in part to 
narrow internal bands of predominantly metasediment material that could not be domained out 
in the geological modelling. It is also evident that two populations of data exist around a grade 
of approximately 35% Fe. This is also highlighted in a probability plot of Fe within zone 210 
and shown in Figure 13-7. 

SRK considered the domaining of two separate Fe based populations based on the statistical 
review. However, it was determined that the estimation process was adequate in highlighting 
the different grade distributions observed and that the introduction of a hard boundary 
between the two grade zones may not be appropriate in this instance.

13.2.8 Zone Statistics – Oxidised Cap 

Table 13-4 shows the Fe, Al2O3, SiO2 and P oxidised cap zone statistics for Nkout. As shown, 
the Fe grade is seen decreasing down the weathered sequence with zone 110 being the 
highest grade and zone 130 being the lowest grade and closest to the magnetite BIF grade. 
SiO2 increases down the profile approaching the magnetite BIF grade within zone 130. The 
grade profile is a result of the progressive decrease in the dissolution of silica down the profile. 
Zones 140 and 150 shows an elevated Al2O3 grade, which is a typical characteristic of the 
dominant metasediment and other internal waste. Zone 160, being a high P zone, has a mean 
Fe grade of 52.33% with an associated P grade of 1.5%. SRK inspected the drill core for the 
zone 160 material and could find no clear reason for the elevated P material. It is, however, 
considered real, as the zone 160 pod occurs across numerous drillholes drilled in different 
programmes from a single location and is therefore not an effect of laboratory error.  

Figure 13-8 to Figure 13-10 show the Fe histogram plots for zones 110, 120 and 130 within 
the Nkout oxidised cap. Some 285 composite samples exist in zone 110, 780 in zone 120 and 
978 in zone 130. These all indicate a near normal distribution with a slight negatively skewed 
tail due to inclusions of low grade material that could not be domained out.

Figure 13-11 shows the relationship between Fe grade and density for samples within the 
fresh BIF zone. A strong correlation is shown and therefore a trend line can be fitted to the 
data distribution. The regression formula derived from the trend line is used to calculate bulk 
density in the geological model. Figure 13-12  to Figure 13-14 show the regression lines for 
the oxidised zones.  

Table 13-5 shows the average density values determined for each material type.

13.3 Geostatistical study 

13.3.1 Introduction 

For the geostatistical study, all samples within oxidised zones 110 and 120 were combined in 
to a single zone on which to undertake the geostatistical study and zones 130 and 210 were 
treated as independent zones on which to undertake the geostatistical study. Combining 
zones 110 and 120 improved the variography due to limited samples present within the 
individual zones. Within zone 130 and in the primary underlying BIF, sufficient data sets are 
available for independent studies. 

The drillhole database, flagged by modelled zone, was imported into the Snowden Supervisor 
software for the geostatistical analysis. Variography was successfully undertaken for the 
combined 110 and 120 zone and the 130 and 210 zone.

For the 130 and 210 zones, directional experimental semi-variograms were produced for Fe, 
Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, LOI, MgO, Mn, P, S, TiO2 and Satmagan. The semi-variograms were 
produced using a 5 m lag in the downhole direction to allow the nugget to be determined. 
Semi-variograms to define the directional ranges were produced using a 100 m lag and the 
nugget was fixed using the downhole variogram. The nugget value obtained from the Fe 
variogram (in terms of percentage of the sill) was applied to fix the nugget for all other 
variograms. 

For the combined zones 110 / 120, omnidirectional experimental semi-variograms were 
produced for Fe, Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, LOI, MgO, Mn, P, S, TiO2 and Satmagan. The semi-
variograms were produced using a 5 m lag to determine the nugget  and the ranges were 
produced using a 100 m lag. The nugget value obtained from the Fe variogram (in terms of 
percentage of the sill) was applied to fix the nugget for all other variograms. 

Figure 13-15 to Figure 13-19 show the modelled variograms produced for the combined zones 
and the 130 and 210 zones.  The number of sample pairs was checked in the variography 
process to ensure sufficient numbers were being used. 

All variograms show reasonable structure, allowing reliable variogram models to be produced. 
The nugget and ranges are easily generated, providing an appropriate level of confidence in 
terms of both the short scale and longer range grade continuity.  

Similar variogram models were produced for all other assays, although some of the minor 
elements were harder to model.  

The results of the variography are shown in Table 13-6. All variograms are shown with the 
total variance rescaled to 1.

13.3.2 Summary 

The variogram models produced allowed the generation of suitably reliable interpolation 
parameters. 

The results of the variography are used in the interpolation to assign the appropriate 
weighting to the sample pairs utilised to calculate the block model grade.  

The total ranges modelled are also incorporated to help define the optimum search 
parameters and the search ellipse radii dimensions used in the interpolation. Ideally, sample 
pairs that fall within the range of the variogram (where a strong covariance exists between the 
sample pairs) should be utilised if the data allows.  

For the Mineral Resource Estimate, the range from the Fe variogram is utilised for all 
variables given that it represents the largest range for the principal variables, and thus 
allowing the grade interpolation process to be informed by the maximum amount of data.   

Applying a 2/3rd rule to the total range of the variogram in the search ellipse radii dimensions 
forces the interpolation to use samples where covariance between samples exists. Table 13-7 
shows the Fe range with a 2/3rd rule applied. The results of variography suggest that Ordinary 
Kriging ("OK") is an appropriate interpolation technique. 

Table 13-7: Fe range by zone with the 2/3rd rule applied

140/ 210/ 240 420 250 70 

 

13.3.3 Quantitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (QKNA) 

QKNA Process 

To better define the ideal search parameters used in the interpolation, Quantitative Kriging 
Neighbourhood Analysis ("QKNA") was also undertaken on the data. 

QKNA, as presented by Vann et al (2003), is used to refine the search parameters in the 
interpolation process to help ensure 'conditional unbiasedness' in the resulting estimates. 
'Conditional unbiasedness' is defined by David (1977) as "…on average, all blocks Z which 
are estimated to have a grade equal to Zo will have that grade". The criteria considered when 
evaluating a search area through QKNA, in order of priority, are (Vann et al 2003): 

• the slope of regression of the 'true' block grade on the 'estimated' block grade; 
• the weight of the mean for a simple kriging; 
• the distribution of kriging weights, and proportion of negative weights; and 
• the kriging variance. 

 
 
 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 93 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE – Main Report 
 

Under the assumption that the variogram is valid, and the regression is linear, the regression 
between the 'true' and 'estimated' blocks can be calculated. The actual scatter plot can never 
be demonstrated, as the 'true' grades are never known, but the covariance between 'true' and 
'estimated' blocks can be calculated. The slope of regression should be as close to one as 
possible, implying conditional unbiasedness. If the slope of regression equals one, the 
estimated block grade will approximately equate to the unknown 'true' block grades (Vann et 
al 2003). 

During OK, the sum of the kriging weights is equal to one. When Simple Kriging ("SK") is 
used, the sum of kriging weights is not constrained to add up to one, with the remaining 
kriging weight being allocated to the mean grade of the input data.  Therefore, not only the 
data within the search area is used to krige the block grade, but the mean grade of the input 
data also influences the final block grade. The kriging weight assigned to the input data mean 
grade is termed "the weight of the mean". The weight of the mean of a SK is a good indication 
of the search area as it shows the influence of the Screen Effect. A sample is 'screened' if 
another sample lies between it and the point being estimated, causing the weight of the 
screened sample to be reduced. The Screen Effect is stronger when there are high levels of 
continuity denoted by the variogram. A high nugget effect (low continuity) will allow weights to 
be spread far from a block in order to reduce bias (Vann et al 2003). 

The weight of the mean for an SK demonstrates the strength of the Screen Effect the larger 
the weight of the mean, the weaker the Screen Effect will be. The general rule is that the 
weight of the mean should be as close to zero as possible.  QKNA is a balancing act between 
maximising the slope of regression, and minimising the weight of the mean for a SK (Vann et 
al 2003). The margins of an optimised search will contain samples with very small or slightly 
negative weights. Visual checks of the search area should be made in order to verify this. The 
proportion of negative weights in the search area should be less than 5% (Vann et al 2003). 

QKNA provides a useful technique that uses mathematically sound tools to optimise a search 
area. It is an invaluable step in determining the correct search area for any estimation or 
simulation exercise.   

13.3.4 Interpolation Parameters 

Multiple neighbourhood scenarios were run on the zones (search distances, number of 
samples, etc.) with the scenarios being tested by running the estimation in Datamine Studio 3 
software on the specific zones modelled. All zones used a search ellipse generated from the 
results of the variography. The number of blocks filled in the neighbourhood run was checked 
to ensure that an adequate number of blocks were filled ensuring that meaningful results were 
generated. 

The QKNA process was run to generate the slope of regression results using the chosen 
search parameters.  

Table 13-8 shows the final search ellipse dimensions and sample numbers used for the first 
pass interpolation, that were selected based on the QKNA studies. Traditional dips and dip 
directions of the ellipse are not shown due to the use of dynamic anisotropy in the 
interpolation (Section: 13.4.2).

Figure 13-20 shows the probability plot of the slope of regression results within the 
mineralised fresh BIF. As shown, a proportion of the estimated blocks show a slope of 
regression value in excess of 0.95 with a gradual decrease in slope to approximately 0.5. 
These areas above 0.5 represent areas of the estimated block model where the data is of a 
sufficient spacing to provide a high level of confidence in the quality of the estimation results 
due to the blocks being well informed with available data.

Figure 13-21 illustrates the slope of regression values coloured by the splits identified in the 
probability plot in Figure 13-20 and in relation to the drillholes, whereby high slope of 
regression values are evident in areas of well informed data. As the estimated blocks become 
more distant from the available sample data, the slope of regression values are seen to 
decrease. This is due to the lack of sample support available to the block.

13.4 Resource Estimation 

13.4.1 Interpolation 

A single block model was created using block sizes of 50 mY by 50 mX by 10 mZ.  

The BIF unit was extrapolated to the zero RL, being approximately 800 m below the 
topography RL. This was undertaken to test the down dip potential of the deposit through the 
optimisation process. 

Table 13-9 summarises the block model parameters.

X 245000 X 280 X 50 

Y 284000 Y 100 Y 50 

Z -500 Z 200 Z 10 
 

Grades of Fe, Al2O3, CaO, LOI, MgO, Mn, P, S, SiO2, TiO2, FeO and Satmagan were 
interpolated into the model using OK and interpolation parameters as given in Table 13-8. All 
geological zones, including the waste metasediment zones were interpolated in this manner. 

13.4.2 Search Ellipse Parameters and Dynamic Anisotropy 

The search ellipse parameters were determined through the QKNA tests undertaken. The dip 
and rotation of the ellipse mirrors the overall dip and strike of the individual zones. That said, 
in order to provide a continuous estimation and honour the geological structure and gentle 
along strike changes in strike orientation observed, it was decided to use dynamic anisotropy 
in the estimation process. Dynamic anisotropy uses angle data generated from the 
mineralisation wireframe to assign dip and dip direction to every block in the model. The 
search ellipse is rotated upon estimation of the block by honouring the associated dip and dip 
direction of that block. 

Three estimation runs have been undertaken. The first pass used the parameters determined 
through the QKNA testwork. The second run doubled the search ellipse and decreased the 
number of samples required for all zones. The final run multiplied the first pass search by 10 
and reduced the minimum number of samples required. The final pass was designed to 
estimate any blocks not estimated in the first two passes.  

Prior to the interpolation, the ellipse was in each case validated in Datamine Studio 3 to 
ensure that the correct dip, dip direction and search radii were applied. The search ellipses 
applied to the BIF, oxide and metasediment units for each zone are shown in Figure 13-22.

Table 13-10 shows the number of blocks filled during each estimation pass for all mineralised 
zones. As shown, a high percentage of blocks in all zones have been estimated in run one, 
this being the estimate based on the most appropriate set of estimation parameters and in line 
with the results of the geostatistical studies undertaken.

13.4.3 Block Model Validation 

The block model has been validated using the following techniques: 

• visual inspection of block grades in plan and section and comparison with drill hole 
grades; and 

• comparison of global mean block grades and sample grades within mineralised zones. 

Visual Validation 

Figure 13-23 to Figure 13-24 show examples of the visual validation checks and highlight the 
correspondence between the block Fe grades and the sample Fe grades. The grades can 
also be seen to follow the orientation of the search ellipse. In addition, the two grade zones 
identified in the statistical analysis of the magnetite BIF material can be observed where the 
light green material in the BIF represents material greater than 35% Fe, corresponding with 
the drillhole samples.

Global mean grade comparison 

The global block means have been compared with the sample means for Fe, SiO2, Al2O3, P, 
Mn, CaO, MgO, TiO2, FeO, Satmagan and LOI. See Table 13-11 for the key results from the 
zones.  

Whilst there are some discrepancies in percentage terms, these all relate to cases where the 
values themselves are low. Certainly, the absolute differences in the fresh BIF zone (210) are 
very low and, overall, SRK is confident that the interpolated grades are a reasonable 
reflection of the available sample data.

13.5 Mineral Resource Classification 

The definitions given in the following section are taken from the 2000 Canadian Institute of 
Mining Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions' guidelines on Mineral Resources and 
Reserves, to comply with NI 43-101. 

13.5.1 CIM Definitions 

Mineral Resource 

Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, 
Indicated and Measured categories. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of 
confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource. An Indicated Mineral 
Resource has a higher level of confidence than an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a lower 
level of confidence than a Measured Mineral Resource. 

 

 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE – Main Report 
 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilised 
organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. 

The term Mineral Resource covers mineralisation and natural material of intrinsic economic 
interest which has been identified and estimated through exploration and sampling and within 
which Mineral Reserves may subsequently be defined by the consideration and application of 
technical, economic, legal, environmental, socio-economic and governmental factors. The 
phrase 'reasonable prospects for economic extraction' implies a judgement by the Qualified 
Person in respect of the technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of 
economic extraction. A Mineral Resource is an inventory of mineralisation that, under 
realistically assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, might become 
economically extractable. These assumptions must be presented explicitly in both public and 
technical reports. 

Inferred Mineral Resource 

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade 
or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and 
reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based 
on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations 
such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. 

Due to the uncertainty which may attach to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed 
that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an Indicated or 
Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration. Confidence in the estimate 
is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical and economic parameters or to 
enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public disclosure. Inferred Mineral 
Resources must be excluded from estimates forming the basis of feasibility or other economic 
studies. 

Indicated Mineral Resource 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of 
confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic 
parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 
The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered 
through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drillholes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably 
assumed. 

Mineralisation may be classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person 
when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such as to allow confident 
interpretation of the geological framework and to reasonably assume the continuity of 
mineralisation. The Qualified Person must recognise the importance of the Indicated Mineral 
Resource category to the advancement of the feasibility of the project. An Indicated Mineral 
Resource estimate is of sufficient quality to support a PFS which can serve as the basis for 
major development decisions.

Measured Mineral Resource 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability 
of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and 
testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both 
geological and grade continuity. 

Mineralisation or other natural material of economic interest may be classified as a Measured 
Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution 
of data are such that the tonnage and grade of the mineralisation can be estimated to within 
close limits and that variation from the estimate would not significantly affect potential 
economic viability. This category requires a high level of confidence in, and understanding of, 
the geology and controls of the mineral deposit. 

13.6 Nkout Classification 

13.6.1 Introduction 

To classify the deposits at Nkout, the following key indicators were used: 

• geological complexity; 

• quality of the data used in the estimation:  

o QA/QC data; 
o results of the geostatistical analysis, namely the variography and QKNA results; 

and  
• quality of the estimated block model.  

13.6.2 Geological Complexity 

Nkout is modelled as numerous bodies of magnetite BIF that are coincident with a regional 
magnetic anomaly. Nkout Centre is composed of four lenses of magnetite BIF, although the 
majority of the material falls within a single unit. Nkout East is composed of two smaller 
lenses, and Nkout West comprises of four lenses. Drilling at Nkout West is limited at present, 
thus reducing the confidence in the modelling of each specific unit. In addition, greater 
structural complexity has been interpreted in the western end of Nkout Centre which may 
require more detailed drilling to better define and correlate the model in this area (as 
discussed in Section 6.4 Nkout Deposit Structure). 

The northerly dip of the BIF has been disturbed by a number of broadly north-south trending 
shear zones. The shear structures are not clearly flagged in the geology logs, and thus not 
reflected in detail in the model. However the truncation of mineralisation within the modelled 
unit is concurrent with the interpreted regional cross cutting structures and evident from the 
magnetic anomaly for the project area. 

 

 

U5499 Nkout MRE May 2013.docx May, 2013 
Page 103 of 123 



SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE – Main Report 
 

The deposits have been domained by a combination of grade and lithological characteristics. 
At depth, the zones are defined as fresh BIF and interbedded (dominantly) metasedimentary 
units, which co-exist in a variably continuous sequence that covers a 3.1 km strike distance at 
Nkout Centre, a 2.2 km strike distance at Nkout East, 2.9 km strike distance at Nkout West 
and 1.2 km strike at D8 with distinct breaks in continuity between. 

The overlying oxidised zones consist of a transitional grade profile with high Fe, low SiO2 
material at the surface, grading down to typical magnetite BIF material close to the base of 
the oxidation.   

Continuity of the grade in the fresh BIF zone appears relatively high, although two populations 
of data have been identified although not discreetly modelled at present. 

Grade variability is inherently more complex in the oxidised zones. Due to the closer spaced 
drilling undertaken on section lines, continuous and or poddy zones have been modelled. 

Overall, it appears that that the zones identified at Nkout are of a reasonably low geological 
complexity and the BIF hanging wall and footwall contacts are easily defined. However, the 
complexities in the geology arise in the internal metasediments and the areas around the 
bounding fault zone to the west of Nkout Centre. As such, and based on the current level of 
data supporting the geological model, the associated risk relating to the geological 
continuation is considered at a low to medium level.  

It is recognised that the oxidised zones are more variable than the fresh BIF zones, however 
the increased drill density for this material has mitigated this risk to a certain extent. 

It is also noted that the zones may be more affected by faulting than currently considered, 
however this can only be proven through further data collection and a detailed structural 
interpretation that is beyond the scope of the current study. 

13.6.3 Quality of the data used in the estimation 

Afferro has conducted what is considered to be industry best practice in relation to the QA/QC 
checks and has developed a systematic process of sample preparation at the facilities on site 
and the ALS preparation laboratory at Yaoundé, with a regular system of standards, 
duplicates and blanks being inserted into the sample stream. This is also being monitored and 
co-managed by the onsite SRK resource geologist. 

Validation checks of standards are broadly within acceptable reporting limits and duplicate 
field samples show a strong correlation to the original sample. Blank samples were reported 
as showing a low iron content, however it is suggested that this relates to the sample origin 
(Yaoundé river sand - which may have a residual iron content), rather than from 
contamination.  

Core recovery in the fresh zone is very high although this is seen to drop below 80% within 
the oxidised zones.

13.6.4 Results of the geostatistical analysis 

The data used in the geostatistical analysis resulted in suitably reliable downhole variograms 
for all zones that allowed the nugget variance to be fixed with robust directional variograms 
being developed in the combined zones 130 / 210 and omnidirectional variograms being 
developed in the zoones 110 / 120. The variography allowed the determination of reasonable 
search distances to be tested in the QKNA process.  

The QKNA was undertaken in Datamine software with the slope of regression showing well 
supported blocks in areas drilled on the dominant drill spacing. The slope of regression values 
are clearly seen tailing off at depth where sample support reduces. 

13.6.5 Quality of the estimated block model 

The validation tools utilised for the Project show that the input data used to estimate the 
model is replicated in the estimation. The block model grades are smoothed around the input 
composites and the mean grades of the block model and composites are comparable for all 
modelled zones. 

13.6.6 Classification 

The Project has been classified as containing Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources in the 
fresh BIF and the oxidised zones. The Indicated Mineral Resources have been limited to the 
broad area as designated by a solid wireframe that estimated in run one of the estimation and 
with a slope of regression value greater than approximately 0.7. In the fresh BIF, Inferred 
Mineral Resources have been extrapolated no more than 100 m down dip of the deepest 
drillhole intersection. It is the opinion of SRK that the down dip extension of Inferred Mineral 
Resources is justified in areas of unsupported blocks due to the known down dip extensions 
as observed through the deep drilling that has intersected magnetite BIF up to 820 m from 
surface. 

Figure 13-25 shows an example of the classified model with Figure 13-26 showing the full 
classified model in terms of fresh BIF and oxidised zones.

To determine the final Mineral Resource Statement, in compliance with NI 43-101, the 
resulting blocks have been subjected to a Whittle pit optimisation exercise to determine the 
proportion of the material defined that has a reasonable prospect of economic extraction. This 
exercise is not intended to generate a Mineral Reserve and is purely used to assist in 
determining the possible down dip extent of the Mineral Resource. 

13.7 Whittle Parameters 

The Whittle optimisation requires the input of reasonable processing and mining cost 
parameters in addition to appropriate pit slope angles and processing recoveries. These are 
described in the following sections.  

13.7.1 Optimisation Scenarios 

Several optimisation scenarios were analysed as part of this work, including: 

• a base case optimisation (Fe = USD1.4/dmtu, Indicated and Inferred material only, 
three process streams); 

• an all-in case which included unclassified material; 

• a range of sensitivities for Fe price from USD0.4/dmtu to USD2.8/dmtu.

13.7.2 Geotechnical Parameters 

Geotechnical parameters were not provided, however the deposit has been divided into 
geotechnical zones and each block has been assigned a GZONE code.  These codes are: 

• GZONE 1 = oxidised waste; 

• GZONE 2 = waste model (generic fresh waste); 

• GZONE 3 = oxidised material within the geological model; 

• GZONE 4 = fresh material within the geological model; 

• GZONES 1 and 3 have been grouped together and assigned a slope of 16º; and 

• GZONES 2 and 4 have been similarly grouped together and assigned a slope of 41º. 

Whittle maintains a default geotechnical zone (GZONE=0) to cover any blocks which may not 
have a GZONE code applied to them.  This GZONE has also been assigned a slope of 41º. 

13.7.3 Mining Parameters 

The following mining parameters were used in the optimisation. 

• Base Mining Cost (at reference RL):  USD1.60/t mined 

• Reference Block (RFBK):    80 mRL (80 x 10m blocks from the 
base of the model) 

• Incremental mining cost above RFBK:  USD0.05/t/10 m 

• Incremental mining cost below RFBK:  USD0.05/t/10 m 

• Mining Recovery:     97.5% 

• Mining Dilution:     2.5% 

13.7.4 Processing Parameters 

Three processing streams were assumed, these being the BIF, lower grade oxidised material 
and the potential DSO material. 

Recoveries and mass yield have been determined from the metallurgical testwork.  

Transport costs are assumed to be constant for all three process streams, as it is assumed 
that the same transport mechanism and infrastructure will be used (standard gauge rail).  The 
base data for this has been extracted from a benchmark project.  40% of the cost (reflecting 
the rail component) has then been factored to account for the increased transport distance.  
The port component of the transport cost has not been modified. 

General and administration costs have been based on the benchmark project and applied 
evenly to all process streams.

13.7.5 Economic Parameters 

The following economic parameters were used in the optimisation:   

• Fe Price: USD1.4/dmtu; 

• Royalty: 2.5%. 

13.8 Mineral Resource Statement 

The Mineral Resource Statement generated by SRK has been restricted to all classified 
material falling within the Whittle pit shell representing a metal price of USD1.4/dmtu for 
magnetite and sinter fines concentrate and through the application of the parameters outlined 
in 13.7. This represents the material which SRK considers has reasonable prospect for 
eventual economic extraction potential based on the above Whittle pit optimisation analysis. 
Table 13-12 shows the resulting Mineral Resource Statement for Nkout.   

The statement has been classified by a Qualified Person, Howard Baker (MAusIMM(CP)) in 
accordance with the Guidelines of NI 43-101 and accompanying documents 43-101.F1 and 
43-101.CP. It has an effective date of 28 May 2013. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral 
Reserves have no demonstrated economic viability. SRK and Afferro are not aware of any 
factors (environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, or 
other relevant factors) that have materially affected the Mineral Resource Estimate. The 
Nkout deposit is a greenfield site and therefore is not affected by any mining, metallurgical or 
infrastructure factors. 

The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are 
uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Mineral 
Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource; and it is uncertain if further 
exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource 
category.

13.11 Resource Potential 

SRK recognises that there is potential to increase the Mineral Resource Statement through 
deep drilling that targets material that falls within a Whittle pit shell generated when including 
the unclassified material and the assumptions listed in section 13.7. This material, shown in 
Figure 13-31 and based on a metal price of USD1.4/dmtu is considered by SRK to be 
potentially economic, should sufficient exploration data be collected that confirms the 
geometry and continuation of the mineralisation and that enables a classified resource to be 
generated. SRK has identified that an additional 500 to 1,000 Mt lies below the Whittle pit 
shell used for constraining the classified Resources. The potential quantity of tonnes is 
conceptual in nature as there has been insufficient exploration in these areas. It is uncertain if 
further exploration will result in these targets being delineated as a Mineral Resource. These 
potential tonnages reflect a range of material within SRK's solid models outlining the 
interpreted down dip extent of mineralisation. 

SRK recognises the potential for further conversion within the Mineral Resource Statement 
from the Inferred category to Indicated and or Measured Classification. On-going drill 
programmes and further metallurgical testwork are in progress to this end. In addition to the 
Inferred Mineral Resource determined at Nkout Centre, Nkout East, Nkout West and D8, the 
magnetic anomaly map shown in Figure 13-32 highlights a number of additional targets that 
may have the potential to host additional resources. 

SRK recognises that an initial reconnaissance drilling programme has been completed over 
the D3 anomaly however at this time insufficient results have been returned to complete a full 
analytical review.

SRK Consulting  Nkout MRE – Main Report 
 

24 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The primary aim of this report was to generate a Mineral Resource Estimate for the Project, 
using all available and valid data as at March 2013. Qualified Person Howard Baker 
(MAusIMM(CP)) believes the aim has been achieved and that the Project has met the original 
objectives. 

It is the opinion of SRK that the quantity and quality of available data is sufficient to generate 
Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources and that the Mineral Resource Statement has been 
classified in accordance with the Guidelines of NI 43-101 and accompanying documents 43-
101.F1 and 43-101.CP. It has an effective date of 28 May 2013. 

In total, SRK has derived an Indicated Mineral Resource of 1,585 Mt grading 33.28% Fe, 
44.6% SiO2, 2.6% Al2O3 and 0.05% P and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 918.8 Mt grading 
30.83% Fe, 47.03% SiO2, 3.41% Al2O3 and 0.05% P. Both Indicated and Inferred material is 
split between the magnetite BIF and the oxidised zones.  

The Indicated material contains 1,435 Mt of magnetite BIF grading 31.98% Fe, 46.60% SiO2, 
2.44% Al2O3 and 0.05% P, 19.9 Mt of zone 110, grading at 60.63% Fe, 5.88% SiO2, 3.04% 
Al2O3 and 0.12% P, 44.5 Mt of zone 120 grading 51.79% Fe, 13.98% SiO2, 5.65% Al2O3 and 
0.09% P and 85.7 Mt of zone 130 grading 39.08% Fe, 39.36% SiO2, 3.79% Al2O3 and 0.06% 
P 

The Inferred material contains 786.8 Mt of magnetite BIF grading 29.71% Fe, 48.56% SiO2, 
3.31% Al2O3 and 0.05% P, 0.1 Mt of zone 110, grading at 57.77% Fe, 5.72% SiO2, 5.75% 
Al2O3 and 0.07% P, 8.0 Mt of zone 120 grading 49.95% Fe, 15.64% SiO2, 6.48% Al2O3 and 
0.09% P and 123.8 Mt of zone 130 grading 36.63% Fe, 39.36% SiO2, 3.79 Al2O3 and 0.06% 
P. 

The Mineral Resource Statement generated by SRK has been restricted to all classified 
material falling within the Whittle pit shell representing a metal price of USD1.4/dmtu for 
magnetite and sinter fines concentrate. This represents the material which SRK considers has 
reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction potential.

25 RECOMMENDATIONS 
It is the recommendation of SRK that Afferro continues to develop the topographic survey of 
the Licence area. While the ground survey is providing an accurate topography on the cut 
lines, it is recommended that a vegetation penetrating airborne survey is undertaken to cover 
the entire licence area and adjoining potential infrastructure. SRK is aware that a series of 
bald earth and satellite imagery has already been completed, however, this was not available 
for use in the report, although once validated, will provide invaluable data for future project 
progression.   

In the primary BIF, SRK recommends that in order to continue to increase the Mineral 
Resource classification from an Inferred to Indicated category, a drill spacing of 400 m along 
strike is required with a minimum of two inclined drillholes per section that target the BIF 
mineralisation in Nkout West. That said, strategic infill holes may be required should the 
geological complexity change in certain areas. To this end, SRK would recommend two 
sections of deep diamond drilling at 253,200E and 253,600E, which will reduce the section 
spacing to 200 m within the most complex portion in the western end of Nkout Centre. 

SRK understands such a drill programme has currently commenced in the Nkout West region 
with the objective of increasing the confidence in both the oxide and fresh material. 

Overall, to increase the Indicated material to the Measured category in the primary BIF zone, 
it is likely that a drill spacing of 200 m along strike is required, although this should be tested 
in a predefined area upon completion of the Indicated drilling campaign. It is estimated that 
the cost to achieve this recommendation is of the order of US$3 million. SRK understands, 
however, that this is not a short term target for Afferro and, as such, has not been included in 
the budget. 

In the oxidised cap, it is likely that a line spacing of 100 m will be required to continue to 
increase the Mineral Resource classification from an Inferred to Indicated category. That said, 
due to the variable nature of grade in this material, closer drill spacing may still be required, 
especially around areas of potential DSO material that is considered to be less uniform.  

25.1 Future Exploration 

Exploration activities at Nkout are continuing with three diamond core drill rigs currently in 
operation on site. The key objectives are to further test and increase the Indicated portion of 
Nkout 110 (DSO) zone and infill around selected targets of potential (specifically Nkout East 
and Nkout West) DSO material with the objective of defining early cash flow material. In 
addition, a programme of drilling is currently underway to further convert and upgrade the 
Inferred classified material to Indicated targeting 225 Mt of DSO/Saprolite and 1.7 Bt of 
magnetite BIF for the Indicated or Measured classification in the overall mineral resource. 

SRK understands programmes are in place accounting for approximately 6,400 m to complete 
this objective. Metallurgical testwork will also continue with additional tests being carried out 
on the upgrade potential of the high grade oxidised material types and the determination of 
optimum grind sizes on the magnetite BIF.

Afferro is also planning on-going scout drilling programme to investigate the potential of 
additional magnetic anomaly targets in the Licence area with a further focus on D9 as 
highlighted in Figure 25-1. SRK recognises that initial reconnaissance drilling programmes 
have been completed over the D3 anomalies; however, at this time this has not been 
incorporated into the Mineral Resource Estimate. 

SRK understand the Afferro budgets have been put in place to facilitate the on-going 
exploration and development programme, with a forecasted expenditure through the 2013 
financial year of approximately US$2.5 million for the on-going drill programme at Nkout. 

It is the opinion of SRK that the funds set aside for this work are sufficient to maintain the 
planned drill programme for additional DSO and further definition on known intercepts suitable 
although careful drill planning to maximise resource upgrade potential is recommended.
