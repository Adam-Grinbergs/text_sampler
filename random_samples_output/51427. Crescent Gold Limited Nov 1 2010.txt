SUMMARY 
 
A review of the Ore Reserves of Crescent Gold's Laverton Gold Project (LGP) has 
been undertaken resulting in a revised set of estimates with the effective date of 30 
June 2010.  The global Ore Reserves for the LGP have been estimated to be 6.5 mt @ 
2.1 g/t Au for 445,000oz contained gold in 12 deposits.  The global Mineral 
Resources for the LGP have been estimated to be 30.5 mt @ 2.1 g/t Au for  2 Moz 
contained gold in 27 deposits (Leggo, 2010).  Resources are inclusive of the Ore 
Reserve (not additional to the Reserves).  These Reserves and Resources have been 
classified according to the JORC Code 2004 as summarised in Table 1, while 
classifications for each deposit are provided in Table 3.  Numbers are rounded to 2 or 
3 significant figures to appropriately reflect the accuracy of the estimates.

Comparison with estimates published by Crescent Gold for June 2009 (Table 2) 
indicates an increase in Ore Reserves of 191,000oz.  Mining at 4 deposits resulted in a 
depletion of the Company's open pit Ore Reserves by approximately 70,000 oz 
contained gold, which has been replaced by additions from new sources and upgrades 
of previously established Reserves. Stockpiles plus open pit Reserves now stand 
45,000oz higher than last year at 300,000oz. The addition of 145,000oz of 
underground Probable Reserves has been achieved through a mining analysis of the 
newly acquired Summit deposit. This has boosted the Company's global Ore Reserves 
up by 190,000oz contained gold. 
 
Ore Reserves were established for the first time at two deposits (Craiggiemore and 
Mary Mac).  Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves were re-estimated resulting in 
significant changes at 2 deposits (Mary Mac South and West Laverton).  Ore Reserves 
were re-estimated resulting in significant changes at the Fish deposit.  Reserves were 
partially depleted by mining operation at Admiral Hill and Sickle. Reserves were 
totally depleted by mining during the year at Castaway and Euro, with mining 
operations now completed.  Figure 1 illustrates the areas in which increases or 
decreases of Ore Reserves have occurred.

ORE RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
Ore Reserves estimates are currently established for 12 deposits and for ore stockpiled 
at surface.  These are summarised in Table 3, classified in accordance with the JORC 
Code.  The table includes the three deposits which were depleted of previously 
reported Ore Reserves during the year.

Additional notes for tables: 
• Mineral Resources are inclusive of Ore Reserves. 
• Figures have been rounded to 2 or 3 significant figures to reflect the accuracy of the estimates 

(note that this rounding can yield apparent computational discrepancies). 
• Contained gold for Mineral Resources is insitu. 
• The resources at Barnicoat, Burtville, Craggiemore, Ida H, Sickle, West Laverton, Crown Jewel, 

Odyssey, Apollo and Liberty lie below existing open pits, while resources at Craggiemore, Ida H 
and Summit are transected by historic underground workings. 

• Mineral Resources for Summit are based on historic underground mine records and reports; 
mining occurred prior 1940 and from 1980 to 1994.  Following a deep drilling programme and 
assessment of historical data, a comprehensive resource evaluation was completed by Resource 
Service Group in 1995.

• Probable Reserves at Summit are based on extensions of the main orebody (Indicated Resources) 
below and lateral to previously stoped areas, and using a A$1350/oz gold price and dilution of 
20% at 0g/t. 

• Open pit Ore Reserves are based on a A$1250/oz gold price; State Royalty 2.5%; Native Title 
Royalty 0.24%;  pit designs and cut-off grades based on costs derived from current contracts for 
mining and hauling, and toll milling at Granny Smith. Contained gold for open pit Ore Reserves is 
net of mine dilution and ore loss. 

• In estimating the Ore Reserves for Admiral Hill ore value was factored down using geologically 
modelled soluble copper grades times cyanide consumption cost per unit copper.  

• Resources and Reserves at Sickle, Euro, Admiral Hill and Castaway have been depleted to account 
for mining which occurred from 1 October 2009 to 1 July 2010. 

• Abbreviations:  Kt = 1,000 tonnes, g/t = grams per tonne, Au = gold,  oz = ounces (Troy). 
 
Probable Reserves at Summit are based on extensions of the main orebody (Indicated 
Resources) below and lateral to previously stoped areas, and using a A$1350/oz gold 
price and dilution of 20% at 0g/t.  Note that Mineral Resources for Summit (Leggo 
2010) are based on historic underground mine records and reports; mining occurred  
prior 1940 and from 1980 to 1994.  Following a deep drilling programme and 
assessment of historical data, a comprehensive resource evaluation was completed by 
Resource Service Group in 1995.  
 
Ore Reserve estimates for the remaining 11 deposits have been based on cost and 
performance factors  derived from current open pit mining operations and ore 
processing at Barrick Gold's Granny Smith Mill, and where required on assumptions 
and estimations made during various studies. 
 
COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS ESTIMATES 
 
Significant changes have been made to the Ore Reserve estimates for the Laverton 
Gold Project, as summarised earlier.  The most recent previous estimates were in June 
2009 for  deposits.  Table 4 details the increases or decreases of Ore Reserves which 
have occurred for each deposit.  Figure 3 depicts these changes graphically.

Ore Reserves were established for the first time at two deposits, Craiggiemore and 
Mary Mac Hill:   

• utilising newly developed geological models,   
• developing detailed wireframes of existing underground openings and void 

spaces and utilising to remove previously mined material from the block 
models, 

• developing detailed wireframes of existing open pits and utilising to remove 
previously mined material from the block models, 

• applying mine production factors based on mining costs of current operations,  
• applying metallurgical costs based on an Ore Purchase Agreement for ore 

processing at the Granny Smith mill and comprehensive metallurgical 
testwork, 

• applying Whittle mine engineering optimisation software to block models 
(utilising blocks classified as Measured and  Indicated),  

• developing detailed pit designs from the optimal shells, applying geotechnical 
factors based on specialist reports. 

 
Ore Reserves were re-estimated resulting in significant changes at the Fish, Mary Mac 
South and West Laverton deposits:  

• utilising newly developed geological Resource models for Mary Mac South 
and West Laverton,   

• developing detailed wireframes of existing open pits and utilising to remove 
previously mined material from the block models at West Laverton,

• applying Whittle mine engineering optimisation software to block models 
(utilising blocks classified as Measured and Indicated ),  

• developing detailed pit designs from the optimal shells, applying geotechnical 
factors based on specialist reports. 

 
Ore Reserves were partially depleted by mining operations at Admiral Hill:  

• utilising the end of June mine survey pick-up to develop detailed wireframes 
of the advancing open pits, and utilised to remove recently mined material 
from the 2009 Reserve model. Metallurgical review was undertaken by Rob 
Veness, Senior Metallurgist, Crescent Gold. 

 
Ore Reserves were partially depleted by mining operations at Sickle:  

• utilising the end of mine survey pick-up to develop detailed wireframes of the   
open pits, and utilised to remove mined material mined in late 2009 from the 
June 2009 Reserve model.  Metallurgical review was undertaken by Rob 
Veness, Senior Metallurgist, Crescent Gold  

 
Ore Reserves were totally depleted by mining during the year at the Castaway and 
Euro deposits with mining operations now completed.  No Reserves are reported for 
these deposits, only Mineral Resources remain. 
 
Ore Reserves for the Bells, Grouse and Lord Byron deposits remain unchanged from 
the 2009 estimates.   
 
The Summit deposit was acquired by Crescent Gold during the period since the 
previous Reserve report.  Summit was previously known as Lancefield.  WMC 
operated an underground mine there from 1980 to 1994.  A comprehensive resource 
evaluation was completed by Resource Service Group in 1995 following a deep 
drilling programme and assessment of WMC historical data.  Indicated Resources for 
the extension of the main ore body form the basis for the Probable Reserve estimated 
here. This work considered conventional underground mining, used a $1350/oz gold 
price and applied dilution of 20% at 0g/t. 
 
The June 2009 estimates have been recompiled into the same format as the June 2010 
estimates in Table 5.
