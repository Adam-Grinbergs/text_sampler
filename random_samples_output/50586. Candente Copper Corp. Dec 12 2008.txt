Executive Summary 

Introduction 

The purpose of this National Instrument 43-101 compliant Technical Report is to provide 
information on a recently completed preliminary economic assessment ("PEA") conducted on 
Candente Resource Corp.'s Cañariaco Norte deposit. The PEA was compiled by 
SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. ("SRK") with the assistance of  
Samuel Engineering, Inc. ("Samuel"), Transmin Metallurgical Consultants ("Transmin"), 
TetraTech Inc. ("Tetra Tech"), AMEC (Peru) S.A. ("AMEC"), Sandwell Peru S.A. ("Sandwell"), 
Vector Peru S.A. ("Vector") and Groundwater International ("GWI").  

This report includes gold and silver values in the mineral resource estimate not previously 
available in the last technical report (SRK July 2008). Preliminary estimates of arsenic and 
antimony were also conducted to estimate the potential impact of these deleterious elements on 
the marketability of the proposed Cañariaco Norte copper concentrate. 

SRK relied extensively on Candente, and in particular Robert Van Egmond, P.Geo., for  
geological, QA/QC, drilling, assay, exploration and general project data and information.  

Location 

The Cañariaco Norte deposit is one of three known porphyry copper mineralizing events in 
Candente's Cañariaco land package. The land holdings consist of 21 contiguous mineral 
concessions that cover 16,560 hectares. The ownership of the Cañariaco property is held 100% by 
Candente Resource Corp. through its Peruvian subsidiary Exploraciones Milenio S.A. ("EMSA"). 

The Cañariaco Norte deposit is in northern Peru in the Lambayeque Department, approximately 
700 km north-northwest of Lima. The UTM coordinates of the centre of the Cañariaco Norte 
deposit are approximately 9,326,200 mN and 690,850 mE (WGS84, Zone 17). The project 
longitude and latitude are approximately 79o 17' W and 6o 05' S, respectively. 

The project is accessible via a combination of paved and dirt roads, approximately 6 hours drive 
north-east of the city of Chiclayo. Access to the property can be difficult in places during times of 
heavy rain due to poor drainage and low quality road bed conditions. The property does not have 
an airstrip.  

The property is located at elevations between 2,700 and 3,600 metres above sea level ("masl') 
and encompasses both tropical forest in the Cañariaco River valley and open grassland on ridges 
and plains at higher elevations. The deposit is located on the west side of the Cañariaco River 
valley. The topography of the deposit area is very rugged and is made up of a series of steep 
valleys and narrow ridges.

Geology 

The geology of the Cañariaco property is comprised of andesite to dacite and rhyolite flows and 
pyroclastics ("VC") intruded by the Cañariaco Norte intrusive complex: a series of 13 million 
year old porphyry stocks, magmatic and hydrothermal breccias and dikes. The complex measures 
a minimum of 1.7 km long, in a north-north-westerly direction, and is roughly 1.1 km wide. 
Six distinct intrusive (3) and breccia bodies (3) host the majority of the mineralization. 
From oldest to youngest, these include: crowded quartz feldspar porphyry ("CQFP"), 
biotite feldspar porphyry ("BFP"), coarse quartz porphyry ("CQP"), hydrothermal 
breccia ("IBxH"), tourmaline breccia ("TBx") and polymictic breccia ("IBxP"). Late feldspar 
porphyry dykes ("FP") occur along a northwest-trending axis through the centre of the deposit. 
These dykes are intact within the intrusive phases, but within the breccia bodies; they are usually 
found as large, weakly fractured clasts. The bordering andesite volcanic units host a minor, but 
locally significant amount of copper mineralization. 

All lithological units have been affected by alteration, with the following types being significant: 
phyllic, argillic, potassic, propylitic and silicic. Advanced argillic alteration is locally common. 
Phyllic and argillic alteration dominate in the upper parts of the deposit, giving way to potassic 
alteration at depths of greater than 100 m. Silicic and propylitic alteration occur mainly near the 
deposit margins. Advanced argillic alteration is common in the west central part of the deposit. 
Alteration intensity is directly related to the intensity of fracturing in the hosting lithologies. 

The deposit has been intensely weathered, resulting in the formation of a leached cap with an 
average thickness of approximately 40 to 50 metres.  

Near surface the deposit has been intensely weathered, resulting in the formation of a leached 
cap. The leached cap varies significantly in thickness, with an average thickness of approximately 
40 to 50 metres. 

Mineralization 

Mineralization at Cañariaco Norte is characteristic of a porphyry copper ("Cu") deposit. 
Copper mineralization affects all of the major rock types, but varies in average grade within each 
rock unit. In general, the highest copper grades (>0.5% Cu) occur in the BFP and IBxP units. 
Intermediate copper grades (0.35% to 0.5% Cu) are most common in the IBxH and the CQP and 
the lowest grades (0.2% to 0.35% Cu) dominate in the CQFP, TBx and VC host rocks. The 
unaltered FP dykes do not contain copper grade unless they occur as fractured blocks or 
fragments within the breccia units, where they may be weakly mineralized (0.1% to 0.2% Cu). 

Copper-bearing minerals are found as disseminations and as fracture and vein fill. Grade 
corresponds to the intensity of fracturing as well as type and intensity of alteration. Higher grade 
copper mineralization at Cañariaco Norte is commonly associated with potassic, phyllic and

argillic alteration, where it occurs mainly as chalcopyrite and chalcocite. Chalcopyrite and minor 
bornite are dominant with potassic, propylitic and silicic alteration. Chalcocite is the dominant 
copper-bearing mineral in rocks affected by phyllic and argillic alteration.  

Enargite and minor tennantite are common with advanced argillic alteration. Pyrite is common 
with all alteration types, averaging approximately 5% throughout the deposit as disseminations, 
veins and fracture coatings. 

Copper accounts for approximately 95% of the value of the mineralization. Gold and silver occur 
in low concentrations throughout the deposit and will provide revenue as a smelting bi-product. 
Molybdenite is low to very low grade throughout Cañariaco Norte and is not anticipated to be 
economic. 

Metallurgy and Mineral Processing 

Metallurgy 

Candente has initiated four separate metallurgical testwork programs for Cañariaco Norte as 
summarized below: 

• Scoping Leachability; 

• Scoping Comminution and Flotation; 

• Pre-feasibility Comminution and Flotation; and 

• Variability. 

Initial resource development identified concentrations of potentially leachable copper sulphide 
mineralization in the upper part of the deposit, and initial scoping level testwork focused on 
characterization of the leachability of the soluble copper minerals. Although the results were 
positive, copper extractions were variable and lower than expected.  

On-going development drilling confirmed the presence of a significantly larger copper sulphide 
resource with a lower concentration of leachable copper sulphide minerals that occur in the upper 
part of the deposit. Therefore, the focus of the scoping level testwork was revised to assess the 
metallurgical response of all the sulphide copper mineralization to flotation. The initial results 
were very encouraging and confirmed that feasibility and variability level testwork focusing on 
the entire flotation process was warranted.  

Tests results indicate that traditional industry proven crushing, grinding and flotation technology 
can be used to concentrate copper into commercial grade concentrates with good recoveries.

ED/HA  2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc November 30, 2008 

 

Testwork completed to date indicate that the ore is soft to moderate in hardness, with an average 
Bond Ball Mill Work Index of 11.2 kWh/tonne. Projected metal recoveries are: copper 90%; gold 
55%; and silver 65%. The final concentrate grade is projected to be 27% copper. 

The predominant copper mineral species are chalcopyrite, covellite, chalcocite, enargite, bornite, 
and tennantite. The copper sulphide minerals are mainly associated with pyrite and other sulfide 
gangue minerals. 

Based on the testwork and the proposed process flowsheet, the concentrate will contain arsenic 
and possibly antimony at levels that will incur penalties from the smelters. Additional testwork is 
ongoing to assess process options to reduce the arsenic content of the final concentrate.  

Mineral Processing 

The results to date from the metallurgical testing program and knowledge of similar ore deposits in 
the region were used to develop the design criteria and process flow sheet for treatment of the 
Cañariaco Norte plant feed material. The process calls for application of conventional crushing, 
grinding, flotation and dewatering technology typical of current industry practice at projects of 
similar scope.  

The Cañariaco Norte process plant is proposed to have a nominal production rate of 75,000 tonnes 
per day and will operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The annual plant production will be 
27.4 million tonnes.  

The process plant will be located at the mine site slightly north of the Cañariaco Norte pit. 
Run-of-mine ore will be trucked from the pit and dumped into a primary gyratory crusher with 
crusher discharge conveyed to a coarse ore stockpile ahead of the process plant. Crushed ore will be 
reclaimed from the stockpile and conveyed to a single semi-autogenous grinding mill (SAG mill). 
SAG mill discharge will be fed to two parallel ball mills operating in closed circuit with cyclone size 
classification. Cyclone overflow will report to a rougher flotation circuit for copper recovery and a 
cleaner flotation circuit for concentrate upgrading. Flotation tailings will be pumped to a land-based 
containment facility. Process water will be recycled from the tailings facility for re-use in the 
process. Final cleaner concentrate will be dewatered in a thickener and pressure filter then 
transported by truck to a concentrate storage and load-out facility at a port on the coast. Copper 
concentrate production will average approximately 350,000 to 400,000 dry metric tonnes ("dmt") 
per year. 

Mineral Resource Estimate 

The resource estimate was conducted on a dataset that included the results of 60,580 metres of 
drilling in 213 drillholes completed during the period of 1973 to March 2008).  

The principal components of SRK's estimation work included:

• Construction of 3D lithological and structural geology models to constrain the data selection 
and interpolation processes. The final geological model consists of six mineralized domains 
and one non-mineralized domain;  

• Copper, gold and silver mineral resource estimation by ordinary kriging. For the resource 
estimates, capped assay data were composited to 2 m intervals, the most common sample 
length. Whenever gaps were encountered in sample intervals, waste grades were assigned to 
these intervals.  

• Construction of a mineral inventory block model and subsequent Whittle™ resource shell 
was based on the following parameters: 
− $2.10/lb Cu; 
− 88% mill recovery; 
− $1.45/t mined mining cost; 
− $3.80/t ore process and G&A cost; 
− $0.36/lb recovered Cu offsite costs; 
− 95% Mining recovery; 
− 5% waste dilution; 
− 40° W, 42° E slope angles. 

• Classification of the resource. Block classification was applied to the model using a 
combination of the average distance to composites and number of drillholes contributing to 
the local estimate. To some extent, the classification represents the results of visual 
assessments on sections and plan views. The classified mineral resources for the Cañariaco 
Norte deposit were limited to the Whittle™ resource shell, and are presented below. 

The results of SRK's copper, silver and gold mineral resource estimation are shown in Table 1 
with the mineral inventory by cut-off grade shown in Table 2.

Mine Plan 

The Cañariaco Norte deposit is proposed to be developed as an open pit. Mining of the Norte 
deposit will produce a total of 517.6 million tonnes ("Mt") of mill feed and 277.9 Mt of waste 
(0.54:1 strip ratio) over a 20-year mine operating life. The current life of mine ("LOM") plan 
focuses on achieving the required mill feed production rate, mining of higher grade material early 
in schedule, and balancing grade and strip ratios. Due to physical constraints and milling 
throughput, minimal stockpile and blending capacity was assumed. 

Mine design for the Cañariaco Norte pit was initiated with the development of a 
Net Smelter Return ("NSR") model. The model included estimates of metal prices, exchange rate, 
mining dilution, mill recovery, concentrate grade, smelting and refining payables and costs, 
freight and marketing costs and royalties. The NSR model was based on a 15 m x 15 m x 15 m 
block size. The model was then used with the Gemcom Whittle - Strategic Mine Planning™ 
("Whittle") software to determine the optimal mining shell. Mine planning and scheduling was 
then conducted on the optimal pit shell with the use of MineSight™ software. The mineral 
resources within the pit shell are summarized in Table 3 below using an internal cut-off grade of 
0.12% Cu and 5% dilution. 

The mining sequence was divided into three phases designed to maximize grade, reduce 
pre-stripping requirements in the early years, while keeping the process plant at full production 
capacity (except in Year 1 when the plant is expected to achieve 80% of its capacity). The LOM 
mine production schedule is shown in Table 4.

Waste Management 
Non-potentially acid generating ("non-PAG") waste rock from the Cañariaco Norte pit, as well as 
potential acid generating ("PAG") rock will be deposited in an engineered dump adjacent to the pit 
in the Cañariaco River Valley. Due to the pit and deposit geometry, the potential for backfilling 
waste rock into previously mined out areas is limited. Table 5 below summarizes the waste material 
to be mined in the Norte pit.

Tailings from the process plant will be sent to the proposed tailings containment facility 8 km to the 
west of the plant in an adjacent valley. In order to contain the 511 Mt of tailings, a rock fill dam will 
be constructed (along with smaller saddle berm). It is proposed that the dam material be sourced 
from a quarry that is contained within the ultimate tailings storage facility. The total material 
required for the dam construction is approximately 34 Mm3.  

Environmental Considerations 

Candente initiated an independent environmental impact assessment in 2007 with AMEC, a 
recognized environmental specialist consultant in Peru. This assessment is ongoing, but at this point 
the project requires more definition in order to make an accurate assessment of environmental 
impacts and their influence on project approval. Because of the high sensitivity of the area, 
engineering and management components will turn into a key factor for the assessment. 

The mining and processing operations will be located in the Cañariaco River Valley, and the tailings 
containment facility will be located in the Yerma Valley. The area is comprised of humid plateau 
areas best locally known as "Jalcas" or "Paramus", and humid mountain forest. These ecosystems 
spread from southern Ecuador in the north, down to the Huancabamba depression in northern Peru 
and through the Western Cordillera and are deeply fragmented by human activities. 

Approximately 450 families inhabit the immediate project area, living on small farms where they 
engage in a subsistence way of life. There are two small communities within the larger area, Cañaris 
and Mariátegui that provide limited services for the area. Relocation of families in the immediate

project area would be required to facilitate project development and a baseline study is planned to 
assess the resettlement process.  

The project area is located within the largest remaining montain forest in the Western Cordillera of 
Peru. This montane forest area holds species formerly known only in Ecuador and Colombia.  

In the project area, biodiversity indicators in some groups are outstanding. Orchid species outnumber 
that known in other montane forests in northern Peru and several species newly recorded for Peru, as 
well as endemic species have been reported. Over 180 bird species have been identified including 
some protected species (specifically the "bearded guan"). Some critically endangered mammals (the 
"spectacled bear", the "mountain paca") and the southernmost recorded sighting for "mountain 
tapir" have been reported in the general project area. 

The investigations to date have identified several new species and fauna that were not previously 
recorded, including three new species of frogs. It is possible these new species and fauna may exist 
elsewhere in Peru and an objective of future investigations should be to confirm their presence in 
other areas. The geochemistry of the Cañariaco Norte deposit and its acid rock drainage/metal 
leaching (ARD/ML) potential has not been fully assessed. However, based on the current geological 
and mineralogical descriptions of the property, the potential exists for ARD/ML generation to occur 
in the waste dump, open pit and tailings containment. The preliminary design for this project 
includes conceptual mitigation measures for potential acid generation. Additional testwork is 
planned to characterize ARD potential.  

Candente has initiated baseline hydrological assessments in the project area to assess surface and 
groundwater conditions. Water management will be critical to successful project development and 
for this assessment Candente has applied several key design features to protect the integrity of local 
water resources. 

A closure plan will be required for this project and will be developed as part of prefeasibility and 
feasibility level assessment. Costs have been included in this study for eventual closure. 

Markets 

Cañariaco Norte concentrate is projected to average 27% copper, 2 to 3 /t gold and 60 to 90 g/t 
silver. Concentrate production will average 350,000 to 400,000 dmt per year over the life of the 
project. During the first three years of operation higher grade ore will be mined and as a result, 
concentrate production will be 400,000 to 500,000 dmt per year.  

Cañariaco Norte concentrate will be marketed to international smelters in Asia, Europe and North 
America. For concentrate transport costs, it has been projected that approximately 75% would be 
sold to Asian smelters and the remainder to European smelters.  

Cañariaco Norte concentrate is expected to contain elevated levels of arsenic which will incur 
smelter penalties. An allowance for arsenic penalties has been included in this assessment. Candente

has requested Samuel Engineering Inc. to evaluate process options to reduce the level of arsenic in 
the concentrate produced. The concentrate may also contain low levels of antimony and an 
allowance for a minor antimony penalty has been included. 

Economic Analysis  

The economic analysis described in this report only provides a preliminary overview of the project 
economics based on broad, factored assumptions. In addition to measured and indicated resources of 
480 Mt, the economic analysis also uses 38 Mt of inferred mineral resources, approximately 7% of 
the LOM total tonnage. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to 
have the economic considerations applied to them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is 
no certainty that the inferred resources will be upgraded to a higher resource category. There is also 
no certainty that the results of this preliminary economic assessment will be realized.  

Tables 5 to 8 show summaries of the assumptions used in the economic analyses. Tables 9 and 10 
show the net present value ("NPV") and internal rate of return ("IRR") for each case. 

The capital cost estimate is based on 3rd quarter 2008 costs.

Conclusions 

Industry standard mining, process design, construction methods and economic evaluation practices 
have been used to assess the Cañariaco Norte Project. Sufficient and representative samples and 
information were available to conduct metallurgical testing, estimate a mineral resource and 
complete this PEA.  

Sufficient work has been done on permitting and environmental aspects of the project to indicate that 
required permits to proceed with the project, to operate the mine and to deal with mine closure at the 
end of the mine life, have a reasonable likelihood of being granted. It must be noted that the project 
is in an environmentally sensitive area, with newly recorded species of flora and fauna. The 
development of this project will not require the relocation of any villages or towns but a number of 
local residents will require relocation. 

Based on current knowledge and assumptions, and within the very preliminary parameters of a PEA, 
the results of this study show that the project achieves a 15% pre-tax IRR at a copper price of 
$2.14/lb and a 12% pre-tax IRR at $1.98/lb Cu. The copper price required to produce a breakeven 
cash flow (undiscounted and post-tax) is $1.45/lb. Based on sensitivity analyses the project is very 
sensitive to copper price and grade followed by operating and capital costs.  

As with almost all mining ventures, there are a large number of risks and opportunities that can 
affect the outcome of the Cañariaco Norte project. Many of these risks and opportunities are based 
on a lack of comprehensive scientific information or the lack of control over external drivers such as 
metal price, exchange rates, etc. The following section identifies the most significant potential risks 
and opportunities currently identified for the Cañariaco Norte project. Subsequent higher-level 



SRK Consulting                                        
PEA Technical Report, Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru Page xiv 

GED/HA  2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc November 30, 2008 

engineering studies will need to further refine these risks and opportunities, identify new ones and 
define mitigation or opportunity implementation plans.  

Summary of Major Risks 

• Low copper price is the greatest potential risk to the project viability;   

• Inability to secure all necessary permits in a timely manner;  

• Variation between the predicted and actual deposit shapes, potentially leading to higher dilution; 

• Project delay, due to finance delay, non-availability of key personnel, construction equipment, 
contractors and long lead times on capital equipment delivery  

• Increased excavation cost, due to potentially poor geotechnical conditions; 

• Capital Cost Estimate ("CAPEX") and Operating Cost Estimate ("OPEX") costs escalation. 
Numerous mining projects have experienced significant cost overruns in part due to equipment 
and labour scarcity and high commodity costs; 

• PAG rock volumes have not been adequately defined, and if greater than currently estimated, 
could lead to a revised waste management plan and increased waste dump, water treatment and 
reclamation costs; 

• Metallurgical recoveries and mineral processing assumptions may be less than stated; 

• Arsenic and, to a lesser extent, antimony may make the Cañariaco Norte concentrate more 
difficult to sell or may require additional capital and operating costs for a site process to reduce 
these deleterious elements in the concentrate; and 

• Transportation costs and smelting terms vary with time and the potential for increased terms is a 
risk. 

Opportunities 

The most significant opportunities are listed below in order of potential to improve the project's 
financial results. 

• Higher copper prices; 

• Reduction in capital cost due to reduction in prices of equipment and materials; 

• Reduction in operating cost associated with lower consumable costs, primarily grinding steel, 
reagents and diesel fuel, transportation and Treatment Charges and Refining Costs ("TC/RC") 
costs; 

• Increased metallurgical recoveries and concentrate grades; and 

• Potential reduction in income tax payable due to a proposed new tax law recently passed that 
may allow deduction of certain infrastructure costs.

Recommendations 

Based on the findings of this PEA, the Cañariaco Norte project starts to show the economic viability 
at copper prices above $2.00/lb, depending on the hurtle rate required. If Candente management 
deem this to be a situation worth pursuing, then they should proceed with information gathering to a 
pre-feasibility study level. Upon performing the necessary sampling and test work, a pre-feasibility 
study could be to provide construction and operational design, scheduling, costing and economic 
analysis. The following are the major recommended to complete a pre-feasibility study: 

• Diamond drilling of the Cañariaco Norte deposit to provide better samples and information for, 
geotechnical characterization, definition of the mineral resource to 100% indicated and measured 
classification, and ABA analysis. A 3-month drilling program is estimated to cost $2M. 

• Metallurgical and mineral processing tests including, but not limited to, crushing and milling 
characteristics, process recovery optimization, reagent consumption, reagent type, mill feed 
reactivity, characterization of mineralization, etc. Estimated to take 6 months and $0.5M. 

• ML/ARD testing and development of a PAG-rock model. Costs are included in the estimate 
above.  

• Pursuit of environment assessment and permitting. A $1M to $2M cost is estimated. 

• Conduct a pre-feasibility study. Estimated cost of $1.5M.

2 Reliance on Other Experts 
This preliminary economic assessment used a copper concentrate marketing study conducted by 
Oliver Merton and Wolfgang Treder of Base Metals Marketing Services Ltd. ("BMMS"). The 
BMMS study provided opinions on the future copper concentrates market for Cañariaco. The 
purpose of the marketing report was to describe the market characteristics for copper concentrates 
and give advice with regard to the commercial terms to be used. The study was only preliminary 
in nature and there is no guarantee that the predictions made in the study will be accurate in the 
future.  

The study was prepared as follows: 

• Comments on product marketability were based on Merton and Treder's extensive 
experience;  

• No input at this stage was sought from the smelting community; 

• Copper metal and concentrate market information was based on a broad array of market data 
sources available to the authors; and 

• Freight and port information was based on information provided by Serpac Inc, Lima and 
Platou, Norway. 

SRK deems the input of BMMS to be reasonable for this level of study and within industry 
norms.

3 Property Description and Location 
This section of the report is taken from Minefill's April 26, 2007 report titled "Updated Technical 
Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Cañariaco Norte Porphyry Copper Project 
– Starter Pit Option, Department of Lambayeque, Peru" and revised based on current 
information. 

3.1 Property Location 
The Cañariaco property is located at Latitude 06° 05' South and Longitude 79° 17' West, in the 
Western Cordillera of the Peruvian Andes, in the Cañaris District of the Province of Ferreñafe, 
Department of Lambayeque of north-western Peru (map sheet 13-E Incahuasi). The Cañariaco 
property is situated approximately 700 km northwest of Lima, the capital of Peru, and 
approximately 110 km to the northeast of the city of Chiclayo.

3.2 Land Tenure 

The Cañariaco property comprises a total area of 16,560 ha in 21 concessions as listed in 
Table 3.1. Three porphyry copper zones (Cañariaco Norte, Cañariaco Sur, and Quebrada Verde) 
have been identified on the Cañariaco property. Only the Cañariaco Norte zone has been the 
subject of substantial exploration work and only the Cañariaco Norte zone is considered in detail 
in this report. Candente, through its Peruvian subsidiary EMSA, holds a 100% interest in the 
Cañariaco property. Figure 3.2 is a plan of the concessions, in UTM co-ordinates 
(PSAD 56, Zone 17).

3.3 Surface Rights 

The Peruvian Government requires any property developer to either purchase the surface rights or 
make an appropriate agreement with the surface rights owner, for access to a property. In the case 
of the holders of mining concessions, they are protected under the Peruvian Constitution and 
Civil Code. Their concession rights do not, however, confer ownership of the land - the owner of 
a mining concession must deal with the registered land owner to obtain the right of access to 
fulfill the production obligations inherent in the concession grant. All transactions and contracts 
pertaining to a mining concession must duly be registered with the Public Mining Registry, in the 
event of subsequent disputes in law. The issue of land tenure continues to be of significance in 
Peru, not least because the national cadastral system for agricultural land ownership is not always 
accurate.

3.4 Mining Law 

The General Mining Law of Peru is administered by the Ministry of Energy and Mines 
(Ministerio de Energía y Minas, "MEM" or "Ministry"). The law was changed in the mid-1990s 
to encourage the development of the country's considerable mineral resources. The law defines 
and regulates different categories of mining activity, according to the stage of a project's 
development. Details of the law were consolidated in the 'Single Revised Text of the General 
Mining Law' of 1992 (Government document D.S. No. 014-92-EM, 19926).  

3.4.1 Mineral Concession Law 

Ownership of mineral claims is controlled by mining concessions that are established using 
UTM co-ordinates to define areas of interest that are measured in hectares. Individual concessions 
must have a minimum size of 100 ha and a maximum size of 1,000 ha. New concessions have to 
be orientated in a north-south direction; pre-existing concessions are based on the 'punto de 
partido' system and can be of any orientation. Mining titles are irrevocable and perpetual, as long 
as the required annual maintenance fees (derecho vigencia) are up to date and fully paid to MEM, 
by 30 June each year following granting of a concession. The fees are paid in advance. 
The annual fee for metallic mineral concessions is $3/ha for each concession that is either 
actually acquired or pending (petitorio). The concession holder must reach a minimum level of 
commercial production of $100/ha in mineral sales within eight years of the concession being 
granted. If there is no production income after eight years the annual fee increases to $4/ha until 
the 14th year and to $10/ha thereafter. 

3.4.2 Exploitation 

The concession holder must sustain a minimum level of annual commercial production greater 
than $100/ha in gross sales before the end of the sixth year following the granting of the 
concession. If the concession has been put into production within the six year period, the annual 
rental fee remains the same, up to the beginning of Year Nine, when it increases to $4/ha for 
years nine to 14. The annual rental rises to $10/ha for each year thereafter. If the concession has 
not been put into production within a six year period, the annual rental increases from the first 
semester of the seventh year to $9 ($3 for derecho vigencia, plus a $6 penalty), until the minimum 
production level is met. If, by the start of the twelfth year from granting a concession the 
minimum production level is not been achieved, the annual rental increases to $23/ha ($3 for 
derecho vigencia, plus a $20 penalty). A concession holder can, however, be exonerated from 
paying penalties if he/she can demonstrate that at least ten times the penalty for the total 
concession was invested during the previous year. The investment must be documented and it 
must be accompanied by a copy of the relevant annual tax statement ('declaración jurada de 
impuesto a la renta') and payment of the annual fees.  

 



SRK Consulting                              
PEA Technical Report Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 31 

GED/HA 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM November 30, 2008 

  

A concession will terminate if the annual rental is not paid either for three years in total over the 
period that the concession is held, or for two consecutive years over the period the concession is 
held. 

3.5 Environmental Regulations 

The Peruvian Government is reported to be increasingly concerned about the environment and 
environmental compliance, especially as regards mining and milling operations. New legislation 
is in place (Regulation on Protection of Environment – DSN No. 016-93, with updates made in 
2003). According to the available information (source: www.minem.gob.pe), The General Mining 
Law of Peru can require concession holders to prepare: 

• An Environmental Evaluation (Evaluación Ambiental, or EA) for mining exploration 
programs; 

• An Environmental Impact Assessment (Estudio de Impacto Ambiental, or EIA) if either 
renewed mining or milling activity is to take place or existing operations are to be expanded 
by more than 50%; 

• A Environmental Management Plan which establishes a company's environmental 
compliance plan for mining and milling operations; and 

• A Mine Closure Plan (Plan de Cierre), prior to mining construction and operation. 

3.5.1 Environmental Evaluation Plans  

The environmental requirements for mining exploration programs are divided into classifications 
A, B & C. Classification A covers general exploration activities and requires no prior 
authorization. Classification B requires an application with payment of $50 prior to drilling up to 
20 holes within a 10 ha area. Classification C covers mining exploration programs with more than 
20 holes, exploration areas of more than 10 ha and/or the construction of more than 50 m of 
tunnels. This requires the submission of a suitable EA for approval (or disapproval) to MEM prior 
to commencing work. The Ministry is required to approve/disapprove (usually with observations 
to fulfill in order to obtain approval) an EA within 20 days of its submission. If a response is not 
received within 20 days the EA may be assumed to be (automatically) approved. 

3.5.2 Environmental Impact Assessments 

When applying for a new mining or processing concession, to increase the size of its existing 
processing operations by more than 50% or to execute any other mining project an EIA must be 
submitted to MEM: 

• The purpose of an EIA is to identify environmental problems that might arise as a result of 
mining or metallurgical activity (an EIA is prepared instead of a Programa de Adecuación y 
Manejo Ambiental ("PAMA"); 



SRK Consulting                              
PEA Technical Report Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 32 

GED/HA 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM November 30, 2008 

  

• An EIA must indicate the applying company's intention to spend at least 1% of annual sales 
on environmental expenditures; 

• The Ministry is required to approve/disapprove an EIA within 180 days of its submission; 
and 

• If a response is not received within 45 days the EIA may be assumed to be (automatically) 
disapproved. 

3.5.3 Environmental Management Plan (EMP) 

An EMP establishes a company's environmental compliance plan. Included within the scope of 
environmental compliance are considerations of the impact on the environment of mining 
disturbance, capital investments in environmental control, monitoring systems, 
waste management control and site restoration. This is par of the EIA and needs to be revised on 
a yearly basis and submitted to the DGAAM if any change is required. 

3.5.4 Mine Closure Plans 

The Peruvian Government enacted its first Mine Closure Law in October 2003; it is unclear as to 
whether any amendments have been made. In general terms, the 2003 law sets out the obligations 
of a company with a mine in operation, as regards rehabilitation, closure and post closure 
activities. Included within this scope is the requirement for mining companies to prepare and 
submit closure plans that define the steps to be taken, including costs, to protect the environment 
from solids, liquids and gases generated by mining work. The 2003 law mandates the 
establishment of an Environmental Guarantee at the early stages of a project, to avoid the 
possibility of a lack of future funds.  

3.5.5 Permits 

The Cañariaco property does not have any known environmental liabilities. A Class B EA was 
conducted by GEMA Consultants (GEMA) for Candente, as required in law when trenching, 
drilling or other major work is performed. GEMA also conducted a Class C EA, and obtained a 
Class C Permit from the Peruvian government, for advanced drilling and exploration work at 
Cañariaco. 

Environmental baseline studies and monitoring are being carried out by Candente. A social and 
environmental impact assessment study framework has been prepared and is being fulfilled. 
Studies include the determination of the geochemical characteristics of the waste and ore grade 
rock, assessment of the localized mine area for a potential water supply and social and 
community relation studies.

Once these studies are completed to levels in accordance with the requirements of the Peruvian 
Government and meet the guidelines set out in the Equator Principles, a process of obtaining all 
the required environmental, construction and mining permits will be undertaken. The main permit 
requirements identified to date for the start of construction and mining operations are summarized 
below. 

• Main Permitting Requirements: 

• Environmental Studies and Permits (EIA); 

• Water Authorization; 

• Archaeological Evaluation; 

• Mining Plan and Closure Plan; 

• Mining Operation Certificate (COM); 

• Easement by Agreement; 

• Procedure of Real Servitude; 

• Construction Permit; 

• Municipality Permits to Construct; 

• Labour Permits; 

• Surface Water Use Licence; 

• Ground Water Use Licence; 

• Sanitary Authorization for Waste Water Treatment; 

• Permits to Build Roads; 

• Transportation deed for controlled substances and products; 

• Beneficiation Concession (necessary to process the mineral); 

• Authorization to Start Operation.

4 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography 

4.1 Accessibility 

The Cañariaco property is accessible by road from Lima via the city of Chiclayo (population 
approximately 1 million). Either the Pan-American Highway (700 km, 11-hour trip) or one of the 
daily commercial airline flights can be taken from Lima to Chiclayo. 

The route from Chiclayo to the Cañariaco property is presently a 149 km, 6-hour trip along 
mostly unimproved roads via Incahuasi. The road is currently not suitable for heavy trucks. There 
is no landing strip on the property.

Figure 4.1: Cañariaco Property Access Routes and Infrastructure 

4.2 Climate 

The temperature on the property varies with altitude; it ranges between approximately 3°C and 
20°C. The region receives between 830 mm and 1700 mm of rain a year with the rainy season 
existing from November to March. The climate is not expected to affect ground-based operations, 
although helicopter supported operations and four-wheel drive roads may be affected during the 
rainy season. 

Within the property several climate zones exist and temperature differences between the lower 
forested valleys and the upper grassy ridges can be up to 10 degrees. The vegetation at higher 
elevations is comprised mainly of ichu and other types of natural grasses used for livestock 
grazing. Within the forested valleys localized agriculture plots are maintained for subsistence 
farming.  

The community of Cañaris, located to the north of the mineral resource area within temperate 
highlands, is agriculturally based. The main crops consist of potatoes, maize and a variety of 
vegetables and herbs.

4.3 Local Resources 

Peru has a long history of mining, with the result that mining professionals and machine operators 
are generally available in most population centers. It is projected that Candente will be able to 
source Peruvian personal for virtually all mine administration and operation requirements. 

Supplies and other normal services are available at Chiclayo. Specialist exploration services, such 
as drilling and geophysical and geochemical analyses, are usually contracted out of Lima 
(Currie, 2004). 

4.4 Infrastructure 

The Cañariaco property has a fully established camp and catering facility for 100 persons. Core 
handling facilities are also on site along with a weather station. Core storage and detailed logging 
takes place in Chiclayo at Candente's secure facility. 

The camp is situated near the Cañariaco River and has ample water supply. Electricity is 
generated on site. 

4.5 Physiography 

The Cañariaco Norte project and mineral resource are located along the eastern side of the 
continental divide at elevations ranging between 2,700 and 3,600 masl. All waters flowing from 
the project area are within the Atlantic basin. The topography varies from steep incised valleys at 
lower elevations to open grassy highlands (see Figure 4.2). Within the mineral resource area the 
topography is steep with fingers of sub-tropical forests extending up the small valleys. These 
forests transition into open grass lands and broad valleys, as the elevation increases (>3000 masl ) 
to the north of the main mineralized zone.

5 History 
Copper was first discovered at Cañariaco Norte in the 1970s during a regional exploration 
program carried out by the Peruvian Servicio Nacional de Geología y Minería ("INGEMMET"), 
in cooperation with a British Geological Survey team (Wilson, 1999). Exploration was sporadic 
with phases of exploration and drilling in the 1970s and 1990s, until Candente initiated their 
exploration efforts in 2004. 

5.1 INGEMMET 

INGEMMET identified four centers of alteration and mineralization during follow-up exploration 
in 1971, which included stream sediment sampling and a detailed geochemical study of the 
Rio Cañariaco valley. Geological mapping at 1:25,000 defined 9 km2 of alteration and 
mineralization, which was then more closely explored by means of soil and rock chip sampling, 
detailed surficial mapping and diamond drilling. 

In 1973 INGEMMET carried out a total of 1,500 m of diamond drilling in five vertical drillholes 
to depths of 300 m in the Cañariaco Norte zone. In 1974 Induced Polarization (IP) geophysical 
surveys were completed across parts of the Cañariaco Norte zone. 

5.2 Placer Dome 

In 1994, Placer Dome Exploration Inc. ("Placer Dome") optioned the Cañariaco property from 
the Peruvian Government and carried out geological mapping at a scale of 1:1,000, as well as 
rock chip sampling over an area of 1.3 km by 1.5 km. A total of 2,200 m, of trenching for 
mapping and sampling was also completed, along with 80 test pits across the Cañariaco Norte and 
Cañariaco Sur zones, petrographic studies and re-interpretation of INGEMMET's geophysical 
surveys. Three inclined diamond drillholes totalling 854 m were drilled in 1995, in the Cañariaco 
Norte zone. Placer Dome dropped their option in 1997. 

5.3 Billiton 

Billiton Exploration and Mining Peru B.V. ("Billiton") optioned the Cañariaco property in 1999 
from the Peruvian Government, following which a 3 km long access road to Billiton's exploration 
camp at Cañariaco Sur was completed. Their exploration program included geological mapping, 
systematic soil and chip sampling and both IP and ground magnetic geophysical surveys. This 
was followed by a diamond drilling program totalling 957.7 m in eight holes and comprising 
three holes (555.7 m) in the Cañariaco Norte zone, three holes (472.5 m) in the Cañariaco Sur 
zone and two holes (+100 m) in the Quebrada Verde zone. Petrographic samples were collected 
and studied, and sequential leach testing was carried out on drillcore samples from Cañariaco 
Norte. Induced polarization and ground magnetic were also undertaken over the Cañariaco Sur 
and Quebrada Verde zones.

Billiton dropped its option in 2000, for the same reasons as Placer Dome: the prevailing copper 
price (less than 80 cents per pound from 1997 to 2001) and a very tough option deal with the 
Peruvian government. 

5.4 Candente 

In February 2002, Candente, through the Peruvian subsidiary EMSA, won an auction for the 
Cañariaco property and acquired 100% ownership with no royalty or net smelter return liabilities, 
for a single payment of $75,000. Following the auction, and prior to purchasing the Cañariaco 
property, Candente mandated Knight Piésold to conduct a fatal flaw study. The study scope 
included the identification of potential locations for leach pads and waste stockpiles, as well as an 
overview of the permit requirements for the project. 

EMSA commenced exploration on the Cañariaco Norte project in January 2004 and to the end of 
drilling for the resource estimate (March 2008) a total of 216 holes were drilled across the 
Cañariaco Norte zone by EMSA (12 holes/2,647 m in 2004, 24 holes/7388 m in 2005, 
46 holes/15,984 m in 2006, 123 holes/31,337 m in 2007 and 13 holes/3570 m in 2008). In 
addition: 

• Between January and August 2004, a program of geological mapping, prospecting, round 
magnetic geophysics, rock chip sampling, petrographic studies, bulk sampling for leach 
column testing and re-logging of existing drillcore was carried out; 

• In 2005, EMSA carried out additional detailed geological mapping programs, pre-EMSA 
drill core was sampled and re-assayed for total copper, as well as for sequential copper; 
eight holes were analyzed by ICP and 36 holes were fire assayed for gold. 

• In 2006, EMSA carried out further detailed geological mapping programs, established survey 
beacons and took bulk samples for leach column testing; and 

• Candente commissioned NI 43-101 compliant technical reports authored by James A. Currie 
in 2004, by James McCrea in 2005 and May 2006 (modified in June 2006), 
Merit International Consultants Ltd ("Merit") in June 2006 and Minefill Services ("Minefill") 
in January 2007. 

• Diamond drilling continued after March 2008 for metallurgical sample procurement, 
geotechnical drilling and deep resource delineation until mid September 2008. 

On May 3rd, 2006 Candente filed the James McCrea report on the SEDAR website, entitled 
'Technical Report on the Cañariaco Copper Porphyry Prospect'. The report covers the Cañariaco 
property description, history, geology, exploration, sample preparation, data verification, and 
Mineral Resources and Reserve estimating. The 2006 Merit report was filed on SEDAR on June 
26, 2006. The 2004 Currie report and the 2005 McCrea report are available for viewing at 
Candente's offices.

The Minefill report titled "Updated Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment on 
the Cañariaco Norte Porphyry Copper Project Starter Pit Option, Department of Lambayeque, 
Peru", was filed on SEDAR on April 18, 2007. 

5.5 Historical Resource Estimates 

INGEMMET, Placer Dome and Billiton compiled a resource estimates for the Cañariaco Norte 
zone. 

• INGEMMET, based on two drillhole intersections, estimated resources of 8.84 Mt of 
probable resource at an average grade of 0.78% Cu and 0.001% Mo, and 380,625,000 tonnes 
of possible resource at a variable grade of between 0.45% to 0.80% Cu and 0.001% to 
0.003% Mo.  

• Placer Dome believed the Cañariaco property had the potential to host in excess of 800 Mt 
grading better than 0.5%, of which 365 Mt was estimated for Cañariaco Norte; and 

• Billiton concluded that the Cañariaco Norte zone contained a minimum of 320 Mt at an 
average grade of 0.45% Cu (a 1,000 m by 600 m by 200 m block was considered in analysis) 
and an average specific gravity of 2.7 was assumed - although it was noted that within the 
block, poorly constrained zones of >0.6% Cu existed that totalled approximately 19% of the 
overall block (60 Mt). 

The resource estimates outlined above are included solely for completeness. They do not comply 
with NI 43-101 standards and validity of the results is not confirmed.

6 Geological Setting 

6.1 Regional Geology 

The oldest rocks in the region are Precambrian to early Paleozoic pelitic schists of the Olmos 
complex, which are unconformably covered by marine sediments intercalated with minor 
volcanic units belonging to the La Leche Formation of late Triassic/early Jurassic 
(Figures 6.1 and 6.2). These formations are capped by an early to late Jurassic 
volcano-sedimentary sequence, called the Oyotún Formation. The region was uplifted and eroded 
in late Jurassic/early Cretaceous. During early Cretaceous the region subsided and a regionally 
extensive quartz arenite (the lower part of the Goyllarisquizga Group) was unconformably 
deposited over the older formations. From the end of early Cretaceous to middle of late 
Cretaceous, up to 1,500 m of marls, shales and limestone were deposited over the region. 
Sedimentation stopped abruptly at the beginning of early Tertiary, with the eruption and 
deposition of volcanic units of the Llama and Porculla Formations, which together comprise the 
Calipuy Group. A period of uplift and erosion followed. Renewed volcanic activity commenced 
with eruption of the Huambos Formation during Late Tertiary, capping the stratigraphic sequence 
in the region (Freeze et al, 2002). 

The geology in the immediate vicinity of the Cañariaco property (Figure 6.1) is comprised of 
andesite to dacite and rhyolite flows and pyroclastics of the Calipuy Group, which were intruded 
by a series of Early to Late Tertiary (13 million years) porphyry stocks, breccias and dikes 
(Müller and Steiner, 1976; Minero Peru, 2000). The Calipuy Group dacite and rhyolite units 
underlie the andesite pyroclastics and flows. Below the dacite and rhyolite units are shales and 
marine sediments. 

A number of circular features have been identified in the district. A single circular feature that 
measures 8 km by 10 km encompasses all three mineralized zones found on the Cañariaco 
property (Cañariaco Norte, Cañariaco Sur and Quebrada Verde zones). The main feature is 
centered on, or close to, major fault intersections, which suggests that emplacement of the 
intrusive complex was localized by fault intersections where northwest-southeast trending faults 
intersect northeast-southwest trending faults (Murphy, 2004).

6.2 Cañariaco Norte Geology 

The Cañariaco Norte intrusive complex forms a body that is elongated along a north-northwest/ 
south-southeast axis for a distance of at least 1.7 km. The complex is up to 1.1 km wide and has 
been drilled to depths of 767 m where it remains open. Three intrusive phases form the main 
annulus of the mineralized zone. The intrusive phases were later cut by three late mineral breccias 
that brought additional copper mineralization. Both intrusives and breccias utilized structurally 
weak zones for emplacement. 

Andesite pyroclastics and flows dominate on the west, north and south sides of the intrusive 
complex where elevations are higher. The east side of the intrusive complex is lower in elevation 
and thus the dacite and rhyolite volcanic rocks that underlie the andesite  volcanic rocks are 
exposed adjacent to the intrusive complex. Intrusive units comprise approximately 55-60% of the 
deposit, breccias approximately 30-35% and pre-mineral volcanic rocks about 5-10%.  

The deposit is capped by a leached zone with a variable thickness ranging from 0 to 120 m thick 
where copper mineralization has been leached out.

The seven major rock units that host the majority of copper mineralization in Cañariaco Norte are 
defined in Table 6.1. 

Table 6.1: Description of Major Rock Units (from Youngest to Oldest) 

Rock Unit Rock Type Description 

IBxP Breccia (youngest) Polymitic breccia 

TBx Breccia (middle) Tourmaline breccia 

IBxH Breccia (oldest) Hydrothermal breccia 

CQP Intrusive (youngest) Coarse quartz porphyry 

BFP Intrusive (middle) Biotite feldspar porphyry 

CQFP Intrusive (oldest) Crowded quartz feldspar porphyry 

VC Calipuy Volcanic  Pre-mineral andesite, dacite and rhyolite volcanics 

6.3 Cañariaco Norte Legend 

The pre-mineral Calipuy Volcanic (VC) host rock sequence exposed and drilled at Cañariaco 
Norte includes a base sequence of dacite tuffs with lesser bedded ryholite tuffs overlain by 
andesite porphyry flows and pyroclastics.  

The three main intrusive phases identified to date are, from oldest to youngest, crowded quartz 
feldspar porphyry (CQFP), biotite feldspar porphyry (BFP) and coarse quartz porphyry (CQP). In 
unaltered form the CQP unit has the most silica grains with 5-10% quartz eyes, 15-20% euhedral 
feldspar crystals and with trace biotite, and is interpreted to be quartz monzonite in composition 
and is the hardest unit. BFP is comprised of 3-5% quartz eyes, 15-20% feldspar phenocrysts, 
2-5% euhederal biotite (5 mm) and with trace hornblende and is interpreted to be granodiorite in 
composition. CQFP has 1-3% quartz eyes, 35% feldspar phenocrysts, 3-5% hornblende/biotite 
and is interpreted as diorite in composition. No major element whole rock chemistry has been 
done on unaltered lithologic units. 

The breccia bodies that post date the intrusive phases mentioned above are classified into three 
main types. From oldest to youngest they are the hydrothermal breccia (IBxH), tourmaline 
breccia (TBx) and polymictic breccia (IBxP). The 3 breccias units, composed primarily of 
fragments from the three intrusive units, are matrix supported and hydrothermal in nature.  

The IBxH unit is comprised of mainly mineralized BFP and CQFP fragments that have had little 
to no transport and thus are angular to sub-angular. The matrix of IBxH did not carry significant 
copper mineralization and the grade is mainly from the mineralized fragments. Near the margins 
it occurs as a crackle breccia grading inward to matrix supported. 

The TBx unit is an extensive breccia body that was emplaced along the northeastern margin of 
the intrusive bodies. TBx has a fine grained matrix with fragments of BFP, CQFP and IBXxH.

PEA Technical Report Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 44 

GED/HA 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM November 30, 2008 

  

The matrix does not carry any copper grade and is made up of fine grained quartz and tourmaline. 
Copper mineralization is limited to the fragments of mineralized rock within the breccia. 

The IBxP is classified as a late stage breccia. The IBxP unit carries significant copper grade and 
was the most volatile of the breccias. Sub-rounded to rounded fragments include VC, CQFP, 
BFP, CQP and IBxH and are matrix supported. Within this unit there are multiple breccia pulses 
the last of which is a fluidized micro breccia with rounded fragments < 3 mm crosscutting all 
other pulses. The IBxP body tends to be more erratic in shape and many crosscutting breccia 
dykes cut the intrusives and pre-existing breccias along northeast structures. Copper 
mineralization occurs in both the matrix and the fragments. 

Feldspar porphyry dykes/breccias (FP), post-intrusive and pre-breccia, are a minor component 
that range in true thickness between 2 and 30 m. The dykes have a fine grained groundmass with 
10 to 20% phenocrysts of feldspar (3 to 10 mm) and 5 to 10% hornblende (2 to 8 mm). The dykes 
are intact within the intrusive phases and generally strike northwest-southeast with a steep 
southwest dip. This general trend continues into the breccia bodies where the dykes occur as large 
(>10 m) rotated and weakly fractured blocks within the breccias. Copper mineralization only 
occurs in the brecciated parts of the dyke. 

6.3.1 Cañariaco Norte Structure 

The Cañariaco property is bisected by a northwest-southeast trending, district-scale fault. A 
second parallel fault occurs approximately 7 km to the northeast of the Cañariaco property. Both 
faults can be traced for kilometres; they are likely reactivated faults that have inherited their 
length from underlying basement structures. A series of smaller scale sub-parallel 
northwest-southeast faults occur locally within the mineralized area. A conjugate set of 
north-northeast trending, medium-range faults transect the project area and form escarpments and 
stepped terrain. 

The northwest-southeast and the northeast-southwest trending fault sets appear to control the 
emplacement of the intrusives phases at Cañariaco Norte as well as copper mineralization and 
alteration. In addition, these faults form minor structural corridors for late-stage breccias and 
associated high-sulphidation alteration and mineralization. The smaller set of northwest-southeast 
faults control dyke emplacement. 

The Quebrada Norte valley occupies an east-west structure controlling the emplacement of two of 
the breccias (IBxH and IBxP) at Cañariaco Norte. It is interpreted as an expansion structure 
between the main northwest-southeast faults as it is truncated at these faults.

6.3.2 Cañariaco Norte Alteration 
All lithologic units have been variably modified by the mineralizing processes which involved 
fracturing, brecciation and the introduction of alteration including phyllic, argillic, potassic and 
locally propyllitic, silicic and advanced argyllic, and copper mineralization, pyrite and locally 
magnetite, tourmaline and molybdenite. Alteration occurred as a series of four events. Initially 
potassic surrounded by propylitic, and locally silicic, followed by phyllic which overprinted 
potassic and locally propylitic and silicic, and then argillic overprinting phyllic and locally 
potassic, propylitic and silicic. The final alteration event was advanced argillic.  

Potassic alteration comprises variable proportions of secondary potassic feldspar and biotite, 
chlorite and magnetite. Propylitic alteration comprises illite, chlorite, epidote and smectite. 
Phyllic alteration comprises sericite and quartz with quartz vein stockwork (0.5 to 1.5 cm thick). 
Argillic alteration comprises kaolinite and illite and advanced argillic alteration comprises 
alunite, kaolinite, pyrophylite and dickite. Silicic alteration comprises very fine grained pervasive 
silica.  

Alteration intensity is directly related to the intensity of fracturing in the hosting lithologies. 
Fracturing, brecciation, argillic and phyllic alteration weakened/softened affected rocks, but 
potassic, silicic and propylitic alterations strengthened/hardened rocks. Phyllic and argillic 
alterations dominate in the upper parts of the southern half of the deposit and the upper 100 m of 
the northern half of the deposit (excluding overburden and leach cap). Most of the northern half 
of the deposit at depths under the 100 m thick layer of phyllic and argyllic alteration is dominated 
by potassic alteration. Potassic alteration dominates below 200 m depths (excluding overburden 
and leachcap) beneath the phyllic and argillic alterations in the southern half of the deposit. 
Silicic and propylitic alteration occur mainly near the margin, but also locally within the deposit. 
Advanced argillic alteration is primarily associated with the IBxP unit, but also has locally altered 
the bordering CQP unit, especially on its east margin. 

6.4 Cañariaco Sur Geology 

Wilson (1999) described Cañariaco Sur, located 1.3 km southwest of Cañariaco Norte, as Calipuy 
Group volcanic rocks intruded by diorite to quartz monzonite porphyry stocks. The quartz 
monzonite stock appears to be the oldest and largest in size (measuring about 750 m by 500 m, 
whereas the diorite stocks that intrude the quartz monzonite stock measure about 100 m by 50 m). 
However, Sillitoe (1999) observed three porphyry intrusives in drillcore at the Cañariaco Sur 
prospect.

6.5 Quebrada Verde Geology 

The Quebrada Verde prospect, located 3.2 km southwest of Cañariaco has been described as a 
diorite porphyry stock measuring approximately 1 km by 750 m that intruded the Calipuy Group 
volcanic rocks (Wilson, 1999). A satellite stock of the same diorite porphyry measuring 400 m by 
400 m is located 200 m to the northeast. An east-west striking, post-mineralization granodiorite 
dike, measuring 1 km by 100 m, intruded the volcanic rocks and the larger diorite porphyry stock. 
Mapping by Billiton geologists indicates that the geology of this area is similar to the geology 
found at Cañariaco Norte and Cañariaco Sur (Wilson, 1999).

7 Deposit Type 
This section of the report is taken from Minefill's April 26, 2007 report titled "Updated Technical 
Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Cañariaco Norte Porphyry Copper Project 
– Starter Pit Option, Department of Lambayeque, Peru" and revised based on current 
information. 

Cañariaco Norte is a porphyry copper-gold-(molybdenum) type deposit, of the type described by 
Titley and Beane (1981): they represent intrusion-related hydrothermal systems that resulted from 
the emplacement of small plutons, generally 0.5 km to 2 km in diameter, at shallow depths. 

Subsequent cooling resulted in extensive fracturing in both the host intrusion and country rocks, 
which allowed the hydrothermal system to circulate solutions throughout the volcanic pile, 
thereby forming alteration and metalliferous zones over large areas. 

Porphyry copper deposits are generally associated with hydrous magmas that intrude to high 
crustal levels where they begin to crystallize (Tosdal and Richards, 2001). Cupolas form above 
the magma chamber and act as traps for hydrous fluids containing incompatible elements that are 
eventually released in association with porphyry dike/stock intrusions. Brecciation occurs when 
hydrostatic pressure overcomes lithostatic pressure. Due to their large sizes and bulk metal 
content, both junior and major companies explore for porphyry-type deposits worldwide. There is 
abundant published information and the deposits are well understood with respect to geological 
settings and petrology. For example, Hunt (1991, p203) states: 

"From an explorationist's point of view, porphyry copper magmas and their affiliated 
hydrothermal ore solutions have produced some of the largest and most profitable high-grade 
copper orebodies which have yet been worked. The development of more general and more 
universally applicable concepts for the origin of ore-producing magmas and hydrothermal 
solutions, together with accurate tectonic and structural controls on ore deposition, will improve 
the exploration geologist's understanding as to why the richest and most profitable ores were 
associated with certain porphyry copper districts and not with others". 

Titley and Beane (1981) state that from 1955 to 1981, over 90 copper porphyry deposits were 
discovered in the Pacific Rim, either by geological reassessment of prospective areas or by 
grassroots exploration methods. They further calculated that from 141 deposits along the 
Pacific Rim, the mined and known reserves together contain over 89,946 x 106 short tons of 
copper ore with an average copper grade of 0.64% Cu. Of the 141 deposits, 51 contain significant 
molybdenum reserves averaging 0.029% Mo. Since 1981, there have been several new 
discoveries along the Pacific Rim; during the 1990s junior and major mining companies 
re-evaluated many of the known deposits.

8 Mineralization 

8.1 Cañariaco Norte Mineralization 

Copper mineralization occurs within all of the seven major rock types making up the 
Cañariaco Norte deposit but varies in average grade within each rock unit. In general, the highest 
copper grades (>0.5%) occur in the BFP and IBxP units. Intermediate copper grades 
(0.35% - 0.5% Cu) are most common in the IBxH and the CQP and the lowest grades 
(0.2%-0.35% Cu) dominate in the CQFP, TBx and VC host rocks. The unaltered FP dykes do not 
contain copper grade unless they occur as blocks and fragments within breccia units where they 
have been fractured and weakly mineralized (0.1% - 0.2% Cu). 

Most of the copper mineralization is concentrated in the intrusive and breccia units with the 
enclosing volcanic units a much less favourable host rock. Locally, however, copper in significant 
grades (>0.3% Cu) extends into the andesite volcanics along the northern and western margins of 
the deposit. 

Copper mineralization was introduced in a series of events commencing initially with 
chalcopyrite (bornite), followed by chalcocite and covellite and lastly enargite (tennentite). 
Pyrite was introduced with chalcopyrite and enargite, and to a much lesser extent with chalcocite 
and covellite. Copper minerals and pyrite are disseminated, veined and fracture-hosted with 
copper grades directly related to the intensity of fracturing and type/intensity of alteration. Copper 
distribution is about equally split between veins/fractures and disseminations. However, much of 
the disseminated copper might in actuality lie along "invisible" hairline fractures (re-healed by 
mineralizing process) rather than being truly disseminated. Chalcopyrite (bornite) grains are 
commonly closely associated and often connected with pyrite grains. Chalcocite, and locally 
abundant covellite, are commonly found together, often intermixed and appear mainly as coating 
on disseminated pyrite grains as a thin patina and/or partially to totally replacing chalcopyrite 
(bornite) grains on the margins of pyrite grains.  

Isotope work has shown that chalcocite (covellite) is largely hypogene in origin with very little 
supergene (R. Mathur, 2008). There may be isolated, small pods of supergene chalcocite 
(covellite) developed immediately under the leach cap, but the current thinking is that supergene 
chalcocite (covellite) is being eroded away as quickly as it forms as the water table is at or near 
present surface and erosion in the area is very active.  

Better grade copper mineralization is associated with potassic, phyllic and argillic alteration and 
less commonly with propylitic and silicic alteration. Typically chalcopyrite (bornite) dominates 
with potassic, silicic and propylitic alteration and chalcocite (covellite) dominates with phyllic 
and argillic alteration, although chalcopyrite-rich zones are still common in these latter 
alterations.

PEA Technical Report Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 52 

GED/HA 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM November 30, 2008 

  

Chalcopyrite (bornite) was deposited initially with potassic and propylitic alteration. As the 
system evolved chalcocite (covellite) with phyllic-argillic alteration developed and overprinted 
and replaced chalcopyrite and potassic alteration in the central and upper parts of the deposit.  

Enargite (tennentite) with advanced argillic alteration was the last to form and is generally 
restricted in its distribution to the IBxP unit and locally within the adjacent CQP unit where it 
occurs as veins and fracture coatings cutting earlier formed chalcocite (covellite), phyllic and 
argillic alteration. 

Copper mineralization is observed in the andesite flows and pyroclastics along the north, west 
and south margins of the intrusive complex dominantly as chalcopyrite (bornite) forming fracture 
coating and in quartz veins. The dacite and rhyolite flows and pyroclastics to the east of the 
intrusive complex do not have significant copper mineralization. 

Pyrite is common with all alteration types, averaging about 5% throughout the deposit as 
disseminations, veins and fracture coatings. Drill logs are not reliable enough to accurately 
quantify or define areas which might have higher pyrite concentrations    

Magnetite is less common and primarily associated with chalcopyrite (bornite) in potassic 
alteration. Tourmaline is restricted to the matrix of the TBx unit. Enargite (tennentite) is restricted 
to areas of advanced argillic alteration occurring mainly within the IBxP unit and CQP unit.  

Gold and silver occur in low concentrations throughout the deposit. Increased gold concentrations 
correlate with higher copper grades. Gold averages 0.04 to 0.11 g/t and silver averages 1.3 to 
2.5 ppm throughout the different rock types in the deposit. Fire assays for gold and multi element 
ICP analysis has been completed and the results were modelled by SRK for addition to the 
resource estimate. 

Molybdenite (Mo) is very low grade, averaging <40 ppm and is slightly higher on the margins 
and at depth in the deposit.  

8.2 Cañariaco Sur Mineralization 

Sillitoe (1999) summarized the Cañariaco Sur prospect as a porphyry copper center dominated by 
potassic alteration with co-extensive copper-gold (molybdenite) mineralization. The 
mineralization is hosted by similar porphyry rocks to those found at Cañariaco Norte. 
A coincident copper-gold-molybdenite geochemical anomaly from soil geochemistry measures 
800 m by 1,200 m. Billiton drilled three holes into this porphyry in 1999 and interstected 
potassically altered quartz monzonite. Candente drilled two holes into this same porphyry in 
2008. Results from the first hole (CS08-001) in the Cañariaco Sur porphyry intersected average 
grades of 0.35% copper, 0.15 g/t and 1.43 g/t silver from 180 to 535 m depth. Within this 354 m 
length, drilling intersected 0.41% copper, 0.17 g/t gold and 1.59 g/t silver from 300 to 400 m 
depth.

8.3 Quebrada Verde Mineralization 

The Quebrada Verde prospect appears to be a satellite porphyry copper center. Structurally 
localized argyllic sericitic alteration is highly pyritic, and has low hypogene copper grades. 
The mineralized area appears centered on a coincident but diffuse copper-gold soil anomaly.  

The soil anomaly has a well-defined central gold zone that grades 200 ppb to 400 ppb Au. 
Diamond drillhole QV-2 was drilled to test argillic alteration, 200 m to the west-southwest of the 
soil anomaly. The drillhole encountered strong pyrite mineralization (Sillitoe, 1999), which is 
consistent with the observation that it was located outside of the main center of mineralization, 
thereby suggesting that the anomaly proper has not been tested. 

Soil and drillcore assay data suggest concentric zonation of the mineralization, with a wide 
copper ring hosting elevated gold values along the inner edge and elevated molybdenum values 
around the outer edge. This zonation is consistent with porphyry deposits, which contain 
higher-grade copper mineralization in potassic altered rocks. Gold grades tend to be highest 
toward the potassic core, whereas molybdenum grades pick up and copper grades subside where 
phyllic alteration begins (Currie, 2004).

9 Exploration 
This section of the report is taken from Minefill's April 26, 2007 report titled "Updated Technical 
Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Cañariaco Norte Porphyry Copper Project 
– Starter Pit Option, Department of Lambayeque, Peru" and revised based on current 
information. 

9.1 Primary Target 

Three porphyry zones have been identified on the Cañariaco property: Cañariaco Norte, 
Cañariaco Sur (located approximately 750 m south-southwest of Cañariaco Norte) and Quebrada 
Verde (located 1.5 km to the southwest of Cañariaco Sur). Only the Cañariaco Norte zone has 
been the subject of substantial exploration work and only the Cañariaco Norte zone is considered 
in detail in this report. 

9.2 Exploration Summary to December 2006 

Exploration across the Cañariaco property has been conducted over four main periods: 1970 to 
1974 by INGEMMET; 1994 to 1996 by Placer Dome; 1998 to 1999 by Billiton; and 2004 to 2006 
by Candente. The historic exploration work is of significance and influenced the design of the 
2007 – 2008 drilling program which is described in detail in Section 10.1. 

9.2.1 Geological Mapping and Surface Geochemistry 

The Cañariaco Norte, Cañariaco Sur and Quebrada Verde zones have been mapped and sampled 
in detail by the various operators, including recent work by Candente. Mapping at Cañariaco 
Norte has been facilitated by an extensive trenching program by Placer Dome that exposed 
weathered outcrop in the densely forested areas where mapping had not existed before. Candente 
re-mapped the trenches and creek draws as well as outcrops at higher elevations in 2004. 
New drill platforms also exposed weathered outcrop and added geological information to the 
surface geological map.  

At Cañariaco Norte, surface chip sampling was carried out by Placer Dome within the trenches. 
However, copper grades were non representative as the samples were from leached out rock. 
Several copper anomalies do exist at creek level where non-leached rock exposures exist. Rock 
chip samples from outcrop returned up to 0.77% copper. Candente only conducted minor surface 
rock sampling programs as most rock exposures have had the copper mineralization leached out. 
Samples within creek beds confirm high copper grades encountered by Placer Dome. A total of 
148 rock samples were collected by Candente from surface for gold, total copper and 35-element 
ICP analyses.

Soil geochemistry lines completed at Cañariaco Sur and Quebrada Verde by Billiton outlined 
coincident copper, gold and molybdenum anomalies over a 750 m diameter area with smaller 
anomalies of copper and gold adjacent to it. Line spacing was typically 200 m with 100 m infill 
where initial results were favourable. Sample spacing was 50 m along the lines. Billiton drilled 
three holes to test geochemical anomalies at Cañariaco Sur and one at Quebrada Verde. No soil 
geochemistry was completed at Cañariaco Norte. 

9.2.2 Geophysical Surveys 

IP and ground magnetic surveys have been undertaken on all three zones. The Billiton results at 
Cañariaco Norté were inconclusive because the line spacing was too broad. Candente carried out 
further ground magnetic surveys at Cañariaco Norte, which assisted in outlining areas of 
magnetite destruction and addition, thus delineating the various alteration zones and helping to 
confirm and/or identify old/new fault structures.  

The IP/resistivity survey at Cañariaco Sur and Quebrada Verde helped with zone definition, while 
the ground magnetic survey identified zones of potassic alteration (Currie, 2004). Coincident 
magnetic highs and IP chargeability highs exist with elevated copper, gold and molybdenum 
values from soil geochemistry as described above.  

9.3 Exploration During 2007 and 2008 

The focus of exploration work in 2007 and 2008 outside of delineation and infill drilling was to 
map the Cañariaco Norte mineralized zone in sufficient detail to aid in the completion of an 
accurate geological model. In addition, geotechnical mapping of all the trenches was completed 
and added to the drillhole geotechnical database. 

Geological mapping, soil geochemistry, geophysics (ground magnetics and induced 
polarization/resistivity surveys) and diamond drilling were completed at the Cañariaco Sur and 
Quebrada Verde porphyry copper-gold exploration targets. The two diamond drillholes 
completed at Cañariaco Sur intersected copper mineralization within a diorite intrusive.

10 Drilling 
To the end of drilling for the resource estimate in March 2008 a total of 229 diamond drillholes 
(63,849 m) were drilled across the Cañariaco Norte deposit, including all drillholes completed by 
INGEMMET, Placer Dome, Billiton and Candente. Of these holes, data from 213 holes 
(60,580 m) were used for the SRK resource estimate. The remaining 16 drillholes (3,269 m) were 
drilled for metallurgical sampling and hydrogeology. Subsequent to the resource estimate drilling, 
an additional 29 drillholes (10,223 m) were completed in 2008 for metallurgical sampling, 
geotechnical testing and deep resource delineation. Table 10.1 summarizes drilling to end March 
2008 that was included in the SRK 2008 resource estimate as well as post resource drilling in 
2008. 

In 1999, Billiton also drilled three holes (473 m) in the Cañariaco Sur porphyry and one drillhole 
(100 m) in the Quebrada Verde zone. In 2008 Candente completed two drillholes (1,041 m) into 
the Cañariaco Sur porphyry. Candente has been drilling at Cañariaco Norte since 2004. All 
drilling at Cañariaco Norte has been diamond core drilling. 

The previous resource estimate (Minefill 2007) was based on 91 drillholes (28,328 m) drilled to 
the end of 2006. This included 82 drillholes (26,019 m) completed by Candente as well as 
composite core samples of 9 (2,310 m) of the original 11 historic drillholes. SRK used the 
original results from all 11 historic drillholes (2,911 m) in the May 2008 resource estimate.

10.1 Summary of Drilling at Cañariaco Norte 

Significant drillhole intersections from the INGEMMET, Placer Dome, Billiton, Candente 2004, 
2005 and 2006 drilling programs can be found in Section 13 of the 2007 Minefill report.  

10.1.1 INGEMMET 

The first drilling program was undertaken by INGEMMET from January to March, 1973. 
The drilling contractor was Craelius Tarratest Peruana S.A., who utilized three Longyear 
machines (two model 34s and one model 38; Flores et al., 1973). Average core recovery was 
reported as 93%. NCD drilling was carried out to 50 m, thereafter NXWL (60.7 mm) diameter 
core was drilled to 170 m and BXWL (48.4 mm) diameter core for the remainder of the drilled 
depth. Both five and ten foot core barrels were used (Flores et al., 1973). Five vertical diamond 
drillholes, each to 300 m in length for a total of 1,500 m, were drilled into the Cañariaco Norte 
zone. The core was logged noting lithology, alteration mineralization and intensity of fracturing. 
A total of 579 core samples were collected along 1.5 m or 3.0 m lengths (depending on the 
diameter of core) and then analyzed for copper and molybdenum. A total of 66 composite 
geological samples were analyzed for total copper, molybdenum, silver and gold. Analyses were 
carried out by Plenge Laboratory in Lima and INGEMMET's own laboratory (Currie, 2004). 

10.1.2 Placer Dome 

The second drilling program at Cañariaco Norte was undertaken in 1995 by Placer Dome. This 
consisted of three angled diamond holes (drillholes S-6 to S-8, or 95-006 to 95-008 in the updated 
drillhole database) totaling 854 m into the Cañariaco Norte zone. Placer Dome did not test other 
anomalies on the Cañariaco property (Currie, 2004). 

10.1.3 Billiton 

The third drilling program at Cañariaco Norte was undertaken during 1999 by Billiton. 
Three holes were completed, totaling 555.7 m (drillholes CN-1 to CN-3, or 99-001 to 99-003 in 
the updated drillhole database). BQ diameter (36.5 mm) drillcore was retrieved.  

10.1.4 Candente 

Candente 2004 Drilling 

In late 2004, Candente undertook initial drilling for the company with a 12 drillhole program 
(2,647 m). Core diameter was NTW (56 mm) diameter. The contractor was Pac Rim Drilling SA, 
a Peruvian subsidiary of Kluane Drilling Corp. One standard man-portable Hydrocore rig was 
used.

The holes were drilled on a 100 m grid spacing centred on INGEMMET drillhole S-1 (C73-001). 
The first Candente drillhole (C04-001) was drilled as a twin of the INGEMMET drillhole as due 
diligence and to obtain a sample for total and sequential copper grades (INGEMMET only 
analyzed for total copper). The 2004 drill program tested the continuity of copper mineralization 
and provided sufficient information for Candente to have an independent mineral resource 
estimate prepared by McCrea (2005).  

All holes were drilled vertically. Down hole surveys were made with a Pajari analog survey tool 
with a timed locking compass and inclinometer. Readings were taken at the drill machine to 
confirm true vertical holes. Any spurious readings were discarded and a second survey was done 
at the same depth. 

Copper grades in the mineralized zones in the twelve holes contained intervals such as 0.7% Cu 
over an average length width of 151 m, with individual intersections ranging from 0.45%/137 m, 
0.71%/234 m, 0.85%/205 m and 1.01%/96 m. All of the 12 holes terminated in copper 
mineralization, grading from 0.54% to 1.00% Cu. These figures do not include three lesser-
mineralized zones, which intersected late-mineral rock units. 

Candente 2005 Drilling 

Candente completed two drilling programs in 2005 (Phases I and II), with the purpose of 
expanding the known area of mineralization at Cañariaco Norte, to the south of the 2004 drilling 
grid, and increasing the area of the Inferred resource estimate. The first program was from June to 
August and the second from October to November, for a total of 24 holes (7388 m). All but two 
of the holes yielded NTW diameter core (56 mm); ground conditions and depth required a 
reduction to a BTW core diameter (42 mm) in drillholes 05-014 at 302.35 m and 05-019 at 
268 m). The contractor was Pac Rim Drilling S.A. 

Of the 24 holes Candente drilled in 2005: 

• 18 were drilled on a grid spacing of 150 m, starting 150 m south of the 2004 drill grid: 
− 17 of which were drilled vertically to a planned depth of 350 m; 
− Drillhole 05-022 was drilled at an angle of -75° to the northwest so as not to drill 

down a sub-vertical FP dike); 
− Drillhole 05-014 was drilled to 501 m to test the depth of potassic alteration and 

copper mineralization. 

• Two additional holes were drilled within the area of the 150 m grid to test for structure. 
− Drillhole 05-019 (-45° dip, 045° azimuth) tested the orientation of the FP dikes; 
− Drillhole 05-032 (-45° dip, 000° azimuth) tested the IBx orientation within the 

CQFP.

• Four vertical holes were drilled as exploration holes to test the edges of the mineralization; 
− Drillhole 05-031 was drilled to the east of the 2005 grid pattern to test for potential 

mineralization within the dacite tuff host rock; 
− Three holes were drilled northwest of the 2004 drilling to test copper showings and 

alteration in the andesite porphyry volcanic host rock (and in so doing encountered 
local sills of mineralized CQFP). 

Down hole surveys were made with a Pajari analog survey instrument. Readings were taken at the 
drill machine before resetting the instrument. Any spurious readings were discarded and a second 
survey was done at the same depth. A number of holes do not have down hole survey data due to 
a malfunction in the instrument. 

Candente 2006 Drilling 

Drilling in 2006 continued from May to December, with the addition of a second, more powerful, 
man portable, Hydrocore drill from Pac Rim Drilling S.A. in September. A total of 46 drillholes 
totaling 15,984 m were drilled. Generally, all holes less than 325 m in depth were drilled with 
NTW diameter core (56 mm); holes deeper than 325 m needed to be reduced to BTW diameter 
core (42 mm), at around 250 m to 300 m depth, to allow the machine to drill to the planned 
depths.  

Of the 46 holes drilled in 2006: 

• 28 were drilled on the expansion of the planned 100 m grid pattern to the north, east and west 
(the planned depth of the grid expansion holes was 350 m); 

• 18 were drilled as infill holes within the squares of the existing 100 m grid to yield a 
hole-to-hole spacing of less than 75 m. All the grid expansion and infill holes were drilled 
vertically, except for nine drillholes (drillholes 06-045 to 06-053, inclusive) that doubled as 
geotechnical holes and one drillhole (drillhole 06-041) that was inclined at -75° to avoid the 
possibility of drilling down a sub-vertical FP dike. Of the 41 geological grid expansion and 
infill holes, 10 were drilled with the new machine to depths greater than 480 m to test the 
depth extension of the copper mineralization. The deepest of these holes (06-069) was drilled 
to 594 m. All the holes were downhole surveyed with a Sperry Sun single shot downhole 
survey tool supplied by the drilling company.  

A total of nine holes drilled in 2006, were orientated for geotechnical purposes using an 
A.C.E. core orienting instrument. Four of the geotechnical holes (drillholes 06-045, 06-046, 06-
047 and 06-048) formed part of the grid expansion drilling program; they were located along the 
edges of the known mineralized area.

An additional five geotechnical holes (drillholes 06-049 to 06-053, inclusive) were drilled at 
inclinations of -45° to -55°, at azimuths of 045° or 225°, to test the orientation of the FP dikes 
within the central area of the known mineralization. The 2006 drilling results defined the 
southwest and eastern boundaries of the copper mineralization.  

Copper mineralization continued to the north, where it is hosted in volcanic rocks; the 
mineralization remained open at depth and to both the northeast and south.  

Candente 2007 Drilling 

A total of 123 diamond drillholes (31,350.8 m) were completed during the 2007 resource 
development and exploration program at Cañariaco Norte. Drilling was continuous throughout 
the year and utilized three man-portable drill machines supplied by Pac Rim Drilling S.A.. Holes 
were classified by their main objectives including infill and delineation, metallurgical and 
hydrogeological/geotechnical drilling.  

The main focus of drilling in 2007 was infill and delineation drilling of the Cañariaco Norte 
resource. Resource infill and delineation drilling totaled 110 holes (28,966 m), all located within 
and adjacent to the existing grid drilling used for the 2007 Minefill resource estimate The primary 
objective of this drilling was to increase the drillhole density within the area of known 
mineralization and also to expand and delineate the boundaries of known mineralization both 
laterally and at depth by drilling beyond the influence of previously drilled holes. The focus of 
infill drilling was to bring near surface mineralization with potential for starter pit exploitation 
into the measured category. Most holes were drilled vertically, with the exception of those drilled 
to test the resource beneath creeks (Quebrada Norte and Oso), which were inclined at -50° to 
-80°. At the end of 2007, two holes were drilled at angles to confirm the position of geological 
contacts and grade continuity between vertical holes. 

As part of the resource delineation drilling, six deep holes (C07-129, C07-135, C07-141, 
C07-146, C07-159 and C07-183) were drilled past the bottom of known mineralization to depths 
of 634 m, 721 m, 767 m, 761 m, 718 m and 701 m respectively. Four of these deep holes were 
assayed for gold and multi element ICP at the time of drilling to gain preliminary geochemistry 
for the deeper parts of the resource. The deep holes were distributed within the central portion of 
the resource at approximately 225 m spacing. All holes ended in copper mineralization indicating 
the resource is open to depth.  

The first 8 holes (2,320 m) completed in 2007 prior to the release of the Minefill updated resource 
were classified as exploration and delineation holes, as optimum spacing for resource 
classification was not known at that time.

These drillholes were mainly located to the northeast of the known mineralization to follow up a 
northeast trending tongue of porphyry copper mineralization and delineate the extent of 
mineralization in that area. They are included in the total for resource infill and delineation 
drilling completed in 2007. 

Metallurgical drilling, completed early 2007, consisted of 12 drillholes (1,993 m). 
The metallurgical holes twinned existing holes, so that both grade and mineralization was known. 
The objective of this drilling was to obtain fresh samples from a range of lithologies for 
metallurgical test work. The last drillhole, completed in 2007 (hole C07-203 at 391.7 m length) 
was the initial drillhole of the second phase of the metallurgical sampling program. Metallurgical 
drillholes were logged and photographed and the entire core sample was shipped for processing.  

A number of the holes drilled in 2007 had dual purposes. A total of 28 of the infill and delineation 
holes had piezometer pipe installed and 12 of those holes had packer tests completed in them, as 
part of a hydrogeological data acquisition program overseen by Ground Water International. Two 
holes were drilled specifically for hydrogeological testing on the ridge to the west of the resource 
and did not encounter mineralization. All but the two hydrogeology specific holes drilled in 2007, 
were sampled top to bottom and assayed for total copper and sequential copper.  

Candente 2008 Drilling 

SRK designed a resource definition and confirmation drilling program that was completed by the 
end of March 2008. A total of 12 holes were completed (3,570 m) for inclusion in this updated 
resource estimate. All holes were inclined and designed to confirm interpreted contacts within the 
3D modeled geology. These holes were also designed to test grade continuity between vertical 
holes and to provide data to test for grade bias between vertical and inclined drilling. 

Drilling continued after the March cut-off for data to be used in the resource estimate until 
mid-September, 2008. The final hole drilled in mid-September was C08-244. The post-resource 
drilling included geotechnical drilling, metallurgical sample procurement drilling, and deep 
delineation drilling. A total of 28 holes (10,223 m) of drilling was completed post resource 
estimate (Drillholes C08-217 to C08-244). Only the metallurgical sample drillholes have 
relevance to this report. 

All holes of the 2008 SRK program were oriented and drilled with HQ or NQ triple tube core 
barrels, in order to better preserve core for geotechnical data collection. As in 2006, core was 
oriented using the A.C.E. tool. Supervision and training in geotechnical data acquisition was 
conducted by SRK.

Holes drilled in 2007 were down hole surveyed for dip and azimuth with a Sperry Sun single shot 
survey instrument. Photos of readings are archived for review. Holes drilled in 2008 were down 
hole surveyed for dip and azimuth with a Reflex EZ-Shot digital down-hole survey tool. Due to 
the collection of detailed geotechnical data in the 2008 SRK drilling, tighter control of down-hole 
orientation was needed so survey readings were taken every 50 m. 

10.1.5 Drilling Results 2007 and 2008 

The infill and delineation drilling completed subsequent to the last resource estimate confirmed 
the mineralization and grades reported to the end of 2006. Closer drill spacing and a number of 
inclined drillholes allowed for more detailed and confident geological modeling. 

Six deep holes drilled in 2007 confirmed the deposit remains open to depth as mineralization was 
encountered at the bottom of all 6 drillholes to depths up to 767 m. 

10.2 Collar Coordinate Surveys 

Drillhole location was established by the contract surveyor using a Sokkia total station. The list of 
proposed drillhole UTM coordinates was sent to the surveyor who established their location in the 
field. Once located by the surveyor the drill platform was built and the drillhole completed. 
Upon completion of the drillhole, the final collar location was surveyed again. Handheld GPS 
was used by Candente geologists to verify drillhole locations both prior to and after the 
completion of drilling. 

10.2.1 Survey Control 

Servicios Geográficos y Medio Ambiente S.A.C. (GEMA) was contracted in 2004 to establish the 
coordinates of four survey control points for site survey work. All survey data was based from 
these control points. The points were established by differential GPS set on the point for 1 hour 
and using the "1" order base station in Lima. Accuracy of these initial control points is not 
known. UTM coordinates were reported in PSAD 56. 

In June 2006, GEMA was contracted to re-establish five high precision survey control points to 
be used at the project as the base points for all surveying. Monuments were re-built using rebar 
and concrete to permanently secure their position. GEMA re-established the points with a 
differential GPS set on the point for 3 hours and using the "0" order station "Piura" as base. 
Accuracy was established at ±1 mm.

Reference point UTM data was reported in WGS-84 which is the main datum used in Peru for 
surveying. The calculated PSAD-56 UTM data was also reported. 

In June 2006 the entire project datum was changed over from PSAD-56 (zone 17) to WGS-84 
(zone 17). All survey work on the project prior to the re-establishment of the control points and 
the datum switch was re-done. The project grid corresponds to the WGS-84 (zone 17) UTM grid.

11 Sampling Method and Approach 
Throughout the exploration history of the Cañariaco Norte project, there have been several 
campaigns of outcrop sampling both along stream sections and in man-made trenches. This 
sampling is regarded mostly as an exploration targeting exercise and has proved of little value in 
the determination of in-situ deposit grade, due to strong leaching of the upper subsurface rocks. 
However, these sampling campaigns have contributed to the construction of geological maps of 
the deposit, and in the understanding of the relationships between the various igneous intrusions 
and hydrothermal breccia bodies. 

11.1 INGEMMET 

INGEMMET conducted sampling of soils, rock chips and stream sediments within the 
Cañariaco Norte area as part of a regional prospecting in the north of Peru over the period of 
1969-1971 (Flores, 1971). Samples were analyzed for both copper and molybdenum. 

Drill core from INGEMMET's 1973 campaign (5 holes) were split in half, with one half core 
being sent for assay of copper, molybdenum, silver and gold. No further information exists on the 
sampling method (Currie, 2004; quoted in Minefill, 2006). 

11.2 Placer Dome 

Primarily due to the lack of natural outcrop within the Cañariaco area, Placer Dome cut 2,200 m 
of trenches over the period 1994 to 1997. A collection of 715 rock samples were sampled from 
the Cañariaco concessions, predominantly from the vicinity of the Cañariaco Norte area. These 
were analyzed for Au, Cu, Mo and some for Ag and As. 

Sampling of Placer Dome's drill program was not well documented. However, it is known that 
their drill cores were split, with one half being sent for analysis, whilst the second half remained 
on site at the Cañariaco property (Currie, 2004; quoted in Minefill, 2006).

11.3 Billiton 

Sampling method and approach for the Billiton campaign is best described in the following 
excerpt of Wilson (1999, Appendix 7): 

"Placer Dome carried out semi-systematic mapping and sampling of outcrops in the trenches 
that it opened, and Billiton has carried out additional sampling of outcrops in the streams south 
of the drilled area (Quebrada Norte)." "The drill core will be sampled in two meter intervals and 
50% of the core will be sent for sample preparation. Field samples will contain one core size only 
i.e., no samples must straddle a core size change (e.g., HQ to NQ). A minimum sample length of 
50 cm will be adhered to in order to ensure sufficient sample weight at all times". 

11.4 Candente 

The following sections describe the procedures and protocols of the Candente campaign at the 
time of QP Bonson's site visit (November 2007). 

11.4.1 Core Handling 

As core is retrieved it is placed into wooden boxes divided into three core spaces, each 1 m in 
length. Candente staff measure the core lengths and calculate recovery and RQD at the drill site. 
Depth blocks are labeled to two decimal places and nailed into position in the core boxes. Each 
core box leaving the drill site is labelled with its drillhole identification number and its box 
number clearly marked. 

Re-usable wooden lids are used to close the timber core boxes before transportation. The lids are 
securely fastened as each core box is filled. Core boxes containing core are carried from the drill 
site to the core layout area at camp on the shoulders of porters. Although care is taken in the 
lifting and transport of the boxes, the core inevitably endures some tipping and shaking during its 
transport across the rugged terrain. 

On arrival at the core layout area, outside the main camp buildings, technicians arrange the core 
boxes in chronologic order on timber rails resting on the ground. Inventory is taken to assure all 
core has arrived from the drill site. Core box lids are then removed. 

Systematically working along the chronologically arranged core boxes, a geotechnical assistant 
marks core at one meter intervals on all core boxes. Subsequently, the drillhole number, box 
number, core interval and meterage markers are neatly painted on the core boxes.

11.4.2 Geotechnical Logging 

Initial geotechnical work at the Cañariaco Norte project was undertaken by Minefill Services Inc., 
who visited the site in June 2006 to conduct oriented core logging and training of Candente 
geologists in geotechnical core logging. Subsequently Minefill issued a 
"Preliminary Geotechnical Report" in May 2007, describing geotechnical core logging and 
mapping, rock strength testing, rock mass classification, hydrogeology and kinematic and limit 
equilibrium analyses (for pit walls).  

Following Minefill's visit, all drill cores (after drillhole C06-045) have been logged for standard 
geotechnical parameters. In addition, Candente has carried out geotechnical mapping of trench 
exposures (veins, joints and faults), and strength testing using a point load tester.  

SRK reviewed Candente's geotechnical database in November 2008 during a site visit. 
Geotechnical data collection protocols were revised and several additional parameters added for 
collection. All holes after C07-189 have been logged using the revised protocols. 

11.4.3 Core Logging 

During the detailed core mark-up, a project geologist performs a first-pass geological log of the 
core. This initial log identifies: lithological boundaries, major structures, leaching depth and 
broad mineralization intervals. In tandem with the logging, the geologist notes where major 
sample breaks should be placed at lithological boundaries. All other samples intervals are two 
metres and are routinely placed on the metre mark.

Figure 11.1: Core Mark-up Area with Core Lengths Being Measured 

A second phase of detailed core logging is carried out immediately after cutting on the preserved 
split core at Candente's core storage facility in Chiclayo, where each core is logged for lithology, 
structure, veining, alteration and mineralization. The lithology is logged as a from/to interval, 
with brief description of the interval. In addition, all descriptions are indexed to 2 m sample 
intervals, so that the mineralization, structure, lithology and alteration affecting any sample are 
known. Most logs are in Spanish. 

Geology: The geology column comprises a short description, major lithology code and grain 
size/texture assigned. 

Mineralization: Mineralization is recorded as the abundance of copper minerals (recorded as an 
intensity with a range of 1 to 5), pyrite, magnetite and iron oxides and hydroxides. 

Veins: Fields are present for vein intensity and vein types, but are seldom used. 

Alteration: Alteration type is indexed according to its intensity (trace, 1 to 5). Leaching is also 
noted in this field. 

Structure: Depth, type of structure (examples: contact, bedding, foliation, fracture, vein, shear, 
fault, etc.) and angle of dip relative to the core axis is recorded.

Sample: Each log sheet contains the sample number which can be referenced to a depth. 
Positions of standards, blanks and field duplicates are also recorded. 

11.4.4 Sampling 

After core box mark-up, and initial logging core boxes are taken to a designated cutting room 
where the core is cut in half using a circular rock saw. Water used to lubricate the saw is not 
subsequently re-circulated. Each core piece is halved and both halves are placed back into the 
core box. The core box is then taken to a sampling table where, for each sample interval, half of 
the core is placed into a plastic half-pipe. As much as possible, the sampled core is taken from the 
same half-split (consistent side). The half-core is broken at the limit of the sample interval with a 
hammer. The sample in the half-pipe is then placed into and sealed in double, clear polythene 
sample bags labelled on the outside with a sample number and containing a sample tag within the 
bags. A printed card sample tag, together with a piece of ribbon containing sample interval 
depths, are stapled to the side of the core box at the lower end of the sample interval. 

Samples are 2 m in length unless a geological contact is present within the sample interval. In 
which case, the sample interval is terminated at the contact. The subsequent sample interval 
terminates at the next meter depth mark that allows a 1.5 m minimum sample length. 

11.4.5 Insertion of Field Blanks, Duplicate Samples and Standard Reference 
Materials 

Field blanks, field duplicates and standard reference materials (standards) are included in the 
sample stream such that the minimum analytical batch size will always contain at least one of 
each quality control samples. Analytical batch sizes at Candente's principal laboratory, 
Activation Laboratories Ltd. ("Actlabs"), are 80 for copper analysis and 40 for gold fire assay 
analysis. Therefore, this ratio ensures that a minimum of one of each of the blanks, duplicates and 
standards are present within each batch analyzed. A total of 1,039 standards and 1,123 blank 
samples were inserted to support 28,000 samples. 

As Candente's sample numbers are continuous and consecutive, sample numbers (and therefore 
locations within the sample stream) are allocated for the insertion of duplicates, field blanks and 
standard reference materials prior to any sampling. These materials are inserted during the 
sampling process on site and arranged within sample stream prior to packing into rice sacks. The 
nature of these materials is described in Section 12.5. Although the various standard reference 
material samples had varying grades corresponding to the low, medium and high grades found at 
Cañariaco Norte their placement was random with each batch not containing two of the same 
standards.

Photography of Core 

Following core box mark-up, each core box containing whole core was photographed together 
with an adjacent box in an inclined rig. The core was then logged geologically, split and sampled 
and the remaining split core photographed a second time. Each photo contains the drillhole 
number and depth interval as well as sample tags for reference. 

Digital colour photographs were taken in good light, approximately perpendicular to the core 
boxes, allowing both core boxes to be photographed without shadows. The digital images were 
downloaded daily to an on-site computer. 

11.4.6 Shipment and Storage of Core 

Prior to the construction of an access road into camp, all core was stored on racks within secure 
storage facilities. In October 2007, all existing core was moved to a core storage facility located 
in Chiclayo, close to Candente's regional offices and thereafter core boxes were transported 
directly to the new core storage facility for detailed logging and permanent storage. Sampling 
completed in camp was shipped in separate trucks.  

Since the establishment of the storage facilities in Chiclayo core boxes are transported by pick-up 
from site to a locked metal shipping container adjacent to the camp's security post, high on the 
access road above the camp accessible by larger transport trucks.

A contracted transport company has a dedicated truck used for core transport. No cargo from 
other sources is mixed with Candente core or sample shipments. The large truck takes the core 
from the container directly to the Chiclayo storage facility as soon as there is a full load or 
approximately twice a week. 

The facility in Chiclayo is a walled compound, manned 24 hours per day. After detailed 
geological logging, the core is placed into purpose-built core racks under shelter within the 
compound. At the time of the visit a large amount of core was orderly stacked by drillhole 
number awaiting placement into racks as the core had just been moved down from the site. 
Subsequently, racks have been built and all core has been stored by drillhole number. 

11.4.7 Chain of Custody 

Candente has implemented a chain of custody enabling them to track all stages of a samples 
progress from site to analytical facility. This is initiated as the sample is taken, where technicians 
enter sample number and sample interval on to a sample sheet. After a batch of 80 samples, 
including field blanks, standards and core duplicates are assembled; they are placed in order, into 
consecutively numbered rice sacks. Sacks are sealed with a unique security tag, indexed by the 
sack number, and securely taped shut. Sack numbers are recorded in a log book, together with 
drillhole number; the numbers of the first and last samples contained within the rice sack; the 
total number of samples contained within the sack; an internal batch reference sack number. In 
addition, a note is made of the sample numbers assigned to any of the standards, blanks and 
duplicates. This log is signed by the senior technician responsible. 

Rice sacks which constitute a batch are stored on site in a locked building, prior to being 
transported to the camp security point by pick-up truck. Each batch being dispatched is logged in 
a log book with the following details recorded: shipment number; date dispatched; list of rice 
sack numbers; number of samples within each sack; first and last samples; total number of 
samples in the shipment. The shipment always consists of whole batches of 80 samples. The log 
book is then signed by the driver of the pick-up truck. The sacks are then loaded into a truck and 
transported to Candente's core facility.  

Samples are never transported with drill core from which they are derived. The driver of the truck 
signs a shipment control booklet on picking up the samples, which is then checked and signed-off 
by Candente staff on arrival at the core facility.

Samples are transported by road to Lima using TEPSA freight transport from Chiclayo. Freight is 
picked up by Candente staff at TEPSA's Lima depot and taken directly to Actlabs in Lima for 
analysis. Upon receipt of the samples, Actlabs were requested by Candente to check security seals 
and report any signs of tampering to the sacks. The sacks were then opened, the samples placed in 
order and each sample assigned an internal laboratory identification.  

Actlabs operate a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for tracking samples from 
receipt through all stages of sample preparation and analysis.

12 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

12.1 INGEMMET 

Data on the preparation, analysis and security of samples is not well-documented for the 
INGEMMET campaign. The extent of the knowledge is detailed by Minefill (2007), excerpted as 
follows: 

"Flores (1973) mentions use of the Plenge Laboratory in Lima and INGEMMET's own 
laboratory for assay. However: 

• It is not specified which samples were analyzed and where; but 

• All samples were assayed for copper and molybdenum, and sometimes gold and silver; and 

• The "frio de la dithizina-benceno" assay method (colorimetric analyses) was used. 

No other data is available (Currie, 2004)." 

12.2 Placer Dome 

The following is an excerpt from McCrea (2006): 

"No sample preparation data was available for review by the Author from the Placer Dome 
work, although it is known that samples were sent to the SGS-XRAL laboratory in Lima. 
However, from other exploration projects undertaken by Placer Dome during this timeframe that 
the Author is familiar with (in particular the Mulatos Gold Project, Mexico), it can be said that 
Placer Dome would have had detailed QA/QC programs in place at Cañariaco. These would 
have included the use of blanks, standards, and check assays (Currie, 2004)". 

12.3 Billiton 

Billiton's sample preparation, analysis and quality control for Cañariaco drill core are outlined in 
Appendix 7 of Wilson (1999), the principal elements of which are summarised below. 

12.3.1 Chain of Custody 

All samples (including blanks and standards) were sent to the ALS preparation lab in Trujillo 
using the TEPSA bus company in Chiclayo, accompanied by the completed ALS sample 
submittal form. A copy of the form was faxed to Billiton's Lima office. In addition, an Excel file 
was sent to the Lima office containing project name, drillhole ID, start/end of sample numbers, 
filed sample number (Wilson, 1999). 



SRK Consulting                              
PEA Technical Report Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 75 

GED/HA 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM November 30, 2008 

  

12.3.2 Insertion of Blanks, Standards and Duplicates 

Blanks and standards were each inserted at a ratio of 1 in 20 samples. It was Billiton's protocol 
that a blank sample was not to be submitted adjacent to a standard sample, but had to be no more 
than 10 samples away from a standard. 

A Cañariaco site specific standard was prepared and the assay determined using 40 analyses by 
four different laboratories (SGS, Bondar Clegg, Chemex, and ALS). The standard had a mean 
copper value of (0.435 +/-2sd of 0.013). This standard had no fails for copper values outside of 
the 2 standard deviation limits set by Billiton in the 27 analysis completed on it by ALS-Chemex.  

Blanks consisted of a 300 g bag of crushed sterile quartz. A total of 35 blank analyses did not 
return any failed (anomalous) copper results. 

Field duplicates do not appear to have been submitted to ALS-Chemex.  

12.3.3 Assay Method and Checking 

ALS-Chemex and SGS were chosen by Billiton as their principal and check assay laboratories, 
respectively (Wilson 1999). Samples were each 200 g splits of a 1 kg, 200 mesh homogenised 
sample. A split from each sample pulp was assayed for Au (fire assay with atomic absorption 
finish, 10 ppb detection limit) and Cu, Pb, Zn, Mo and As (multi-acid, total digest - known today 
as 4-acid or near total digestion), with an atomic absorption finish for each element). 

SGS Labs was used as an independent lab to complete check assays on a split of 1 in 20 pulps 
using the same analytical procedures as initial analysis completed by ALS-Chemex. It is not clear 
from the report whether these samples were accompanied by Billiton's own standard reference 
materials. 

12.4 Candente 

12.4.1 Sample Preparation 

All drill core samples from Candente's Cañariaco Norte campaign (inclusive of C04-001 to 
C08-216 but excluding metallurgical sample holes) were prepared and analysed at 
Activation-Skyline Laboratories (Actlabs) in Lima, Peru. (ISO 9001-2000 registration in Peru). 

Sample Preparation 

Sample preparation at the laboratory included the following steps: 

• Sample bags opened and half core samples placed in stainless steel trays with paper liner. 

• Samples oven dried at 50°C for 8 hours (lower temperature prevents loss of volatile elements 
in case ICP is requested at later date). 



SRK Consulting

GED/HA 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM November 30, 2008 

  

• Samples transported to jaw crusher area in roll tray cart. 

• Entire sample crushed in jaw crusher to >70% less than 10 mesh. (Notes: jaw crusher cleaned 
with ½ inch sterile quartz every 5 samples. Also sterile quartz crush analysed for Cu to check 
for contamination from previous client samples. Every 10 samples the crush size is checked 
and adjusted). 

• A 250 to 300 g split is taken of the crushed sample using stainless steel riffle splitter. (Note: 
every 20 samples laboratory takes internal duplicate 250 g split to check for consistency in 
copper grade to confirm that the crush size and split is sufficient for duplication of results, not 
reported to client, but available for verification. The remainder of the coarse crush is bagged 
and stored as coarse reject in Candente's warehouse (Lima)). 

• The 250 g split is pulverized to >95% less than 150 mesh. (Notes: sterile quartz of 40 mesh 
size is used to clean the pulverizer every 10 samples. At random intervals the pulverized 
blank is analyzed for internal laboratory quality control). 

• The pulp is then taken for weighing-out. 

12.4.2 Copper Analysis 

Each sample of the 80 within a batch was subject to total copper and sequential copper leaching 
analysis which returns results for acid soluble, cyanide soluble and residual copper grades.  

Total Copper Analysis (Laboratory code ME-3 or 3 Acid Digestion) 

• From each 250 g pulp sample, a 0.25 g (+/-0.002 g) split is weighed-out. 

• For every 10 samples a laboratory pulp duplicate of 0.25 g (+/-0.002 g) is measured out 
(8 out of a batch of 80 samples received). 

• Each measured pulp is dissolved in three acids simultaneously (nitric (HNO3), hydrochloric 
(HCl) and perchloric (HClO4)). 

• Digestion of sample is done on heat blocks to total dryness at a temperature of 180oC 
(+/- 10oC) . (Notes: The labs heating block capacity is 100 samples (10 x 10 rows). Therefore, 
the 20 remaining spots are filled with internal laboratory QA/QC samples which include; 
certified copper standards (3 to 5 per batch), laboratory blanks (one per batch), laboratory 
duplicate pulp samples (one every 10 samples) and preparation (pulverization) sterile quartz 
analysis (one per batch). A blank 100 ml HCl sample is also placed in batch). 

• The temperature of the digestion table is monitored for consistency across sample batch. 

• The dry sample is diluted in 10% hydrochloric acid (HCl) to specific volume (100 ml). 

• The diluted sample is then sent to the "Clean Room" for an Atomic Absorption ("AA") 
analytical read. (Notes: Atomic Absorption reading pipe is cleaned between each sample. 
Atomic Absorption machine is calibrated with certified copper standard liquid).

PEA Technical Report Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 77 

GED/HA 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM November 30, 2008 

  

Sequential Copper Analysis (Laboratory Code Cu-SEQ) 

• From the 250 g pulp sample, a second 0.25 g (+/-0.002 g) split is weighed-out. 

• Each sample is then subject to three sequential processes, as follows: 

• First leach: 
− The sample is dissolved in sulphuric acid (H2SO4) for 1 hour on mixing table; 
− Solution is centrifuged and the liquid decanted; 
− Sample is washed and centrifuged several times and decanted; 
− The decanted solution is brought to a volume of 200 ml; 
− Solution is read with AA analysis to give acid soluble copper value. 

• Second leach: 
− The remaining sample is then dissolved in sodium cyanide ("NaCN") for 30 minutes on a 

mixer table; 
− The solution is centrifuged and the liquid is decanted; 
− The sample is washed and centrifuged several times and decanted; 
− The decanted solution is brought to a volume of 200 ml; 
− The solution is analysed with AA to give cyanide soluble copper value. 

• The remaining sample is analysed using the same method as total copper analysis (above) to 
give a value for residual copper. 

For any given sample, copper grades obtained by adding the three parts of the sequential copper 
analysis are compared to the copper grade reported in the total copper analysis. The lab has a 
quality control standard that if the sum of the sequential leach grades has > 0.03% difference than 
the total copper grade, the analysis is repeated for both parts of the process. This procedure was 
implemented after 2004 as a number of results from the early drilling show large differences 
between the sum of the sequential copper and the total copper. These samples were re-analyzed 
for both sequential and total copper grade in 2008. The re-analysis returned similar total copper 
grades however the sequential copper values changed so that the sum of these added up to the 
total copper value within acceptable range. 

12.4.3 Gold Analysis 

History of Gold Analysis 

A portion of Candente's pre-2008 drill core samples were assayed for gold at the time of drilling, 
these include: C04-001 to C05-036 (inclusive), C06-041, C06-042, C06-074 (below 149 m), 
C06-076 (below 149 m), C07-129, C07-135, C07-141, C07-146 and C07-159. These samples 
were analysed at Actlabs using a Fire Assay methodology with an atomic absorption finish 
(FA-AA) on a 30 g sample.  



SRK Consulting                              
PEA Technical Report Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 78 

GED/HA 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM November 30, 2008 

  

The remainder of samples were not systematically analysed for gold until a large analysis in-fill 
campaign was conducted in March 2008. Due to the large volume of samples 
(approximately 24,000) the analysis was split between Actlabs, Lima and ALS-Chemex, Lima 
(ISO 9001-2000 registration in Peru). Actlabs completed all missing gold assays from drillholes 
C04-001 to C06-082. ALS-Chemex completed all missing gold assays from drillholes C07-083 to 
C07-202. Both laboratories completed the fill-in work using the same FA-AA on a 30 g sample, 
as was initially used. 

Starting in 2008, all samples are analysed for gold at Actlabs at time of drilling, using the same 
sample size and methodology as used throughout. 

Gold Analysis 

The sample for gold analysis is taken from the remaining pulps after copper analysis. The 
+/-250 g pulps are homogenized and a 30 g split is weighed out for fire assay fusion, cupelled to 
obtain a bead, and digested with Aqua Regia, followed by an AA finish, with a detection limit of 
5 ppb (Actlabs code EF1). 

Assay batch size (oven capacity) for FA- Au at Actlabs is 40 samples. Even though 
QA/QC samples are placed mainly to control copper assays, their spacing is based on the 
40 sample batch size. Each sample batch of 40 samples will contain one standard, one blank and 
one field duplicate. 

Assay batch size (oven capacity) for FA- Au at ALS-Chemex is 80 samples 
(Laboratory code Au-AA23). The same analytical procedure was used at ALS as Actlabs on the 
remaining pulps from copper analysis. 

12.4.4 Multi-element ICP Analysis 

History of Multi-element ICP Analysis 

Selective multi-element analysis was carried out on holes throughout the Cañariaco Norte deposit 
at time of drilling to gain a preliminary understanding of complimentary element distribution 
throughout the deposit. These analyses were carried out by Actlabs, Ancaster, Canada. 

In March 2008, an infill analysis program was carried out to complete multi-element ICP analysis 
for all samples used in the copper resource estimate (to end of hole C08-216). ALS-Chemex was 
chosen to do all in-fill analysis as the ICP machines are located in Lima which greatly reduced 
turn around time for results.

Multi-element ICP Analysis 

The analytical method utilized at Actlabs was a 36 element ICP-OES (Induced Coupled Plasma - 
Optical Emission Spectrometer) read after an Agua Regia digestion of a 0.5 g split 
(Laboratory code 1E3). This leach process uses a combination of concentrated hydrochloric and 
nitric acids to leach sulphides, some oxides and some silicates.  

The analytical method utilized at ALS-Chemex was a 33 element ICP-AES (Induced Coupled 
Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) read after four acid digestion of a 0.25 g split 
(Laboratory code ME-ICP61). In most cases this procedure quantitatively dissolves nearly all 
elements for the majority of geological materials. ALS-Chemex was chosen to do all in-fill 
analysis as they have ICP machines in Lima which greatly reduced turn around time for results.  

12.4.5 Bulk Density 

A total of 9,424 bulk density readings were taken during core logging using a weight in air and 
weight in water. Samples were taken every 10 to 20 m to include all rock types and alterations. 
Data was recorded for drillhole ID, depth, rock type, alteration, weight in air and weight 
submerged in water.  

As a QA/QC measure, a total of 536 check samples were sent to a laboratory for confirmation 
using the same bulk density determination method. Of these, 30 were sent to ACME in 2005, 4 to 
Actlabs in 2007, 251 to Actlabs in 2008 and 251 to SGS in 2008. The 251 samples sent to Actlabs 
in 2008 were of the same piece of core used for bulk density analysis in the field and thus could 
be used as a direct comparison. The laboratory results returned slightly lower bulk density values 
than the field results. A second set of 251 samples was taken of the adjacent core to the first set 
and sent to SGS for a second test to confirm the lower results. These 251 samples were also 
analysed using the paraffin dip method which fills voids in porous rock. Results show a slightly 
lower bulk density from the wax dip method especially in porous samples. Further work on bulk 
density data collection is warranted to optimize the methodology. 

12.5 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs 

The 2004-2008 analytical programs included the submission of 1,039 QC samples for analysis, 
including: 1,039 standards, 1,012 blanks, 986 field duplicates, and 1,650 independent lab checks. 
The authors are unaware of any independent QC data for drilling and sampling programs prior to 
2004. Although this is probable, no data are available from this earlier period of the exploration at 
Cañariaco Norte.

12.5.1 Field Duplicates 

The rational for field duplicates is to monitor the preparation of samples, as well as the internal 
homogeneity of mineralization within the core. Candente implemented the use of field duplicates 
in 2005 with drillhole C05-013. Their 2004 drilling was not accompanied by field duplicates.  

Field duplicates are made at the time of sampling by cutting the half-core in half again. This 
creates two samples of quarter core from the same interval. The two samples are numbered 
sequentially and treated by the lab as two individual samples. Candente have placed field 
duplicates into the sample stream at a ratio of 1 in 30 samples. This ensures that a copper 
analytical batch of 80 samples always contains at least 2 field duplicates. 

The field duplicates represent quartered core sent to Actlabs, Lima. Figure 12.1 shows a very 
good correlation between the original and the duplicate assays. These data indicate that the 
sampling procedures allow excellent reproducibility, and further confirm the persistent nature of 
the mineralization at the sampling scale. 

 

Figure 12.1: Performance of Field Duplicates 

12.5.2 Coarse Crush Duplicates 

The purpose of coarse reject duplicates is to test for the homogeneity of copper grade within the 
-10 mesh crush material and the splitting technique used by the laboratory. Coarse reject 
duplicates have been run on drillholes C04-007 and C05-023. The coarse reject of the entire 
remaining sample is homogenized again and split down to 250 g then pulverized as with the 
original sample. There is a very good correlation between the original and the coarse duplicate 
assays (see Figure 12.2).

Figure 12.2: Comparison between the Original and Coarse Duplicate Assays 

12.5.3 Pulp Duplicates 

Pulp duplicates are used to monitor the analytical precision of a laboratory and homogeneity of 
copper within the pulp. They are taken at the time of weighing out the sample and consist of a 
second 0.25 g split of the same pulp. Pulp duplicate splits are made internally at Actlabs every 
10 samples. These results are reported on the original sample results sheet and monitored by 
Actlabs as part of their internal quality control procedures. 

12.5.4 Independent Laboratory Checks 

Candente has consistently sent 5% of pulps prepared and analyzed by Actlabs to independent 
laboratories for check assays on total copper analysis. Holes C04-001 to C06-082 had 5% of the 
samples sent to ACME Laboratories, Lima for analysis by a 4 acid digestion of a 0.25 g pulp 
split. Holes C07-083 to C07-202 had 5% of the samples sent to SGS laboratories, Lima for 
analysis using the same analytical procedures as the original assay work (3 acid digestions on a 
0.25 g split). All independent checks included standards, blanks and duplicates. Pulp duplicates 
were also made during all independent lab checks at ACME and SGS.

12.5.5 Field Blanks 

Field blanks are used to monitor contamination introduced during the preparation of samples. 
Candente routinely introduced field blank material throughout the sampling of drillholes at 
Cañariaco Norte at a rate of 1 in 30 samples, so that each batch of 80 will always have at least 
two blanks. 

Field blank material is obtained from a barren outcrop of volcanic host rock situated outside of 
the alteration halo at Cañariaco. The initial 10 routine analysis of blank sample material that were 
sent to Actlabs for analysis of their copper and gold content, were used to determine if the 
material was sterile. 

Field blank fail limits are set at 0.05% copper or 5 times the detection limit of 0.01%. There were 
six batches with failed blanks which were mainly confined to one hole. The failed blanks material

12.5.6 Standards 

Standards are used to monitor the analytical accuracy of the laboratory. Candente has routinely 
introduced copper-gold standards into the sample stream at a ratio of 1 every 30 samples, so that 
every assay batch of 80 has at least two standards in it. 

Candente has used six commercially available standards, purchased from CDN Laboratories, 
Vancouver, the specific details of which are shown in Table 12.1.

In addition, in 2006, Candente retained SGS Laboratories, Lima (ISO 9001:2000 accredited) to 
make two standards (GQ602365 and GQ602365) from rocks obtained from unweathered outcrops 
from the Cañariaco Norte mineralized zone, specifically for sequential leach analysis. 
Round-robin testing of the standard material was conducted by five independent laboratories 
using the same analytical methods used for total copper and sequential copper analysis 
(acid soluble copper, cyanide soluble copper and residual copper) as well as gold (fire assay). 
SGS performed all statistical analyses of the results and certified the results. Although the total 
copper results for these two standards were similar, residual copper results were used to verify 
which standard was used. The ranges and values for the two standards are summarised in 
Tables 12.2 and 12.3.

12.5.7 Performance of Standards 

Standards provide a means to monitor analytical accuracy and precision of laboratory analyses. 
Analytical batches with standards falling outside ±2 standard deviations region should be checked 
for potential analytical errors. 

CDN-CGS-01 

The behaviour of standard CDN-CGS-01 shows highly contrasting results between two separate 
time periods that it occurs in the Candente QAQC database (Figure 12.6). Up until October 2004, 
the Cu-standard behaved well, with two failures on the low side. However, since May 2006, the 
standard has returned a result higher than the maximum acceptable limit a large number of times. 
SRK believes that this behaviour may represent a sample mix-up with CDN-CGS-03 over the 
second time period as: 

• Standard CDN-CGS-03 has an average grade of 0.646% Cu, which fits quite well with the 
indicated grade in the post-2004 period. 

• CDN-CGS-01 standards that failed on the high-side never occur in batches with 
CDN-CGS-03 standards. 

This potential bag mix up is further supported with results from blanks and other standards in the 
same batches (see Figure 12.7). In 25 batches with the failed CDN-CGS-01 standards there is 
only one failed blank. All other blanks and all other standards are within the required ±2 standard 
deviations from the mean. As a check, the partial batches that contained CDN-CGS-01 with high 
values were re-run with different standards. These re-runs returned similar copper values for the 
regular samples and the substituted standards were within acceptable limits.

12.5.8 Re-assaying Procedures 

Candente has monitored assay results and implemented a protocol as to whether the analyses 
were acceptable relative to the behaviour of field blanks, standards and field duplicates. For the 
purpose of this resource estimate copper-gold standards were failed on their copper analyses only, 
where the value was outside the acceptable value specified for the standard by CDN Laboratories 
(two standard deviations from the mean). 

Re-analysis of failed copper standards was not carried out at time of drilling. This was mainly due 
to the fact that most batches had two or sometimes three standards in them. If one standard failed 
but the other did not, the batch was considered to be acceptable especially if the other 
QA/QC samples (blanks and duplicates) did not fail.  



SRK Consulting                              
PEA Technical Report Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 90 

GED/HA 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM November 30, 2008 

  

The fail criteria used for the purpose of this resource estimate is greater than two standard 
deviations from the mean. If three standard deviations as a fail criteria are used most standards 
would not fail. 

One batch was re-analyzed at the time of drilling due to a failure of a copper standard. The results 
returned similar values for both the standard and the samples. 

All failed standards were re-run in 2008 to reconcile the failure. Most standards that had failed 
returned similar values as the failed values. Only re-runs of failed standards within the 2008 set of 
samples retuned acceptable values when re-run. The fails are attributed to a series of "rush" 
analysis that when re-run at a normal pace returned acceptable values. 

A blank failure is considered if the returned copper value is 5 times the laboratory detection 
limits. Blank failures have to be re-analysed using the coarse reject material to test the preparation 
procedures. All re-assayed batches from blank failures returned similar values for the failed blank 
as well as the rest of the samples in the batch. The failed blanks were mainly from one drillhole 
where non-authorized blank material was used by a field worker. 

Figure 12.15 shows the results of comparisons between the original assays and re-assays from 
batches with failed standards and blanks. The re-assays compare very well with the original 
assays indicating no bias introduced at sample preparation and analytical stage.

(a) Failed Standards, (b) Failed Blanks 

12.6 Record Keeping for Traceability 

During drilling, logging, sampling and shipping multiple data keeping systems are employed. All 
data in the field is recorded in written form in field books, log books, sample sheets, logging 
forms or shipping forms. Various phases of record keeping are repeated in the subsequent step to 
confirm recorded values or numbers. For example the geologist records standards to be used 
during sampling, the sampler records the actual standard used and the shipping form confirms the

number of bags and where standards are placed in the sample sequence. Any errors in labelling or 
sampling sequence picked up during data verification can usually be traced back to source and 
corrective action taken. 

All field data is entered into Excel tables either in the Cañariaco camp or at the Candente Lima 
office. Errors in data entry picked up during the verification stage can be confirmed and corrected 
from filed data.  

Data from third parties such as laboratories or survey contractors are generally supplied in digital 
and printed form. These records are printed out and kept in binders for reference during data 
verification. 

12.7 Data Storage and Security 

12.7.1 Paper Data 

Original field logs and data are stored in the Candente Lima office with a scanned copy returned 
to the Cañariaco camp for reference purposes. Excel data sheets are printed out and bound for 
storage in Lima and camp. Data pertaining directly to the sample and drill data base is printed out 
in Vancouver as well and bound. 

Two copies of the original signed assay certificates have been requested from the analytical 
laboratories used. One copy is kept in the Lima office and the other is couriered or carried to the 
Vancouver office. In addition, photocopies of original assay certificates are kept by the QP for 
reference purposes. Tabulated grades as well as logs are printed out and bound as hard copies in 
the Vancouver office.  

12.7.2 Computer Data 

All field data are entered into Microsoft Excel data base. Individual files from the field are sent to 
the database manager in Lima for storage in the main database. A copy of the digital files is sent 
to the Vancouver office were they are backed up to the company server. In addition, CD and 
DVD back-up discs of the main data base is done and stored off premises.  

Digital results sent from the laboratories are only sent to the QP and database person in 
Vancouver. The Laboratories retain a list of authorized e-mail addresses and will not send data to 
addresses not included in the list. Only the QP and Vancouver database manager receive digital 
assay results from the laboratory. The laboratory retains a digital copy of all results sent out and 
can re-send the entire assay database upon request by the QP.

13 Data Verification 
SRK has conducted the following checks to the current drillhole database: 

• Detailed verification of assays using signed assay certificates; 

• Assay verification from electronic laboratory files; 

• Verification of down-hole survey data; 

• Verification of drillhole positions in field; 

• Comparison of Cu grades from re-sampling of historical drillholes to original data; 

• Verification of Cu assay data from twinned drillholes; 

• Comparison of Cu assays from different analytical procedures; 

• Comparison of Cu assays from vertical versus inclined holes; and 

• Collection and independent analysis of check assay samples. 

13.1 Detailed Verification of Assays from Signed Assay Certificates  

All drillhole assays up to C06-82 were verified by Minefill Services and the verification process 
was described in their NI-43-101 technical report (Minefill, 2007). SRK verified close to 10% of 
the assay data from holes drilled after C06-82. Randomly chosen assays were manually entered 
into an Excel spread sheet and compared with the assays in the database. No errors were found in 
the database.  

13.2 Verification from Electronic Lab Files 

Upon SRK's request, Actlabs Skyline Peru (Actlabs) sent electronic assay data directly to SRK's 
offices in Vancouver. The laboratory assays were compared with the assays in the current 
database received from Candente. Matching records were found for approximately 26,000 assays. 
Additional matched records with electronic files were found from electronic lab files sent by 
Candente (1,900 assays). Overall, approximately 97% of the data in the current database were 
provided either by the lab or by Candente and were found to be accurately compiled. The 
remaining records were not verified.

13.3 Verification of Down-hole Survey Data 

Out of 229 drillholes, 45 do not have a down-hole survey. In addition, of the holes that have been 
surveyed, 82 drillholes have identical azimuths and dips at the collar and down-hole. Examples of 
this are drillholes C07-141, C05-019, and C05-032. 

When surveyed, down-hole readings were either done with a Pajari or Sperry Sun instrument. 
Although it is impossible to verify the readings from Pajari, the Sperry Sun film records were 
available and provided to SRK by Candente. Several drillholes with constant down-hole azimuths 
and dips were spot checked and compared with the current database. The checked dips confirmed 
the values read by Candente personnel. 

Based on the down-hole survey data, it is possible to assess potential deviations in the unsurveyed 
holes. To assess the deviations, only drillholes with some reported differences either in azimuth 
or dip were used. Figure 13.1 is a plot of distance versus deviation in each drill-hole (separate 
plots for inclined and vertical holes), with the average tendency for the deviations indicated by 
the thick white regression curves. In vertical holes, the deviation can be as high as 50 m at 500 m 
depth (C05-14). In inclined holes, the deviation can be as high as 35 m at 300 m depth (C07-195). 
On average, at 300 m depth the deviation is 4 m in vertical holes and 8 m in inclined holes. 

Considering that the Cañariaco Norte deposit is being evaluated for a large open pit scenario 
(Minefill, 2007; SRK ongoing work), the potential for significant deviations in the 45 unsurveyed 
holes is considered to be low.

13.4 Verification of Drillhole Positions 

The positions of 8 drillholes were checked using a hand-held GPS. A comparison of the results 
with Candente's surveyed collar positions is shown in Table 13.1. There is very good agreement 
between the two determinations, particularly considering the forest canopy and steep-sided terrain 
which affect GPS readings.

13.5 Re-sampling of Historical Drillholes 

An extensive re-sampling program of historical pre-2004 (pre-Candente) drillhole data has been 
conducted by Candente. Nine out of eleven historical holes were re-sampled. Only holes C73-001 
and C73-005 holes were not re-sampled. C73-001 was twinned by C04-001 and C73-005 did not 
have significant copper grade. 

Sections of the old core were quartered and sent to Actlabs, Lima for processing. Due to the poor 
state of the historic core after several moves, composite samples of up to 20 m were made within 
mineralization types and between fixed blocks to assure proper meterage measurements. In the 
2007 resource estimate (Minefill, 2007), assays from the re-sampled composites sections were 
included and the old assays were excluded from the database. A comparison between the original 
and the Candente assays shows good correlation between the two sets of data (see Figure 13.2). 
The correlation improves with time, starting from 1973 holes and ending with 1999 holes. 

Based on the good correlation between the historical grades and the Candente re-assay grades, all 
of the historical data have been inserted into the final database and the Candente assays from the 
re-sampling program excluded (due to composite lengths).

13.6 Drillhole Twinning 

Three pairs of twinned holes were drilled by Candente to verify grade uniformity at short 
distances. Figure 13.3 shows relatively good correlation of higher grade zones drilled in 2004 and 
subsequently in 2007. Two of the twin sets (holes C04-007 with C07-104 and C04-023 with 
C07-106) show similar average grades over the same depth intervals. The third twin set (C04-005 
with C07-146) shows significantly higher average grades in the original drillhole from 2004 than 
in its twin drilled in 2007. This may indicate a vertically-oriented mineralized vein set intercepted 
in one drillhole and not the other.

13.7 Comparison of Cu Assays from Different Analytical Procedures 

The resource data base consists of copper grades obtained from Actlabs using a 3-acid digestion 
with AA finish analytical technique. The 4-acid digestion was not used because there is no 
evidence of oxide copper (which can only be dissolved with 4-acids) at Cañariaco Norte. 
However, a second copper grade data base exists from the suit of multi element ICP data obtained 
from Actlabs and ALS-Chemex.  

The ALS-Chemex multi element analysis (ICP-AES) was done on a 4-acid digestion and thus a 
comparison could be made between the two sets of copper results to see if there was a significant 
difference between results from 3-acid versus 4-acid digestion. 

From analysis of the assays from standard reference materials, there is some suggestion that the 
total copper assays for mid to high copper grades may be slightly low. However, Figure 13.4 
shows that copper values from the ICP-AES read after four acid digestion (ALS-Chemex multi 
element analysis) and total copper values from an AA read after a 3-acid leach (Actlabs total 
copper) compare very well in general.  

As part of the ICP-AES analysis completed at ALS-Chemex, a total of 410 samples returned 
over-limit (>10,000ppm or 1% Cu) results. As per procedure, these samples were re-analyzed by 
ALS-Chemex using a 4-acid digestion with an AA read. These analyses allow the direct 
comparison of 3-acid to 4-acid digestion at higher copper concentrations as the read method was 
the same. Of the 410 samples, 98.8% had less than 10% absolute relative difference indicating 
that the 3-acid digestion data base is suitable for use in a resource estimate and does not have a 
bias on the low side. 

Comparisons of copper results from the ICP-OES read after Agua Regia digestion (Actlabs multi 
element analysis) versus values from an AA read after a 3-acid leach (Actlabs total copper) were 
also compared and show a fairly good correlation although not as good as the 4-acid digestion. 

In general, at very low copper concentrations the ICP results tend to be slightly higher, and at 
higher concentrations (>0.2% Cu) the assays derived from both procedures are very similar. In 
conclusion, the Cu assays in the current database are not biased on the low side.

13.8 Comparison of Assays from Vertical versus Inclined Holes 

The majority of the current assay database is derived from vertical drillholes (174 out of 229). 
To check for the potential difference between assays from vertical and inclined holes, samples 
from the two types of data were paired if they were found to be close to each other. To constitute 
a pair, samples had to be from the same geological domain and at distance less than 50 m from 
each other. Figure 13.5 is a q-q plot that shows how the two types of data compare; it shows that 
there is no substantial difference between the assays from vertical and from inclined holes.

13.9 SRK Independent Check Assays 

During the site visit, SRK spent several days in the core facility at Chiclayo, during which time a 
suite of check assay samples were taken and submitted by SRK to an independent laboratory, 
ALS-Chemex, North Vancouver. Samples were chosen on the basis of their Cu grade (determined 
by Candente), lithology, mineralization type (presence of leachable Cu) and age of drillhole, in an 
effort to reflect the variability in the deposit and the consistency of results over time. 

Samples were comprised of pieces of quartered core sample over a 2 m interval coinciding with a 
sample interval of Candente. However, the very fractured, rubbly nature of the recovery of 
several intervals meant that the sample reflects a sample of gravel sized core fragments, rather 
than split core. Details of the samples are shown in Table 13.2. 

All samples were prepared and analysed for total Cu by ALS-Chemex, using a 4-acid digestion 
technique with ICP-AES detection (ALS Code: ME-OG62). Comparisons of results with the 
original Candente assays are shown in Table 13.3, as well as in Figure 13.6. Although the sample 
population is relatively low, the comparison of total Cu results yields a relatively good agreement 
on the whole. This is indicated by the relative percentage difference (Table 13.3) plotted against 
percentile as an absolute value (Figure 13.6). The agreement is satisfactory, with approximately 
65% and 90% of paired data falling below 10% and 20% absolute relative difference. 
Significantly, there is no strong bias within the data, with points falling above and below the 
parity line in Figure 13.6. The data do not show an obvious correlation between the relative 
difference and lithology, mineralisation, grade or time of assay. 

In addition, the reasonable correlation between the results from SRK checks using 4-acid 
digestion technique with ICP finish and those obtained by Candente using a 3-acid leach and 
AA finish further confirm that the 3-acid leach technique is appropriate for the Cañariaco Norte 
mineralization.

15 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

15.1 Testwork Programs 

Candente has initiated four separate testwork programs for Cañariaco Norte as summarized in this 
section. 

15.1.1 Scoping Leachability Program 

Initial resource development identified potentially leachable copper mineralization. From 2005 to 
2006 Kappes, Cassidy & Associates ("KCA") assessed leaching of samples containing high 
levels of cyanide soluble copper. Leaching testwork comprised of bottle roll leach tests and 
column leach tests. Initial recovery results were variable and less than anticipated. As a result 
additional new samples were taken from twinned drillholes and sent to SGS Lakefield Research 
Chile ("SGS") for bottle roll and column leaching testwork. The results at SGS Chile were similar 
to the results from KCA. 

15.1.2 Scoping Comminution and Flotation Program 

On-going development drilling confirmed the presence of a significantly larger copper resource 
with predominantly sulphide copper mineralization. Therefore the focus of the testwork was 
revised to assess the metallurgical response of the sulphide copper mineralization to flotation. In 
late 2007, SGS re-composited untreated samples remaining from the leaching testwork program 
into three master composites for scoping level comminution and flotation testwork. These 
samples were not considered to be representative of the entire primary sulphide deposit, 
nevertheless, it was believed the testwork would provide a good preliminary indication of the 
metallurgy. The initial results were very encouraging and confirmed that additional testwork 
focusing on the flotation of the sulphide mineralization was warranted.  

15.2 Feasibility Comminution and Flotation Program 

Based on the positive initial sulphide flotation testwork, in early 2008 a feasibility level 
comminution and flotation testwork program was developed and initiated at SGS. Fresh samples 
were collected and composited, then subjected to comprehensive comminution and flotation tests 
with the objective of defining metallurgical parameters for a feasibility study. As of this report 
date this work is approximately 80% complete.

15.2.1 Variability Program 

A key component of a feasibility level metallurgical program is variability testing. In mid 2008, 
Candente initiated a variability testwork drilling campaign to collect a suite samples that would 
be representative of the potentially mineable resource as defined at that point. As of this report 
date this work is still in progress.  

15.3 Scoping Leachability Program 

The Cañariaco deposit contains significant levels of leachable copper minerals including 
chalcocite, covellite, digenite and enargite. As a result initial metallurgical testwork at KCA 
focused on the assessment of the leaching characteristics of the ore. A follow-up leach program 
on 55 sub-composite samples and two master composites, including both bottle roll and column 
leach tests was completed by SGS. 

The SGS results confirmed previous testwork by KCA that not all the soluble copper minerals in 
the ore were completely leachable. Results were variable and indicated potential recoveries of 
60% to 70% of the contained leachable copper. 

As resource drilling continued at Cañariaco Norte, the existence of a significantly larger sulphide 
resource was confirmed. The fact that the potentially leachable copper mineralogy was now a 
smaller part of the total copper resource combined with the variable copper leachability, Candente 
management concluded that development of the project based solely on a leaching process was 
not the best approach. The leaching testwork program was then concluded and a metallurgical 
program was implemented to assess traditional grinding and flotation treatment of the Cañariaco 
Norte deposit. 

15.4 Scoping and Pre-feasibility Comminution and Flotation 
Programs 

15.4.1 Introduction  

Candente commissioned Transmin to supervise the scoping, pre-feasibility and variability level 
comminution and flotation testwork programs. The testwork for each of these programs is being 
performed by SGS in Santiago. The objective of these programs is to develop a suitable process 
flowsheet and reagent suite for treatment of the Cañariaco ores. The results and findings 
presented herein are based upon metallurgical results from a series of comminution (crushing and 
grinding) and flotation tests performed by SGS between April and September, 2008. 
Preliminary results of recent variability tests performed between July and October, 2008 have 
also been incorporated. The comminution/flotation development and variability testwork 
programs are not yet complete.

Pre-feasibility testwork was performed on Cañariaco ore composites identified as CPY, MIX, 
ENT and SEC. Variability results to date were received for the grinding testwork but the 
variability flotation testwork has not commenced. 

Tests results so far indicate that traditional flotation technology could be used to concentrate 
copper into commercial grade concentrates with good recoveries.  

There is still further investigation required to fully assess the presence of arsenic and antimony in 
the resource and how they might affect the processing route selection and concentrate marketing 
economics. Based on preliminary and unsubstantiated arsenic recovery assumptions, the LOM 
average grade of As in the Cu concentrate was estimated to be 1.3%.  

15.5 Mineralization 

A QEMSCAN examination of the samples indicated the predominant minerals and mineral 
associations present in the Cañariaco Norte samples are: 

• Predominant copper mineral species are chalcopyrite, covellite, chalcocite, enargite, bornite, 
tennantite; 

• Predominant non-metallic gangue minerals are quartz and micas/biotite/chlorite/clay group; 

• Copper sulphide minerals are mainly associated with pyrite and other sulphide gangue 
minerals; and  

• The predominant sulphide gangue mineral is pyrite. Pyrite is present as liberated pyrite or in 
association with other sulphide minerals. 

15.6 Sampling and Sample Preparation 

There have been three drilling campaigns that have extracted samples for testwork: 

• Advanced leaching, "Scoping comminution and flotation testwork" drilling (early 2007); 

• Feasibility comminution and flotation testwork (late 2007); and 

• Variability comminution and flotation testwork (2008). 

The most extensive of the three drilling campaigns was performed to obtain samples for the 
pre-feasibility and variability testwork programs. A total of 14 holes were drilled strictly to obtain 
samples for the testwork. The locations of the pre-feasibility and variability metallurgical 
drillholes are presented in Figures 15.1 and 15.2.

The Cañariaco Norte mineral resource was divided using the following parameters to generate 
metallurgical domains for sampling: 

• Geographical areas; 

• Depth; 

• Lithology; 

• Alteration; 

• Copper grade; 

• Copper mineralization (as determined by sequential leach results); and 

• Minor element grades. 

15.6.1 Scoping Program Samples 

Fifty-five (55) composite samples were originally sent to SGS for leachability testwork. The 
classification of these composites was based on sequential copper analysis of twinned holes. The 
samples were half HQ size core in all cases except holes 104 (CO4-007) and 106 (CO5-023) that 
were quarter core. 

From these 55 composites there were five domains that were identified for preliminary flotation 
testwork composites. These were grouped together based on lithology, alteration and type of 
copper minerals present as follows: 

• CPY – Mainly chalcopyrite; 

• Bs. IBxP – mainly igneous breccia polylithic lithology; 

• Cu CN (Cc, Cv) – mainly chalcocite and/or covellite; 

• Bs. IBxH –mainly intrusive breccia hydrothermal lithology; and 

• En –high enargite content. 

In order to prepare these samples for leaching testwork, they were crushed to 100% -25 mm and 
classified into screen fractions. This material was then re-sampled and recomposited in order to 
make flotation composites. To conserve costs and reduce turn-around time, the two breccia 
composites were combined into a single breccia composite (BS) and the enargite composite was 
not tested.

15.6.2 Feasibility Samples 

The impact of each domain factor on metallurgical performance was again evaluated and it was 
determined that copper mineralization was more important than lithology or alteration, therefore 
the samples were grouped into four master composites. These composites are: 

• CPY – a predominantly hypogene mineralization type that is primarily chalcopyrite; 

• ENT – a mixed mineralization type that has elevated arsenic values from the multi-element 
analysis; 

• MIX – a mixed mineralization type that contains several copper sulphide minerals; and 

• SEC – a mineralization type that contains predominantly enriched minerals such as 
chalcocite, covellite, bornite, enargite and tennantite. These minerals are often thought of as 
secondary, but in the case of Cañariaco Norte many have primary genesis. 

Samples delivered to SGS were divided into 28 sub-samples. In order to make the composites for 
metallurgical testing, several compositing criteria were initially considered which included 
copper residual assays, iron content, mineralogy, sample location and the ratio of cyanide-soluble 
copper to total copper. This was approved by Samuel Engineering and Candente Resource Corp.  

The five main alteration types and the seven main rock types seen in Cañariaco Norte are all 
present in proportional amounts in the four master composites selected.

15.7 Comminution Testwork 

15.7.1 Scoping Comminution Testing 

The comminution test results from the scoping level tests are summarized in Table 15.3.

These Bond ball mill work indices ("BWI") indicate a low to moderate hardness ore. 

15.7.2 Pre-feasibility Comminution Testing 

The pre-feasibility level comminution testwork was comprised of the followed tests: 

• Crushing work index (CWI); 

• SAG mill comminution (JKSMC); 

• Drop weight test (JKDWT); 

• Specific gravity (SG); 

• Abrasion Index (AI); 

• Bond Rod mill work index (RWI); 

• Bond Ball mill work index (BWI); and 

• SAG power index (SPI). 

Testwork results are summarized in Table 15.4.

SEC 96 9.2 54.6 0.0945 

In summary, SAG Power Index (SPI) values are in the range of 56 to 73 minutes. Also, Bond ball 
mill work indices in the range of 9 to 12 kW-h/t indicate a generally soft to moderate ore hardness 
amenable to standard crushing and ball milling or crushing and SAG/ball milling. Abrasion 
indices less than 0.4 suggest the ore will be slightly abrasive.

15.7.3 Variability Comminution Testing 

The variability testwork indicates an average Bond Work Index of less than 10 kW-h/t. 
Ball mill work indices in the range of 9 to 12 kW-h/t confirm the results of the pre-feasibility 
testwork indicating a soft to moderate ore type.  

The average abrasion index is approximately 0.1. For several of the composites (CP-02, CP-04 
and CP-05) the abrasion indices are shown to be less than 0.1. This may indicate that the selected 
variability composites correspond to a non-abrasive ore unlike the feasibility composites.  

Variability crushing work indices in the range of 4 to 12 kW-h/t are typical of porphyry copper 
deposits, but are significantly less than those reported in the pre-feasibility tests. These results are 
not final and an explanation from the laboratory is pending. 

The following figures summarize the grindability data from the 48 variability composites (CP). 
The composites are in the 80th percentile for abrasivity similar to the average abrasion index that 
was determined from the pre-feasibility composites.  

This data is incomplete and the exercise should be repeated with complete final data.

Figure 15.5: Abrasion Indices (Variability Testing) 

The ball mill work index results (BWI) are significantly lower for the pre-feasibility composite 
samples when compared to the scoping study composite samples. The reason for this has not been 
determined and there is no scoping study composite sample left on which to repeat the tests.  

The variability sample comminution results are consistent with the pre-feasibility sample results 
and, therefore, a higher level of confidence has been placed on the pre-feasibility comminution 
results. For this report, it is recommended that the pre-feasibility comminution results be used for 
the determination of comminution power and for selection of crushing and grinding equipment.

15.8 Flotation Testwork 

The objective of flotation testwork was to identify an industry standard, cost effective approach to 
maximize copper recovery and concentrate copper grade. Standardized conditions were sought 
for all sample types. The testwork assessed the effect of primary grind size, regrind size, pH, 
amount and types of collector and frother on the flotation response. The effect of sulphidization 
was also examined.  

15.8.1 Scoping Program 

Effect of Grind Size 

Several rougher flotation tests were performed at different particle sizes (K80 of 75, 106, 150, 
212 and 250 µm) and at pH of 10. 

There was little performance difference between P80 106 and 150 µm. The 2% recovery 
improvement from grinding down to P80 75 µm would probably be offset by the higher OPEX 
and CAPEX of the primary grind and cleaner circuits as the mass pull was higher. Therefore, a 
P80 of 150 µm was recommended for later testwork. 

Effect of Collectors and pH 

Several rougher flotation tests were carried out to determine the best reagents to obtain a high 
copper recovery. Various flotation reagents were evaluated using a constant primary grind P80 of 
106 µm at pH of 10. The best flotation results of the three composites were obtained with the 
collector AP-3894 and methyl isobutyl carbinol ("MIBC") frother. Several test were carried out 
to evaluate the effect of primary grinding on the rougher performance (grade and recovery) using 
this reagent pair. 

Tests were carried out at P80 of 150 µm with addition of collector AP-3498 (25 g/t) and frother 
MIBC (10 g/t). The flotation tests conducted at pH values of 7.2, 11 and 12 indicated that a pH of 
10 is optimum for the rougher flotation stage. This pH gave acceptable results for all of the 
composites tested. 

Effect of Sulphidization 

Sulphidization agents are often used to improve the flotability of semi-oxide minerals and can 
improve bornite flotation kinetics significantly. Tests were carried out at P80 150 µm and pH of 
10 with addition of collector AP-3498 (25 g/t) and frother MIBC (10 g/t). Results indicate that 
flotation performance (recovery and grade) was not improved by the addition of a sulphidizing 
reagent.

Cleaner Flotation 

Rougher concentrate was produced out at P80 of 150 µm with addition of collector AP-3894 and 
frother MIBC. The rougher concentrate was reground and floated in two cleaning stages and one 
cleaner-scavenger stage. The effects of pulp pH and regrind size were also evaluated. 

Results indicate that the concentrate grade is sensitive to cleaning flotation pH and regrind size.  

Finer regrind improved concentrate grade for all the composites tested. Results indicate 
performance at a P80 of 37 µm (80% passing 400 mesh) achieved satisfactory concentrate grade 
for each ore type. See Figure 15.6. 

The effect of pH was important in order to obtain good concentrate grades for the CPY 
composite. For this sample a pH of 12 was required to achieve satisfactory concentrate grade. For 
the other two composites, it is possible to produce acceptable final concentrate grades with 
flotation pH much lower in the cleaning stage.

Locked Cycle Tests 

Locked cycle test (LCT) objectives were: 

• Produce a closed metallurgical projection for the sample tested; and 

• Assess whether the flowsheet and reagent scheme are stable in a closed circuit.

Locked cycle tests for each composite were carried out as follows: 

Primary grind:  P80 150 µm 

Primary pH:  10 

Collector:  25 g/t AP-3894 

Frother:   10 g/t MIBC 

Regrind:  P80 20 µm for CPY 

   P80 37 µm for CN 

   P80 37 µm for BS 

Cleaner pH:  12 for CPY 

   11.5 for CN 

   11.5 for BS 

 

Figure 15.7: Lock Cycle Test Flowsheet 

Stability was reached over the last three cycles for all composites. 

A recovery of 89% Cu with a concentrate grade of 25.5% Cu was achieved for the CPY 
composite. The copper concentrate grade could possibly improve with a third cleaning stage. 

The final concentrate grade was 26.6% Cu with 81% recovery for the BS composite.

A recovery of 84.5% Cu with a final concentrate grade of 26.5% Cu was achieved for sample CN. 
This grade is relatively low for a mineral of secondary type. In order to obtain better concentrate 
grade it would be necessary to regrind a little finer than the K80 of 37 µm used, and use a pH in 
the cleaner stage higher than the pH of 11.5 used for the locked cycle test. Subsequent mineralogy 
showed that fine associations with pyrite limit the final concentrate grade possible for the 
CN domain. 

15.8.2 Feasibility Metallurgical Testing 

Primary Flotation Test 

Primary flotation was conducted with six stages of roughing. Collector and frother type and 
dosage, and pulp pH were varied to evaluate their effect on mineral flotation performance. The 
duration of each flotation test was 18 minutes.  

Effect of Primary Grind Size 

The effect of grind size (P80 at 75 µm, 100 µm, 150 µm, 200 µm and 250 µm) on the flotation 
performance of the feasibility composites was evaluated. Several tests were carried out at 25 g/t 
of collector A3894 and 10 g/t of frother MIBC. Tests were conducted at pH of 10 (maintained 
through addition of lime) and 33% slurry density.  

Although finer grinding improved the copper recovery, a primary grind of P80 125 µm was 
deemed as optimum. The CPY composite in particular showed a marked improvement between 
106 and 150 µm. 

Effect of Collectors and Frothers 

Collector screening tests were performed on pre-feasibility composites to investigate the 
selectivity for copper recovery. Tests were completed out at grind size of 125 µm and pH of 10 
with collector types of AP-3894, AP-3330, PAX, AP-3477, AP-404, AP-3926 and AP-3302 and 
with frother (MIBC) addition.  

Higher copper selectivity was observed for all composites using collectors AP-3330, AP-3477 
and AP-3894. The addition of reagent AP- 3894 appears to increase the concentrate copper grade 
of the ENT composite significantly.  

Frother screening tests were carried out on the pre-feasibility composites. Tests were carried out 
at grind size of 125 µm and pH of 10 with frother types of MIBC, D-250, H-76 and TEB and with 
addition of collectors AP-3894 (25 g/t) and AP-3330 (25 g/t). The results indicate that copper 
recovery and grade benefit most from the use of AP-3330/MIBC.

Effect of Pulp pH 

Several tests on pre-feasibility composites were conducted at natural pH, pH of 9, 10, 11 and 12. 
Tests were performed at a grind size of 125 µm with addition of collector AP-3330 (25 g/t) and 
frother MIBC (20 g/t). Natural pH values corresponding to composites CPY, MIX, SEC and ENT 
are pH 6.2, 6.57, 6.65 and 5.37 respectively. 

At pH 9 and 10, good performance was obtained (recovery and grade) with particularly higher 
concentrate copper grades occurring at pH 10 for all composites. A noticeable decrease in copper 
recovery occurs at natural pH for ENT and SEC mineral samples.  

Sulphidization Tests 

Tests were completed at a grind size of 125 µm, pH of 10 with addition of collector AP-3330 
(25 g/t) and frother MIBC (10 g/t). The effect of the reagent NaHS addition (50 g/t and 100 g/t) 
on the mineral response to flotation was evaluated. 

The composites CPY, MIX and SEC show better copper recoveries without the addition of NaHS. 
However, the addition of 50 g/t of NaHS did slightly improve copper recovery for the ENT 
composite. 

Cleaner Flotation Tests 

Regrind Tests 

Tests were performed on the pre-feasibility composites with a primary grind size of 125 µm, pH 
10, cleaner pH 11.5, and  AP-3330 (25 g/t) and MIBC (10 g/t). NaHS was not used. Regrinds 
were evaluated at times of 4, 8 and 12 min rather than specific P80 sizes to facilitate lab work 
with the small sample mass available. Figure15.8 shows a schematic of the workflow employed. 

The CPY composite required 4 minutes of regrinding to achieve optimal grade-recovery 
relationship in batch tests. Between 8 and 12 minutes was required for the other three composites. 
Locked cycle tests and detailed mineralogy is required in order to further define the regrind 
requirements for each composite.  

The low overall concentrate grades for the CPY and MIX composites may lead to difficulties in 
producing high grade concentrates from locked cycle tests. This corresponds to a P80 of 50 µm 
for CPY and ENT, and a P80 of 35 µm for SEC and MIX type ores.

Cleaner Kinetics 

Tests were carried out to determine the optimum flotation time for cleaner and cleaner–scavenger 
flotation. Tests were run at primary grind size of P80 of 125 µm with addition of AP-3330 
(25 g/t) and frother MIBC (10 g/t) at pH 10. Flotation times were as follows: 

• First stage cleaner: 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 minutes; and 

• Cleaner – scavenger: 1, 2, 4, 7 and 11 minutes. 

Cleaner flotation time must balance between satisfactory copper recovery and good selectivity 
against slow floating gangue minerals. At least 3 minutes per stage is required to achieve good 
copper recovery, but more time will increase gangue pull to the concentrate, reducing the 
concentrate grade and possibly increasing the re-circulating load. If precious metal recovery is to 
be increased, then longer flotation times may be required.  

Effect of Pulp pH on Cleaner Flotation 

Several cleaner flotation tests were conducted at pH 11, 11.5 and 12. Tests were carried out at a 
grind size of 125 µm with addition of AP-3330 (25 g/t) and frother MIBC (20 g/t). A pH of 11.5 
achieved satisfactory results for all composites tested, however locked cycle tests are pending.

15.9 Metallurgical Recommendations  

15.9.1 Flowsheet Selection 

A standard copper flotation flowsheet is recommended incorporating crushing, grinding, rougher 
flotation, rougher concentrate regrinding, and two stage cleaner flotation to produce a copper 
concentrate. The first cleaner tail should be scavenged in a mechanical cell and the cleaner 
scavenger concentrate sent back to the regrind mill. The rougher tails and the cleaner scavenger 
tails would be discharged to a tailings containment facility. The cleaner concentrate would be 
dewatered and shipped offshore to a smelter for refining. 

15.9.2 Copper Recovery 

It is recommended that a recovery of 90% Cu be considered for this preliminary economic 
assessment, based on a P80 of 125 μm and a rougher flotation mass pull of 20%. More testwork 
and mine planning information is required to define the copper recovery for a feasibility level 
assessment. 

15.9.3 Copper Concentrate Grade 

Based on the testwork completed to date a concentrate grade of 27% Cu is projected. More 
testwork will be required to confirm concentrate grades for pre-feasibility and feasibility level 
assessments.  

15.9.4 Gold and Silver Recovery 

There has been sufficient flotation testwork conducted to estimate gold and silver recoveries to 
the scoping study level of confidence and it is recommended that recoveries of 55% for gold and 
65% for silver be applied for a preliminary economic assessment. Variability and advanced 
locked cycle testwork plus mine planning information is required to define recoveries for a 
feasibility level assessment. 

15.9.5 Molybdenum Recovery 

The head grades of the samples tested have been too low to justify recovery of molybdenum to a 
separate concentrate. It is recommended that no credits for molybdenum be considered for the 
preliminary economic assessment. 

15.9.6 Primary Grind 

A 2 to 6% rougher recovery benefit was realized by decreasing the primary grind P80 from 150 to 
106 μm. A primary grind of 125 μm was therefore selected for subsequent testwork and is 
recommended for the grinding circuit design for this study.

15.9.7 Concentrate Regrind 

Regrinding of the rougher concentrate is required to maximize copper and precious metal 
recoveries. Preliminary concentrate regrind tests and locked cycle tests indicate that the CPY and 
ENT composites require a regrind P80 of approximately 50 μm, whereas the SEC and MIX 
composites require a finer regrind P80 of 35 μm. 

15.9.8 Flotation pH 

It is recommended that a rougher flotation pH of 10 and a cleaner pH of 11.5 will be suitable for 
most ore types. Lime should be used for pH control. 

15.9.9 Reagents 

It is recommended that a dose of 25 g/t SNF FLOERGER 3330A type collector (SIPX) and 10 g/t 
MIBC frother be used for the preliminary economic assessment. The flotation reagent suite will 
be optimized during the variability testwork. 

15.9.10 Retention Time 

Rougher flotation in the laboratory is complete after approximately 10 to 12 min. 

Each cleaning stage requires at least 3 minutes. A scale up factor of 2 to 2.5 should be used to 
determine the installed flotation capacity of an industrial plant. 

15.9.11 Penalty Element Recovery 

There is arsenic and antimony in the concentrates that could incur penalties from the smelters. 

The arsenic recovery in initial testwork was high and for the sake of a preliminary economic 
assessment it is recommended that the same recovery as copper be applied to arsenic (90%). 
Using this assumption yields an average LOM As grade of 1.3% in the Cu concentrate. 

The antimony recovery in the early testwork was varied and there is insufficient work to date to 
define a specific recovery rate. For the purposes of preliminary economic assessment, it is 
recommended that a 70% recovery value be applied.

16 Mineral Resource Estimate 

16.1 Introduction 

A primary objective of SRK's work on the Cañariaco Norte deposit was to produce an 
independent, CIM compliant resource estimate of copper grades. The copper resource estimate 
was published in mid-May 2008, and followed by a 43-101 technical report in July 2008. In 
August and September 2008 SRK carried out resource estimates of gold and silver. In addition, to 
provide guidance for possible smelter penalties, arsenic was also estimated. The following 
resource sections, modified for additional statistical assay analyses of gold and silver, are largely 
taken from the July 2008 technical report. The arsenic estimates are not considered part of the 
resource and will not be further discussed. The following discussion will concentrate on copper, 
considering that it represents approximately 95% of the value of the deposit. 

The resource estimate was conducted on a dataset that includes the results of approximately 
60,560 metres of drilling in 213 drillholes (1973-2008). Drilling was still on-going at the time of 
the estimate, and only results from holes up to C08-216 (completed in March 2008) were 
included in the estimate. 

The principal components of SRK's estimation work included: 

• Construction of a 3D geological model in Datamine to constrain the data selection and 
interpolation processes;  

• Defining geological domains; 

• Copper, gold and silver mineral resource estimation by ordinary kriging; and 

• Classification of the resource. 

16.2 Geological Model 

16.2.1 Data and Modelling 

Candente provided SRK with a geological map and a set of cross-sections at 1:2000 scale. The 
sections comprised of 16 east-west sections as listed in Table 16.1. 



SRK Consulting                              
PEA Technical Report Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 122

In addition, a geological domain data set was provided in Excel format based on all logging to 
date. The domain data set included from-to intervals and lithologies. These were imported into 
Datamine. 

Due to the dense vegetation and soil cover at Cañariaco, outcrop is limited and is commonly 
deeply weathered. Therefore, geological mapping is based on sparse outcrop data, near surface 
drill intersections and lithological mapping from trenches. 

Geological cross-sections are based almost entirely on drillhole data. Data was included on a 
section if it occurred within a 100 m perpendicular distance from the line of section, meaning that 
each section represents a projection of a vertical corridor 100 m wide. 

Based on the received map, geological sections and lithological domain file, SRK constructed a 
3D lithological model of the Cañariaco Norte deposit using Datamine software. During the 
modelling process, any significant inconsistencies in the logged geology between holes which 
could not be reasonably accounted for geologically were checked by Candente geologists on site 
in Chiclayo. This validation of the sectional geology resulted in several holes being re-logged. 
The holes revisited were predominantly older holes, which needed re-logging in the light of more 
recent geological interpretations and knowledge. The holes were re-logged in the Chiclayo 
facilities by Candente staff and the summary logs were replaced in the lithological domain data 
base. 

The geology of Cañariaco Norte is complex, resulting from multiple episodes of magmatic and 
hydrothermal breccia intrusions. Although the broad chronological order of intrusive phases is 
known from cross-cutting relationships, it is clear that the detailed history of each intrusive event 
consists of a number of pulses which may have overlapped with other intrusives phases. This has 
resulted in complex geological relationships in some of the drill cores, and numerous short 
intervals (less than a few metres in length) of different lithologies. 

Because the scale of the complexity in some of the drillholes is much finer than the drillhole 
spacing, many lithological intervals cannot be correlated from hole to hole. Therefore, SRK and 
Candente agreed that only lithological intervals exceeding 10 m in length would be modeled 
explicitly.  



SRK Consulting

Based on geological observations by Candente staff, the geological modeling attempted to 
simplify the various pulses of breccias by grouping rock units with similar geological and 
mineralogical characteristics together. One such simplification was applied in areas of the model 
comprising predominantly of breccia (e.g. litho codes: IBXxH, IBXxP or TBx), where short 
intervals of host rock, including mineralized intrusive, were interpreted as blocks (i.e. breccia 
clasts) within the brecciated zone. This is consistent with smaller scale observations from drill 
core.  

Because of the spacing between drillholes and the lack of good surface control on the geology, 
steep geological contacts are not particularly well constrained. In the absence of good constraints, 
they have been interpreted approximately half way between drillholes, where known lithological 
intercepts exist. Resource drilling in early 2008 using angled holes in areas with predominantly 
vertical holes confirmed a number of interpreted contacts. 

A representative E-W cross-section of the geological model is shown in Figure 16.1.

16.2.2 Dyke Zone 

A series of unmineralized porphyritic andesite dykes were interpreted to exist within the 
Cañariaco Norte deposit. Although the dykes can be mapped within intact intrusive units as 
continuous structures, they appear to have been fragmented during the emplacement of the 
mineralised breccia bodies, and therefore cannot be correlated as discrete structures within the 
mineralised area.  

For resource estimation, the dykes were not modelled explicitly. All dyke intersections are part of 
mineralized domains. These waste grade intersections effectively dilute grade of the block 
estimates.  

16.2.3 Base of Natural Leaching 

Because topography is extreme at Cañariaco Norte, and the depth of natural leaching in the 
deposit is highly variable, a normal triangulated surface of the base of natural leaching cuts across 
topography. Only in the streams, where erosion is most pronounced, is leaching absent, so a 
triangulated model would be clearly incorrect. The base of leaching horizon used in the 3D 
geological model was created by taking the surveyed depth below surface of the base of leaching 
in the drillhole database and gridding these data on a 20 m x 20 m grid (minimum curvature) over 
the area of the deposit. For each point in the grid, the leach depth values were subtracted from the 
corresponding topographic elevation, to give the base of leaching horizon. This methodology 
ensures the natural leaching horizon cannot occur above the topographic surface. 

16.2.4 Topography 

The 3D model of the topography is derived from photogrammetrically derived contours created 
from Candente's regional aerial photograph coverage by Horizons South America S.A.C. aerial 
mapping services, Lima. The original dataset was very large, comprising of very closely-spaced 
survey points. Therefore, contour nodes were sampled directly from the Cañariaco Norte area and 
gridded (La Place gridding) in Gemcom software to create a 10 m x 10 m elevation grid. This was 
triangulated and used as a preliminary topographic model. 

Upon comparison with surveyed drillhole collars, the topography was identified to be erroneous 
in several places, probably owing to the effect of the forest canopy on the photogrammetry. 
Candente's surveyors checked drillhole positions in the queried areas and confirmed that the 
topographic survey was in error. Subsequently, Candente's surveyors conducted several ground 
surveys throughout the erroneous area, using a Sokkia total station and several prisms and using 
Horizon's control points outside of the treed areas as a base. These ground survey DTM points 
were added to the photogrammetry DTM data base and the entire DTM set was re-contoured to 
create an acceptable topographic model.

16.2.5 Faults 

The deposit area is known to be affected by a number of sets of geological fractures and faults. 
During the course of the study, SRK produced a 3D model of the major faults within the deposit 
area based on the interpretations of topographic data, aerial photos, field observations and drill 
logs. The fault model is not fully integrated with the lithological model used for resource 
estimation. However, the impact of the faults on the continuity of grade was evaluated on 
6 E-W cross-sections through the deposit, whereupon it was concluded that the known 
intra-deposit faults have negligible effect on the grade at the resolution of the model. Faults were 
therefore ignored during the resource estimation process. 

It should be noted however that, if the deposit is considered for selective mining of higher grade 
areas, the significance of faulting is likely to play a greater role. Therefore, it will be necessary to 
improve the confidence in the position and geometry of any significant faults and geological 
contacts. 

16.2.6 Geological Domains 

Seven geological domains have been modelled. See Table 16.2. 

Table 16.2: Modeled Domain Names and Coding

VC Volcanic 

Once the 3D geological model had been created as described in the Data and Modeling Section, 
the sections and plan views were plotted and compared to the geological section provided by 
Candente for correctness. Sections of the 3D model were plotted with drillhole traces which were 
tagged with both the lithological domains provided by Candente on one side, and the actual solids 
domain the drillhole penetrated in the 3D model on the end. These two columns were compared 
and discrepancies between the two were rectified. The main reason for many of the discrepancies 
was simply because of projections of contacts that caused solids to extend slightly further than 
they should have. Several intermediated sections were created in the 3D model to reduce over 
projection. The final solids model was approved by Candente as a representative model based on 
known geology. Figure 16.2 shows typical cross-section with the modelled domains.

Data Used for Resource Estimation 

The data set used in the resource estimation of Cañariaco Norte deposit consists of a total of 
approximately 31,000 copper and gold assays and  approximately 30,000 silver assays from 
213 drillholes. Almost all assayed samples are from Candente's 2004-2008 drilling campaigns. 
The remaining drillholes were acquired in the seventies and nineties. Altogether, the drillholes 
approximate a drill grid with 60-90 metre spacings. Drillhole collar locations are presented in 
Figure 16.3. 

Within the limits of the interpreted geologic solids, capped assay data were composited to 2 m 
intervals, the most common sample length. Where an assay was reported below the detection 
limit, it was assigned a value equal to half of the detection limit. For statistical analysis and 
resource estimation, missing assays were assigned a grade of 0.0 %. Whenever gaps were 
encountered in sample intervals, waste grades were assigned to these intervals.

16.2.7  Trimming of High Grade Assays 

Block grade estimates may be unduly affected by high-grade outliers. To mitigate this, data can 
be evaluated and treated using two different methodologies: 

Probability plot method: High-grade outliers may be trimmed to values that, on probability 
plots, appear as the lower boundary of a small but very high grade population.

Cutting statistics method: This method is based on the correlation between adjacent assays, 
transformed to indicators for a specific cut-off (an approach similar to indicator kriging). Initially, 
the correlations between assays from adjacent samples are calculated for a very low cut-off. Next, 
the cut-off is increased and the correlation re-calculated. At a particularly high cut-off, the 
correlation approaches zero, suggesting that assays higher than the cut-off exhibit very short 
continuity and should be trimmed to a value that is close to the indicated limit of continuity.  

Both the probability plot and the cutting statistic methods were used in the assessment of 
trimming values. Figure 16.4 shows the plots from assay cutting statistics in the three highest 
grade domains. In the BFP domains, the correlation approaches zero at around 2%. The final 
trimming values are summarised for Cu in Table 16.3 and for gold and silver in Table 16.4. Note 
that the copper metal trimmed in each geological domain is, most of the time, insignificant.

16.2.8 Basic Statistics 

Figure 16.5 shows the basic statistics for copper assays from trimmed and de-clustered 
composites in each geological domain. The highest grades can be found in the BFP domain 
(mean = 0.45 % Cu), followed by the grades in the IBxP and IBxH domains (mean = 0.373 % Cu 
and 0. 337 % Cu, respectively). Figures 16.6 and 16.7 show the basics statistics for gold and 
silver assays from trimmed and de-clustered composites in each geological domain. Note that 
some of the highest assay grades for both gold and silver can be found in the BFP domain.

16.2.9 Variogram Models 

Copper exponential variograms and models were generated for each geological domain. The 
nugget values (i.e., the sample variability at very close distance) were established from down hole 
variograms. The determined nugget values range from 3-10 % of the total sill (Table 16.5). 
(Note: the sill represents the sample variability at a distance beyond which there is no correlation 
in grades). 

The best directions of copper grade continuity were modelled for all domains and showed 
variable results. Some geological domains show best continuity of grade in a sub-horizontal 
direction (e.g. BFP domain, and almost vertical in other domains - e.g. IBxH domain). The 
copper variogram models used in the ordinary kriging estimates are presented in Table 16.5. 
Tables 16.6 and 16.7 show variogram models for gold and silver. Note that best directions of 
continuity for gold or silver are most of the time quite different from those designed for copper. 
This, to some extent, is a reflection of relatively weak correlation between those metals 
(at around 0.50).

16.3 Block Model 

The block model comprises blocks measuring 15 m x 15 m x 15 m in size aligned north-south and 
east-west. The basic geometrical parameters of the block model are summarised in Table 16.8.

16.4 Estimation Parameters 

Copper resource estimations were carried out in two steps. In the first step, blocks in the core of 
the deposit were estimated with parameters restricted by minimum number of holes and octants 
(see Table 16.9). In the second step, more relaxed parameters (e.g., no restriction on number of 
holes) were used to estimate blocks with fewer drillholes in the neighbourhood (see Table 16.10). 
Search radii were established to estimate a large portion of the blocks within the modelled area 
with limited extrapolation. The parameters were established by conducting repeated test resource 
estimates and reviewing the results as a series of plan views and sections.

During the estimation process, after some initial estimation test runs, an approach using a mixture 
of hard and soft domain boundaries was adopted. Soft boundaries allow the copper drillhole 
composite assay grades to influence the estimated grade across geological domains; whereas hard 
boundaries do not. It was identified that some of the longest holes in the Cañariaco Norte deposit 
are, to a great extent, within the BFP domain - where highest grades are found. The influence of 
high grade assays from these drillholes could have unduly affected block estimates in the lower 
grade domains at depth, if the soft boundaries were applied (i.e. causing an artificial upgrade). 
Therefore, in order to prevent undue influence of the data in the higher grade domains (BFP, 
IBxP, IBxH) on blocks within the lower grade domains, hard boundaries were implemented 
between these domains. Table 16.11 shows the logic matrix defining which Cu composites by 
their geology codes (rows) are used in estimating blocks located in specific domains (columns).

Gold and silver estimates were carried out with identical estimation parameters described in 
Tables 16.9 to 16.11. This approach ensured that all blocks estimated for copper were also 
estimated for Au and Ag.

16.5 Bulk Density 

The bulk density database is largely comprised of a set of 9,424 determinations, measured at the 
Chiclayo core facility by Candente on drill core specimens. These data were utilised to calculate 
the average bulk density values for each geological domain. These calculations used values which 
were deemed acceptable (i.e., values lower than 1.8 t/m3 and higher than 3.5 t/m3 were excluded). 

As part of QA/QC program, 251 core samples previously processed by Candente were sent to 
SGS Laboratories, Lima, for an independent verification of the bulk density. Candente's bulk 
density determinations were determined to be slightly higher than those determined by SGS. 
Based on the differences, the average bulk density values calculated for each geological domain 
were consequently adjusted by correction factors, presented in Table 16.12. Constant adjusted 
bulk density values for each geological domain were used in the resource estimates.

16.6 Block Model Validation 

The following validation exercises were carried out on the block model: 

• Comparison of local "well-informed" copper, gold, and silver block grades with Copper, 
gold, and silver composites contained within those blocks. 

• Assessment of the desired variability of Cu block estimates from volume-variance 
relationships. 

• Comparison of average copper, gold, and silver assay grades with average copper, gold, and 
silver block estimates along different directions-swath plots. 

• Comparison of copper Datamine estimates with non-commercial software.

Figure 16.8 shows a comparison of estimated copper block grades with average assay grades 
from the composites contained within those blocks in the IBxP and BFP domains. On average, 
the estimated blocks are very similar to the assays. Unsurprisingly, considering long ranges of 
continuity and low nugget effects, there is excellent correlation between the estimated block 
grades and the assays. A similar relationship is present in all other domains, and for all other 
metals. 

 

Figure 16.8: Comparison of Copper Block Estimates with Average Grade of 
Composite Assays Contained within the Blocks in the IBxP and BFP 
Domains 

Estimated block grades should not only be unbiased, but should also exhibit variability 
comparable to the selective mining unit (SMU) grade variability expected during mining. The 
SMU grade variability during mining can be assessed by an application of an indirect log-normal 
change of support correction (ILC) to the composite assays. The ILC adjustment results in the 
assay distribution mimicking the true block grades. In other words, under ideal circumstances, 
with no dilution taking place during mining, the adjusted grade distribution should be similar to 
the distribution of mined block grades.  

Table 16.13 shows coefficients of variation ("CV") for the estimated grades and the ILC adjusted 
Cu assays. The CV of the copper grades are the ratio of the standard deviation of the Cu grade to 
the mean Cu grade. The CV values from block estimates ("CVe") are much lower than the 
CV values from the adjusted assay distributions ("CVt"). This indicates that, in all domains, the 
estimates are probably too smooth. A more variable resource might result in a minor increase of 
high grade blocks at the expense of a decreased number of lower grade blocks. This type of 
resource would result in slightly lower tonnage and slightly higher grade.

The final check was a comparison of average assay grades with average block estimates along 
different directions. This involved calculating de-clustered average assay grades and comparing 
them with average block estimates along east-west oriented swaths, north-south oriented swaths, 
and horizontal swaths. In the BFP domain, the average copper composite assay grades and the 
average copper estimated block grades are quite similar in all directions, with the assay grades 
slightly lower at some locations (Figure 16.9). This slight difference is probably related to 
difficulty in proper assignment of de-clustering weights. A similar relationship can be shown in 
all other domains, and for all other metals. 

To check if copper estimation parameters entered in Datamine software were applied as intended, 
the Datamine copper block estimates were compared with non-commercial software block 
estimates. When the comparison was made without octant search, the two types of the estimates 
were almost perfectly correlated.

16.7 Mineral Inventory 

Mineral inventory is limited to the Whittle optimized optimistic shell. Limiting the resource to the 
Whittle shell satisfies the regulatory requirement for reporting the resources that have reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction. Input parameters for the Whittle shell are as follows: 

• $2.10/lb Cu; 

• 88% process recovery; 

• $1.45/t mining cost (mineralized and waste rock); 

• $3.80/t processing and G&A cost; 

• $0.36/lb recovered Cu offsite costs; 

• 95% Mining recovery; 

• 5% waste dilution; 

• 40° W, 42° E slope angles. 

It must be noted that the resource shell represents a rough approximation of potentially mineable 
resources using the assumptions shown above. The proposed life of mine plan tonnes and grade 
are shown in Section 18. 

Table 16.14 shows the mineral inventory for the Cañariaco Norte deposit at different copper cut-
off grades. The results of the calculations have been rounded to the nearest million tonnes to 
reflect the uncertainty in the estimation. Figure 16.10 shows the resource shell outline in plan 
view and in section view with the copper block estimated grades on sections 690800 mE and 
9326300 mN.

16.8 Resource Classification 

Block classification was applied to the model using a combination of the average distance to 
composites and number of drillholes contributing to the local estimate. To some extent, the 
classification represents the results of visual assessments on sections and plan views.  

Class I category (measured) was applied to those blocks for which three or more holes 
contributed composites to the copper estimate and the average distance to the composites was less 
than 70 m. This category was assigned to blocks from Step I estimation stage.  

Class II category (indicated) was applied to those blocks for which: 

• Two or more holes contributed composites to the estimate and the average distance to the 
composites was greater than 70 m and lower than 110 m. Only the blocks from the Step I 
estimation stage were assigned (see Section 16.4). 

• The average distance to the composites was less than 60 m for blocks estimated in the Step II 
stage.  

• Class III category (inferred) was applied to all other estimated blocks.  

The assignment of blocks to these categories was visually assessed and additional adjustments 
were made wherever small clusters of blocks were found. These small clusters were removed 
resulting in a smoother model of resource categories. Figure 16.10 shows an example of the 
assigned categories on 325820N section.

16.9 Classified Mineral Resources 

The classified copper, gold and silver mineral resource estimates for the Cañariaco Norte deposit 
is limited to the Whittle resource shell described in Section 16.8 and are tabulated in Table 16.15. 
Limiting the resource to the Whittle shell satisfies the regulatory requirement for reporting the 
resources that have reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The tonnage of each class of 
the resource has been rounded to the nearest million to reflect the uncertainty of the estimates.

16.10  Comparison to Previous Resource Estimates 

Table 16.16 shows the difference between resource estimates reported by Minefill Services in 
April 2007 and the current SRK reported estimates. For comparison, SRK's estimate that is 
unconstrained by the Whittle shell is also included. The differences are the following: 

• In SRK's reported resource, tonnage and contained copper are 8.5% and 12% lower than 
Minefill's estimate, respectively. This is mainly due to the limitation of SRK's reported 
resource within a $2.10/lb Cu Whittle shell. The unconstrained resource is higher than 
estimated by Minefill Services; 

• SRK's resource is based on much larger assay database; 

• SRK's resource is based on the geology model whereas the Minefill Services resource was 
based on grade shell boundary determined in Leapfrog software;  

• The average bulk density used by SRK (2.47 t/m3) is lower than average specific gravity used 
by Minefill Services (2.52 t/m3).

16.11 Resources Extracted in the LOM Plan 

Resources used in the LOM mine plan were estimated to be 518 Mt grading 0.41% Cu, 0.07 g/t 
Au and 1.61 g/t Ag (see Section 18.1 for details). The LOM tonnes and grade are less than the 
overall deposit resource tonnes and grade due different Whittle™ optimization parameters and 
the selction of the most profitable pit shell with the least risk. The Cu grade in the LOM shell is 
lower than the total resource due to a lowering of the cut-off grade to 0.12% Cu from 0.2% Cu.

is to provide recommendations on pit slope stability. This reporting period provides preliminary 
insight into slope design relevant for the PEA stage of study.  

The currently available geotechnical dataset is sufficient for a PEA-level investigation.  

The following sections report on the findings from the 2007-2008 drilling and structural mapping 
campaigns which were designed to upgrade the geotechnical and structural models for the 
Cañariaco Norte deposit. In addition to the 2007-2008 drill data, previous relevant works prior to 
and including 2007 have been considered. The preliminary pit slope design considers two mining 
phases plus a final pit shell (Figure 17.1).  

As part of the geotechnical investigation, the following tasks were completed: 

• The existing geotechnical database (including data prior to November 2007) was compiled 
and edited for observed errors; 

• Candente's logging practices were reviewed and amended where required. Significant data 
collection issues were highlighted and passed onto logging staff during site training visits and 
ongoing correspondence; 

• A dedicated drilling program with core orientation was designed and undertaken to address 
resource (geological), structural and geotechnical uncertainties (see Table 17.1 for details); 

• A laboratory testing schedule was proposed to compliment the point load data library and 
facilitate geotechnical design (testing proposal submitted); 

• Desktop and site structural assessments were completed to aid the generation of a preliminary 
brittle structures model; and 

• Preliminary pit slope design criteria were developed based on available information and 
proposed mining phases.

17.1.1 Geotechnical Data Collection  

Previous Work 

Previous geotechnical work at the Cañariaco site had been undertaken by Minefill Services Inc. 
(Minefill). Minefill issued a "Preliminary Geotechnical Report" in May 2007 which describes 
geotechnical core logging and mapping, rock strength testing (field and laboratory), rock mass 
classification, hydrogeology and kinematic and limit equilibrium analyses (for pit walls). Minefill 
personnel had visited the site in June 2006 to conduct, among other activities, oriented core 
logging combined with training of Candente geologists (in geotechnical core logging). 

Following Minefill's departure from site in 2006, geotechnical core logging has been ongoing. 
Geotechnical mapping has been limited to structural mapping of trench exposures (veins, joints 
and faults).

Core Logging Methodology 

The current Candente geotechnical logging system is based on Bieniawski's 1976 and 1989 
Rock Mass Rating (RMR) System as well as certain components of Barton's Q system (2002). 
After reviewing the current system (through the Candente presentation and descriptions through 
core logging), SRK concluded that geotechnical drill core data is valid and, in general, collected 
properly.

The following core logging procedures were applied for 2007-2008 field programs: 

• In the case of the SRK-prescribed holes, the core is photographed in the split tube at the drill 
platform; 

• Basic (SCR, TCR, RQD) and detailed (including joint conditions and core orientation) 
logging parameters are collected while core is still in the split tube for all geotechnical holes. 
In the case of the delineation, evaluation and pilot holes, this logging was conducted on core 
in core trays, as triple tube drilling is not employed for these holes; 

• Data are entered into SRK-provided spreadsheets (modified after Minefill); 

• Drillcore is transferred to the core trays and again photographed; 

• Laboratory and point load samples are selected, stored and tested as required; and  

• Data are checked (QA/QC) and entered into the central database prior to delivery to SRK.

To complement the on-site point load testing and to obtain correlation factors required for 
adjustment of the point load results, SRK developed a sampling protocol for uniaxial compressive 
strength (UCS) testing. The UCS laboratory testing was designed to focus on strength within the 
geological units, specifically the variability within the alteration zones (e.g. argillic, phyllic). If 
pit depths are to be sufficiently deep, triaxial compression strength tests (TCS) may also be 
warranted. Appropriate samples were selected, wrapped (air tight) and await testing.  

Using the information obtained from the standardized procedures described above, the following 
parameters are generated and considered in the current evaluation: 

• Rock Quality Designation (RQD); 

• Intact rock strength (IRS) and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS); 

• Fracture frequency per metre (FF/m); and 

• Joint conditions (fill, roughness and alteration). 

17.1.2 Preliminary Rock Mass Assessment 

The preliminary rock mass assessment has utilized all available geotechnical drillhole data. Data 
quality of historical drillholes, pre-dating SRK involvement, has not been closely reviewed for 
quality at this time. The confidence in the existing geotechnical dataset is considered fair.  

This preliminary rock mass assessment is constrained by the currently accepted geological model. 
The model isolates seven rock types; all listed with applicable parameter values in Table 17.2. 
Refer to Section 16 for a description of rock types. Appendix A provides histograms of the 
reviewed parameters. 

Data indicate that all rock types exhibit poor to fair rock mass quality characterized by a moderate 
to high degree of fracturing with reduced intact rock strength (from field testing only). Such 
parameters equate to an approximate RMR range of 35-50 (Poor to Fair). Minefill (2007) arrives 
at similar conclusions regarding rock mass quality.

Of significant note with respect to the phasing of open pits, rock mass quality is noted to decrease 
at depth within the core of this deposit. At this time, the spatial and geological controls on this 
degraded rock mass are not fully understood. Figure 17.2 illustrates these trends through RQD 
and FF/m cross sections through the phase 1 and 2 pit shells. For reference, Figure 17.2 also 
indicates the approximate height of the pit highwall in each cross section. The implication is that 
most of the high slopes will potentially have a weaker rock mass foundation. 

17.1.3 Oriented Core Evaluation 

A preliminary review of oriented core data suggests that a significant amount of joint set scatter 
exists. Such results are typical for large porphyry systems which are typically characterized by a 
high degree of fracturing due to the complex genesis of the deposit.  

Minefill's (2007) kinematic analysis determined qualitative failure probabilities for five key 
geological units from six different pit wall orientations. A face dip of 45° was defined which was 
"consistent with the proposed overall slope angle for the Starter pit". The analysis highlighted 
several faces with toppling and planar failure potential. Wedge failure was found to be less 
common. A bench scale analysis was not undertaken due to a lack of density data.  

To complement the earlier Minefill work, a full kinematic analysis should be conducted using 
newly acquired data as the project moves forward to advanced stages.

17.1.4 Structural Geology 

Previous Work 

In addition to work completed by Candente geologists (which is considered in the current model), 
two additional works were considered as part of the brittle structures model generation 
(Caria, 2003 and Murphy, 2004). 

Caria's (2003) initial evaluation of the project discusses the setting of the deposit in a zone of 
brittle trans-tension/extension. Fault orientation is primarily NW-SE and NE-SW. These 
structures are commonly formed in conjugate sets. Based on structural data available at the time, 
Caria implies the principal stress on the region is oriented NE-SW. 

Caria recognizes two phases of faulting; first a WNW-ESE directed set that display mylonitic 
foliation, large displacement and are at low angle. Secondly, Caria recognizes the presence of a 
latter, NNE-SSW set of faults present in the Cañariaco Norte area that "control at least some of 
the hypogene enrichment zone".  

Murphy's (2004) main conclusions regarding the regional structure are based on an extensive 
review of remote sensing data. His findings indicate that four main regional scale fault/structures 
are present at the Cañariaco Norte deposit. These structures are oriented as follows: ENE-WSW, 
NNE-NE, NW-SE, and N-S. Murphy described these structures as linear to curvilinear in surface 
expression and steep to sub-vertical in dip. These structures range from 0.4 – 40 km in length. 
Murphy also identified several sets of additional features at Cañariaco Norte including dykes, 
silicified zones and vein/stock systems. These structures are roughly sub-parallel to the major 
faults and trend NNE-SSW, NE-SW, N-S, ENE-WSW and NNW-SSE. Murphy additionally 
identified the presence of several dome and circular structures of elevated topography in the 
district. Murphy indicated that these domes are likely related to fault controlled magmatic 
intrusions and describes the relationship between these structures and fault intersections. 
He concluded that such structure(s) likely controls much of the mineralization at Cañariaco Norte. 

Regarding the local scale structures at the Cañariaco site, Murphy recognized the primary 
importance of WNW-ESE and N-S trending structures. These structures, indicated by their linear 
to curvilinear surface expression, are sub-vertical to steeply dipping. The intersection of these 
structures is likely of importance in the emplacement of the porphyry bodies and accompanying 
alteration zones.

Current Approach  

As part of the broader geotechnical characterization of the Cañariaco Norte deposit, SRK was 
commissioned by Candente to conduct a study of the structural geology of the deposit area to 
evaluate the risk of failure of the proposed pit slopes along geological structures. 

The planned scope of work was principally focused towards the construction of a 3D brittle 
structures model through the integration of all available data (drillholes, surface maps and 
structural studies of drillholes). If the scope of work is to be extended, the eventual aim is to study 
fracture data on both the large and small scale in order to create geotechnical domains for the 
advanced evaluation of slope stability.  

The main tasks completed to achieve these objectives are as follows: 

• A desktop review of previous structural work. 

• A lineament analysis using available resources including orthophotos and geophysical/remote 
sensing data.  

• Compilation and comprehensive review of Candente's existing geological and geotechnical 
databases (including core photographs) to aid in the identification of significant brittle 
structures. 

• Correlation of drilling data with the lineament analysis and bedrock mapping. 

• Create a preliminary, deposit-scale, 3D brittle structural model. 

The field investigation was carried out over two site visits in November (2007) and June (2008). 
The mapping concentrated on the full geotechnical character of fault and fracture networks, found 
in limited bedrock exposures at the Cañariaco site. This was followed by a review of field 
structural data and 3D modeling of mapping and drillhole data. All geotechnical drilling data, 
along with available core photographs, were reviewed in detail to aid in fault modelling. 

It must be stressed that this structural model represents a first pass 3D wireframe model. Further 
work will be required to improve resolution and accuracy of the model as the project advances.  

Fault Zone Character 

Faults are typically characterized by anastamosing zones, often tens of meters thick, with jointed 
and highly fractured rock bracketed by smaller, cm-scale zones of gouge and cataclastite. 
Figure 17.3 provides examples of typical fault zones observed within the deposit. 

In drillcore, the largest fault zones are characterized by significant lengths (>10 m) of broken 
angular rock fragments.  



SRK Consulting

The smaller, often altered, gouge zones may contain sub-angular to sub-rounded fragments in a 
fine-grained matrix of sand and gravel sized particles plus or minus clay.

Brittle Structures Model 

This study has organized the faults present at Cañariaco Norte into three categories based on 
previous work done by others including Caira (2003), Murphy (2004), the Candente geology 
team and recent work done by SRK. For the purposes of clarity regarding the fault model, faults 
are referred to as "blue", "red" and "green" with each colour code sub-categorized by a series 
number (i.e. "Red 1"). This nomenclature scheme does not reference any system in use by 
Candente or any present geological model, but is merely a way to assist in the creation of the 
SRK fault model. The preliminary fault model is shown in Figure 17.4. 

All the faults have been extended from the centre of the pit (where delineation is most confident). 
The faults have been extended based on average trend and have been truncated against other 
structures where applicable. 

The three classifications are as follows; steeply dipping northwest trending structures (green) that 
may be seen as part of the regional structural fabric, steeply dipping east-west trending structures 
(blue), and north-south trending structures that dip moderately steep to the east (red). Two other 
structures have also been modelled as the grey fault series. A fault matrix is provided as 
Table 17.3 accompanied by detailed description of the modelled faults below. 

• Red faults. North-south (~ 015°) trending (apparently normal) faults dipping at 50-70° are 
present throughout the area (3 faults modelled). This group of faults appears to be offset by 
the Cañariaco Norte (blue) fault system. The red faults exhibit shallower dips (45-55°) south 
of the E-W trending Cañariaco Norte fault system; whereas these faults dip steeper (55-70°) 
to the north of the Cañariaco Norte fault system (good intersections in C08-205, -210 and 
-212). A reasonably high degree of confidence can be placed on the presence of the red faults

as scarps are clearly visible in topography (outcrop scale and DEM). However, frequency 
(especially to the west) and deflection (particularly to the north) are not well understood. 
These faults have been extended (without data backup) to the north and south.

• Green Faults. NW-SE (~310°) trending (apparently slike-slip) faults dipping at ~80° to the 
northeast are present throughout the area (3 faults modelled). A moderate to high degree of 
confidence can be placed in the presence and frequency of these faults. It is probable that the 
NW-SE green fault system is characterized by numerous splays which have not been 
modelled as part of this exercise. Falla Oso is part of the green fault system (good intersection 
in C08-204). The green faults have been extended beyond data limits to the NW and SE.

• Blue Fault (Cañariaco Norte Fault). The blue fault, or the Cañariaco Norte fault, is modelled 
as an E-W trending sub-vertical (apparently strike-slip) fault (075/80S). The fault is 
considered to truncate against the Falla Oso at its eastern extent. A moderate to high degree 
of confidence can be placed in the presence of this fault (good intersections in C06-048 and 
C07-151), but much like Falla Oso, good outcrop exposure is not available. This fault, like 
most in this preliminary model, has been extended (to the west) for planning purposes. 

• Grey Faults. Grey faults (2 modelled) have been generated along the perimeter of the current 
resource pit shell to create extended coverage for drillhole planning. The grey faults include: 
− Grey0 – fault similar to Red fault system (SW quadrant, low confidence) 
− Grey00 – N-S Cañariaco River fault (low-moderate confidence) 

Observations made during model construction indicate that additional structures may be present 
in the Cañariaco Norte system. However, the current dataset does not permit the confident 
modelling of these structures. Of particular note, is a potential feature along the western margin 
of the deposit which is marked by a bedrock scarp. The exact trace of the feature across the 
deposit is not clear at this time (no drillhole intersections) and it is recommended that future 
drilling target this potential feature at depth. This feature is located structurally below mining 
Phase 1 but may have an impact on mining Phase II.

17.1.5 Design Considerations 

The review of available information has yielded several elements that must be considered as part 
of the preliminary slope design. These elements are discussed below. 

Topography and Highwall Heights 

Extreme topography combines with the currently accepted slopes to create extensive highwalls in 
mining Phases 1 and 2 (Figure 17.1). For the initial two mining phases, the western highwall is 
particularly significant with slopes exceeding 650 m height in Phase 2 (approximately 450 m for 
Phase 1). 

Benchmark studies compiled by Hoek et al. (2004) suggest that other slopes with similar highwall 
heights are experiencing stability problems with overall slope angles between 35 and 45° (Figure 
17.5). The paper also reported that, in general, weak rock mass slopes at such heights are not 
found to typically exceed 40º overall slope angles. As rock mass quality is in question at this 
stage of the investigation, slope height is also considered a significant risk at Cañariaco Norte. 
Note that the western highwall for mining Phase 2 (ast 650 m) is similar to slopes at 
Chuquicamata.

Hoek et al., 2004)  

Reduced Rock Mass Quality in Slope Toes 

In addition to significant slope highwalls described above, rock mass quality in the base of the 
proposed slopes is also highlighted as a technical risk.

Elevated jointing and fracturing (as illustrated in Figure 17.2) is compounded by reduced rock 
mass strength, likely due to alteration, in the slope toes of the currently proposed mining phases, 
particularly in Phase 2 (Figure 17.6).

Hydrogeology 

It is anticipated that saturated rock mass conditions will be encountered during development of 
the mine. Slope depressurization programs are likely to be an integral part of the slope stability 
design. A well engineered depressurization program may increase the achievable slope angles.  

Ground Water International (GWI) was contracted by Candente in 2006 to initiate environmental 
baseline and environmental impact analysis studies related to the hydrogeology of the open pit 
and mine waste areas. To date, most of the field work has focused on the hydrogeological 
characterization of the pit area. Hydrogeologic mapping and spring surveys have been carried out 
within the pit area and other areas which were previously designated for leach pads and waste 
dumps, however, several changes were made to the mine plan over the last two years which have 
required mapping of a new waste dump area and a new tailings facility area. Hydrogeological 
mapping of these new areas need to be carried out during baseflow conditions which are expected 
to begin after April 2009. The following information summarizes the hydrogeological 
investigations of the proposed pit, the conceptual ground water flow model, and preliminary pit 
inflow estimations.

Key hydrogeological issues to be addressed at the Cañariaco Norte project include: 

• Potential for poor drainage of the pit slopes within the less permeable blocks as the pit 
develops;  

• Potential for high inflows from ground water sources along fault zones, particularly if 
transmissivity of fault zones extends below the Cañariaco River level; 

• High precipitation in the area with related high precipitation rates to the pit; 

• Potential impacts on baseflows and water quality of the Cañariaco River due to pit 
dewatering efforts; 

• Potential water quality impacts to the Cañariaco River from mine waste facilities; 

• Potential for poor water quality from the pit slopes; and 

• Closure issues related to pit lake and mine waste areas. 

In general, the host rocks associated with the deposit consist of andesites and dacite tuffs which 
have been intruded by three phases of intrusives. The principal intrusive phase containing the 
copper mineralization is a large quartz feldspar porphyry which was later intruded by a 
hydrothermal breccia phase. Regional length fault zones cross through the ore body with a 
NW-SE direction (e.g. Quebrada Oso). Medium length fault zones interconnect these regional 
faults with orientations of NE-SW, and another set between NS and NNW-SSE. Circular fault 
zones are also present surrounding the porphyry deposit. The fault zones are believed to have 
significantly higher permeabilities compared to the less fractured rock blocks. 

The wet season at the project area is from November to April and the average annual precipitation 
ranges between approximately 1,000 mm/yr within the lowest elevations around the open pit to as 
high as 2,000 mm in the upper reaches of the existing catchment areas. Rainfall runoff in the open 
pit footprint area currently reports mainly to two deeply incised gullies (Quebradas) known as 
Quebrada Oso and Quebrada Norte which report to the Cañariaco River and its alluvial aquifer. 
These quebradas are fault controlled and have great significance with respect to ground water 
movement. 

The upper organic horizon is more porous and permeable than the underlying residual and 
colluvial soils promoting lateral ground water flow. Discharge from this horizon is at springs and 
surface water features. Springs also form in areas where the lateral flow in the leached cap 
intersects the ground surface. This localized seepage mechanism, known as interflow, lasts 
between days to weeks and could therefore be included as a component of surface runoff for 
water balance calculations. Recharged water which bypasses the upper soil layers infiltrates to the 
leached cap and percolates to the water table which ranges between 0 m in the quebradas to as 
much as 112 m in ridge areas. Strong flowing artesian conditions were found within the

quebradas when crossing fault zones. The maximum water table fluctuation within the pit was 
approximately 10 m. 

The main source of stream flow in the dry season is base flow resulting from release of ground 
water storage recharged during previous wet months as base flow. Some of the percolated water 
discharges along with surface runoff to surface water drainage during the wet season and the 
remainder discharges gradually during the dry season. Normally the dry season base flow 
discharge is highest at the start of the dry season with gradual tapering off to the annual lowest 
flows during August and September as ground water levels in the soil and bedrock decline. 
Fluctuations in ground water level and discharge lag rainfall by a few months as the first rains 
recharge storage depleted by baseflow during the dry season. The current average baseflow to 
Quebrada Oso and Norte is approximately 40 l/sec. 

The local ground water flow direction is east toward the Cañariaco River and the regional ground 
water flow direction is north towards more major drainages. The local recharge areas related to 
the Cañariaco Norte deposit are defined by the ridges to the northwest and south.  

Ground water preferentially percolates laterally down slope within the leached cap before 
infiltrating to the underlying fractured rock. Fracturing within the porphyry deposit is moderate to 
high based on diamond drilling data. Fracturing within the volcanics, close to the intrusives, is 
also moderate to high with better rock quality found further away from the intrusives. In general, 
the hydraulic conductivities, based on 43 packer tests in and around the open pit, ranged from 
moderate to very low (10-5 to 10-10 m/sec). The highest hydraulic conductivities were associated 
with fault zones within Quebradas Oso and Norte. The mean hydraulic conductivities of the 
geologic units ranged from 10-6 to 10-8 m/sec. No correlation could be made between permeability 
and rock type or alteration. Most of the recharge to the mountainous areas is expected to 
discharge slowly to the valley floor, however, some relatively rapid movement is expected to 
occur along transmissive fracture zones, tectonic breccias, and possibly through sub-vertical 
fracture sets aligned parallel to the quebradas. The fracture zones associated with the faults within 
Quebradas Oso and Norte are considered to be the most prominent ground water drainages.  

The Cañariaco Norte pit is expected to have final dimensions of approximately 3.0 km x 2.5 km. 
Local hydrogeological conditions will prevail until mining extends below the river level at 
approximately 2,660 m when regional groundwater flow will be hydraulically captured by the 
open pit. The base of the final pit will be approximately 250 m below river level. It is uncertain 
what the hydraulic conditions are below this level. It is estimated that approximately 10% of 
rainfall recharges the bedrock system for the local catchment area. Ground water inflow rates will 
increase with deepening of the pit so inflow rates will increase throughout mine life. Analytical 
and preliminary numerical estimates of ground water inflow range from approximately 100 l/sec 
to 200 l/sec for the fully developed pit. These inflow rates are quite manageable. However, due to 
the large size of the pit and high seasonal rainfall conditions in the area, rainfall directly to the pit

PEA Technical Report Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 160 

GED/HA 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM November 30, 2008 

  

is expected to range from < 100 to 500 l/sec for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. This 
assumes average annual rainfall to the pit is 1500 mm, average monthly rainfalls in the range of 
<50 mm (low) to 240 mm (high), and 30% evaporation losses within the pit. Hence, combined 
ground water and rainfall ingress is expected to be in the range of 200 l/sec during the dry season 
to 600 l/sec during the peak wet season at the end of mine life. 

During operation, mine dewatering and pit wall depressurization efforts need to be made ahead of 
the pit advancement. This will consist of a combination of in-pit dewatering wells, external 
dewatering wells and in-pit horizontal drains. The design and costing for mine dewatering is 
outside of our current scope of work as it falls within the scope of feasibility.  

Once mining has ceased, ground water levels will recover with time and stabilize at a new 
elevation which will be controlled by the spill point at the east side of the pit. Outflows at the spill 
point have yet to be estimated. Potential for ARD exists from the pit walls which could 
significantly affect the water quality of the pit lake. 

Alteration and Weathering 

For mineral deposits associated with hydrothermal processes, Hoek et al (2004) indicate that 
alteration can have a significant impact on both the rock material and the discontinuity state 
compared with the unaltered host rocks. In some areas similar to Cañariaco Norte, mineral 
deposits are often surrounded by a halo of strongly altered rock and the impact on rock mass 
strength, and hence slope stability, is significant (especially if these zones are in the proposed 
slope foundations). Multiple brecciation events, combined with advanced supergene alteration, 
have potentially enhanced these affects at Cañariaco Norte. 

The spatial relationship between alteration and rock strength remains in question at this stage of 
the investigation. However, a detailed review of core photos suggests that rock strength is 
strongly affected by the type and intensity of alteration. An alteration model should be completed 
as this study advances so this relationship can be better understood in a spatial sense. 

Degradation of rock mass quality due to weathering is also evident at Cañariaco Norte. The 
influence of supergene weathering (manifested as saprolite) is observed to depths exceeding 50 m 
in certain areas (Figure 17.6). Slope management along highwall crests will require additional 
attention, and likely reduced slope angles, to mitigate this issue.

17.1.6 Preliminary Slope Design Recommendations 

The following slope design recommendations focus on the currently proposed mining phases for 
Cañariaco Norte. Pit slope design recommendations are based on the following data: 

• Previous reporting on pit slope design guidelines (primarily Minefill, 2007); 

• Brittle structures model (built from previous work, lineament analysis, mapping and core 
logging); and 

• Current rock mass parameter assessment. 

The following conclusions have been reached regarding the slope design recommendations: 

• This initial structures model combines all relevant data sources to produce a 3D wireframe 
model to aid in pit design. The modelled structures are characterized by a complex network 
of broad, anastamosing fault zones. Although structures are present throughout the deposit, a 
series of east dipping in the west wall of the deposit represent the greatest technical risk for 
slope design. Slope angles on the western highwalls have been reduced to reflect this. 

• The rock mass assessment indicates a high degree of fracturing in the lower levels of the 
deposit (below 2,600 masl). This level coincides with the slope toes of the Phase 2 and final 
mining phases. Highwall slope angles have been reduced to account for these rock mass 
quality issues.  

• Rock strength is regarded as low, but spatially it remains difficult to define the domains 
hosting the weakest zones. The development of an alteration model and the advancement of a 
laboratory strength testing program will aid in improving the understanding of rock strength 
in the deposit.  

• Dewatering of slopes must be considered as static water levels indicate that saturated rock 
mass conditions are to be expected during all phases of mining (below ~50 m). 

Considering these findings, Table 17.4 details basic slope design criteria which have been 
established for this study stage. As Phase 1 slopes are both considered to be temporary and of 
lower overall height, more aggressive angles are proposed (relative to Phase 2). It is 
recommended that Phase 1 overall slopes between 0 – 200 m height be designed to angles no 
greater than 45°. Between 200 – 300 and >300 m it is recommended that Phase 1 overall slopes 
be designed to 40° and 38°, respectively. It is also recommended that Phase 2 slopes less than 
200 m height be designed to 40° and slopes exceeding 200 m be designed to 38°. Final phase 
slopes beyond Phase 2 are not considered at this time. 

It should be noted that these angles are lower than the 45° overall slope angles previously 
proposed for the "Starter pit" by Minefill (2007). This reduction in slope angles has arisen from 
the identification of additional risk factors including:

• The presence of adverse structures in the western highwall; 

• Poor rock mass quality including elevated fracturing and reduced rock mass strength within 
the toe of the Phase 2 pit; and 

• Several technical risks including the spatial relationship between alteration and rock mass 
strength.

Net Smelter Return Model 

The 3D SRK mineral resource block model was used as the basis for deriving the economic pit 
limit for the Cañariaco Norte model. A number of calculations were performed on the model in 
order to determine the net smelter return (NSR) of each individual block. These parameters are 
summarized in Table 18.1. 

The NSR calculations took into account the following factors: 

• Mineralized Zone grades (Cu, Au, and Ag), thus taking into account the variability in the 
precious metal content of the deposit (on a whole block basis); 

• Process recoveries;   

• Operating costs; 

• Contained metal in concentrate; 

• Deductions and Payable Metal Value; 

• Metal prices; 

• Freight costs (shipping, trucking, insurance); 

• Smelting and refining charges (TC/RC); and 

• Royalty charges.

18.1.2 Economic Pit Limit 

The ultimate economic pit limit was based on a Whittle pit optimization evaluation of the 
resources in the NSR model. This evaluation included the aforementioned NSR calculations as 
well as geotechnical parameters and mining/milling costs. The economic pit limit included 
measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources.

The base case economic parameters mentioned above were used to calculate cut-off grades for the 
Cañariaco Norte deposit (see Table 18.2 below). The incremental cut-off grade incorporates all 
operating costs except mining. This cut-off is applied to material contained within an economic 
pit shell where the decision to mine a given block was determined by the Whittle optimization. 
This incremental cut-off of 0.12 %Cu was applied to all of the mineral resource estimates that 
follow.

The results indicate a significant increase in the incremental strip ratio beyond pit shell 15. Shells 
beyond 21 add mineralized rock and waste tonnages to the overall pit but have higher incremental 
strip ratios with diminishing effects on the overall NPV.  

To better determine the optimum Whittle shell on which to base the pit phasing and scheduling, 
and to gain a better understanding of the deposit, the shells were analyzed in a preliminary 
schedule. The schedule assumed a maximum milling capacity of 75,000 tonnes/day. No 
stockpiles were used in the analysis and no capital costs were added. Both best case (mine out 
pit 1, the smallest pit, and then mine out each subsequent pit shell from the top down, before 
starting the next pit shell) and a worst case (mine each bench completely before starting next 
bench) scenarios were analyzed. The shells were each scheduled at varying revenue factors 
(0.3 through to 1.4 of base case) to produce a series of nested pit with the NPV results shown in 
Figures 18.1 through 18.3 above. 
 

Based on the analysis of the Whittle pit shells and preliminary schedule, Whittle pit shell 15 was 
chosen as the base case shell for further pit phasing and scheduling. Table 18.5 and 18.6 below 
summarizes the tonnages and grades contained within the shell limits (using the incremental 
cut-off grade of 0.12% Cu, and a dilution factor of 5%). Tables 18.7 and 18.8 further summarize 
the Cañariaco Norte pit by rock types for both ore and waste. 

A typical section (looking west) is shown in Figure 18.4 with existing ground, a number of 
Whittle shells, leach-cap surface, drillholes and block model outlines shown.

18.1.5 Mine Design 

Mine planning for the Cañariaco Norte deposit was conducted using a combination of Mintec 
Inc., MineSight™ software and Gemcom GEMS™ software. The base 3-D block model was 
produced by SRK, along with subsequent NSR modeling using GEMS™. The phase design and 
production scheduling was undertaken with the use of MineSight™ software. 

A preliminary pit design, along with the associated pit phasing, was then based on the Whittle 
shell analysis described in this report. Preliminary waste dumps were then designed to account for 
the material produced in each mining phase. 

Whittle pit shell 15 was chosen as the base case pit design for the Cañariaco Norte zone. 
Figure 18.5 represents a plan view of this pit design for the base case Whittle shell with a typical 
cross section through the pit design as shown in Figure 18.6.

Mine Operation 

The open pit mining activities for the Cañariaco Norte pit were assumed to be undertaken by the 
owner as the basis for this preliminary economic assessment. The unit rate used in the Whittle 
optimization was $1.22 per tonne of waste and $1.18 per tonne of mill feed for pit and dump 
operations, road maintenance, mine supervision and technical services cost based on experience 
of similar sized "bulk mining" operations. 

Equipment 

The major mining equipment requirements are indicated in Table 18.9 and are based on similar 
sized open pit operations. The proposed plant processing rate of 75,000 tpd was used to estimate 
the mining equipment fleet needed. The fleet has an estimated maximum capacity of 150,000 tpd 
total material, which will be sufficient for the life-of-mine plan.

Unit Operations 

The 12.25" diameter drill performs the majority of the production drilling in the mine. The 
hydraulic drill with a 3.5" diameter bit is to be used for secondary blasting requirements and may 
be used on the tighter spaced patterns required for pit development blasts. The main loading and 
haulage fleet consists of Cat 793C- 240 ton haul trucks, which are loaded primarily with the 
electric 24 yd3 shovel or the Cat 994, 26 yd3 wheel loader, depending on pit conditions. As pit 
conditions dictate, the Cat D11R and Cat D10R dozers are used to rip and push material to the 
excavators, as well as maintaining the waste dumps.  

The additional equipment listed in Table 18.10 will be used to maintain and build access roads, 
and to meet various site facility requirements, (including coarse mill feed stockpile maintenance 
and further exploration development).

The work schedule is based on two twelve hour shifts, seven days a week, 365 days per year.  

18.1.6 Production Schedule 

Mine Sequence/Phasing 

The base case Whittle pit shell 15 for the Cañariaco Norte model was divided into three phases 
for the mine plan development to maximize grade in the early part of the schedule, reduce 
pre-stripping requirements, while providing the required mill feed production per period. Phase 1 
was designed to mine the highest grade material in the Cañariaco Norte deposit in the early part 
of the mine plan. The Phase 2 southern boundary was defined by the river valley of Quebrada 
Norte. The final phase sees the southern flank of the deposit mined out to final limits. The phase 
tonnages and associated grades and metal recoveries of the Cañariaco Norte pit are summarized 
in Table 18.11, while a breakdown of waste material types is summarized in Table 18.12.

Figure 18.7 further summarizes the phase designs, with the phase layout shown in both 
Figure 18.8 (plan view) and in north-south section in Figure 18.9 (this includes the block model 
display with grey representing copper grade less than 0.2%; green being copper grade between 
0.2 and 0.5%; and red being copper grades of 0.5% or higher).  

The pit phases were roughly based on the Whittle pit shells 06 and 15. The Norte pit waste 
(includes PAG rock, non-PAG rock and Leach-cap) will be placed into a waste dump adjacent to 
the final pit limits in the Cañariaco River Valley. All process plant feed rock will be hauled to the 
primary crusher to the north of the pit.

Mine Production Schedule 

The production schedule for the Cañariaco Norte deposit model was developed with the aid of 
MineSight™ software, and incorporated the three phases mentioned above. 

The plant throughput was planned at 75,000 tonnes per day (tpd) for a net yearly production of 
27.4 mt of ore. Pre-production stripping was planned to occur within Year -1, with Year 1 
representing the commencement of processing (throughput projected at 80% of maximum). The 
maximum amount of planned total material to be moved was approximately 150,000 t/day. The 
average total mining rate was planned to be 105,000 t/day. Measured, indicated and inferred 
resources were used in the LOM plan, however, inferred resources represent only 7% of the 
material mined and processed. The resources calculated included an external dilution of 5%.  

Table 18.12 below is a summary of total material movement by year for the mine production 
schedule.

The Cañariaco Norte mine will produce a total of 518 million tonnes (Mt) of mill feed and 278 
Mt of waste rock over a 21-year mine operating life (yielding an overall strip ratio of 0.54:1 (t:t). 
The mine schedule focuses on achieving the required plant feed production rate, mining of higher 
grade material early in schedule, while balancing grade and strip ratios. Due to the confined 
physical constraints of the property, minimal stockpile capacity will be available for blending 
purposes and as such no blending of stockpiled material has been included in this preliminary 
schedule. The Cañariaco Norte pit is most economical when phases are mined concurrently. 
Figure 18.10, 18.11 and 18.12 summarize pit tonnages, strip ratios and grade by period.

18.2 Mineral Processing 

18.2.1 Process Plant Design 

The results available to date of the metallurgical testing program and knowledge of similar ore 
deposits in the region were used to develop the design criteria and process flow sheets for the 
Order of Magnitude Study prepared by Samuel Engineering. The simplified process block flow 
diagram is included herein.  

18.2.2 Description 

The process flow sheet and plant design represents a conventional copper flotation concentrator. 
The process selected to produce a final copper concentrate product will include the following four 
circuits within the plant: comminution; flotation; cleaning and filtering. The generated tailings 
will be discharged to a tailings storage facility (TSF). Water will be reclaimed from the TSF for 
reuse in the process. The process plant was designed with capacity of 81,522 tonnes per day and a 
nominal capacity of 75,000 tonnes per day with an annual design throughput of 27,375,000 
tonnes per year. The process plant site is adjacent to the mine pit and approximately 8 km away 
from the TSF. 

Comminution Circuit 

The comminution circuit is composed of single stage crushing, open ore storage, single SAG mill 
and two ball mills as described below.

GD/ha 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM  November 30, 2008

Crushing  

Run-of-mine ore will be transported and dumped from 218 tonne haul trucks. The dump station is 
of a double dump design allowing two trucks to stage at the crusher.  

However, only one truck will discharge at a time into a dump pocket that in turn feeds directly 
into a 1,524 mm x 2,261 mm (60 inch x 89 inch) primary gyratory crusher.  

Coarse Plant Feed Stockpile 

The crushed plant feed rock will be conveyed to a conical stockpile via a stacking belt conveyor. 
This open pile will has a live capacity of 75,000 tonnes and a total capacity of approximately 
400,000 tonnes. Crushed plant feed rock will be reclaimed from this stock pile via three below 
grade apron feeders which transfer the material to a SAG mill feed belt conveyor.  

Grinding  

The grinding circuit first receives the Plant feed rock into the single semi-autogenous grinding 
(SAG) mill. This SAG mill is comprised of one, 11.582 m diameter x 5.791 m long (38 ft x 19 ft) 
mill with an estimated power draw of 14.9 MW. The SAG mill discharges through a trommel 
screen from where the screen oversize (critical) reports back to the SAG mill for additional 
grinding. The underflow reports to a cyclone feed sump where the flow is split between two 
cyclone classification units employed to produce the desired particle size distribution of 80% 
passing product size of 125 microns (µm). The oversize material reports to one of the two 
dedicated ball mills. Each ball mill is a 7.62 m diameter x 12.2 m long (25 ft x 40 ft) with an 
estimated power draw of 13.4 MW. The product will continue to the flotation circuit. 

Flotation Circuit 

The flotation circuit follows the comminution circuit and will be composed of rougher, scavenger 
and cleaner flotation circuits as described below.  

Rougher Flotation Circuit 

The cyclone overflow from the grinding line will be split and fed to two rougher flotation lines. 
Each rougher flotation cell bank will consist of eight (8), 250 m3 tank cells which will provide 
24 minutes residence time. The rougher concentrate will report to a regrind circuit consisting of 
six (6) 933 kW tower mills prior to the cleaner circuit. Tailings from the rougher flotation circuits 
will be combined and sent to the scavenger flotation circuit.

Scavenger Flotation Circuit 

The scavenger flotation circuit consists of two (2) banks of four (4), 250 m3 tank cells which will 
have approximately 12 minutes of residence time. Concentrate from the scavenger circuit will 
report to the regrind circuit. The concentrate from the rougher and scavenger cells will be 
reground to 80% passing 35 microns before being pumped to the cleaner circuit. Tails from the 
scavenger circuit will report to the tailings thickener. 

Cleaner Flotation Circuit 

The 1st cleaner flotation circuit will receive the regrind cyclone overflow at 80% passing 
35 microns. The 1st cleaner flotation circuit will consist of eight (8), 5.49 m x 10.97 m 
(18 ft x 36 ft) column-type float cells having a volume (with froth factor) of 260 m3 each and a 
15 minute residence time. The 1st cleaner underflow will be transferred to the cleaner/scavenger 
flotation circuit which consists of six (6), 160 m3 tank cells. After a 15 minute residence time, the 
reclaimed concentrate will be transferred back to the 1st cleaner feed distribution box. The 
tailings from the cleaner/scavenger will report to the tailings thickener. 

The concentrate from the 1st cleaner flotation transfers to the 2nd cleaner flotation circuit that 
will consist of five (5), 5.49 m x 10.97 m column type cleaner cells having a volume (with froth 
factor) of 260 m3 each. The residence time in this circuit is estimated to be 12 minutes. Tails from 
the 2nd cleaner circuit will be sent back to the 1st cleaner circuit. Concentrate from the 2nd cleaner 
will report to the 3rd cleaner flotation circuit.  

The 3rd cleaner flotation feed circuit will consist of three (3), 5.49 m x 10.97 m (18 ft x 36 ft) 
flotation columns having a volume (with froth factor) of 260 m3 and an estimated residence time of 
10 minutes. Tails from the 3rd cleaner circuit will report back to 2nd cleaner flotation. Concentrate 
from the 3rd cleaner will report to the copper concentrate thickener. 

Copper Concentrate Thickening, Filtration, Storage 

Final copper concentrate at 25% solids from the 3rd cleaner flotation concentrate stream will be 
thickened to 60% in one (1), 30 m diameter high-rate thickener. The thickened copper concentrate 
will be pumped to the one of two (2) vertical pressure type dewatering filters. The filter overflow 
will be sent back to the concentrate thickener from where it will be recycled back into the 
process.

Copper concentrate filter cake containing 8% moisture will report to the covered copper 
concentrate stockpile via the copper concentrate stacking belt conveyor. A front-end loader will 
be used to reclaim concentrate and load it into copper concentrate transport trucks for transport to 
the port. 

Reagents 

The reagents handling and distribution systems to be used within the process include lime, 
flocculant, collector and frother.  

Lime 

Bulk lime will be delivered to site via truck in a form of quicklime. This will be slaked on site to 
produce reagent in a milk-of-lime consistency that is required in the process. Milk-of-lime will be 
used as pH control. The slaked lime will be added to the process at various rates to the grinding 
circuit and the copper concentrate thickening circuit.  

Flocculant 

Flocculant will be delivered dry to site via truck in 1 tonne super-sack containers and mixed and 
distributed to its respective end user. It is anticipated that flocculant will be required at both the 
tailings thickeners and the copper concentrate thickener. Additional solid-liquid separation test 
work should be performed to determine which flocculant will be required.  

Collector  

Primary collector will be delivered by trucks and unloaded to a storage tank via unloading pump. 
The collector will be metered into the rougher and cleaner flotation circuits. Thionocarbamate 
AP 3894 will be used in the process as the primary collector.  

Frother 

Frother will be delivered to site by trucks and unloaded to a storage tank via an unloading pump. 
Transfer pumps will feed the frother to one of two respective head tanks for metering into the 
rougher flotation circuit or the copper cleaner flotation circuit. Methyl Isobutyl Carbinol (MIBC) 
will be used in the process as a frother. 

Tailings 

The scavenger flotation tailings and cleaner/scavenger flotation tailings will be combined in a 
tailings thickener for water recovery. The thickener underflow slurry will then be pumped a 
distance of approximately 8 km to the tailings storage facility (TSF). Additional water will be 
reclaimed from the TSF and pumped back to the process plant for reuse.

Process Design Criteria 

Appendix B contains a list of the process design criteria used to establish the process for a 
75,000 tpd operation process facility. 

18.3 Infrastructure and Site Layout 

Airstrip  

The closest existing airstrip is at Chiclayo located approximately 150 km by road away from the 
project. No airstrip is currently under consideration for this project. 

Communications 

There is no established land-based communications system at the site. It is proposed that a 
satellite based system will be utilized.  

Fuel and Lube Supply  

The site will incorporate a fuel farm with workshop lube system at the process plant location. 
The fuel farm facility will be a separate stand-alone unit, designed to service the demand for 
medium and light equipment re-fuelling. A workshop lube system will be located adjacent to the 
workshop to handle all associated maintenance fluids, grease, oil, antifreeze, air, and waste oil. 
The storage facilities equipment will be located outdoors on a concrete pad with walled spill 
containment. Fuel and lubricants will need to be transported to the site via over-the-road truck 
carriers. 

Fire Protection  

Fire protect for the facilities will comprise a fire water reserve and a fire water distribution system 
around the site in the form of underground fire mains, loops or grids, as dictated by the 
arrangement layout. All plant processes and facilities are to be protected with fire water by either 
fire hydrants or fixed fire protection systems. Fire water will be provided by a fresh water supply 
pond. Fire hydrants, hose reel cabinets, wheeled fire extinguishers, hand-held fire extinguishers, 
and sprinkler systems will be strategically located throughout the site to provide the required fire 
protection.  

Sewage Treatment  

A sanitary sewer network and treatment facilities will be included in the process plant facility 
design. Septic systems with leach fields are proposed. The sewage collection network and 
treatment system should be designed for an average wastewater dry weather flow and in 
accordance with local and regional government health regulations.

Water Supply  

Fresh water will be sourced from the fresh water reservoir located upstream of the waste dump in 
the Cañariaco River valley. This waterway flows year-round and it is expected to be able to 
provide the necessary water supply for the operation. From here water will be taken to a separate 
fresh water supply pond located near the process area. The pond will be designed to service the 
process water, potable water and fire protection system requirements. The potable water supply 
will be treated and stored in a separate tank prior to distribution though the plant facilities. 

Site Buildings  

Administration Building  

The Administration Building is anticipated to be made from a series of interconnecting modules 
for ease of construction. It will be sized to accommodate the personnel for all working shifts. The 
facility will have individual staff offices, meeting/training rooms, toilets, storage, weather center, 
radio/logistical control, first aid facilities, and the change house for plant operators and 
maintenance personnel.  

Laboratory  

The laboratory will be separate from the plant offices to provide a level of security and safety. 
The laboratory will be designed for four essential functions:  

• Assay analysis to support the mine and mill operations;  

• Establishing the mill copper balance;  

• Metallurgical testing to investigate improvements, and  

• Environmental testing and monitoring.  

The lab facility will be divided into offices for lab staff, meeting rooms, toilets, safety and first 
aid facilities, and the analytical and chemical laboratories with supporting sample and chemical 
storage rooms. The laboratory will be sized to accommodate all testing requirements for the 
project.  

Warehouse, Workshop and Storage Yard  

The maintenance and warehousing complex will be composed of two buildings. One part of the 
workshop is dedicated to the small- and medium-rolling stock used by the process operations. 
The remaining area of the  workshop will be set up to perform repair service for the process 
equipment and house a machine shop, rubber repair shop, electrical shop, and instrumentation 
repair shop. A dedicated warehouse will provide internal parts storage and adjacent to this 
building will be a fenced compound that will store bulk items and large equipment, as necessary.

Gatehouse and Weigh-Scale  

A gatehouse and truck weigh-scale will be located at the main entrance to the project site for 
traffic and inventory control. This area will be equipped with one weigh station to monitor both 
incoming and outgoing traffic. This area controls the access to the process plant facilities. 

Access Road 

The project site will be accessed from Chiclayo via the old Pan-American highway north, past 
Motupe to Olmos and then east along the Corral Quemado paved highway to a point 
approximately 60 km east of the town of Olmos, where the Cañariaco mine access road will 
begin. Development of the Cañariaco mine will require construction of a new 50 km access road, 
from the existing paved highway to the mine site. From the Corral Quemado highway, the access 
road will follow the Yerma Valley south to the mine site.  

This road will be required for the transport of equipment, materials and personnel during the 
construction period. During subsequent operation, the road will be used for the transport of 
operating personnel and supplies to the mine site and the transport of concentrate from the plant 
to the concentrate load-out port. Within the project site, the access road alignment will be such 
that the road will also serve as the connector between the process plant and the tailings 
containment facility. The tailings and reclaim water pipelines will be placed alongside the road 
and thereby eliminate the need for an additional access road.  

The preliminary road design calls for an all weather gravel surface road, 7 m wide, with one 
pullout per kilometre to allow for stopping and passing. The road will be designed to 
accommodate heavy and oversize loads during the construction period and regular inbound and 
outbound transport requirements during operation. The road will be designed for 75 tonne loads 
with maximum grades of 9% and a travel speed of 35 km/hr. One bridge and a number of culverts 
will be required along the new access road. 

Camp 

Employees at Cañariaco will be housed on site in a permanent camp facility. There are no major 
towns within daily commuting distance of the mine, which can provide the amenities to house 
and support the number of employees that will be required for mine operations. As well, an 
on-site camp will eliminate the need to provide transport for employees to the mine from their 
home communities on a daily basis. The permanent camp will be sized to accommodate 
approximately 450 to 500 employees and will provide designated accommodations for technical, 
management and labour personnel. Separate accommodations will be provided for male and 
female employees. The camp will include dining and recreational facilities. The camp will likely 
be located within walking distance of the process plant and mine administration buildings; 
however, transport may be required for employees during the wet season.

A very large camp will be required to house the construction personnel. Most of the construction 
camp will be temporary ATCO-type structures that will be removed upon completion of 
construction. It is envisioned the permanent camp will be constructed early in the construction 
period so that it can be used initially for construction and made available to operations and 
commissioning staff as they are assigned to the site. 

Power Supply 

The Cañariaco Norte mine operation will require a power supply of approximately 85 MW, based 
on an average power draw of 70 to 75 MW and a peak load of 80 to 85 MW. Power will be 
supplied from the Peruvian national grid system. 

An independent study by CESEL Engenieros, a private Peruvian electrical power consulting firm, 
states that the national grid should be able to supply the Cañariaco Norte power requirement.  

Cañariaco Norte will need to construct a new 220 KV power transmission line to the existing 
220 KV grid at the Carhuaquero sub-station, 57 km south of the minesite. Two other grid supply 
alternatives were assessed by CESEL: a 138 KV transmission line from Carhuaquero and a 
138 KV line from Derivación. The 220 KV line from Carhuaquero was selected as it was the 
lowest capital cost option and it would be capable of supporting potential future increases in 
power transmission requirements. 

Explosive Storage  

Explosives and blasting agents required for mining will be stored at permitted locations to the 
west of the pit and process plant, at the safe distance from personnel and operating activities.  

Explosives will be stored in certified magazines with adequate separation.  

Ammonium nitrate ("AN") prills shipped in bulk tankers will be stored in designated silos. An 
emulsion storage plant facility will be located adjacent to the prill storage silos to accommodate 
the storage of specialty bulk blasting mixes, and the efficient delivery to the open pit via purpose 
built delivery trucks. 

Port Facility 

The Cañariaco project will produce an average of 350,000 to 400,000 dry tonnes per year of 
copper concentrate. The concentrate will be transported by haul trucks to a port where the 
concentrate will be loaded onto ocean going ships for transport to offshore smelters. 

Sandwell Engineering Inc. conducted a preliminary level assessment of five potential portsides 
within reasonable trucking distance from the Cañariaco mine. Three of the ports, Paita, Bayovar 
and Salaverry were considered potentially capable of providing concentrate load–out services to 
ocean going ships upon completion of upgrades to their existing facilities.  



SRK Consulting                             
PEA Technical Report, Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 197 

GD/ha 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM  November 30, 2008

The two other portsites, Eten and Pascamayo, were basically minor ports that would require all 
new facilities before they could be used for concentrate load-out. 

Based on the information provided by Sandwell, Candente selected the Port of Salaverry as the 
preferred port for this study because it has very good road access, it currently serves as a load-out 
port for concentrate from another Peruvian mining operation and the port facilities can be shared. 

The Port of Salaverry is approximately 430 kms from the mine site and 15 kms south of Trujillo, 
in the Department of La Libertad. Routing from the mine to the port would follow the mine 
access road from the site to the IIRSA North Highway to Olmos, along the old Panamerican 
Highway to Chiclayo, and then along the Panamerican Highway to Salaverry. Concentrate haul 
trucks from the mine will discharge the concentrate into a storage shed within several kilometres 
of the Port of Salaverry. When a load-out is scheduled concentrate will be reclaimed with a 
front end loader into trucks for haulage to the port, where the concentrate will be dumped into a 
"shiploader". The shiploader is a movable dockside portable conveyor system with a dump 
hopper for receiving the concentrate and a covered conveyor belt which discharges directly over 
the ship's hold. When not in use, the portable shiploader will be removed from the pier to a 
temporary storage site at the port.  

The Port of Salaverry can handle ships up to 25,000 dwt and possibly 32,000 dwt but dredging 
may be required to accept larger ships. The mining company currently using the Port of Salaverry 
has its own portable concentrate shiploader and although it is possible it may be available for 
shared use, an allowance has been made in this PEA for a new higher capacity portable 
shiploader. Prior to utilization of the port, Cañariaco would need to provide the following 
dedicated facilities and equipment: 

• Land for a dedicated concentrate storage facility close to the port;  

• Covered concentrate storage shed; 

• Concentrate truck dump, weigh scale and truck wash; 

• Front end loader for concentrate handling;  

• Small office , laboratory and maintenance shop; 

• Secure area  for equipment parking; 

• Portable concentrate load-out system (shiploader).  

Cañariaco would utilize the port on a toll basis. The terminal operator at the port of Salaverry is 
Empresa Nacional de Peurtos S.A. ("ENAPU") which is a state owned company. The Peruvian 
government has started a program of privatization of ports, and it is anticipated that the port at 
Salaverry will also be privatized, possibly in 2009.

General Comments  

In general, there are plans to upgrade some of the port facilities on the north coast of Peru but the 
schedule and parameters for implementation of the upgrades are not entirely defined at this point. 
Cañariaco will continue to monitor the development plans for the five port sites identified, with 
the objective to identify the best alternative for the Cañariaco project. Comments on the four port 
sites other than Salaverry are provided below. 

Bayovar 

At Bayovar there is an existing load-out facility for crude oil, and Compania Minera Miski Mayo 
SAC is currently constructing a dedicated new facility to load-out phosphate with completion 
anticipated in 2010. Bayovar has good road access and can accept large ships, however it is a 
relatively remote site. At this point it is uncertain if Miski Mayo would be willing to share their 
port facilities, but Cañariaco plans to address the potential for shared use in the next phase of 
study. 

Paita 

The port of Paita currently can accommodate large vessels, but installation of concentrate storage 
and handling facilities would be required prior to use by Cañariaco. The port is scheduled to be 
privatized in 2008, and the privation process requires that the successful tender embark on a 
major port upgrade within three years of award. Should the privatization and upgrades proceed on 
schedule, it is not certain that space would be available to accommodate concentrate load-out 
facilities, however if load-out facilities can be accommodated this may be a viable alternative for 
Cañariaco.  

Eten 

The regional authorities of Chiclayo and the Department of Lambayeque have expressed sincere 
interest in the construction of a new multi-use port at Eten, close to Chiclayo. A port at Eten 
would be much closer to the Cañariaco mine than Salaverry and as a result would significantly 
reduce the cost of concentrate transport from the mine. In addition, it would be in the same 
regional district as the mine which may be beneficial. However, the concept for a new port is in 
the very early stage of development and as a result Cañariaco concluded that for this study, it 
would not be prudent to plan on utilizing the port of Eten. Should port development plans 
progress to a higher level, Cañariaco would re-assess the potential at Eten. 

Pacasmayo 

The Pacasmayo port site would require construction and installation of extensive port facilities in 
order to serve the Cañariaco project, and the required capital investment may exceed the level that 
could be supported solely by the Cañariaco project.

Waste Management Facilities 

Waste Rock Dumps 

The waste rock dump will consist of both non-PAG and PAG rock located adjacent to the final pit 
limits in the Cañariaco River Valley. Due to the pit and deposit geometry, the potential for 
backfilling into previously mined out areas is limited. 

The steep natural topography in the vicinity of the proposed dump location will necessitate the 
building of the waste rock dump in a series of lifts in a "bottom-up" approach in order to 
maximize stability. The dump will be constructed by placing material at its natural angle of

Water Diversion Tunnel & Reservoir 

Due to the high water flows of the Cañariaco River, a diversion tunnel will need to be constructed 
on the east side of the valley, directing the water flow around the proposed waste rock dump. A 
fresh water reservoir on the upstream side of the waste dump will provide the mill with 4 months 
supply of water (2.5 M m3). The 2.2 km-long diversion tunnel will serve to isolate the Cañariaco 
River from the mine operations, and therefore maintain the water flow as "non-contact flow." 
This approach will preserve the pre-existing natural quality of the water for the benefit of 
downstream communities. 

The diversion tunnel was designed to handle run-off water from a 100-year rainfall event 
estimated by TetraTech to yield 81 m3/s of water. The tunnel will be designed to have a nominal 
finished dimension of 5 m wide by 5 m high. A geotechnical investigation of the tunnel location 
has not been conducted and it was assumed that the rock conditions would be amenable to an 
underground excavation. The tunnel was designed to be fully supported and lined with shotcrete 
to provide long-term stability and reduced wall friction. The tunnel intake (portal) will be located

at 2,685 masl, approximately 100 m lower than the rim of the pit. The tunnel discharge is planned 
to be at approximately 2,535 masl giving a tunnel gradient of about -7%. 

The proposed diversion tunnel location is shown in Figure 18.18 along with the 518 Mt pit, dump 
configuration, water reservoir and plant site. The base site topography was as of early 2008.

Tailings Management Facility 

Tailings from the process plant will be sent to the proposed tailings containment facility to the 
west of the plant facility in an adjacent valley. In order to contain the 511 mt of tailings, a rock 
fill dam will be constructed (main dam along with smaller saddle berm). It is proposed that the 
dam material be sourced from a quarry that is located within the ultimate tailings containment 
facility. The total material required for the dam construction is approximately 34.2 Mm3.

The overall design objective is to provide safe, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible 
management of the tailings produced by the proposed mine. Site-specific design criteria for the 
tailings containment facility was developed based on the following agency publications: 

• World Bank Standard Guidelines; 

• International Committee on Large Dams (ICOLD) – Various Bulletins; 

• Canadian Dam Association - Dam Safety Guidelines, January 1999; 

• The Mining Association of Canada - A Guide to the Management of Tailings Facilities, 
September 1998; 

• Relevant Peruvian Regulations. 

The engineering design intent will be to assure that the facility design strictly adheres to the 
design criteria set forth at the onset of the work. General design criteria for the project were: 

• Physically and chemically stable, and shall not impose an unacceptable risk to public health 
and safety or the environment.  

• Classified in accordance with ICOLD guidance in terms of hazard level and the final design 
criteria will incorporate the associated requirements.  

• Sufficient containment of contaminants to result in compliance with applicable environmental 
standards.  

• Restriction of all effluents to the drainage basin in which the dam resides. 

• Decommissioning of ancillary facilities to prevent unacceptable risk to public health and 
safety or the environment. 

The site-specific design approach will account for local factors including climate, geology, 
hydrogeology, seismicity, and vegetation.  

A tailings containment facility site selection study was performed to screen possible alternative 
sites based on defined design criteria and evaluation parameters including estimated development 
costs to identify the preferred tailings containment location. The selected site meets all of the 
design criteria. 

This study assumes the most feasible embankment type will be a compacted rock fill structure 
constructed with staged downstream construction methods to defer capital construction costs. The 
starter dam would be constructed with locally borrowed rock fill or mine pre-strip material placed 
and compacted in lifts with subsequent dam raises constructed with borrowed rock fill or suitable 
waste rock materials, as available. Suitable borrow sources for embankment construction are 
assumed to be located in close proximity to the dam site.

• The evaluation identified Site 5D as the preferred tailings containment site based on the 
currently established project parameters and criteria.  

The ultimate capacity required for the base case shell in this PEA is 511 Mt. The tailings have 
been designed to reach an ultimate height of 2,995 m and will require a pipeline approximately 
8 km in length to transport tailings from the plant facility. Table 18.14 and Figure 18.19 below

Figure 18.19: Cumulative Tailings Capacity 

The capitalized starter dam (see Table 18.15 below), with a crest elevation of 2,900 m, requires 
5.5 Mm3 (or 11.6 Mt) of material to be built and will contain approximately 75 Mt of tailings (or 
first three years of tailings production). The upstream slope of the dam is designed at 2:1 with the 
downstream slope at 2.5:1 with a final crest width of 10 m. Starter dam material will be sourced 
from the quarry located within the ultimate tailings containment facility. At this stage of the 
project no data is available for neither the ground conditions nor the material characteristics of the 
dam and tailings site location. As such, the quarry has been designed with the assumption that all 
material is suitable as dam construction material. Assuming a mining rate of 18,500 t/day 
(8,800 m3/day) equates to just over a year and a half to quarry the required material (planned to 
occur in pre-production period).

The ultimate dam (along with smaller saddle dam) will reach an elevation of 3,000 m and require 
a further 28.7 Mm3 (or 60.2 Mt) of material to be constructed using the same design parameters 
as the starter dam and will also be sourced from the nearby quarry.

The ultimate quarry is designed to stay within the ultimate tailings height of 2,995 m (to reduce 
overall footprint of operations) and as such, quarrying for the dam construction will need to be 
designed and scheduled in such a way as to stay ahead of the ever increasing tailings height 
requirements. The quarry is thus designed as a "contour" mining operation, with an ultimate crest 
height of 2,990 m and a pit bottom of 2,935 m. Based on the tailings storage capacities from 
Table 18.15, the tailings will reach the height of 2,935 m, approximately 9.5 years after mill start-
up (based on 27.4 Mtpa processing rate). The quarrying of all material will need to be completed 
by this point in time. Using the same 18,500 t/day mining rate for the starter dam will allow the 
quarrying of material to be completed in this time frame. The storage facility and quarry are 
presented in Figures 18.20 and 18.21.

18.4 Metal Recovery  

Estimates for copper gold and silver recoveries are based on metallurgical tests described in 
Section 16. The assumed projected recoveries are shown in Table 18.16. No tests were conducted 
for arsenic and antimony recovery. The suppression or exclusion of these deleterious elements 
from the copper concentrate has not been tested.

18.5 Markets 

Cañariaco Norte concentrate is projected to contain an average 27 % copper, 2 - 3 g/t gold and 60 
- 90 g/t silver. Concentrate production will average 350,000 to 400,000 dmt per year over the life 
of the project. During the first three years of operation, Cañariaco will mine higher grade ore and 
as a result, concentrate production will be 400,000 to 50,000 dmt per year.  

Cañariaco Norte concentrate will be marketed to international smelters in Asia, Europe and 
North America. For concentrate transport costs, it has been projected that approximately 75% 
would be sold to Asian smelters and the remainder to European smelters.  

Treatment charges for concentrate may vary significantly for various smelters driven by world 
supply and demand conditions. Candente commissioned Base Metals Marketing Services Ltd 
("BMMS") to conduct a preliminary level concentrate marketing study for the Cañariaco Norte 
concentrate. The information provided by BMMS plus relevant information from several other 
project consultants was used to develop a basis for the marketing of the concentrate. For this 
report, current industry typical treatment charges have been applied and are as follows: 

Table 18.17: Assumed Concentrate Treatment and Refining Charges 

Parameter Unit Value 
Copper payable % 96.5 
Treatment charge $/dmt Cu concentrate 75 
Cu refining charge $/lb payable Cu 0.075 
Au refining charge $/oz payable Au 5.00 
Ag refining charge $/oz payable Ag 0.50 
Gold deduction g/t 1 
Gold payable % of payable Au 90 
Silver deduction g/t 30 
Silver payable % of payable Ag 90 
As Penalty 
($2 per 0.1 units over 0.2%) $/dmt conc. $23/dmt (LOM average) 

Sb Penalty 
($2 per 0.1 units over 0.1%) $/dmt conc.  $0.35/dmt (LOM average) 

18.5.1 Arsenic 

Porphyry copper deposits in northern Peru typically contain elevated levels of arsenic relative to 
copper porphyry deposits in other parts of the world and this is also the case at Cañariaco Norte. 
For this report, a typical industry standard copper flotation circuit without arsenic treatment is 
proposed and as a result the concentrate will incur a penalty for arsenic. The projected arsenic 
penalty will vary by year, but is projected to average approximately $23 per dmt over the life of 
the mine with a preliminary average concentrate grade of 1.3% As. 



SRK Consulting                             
PEA Technical Report, Cañariaco Norte Project, Peru  Page 207 

GD/ha 2CC028  000 Cañariaco Norte 43-101 PEA 20081212.doc, Dec. 12, 08, 2:03 PM  November 30, 2008

BMMS has recommended that to ensure sufficient competitive smelter capacity be available to 
treat this material, Candente aim to limit the arsenic content in the concentrate  to below 0.5%, 
and preferably to below 0.2% in the concentrate. Candente has requested Samuel Engineering 
Inc. to evaluate process options to reduce the level of arsenic in the concentrate produced.  

The problem with arsenic in concentrates has grown as many of the mines in Chile and Peru 
(providing the largest share of supply to the custom market) have ore bodies with higher arsenic 
levels, which are showing a tendency to rise, as mining moves to deeper levels. The smelting 
industry has expressed concern. In China for example, regulations prevent smelters importing 
concentrates containing more than 0.5% arsenic. 

Of approximately 13 million tonnes of global copper mine production (excluding SXEW 
production), approximately 3 million tonnes contain arsenic in excess of 0.2% in concentrate. 
Most of this production is at a handful of large-scale mines such as Collahuasi, Escondida, 
Los Bronces and Chuquicamata in Chile, Kennecott's Bingham Canyon in the USA, Neves 
Corvo in Portugal, as well as a few mines in Poland and the CIS. Most of this production is at 
levels of less than 0.4% arsenic. Mines with arsenic levels grading in excess of 1% As are 
normally smaller scale operations in Peru or Bulgaria. 

18.5.2 Antimony 
It is estimated, based on very preliminary assumptions that the copper concentrate may contain an 
average of 0.1% antimony over the life of the mine. The antimony grade is not expected to attract 
significant smelter penalties or present marketing problems.  

18.5.3 Possible Smelter Outlets for Cañariaco Norte Concentrates 

Table 18.18 shows custom smelters capable of treating concentrates with arsenic levels above 
0.5% and those capable of treating concentrates with levels above 0.2%.

18.6 Contracts 

There are currently no established contracts relating to mining, concentrating, smelting, refining, 
transportation, handling, forward sales or hedging.  

18.7 Environmental Considerations 

Candente initiated an independent environmental impact assessment in 2007 with AMEC (Peru) 
S.A.., a recognized environmental specialist consultant in Peru. This assessment is ongoing, but at 
this point there are no findings that suggest the project would not meet environmental approval. 

18.7.1 Socio-Economic Environment 

The Cañariaco Project is located on the Lambayeque Region, Ferreñafe province, Cañaris and 
Incahuasi districts. It covers lands of the San Juan Bautista de Cañaris and Jose Carlos Mariátegui 
peasant communities. The mine a process plant will be located in the Cañariaco River basin. The 
tailings containment facility will be located in the Yerma Valley. The project area is located 
within three agro-ecological levels ranging from 1,200 to 3,800 masl. 



SRK Consulting

The Cañaris community dates back to the years of the Spanish Colonies, and some cultural 
manifestations from those years can still be observed, such as the use of traditional clothing and 
the use of Quechua language as well as some community organization structures. 

The following table summarizes both communities.

(*) Official sources (PETT 2001, INEI 2005) and AMEC field work, January 2007-june 2008. 
(**) Estimated number of families potentially affected by resettlement of their houses or properties 

Eight-five percent of the Project footprint (approximately 2,000 ha) is located within the Cañaris 
community and the remaining 15% will be within the Mariategui community. There are some 
settlements, isolated families, grazing pastures and the Cañaris forest within the project area. The 
forest rights have been distributed and assigned to some commoners for use and is considered by 
the community as source of their water. The water is being used on the lower levels of the basin 
and the urban area of Chiclayo and because of this, the project has a regional area of influence. 

The following table summarizes the social impacts from the Project on its different stages. 

Table 18.20: Socio-economic Risks for the Project 

Local Risk Implication 

Land acquisition Surface rights and property negotiation 
The project involves community lands, but there 
are also use rights to be considered. 

Negotiation criteria must include community, direct 
user and indirect user. 

Involuntary resettlement Families to resettle 
Some families from both communities must be 
relocated 

There are about four hundred families to be involved 
in this process. 

Archaeological findings Archaeological work 

There are archaeological evidences at Congona To use the area, an archaeological recovery Project must be conducted prior to construction 

Regional Risk There is concern on the potential of the project to impact water quality 

Water use 
The water balance of the region is not well defined 
and concern about its availability and quality are 
expected to arise. 

Cañaris Forest The Cañaris Forest and its natural resources will attract the public opinion to the project.

18.8 Socio-economic Cost 

Candente has received a certificate of confirmation from the Peruvian National Institute of 
Culture ("INC") that no archaeological remains exist within the area of the Cañariaco Norte pit. 

Development of the Cañariaco Norte project would require resettlement of families residing 
within the immediate project area. A baseline study will be required to develop an inventory of 
residents, assets and services within the project area; this also must include the value of the forest 
plus the environmental services the project area provides. A social risk assessment is also 
required at regional and local level. These studies must assess stakeholders concerns as well as 
potential and perceived impacts. 

The population of both communities must be considered in the project social plans. 

18.8.1 Ecosystems and Biodiversity 

The project area is comprised of humid plateau areas locally known as "Jalcas" or "Paramus", 
and humid mountain forest. These ecosystems spread from southern Ecuador down to the 
Huancabamba depression in northern Peru and through the Western Cordillera, and are deeply 
fragmented by human activities. The project area is located within the largest remaining montain 
forest in the Western Cordillera of Peru. This montain forest area holds species formerly known 
only in Ecuador and Colombia.  

In the project area, biodiversity indicators in some groups are outstanding. Plants and especially 
orchid species outnumber those known in other montain forests in northern Peru, and six species 
newly recorded for Peru, as well as fifteen endemic species have been reported. Over 180 bird 
species have been identified including two protected species (the "bearded guan" and the 
"chestnut-backed thornbird" declared Vulnerable and Endangered respectively) and four 
endemic species (the "chestnut-backed thornbird", the "spot-throated hummingbird", the "buff 
bellied tanager"and the "unicolored tapaculo"). Thirty five mammal species have been reported, 
twenty three are protected by law (the "spectacled bear" is  endangered and the "mountain 
tapir" critically endangered ), one is endemic to Peru (Dasypus pilosus) and we have reported the 
southernmost sighting for "mountain tapir" in the general project area. Eight amphibians and 
eight reptiles have been reported, two are protected by law (Eleutherodactylus simonsi and 
Gastrotheca monticola) and three are endemic to Peru (Petracola ventrimaculatus, Stenocercus 
stigmosus and Eleutherodactylus simonsi). 

The investigations to date have identified several new flora and fauna species that were not 
previously recorded, including three possibly new species of frogs and 13 new plant species. It is 
possible these new species may exist elsewhere in Peru and an objective of future investigations 
should be to confirm their presence in other areas. In many areas of Peru the biodiversity 
assessments are not yet complete and therefore it is not uncommon for detailed environmental

impact investigations to identify new species. As the environmental impact assessment 
progresses, it will be determined wich species warrant special attention during the development of 
the environmental management plans for the project. Candente has initiated two conservation 
projects that encompass the relocation of protected orchids found at the site and the identification 
of an area for conservation and environmental management. 

18.8.2 ARD / Geochemistry 

The geochemistry of the Cañariaco Norte deposit and its acid rock drainage/metal leaching 
(ARD/ML) potential has not been fully assessed. Based on the current geological and 
mineralogical descriptions of the deposit, the potential exists for ARD/ML generation to occur 
which may require mitigation to meet environmental requirements. Potential ARD sources from 
the project include waste rock, open pit walls and tailings.  

Assessment of the ARD/ML potential of the deposit will require a geochemical characterization 
of the project's mine waste materials. Future assessment work will require representative samples 
from new drilling to be analyzed for acid-base accounting ("ABA") parameters, total metals and 
leachable metals. Kinetic testing would be performed on a representative subset of these samples. 
Additional geochemical testing of the flotation tailings from the metallurgical testing program 
would be completed to assess the ARD/ML potential of these materials.  

For this preliminary economic assessment Candente has included conceptual design features and 
costs for containment of potential acid drainage. 

18.8.3 Soils and Slope Stability 

Development activities in areas of steep slopes and high rainfall can have significant effect on 
soils and slope stability, with the resulting risk of landslides and erosion. The development 
activities must be designed and managed carefully to minimize impacts and risk of these events. 

18.8.4 Air Quality and Noise 

To predict potential environmental impacts of dust and gas emissions, an air dispersion model 
will be developed with the meteorological data obtained from stations installed in the area. This 
air model will help with the environmental management plans for project activities, to prevent or 
reduce potential impacts. 

Noise assessments were completed in four field visits around the project area to measure existing 
environmental noise levels. Noise assessment will be completed with a noise model, to predict the 
maximum length of noise impact due to project construction and operation activities.  

This information collected from the air quality and noise assessments can be utilized to reduce

18.8.5 Hydrology and Hydrogeology 

The projects will be located within two drainage basins, the Cañariaco River and Yerma River 
valleys. Project development may have an impact on local water resources and an effective water 
management plan will be required to minimize the impact. Key aspects of water management 
plan will address surface water flow volumes and quality, groundwater, project water use, water 
management around the pit, waste dumps drainage, tailings containment facility, and other 
project facilities. The hydrogeological model will be a key component for impact assessment and 
prediction. Candente has initiated preliminary baseline hydrological assessments in the project 
area.  

Water Quality and Sediment Control 

Issues in hydrology, soils and slope stability can impact water quality because project activities 
have the potential to cause sediment increase, ARD, metal leaching and other potential impacts. 
Water management will be key to successful project development and for this preliminary 
economic assessment Candente has applied several key design features to protect the integrity 
and quality of local water resources.  

Specifically, Candente recognizes the importance of the Cañariaco River to the communities 
downstream of the project area. To ensure preservation of the pre-existing quality of the 
Cañariaco River, a diversion tunnel would be constructed so that the Cañariaco River would 
completely bypass the open pit and waste rock storage areas.  

The tailings containment facility would be located in the Yerma Valley which is a completely 
separate basin from the Cañariaco River Valley. The Yerma Valley receives far less precipitation 
than the Cañariaco Valley and the surface water flow is significantly less. Diversion channels 
would be developed to intercept and bypass  surface water flows around the tailings containment 
facility. 

18.8.6 Permitting 

Exploration 

Candente may extend the exploration period granted by submitting a letter of intention to the 
Dirección General de Asuntos Ambientales Mineros ("DGAAM") and Organismo Supervisor de 
la Inversión en Energía y Minería ("OSINERGMIN") before the actual permit expires. If new 
areas are to be included on the exploration program, those must be identified and a modification 
to the actual permit must be prepared.

Construction 

The following list summarizes the main permits and licenses required for production. 

• Pre-Construction:  The main requirement is the approved EIS, the following permits and 
licenses must be completed prior to construction: 
− Land acquisition and surface rights; 
− Archaeological Certificate (CIRA); 
− Approved Mine Closure Plan; 
− Financial warrant for the approved mine closure plan; 
− Processing permit; 
− Transportation permit; 
− Power Line permit; 
− Power Easement; 
− Technical report for fuel consumers; 
− Surface and Underground water licenses; and 
− Deforestation permit. 

• Construction:  The following permits must be obtained prior to starting operations: 
− Register for fuel consumer; 
− Licenses for private telecommunications; 
− Explosive magazine licenses and explosive user licenses. 

Production 

Before starting operations, Candente must obtain the following licenses: 

• Authorization to begin exploitation and treatment of mineral concession; 

• Mining Operation Certification; 

• Safety inspection by Defensa Civil; 

• Updated explosive storage, handling and use licenses; 

• Registry for controlled chemical substances. 

18.8.7 Closure 

A closure plan will required for this project and the plan will be developed as part of 
prefeasibility and feasibility level assessment. The closure plan will take into account the 
environmental data, environmental models, geochemical and hydrogeological data, and project 
design scope to ensure the appropriate closure measures are applied. The most desirable approach 
is to design for closure from the beginning of the project, considering all environmental and 
technical requirements, to comply with national and international regulations and world best 
practice guidelines.

18.9 Taxation 

Royalties 

Peru's royalty payment requirements are shown in Table 18.21. Royalty payments were 
determined using net smelter return values. 

Table 18.21: Mining Royalty Rates 

NSR Value Range Royalty (% of NSR Value) 

NSR <  $60 M 1% 

$60 m < NSR < $120 M 2% 

NSR > $120 M 3% 

Profit Sharing Tax 

Peru has an 8% income tax established to help distribute corporate profits to workers of all levels. 
The tax is used to compensate workers according to their specific wage categories as defined by 
the Peruvian government. Contractors must contribute the 8% tax for their own workers. This tax 
is applied to taxable income prior to the calculation of regular corporate income tax and is 
deductible for corporate income tax calculations.  

Value Added Tax 

There is a 19% value added tax in Peru for all goods and services. There are means to recover this 
tax back from the government and, as a result, the cash flow model does not show VAT as it is 
assumed that full recovery of the value added tax will be realized. 

Corporate Income Tax 

Peruvian corporate income tax has been applied at the rate of to be 30% for this study. The actual 
income tax paid will likely vary when detailed tax assessments are done, but 30% is considered 
based on current tax practice.  

Depreciation 

Depreciation was taken into account in the cash flow calculation for all capital expenses. 
Depreciation schedules are based on current practice and are presented in Table 18.22.

It has been assumed that unused depreciation could be carried forward to future years indefinitely 
until it was all accounted for. It was also assumed that development expenses related to the 
capital cost of the access road, diversion tunnel, mine prep and pre-strip and the starter tailing 
dam could be considered allowable expenses under Peruvian tax law and were treated, for 
taxation calculations as expenses in the first two years of production for Cases 2, 3 and4. 

18.10 Capital Costs ("CAPEX") 

Capital costs for the project were developed from a mix of first principles, reference projects, and 
experience. A summary of the CAPEX schedule is shown in Table 18.23. 

Table 18.23: Summary of Capital Cost Schedule

Information sources for each element of the capital cost estimate are as follows: 

• Access Road:  A new 50 km-long access road cost was estimated by Vector Engineering 
based on a preliminary route and factored costs.  

• Power Line:   A new 57 km-long 220 kV power line was estimated by CESEL Engenieros a 
private Peruvian electrical power consulting firm who conducted in an independent power 
study. 

• Diversion Tunnel:   The diversion tunnel was assumed to be mined by a specialized mining 
contractor and estimated to cost $10,000/m of development ($22 m total). The cost includes 
contractor mobilization, overheads, preparation and all underground related infrastructure 
(ventilation fans, compressed air, electrical power etc.). The cost includes contingency and 
was based on a heavily supported, long-term tunnel. An additional $8 m was used for site 
access and preparation and construction of the water retention pond.

• Mine Equipment:   Mine equipment will be leased and expensed throughout the project life 
and therefore does on appear as a capital cost item except in pre-production Year -1. The total 
annual lease cost in Year -1 was applied to capital cost to cover the cost of equipment 
required to do pit pre-stripping. No EPCM or contingency was added to the mine fleet costs 
as the prices used were based budgetary supplier prices and have sufficient built-in 
contingency to cover all costs. 

• Pre-strip and Mine Preparation:   The Year-1 mine pre-strip volume was estimated to be 48 
Mt multiplied by the waste rock mining cost of $1.22/t. An additional $10 m was added in 
pre-stripping costs for roads, and waste dump site preparation.  

• Process Plant:   Samuel estimated the process plant and site infrastructure based on a major 
equipment list and factored construiction costs. The estimate included $ 70.9 M in EPCM and 
$ 187.6 M in contingency. 

• Port Facility:   The port at Salaverry was assumed to be shared with Goldfeilds, the current 
operator of the facility and, therefore the loadout system was not included in the estimate. 
The port capital included costs for site preparation, a concentrate storage builing with transfer 
conveyor, a front-end loader, reclaim hopper and de-lumper. A 20% contingency and 10% 
EPCM cost were included.  

• Tailings Starter Dam:   The starter dam volume was calculated by TetraTech. SRK used a 
first principle approach to cost the quarrying of waste rock for the starter dam and for the 
transport and placement of rock on the dam. The all-in contractor quarrying, hauling and 
placement cost was estimated to be $1.75/t. Starter dam earthworks, water diversion, and 
containment were added to the quarrying costs. No contingency was applied to the starter 
dam as it was thought the estimates were sufficiently robust.    

• Owner's Costs:   Owner's costs were estimated by comparing other similar projects 

• Closure:   Closure costs were estimated without significant back-up due to the lack of 
information regarding ML/ARD issues. No long-term water treatment was considered in the 
closure cost as it is not known if it will be required.  

• Sustaining Capital:   Sustaining capital was estimated based on experience. 

• Working Capital:   Three month's operating costs ($40 m) were used to estimate the working 
capital needed in Year 1. The equivalent amount was taken as a negative cost in Year 20.

18.11 Operating Costs ("OPEX") 

18.11.1 Cost Estimate Summary 

The process operating costs for the Cañariaco Norte project have been estimated by 
Samuel Engineering, Inc. in Q2/Q3, 2008 United States dollars and do not include allowances for 
escalation or exchange rate fluctuations. The requirement for this operating cost estimate is 
intended to be at a scoping level with an accuracy of ± 35 percent. 

Operating costs were built up from the organizational chart and unit prices for commodities 
delivered to the mine site. 

Unit rates for power costs were provided by the client and confirmed by SE based on current 
knowledge of rates in the area and recent estimates from other developing operations in the area. 
A rate of $0.050/kWh has been used. Power costs are based on the unit rates for power and the 
preliminary electrical load analysis developed for the project. 

A concentrate marketing study was commissioned by Candente to confirm the marketability of 
the copper concentrates. This included the cost for smelting and refining. 

Additionally, the annual cost for expansion of the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) as developed 
by TetraTech and SRK has been included into the plant process cost estimate.  

A summary of the operating costs (based on 27,375,000 tonnes per year or 75,000 tonnes per day) 
by area are shown in the Table 18.24.

18.11.2 Mining Cost Estimate 

Mining costs were estimated on a simplified first principles basis and were based on 
manufacturer's input and SRK experience. Equipment efficiency was estimated based on 
Cañariaco conditions (e.g. haul routes for each phase). 

The cost of the mine fleet, including all ancillary equipment was not capitalized but rather was 
assumed to be leased and shown as an operating cost. The lease rates were determined using a 7-
year term, no salvage value and an annual interest rate of 6.5%. 

Mining costs were estimated to be $1.22/tonne mined for waste and $1.18/tonne mined for 
mineralized rock, excluding equipment lease costs estimated at $0.51/tonne milled. The total 
mining cost was estimated to be $2.23/tonne milled. 

18.11.3 Processing Cost Estimate 

Processing costs are a summation of administrative, operating and maintenance labour, power, 
consumables including reagents, grinding liners and media, and an estimate for maintenance and 
miscellaneous operating supplies. 

Labour costs are based on the organizational chart and Peruvian labour rates. Salaries for each job 
category are based on experience of similar operations in Peru and Chile. An average burden rate 
of 40% has been applied to salaried labour and hourly labour to include all social insurance, 
medical and insurance costs, pension and vacation costs. 

Power costs are based on the electrical load analysis for the concentrator and a unit rate of 
$0.050/kWh. 

Reagent costs are based on projected consumptions from metallurgical test work and verbal 
quotations for unit reagent prices. 

Grinding steel consumption is an estimate based on previous project experience. Liner and media 
prices are based on current markets. 

Maintenance and miscellaneous operating supply costs are a percentage factor based on previous 
project experience. 

A small amount of material will be run through the concentrator during the pre-operational phase 
of start-up. It is recognized that a ramp-up period for production will be experienced at start-up 
but the duration has not been accounted for at this stage of the project. 

Process operating costs are summarized in Table 18.25.

18.11.5 Concentrate Handling and Treatment 

This section was developed with information from the two available marketing reports prepared 
by: Oliver Merton and Wolfgang Treder of Base Metals Marketing Services Ltd., and Stanley 
Neamonitis, Independent Consultant. This information was reviewed and interpreted by Matt 
Bender of Samuel Engineering, and other industry experts, as required.  

Table 18.27: Concentrate Operating Cost Estimate 

Description of Charges Cost/t milled Cost/dmt of concentrate 

Cu concentrate transportation to smelter port 1.45 107.95 
Cu concentrate treatment 1.01 75.00 
Cu concentrate refining 0.58 43.08 
Au refining 0.003 0.24 
Ag refining 0.01 0.68 
As penalty 0.31 22.65 
Sb penalty 0.003 0.22 
Total 3.37 250 

Copper concentrate transportation costs include: a $42/wmt cost for trucking bulk copper 
concentrate from the mine site to the Port of Salaverry, a $10.00/wmt cost for port handling, 
storage, assaying, ship loading, and insurance; and $48/wmt cost for ocean freight. It is assumed 
75% of the copper concentrate will be shipped to a smelter located in Asia and 25% will be 
shipped to Europe. 

Copper concentrate treatment charges (TC) and refining charges (RC) of $75/dmt and $0.075/lb 
of payable copper are used, respectively. The TC & RC reflect pricing from the major smelters in 
Asia. 

Gold and silver refining charges are $5.00/oz and $0.50/oz, respectively. 

Tailings Storage Facility 

Operating costs developed by Tetra Tech and SRK in relation to the Tailings Storage Facility 
(TSF) were incorporated into Samuel Engineering's plant operating cost estimate per Candente 
Resource Corporation's directive. These costs were estimated to be $0.178/tonne for facility 
expansion associated with TSF site option 5D. Tetra Tech estimated all costs related to the 
tailings facility, except quarrying, trucking and waste placement costs which were estimated by 
SRK.  

Contingency 

No contingency allowance was included in any OPEX estimates.

18.12 Economic Analysis 

18.12.1 Assumptions 

Four cases were analysed using before and after tax discounted cash flows to capture the 
variations of results using a range of copper prices. There is no guarantee that any of the copper 
prices estimated will be representative of future metals prices. All metal prices were held constant 
for the duration of the project.  

The simplified cash flow assumes an equity finacnced project. 

The size of the open pit resource was held constant for all of the cases. The open pit shell, as

18.12.2 Results 

The economic analysis conducted in this report uses measured, indicated and inferred mineral 
resources and only provides a preliminary overview of the project economics based on broad, 
factored assumptions. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to 
have the economic considerations applied to them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there 
is no certainty that the inferred resources will be upgraded to a higher resource category. There is 
also no certainty that the results of this preliminary economic assessment will be realized. 

The results of the economic analyses are shown in Tables 19.30 and 18.31. Based on the 
assumptioins made in this study, the after-tax cash flow approaches a 10% IRR using $2.00/lb 
Cu. The results also show that the project achieves a 15% pre-tax IRR at a copper price of 
$2.14/lb and a 12% pre-tax IRR at $1.98/lb Cu. The copper price required to produce a break-
even cash flow (undiscounted and post-tax) is $1.45/lb.  

The NPV and IRR results vary widely based on copper price and, therefore, the potential 
economic viability of the project will be dependent upon the selected long-term copper price. The 
current long-term copper price used by many banks is around $2.00/lb. SRK has no opinion on 
the suitability of this price.

18.12.3 Sensitivities 

Sensitivity analysis was performed using metal prices, mill head grade, capital costs and 
operating costs as variables. The value of each variable was changed plus and minus 20% 
independently while all other variables were held constant.  

The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown on graphs in Figures 18.22 to 18.25 and 
Table 18.32. 

As with most mining projects, and in particular with Cañariaco Norte, the net present value 
("NPV") of the project is most affected by the price of metal and in this case, the price of copper. 
This holds true for all the cases in this study. In Case 2, for example, a 20% increase in metal 
prices leads to an increase in the pre-tax net present value using a 8% discount rate 
("PT-NPV8%") from $352M to $1,016M. The plant feed grade and recovery also have a similar 
large impact with a $525M PT-NPV8% gain for a 20% increase in grade or recovery. Conversely, 
decreases in metal prices, plant feed grades or recoveries have a correspondingly large negative 
effect on the NPV8%.  

All cases indicate they are slightly more sensitive to operating cost than capital cost. For Case 2, a 
20% increase in OPEX drops the PT-NPV8% to $108M from $352M. A 20% increase in the Case 
2 capital cost yields a $216M in PT-NPV8% from $352M to $136M.

18.14 Mine Life 

The mine production life at the Cañariaco Norte project, based on the assumptions made in this 
study, is 20 years. There are a number of potential factors that could extend the mine life that 
have not been included in this report. 

The Cañariaco Norte deposit will still contain resources, particularly at depth, after the current 
proposed pit is mined out. The PEA Whittle optimization analysis and subsequent mine design 
were conducted using a $2.00/lb copper price. If a higher copper price is used, then, all things 
being equal, the optimal Whittle shell would expand and the total mill feed and mine life would 
increase. Conversely, a drop in copper price below $2.00/lb will make the pit smaller. 

The Cañariaco Sur deposit has previously been interpreted to contain a potential resource but has 
had limited exploration drilling completed to date. Cañariaco Sur represents an obvious 
exploration target. 

There is the potential for further exploration discoveries and/or expansions of current known 
resources along known mineralized trends.  

18.15 Alternative Development Scenario 

An alternative development plan based on a mining and processing rate of 37,500 tonnes per day 
was evaluated at a conceptual level to assess the potential impact on project economics. The 
lower production rate scenario utilized the same mining and processing technology as per the 
75,000 tpd case, an assumed a mine life of 18 years and assumed plant feed grade of 0.46% 
copper. The results indicated that the lower production rate scenario would achieve a lower 
internal rate of return than for the 75,000 tpd case.

19 Interpretation and Conclusions 
Industry standard mining, process design, construction methods and economic evaluation 
practices have been used to assess the Cañariaco Norte Project. Sufficient and representative 
samples and information were available to conduct metallurgical testing, estimate a mineral 
resource and complete this PEA.  

Sufficient work has been done on permitting and environmental aspects of the project to indicate 
that required permits to proceed with the project, to operate the mine and to deal with mine 
closure at the end of the mine life, have a reasonable likelihood of being granted. It must be noted 
that the project is in an environmentally sensitive area, with possible unique species of flora and 
fauna and development of this project will require relocation of a number of local residences. 

The results of metallurgical testing indicated that the resource responds positively to the typical 
grinding and conventional flotation methodologies for such deposits. Even though the preliminary 
laboratory investigations indicated that an SX/EW circuit could be plausible, subsequent test 
work did not prove it to be of an economic benefit to the project. The current process scheme of a 
concentrator flow sheet appears to be viable with respect to the known mineralization of the 
deposit and is the basis for this PEA. 

The process plant, as designed, will handle 75,000 mtpd through a typical crushing and two stage 
grinding circuit. The primary flotation circuit will produce bulk concentrate which will be 
reground and further upgraded in a three stage cleaner circuit.  

The final bulk concentrate has indications that significant concentrations of arsenic and lesser 
concentrations of antimony are present. These contaminants, if left unattended, may pose a 
potential problem with the project's final smelter agreement and ultimately add to the 
expenditures of the production. For this PEA, these elements are handled as a penalty cost at the 
smelter.  

Based on current knowledge and assumptions, and within the very preliminary parameters of a 
PEA, the results of this study show that the project achieves a 15% pre-tax IRR at a copper price 
of $2.14/lb and a 12% pre-tax IRR at $1.98/lb Cu. The copper price required to produce a 
breakeven cash flow (undiscounted and post-tax) is $1.45/lb. Based on sensitivity analyses the 
project is very sensitive to copper price and grade followed by operating and capital costs.  

As with almost all mining ventures, there are a large number of risks and opportunities that can 
affect the outcome of the Cañariaco Norte project. Many of these risks and opportunities are 
based on a lack of scientific information (test results, drill results, etc.) or the lack of control over 
external drivers (metal price, exchange rates, etc.).

Subsequent higher-level engineering studies will need to further refine these risks and 
opportunities, identify new ones and define mitigation or opportunity implementation plans.  

The project is very sensitive to metal prices and requires a copper price in excess of $2.00/lb to be 
economic, assuming none of the opportunities for economic improvement are realized. The 
project may permit the hedging of metal prices to mitigate metal price risks. 

19.1 Risks and Opportunities 

The following section identifies the most significant potential risks and opportunities currently 
identified for the Cañariaco Norte project.  

Subsequent higher-level engineering studies will need to further refine these risks and 
opportunities, identify new ones and define mitigation or opportunity implementation plans.  

19.1.1 Risks 

Mineral Resource Estimate 

• Variation between the predicted and actual deposit tonnes and grade can occur from internal 
waste zones, structural geology, etc. 

• Arsenic and antimony grades were not estimated to 43-101 compliant standards as they do 
not have the necessary QA/QC requirements.  

19.1.2 Mining 
• Accurate estimates of water in-flow into the pit has not been done and could affect the capital 

and operating cost of pumping as well as the stability of pit walls. 

• Pit slope angles may be reduced potentially increasing strip ratio and decreasing in-pit 
resources. 

• Difficulties may be experienced with opening up and maintaining roads due to the steep 
terrain in periods of heavy rains. 

19.1.3 Construction and Operation 
• Project finance delay, non-availability of key personnel, construction equipment, contractors, 

and long lead times on capital equipment delivery could all affect costs. 

19.1.4 Geotechnical Conditions 

• The geotechnical conditions of the plant site, tailings management facility, waste dump and 
diversion tunnel are not currently known. Unfavourable geotechnical conditions for these 
structures could lead to an increase in construction and operating costs or, potentially, their 
re-location.

19.1.5 Waste Management 
• PAG rock volumes and characteristics have had only a preliminary review and could change 

significantly, potentially leading to higher waste dump, water treatment and reclamation 
costs. 

19.1.6 Metallurgy 
• Major process equipment sizing is preliminary, based on initial test work, and may be subject 

to revision. Metallurgical testwork is ongoing and the metallurgical parameters achieved to 
date may require revision. 

19.1.7 Power Supply 
• A reduction in the available grid power or an increase in power demand from the project 

could mean a shortage of power for the project. 

19.1.8 Environment and Permitting 
• The Cañariaco Norte project is located in an environmentally sensitive area and the inability 

to get all necessary permits in a timely manner could have a negative impact on the project 
economics; and 

• Ability to adequately manage water collection and treatment for environmental compliance.  

19.1.9 Economic 
• Changes in metal prices present the greatest potential risk to the project viability. The project 

is very sensitive to copper price and, based on current assumptions, the copper price needs to 
be above $2.25/lb for the project to achieve an after tax 15% IRR. 

• Transportation costs and smelting terms can vary significantly. 

• CAPEX and OPEX costs escalation. Numerous mining projects have experienced significant 
cost overruns in part due to equipment and labour scarcity and high commodity costs. 

19.1.10 Processing 
• Metallurgical recoveries and process plant operation may not achieve targets developed based 

on laboratory test work. 

19.1.11 Marketing 

• There is a risk that the Cañariaco copper concentrate may be difficult to market due to its 
current estimated concentrate grade of 1.3% arsenic (LOM average).

19.2 Opportunities 

19.2.1 Exploration Potential 

• The Cañariaco Norte deposit has a resource of 750 Mt of which 518 Mt are proposed to be 
mined in this study, leaving a balance of 232 Mt that could be exploitable depending on metal 
prices and operating costs. 

• The Cañariaco Sur mineral resource represents significant mineral occurrences that could 
warrant exploitation in certain circumstances. 

• The region has the potential to yield further mineral resources depending on exploration 
success. 

19.2.2 Resources  

• There is a possibility that there may be sampling and grade opportunities related to tighter 
controls and more consistent methods. 

• More tightly spaced drilling will not only allow for a more robust model which will increase 
confidence and allow for the upgrading of resources, but it could also allow for the 
continuation and "joining" of currently isolated high grade zones. 

19.2.3 Processing 

• Further metallurgical work may result in enhanced recoveries, optimization in the type and 
quantity of reagents and a reduction in the level of arsenic in the final concentrate. 

• Metallurgical test work may confirm a process to reduce the aresenic levels in the final 
concentrate. 

• There is an opportunity to optimize grind and reduce power requirements. 

• Test work planned for concentrate dewatering may prove feasible the use of less power 
intensive filtering equipment. 

19.2.4 Mining and Project Life 
• Continued strong copper prices could allow the economic expansion of the Cañariaco Norte 

pit and offer additional years to the mine plan. 

• Pit slopes may be steepened if geotechnical characterization tests return positive results. 

• The Cañariaco Sur deposit offers significant exploitation potential if copper prices are strong 
and if inferred resources can be upgraded. If this deposit is proven to be economic, the mine 
life could be increased significantly or mill throughput expanded.

• The mining schedule may be optimized whereby lower grade plant feed is held in a stockpile 
for processing after mining has ceased, thereby increasing the plant feed grade during earlier 
years of operation. 

19.2.5 Economic 

Recent world economic conditions have slowed with equipment, commodity and fuel pricing 
experiencing significant reductions. Should lower prices prevail in the long-term, the capital cost 
of the Cañariaco Norte project may also decrease significantly. 

19.2.6 Schedule 

Due to the slowdown in global economic growth, delivery times for long lead equipment items 
may decrease, which could reduce the development time required. 

19.2.7 Taxation 

A new tax regulation has recently been formally passed in Peru that would allow certain capital 
expenditures related to infrastructure to be deducted from income tax payable. All or part of the 
capital costs for access roads, power line and port facilities may become tax deductible. 

19.2.8 Port 

The capital cost estimate includes costs for a company owned concentrate storage shed and load-
out equipment at an existing port. There is a program underway to privatize ports in Peru and it is 
possible that other port facilities closer to the Cañariaco project site may be developed by third 
parties. Should an independently owned port be developed closer to Cañariaco, the potential 
exists to reduce port capital cost and significantly reduce concentrate transport costs.

20 Recommendations 
Based on the findings of this PEA, the Cañariaco Norte project starts to show the economic 
viability at copper prices above $2.00/lb, depending on the hurtle rate required. If Candente 
management deem this to be a situation worth pursuing, then they should proceed with 
information gathering to a pre-feasibility study level. Upon performing the necessary sampling 
and test work, a pre-feasibility study could be to provide construction and operational design, 
scheduling, costing and economic analysis. The following are the major recommended to 
complete a pre-feasibility study: 

• Diamond drilling of the Cañariaco Norte deposit to provide better samples and information 
for, geotechnical characterization, definition of the mineral resource to 100% indicated and 
measured classification, and ABA analysis. A 3-month drilling program is estimated to cost 
$2M. 

• Metallurgical and mineral processing tests including, but not limited to, crushing and milling 
characteristics, process recovery optimization, reagent consumption, reagent type, mill feed 
reactivity, characterization of mineralization, arsenic reduction in concentrate, etc. Estimated 
to take 6 months and $0.5M. 

• ML/ARD testing and development of a PAG-rock model. Costs are included in the estimate 
above.  

• Pursuit of environment assessment and permitting. A $1M to $2M cost is estimated. 

• Conduct a pre-feasibility study. Estimated cost of $1.5M.

Metallurgical Report (Transmin) 



METALLURGICAL REPORT - TRANSMIN MET CONSULTANTS 

1.1 Introduction 

The Candente Resource Corp. (and its Peruvian subsidiary, Compañia Minera Oro 
Candente S.A.) is an exploration company with projects in Peru and Mexico. Its 
Cañariaco porphyry copper property (Cañariaco Norte Project) is located in Northern 
Peru. Drilling and feasibility studies are currently underway.  

This report discusses the scoping and feasibility level testwork that Transmin participated 
in. Previous leaching testwork by Kappes Cassidy & Associates (KCA) and others has 
not been discussed in this report. 

The feasibility study metallurgical testwork program is being carried out by SGS 
Lakefield Chile. The current testwork program addresses the flowsheet development and 
variability testing phases. This report is based upon metallurgical results from a series of 
comminution (crushing and grinding) tests and flotation tests performed by SGS 
Lakefield Chile between April and September, 2008. Results of recent variability tests 
performed between July and December, 2008 have also been used. Both the flotation 
development and variability testwork programs are incomplete and are still in progress as 
part of the feasibility study. 

Variability results to date correspond to grinding testwork; variability flotation testwork 
has not yet been started. Metallurgical testwork has been performed on Cañariaco ore 
composites identified as CPY, MIX, ENT and SEC.  

Tests results so far indicate that traditional flotation technology could be used for much 
of the resource to concentrate copper into commercial grade concentrates with good 
recoveries. There is still further investigation required to understand the presence of 
arsenic and antimony in the resource and how they might affect the processing route 
selection and concentrate marketing economics. 

1.2 Mineralization 

Twenty eight samples from the Cañariaco project were sent to SGS Lakefield Research 
Chile. Conclusions drawn from data extracted from the QemSCAN examination of the 
mineral samples are: 

• The main copper mineral species are covellite, chalcocite, enargite, bornite, 
tennantite.  

• The main non metallic gangue minerals are quartz and micas/biotite/chlorite/clay 
group.  



• Copper sulphides are mainly associated with pyrite and other sulphides gangue 
minerals.  

• The main sulphide gangue is the pyrite. This can be found as liberated pyrite or in 
association with sulphide minerals or completed liberated in varying proportions. 

1.3 Drilling and Location 

1.3.1 Cañariaco Norte Drilling  
Copper grades in the resource are variable ranging from 0.2% and 1%. Most of the 
copper is present as sulphide minerals and there is little oxidized ore. There have been 
three drilling campaigns that have extracted samples for flotation testwork: 

• Advanced leaching, "Scoping flotation testwork" drilling (early 2007). 

• Feasibility flotation testwork (late 2007). 

• Variability flotation testwork (2008).

1.4 Sampling  

The resource was divided using the following factors to generate metallurgical domains 
for sampling: 

• Geographical areas; 

• Depth; 

• Lithology; 

• Alteration; 

• Copper grade; 

• Copper mineralization (as determined by sequential leach results); 

• Minor element grades. 

1.4.1 Sample Coding and Compositing 

Scoping Testwork Procedures 

Some 55 composites were sent to SGS Chile for leaching testwork. The classification of 
these composites was based on sequential copper analysis of twinned holes. The samples 
were half HQ core in all cases except holes 104 (CO4-007) and 106 (CO5-023) that were 
quarter core. 



From these 55 composites there were five domains that have been identified for flotation 
testwork composites. These were grouped together based on lithology, alteration and type 
of copper minerals present as follows: 

• CPY – Mainly chalcopyrite. 

• Bs. IBXP – Formed by mainly igneous breccia polylithic lithology. 

• Cu CN (Cc, Cv) – Formed from samples with mainly chalcocite and/or covellite. 

• Bs. IBXH – Formed by mainly intrusive breccia hydrotermal lithology. 

• En – Formed by samples with a high energite content logged. 

In order to prepare these samples for leaching testwork, they were crushed to 100% -25 
mm and classified into screen fractions. This material was then re-sampled and re-
composited in order to make flotation composites. To conserve budget and reduce results 
turn around time, the two breccia composites were combined into a single breccia 
composite (BS) and the enargite composite was not tested.

Feasibility Testwork Procedures 

The impact of each domain factor on metallurgical performance was again evaluated and 
it was determined that copper mineralization was more important than lithology or 
alteration, therefore the samples were grouped into four master composites. These 
composites are: 

• CPY – a predominantly hypogene mineralization type that is primarily chalcopyrite. 

• ENT – a mixed mineralization type that has elevated arsenic values from the multi-
element analysis. 

• MIX – a mixed mineralization type that contains several copper sulphide minerals. 

• SEC – a mineralization type that contains predominantly contains enriched minerals 
such as chalcocite, covellite, bornite, enargite and tennantite. These minerals are 
often thought of as secondary, but in the case of Cañariaco many have primary 
genesis. 

Samples delivered to SGS Chile were divided in 28 sub-samples. Four composites were 
made by using these 28 sorted drill samples to Table 6).  

In order to make the composites for metallurgical testing, several compositing criteria 
were initially considered which included copper residual assays, iron content, 
mineralogy, sample location and the ratio of cyanide-soluble copper to total copper. After 
a thorough analysis, the last criterion was finally chosen. This was approved by Samuel 
Engineering and Candente Resource Corp.  

The five main alteration types and the seven main rock types seen in Cañariaco Norte are 
all present in proportional amounts in the four master composites selected.

Variability Testwork Procedures 

Some 48 composites were made from 17 drillhole samples. From these, another 10 
composites were made for drop weight testing (JKDWT). Each composite consisted of 
about 100 kg of particles in the range of 12.7 m to 63.5 mm.

The metallurgical and comminution testing done at SGS included: 

• Crushing work index (CWI). 

• SAG mill comminution (JKSMC). 

• Drop weight test (JKDWT). 

• Specific gravity (SG). 

• Abrasion Index (AI). 

• Bond Rod mill work index (RWI). 

• Bond Ball mill work index (BWI) 

• SAG power index (SPI). 

Testwork results are summarized in Table 15.

ENT 98 11.3 49.8 0.1949 

SEC 96 9.2 56.5 0.0945 

In summary, SAG Power Index (SPI) values are in the range of 56 to 73 minutes. Also, 
mill work indices in the range of 9 to 12 kW-h/t indicate a generally soft to moderate ore 
type with amenability to standard comminution processing via crushing and ball milling 
or SAG milling approaches. Abrasion indices less than 0.4 suggest a slightly abrasive 
mineral. Crushing work indices which are particularly higher than 20 kW-h/t may suggest 
a mineral deposit structure of the metamorphic rock type. CWI indices, used to calculate 
crusher power requirements, describe the competency of the ore at larger particle sizes. 
The CWI indices are reported to be significantly higher than Rod and Mill work indices; 
this may be a cause for concern if SAG milling is part of the process flowsheet and 
pebble crushing may be required. 

The ball mill work index results (BWI) are significantly lower for the feasibility and 
variability composites when compared to the scoping study composites. There is no 
scoping study composite material left and this aberration can not be explained. Both 
results are from the same laboratory, equipment and procedures. 

Variability Metallurgical Testing 

The variability testwork indicates an average Bond Work Index of less than 10 kW-h/t. 
Ball mill work indices in the range of 9 to 12 kW-h/t confirm the results of the feasibility 
testwork by showing a soft to moderate ore type. Average abrasion index of roughly 0.1. 
For some composites (CP-02, CP-04 and CP-05) the abrasion indices are shown to be 
less than 0.1. This may indicate that the chosen variability composites correspond to a 
non abrasive ore unlike feasibility composites. Crushing work indices in the range of 4 to 
12 kW-h/t are typical for similar deposits, but are significantly less than those reported 
for the feasibility testwork. These results are not final and an explanation from the 
laboratory is pending. 

The following figures summarize the grindability data from the 48 variability composites 
(CP). The work indices are evaluated according to the baseline 80th percentile for 
hardness. The work index values of these variability composites are higher than found in 



the previous composites (feasibility stage). Values are roughly, 12.7 kW-h/t, 11.9 kW-h/t 
and 13 kW-h/t. for BWI, RWI and CWI, respectively. 

The composites are in the 80th percentile for abrasivity similar to the average abrasion 
index that was found in the earlier feasibility composites.  

This data is incomplete and the exercise should be repeated with complete final data.

1.5.2 Flotation Testwork 

The objective of flotation testwork was to maximize recovery and concentrate grade by 
flotation, while minimizing the operating and capital costs projected required. Where 
possible, standard conditions for all ore types were sought as the mine plan will likely 
require many ore types to be treated simultaneously under the same conditions over the 
life of the mine. The methodology was to study the effect of pH, effect of primary grind 
size, regrind size, amount and type of collector and frother on the ore response to 
flotation. The effect of sulfidization was also examined.  

Scoping Metallurgical Testing 

Primary Flotation Test 

Effect of Collectors  

Several flotation (rougher) tests were carried out to determine the best reagents to obtain 
a high copper recovery. Various flotation reagents were evaluated using a constant 
primary grinding K80 of 106 µm at pH of 10. 

The best flotation results of the three composites were obtained with the collector AP-
3894 and frother MIBC. Several test were carried out to evaluate the effect of primary 
grinding on the rougher performance (grade and recovery) using this reagent pair. 

Effect of Grind Size 

Several rougher flotation tests were carried at different particle sizes (K80 of 75, 106, 
150, 202 and 250 µm) and at pH of 10. 



There was little performance difference between P80 106 and 150 µm. The 2% recovery 
improvement from grinding down to P80 75 µm would probably be offset by the higher 
opex and capex of the primary grind and cleaner circuits as the mass pull was higher. 
Therefore, P80 150 µm was recommended for later testwork. 

Effect of Pulp pH 

Tests were carried out at P80 of 150 µm with addition of collector AP-3498 (25 g/t) and 
frother MIBC (10 g/t). The flotation tests conducted at different pH values (7.2, 11 and 
12) indicated that pH of 10 is the most convenient for the rougher flotation stage. This pH 
gave acceptable results for all of the composites tested. 

Effect of Sulfidization 

Sulphidization agents are often used to improve the floatability of semioxide minerals 
and can improve bornite flotation kinetics significantly. Tests were carried out at P80 150 
µm, pH of 10 with addition of collector AP-3498 (25 g/t) and frother MIBC (10 g/t). 
Results indicate that flotation performance (recovery and grade) was not improved by the 
addition of a sulphidizing reagent. 

Cleaner Flotation 

Tests were carried out at P80 150 µm with addition of collector AP-3894 and frother 
MIBC. The rougher concentrate was reground and floated in a circuit with two cleaning 
stage and one cleaner-scavenger. The effects of pulp pH and regrind size were evaluated. 

Results indicate that the concentrate grade is sensitive to cleaning flotation pH and 
regrind size.  

Finer regrind improved concentrate grade for all the composites tested. Results indicate 
better performance at P80 37 µm (80% passing 400 mesh) for the BS composite and CN, 
however for the CPY composite a finer grinding is required to obtain commercial 
concentrate grades (see Figure 69). 

The effect of pH is important in order to obtain good concentrate grades for the CPY 
composite. For this sample a pH of 12 was required for a good concentrate grade. For the 
other two composites, it is possible to produce acceptable final concentrate grades with 
flotation pH much lower in the cleaning stage.

Locked Cycle Tests 

A locked cycle test (LCT) is a repetitive series of batch tests used to simulate a 
continuous circuit. It is expected that the final cycles of the test should mimic a 
continuous circuit. Batch tests were continued in an iterative manner for six of cycles. 
The final products from each cycle (final concentrate and tailings), are filtered and 
removed from further processing. At the end of the test, all the products, final and 
intermediate, are dried, weighed and subjected to chemical analysis. Results are then 
balanced and a metallurgical projection was made. 

LCT objectives were: 

• Produce a closed metallurgical projection for the sample tested; 

• Assess whether the flowsheet and reagent scheme are stable in a closed circuit. 

Locked cycle test for each composite were carried out as follows: 

Primary grind:  P80 150 µm 

Primary pH:  10 

Collector:  25 g/t AP-3894 

Frother:   10 g/t MIBC 

Regrind:  P80 20 µm for CPY 

   P80 37 µm for CN 



   P80 37 µm for BS 

Cleaner pH:  12 for CPY 

   11.5 for CN 

   11 for BS 

 

Figure 7: Lock Cycle Test Flowsheet 

Stability was reached over the last three cycles for all composites. 

A recovery of 89% Cu with a concentrate grade of 25.5% Cu was achieved for the CPY 
composite. The copper concentrate grade could possibly improve with a third cleaning 
stage. 

The final concentrate grade is 26.6% Cu with 81% recovery for the BS composite. 

A recovery of 84.5% Cu with a final concentrate grade of 26.5% Cu was achieved for 
sample CN. This grade is relatively low for a mineral of secondary type. In order to 
obtain better concentrate grade it would be necessary to regrind a little finer than the K80 
of 37 µm as currently used, and a pH of cleaning higher than a pH of 11.5 for the locked 
cycle test. Subsequent mineralogy showed that fine associations with pyrite limit the final 
concentrate grade possible for the CN domain.

Feasibility Metallurgical Testing 

Primary Flotation Test 

Primary flotation was conducted with six stages of roughing. Collector and frother type 
and dosage, and pulp pH were varied to evaluate their effect on mineral flotation 
performance. The duration of each flotation test was 18 min.  

Effect of Grind Size 

Several tests were carried out at 25 g/t of collector A3894, and 10 g/t of frother MIBC. 
Tests were conducted at pH of 10 (maintained through addition of lime) and 33% solids 
density. The effect of grind sizes (75 µm, 100 µm, 150 µm, 200 µm, 250 µm) on the 
flotation performance of the main composites has been evaluated (see  

Although finer grinding improved the copper recovery, primary grinding P80 125 µm 
was deemed as optimum the CPY composite in particular showed a marked improvement 
between 106 and 150 µm. 

Tests reveal that the there is substantial variance in recovery between the composites, in 
the following order: MIX > ENT > SEC > CPY. The last two types of composites, CPY 
and SEC, yielded 85% and 86%, respectively after 6 stage rougher flotation (at 150 µm). 
CPY composite was more sensitive to primary grind size compared to the other two types 
of samples. Figure 16.11 shows a noticeable increase in copper recovery occurring when 
reducing grind size from 150 µ to 100 µm. 

Effect of Collectors 

Collector screening tests were carried out to investigate the selectivity for copper 
recovery. Tests were carried out at grind size of 125 µm and pH of 10 with collector 
types of AP-3894, AP-3330, PAX, AP-3477, AP-404, AP-3926 and AP-3302 and with 
frother (MIBC) addition.  

Higher copper selectivity was seen for all composites using collectors AP-3330, AP-3477 
and AP-3894. The addition of reagent AP- 3894 appears to increase the concentrate 
copper grade of ENT composite significantly.  

Reagents 3330 and 3477 were selected for further trials.

Effect of Frothers 

Frother screening tests were carried out on the main composites. Tests were carried out at 
grind size of 125 µm and pH of 10 with frother types of D-250, H-76 and TEB and with 
addition of collectors AP-3894 (25 g/t) and AP-3330 (25 g/t).  

The data indicates that copper recovery and grade benefit more from the use of AP-
3330/MIBC, as shown in Figure 916.12 and Figure 10.

Figure 10: Frother Screening Test (Collector AP-3477) 

Effect of Pulp pH 

Several tests on the main composites were conducted at natural pH and at pH of 9, 10, 11 
and 12. Tests were carried out at a grind size of 125 µm with addition of collector AP-
3330 (25 g/t) and frother MIBC (20 g/t). Natural pH values corresponding to composites 
CPY, MIX, SEC and ENT are pH 6.2, 6.57, 6.65 and 5.37 respectively. 

At pH 9 and 10, good performance can be obtained (recovery and grade) with particularly 
higher concentrate copper grades occurring at pH 10 for all composites. A noticeable 
decrease in copper recovery occurs at natural pH for ENT and SEC mineral samples.  

 

Sulfidization Tests 

Tests were carried out at grind size of 125 µm, pH of 10 with addition of collector AP-
3330 (25 g/t) and frother MIBC (10 g/t). The effect of the reagent NaSH addition (50 g/t 
and 100 g/t) on the mineral response to flotation was evaluated. 

The composites CPY, MIX and SEC show better copper recoveries without the addition 
of NaSH. However, the addition of 50 g/t of NaSH did slightly improve copper recovery 
for the ENT composite. 

Cleaner Flotation Tests 

Regrind Tests 

Tests were carried on the composites with a primary grind size of 125 µm, pH 10, cleaner 
pH 11.5 AP-3330 (25 g/t) and MIBC (10 g/t). NaSH was not used. Regrinds were 



evaluated at times of 4, 8 and 12 min rather than specific P80 sizes to facilitate lab work 
with small the sample mass available. Figure 11:6.14 shows a schematic of the workflow 
employed. 

The CPY composite only required 4 min of regrinding to achieve optimal grade-recovery 
relationship in batch tests. Between 8 and 12 min was required for the other three 
composites. Locked cycle tests and detailed mineralogy is required in order to further 
define the regrind requirements for each composite and for mining blends. The low 
overall concentrate grades for the CPY and MIX composites may lead to difficulties in 
producing high grade concentrates from locked cycle tests. This corresponds to a P80 of 
50 um for CPY and ENT, and a P80 35 um for SEC and MIX type ores.

Cleaner Kinetics 

Tests were carried out to determine the optimum flotation time for cleaner and cleaner – 
scavenger flotation. Tests were run at primary grind size of P80 125 µm with addition of 
AP-3330 (25 g/t) and frother MIBC (10 g/t) at pH 10. Flotation times were as follows: 

• First stage cleaner: 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 min. 

• Cleaner – scavenger: 1, 2, 4, 7 and 11 min. 

Results indicate that all main composites require from a cleaner flotation time of 3 min. 
Flotation times greater than 3 min cause the copper grades to decrease. On the contrary, 



low recoveries occur at flotation times lesser than 3 min. After locked cycle tests longer 
flotation times may be required to improve precious metal recovery or to counteract high 
re-circulating loads. 

Effect of Pulp pH on Cleaner Flotation 

Several cleaner flotation tests were conducted at pH 11, 11.5 and 12. Tests were carried 
out at a grind size of 125 µm with addition of AP-3330 (25 g/t) and frother MIBC (20 
g/t). pH 11.5 gave adequate results for all composites tested, however locked cycle tests 
are pending. 

1.5.3 Leaching Testwork 

The Cañariaco deposit contains significant levels of soluble copper minerals including 
chalcocite, covellite, digenite, enargite and bornite. As a result initial metallurgical 
testwork focussed on the assessment of the leaching characteristics of the ore. A leach 
program on 55 subcomposite samples and two master composites of potentially 
leachable samples, including both bottle roll and column leach tests was completed. 

The results of the testwork confirmed previous testwork by KCA that not all the soluble 
copper minerals in the ore were completely leachable. Results were variable and 
indicated potential recoveries of 60 to 70 percent of the contained soluble copper. 

As resource drilling continued at Cañariaco Norte, the existence of a significantly larger 
primary sulphide resource was confirmed. The fact that the potentially leachable copper 
mineralogy was now only a small part of the total copper resource combined with the 
variable copper leachability, Candente management concluded that development of the 
project based solely on a leaching process was not the best approach. The leaching 
testwork program was then discontinued and a metallurgical program was implemented 
to assess traditional grinding and flotation treatment of the Cañariaco ores. 

1.6 Recommendations 

1.6.1 Process Selection 

It is recommended that a grinding and flotation process would be able to treat more of the 
resource and would achieve higher recoveries than a leaching process. It is recommended 
that an economic trade off study be conducted between the capital and operating costs, 
versus revenue from a small heap leaching project treating only part of the deposit, and a 
large flotation project, treating all of the resource. 



1.6.2 Primary Grind 

A 2 to 6% rougher recovery benefit was realized by decreasing the primary grind P80 
from 150 to 106 um. A primary grind of 125 um was therefore selected for subsequent 
testwork. It is recommended that an economic cost-benefit analysis be conducted to 
determine the optimal primary grind for the feasibility study. The CPY composite in 
particular was the most sensitive to the primary grind and the position of this ore in the 
mine plan should be taken into consideration when making the evaluation. 

1.6.3 Regrind 

Preliminary regrind tests and locked cycle tests indicate that the CPY and ENT 
composites only require regrind P80s of about 50 um, whereas the SEC and MIX 
composites required finer regrinds of P80 35 um. 

1.6.4 pH 

It is recommended that a pH 10 rougher and pH 11.5 cleaner, adjusted using lime, will be 
suitable for most ore types. 

1.6.5 Reagents 

It is recommended that a dose of 25 g/t SNF FLOERGER 3330A type collector (SIPX) 
and 10 g/t MIBC frother will be suitable for most ore types. 

1.6.6 Retention Time 

Rougher flotation in the laboratory is complete after approximately 10 to 12 min. 

Each cleaning stage requires at least 3 min. 

A suitable scale up factor of 2 to 2.5 should be used to determine the installed flotation 
capacity of an industrial plant. 

1.6.7 Flowsheet 

A standard copper flotation flowsheet is recommended for the preliminary economic 
assessment where a rougher concentrate is reground and cleaned in three stages of 
mechanical cells or one stage of mechanical cells and one column cell. The first cleaner 
tail should be scavenged in a mechanical cell and the cleaner scavenger concentrate sent 
back to the regrind mill. The rougher tails and the cleaner scavenger tails should be 
disposed of and the cleaner concentrate should be filtered and shipped to a smelter for 
refining. 



1.6.8 Copper Recovery 

There has been sufficient flotation testwork conducted to estimate copper recovery to the 
scoping study level of confidence. In the absence of detailed variability and advanced 
locked cycle testwork, it is recommended that a recovery of 88% Cu be considered for a 
preliminary economic assessment. More testwork and mine planning information is 
required to refine the projection for a feasibility study. 

1.6.9 Copper Concentrate Grade 

There has been insufficient flotation testwork conducted to estimate copper concentrate 
grade adequately by domain, and so an average grade of 27) Cu has been  

1.6.10 Gold and Silver Recovery 

There has been sufficient flotation testwork conducted to estimate gold and silver 
recovery to the scoping study level of confidence. In the absence of detailed variability 
and advanced locked cycle testwork, it is recommended that a recovery of 55% Au and 
65% Ag be considered for a preliminary economic assessment. More testwork and mine 
planning information is required to refine the projection for a feasibility study. 

1.6.11 Molybdenum Recovery 

The head grade of the samples, sent to date, have been too low to justify recovery of 
molybdenum to a separate concentrate. It is recommended that no credits for 
molybdenum be considered for the preliminary economic assessment. 

1.6.12 Penalties 

There is arsenic and antimony in the concentrates that could incur penalties from the 
smelters. 

The arsenic recovery in early testwork was high and for the sake of a preliminary 
economic assessment it is recommended that the same recovery as copper be applied to 
arsenic. The grade of the concentrate should be calculated on a block by block basis using 
the grade of arsenic and grade of copper for each block. The resulting arsenic grade 
should be incorporated into the ore value calculation as a penalty. 

The antimony recovery in the early testwork was varied and there is insufficient work to 
date to define a specific recovery rate. For the purposes of preliminary economic 
assessment, it is recommended that a 70% recovery value be applied. As for the arsenic, 
the antimony and copper head grades should be used to calculate a concentration of 
antimony in a theoretical concentrate from each block, and the corresponding penalty 
should be calculated accordingly.
