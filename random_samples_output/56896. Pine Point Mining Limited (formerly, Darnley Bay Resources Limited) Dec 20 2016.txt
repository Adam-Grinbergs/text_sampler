1 Summary 

1.1 Property description and ownership 
Tamerlane Ventures Inc. (Tamerlane) (TSX-V: TAM), through its wholly-owned subsidiary Pine Point 

Holding Corp., controlled a semi-contiguous group of forty seven mineral claims and mining leases in the 

Pine Point District, near the south shore of Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada (the 

Tamerlane Land Package). These leases contain 42 known lead zinc deposits. The purpose of the 

technical report is to update Tamerlane's NI 43-101 Summary Technical Report, Pine Point Mine 

Development Project, Northwest Territories, Canada, March 14, 2014 ("2014 TAM") that outlined, 

assessed and provided a financial analysis for an operating scenario on 10 of 42 deposits.  The deposits 

are situated on nine of the mineral leases, on the main, south and north trends of the Tamerlane claim 

area. 

 

Tamerlane planned to develop one underground mine (R-190) and 9 open pit mines (8 Cluster Pits (CP's) 

and N-204) on the property. Subject to receiving the appropriate permits on the Cluster Pits and N-204, 

Tamerlane planned to truck a pre-concentrated lead-zinc product from the Cluster Pits and N-204 mines 

to the mill at the Main Mine Site (MMS) that is 37km along Territorial Highway 6 to the west.  The mill 

was to be located at the R-190 deposit. 

 

With development approval, the Cluster Pits and N-204 were to be sequenced prior to completion of 

mining at the R-190 underground deposit to provide uninterrupted production.  The R-190 deposit, the 

mill, the supporting infrastructure and the tailings area, permits are still current.  

Tamerlane announced on January 28, 2014 the filing by Global Resource Fund of an Application in the 

Ontario Superior Court of Justice, January 24, 2014 for termination of the proceedings of Tamerlane, 

Pine Point Holding Corp. under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (the "CCAA Proceedings") 

and issuance of a Receivership Order with respect to Tamerlane and Pine Point Holding Corp.  The Court 

scheduled to hear the application on Thursday afternoon, January 30, 2014. 

 

By Order (the "Receivership Order") of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice dated January 30, 2014, 

Duff & Phelps Canada Restructuring Inc. ("D&P") was appointed receiver (the "Receiver") of all of the 

assets, undertakings and properties of Tamerlane and Pine Point Holding Corp. (jointly with Tamerlane, 

the "Companies"). 

 

On June 30, 2015, D&P was acquired by KSV Kofman Inc. ("KSV")(the "Effective Date").  Pursuant to an 

order of the Court made on July 10, 2015, D&P's ongoing mandates were transferred to KSV, including 

acting as the receiver in these proceedings.  The professionals overseeing this mandate prior the

On October 19, 2016 Darnley Bay Resources Limited ("DBL")(TSX-V: DBL) submitted a letter of intent 

("LOI") to KSV, in its capacity as court-appointed receiver ("Receiver") of the Companies to acquire the 

Pine Point projects in the Northwest Territories (the "Properties") subject to the terms and conditions 

contained below.  Renvest Mercantile Bancorp Inc. ("Renvest"), an Ontario corporation, is the manager 

of Global Resource Fund ("GRF"), a Cayman corporation.  GRF is the most significant secured creditor of 

the Company. 

 

The terms of the Transaction are as follows; 

 

a. A payment to the Receiver of $3,000,000 payable on closing of the transaction (the "Closing 

Date"), which will take place no later than five (5) business days following the later of: (i) 

Court approval of the definitive agreement and the transaction; and (ii) TSX Venture 

Exchange approval; and 

b. The issuance of 25, 000,000 common shares in the capital of DBL ("DBL Shares") to the 

Receiver on the Closing Date.  In the event that a proposed financing is completed at a price 

per DBL Share that is below $0.20, DBL will issue to the Receiver an additional 1,250,000 DBL 

Shares for each $0.01 (or part thereof) below $0.20, up to a maximum of an additional 

2,500,000 of DBL Shares.   

1.2 Geology and Mineralization 
The Pine Point camp belongs to the class of carbonate hosted lead-zinc sulphide deposits known as 

Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) deposits, and is probably the most famous and best known Canadian 

example of this type of deposit. Nanisivik, Polaris and the Grey River deposits are other Canadian 

examples of the same geological class. MVT deposits are among the most important sources of lead and 

zinc in the world, exhibiting moderate to high grades, simple metallurgy, and easy processing and 

beneficiation characteristics. They occur in carbonate (limestone and dolomite) host rocks and are 

typically associated with the ingress of mineralizing brines into structurally prepared cavities associated 

with dissolution of the carbonate rocks by karst processes. In the case of Pine Point, this dissolution and 

mineralization process occurred on an extensive scale and was controlled by the distribution of a major 

carbonate barrier reef complex of Devonian age. A very detailed study of the geology for the Pine Point 

Mines Ltd (Cominco) Pine Point Property was compiled in a 1984 paper in Economic Geology Vol. 79 

(Rhodes et al., 1984). The Rhodes paper built on early pioneering work by H. Skall of Pine Point Mines 

Ltd (Cominco) who first described the Pine Point Reef complex in modern geological terms (Skall, 1975). 

Pine Point lead-zinc mineralization was derived from a host some distance from the present position of 

the deposits. Mineralization occurs in the carbonate sediments as open-space cavity fillings and local 

replacements. Circulating hydrothermal fluids from a possible magmatic source may have been 

responsible for the mineralization which occurs in the carbonate sediments as open-space cavity fillings 

and local replacements.  



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 
 

Page 13 of 228 
 

Descriptions of the mineralization  are taken from the PAH (2008) report, which in turn derived the 

section primarily from Hannigan (2007), Rhodes et al (1984), as well as from various Westmin and 

Tamerlane internal documents, and the observations of the PAH (2008) authors. 

1.3 Status of Exploration, Development and Operations 
Tamerlane planned to develop the Cluster Pit deposits as surface mining projects in conjunction with 

the R-190 underground deposit and the N-204 open pit deposit. The Cluster Pit's centrally located Dense 

Media Separation (DMS) is 37 km east of the R-190 deposit and proposed Main Mine Site (MMS), both 

of which form part of Tamerlane's Pine Point Project (PPP).  This Technical Report, as well as other 

environmental studies, will be utilized for the permitting required to add the Cluster Pits and N-204 

deposits to the PPP. 

 

Type A Water License and Type A Land Use Permit have been renewed for the proposed development, 

mining and processing of the R-190 deposit by Tamerlane.  These permits allow for a bulk sample of 

1,005,000 tonnes from R-190. The MMS infrastructure, including the Mill, will be situated on the R-190 

mine site. Tamerlane is poised for start-up of the R-190 operations within 24 months of receiving project 

financing. 

 

1.4 Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates 
Darnley Bay has no current reserves or resources to report for Pine Point.  All Reserves and Resources 

reported by Tamerlane in the March 14, 2014 are considered historic and are discussed in Section 6, 

History.  Per National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, Part 1 Definitions, 

Section 1.1, the definition for "early stage exploration property" states that an early stage property has 

(a) no current mineral resources or mineral reserves defined; and (b) no drilling or trenching proposed.  

Darnley Bay has no current reserves or resources to report.  Darnley Bay has not issued a plan for 

additional drilling at the time of this report.

2 Introduction  

2.1 Issuer for Whom the Technical Report has Been Prepared 
This Technical Report has been prepared for Darnley Bay Resources Limited, a corporation incorporated 

pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario.  Darnley Bay's office is located at 365 Bay Street, Suite 

400, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5H 2V1.  Darnley Bay is traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the 

symbol DBL. This Technical Report is an update of the Tamerlane March 14, 2014 Summary Technical 

Report Update of the Pine Point Mine Development Project, Northwest Territories, Canada. 

2014 TAM was prepared for Tamerlane Ventures Inc. a Corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of 

the Province of British Columbia.  Tamerlane's management office was located at 441 Peace Portal Dr., 

Blaine, Washington, USA, 98230. Tamerlane is traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol 

TAM.  

2.2 Terms of Reference and Purpose  
Mr. Jamie Levy, President and CEO of Darnley Bay requested that Paul Gann, P. Geo. complete a 

technical report updating the Tamerlane technical report of March 14, 2014 entitled "NI 43-101 

Summary Technical Report Pine Point Mine Development Project, Northwest Territories, Canada" 

("2014 TAM"). 

Cautionary Statement 

Care should be taken in examining these historical resources as some have been duplicated in tables 

according to the mining method and grade being considered.  The N-204 deposit is a prime example of 

this as two separate mining scenarios are considered. 

 

The estimates presented below as historic information have not been verified or relied upon for 

economic evaluation by the Issuer or the writer. These historical mineral resources do not refer to any 

category of sections 1.2 and 1.3 of the NI-43-101 Instrument such as mineral resources or mineral 

reserves as stated in the 2010 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral 

Reserves.  The author has read the documents pertaining to the description of the different methods 

used in the historical evaluation of the resources/reserves. The author, also acting as the QP, has not 

done sufficient work to classify the historic estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. 

Therefore, the author is of the opinion that the above quoted resources cannot be relied upon.  

In 2013 Mr. John L. Key, President and CEO of Tamerlane, requested that Albert Siega, P. Eng. complete 

a technical report entitled "NI 43-101 Summary Technical Report, Pine Point Mine Development Project, 

Northwest Territories, Canada". 

Much of the summary in the 2014 TAM Technical Report is based upon previous technical reports.  The 

2008 PAH NI 43-101 Technical Report (PAH 2008 or the PAH Technical Report) describes six underground 



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 
 

Page 15 of 228 
 

deposits of the Pine Point Project (PPP). The PAH Technical Report also defined mineral resources and 

mineral reserves for six underground deposits.  Data from this report is incorporated into this Technical 

Report. 

Mineral Reserves for six underground deposits, of which R-190 is the only one used in this operating 

scenario, were based on an internal Tamerlane Feasibility Study, which anticipated a single shaft access 

to the underground workings and drifts between each deposit. The Tamerlane Feasibility Study, which 

was independently reviewed by PAH in July 2008, found that it was economically feasible to mine the six 

deposits of the Pine Point Project with shaft access at R-190 (PAH, 2008). 

MineTech updated the PAH technical report on the six Pine Point Project underground deposits to 

reflect a change in plans from shaft access to decline access for safety reasons (NI 43-101 Technical 

Report, Pine Point Project, April 2, 2012). MineTech worked with Tamerlane to update the mine plan, 

mining schedule, and economic model for the six deposits using a decline for access for each deposit.  

MineTech also completed a NI 43-101 technical report for the N-204 open pit deposit in March, 2012. 

Albert Siega, P. Eng. authored the NI 43-101 Technical Report Update 2014, Pine Point Mine 

Development Project using the previous technical reports: the PAH (2008) technical report and the two 

2012 MineTech technical reports concerning the PPP.  Mr. Siega's work concentrated on an evaluation 

of the historical resources of the Cluster Pit (CP) area for conversion from Pine Point Mines Ltd. 

historical resources to NI 43-101 qualifying reserves.  The economics of this mining scenario includes 

extracting the CP's in conjunction with R-190 and N-204 and processing them through the MMS facilities 

at R-190.  The remaining 5 underground deposits have not been included as part of this operating 

scenario but could ultimately be phased into a production scenario. 

The scope of Mr. Siega's work includes review of and reference to the Mineral Resources and Mineral 

Reserves outlined for the CP deposits R-190 and the N-204 deposit. Sources of information and data the 

author reviewed included geological reports, maps, miscellaneous technical papers, company letters, 

memoranda, and other public and private information as listed in the References section of this report 

(section 27).  

Table 2-1 below lists some of the more significant work undertaken for and by Tamerlane in the 

advancement of the Pine Point property.

2.3 Personal Inspection on the Property 

Following the Canadian Securities Administrator (CSA) regulations within the current NI 43-101, the QP 

is mandated to conduct a personal inspection (site visit) to the property. As co-author of the NI 43-101 

report for Tamerlane Ventures Inc. dated March 14, 2014, the senior author of the Tamerlane Ventures 

technical report was the QP who conducted the personal inspection of the property. Updating of 

Tamerlane Ventures technical report, the new QP Mr. Paul Gann, is required under NI 43-101, to 

conduct a site visit. However, as this is the start of 2016 winter season, it would be difficult to conduct 

this visit during harsh winter conditions. Therefore, the QP's site visit will be postponed to the spring of 

2017, when conditions are more favorable to conduct this site visit. On completion of the site visit, 

another updated technical report will be filed as required under NI 43-101.

4.2 Location of the Property 
PPHC's Pine Point properties, including the 10 subject deposits described in this report, are located 

about 800 km north of Edmonton, near the south shore of Great Slave Lake, in the Mackenzie Mining 

Division of the Northwest Territories (NWT) of Canada. The mineral leases lie north of the Territorial 

Highways 5 and 6 which connect Hay River and the Pine Point town site, and extend intermittently from 

25 to 80 km east of the town of Hay River. An all-weather year-round highway parallels the southern 

boundary of the PPHC lease block (Figure 4-1). The PPHC leases range between 42 and 110 km from Hay 

River, NWT.  The lease areas are situated about ten km south of the Great Slave Lake and lie about 60m 

above the lake level, which is at an elevation of 156m above sea level (masl). Geographic coordinates 

are from 114
o
 to 115

o
 15' West longitude, and from 61

o

4.4 Darnley Bay's Title To and Interest in the Property 

4.4.1 Surface Rights 

The surface rights to PPHC's leases at Pine Point rest with the Crown and are administered by the 

Federal Government. Surface rights may be used in conjunction with valid mineral tenure. All the land 

within the project area is unoccupied. 

PPHC has sufficient legal rights of access to conduct development activities of the Pine Point Pilot 

Project.  PPHC is currently in the process of renewing the Land Use Permit allowing for access to do 

further exploration.  No development permits have been applied for to develop the Cluster Pits or N-

204. 

Surface access to the land is granted through the Mackenzie Valley Land Use Regulations for short term 

use of the land (Land Use Permits) or the Territorial Lands Act for long term use (Surface Leases). 

4.4.2 Obligations for Retention of Property 

Mining leases are granted for 21-year periods. They can be renewed for a further 21-year period for a 

fee of $25/acre. Yearly rental fees for leases are $1/acre/year for the first 21-year period and 

$2/acre/year for subsequent 21-year periods. 
1
 

4.4.3 Expiration Date of Claims, License, or Other Property Tenure Rights 

All leases discussed in this report are in good standing until May 9, 2028 (Table 4-1).   

4.5 Agreements and Encumbrances 
Pine Point Holding Corp., which is owned by Tamerlane, has a 100% interest in the mineral leases 

discussed in this report, subject to a 3% Net Smelter Return (NSR) payable to Karst Investments LLC 

("Karst"). The project is not subject to any other royalties, back-in rights, payments, or other agreements 

or encumbrances other than the territorial royalty (calculated as a tax but called a royalty).  The PPHC 

lands at Pine Point, of which these deposits are a part, are currently subject to a general security 

agreement for a bridge loan facility. 

 

On October 19, 2016 Darnley Bay Resources Limited ("DBL")(TSX-V: DBL) submitted a letter of intent 

("LOI") to KSV, in its capacity as court-appointed receiver ("Receiver") of the Companies to acquire the 

Pine Point projects in the Northwest Territories (the "Properties") subject to the terms and conditions 

contained below.  Renvest Mercantile Bancorp Inc. ("Renvest"), an Ontario corporation, is the manager

the Company. 

 

4.6 Environmental Liabilities 
Existing site liabilities are minimal, due mainly to the "brownfield" (i.e. previously disturbed) nature of 

the project area.  Potential liabilities for the project are mainly focused around ongoing water 

management and the need to manage groundwater discharge required during the dewatering and 

mining phases of the project. 

 

The new DMS plant should only require a water use component in the water license.  The processing 

mill at the R-190 site requires both water use and discharge components of the water license.  The 

current water license for the R-190 Project allows for consumption of 5,000 m
3
/day for mining and 

milling purposes and discharge of up to 60,000m
3
/day; design plans indicate that actual consumption 

and discharge will likely be substantially less. This reinjection rate appears sufficient to maintain water 

levels in the working areas of the mine and provides excess capacity for the initial dewatering phase. It is 

expected that process water will be supplied from the mine discharge of groundwater during the life of 

the R-190 project and that the wells and/or freeze ring holes developed for the R-190 Pilot Project can 

be used to supply process water to the processing plant throughout additional phases of the project. 

 

Groundwater in the Pine Point area is generally poor in quality and is not considered potable
2
.  There is 

some risk that process water may have to be supplied from other sources if metallurgy is negatively 

affected by the quality of the groundwater at R-190.  However, Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) 

processed 64 million tonnes of similar mineralization in a flotation circuit over 20 years using this poor 

quality groundwater.  Groundwater quality at Pine Point (Cominco Operations) was not indicated as a 

problem in milling   or process recoveries.   

 

Other resource areas studied for impact and mitigation measures as part of the process for obtaining 

permits for the R-190 Project included: noise, air quality, geology and soils, surface water, wildlife 

disturbance, vegetation and fish habitat, and socioeconomics. In all cases, the potential for adverse 

impacts associated with the project were determined to be minimal.  A number of commitments were 

agreed to by Tamerlane as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process in order to reduce 

potential adverse impacts, and they are detailed in Appendix B of the MVEIRB's 2008 report.

Cumulative impacts of the project in a regional context are considered minimal. 

4.7 Permitting 

4.7.1 Land and Environmental Permits 

Darnley Bay must obtain both a Water License and a Land Use Permit to develop the Cluster deposits (K-

68, M-67, J-68, M-62/63, HZ, W-85, O-53, X-65), and N-204. It is expected that the applications for the 

new Land Use Permit and Water License will be submitted in 2017 and approval anticipated in 2018.   

 

Tamerlane held a Mineral Exploration Permit for all of the leases in the Pine Point area. The permit was 

issued on July 2, 2009, with an expiry date of July 1, 2016.  Pine Point Holding Corp. is in the process of 

renewing this permit with approval anticipated in December 2016. 

 

PPHC also holds both a Type-A Land Use Permit for the Construction and Operation of an Underground 

Lead/Zinc Mine at the R-190 pilot project and a Type-A Water License for dewatering, mining, milling, 

and wastewater discharge purposes at the R-190 pilot project.  Both permits expire in March 2017.  

Further study will determine whether these permits will be renewed or modified for future operations 

by Darnley Bay. 

 

A more complete discussion of the existing land and water permits and upcoming permitting process for 

the new CP development is in (Section 20.2) of this report. 

4.7.2  Health and Safety Permits 

 Various aspects of underground mining must be communicated to and/or approved by the Chief 

Inspector of Mines. 

Written procedures for various underground and surface mining activities, such as providing a means for 

reversing the direction of airflow into the underground workings and examination of worksites must be 

prepared and submitted to the Chief Inspector of Mines for approval before work can begin. 

The Chief Inspector must be informed of progress at the mine during operations.  Refer to the Mine 

Health and Safety Regulations

4.8 Other Factors and Risks 
The majority of the PPHC leases are surrounded by the Akaitcho and the Dehcho Interim Land 

Withdrawals. New mineral claims and mining leases are prohibited on those lands. The Tamerlane 

mining leases predate the Land Withdrawals, and as such the Land Withdrawals have no effect on the 

surface rights of the mineral claims and mining leases discussed in this report. 

Additional permits, beyond the Land Use Permit and Water License, must be obtained from local, 

territorial and federal agencies (e.g. Boiler and Pressure Vessel Permit, Permit to Work with Highway 

Right-of-Way, Business License, etc.).  Most of these permits will need to be obtained after the detailed 

engineering design work is completed and/or once the project is funded and a firm construction 

schedule has been determined.  It is expected that approval of these permits can be obtained in a timely 

and orderly manner from the reviewing agencies. 

There are no known access problems to this mining site.  It can be accessed via highway, rail and by 

plane.  To the extent known, there are no other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, 

or the right or ability to perform work on the property.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 

5.1 Topography, Elevation, and Vegetation 
The Pine Point area is generally low lying boggy ground with karst features in the vicinity of the deposits. 

Surface topography slopes gently northward toward Great Slave Lake. 

5.1.1 Physiography 

Pine Point is located in a sub-arctic environment near 61
o
 North latitude.  Wetlands, primarily swampy 

muskeg, and shallow, marl-bottomed ponds characterize the project area topography. A blanket of 

glacial till and outwash gravel, sand and clay produce a low-lying, hummocky terrain that slopes gently 

northward toward the Great Slave Lake. The Great Slave Lake, the tenth-largest lake on earth with a 

surface area of 27,200 km
2
, has a surface elevation of 156 masl (metres above sea level). 

The north-flowing Buffalo River is the principal drainage in the Project area; the Little Buffalo River, Birch 

Creek, Hanbury Creek and Twin Creek also drain portions of the Pine Point area.  All are tributaries to 

the Great Slave Lake.  Total topographic relief in the project area is approximately 60 metres.  In general 

the surface elevation is approximately 200 MASL along the Main Trend and 180 MASL along the North 

trend (Figure 5-1).  There are some surface expressions of modern karst features, including intermittent 

creeks, natural springs, and sinkholes.  Many sinkholes have been filled by glacial debris. 

5.1.2 Vegetation and Wildlife 

 Pine Point is located in the Mackenzie and Slave Lowland MidBoreal Ecoregion.  The area is 

characterized by short, cool summers and long, cold winters.  Surface vegetation is a mosaic of upland 

and wetland plant communities.  The dominant trees in the uplands are scrub jack pine, black spruce 

and willows, which are interspersed between large wetland areas.  

 

A variety of game and non-game animal species are found at Pine Point including moose, black bear, 

deer, wolf, beaver, fox, and hares. The area is south of the normal caribou migration areas and 

northwest of the predominant wood buffalo range, although both species occasionally occur at Pine 

Point.  

5.2 Means of Access to the Property 
Access to the Pine Point mill area is by 1,100 kms of paved highway north from Edmonton, Alberta to 

Hay River and then 42 kms of paved highway to the proposed infrastructure area adjacent to the R-190 

deposit. The turnoff to the R-190 deposit is at marker 41.6 on Northwest Territorial Highway 5.  Access 

to the deposits within the project area is via gravel haul roads, most of which are of a good quality.  

Tamerlane will construct some additional haul roads to connect satellite deposits with the DMS plants 

and/or Mill. 

 

The town of Hay River has all major services including an airport with scheduled jet service from 

Edmonton and Yellowknife, a rail terminal and a port from which barge traffic traverses the Mackenzie 



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 
 

Page 25 of 228 
 

and Slave Rivers.  An airstrip suitable for small aircraft exists near the former Pine Point town site.  The 

airstrip in Fort Resolution has year-round access.  Many parts of the project claim area can be accessed 

using snowmobiles, tracked vehicles and other all-terrain vehicles during the winter months. A series of 

all-season haul roads built to service the various open pit and underground mines that were worked by 

Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) can be used to access the resource areas. Many of these roads remain 

serviceable, and summer light-truck access could reestablish access to outlying resource areas with 

repair of culverts and breaches. 

5.3 Proximity to Population Centers 
The town of Hay River, with a population of about 3,500 people, is approximately 42 highway kilometers 

west of the mill site.  The remainder of Pine Point Holding Corp. s' leased deposits is further east of the 

mill site with the most distant deposit located 120 km from Hay River.  Hay River has all major services 

including an airport with scheduled service from Edmonton and Yellowknife, a rail terminal, and a port 

from which barge traffic traverses the Mackenzie and Slave rivers. 

 

The Hamlet of Fort Resolution, with a population of about 500 residents is approximately 160 highway 

kms east of Hay River, and 120 km east of the mill site. Services in the town include an RCMP station, a 

general store, a motel, and a small airport. 

5.4 Climate 
Winter conditions are sub-arctic, with average January temperatures of -17

o
 Centigrade (

o
C).  Summers 

are hot and relatively dry with an average July temperature of +16
o
 C with long daylight periods. The 

mean annual precipitation is 34 cm, which includes 18 cm of rainfall, and the snowfall contains an 

additional equivalent 16 cm of water. Snowfall is relatively light, with maximum snow pack of one metre 

or slightly more. The frost-free season averages 95 days. Discontinuous permafrost exists in the region. 

5.5 Infrastructure 
Surface rights are discussed in Section 4.4.1. 

 

Currently, infrastructure near the project area includes a power line that connects the Taltson Dam to 

nearby communities, and an all season, two-lane, paved highway that is located within one kilometre of 

the proposed plant site. All of the land within the project area is unoccupied. 

 

This project can be considered a brownfield-type project. Historically, some of the leased areas had 

open pit and underground mining, railroad lines, power lines, processing facilities, buildings and a 

tailings dam.  

 

In 1965, an 18 MW hydroelectric plant was built on the Taltson River to supply power to Hay River, Fort 

Resolution, Fort Smith and the former Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) mine site at Pine Point.  A 274 km 

long single-circuit 115 kV transmission line connects the hydro plant to the mine site.  The capacity of 



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 
 

Page 26 of 228 
 

the electrical system was increased in 1976 to allow for an electric powered dragline.  At present the 

power line is routed from the main Hay River road to the N-81 pit and from there, along an old haul road 

to the Pine Point Substation. 

 

Open Pit mining personnel are available, both in the nearby communities of Hay River and Fort 

Resolution, and through the air and road transportation facilities at Hay River. 

 

There are sufficient potential mine waste disposal areas available in the vicinity of the proposed new 

open pits. 

 

5.6 EXPLORATION AND OPERATING SEASON    
 

The exploration season is available year round as well as 24/7. The only drawback is that during the 

short summer season, swampy ground would be hard to access, therefore for certain areas of the 

property the best exploration drilling period on surface, is the winter season. 

Darnley Bay is proposing to start an exploration program during 2017 starting with geophysics as well as 

exploration drilling on the property. Drilling will consist of exploration drilling on new targets as well as 

confirmation drilling of historical deposits. 

Historically Cominco operated Pine Point Mines 365 days per year 24 hours per day.  There are no 

reasons that subsequent operations will also follow this production schedule.

6 History 

6.1 Early History 
The following is adapted from Neil Campbell's 1957 report, Stratigraphy and Structure of the Pine Point 
Area, NWT (Campbell, 1957). 
 

 "The occurrence (at the Pine Point Property) of lead and zinc was reported in 1899 by R. Bell of 
the Geological Survey of Canada, and in the following years several claims were staked and some 
prospecting was done. In 1928 Atlas Exploration Co. took over the property containing the 
discovery occurrences.   
 
"In 1929 Cominco and Ventures Ltd. participated with Atlas in forming the Northern Lead-Zinc 
Co., which, under the direction of J. M. Bell, carried out 7,467 metres of drilling in the discovery 
and surrounding areas. Two shafts and many surface pits were also sunk. This work showed that 
the discovery deposits contained about 450,000 tonnes of lead-zinc ore, but no new orebody was 
found. 
 
"In 1936 D. F. Kidd drew attention to the highly significant space relations between the base-
metal discoveries at Pine Point and the projections of certain major Precambrian faults mapped 
earlier by C. H. Stockwell. Geological work by Cominco in 1940 and subsequent years suggested 
the presence of mineable deposits within a belt of land including part of the area of earlier field 
work and extending far beyond it. 
 
"Between 1946 and 1954 exploration financed by Cominco and Ventures Ltd. included 55,763 
metres of diamond drilling, 117 metres of shaft sinking, and 73 metres of drifting, raising, and 
underground development. This work was successful in finding substantial quantities of new ore 
in places where bedrock is completely concealed. 
 
"The topography is one of low relief, characterized in many places by swampy muskeg and 

shallow, marl-bottomed ponds marl or marlstone is a calcium carbonate. 

The area where ore has been found is generally higher ground which, though not well drained, is 
comparatively dry. It is also marked by raised beaches and a few sand dunes overgrown by small 
spruce and pine trees. Bedrock is generally overlain by a variable thickness of hard, glacial 
boulder clay. This in turn is covered by silt, sand, and gravel, probably deposited from the waters 
of Great Slave Lake, which formerly extended many miles beyond its present southern shore."  
The CNR Great Slave Lake Railway was completed in 1964 connecting Hay River to the former 
Pine Point town site. The tracks between Hay River and the Pine Point area were removed in the 
early 1990s when the former Pine Point mine ceased shipments of concentrates. 

 

6.2 Timeline 
The following section is adapted from PAH (2008), based on a report written by Ross Burns (Burns and 

Kent, 2001).

Geologic exploration of lead-zinc showings south of Great Slave Lake dates from 1898. Prospectors 

heading for the Klondike gold rush staked claims on outcrops of oxidized sulphide.  Intermittent 

exploration continued until 1948 when Cominco Ltd. began major exploration programs that continued 

until 1955. 

 
A chronological history of the Pine Point area is adapted from Burns and Kent (2001): 
 
1898  A fur trader at nearby Fort Resolution staked eight claims. When it was discovered that the ore 

contained no gold or silver the claims were allowed to lapse. 
 
1899  The deposits were reported by Dr. Robert Bell, Director of the Geologic Survey of Canada. 
 
1908  A few claims were staked but allowed to lapse. 
 
1914  Additional claims were staked by a mining engineer but these were allowed to lapse. Dr. Charles 

Camsell reported on the deposits to the Geologic Survey of Canada. 
 
1916  Dr. A.E. Cameron of the Geologic Survey made positive reports on the geology of the area. 
 
1920  Dr. J. McIntosh Bell, who had been with Dr. Robert Bell in 1899 on site,, sent an engineer, D.B. 

Dawson, to examine the deposits. This enterprise was assisted financially by certain Boston 
interests. Claims were again staked. 

 
1921  The work of 1920 was continued and reported favorably. Dr. Bell evidently considered these 

deposits to be geologically similar to the famous Tri-State lead-zinc deposits of southeastern 
Missouri. 

 
1926  W.M. Archibald, Cominco's Manager of Mines, became interested in the property and began 

forming an exploration staff. 
 
1927  W.L. McDonald and Ted Nagle (son of the original claim staker) of Cominco's new group visited 

and reported favorably on the deposits. 
 
1928  Again under Dawson, and now joined by the Atlas Exploration Company, a much more extensive 

program of churn drilling was begun. Shaft sinking was undertaken. Ted Nagle, noting the new 
activity, secured an option on 16 adjoining claims for Cominco. 

 
1929 The Boston interests, Atlas Ventures Ltd. and Cominco combined to form the Northern Lead-

Zinc Company. A 1929 - 1930 work program under Dr. Bell included sinking pits and shafts plus 
drilling. With surface showings fully explored, the resource estimate was a disappointing half-
million tons of 15% lead-zinc. Widespread surface work failed to find further indications of 
mineralization. Northern Lead-Zinc would not advance more funds, but Dr. Bell's optimism was 
shared by Archibald, who obtained Cominco financing to hold the ground. In that period 
Cominco, through Mr. Archibald, developed a corporate flying organization to explore the north 
with aircraft.

Summary Technical Report Update 2016

1930  From this year until 1948, only enough work was carried out to maintain 104 claims. This was 

undertaken and financed by Cominco. 
 
1940s  Cominco's geological staff extended geological theories and concluded that a number of 

deposits might occur in the vicinity. 
 
1948  Cominco obtained a 500 square mile concession surrounding the area of known mineralization.  

A second concession was obtained the following year. The ownership and the exploration and 
development program, which required seven years of work, was shared with Ventures Ltd. 

 
1951  Pine Point Mines Limited was formed to finance the continuing work. Cominco obtained a 78% 

interest. 
 
1961  It was in 1961 under the "Roads to Resources" program that the agreement of a railway to Great 

Slave Lake became a reality. The agreement was reached between the Federal Government, 
Pine Point Mines Limited, and Canadian National Railways whereby the Government undertook 
to construct the railway and Cominco undertook to bring Pine Point Mines into production. 
Total investment, including the railroad, mill and hydroelectric plant exceeded $130,000,000. 
The Northern Canada Power Commission agreed to build a 25,000 horsepower (approximately 
18.6 megawatt) hydroelectric plant on the Taltson River to supply power to Pine Point, Fort 
Smith and other future developments. The cost was underwritten by Pine Point Mines Limited. 

 
1962  Railroad construction began, and mining preparations were commenced with Cominco 

continuing as manager and agent of Pine Point Mines Limited. 
 
1963  A town site was laid out and services installed, in collaboration with the Department of Northern 

Affairs and National Resources. Modern bunkhouses, a dining room, recreation hall and 53 
homes were built. Stripping and construction of a 5,000 ton per day concentrator commenced 
as part of a $23,000,000 project. 

 
1964  The CNR Great Slave Lake Railway was completed in 1964, connecting Hay River to the Cominco 

mine site near the town of Pine Point. The railway reached Pine Point late in the year, well 
ahead of schedule. Construction of the power plant on the Taltson River and construction of the 
ore concentrator were not due for completion until the end of the following year. 

 
1965  Early transportation, and the availability of high grade ore averaging 50% combined lead-zinc, 

made possible ore shipments to Cominco's treatment plants in British Columbia. Ore shipments 
to treatment plants continued after the concentrator was completed in November. High mining 
interest in the Pine Point area generated a major staking rush. Late in the year the Pyramid 
Mining Co. Ltd. found a major deposit to the east of Pine Point's ground. An 18 MW 
hydroelectric plant was built on the Taltson River to supply power to Fort Smith and a 274 km 
long single-circuit, 115 kV transmission line connected the hydro plant to the Cominco mine site. 
The capacity of the electrical system was increased in 1976 to allow for an electric powered 
dragline.

1966  Pine Point Mines Ltd. acquired Pyramid's mineral claims in the area and expanded the mill to 

10,000 tons per day. 
 
1970  A test program was undertaken to determine the feasibility of mining some of the ore by 

underground methods. 
 
1975  Western Mines (later known as Westmin Resources, Ltd, or "Westmin"), acquired claims west of 

Cominco's property, which is essentially west of the Buffalo River. Westmin then proceeded to 
conduct an extensive IP survey and drilling program referred to as, "The Great Slave Reef (GSR) 
Project". This project was a joint venture of Westmin, controlled by Boliden of Sweden, DuPont 
Exploration Canada. 

 
1976-79 Western Mines Ltd. commences exploratory drilling. 
 
1979  Pine Point Mines Limited starts an intense exploration program to delineate more reserves. 
 
1983  D. Rhodes et al publish a paper on the geology of Pine Point. 
 
1985 In January 1985, Cominco reduced its 69% interest in Pine Point to approximately 51%. 
 
1986  Pine Point Mines Ltd. decides to close the mine in an orderly fashion and commences 

permanent layoffs. An attempt is made to form a grout curtain to eliminate or reduce pumping 
at the N81 ore body, containing 2.6 million tons at a grade of 7% lead and 14% zinc. The attempt 
fails due to technical problems and it is decided to mine the deposit very quickly and stockpile 
the ore alongside the pit then haul it to the mill as needed. The ore was milled and the 
concentrate stored and shipped as required over the next few years. The decision was taken to 
remove the town as well as the mill facilities and this was completed in the early 1990s and the 
tailings pond was covered with coarse material to prevent windblown tails. From the original rail 
line between Hay River and Pine Point, only the Hay River Railway Bridge and the rail bed 
remains. The four concrete pylons for the Buffalo River railway bridge are still in place. The track 
beds were contoured and set back from smaller stream crossings such as Twin Creek and Birch 
Creek to reestablish normal drainage. 

 
2000  Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) allows some claims to lapse. 
 
2001  All remaining Pine Point mining leases expire and the Westmin (Boliden)-Dupont mining leases 

expire. 
 
2001  Kent Burns Group (now Karst) stake all the Pine Point and Westmin claims. 
 
2004  Karst Investments options claims to Tamerlane Ventures. 
 
2006  Tamerlane acquires 100% interest in the Pine Point and Westmin claims, subject to a 3% NSR to 

Karst.

6.3 Prior Ownership 
When the mining leases expired in 2001, Mr. Ross Burns staked a large part of the former Pine Point 

Mine property and the Great Slave Reef property which covers the down-plunge extension to the west 

which was formerly owned by Westmin/Dupont/Boliden. The property position was transferred to 

Karst. Shortly thereafter, the property was optioned to Terrastar Incorporated, which became Pine Point 

Mines Incorporated.  In 2003, the property was returned to Karst Investments, and in 2004 Tamerlane 

acquired an option to earn 60% interest in the Pine Point property from Karst (CAM, 2007). In 

September 2006 Tamerlane acquired the remaining 40% interest in the Pine Point property making 

Tamerlane a 100% owner (subject to a 3% NSR back to Karst).  In 2011 for financing purposes Tamerlane 

created a 100% owned subsidiary, Pine Point Holding Corp., and transferred the leases and permits into 

this subsidiary. 

 

6.4 Previous Exploration 
Drilling in the district by Westmin, Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco), and Tamerlane totaled 1,308,742 

metres (approximately 4,293,751 million feet) in an estimated 18,406 core holes. All drilling is 

summarized in Table 10-1.  There was some additional exploration drilling by junior companies in the 

1970s, mainly on the eastern fringes of the district, and by Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) west of the 

district in the Hay River area. 

 

Prior to 1963, exploration at Pine Point was accomplished by grid diamond drilling, which was used to 

define a historical resource estimate.  Stratigraphic and structural models were developed for 

prioritizing the drill targets. 

 

6.5 Deposits 
Historical zinc and lead production at Pine Point is summarized in Table 6-1.

6.5.1 List of Historical Remaining Resources  

Upon the closure of the Pine Point Mine a list of remaining deposits was compiled by Pine Point Mines 

Ltd. (Cominco) (given below in Table 6-2 through 6-8).  These deposits were tabulated according to the 

mining method by which they were expected to be extracted and given the appropriate 

dilution.    Currently those deposits mentioned in these lists are considered as historical resources, 

however a large number of them have been qualified as NI 43-101 compatible reserves and resources by 

qualified people.   

Care should be taken in examining these historical resources as some have been duplicated in tables 

according to the mining method and grade being considered.  The N-204 deposit is a prime example of 

this as two separate mining scenarios are considered. 

The estimates presented below as historic information have not been verified or relied upon for 

economic evaluation by the Issuer or the writer. These historical mineral resources do not refer to any 

category of sections 1.2 and 1.3 of the NI-43-101 Instrument such as mineral resources or mineral 

reserves as stated in the 2010 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.  

The authors have read the documents pertaining to the description of the different methods used in 

the historical evaluation of the resources/reserves. The author, also acting as the QP's, has not done 

sufficient work to classify the historic estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. 

Therefore, the author is of the opinion that the above quoted resources cannot be relied upon.

Indicated and Inferred Resources.  These deposits were tabulated according to the mining method by 

which they were expected to be extracted and given the appropriate dilution.    Currently those deposits 

mentioned in these lists are considered as historical resources, and are not in accordance with the 

mineral resources or mineral reserves classifications contained in the CIM Definition Standards on 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, as required by National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"). 

Accordingly, Darnley Bay is not treating these historical estimates as current mineral resources or

The numerical and geostatistical analysis of drill sampling for the deposits R-190, X25, G-O3, P-499, 

O556, Z155 and associated mineral resource estimations, were carried out by Messrs, Craig Horlacher, 

Stuart Collins and Barton Stone of PAH, 2008, all qualified persons according to 43-101 regulations.  

Their work was reviewed and found to be adequate and is accepted by the authors; a summary is 

presented in Table 6-9 below.  The deposits in Table 6-9 are prismatic in type and generally follow the 

modeling procedures for prismatics as indicated below. PAH found no capping was required, models 

were completed using a geological boundary corresponding to approximately 1% Pb+Zn, inverse 

distance, power 2 was used for estimation.

6.5.2.2 N-204 

From MineTech 2012 (Technical Report on the Pine Point N-204 Lead Zinc Deposit), the associated 

mineral resource estimation, was carried out by Messrs Roy and Hannon both qualified persons 

according to 43-101 regulations. 

The selected block cut-off grade was 1.1% zinc-equivalent.   At this cut-off, the designed pits contained 

11.7 million tonnes of Indicated Resource with average grades of 2.9% zinc and 0.8% lead (non-diluted). 

 

The pit design was based only on blocks from the Indicated mineral resource category.  However, some 

blocks from the Inferred Resource category were within the designed pits (Table 6-10). Inferred 

Resources within the designed pits totaled 1.4 million tonnes with average grades of 2.5% zinc and 0.7% 

lead (non-diluted).

6.5.3 2014 TAM Mineral Reserve Estimates 

The 2014 TAM Technical Report operating plan was based upon mining 1 underground and 9 open pit 

deposits.  Based upon the 2014 TAM Technical Report these deposits were classified as Proven and 

Probable Reserves.  These deposits were tabulated according to the mining method by which they were 

expected to be extracted and given the appropriate dilution.    Currently those deposits mentioned in 

these lists are considered as historical resources, and are not in accordance with the mineral resources 

or mineral reserves classifications contained in the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources 

and Mineral Reserves, as required by National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"). Accordingly, Darnley 

Bay is not treating these historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves as 

defined in NI 43-101 and such historical estimates should not be relied upon. A Qualified Person has 

not done sufficient work to date to classify the historical estimates as current mineral resources or 

mineral reserves. 

The estimates presented below as historic information have not been verified or relied upon for 

economic evaluation by the Issuer or the writer. These historical mineral resources do not refer to any 

category of sections 1.2 and 1.3 of the NI-43-101 Instrument such as mineral resources or mineral 

reserves as stated in the 2010 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.  

The author has read the documents pertaining to the description of the different methods used in the 

historical evaluation of the resources/reserves. The author, also acting as the QP, has not done 

sufficient work to classify the historic estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. 

Therefore, the author is of the opinion that the below quoted resources cannot be relied upon.  

The cutoff grade for R-190 was established based on: ore body geometry, mining method, and a bulk 

sample protocol of one million tonnes.  Reserves for R-190 are as indicated in Table 15-2.  For R-190, 

reserves are based on geometry, mining method, processing parameters and the current financial model 

that incorporates an increase in operating cost for contract mining.  

Incremental cutoff grades can be employed later in the mine planning process by mine planners and 

management. Assumptions and parameters used to convert resources to reserves for the R-190 deposit 

are indicated in Table 6-29 below.

Reserves for O-556, P-499, X-25, Z-155 and G-03 are beyond the scope of this report.  Updated mine 

designs, cutoff grades and current cost models need to be developed; as a result these deposits 

previously indicated as reserves (PAH 2008) have be downgraded to resources. The current financial 

model does not include extraction of O-556, P-499, X-25, Z-155 and G-03.   The reserve estimate for the 

R-190 deposit is in Table 6-22 below.

For the CP pits and N-204, maximum NPV pits were developed using revenue factors (decrements, i.e. % 

of base prices) to generate nested pits, via the Lerch Grossman routine. Cutoff grades were further 

refined by generating cut-off grade pits using the maximum NPV pits as a guide.  These cutoff grade pits 

were re-run in the cash flow model for optimization.  Pit designs are prefeasibility level. Input 

parameters, and assumptions for the Lerch Grossman routine, used to convert resources to reserves are 

indicated in Table 15-3. Reserves for the CP pits and N-204 are indicated in Table 6-23 and 6-24.

Mineral reserves are not expected to be materially affected by mining or metallurgical considerations. 

Most infrastructure, including rail, roads and electrical power sources, are existing and in good condition. 

R-190 is fully permitted. The CP's are not currently permitted and Pine Point Holding Corp., a wholly 

owned subsidiary of Tamerlane, is currently working to secure these permits. In the QP's opinion no 

other relevant factors are expected to materially affect the reserves indicated in this report. 

6.6 Production History 
Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) commenced production on several identified deposits in 1964.  Large-

scale mining by Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) commenced in 1964 with reported reserves of 21.5 

million tonnes averaging 4 percent lead and 7.2 percent zinc (a historical figure, not compliant with NI 

43-101, reported by Giroux and McCartney, 2001). The Cominco "Pine Point Mine" was actually an 

assemblage of 46 separate open pits and two underground deposits, lying along a 35 km trend, which 

also included a mill at the Pine Point town site.  No mining took place on Westmin's Great Slave Reef 

area, located west of Cominco's Pine Point property, which extended to about five km west of the 

Buffalo River.  The deposits mined by Cominco are shown in Table 6-1.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization  
The discussion of geology below is largely summarized from Campbell (1957), Rhodes, et al. (1984) and 

Hannigan (2007), with some additions from other sources.  

7.1 Regional geology 
The Pine Point district area lies within the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (see Figure 7-1 and Figure 

7-2). At Pine Point, 350 to 600m of Ordovician to Devonian sandstones, shale, carbonate rocks were 

deposited in a shallow sea which inundated the lowland between the outcropping Precambrian Shield to 

the east and mountains to the west.

Figure 7-2.  Middle Devonian Sedimentary Facies in West-Central Canada. 

 

Source:  modified from Rhodes et al, 1984 

During Middle Devonian time, a large barrier reef complex nearly 1,000 km in length developed along a 

southwest-northeast basement ridge, restricting sea water circulation between the south side, (back 

reef) and the open sea on the north side (fore reef). As shown in Figure 7-2, the complex was more than 

10 km wide and 200m in thickness separating a closed evaporite basin in the south (the Elk Point Basin 

in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and North Dakota) from a shallow-water open-marine 

environment (the Mackenzie Basin) in the north.  

The restricted circulation caused evaporation of water from the back reef, resulting in increased salinity 

and causing the precipitation of gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), anhydrite (CaSO4) and sodium salt (NaCl), 

thereby increasing the ratio of magnesium to calcium in the back reef water column. As the magnesium 

enriched water migrated from the back reef basin through the barrier reef, the more porous calcium 

carbonate rocks were altered to dolomite.  

The various litho-facies deposited during Devonian time are remarkably consistent along the 

northeasterly strike of the reef complex, but show abrupt north-south variability across the reef from 

fore-reef to back-reef environments. There is abundant literature with details of the Pine Point 

sedimentary complex by Rhodes, et al. (1984) and Hannigan (2007). A geologic map of the rocks

encountered in drilling and in limited outcrops within the Pine Point district is shown in Figure 7-5. A 

very detailed study of the geology for the Cominco Pine Point Property was compiled in a 1984 paper in 

Economic Geology Vol. 79 (Rhodes et al., 1984).  The Rhodes paper built on early pioneering work by 

H.Skall of Cominco who first described the Pine Point reef complex in modern geological terms (Skall, 

1975). 

7.2 Local Geology 
The Middle Devonian rocks of interest in the Pine Point district are overlain by non-mineralized Middle 

and Upper Devonian rocks. These in turn are overlain by Pleistocene glacial deposits and post-glacial 

swamp deposits, which cover nearly all the surface of the district. Outcrops are rare.   

Figure 7-3 shows the facies relationships, centering on the Presqu'ile Barrier Reef in the middle, with an 

open marine environment to the northwest, and the Elk Point lagoon or sea of restricted circulation to 

the southeast. A minor uplift after Devonian time exposed the main reef to karsting, and ended the 

barrier-reef regime. The lead-zinc deposits shown in Figure 7-4 are subsequent to the depositional 

events described above (see Section 7.4).

7.3 Property Geology 
The Middle Devonian sedimentary rocks which host the lead-zinc deposits in the district are little-

deformed.  There is also extensive karstification (the dissolution of the soluble carbonate rocks), which 

occurred during a period of uplift of the sedimentary rocks. Folding is minor and generally associated 

with differential compaction of the original sediments, or karst subsidence features. Southwesterly 

trending lineaments in the underlying Precambrian basement have a 0.9m/km slope to the west 

beneath the sedimentary rocks of the district, but these do not have visible expressions in the Devonian 

rocks. 

7.4 Mineralization 
Specific formations within the Middle Devonian sedimentary sequence host the mineralization at Pine 

Point (see Figure 7-3 and Table 7-1). The most controversial and confusing facies issue was the status of 

the "Presqu'ile Formation". This coarsely-crystalline dolomite unit was formerly assigned a great 

stratigraphic and facies range, but was eventually recognized to be a diagenetic alteration of several 

different carbonate depositional facies. Thus, it has been discontinued as a stratigraphic unit, but is still 

referred to as a rock type (e.g. in drill logs). As discussed below, in Figure 7.4, the Presqu'ile diagenetic 

event is of great importance to mineralization. 

Mineralization occurs in carbonate (limestone and dolomite) host rocks and is typically associated with 

the ingress of mineralizing brines into structurally prepared cavities associated with dissolution of the 

carbonate rocks by karst processes. In the case of Pine Point, this dissolution and mineralization process 

occurred on an extensive scale and was controlled by the distribution of a major carbonate barrier reef 

complex of Devonian age. A very detailed study of the geology for the Cominco Pine Point Property was 

compiled in a 1984 paper in Economic Geology Vol. 79 (Rhodes et al., 1984). The Rhodes paper built on 

early pioneering work by H. Skall of Cominco who first described the Pine Point Reef Complex in modern 

geological terms (Skall, 1975). 

Pine Point lead-zinc mineralization was derived from a host some distance from the present position of 

the deposits. Circulating epithermal fluids from a possible magmatic source may have been responsible 

for the mineralization which occurs in the carbonate sediments as open-space cavity fillings and local 

replacements. 

Descriptions of the mineralization below are taken from the PAH (2008) report, which in turn derived 

the section primarily from Hannigan (2007), Rhodes et al (1984), as well as from various Westmin and 

Tamerlane internal documents, and the observations of the PAH (2008) authors. 

Table 7-1 indicates how the lead-zinc mineralization is limited to the specific listed stratigraphic units, 

with most deposits transgressing lithologic boundaries.

Shale within the Lower Keg River Member is a useful marker horizon, as it is continuous across the 

district. The "E" facies, consisting of unmineralized, brown, sucrosic dolomite, underlies nearly all 

mineralization, and thus most drill holes terminate in this rock unit.

7.4.1 Distribution of Resources 

The Pine Point District contains 97 known lead-zinc mineralized areas. These are distributed along three 

trends designated the North, Main and South trends which extend over 68 km along strike and 6 km in 

width. Cominco mined 48 of these deposits during the period from 1964-1988. The distribution of these 

deposits is shown on Figure 7-7. The Tamerlane Leases cover 72 of the 97 mineralized areas, including 

42 of the 45 known mineralized areas in the district which have not been mined.

7.4.2 Controls on Mineralization 

As summarized by Hannigan (2007) mineralization occurs as sphalerite, galena, marcasite, and pyrite, 

replacing karst-filling sediments and breccias, open-space filling, and peripheral disseminations in vuggy 

porosity. The mineralization occupies the most permeable portion of the highly porous Presqu'ile barrier 

complex (i.e. the Pine Point and Sulphur Point units). The highest-grade mineralization seems to be 

restricted to karstic structures hosting the greatest amount of infilling sediments. The most typical host 

lithology for ore-grade mineralization is the coarse-grained vuggy Presqu'ile dolomite, which has 

replaced permeable reef facies. 

Collapse breccia is formed by the upward sloping of the roofs of karst caverns and is seen as a diluent in 

many of the prismatic ore bodies and distinct horizons within the stratigraphy that can often be traced 

as distinct zones of rubble within the ore.  It is not unusual to find areas of mineralized rock having two 

or more collapse structures. Mineralized rock is occasionally incorporated as fragments into later stages 

of collapse breccia. Since these multiple collapses represented very large caverns, usually of the 

prismatic type, the largest mineralized zones are most frequently of this type. 

The grade of mineralization varies widely, with the highest grade zones being in open-space-filled 

deposits where the mineralization formed without dilution by the host rock. The deposits lie along three 



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 
 

Page 56 of 228 
 

well-defined linear trends (North, Main, and South trends). These trends appear to coincide with 

southwesterly striking lineaments, forming a "hinge-line". These Precambrian basement rocks, outcrop 

in the northeast. 

Subtle tectonic adjustments along these lineaments contributed to the evolution of numerous paleo-

environmental facies within and adjacent to the barrier complex. These lineaments are approximate 

projections of the underlying Precambrian McDonald-Great Slave Lake fault system. 

Minor differential vertical movements on these breaks during Paleozoic times apparently created the 

"hinge zones" in the Devonian sediments, which controlled sedimentation (e.g. the position of the 

barrier reef on a slight topographic high), as well as post-Devonian alteration (karst development and 

Presqu'ile dolomitization) and mineralization (lead-zinc deposits). These basement lineaments may well 

have controlled several aspects of the mineralization: 

 creation of the carbonate reef complex as a host 

 preparation of that host by increasing the porosity of the rock through dolomitization and 

increased permeability through uplift & fracturing leading to karst development 

 circulation of metalliferous fluids through a combination of emission of fluids of crustal 

origin and migration of metalliferous formation waters from shales though the receptive 

carbonates during differential movements. 

 

All Pine Point deposits are hosted in Middle Devonian carbonate strata within or adjacent to the 

dolomitized barrier-reef complex. The mineralization occurs in interconnected paleo-karst cavity 

networks that are directly related to certain lithofacies and their behavior during episodes of uplift and 

karst formation. The deposits are strongly controlled by individual stratal horizons, although many 

deposits are discordant. The coarsely-crystalline dolomite alteration of the Presqu'ile dolomite event is 

also a key control for many deposits. 

 

Epigenetic sulphide mineralization occurs as open-space fillings and local replacement of carbonate 

strata. The main mineralization stage at the Pine Point property witnesses a repetition of diagenetic 

processes, such as karst formation (i.e. solution, fracturing, collapse), dolomitization, calcite deposition, 

and introduction of sulphides and organic derivatives (bitumen and sulphur). 

7.4.3 Ore Mineralogy and Paragenesis 

The sequence of events leading to the emplacement of mineralization at Pine Point, began with karst 

development, and diagenetic alteration of the original rocks, which were mostly composed of calcium 

carbonate. 

Karst development apparently occurred at several periods, beginning with the slight uplift after 

Devonian and before deposition of the Watt Mountain Formation. Later karst events occurred after 

Watt Mountain time. 



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 
 

Page 57 of 228 
 

The diagenetic history began with several stages of calcite recrystallization and dolomitization adding 

magnesium (Mg), as shown in Figure 7-8. This part of the history is typical of marine limestone in 

general. The conversion of calcite to dolomite by circulating fluids commonly involves a volume loss of 

as much as 13%, resulting in increased porosity and permeability of the rock, thus further enhancing 

further fluid flow. 

Several pre-ore stages of dolomite are recognized, including the coarse-grained rhombic dolomite 

replacement which is referred to as Presqu'ile dolomite. The Presqu'ile type of dolomitization has 

affected 60% to 70% of the barrier-reef rocks (Hannigan, 2007).  The ore-stage events resulted in 

deposition of sphalerite, galena, and other iron sulphides (pyrite and marcasite) in open spaces, and as a 

replacement of carbonates. 

Apart from minor surficial oxidation products, zinc is present only as sphalerite, which is typically 

coliform, i.e. as crusts and radiating microcrystalline masses of light to dark brown sphalerite lining 

former vugs and in massive replacements of individual beds; however, sphalerite may also be present as 

coarse, subhedral crystals. Galena is the only important lead mineral, and tends to form crystalline 

masses nested inside sphalerite, toward the centers of former vugs (Figure 7-9) or as massive 

replacement of individual beds. Large, euhedral galena crystals are rare. Marcasite and/or pyrite occur 

in lesser amounts with occasional pyrrhotite, celestite, barite, gypsum anhydrite, and fluorite. Where 

lead-zinc mineralization occurs as large open space fillings, it is often very pure and finely crystalline. 

There is ample evidence that the carbonate rocks of the barrier reef complex were host to oil and gas 

deposits prior to and/or during the formation of the lead-zinc mineralization. Tarry bitumen and brittle 

pyro-bitumen occur within the upper portions of the deposits, especially in areas capped by 

impermeable shale, such as the North Trend tabular deposits. In other areas, bitumen can be found in 

vugs and sometimes filling fractures in the collapse breccia. All the mineralized cores at Pine Point 

contain some volatile hydrocarbon compounds. Hydrogen sulphide gas was reported by Westmin in a 

few drill holes (e.g. Westmin, 1981, page 4).

Based on fluid-inclusion data, the ore-stage depositional temperatures were 90-100°C higher than could 

be accounted for by burial alone. Thus, a source of epithermal fluids is suggested, although no source of 

hot basinal fluids or magmatic heat has been noted in or near the district. 

Post-PEM events include the deposition of minerals in remaining vugs. These minerals include early 

dolomite and later calcite, in addition to crystalline sulphur, bitumen, and rare fluorite. In some 

intervals, sulphur and bitumen may each comprise 1% of the rock volume. Native sulphur apparently 

formed by bacterial reduction of sulphur compounds related to the hydrocarbons. 

Because most of the PEM-stage and post-PEM minerals fill open spaces or massively replace host rock, 

much of the porosity which existed in the pre-PEM stage due to natural deposition or early 

dolomitization has been eliminated in lead-zinc mineralized rock. This is visible in Fig 7.9.

7.4.4 Deposit Morphology and Size 

According to a study of historical production by Hannigan (2007), the 48 lead-zinc deposits mined by 

Cominco averaged 1.32 million tonnes of lead-zinc ore, grading nearly 7.0% zinc and 3.0% lead. The 

deposits ranged in grades between 0.4% - 8.8% lead and 2.8% - 14.1% zinc. The iron content of 

individual deposits ranged from less than 0.5% to nearly 10.5%, averaging 3.5%.  

Four distinct deposit morphologies have long been recognized in the district: tabular, normal prismatic, 

abnormal prismatic, and B-spongy. Each of these morphologies is inherited from different types of karst 

cavities. These types are discussed at great length by Rhodes, et al. (1984), and are summarized by 

Hannigan (2007). 

All six of the PPP underground deposits and W-85 are of the normal prismatic type.  The other deposits 

are generally tabular in nature, while the abnormal prismatic and B-Spongy are developed in portions of 

the reef where deposits are not normally found. 

7.4.4.1 Prismatic Deposits 

Normal prismatic deposits occur as fillings of collapse breccia pipes formed by intense karstification. 

These bodies are sub-circular in outline, and typically extend through 50 - 100m of stratigraphy, of which 

30 to 50m may be mineralized. The collapse pipes tend to end at the level of tabular channels, i.e. at a 

paleo-aquifer. Sulphide minerals replace fine-grained post-karst infill sediments and fill cavities. To a 

lesser degree, sulphides may replace large breccia fragments. Normal prismatic deposits comprise most 

of those in the Main and South Trends, and only a few of those on the North Trend. 

There is some suggestion of zoning, both within individual deposits, and within the district, although no 

simple pattern has emerged. According to Hannigan (2007), Pb/(Pb+Zn) ratios of Pine Point district 

deposits range from 0.06 to 0.56 giving a district average of 0.26. Weighted averages of lead and zinc in 

various deposits from the upper and lower portions of the Presqu'ile barrier indicate weak vertical metal 

zoning. In the upper barrier, a weighted average Pb/(Pb+Zn) ratio of 0.20 indicates that these deposits 

are slightly richer in zinc than deposits occurring in the lower barrier (0.26). Kyle (1981) reported a 

district-wide pattern of metal zoning as determined from ore-reserve data at that time. He indicated 

that the Pb/(Pb+Zn) ratio increases from about 0.2 in the southeast to about 0.5 in the northwest in 

zones parallel to the Main and North trends. However, a weighted average calculation of the Pb/(Pb+Zn) 

ratio on deposits along the entire length of the Main Trend, reveals a consistent ratio of 0.36, thus 

indicating the lack of a district-wide lateral zoning pattern. 

Deposits of the normal prismatic variety are generally lead-rich ratio of 0.35%. There is also a distinct 

lead high associated with the Main trends normal prismatic deposits whose ration average nearly 0.37%, 

while normal prismatic deposits in the North and South trends whose ratio average nearly 0.25%. 

Abnormal prismatic deposits, present in all trends, are relatively zinc-rich whose ratio average nearly 

0.25%. Some of these bodies are zoned with a lead-rich core, passing outward into a zinc-rich zone and 

enveloped by an iron-rich aureole. The areal distribution of iron-sulfides is wider than galena and

sphalerite and the Fe/(Fe+Zn+Pb) ratio increases outward from prismatic deposits. There are relatively 

small barren sulphide bodies in the district, consisting mostly of iron sulphides with minor lead and zinc. 

7.4.4.2 Tabular Deposits 

Tabular deposits occur in underground stream channels formed at the water table level at the time of 

karsting.  The tabular deposits are characteristically long, narrow and sinuous and are often found at the 

base level of the prismatic deposits.  The deposits can occur as open space filling of caves or as 

disseminated deposits within porous dolomites.  

On the Main Trend, the tabular deposits tend to be low grade and disseminated through a larger volume 

of rock, while the North Trend tabular deposits, which are capped by the Buffalo River shale, tend to 

develop large flat openings capped by shale.  Examples of this are the X-51, X-52 and X-53 pits where the 

evidence for a shale "trap" can be observed in places, as the presence of up to 5 feet of bitumen at the 

top of the deposits.  This is strong evidence that petroleum brines occupied the karst openings and 

contributed to the coarse dolomitic alteration which has been designated as the Presqu'ile dolomite. 

The North Trend tabular and prismatic deposits are known to contain germanium in recoverable 

amounts however; the main trend ores do not contain this metal.  The North Trend tabular deposits 

tend to be much more focused due to the shale cap, than the Main Trend tabular deposits, with grades 

up to 35% Pb+Zn.  The Z-64 deposit however, which lies slightly south of the X-65 - Y-65 high grade 

underground mineable tabular deposits, was a diffuse low grade tabular deposit similar to that found on 

the Main Trend.

8 Deposit Types 
The Pine Point camp belongs to the class of carbonate hosted lead-zinc sulphide deposits known as 

Mississippi Valley Type (MVT), and is probably the most famous and best known Canadian example of 

this type of deposit. Nanisivik, Polaris and the Grey River deposit are other Canadian examples of the 

same geological class. MVT deposits are among the most important sources of lead and zinc in the 

world, exhibiting moderate to high grades, simple metallurgy, and easy processing and beneficiation 

characteristics.  

Bell (1929) recognized the similarity between the Pine Point area and the lead-zinc deposits of the Tri- 

State area of Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma. The characteristic features of Mississippi Valley-Type 

mineralization include development of karst in the carbonate host rocks, dolomitization, and the genetic 

association of evaporite deposits and hydrocarbons. All of these features are present in the Pine Point 

District (Hannigan, 2007). 

8.1 Mississippi Valley-Type Deposits 
A concise definition of Mississippi Valley-type deposits is the following: "Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) 

lead-zinc deposits are a varied family of epigenetic ore deposits that form predominantly in dolostone 

and in which lead and zinc are the major commodities." (Leach et. al, Date Unknown).   

8.2 Geological Model(s) 
Lead-zinc mineralized rock of the Pine Point District is hosted in paleokarst cavities within a Middle 

Devonian carbonate barrier complex (Figure 8-1). Karst topography is developed by dissolving the 

carbonate rocks thus creating caves and channels (Figure 8-2). These openings are enlarged as more 

rock is dissolved with a fluctuating water table.

8.3 Deposit nomenclature at Pine Point 
During the exploitation of Pine Point, a total of 52 open pits and 2 underground (PAH PPP 43-101 Final) 

deposits were mined totaling 64 million tonnes of ore.  These deposits included 50 deposits that were 

mined as open pits and 2 that were mined using underground mining methods.  Two main terms were 

used to designate the deposit types.   

Prismatic deposits referring to vertical cave fill deposits that have a large vertical axis relative to their 

diameter.   

Tabular deposits refer to underground stream filled deposits that have a long horizontal axis relative to 

their vertical axis.   

8.4 W-85 (North Trend Cluster Pit) Open Pit Deposit 
The W-85 deposit is located at 60

o
50'54"N and 114

o
50'15"W at an elevation of 572 feet above sea level.  

The deposit is currently accessed by a 4-wheel drive exploration road which connects to the main haul 

road at the N-81 pit, however, the north haul road comes within about 100 meters from the deposit but 

is not accessible by foot or vehicle due to swampy ground (Figure 8-3).   

The W-85 deposit lies at the west end of the North Trend.  Surface outcrops are rare in the region.  

Overburden consists of clayey glacial till with occasional gravel beds and areas of varved clays and 

cemented fine sands, and varying in thickness from 3 m to 45 m (Durston 1979), generally becoming 

finer with depth.  The glacial till forms an effective confining layer and has a shallow water table 

established in it (Stevenson 1983). This material is often overlain by an organic, peaty layer of muskeg 

that is up to 3 m thick Bedrock in the vicinity of the W-85 project site consists of a sequence of gently 

folded, west-dipping, stratified rocks, associated with a Devonian reef complex. The main stratigraphic 

units (from top to bottom) are as follows: 

 

1. The Slave Point Formation limestone/dolomite is a light beige dolomite or limestone which has 

pitted and scattered vuggy zones and contains shaly beds called the Amco Shale which is a dark 

grey, argillaceous, micritic limestone sequence up to 15 m thick.  The Slave Point dips gently 

westward. The Watt Mtn. Fm. is bright blue green shale with interbeds of grey limestone that 

may be gritty, fossiliferous or micritic in nature.  The Watt Mtn. Fm. dips gently to the west. 

2. The Buffalo River Formation is a grey- green shale which laps the northern face of the reef and 

dips and thickens to the north. 

3. The Pine Point Formation is the main reef which plunges gently to the southwest.  It is has a 

large variation of rock types ranging from the beige dolomitic E facies sandstone that forms the 

main part of the reef to coarsely fossiliferous dolomite and limestone which have localized the 

mineralization into trends.

Figure 8-3.  Location map of W-85 and X-65. 

 

8.1 X-65 (North Trend Cluster Pit) Open Pit Deposit 
The X-65 Deposit is a North Trend tabular deposit located 15km, by existing roads, north of the 

Provincial Highway 6, which is the paved road from Pine Point to Hay River.  It is 10km north of the 

Cluster Pit area by existing haul roads (Figure 8-3) and will utilize the DMS circuit at the Cluster Pit area 

for upgrading.  Currently the closest electrical power is located on the main haul road 5 km to the south. 

The mineralization is hosted in the B-Reef Substrate (BRS) facies of the Pine Point Formation (Fm) and 

may persist in collapse zones up to the overlying Watt Mountain Fm.  The Buffalo River Fm overlaps the 

Pine Point Fm and is overlain itself by the Watt Mtn Fm (Figure 8-4).  The Buffalo River Fm shales have 

formed a barrier to karsting and mineralizing fluids which intensified the mineralizing process by forcing 

the fluids to move laterally.  The BRS facies consists of abundant white fossils encased in a dirty brown 

dolomite and is often extremely vuggy due to the solution of the fossil material.  Drilling often 

encounters poor recoveries in the BRS although it is the main mineralized horizon.  In spite of the poor 

recovery in some areas the reserves in prior pits on the north trend have reconciled well.  This is thought 

to be due to the fact that when mineralization is present it cements the host formation sufficiently to 



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 
 

Page 66 of 228 
 

allow good core recovery in mineralization.  The overlying Buffalo River Fm is a grey-green shale with 

short limestone or dolomite layers.  The Buffalo River Fm. can be very muddy and unconsolidated in 

karsted zones.  The Watt Mtn Fm is a shaley limestone which contains a very distinctive blue-green shale 

that can be traced through collapse zones due to its unique color.

8.1 The (Main Trend) Cluster Pits 

The Cluster Pits are located along the main Pine Point haul road and hydro power from the main 

transformers at the old Pine Point mill site is located along the side of the haul road.  The main haul road 

is easily accessed in the Cluster Pit area at K-57 where a gravel road connects the haul road to the main 

paved road from Hay River.  The deposits are about 4.0 km north of Provincial Highway 6 which links the 

towns of Hay River and Fort Resolution.   The Cluster deposits are located between 32-35 kilometres 

east of R-190 where the mill will be constructed.  

These deposits are located on the Pine Point Main Trend and are about 45 meters below the surface. 

The reserves from the deposits will be mined by open pit methods and hauled to a central dense media 

separation (DMS) plant. The DMS concentrate will be hauled to the R-190 mill for final flotation

separation into a lead and zinc concentrate, which will then be hauled to the rail load-out station in Hay 

River.  

Tamerlane Ventures Inc. conducted confirmation drilling between 2007 and 2008 on M-67 and L-65 and 

the Hinge Zone (Table 8-1).

Inclined drill holes were drilled on M-67 in a fan pattern, designed to intersect and confirm significant 

mineralization in three historical drill holes drilled by Pine Point Mines Ltd.(Cominco).  Six drill holes 

were drilled on L-65, three of which were inclined drill holes drilled to confirm prior mineralization 

discovered by Pine Point Mines Ltd.  The three other drill holes on M-67 were drilled as exploration 

holes to determine if mineralization was continuous between M-67 and L-65.  Six holes were completed 

on the Hinge Zone HZ08-TV1 to HZ08-TV-08.   Holes TV05 and 06 were not drilled. 

A total of 653m, 354m, and 650m were drilled on L-65, M-67 and HZ respectively. The results of the 

drilling (M-67, L-65) suggest that both deposits are contiguous and represent a long tabular style 

deposit. More drilling is necessary to confirm that these deposits are connected and currently they are 

being assessed as separate deposits.  No confirmation drilling was done on the K-68, M-62, M-63, O-53, 

J-68 deposits as the original Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) or Westmin drilling has been confirmed in 

every deposit to date with holes twinned by Tamerlane.  It is the author's opinion that no further drilling 

is necessary on the known deposits to include them into the reserve category.  It is recommended that 

any future drilling be used to examine the potential continuity between Cluster deposits. 

The Cluster Pit area contains several prismatic deposits and a long semi-continuous string of tabular 

deposits which are located south of prismatic deposits that have been mined by Pine Point Mines Ltd 

(Cominco).  The prismatic deposits that have been mined include J-69, M-64, I-65, K-57 and K-62 and as 

a result the haul road and power line pass just north of most of the existing Cluster Pit deposits which 

remain (Figure 8-5).  The tabular Cluster Pit deposits are typical sinuous underground stream hosted 

deposits.  These tabular deposits weave amongst the prismatic deposits with the prismatic deposits 

representing vertical cave formation periodically along the length of the underground stream.  The 

deposits are hosted by the Sulphur Point Formation which overlies the Pine Point Formation in the area.

The Sulphur Point is a white limestone/dolomite which has been karsted in this area and is the main 

host.  D2, which is the fossiliferous facies of the Sulphur Point (FM), forms bioherms (a circumscribed 

mass of rock exclusively or mainly constructed by marine sedimentary organisms), which are the focus 

for the karsts that host mineralization in the Cluster Pit area.

9 Exploration 

9.1 Exploration History 
Between the 1960's to 1980's, major exploration programs were carried out in the Pine Point district, 

principally by Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) and Westmin.  Due to the extensive (99 percent) glacial 

cover, varying up to 50m in thickness, exploration surface methods (geologic mapping, rock 

geochemistry) were ineffective as there are few outcrops in the district. Three exploration methods 

were utilized: drilling, geophysics and geochemistry. 

9.1.1 Drilling 

Prior to 1963, exploration in the district was accomplished by grid drilling, followed by shaft sinking.  By 

1963, drilling had successfully delineated nearly eight million tonnes of PEM averaging 2.6% lead and 

5.9% zinc contained in several PEM bodies.  In addition, stratigraphic and structural models had been 

developed for prioritizing drill targets. Drilling in the district by Westmin, Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco 

Ltd.) and Tamerlane has totaled approximately 1,308,742m (4,293,811 feet) in 18,422 (PAH 2011) 

diamond drill holes which are outlined in Table 10-16. 

 

Drilling is discussed in Section 10 and Tamerlane's current database includes 18,406 drill holes totaling 

4,293,751 feet or 1,308,742m.  At current 2013 drill costs, this represents approximately 150 million 

dollars of drilling that has been completed on the Pine Point Property. During 2010 Tamerlane drilled 23 

confirmation holes totaling 1433.01m at the N-204 deposit. Drilling was carried out by Darrell's Welding 

based out of Hay River. 

9.1.2 Geophysics 

The PEM at Pine Point consists of sphalerite, galena, marcasite and pyrite.  This combination of minerals 

is not responsive to normal electromagnetic survey techniques however they do respond to induced 

polarization (IP) techniques, which was responsible for most of the discoveries to date.  Induced 

polarization (IP) geophysical methods were introduced to the Pine Point district in 1963 and proved 

successful and increased the mineral inventory of the district.  

 

The mineralization contains sufficiently high concentrations of the conductive minerals galena, pyrite, 

and marcasite to make the IP method feasible.  Sphalerite is a non-conductive mineral.  However, in 

these deposits the electrical continuity among conducting minerals is poor, making standard 

electromagnetic (EM) methods ineffective. The galena is often surrounded by nonconductive and non-

polarized sphalerite, and abundant limestone and dolomite gangue, which interrupt the conducting 

paths. 

 

Seismic surveys were successful in identifying karstic collapse structures on certain horizons of interest. 

At least one seismically identified brecciated collapse structure was confirmed by drilling.  Gravity 

surveys also were able to confirm the presence of mineralization but were not widely used. 



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 
 

Page 72 of 228 
 

 

Tamerlane completed no ground based geophysical surveying, however, in 2004 an Aeroquest Modern 

detailed helicopter borne TEM and Magnetic surveys were conducted over the entire property totaling 

3,050 km.  The survey was conducted at 200m spacing's and was interpreted by Stratagex, resulting in 

the location of 34 anomalies of interest, which have not been followed up.  Should this method prove 

effective, it would significantly decrease future exploration costs. 

9.1.3 Geochemistry 

Attempts to locate Mississippi Valley-type mineralization in the district by rock and soil geochemistry did 

not prove to be economically effective. 

9.2 Historical Exploration Methods and Drill Core 

9.2.1 Past Exploration 

The Pine Point Barrier Reef, which hosts the lead-zinc deposits is extensive and plunges gently westward 

from Pine Point where its erosional edge is found.   The reef continues southwest several hundred miles 

during which the deposits gradually become deeper as the reefs hosting them, plunge deeper toward 

the Rocky Mountains. Lead and Zinc mineralized carbonates have been intersected during the 

exploration for hydrocarbons at over 609.6m (2,000 feet) in depth.  Refer to Table 10-16 for a listing of 

all historic drilling. 

Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) restricted its primary exploration west of the mill to a zone where ore 

haulage to the mill was deemed economic. Beyond the N-81 deposit, which was the farthest west and 

last deposit to be mined, exploration was curtailed to wide spread IP surveys looking for large deposits. 

Within this area only one deposit, G-03, was discovered.

Page 73 of 228 
 

10 Drilling 
The early drilling by Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) utilized churn drilling which proved to be 

unsatisfactory and was replaced by AX diamond drilling and subsequently by AQ sized drill core.  BQ 

diamond drilling replaced AQ in the late 1970's and was itself replaced by NQ coring in the 1980's with a 

significant improvement in core recovery and fewer problems caused by down-hole caving.  Core 

recoveries varied and both AQ and BQ core had poor recoveries in karsted zones.  NQ core plus the use 

of drill mud recovered in excess of 98% and rarely fell below 85% recovery from the early 1980s until 

Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) closed.  The core recoveries were shown to be adequate for reserve 

estimation as the deposits mined by Pine Point Mines Ltd. all reconciled positively with respect to the 

reserve calculations based on drill core. Westmin Resources used BQ drill core. Tamerlane used NQ core 

exclusively.   

 

The Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) drilling program was based on the premise that shallow deposits in 

the eastern part of the district were more valuable than deeply-buried deposits further west.  As the mill 

was located in the eastern part of the district, haul distances were consequently greater for deposits 

located in the west.  Therefore, the target size for identifying resources increased toward the west, 

resulting in greater drill spacing.   

 

Westmin Resources also modeled their geologic practices on those observed at Pine Point, such as the 

use of vertical drilling to reflect the true thickness of the stratigraphy and avoid blocky drilling. Every 

collar survey record in the historic drilling was completed using vertical holes which were not surveyed. 

This method avoided caving in the drill holes and promoted more efficient and faster drilling.  For all 

holes with a vertical inclination, drill intercepts were assumed to represent true stratigraphic thickness, 

since the strata dip less than one degree towards the southwest. 

 

The core from the Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) drilling is stored in an area called the Back 40 and can 

be reconstructed, less the mineralized zones, if care is used.  Drilling completed by Westmin Resources 

was laid out on the ground, resulting in the core boxes rotting and the core being scattered on the 

ground and currently in very poor condition. 

 

The drilling carried out by Tamerlane during 2010, utilized both vertical and angle holes to provide 

confirmation data on the deposits that it examined (Figure 10-1, Figure 10-2).  Angle holes drilled proved 

difficult due to down-hole caving problems.

10.1 N-204 Drilling Summary  

10.1.1 Tamerlane Drilling 

Confirmation drilling by Tamerlane during the 2010 field work on N-204, consisted of 23 inclined cored 

drill holes. Hay River based ProCore Drilling, carried out the program.  Drilling was carried out between 

February and March, 2010.  Noteworthy mineralization was intersected in all 23 drill holes (Table 10-1). 

Table 10-1.  Drilling summary at N-204. 

 

All drill sites were reclaimed following the end of the drilling program. All the holes drilled were angle 

holes which ranged between -50° to -67° dip. Inclined drilling provided the ability to drill multiple holes 

in several different directions from the same drill pad, thus minimizing environmental disturbance. 

Water for the drilling was accessed from a borrow pit and trucked to the various sites. The drilling was 

designed to verify the grade and extent of the mineralization and to provide core for RQD 

measurements as well as metallurgical testing. Good drilling practices also provided better core 

recovery.  Figure 10-1 shows a plan view of the drilling completed to date at N-204.  Figure 10-2 shows 

the historic Cominco exploration holes with the Tamerlane holes and section lines overlain.  Figures 10-

5, 10-6, 10-7 and 10-8 show cross sections of the deposits with their assays. Table 10-2 lists the

mineralized intersections. Table 10-3 compares these intersections to the historic holes drilled by Pine 

Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco).  Table 10-4 lists the drill-holes with their down-hole surveys.

Tamerlane conducted a drilling program that consisted of 23 angle holes totaling 1,433.01 m (4701 feet) 

which were used to: 

 1. Provide metallurgical samples for the Dense Media Separation 
2. Confirm historic grades and tonnages 
3. Test the recoverability of core using good drilling practices 
4. Provide RQD on the drill core data for the geotechnical studies

10.1.2 Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) 

To increase the recovery of the core from the drill holes, Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) drilled all the 
exploration holes vertically, so no down-hole surveys had been completed. As the regional dip of the 
stratigraphy was approximately 1°/ km, all intersections were therefore assumed to be of true 
thickness.  
 
Sample preparation, assaying were undertaken in the in-house laboratory located in the Pine point mill 
building. Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco)  used an x-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique in which capsules 
of pulverized sample were irradiated and the resultant fluorescent radiation was measured. This was a 

commonly used method during the period between 1960 and 1980. Samples out of normal range were 
re-assayed using different calibrations. Results were reported as % Zn, % Pb and % Fe. 

10.1.3 Westmin Resources 

Westmin did not drill any exploration holes on N-204. 
 

10.1.4 Sampling Methodology & QA/QC 

The logging and sampling methods described below were applied to all the exploration that was carried 

out on all the deposits that Tamerlane worked on in the district. The logging and sampling procedures 

were setup by Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco). Sampling intervals were based on 1.524m (5 ft.) lengths. 

These varied depending on lithology, natural breaks or style of mineralization. Generally the project 

geologist determined the sample lengths. These were at times problematic as recovery varied 

depending on the core consisting of solid intervals. In an effort to compensate for lost core, intervals 

consisting of vugs and dissolved sections, Tamerlane assumed that an interval with less than 100% core 

recovery represented a complete run. A ratio was calculated, which was based on the actual amount of 

recovered core, that reflected what an actual length of core represented vs the total core run.  

 

A technician then split the core and placed one half in the core box and the other into a numbered bag 

and tag. A duplicate tag was stapled to the core box marking the sampled interval. Filled sample bags 

and transmittal forms, were then placed into 5 gallon buckets and labeled. These were then sealed and 

labeled for shipping to ALS Chemex in North Vancouver via Buffalo Air Express. 

 

All samples were prepared and assayed at the lab. Samples were weighed, oven dried, then crushed to 

70% <2mm, then split and pulverized to 85% < 75 um.  All the samples were assayed for zinc, lead, and 

iron by Chemex method AA-62. This involved a four acid digestion and atomic-absorption analysis. All 

assays above 30% were re-run using titration (methods ZN-VOL50, PB-VOL50 and FE-VOL %). All were 

reported to the nearest 0.01 % Zn, Pb or Fe. 

10.1.5 QA/QC Check Samples  

Sample checks are regularly carried out as a matter of practice for all drilling projects. Number of 

intervals resampled is determined before-hand and is carried out as the drilling progresses. Of the 450 

samples that were originally assayed, 55 pulp samples were re-assayed comprising approximately 12% 



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 
 

Page 78 of 228 
 

of the assayed samples. The check samples were split between the Upper and Main Zones in the 

proportion of 30 % and 70 %. These check sample pulps were shipped by Express courier to ACME Labs 

in Vancouver from Tamerlane's secure office location in Hay River, NWT. Assays were run for zinc, lead 

and iron using the ACME 7TD method, which involved a four acid digestion and ICP-ES finish for which 

the detection limits for Zn, Pb and Fe are 0.01 %, 0.02 % and 0.01 % respectfully. 

 

ACME, as a major assay lab, is ISO 9000:2000 and ISO 17025 certified in its North American facilities. 

Routine internal QA/QC check analysis on blacks, duplicates and standard reference materials (SRM) are 

carried out. Verification of the check samples revealed no discrepancies for the internal blanks and 

duplicate pulps. Analysis of SRM samples, were all within acceptable ranges for the values for Zn, Pb and 

Fe. 

 

Figures 10-3 and 10-4 compare the percent variances between the original analyses from Tamerlane's 

2010 drilling by Chemex versus the analysis of duplicate check samples conducted by ACME Labs. For 

both the Upper and Main Mineralized Zones, the paired samples demonstrate a precision well within 

the envelope of +/- 10% for Zn, Pb and Fe.  

 

10.1.6 Data Verification 

Within the Upper Zone, variances ranged between -2.0 %, -2.4% and +5.2%, respectfully. These excluded 

a single high value (#48) suggesting incomplete sample digestion during the analysis of the check 

samples (Figure 10-3).  

 

For the Main Zone, the range of variance was between -1.4%, -2.4% and +3.7%, respectfully. These 

excluded an anomalous value (#24) also suggesting incomplete sample digestion during the analysis of 

the check samples (Figure 10-4).  Excluded also was the anomalous value (#45) for lead, indicating an 

analytical issue in sample preparation.

10.1.7 QP's Opinion 

For the N-204 deposit, the logging, splitting, logistics, as well as safety of the core, were carried out in a 
manner utilized as a standard practice within the industry, following the regulations that were in-force 
at that time. Processing of these by the selected laboratory and their internal QA/QC procedures and 
the requirement for these laboratories to work to specific international standards, have all been met.  
 
Check analysis confirming the assay results for the 2010 drilling program, are within acceptable limits of 
analytical precision. Correlation coefficients (R

2
) for zinc, lead, and iron are all high at 0.99, 0.94 and 

0.99, respectfully.  As a result, this information can be utilized for purposes of resource modeling.  
 
It is recommended that Darnley Bay maintain continuous and systematic QA/QC procedures for all 
future drilling programs on all the deposits. 
 

10.2 R-190 Deposit 
The R 190 deposit (Figure 10-5) is located on the western edge of the claims and is identified on the map 

in bold letters above the outlined yellow claim block.

10.2.1 Tamerlane Drilling 

Between the period 2005 and 2008 Tamerlane conducted confirmatory and infill drilling on the PPP 

deposits to confirm historic grades and tonnages and to provide samples for metallurgical studies. Of

the 5,451m drilled, 1,535m were on the R-190 deposit. Mineralization was assayed in 16 of the 18 

completed holes. The drilling campaign confirmed historic lead and zinc mineralizaiton grade and lens 

thickness for the R-190 deposit. 

The holes were drilled to fulfill three objectives: 

 1. Confirm historic grade and tonnage. 
2. Provide metallurgical samples to determine the applicability of Dense Media Separation 
(DMS) process. 
3. To prove the recoverability of core with good drilling practice. 
 

The confirmation drilling included both vertical and inclined core holes. Downhole surveys were 

performed in most using a Reflex EZ-Shot Drill Hole survey device. Measurements of down-hole 

inclination were made every 60.9m (200 ft) downhole and at the end of the drill hole. Measurements 

varied +/- 2° from the original design and inclination at the start of the hole. 

 

Significant mineralization was assayed in 28 of the 30 completed holes, and grades that were estimated 

visually were believed to be comparable to grades in assayed core. Hole R-190 TV14 was drilled as a 

condemnation hole on the proposed shaft location outside of the mineralization and was not assayed. 

Total metrage drilled was 5162m (16,936 feet). 

 

Three drilling contractors were utilized onsite. These were: 

1.  Discovery Diamond drilling of Morinville, Alberta 

2.  Titan Drilling of Yellowknife, NWT 

3.  ProCore Drilling, of Hay River, NWT 

 

10.2.2 Tamerlane's Core Logging Procedures 

At first, the logging procedures were found to be deficient in recording of core recoveries and 

geotechnical data. But the methods were corrected and and consisted of geotechnical and recovery data 

collection for every 3m interval, detailed lithologic, facies and alteration logging of the core, density 

measurements on selected lithologies and mineralized intervals or suspected changes in geology. 

Sample intervals were usually 1.5m, however these varied depending on natural breaks structure or 

mineralization. All core was photographed prior to being split for sampling. 

Rock Quality Designation (RQD) techniques were completed following standard practises. These were 

recorded on the logging forms and then transferred to Excel spreadsheets which then calculated the 

percent recovery and the RQD factor for the selected core intervals. Average core recovery was about 

85%. Due to the breciated nature of the mineralized rocks, core recovery varied between 30 to 90%. 

Recovery depended on the degree of alteration present and the type of lithologies intersected.

It is the opinion of this QP that Tamerlane had greatly improved their logging and sampling methods 

from their initial drilling program between 2005 and 2008 and reflect a high degree of technical 

competancy and completeness.

10.2.3 Tamerlane R-190 Samples 

 

Split core was shipped to ALS Chemex located in North Vancouver, B.C. There all samples were prepared 

and assayed. Samples were weighed, oven dried, then crushed to 70% <2mm, then split and pulverized 

to 85% < 75 um.  All the samples were assayed for zinc, lead, and iron by Chemex method AA-62. This 

involved a four acid digestion and atomic-absorption analysis. All assays above 30% were re-run using 

titration (methods ZN-VOL50, PB-VOL50 and FE-VOL %). All were reported to the nearest 0.01 % Zn, Pb 

or Fe. 

The ALS-Chemex lab has an ISO 90001-2000 and ISO 17025 certification of North American facilities. 

Routine internal QA/QC testing is carried out which meets international standards. 

Data verification between available databases and hardcopies (report tables) was carried out as a check 

on accuracy of transferred information. As no discrpancies were noted, it is the opinion of this QP that 

this was done with high accuracy and completeness.  

10.2.4 Westmin R-190 Exploration 

The R-190 deposit was discovered by Westmin who drilled 48 vertical core holes. Listing is shown above 

in Table 10-6. 

10.2.4.1 Westmin Drilling 

All the exploration holes drilled by Westmin were confined to the area west of Buffalo River, area not 

previously controlled by Cominco. Exploration drilling was carried out as a follow-up to airborne 

electromagnetic EM/IP surveys. A total of 15,550m (51,000 ft.) of drilling was completed in 92 holes. 

Nine new, blind lead and zinc deposits were defined. But none of these were put into production. 

Westmin drilled a total of 45,942m (150,728 ft.) on five of the six newly discovered deposits. 

Core recovery ran at about 50% due to the brecciated and strongly altered nature of the country and 

mineralized rock. This core is presently stored at the former Cominco mill site. 

10.2.4.2 Core Sampling, QA/QC Procedures, Data Verification 

As Westmin was an exploration company that invested heavily into the exploration of the Pine Point 

deposits that consisted of major drilling expenditures, it would have needed to follow standard industry 

practices in its logging, sampling, and QA/QC procedures. It could be expected that in order to have had 

sufficient funds to cover its exploration costs, it would have been required to follow established 

methods and protocols.

10.3.1 Tamerlane Drilling 

This is a blanket statement that covers all the Cluster Pits (CP) described below. These procedures were 

followed through all the drilling carried out by Tamerlane. 

Between the period 2005 and 2008 Tamerlane conducted confirmatory and infill drilling on the PPP 

deposits to confirm historic grades and tonnages and to provide samples for metallurgical studies. The 

30 completed holes totaled 5,162m drilled.  

The holes were drilled to fulfill three objectives: 

1. Confirm historic grade and tonnage 

2. Provide metallurgical samples to determine the applicability of Dense Media Separation 

(DMS) process 

3. To prove the recoverability of core with good drilling practice. 

The confirmation drilling included both vertical and inclined core holes. Downhole surveys were 
performed in most, using a Reflex EZ-Shot Drill Hole survey device. Measurements of down-hole

inclination were made every 60.9m (200 ft) down-hole and at the end of the drill hole. Measurements 

varied +/- 2° from the original design and inclination at the start of the hole. 
 

Three drilling contractors were utilized onsite. These were: 
1. Discovery Diamond Drilling of Morinville, Alberta 

2. Titan Drilling of Yellowknife, NWT 

3. ProCore Drilling, of Hay River, NWT 

 

Tamerlane Ventures Inc. conducted confirmation drilling between 2007 and 2008 on eight deposits 

including M-67 and L-65.   Three inclined drill-holes were drilled on M-67 in a fan pattern, and were 

designed to intersect and confirm significant mineralization in three historical drill-holes drilled by Pine 

Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco). Six drill-holes were drilled on L-65, three of which were inclined drill-holes 

drilled to confirm prior mineralization drilled by Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco). The three other drill-

holes on M-67 were drilled as exploration holes to determine if mineralization was continuous between 

M-67 and L-65. 

A total of 653 m and 354 m were drilled on L-65 and M-67 respectively. The results of the drilling 

suggest that both deposits are contiguous and represent continuous mineralization along a tabular style 

deposit. No confirmation drilling was done on the K-68 deposit. 

Table 10-7 lists significant intersections drilled by Tamerlane between 2007 and 2008.

10.3.1 Tamerlane's Core Logging Procedures 

At first, the logging procedures were found to be deficient in recording of core recoveries and 

geotechnical data. But the methods were corrected and consisted of geotechnical and recovery data for 

every 3m interval, detailed lithologic, facies and alteration logging of the core, density measurements on 

selected lithologies and mineralized intervals or suspected changes in geology. 

Sample intervals were usually 1.5m, however these varied depending on natural breaks structure or 

mineralization. All core was photographed prior to being split for sampling. 

Rock Quality Designation (RQD) techniques were completed following standard practises. These were 

recorded on the logging forms and then transferred to Excel spreadsheets which calculated the percent 

recovery and the RQD factor for the selected core intervals. Due to the breciated nature of the 

mineralized rocks, average core recovery was about 85% however this varied between 30 to 90%, 

depending on the degree of alteration present and the type of lithologies intersected. 

It is the opinion of this QP that great improvements were made by Tamerlane in their logging and 

sampling procedures between 2005 and 2008 and reflect a high degree of technical competancy and 

completeness.  

10.3.2 Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) 

All drilling, assaying and sampling procedures whould have been carried out on an equal basis 

throughout the entire period that Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) carried out exploration in this area. 

Please refer to the drill hole tables and previous descriptions for greater detail.

10.3.3 Geology of Cluster Pits 

The K-68, M-67, and L-65 deposits lie on the mid portion of the main trend, and on the east side of 

Buffalo River catchment, north of Highway No. 5. The land is low-lying and poorly-drained, with a gentle 

north-westerly slope toward the southern shore of Great Slave Lake. Elevations in the region range from 

approximately 212 m in the northwest to 224 m in the southeast. Swamp, muskeg, and low gravel ridges 

are the main topographic features of the area.  Figures 10-11 through 10-13 depict plan views of the 

general area for the Cluster Pits and Figure 10-14 is an enlarged section of the map showing the location 

of the CP's in greater detail. 

Surface outcrops are rare in the region. It was determined from the 2007 - 2008 drilling that overburden 

consists of clayey glacial till with occasional gravel beds and areas of varved clays and cemented fine 

sands, which vary in thickness from 8 m to 20 m, generally becoming finer with depth.  The glacial till 

forms an effective confining layer and has a shallow water table established within it (Stevenson 1983). 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 117 of 228 
 

This material is often overlain by an organic, peaty layer of muskeg up to 3 m thick. Bedrock in the 

vicinity of the project area is similar to the R-190 deposit and consists of a sequence of gently folded, 

west-dipping, stratified rocks, associated with a Devonian reef complex 

10.3.3.1 Deposit Type 

The project area belongs to the class of carbonate hosted lead-zinc sulphide deposits known as 

Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) deposits, and is probably the most famous and best known Canadian 

example of this type of deposit. Nanisivik and Polaris are other Canadian examples of the same 

geological class. MVT deposits are among the most important sources of lead and zinc in the world, 

exhibiting moderate to high grades, simple metallurgy, and easy processing and beneficiation 

characteristics. They occur in carbonate (limestone and dolomite) host rocks and are typically associated 

with the ingress of mineralizing brines into structurally prepared cavities associated with dissolution of 

the carbonate rocks by karst processes. In the case of Pine Point this dissolution and mineralization 

process occurred on an extensive scale and was controlled by the distribution of a major carbonate 

barrier reef complex of Devonian age. 

10.3.3.2 Mineralization 

Epigenetic sulphide mineralization occurs as open-space cavity fills and local replacement of internal 

sediments in carbonate strata.  The main ore mineralization stage at the Pine Point property 

encompasses a complex overlap and repetition of diagenetic phases or processes. These include 

deposition of sulphides, hydrothermal dissolution, fracturing and collapse of host rocks, internal clastic 

sedimentation, saddle dolomite cementation, and thermal alteration of host rock and associated 

bitumen (P. Hannigan, 2006.). Ore mineralization consists of galena and sphalerite.  Metal grades vary 

from sub economic levels on all fringes of the tabular body to as high as 19.86% combined lead and zinc. 

Lead and zinc occur as fine crystals on the rims of vugs or within calcite +\- dolomite in thin veinlets on 

the margins of a deposit. They increase in abundance, filling vugs, larger veins, and occur in zones of 

massive mineralization, with skeletal to massive galena and coliform sphalerite common. 

Sulphur and bitumen commonly occur in vugs, veins, and pore spaces in and around the lead-zinc 

mineralization.  Marcasite +\- pyrite occur as disseminations within the massive ore sequence or as 

massive horizons near the base of the lead-zinc mineralization and continuing below the lead-zinc 

mineralization. Gypsum needles and their casts are common in association with the mineralized 

horizons. 

Geology of the K-68 & M-67 DepositsThe K-68 and M-67 deposits lie within the Main trend of the 

Pine Point mineralized trends (Figures 10-15 and 10-16).   Overburden thicknesses encountered in the 

2007 and 2008 drill programs ranged from 8 to 20 metres. No outcrop exposures were seen in the area 

of the deposits during these drill campaigns. The ore bodies are a tabular type occurring within a karst, 

which terminates just above the E-facies (sandy dolomite) in the Pine Point Formation. Figure 10-15 

provides a visual reference to the individual mineralized trends. Figures 10-16 through 10-18 depict 

plans and longitudinal sections through the deposits.

10.4 Sampling Method and Approach 
 

As a requirement for legal declaration, it must be noted that neither Darnley Bay Resources Ltd, nor 

Tamerlane Ventures Inc., are in anyway connected to ALS CHEMEX or ACME. Both resources companies 

are independent of either laboratory. 

 

Tamerlane's core logging and sampling procedures were conducted by drilling contractors who were 

supervised by Tamerlane Geologists (2010 drilling program). The procedural and logging protocols 

followed closely those of Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) except that Tamerlane used a somewhat 

simplified version of Pine Point Mines Ltd.'s (Cominco) complex lithological coding system, due to the 

small number of Tamerlane holes and the restricted geographic/geologic range of Tamerlane's drilling 

program. 

 

The drill geologist determined sample intervals, which were recorded on the drill logs and marked on 

the core boxes.  Sample intervals were determined visually and measured to the nearest 0.03m (0.1 ft.).  

Nearly all the sampled intervals contain +2% Zn+Pb. A technician split the core and placed half back in 

the core box, the other half being placed in a numbered bag with a sample tag. A duplicate numbered 

tag was stapled in the core box to mark the sample interval. Sample bags and a transmittal form were 

placed in a shipping box and labeled. The box was then taped shut and labeled with the lab address and 

Tamerlane's return address, plus a bar code for rapid tracking. The boxes were shipped to ALS Chemex 

in North Vancouver for analysis via ground or air transport. 

 

Later, Tamerlane used the remaining half of mineralized core for metallurgical tests; thus no strong 

mineralization remains to be seen in the core.  Tamerlane also submitted 6 drill core samples to Terra 

Testing to be tested for unconfined compressive strength and stress/strain measurements.  The 

Tamerlane drilling was professionally executed, and should accurately reflect the nature of the 

mineralization at the drilled sites, such that the samples can be used for mineral resource estimation 

purposes. 

10.4.1 Density Measurements 

The term "bulk density" is used here in preference to "density" or "specific gravity" since the 

measurement of importance is the overall density of a mass of more or less porous mixture of mineral 

grains, rather than the density of any particular solid mineral grain. Both "bulk density" and "specific 

gravity" are measured in relation to the weight of an equivalent volume of water; i.e.  Tonnes /m
3
 (equal 

to gm /cm
3
). Because assays of mineralized material are determined in the laboratory on oven-dried 

samples, the result used in Resource calculations must also be in dry tonnes.  Most of the historical 

tonnage estimates in the Pine Point district have used calculated rather than measured bulk densities of 

mineralized rock. 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 154 of 228 
 

10.4.2 Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) Practice 

Neither Pine Point Mines Ltd.'s (Cominco) historical tonnage estimations nor those of Giroux (1982) 

utilized original measured rock bulk densities.  Pine Point Mines Ltd.'s (Cominco) bulk densities during 

the operational period were calculated from the density of dolomite, adjusted by the amount of 

sphalerite, galena, and marcasite/pyrite as determined by metal assays.  A porosity of 5% was assumed. 

Reserve-to-mined reconciliations were sufficiently satisfactory that the method was not changed. 

10.4.3 Westmin Practice 

According to Westmin (1983 b) a Kilborn Engineering study in 1979 (Kilborn, 1979) used a tonnage 

factor of 9.0 cubic feet per short ton (SG = 3.55) for Westmin deposits, while Wright Engineers in 1979 

calculated bulk densities for each drill-hole composite, based on metal assays, and an assumed porosity 

of 5%.  Various reports by Giroux (1982 a, 1982 b, 1982 c) used a calculated bulk density which included 

a porosity estimate of 5%.  An internal Westmin study in 1982-83 assumed 9.3 cubic feet per short ton 

(SG = 3.44).  None of the Westmin resources were used by Tamerlane in their resource estimates. 

10.4.4 Tamerlane Practice 

Direct density measurements of core samples during Tamerlane's drill programs were taken during the 

time of the  reserve estimation and found to be isolated and variable, therefore, a calculated density 

was estimated based on knowledge of the chemistry of samples and a 5% porosity utilized, confirmed 

and reconciled over 25 years of mining by Pine Point Mines Ltd. 

The variable sulphide content exerts a dramatic variability to density of mineralized zones. Principal 

sulphides are pyrite, marcasite, sphalerite and galena. The distribution of the sulphides, by nature, was 

precipitated through the karst hosted deposits by open space filling. The weight abundances of these 

sulphides can be calculated from assays from Fe, Zn and Pb providing simplifying assumptions are made. 

These assumptions are as follows:  

 Ore consists of dolomite (dl), pyrite (py), sphalerite (sph) and galena (gn) with an 
assumed porosity of 5 percent.  

 Weight percentages of pure minerals (FeS2, ZnS,  PbS and CaMg(CO3)2) are determined 
as follows:  

o Wt. % py =  %Fe x 2.147  

o Wt. % sph =  %Zn x 1.490  

o Wt.% gn = %Pb x 1.155 

o Wt.% dl = 100-Porosity-Wt% py –Wt% sph – Wt% gn 

o Ideal densities of mineral components are: dolomite -2.85, pyrite - 5.02, 
sphalerite - 3.90 and galena - 7.50.  



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 155 of 228 
 

o Weight percent minerals are related to volume percent by the following 
relation:  

o Vol.% mineral = Wt% Mineral x Ore density/ Mineral density 

o Based on the above assumptions, the calculation used to determine the bulk 
density using metal grades for each deposit is as follows:  

𝐏 =
𝟏 − 𝐎

𝐓𝐨 − {[(
𝐓𝐨 − 𝐓𝐟𝐩𝐛

𝐙𝐠𝐧
) × 𝐀𝐩𝐛] + [(

𝐓𝐨 − 𝐓𝐟𝐳𝐧
𝐙𝐬𝐩𝐡

) × 𝐀𝐳𝐧] + [(
𝐓𝐨 − 𝐓𝐟𝐟𝐞

𝐙𝐩𝐲
) × 𝐀𝐟𝐞]}

 

Where: 

 P  = Bulk Density 

 O  = Porosity (Equations) 

 To  =  Host Rock Tonnage Factor 

 A(pb, zn, fe) = Assays 

 Tf(pb, zn, fe) = Tonnage Factor 

 Z(gn, sph, py) = Wt. Conc. of mineral in its pure mineral species  

The following density formula was used:  

𝐏 =
𝟏 − 𝟎. 𝟎𝟓

𝟎. 𝟑𝟓𝟎𝟗 − {[𝟎. 𝟎𝟎𝟐𝟓 × 𝐀𝐩𝐛] + [𝟎. 𝟎𝟎𝟏𝟓 × 𝐀𝐳𝐧] + [𝟎. 𝟎𝟎𝟑𝟑 × 𝐀𝐟𝐞]}

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security 

11.1 Cominco Samples 
Pine Point Mines Ltd.'s (Cominco) sample preparation and assaying were undertaken in Pine Point Mines 

Ltd assay laboratory located in the Pine Point mill building.  Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) used an x-

ray fluorescence technique in which capsules of pulverized sample were bombarded and the resultant 

fluorescent radiation was measured. This method was commonly used world-wide during the 1960 to 

1980 period. Samples outside a nominal range of contents for Zn, Pb, or Fe were assayed again using 

different machine calibrations. Results were reported as %Zn, %Pb, and %Fe. 

11.2 Westmin Samples 
No information was found relating to sample preparation or assaying methods conducted on Westmin 

samples. However, Westmin was a large and respected mining company in Canada and all Tamerlane 

confirmation drilling did confirm the values reported by Westmin.   

11.3 Tamerlane Samples, 2005 
Split core samples from Tamerlane's drilling were shipped commercially to ALS Chemex in North 

Vancouver, B.C. There the samples were prepared and assayed.  Most samples weighed between 2 kg 

and 5 kg as received. After oven-drying, samples were crushed to 70% < 2mm, then split and pulverized 

to 85% < 75 um. Analyses were performed for Zn, Pb, and Fe by Chemex method AA-62, which involves 

a four-acid digestion and atomic-absorption analysis. Any Zn, Pb, or Fe values above 30% were re-

determined by titration (methods ZN-VOL50, PB-VOL50 and FEVOL %), and reported to the nearest 

0.01% Zn, Pb, or Fe. 

 

ALS Chemex assay results were transmitted to CAM as secured .pdf files.   ALS Chemex are a major assay 

lab, with ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 17025 certification of North American facilities. They routinely 

undertake QA/QC measures that are of world-standard class. 

 

QA/QC procedures were strictly followed by company geologists and specified staff. For the 450 samples 

taken during the 2010 drilling season, 12% of the selected sample intervals were duplicated creating 55 

repeated sample results. Standards and blanks were also inserted into the sample stream. All sampled 

core was stored in a secure facility, where access was controlled to qualified staff members. Company 

geologists controlled the samples right up to the delivery to the ALS Chemex sample reception, thus 

maintaining a strict chain-of-custody order. In the case where samples were shipped by unsupervised 

commercial carriers to ALS Chemex, the samples were shipped in sealed, tamper-proof containers.  

 

The Westmin data and, to a lesser degree, the Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) data, are incompletely 

documented in terms of these phases.   Documentation is complete for the Tamerlane samples.   It is 

known that company employees logged and split core in all three drilling campaigns, and that Pine Point 

Mines Ltd. (Cominco) prepped and assayed samples in-house.   Zinc and lead are the only payable 

minerals in these deposits, and their abundances can be readily estimated visually.  The Tamerlane 

verification drilling was sufficient to validate the historic sampling.

The author is not aware of any drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the 

accuracy or reliability of the results. The intersections of the drill holes with the mineralization in each 

deposit are shown in Chapter 8 on the Plan View and Cross Section figures (green +'s and green vertical 

lines, respectively).  

ALS CHEMEX AND ACME LABORATORIES are two labs that process field rock samples for assaying the 

various values of included minerals. The certificate below states the particulars for the certification of 

ALS CHEMEX. 

Certificates of accreditation are located in Appendix A. 

11.4 QP's Opinion 
The author is not aware of any drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the 

accuracy or reliability of the results.  

The logging, splitting, logistics, as well as safety of the core, were carried out in a manner utilized as a 

standard practice within the industry, following the regulations that were in-force at that time. 

Processing of these by the selected laboratory and their internal QA/QC procedures and the 

requirement for these laboratories to work to specific international standards, have all been met.  

 

Check analysis confirming the assay results for the 2010 drilling program, are within acceptable limits of 

analytical precision. Correlation coefficients (R
2
) for zinc, lead, and iron are all high at 0.99, 0.94 and 

0.99, respectfully. As a result, this information can be utilized for purposes of resource modeling.  

 

It is recommended that Darnley Bay maintain continuous and systematic QA/QC procedures for all 

future drilling programs on all the deposits.

12 Data Verification 

12.1 Cominco Drilling 
All Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) core was logged by geologists, or by geology students who were 

supervised by experienced Pine Point Mines geologists. Logging followed rigorous standard procedures, 

utilizing pre-printed, standardized logging cards to systematically record run-by-run recoveries, 

geochemical and full assays, verbose geological logs, and digital codes for geology, alteration, karst and 

mineralization codes.  Logging protocols were provided to geologists, the last-used protocol being issued 

by Pine Point Mines (1985).  Pine Point Mines Ltd.'s (Cominco) stratigraphic logging scheme was as 

shown on Table 12-1.  
 

Table 12-1.  Selected Cominco Lithologic Unit Codes. 

 
 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 159 of 228 
 

 
The database for Pine Point drilling was compiled in "GEORES" format by the Pine Point Mines Ltd. 

(Cominco) exploration staff (GEORES was Cominco's proprietary geological modeling software).  Drill 

data exists for all holes drilled on the Pine Point Mines property.  In the final years of operations the Pine 

Point Mines data was systematically updated and coded throughout the property according to the latest 

geological nomenclature developed from Pine Point Mines Ltd.'s (Cominco) geological research group at 

Pine Point. This data was subsequently acquired by Tamerlane Ventures Inc. 

 

The geologists marked the core for sampling, which was then undertaken by trained technicians and 

sent to the laboratory for preparation and assay. Sample intervals were determined visually and 

measured to the nearest 0.03m (0.1 foot).  Nearly all the sampled intervals contain +2% Zn+Pb. In the 

initial phases of each deposit, core was split pneumatically and 50% of the core was preserved.  Later in 

the program, the entire mineralized interval was sent for assay, and no core remains of mineralized 

intercepts.  

 

The remaining core including non-mineralized intervals, was preserved in a large core library called the 

"Back 40" west of the (former) Pine Point mill.   It is stacked in forklift-moveable cradles containing 

approximately 609.6m (2,000 feet) of core per cradle. This core was left in an orderly and well-labeled 

condition, but in the 20+ years since drilling ceased, many of the labels have deteriorated or fallen off, 

and many of the wooden cradles no longer can be moved intact. This, plus the fact that the entire 

mineralized core was assayed in most holes, renders the historic core only marginally useful for re-

assaying purposes, but is still excellent for geology purposes. 

 

Cominco's work at Pine Point spanned 56 years (1929-1985), of which 20 years (1964-1984) involved 

intensive mining and exploration. There is sufficient documentation to conclude that the historic Pine 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 160 of 228 
 

Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) drilling on the deposits can be used to generate mineral Resource estimates 

which are compliant with NI 43-101. 

 

12.2 Westmin Drilling 
Westmin, as the operator for a joint venture of Westmin (Boliden) and DuPont, utilized a competent 

geological staff and industry-standard methods. However, few details of their specific procedures are 

known. The available information suggests that core recovery was very high, exceeding 90%. The 

Westmin geological logging scheme varied from that of Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) (described 

above).  

 

The principal lithologic units recorded by Westmin were as shown in Table 12-2. 
 

Table 12-2.  Selected Westmin Lithologic Unit Codes. 

 

Westmin's geologic and drill data are presently housed at the C.S. Lord Geological Institute in 

Yellowknife (Turner, et al., 2002), and are available to the public.  A complete set of the available data 

relating to the Westmin program was obtained by Tamerlane and  Westmin's drilling and sampling were

Summary Technical Report Update 2016

of a quality sufficient to use together with Tamerlane's more recent drill data, for estimation of mineral 

Resources. 

 

12.3 Data Verification Procedures 
The data verification procedure used to verify the data used for the calculation of resources for this 

report was the visual examination of assay sections through the deposits produced from the data using 

the Vulcan geological modeling program.  With respect to the R-190 deposit reserves Chlumsky, 

Armbrust and Meyer (CAM, 2007) reported that they used the following procedure to verify the data. 

• Check for duplicate collars. 
• Check for twin holes. 
• Check for statistically anomalous down-hole surveys. 
• Check for overlapping assays 
• Check for 0 length assays 
• Review of assay statistics by grade class. 
• Review of assay statistics by length class. 
• Checks for holes bottomed in PEM. 
• Check for assay values successively the same. 
• Check for assay spikes. 
• Check for down-hole contamination by decay analysis. 
• Check of total grade thickness by hole. 

Because historic assay certificates were not available, CAM (2007) was unable to verify the database 

against source documents. 

 

The assay procedures and down-hole surveys by Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco)  have been confirmed 

by Tamerlane drilling.  MASKWA Engineering, Hay River, confirmed UTM co-ordinates for CP and 

underground deposit drill holes by field identifiable Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco)  collars.  Further 

survey verification should be conducted for feasibility level reports for the CP'S and N-204. 

 

12.4 QP's Opinion 
The qualified person has reviewed and verified the data referred to in this report. All the data is 

available in both digital and paper format at the storage location in Gardnerville, Nevada. Electronic data 

are easily accessible from the main server. Hard copies of reports and various files are stored in boxes 

presently located in the office basement in neat orderly fashion. 

As Westmin was an exploration company that invested heavily into the exploration of the Pine Point 

deposits that consisted of major drilling expenditures, it would have needed to follow standard industry 

practices in its logging, sampling, and QA/QC procedures. It could be expected that in order to have had 

sufficient funds to cover its exploration costs, it would have been required to follow established 

methods and protocols.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Subsequent to the PAH Review (PAH, 2008) test work in several areas was identified to further improve 

concentration grades and recoveries. Column flotation cells and a flash cell were added to the design. 

Tests were done to simplify the reagent scheme, and to confirm the ball mill bond work index (BWI). All 

the process flow sheets were updated and a mass balance was developed to determine equipment 

sizes. Plant drawings were revised to reflect changes to the process. Quotes were updated in 2012 for all 

major equipment that was incorporated to reflect updated costs associated with the plant. 

Tamerlane planned to produce a pre-concentrate, using Dense Media Separation (DMS), from R-190 at 

the proposed Pine Point Mill.   

 

Tamerlane planned to process pre-concentrate from the CPs and N-204 at the proposed Pine Point Mill.  

The CP run-of-mine (ROM) will be crushed and processed through a centralized 5,500 tonne per day 

DMS facility.  The N-204 ROM will be crushed and processed through a dedicated 7300 tonne per day 

DMS facility.  The pre-concentrates will be trucked to the Pine Point Mill. 

 

Tamerlane planned to process the run-of-mine mineralization by crushing and processing through a 

centralized dense media separation plant in order to discard non-mineralized, low density rock, thereby 

upgrading the material going to the conventional R-190 flotation plant. Dense media separation (called 

DMS, Sink-Float or heavy media separation) has been used extensively to upgrade lead-zinc ROM 

material before grinding and flotation
4
.  Some plants use galena itself as a heavy media while others use 

ferrosilicon.   

 

To confirm the use of DMS, a metallurgical test program was conducted on samples from the N-204 

deposit and the R-190 deposit.  Heavy media test work indicated that standard zinc and lead flotation 

preceded by dense media separation will likely yield excellent recoveries.  The proposed DMS plant at R-

190 will process 2800-3000 tonnes per day and the centralized DMS at the CPs will be designed to run 

5,500 tons per day.  The metal losses in the DMS plant are minimal. 

 

The rejection percentage of waste material is higher for low grade material, because of the greater 

differences in specific gravity.  After rejection from the DMS plant, the float material (waste rock) will be 

utilized as construction material on site to build roads, possibly sold as aggregates, and used as backfill 

by re-introducing back into the mined out panels or pits. 

 

Tamerlane projected the required DMS capacity at the CPs by extrapolating the data received on the R-

190, O-556 and Z-155 (PAH, 2008) test work and the N-204 (MineTech, 2012) test work.

R-190 (from PAH 2008 Section 16.1.1) 

The objective of the initial Metallurgical Test program was to evaluate the effectiveness of Heavy 
Liquid Separation (HLS) to remove barren gangue from the Run-of-Mine (ROM) ore for DSO 
production or pre-concentrate the ROM ore for mill process feed. Heavy liquid separation is a 
laboratory version of dense media separation and is designed to simulate the best result that can 
be achieved by DMS. This test-work was conducted at Mountain State Research and 
Development International (MSRDI).  A full report of the program is included in Appendix D of the 
Tamerlane Pine Point Project Feasibility Study. 

 
N-204 (from MineTech 2012, Section 13) 
 

To confirm the use of DMS, a metallurgical test program was conducted on samples from the N-
204 deposit. Heavy media test work indicated that standard zinc and lead flotation preceded by 
dense media separation will likely yield excellent recoveries. Concentrate grades of 58 percent 
zinc and 60 percent lead are expected. The proposed DMS plant will process 7,300 tonnes per 
day of ore of which about 5,500 tonnes per day will be rejected by the DMS plant leaving about 
1,800 tonnes per day for the grinding and flotation circuits, according to work completed by SGS. 
The metal losses in the DMS plant are minimal. 

 

As reviewed by Mr. Siega, PAH, MineTech and other experts, all deposits in the Pine Point have similar 

geological and metallurgical characteristics. Historically, in the Pine Point area, the mineralization from 

many deposits was processed through the same metallurgical plant with only slight variations to the 

process being required to achieve the required recovery rates. Therefore, there is a high level of 

confidence that the proposed process plant will be able to treat mineralized rock from all deposits.  The 

author of this report agrees. 

The metallurgical characteristics of the N-204 deposit differs from the Central and Southwest sections of 

the trend in that it is fine grained versus the coarse grained nature of the deposits southwest of N-204.  

The DMS test data from N-204 were recalculated to show the nature of coarse grained mineralogy 

versus its fine grained nature as it pertains to recovery in the DMS circuit.  The results of this review 

showed that the DMS required capacity to produce 1800 tons of concentrator feed per day dropped 

from 7200 tonnes to 6100 tonnes for a coarse grain N-204 based on the heavy media recoverability of 

coarse grained versus fine grained material.  The DMS capacity can be forecasted for the CPs, which are 

coarse grained, based upon the grade of the deposits.  Figure 13-1 shows the graph of the R-190 to N-

204 correlation and the projected tonnages for various deposits in the CP zone.

13.1 Summary of PAH Review 
Some of the significant highlights leading to the process flow-sheet developed are noted below. 

Tamerlane planned to treat the ROM mineralized rock by crushing it, processing it through a DMS plant 

(thereby upgrading the material), then recovery of zinc and lead by conventional lead/zinc flotation.  

The development of the current metallurgical process has gone through the following basic steps, 

described in PAH, 2008: 

 Initially, an objective of the metallurgical program for the Pine Point Project was to produce 
a Direct Shipment Ore (DSO) product with a +45 percent combined lead and zinc grade. It 
was envisioned DSO production would use a simple process flow sheet including crushing to 
liberate the sulfides from the non-sulfides followed by screening to remove the crushed 
"Fines".  DMS would then reject coarse liberated non-sulfide gangue material and produce a 
final, marketable DSO product. Acceptable recovery grades were not achieved (PAH, 2008). 

 

 A second phase of testing then evaluated a finer crush and secondary upgrading by gravity 
separation and coarse particle flotation. These process options also failed to improve the 
overall product grade to the desired level. The metallurgical test program then shifted focus 
to the development of a suitable flotation process following DMS (PAH, 2008). 

 

 Flotation became the focus of the continuing metallurgical program. The objective was to 
develop a process flow sheet that assumed a DMS (or HLS for laboratory simulation) pre-
concentration step followed by conventional grinding and selective lead, zinc flotation. The

flotation test program was conducted at SGS Lakefield. The mass balance of the locked-cycle 
test is presented in Table 13-1 (after PAH, 2008).

The DMS process is a key step in the beneficiation of the PEM, as it was shown to be capable of 

removing 30% to 60% of the waste material.  

An earlier paper by Allen and Walker, which was presented at a Los Angeles AIME meeting in October of 

1946, lists nine advantages of heavy media separation: 

1) "Ability to make sharp separations at any predetermined specific gravity ranging from 1.25 to 
3.4 and continuously maintains this preselected specific gravity within plus or minus 0.01. Efficient 
cleaning methods eliminated viscosity problems. 
2) "The specific gravity of the separating medium can be changed at any time, and within a few 
minutes, when necessary to meet changing characteristics of the feed. 
3) "Ability to remove sink, or refuse, continuously. 
4) "Ability to treat full-size range material without pre-sizing. 
5) "Heavy-media plants can be started and shut down without loss of values or operating 
efficiency. 
6) "The medium used for separation is relatively low cost and losses incident to the operation are 
negligible (100 grams to 400 grams per tonne of feed).  
7) "Low operating and maintenance cost. 
8) "Separate units have large capacity and occupy relatively small space. 
9) "Capital costs are low in comparison with installation of competitive processes of equal 
capacity" (Allen and Walker, 1949). 
 

The rejection percentage of waste material is higher for low grade material, because of the greater 

differences in specific gravity. This is evident by the results obtained during HLS tests at SGS in Table 

13-2 below.

Heavy media test work indicated that DMS separation followed by standard lead-zinc flotation will yield 

excellent recoveries. Recoveries of both metals are above 90% and concentrate grades of 62% zinc and 

72% lead were achieved (see Table 13-3). The proposed DMS plant will process between 2,800 and 

3,000  tonnes per day of ROM of which about 1000 tonnes per day will be rejected by the DMS plant 

leaving approximately 1,800 tonnes per day for the grinding and flotation circuits, according to work 

completed by SGS for R-190 (see Section 16.0 of PAH 2008). The metal losses in the DMS plant are 

minimal.  

The reagent scheme at the plant will not use cyanide due to environmental commitments Tamerlane 

has undertaken. An alternative reagent scheme was investigated and cyanide is no longer used as a 

reagent. The depressant designed to alleviate the harmful effect of pre-active clay slimes was P92 and 

SQ6. P92 is composed of ZnSO4 (66%), Na2S2O5 (17%), and Oxalic Acid (17%). SQ6 is composed of 

Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) (39%), Suspendol PKK (Cognis) (39%) and Ethylenediamine Tetra Acetic 

Acid (22%).

SGS Lakefield performed the final test work including the reagent scheme and lock cycle tests to 

determine all the necessary treatment criteria required. The work by SGS is summarized in PAH, 2008. 

As reviewed by PAH and other experts, all deposits in the Pine Point have similar geological and 

metallurgical characteristics. Historically, in the Pine Point area, mineralization from many deposits was 

processed through the same metallurgical plant with only slight variations to the process being required 

to achieve the required recovery rates. There is therefore a high level of confidence that the proposed 

process plant will be able to treat mineralized rock from all deposits.  Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) 

mined and concentrated over 64 million tonnes of ore at Pine Point operating through a single 

concentrator for the 23 years.  The deposits of the CPs are deposits which are primarily situated 

between Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) mined out deposits. 

Tamerlane planned to process the ROM crushed at the mine site and passed through a DMS plant, 

thereby upgrading the material for processing by a conventional flotation plant. All float rejection from 

the DMS (waste rock) will be utilized as construction material on site to build roads, possibly sold as 

aggregates, or used as backfill and reintroduced back into the mining stopes once the stopes are mined.  

The lead and zinc concentrates produced by the final two locked cycle tests were analyzed for trace 

elements and smelter impurities. Based on the test results the concentrates contained no deleterious 

material and match those concentrates previously produced at Pine Point between 1964 and 1987. The 

result of that analysis is shown in Table 13-4.

13.2 Metallurgical Test Work 
Detailed metallurgical design work for the processing plant is found in the previous NI 43-101 Technical 

Report (2008 PAH).  Work done after the 2008 PAH review includes: 

 

1) Improving the response to bitumen activation of slimes in the PEM, to reduced overall loss of lead in 
the slime froth.  

a) During the course of the development test work, in 2008 by SGS, it was discovered that 
cavities within some of the O-556 cores were filled with bituminous oil which had the 
undesired effect of activating the flotation of fine clay slimes. Considerable work was 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 169 of 228 
 

devoted to developing a depressant scheme to alleviate the negative effect to the lead 
circuit recoveries because of the bitumen-activated slimes.  

2) Rougher flotation concentrates grade recovery. 
a) The SGS Lock cycle tests of 2008 showed that over 68% of the lead grade was produced in 

58% of lead recovery in the lead rougher concentrate (see Table 13-5). This work was 
confirmed in the current test work by G&T which showed 64% of the lead grade in 88% of 
lead recovery in the lead rougher concentrate (see Table 13-6) (in both cases the scavengers 
were not included). This proves the initial test results are repeatable. About 90% of the feed 
lead was recovered into the lead rougher concentrate. The associated feed mass recovery to 
the lead concentrate was approximately 19%. 

b) Test work by G&T (G&T Metallurgical Services) which showed 64% of the lead grade in 88% 
of lead recovery in the lead rougher concentrate (see Table 13-6). This confirmed the 
previous work done by SGS. 

3) Investigate grind size related to the work index.  
a) G&T performed a Particle Mineral Analysis (PMA) (by means of A QEMSCAN) on flotation 

feed ground to a sizing of 70µm K80. At this grind sizing, both galena and sphalerite had 
estimated two-dimensional liberations of about 70 and 80%, respectively. The unliberated 
galena and sphalerite was mainly in binary format with pyrite and non-sulphide gangue. This 
grind size will improve the rougher concentration grade.  

b) Tests by G&T showed a BWI value of 7.4 kWh/tonne. The sample tested was considered to 
be soft and this results in the low energy requirements for grinding in a ball mill circuit. A 
BWI of 11 kWh/tonne (SGS 2008) was used for mill sizing and power calculation purposes 
due to the probability of encountering harder feed material or recirculating material in a 
regrind circuit. 

4) Reagent scheme work 
a) Tests done by G&T confirmed the reagent scheme validity originally developed by SGS in 

2008 (the only exception is the use of Lime for pH control in the lead circuit). This current 
reagent scheme as shown in Table 13-7 will be used in the plant. 

b) Work on the reagents scheme to use a single pH modified in both the lead and zinc flotation 
circuits. The pH modifier, Lime, used in the Zinc circuit was tested in the lead circuit. Results 
were positive (G&T Metallurgical Services, 2012). A single pH modifier will therefore be 
required in the process plant which will simplify the process and the lower costs. Table 13-7 
shows the laboratory test reagent scheme.

13.3 Metallurgical Test Work Conclusions  
As discussed above, modifications to the MMS were made after the 2008 Feasibility Study based upon 

results for additional analysis and data collection.  The modifications are summarized below. 

 A pre-float flash flotation cell has been added to the mill process to remove the bitumen 
activation of slimes.  

 A BWI of 11 kWh/tonne was used for mill sizing and power calculation purposes. Test work 
indicated a BWI of 7.4 kWh/t. The excess mill capacity will account for the feed variations and 
regrind requirements.  The feed processed through the mill should be ground down to 70 µm for 
optimal mineral liberation.  

 There are no known processing factors or deleterious elements in the produced concentrate 
that could have a significant effect on the potential economic extraction of lead and zinc from 
the Pine Point area. 

 The mass balance generated from the final two locked cycle tests is presented in Table 13-3.  
Final Locked Cycle Flotation Tests (from PAH 2008). It is possible to process this material based 
on historical Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) production experience.  

 Due to environmental considerations and permitting commitments, cyanide will not be used in 
the processing plant. 

 On the basis of current test data it appears that production of high grade lead and zinc 
concentrates should be feasible from this feed material. 

 

The associated design criteria established in the lab is as per Table 13-8.

14 Mineral Resource Estimates 
The 2014 TAM Technical Report operating plan was based upon mining 1 underground and 9 open pit 

deposits.  Based upon the 2014 TAM Technical Report these deposits were classified as Measured, 

Indicated and Inferred Resources.  These deposits were tabulated according to the mining method by 

which they were expected to be extracted and given the appropriate dilution.    Currently those 

deposits mentioned in these lists are considered as historical resources, and are not in accordance 

with the mineral resources or mineral reserves classifications contained in the CIM Definition 

Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, as required by National Instrument 43-101 

("NI 43-101"). Accordingly, Darnley Bay is not treating these historical estimates as current mineral 

resources or mineral reserves as defined in NI 43-101 and such historical estimates should not be 

relied upon. A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to date to classify the historical 

estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.  Information relating to 2014 TAM 

Technical Report Resources can be found in Section 6 History.

16 Mining Methods  

16.1 General Plan 
The 2014 TAM Technical Report operating plan was based upon mining 1 underground and 9 open pit 

deposits.  These deposits were tabulated according to the mining method by which they were expected 

to be extracted and given the appropriate dilution.  Darnley Bay has not had the opportunity to 

confirm the assumptions or design of the mine plan.  Darnley Bay believes that qualified professional 

work has been completed in the 2014 TAM technical report and therefore has included the 2014 TAM 

Mining Methods section on an informational basis only.  Darnley Bay will be proceeding to completion 

of a new mine plan in the near future. 

16.2 Cluster Pits 
The Cluster Pits (CP) are so noted due to their proximity to one another in the central portion of the 

Main Trend and due to the ability to utilize a single DMS plant for pre-concentration.  The proposed 

central crushing and pre-concentrating facility is located with five deposits situated northeast of the 

facility and four deposits southwest of the facility.  The haulage distance is reasonable for Caterpillar 777 

(100 ton) trucks or similar with the exception of W-85.  The haulage from W-85 can be reconciled by 

placing a mobile crusher at the pit and moving the material to the centralized DMS using over the road 

type trucks.  Engineering studies will be completed to determine the best option for this haul in the next 

level of study, (feasibility). The distances from the deposits to the centralized DMS are in Table 16-1.

16.3 Proposed Mining Method 
An isometric view of the planned mine design for the R-190 deposit is shown in Figure 16-6. The decline 

will be collared and driven through 50 metres of unconsolidated ground before encountering competent 

rock. Tamerlane will utilize long hole bulk mining with sequential backfilling (paste), a small quantity less 

than 10% will utilize cut and fill methods. Conventional decline trackless development techniques will be 

used for the rest of the ramp and for developing the workings to expose the stopes to be mined.  The 

ore suits a single pass solution, with drilling from the top level, 140mL, and mucking from draw-points 

on the 170metre level. Stopes are planned to be 10m x 25m long x 30m high with ground support 

applied to support the strike and support the crown beam created while mining expands from center to 

pillars. Ventilation will be pushed down a raise (laddered escape-way), to the lowest workings and 

exhausted to surface via the ramp.  Auxiliary fans and ducting will purge workings off the main vent 

routes. The quantity of air moved will match or be more than the regulations for diesel operated 

equipment (min 0.06 m³ per sec per kW diesel power, ≥300k cfm).  Major services will be provided on 

surface (shops, fuel, consumables).

Tamerlane will mine the R-190 underground Pine Point deposit by installing a ±3 metre wide freeze wall 

The freeze wall will extend from surface down to a layer of rock with low permeability below the 

deposits isolating the deposit from surrounding groundwater in the existing active aquifer. Dewatering 

will then be limited to the groundwater within the ring and a relatively small amount of water entering 

the ring as basal inflow. Once the water level within the freeze ring is pumped lower than the mining 

levels, internal sumps and pumps will maintain control of accumulation of water from the basal inflow 

and mining activities.   Artificial ground freezing has proven to be an effective method of stabilizing wet, 

unconsolidated ground and controlling groundwater inflows. The original technology was developed by 

F.H. Poetsch in 1883 and has been used in mining and underground construction for over 100 years. 

Freezing was utilized at the historic Pine Point Mine in 1985 to develop a ventilation shaft. The 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 180 of 228 
 

successful earlier application of freezing in the Pine Point rock strata provides confidence that a similar 

technique can be successfully employed at the PPP's R-190 site. Freezing technology is extensively used 

in the Canadian mining industry, specifically in the Potash and Uranium mines in the province of 

Saskatchewan.   

 

A typical ground freezing system consists of a series of freeze pipes that are installed around the 

perimeter of the proposed excavation and extend into the subsurface strata below the aquifer. Within 

each of the freeze pipes a smaller diameter feed pipe is installed that allows the downward circulation 

of the cooling medium which then flows back to the surface through the annulus.   A cylindrical column 

of ground freezes around each pipe as the brine circulates through the closed-loop pipe system. The 

frozen ground increases in diameter, with time, and overlaps the adjacent freezing column and forms a 

watertight and impermeable barrier. 

 

16.4 Geotechnical 
AMC Mining Consultants (Canada) Ltd has conducted a geotechnical review titled "Pine Point 

Geotechnical Review Phase 2 R-190 Deposit".   The design for the longhole open stoping is to have 

stopes 10m x 25m long x 30m high.  AMC determined with the use of the Matthews-Potvin Stability 

Graph Method that stopes of this size in this rock type should be supported using cable bolts in order to 

prevent back overbreak and maintain the crown pillar beam above the ore zone on 140mL. 

 

16.5 Required Mining Fleet and Machinery 
Table 16-3 shows the major underground equipment required for initial mining. This equipment fleet 

has been sized based on truck haulage studies, as well as additional equipment required for 

development, cable bolting, and shotcreting, drilling, loading and blasting.   All equipment will access the 

underground workings at each site via a portal/decline. Minor servicing and minor maintenance repairs 

will be completed underground.  Major repairs will be completed at the main surface maintenance shop 

at the MMS, Figure 16-6.

Figure 16-7.  Main Mine Site Schematic. 

 
 

16.5.1 Open Pit Mining 

Mining would be carried out using conventional open pit benching with open pit equipment. Drilling will 

be performed by conventional blast hole production drills. Blasting operations will use an explosive 

(ANFO, ammonium nitrate and fuel oil) and a down-hole delay initiation system. Plastic liners would be 

used in wet holes. A hydraulic shovel and an excavator would be used to load rigid haulage trucks for 

reserve and waste haulage.  All equipment specified is capable of operation in -40
o 

Centigrade 

temperatures. 

 

Haulage trucks would exit the pit onto common haul roads on the property to move the waste to open 

pits left from previous mining or to the appropriate piles situated close to the pit to minimize handling.  

Reserves will be hauled to stockpiles in close proximity to the DMS plant and sorted by grade.  Front end 

loaders (FELs) and trucks would be used to move light waste and DMS rejects to separate stockpiles for 

general mine use (road repairs and backfill) and for sale to market as aggregate.  Surplus DMS rejects 

will be placed in current open pits or used to backfill the open pits Tamerlane has mined.  The area 

around the DMS would be kept clear of excessive waste pile build up. 

 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 183 of 228 
 

The pre-concentrated rock fraction from the DMS would be trucked to the proposed mill at R-190. The 

tailings generated from the concentrate, at the R-190 site, would be backhauled to an existing open pit 

along the return haulage way and used to backfill those pits. 

 

Production would be scheduled from the pits based upon a number of factors.  The grade of the deposit 

determines the tonnes per day of DMS feed required to yield 1800 tonnes per day of concentrator feed.  

Blending of DMS feed at times may be an important factor to assure that the 1800 tonnes per day of 

concentrator feed is attained.  If water becomes a concern in some pits, mining rates will be escalated to 

reduce pumping costs and excess run-of-mine will be stockpiled.  To secure a continuous feed to the 

DMS, multiple pits may be developed and producing at any given time.  This will ensure that a fairly 

constant feed grade can be maintained providing the 1800 tonnes per day to the proposed mill. 

 

There will be two types of waste to be removed for the pit development and three types of waste used 

to refill mined out open pits (Table 16-2, Table 16-3). 

 
Table 16-3.  Waste to be removed prior to production feed removal. 

Overburden Loose surface material that will be stored to top cover reclaimed areas as a growth 
media 

Waste Limestone Limestone which overlays the PEM zone, thickness varies by deposit 

 
 
Table 16-4.  Waste products after completion of mining and concentrating. 

Waste Limestone Will be placed in mined open pits where possible and stockpiled when not 

DMS Float Will be used as construction material, sold to market or used as pit backfill 

Mill Tails Will be backhauled from the R-190 concentrator and placed in mined open pits 

 
Overburden – Loose dirt, clays and cobble which can be moved by breaking with a dozer and using a FEL 

and trucks for moving the materials to a stockpile.  This material will be strategically placed for future 

use in the reclamation cycle and will be used as a growth media. 

 

Waste Limestone-Below the overburden is a layer of limestone which has no economic value.  This 

material must be mined and hauled out of the pit to expose the mineralized zone.  Drilling and blasting 

will be required on all waste rock.  Waste rock could be drilled using a rotary blast drill bit diameter of 

203-254mm. The bench height would depend on the thickness of the waste rock horizon but averaging 

10m. Burden and spacing would be in the neighborhood of 6.5-7.0m and 8-9m.  The waste limestone is 

seen as having value in terms of mitigating acid generation, and will be used to backfill mined open pits 

where possible and stockpiled when not possible.  

 

DMS Float-Un-mineralized dolomite has a lower specific gravity than dolomite containing zinc and lead.  

In the DMS circuit crushed run of mine material is put through cyclones containing a dense media 

(ferrosilicon) as the fluid.  The dense media floats the lighter dolomite out the top of the cyclone while 

allowing the mineralized material with a higher specific gravity to sink out of the bottom of the cyclone.  



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 184 of 228 
 

The float rock can then be used as construction material on-site for pads or road surfacing material.  

Float rock can also be marketed to the towns near Pine Point for like purposes.  If float production 

exceeds use requirements the balance will be used to further reclamation.  An economic study should 

be undertaken to determine if additional markets exist for the float material in the NWT and northern 

Alberta. 

 

Mill Tails-Filtered tails will be trucked to reclamation sites to be used as fill for open pits.  The trucks 

that bring DMS pre-concentrate to the mill will haul tails to the reclamation areas on their back haul.  

This is an efficient system as these trucks would normally return to the centralized DMS empty. 

 

16.5.2 Explosives, Drilling and Blasting 

Drilling and blasting will be required on all DMS feed and waste rock. The waste and the mineralized 

sections will be blasted as separate operations to provide better grade control and limit dilution. 

 

Waste rock could be drilled using a rotary blast drill bit diameter of 203-254mm. The bench height 

would depend on the thickness of the waste rock horizon, averaging 10m. Burden and spacing would be 

in the neighborhood of 6.5-7.0m and 8-9m. 

 

In the PEM, one DTH drill will be used to drill smaller 102-152mm diameter blast holes on a smaller 

3.5-4.0m pattern. The bench height would again depend on the thickness of the targeted mineralized 

zone and the required fragmentation results. 

 

This drill will also be used both for perimeter blasting and secondary blasting. 

 

An explosives supplier will deliver the mine explosives needed for production blast holes. ANFO will be 

used where possible. To avoid losing bulk explosives in cracks or ground openings, and because of the 

wet ground conditions, it is anticipated that plastic liners will be required in some holes prior to loading. 

 

Explosive manufacturers will be consulted on the design of the powder factors.  After mining 

commences, fragmentation will be evaluated and the drill and blast parameters may be further refined 

to optimize results. 

 

16.5.3 Loading and Hauling 

There will be a 65 tonne excavator and a 16m³ hydraulic shovel to strip the waste and move the DMS 

feed.  There will be a 6.8-m³ front-end loader available for short-time assignments; its main duty will be 

between the DMS feed mixing area and the crusher.  A fleet of up to three (3) 90 tonne-capacity trucks 

will haul ROM to the DMS feed mixing area near the crusher-DMS plant and haul other mine materials 

to appropriate locations. The trucks would travel on the pit ramps and surface common mine haulage 

and access roads.

A bulldozer and grader will be utilized to maintain ramp grade and berms, clean pit sills and spread pile 

tops as required. 

 

16.5.4 Mining Fleet and Machinery

16.6 Geological, Hydrological and other Parameters 
Regionally, the stratigraphic sequence hosting the lead zinc deposits dips very gently to the southwest. 

The host dolomite for these deposits is located within or below a groundwater aquifer. Groundwater 

movement occurs through fractures and solution openings. Aquifer conditions range from unconfined, 

water-table conditions (at the eastern-most leases) to confined, flowing artesian conditions (at the 

northwestern and western-most leases).  Generally, the trend of the groundwater flow is northeast 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 186 of 228 
 

toward the Great Slave Lake. This dolomite is recharged by infiltration of rainfall and the melting of 

snow, although less than 25% of the precipitation is believed to recharge the aquifers.
5
  Past mining 

practice was to install wells around the peripheral of the surface deposits and pump down the water 

table to allow mining of the deposits. This practice is still applicable for the shallower deposits which are 

located up to 50m to 60m below surface. For the deeper deposits, the application of freezing technology 

provides the means to develop and mine the deeper deposits in the trend. 

Vogwill (1976)

 reviewed three different methods of dewatering addressing the economics, pluses and 

minuses.  All three methods were used at Pine Point while in production between 1964 and 1987.  

Ultimately, Vogwill believed that Method 3 was preferable although it had not been fully refined at the 

time of his report.  His comments here were: 

"This method has the most potential for cost savings in pit dewatering, but it has practical limitations.  It 

utilizes the concept that the pumping rate for a particular pit should greatly exceed the dewatering rate 

required to dewater the benches in the time required (i.e. according to the mine schedule), plus the 

inflow or recharge into the pit area as the cone of depression develops.  When the dewatering of a 

particular bench has been completed, pumping rates can be reduced to match inflow and, therefore, 

hold the water table elevation.  As dewatering proceeds, higher continuous pumping rates will be needed 

to maintain dewatered ground.  By keeping the cone of depression in the immediate area of the pit to a 

minimum size, the total volume of water pumped is less.  The procedure applies to each bench, with 

more and more pumps being left operating to maintain the inflow from the larger cone of depression for 

the lower benches.  Although capital costs are high, operating costs can be reduced, dependent on power 

demand."
9 

According to Calver and Farnsworth (1969), the average Pumping Costs for open pit mining in the 

deposits around the town site (N-42, 0-42 and J-44) were a total of $0.39 per tonne, capital and 

operating.  The power to operate the pumps was 10% of the total cost per tonne pumping.  This $0.39 

inflated to 2013 costs would equate to $1.60.  The financial model for the Cluster Pits uses a cost in the 

order of $2.00 per tonne for pumping.  

Mineralization is hosted within karst collapse features of the Pine Point Formation. The karst collapse 

features are of key geotechnical significance to mining as the collapsed kart structures are shown by the 

downward deflection of the generally weak Watt formation into the mineralized zone. In the 

underground mines, this lithology is anticipated to develop into a zone of weakness directly above the 

mining horizon as mining progresses. A key component to the overall stope back stability will be to

retain a competent beam of rock above the mining zone (i.e. between the stope backs and the generally 

weak Watt formation).  Additional ground support will likely be required in some areas. 

16.7 Production Rates Scheduled and LOM 
Tamerlane production rates were scheduled based upon the amount of feed required to produce 1800 

tonnes per day of DMS product (Table 16-6).  DMS feed rates will vary between 4800 tonnes per day to 

6000 tonnes per day for the Cluster Pits, and then to 7300 tonnes per day for N-204. R-190 will be mined 

in the first year. Table 16-6 shows the production schedule Tamerlane proposed for the Cluster Pits in 

years 2-7.

17 Recovery Methods 
The 2014 TAM Technical Report operating plan was based upon mining 1 underground and 9 

open pit deposits.  The Recovery Methods section in 2014 TAM was completed by qualified and 

professional personnel and Darnley Bay believes their work has significant value and is 

therefore including the 2014 TAM Recovery Methods section on an informational basis. 

 

The 2014 TAM Pine Point Mine Development Project identified 8 deposits of similar composition, 

referred to as the Cluster Pits (CPs), in addition to those identified in the MineTech NI 43-101 

Technical Report of April 2, 2012 and the MineTech NI 43-101 Technical Report of March 23, 

2012.  As in the MineTech NI 43-101 Technical Report of April 2, 2012, mineralization occurs as 

coarse galena and sphalerite in a matrix of limestone, dolomite and shale. The metallurgical 

program has demonstrated that standard zinc and lead flotation preceded by dense media 

separation (DMS) will yield excellent recoveries, above 90 percent and good concentrate grades, 

above 60 percent for Pine Point coarse grain mineralization. This is confirmed by the concentrates 

produced over a 23 year period by Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) at Pine Point. The proposed 

centralized DMS in conjunction with the R-190 concentrator will process 5,500 tonnes per day  of 

which about 3,700 tonnes per day will be rejected by the DMS plant leaving about 1,800 tonnes 

per day to be transported to the R-190 concentrator for the grinding and flotation circuits. The 

pre-DMS feed grade is expected to average above 2 percent lead and 5 percent zinc.  The post 

DMS pre-concentrate is expected to average between 18% and 20% metals for the R-190 

concentrator feed.  

 

The 2014 TAM plant design consisted of secondary and tertiary crushing; a grinding circuit 

consisting of a ball mill in closed-circuit with cyclones; sequential lead and zinc flotation circuits 

each incorporating three stages of cleaning; concentrate dewatering circuits using thickeners and 

pressure filters; concentrate storage, load-out, and transportation systems; and tailings 

dewatering using a thickener and vacuum filters together with a slurry containment pond for 

excess tailings.  Tailings will be transported back to the mining area and used for reclamation of 

open pits.  

17.1 Crushing and DMS 
Run-of-mine mineralized rock would be crushed and screened to a final size of ¼ inch (-6 mm). 

The minus 6mm material would go to dense media separation.  The bottom screen would be set 

at 14 mesh to keep the fines from interfering with the DMS process.  The fines (minus 14 mesh) 

and the DMS sinks would be trucked straight to the proposed mill at the R-190 site. The DMS float 

material can be used in several ways. It could be sent to the waste pile, used for backfill or used as 

aggregate for road construction or sold to the market for use as construction materials or fill. 

 

The proposed mill on the R-190 site would grind the high grade DMS concentrate, followed by 

flotation recovery of lead and zinc concentrates. 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 190 of 228 
 

17.2 Grinding and Recovery Circuit at the Main Mine Site 
Material from the DMS plant would be fed to the 3.5 metre diameter by 5.6 metre long ball mill 

that would operate in closed circuit with a cyclone cluster. Cyclone underflow would be recycled 

to the mill. Cyclone overflow, currently designed for 80 percent passing 105 micron, would flow to 

the pre-float circuit. 

17.2.1 Pre-Float Circuit  

Cyclone overflow will be directed to the pre-float cell (scalps bituminous-activated slimes). The 

cell float will report to tails and the cell underflow will report to the lead conditioner prior to 

reporting to the lead flotation circuit. 

17.2.2 Lead Circuit 

The grinding circuit product after the pre-float is conditioned before feeding a lead rougher float 

bank. The underflow from the rougher, feeds a scavenger circuit. Tails of the scavenger become 

feed to the zinc circuit. Overflow from both the rougher and scavengers feed two parallel flotation 

columns. Underflow from the cleaners is recycled to the feed of the rougher bank. Column 

overflow is passed to the lead thickener. Thickened lead concentrate is then pressure filtered and 

stockpiled for transporting to the railhead at Hay River. 

17.2.3 Zinc Circuit 

The tails of the lead circuit report to the zinc circuit. This is conditioned with the proper reagents 

before feeding the zinc rougher and zinc scavenger flotation banks. Underflow from the zinc 

scavenger is feed to the tailings thickener. Overflow of both the rougher and scavenger banks is 

conditioned then fed to the zinc cleaner and cleaner scavenger banks. Tails from the zinc cleaner 

scavenger is fed to a second cleaner scavenger. Tails of this second cleaner scavenger is, also, fed 

to the tailings thickener. Second cleaner scavenger overflow is recycled to the conditioning tank at 

the head of the zinc circuit. Overflow from both the cleaner and cleaner scavenger banks feeds 

four parallel flotation columns. Underflow from the columns is recycled to the cleaner scavengers. 

Column overflow feeds the zinc thickener. The zinc product is pressure filtered before being 

stockpiled for transporting to the railhead at Hay River. 

17.2.4 Reagents 

The reagents used in the flotation process, and their consumption, are as per Table 17-1.

17.2.5 Tailings Dewatering and Tailings Disposal 

Flotation tailings will be thickened and the thickener underflow will be pumped to an agitated 

tailings stock tank and then to two vacuum drum filters. Filter cake, at 12 percent moisture 

content, will be conveyed to a stockpile. These filtered tailings would then be back hauled to assist 

in reclaiming previously mined pits, along with the DMS reject and waste material. 

17.2.6 Concentrate Handling 

Processed concentrates would be housed in the mill prior to loading into trucks for transport to 

the rail load-out building located near Hay River. For the purposes of this study, all shipment and 

handling costs have been quoted from Hay River to the Trail, BC smelter. 

17.3 Process Water Balance 
The process water requirement for the on-site crushing and DMS plant will be supplied by the 

dewatering operations at the mine site. Based upon hydrological test work and design, wells will 

be drilled according to design parameters outside the pit limits. Pumps will be inserted in these 

dewatering wells to draw the water table down to allow mining of the deposit. 

 

Initial indications from current monitoring wells, literature and past studies are that the Cluster 

Pits will require dewatering. Dewatering wells close to the DMS will provide all required make-up 

water for the pre-concentrating process.  Excess mine water pumped from the dewatering wells, 

bottom of the pits and process water lost from the system will be returned to the groundwater 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 192 of 228 
 

aquifer by pumping into a mined out open pit which exposes the Presqu'ile formation. Final water 

injection designs will be based on hydrological data currently gathered and from ongoing analysis. 

 
The DMS will operate under a zero discharge operating plan whereby water will discharge and 

then be recovered from a basin, available or constructed.  The only water losses in the DMS 

operation would be evaporation and water that coats the DMS rock entering the stockpile.  Water 

attached to the rock will; 1) evaporate, 2) run off the rock and be returned to the process by way 

of sump collection, or 3) become part of the water balance for the R-190 concentrator. 

17.4 Process Plant 

17.4.1 MMS 

The overall mass balance does not include a regrind circuit. It is planned that the main grinding 

circuit will be using a bond work index of 11.0 kWh/tonne and will have sufficient grinding 

capacity for handling the middlings from the cleaner circuit.  

Tamerlane's Pine Point project has advanced to the detailed engineering stage of equipment 

selection up to and including quotes from vendors and the purchasing of some of the equipment. 

This purchase included a complete set of flotation cells for the rougher and scavengers in both the 

lead and zinc circuits, and the lead and zinc circuit cleaner scavenger units, as shown in Figure 

17-1 and Figure 17-2.  These cells were sold in 2015 while Tamerlane was in receivership.  A 

summary of the costs for each functional area within the mill is shown in Table 17-2. These 

numbers are based on detailed equipment specifications and vendor quotes. Personnel 

requirements are shown in Table 17-7.

17.6 Metal Recovery 
The metallurgical data and metal recovery values used to generate the process design criteria and 

financial model for the Pine Point technical report are presented in Table 17-8 and Table 17-9. The 

data for R-190, and N-204 were generated through laboratory testing using industry standard 

methods and metallurgical balancing techniques.  The data for the Cluster Pits were designated 

based upon mineralogical comparisons to all data tested.  This comparison along with Pine Point 

Mines Ltd.'s (Cominco) experience in Main Trend flotation gives the confidence to expect the 

results assumed.  The excellent metal recovery values reported from laboratory testing combined 

with the production of quality concentrates demonstrates the Pine Point deposits are very 

amenable to treatment by the DMS, grind and selective flotation process.

18 Project Infrastructure 

18.1 Introduction 
The Project will be constructed on a brownfield site and it will require infrastructure to initially 

support the underground mining and processing operations, and then expand to support the 

Cluster Pits. Construction will include, but not be limited to the following major infrastructure 

areas: a decline to underground stope development, ventilation shaft, dense media separation 

circuit, flotation process, buildings, dewatering reinjection well(s), guard shack, office and other 

buildings and onsite power generation facilities.  

 
Figure 18-1.  Isometric View of the Proposed R-190 Mine Plan. 

 
 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 199 of 228 
 

The Pine Point Project property is located 42 km (26 miles) east of Hay River and 140 km (87 

miles) west of Fort Resolution. The PPP property encompasses an area of approximately 614 

hectares (1,516 acres). The property's Main Mine Site (MMS) is located approximately 0.5 km 

north of Territorial Highway 5. The Highway links the communities of Hay River, Fort Resolution, 

and Fort Smith. 

The main mine infrastructure located at the R-190 deposit will be the home for the processing 

plant for all underground deposits, and the pre-concentrate from the CPs and N-204. Figure 18.2 

includes a diagram that outlines the complete footprint of the PPP main mine site and 

surrounding area, including all structures (facilities), stockpiles, freeze perimeter, and above 

ground mine workings.  

Figure 18-2.  R-190 MMS Site layout. 

 

Territorial Highway 5 and 6, (Figure 18-3) are classified as all-weather highways by the 

Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) Department of Transportation (DOT), and the 

42 km stretch of highway between Hay River and the Tamerlane PPP area is paved. The highways 

are rated for year-round commercial use. Throughout the operational life of the historic Pine 

Point Mine (1964 to 1988), this highway was used for all of the commercial trucking and hauling 

activities associated with this large-scale mine development. Thus the historic traffic volumes and 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 200 of 228 
 

weights experienced on this highway were considerably higher than those occurring at this time 

or in the future as a result of development of the Tamerlane PPP.  

Figure 18-3.  Highway 5. 

 

Darnley Bay plans to utilize an existing all weather access road to the PPP deposit site. The access 

entry is off Territorial Highway 5. Several existing roads in the PPP deposit areas were originally 

installed to access gravel quarries managed by the Department of Transportation. Darnley Bay will 

be upgrading the existing MMS road for the majority of construction development and production 

shipments.  

The MMS facilities will be located over 400m from Provincial Route 5 and within 200m of the R-

190 decline. A guard building and a parking area will also be located within the MMS footprint 

area. Construction, materials, repair, and maintenance of all roads pertaining to the project will 

be undertaken by Darnley Bay to ensure year-round safe access for the PPP MMS, surrounding 

deposits and local land users. 

18.2 Electrical Power 
Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC) supplies power to South Slave area via the 

Taltson Dam complex (Figure 18-4). The Taltson facility was brought online in 1965 to supply 

power to the original Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) facilities at Pine Point, which closed down in 

1987, and also to Fort Smith. The facility now supplies power to the towns of Hay River, Fort 

Smith, Fort Resolution and Enterprise. The dam complex currently has 18.5 MW capacity, of which 

5 MW is currently unused and available. In the late 60's the power plant was upgraded to 22.5 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 201 of 228 
 

MW by installing 4 additional 1 MW turbines.  These turbines are not operable or repairable 

although the additional 4MW of power can be added through an upgrading of this facility.  NTPC 

also has plans in place to expand the facility that could add up to an additional 56MW of power 

capacity. 

                      
Figure 18-4.  Talston Dam and Power Facility. 

 
 

 
A 115 kV transmission line(Figure 18-5), approximately 274 kms in length, runs from the Taltson 

Generating Station, south to Fort Smith, then northwest to the Pine Point Substation, which is 

located north of the original Pine Point town site. At this point the distribution of power splits, 

with a 12.5kV transmission line going east for approximately 65 kms along the highway to Fort 

Resolution, and a 72kV transmission line going west for approximately 90 kms through 

Tamerlane's leases, and then along Highway 5 to Hay River.   

 

                     



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 202 of 228 
 

Figure 18-5.  115kv Transmission Line. 

 
 

 
Power for the CP deposits would be supplied via the 72kV transmission line which parallels 

Highway 6 past the deposit on its way to Hay River.  Additional power (up to 3 MW backup) will be 

available through the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) generation.   An onsite substation at 

the N-204 deposit will step-down the power from 72kV to 5kV and distribution will be through a 

single 3MVA main transformer.  

 

The mine power distribution will be at 4160V. Distribution switchgear sized at 5kV will be located 

at the main substation (Figure 18-6). Feeders, both cable and overhead line, will run out from the 

main substation and feed substations located on the mine site. Portable 4160V-600V substations 

will transform voltages down to utilization levels for motor loads for the various pieces of 

equipment. 

 

                              
                             



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 203 of 228 
 

Figure 18-6.  MMS Power Substation Schematic. 

 
 
Power for the processing plant, located at the R-190 site will be supplied by the same 72kv power 

line that is located along Highway 5, which is within a kilometre of the site. During the mining of 

the Cluster Pits, the plant will only be processing pre-concentrated material since the  mill feed 

will have been crushed and pre-concentrated (using DMS) at the centralized Cluster Pit DMS site.  

Electrical substations at the R-190 site will step-down the power from 72kV to 5kV for distribution 

around the mill. Power will be used at either 4160V for large motor loads or stepped down to 

600V for smaller loads in the processing plant and other required equipment at the site. 

Additional backup power will be available at the site through the use of CNG generation. 

18.3 Roads 
The Pine Point property is serviced and split by Highway 6, a 365 day a year maintained paved 

highway.  Some of the deposits are just south of the highway and many are north of the highway. 

 

Use of existing roads and historic exploration cut-lines will be maximized to the extent feasible in 

order to minimize the need for ground disturbance. Roads will be constructed with waste rock 

from the Cluster Pits or N-204. Inert waste rock will be used for road construction, good to 

excellent main hall roads currently exist in the CP area (2013 site visit). 

 

For access to the Cluster Pits, the Pine Point Mines Ltd. (Cominco) haul roads still exist, Figure 

18-7, and require insertion of some road culverts, but primarily routine road maintenance will put 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 204 of 228 
 

these roads back into service.  A short access road will be required from these haul roads to 

access the each CP. 

 

        
Figure 18-7.   Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) Haulage Roads. 

 
 

 

A short access road will be required to allow site access from the highway for construction, 

production, and reclamation activities for N-204. 

 

Site roads will be necessary for various activities at the site including roads for monitoring of slope 

instrumentation. Other roads which will be necessary include roads to access stockpiles and 

settling facilities. 

 

At the MMS, Darnley Bay will provide a small parking area for employees and contractors working 

or visiting the site. The purpose of the parking area is to minimize congestion in the working areas 

of the mine site and provide security and safety against unauthorized access. The parking area will 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 205 of 228 
 

cover approximately 800m2 (36 x 22 metres).  It will be bermed on all sides so that foot traffic from 

the lot will pass through the guard shack, before entering the operations. 

18.4 Services 

18.4.1 Fuel Storage and Refueling 

Fuel for site equipment will be stored in approved fuel storage tanks at a fuel depot in a central 

area servicing the Cluster Pits.  A similar facility will be established at N-204 when it is developed.  

Fuel and lubricants will be supplied via tanker truck from a local supply depot. Appropriate spill 

response equipment will be stored at the tank farm facility. 

18.4.2 Explosives Storage 

Two explosives magazines will be located on the CP mine site - one for explosives and the second 

for detonators such as the magazine displayed in Figure 18-8. 

 
Figure 18-8.  Portable Explosives Magazine. 

 
 

The magazine will be located according to NRCAN and NWT regulations. Road access to the 

magazines will have a locked gate. A primary lock will secure the magazines while a secondary lock 

will be used for a chain link fence to be installed at the magazine access. 

18.4.3 Potable Water 

Locally treated groundwater will be used for grey water purposes.  A potable drinking water 

supply for the CP facilities will need to be sourced from an external supplier. 



Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

Page 206 of 228 
 

18.4.4 Sanitary Waste Water 

There will be holding tanks on site for waste from the mine dry. The waste will be pumped out 

and trucked to the MMS site as required. Wastewater treatment will be done at the MMS mine 

site. 

18.4.5 Refuse, Waste and Recycling 

Expanded use of the refuse disposal contract will provide for the transfer of all garbage to the 

municipal disposal site by a local contractor. 

 

Hazardous materials will be stored in a secure and appropriate location and disposed of by 

persons qualified to handle those materials. 

 

All recyclable wastes will be sold to a scrap dealer and industrial waste/hazardous materials will 

be managed by an approved contractor.

19 Market Studies and Contracts 
Darnley Bay has identified several potential markets for Pine Point lead and zinc concentrate sales.  

Darnley Bay expects to establish concentrate purchase contracts with one or more lead and zinc 

smelting companies under terms consistent with the current market terms while retaining a portion of 

the production to market at spot treatment charges. 

 

19.1 Lead Market  
The U.S. Government's recent 2012 commodity summary for lead (USGS, 2013) indicated that in 2012 

there was an increase in global refined lead production; the global lead market was in surplus, however 

warehoused stocks of lead were decreasing.    

For the past year, the price forecast for lead has been favorable.  For example: 

 FactsSet's (July 2013) Pb Price Outlook for 2013 – 2016 estimates the price to increase from 

U.S.$0.97/lb to $1.04/lb (based on an average of the forecast from 66 brokers). 

 Deutsche Bank's July 8, 2013 Commodities Weekly Report forecast Lead prices of US$0.99 in 

2013, $1.02 in 2014 and $1.05 in 2015. 

 In March, 2012 Credit Suisse Research published a 2 year horizon (2012 – 2014) with a 50% 

increase in the commodity performance of Lead. 

19.2 Zinc Market  
The U.S. Government's recent 2012 commodity summary for zinc (USGS, 2013) indicated that in 2012 

there was an increase in global zinc mine production but a decrease in refined metal.  Global 

consumption of zinc declined slightly in 2012 which resulted in a surplus on the year (USGS, 2013). 

For the past year, the price forecast for zinc has been favorable.  For example: 

 FactsSet's (July 2013) Zn Price Outlook for 2013 – 2016 estimates the price to increase from 

U.S.$0.89/lb to $1.04/lb (based on an average of the forecast from 64 brokers). 

 Deutsche Bank's July 8, 2013 Commodities Weekly Report forecast Zinc prices of US$0.90 in 

2013, $0.95 in 2014 and $1.05 in 2015. 

 Salman Partners' November 20, 2012 newsletter Metals Morning Note predicted a continuous 

increase in the average annual price of zinc each year from 2012 through 2021. 

 Deutsche Bank's August 3, 2012 edition of Commodities Weekly Report presented a global zinc 

supply model with surplus in 2009 decreasing to global deficit by 2014 at the same time that 

they forecast  the Zinc price to increase from U.S.$0.75/lb (in 2009) to $1.13/lb (in 2014). 

 In March, 2012 Credit Suisse Research published a 2 year horizon (2012 – 2014) with a 40% 

increase in the commodity performance of Zinc.

19.3 Lead Usage 
The following summary was prepared based on information obtained from the Internal Lead Zinc Study 

Group (ILZSG), the International Lead Association, and the Advanced Lead Acid Battery Consortium.
6
  

Lead usage is summarized in Figure 19-1. 

Lead is integral to our modern lifestyle. Whilst its malleability and corrosion resistance still make it 

useful for roof flashings and cladding, the main benefits are derived from harnessing lead's chemical 

properties. 

Its incredible density provides unrivalled protection from radiation and is essential to staff working in 

hospitals, dental surgeries, laboratories and nuclear installations. Lead stabilizers are added to some PVC 

products to improve durability, and the metal protects thousands of kilometres of underwater power 

and communications cables. 

Keeping the world on the move in so many ways wouldn't be possible without the lead used in battery 

technology. Lead acid batteries are the mainstay of storage technologies for renewable energy sources, 

such as solar cell and wind turbines and are used to power cars, trucks, buses, motorbikes, electric 

vehicles and hybrid vehicles. Furthermore, lead acid batteries are vital as a back-up emergency power 

supply in case of mains power failure in hospitals, telephone exchanges, mobile phone networks, public 

buildings and for the emergency services. 

 Battery powered vehicles such as fork lift trucks are non-polluting, quiet and low on

19.4 Zinc Usage 
The following summary was prepared based on information obtained from the Internal Lead Zinc Study 

Group (ILZSG), and the International Zinc Association.
7
  Zinc usage is summarized in Figure 19-2. 

 

Over 11 million tons of zinc are produced annually worldwide. Fifty percent of this amount is used for 

galvanizing to protect steel from corrosion. Approximately 17% goes into the production of zinc base 

alloys, mainly to supply the die casting industry and 17% to produce brass and bronze. Significant 

amounts are also utilized in rolled zinc applications including roofing, gutters and down-pipes. The 

remainder is consumed in compounds such as zinc oxide and zinc sulfate. 

 

These first-use suppliers then convert zinc into in a broad range of products. Main application areas 

include: construction, transport, consumer goods, electrical appliances and general engineering.

20 Environmental Studies, Permitting, and Social or Community Impact  
There is no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political 

or other relevant issue that would adversely affect the development of the mineral resources outlined in 

this report.   

 

Pine Point Holding Corp. has all of the environmental permits necessary to construct and operate a mine 

and mill at the R-190 deposit.  These permits allow for the extraction and processing of a one million 

tonne bulk sample.  Pine Point Holding Corp. anticipates issuance of the necessary permit renewal in 

December 2016 to conduct diamond drilling exploration at the Pine Point Holding leases and claims.  

Details related to the terms of these permits are explained in Table 20-1.

Consultation with communities, First Nation and Metis groups is generally completed as part of the 

permitting process in order to obtain a "social license to operate".  Tamerlane has signed "Exploration 

Agreements" with the First Nation and Metis groups in the Pine Point area that allow for extraction of a 

one million tonne bulk sample at R-190, in addition to construction of associated infrastructure to 

process and concentrate the sample.  These exploration agreements, which are functionally "impact 

benefit agreements" for the exploration phase of the project, indicate positive relations with local and 

First Nation and Metis communities.  These agreements are assignable from Tamerlane to Darnley Bay. 

 

There is currently a $60,000 bond associated with the MV2008C0023 Type A land use permit which 

covers the exploration work at Pine Point. 

Before mining activities are allowed to start at the R-190 site, the following management plans must be 

submitted to the government for approval:  

 Closure and reclamation plan; 

 Contaminant loading and management plan; 

 Injection well design and operations plan; 

 Mine waste characterization and management plan; 

 Public engagement plan; 

 Spill contingency plan; 

 Underground mine waste disposal plan; 

 Water management plan; 

 Design and operations plan for freeze wall; and 

 Design and operations plan for sediment settling pond. 

20.1 Environmental Studies 
Tamerlane and their consultants completed extensive baseline studies throughout the Pine Point area in 

order to collect data necessary to support the permitting process for the mine plans going forward.  It is 



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 

Page 213 of 228 
 

typical for the government agencies to request substantial site-specific data back-up during the 

permitting process, and that data gathering is largely completed for the deposits discussed in this 

report. 

Recent baseline studies conducted in anticipation of the upcoming permitting process for the next phase 

of the mining operations at Pine Point included: 

 Dustfall monitoring 

 Air quality monitoring 

 Noise monitoring 

 Vegetation surveys 

 Wildlife surveys 

 Waste rock characterization 

 Groundwater quality monitoring 

 Surface water quality monitoring 

 Fisheries and benthic invertebrate surveys 

 Wetland characterizations 

 Heritage resources surveys  

 Soil surveys 

 Streamflow studies 

 Protected species evaluations 

 Demographic data gathering 

These recent studies taken together with studies completed in 2005/2006 for the initial permitting 

effort, published studies done by other investigators in the area, and the historic data collected by 

Westmin and Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) should meet the data requirements of the upcoming 

permitting process. 

It is important to note that the results of all of these studies indicate that the Pine Point area has a 

variety of different habitats that support species typical of the midboreal lowlands.  Unique ecosystems 

and/or critical populations of protected species are not known from the project area.  Multiple studies 

conducted by independent scientists report that historic mining activities at Pine Point have not had any 

adverse impacts on Great Slave Lake nor the regional ecology

.  Local residents continue to hunt and

gather in the Pine Point area and they reported in the public hearings for the R-190 Project that the 

previously disturbed open pit mine areas are once again supporting a greater diversity of species. 

20.2 Permitting Requirements 
The environmental permits are in place for the Pine Point Project at R-190.  As originally conceived, it 

was proposed that progressive mining of the underground deposits at P-499, O-556, X-25, Z-155 and G-

03 would immediately follow extraction of the bulk sample at R-190 via underground drifting methods.  

It was assumed that the environmental permitting for these additional deposits could be achieved 

through a permit modification process.  This assumption was reasonable based upon the small surface 

footprint anticipated at these deposits and the ability to demonstrate that the operator's environmental 

commitments were being met at the R-190 Project.  It is expected that a permit modification process to 

mine one or more of these additional deposits via the underground drift method would require at least 

one year to complete.   The regulatory agencies have not committed to permitting this additional 

underground mining via a permit modification process; the regulators may require that Tamerlane 

obtain a separate permit to develop these additional deposits. 

Development of open pit mines at Pine Point and/or development of the underground deposits via 

methods other than underground drift from the R-190 site will require that Darnley Bay obtain a new 

Land Use Permit and a new Water License from the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board (MVLWB).  

This permitting is subject to review and approval by the MVLWB and the federal department of 

Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC).  It is likely that the MVLWB will require 

that the project complete an Environmental Impact Assessment process with the Mackenzie Valley 

Environmental Impact Review Board (MVEIRB) before they make any decision related to the land use 

permit and water license applications.  Both the MVLWB and the MVEIRB have public consultation and 

comment periods built into their processes.  It is typical for it to take two to three years (or more) for a 

new applicant to obtain the necessary environmental permits for a mining project in the NWT.  It is 

possible that permits for the Pine Point deposits described in this report can be obtained in less than 

two years due to the following advantages:   

 much of the new development will use existing infrastructure (haul roads, mill, quarry pits, etc) 

which minimizes impacts;  

 most, if not all, of the background data collection required for the environmental impact 

assessment process is completed;  

 some of the issues of concern to the local First Nation and Metis groups have been addressed in 

this current mine plan; and 

 the previous permitting process documented agency concerns related to Pine Point and to 

underground mining with freeze ring technology, all of which will allow for those concerns to be 

proactively addressed in the permit applications for the next phase of the project.

The above chart is accurate in terms of the timeframes allotted to each function.  The actual start date 

for the first item will be determined at a later date. 

A variety of additional permits and licenses will be required from local, territorial and federal agencies 

once the project is financed and final construction plans are complete.  These vary from business 

license, to explosive magazine license, to electrical permit, among others.   Health and safety permits 

are discussed in Section 4.7.2. 

20.3 Waste and Water Management Requirements 
Based on the past production history in the area and from more recent test work that Tamerlane has 

carried out, the waste rock is not known to be acid-generating.  Tailings ("floats") from the dense media 

separation process would be used for site road construction, sold as aggregate, used to backfill the pits 

or sent to the waste pile(s), in that order. The sulphide content of this material will be very low.  The 

mineralized rock would be further milled and concentrated at the R-190 mill site.  Dewatered mill 

tailings from the R-190 site will be back-hauled to the mining sites and used as backfill in the mining 

panels or dumped in mined out pits. 

 
Historically, during Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco)'s tenure at Pine Point, dewatering of the deposits 

was a challenge and it will continue to be a challenge during Tamerlane's mining operations. MVLWB 

expects that mining projects cause no adverse impacts to groundwater or surface waters; this must be 

demonstrated via modeling during the permitting phase.  Tamerlane will explore the possibility of direct 

discharge of water onto the land surface.  If that is not possible, Tamerlane will consider using the old 

Pine Point Mines Ltd (Cominco) mine pits as "injection wells" in the water management program at Pine 

Point. 

20.4 Monitoring Requirements 
Project monitoring is required as part of the R-190 Project and will likely be required under new permits 

as well.  Required monitoring for the Project includes: 

 Air quality in the underground mine 

 Air quality near the surface operations 

 Freezewall creation 

 Freezewall performance including pipe, brine and ground temperatures

 Freezewall melting thaw rates 

 Waste rock storage seepage 

 Post-closure revegetation monitoring at years 1 and 5 

 Quality of discharge water throughout project and for 6 months after project completion 

 Well operation and well water levels 

 Condition of sediment settling pond 

 Effluent quality 

 Whooping crane monitoring every 2 weeks May – September in near-by wetlands 

 Yellow Rail (a species of bird) monitoring in near-by wetlands in June of the year prior to 

construction 

 On-going checks of infrastructure to identify wildlife use (and find ways to discourage the 

animals) 

 Wildlife use of decommissioned sites post-closure (duration not specified)  

It is likely that similar monitoring requirements would be written into new permits for development of 

the deposits described in this report. 

20.5 Social and Community Requirements 
The territorial government took an active role in the R-190 Project's impact assessment process in 

ensuring that Tamerlane made commitments to hire local staff, use local contractors, and provide 

benefits to the local communities in other ways.  Since that time, the GNWT has developed a more 

formal process for obtaining similar commitments from project proponents as described below in text 

provided by GNWT:   

"The Government of the Northwest Territories cannot set terms for resource development on 
Federal Crown land.  However, when an environmental assessment takes place for a major 
resource development, the GNWT asks for follow-up programs to be put in place in the form of 
socio-economic agreements (SEA). 
 
"The Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment is responsible for negotiating these 
agreements on behalf of the Government of the Northwest Territories. 
 
"The department also oversees the implementation of these agreements and coordinates 
Government efforts under each agreement while monitoring how well each company carries out 
its respective responsibilities. 
 
"These agreements reflect the commitments and predictions made by the company during its 
environmental assessment including:  

 Employment and business opportunities; 
 Cultural well-being and traditional economy; 



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 

Page 217 of 228 
 

 Community, family, and individual well-being; 
 Net effects on government; and 
 Sustainable development." 

9
 

 

The terms of these agreements may end up being similar to separate contractual agreements between 

mining companies and Aboriginal communities.  Although not required by law, it is usual and customary 

for mining companies to negotiate and implement an "Impact and Benefit Agreement" (IBA) with 

affected Aboriginal communities in order to obtain Aboriginal consent for the project.   

The land that Tamerlane has leased is Crown Land; it does not belong to an Aboriginal group.  There are 

three Aboriginal groups with (unsettled) land claims in the Pine Point area:  the Katlodeeche First 

Nation, the Deninu Kue First Nation, and the Northwest Territory Metis Nation.  Tamerlane has IBAs in 

place with all three groups for the R-190 Pilot Project (called "Exploration Agreements") and has 

committed to negotiating new IBAs with each group for future phases of the mining activities at Pine 

Point.  IBAs are developed through a negotiation process that typically lasts 6 – 12 months; funding for 

the negotiations is typically provided by the mining company and the federal government.  The 

negotiations can occur before, during or after the permitting process; it is typical for the negotiations to 

be completed sometime during the permitting process at which time the First Nations will then 

publically support the project.   

The most common terms in IBAs are cash and/or stock payments; employment and/or contracting 

commitments; and education and training opportunities for Band/Nation members.  Unemployment 

rates are high
10

 (28% unemployment) in the Hamlet of Fort Resolution (where 89% of the population is 

Aboriginal) and on the Katlodeeche FN's Hay River Reserve (24% unemployment).  Members of these 

communities are anxious for more and better job opportunities and have said as much at public 

hearings for the Pine Point project. 

20.6 Mine Closure  
From a regulatory perspective, reclamation and closure are regulated by the Land Use Permit and Water 

License.  Pine Point Holding Corp.'s permits allow for progressive reclamation at the R-190 Project and 

completion of reclamation activities prior to the expiration of the permit.  Northern mine sites always 

pose a challenge for reclamation; however, other mining projects completed in the north have 

developed suitable reclamation programs and provide a sound basis for the planning of a reclamation 

program. Re-vegetation will pose the greatest challenge with the slow growth of northern plant species. 

Tamerlane submitted a Conceptual Closure and Reclamation Plan to the MVLWB; the plan will need to

be finalized to comply with conditions in Schedule 2 of the Water License and Section 26 of the Land Use 

Permit prior to initiating construction.   

 

Security deposits which need to be posted prior to initiating construction at R-190 are as follows: 

 $2,250,000 per the terms of the water license, and 

 $1,200,000 per the terms of the land use permit. 

It has been assumed that a similar security deposit will be required for development of the Cluster Pits 

and N-204. 

 

Security deposits in the NWT are calculated by the government based upon results obtained from the 

"RECLAIM" mine restoration cost model.  Security deposits will be required for the additional mining 

activity proposed at Pine Point.

23.1 Resource Technical Report 
Darnley Bay will move quickly to recover the Tamerlane Ventures Inc. historic resources and will 

commission a technical report that will bring these historic resources back into current resources. 



 Pine Point Mine Development Project 
Summary Technical Report Update 2016 

 

Page 221 of 228 
 

23.2 PEA Technical Report 
Darnley Bay will commission a major mining engineering company to author a Preliminary Economic 

Analysis with an updated mine plan which will reflect both the current state of the metals market and 

reduction of risk.  The anticipated cost is $300,000. 

23.3 Geophysics 
In the first quarter of 2017 Darnley Bay will do an up to date geophysics program focusing on the major 

areas of leased land that was of little interest to the former operator due to the distance from operating 

concentrator.  Although regional drilling was completed by the previous operator, 15 km of leases 

remain significantly under-explored.  The anticipated cost is $500,000. 

23.4 Confirmation Drilling 
To the extent required by the Qualified Person authoring the PEA and accumulating data for the Pre-

Feasibility technical reports, some amount of confirmation drilling may be required.  Darnley Bay 

believes that this will be a small program per the assessment of the QP authoring 2014 TAM.  The 

anticipated cost is $500,000. 

23.5 Deposit Infill Drilling 
The previous operator discovered several deposits that were left under-explored due to their location 

and due to initial grade indications.  Darnley Bay will do drilling to meet the requirements for resource 

definition and pit design.  Infill drilling could occur throughout the first three quarters. The anticipated 

cost is $500,000 

23.6 Exploration Drilling 
Fifteen kilometres of leases in the main trend have been targeted as a prime exploration area with 

already defined drill targets.  Darnley Bay will do exploration drilling in this area along with additional 

targets defined by the Darnley Bay geophysics program.  Exploration drilling will occur throughout 2017.  

The anticipated exploration drilling expenditure is $3,000,000. 

23.7 Pre-Feasibility Technical Report 
With the additional information obtained with the drill programs, Darnley Bay will undertake to have an 

Independent QP produce a pre-feasibility technical report.  While the data will be collected and 

organized throughout the first two quarters of 2017, it is anticipated that the report will be authored in 

the third Quarter.
