Technical Report – Hi-Mars Property  1 

 

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

1 Summary 

This technical report describes and evaluates historical and recent exploration work done on 

the Hi-Mars mineral property (the "Property" or the "Hi-Mars Property"). The Property, 

which is road accessible, is located approximately 17 kilometres northeast of the City of 

Powell River in southwest British Columbia, Canada. The Property is at an early stage of 

exploration. There are no estimates of mineral resources or reserves for the Property. 

This technical report has been prepared at the request of Straightup Resources Inc. 

("Straightup" or the "Company"), a private company seeking listing on the Canadian 

Securities Exchange. The qualifying property consists of 11 contiguous mineral titles 

covering an area of 1788.00 hectares within the Vancouver Mining Division of southwest 

British Columbia, Canada. These mineral titles are held by Mr. Craig Lynes on behalf of 

Rich River Exploration Ltd. ("Rich River"). Straightup has entered into an Option 

Agreement (as defined below) with Mr. Craig A. Lynes and Rich River, pursuant to which 

the Company has earned an initial 51% interest in the property and has an option to earn the 

remaining 49% interest in the Property. 

This technical report describes the results of the 2017 exploration program completed on the 

Hi-Mars Property. This program involved collecting 73 rock and 726 soil samples mainly 

along existing logging roads. This work was done by Rich River on behalf of Straightup. All 

samples were analyzed by ALS ("ALS"), North Vancouver B.C. A Statement of Work 

claiming assessment credit of $107,450.52 for the work done in 2017 was filed with the BC 

Mineral Titles Branch on May 29, 2018 (MTO Event 5698635). 

The Hi-Mars Property covers six distinct Minfile mineral occurrences all of which are 

classified as porphyry Cu-Mo type. Soil and rock sampling at and in the vicinity of these 

showings in 2017 confirmed the presence of anomalous soils and low to moderate grade Cu 

and Mo mineralization in granitic rocks, which essentially confirmed the results of previous 

exploration work on the Property. However, several showings located in 2017 along some of 

the more recent logging roads appear to be new. These discoveries have expanded the area 

of interest on the property and warrant more follow-up work. 

In the author's opinion, the Hi-Mars Property continues to be a property of merit and 

additional expenditure on mineral exploration is warranted. The main focus of this work 

should be to locate the source of anomalous concentrations of Cu and Mo in soil samples. 

This will help enhance the economic potential of the property. Targeted soil sampling and IP 

geophysical surveys would help to determine how widespread sulphide mineralization might

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

be in the underlying bedrock. This work would focus on areas of anomalous soils and 

known Cu-Mo showings. Depending on the results of this work, a second stage of 

exploration would involve diamond drilling of the best targets. 

 

2 Introduction 

This technical report has been prepared at the request of Straightup, the Property operators. 

The author has been asked to review all the data pertaining to the Property and to prepare 

a technical report that describes the historical work completed on the Property, reviews 

the results of the 2017 work done on behalf of Straightup and makes recommendations 

for further work, if warranted.

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

This technical report describes the results of geochemical sampling done on the Property in 

November and December 2017 by Rich River. Rich River is owned by Mr. Craig A. Lynes 

who is the registered owner of the mineral titles that comprise the Hi-Mars Property. 

This technical report has been prepared in compliance with the requirements of National 

Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and Form 43-101F1 – 

Technical Report and is intended to be used as supporting documentation to be filed by 

Straightup with the Securities Commissions in connection with an initial public offering of 

its common shares and the listing thereof on the Canadian Securities Exchange. 

In preparing this technical report, the author has reviewed the geological, geophysical and 

geochemical reports, maps and miscellaneous papers listed in the References section of this 

technical report. Of particular value are a number of publicly available assessment reports 

and property files recording work done by previous operators on the Hi-Mars Property. 

These reports contain detailed information on the results of work done on the Property since 

its initial discovery. 

The author visited the Hi-Mars Property on November 8, 2017. At the time of this visit Rich 

River was conducting a rock and soil geochemical sampling program. The results of this 

program are documented in this technical report. 

The units of measure used in this technical report are metric; monetary amounts are in 

Canadian dollars. All maps, with the exception of the general location map (Figure 1), are in 

Universal Transverse Mercator projection, Zone 10N and are based on the North American 

1983 datum (NAD83) or World Geodetic 1984 datum (WGS84). 

3 Reliance on other Experts 

The author has not relied on the opinion of non-qualified persons in the preparing of this 

technical report. All opinions expressed in this technical report are those of the author based 

on a review of historical work done on the property including work done in November and 

December 2017 by Rich River.  

4 Property Description and Location 

The Hi-Mars Property is located approximately 17 kilometres northeast of the town of

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

Details of the status of title ownership for the Hi-Mars Property were obtained from the 

Mineral Titles On-line ("MTO") database of the Mineral Titles Branch of the Province of 

British Columbia. In British Columbia mineral titles are acquired online using a grid cell 

selection system. Title boundaries are based on lines of latitude and longitude. There is no 

requirement to mark title boundaries on the ground as these can be determined using a 

Global Positioning System ("GPS"). Therefore, the Hi-Mars mineral titles have not been 

surveyed.  

The mineral titles comprising the Hi-Mars Property are shown in Figure 3 and listed in 

Table 1. The mineral title boundaries shown in Figure 3 were generated by the author using 

geospatial data downloaded from the GeoBC website. These spatial layers are the same as 

those incorporated into the MTO electronic staking system that is used to locate and record 

mineral titles in British Columbia. The information presented in Table 1 and Figure 3 is 

current as of June 24, 2018.  

The Property is centered at 49°56'26"N Latitude and 124°21'33"W Longitude. The 

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates for this point are 402,474E 5,532,907N 

(Zone 10, NAD83). The Property is located in the Vancouver Mining Division, on NTS map 

sheet 92F/16.

refinery or other place of treatment of the proceeds from the sale of the minerals, ore, 

concentrates or other products from the Hi-Mars Property. Straightup will be the operator of 

the Property during the term of the Option Agreement and Rich River. will be the primary 

contractor when possible. Straightup will also pay any rates, taxes, duties, royalties, 

assessments or fees levied with respect to the Property or Rich River and Mr. Lynes' 

operations thereon and will apply and pay for assessment credits for the mineral claims 

comprising the Property for all the work and expenditures conducted on all or any part of the 

Property.  

4.4 Required Permits and Reporting of Work 

Acquisition of mineral titles in British Columbia is done electronically through MTO. The 

electronic map used by MTO allows you to select single or multiple adjoining grid cells. 

Cells range in size from approximately 21 hectares (457m x 463m) in the south at the 49th 

parallel to approximately 16 hectares in the north at the 60th parallel. This is due to the 

longitude lines that gradually converge toward the North Pole. Clients are limited to 100 

selected cells per submission for acquisition as one mineral title. The number of submissions 

is not limited, but each submission for a claim must be completed through to payment before 

another can commence. No two people can select the same cells simultaneously, since the 

database is live and updated instantly; once you make your selection, the cells you have 

selected will no longer be available to another person, unless the payment is not successfully 

completed within 30 minutes. 

In British Columbia, the owner of a mineral title acquires the right to the minerals which 

were available at the time of title acquisition as defined in the Mineral Tenure Act of British 

Columbia. Surface rights and placer rights are not included. Mineral titles are valid for one 

year and the anniversary date is the annual occurrence of the date of recording (the "Issue 

Date").  

A mineral title has a set expiry date (the "Good To Date"), and in order to maintain the title 

beyond that Good to Date, the recorded holder (or an agent) must, on or before the Good to 

Date, register either exploration and development work that was performed on the title, or a 

payment instead of exploration and development ("PIED"). Failure to maintain a title results 

in automatic forfeiture at the end (midnight) of the Good to Date; there is no notice to the 

title holder prior to forfeiture. 

When exploration and development work or a PIED is registered, the title holder or agent 

may advance the title forward to any new date. With PIED the minimum requirement is 

6 months, and the new date cannot exceed one year from the current expiry date; with work, 



Technical Report – Hi-Mars Property  10 

 

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

it may be any date up to a maximum of ten years beyond the current anniversary year. All 

recorded holders of a mineral title must hold a valid Free Miners Certificate ("FMC") when 

either work or PIED is registered on a mineral title.  

The following are the current exploration expenditure or PIED amounts required to maintain 

a mineral title in good standing for one year: 

Mineral Title - Work Requirement: 

• $5 per hectare for anniversary years 1 and 2; 

• $10 per hectare for anniversary years 3 and 4; 

• $15 per hectare for anniversary years 5 and 6; and 

• $20 per hectare for subsequent anniversary years. 

Mineral Title - PIED 

• $10 per hectare for anniversary years 1 and 2; 

• $20 per hectare for anniversary years 3 and 4; 

• $30 per hectare for anniversary years 5 and 6; and 

• $40 per hectare for subsequent anniversary years. 

Only work and associated costs for the current anniversary year of the mineral title may be 

applied toward that title. A report detailing work done and expenditures made must be filed 

with the B.C. Ministry of Energy and Mines within 90 days of filing of a Statement of Work 

("SOW"). After the report is reviewed by ministry staff it is either approved or returned to 

the submitter for correction. Failure to produce a compliant report could result in loss of 

assessment credit and forfeiture of the mineral titles to which the credit was applied. 

Prior to initiating any physical work such as drilling, trenching, bulk sampling, camp 

construction, access upgrading or construction and geophysical surveys using live electrodes 

(IP) on a mineral property a Notice of Work permit application must be filed with and 

approved by the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines. The filing of the Notice of 

Work initiates engagement and consultation with all other stakeholders including First 

Nations. 

4.5 Environmental Liabilities 

The author is not aware on any environmental issues or liabilities related to historical 

exploration or mining activities that would have an impact on future exploration of the 

Property.

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography 

5.1 Access 

Access to the Property is via paved highway 101 going either 20 km east from Powell River 

or 12.5 kilometres west from Saltery Bay to the start of the Goat Lake Main Forest Service 

Road. This all-weather gravel road extends northward where it passes through the Property 

at approximately kilometre 20. In recent years, extensive logging in the area has resulted in 

the construction of many new logging roads resulting in excellent access to the Property. 

As mentioned in an earlier section of this report the Property is located on Crown Land 

which is open for mineral exploration. Consequently, there should not be any issues with 

surface rights if the Property should be developed. In the authors opinion there are a number 

of potential mill sites, tailings storage areas, potential waste disposal areas and heap leach 

pad sites that could be developed on or near the Property should they be required.  

5.2 Climate and Vegetation 

Vegetation on the Property includes second growth trees of the Coastal Douglas Fir 

biogeoclimatic zone which is characterized by Douglas fir, western red cedar and hemlock. 

spruce, Amabilis fir and birch. Such vegetation is found at elevations less than 900 metres. 

Alder, willow, poplar and cottonwood are commonly found on old logging roads on the 

Property. Undergrowth is typically a variable mixture of salal, devil's club and salmonberry.  

At lower elevations, logging cut blocks of various ages are common with their associated 

overgrown and decommissioned logging roads. In recent years helicopter logging techniques 

have been utilized to harvest first growth timber at higher elevations.  

The climate of the Powell River area is characterized by a mean annual temperature of  

approximately 10.5º C and annual rainfall amounts of 1,116 millimetres. The warmest 

months are July and August with average daily high temperatures of 22.1 ºC. December and 

January are the coolest months with average daily high temperatures of 5 ºC and 5.3 ºC, 

respectively. Greater rainfall and heavier snowpack occurs at higher elevations, while valley 

bottoms are drier and less prone to heavy snow accumulations during the winter months. 

The operating season in this area would normally be 365 days a year.  

The coastal rainforest climate promotes rapid tree growth and revegetation of disturbed 

areas such as clear-cuts and road openings.

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

5.3 Local Resources 

The forest industry is the mainstay of the local economy. Supplies to sustain such operations 

are readily available in Powell River, a town of approximately 13,157 (2016) people.  

5.4 Infrastructure 

The Hi-Mars Property is well situated with regard to local logging road infrastructure 

(Figure 2). Adequate fresh water for a mining operation could be drawn from nearby lakes 

and creeks. There is a hydro transmission line located approximately 20 kilometres south of 

the Property (Figure 2). 

5.5 Physiography  

The Property is located in the foothills of the Coast Mountain Range approximately 

17 kilometres northeast of Powell River. The Property covers hilly terrain and lowland areas 

surrounding Lewis Lake and the steep southern flank of Tinhat Mountain. The area is part of 

the northwest trending Smith Range. Elevations on the Property range from 200 to 680 

metres above sea level (Figure 3). 

6 History 

The following section is a summary of historical work as it pertains to the current 

boundaries of the Property. Only historical work covered by the current Property mineral 

titles is described in this section. As much as is possible the author has tried to georeference 

the historical exploration maps and overlay the current mineral title boundaries to show 

where the historical work was done relative to the Property mineral titles. Unfortunately 

some of the historical exploration maps are of poor quality and lack identifiable geographic 

points and cannot, therefore, be georeferenced to modern base maps. As a result the location 

of some of the historical work done on the property is difficult to determine with any 

accuracy.  

There are no valid historical resource or reserve estimates for the Property and there has not 

been any production from any of the showings. 

6.1 1967 – Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd. 

Copper mineralization occurs in three different areas in the Dodd Lake area. Two showings 

are located west and northwest of Ireland Lake (Minfile 092F 291 Bee and 092F 292 Hi-

Mars) and one is located in the area south of the end of Dodd Lake (Mifnile 092F 289 Pam 

11). These showings were originally covered by the Mary V and Bruce claims respectively 



Technical Report – Hi-Mars Property  13 

 

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

which were staked by Mr. and Mrs. Boylan and Bob Mickle of Powell River in the mid 

1960's. The showings were subsequently added to the Minfile database as the 092F 289 Pam 

11, 92F 291 Bee and 92F 292 Hi-Mars showings. The first significant work done on the 

current Property was by Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd. ("Falconbridge") in 1967 under an 

option agreement. Falconbridge did 116.9 kilometres (72.67 miles) of line cutting in two 

separate grid areas (Bruce and Mary V) covering the three showings. This was followed by 

geological mapping and soil geochemical sampling at 30.5 metre (100 foot) intervals along 

the cut grid lines. Soil samples were only analyzed for copper on the Bruce group 

(2,616 samples) and copper and molybdenum on the Mary V group (1,891 samples). 

Geophysics was also done on parts of the grid, specifically covering areas of known 

showings and favourable geology. A total of 35.3 line-kilometres of magnetometer, 40.1 

line-kilometres of self potential and 99.5 line-kilometres of E.M. 16 determinations were 

done as part of the geophysical program. Follow up work involved 55 metres of trenching 

on the Bruce group and 498.7 metres (5,368 feet) of diamond drilling in 14 drill holes 

(Pilcher, 1967). Of these drill holes 9 were on the Bruce group and 5 were on the Mary V 

group. The Bruce group drill hole locations and assay results for surface samples is shown 

on Figure 4 as reproduced from a later property file report by Phendler (1970) for Caracas 

Mines Ltd. The holes ranged from 76 to 214 metres (250 to 702 feet) in total length and 

were collared based on geology and self potential results. Only low grade copper 

mineralization was intersected in the drilling and Falconbridge subsequently terminated the 

option agreement in late 1967.

6.2 1971 – Hanna Mining Co. 

Early in 1971, the Hanna Mining Co. optioned the Bee and Dee mineral claims (Figure 5) 

from Mrs. Boylan and Mr. Mickle. Bullis Engineering Ltd. was engaged to do the field work 

and report on the property (Bullis 1971, 1971a, 1971b).

Figure 5. Geology and drill hole locations, Bee showing. Base map from Bullis, 1971. 

Georeferencing and mineral title boundaries determined by D.G. MacIntyre, April 2018. 

A map of the area was prepared from air-photos, on a scale of 1 inch equals 400 feet 

(1:4800) by McElhanney Surveying and Engineering Ltd. The map was used for plotting the 

results of the fieldwork. The work was completed in June of 1971 and consisted of a 

reconnaissance geological survey of the area with particular attention paid to the known 

mineral showings (Bullis, 1971). 

The geochemical work was concentrated on those areas where disseminated mineralization 

was known. Grid lines were established on the Mars and the Hi group of claims by cutting 

cross lines at 400 foot intervals and picketing them at one hundred foot intervals. A grid was 

established on the Bruce Claims with cross-lines every two hundred feet and pickets, or 

stations, established at one hundred foot intervals along the cross-lines. A total of 287 soil 

samples were taken at the stations on the cross-lines in three different areas and submitted to 

Vancouver Geochemical Laboratories for analysis. A zone of weak to moderately

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

anomalous soil samples approximately 240 metres long and open to the northeast was 

defined on the Mars grid (Bullis, 1971a), centered on the Hi-Mars showing. 

Although the 3 reports prepared by Bullis in 1971 (Bullis 1971, 1971a, 1971b) essentially 

contain the same information for the 1971 soil sampling completed on grids covering the Hi, 

Mars and Bruce claims, assessment report 3550 also includes a geological map of the Bee 

showing even though this area is not discussed in the report (Figure 5). As shown in Figure 

5 this area is covered by the current Property. The geology map also shows the location of 

four drill holes (F10, 11, 13 and 14) but there is no mention of these drill holes in the report. 

They were apparently drilled by Falconbridge in 1967 (Pilcher, 1967). However, the 

analytical certificate from Vancouver Geochemical Laboratories included with the three 

reports lists Cu values for 17 samples labelled Hole #1 to #17. Holes 1-9 are presumably the 

same as those shown on Figure 4 and were drilled in the vicinity of the Pam 11 showing 

(Phendler, 1970). The location of holes 12, 15, 16 and 17 is unknown. The assay values 

indicated for the drill hole samples range from 284 to 925 and are presumably in parts per 

million (ppm). None of the three reports contain maps showing location of the soil 

geochemical samples collected on the Bruce claims even though the report indicates some of 

these samples were anomalous in copper.  

Additional claims were staked in the area to satisfy the terms of the option agreement 

between the Hanna Mining Co. and the property owners. Bullis (1971, 1971a and 1971b) 

concluded that the mineralization located on the property was too low grade and sporadic to 

warrant further work. 

6.3 1974-1976 – Redonda Syndicate 

In August 1974, W. Meyer and Associates Ltd. on behalf of the Redonda Syndicate, 

examined widespread quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration with some low grade disseminated 

chalcopyrite and molybdenite mineralization in outcrop just south of the end of Dodd Lake. 

The area was previously staked as the Pam claims. Following up on a detailed report by 

Pilcher (1967) that was provided by Falconbridege, an induced polarization ("I.P.") survey 

(Mullan and Fountain, 1974) and geological mapping (Figure 6) were undertaken and 

completed in November 1974 (Meyer, 1974).

Figure 6. Geology, Pam showing. Base map from Meyers, 1974. Georeferencing and mineral title 

boundaries determined by D.G. MacIntyre, April 2018. 

This work defined an area of potential economic interest in the northwest corner of the Pam 

claims based on an anomalous I.P. response and indirect geological evidence (Meyers, 

1974). A program involving an extended I.P. survey and targeted percussion drilling was 

recommended. 

In April and May 1975, the Redonda Syndicate completed 702 metres (2,304 feet) of BQ 

diamond drilling in five holes. Unfortunately, there is no location map included in the 1975 

report that would indicate where the drill holes were collared. The stated purpose of this 

drilling was to test targets delineated by the 1974 I.P. survey and to provide geological 

information in areas of no outcrop (Folk, 1975). A summary of drill holes is given in Table 3 

although as stated above the location of these holes is not known. The holes did not intersect 

significant copper mineralization and no additional work was recommended (Folk, 1975).

6.4 1975 – Newvan Resources Ltd. 

In the latter part of 1975, a field program was carried out on the historical IN and HO claims 

located at the south end of Lewis Lake (Figure 7). This area is now covered by the Property 

as shown in Figures 7 and 8. The work consisted of 8 kilometres of geochemical sampling 

and geological mapping along established grid lines (Meyers, 1975). The work was done by 

W. Meyer and Associates Ltd. on behalf of Newvan Resources Ltd.  This geochemical 

survey defined a series of northwest Mo soil anomalies (Figure 8) with values up to 165 

ppm that are parallel to the regional grain of the intrusive rocks and the fault-controlled 

valley of Lewis Creek (Meyers, 1975).

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

The Redonda Syndicate did an extensive exploration program in the Powell River area in 

1976. This work was done by W. Meyer and Associates. A follow up of a number of silt 

anomalies resulted in the discovery of copper showings on the ridge between Lewis Lake 

and Dodd Lake. The area was mapped in detail (Figure 9) and a soil sampling grid was 

completed and subsequently expanded to cover an area of copper and molybdenum in soil 

anomalies. Although there is a copper soil anomaly associated with the Main showings (Rio 

Tinto Showing "C" on Figure 12) a number of other anomalies occur in the area to the 

southeast as well (Figure 10). A number of samples in this area are strongly anomalous 

returning values over 500 ppm Cu and locally over 1000 ppm Cu (Figure 10). The results of 

this survey led to a detailed program that included test pitting and trenching in bedrock by 

drilling, blasting and chip sampling (Meyer, 1976). Three trenches (Tr. 1-3) over a distance 

of 105 metres exposed low grade copper mineralization ranging from 0.05 to 0.74% Cu 

(Figure 11) associated with east-west trending quartz veining (Meyer, 1976).

In 1976 Rio Tinto Canadian Exploration Ltd. ("Rio Tinto" or "Riocanex") optioned the 

Spring Lake property from Golden Granite Mines Ltd. and Newvan Resources Ltd. 

Riocanex also staked an additional 27 claim units in the area. In October 1976 Phoenix 



Technical Report – Hi-Mars Property  23 

 

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

Geophysics Limited did an induced polarization and magnetometer survey on the property. 

The purpose of this survey was to investigate the subsurface extent of 3 copper-molybdenum 

showings discovered along logging roads in the area ("A", "B" and "C" Showings). The "C" 

Showing is also known as the Spring Lake showing in the Minfile database (Minfile No. 

092F 369). The IP survey defined a number of easterly trending resistivity lows and highs in 

the vicinity of the showings (Figure 12). It was recommended that Rio Tinto drill 3 follow-

up holes to test these anomalies (Mullan and Hallof, 1977).

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

In May and June of 1977, Riocanex mapped the Spring Lake property at 1:10,000 scale 

(Hodgson, 1977). One day was also spent doing a magnetometer survey on four-line 

kilometres of the 1976 IP survey grip. Twenty-four pits were also blasted into bedrock and 

sampled (Figure 13). These pits were mostly along the Tin Hat Mountain access road 

(Hodgson, 1977). In reviewing the historical maps for the Spring Lake showings the author 

noted that the showing labelled "C" Showing on the Figure 12 map image taken from 

Mullan and Hallof (1977) was labelled "B" showing on the Figure 13 map image taken from  

Hodgson (1977), and the showings labelled "C" and "D" on Hodgson's 1977 map (Figure 

13) are not shown on Mullan and Hallof's 1977 map (Figure 12). The showing labelled "B" 

on Mullan and Hallof's map (Figure 12) is not at the same location as the showing labelled 

"B" on Hodgson's map (Figure 13). 

A total of 194 field stations were established as part of the geologic mapping program. From 

these 36 rock samples were collected and assayed. The highest Cu value was 2300 ppm. 

There were no significant Mo assay results. 

Hodgson (1977) states that significant Cu and Mo mineralization is restricted to the vicinity 

of the 4 showings (Figure 13) with Cu values of 0.71%, 0.46%, 0.32-0.16% and 0.07% 

occurring at showings "B", "C", "A" and "D", respectively. Showing "B" also assayed 

0.47% Mo. Hodgson (1977) recommended that the open area east of the "B" and "C" 

showings be tested by shallow drilling.  

6.7 1978 – Asarco Exploration Company of Canada Limited 

In June and July 1978 Asarco Exploration Company of Canada Limited ("ASARCO"), on 

behalf of property owners Home Oil Co. Ltd, Aquitaine Co. of Canada Ltd. and W. Meyer 

and Associates Ltd. did drilling, blasting and sampling of 23 pits to test previously outlined 

molybdenum and copper soil anomalies at the Lewis showing (see Figure 10). The results of 

the geochemical analyses showed that anomalous copper and molybdenum values were 

related to fracture and joint sets within a fine to medium-grained quartz diorite of the Coast 

Range Crystalline Complex (Fletcher, 1978). The best value obtained for the 23 samples 

analyzed was 3,950 ppm Cu. This sample was obtained from a pit in the northern part of the 

grid area. The best value obtained for 14 samples from the southern sector of the grid was 

900 ppm Cu. Molybdenum grades were low ranging form 1 to 55 ppm Mo for all samples 

collected. It was concluded that there was no significant economic concentration of copper 

and/or molybdenum immediately associated with the anomalous soil geochemical values in 

the area tested (Fletcher, 1978).

6.8 1981 – Teck Corporation 

In 1981 Teck Corporation ("Teck") staked the Beach claims to cover the Lewis showings 

that were discovered in 1974 as the result of a regional geochemical stream silt sampling 

program carried out by W. Meyers and Associates Ltd. The original Lewis and Clark claims 

had been allowed to lapse. Teck had planned to do a self potential survey but this plan was 

abandoned due to poor weather conditions and a geological mapping program was done 

instead. The resultant map is included in assessment report 9948 (Betmanis, 1981). 

Unfortunately, there are no geographic reference points on the map and the author was 

unable to georeference this map to the current mineral tenure boundaries with any degree of 

confidence. The approximate area covered by the map is shown in Figure 14.

Geological map is included in Assessment Report 9948 (Betmanis, 1981). Map prepared by D.G. 

MacIntyre, April 2018. 

Bettmanis (1981) concluded that the mineralized zones in the mapped area were too low 

grade and too small in size to be of economic interest.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

7.1 Regional and Local Geology 

The regional geologic setting of the Hi-Mars Property is shown in Figure 15. The original

Figure 15. Regional geologic setting, Hi-Mars Property. Geology from Massey et al., 2005. Map 

prepared by D.G. MacIntyre, May 2018. See table 4 for description of map units. 

The Property is located within the Coast Plutonic Complex, a belt of granitic rocks that form 

a chain of mountain ranges along the western margin of mainland British Columbia. These 

rocks represent the up-lifted roots of a long-lived magmatic arc that has evolved from the 

Late Triassic to present time. As shown in Figure 15, the Property straddles the boundary 

between a northwest trending belt of Early Cretaceous intrusive rocks (EKdr) comprised of 

quartz diorite, tonalite and granodiorite phases (Roddick et al. 1979) and older Later Jurassic 



Technical Report – Hi-Mars Property  29

to Early Cretaceous dioritic intrusive rocks (JKdr). Just east of the Property at Dodd Lake is 

an elongate body that has been mapped as Late Jurasssic to Early Cretaceous quartz 

monzodiorite with minor quartz diorite (JKqd).  The nature of the contacts between the map 

units underlying the Property is unknown due to lack of outcrop in the area. Presumably unit 

EKdr is the youngest and intrudes older units JKdr and JKqd but this contact could also be a 

fault.  

7.2 Property Geology and Mineralization 

There is no detailed geology map for the Property as a whole. Small parts of the Property 

have been mapped in detail near the known showings (Pam, Bee and Lewis) and some of 

this detail is shown on Figures 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 respectively. The following descriptions of 

geology and mineralization at the various showings covered by the Property are taken from 

the Minfile database. Location of mineral showings relative to regional geologic map units 

is shown in Figure 16. 

7.2.1 Pam 11 (Minfile No. 092F 289) 

The Pam 11 occurrence is underlain by Cretaceous hornblende diorite and quartz diorite of 

the Coast Plutonic Complex which have been intruded by later phases of granodiorite. The 

granodiorite has in turn, been intruded by quartz feldspar porphyry and feldspar porphyry 

dykes. A few narrow andesite to basalt dykes cut all other rock types.  

The granodiorite has been sericite-altered and hosts biotite, quartz sericite and pyrite.  

Silicification is associated with a quartz vein stockwork in the granodiorite as well as in an 

area containing lenses of quartz within brecciated granodiorite, parallel to a feldspar 

porphyry dyke. Detailed geology after Phendler (1970) and Meyers (1974) is shown on 

Figures 4 and 6 in the History section of this technical report.  

Veins, joints and dykes are controlled by a 070 to 080 degree trending fracture system that 

dips steeply north.  

Pyrite and chalcopyrite, with minor pyrrhotite, magnetite and sphalerite occur as 

disseminations within silicified granodiorite and in the quartz vein stockwork.  The intensity 

of fracturing decreases away from the Main showing (Rio Tinto Showing "C" Figure 12) but 

pyrite-coated joints are still well developed 300 metres away. Pods and irregular masses of 

chalcopyrite also occur at the Main showing, trending 110 to 150 degrees and crosscutting 

the jointing.  Diamond drilling in 1967, mostly in the vicinity of the main trench, included 

16.5 metres of 0.25 per cent copper.

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

About 150 to 200 metres east of the Pam 11 showing, and on strike with it, chalcopyrite 

occurs as irregular masses near strongly silicified porphyritic granodiorite and quartz diorite.

al. 2005. Map compiled by D.G. MacIntyre, May 2018. See Table 4 for map unit descriptions. 

7.2.2 Bee (Minfile No. 092F 291) 

The Bee occurrence is underlain by quartz diorite and quartz monzonite of the Jurassic to 

Tertiary Coast Plutonic Complex.  

Mineralization occurs in quartz diorite that has been intruded by small aplite stringers, 

feldspar porphyry dykes and several irregular masses of quartz up to 2.4 metres wide.  



Technical Report – Hi-Mars Property  31 

 

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

Quartz-filled joints in the quartz diorite strike 070 to 090 degrees.  The mineralization 

occurs over an area of 30 metres in or near the porphyry dykes and the quartz lenses.  It 

consists of disseminated chalcopyrite and molybdenite, and veinlets and small irregular 

lenses of chalcopyrite and pyrite. Detailed geology and drill hole locations after Bullis 

(1971) are shown on Figure 5 in the History section of this technical report. 

7.2.3 Hi-Mars (Minfile No. 092F 292) 

The Hi-Mars occurrence is underlain by granodiorite and quartz diorite of the Jurassic to 

Tertiary Coast Plutonic Complex which grades into diorite.  

Jointing in the rocks strikes northeast and dips 90 degrees south, and locally contains quartz 

veinlets.  

Fractures contain pyrite, chalcopyrite, molybdenite and limonite. Quartz-filled fractures host 

chalcopyrite and molybdenite. Disseminated pyrite and magnetite are present in the 

granodiorite and quartz diorite host rocks.  Up to 0.5 per cent copper and minor molybdenite 

have been reported (Bullis, 1971a, Assessment Report 3549, page 14). 

7.2.4 Lewis (Minfile No. 092F 366) 

The Lewis occurrence is underlain by Mesozoic diorite of the Coast Plutonic Complex 

which has been intruded by a 500-metre-wide quartz diorite phase of the same age.  

Northeast and northwest striking andesite dykes cut the intrusive rocks. Detailed geology 

after Meyers (1976) is shown on Figure 9 in the History Section of this technical report. 

Chlorite alteration is pervasive.  Secondary biotite is present in a north-northeast striking 

zone of shearing that projects through the area of mineralization. Alaskite dykes up to one 

metre wide occur near the shear zone.  

Mineralization is present in three locations, the Central zone, and the East and South zones, 

250 metres east and southwest of the Central zone, respectively.  

Mineralization consists of disseminated and fracture-filling chalcopyrite in the Central zone, 

and chalcopyrite with molybdenite in the East and South zones.  Disseminated pyrite and 

magnetite are reported near the andesite dykes.  

Maximum values of 0.74 per cent copper over 1.8 metres, and 0.026 per cent molybdenite 

over 1.5 metres have been reported, but the average value from all trenches was 0.12 per 

cent copper (Betmanis, 1981, Assessment Report 9948, page 3).

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

7.2.5 Spring Lake (Minfile No. 092F 369) 

The area of the Spring Lake occurrence is underlain by multi-phased granodioritic intrusions 

of the Mesozoic Coast Plutonic Complex.  Locally, the granodiorite is chloritized with 

epidote-coated fractures. Several west-northwest trending leucocratic felsic dykes, of the 

same general age as the host rock, and late mafic dykes are present.  

Mineralization occurs in four zones located within 500 metres of each other (Hodgson, 

1977). In zone A, disseminated chalcopyrite and pyrite occur in siliceous granodiorite. 

Minor mineralization is also present as fracture coatings. A sample assayed 0.32 per cent 

copper and 0.014 per cent molybdenite (Hodgson, 1977).  

Zone B contains molybdenite and magnetite in thin quartz veinlets. A sample assayed 0.71 

per cent copper and 0.47 per cent molybdenum (Hodgson 1977).  

Zone C, considered the most significant, contains finely disseminated chalcopyrite and 

pyrite in a felsic dyke. Chalcopyrite, molybdenite and magnetite are also present in quartz 

veinlets in granodiorite near a felsic dyke.  Locally, the zone contains azurite and malachite 

on fracture surfaces.  A sample assayed 0.46 per cent copper and 0.005 per cent molybdenite 

(Hodgson 1977).  

Zone D contains disseminated molybdenite and minor chalcopyrite and pyrite in a 

leucocratic felsic dyke. Some rusty pyrite occurs on fractures. A sample assayed 0.07 per 

cent copper and trace molybdenite (Hodgson, 1977).  

7.2.6 Ho 5 (Minfile No. 092F 371) 

The Ho 5 occurrence is underlain by quartz diorite of the Mesozoic Coast Plutonic Complex.  

Molybdenite and chalcopyrite occur in narrow quartz veins.  A sample across 1.5 metres 

from a trench on the southeast corner of Ho 5 claim assayed 0.03 per cent copper and 0.046 

per cent molybdenite (Meyer 1975, Assessment Report 5798).  

8 Deposit Types 

The mineral showings that are covered by the Hi-Mars Property are classified as porphyry 

Cu-Mo type showings in the Minfile database. This deposit type is characterized by Cu and 

Mo bearing veins and disseminations associated with the emplacement of porphyritic 

intrusive rocks usually as late phases of intrusive complexes or as small stocks emplaced 

into older volcanic and sedimentary rock units. Mineral occurrences on the Property display 

most of these characteristics.

9 Exploration 

The 2017 exploration program was conducted by Rich River on behalf of Straightup. The 

program involved soil sampling, prospecting and limited rock sampling, mainly along 

existing logging roads on the Property. A total of 726 soil samples were collected and 

analyzed for 51 elements by the ALS laboratory in North Vancouver B.C. using analytical 

procedure ME-MS41 (Ultra Trace Aqua Regia digestion and ICP-MS analyses). A total of 

73 rocks samples were also submitted for analyses. Summary statistics for soil and rock 

samples collected by Rich River and analyzed by ALS in 2017 are given in Tables 5 and 6. 

The location of soil and rock samples, using proportional sized symbols for Cu and Mo 

values, are presented in Figures 17 and 18, respectively. Table 7 lists rock samples 

containing greater than 1,000 ppm Cu.

9.1 Rock and Soil Sample Results 

9.1.1 Pam 11 (Minfile No. 092F 289) 

Pyrite and chalcopyrite, with minor pyrrhotite, magnetite and sphalerite occur as 

disseminations within silicified granodiorite and in the quartz vein stockwork at the Pam 11 

showing.  Soil samples collected along a logging road north and northeast of the showing 

returned anomalous values for Cu and Mo (Figures 19 and 20). One rock sample (No. 32) 

returned 1480 ppm Cu and 562 ppm Mo. The anomalous soil samples occur over a distance 

of 250 metres with values ranging from 195.5 to 585 ppm Cu. Mo is also anomalous ranging 



Technical Report – Hi-Mars Property  41 

 

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

from 34.1 to 99.9 ppm. It is not clear if these anomalous soil values are related to the 

Pam 11 showing which is approximately 300 metres to the south or to a different, more 

proximal source. The direction of glacial transport is assumed to be northwest to southeast 

which would suggest a different, as yet undetected, source for the anomalies.

9.1.2 Bee (Minfile No. 092F 291) 

Mineralization at the Bee showing occurs in quartz diorite that has been intruded by small 

aplite stringers, feldspar porphyry dykes and several irregular masses of quartz up to 2.4

metres wide. The mineralization consists of disseminated chalcopyrite and molybdenite, and 

veinlets and small irregular lenses of chalcopyrite and pyrite. Soil sampling in 2017 was 

done along a logging road approximately 1,000 metres north of the Bee showing. Only 

weakly anomalous values were returned for Cu and Mo (Figures 21 and 22). The highest 

soil value for Cu was 248 ppm and the highest value for Mo was 47.4 ppm. No rock samples 

were collected in the vicinity of the Bee showing.

9.1.3 Hi-Mars (Minfile No. 092F 292) 

Mineralization at the Hi-Mars showing consists of pyrite, chalcopyrite, molybdenite and 

limonite in quartz-filled fractures. Disseminated pyrite and magnetite are present in the 

granodiorite and quartz diorite host rock.

Figure 23. Rock and soil samples collected near the Hi-Mars showing. Proportional symbol sizes 

and numeric values are for Cu (ppm). Map prepared by D.G. MacIntyre from company data, 

June 2018. 

As shown in Figure 23 a number of soil samples collected at 50 metre intervals along a new 

logging road east and northeast of the Hi-Mars Minfile locality returned anomalous Cu 

values, with the highest value being 1,185 ppm Cu. Further northeast along the same logging 

road, 6 rock samples collected over a distance of approximately 150 metres returned Cu 

values of 2.3%, 2,980 ppm, 1,525 ppm, 2,280 ppm, 3,270 ppm, 1,990 ppm and 4,470 ppm 

(respectively, samples 26, 28, 29, 64, 65, 66). These samples were also anomalous in Mo 

with values ranging from 233-1,535 ppm (Figure 24). The samples are described as 

granodiorite with molybdenite and chalcopyrite along fractures. Two more strongly 

anomalous rock samples were collected approximately 200 metres further east-northeast and 

returned values of 6,870 ppm and 2.3% Cu respectively (samples 56 and 57). Sample 56 

also returned 952 ppm Mo. Surprisingly, soil samples collected near the Hi-Mars showings 

did not return strongly anomalous values for Cu or Mo. Another rock sample collected from 



Technical Report – Hi-Mars Property  46 

 

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

a rock pit approximately 250 metres west of the Hi-Mars Minfile locality returned an 

anomalous Cu value of 1,525 ppm (sample 29) but low Mo. 

 

Figure 24. Rock and soil samples collected near the Hi-Mars showing. Proportional symbol sizes 

and numeric values are for Mo (ppm). Map prepared by D.G. MacIntyre from company data, June 

2018. 

9.1.4 Lewis (Minfile No. 092F 366) 

Mineralization at the Lewis showing consists of disseminated and fracture-filling 

chalcopyrite in quartz diorite. The mineralization appears to be spatially and possible 

genetically related to emplacement of a younger elongate intrusion of granodiorite to quartz 

diorite composition (see Figure 9).

Figure 25. Rock and soil samples collected near the Lewis showing. Proportional symbol sizes and 

numeric values are for Cu (ppm). Map prepared by D.G. MacIntyre from company data, June 2018. 

Soil and rock samples collected near the Lewis showing returned anomalous Cu values as 

shown in Figure 25. Soil samples contained up to 2,100 ppm Cu. Rocks samples returned up 

to 5,550 ppm Cu. Mo values were low for both soil and rock samples collected at or near the 

showings (Figure 26). These results are consistent with those reported for previous work 

done in 1976 by the Redonda Syndicate as described in the History Section of this technical 

report.

9.1.5 Spring Lake (Minfile No. 092F 369) 

Mineralization at the Spring Lake showings occurs as disseminated chalcopyrite and pyrite 

occur in siliceous granodiorite. Minor mineralization is also present as fracture coatings.

Soil samples collected over a distance of 350 metres along a logging road east of the Spring 

Lake showing returned anomalous Cu values ranging from 50.3 to 522 ppm (Figure 27). Mo 

values were also weakly to moderately anomalous ranging from 6.7 to 57.6 ppm. Two 

malachite stain rock samples collected from an old exploration pit at the Main showing (Rio 

Tinto Showing "C") returned 5,340 and 1,790 ppm Cu respectively (samples 30 and 31). An 

area of closely spaced rock samples located approximately 500 metres north-northwest of 

the C-showing (Figure 27) and collected from diorite outcrops along an east trending branch 

of the main logging road returned weak to moderately anomalous Cu values with values 

ranging from 374 to 2,160 ppm (samples 13 to 20).

9.1.6 Ho 5 (Minfile No. 092F 371) 

The Ho 5 showing is comprised of molybdenite and chalcopyrite in narrow quartz veins 

hosted by quartz diorite. Soil samples collected at 50 metre intervals along logging roads in 

the vicinity of the Ho 5 Minfile locality returned relatively low Cu and low to weakly 

anomalous Mo values (Figure 29 and 30).  

In 2017 five rocks samples collected along a logging road located approximately 500 metres 

north of the Ho 5 Minfile locality returned anomalous Cu and Mo values (Figures 29 and 

30). A well mineralized grab sample of float or subcrop (sample 39) returned the highest 

value for Cu at 2.81% and for Mo at 1,860 ppm. Other rock samples located north of sample 

39 returned Cu values ranging from 1,300 to 7,710 ppm and Mo values ranging from 674-

1,595 ppm (samples 58-62). Sample 58 and 59 are described as disseminated molybdenite, 



Technical Report – Hi-Mars Property  51 

 

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

chalcopyrite and pyrite in granite float material from the road bed. The source of the road 

bed material is believed to be a borrow pit where similar mineralized material occurs 

(sample 60).  A new showing in outcrop with similar mineralization to the borrow pit 

samples was located further southeast at sample localities 61 and 62 (Figure 29).

Outcrops and subcrops of hornblende quartz diorite with malachite and chalcopyrite 

mineralization were located in an area approximately 500 metres southeast of the Ho 5 

Minfile locality (samples 40-45, Figure 29).  Copper values for the samples collected ranged 

from 1,835 ppm to 1.57% Cu. One sample (sample 42) also returned 391 ppm Mo.

10 Drilling 

Previous drilling on the Hi-Mars Property is described in the History section of this 

technical report. Unfortunately, most of the historical drill hole data is no longer available.  

No recent drilling has been completed on the Property. 

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

All rock and soil samples collected from the Property in 2017 were shipped to ALS Minerals 

laboratory ("ALS") in North Vancouver. ALS is an ISO17025:2005 accredited analytical 

laboratory, which is independent from Straightup.  

All soil sample sites were marked in the field with labelled pink flagging tape. Field notes 

for each sample site were logged and recorded. The locations were determined using a 

handheld GPS. Where possible samples were collected from the B soil horizon. The samples 

were placed in kraft paper bags and stored securely prior to shipping to the ALS. 

The security procedures followed by personnel working on the Property in 2017 are deemed 

to be appropriate for the type of sampling being done. Samples were not left unattended and 

were kept secure in vehicles and hotel rooms until they could be shipped directly to ALS. 

The author is confident that the samples were kept secure and that they were not tampered 

with prior to arriving at the ALS Minerals laboratory.   

Rock samples collected from the Hi-Mars Property in 2017 were placed in labelled plastic 

bags, with a label also placed within the bag and shipped directly to the ALS's laboratory in 

North Vancouver. At the lab, samples are crushed to 70% less than 2 mm in size. A 250 

gram subsample is riffle split off and pulverized to better than 75% passing 75 microns. A 

prepared sample (0.50 g) is digested with aqua regia in a graphite heating block. After 

cooling, the resulting solution is diluted with deionized water, mixed and analyzed by 

inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) for 51 elements (ME 

MS41 package). The upper and lower ranges of values that can be determined by this 

method are given in Table 8. Ore grade samples containing >10,000 ppm Cu were also 

analyzed by ICP-AES to quantify the Cu content to a percentage level (ME-OG46 assay 

procedure). For these, a prepared sample is digested in 75% aqua regia for 120 minutes. 

After cooling the resulting solution is diluted to 100 ml with de-ionized water, mixed and 

analyzed by ICP-AES. The results are reported in percent rather than ppm. The upper limit 

for this method is 20% for Cu. 



Technical Report – Hi-Mars Property  54 

 

LC199372-1 D.G. MacIntyre & Associates Ltd. December 11, 2019 

ALS runs standards and provides re-samples at varying intervals for each sample shipment 

analysed. ALS performs quality assurance procedures that include repeat sampling and 

insertion of blank and/or standard samples for the purpose of data verification.  

The author has reviewed the original analytical certificates issued by ALS for rock samples 

submitted by Rich River in 2017. In the author's opinion, the analytical procedures used to 

determine the concentrations of base and precious metals in the samples submitted were 

appropriate for an early stage exploration program. The quality control employed by ALS 

indicates a high level of precision and accuracy in the analytical results. 

In the author's opinion the sample collection and shipping protocols used by Rich River that 

were observed during the aforementioned Property visit are consistent with current industry 

best practises. These protocols being used ensure that samples collected from the Property 

are kept secure prior to their arrival at the analytical laboratory.

12 Data Verification 

The author visited the Property on November 8, 2017. During this visit rock sample sites at 

the Rio Tinto "C" showing locality and nearby soil sample sites were examined (Photo 2). 

These were clearly marked and appropriately labelled. The rock sample sites were located in 

old pits dating back to the 1970's. The material exposed in the pits was well mineralized 

with visible malachite staining on fracture surfaces. Chalcopyrite and pyrite were observed

in quartz veins and as disseminations. The material being collected at the sample sites that 

were examined was representative of the extent and intensity of mineralization observed at 

each site. The subsequent analytical results for these samples were consistent with the 

intensity of mineralization observed at the sample site. The author also independently took 

GPS readings at each sample site visited as a check on the location accuracy being recorded 

by field personnel. The results were nearly identical. Overall, the density and distribution of 

sample sites were adequate for the purpose of showing the extent and grade of 

mineralization exposed on surface. The analytical results obtained in 2018 were similar to 

those determined by previous operators and, in the author's opinion, these results give an 

accurate indication of the grade of mineralization that occurs in outcrop and subcrop at the 

sampled localities. No independent sampling was done by the author to verify the results 

obtained.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

The author is not aware of any mineral processing or metallurgical testing that has been 

done on mineral samples from the Hi-Mars Property. 

14 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
Estimates 

In the author's opinion, there is not enough available drill hole data to calculate a 

meaningful, NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for the Hi-Mars Property.  

15 Adjacent Properties 

There are no properties adjacent to the Hi-Mars Property. 

16 Other Relevant Data and Information 

The author is not aware of any additional sources of information that might 

significantly change the conclusions presented in this technical report.  

17 Interpretation and Conclusions 

The Hi-Mars Property covers six distinct Minfile mineral occurrences, all of which are 

classified as porphyry Cu-Mo types. Soil and rock sampling in the vicinity of these 

showings in 2017 confirmed the presence of anomalous soils and low to moderate grade Cu 

and Mo mineralization in granitic rocks at these showings, essentially confirming the results 

of previous exploration work on the Property. However, several showings located in 2017 

along some of the more recent logging roads appear to be new. These discoveries have 

expanded the area of interest on the Property and warrant more follow-up work. Although 

soil sampling and prospecting along the network of logging roads on the Property is a cost 

effective tool for exploration, follow up work needs to be done on a more systematic grid 

layout in order to determine the actual extent and shape of soil anomalies and associated 

mineralization. In the author's opinion, the most effective tool for determining the extent of 

subsurface sulphide mineralization is Induced Polarization ("IP") geophysics. This tool is 

typically used where the target is an area of extensive low grade sulphide mineralization 

such as that associated with a porphyry Cu-Mo type deposit.

In the author's opinion the Hi-Mars Property continues to be a property of merit and 

additional exploration expenditures are warranted. Numerous high grade Cu+/-Mo showings 

have been detected on the Property. New logging roads continue to expose new occurrences 

of Cu-Mo mineralization. Following up on the work done in 2017, the author recommends a 

Stage 1 exploration program focussed on additional soil sampling with coincident IP surveys 

in targeted areas. In particular, the extent of anomalous soils located near the Pam 11, Lewis, 

Hi-Mars and Ho 5 showings needs to be determined. A coincident IP survey will help 

determine if there is a correlation with subsurface sulphide mineralization. It is 

recommended that soil sampling/IP grids have line spacing of 100 metres with stations every 

25 metres. Given the density of underbrush in some areas, it may be necessary to cut lines in 

order to facilitate the geochemical and IP surveys. The objective of these surveys is to try to 

determine the extent of subsurface mineralization beyond the current known showings, all of 

which are located in road cuts or quarries along logging roads. Depending on the results of 

the Stage 1 recommended soil/IP surveys, a Stage 2 program would involve additional work 

in the form of targeted diamond drilling. The projected costs for the recommended Stage 1 

and Phase 2 work programs are given in Table 9.
