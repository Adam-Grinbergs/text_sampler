1 SUMMARY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

The Cantung Mine is a primary producer of tungsten concentrate from underground 

mine operations.  It was opened in 1962 and operated fairly continuously until it was 

shutdown in 1986 for 15 years due to low tungsten prices, reopening in 2001. A short 

term closure from late 2003 to mid-2005 also took place. Recent strong tungsten prices 

allowed NATCL to re-open the mine in September 2005.  Currently, the major features 

and facilities associated with Cantung are as follows: 

• The Cantung deposits, consisting of the Open Pit resource near surface, and 
the E Zone reserve, underground. 

 
• The physical plant site including an underground mine, a small open pit, 

process plant, diesel power plant, workshops, warehouses, administration 
buildings, a town site and single status accommodation, and an airstrip. 

 
• Waste rock dumps and a tailings storage facility. 

 

  The cash flow estimate in this report is based on September 30, 2008 Mineral 

Reserves, summarized in Table 1-1. 

 

The purpose of this report is to update the annual reserves and resources for the 

Cantung Mine.

  Notes: 
1. Mineral Reserves conform to CIM and NI43-101 requirements. 
2. All Mineral Reserves are classified as Probable. 
3. Mineral Reserves are estimated at a cutoff grade of 0.80% WO3..  
4. A minimum mining width of 15 feet was used. 

 

The Cantung Mine produces ore at a rate of 1,100 stpd.  Mineral Reserves support a 

mine life of 1.6 years, ending in Q2 2010.  Primary mining methods included, cut and fill 

and longhole stoping with and without delayed backfill, and pillar-remnant ore recovery 

using different techniques.  Currently, longhole methods are planned for the majority of 

the remaining reserves, both for pillar recovery and for primary mining in areas with 

favourable geometry. 

 

Processing is carried out by gravity and flotation circuits.  Final products include a 

premium gravity concentrate (G1), containing 65% WO3 and a flotation concentrate 

containing 47% WO3.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

The Cantung Mine is positioned to take advantage of recent high prices for tungsten.  

The Mine has the advantages of considerable operating history, low capital requirements, 

and established contacts with suppliers and customers.  The Mine has operated 

successfully in the past, however, it should be noted that it is a relatively high cost 

producer, and has experienced previous shutdowns during periods of low tungsten prices.  

In NATCL's opinion, the key risk to mine profitability lies in tungsten price 

sustainability and mined grades over the remaining mine life. 

 

Given the forecast continued demand for tungsten metal, and price forecasts, NATCL 

is of the opinion that the base case G1 price scenario of US$205/MTU is reasonable for 

the entire life of mine.  At prices below current levels, the Mine generates positive cash 

flow, so there is some margin to allow for negative changes in the mine plan and cost 

estimates.   

 

When production is taken into account, Mineral Reserves have increased since the 

previous reserve estimate in 2007.  Increases are due to exploration of new zones, 

inclusion of lower-grade areas rendered economic by higher prices, and planned pillar 

recovery in previously mined areas through the use of longhole mining methods.   

 

There are Mineral Resources in the Open Pit/PUG Zone that could potentially be 

mined.  Past open pit and PUG designs proposed production in the order of more than one 

year of mill feed. 

 

As long as development and stope preparation continues in a timely manner, longhole 

mining should provide steady production at a lower cost than cut and fill mining.  

Longhole pillar mining carries a risk of lower grades from higher dilution; however, life 

of mine plan production estimates carry a reasonable and appropriate allowance for 

expected dilution.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

The Pre-Tax Cash Flow Projection shown in Table 1-2 has been generated from the 

life of mine physicals, and capital and operating cost data.  The Cash Flow starts in 

October 2008 (the Mineral Reserve estimation date), and is organized by NATC's fiscal 

year, which runs from October to September.  A summary of the key criteria is provided 

below. 

 

ECONOMIC CRITERIA 
PHYSICALS 

• Mine life:   1.6 years 

• Total mill feed:  655,706 tons at a grade of 1.10% WO3 

• Operations 365 days per year 

• Mill throughput of 1,100 tons per day from underground, or approximately 

400,000 tons per year. 

• Metallurgy as per mill performance: 

o Tungsten recovery 76.4% 

o Gravity concentrate (G1) 

 Grade 65% 

 Distribution 75% 

 Recovery relative to mill feed 60.3% 

o Flotation concentrate

CASH FLOW MODEL 
Considering the Project on a stand-alone basis, the undiscounted pre-tax cash flow 

totals CDN$9.2 million over the mine life.  As an operating mine without significant 

capital requirements, cash flow is anticipated to be positive over the course of the mine 

life. 

The site Unit Cost of Production is CDN$187 per MTU of WO3.  Net Present Value 

(NPV) at a 6% discount rate is $8.4 million.  A low discount rate is appropriate due to the 

short mine life, and lower risk associated with an operating mine.  This is a 2008 constant 

dollar model and, as mine life is relatively short (1.6 years), introduction of 

inflation/deflation criteria to the model will make little difference to NPV figures.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY 

The Cantung Mine is located in the Nahanni area of western Northwest Territories, 

Canada, approximately 300 km by road northeast of Watson Lake, Yukon, close to the 

Yukon border.  The mine is a primary producer of tungsten concentrate from open pit and 

underground mines.  It was opened in 1962.   

 

Cantung is located in the rugged mountain wilderness of the Selwyn Mountains, 

where severe winter conditions prevail from October to May, with temperatures as low as 

-40°C and substantial snowfall.  Local terrain is characterized by steep mountains and 

narrow valley bottoms.  There are a number of avalanche slide paths in the area, and 

avalanche monitoring and control is an ongoing requirement in the winter.

INFRASTRUCTURE 
Existing underground and surface infrastructure at the property includes the 

following: 

• Underground workings of a total strike length of 5,000 ft, with a main haulage 
drift at the 3,950 ft level and a number of ramps at different levels. 

 
• An open pit located south of the main underground orebody, at the 4900 level. 

 
• An underground maintenance shop comprising large service bays and 

warehouse facilities, equipped with overhead cranes. 
 

• Primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing plants equipped with rod and ball 
mills, plus gravity and flotation equipment  

 
• A mill building with offices and a maintenance shop. 

 
• An analytical lab fitted with a Leco sulphur analyzer, colorimetric 

spectrophotometer, and AA analyzers. 
 

• Concentrate storage facilities. 
 

• Tailings ponds and a polishing pond. 
 

• A backfill plant. 
 

• A warehouse for reagents and other supplies. 
 

• A pumping station. 
 

• Two diesel fuel tanks, each of a capacity of 360,000 litres. 
 

The water supply is provided from the Flat River and is restricted to 45,000 m3 per 

week in accordance with the Water Licence. 

 

The power supply is provided by a powerhouse equipped with diesel generators of a 

total capacity of 5.3 MW.  

 

The original operators of the Cantung mine built and maintained a town at the mine 

site, known as Tungsten, complete with all necessary facilities.  Currently, only a portion 

of the existing town site is in use.  Employees are accommodated in an 80-person 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.

apartment complex, in town house units and in staff rooms above the main office.  The 

site can accommodate up to 140 people at a time. 

 

GEOLOGY 
Southeastern Yukon and southwestern Northwest Territories are underlain by a thick 

sequence of late Precambrian and lower Paleozoic sedimentary strata, which are intruded 

by several Cretaceous granitic plutons.  Basement rocks comprise upwards of 3,000 m of 

fine-grained Proterozoic clastic sediments, predominantly slate and phyllite, referred to as 

the Grit Unit.  In the mine workings, the lowest stratigraphic unit exposed is argillite of 

the Proterozoic Grit Unit, referred to as the Older or Lower Argillite.  The overlying 

Swiss Cheese Limestone, or Chert Unit as it is referred to at the mine, is in the order of 

40 m to 50 m thick.  The Ore Limestone is approximately 30 m thick in the Open Pit, 

thickening to approximately 100 m in the underground E Zone.  The stratigraphically 

overlying argillite and interbanded quartzite, which averages approximately 150 m in 

thickness, is referred to at the mine as the Younger or Upper Argillite.  At the top of the 

local stratigraphic sequence is a light buff dolomite with interbedded quartzite, which has 

a maximum thickness of approximately 600 m, however, this is not seen in the mine 

workings. 

 

The Open Pit and E Zone orebodies lie on the west limb of the Flat River Syncline.  

This limb is steeply dipping and overturned in the west, but becomes flat to the east, 

where in the area around the two mined deposits it forms a recumbent anticlinal fold that 

trends east to west.  The Open Pit lies on the flat lying upper limb of this fold and the E 

Zone on the lower limb. 

 

Two of the deposits at Cantung have been mined.  These are the original Open Pit 

orebody, which was mined from 1962 to 1973, and the E Zone, which was mined 

between 1973 and 1986, again between January 2002 and December 2003, and is 

currently in production.  Both deposits are in calc-silicate skarn zones that replace the Ore 

Limestone.   



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 1-11

Mineralization at the Cantung mine comprises skarn replacements within the Ore 

Limestone.  At the Open Pit, mineralization is also present as lower grade replacements 

in the underlying Chert Unit.  The Open Pit skarn ore is comprised of scheelite and minor 

chalcopyrite disseminated in a gangue of pyrrhotite, diopside, garnet, and actinolite.  The 

E Zone ore differs in several respects from Open Pit ore.  It typically contains massive to 

semi-massive pyrrhotite and, in addition to pyroxene and garnet, contains abundant 

hydrated calc-silicates actinolite and biotite.   

 

EXPLORATION 
 The mine property has been covered almost completely by ground and airborne 

magnetic and electromagnetic surveys, and by geochemical stream sediment and soil 

sampling. No obvious targets were discovered by these surveys, with the exception of the 

geochemical anomalies in the upper reaches of Rifle Range Creek. The other targets 

listed below are of a geological nature and are mainly suggested by earlier geological 

mapping or diamond drilling. Up to 2007 Exploration work has been limited to a few 

holes in the Open Pit/PUG Zone since the mine ceased production in 1986. A diamond 

drill program was reinitiated in mid 2007 including some surface drilling (one hole on 

Sheet Mountain), drilling in the PUG but primarily in the west extension, e-zone and the 

area below 3700 elevation.  

 During fiscal 2008 almost 50,000 ft (15,000 meters) of both exploration and 

definition diamond drilling was undertaken. Approximately 10,000 ft of definition 

drilling was included in the above total. Drilling focused on the area below 3700 (the area 

below the lowest mine workings). In addition in the later part of the fiscal year drilling 

above 3700 (but from 3700 level) confirmed the presence of mineralization above the 

level and to the west of current workings. 

 The mineralization conforms to that of the currently mined areas. Specifically the 

majority of the mineralization is limited to the ore limestone with minor intersections in 

the "swiss cheese" limestone. The other area investigated was the central flats.  

The diamond drilling was undertaken by Boart Longyear utilizing either an LM37 or 

LM75 diamond drill. All core was BQTK size or larger. 

 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 1-12

 The diamond drillhole database for the Cantung mine property, which is complete 

except for the drilling done on the Baker showing, comprises 1,740 (an additional 362 

diamond drill holes since 2006) drill holes. The drillholes are concentrated around the 

known deposits, mainly those that have been mined - the open pit and E Zone. Outside of 

these areas of exploration, diamond drilling is sparse or non-existent. 

 The following exploration targets have been identified. Those targets in and close 

to the E Zone underground workings that could be accessed and put into production most 

quickly are given the highest priority, as they are the most likely to extend the current 

mine life.  

Target 1:  West of the Western extension 

Target 2:  Eastern Extension  

Target 3:  Central Flats 

Target 4:  109 West Lift #8 

Target 5: East Extension Target 6: Name: Sheet Mountain 

Target 7: Shop to PUG Zone 

Target 8:  Dolomite Target 

Target 9:  Sheet Mountain 

Target 10:  Baker Prospect 

 

 In addition there is a high degree of probability that tonnage can be found by 

"data mining". In 2008, 26% of tonnage to the mill came from areas outside of reserves.  

Recent modeling has at least temporarily removed many sub-grade or areas of poor 

confidence level (due to ground conditions and/or mined out openings) from reserves. It 

is anticipated that at least some of these areas will be put back in resource/reserve over 

the next year.

NATCL notes that some mining zone nomenclature may cause confusion for those 

unfamiliar with the Cantung deposits.  The E-Zone refers both to the entire underground 

orebody, and also to the few remaining stopes that do not fit into a subzone category such 

as Main, South Flats, or West Extension.   

 

MINING OPERATIONS 
In the past, the mine used a variety of mining methods including room and pillar, cut 

and fill, longhole stoping with and without delayed backfill, and pillar-remnant ore 

recovery using different techniques.   

 

Currently, longhole methods are used for the majority of the remaining reserves, both 

for pillar recovery and for primary mining in areas with favourable geometry.  Access 

drifts are driven under the old workings, providing drill locations for upholes into 

remnant pillars above.  The drill patterns form a draw cone from the access up to the base 

of the ore – this waste is mucked first after blasting, and discarded.  In some cases, the 

pillars are surrounded by unconsolidated waste fill from previous cut and fill mining, and 

higher levels of dilution are expected as a result.  In other cases, the pillars are 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 1-15

surrounded by void space, and extraction is expected to be lower, as some ore will be 

blasted outwards into the old workings and will not be recovered.  Cut and fill methods 

are planned for areas with narrower ore widths, such as the West Extension, and for a few 

primary stopes in other areas.  Mining widths for cut and fill are expected to be 

approximately 15 ft.  Waste rock will be used as backfill for the working areas.  There are 

areas in the old workings where pillars have failed and the hangingwall has deteriorated.  

The area of pillar failure is expected to expand as pillar mining progresses, however, no 

threats to active areas are anticipated.   

 

The Cantung Mine workings extend vertically from 3700 up to the 4350 level and 

cover a strike length of approximately 5,000 ft.  In order of size, the key underground 

mining reserve areas are:  

• Main Zone (Pillar Recovery) 

• West Extension 

• West Extension (below 3700) 

• South Flats Pillar Zone 

• E-Zone (Primary Mining) 

• Shop Zone 

 

MINERAL PROCESSING 
The mill processing facilities at Cantung comprise primary crushing and coarse ore 

storage installations, secondary and tertiary crushing, fine ore storage, a general gravity 

and flotation building with offices and a maintenance shop, backfill preparation building 

(inactive), reagents, supplies storage building, and an assay lab.  Although the mill was 

designed to process 1,000 tons per day, it has achieved continuous processing rates of up 

to 1,200 tons per day.  The Life of Mine Plan (LOMP) details an average processing 

tonnage of 1,100 tons per day at a recovery rate of 76% of WO3.  Final products include a 

premium gravity concentrate (G1) and a flotation concentrate.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
   The Cantung Mine is in compliance with applicable regulations. The following is 

a summary from the 2007 report, with updated information: 

 

PERMITS 
 On December 5, 2003 NATC received notification from the Mackenzie Valley 

Land and Water Board (MVLWB) of the renewal of the type "A" Water License (the 

license) for a period of five years, expiring on November 29, 2008. The Water Licence 

outlines the permitted water use and includes a surveillance program and criteria for 

discharge. There are also a number of conditions related to the operation. The water 

license was extended by 60 days to January 28, 2009 as outlined below. 

 

 In July 2007, NATCL applied to the MVLWB for a 5 year renewal to the license. 

The renewal process is a public process involving public consultation, comment review 

and public hearings. The original public hearings scheduled for July 23-25, 2008 were 

postponed by the MVLWB at the request of the hosting communities due to personal 

tragedies in both small communities. Due to this delay NATCL was requested to apply to 

the MVLWB for a 60 day license extension, which was approved by the Minister of 

Indian and Northern Affairs (INAC) on September 8, 2008. 

 
 The public hearings for the five year license renewal are rescheduled for October 

28-30, 2008, with the new proposed license to be forwarded December 9, 2008 by the 

MVLWB to the Minister of INAC for his approval. 

 

 The original security deposit required under the prior license was $900,000 

(which was and is posted in support of the license). The renewed license requires that 

NATCL post an additional security deposit of $7,000,000 over time (see Mine Closure, 

below).  NATC negotiated the terms of the form of security deposit with INAC, which 

has jurisdiction over such an arrangement and to whose benefit the deposits are to be 

posted, and entered into the Reclamation Security Agreement (RSA) effective May 31, 

2005.  NATCL has posted a total of $3,700,000 in cash and $4,200,000 in the required 

form of secured promissory note pursuant to the RSA. The total security posted in favour 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 1-17

of INAC is $7,900,000 which fulfills the security requirements of the Water License up 

to November 29, 2008. The amounts owing are secured against NATCL's assets by way 

of a General Security Agreement (GSA).  

 

The RSA provides for the cash components payable to INAC to increase under 

certain events.  Any funds in excess of ultimate reclamation costs will be returned to 

NATCL.  

 
CAPITAL COSTS 

The total capital costs for the 2009 Fiscal Year are estimated to be $5.6 million.  

Closure costs, and salvage value were not included in capital costs.

MARKETS/CONTRACTS 
NATCL sells the G1 product at prices based on free market values for ammonium 

paratungstate (APT).  Flotation concentrate is toll converted to APT.  Concentrates may 

be blended in various configurations to maximize revenue.  Customers for the Cantung 

products include North American, European, and Chinese APT and W powder producers. 

 

NATCL's competitors are the tungsten producers within China, the Beralt mine in 

Portugal, and, on a smaller scale, producers within Russia, Africa, South America, 

Thailand, and Vietnam.  Although China is unable to export concentrate, NATCL must 

compete against Chinese mines to supply to APT producers within China.  

 
PRICING 

November 2008 London Metal Bulletin (LMB) European free market price quotation 

for APT is approximately US$252 per MTU.  Before 2005, prices were fairly consistent 

in the range of US$40 to US$90 per MTU, with a median of approximately US$60 per 

MTU.

4 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
ACCESSIBILITY 

The Cantung Mine is located approximately 300 km by road northeast of Watson 

Lake, Yukon.  Although the mine is situated in the Northwest Territories, Watson Lake is 

the staging area for trucking the tungsten concentrates and for supplying the mine site 

(Figure 4-1). 

 

Access to the mine from Watson Lake is via Highway 4 (Campbell Highway) and 

then Highway 10 (Nahanni Range Road).  Additionally, the mine operates a 1,219 m long 

VFR-rated gravel airstrip.  The airstrip is maintained for year-round operations. 

 

CLIMATE 
Cantung is located in the Selwyn Mountains, and climatic conditions vary with 

elevation.  The mean annual temperature for major valley systems is approximately -

4.5°C, with a summer mean of 9.5°C and a winter mean of -19.5°C.  Mean annual 

precipitation is highly variable, ranging from 600 mm at lower elevation on the perimeter 

of the Selwyn Mountains region up to 750 mm at high elevation.  Locally at Cantung, 

severe winter conditions prevail from October to May with temperatures as low as -40°C 

and substantial snowfall.  Total annual precipitation locally is 650 mm, half as rain and 

half as snow, with an average 1,270 mm snow accumulation in the valley. 

 

PHYSIOGRAPHY  
Cantung is located in the Selwyn Mountains Ecoregion of the Taiga Cordillera 

Ecozone.  This ecoregion is located in the Selwyn and southern Mackenzie mountains 

that span the Yukon-Northwest Territories border.  For the most part, this is a rugged 

mountain wilderness, a northern extension of the Rocky Mountains.  The mine site lies in 

the Flat River Valley, within the Selwyn Mountain Range.  Local terrain is characterized 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 4-2

by steep mountains and narrow valley bottoms.  Elevations vary from 1,130 mASL at the 

bottom of the Flat River valley to elevations of 2,750 mASL on nearby mountain peaks.  

There are a number of avalanche slide paths in the area, and avalanche monitoring and 

control is an ongoing requirement in the winter.  The Flat River is a tributary of the South 

Nahanni River, which ultimately drains into the Liard and Mackenzie Rivers. 

 

The ecoregion is characterized by alpine tundra at upper elevations and by subalpine 

open woodland vegetation at lower elevations.  Alpine vegetation consists of crustose 

lichens, mountain avens, dwarf willow, and ericaceous shrubs; sedge and cottongrass are 

associated with wetter sites.  Barren talus slopes are common.  Subalpine vegetation 

consists of discontinuous open stands of stunted white spruce, and occasional alpine fir 

and lodgepole pine, in a matrix of willow, dwarf birch, and northern Labrador tea with a 

ground cover of moss and lichen.  

 

Local alpine glaciers exist in the highest ranges of this ecoregion.  Bare rock outcrops 

and rubble are common at higher elevation.  Permafrost is extensive but discontinuous in 

the western part and continuous, with low ice content, in the eastern part of the ecoregion.  

 

Characteristic wildlife includes caribou, grizzly and black bear, Dall's sheep, moose, 

beaver, fox, wolf, hare, raven, rock and willow ptarmigan, and bald and golden eagle.  

 

LOCAL RESOURCES 
Climate and resources provide opportunities for hunting and trapping of wildlife, 

ecotourism, and mineral exploration.  There are no major permanent settlements in the 

ecoregion.

INFRASTRUCTURE 
Existing underground and surface infrastructure at the property, shown in Figure 5-1, 

include the following: 

• Underground workings of a total strike length of 5,000 ft, with a main haulage 
drift at the 3,950 ft level and a number of ramps at different levels. 

 
• An open pit located south of the main underground orebody, at the 4900 level. 

 
• An underground maintenance shop comprising large service bays and 

warehouse facilities, equipped with overhead cranes. 
 

• Primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing plants equipped with rod and ball 
mills, plus gravity and flotation circuits. 

 
• A mill building with offices and a maintenance shop. 

 
• An analytical lab fitted with a Leco sulphur analyzer, colorimetric 

spectrophotometer, and AA analyzers. 
 

• Concentrate storage facilities. 
 

• Tailings ponds and a polishing pond. 
 

• A backfill plant. 
 

• A warehouse for reagents and other supplies. 
 

• A pumping station. 
 

• Two diesel fuel tanks, each of a capacity of 360,000 litres. 
 

The water supply is provided from the Flat River and is restricted to 45,000 m3 per 

week in accordance with the Water Licence. 

The power supply is provided by a powerhouse equipped with diesel generators of a 

total capacity of 5.3 MW.  

The original operators of the Cantung mine built and maintained a town at the mine 

site, known as Tungsten, complete with all necessary facilities.  Currently, only a portion 

of the existing town site is in use.  Employees are accommodated in an 80-person 

apartment complex, in town house units, and in staff rooms above the main office.  The 

site can accommodate up to 140 people at a time.

5 HISTORY 
Prospectors discovered the Cantung Mine tungsten deposit in 1954, while looking for 

copper.  In 1959, the Canada Tungsten Mining Corporation Ltd. was formed to acquire 

and develop the property.  The Cantung Mine commenced production in 1962 from an 

open pit at the rate of 300 tons per day (stpd), with suspensions in 1963 due to low 

tungsten prices and in 1966 due to the destruction of the mill by fire.  The construction of 

a new 350 stpd mill was completed in 1967 and, in 1969, the capacity was increased to 

450 stpd.   

 

In 1971, deep drilling discovered the "E Zone".  This zone was accessed through an 

adit collared at the valley bottom, close to the town site.  The mill began to process the 

underground ore in 1974.  In 1975, the mill was further expanded to 500 stpd.  A major 

mill expansion in 1979 increased the mill capacity to 1,000 stpd.  In 1986, the mine 

ceased operations due to low tungsten prices.  

 

In 1985, Amax Inc consolidated ownership of the Cantung Mine and transferred all 

tungsten assets, including the Mactung Project at Macmillan Pass, to Canada Tungsten 

Mining Corporation, retaining majority control.  Aur Resources Inc. (Aur) purchased 

Amax Inc's controlling interest in 1995 and Canada Tungsten and Aur merged in 1996. 

 

In 1997, NATCL purchased the Cantung mine, together with the related tungsten 

assets of the former Canada Tungsten Inc., from Aur. 

 

After an improvement in tungsten prices commencing in 2000, NATCL reopened the 

Cantung mine in December 2001.  Underground production and milling resumed at this 

time.  In December 2003, NATCL was placed under the protection of the Companies 

Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), and the mine was closed.  In November 2004, 

NATCL successfully completed a plan of arrangement to deal with creditors, allowing 

planning for reopening to commence.  Preparatory work for the reopening began in July 

2005, and production resumed in late September 2005.

6 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

Southeastern Yukon and southwestern Northwest Territories are underlain by a thick 

sequence of late Precambrian and lower Paleozoic sedimentary strata, which are intruded 

by several Cretaceous granitic plutons (Figure 6-1). 

 

Basement rocks comprise upwards of 3,000 m of fine-grained Proterozoic clastic 

sediments, predominantly slate and phyllite, referred to as the Grit Unit.  At the onset of 

the Cambrian, a thin layer of calcareous siltstone, the Swiss Cheese Limestone Unit, 

which contains distinctive limestone nodules, was deposited over the region.  After this, 

the region was divided into two contrasting environments of sedimentation, the boundary 

of which was more-or-less the present Flat River valley.  A thick, uniform, sequence of 

shale beds developed in the Selwyn Basin southwest of Flat River, while extensive 

shallow water quartzites and carbonate predominated to the northeast, in the northern 

Cordilleran miogeosyncline.  The strandline between basin and shelf shifted repeatedly 

over time from northeast to southwest and back. 

 

The stratigraphic unit of principal interest, the Ore Limestone, directly overlies the 

Swiss Cheese Limestone.  It is a clean blue grey limestone and the lowest pure limestone 

in the geological succession.  Its distribution is restricted to an area of three kilometres by 

12 km in the immediate mine area (Figure 6-1).  A shale unit that caps the Ore Limestone 

in the Flat River valley area thickens to the southeast of the mine.  The shales are overlain 

by light buff dolomite, which is of regional extent.  Fossil evidence dates all these units 

as Lower Cambrian.  A wavy Banded Limestone, or Rabbitkettle Formation, of Middle to 

Upper Cambrian age overlies the Lower Cambrian sequence and forms a distinctive 

regional marker. 

 

Granitic stocks of Cretaceous age intrude all strata and regional structures.  They are of 

similar composition: medium-grained biotite quartz monzonite, locally with prominent 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 6-2

plagioclase and potash feldspar phenocrysts.  The stocks occur mainly in a northwest-

trending zone approximately 10 km wide that coincides with the Flat River valley. 

 

The dominant regional structure in the area is a major northwest-trending synclinal 

fold, the Flat River Syncline, which is roughly five kilometres wide and has an axis close 

to the river.

Local and Property Geology 
In the mine workings, the lowest stratigraphic unit exposed is argillite of the 

Proterozoic Grit Unit, referred to as the Older or Lower Argillite (Figure 6-2).  It has an 

undefined thickness.  The overlying Swiss Cheese Limestone, or Chert Unit as it is 

referred to at the mine, is in the order of 40 m to 50 m thick.  The Ore Limestone is 

approximately 30 m thick in the Open Pit, thickening to approximately 100 m in the 

underground E Zone.  The stratigraphically overlying argillite and interbanded quartzite, 

which averages approximately 150 m in thickness, is referred to at the mine as the 

Younger or Upper Argillite.  At the top of the local stratigraphic sequence is a light buff 

dolomite with interbedded quartzite, which has a maximum thickness of approximately 

600 m, however, this is not seen in the mine workings. 

 

The two principal intrusive stocks exposed in the mine area are the Mine Stock, 

which outcrops near the Tungsten townsite, and the Circular Stock, which is 

approximately 500 m north of the E Zone.  A third intrusion occurs at depth below the 

Open Pit and E Zone orebodies, however, its age and relationship to the other two stocks 

is not clear.  Dykes and other small apophyses of this blind stock cut the overlying strata. 

 

The Open Pit and E Zone orebodies lie on the west limb of the Flat River Syncline.  

This limb is steeply dipping and overturned in the west, but becomes flat to the east, 

where in the area around the two mined deposits it forms a recumbent anticlinal fold that 

trends east to west (Figure 6-3).  The Open Pit lies on the flat lying upper limb of this 

fold and the E Zone on the lower limb, close to where the sedimentary succession is cut 

off by the Mine Stock.  The pit is associated with a late acidic dyke.  The mine anticline 

appears to be of local extent, as it has not been identified outside the immediate area of 

the two mined deposits.  Steeply dipping, northeasterly-trending late stage faults with 

limited displacement cut all the rocks in the mine area. 

 

Two of the deposits at Cantung have been mined.  These are the original Open Pit 

orebody, which was mined from 1962 to 1973, and the E Zone, which was mined 

between 1973 and 1986, again between January 2002 and December 2003, and is 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 6-5

currently in production.  Both deposits are in calc-silicate skarn zones that replace the Ore 

Limestone.  The only tungsten mineral in the ore zones is scheelite, calcium tungstate 

(CaWO4), which is recovered in either a gravity or flotation concentrate by the processing 

plant.  At one time, the copper mineral chalcopyrite was recovered from the ore by 

flotation.  NAT is currently re-installing a copper circuit. Testwork indicates a potentially 

saleable and profitable product. 

 

The Open Pit orebody, located in the valley of Sardine Creek, was roughly circular 

and approximately 150 m in diameter (Figure 6-2).  The current open pit resources are 

mainly in the Chert that forms the bottom of the existing pit.  In addition, a low grade 

geological resource, also within the Chert Unit, extends from the pit wall for a distance of 

250 m to the north.  The E Zone orebody measures 1,200 m in length, and has an average 

thickness of 12 m and slope length of 150 m.  The south side of the ore body is close to 

flat lying.  Further north, the Ore Limestone thickens and becomes vertical, so that at the 

axis of the recumbent mine anticline the ore occurs in vertical or sub-vertical lenses.  The 

ore pinches out above this fold axis mainly because of increasing distance from the 

intrusive.  In a down dip direction the Ore Limestone, the skarn, and the ore 

mineralization pinch out against quartz monzonite of the mine stock.  Throughout most of 

the deposit two, main ore lenses are present: a hanging wall lens adjacent to Chert Unit, 

and a footwall lens adjacent to Upper Argillite.  Intermediate lenses also occur, however, 

they tend to be less continuous than either the hanging wall or the footwall lenses (Figure 

6-3).

7 DEPOSIT TYPES 
The Cantung Mine consists of two deposits, the Open Pit, near surface, and the E 

Zone, underground.  The deposits are described in the following section, Mineralization.

8 MINERALIZATION 
The description below is largely taken from the reports of Blusson (1968) and 

Hodgson (2003). 

 

Mineralization at the Cantung mine comprises skarn replacements within the Ore 

Limestone.  At the Open Pit, mineralization is also present as lower grade replacements 

in the underlying Chert Unit.  The Open Pit skarn ore is comprised of scheelite and minor 

chalcopyrite disseminated in a gangue of pyrrhotite, diopside, garnet, and actinolite.  The 

E Zone ore differs in several respects from Open Pit ore.  It typically contains massive to 

semi-massive pyrrhotite and, in addition to pyroxene and garnet, contains abundant 

hydrated calc-silicates actinolite and biotite.  The hydrated silicates are particularly 

characteristic of the West Extension.  The scheelite content of the skarn-hosted 

mineralization in the two orebodies was similar (1.64% WO3 at the Open Pit versus 

1.54% WO3 average to 1986 at the E Zone).  Copper content in the open pit ore averaged 

0.5%, and in the E Zone approximately 0.25% Cu.  Accessory minerals in the E Zone 

include apatite, epidote, and tourmaline.

9 EXPLORATION 
The mine property has been covered almost completely by ground and airborne 

magnetic and electromagnetic surveys, and by geochemical stream sediment and soil 

sampling. No obvious targets were discovered by these surveys, with the exception of the 

geochemical anomalies in the upper reaches of Rifle Range Creek. The other targets 

listed below are of a geological nature and are mainly suggested by earlier geological 

mapping or diamond drilling. Up to 2007 Exploration work has been limited to a few 

holes in the Open Pit/PUG Zone since the mine ceased production in 1986. A diamond 

drill program was reinitiated in mid 2007 including some surface drilling (one hole on 

Sheet Mountain), drilling in the PUG but primarily in the west extension, e-zone and the 

area below 3700 elevation.  

During fiscal 2008 almost 50,000 ft (15,000 meters) of both exploration and 

definition diamond drilling was undertaken. This translated into 250 diamond drill holes 

with an average depth of 200 but ranged from a low of 18 feet to a high of 917 feet. Most 

of the remaining pillars were drilled to confirm both tonnage and grade. Approximately 

10,000 ft of definition diamond drilling  occurred with the remainder being  exploration 

drilling. Drilling focused on the area below 3700 (the area below the lowest mine 

workings). This resulted in 231,000 being added to the indicated mineral resource. The 

drilling was initially on 100 ft spacing with subsequent infill drilling.  Drilling indicates 

an southern offset in the ore in the area of 3700 (caused by granite intrusion). Diamond 

drilling has also confirmed ore grade mineralization to the 3430 level. In addition in the 

later part of the fiscal year drilling above 3700 (but from 3700 level) confirmed the 

presence of mineralization above the level and to the west of current workings. The 

diamond drilling was undertaken by Boart Longyear utilizing either an LM37 or LM75 

diamond drill. All core was BQTK size. 

 The mineralization conforms to that of the currently mined areas. Specifically the 

majority of the mineralization is limited to the ore limestone with minor intersections in 

the "swiss cheese" limestone. The other area investigated was the central flats. Drill 

targets were identified, an old exploration drift reactivated and the area was modeled

using Minesight software. This contributed 160,000 tons to the indicated mineral 

resource. 

 

 The diamond drillhole database for the Cantung mine property, which is complete 

except for the drilling done on the Baker showing, comprises 1,740 drill holes (an 

additional 362 diamond drill holes since 2006). The drillholes are concentrated around 

the known deposits, mainly those that have been mined - the open pit and E Zone. 

Outside of these areas of exploration, diamond drilling is sparse or non-existent. The 

following exploration targets were identified. Those targets in and close to the E Zone 

underground workings that could be accessed and put into production most quickly are 

given the highest priority, as they are the most likely to extend the current mine life.

 In addition there is a high degree of probability that tonnage can be found by 

"data mining". In 2008, 26% of tonnage to the mill came from areas outside of reserves.  

Recent modeling has at least temporarily removed many sub-grade or areas of poor 

confidence level (due to ground conditions and/or mined out openings) from reserves. It 

is anticipated that at least some of these areas will be put back in resource/reserve over 

the next year.

10 DRILLING 
Mineral resources and reserves at the E Zone are based almost entirely upon 

diamond drill core assay data from holes drilled in the mine area by Canada Tungsten 

Mining Corporation between 1958 and 1986. The current open pit reserves and resources 

rely mainly on the surface diamond drilling and the underground reserves on 

underground diamond drilling. The resource BELOW 3700 is based on drilling 

undertaken in late 2007 and 2008. Scott Wilson RPA reviewed copies of the diamond 

drill hole logs prior to 2007 and noted that core recovery was normally at or near 100% 

and the core condition was reasonably good Drill core was placed in wooden boxes and 

logged. Mineralized sections of core were split parallel to the core axis using a hydraulic 

splitter. After splitting, one half of the core was submitted for assay, while the other half 

was stored in core racks at the mine. Sample lengths varied up to ten feet; however, five 

foot samples are most common 

 Mineral resources and reserves for the area below 3700 are based almost entirely 

upon diamond drill core assay data from holes drilled in the mine area by North 

American Tungsten Corporation in 2007 and 2008. Core recovery was normally at or 

near 100% and the core condition was good. Drill core was placed in wooden boxes and 

logged. Mineralized sections of core were cut sub parallel to the core axis using a 

diamond saw. After splitting, one half of the core was submitted for assay, while the 

other half was stored in pallets at the mine. Sample lengths varied up to six feet although 

department standards called for a maximum of 5 ft or at lithology or grade changes. 

Rejects and pulps are saved.

11 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
Most drill core samples from the E Zone were assayed at Rossbacher 

Laboratories, Burnaby, B.C., utilizing hot hydrochloric acid digestion followed by 

colorimetric finish. The method of sample preparation and analysis was designed by 

Amax Inc. for application at its Climax, Colorado mine. Rossbacher used a set of 

standard samples developed by Amax. Check assays were carried out at Chemex 

Laboratories Ltd., and Bondar-Clegg Ltd., both in North Vancouver, B.C. Between 1984 

and 1986, samples were assayed at the Cantung mine laboratory using X-ray analysis. 

 

 During 2002/2003 operations all mine and mill assays were performed at the 

Cantung mine laboratory using hot three-acid digestion (HCl, H3PO4, HF) and 

colorimetric finish. All reagents used were certified reagent grade chemicals, used in 

conjunction with laboratory-produced distilled water. To each assay run of 12 samples, 

one standard and one blank sample were attached. The standard used was Canadian 

Certified Standards sample CT1, at 1.311% WO3, which originated at the Cantung mine 

many years ago. The blank samples test for constant error and error due to contamination 

from reagents and glassware that is used in the process. Each laboratory sample run also 

included one duplicate sample and one in-house mill feed standard to maintain statistical 

control records. The grade of latter was confirmed at 1.47% WO3 in over 100 separate 

assays.  

 Check assays were performed from time to time at the ALS Chemex laboratory, 

North Vancouver, BC, which is ISO 9000 certified. Assays on concentrates were 

performed at the mine assay laboratory by gravimetric method, involving digestion in hot 

hydrochloric and nitric acid followed by gravimetric finish. Umpire and check assays on 

concentrates were performed at Alfred H. Knight laboratory, Spartanburg, South 

Carolina. No special assay security provisions were taken at the mine, as none were 

deemed necessary.  

All exploration diamond drill core samples were assayed on site utilizing hot 

hydrochloric acid digestion followed by colorimetric finish. Assays greater than 1%WO3 

were sent to Global Discovery Labs for verification and as part of a QAQC program. In

13 DATA VERIFICATION 
Archival drillhole assay data were corroborated through reconciliation of average 

diluted recoverable reserves grade against the mine average production mucking grade 

for the period from February 2002 until September 30, 2003.  The average production 

mucking grade for this period was reportedly 1.72% WO3 and the corresponding diluted 

recoverable ore reserve grade 1.73% WO3, which represents a grade variance (loss) of –

1%.  Mill head grade for the period was 1.67% WO3, which compares well with mucked 

grade.  This suggests that diluted recoverable ore reserve estimates are reasonably 

accurate on a global basis.  This suggests, by extension, that assaying has been 

reasonably accurate.

15 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The mill processing facilities at Cantung comprise primary crushing and coarse ore 

storage installations, secondary and tertiary crushing, fine ore storage, general gravity and 

flotation building with offices and a maintenance shop, backfill preparation building 

(inactive), reagents and supplies storage building and an assay lab.  Although the mill 

was designed to process 1,000 tons per day, it has achieved continuous processing rates 

of up to 1,200 tons per day.  The Life of Mine Plan (LOMP) details an average 

processing tonnage of 1,100 tons per day at a recovery rate of 76.4% of WO3.  Final 

products will be approximately 330 tons per month of gravity concentrate (G1), 

containing 60% to 70 % WO3 at 60% recovery and approximately 100 tons per month of 

flotation concentrate containing 47% WO3 at 16% recovery. These target numbers appear 

to be obtainable based on projected ore metallurgical characteristics and past performance 

attained by the operation.  A process flowsheet is shown in Figure 16-1. 

 
PRIMARY CRUSHING 

Ore is handled from the stockpile by a loader or directly dumped from haulage truck 

into a 30 ton receiving bin equipped with 42 in x 10 ft apron feeder, which, in turn, feeds 

a 42 in x 48 in jaw crusher.  The jaw crusher is set to produce a nominal five inch crushed 

product.  A conveyor transports crushed ore into a 1,000 ton capacity coarse ore bin.  

This bin acts as a surge bin for the secondary crushing circuit.   

 
SECONDARY & TERTIARY CRUSHING 

A vibratory feeder and a conveyor feed a 4¼ ft (secondary) standard cone crusher, 

which produces a minus 1½ inch product.  The crushed ore is discharged via conveyor to 

a vibrating screen equipped with a 9/16 in. x four inch slotted screen.  The oversize feeds 

a 4¼ ft (tertiary) short-head cone crusher.  This crusher is set to deliver a minus 3/8 in 

product that combines with the standard (secondary) crusher discharge to feed the screen 

in a closed-circuit recycle.  Screened undersize (minus 9/16 in.) product is conveyed to 

two fine ore bins ahead of the grinding mills in the concentrator.  Dust is controlled by 

the use of a wet scrubber with the discharge slurry returning to the mill as a recycle. 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.

GRINDING, CLASSIFICATION AND TALC FLOTATION 
The grinding circuit consists of a primary 9 ft x 12 ft rod mill, powered by a 450 hp 

motor and a secondary 7 ft x 10 ft rod mill powered by a 200 hp motor.  The primary rod 

mill is fed from the two fine ore bins via a conveyor and discharges ground ore slurry into 

a sump for pumping to primary cyclones.  The cyclones overflow is discharged by gravity 

to "talc" flotation and the underflow is pumped to vibrating Derrick Screens for sizing.   

Talc complicates scheelite flotation and therefore it is floated first and sent directly to 

mill tails.  The flotation tails go to two 40 ft diameter triple-tray thickeners in parallel, 

which also receive gravity circuit tails ahead of scheelite flotation.  The screen undersize 

goes to a 40 ft diameter triple-tray thickener.  The oversize is gravity fed to a dewatering 

classifier, from which the sand feeds the secondary rod mill.  Classifier overflow and the 

secondary rod mill discharge merge with the primary rod mill discharge in the pump box.   

 
SULPHIDE FLOTATION 

Underflow from the thickener, after conditioning with appropriate promoters, 

collectors, depressants, and frothers, is floated for its sulphide content.  The resulting 

sulphide flotation tails are sent to the gravity circuit. 

 
GRAVITY SEPARATION 

Sulphide flotation tails are distributed to triple-deck shaking tables for rougher 

concentration of scheelite.  Concentrate from these tables is cleaned on single-deck tables 

before being pumped to the dewatering classifier that feeds the dryer.  Rougher table tails 

are de-slimed with a cyclone.  The cyclone overflow (slimes and excess water) is sent to 

the scheelite flotation thickeners while the underflow sand is reground in a single pass 

through a 6 ft dia. x 8 ft ball mill.  The ball mill discharge is passed through cyclones 

which direct the slimes to the scheelite thickeners and the sands to a secondary sulphide 

flotation step whereby freshly liberated sulphides are removed prior to the flow being 

sent to triple-deck tables for scavenging of gravity recoverable scheelite.  The concentrate 

from these tables is cleaned on single-deck tables with final concentrates joining other 

concentrates in the dewatering classifier ahead of drying.  The tailings from the 

scavenging table circuit are pumped to the scheelite thickeners to prepare feed for 

scheelite flotation.

The gravity circuit can be adjusted to produce a range of G1 concentrate grades; 

production of higher grade G1 increases gravity circuit losses such that the volume of 

flotation concentrate production increases.  . 
 
SCHEELITE FLOTATION CONCENTRATE 

In general, the flotation feed consists of gravity circuit cyclone overflow products, 

talc flotation tails and secondary gravity tails.  The thickened underflow slurry from the 

thickeners is treated with a frother and passed through a tertiary sulphide bank to remove 

residual sulphides and talc, after which the material is sent to conditioners where it is 

treated with a conventional pH regulator, depressants, collectors and a frother.  The 

rougher and scavenger flotation circuits produce their respective concentrates, which are 

then cleaned in conventional cleaner flotation cells and re-cleaned in column cells to 

produce a marketable-grade final concentrate.  The flotation concentrate is thickened in a 

20 ft thickener, filtered, and then dried in a rotary furnace to reduce moisture before being 

loaded into bags for shipment to markets. The flotation tails are passed through a Knelson 

concentrator to scavenge residual coarse scheelite; Knelson tails report to final tails while 

the concentrate joins the gravity circuit feed. 

 
DRYING AND MAGNETIC SEPARATION 

The cleaner table gravity concentrate contains, on average, 55% to 65% WO3.  It is 

dewatered in a spiral classifier before entering the roaster (dryer).  The roaster is 

equipped with cooling screws, which help cool the dryer discharge as it is transported to 

magnetic separators by use of a bucket elevator system.  Magnetic separation is 

accomplished in two stages.   The first stage consists of two roll type separators that 

produce a high grade product with their rejects being further treated by a secondary stage.   

The secondary stage consists of three electro magnetic units fixed over a moving belt.  

The concentrates from both stages are combined to produce the final product, while the 

high sulfur rejects from each stage are returned to the mill circuit for re-processing.

CONCENTRATE HANDLING AND STORAGE 
Dried concentrate is packed in two ton plastic tote bags for shipment to the customers.  

Bagged concentrate is stored in covered areas before being shipped.  The tote bags are 

handled with a small forklift. 

 
TAILINGS DISPOSAL 

Tailings are pumped to tailings ponds No. 4 for disposal and storage.  Solution from 

the tailings ponds is pumped to polishing pond No. 5, from which it passes to the 

environment by exfiltration.  Tailings pond No. 4 was an exfiltration pond until 2007 

when it was upgraded to store tailings.  Pond 5 was constructed in 2006 and utilized in 

2007 for exfiltration   No tailings were used for mine backfill.  

 

In 2001, the embankment of Tailings pond No. 3 was raised by two metres, with an 

additional two metres added in 2003, and a further 1.5 metres lift added in 2005. The 

current crest elevation of tails pond 5 is at 3,765 ft.. 

 

 Tailings pond No. 5 was completed in the fall of 2006 to an elevation of 3740 ft., 

20 feet below it's design elevation of 3760 ft. Tails pond 5 was originally designed to 

become the primary tails disposal pond as tails pond 3 reached capacity in late 2006. As 

noted below, tails pond 5 became the designated exfiltration pond in early 2007. Due to 

its change in function, tails pond 5 is being modified by the addition of 33 ft wide support 

wedge of material to the upstream face. This is expected to be completed in the 2009 

construction season. 

 

 In 2006 it became clear that polishing pond #4, which received the decant water 

from tails pond 3 was rapidly blinding off and was no longer exfiltrating efficiently. 

Though a number of attempts were made to re-establish exfiltration (such as dredging and 

excavating), it became clear that it had reached the end of its life as an exfiltration pond. 

After studying the options, and noticing how well TP5 exfiltrated, the decision was made 

to use TP4 as a tails pond, and pump the supernatant water to TP5 for disposal by 

exfiltration. Upon receiving approval from the MVLWB in February 2007, tails 

deposition was started into tails pond 4.  



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.

 In 2007, tails pond 4 was raised from its original elevation of 3690 ft to 3715 feet, 

providing tails storage capacity for production into late 2008. In 2008 tails pond 4 was 

raised to 3730 ft elevation to provide tails storage capacity until late 2009. In 2009 tails 

pond 4 will again be raised, to a planned 3742.5 ft elevation, which will provide tails 

storage capacity until mid/late 2010.  

 

 For future tailings disposal options beyond 2010, initial planning is underway to 

investigate possible scenarios including further lifts on existing Tailings Ponds 3 & 4, 

building a new tails pond, and disposal of tails underground. 

 

 Capital costs include an allowance for completing the dam lift on Tailings Ponds 
4 & 5. 

 
LABORATORY  

There is an assay laboratory on site, which has been used for sample preparation and 

assaying services for the mine and mill,.  The laboratory QA/QC testing with other labs is 

monitored and managed by the Geology Department,  Reference material and control 

samples are used in each assay run in the lab. 

 
 PROCESS RECOVERY 

Recovery is calculated using the assays of the mill tails and recovered concentrates in 

conjunction with the concentrate weights and mill feed tonnage. As a check on 

recoveries, the sampled mill feed assay is checked against the back calculated feed assay; 

if a significant discrepancy is noted, conveyor weightometer calibration and sampling 

systems are immediately checked. 

 
PLANNED MILL CHANGES 

In January 2009, two significant changes in the mill will occur.  Firstly, a new 22.5 

foot high by 6-foot diameter flotation column will be installed to recover fine scheelite 

that escapes the conventional flotation cells.  The estimated increase in overall mill 

recovery is 1.5%.

Secondly, a copper circuit will be initiated to recover copper from the sulphide 

circuit.  Currently the sulphide concentrates are disposed to tailings.

3. Mineral Reserves are estimated at a cutoff grade of 0.80% WO3.  
4. A minimum mining width of 15 feet was used..  

 

 

When production is taken into account, Mineral Reserves have increased since the 

previous estimate.  Increases are due to exploration of new zones, inclusion of lower-

grade areas rendered economic by higher prices, and planned pillar recovery in 

previously mined areas through the use of longhole mining methods.   

 

 

ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY 
UNDERGROUND MINE 

NATCL mine personnel updated the Mineral Resources estimate for the underground 

mine.  The update was carried out using commercially available software.  

Minesight/Compass was used to create a 3D block model of the various ore bodies. 

Mine openings were generated in AutoCad/Promine and entered into the project. The 

openings were not included in the calculations per se but were used to limit material 

remaining to be mined. Block size was 10 ft x 10 ft x 10 ft (X x Y x Z). 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 16-3

The model was oriented parallel to the grid EW and NS directions (i.e. not rotated). It 

is apparent that work undertaken by Scott Wilson RPA in July 2008, that modelling 

constraints need to be tightened. This should have a positive effect on grade calculations 

in the more steeply dipping areas of the mine. 

 
OPEN PIT AND PUG ZONES 

In 2006, Scott Wilson RPA generated a 3D Block model of the Open Pit and PUG 

using Gemcom. According to Scott Wilson RPA " a subset of 189 holes were selected for 

use in grade interpolation in the Open Pit/PUG block model.  Included in this subset are 

the 15 most recent holes drilled in 2005.  In total, the 189 drillholes in the Open Pit/PUG 

subset encompass 4,162 sampled intervals, and of these, 3,845 samples were used for 

grade interpolation."  

In 2007 the model was exported to Minesight. The missing surface data was 

incorporated into the model. The mineralized lens were slightly modified to better match 

lithology.   The estimate was carried out using a block model constrained with wireframe 

solid models of the principal lithologic units, and was essentially an update of the block 

model created for the 2006 estimate.  Grade was estimated into the blocks using Inverse 

Distance Cubed weighting.  The block model was constructed using Minesight software.  

Block size was 10 ft x 10 ft x 10 ft (X x Y x Z), and the model was oriented parallel to 

the grid EW and NS directions (i.e. not rotated). 

The Minesight model was compared to the 2006 model completed by Scott Wilson 

RPA. While lithological boundaries were honoured to limit the "smearing" of grades, 

individual rock types were given the same code. The rationale being that the bulk of the 

remaining resource was confined to the "Swiss Cheese Limestone".  

The gross results were comparable to that obtained by Scott Wilson RPA. A cutoff of 

0.8% WO3 was applied to the resource compared to the 0.5% used by Scott Wilson RPA. 

This resulted in 472,000 tons at 1.3% WO3 meeting the criteria. (Scott Wilson RPA 

arrived at 448,000 tons at 1.4% WO3 using a 0.8% cutoff)

BLOCK MODEL METHODOLOGY 
 

For the 2008 estimate of the underground Mineral Resources, Cantung mine staff did 

not cap high grade WO3. It is of the opinion of the author that caps should be applied to 

composites and not individual assays as the tendency of mine personell is to selectively 

sample very high but small intersections of scheelite even though the adjacent samples 

are of the same lithology. Time did not permit a detailed analysis of the high grade 

composites but by using inverse cubing the impact of these relatively few samples is 

minimal (most of the historical high grade samples are in areas already mined out). 

The search parameters used in the reserve estimate are significantly smaller than 

previously employed, to a maximum of 150 ft (down from 270 feet).  Several estimates 

were made using different search radius but the results were almost identical. This is in 

large part due to using a maximum of 10 composites in total and a maximum of 3 per 

drill hole for interpolation. These requirements are usually met before the search ellipsoid 

has looked more than 50 feet.  

.   As for the Open Pit and PUG, the estimate was carried out using a block model 

constrained with wireframe solid models of the principal lithologic units.  Grade was 

estimated into the blocks using Inverse Distance Cubed weighting.  The block model was 

constructed using Minesight software.  Block size was 10 ft x 10 ft x 10 ft (X x Y x Z), 

and the model was oriented parallel to the grid EW and NS directions (i.e. not rotated).

follow testholes.  The block grades appeared to honour the drillhole grades reasonably 

well. 

CUT-OFF GRADES 
A cut-off grade of 0.80% WO3 was applied to the block model to estimate Mineral 

Resources for the Open Pit/PUG and the entire E Zone Orebody.  It is apparent that more 

work needs to be done on the open pit/PUG before it can be upgraded to Reserve. Much 

of the remaining material is amenable to underground mining only. 

 

 

RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
Underground  Mineral Resources were classified as follows: 

 

Indicated Mineral Resources were those that were either: 

• Blocks outlined that fell within a 50 ft radius of a diamond drill hole. 
Initial calculations were on a 12.5 ft measured, 25 ft indicated and a 50 ft 
inferred basis but it was apparent that these constraints were too harsh as 
indicated in previous work undertaken by Scott Wilson RPA. As a result 
all data calculated to one of these three parameters was redefined as 
"indicated" 

 

Open pit Mineral Resources were classified as follows: 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 16-6

• Blocks outlined that fell within a 100 foot radius of a diamond drill hole.  
 
Inferred Resources were not reported as they are for the most part quite small (due to 

limiting the model to lithological codes obtained by modeling of the lenses).

MINERAL RESERVES 

The Mineral Reserve estimate for the Cantung Mine is provided above in Table 16-2.  

No Mineral Reserves were estimated for the Open Pit/PUG Zone, pending redesign of the 

pit, and separation of the underground PUG Zone from the Open Pit resource blocks.  

 

Mineral Reserves for the underground were estimated by applying extraction and 

dilution estimates to the insitu Mineral Resources.  Dilution was applied in a manner 

specific to the ore body characteristics, configuration, and extraction methods, in 

accordance with the lengthy experience of mine operation.  Dilution was added at zero 

grade, although there are often modest WO3 values in the diluting material.  Some of the 

Mineral Resources were deliberately excluded from the Mineral Reserves owing to 

access or design constraints.  These Mineral Resources remain in the inventory as 

material that may become mineable at some future time.

WEST EXTENSION, SHOP ZONE, AND E ZONE 
The West Extension and Shop Zone comprise primarily polygonal blocks through an 

area of the mine that has not been worked before.  As such, this material does not 

encompass pillars for the most part.  The E Zone is in the older part of the mine and 

comprises stope remnants and pillars. 

 

Dilution and extraction were determined from a conceptual stope design for each 

block, which took into account the thickness and orientation of the block.  From 16 ft to 

25 ft of wall rock dilution was added to the block depending on the design parameters.  

Extraction percentages ranged from 80% - 90%.  After dilution and extraction parameters 

were applied, the remaining material was summed and assigned to the Probable Mineral 

Reserves category. 

 
MAIN ZONE 

The Main Zone consists of pillars that will be recovered by advancing drifts below 

them, drilling longhole uppers in a fan pattern to blast both the pillar and a drawpoint 

cone underneath.  Material in the cone is anticipated to be waste.  Muck will be extracted 

until ore grade material starts to appear at the drawpoint.   From that point onward the 

muck will be trammed to the mill, until the grade has diminished to below cut-off.  This 

part of the mine has been backfilled with unconsolidated material and so it is anticipated 

that some of the backfill will be entrained in the ore, and that extraction of the entire 

pillar will not be possible.   

 

The dilution was estimated separately for different portions of the stoping block.  For 

the cone, it is estimated that as much as 50% of this material (assigned zero grade) will 

become entrained in the ore.  For the pillars themselves, it is estimated that the bottom 

50% of the pillar will be extracted with 0% dilution.  The next 25% of the pillar volume 

was then diluted at 50%, still with 100% extraction.  The top 25% of the pillar is deemed 

unrecoverable.   

 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 16-9

SOUTH FLATS 
This is also pillar material, although the backfill comprises sand from the tails and is 

anticipated to have more strength than the rock fill.  The conceptual mining plan is 

similar to that for the Main Zone.  However, the dilution estimate is somewhat different.  

Dilution from the sand was estimated to be 20% of the total pillar volumes, and 

extraction was estimated to be 70%. 

 

CLASSIFICATION 
All Mineral Resources in the underground mine are in the Indicated category.  

Accordingly, all Mineral Reserves have been assigned to the Probable category. The 

classification of the Mineral Reserves has been done according to the rules and guidelines 

set forth in NI43-101.

17 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND 
INFORMATION 
MINING OPERATIONS 

The Cantung Mine comprises underground and open pit operations, producing ore at 

a rate of 1,100 stpd.  The underground mine was developed as a multilevel operation 

based on the E-Zone (main ore body), which was extensively mined in the past, and the 

narrower West Extension, which has been mined only recently.  Underground areas form 

the current Mineral Reserves. 

 

The open pit ore body contains the Open Pit and PUG Zones, for which current 

Mineral Resources have been estimated.  Open Pit mining has taken place in the past, and 

as recently as the summer of 2006.  The PUG Zone, located in the wall of the pit, has 

been explored with drifting and diamond drilling.  Ore from both sources has historically 

been blended with feed from underground. 

 

MINING METHODS 
In the past, the mine used a variety of mining methods including room and pillar, cut 

and fill, longhole stoping with and without delayed backfill, and pillar-remnant ore 

recovery using different techniques.  The primary mining method was cut and fill, using 

breasting or benching techniques for ore extraction.  Waste rock was used as backfill and 

a working platform for subsequent mining lifts when breasting. 

 

Currently, longhole methods are planned for the majority of the remaining reserves, 

both for pillar recovery and for primary mining in areas with favourable geometry.  

Access drifts are driven under the old workings, providing drill locations for upholes into 

remnant pillars above.  The drill patterns form a draw cone from the access up to the base 

of the ore – this waste is mucked first after blasting, and discarded.  In some cases, the 

pillars are surrounded by unconsolidated waste fill from previous cut and fill mining, and 

higher levels of dilution are expected as a result.  In other cases, the pillars are 

surrounded by void space, and extraction is expected to be lower, as some ore will be 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 17-2

blasted outwards into the old workings and will not be recovered.  To reduce the 

possibility of dilution from waste backfill and loss into the open stope longhole drill 

patterns are designed to leave a skin of rock around the pillar perimeter.  In most cases 

this skin fails during or after the broken ore is removed allowing a higher than expected 

recovery rate and lower than expected dilution.   

 

Cut and fill methods are planned for areas with narrower ore widths, such as the West 

Extension, and for a few primary stopes in other areas.  Mining widths for cut and fill are 

expected to be approximately 15 ft to 30 ft.  Waste rock will be used as backfill for the 

working areas.  Backfill material comes from waste development.   

 

Grade control is achieved through close monitoring of mining faces by geologists and 

engineering staff to assess the grades and mark up the ore contacts.  Grades are estimated 

at the faces through visual inspection using a UV light.  Face and muck pile samples are 

also collected and assayed for mill feed grade estimation.   

 

GROUND CONDITIONS AND ROCK MECHANICS CONSIDERATIONS 
The Cantung Mine is in relatively good physical condition.  Ground conditions can be 

classified as generally good to very good, with the exception of localized weaker parts 

where the ground has deteriorated due to mining extraction, due to the occurrence of 

weaker rocks and structures, or a combination of both.   

 

Within the ore body envelope, there are occasional weaker zones, mostly attributed to 

structural settings and these areas require more extensive ground control work than in 

other areas in order to maintain safe access and working conditions. 

 

The primary access and infrastructure openings are well supported, large in size, and 

driven in good to very good ground.  Primary ground support consists of different lengths 

of mechanical and friction type rock bolting, wire mesh screening, and strapping.  Local 

ground conditions dictate the type of application, spacing, and length of rock bolts used.  

 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 17-3

 There are areas in the old workings where pillars have failed and the hanging wall has 

deteriorated.  Some parts of the remnant ore extraction zones have wide spans, in excess 

of 30 ft, across the intermediate backs. Wide-span back areas are supported with rebar 

and split set rock bolts, cable bolts and wire mesh screen. The area of hanging wall 

failure is expected to expand as pillar mining progresses; however, no threats to active 

areas are anticipated. Geotechnical monitoring of key areas, and regular review of ground 

support practices and procedures are carried out based on the results. 

 

Pakalnis & Associates, geomechanics specialists, conducted a ground control audit on 

February 15 to 19, 2006.  The audit included a review of ground conditions of stopes and 

mining areas, geometrics of critical back spans, ground support, and pillar recovery.  

Pakalnis & Associates made the following recommendations: 

• Minimization of the amount of undercut through the use of a "rammer 
jammer" or some alternative way to provide tight fill 

 
• Re-evaluation of intersections for the use of rebar and screen, particularly in 

areas where the span has exceeded the critical span 
 
• The use of a higher-capacity mechanical bolt (8.6 ton) in addition to pull tests 

to determine the realized strength 
 
• The use of rebar and screen in development drifts in response to deterioration 

from secondary blast and stress damage 
 
• The implementation of a design criteria or methodical engineering approach to 

their mining activities in combinations with past practices and experiences. 
 

 

Pakalnis & Associates conducted a follow-up ground control audit on March 9 to 12, 

2008. The audit included a review of the February 2006 ground support recommendations 

and implementation of same.  Ground conditions of stopes and mining areas, geometrics 

of critical back spans, ground support, and pillar recovery were again reviewed along 

with support standards in use. 

Pakalnis & Associates made the following recommendations: 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 17-4

• Address the induced stress deterioration in the West Extension through 

seismic support (rebar, straps, chainlink) along with developing a 3D model to 

minimize adverse geometries/mine sequences. 

• The use of Shotcrete where weak rock mass/adverse faulting are encountered. 

• Ground control standards as presently employed should continue. 

 

MINING AREAS 
The Cantung Mine workings extend vertically from 3700 up to the 4350 level and 

cover a strike length of approximately 5,000 ft.  In order of size, the key underground 

mining reserve areas are:  

• Main Zone (Pillar Recovery) 

• West Extension 

• West Extension (below 3700) 

• Central Flats 

• E-Zone (Primary Mining) 

• Shop Zone 

 

Mining areas outside of Mineral Reserves include: 

• Open Pit 

• PUG Zone 

 
MAIN ZONE 

The Main Zone remnants are predominantly pillars of different shapes and types left 

in the central portion of the mined out E-zone. During 2007 and 2008, undercut 

development was completed and the majority of the Main Zone pillars were extracted.  

Lessons learned during the initial pillar excavations allowed planning to reduce future 

pillar extraction dilution and losses.  Seven Main Zone pillars remain to be mined in 

2009.

WEST EXTENSION 
The West Extension is located at the western end of the 3950 haulage drift level and 

extends westward and below this level.  This area was explored by diamond drilling prior 

to 1986 and was first developed for ore production in 2001.  The ore was initially 

extracted by cut and fill methods, using waste rock as backfill material and later by 

longhole retreat methods leaving open stopes.  

 

The 2005/2006 production from the West Extension was below previous resource 

estimates for a number of reasons: 

• Higher than expected dilution 

• Use of lower cut-off grades for grade control (i.e. more low-grade rounds sent 

to mill) 

• Narrow and patchy mineralization causing continuity problems 

 

Over the summer of 2006, West Extension Mineral Reserves were re-estimated by 

Cantung Mine personnel.  Dilution reflecting recent experience was applied.  Low grade 

control cut-off grades are no longer necessary, as long hole tons from pillar recovery are 

now available to form the majority of mill feed.  Greater selection has been applied to 

West Extension mineralization, eliminating narrow or isolated areas from reserves.   

Additional sill development and two long hole stopes were mined during 2007 and 2008.  

Stope sequence modeling to mine the remainder of the West Extension was recently 

completed.

SOUTH FLATS 
 

The South Flats Pillar Zone comprises the mined out areas on the south side of the E-

Zone orebody, on the 4100 and 4050 levels.  The area was mined and backfilled, leaving 

long rib pillars that are generally 15 ft to 30 ft in width. Extraction of the remaining 

pillars is achieved by mining an undercut drift (ramped down from 3950 level) and 

drilling longholes up into each of the pillars.  Each undercut drift accessed several pillars, 

to be mined in a retreating sequence. 

 

During 2007 and 2008, undercut development was completed and all the South Flats 

pillars were extracted.  The process of drilling test holes into the pillars to confirm the 

pillar dimensions and grade was started in the South Flats and expanded to the Main Zone 

pillars.  The testhole results allowed selective mining of the long strike length pillars.  

Lessons learned during the initial pillar excavations allowed planning to reduce future 

pillar extraction dilution and losses.   

 

Exploration around the perimeter of the South Flats is planned for 2009.

WEST EXTENSION (BELOW 3700 LEVEL) 
The West Extension zone below 3700 Level (lowest mine development) is located at 

the western end of the 3950 haulage drift level and extends from the 3700 ft elevation to 

the 3450 ft elevation.   This area was discovered and explored by diamond drilling during 

2008 resulting in new resource and reserve for the Cantung Mine.  Development of an 

access decline ramp has commenced to access the zone in the second quarter 2009.  Ore 

development and longhole mining of this zone will take place throughout the Life Of 

Mine. 
 
CENTRAL FLATS 

The Central Flats Zone is located down dip of the western end of the E Zone stopes 

and on strike centrally between the South Flats and the West Extension.  The zone 

extends from the 3920 ft elevation to the 3700 ft elevation and is accessed by a decline 

ramp developed off the 3950 haulage drift level in 2008.   This area was partially 

explored by diamond drilling prior to 1986 and was not previously included in resource 

estimates.  Ore development to test the zone was carried out during 2008 resulting in the 

addition of mining reserves.  Room and pillar mining is planned for the relatively flat 

lying veins in this zone.  Diamond drilling is planned for 2009 to further delineate the 

zone along dip and strike. 
 
E-ZONE 

The E-Zone was, historically, the main mining zone located in the central portion of 

the mine.  The ore body extends vertically above and below the 3950 haulage level.  

Remnant stopes and pillars range from 4100 level to 4400 level.  Several will be mined 

during 2009. 

 
SHOP ZONE 

The Shop Zone is an area of mineralization located behind the shop on 3950 level.   

The zone was developed and the majority mined by longhole methods in 2008.  The 

remainder will be mined in the first quarter 2009.

 OPEN PIT 
The open pit mine is located west of the main underground ore body, at the 4900 

level.  Access is limited to the summer months, as the steep road is prone to icing and 

avalanche danger during the winter.  The open pit was idle from 1976 to 2004 due to 

unfavourable economics. 

 

The pit was mined in the summers of 2005 and 2006 using a local contractor from 

Watson Lake.  The pit ore was hauled over a three mile haulage road to a stockpile 

located in the vicinity of the primary crusher, directly above the mill.  The ore, grading 

approximately 0.5% WO3, was blended with underground feed whenever underground 

production lagged below planned levels.   

 

Mining was carried out by use of conventional open pit methods.  The design 

parameters for the pit utilized a triple bench with the bench height being 20 ft, 25 ft safety 

berm, and 12% grade for the haul road.  In addition, to accommodate geotechnical 

constraints, an overall pit slope of 45o was used, with the exception of those sections of 

the wall that transect the East Fault Block.  The pit sectors transected by the East Fault 

Block required a reduced pit slope of 40o for a portion of the wall. 

 

More design work is required in order to move the Open Pit Mineral Resource into 

Mineral Reserves. 

 
PUG ZONE 

The PUG zone is an extension of the open pit ore body, contained within the wall of 

the pit.  It has been defined by drilling and exploration drifting.  It will be mined by room 

and pillar methods, with benching over several lifts (Figure 18-7).  The ore from PUG 

will be hauled to the mill stockpile via the open pit haulage road.  More design work is 

required in order to move the PUG Zone Mineral Resource into Mineral Reserves.

LIFE OF MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 
The mine production schedule is based on providing ore from  seven sources to the 

processing facilities at an average rate of 1,100 tons per day.  These sources include the 

Main Zone Pillars, West Extension, West Extension (Below 3700), Central Flats, E-Zone, 

Shop Zone, and some stockpiled material.  To demonstrate that the Underground Mineral 

Reserves are an economically mineable part of Mineral Resources, the Open Pit and PUG 

Zones (outside of Mineral Reserves) are not included in the production schedule and 

discounted cash flow analysis.  The Open Pit and PUG Zones require further work before 

they can be included in Mineral Reserves.  Table 17-1 shows the production ore tonnes 

for each zone and the relative grades.

will be blended with underground ore and processed in the mill.  Underground Mineral 

Reserves are scheduled from October 2008 to April 2010, 1.65 years of mining.  The 

production schedule is shown in Table 17-2.

 Underground waste development requirements are scheduled to decline over the mine 

life, with development essentially complete by the end of 2009.  Ongoing development 

totalling 4,000 ft (90,000 tons) includes completion of ramp access and connections in the 

West Extension Zone below 3700 Level, pillar undercuts in the Main Zones, and ramp 

access and connections in the Central Flats Zone. 

 

Stope preparation comprises advance zone and mining block development with the 

necessary construction and service activities for providing a safe and productive 

environment in the mine.  In general, the stope preparation process focuses on stope 

access, ore transport/transfer development, ventilation, and backfill delivery systems 

installation.   

 

Stope sequencing is scheduled, wherever possible, to obtain a uniform and 

metallurgically acceptable blend of ore to the mill.  The existing sill pillars are relatively 

narrow with a high rock stress, which limit flexibility in the sequencing of West 

Extension stopes.   

 

The underground mine has experienced problems in the past in maintaining the 

production rate, due largely to a period of changeover from predominately cut and fill 

methods to predominately long hole methods, requiring extensive stope preparation lead 

time.  Through 2009 ore will be sourced from development, cut and fill, pillar recovery 

and longhole stoping.  Upon completion of stope preparation longhole methods will be 

the predominate source of ore in the latter part of the mine life.

INFRASTRUCTURE 

UNDERGROUND 
The main access to the mine is via an adit collared in close proximity to the mill at 

3950 level.  The concrete-paved adit serves as the main ore haulage drift for the mine and 

also as a return airway for mine ventilation.  Fresh air is delivered to the mine via an 

intake ventilation adit collared at the 4350 level.  The ventilation adit is connected with a 

decline, serving as an escape way or an emergency access to the mine.  

 

On both sides of the main haulage drift are five loadout stations, spaced several 

hundred feet apart.  These loadout stations receive broken muck via raises from the 

mining areas above.  Muck from the loadout stations is transferred by loader into a truck, 

which hauls the ore to the mill stockpile/crushing station. 

 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 17-21

The mine has a number of internal ramps connecting different levels and ore zones.  

A majority of the ramps are of large cross section and driven on a moderate gradient from 

10% to 12%. 

 
SHOPS & MATERIAL STORAGE 

The mine has an underground maintenance shop with a warehouse, located on the 

3950 level off the main haulage drift.  The maintenance shop is a multi-chamber 

excavation with large service bays and warehousing facilities.  The back and walls are 

well supported and appear to be in very good condition.  The shop maintenance bays are 

equipped with overhead cranes ranging from 5 ton to 15 ton capacity.  Electrical repair 

and welding stations are part of the shop service infrastructure.  The warehouse is large 

and stocked with a sizable inventory of parts.  The shop has a lunchroom equipped for 

emergency situations and a separate escapeway, in a fresh airway, to surface.   

 

There are open field storage areas and crib facilities located in different parts of the 

mine.  They are stocked with typical mining consumables, such as rock bolts, wire mesh 

screen, pipe, fittings, and timber needed for construction and ground support applications. 

 
POWER 

Mine site electric power is obtained from the powerhouse via the site electrical 

distribution system.  The electric power is delivered to the mine substations at 4160V and 

transformed to 600V.  From the mine substations, power is distributed via electric cables 

to different areas of the mine to feed the underground mobile and stationary equipment.

WATER 

The mine is generally dry, with flow out the 3950 level adit estimated to be

drained by gravity via ditches and a number of decant holes and raises down to the 3950 

haulage drift.  The West Extension workings, below the 3950 level, are dewatered by use 

of sump pumps and pipelines discharging water to the 3950 adit ditch.  The quality of 

mine drainage water is monitored in accordance with the regulatory requirements. 

 

Mine process water is delivered from the main water storage tank to the mine via a 

piping system.  The mine has an extensive underground water pipe line system feeding 

the shop and all key production and development areas.  Potable water is brought into the 

mine in small containers.

propane burners for heating the air in winter to prevent freezing of the intake drift.  The 

air heaters are equipped with 12 million BTU burners.  The fans push the air down the 

mine through various levels.  The underground airflow is controlled by a number of 

ventilation doors, raises, and regulators.  Auxiliary fans and ducting provide ventilation in 

development and blind areas of the mine.  The mine ventilation air exhausts back to 

surface via the 3950 level haulage adit.  

The ventilation schematic is shown in Figure 17-9.  

 
VEHICLE SERVICE 

Vehicle maintenance is carried out in the underground shop.  The UG maintenance 

shop is well designed and furbished for providing a wide variety of services for the whole 

underground equipment fleet.  All regular and major maintenance services are done at 

this location.  Major engine rebuilds are done off-site.

SURFACE 
The key site facilities, including: Apartment Blocks, Condominiums, First Aid Room, 

Kitchen, Shops, Warehouses, offices, and other service buildings appear generally in 

good condition. 

 

The camp consists of apartment buildings and kitchen facilities.  Employees, 

contractors, and site visitors are accommodated in an 80 person apartment complex and 

in staff rooms above the main office.  The site can accommodate up to 140 people at one 

time.  

 

The site has a large number of offices.  Practically, each operation at the site has an 

office, or a number of offices, as in the case of the processing facilities and the mine dry 

building.  Each office is equipped with a telephone linked to the site satellite 

communication system.  Most of the offices are provided with computers linked to the 

site network.   

 

The site main offices are located in a separate building and will accommodate the 

mine manager, maintenance superintendent, human resources, safety, and accounting 

departments.  First Aid and employee training facilities are located in the same building. 

 

The site surface shop is located close to the warehouse and processing facilities.  It 

provides service to all surface mobile equipment and provides a repair facility for other 

miscellaneous work.  The shop is well designed and equipped with an overhead crane and 

welding and pipe fitting stations.   

 

Materials are stored in several locations at the site.  A heated central warehouse is 

located close to the mill and maintenance shop.  In addition to the warehouse, there are 

several cold storage buildings and outdoor storage areas.  All of the buildings are in good 

order.

Water is sourced from the Flat River in accordance with the Water Licence.  The 

water usage is restricted by the Water Licence to less than 45,000 m3 per week.  The 

water is treated and used as potable and process water.  The water pump house has its 

own backup power generator.   

 

The site is supplied with electric power from a single powerhouse, equipped with 

diesel generators.  Total installed power at the site is approximately 8.5 MW and the 

demand in cold weather approaches 4.5 MW.  Fuel consumption for power generation is 

approximately 22,000 litres per day.  Waste heat from the genset cooling system is 

recovered to heat the mill and other building facilities.   

 

Diesel fuel is stored in two 360,000 litre tanks at the site.  Diesel fuel from the main 

tanks is delivered to the powerhouse and roaster by gravity via a five centimetre diameter 

pipeline, equipped with a number of control valves.  Additionally, there are day tanks in 

the powerhouse with a capacity of 18,000 litres.  

 

Outside the powerhouse, adjacent to the administration building, there are spare diesel 

tanks with a total capacity of 13,000 litres.  Gasoline is stored in a 9,000 litre tank, 

equipped with a distribution pump for fuelling light vehicles.  The underground mobile 

equipment is fuelled from a diesel tank located at the portal. 

 

Propane is used for camp heating, cooking, and mine intake air heating.  There are 

numerous propane storage tanks at different locations on the site and at the mine air 

intake fan station.  Tanker trucks deliver propane, diesel, and gasoline to the tanks on site.  

 

All sewage is discharged to the Tailings Containment Area in accordance with the 

Water Licence provision.   

 

The site has a small garbage incinerator located at the garbage dump.  Site garbage is 

incinerated at this installation and the residue, and other solid non-combustible waste, is 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 17-27

buried at the existing garbage dump in a former borrow pit approximately three 

kilometres southeast of the town site.   

 

Hazardous waste is handled, stored, and disposed of in accordance with applicable 

regulations.  PCB materials previously stored in a permitted facility at the site were 

removed for destruction in 2002.  There are several transformers in service, with only 2 

of these transformers containing PCB's.  

 
TRANSPORTATION 

Although the mine is situated in the Northwest Territories, the town of Watson Lake, 

Yukon Territory, is the staging area for trucking the tungsten concentrates and for 

supplying the mine site. 

 

Travel by road between the mine site and Watson Lake takes four to five hours.  

Travel by plane between Whitehorse and the mine can take up to two hours, depending 

upon the type of aircraft used. 

 

The airstrip is a 1,219 m long VFR rated gravel strip.  It has been maintained during 

mine closures in the past and was reopened in 2005.  The airstrip needs periodic grading 

to level the surface.   

 

Employees who live outside the Yukon are transported by plane between standard 

points of hire and the site.  NATCL charters private aircraft (Northern Thunderbird Air) 

from Vancouver to Prince George and/or Smithers to transport the majority of the 

workforce.  From Whitehorse, employees are transported by vehicle to the mine.  Pickup 

of employees are made in Watson Lake and other eastern Yukon communities. 

  

Emergency transportation, particularly medical evacuation, will be by whatever 

means are possible in the prevailing weather and road conditions.  Fixed-wing aircraft, 

helicopter, bus, ambulance, or a company vehicle could be used in an emergency 

situation. 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 17-28

Concentrates are shipped from the mine site to customers in two-tonne plastic tote 

bags by truck.  Trucks delivering materials to the mine site backhaul the concentrate. 

 

The mine is responsible for maintaining the access road from the mine site to Km 

134.  The Yukon government is responsible for maintaining the remainder of the road 

from Km 134 to Watson Lake. 

 

SAFETY 
NATCL provides first aid coverage for the employees.  Certified first aid attendants 

who meet the requirements of the WSCC of the NWT are employed full time and provide 

24 hour first aid service.  The mine has a fully equipped first aid room located in the main 

office building and a satellite first aid room at the mine dry.  NATCL maintains an 

emergency transportation vehicle (ambulance) for the transportation of injured or sick 

personnel.  In case of critical emergency need, helicopter or a plane evacuation from the 

site to Whitehorse or Watson Lake can be arranged through EMS dispatch out of 

Whitehorse Yukon. 

A comprehensive and current compilation of procedures is maintained at the mine site 

satisfying the legislation of the Mines Health and Safety Act for the NWT. 

 

All levels of personnel hold responsibilities for safety in their areas.  The Site Safety 

Officer supports management, supervision, area trainers and workers through the 

following: 

• Ensuring compliance to the regulations of the Mines Health and Safety Act of 

the NWT 

• Training of employees in the safety aspects of their work and promote safe 

work habits 

• Keeping records of employees safety training 

• Developing and maintaining current applicable procedures 

• Selecting appropriate safety and emergency response equipment 

• Ensuring the competency of  emergency response teams 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 17-29

• Carrying out site safety inspections to ensure compliance with regulations and 

regulatory standards 

• Co chair and manage the activities of the Occupational Health and Safety 

Committee 

• Ensure that a current Emergency Response Plan is in place and all employees 

are aware and competent to their responsibilities under the plan. 

• Reporting and recording as required 

Each new employee undergoes an induction and training program appropriate to 

his/her experience level and department of employment.  

 

The mine has an Occupational Health & Safety Committee and its activities are 

conducted in accordance with applicable NWT regulations. All accidents and incidents 

(including spills) are reported and investigated with the intent of preventing recurrence. 

NATCL maintains mine rescue services at the mine site.  The Mine Rescue Team 

operates from a room located at the mine dry building.  NATC provides ongoing mine 

rescue training to meet the requirements of the regulations. The key mine underground 

workings and facilities such as the refuge stations, maintenance shop, lunch rooms, 

electric substations, load out, and other important areas are equipped with telephones.  

This network is connected with the site telephone system. In case of an underground 

emergency, the mine utilizes an ethyl mercaptan stench gas system for warning 

underground employees.  This system relies on injecting the ethyl mercaptan gas into the 

compressed air lines and into the fresh air at the intake fan station. 

MANPOWER 

The CanTung mine is organized as a single status fly-in / fly-out 365 day operation.  

NATC vehicles transport Northern employees from Whitehorse and Watson Lake to the 

mine site.  Southern employees are chartered to/from site with 2 Beech 1900 aircrafts on 

each Wednesday's crew rotation.  The charter pick up points are Vancouver, Campbell 

River, Prince George & Smithers, BC.  Most employees work on a rotation schedule, 

nominally three weeks on and three weeks off, 12 hours per day.  Variances for longer 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 17-30

shifts and for averaging of overtime over the six week work cycle (42 hour average work 

week) have been obtained and are renewed on a yearly basis.   

Before the mine closure in 2003, the operation had 173 employees.  The budgeted 

manpower number for fiscal year 2008/2009 is set at 225, plus an additional 8 positions 

are allocated to the Capital Development 3600 Ramp.  Current manpower levels, as of 

Nov 30, 2008 are summarized in Table 17-6.  Manpower numbers reflect total payroll, 

with approximately half of the hourly employees and more than half of the staff on site at 

any given time.  NATC makes all attempts to hire Northern and First Nations 

(particularly Liard First Nations) when able.  As at November 30, 2008, 54 employees are 

considered Northern hires, 30 First Nations are employed by NATC, of which 19 are 

members of the Liard First Nation (closest community to the mine site).

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

 The Cantung Mine is in compliance with applicable regulations. The following is 

a summary from the 2007 report, with updated information supplied by NATCL: 

 
PERMITS 
 On December 5, 2003 NATCL received notification from the Mackenzie Valley 

Land and Water Board (MVLWB) of the renewal of the type "A" Water License (the 

license) for a period of five years, expiring on November 29, 2008. The Water Licence 

outlines the permitted water use and includes a surveillance program and criteria for 

discharge. There are also a number of conditions related to the operation. The water 

license was extended by 60 days to January 28, 2009 as outlined below. 

 

 In July 2007, NATCL applied to the MVLWB for a 5 year renewal to the license. 

The renewal process is a public process involving public consultation, comment review 

and public hearings. The original public hearings scheduled for July 23-25, 2008 were 

postponed by the MVLWB at the request of the hosting communities due to personal 

tragedies in both small communities. Due to this delay NATC was requested to apply to 

the MVLWB for a 60 day license extension, which was approved by the Minister of 

Indian and Northern Affairs on September 8, 2008. 

 

 The public hearings for the five year license renewal are rescheduled for October 

28-30, 2008, with the new proposed license to be forwarded December 9, 2008 by the 

MVLWB to the Minister of INAC for his approval. 

 

 The original security deposit required under the prior license was $900,000 

(which was and is posted in support of the license). The renewed license requires that 

NATCL post an additional security deposit of $7,000,000 over time (see Mine Closure, 

below).  NATC negotiated the terms of the form of security deposit with INAC, which 

has jurisdiction over such an arrangement and to whose benefit the deposits are to be 

posted, and entered into the Reclamation Security Agreement (RSA) effective May 31, 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.  
 

 17-38

2005.  NATCL has posted a total of $3,700,000 in cash and $4,200,000 in the required 

form of secured promissory note pursuant to the RSA. The total security posted in favour 

of INAC is $7,900,000 which fulfills the security requirements of the Water License up 

to November 29, 2008. The amounts owing are secured against NATCL's assets by way 

of a General Security Agreement (GSA).  

 

The RSA provides for the cash components payable to INAC to increase under 

certain events.  Any funds in excess of ultimate reclamation costs will be returned to 

NATCL. 

MINE CLOSURE CONSIDERATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS 
 In the past, there have been a number of mine abandonment and reclamation plans 

prepared for the Cantung site. As required in the water license, the most recent plan for 

final abandonment and reclamation of the mine was submitted by NATCL to the 

MVLWB in November 2007. In February 2008, the MVLWB informed NATCL that 

they could not approve the plan as submitted, and following an agreement with the 

MVLWB, NATC has agreed to submit an updated Closure & Reclamation Plan (CRP), 

with all data that is available, to the MVLWB by March 31, 2009. 

 

 

 Mine closure cost estimates were included in all reclamation submissions. 

Additional mine closure cost estimates have been prepared for NATCL, the MVLWB and 

INAC. The range of closure cost estimates is shown in the table below. The MVLWB 

selected the reclamation security of $7.9 million for the 2003 license based upon the 

estimates up to December 2003. As part of the present ongoing license renewal process, 

the security estimates have been updated by NATC and Brodie Consulting, as shown in 

the table below.

TOTAL 149.70 
 

The total estimated unit cost for the project $149.70 per ton milled, including head 

office costs.  This cost is based on processing 1,100 tons/day of ore and producing two 

types of concentrates, G1 and Flotation.   

 

Monthly total operating costs are forecast to be in the order of $4.98 million.   

 
MINE 

The estimated cost of mining is substantially higher in comparison with the costs 

attained during previous years, due to higher rates for labour and consumables such as 

explosives, ground support, and fuels.  

 

Open pit and PUG Zone mining costs are not included in the cash flow estimate. 

 
MILL  

The milling cost is estimated to be $21.14 per ton milled.  This cost is in line with 

past performance when adjusted for inflation and higher costs of materials, energy, and 

consumables.  

 
PLANT SERVICES 

The plant unit cost is estimated to be $37.05 (surface plus power) per ton milled.  No 

major changes or improvements are expected to take place in the site operation.   



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN

SITE ADMINISTRATION 
The administration unit cost is estimated to be $22.38 (site, Sodexho, head office) per 

ton milled.  Head office costs are included in the administration costs.  Increased costs for 

manpower, employee transportation, and the camp result in substantially higher costs 

than in the past. 

 

MARKETS/CONTRACTS 

Cantung will produce two product lines of concentrate: a premium gravity 

concentrate (G1) containing approximately 65% WO3, accounting for 75% of the 

production output and a flotation grade concentrate containing 45% to 50% WO3, 

accounting for 25%.  As discussed in the Mineral Processing section, concentrates may 

be blended in various configurations to maximize revenue. 

 

NATCL sells the G1 product at prices based on free market values for ammonium 

paratungstate (APT).  Flotation concentrate is converted to APT through tolling 

arrangements prior to sale.  Customers for the Cantung products include North American, 

European, and Chinese APT producers. 

NATCL's competitors are the tungsten producers within China, the Beralt mine in 

Portugal, and, on a smaller scale, producers within Russia, Africa, South America, 

Thailand, and Vietnam.  Although China is unable to export concentrate, NATC must 

compete against Chinese mines to supply to APT producers within China.  

 
PRICING 

November 2008 London Metal Bulletin (LMB) European free market price quotation 
for APT is approximately US$252 per MTU.  Before 2005, prices were fairly consistent 
in the range of US$40 to US$90 per MTU, with a median of approximately US$60 per 
MTU.  See the following Figure 17-10

MARKET OUTLOOK  

According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), global reserves in 2004 were 

2,900,000 tons of contained tungsten, with China accounting for the largest reserves at 

1,800,000 tons followed by Canada with 260,000 tons and by Russia with 250,000 tons. 

Current global tungsten consumption is approximately 85,000 tonnes and is expected 

to increase to 110,000 tonnes over the next five years.  The June 2008 forecasted growth, 

according to GBRM (tungsten industry analysts), is 5% annually to 2012.  If these 

projections hold true, the demand for 2009 should be approximately 89,000 tonnes of 

tungsten.  The estimated production for the Cantung mine for fiscal year 2009 is 

approximately 3,100 tonnes of WO3 or 2,450 tonnes of contained tungsten, representing 

approximately 3% of estimated global demand.   

 

In addition to sale of concentrates, NATCL is currently exploring new product 

potential as part of a joint venture with a nanotechnology manufacturing company.

NATCL will provide material for downstream processing into tungsten powders, and new 

tungsten composites with applications primarily in the automotive and sporting sectors 

with a focus on lead replacement. 

 

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

The Pre-Tax Cash Flow Projection shown in Table 17-9 has been generated from the 

life of mine physicals as shown in Table 17-2 and capital and operating cost data.  The 

Cash Flow starts in October 2008 (the Mineral Reserve estimation date), and is organized 

by NATCL's fiscal year, which runs from October to September.  A summary of the key 

criteria is provided below. 

 

ECONOMIC CRITERIA 
PHYSICALS 

• Mine life:   1.6 years 

• Total mill feed:  655,706 tons at a grade of 1.10% WO3 

• Operations 365 days per year 

• Mill throughput of 1,100 tons per day from underground, or approximately 

400,000 tons per year. 

• Metallurgy as per mill performance: 

o Tungsten recovery 76.4% 

o Gravity concentrate (G1) 

 Grade 65% 

 Distribution 75% 

 Recovery relative to mill feed 60.1% 

o Flotation concentrate  

 Grade 47%  

 Distribution 25% 

 Recovery relative to mill feed 16.3% 

 

 



NORTH AMERICAN TUNGSTEN  
CORPORATION LTD.

REVENUE 

• Tungsten selling price over entire life of mine 

o US$205/MTU for G1 product 

o US$183/MTU for Flotation product converted to APT  

• Revenue recognized at the time of production 

• Average exchange rate US$1: $C1.16 

• Teck Royalty 1% 

• Insurance, Freight & Marketing charges of $280/ton 

• Moisture content <1% (Flotation product)  

 
COSTS 

• Sustaining capital:  $5.6 million 

• Exploration:  $1.40 million 

• The average operating cost over the mine life, including head office cost, is 

estimated to be $149.70 per ton milled  

CASH FLOW MODEL 
Considering the Cantung Mine on a stand-alone basis, the undiscounted pre-tax cash 

flow totals CDN$9.2 million over the remaining mine life.  As an operating mine without 

significant capital requirements, cash flow is anticipated to be positive over the course of 

the mine life. 

 

The site Unit Cost of Production is CDN$187 per MTU of WO3.  A low discount rate 

is appropriate due to the short mine life, and the lower risk associated with an operating 

mine.  The Net Present Value (NPV) at a 6% discount rate is $8.4 million.  This is a 2008 

constant dollar model and, as mine life is relatively short (1.6 years), introduction of 

inflation/deflation criteria to the model will make little difference to NPV figures.  

PROJECT SENSITIVITY 
Figure 18-10 shows the project sensitivity to the following factors: 

• Tungsten price 
 
• Operating costs

18 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
In NATCL's opinion, the Cantung Mine is positioned to take advantage of recent 

high prices for tungsten.  The Mine has the advantages of considerable operating history, 

low capital requirements, and established contacts with suppliers and customers.  The 

Mine has operated successfully in the past, however, it should be noted that it is a 

relatively high cost producer, and has experienced numerous shutdowns during periods of 

low tungsten prices.  In NATCL's opinion, the key risk to mine profitability lies in 

tungsten price sustainability and mined head grades for the remainder of the mine life. 

 

Given the forecast strong continued demand for tungsten metal, and somewhat bullish 

price forecasts, NATCL is of the opinion that the base case G1 price scenario of 

US$205/MTU is reasonable for the entire life of mine.  At prices below current levels, the 

Mine generates positive cash flow, so there is margin to allow for negative changes in the 

mine plan and cost estimates.   

 

When production is taken into account, Mineral Reserves have increased since the 

previous estimate at year end 2007. The increase is due to exploration of new zones, 

inclusion of lower-grade areas rendered economic by higher prices, and planned pillar 

recovery in previously mined areas through the use of longhole mining methods.  

  

There are Mineral Resources in the Open Pit/PUG Zone that could potentially be 

mined.  Past open pit and PUG designs proposed production in the order of more than one 

year of mill feed. 

 

  As long as development and stope preparation continues in a timely manner, 

longhole mining should provide steady production at a lower cost than cut and fill 

mining.  Longhole pillar mining carries a risk of lower grades from higher dilution, 

however, production estimates carry a reasonable and appropriate allowance for expected 

dilution.
