Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 1-1 

1 SUMMARY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) has been retained by Laramide Resources Ltd. 

(Laramide or the Company) to prepare an independent Technical Report on the Crownpoint 

Uranium Project (the Project) located in McKinley County, New Mexico, USA.  The purpose of 

this report is to support the disclosure of an initial Mineral Resource estimate for the Project.  

This Technical Report conforms to National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for 

Mineral Projects (NI 43-101).  RPA visited the Project on August 17, 2017. 

 

The Project consists of portions of three sections of land, Section 9, Section 24, and Section 

25, totalling approximately 615 acres.  The history of exploration and mine development 

activities for the Project dates back to the late 1960s.  Mine development (surface facilities, 

one production and two ventilation shafts) was carried out at the Section 24 property in the 

early 1980s by a joint-venture between Conoco and Westinghouse.  In 1980, adjacent to the 

Section 9 property, Mobil Oil Corporation (Mobil) constructed and operated an in-situ recovery 

(ISR) pilot test facility with positive results concerning recovery of uranium and loading of resin.  

Exploration and development activities continued through the early 1990s by Uranium 

Resources Inc. (URI) towards acquisition of necessary permits to carry out in-situ recovery 

operations.  The Project was acquired by Laramide in January 2017 from URI (now Westwater 

Resources, Inc.). 

 

Tables 1-1 and 1-2 summarize the Mineral Resource estimate for the Project prepared by 

RPA, based on drill hole data available as of September 1, 2018.  Due to the historical nature 

of the data, the classification of Mineral Resources on the Project is limited to Inferred, until 

new confirmation data can be obtained.  Using a 0.5 ft-% eU3O8 grade-thickness product (GT) 

cut-off, Inferred Mineral Resources with an effective date of October 24, 2018 total 4.2 million 

tons at an average grade of 0.106% eU3O8 containing 8.9 million pounds U3O8 of which 

Laramide controls 2.5 million tons at an average grade of 0.102% eU3O8 containing 5.1 million 

pounds U3O8.  No Mineral Reserves have been estimated for the Project. 

 

The Mineral Resource estimate for the Project was prepared by RPA with the assistance of 

Laramide's technical team to conform to Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and

Notes for Tables 1-1 and 1-2: 

1. CIM (2014) definitions were followed for Mineral Resources. 
2. Mineral Resources are reported at a GT cut-off of 0.5 ft-% eU3O8. 
3. A minimum thickness of 2.0 ft was used. 
4. A minimum cut-off grade of 0.03% eU3O8 based on historic mining costs and parameters from the 

district was used. 
5. Internal maximum dilution of 5.0 ft was used. 
6. Grade values have not been adjusted for disequilibrium. 
7. Tonnage factor of 15 ft3/ton is based on the tonnage factor historically used by the mining operators in 

the area. 
8. Mineralized areas defined by isolated or widely spaced drill holes were excluded from the estimate. 
9. Numbers may not add due to rounding. 

 

RPA is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 

marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resource 

estimate.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 1-3 

CONCLUSIONS 
RPA offers the following conclusions regarding the Crownpoint Project: 

 

• The Project is a significant uranium deposit of low to moderate grade. 
 

• The uranium mineralization consists of a series of stacked roll front deposits. 
 

• Drilling to date has intersected localized, low to moderate grade mineralized zones 
contained within five sandstone units of the of the Westwater Canyon Member of the 
Morrison Formation. 
 

• The sampling, sample preparation, and sample analysis programs are appropriate for 
the style of mineralization. 
 

• Although continuity of mineralization is variable, drilling to date confirms that local 
continuity exists within individual sandstone units. 
 

• No significant discrepancies were identified with the survey location, lithology, and 
electric and gamma log interpretation data in historical holes.   
 

• Descriptions of recent drilling programs, logging, and sampling procedures have been 
well documented by Laramide, with no significant discrepancies identified. 
 

• There is a low risk of depletion of chemical uranium compared to radiometrically 
determined uranium in the Crownpoint mineralization. 
 

• The resource database is valid and suitable for Mineral Resource estimation. 
 

RECOMMENDATIONS 
Historical drilling at the Crownpoint Project has outlined the presence of significant uranium 

mineralization, which warrants further investigation. 

 

Table 1-3 shows Laramide's proposed 2019 budget of US$470,000 for exploration drilling in 

areas of potential mineralization (specifically SW¼ of Section 24).  Washing out of several 

historical holes and confirmatory geophysical logging are also planned for completion in 2019.

RPA makes the following recommendations for future resource estimation updates and in 

support of Laramide's proposed 2019 budget: 

 
GEOLOGY 

• Although there is a low risk of depletion of chemical uranium compared to 
radiometrically determined uranium in the Crownpoint mineralization, additional 
sampling and analyses should be completed to supplement results of the limited 
disequilibrium testing to date. 
 

• Additional confirmation drilling should be completed at the earliest opportunity to 
confirm historical drill hole data on all zones.  RPA recommends that 10% of the holes 
be core holes in support of chemical assay for grade and equilibrium analysis. 

 
MINERAL RESOURCES 

• A suite of bulk density samples should be collected over the Project area, for each 
lithology type and grade range. 
 

• Exploration should be planned for areas noted in the Technical Report where wide-
spaced drilling previously identified potential mineralization.  This drilling, in conjunction 
with the core studies, may lead to areas of the present Inferred Mineral Resource to be 
upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources, and the potential discovery of additional 
mineral resources. 

 

TECHNICAL SUMMARY 

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The eastern end of the Crownpoint Uranium Project is located one mile west of the town of 

Crownpoint, in McKinley County, New Mexico.  The Project is located in the Church Rock-

Crownpoint sub-district of the Grants Mineral Belt in northwestern New Mexico and comprises 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Laramide Resources Ltd. – Crownpoint Uranium Project, Project #3042

parts of Sections 9, 24, and 25 of Township 17 North, Range 13 West (T17N-R13W), New 

Mexico 6th Principal Meridian. 

 

LAND TENURE 
The Project consists of portions of three sections of land totalling approximately 615 acres.  

The properties are accessible from the town of Crownpoint along West Route 9 which crosses 

the Project, and locally via dirt roads.  The mineral rights to the properties consist of a mix of 

unpatented mining claims and private mineral rights.  The surface estates are managed by the 

US Bureau of Land Management (US BLM) or privately owned by Laramide.  The properties 

were acquired by Laramide in January 2017 from URI.   

 

EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
At the Project, infrastructure is available for future exploration and mine development, with 

paved road access to the Project and dirt road access locally.  Power lines and natural gas 

supplies which could be used for mining operations are located near and around the Project 

area.  In the Project vicinity, domestic water supplies are provided by the Navajo Tribal Utility 

Authority through a pipeline distribution system.  Water rights sufficient to operate a potential 

ISR uranium mine are owned by Laramide.  Several former surface facilities constructed on 

Section 24 to service the Conoco underground mine are still present and well maintained.  

 

HISTORY 
The history of exploration and resultant historical resource estimates are described below for 

Sections 9 and 24 of the Project, since the original ownership varied.  No drilling records or 

resource estimates were noted for the Section 25, T17N-R13W claim group (Hydro 1-8).  

 

Drilling on the property began in 1968 by Mobil and continued intermittently until early 1990s 

by various contractors on various sections across the Project.  The majority of drilling was 

completed during the latter part of the 1970s. 

 

The estimates presented in this section are considered to be historical in nature and should 

not be relied upon.  Key assumptions and estimation parameters used in these estimates are 

not fully known to the authors of this report; it is therefore not possible to determine what 

additional work is required to upgrade or verify the historic estimates as current Mineral 

Resources.  A qualified person has not completed sufficient work to classify the historical

GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
The Project is located in the Church Rock-Crownpoint sub-district of the greater Grants Mineral 

Belt uranium district of northwestern New Mexico.  The Grants Mineral Belt lies along the 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Laramide Resources Ltd. – Crownpoint Uranium Project, Project #3042 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 1-7 

southern flank of the San Juan Basin located in the southeast corner of the Colorado Plateau.  

The belt extends from just west of Church Rock eastward for approximately 100 miles to the 

area of Laguna, and is approximately 25 miles to 30 miles wide north-south.  The principal 

host rocks for the uranium mineralization in the Crownpoint area are fluvial sandstones within 

the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation, called the Westwater Canyon member.  The Morrison 

Formation was deposited in a continental setting by alluvial fans and braided streams that 

partially filled the southern ancestral San Juan Basin.  The strata gently dip northward from 

one to three degrees with no known faulting on the Crownpoint Project. 

 

The typical mineralized rock in the Crownpoint district, as well as the Ambrosia Lake and 

Jackpile districts to the east, occurs as uranium-humate cemented sandstone.  The uranium 

mineralization consists largely of coffinite and sparse to minor amounts of unidentifiable 

organic-uranium oxide complexes that are light grey-brown to black; the dark colour is 

attributed to humic acids derived from buried organic materials. 

 

Uranium mineralization is identified in five host sand units: Westwater sands Jmw A to E.  

Mineralization is generally confined to the individual sand units except where intervening 

shales/mudstones are absent and the sand units are merged.  Regionally, gangue 

mineralization includes varying amounts of vanadium, molybdenum, copper, selenium, and 

arsenic.  The mineralization coats and fills the intergranular spaces of the host sandstones.   

 

The primary mineralization control is the presence of quartz-rich, arkosic, fluviatile sandstones 

in the Morrison Formation.  The uranium mineralization generally trends west-northwest to 

east-southeast, following a similar trend of the primary sandstone host deposition.  The 

presence of carbonaceous matter as humate pods is important.  Detrital plant fragments are 

less common in the Crownpoint district than in the Ambrosia Lake district, however, they 

contributed to the reduction of the uranium minerals and development of the extensive tabular 

deposits that were subsequently "destroyed" and partially remobilized into roll-front features 

during subsequent oxidation in the Middle to Late Tertiary.   

 

EXPLORATION STATUS 
No exploration work or activities have been conducted by Laramide on the Crownpoint 

property.  Laramide is scheduled to begin exploration activities in 2019.

 Laramide Resources Ltd. – Crownpoint Uranium Project, Project #3042 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 1-8 

RPA notes that typical roll-front mineralization does not usually present as pod type distribution 

of mineralization as indicated in a number of isolated pods in the SW ¼ of Section 24.  RPA is 

of the opinion that there is a high probability that additional drilling in this area will confirm 

mineralization continuity between these pods. 

 

MINERAL RESOURCES 
The Crownpoint Mineral Resource estimate prepared by RPA is based on results of historical 

drilling completed from 1968 to 1990.  The effective date of the Mineral Resource estimate is 

October 24, 2018.  Due to the historical nature of the data, the classification of Mineral 

Resources on the Project is limited to Inferred, until new confirmation drill hole data can be 

obtained.   

 

RPA prepared a geological model of the various sands over the Project area, and created 

grade, thickness, and GT contours, manually using Vulcan software, over the mineralized 

areas of each sand unit, using a cut-off grade of 0.03% eU3O8, a minimum thickness of two 

feet, and allowing internal dilution up to five feet. 

 

No capping of percent eU3O8 was performed prior to compositing across sand unit thickness. 

 

Density was applied at 15 ft3/ton, consistent with past production and neighbouring deposits. 

 

The areas between each GT and thickness contour intervals within the boundaries of the cut-

off grade contour (0.02% eU3O8) were measured using ArcGIS software in order to calculate 

tons, pounds, and grade.   

 

Mineralized lenses defined by isolated or widely spaced drill holes were excluded from the final 

resource estimate. 

 

RPA used 0.5 ft-% eU3O8 GT cut-off based on similar deposit types and operations and based 

on discussions with Laramide. 

 

The Mineral Resource estimate and classification are in accordance with the CIM (2014) 

definitions.  The Mineral Resource estimate also satisfies the requirements of the JORC Code. 

 

There are no Mineral Reserves on the property at this time.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 4-1 

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The eastern end of the Crownpoint Uranium Project is located one mile west of the town of 

Crownpoint, in McKinley County, New Mexico (Figure 4-1).  The Project is located in the 

Church Rock-Crownpoint sub-district of the Grants Mineral Belt in northwestern New Mexico 

and comprises parts of Sections 9, 24, and 25 of Township 17 North, Range 13 West (T17N-

R13W), New Mexico 6th Principal Meridian (Figure 4-2).  

 

LAND TENURE 
The Project consists of portions of three sections of land totalling approximately 615 acres.  

The Project is accessible from the town of Crownpoint along West Route 9 which crosses the 

Project, and locally via dirt roads.  The mineral rights to the properties consist of a mix of 

unpatented mining claims and private mineral rights.  The surface estates are managed by the 

US Bureau of Land Management (US BLM) or privately owned by Laramide.  The properties 

were acquired by Laramide in January 2017 from URI.   

 

All of the Crownpoint holdings are reported by Laramide to be in good standing.  The annual 

mining claim holding costs are US$155/claim.  The total for the 2019 assessment year was 

US$4,495 (29 claims), and has been paid by Laramide in August 2018 to the US BLM, plus 

nominal county filing fees. 

 

RPA is not aware of any environmental liabilities on the property.  Laramide has all required 

permits to conduct the proposed work on the property.  RPA is not aware of any other 

significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform the 

proposed work program on the property. 

 

MINERAL RIGHTS 
The following details the surface and mineral estates of each section on the property.  For this 

discussion, the following definitions, summarized from www.mine-engineer.com, are used: 

 
• Un-patented Mining Claim:  An un-patented mining claim is a particular parcel of US 

Federal land, valuable for a specific mineral deposit or deposits. It is a parcel for which an 
individual has asserted a right of possession.  The right is restricted to the extraction and 
development of a mineral deposit.  The rights granted by a mining claim are valid against 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Laramide Resources Ltd. – Crownpoint Uranium Project, Project #3042 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 4-2 

a challenge by the United States and other claimants only after the discovery of a valuable 
mineral deposit.  With an un-patented claim, the right to extract minerals is leased from the 
government.  No land ownership is conveyed.  There are two types of mining claims, lode 
and placer. 
 

o Lode Claims:  Deposits subject to lode claims include classic veins or lodes having 
well-defined boundaries. They also include other rock in-place bearing valuable 
minerals and may be broad zones of mineralized rock.  Lode claims are usually 
described as parallelograms with the longer side lines parallel to the vein or lode.  
Descriptions are by metes and bounds surveys (giving length and direction of each 
boundary line).  US Federal statute limits their size to a maximum of 1,500 ft in 
length along the vein or lodge. Their width is a maximum of 600 ft, 300 ft on either 
side of the centreline of the vein or lode.  The end lines of the lode claim must be 
parallel to qualify for underground extralateral rights. Extralateral rights involve the 
rights to minerals that extend at depth beyond the vertical boundaries of the claim. 
 

o Placer Claims:  Mineral deposits subject to placer claims include all those deposits 
not subject to lode claims.  Originally, these included only deposits of 
unconsolidated materials, such as sand and gravel, containing free gold or other 
minerals. By Congressional acts and judicial interpretations, many nonmetallic 
bedded or layered deposits, such as gypsum and high calcium limestone, are also 
considered placer deposits.  Placer claims, where practicable, are located by legal 
subdivision of land (for example: E 1/2 NE 1/3 NE 1/4, Section 2, Township 10 
South, Range 21 East, Mount Diablo Meridian). The maximum size of a placer claim 
is 20 acres per locator. 

 
• Private Minerals:  Mineral rights ownership refers to who owns the rights to extract 

minerals – that is, oil, gas, gold, coal and other metals and minerals – from lands located 
in that country. This ownership is very important, since the rights confer considerable 
potential for profit from the extraction of these minerals.  In virtually all countries around the 
world, the owner of the surface land has absolutely no rights with regard to mineral 
ownership.  In the USA, however, the owner of the surface land can also have the rights to 
extract minerals from underneath that land. In other words, private individuals own much 
of the mineral rights across the USA, as opposed to governmental or state organizations. 

 

SECTION 9, T17N-R13W 
The Section 9 property (~160 acres) consists of nine unpatented Lode Mining Claims.  The 

surface estate is managed by the US BLM.  The mining claims are contiguous. 

 

SECTION 24, T17N-R13W 
The Section 24 property (S½ = ~320 acres) consists of 12 unpatented mining claims (Consol 

1, 2; CP 10-19) and a 40% interest in the remainder of the property held by private mineral 

ownership.  The surface estate of the SW¼ is managed by the US BLM and the SE¼ is 

privately held by Laramide.  The mining claims and private mineral rights are contiguous.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 4-3 

SECTION 25, T17N-R13W 
The Section 25 property (~135 acres) consists of eight unpatented mining claims (Hydro 1-8).  

The surface estate is managed by the US BLM.  The mining claims are contiguous.  

 

ROYALTIES AND OTHER ENCUMBRANCES 
A 5% royalty for the Project is owed to URI (now Westwater Resources Inc.).  Laramide can 

purchase the royalty in the future.   

 

PERMITTING 
The Project is located on lands with varying regulatory management including the US BLM 

and privately owned lands.  A portion of the Project (Sections 24, 25) has had extensive 

permitting activity leading to the issuance of several regulatory clearances for the extraction of 

uranium by in-situ recovery (ISR) techniques.   

 

In 1987, URI began field and permitting activities towards the development of an ISR uranium 

operation at the Project, in conjunction with hydrogeologic analysis studies from the Church 

Rock Project 20 miles to the west.  The Church Rock Project is described in a previous NI 43-

101 Technical Report by RPA for Laramide, dated November 14, 2017 (RPA, 2017).   

 

As part of the purchase of the Project from URI, Laramide obtained the following regulatory 

clearances for portions of the Crownpoint and Church Rock Projects: 

• Final Environmental Impact Statement (Docket No. 40-8968) prepared by the US 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC) in cooperation with the US BLM and the 
US Bureau of Indian Affairs (US BIA) dated February 1997. 
 

• Radioactive Materials Licence from the US NRC, issued 1998, amended in 2006 and 
in "timely renewal". 
 

• Aquifer Exemption issued in the US Environmental Protection Agency, dated 1989. 
 

• Water Rights transfer, approved by the office of New Mexico State Engineer, dated 
October 19, 1999.  

 

Additional regulatory clearances are necessary for potential production and include: 

• Discharge Permit/Underground Injection Control (UIC) Permit from the New Mexico 
Environmental Department.  

 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Laramide Resources Ltd. – Crownpoint Uranium Project, Project #3042 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 4-4 

• Right-of-Way Permit from the US BIA or the Navajo Nation. 
 

Prior to Laramide's purchase of the Project, environmental activist groups and others filed 

various legal actions, in state and federal courts, against issuance of the regulatory clearances. 

 

During 2010, previous owner URI, in the name of subsidiary Hydro Resources Inc. (HRI), 

pursued and won two significant court judgments with respect to the development of the 

proposed ISR uranium mine at the Section 8 Church Rock Project which is part of the greater 

Crownpoint Uranium Project.  The first, an action challenging the UIC Permit, granted by the 

State of New Mexico, was based on whether Section 8 was considered to be in "Indian 

Country".  On September 13, 2010, the 10th Circuit Court's en banc decision that Section 8 

was not "Indian Country" was upheld.  The second, an action challenging the US NRC licence, 

was won on November 15, 2010 when the US Supreme Court denied a petition by interveners 

to review the 10th Circuit Court's decision upholding the US NRC licence. 

 

Once the necessary additional regulatory clearances described above are completed, RPA is 

not aware of any factors or risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform 

the proposed work program on the Project.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 5-1 

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
ACCESSIBILITY 
The eastern end of the Crownpoint Project is located one mile west of Crownpoint, New 

Mexico, a town of approximately 2,300 people (2010 US census data).  The Section 24 part of 

the Project is easily accessed from Crownpoint on a paved road (West Route 9) and local 

access to the other parts of the Project is available via dirt roads.  

 

CLIMATE 
The climate is classified as arid to semi-arid continental, characterized by cool, dry winters, 

and warm, dry summers.  January temperatures in nearby Gallup range from 11°F to 45°F and 

July temperatures range from 51°F to 89°F.  Annual precipitation, mostly in the form of rain but 

some snow, is approximately 12 inches (www.wikipedia.org).  The local climate allows for year-

round mining and exploration drilling; however, winter snow and inclement weather conditions 

may interrupt operations occasionally. 

 

LOCAL RESOURCES 
The nearby city of Gallup (approximately 40 miles to the southwest) is the county seat of 

McKinley County.  Albuquerque, the state's largest city of over 500,000 people, is located 

approximately 120 miles south and east along US Interstate 40.  These cities, and others 

nearby, have the personnel and necessary supplies to staff and operate the proposed 

Crownpoint ISR mine.  

 

INFRASTRUCTURE 
At the Project, infrastructure is available for future exploration and mine development, with 

paved road access to the Project and dirt road access locally.  Power lines and natural gas 

supplies which could be used for mining operations are located near and around the Project 

http://www.wikipedia.org/

area.  In the Project vicinity, domestic water supplies are provided by the Navajo Tribal Utility 

Authority through a pipeline distribution system.  Water rights sufficient to operate the potential 

ISR uranium mine are owned by Laramide.  Several former surface facilities constructed on 

Section 24 to service the Conoco underground mine are still present and well maintained.  

 

PHYSIOGRAPHY  
The topography of the Project is typical of the high desert and plateau-valley physiography of 

the greater Colorado Plateau, consisting of relatively flat-topped mesas or plateaus with 

rugged cliff faces that merge with flat lying valley bottoms.  Elevations range from 6,800 ft in 

the valley bottoms to over 7,500 ft atop the plateaus.  Vegetation is sparse and consists of 

mostly sagebrush and native grasses in the valley bottoms and piñon and juniper trees on the 

plateaus.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 6-1 

6 HISTORY 
The Crownpoint uranium deposits are located in northwestern New Mexico and are part of the 

Grants Uranium Region in the San Juan Basin.  During a period of nearly three decades (1951-

1980), the Grants uranium district yielded more uranium than any other district in the United 

States.  The Grants district is a large area in the San Juan Basin, extending from east of 

Laguna to west of Gallup, and includes eight sub-districts (Figure 6-1).  Most of the uranium 

production in New Mexico has come from the Grants district along the southern margin of the 

San Juan Basin in McKinley and Cibola counties.  The production was derived principally from 

the Westwater Canyon Member of the Jurassic Morrison Formation.  

 

In the Grants Mineral Belt, historic mining produced more than 340 million pounds of U3O8 

from 1948 to 2002, predominantly from underground and open-pit operations.  On Section 24, 

mine development consisted of sinking production and ventilation shafts and construction of 

surface facilities, however, no uranium ore was produced.  

 

Although there are no current mining operations in the Grants district today, numerous 

companies have acquired uranium properties and plan to explore and develop deposits in the 

district in the future. 

 

PRIOR OWNERSHIP 
The history of exploration and mine development activities for the Crownpoint Uranium Project 

dates back to the late 1960s.  Mine development (surface facilities, one production and two 

ventilation shafts) was carried out on Section 24 in the early 1980s by a joint-venture between 

Conoco and Westinghouse.  In 1980, adjacent to the Section 9 property, Mobil constructed 

and operated an ISR pilot test facility with positive results concerning recovery of uranium and 

loading of resin.  Exploration and development activities continued through the early 1990s by 

URI towards acquisition of necessary permits to carry out ISR operations.  The properties were 

acquired by Laramide in January 2017 from URI (now Westwater Resources, Inc.).

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT HISTORY 
The history of exploration and resultant historical resource estimates are described below for 

Sections 9 and 24 of the Project, since the original ownership varied.  No drilling records or 

resource estimates were noted for the Section 25, T17N-R13W claim group (Hydro 1-8).  

 

The estimates presented in this section are considered to be historical in nature and should 

not be relied upon.  Key assumptions and estimation parameters used in these estimates are 

not fully known to the authors of this report; it is therefore not possible to determine what 

additional work is required to upgrade or verify the historic estimates as current Mineral 

Resources.  A qualified person has not completed enough work to classify the historical 

estimates as current Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves and Laramide is not treating the 

historical estimates as current Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves. 

 

The historical resource estimates reported below are superseded by the current Mineral 

Resource estimates presented in Section 14 of this report.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND 
MINERALIZATION 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
The Project is located in the Church Rock-Crownpoint sub-district of the greater Grants Mineral 

Belt uranium district of northwestern New Mexico (Figure 6-1).  The Grants Mineral Belt lies 

along the southern flank of the San Juan Basin located in the southeast corner of the Colorado 

Plateau.  The belt extends from just west of the Church Rock area eastward for approximately 

100 miles to the area of Laguna and is approximately 25 miles to 30 miles wide north-south, 

including the area around Crownpoint.  The principal host rocks for the uranium mineralization 

in the Crownpoint area are fluvial sandstones within the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation, 

called the Westwater Canyon member. 

 

The Morrison Formation was deposited in a continental setting by alluvial fans and braided 

streams that partially filled the southern ancestral San Juan Basin.  These fluvial deposits were 

derived from the Mogollan highlands immediately south and west from Laramide orogenic uplift 

during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.  Subsequent uplift occurred prior to deposition 

of the Dakota Sandstone resulting in portions of the Brushy Basin and underlying deposits 

being partially eroded.  The strata gently dip northward from one to three degrees with no 

known faulting on the Crownpoint Project.  

 

LOCAL GEOLOGY 
The exposed stratigraphy in the Crownpoint area includes marine and non-marine sediments 

of Late Cretaceous age (Mesa Verde Group, Mancos Shale, Dakota Sandstone), 

unconformably overlying the continental-fluvial sediments of the Jurassic Morrison Formation, 

the principal host of uranium mineralization (Figures 7-1 and 7-2).  The strata dip generally 

from one to three degrees north towards the San Juan Basin.

PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

MESA VERDE GROUP (EARLY CRETACEOUS) 
At Crownpoint, the Mesa Verde Group consists of the Point Lookout Sandstone and Crevasse 

Canyon and Gallup Formations.  From the surface, in descending order, the Point Lookout 

Sandstone consists of grey-brown to white, fine to medium grained sandstone; the Crevasse 

Canyon consists of the Gibson Coal (interbedded sandstone, siltstone, shale, and coal beds), 

Dalton Sandstone (light grey to tan, fine grained marine sandstone), Mulatto Tongue of the 

Mancos Shale (light grey to dark grey shale, siltstone and mine marine sandstone), Stray 

Sandstone (light grey to white, medium grained, well sorted sandstone), and the Dilco Coal 

(interbedded light grey sandstone, siltstone, carbonaceous shale, and coal beds).  Finally, the 

Gallup Formation consists of light grey, fine grained, well-sorted sandstone.  The Mesa Verde 

Group at Crownpoint is approximately 1,100 ft thick.   

 

MANCOS SHALE FORMATION (EARLY CRETACEOUS) 
The Mancos Shale consists of approximately 500 ft of marine, light grey to black shale with 

interbedded fine-grained marine sandstone beds referred to as the Two Wells Member.   

 

DAKOTA SANDSTONE FORMATION (EARLY CRETACEOUS) 
The Dakota Sandstone consists of a well-sorted fine-grained quartzose sandstone, deposited 

in a mostly marine, shoreface environment.  In the subsurface at the Project, the Dakota 

Sandstone is approximately 160 ft thick.  Although mineralized in the nearby Church Rock 

district, the Dakota Sandstone is not mineralized at the Project.   

 

MORRISON FORMATION (LATE JURASSIC)  
BRUSHY BASIN MEMBER 
In the Crownpoint area, the Brushy Basin Member is typically 150 ft thick, depending on the 

level of erosion prior to deposition of the overlying Dakota Sandstone.  The Brushy Basin 

consists of mostly shales/mudstones of greenish-grey to red-brown colour with a sandstone 

sub-member (Poison Canyon).  Although mineralized in the nearby Church Rock district, the 

Brushy Basin Member is not mineralized at the Project.  

 
WESTWATER CANYON MEMBER 
In the Crownpoint area, the uranium mineralization is located within sandstones of the 

Westwater (Jmw) Canyon Member.  Eight sandstones, informally termed A to H in descending

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 7-5 

order, make up the Westwater Canyon Member, separated by thin shales and mudstones.  

The sands are yellow-grey to pale red and the shales are typically greenish-grey.  In the Project 

area, the Westwater is approximately 300 ft to 340 ft thick, depending on the paleotopography 

and the amount of subsequent erosion prior to deposition of the Dakota Sandstone.  In the 

Project area, only the upper five sandstone units (Jmw A to Jmw E sands) are mineralized.  

 

STRUCTURE 
Regionally, the strata shallowly dip north, from one to three degrees, toward the San Juan 

Basin.  No known faults are projected to exist on the Crownpoint Project.  

 

MINERALIZATION 
The typical mineralized rock in the Crownpoint district, as well as the Ambrosia Lake and 

Jackpile districts to the east, occurs as uranium-humate cemented sandstone.  The uranium 

mineralization consists largely of coffinite and sparse to minor amounts of unidentifiable 

organic-uranium oxide complexes that are light grey-brown to black; the dark colour is 

attributed to humic acids derived from buried organic materials (Wentworth et al., 1980)  

 

For this report, the uranium mineralization is defined by each host sand unit: Westwater sands 

Jmw A to Jmw E.  Mineralization is generally confined to the individual sand units except where 

intervening shales/mudstones are absent, and the sand units are merged.  Regionally, gangue 

mineralization includes varying amounts of vanadium, molybdenum, copper, selenium, and 

arsenic.  The mineralization coats and fills the intergranular spaces of the host sandstones.   

 

The primary mineralization control is the presence of quartz-rich, arkosic, fluviatile sandstones 

of the Morrison Formation.  The uranium mineralization generally trends west-northwest to 

east-southeast, following a trend similar to that of the primary sandstone host deposition 

(Smith, 1980; Wentworth et al., 1980).  The presence of carbonaceous matter as humate pods 

is important.  Detrital plant fragments are less common in the Crownpoint district than in the 

Ambrosia Lake district, however, they contributed to the reduction of the uranium minerals and 

development of the extensive tabular deposits.  The original uranium deposits were 

subsequently "destroyed" and partially remobilized into roll-front features during subsequent 

oxidation in the Middle to Late Tertiary (Saucier, 1980).

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
The mineralized deposits in the Crownpoint district are sandstone-type uranium deposits.  

These types of deposits are irregular in shape, roughly tabular and elongated, and range from 

pods a few feet in thickness, length and width, to extensive bodies of mineralization tens of 

feet thick, several hundreds to thousands of feet long, and several tens to hundreds of feet 

wide.  The deposits are roughly parallel to the enclosing beds, but may cut across bedding 

where interbedded shales/mudstones are absent, and the sand units merged.   

 

Two types of uranium deposits occur in the Grants Mineral Belt: primary trend deposits and 

post-faulting, or redistributed, secondary deposits.  The primary trend mineralization, located 

predominantly further east near Ambrosia Lake, was controlled by humic acids (humates) 

which acted as the reductants to precipitate the uranium from groundwater.  In the Crownpoint 

area, the secondary deposits predominate, having formed from remobilization and destruction 

of nearby, primary trend deposits.  These secondary deposits at the Project are tabular in 

shape, and many formed into "roll-fronts", similar in shape to the Wyoming-type uranium roll 

fronts that are mined by ISR methods in Wyoming, Nebraska, Texas, and other areas of the 

world.  Roll-front mineralization is distributed across a regional interface of oxidized and 

reduced groundwater environments, known as the redox front (Figures 8-1 and 8-2).

9 EXPLORATION 
Laramide has not conducted any exploration on the Project since acquiring the properties from 

URI in January 2017.  All exploration data used in this report were generated by former 

property owners, mostly from the 1970s, with lesser exploration having occurred in the 1960s, 

1980s, and 1990s.  The data consist of exploration and development drilling, geophysical 

logging, evaluation reports, core studies, resource estimates, and other information.  All of 

these data are secured in Laramide's Lakewood, Colorado, office.

10 DRILLING 
Mud-rotary drilling using bits from four to six inches in diameter was the principal method of 

exploration and delineation of uranium mineralization on the Project.  The holes were drilled 

vertically, and, upon completion, each hole was logged with a geophysical tool for gamma-ray, 

spontaneous potential (SP), and resistivity.  Physical samples were retrieved at five-foot 

intervals and were used for lithologic determinations and comparison to the SP and resistivity 

curves from the geophysical logs.  Additionally, cored samples were retrieved for metallurgical 

studies, including mill leach amenability, ISR processes and post ISR groundwater restoration, 

and assayed for disequilibrium determinations.  Downhole drift surveys of the drill holes were 

also conducted. 

 

As of the effective date of this report, Laramide's predecessors completed on and immediately 

adjacent to the subject properties a total of 305 holes totaling 648,702 ft drilled from 1968 to 

1990.  Laramide has not carried out any drilling on the Project.  A drilling summary up to and 

including all drilling information available as of September 1, 2018 is presented in Table 10-1.  

A map of drill hole collars and traces is shown in Figure 10-1.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 
HISTORICAL SAMPLING METHODS 

RADIOMETRIC LOGGING  
Upon completion of drilling, each drill hole on the Project was logged with a suite of geophysical 

tools including natural-gamma, spontaneous potential (SP), and resistivity.  Use of a 

radiometric probe to measure the natural gamma radiation allows for an indirect estimate of 

uranium content to be made (eU3O8).  The SP and resistivity curves assist with determination 

and correlation of the sedimentary horizons, i.e., sandstone/shale boundaries, between drill 

holes.  Downhole natural gamma data from 305 historic drill holes with a total logged length of 

648,702 ft was used for the Crownpoint Mineral Resource estimate. 

 

The geophysical tools were maintained by specialized logging companies in the USA including 

Century Geophysical Corp., Dalton Well Logging Services, Geosciences Associates, 

Computer Logging Inc., and Western Wireline Corp. 

 

GAMMA-RAY LOGGING 
Probing with a gamma logging unit employing a natural gamma probe was completed 

systematically on every drill hole.  The probe measures natural gamma radiation using one 0.5 

in. by 1.5 in. sodium iodide (NaI) crystal assembly.  Normally, accurate concentrations can be 

measured in uranium grades ranging from less than 0.1% U3O8 to as high as 5% U3O8.  Data 

are logged at a speed of 15 ft to 20 ft per minute up hole, typically in open holes.  Occasionally, 

unstable holes are logged through the drill pipe and the grades are adjusted for the material 

type and wall thickness of the pipe used. 

 

The radiometric or gamma probe measures gamma radiation which is emitted during the 

natural radioactive decay of uranium and variations in the natural radioactivity originating from 

changes in concentrations of the trace element thorium as well as changes in concentration of 

the major rock forming element potassium.   

 

Potassium decays into two stable isotopes, argon and calcium, which are no longer 

radioactive, and emits gamma rays with energies of 1.46 MeV.  Uranium and thorium, however, 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Laramide Resources Ltd. – Crownpoint Uranium Project, Project #3042 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 11-2 

decay into daughter products which are unstable, i.e., radioactive.  The decay of uranium forms 

a series of about a dozen radioactive elements in nature which finally decay to a stable isotope 

of lead.  The decay of thorium forms a similar series of radioelements.  As each radioelement 

in the series decays, it is accompanied by emissions of alpha or beta particles, or gamma rays.  

The gamma rays have specific energies associated with the decaying radionuclide.  The most 

prominent of the gamma rays in the uranium series originate from decay of bismuth-214, and 

in the thorium series from decay of thallium-208.   

 

The natural gamma measurement is made when a detector emits a pulse of light when struck 

by a gamma ray.  This pulse of light is amplified by a photomultiplier tube, which outputs a 

current pulse, accumulated and reported as counts per second (cps).  The gamma probe is 

lowered to the bottom of a drill hole and data are recorded as the tool travels to the bottom and 

then is pulled back up to the surface.  The current pulse is carried up a conductive cable and 

processed by a logging system computer, which stores the raw gamma cps data. 

 

The basis of the indirect uranium grade calculation referred to as "eU3O8" (for "equivalent 

U3O8") is the sensitivity of the detector used in the probe, which is the ratio of cps to known 

uranium grade and is referred to as the probe calibration factor.  Each detector's sensitivity is 

measured when it is first manufactured and is also periodically checked throughout the 

operating life of each probe against a known set of standard "test pits," with various known 

grades of uranium mineralization or through empirical calculations.  Application of the 

calibration factor, along with other probe correction factors, allows for immediate grade 

estimation in the field as each drill hole is logged. 

 

Downhole total gamma data are subjected to a complex set of mathematical equations, taking 

into account the specific parameters of the probe used, speed of logging, size of bore hole, 

drilling fluids, and presence or absence of any type of drill hole casing.  The result is an indirect 

measurement of uranium content within the sphere of measurement of the gamma detector. 

 

The conversion coefficients for conversion of probe cps to % eU3O8 grades are based on the 

calibration results obtained at certified calibration facilities operated by the US AEC, now US 

Department of Energy (DOE), in Grants, New Mexico, and Grand Junction, Colorado.  Other 

test pits exist in Casper, Wyoming and George West, Texas.  Calibration results of appropriate 

water factors, pipe-factors, K-factors, and dead times were typically noted on the gamma logs 

or accompanying data sheets.

 Laramide Resources Ltd. – Crownpoint Uranium Project, Project #3042 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 11-3 

EQUIVALENT URANIUM GRADE CALCULATION 
For all of the gamma logs available at the Project, the grade percentage intercepts were 

reinterpreted.  Each of the gamma log files contained data sheets noting gamma cps at 0.5 ft 

intervals.  The data was entered into Excel files and the gamma cps were then converted to 

grade percent eU3O8 using the appropriate K-factors, water factors, and dead times for each 

of the geophysical probes used.  The cps for each gamma log was generated by the former 

operators of the Project, typically using the Gamlog program or calculated directly from the 

logging companies' output gamma cps data sheets at 0.5 ft intervals.  

 

Future exploration should include washing out of several of the older holes and re-probing 

using modern gamma tools for additional confirmation of the older gamma log results. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the drilling, logging, sampling, and conversion and recovery factors at 

Crownpoint meet or exceed industry standards at the time and are adequate for use in the 

estimation of Mineral Resources. 

 

DISEQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS 
Radioactive isotopes lose energy by emitting radiation and transition to different isotopes in a 

decay series or decay chain until they reach a stable non-radioactive state.  Decay chain 

isotopes are referred to as daughters of the parent isotope.  Uranium grade is determined 

radiometrically by measuring the radioactivity levels of certain daughter products formed 

during radioactive decay of uranium atoms.  Most of the gamma radiation emitted by nuclides 

in the uranium decay series is from daughter products in the series.  When all the decay 

products are maintained in close association with uranium-238 for the order of a million years, 

the daughter isotopes will be in equilibrium with the parent.  Disequilibrium occurs when one 

or more decay products is dispersed as a result of differences in solubility between uranium 

and its daughters, and/or escape of radon gas. 

 

Knowledge of, and correction for, disequilibrium is important for deposits for which the grade 

is measured by gamma-ray probes, which measure daughter products of uranium.  Where 

daughter products are in equilibrium with the parent uranium atoms, the gamma-ray logging 

method will provide an accurate measure of the amount of parent uranium that is present.  A 

state of disequilibrium may exist where uranium has been remobilized and daughter products 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Laramide Resources Ltd. – Crownpoint Uranium Project, Project #3042 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 11-4 

remain after the uranium has been depleted, or where uranium occurs and no daughter 

products are present.  Where disequilibrium exists, the amount of parent uranium present can 

be either underestimated or overestimated.  It is important to obtain representative samples of 

the uranium mineralization to confirm the radiometric estimate by chemical methods. 

 

Disequilibrium is determined by comparing uranium grades measured by chemical analyses 

with the "gamma only" radiometric grade of the same samples measured in a laboratory.  Core 

is sampled over mineralized intervals as determined by a hand-held Geiger counter or 

scintillometer to define mineralized boundaries.  Core intervals are split and sampled.  Each 

sample is crushed and pulverized, and then two, separate assays are made of the same pulps; 

a scaler-radiometric or closed can radiometric log and a chemical assay.  The disequilibrium 

factor is the ratio of the actual amount of uranium measured by chemical assay to the 

calculated amount based on the gamma-ray activity of daughters.  Disequilibrium is considered 

positive when there is a higher proportion of uranium present compared to daughters.  This is 

the case where decay products have been transported elsewhere or uranium has been added 

by, for example, secondary enrichment.  Positive disequilibrium has a disequilibrium factor 

which is greater than 1.0 and the calculated values are under estimating the quantity of 

uranium.  Disequilibrium is considered negative where daughters are accumulated and 

uranium is depleted and the calculated values are overestimating the quantity of uranium.  This 

negative disequilibrium has a disequilibrium factor of less than 1.0 but greater than zero. 

 

There are practical difficulties in comparing chemical analyses of uranium from drill hole 

samples with corresponding values from borehole gamma logging, because of the difference 

in sample size between drill core average grades in core or chip samples and radiometric 

probe measurements of gamma response from spheres of influence up to three feet in 

diameter.  Probe calibration and/or assay errors may also be misinterpreted as disequilibrium.  

If the gamma radiation emitted by the daughter products of uranium is in balance with the 

actual uranium content of the measured interval assay, uranium grade can be calculated solely 

from the gamma intensity measurement. 

 

The degree of disequilibrium will vary with the mineralogy of the radioactive elements and their 

surroundings which may create a reducing or oxidizing environment, climate, topography, and 

surface hydrology.

 Laramide Resources Ltd. – Crownpoint Uranium Project, Project #3042 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 11-5 

The sample volume will also affect the determination of disequilibrium, as a small core sample 

is more likely to show extreme disequilibrium than a larger bulk sample.  In some cases, the 

parents and daughters may have moved apart over the length of a sample, but not over a 

larger scale, such as the mineralized interval.  

 

In addition to mill and ISR amenability studies, core was retrieved from across the Project area 

to determine the potential for disequilibrium.  Pertaining to the Crownpoint deposits, the 

uranium-bearing host rocks are of Jurassic age, greater than 140 million years, and the 

uranium mineralization is believed to be of similar to slightly younger age (Wentworth et al., 

1980), both of which are significantly older than the approximate one million years necessary 

for daughter products to reach equilibrium with the initial uranium mineralization.  However, 

since the Crownpoint deposits are saturated in groundwater aquifers, the potential for 

remobilization by oxygenated waters is possible.   

 

The limited number of disequilibrium analysis reports provided by Laramide show that it is 

realistic to assume that the deposit is in equilibrium or slightly in favour of chemical grade 

(enriched), however, the data do not necessarily represent characteristics of the entire deposit.  

Therefore, no adjustment for disequilibrium in the deposit was made for this resource estimate 

(equilibrium factor = 1.0). 

 

Although there is a low risk of depletion of chemical uranium compared to radiometric uranium 

in the Crownpoint mineralization, RPA is of the opinion that there is the potential for areas of 

negative and positive equilibrium across the mineralized fronts, and that future exploration 

drilling and core retrieval target areas of oxidized and reduced mineralization.  Laramide should 

also utilize industry standard quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) for future exploration 

drilling and sampling, e.g., notation of gamma tool calibrations, core assays with blanks and 

third-party analyses, twinning or re-entry and re-logging of old holes, or specialized logging 

tools such as Prompt-Fission-Neutron.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 
AUDIT OF DRILL HOLE DATABASE 
RPA conducted a series of verification tests on the digitized database and files provided by 

Laramide.  The specific review tasks include:  

 
• Inspected drill hole summaries, drill hole location maps, cross-sections, grade by 

thickness (GT) contour, and other resource maps. 
 

• Examined mine plan reports, survey documents, metallurgical and disequilibrium 
studies, and ISR amenability and hydrologic reports. 
 

• Checked collar table: searched for incorrect or duplicate collar coordinates and 
duplicate hole IDs, property boundary limits, and a visual search for extreme survey 
values. 
 

• Checked survey table: searched for duplicate entries, survey points past the specified 
maximum depth in the collar table, and abnormal dips and azimuths. 
 

• Checked lithology table: searched for duplicate entries, intervals past the specified 
maximum depth in the collar table, overlapping intervals, negative lengths, missing 
collar data, missing intervals, and incorrect logging codes. 
 

• Checked assay table: searched for duplicate entries, sample intervals past the 
specified maximum depth, negative lengths, overlapping intervals, sampling lengths 
exceeding tolerance levels, missing collar data, missing intervals, and duplicated 
sample IDs. 

 

Independent verification of the historical laboratory results was not performed due to the 

unavailability of the core samples.

INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION OF ASSAY TABLE 
Verification of the gamma-logs and resulting grade % eU3O8 calculations were also completed.  

RPA inspected at least twenty geophysical logs for Section 9 and Section 24 for accuracy of 

the lithologic breaks, depths to sandstone/shales, and equivalent grade conversions.  No major 

discrepancies were found based on a review of the available data. 

 

RPA is of the opinion that database verification procedures for the Crownpoint Uranium Project 

comply with industry standards and are adequate for the purposes of Mineral Resource 

estimation.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 
Across the Project, core holes were drilled for mill amenability, compressive strength, density, 

ISR amenability and processing, post-ISR restoration, and disequilibrium studies.  The 

following summarizes a core leach study at the Section 24 property conducted in 1990-1991 

by URI, developed to determine the amenability of the Project deposits to ISR techniques 

(Hazen Research Inc., 1991). 

 

CORE LEACH STUDY, SECTION 24 
As part of its 1990-1991 ISR-mine permitting work, URI conducted core drilling across the 

Section 24 property.  Drill core was studied to demonstrate the amenability of the mineralized 

sandstone to ISR of uranium and to determine leach chemistry and expected recovery rates.  

Testing was also completed to demonstrate that the groundwater could be restored to pre-

mining conditions.  

 

Tests were conducted on one cored hole, DH-24-CP8 (4.71/99.45) recovered from the 
mineralized Jmw-B sand.  Core tests were performed by Hazen Research Inc. of Golden, 

Colorado, in order to predict which ions and trace elements would be elevated during recovery 

operations.  Two column leach tests were performed on core from CP-8 by URI's laboratory in 

Kingsville, Texas: one at a rate simulating actual leach solution flow rates and the other at an 

accelerated rate; and the analytical work was conducted by Jordan Laboratories of Corpus 

Christi, Texas.  Water utilized in the leach tests was recovered from aquifers containing 

uranium mineralization.  

 

At the conclusion of the leaching phase, a restoration test was undertaken.  A simulated 

reverse osmosis test was completed and showed that common ions, including HCO3, Cl and 

Ca, as well as conductivity, were readily restored to baseline drinking water standards.   

 

Results of the core and leach studies indicate that the Crownpoint deposits are amenable to 

ISR techniques utilizing the local groundwater fortified with oxygen, sodium bicarbonate 

(NaHCO3), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) leach solutions.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
RPA has estimated Mineral Resources for the Project based on results of several historical 

surface rotary drilling campaigns from 1968 to 1990.  The Crownpoint Mineral Resource 

estimate was completed utilizing the GT contour method, an industry standard for estimating 

uranium roll-front type deposits hosted within groundwater-saturated sandstones.  The 

mineralization at the Project has been previously shown to be amenable to ISR techniques. 

 

The Mineral Resource estimate for the Project was prepared to conform to Canadian Institute 

of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Reserves 

dated May 10, 2014 (CIM (2014) definitions) as incorporated by reference in NI 43-101 and 

was completed by RPA with the assistance of Laramide's technical team.  The Mineral 

Resource estimate also satisfies the requirements of the Australasian Code for Reporting of 

Exploration Results, Minerals Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code 2012 Edition) for 

Australian Securities Exchange compliance. 

 

Tables 14-1 and 14-2 summarize the Mineral Resource estimate for the Project prepared by 

RPA, based on drill hole data available as of September 1, 2018.  Due to the historical nature 

of the data, the classification of Mineral Resources on the Project is limited to Inferred, until 

new confirmation data can be obtained.  Laramide controls 100% of the mineral resource in 

the NW ¼ of Section 9, SW ¼ of Section 24 and NE ¼ of Section 25, and a 40% controlling 

interest across most of the SE ¼ of Section 24.  Figure 14-1 shows a breakdown of Laramide's 

controlling interest across the Project.  Using a 0.5 ft-% eU3O8 GT cut-off, Inferred Mineral 

Resources with an effective date of October 24, 2018, total 4.2 million tons at an average 

grade of 0.106% eU3O8 containing 8.9 million pounds U3O8 of which Laramide controls 2.5 

million tons at an average grade of 0.102% eU3O8 containing 5.1 million pounds U3O8. 

 

No Mineral Reserves have been estimated for the Project. 

 

RPA is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 

marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resource 

estimate.

RESOURCE DATABASE 
RPA was supplied with a drill hole database for the Project by Laramide in Microsoft Excel 

format.  The Crownpoint drill hole database dated September 1, 2018 was comprised of 305 

holes totalling 648,702 ft logged completed from 1968 to 1990, and included drill hole collar 

locations, including dip and azimuth, radiometric probe, and lithology data.  For each individual 

gamma log with mineralized sand zones, the grade % U3O8 data was accumulated at a 

minimum thickness of 2 ft at ≥0.03% eU3O8.  Drill holes immediately adjacent to the Section 9 

and 24 properties were utilized to assist in extending the roll-front features to property 

boundaries.  Mineralization outside of Laramide's Project boundary was not included in the 

reported Mineral Resource estimates.  A summary of the available data used in the modelling 

of mineralization is presented in Table 14-3.

GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION 
Uranium mineralization at the Project is hosted within sandstone units of the Jurassic Morrison 

Formation (Westwater Canyon Member: Jmw A to Jmw E sands) of western New Mexico.  

Tabular primary uranium mineralization and secondary mineralization remobilized into 

"Wyoming-type" roll-front deposits.  The deposits are distributed across a regional interface of 

oxidized and reduced environments, forming irregular and sinuous shaped deposits that 

extend across the Project area.  Depth to mineralization varies from 1,775 ft to 2,140 ft, 

depending on which sand unit is mineralized, topography, and the gentle northerly dip of the 

strata (1° to 3°). 

 

RPA carried out a detailed correlation of the sand units in the 305 drill holes available for 

the Crownpoint deposit using Leapfrog software.  Correlation of the lithology logs was 

accomplished using commonly accepted subsurface exploration methods with a primary

Technical Report NI 43-101 – November 16, 2018 Page 14-5 

emphasis on identifying sands and interbedded shales and assigning them "formation" marker 

designations, as interpreted by Laramide geologists.  RPA constructed a Project wide 

stratigraphic model that was used to define which sand unit each mineralized zone belonged 

to. 

 

RPA recognizes that uranium mineralization at the Project occurs within and proximal to five 

individual uranium bearing sand packages (Jmw A to Jmw E sands) across the Project that 

show varying degrees of interbedded clay beds, and hematite alteration.  The mineralization 

consists predominantly of coffinite.  There is evidence that mineralization within the individual 

sand units occurs as a series of one to three stacked roll-fronts, with the Jmw B and Jmw E 

sands at Section 24 hosting higher grade, thicker, and more continuous mineralization than 

the others as defined by the drilling (Figure 14-2). 

 

The stratigraphic interpretation was used to constrain the Mineral Resource estimate for each 

sand unit.  RPA was also provided with a map of the redox front for each sand unit, which was 

used to interpret the trend of the mineralized deposits, in particular the thickest parts of the 

roll-fronts.

TREATMENT OF HIGH GRADE ASSAYS 

CAPPING LEVELS 
Where the assay distribution is skewed positively or approaches log-normal, erratic high-grade 

assay values can have a disproportionate effect on the average grade of a deposit.  One 

method of treating these outliers in order to reduce their influence on the average grade is to 

cut or cap them at a specific grade level.  In the absence of production data to calibrate the 

capping level, inspection of the assay distribution can be used to estimate a "first pass" cutting 

level. 

 

RPA uses a number of industry practice methods to assess the influence of high grade uranium 

assays, and to determine if they will have undue influence on the resultant resource estimation.  

All mineralization intercepts located inside the mineralized sand units were used together to 

assess the risk and determine whether a cap of high grade values was needed to limit their 

influence within each mineralized zone.  Assay data were analyzed using a combination of 

histogram, probability, percentile, and cutting curve plots (Figures 14-3 and 14-4).  RPA is of 

the opinion that high grade capping is not required at this time, however, capping should be 

reviewed once additional data have been collected.

COMPOSITING 
Composites were created from the uncapped, raw assay values.  The minimum composite 

length used during interpolation was chosen considering the predominant sampling length, the 

minimum potential mining width, the style of mineralization, and the continuity of grade.  Given 

this distribution, deposit type, and considering the width of the mineralization, RPA utilized the 

following parameters for composites: 

 

• Minimum cut-off grade:  300 ppm (0.03% eU3O8) 
 

• Minimum thickness:  two feet 
 

• Maximum interval waste thickness:  five feet.  This is the material between two 
mineralized layers which can be included (absorbed) in one composite, provided the 
composite grade is above the cut-off grade. 
 

• Minimum GT value:  0.06 ft-% 
 

Assays within the individual sand domains were composited starting at the first mineralized 

sand boundary from the top of the sand unit and resetting at each new sand boundary.

Composites covered the whole mineralized interval in each sand unit and were not at a fixed 

length (Figure 14-5).  Each composite had an average grade, a thickness, and a GT value, 

which were used to contour each sand unit in each of Sections 9 and 24, as further described 

below. 

 

For this estimate, RPA did not discriminate between shale and sand units in this process.  

Future resource estimates will have to discriminate between those units which are potentially 

amenable and not amenable to ISR extraction.

SEARCH STRATEGY AND GRADE INTERPOLATION 
PARAMETERS 
Mineral Resources of the Crownpoint deposit have been estimated by RPA using the GT 

contour method (Agnerian and Roscoe, 2001).  The GT method of resource estimation is a 

technique best applied to estimate tonnage and average grade of relatively planar bodies, i.e., 

where the two dimensions of the mineralized body are much greater than the third dimension.  

For each of the five individual sand units, drill hole intercept composite values of grade, 

thickness, and GT were plotted in plan view and contoured (Figures 14-6 through 14-13).

Geometric (logarithmic) contour intervals of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, and 3 were used for the GT 

values because of the positively skewed statistical distribution of the grade and GT values.  

Thickness was contoured in a linear progression at 5 ft, 10 ft, 15 ft, 20 ft, 25 ft, 30 ft, and 35 ft 

intervals.  Weighted average grade of each composite was contoured in geometric intervals 

including the minimum cut-off grade value of 0.02% eU3O8.  The 0.02% grade contour was 

established as the outward limit for uranium mineralization to be considered as resource.   

Contouring was completed by Laramide staff in part by hand and ArcGIS software and the 

contours digitized.  The contours were inspected and, where necessary, manually adjusted or 

re-contoured by RPA to match geological and mineralized trends.  The thickest and highest 

GT values were generally associated with the redox front for each sand unit and RPA 

contoured them along the trend of the redox front. 

The areas between each GT and thickness contour intervals within the boundaries of the grade 

contour of 0.02% eU3O8 were measured using ArcGIS software to calculate tons, contained 

pounds, and grade for each sand unit and for each of Sections 9 and 24. 

Areas for both GT and thickness contours were broken into individual "pods" and numbered 

for final reconciliation of total resources.  Figure 14-14 shows an example of this numbering 

sequence for the E Sand in the S½ of Section 24.

Tons were calculated from the contoured thickness data for each sand unit in each of Sections 

9 and 24, inside of the 0.02% eU3O8 grade contour.  The area in square feet for each contour 

interval was multiplied by a thickness value representative of the contour interval to obtain a 

volume in cubic feet for each contour interval.  The volumes for each contour interval were 

summed and divided by the density factor of 15 ft3/ton to obtain the total tonnage for each sand 

unit in each section.  Table 14-4 is an example calculation sheet for tonnage.  The 

representative thickness for each contour interval is the geometric mean of the interval limits 

(Geo_Mean), which appears to better correspond to the average of all of the thickness values 

within the contour interval than the mid-point.

Contained pounds of U3O8 were calculated from the contoured GT data for each sand unit in 

each of Sections 9 and 24, inside of the 0.02% eU3O8 grade contour.  The area for each 

contour interval was multiplied by a GT value representative of the contour interval.  The values 

for each contour interval were summed and divided by the density factor of 15 ft3/ton to obtain 

the total contained pounds for each sand unit in each section.  Table 14-5 is an example 

calculation sheet for pounds.  The representative GT value for each contour interval is the 

geometric mean of the interval limits, which appears to better correspond to the average of all 

of the GT values and fits with the lognormal-like statistical distribution of GT and grade.

ALLOWANCE FOR WIDE SPACED DRILLING 
Mineralized lenses defined by isolated or widely spaced drill holes were not included in the 

final resource estimate, such as pods C6 though C11 (Figure 14-15). 

 

RPA notes that typical roll-front mineralization does not usually present as pod type distribution 

of mineralization as indicated in the C6 to C11 pods in the SW ¼ of Section 24 (Figure 14-15).  

RPA is of the opinion that there is a high probability that additional drilling in this area will 

confirm mineralization continuity between these pods.

BULK DENSITY 
Historic bulk density records were reviewed for core samples across the Project; the densities 

varied from 14 ft3/ton to 17 ft3/ton.  RPA assumed a tonnage factor of 15 ft3/ton, which was the 

typical tonnage factor used by the prior operators including Conoco and Mobil at Crownpoint 

for mineralized intervals in the Westwater Canyon Member sandstone units. 

 

RPA considers the density factor of 15 ft3/ton to be reliable and reasonable for the resource 

estimation. 
 

CUT-OFF GRADE 
RPA chose to use a 0.5 ft-% GT cut-off based on similar deposit types and ISR operations in 

the USA and Australia (Table 14-6).

CLASSIFICATION 
Definitions for resource categories used in this report are consistent with those defined by CIM 

(2014) and incorporated by reference in NI 43-101.  In the CIM classification, a Mineral 

Resource is defined as "a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest 

in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable 

prospects for eventual economic extraction".  Mineral Resources are classified into Measured, 

Indicated, and Inferred categories.  A Mineral Reserve is defined as the "economically 

mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource" demonstrated by studies at

23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
EnCore Energy Corp. (EnCore) holds a 60% interest in part of the southeast quarter of 

Township 17 North, Range 13 West in which Laramide holds a 40% interest.  Encore also 

holds a 100% interest in mineral rights in Sections 19 and 29 of Township 17 North, Range 12 

West.   

 

In 2012, EnCore (formerly Tigris Resource Corp.) filed a NI 43-101 Technical Report on Mineral 

Resources of its Crownpoint and Hosta Butte Uranium Projects (Beahm, 2012).  Table 23-1 

summarizes Mineral Resources on Encore's Crownpoint Project which comprises Sections 19, 

29, and the portion of the southeast quarter of Section 24 in which it holds a 60% interest, as 

reported in Beahm (2012).  RPA cautions that the information in Table 23-1, which shows total 

resource and EnCore controlled resource, has not been verified by the author and is not 

necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Laramide property that is the subject of this

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
RPA offers the following conclusions regarding the Crownpoint Project: 

 

• The Project is a significant uranium deposit of low to moderate grade. 
 

• The uranium mineralization consists of a series of stacked roll front deposits. 
 

• Drilling to date has intersected localized, low to moderate grade mineralized zones 
contained within five sandstone units of the of the Westwater Canyon Member of the 
Morrison Formation. 
 

• The sampling, sample preparation, and sample analysis programs are appropriate for 
the style of mineralization. 
 

• Although continuity of mineralization is variable, drilling to date confirms that local 
continuity exists within individual sandstone units. 
 

• No significant discrepancies were identified with the survey location, lithology, and 
electric and gamma log interpretation data in historical holes.   
 

• Descriptions of recent drilling programs, logging, and sampling procedures have been 
well documented by Laramide, with no significant discrepancies identified. 
 

• There is a low risk of depletion of chemical uranium compared to radiometrically 
determined uranium in the Crownpoint mineralization. 
 

• The resource database is valid and suitable for Mineral Resource estimation.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 
Historical drilling at the Crownpoint Project has outlined the presence of significant uranium 

mineralization, which warrants further investigation. 

 

Table 26-1 shows Laramide's proposed 2019 budget of $470,000 for exploration drilling in 

areas of potential mineralization (specifically SW¼ of Section 24).  Washing out of several 

historical holes and confirmatory geophysical logging are also planned for completion in 2019. 

 
TABLE 26-1   PROPOSED BUDGET 

Laramide Resources Ltd. – Church Rock Project 
 

Item US$ 
Drilling:  
12 exploration holes (approximately 2,000 ft deep) 360,000 
Geophysical logging (12 holes) 30,000 
Permitting activities (floral, faunal, access) 10,000 
Geologic support for drilling/coring activities 25,000 
Sub-total 425,000 
Contingency 45,000 
Total 470,000 

 

RPA makes the following recommendations for future resource estimation updates and in 

support of Laramide's proposed 2019 budget: 

 
GEOLOGY 

• Although there is a low risk of depletion of chemical uranium compared to 
radiometrically determined uranium in the Crownpoint mineralization, additional 
sampling and analyses should be completed to supplement results of the limited 
disequilibrium testing to date. 
 

• Additional confirmation drilling should be completed at the earliest opportunity to 
confirm historical drill hole data on all zones.  RPA recommends that 10% of the holes 
be core holes in support of chemical assay for grade and equilibrium analysis 

 
MINERAL RESOURCES 

• A suite of bulk density samples should be collected over the Project area, for each 
lithology type and grade range. 
 

• Exploration should be planned for areas noted in the Technical Report where wide-
spaced drilling previously identified potential mineralization.  This drilling, in conjunction 
with the core studies, may lead to areas of the present Inferred Mineral Resource to be
